I've always wanted one of my own. And shall you have man-servants, and maid-servants? Oh, Patty, you never could run a big establishment like that. You'll have to have a housekeeper.\"  \"I'm going to try it,\" said Patty, laughing. \"It will be an experiment, and, of course, I shall make lots of blunders at first; but I think it's a pity if a girl nearly sixteen years old can't keep house for her own father.\"  \"So do I,\" said Laura. \"And, anyhow, if you get into any dilemmas we'll all come over and help you out.\"  The girls laughed at this; for Laura Russell was a giddy little feather-head, and couldn't have kept house for ten minutes to save her life.  \"Much good it would do Patty to have the Tea Club help her keep house,\" said Florence Douglass. \"But we'll all make her lovely things to go to housekeeping with. I shall be real sensible, and make her sweeping-caps and ironing-holders.\"  \"Oh, I can beat that for sensibleness,\" cried Ethel Holmes. \"I read about it the other day, and it's a broom-bag. I haven't an idea what it's for; but I'll find out, and I'll make one.\"  \"One's no good,\" said Marian sagely. \"Make her a dozen while you're about it.\"  \"Oh, do they come by dozens?\" said Ethel, in an awestruck voice. \"Well, I guess I won't make them then. I'll make her something pretty. A pincushion all over lace and pin ribbons, or something like that.\"  \"That will be lovely,\" said Laura. \"I shall embroider her a tablecloth.\"  \"You'll never finish it,\" said Patty, who well knew how soon Laura's bursts of enthusiasm spent themselves. \"You'd better decide on a doily. Better a doily done than a tablecloth but begun.\"  \"Oh, I'll tell you-what we can do, girls,\" said Polly Stevens. \"Let's make Patty a tea-cloth, and we'll each write our name on it, and then embroider it, you know.\"  \"Lovely!\" cried Christine. \"Just the thing. Who'll hemstitch it? I won't. I'll embroider my name all right, but I hate to hemstitch.\"  \"I'll hemstitch it,\" said Elsie Morris. \"I do beautiful hemstitching.\"  \"So do I,\" said Helen Preston. \"Let me do half.\"  \"Ethel and I hemstitch like birds,\" said Lillian Desmond. \"Let's each do a side,--there'll be four sides, I suppose.\"  \"Well, the tea-cloth seems in a fair way to get hemstitched,\" said Patty. \"You can put a double row around it, if you like, and I'll be awfully glad to have it. I'll use it the first Saturday afternoon after I get settled.\"  \"I wish I knew where you're going to live,\" said Ethel. \"I'd like to have a correct mental picture of that first Saturday afternoon.\"  \"It's a beautiful day for walking,\" said Polly Stevens. \"Let's all go out, and take a look at the Warner place. Something tells me that you'll decide to live there.\"  \"I hope something else will tell you differently, soon,\" said Marian, \"for I'll never give my consent to that arrangement. However, I'd just as lieve walk out there, if only to convince you what a forlorn old place it is.\"  \"Come on; let's go, then. We can be back in an hour, and have tea afterwards. I'll get the key from Mr. Martin, as we go by.\"  Like a bombarding army the Tea Club stormed the old Warner house, and once inside its Colonial portal, they made the old walls ring with their laughter. The wide hall was dark and gloomy until Elsie Morris flung open the door at the other end, and let in the December sunshine.  \"Seek no farther,\" she cried dramatically. \"We have crossed the Rubicon and found the Golden Fleece! This is the place of all others for our Tea Club meeting, and it doesn't matter what the rest of the house may be like. Patty, you will kindly consider the matter settled.\"  \"I'll consider anything you like,\" said Patty; \"and before breakfast, too, if you'll only hurry up and get out of this damp, musty old place. I'm shivering myself to pieces.\"  \"Oh, it isn't cold,\" said Laura Russell; \"and while we're here, let's go through the house.\"  \"Yes,\" said Marian; \"examine it carefully, lest some of its numerous advantages should escape your notice. Observe the hardwood floors, the magnificent mahogany stair-rail, and the lofty ceilings!\"  The old floors were creaky, worm-eaten, and dusty; the stair-rail was in a most dilapidated condition, and the ceilings were low and smoky; so Marian scored her points.  \"But it is antique,\" said Ethel Holmes, with the air of an auctioneer. \"Ah, ladies, what would you have? It is a fine specimen of the Colonial Empire period, picked out here and there with Queen Anne. The mantels, ah,--the mantels are dreams in marble.\"  \"Nightmares in painted wood, you mean,\" said Lillian.  \"But so roomy and expansive,\" went on Ethel. \"And the wall-papers! Note the fine stage of complete dilapidation left by the moving finger of Time.\"  \"The wall-papers are all right,\" said Patty. \"They look as if they'd peel off easily. Come on upstairs.\"  The chambers were large, low, and rambling; and the house, in its best days, must have been an interesting specimen of its type. But after a short investigation, Patty was as firmly convinced as Marian that its charms could not offset its drawbacks.  \"I've seen enough of this moated grange,\" cried Patty. \"Come on, girls, we're going back to tea, right, straight, smack off.\"  \"There's no pleasing some folks,\" grumbled Ethel. \"Here's an ancestral pile only waiting for somebody to ancestralise it. You could make it one of the Historic Homes of Vernondale, and you won't even consider it for a minute.\"  \"I'll consider it for a minute,\" said Patty, \"if that will do you any good, but not a bit longer; and as the minute is nearly up, I move we start.\"     CHAPTER IV  BOXLEY HALL   After consultation with various real estate agents, and after due consideration of the desirable houses they had to offer, Mr. Fairfield came to the conclusion that the Bigelow house, which Marian had suggested, was perhaps the most attractive of any.  And so, one afternoon, a party of very interested people went over to look at it.  The procession was headed by Patty and Marian, followed by Mr. Fairfield and Aunt Alice, while Frank and his father brought up the rear. But as they were going out of the Elliotts' front gate, Laura Russell came flying across the street.  \"Where are all you people going?\" she cried. \"I know you're going to look at a house. Which one?\"  \"The Bigelow house,\" said Marian, \"and I'm almost sure Uncle Fred will decide to take it. Come on with us; we're going all through it.\"  \"No,\" said Laura, looking disappointed, \"I don't want to go; and I don't want the Fairfields to live in that house anyway. If they would only look at that little cottage next-door to us, I know they'd like it ever so much better. Oh, please, Mr. Fairfield, won't you come over and look at it now? It's so pretty and cunning, and it has the loveliest garden and chicken-coop and everything.\"  \"I don't want a chicken-coop,\" said Patty, laughing; \"I've no chickens, and I don't want any.\"  \"Our chickens are over there most of the time,\" said Laura.  \"Then, of course, we ought to have a coop to keep our neighbours' chickens in,\" said Mr. Fairfield; \"and if this cottage is as delightful as Miss Russell makes it out, I think it's our duty at least to go and look at it. If the rest of you are willing, suppose we go over there first, and then if we _should_ decide not to take it, we'll have time to investigate the Bigelow afterward\"  Marian looked so woe-begone that Patty laughed.  \"Cheer up, girl,\" she said; \"there isn't one chance in a million of our taking that doll's house, but Laura will never give us a minute's peace until we go and look at it; so we may as well go now, and get it over.\"  \"All right,\" said Marian; and Patty, with her two girl friends on either side of her, started in the direction of the cottage.  But when they reached it, Mr. Fairfield exclaimed in amazement. \"That little house?\" he said. \"Oh, I see; that's the chicken-coop you spoke of. Well, where is the house?\"  \"This is the house,\" said Laura; \"but, somehow, it does look smaller than usual; still, it's a great deal bigger inside.\"  \"No doubt,\" said Frank. \"I've often noticed that the inside of a house is much larger than the outside. Of course, we can't all go in at once, but I'm willing to wait my turn. Who will go first?\"  \"Very well, you may stay outside,\" said Laura. \"I think the rest of us can all squeeze in at once, if we try.\"  But Frank followed the rest of the party, and, passing through the narrow hall, they entered the tiny parlour.  \"I never was in such a crowded room,\" said Marian. \"I can scarcely get my breath. I had no idea there were so many of us.\"  \"Well, you're not going to live here,\" said Laura. \"There's room enough for just Patty and her father.\"  \"There is, if we each take a room to ourself,\" said Mr. Fairfield. \"You may have this parlour, my daughter, and I'll take the library. Where is the library, Miss Russell?\"  \"I think it has just stepped out,\" said Frank; \"at any rate, it isn't on this floor; there's only this room, and the dining-room, and a kitchen cupboard.\"  \"Very likely the library is on the third floor,\" said Marian; \"that would be convenient.\"  \"There isn't any third floor,\" explained Laura. \"This is what they call a story-and-a-half house.\"  \"It would have to be expanded into a serial story, then, before it would do for us,\" said Mr. Fairfield. \"We may not be such big people, but Patty and I have a pretty large estimate of ourselves, and I am sure we never could live in such a short-story-and-a-half as this seems to be.\"  \"Indeed, we couldn't, papa,\" said Patty. \"Just look at this dining-room. I'm sure it's only big enough for one. We would have to have our meals alternately; you could have breakfast, and I would have dinner one day, and the next day we'd reverse the order.\"  \"Come, look at the kitchen, Patty,\" called out Frank; \"or at least stick your head in; there isn't room for all of you. See the stationary tubs. Two of them, you see; each"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10268"],["title","Patty at Home (#4)"],["body","the size of a good comfortable coffee-cup.\"  \"Just exactly,\" said Patty, laughing; \"why, I never saw such a house. Laura Russell, what were you thinking of?\"  \"Oh, of course, you could add to it,\" said Laura. \"You could build on as many more rooms as you wanted, and you could run it up another story and a half, and that would make three stories; and I do want you to live near me.\"  \"We're sorry not to live near you, Miss Laura,\" said Mr. Fairfield; \"but I can't see my way clear to do it unless you would move into this bandbox, and let us have your roomy and comfortable mansion next door.\"  \"Oh, there wouldn't be room for our family here,\" said Laura.  \"But you could build on a whole lot of rooms,\" said Frank, \"and add enough stories to make it a sky-scraper; and put in an elevator, and it would be perfectly lovely.\"  Laura laughed with the rest, and then, at Mrs. Elliott's suggestion, they all started back to the Bigelow house.  \"Now, this is something like,\" said Marian, as they went in at the gate and up the broad front walk.  \"Like what?\" said Frank.  \"Like a home for the Fairfields. What shall you call it--Fairfield Hall, Fairfield Place, or what?\"  \"I don't know,\" cried Patty, dashing up the veranda steps. \"But isn't it a dear house! I feel at home here already. This big piazza will be lovely in warm weather. There's room for hammocks, and big chairs, and little tables, and everything.\"  Inside, the house proved very attractive. The large square hall opened into a parlour on one side and a library on the other. Back of the library was a little conservatory, and beyond that a large, light dining-room with an open fireplace.  \"Here's a kitchen worth having,\" said Aunt Alice, who was investigating ahead of the rest; \"and such convenient pantries and cupboards.\"  \"And this back veranda is great,\" said Frank, opening the door from a little hall.  \"Oh, yes,\" said Patty; \"see the dead vines. In the summer it must have honeysuckles all over it. And there's the little arbour at the foot of the garden. I'm going down to see it.\"  Marian started to follow her, but Laura called her back to show her some new attraction, and Patty ran alone down the veranda steps, and through the box-bordered paths to the little rustic arbour.  \"Goodness!\" she exclaimed, as she reached it. \"Who in the world are you?\"  For inside the arbour sat a strange-looking girl of about Patty's own age. She was a tall, thin child, with a pale face, large black eyes, and straight black hair, which hung in wisps about her ears.  \"I'm Pansy,\" she said, clasping her hands in front of her, and looking straight into Patty's face.  \"You're Pansy, are you?\" said Patty, looking puzzled. \"And what are you doing here, Pansy?\"  \"Well, miss, you see it's this way. I want to go out to service; and when I heard you was going to have a house of your own, I thought maybe you'd take me to work for you.\"  \"Oh, you did! Well, why didn't you come and apply to me, then, in proper fashion, and not sit out here waiting for me to come to you? Suppose I hadn't come?\"  \"I was sure you'd come, miss. Everybody who looks at this house comes out to look at the arbour; but there hasn't been anybody before that I wanted to work for. Please take me, miss; I'll be faithful and true.\"  \"What can you do?\" asked Patty, half laughing, and half pitying the strange-looking girl. \"Can you cook?\"  \"No, ma'am, I can't cook; but I might learn it. But I didn't mean that. I thought you'd have a cook, and you'd take me for a table girl, you know; and to tidy up after you.\"  \"I do want a waitress; but have you had any experience?\"  \"No, ma'am,\" said the girl very earnestly, \"I haven't, but I'm just sure I could learn. If you just tell me a thing once, you needn't ever tell it to me again. That's something, isn't it?\"  \"Indeed it is,\" said Patty, remembering a certain careless waitress at Mrs. Elliott's. \"Have you any references?\"  \"No,\" said the girl, smiling; \"you see, I've never lived anywhere except home, and I suppose mother's reference wouldn't count.\"  \"It would with me,\" said Patty decidedly. \"I think your mother ought to know more about you than anybody else. What would she say if I asked her?\"  \"She'd say I was careless and heedless and thoughtless, and didn't know anything,\" replied the girl cheerfully; \"and I am that way at home, but I wouldn't be if I worked for you, because I want to be a waitress, and a good one; and you'd see how quick I'd learn. Oh, do take me, miss. You'll never be sorry, and that's sure!\"  This statement was accompanied by such decided gestures of head and hands that Patty was very nearly convinced to the contrary, but she only said, \"I'm sorry, Pansy,--you said your name was Pansy, didn't you?\"  \"Yes, miss,--Pansy Potts.\"  \"What an extraordinary name!\"  \"Is it, miss? Well, you see, my father's name was Potts; and mother named me Pansy, because she's so fond of the flower. You don't think the name will interfere with my being a waitress, do you?\"  \"Not so far as I'm concerned,\" said Patty, laughing; \"but, you see, I shall be a very inexperienced housekeeper, and if I have an inexperienced waitress also, I don't know what might happen.\"  \"Why, now, miss; it seems to me that that would work out just right. You're a young housekeeper, but I expect you know just about what a waitress ought to do, and you could teach me; and I know a lot about housekeeping, and I could teach you.\"  The sincerity in Pansy's voice and manner impressed Patty, and she looked at her closely, as she said:  \"It does seem good proportion.\"  \"It is,\" said Pansy; \"and you've no idea how quickly I can learn.\"  \"Can you?\" said Patty. \"Well, then, learn first to call me Miss Patty. It would suit me much better than to hear you say 'miss' so often.\"  \"Yes, Miss Patty.\"  \"And don't wring your hands in that absurd fashion, and don't stand first on one foot and then on the other, as if you were scared out of your wits.\"  \"No, Miss Patty.\"  Pansy ceased shuffling, dropped her hands naturally to her sides, and stood in the quiet, respectful attitude that Patty had unconsciously assumed while speaking.  Delighted at this quick-witted mimicry, Patty exclaimed:  \"I believe you will do. I believe you are just the one; but I can't decide positively, now. You go home, Pansy, and come to-morrow afternoon to see me at Mrs. Elliott's. Do you know where I live?\"  \"Yes, Miss Patty,\" and, with a respectful little bob of her head, Pansy Potts disappeared, and Patty ran back to the house.  \"Well, chickadee,\" said Mr. Fairfield, \"I have about decided that you and I can make ourselves comfortable within these four walls, and, if it suits your ladyship, I think we'll consider that we have taken the house.\"  \"It does suit me,\" said Patty. \"I'm perfectly satisfied; and _I_ have taken a house-maid.\"  \"Where did you get her?\" exclaimed Frank. \"Do they grow on trees in the garden? I saw you out in the arbour with one.\"  \"Yes,\" said Patty; \"I picked her off a tree. She isn't quite ripe, but she's not so very green; and I think she'll do. Never mind about her now. I can't decide until I've had a talk with Aunt Alice. I'm so glad you decided on this house, papa. Oh, isn't it lovely to have a home! It looks rather bare, to be sure, but, be it ever so empty, there's no place like home. Now, what shall we name it? I do like a nice name for a place.\"  \"It has so many of those little boxwood Hedges,\" said Aunt Alice, looking out of the window, \"that you might call it The Boxwood House.\"  \"Oh, don't call it a wood-house,\" said Uncle Charley.  \"Call it the wood-box, and be done with it,\" Frank.  \"I like 'Hall,'\" said Patty. \"How is Boxwood Hall?\"  \"Sounds like Locksley Hall,\" said Marian.  \"More like Boxley Hall,\" said Frank.  \"Boxley Hall!\" cried Patty. \"That's just the thing! I like that.\"  \"Rather a pretentious name to live up to,\" said Mr. Fairfield.  \"Never mind,\" said Patty. \"With Pansy Potts for a waitress, we can live up to any name.\"  And so Patty's new home was chosen, and its name was Boxley Hall.     CHAPTER V  SHOPPING   As Boxley Hall was a sort of experiment, Mr. Fairfield concluded to rent the place for a year, with the privilege of buying.  By this time Patty was sure that she wished to remain in Vernondale all her life; but her father said that women, even very young ones, were fickle in their tastes, and he thought it wiser to be on the safe side.  \"And it doesn't matter,\" as Patty said to Marian; \"for, when the year is up, papa will just buy the house, and then it will be all right.\"  Having found a home, the next thing was to furnish it; and about this Mr. Fairfield was very decided and methodical.  \"To-morrow,\" he said, as they were talking it over at the Elliotts' one evening, \"to-morrow I shall take Patty to New York to select the most important pieces of furniture. We shall go alone, because it is a very special occasion, and we can't allow ourselves to be hampered by outside advices. Another day we shall go to buy prosaic things like tablecloths and carpet-sweepers; and then, as we know little about such things, we shall be glad to take with us some experienced advisers.\"  And so the next day Patty and her father started for the city to buy furniture for Boxley Hall.  \"You see, Patty,\" said her father after they were seated in the train, \"there is a certain proportion to be observed in furnishing a house, about which, I imagine, you know very little.\"  \"Very little, indeed,\" returned Patty; \"but, then, how should I know such things when I've never furnished a house?\"  \"I understand that,\" said Mr. Fairfield; \"and so, with my advantages of age and experience, and your own natural good taste, I think we shall accomplish this thing successfully. Now, first, as to what we have on hand.\"  \"Why, we haven't anything on hand,\" said Patty; \"at least, I have a few pictures and books, and the afghan grandma's knitting for me; but that's all.\"  \"You reckon without your host,\" said her father, smiling. \"I possess"]]]
