To celebrate so great a paladin     Have moved me the impassioned courtesy     And the discreet discourses of Friar Thomas,  And with me they have moved this company.”     Paradiso: Canto XIII   Let him imagine, who would well conceive     What now I saw, and let him while I speak     Retain the image as a steadfast rock,  The fifteen stars, that in their divers regions     The sky enliven with a light so great     That it transcends all clusters of the air;  Let him the Wain imagine unto which     Our vault of heaven sufficeth night and day,     So that in turning of its pole it fails not;  Let him the mouth imagine of the horn     That in the point beginneth of the axis     Round about which the primal wheel revolves,—  To have fashioned of themselves two signs in heaven,     Like unto that which Minos’ daughter made,     The moment when she felt the frost of death;  And one to have its rays within the other,     And both to whirl themselves in such a manner     That one should forward go, the other backward;  And he will have some shadowing forth of that     True constellation and the double dance     That circled round the point at which I was;  Because it is as much beyond our wont,     As swifter than the motion of the Chiana     Moveth the heaven that all the rest outspeeds.  There sang they neither Bacchus, nor Apollo,     But in the divine nature Persons three,     And in one person the divine and human.  The singing and the dance fulfilled their measure,     And unto us those holy lights gave need,     Growing in happiness from care to care.  Then broke the silence of those saints concordant     The light in which the admirable life     Of God’s own mendicant was told to me,  And said: “Now that one straw is trodden out     Now that its seed is garnered up already,     Sweet love invites me to thresh out the other.  Into that bosom, thou believest, whence     Was drawn the rib to form the beauteous cheek     Whose taste to all the world is costing dear,  And into that which, by the lance transfixed,     Before and since, such satisfaction made     That it weighs down the balance of all sin,  Whate’er of light it has to human nature     Been lawful to possess was all infused     By the same power that both of them created;  And hence at what I said above dost wonder,     When I narrated that no second had     The good which in the fifth light is enclosed.  Now ope thine eyes to what I answer thee,     And thou shalt see thy creed and my discourse     Fit in the truth as centre in a circle.  That which can die, and that which dieth not,     Are nothing but the splendour of the idea     Which by his love our Lord brings into being;  Because that living Light, which from its fount     Effulgent flows, so that it disunites not     From Him nor from the Love in them intrined,  Through its own goodness reunites its rays     In nine subsistences, as in a mirror,     Itself eternally remaining One.  Thence it descends to the last potencies,     Downward from act to act becoming such     That only brief contingencies it makes;  And these contingencies I hold to be     Things generated, which the heaven produces     By its own motion, with seed and without.  Neither their wax, nor that which tempers it,     Remains immutable, and hence beneath     The ideal signet more and less shines through;  Therefore it happens, that the selfsame tree     After its kind bears worse and better fruit,     And ye are born with characters diverse.  If in perfection tempered were the wax,     And were the heaven in its supremest virtue,     The brilliance of the seal would all appear;  But nature gives it evermore deficient,     In the like manner working as the artist,     Who has the skill of art and hand that trembles.  If then the fervent Love, the Vision clear,     Of primal Virtue do dispose and seal,     Perfection absolute is there acquired.  Thus was of old the earth created worthy     Of all and every animal perfection;     And thus the Virgin was impregnate made;  So that thine own opinion I commend,     That human nature never yet has been,     Nor will be, what it was in those two persons.  Now if no farther forth I should proceed,     ‘Then in what way was he without a peer?’     Would be the first beginning of thy words.  But, that may well appear what now appears not,     Think who he was, and what occasion moved him     To make request, when it was told him, ‘Ask.’  I’ve not so spoken that thou canst not see     Clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom,     That he might be sufficiently a king;  ’Twas not to know the number in which are     The motors here above, or if ‘necesse’     With a contingent e’er ‘necesse’ make,  ‘Non si est dare primum motum esse,’     Or if in semicircle can be made     Triangle so that it have no right angle.  Whence, if thou notest this and what I said,     A regal prudence is that peerless seeing     In which the shaft of my intention strikes.  And if on ‘rose’ thou turnest thy clear eyes,     Thou’lt see that it has reference alone     To kings who’re many, and the good are rare.  With this distinction take thou what I said,     And thus it can consist with thy belief     Of the first father and of our Delight.  And lead shall this be always to thy feet,     To make thee, like a weary man, move slowly     Both to the Yes and No thou seest not;  For very low among the fools is he     Who affirms without distinction, or denies,     As well in one as in the other case;  Because it happens that full often bends     Current opinion in the false direction,     And then the feelings bind the intellect.  Far more than uselessly he leaves the shore,     (Since he returneth not the same he went,)     Who fishes for the truth, and has no skill;  And in the world proofs manifest thereof     Parmenides, Melissus, Brissus are,     And many who went on and knew not whither;  Thus did Sabellius, Arius, and those fools     Who have been even as swords unto the Scriptures     In rendering distorted their straight faces.  Nor yet shall people be too confident     In judging, even as he is who doth count     The corn in field or ever it be ripe.  For I have seen all winter long the thorn     First show itself intractable and fierce,     And after bear the rose upon its top;  And I have seen a ship direct and swift     Run o’er the sea throughout its course entire,     To perish at the harbour’s mouth at last.  Let not Dame Bertha nor Ser Martin think,     Seeing one steal, another offering make,     To see them in the arbitrament divine;  For one may rise, and fall the other may.”     Paradiso: Canto XIV   From centre unto rim, from rim to centre,     In a round vase the water moves itself,     As from without ’tis struck or from within.  Into my mind upon a sudden dropped     What I am saying, at the moment when     Silent became the glorious life of Thomas,  Because of the resemblance that was born     Of his discourse and that of Beatrice,     Whom, after him, it pleased thus to begin:  “This man has need (and does not tell you so,     Nor with the voice, nor even in his thought)     Of going to the root of one truth more.  Declare unto him if the light wherewith     Blossoms your substance shall remain with you     Eternally the same that it is now;  And if it do remain, say in what manner,     After ye are again made visible,     It can be that it injure not your sight.”  As by a greater gladness urged and drawn     They who are dancing in a ring sometimes     Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;  So, at that orison devout and prompt,     The holy circles a new joy displayed     In their revolving and their wondrous song.  Whoso lamenteth him that here we die     That we may live above, has never there     Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain.  The One and Two and Three who ever liveth,     And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,     Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing,  Three several times was chanted by each one     Among those spirits, with such melody     That for all merit it were just reward;  And, in the lustre most divine of all     The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice,     Such as perhaps the Angel’s was to Mary,  Answer: “As long as the festivity     Of Paradise shall be, so long our love     Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.  Its brightness is proportioned to the ardour,     The ardour to the vision; and the vision     Equals what grace it has above its worth.  When, glorious and sanctified, our flesh     Is reassumed, then shall our persons be     More pleasing by their being all complete;  For will increase whate’er bestows on us     Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme,     Light which enables us to look on Him;  Therefore the vision must perforce increase,     Increase the ardour which from that is kindled,     Increase the radiance which from this proceeds.  But even as a coal that sends forth flame,     And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it     So that its own appearance it maintains,  Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now     Shall be o’erpowered in aspect by the flesh,     Which still to-day the earth doth cover up;  Nor can so great a splendour weary us,     For strong will be the organs of the body     To everything which hath the power to please us.”  So sudden and alert appeared to me     Both one and the other choir to say Amen,     That well they showed desire for their dead bodies;  Nor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers,     The fathers, and the rest who had been dear     Or ever they became eternal flames.  And lo! all round about of equal brightness     Arose a lustre over what was there,     Like an horizon that is clearing up.  And as at rise of early eve begin     Along the welkin new "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1004"],["title","Divine Comedy, Longfellow's Translation, Complete (#0)"],["body","Divine Comedy      of Dante Alighieri      Translated by     HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW       Contents      INFERNO     Canto I.
