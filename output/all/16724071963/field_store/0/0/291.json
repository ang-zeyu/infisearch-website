I didn’t like the idea of hanging myself: I’d been with a party who found a man hanging in the Bush, and it was no place for a woman round where he was. And I’d helped drag two bodies out of the Cudgeegong river in a flood, and they weren’t sleeping beauties. I thought it was a pity that a chap couldn’t lie down on a grassy bank in a graceful position in the moonlight and die just by thinking of it--and die with his eyes and mouth shut. But then I remembered that I wouldn’t make a beautiful corpse, anyway it went, with the face I had on me.  I was just getting comfortably miserable when I heard a step behind me, and my heart gave a jump. And I gave a start too.  ‘Oh, is that you, Mr Wilson?’ said a timid little voice.  ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘Is that you, Mary?’  And she said yes. It was the first time I called her Mary, but she did not seem to notice it.  ‘Did I frighten you?’ I asked.  ‘No--yes--just a little,’ she said. ‘I didn’t know there was any one----’ then she stopped.  ‘Why aren’t you dancing?’ I asked her.  ‘Oh, I’m tired,’ she said. ‘It was too hot in the wool-shed. I thought I’d like to come out and get my head cool and be quiet a little while.’  ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘it must be hot in the wool-shed.’  She stood looking out over the willows. Presently she said, ‘It must be very dull for you, Mr Wilson--you must feel lonely. Mr Barnes said----’ Then she gave a little gasp and stopped--as if she was just going to put her foot in it.  ‘How beautiful the moonlight looks on the willows!’ she said.  ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘doesn’t it? Supposing we have a stroll by the river.’  ‘Oh, thank you, Mr Wilson. I’d like it very much.’  I didn’t notice it then, but, now I come to think of it, it was a beautiful scene: there was a horseshoe of high blue hills round behind the house, with the river running round under the slopes, and in front was a rounded hill covered with pines, and pine ridges, and a soft blue peak away over the ridges ever so far in the distance.  I had a handkerchief over the worst of my face, and kept the best side turned to her. We walked down by the river, and didn’t say anything for a good while. I was thinking hard. We came to a white smooth log in a quiet place out of sight of the house.  ‘Suppose we sit down for a while, Mary,’ I said.  ‘If you like, Mr Wilson,’ she said.  There was about a foot of log between us.  ‘What a beautiful night!’ she said.  ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘isn’t it?’  Presently she said, ‘I suppose you know I’m going away next month, Mr Wilson?’  I felt suddenly empty. ‘No,’ I said, ‘I didn’t know that.’  ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I thought you knew. I’m going to try and get into the hospital to be trained for a nurse, and if that doesn’t come off I’ll get a place as assistant public-school teacher.’  We didn’t say anything for a good while.  ‘I suppose you won’t be sorry to go, Miss Brand?’ I said.  ‘I--I don’t know,’ she said. ‘Everybody’s been so kind to me here.’  She sat looking straight before her, and I fancied her eyes glistened. I put my arm round her shoulders, but she didn’t seem to notice it. In fact, I scarcely noticed it myself at the time.  ‘So you think you’ll be sorry to go away?’ I said.  ‘Yes, Mr Wilson. I suppose I’ll fret for a while. It’s been my home, you know.’  I pressed my hand on her shoulder, just a little, so as she couldn’t pretend not to know it was there. But she didn’t seem to notice.  ‘Ah, well,’ I said, ‘I suppose I’ll be on the wallaby again next week.’  ‘Will you, Mr Wilson?’ she said. Her voice seemed very soft.  I slipped my arm round her waist, under her arm. My heart was going like clockwork now.  Presently she said--  ‘Don’t you think it’s time to go back now, Mr Wilson?’  ‘Oh, there’s plenty of time!’ I said. I shifted up, and put my arm farther round, and held her closer. She sat straight up, looking right in front of her, but she began to breathe hard.  ‘Mary,’ I said.  ‘Yes,’ she said.  ‘Call me Joe,’ I said.  ‘I--I don’t like to,’ she said. ‘I don’t think it would be right.’  So I just turned her face round and kissed her. She clung to me and cried.  ‘What is it, Mary?’ I asked.  She only held me tighter and cried.  ‘What is it, Mary?’ I said. ‘Ain’t you well? Ain’t you happy?’  ‘Yes, Joe,’ she said, ‘I’m very happy.’ Then she said, ‘Oh, your poor face! Can’t I do anything for it?’  ‘No,’ I said. ‘That’s all right. My face doesn’t hurt me a bit now.’  But she didn’t seem right.  ‘What is it, Mary?’ I said. ‘Are you tired? You didn’t sleep last night----’ Then I got an inspiration.  ‘Mary,’ I said, ‘what were you doing out with the gun this morning?’  And after some coaxing it all came out, a bit hysterical.  ‘I couldn’t sleep--I was frightened. Oh! I had such a terrible dream about you, Joe! I thought Romany came back and got into your room and stabbed you with his knife. I got up and dressed, and about daybreak I heard a horse at the gate; then I got the gun down from the wall--and--and Mr Barnes came round the corner and frightened me. He’s something like Romany, you know.’  Then I got as much of her as I could into my arms.  And, oh, but wasn’t I happy walking home with Mary that night! She was too little for me to put my arm round her waist, so I put it round her shoulder, and that felt just as good. I remember I asked her who’d cleaned up my room and washed my things, but she wouldn’t tell.  She wouldn’t go back to the dance yet; she said she’d go into her room and rest a while. There was no one near the old verandah; and when she stood on the end of the floor she was just on a level with my shoulder.  ‘Mary,’ I whispered, ‘put your arms round my neck and kiss me.’  She put her arms round my neck, but she didn’t kiss me; she only hid her face.  ‘Kiss me, Mary!’ I said.  ‘I--I don’t like to,’ she whispered.  ‘Why not, Mary?’  Then I felt her crying or laughing, or half crying and half laughing. I’m not sure to this day which it was.  ‘Why won’t you kiss me, Mary? Don’t you love me?’  ‘Because,’ she said, ‘because--because I--I don’t--I don’t think it’s right for--for a girl to--to kiss a man unless she’s going to be his wife.’  Then it dawned on me! I’d forgot all about proposing.  ‘Mary,’ I said, ‘would you marry a chap like me?’  And that was all right.       *****  Next morning Mary cleared out my room and sorted out my things, and didn’t take the slightest notice of the other girls’ astonishment.  But she made me promise to speak to old Black, and I did the same evening. I found him sitting on the log by the fence, having a yarn on the quiet with an old Bushman; and when the old Bushman got up and went away, I sat down.  ‘Well, Joe,’ said Black, ‘I see somebody’s been spoiling your face for the dance.’ And after a bit he said, ‘Well, Joe, what is it? Do you want another job? If you do, you’ll have to ask Mrs Black, or Bob’ (Bob was his eldest son); ‘they’re managing the station for me now, you know.’ He could be bitter sometimes in his quiet way.  ‘No,’ I said; ‘it’s not that, Boss.’  ‘Well, what is it, Joe?’  ‘I--well the fact is, I want little Mary.’  He puffed at his pipe for a long time, then I thought he spoke.  ‘What did you say, Boss?’ I said.  ‘Nothing, Joe,’ he said. ‘I was going to say a lot, but it wouldn’t be any use. My father used to say a lot to me before I was married.’  I waited a good while for him to speak.  ‘Well, Boss,’ I said, ‘what about Mary?’  ‘Oh! I suppose that’s all right, Joe,’ he said. ‘I--I beg your pardon. I got thinking of the days when I was courting Mrs Black.’     Brighten’s Sister-In-Law.   Jim was born on Gulgong, New South Wales. We used to say ‘on’ Gulgong--and old diggers still talked of being ‘on th’ Gulgong’--though the goldfield there had been worked out for years, and the place was only a dusty little pastoral town in the scrubs. Gulgong was about the last of the great alluvial ‘rushes’ of the ‘roaring days’--and dreary and dismal enough it looked when I was there. The expression ‘on’ came from being on the ‘diggings’ or goldfield--the workings or the goldfield was all underneath, of course, so we lived (or starved) ON them--not in nor at ‘em.  Mary and I had been married about two years when Jim came----His name wasn’t ‘Jim’, by the way, it was ‘John Henry’, after an uncle godfather; but we called him Jim from the first--(and before it)--because Jim was a popular Bush name, and most of my old mates were Jims. The Bush is full of good-hearted scamps called Jim.  We lived in an old weather-board shanty that had been a sly-grog-shop, and the Lord knows what else! in the palmy days of Gulgong; and I did a bit of digging [‘fossicking’, rather), a bit of shearing, a bit of fencing, a bit of Bush-carpentering, tank-sinking,--anything, just to keep the billy boiling.  We had a lot of trouble with Jim with his teeth. He was bad with every one of them, and we had most of them lanced--couldn’t pull him through without. I remember we got one lanced and the gum healed over before the tooth came through, and we had to get it cut again. He was a plucky little chap, and after the first time he never whimpered when the doctor was lancing his gum: he used to say ‘tar’ afterwards, and want to bring the lance home with him.  The first turn we got with Jim was the worst. I had had the wife and Jim out camping with me in a tent at a dam I was making at Cattle Creek; I had two men working for me, and a boy to drive one of the tip-drays, and I took Mary out to cook for us. And it was lucky for us that the contract was finished and we got back to Gulgong, and within reach of a doctor, the day we did. We were just camping in the house, with our goods and chattels anyhow, for the night; and we were hardly back home an hour when Jim took convulsions for the first time.  Did you ever see a child in convulsions? You wouldn’t want to see it again: it plays the devil with a man’s nerves. I’d got the beds fixed up on the floor, and the billies on the fire--I was going to make"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1036"],["title","Joe Wilson and His Mates (#7)"],["body"," tea, and put a piece of corned beef on to boil over night--when Jim (he’d been queer all day, and his mother was trying to hush him to sleep)--Jim, he screamed out twice. He’d been crying a good deal, and I was dog-tired and worried (over some money a man owed me) or I’d have noticed at once that there was something unusual in the way the child cried out: as it was I didn’t turn round till Mary screamed ‘Joe! Joe!’ You know how a woman cries out when her child is in danger or dying--short, and sharp, and terrible. ‘Joe! Look! look! Oh, my God! our child! Get the bath, quick! quick! it’s convulsions!’  Jim was bent back like a bow, stiff as a bullock-yoke, in his mother’s arms, and his eyeballs were turned up and fixed--a thing I saw twice afterwards, and don’t want ever to see again.  I was falling over things getting the tub and the hot water, when the woman who lived next door rushed in. She called to her husband to run for the doctor, and before the doctor came she and Mary had got Jim into a hot bath and pulled him through.  The neighbour woman made me up a shake-down in another room, and stayed with Mary that night; but it was a long while before I got Jim and Mary’s screams out of my head and fell asleep.  You may depend I kept the fire in, and a bucket of water hot over it, for a good many nights after that; but (it always happens like this) there came a night, when the fright had worn off, when I was too tired to bother about the fire, and that night Jim took us by surprise. Our wood-heap was done, and I broke up a new chair to get a fire, and had to run a quarter of a mile for water; but this turn wasn’t so bad as the first, and we pulled him through.  You never saw a child in convulsions? Well, you don’t want to. It must be only a matter of seconds, but it seems long minutes; and half an hour afterwards the child might be laughing and playing with you, or stretched out dead. It shook me up a lot. I was always pretty high-strung and sensitive. After Jim took the first fit, every time he cried, or turned over, or stretched out in the night, I’d jump: I was always feeling his forehead in the dark to see if he was feverish, or feeling his limbs to see if he was ‘limp’ yet. Mary and I often laughed about it--afterwards. I tried sleeping in another room, but for nights after Jim’s first attack I’d be just dozing off into a sound sleep, when I’d hear him scream, as plain as could be, and I’d hear Mary cry, ‘Joe!--Joe!’--short, sharp, and terrible--and I’d be up and into their room like a shot, only to find them sleeping peacefully. Then I’d feel Jim’s head and his breathing for signs of convulsions, see to the fire and water, and go back to bed and try to sleep. For the first few nights I was like that all night, and I’d feel relieved when daylight came. I’d be in first thing to see if they were all right; then I’d sleep till dinner-time if it was Sunday or I had no work. But then I was run down about that time: I was worried about some money for a wool-shed I put up and never got paid for; and, besides, I’d been pretty wild before I met Mary.  I was fighting hard then--struggling for something better. Both Mary and I were born to better things, and that’s what made the life so hard for us.  Jim got on all right for a while: we used to watch him well, and have his teeth lanced in time.  It used to hurt and worry me to see how--just as he was getting fat and rosy and like a natural happy child, and I’d feel proud to take him out--a tooth would come along, and he’d get thin and white and pale and bigger-eyed and old-fashioned. We’d say, ‘He’ll be safe when he gets his eye-teeth’: but he didn’t get them till he was two; then, ‘He’ll be safe when he gets his two-year-old teeth’: they didn’t come till he was going on for three.  He was a wonderful little chap--Yes, I know all about parents thinking that their child is the best in the world. If your boy is small for his age, friends will say that small children make big men; that he’s a very bright, intelligent child, and that it’s better to have a bright, intelligent child than a big, sleepy lump of fat. And if your boy is dull and sleepy, they say that the dullest boys make the cleverest men--and all the rest of it. I never took any notice of that sort of clatter--took it for what it was worth; but, all the same, I don’t think I ever saw such a child as Jim was when he turned two. He was everybody’s favourite. They spoilt him rather. I had my own ideas about bringing up a child. I reckoned Mary was too soft with Jim. She’d say, ‘Put that’ (whatever it was) ‘out of Jim’s reach, will you, Joe?’ and I’d say, ‘No! leave it there, and make him understand he’s not to have it. Make him have his meals without any nonsense, and go to bed at a regular hour,’ I’d say. Mary and I had many a breeze over Jim. She’d say that I forgot he was only a baby: but I held that a baby could be trained from the first week; and I believe I was right.  But, after all, what are you to do? You’ll see a boy that was brought up strict turn out a scamp; and another that was dragged up anyhow (by the hair of the head, as the saying is) turn out well. Then, again, when a child is delicate--and you might lose him any day--you don’t like to spank him, though he might be turning out a little fiend, as delicate children often do. Suppose you gave a child a hammering, and the same night he took convulsions, or something, and died--how’d you feel about it? You never know what a child is going to take, any more than you can tell what some women are going to say or do.  I was very fond of Jim, and we were great chums. Sometimes I’d sit and wonder what the deuce he was thinking about, and often, the way he talked, he’d make me uneasy. When he was two he wanted a pipe above all things, and I’d get him a clean new clay and he’d sit by my side, on the edge of the verandah, or on a log of the wood-heap, in the cool of the evening, and suck away at his pipe, and try to spit when he saw me do it. He seemed to understand that a cold empty pipe wasn’t quite the thing, yet to have the sense to know that he couldn’t smoke tobacco yet: he made the best he could of things. And if he broke a clay pipe he wouldn’t have a new one, and there’d be a row; the old one had to be mended up, somehow, with string or wire. If I got my hair cut, he’d want his cut too; and it always troubled him to see me shave--as if he thought there must be something wrong somewhere, else he ought to have to be shaved too. I lathered him one day, and pretended to shave him: he sat through it as solemn as an owl, but didn’t seem to appreciate it--perhaps he had sense enough to know that it couldn’t possibly be the real thing. He felt his face, looked very hard at the lather I scraped off, and whimpered, ‘No blood, daddy!’  I used to cut myself a good deal: I was always impatient over shaving.  Then he went in to interview his mother about it. She understood his lingo better than I did.  But I wasn’t always at ease with him. Sometimes he’d sit looking into the fire, with his head on one side, and I’d watch him and wonder what he was thinking about (I might as well have wondered what a Chinaman was thinking about) till he seemed at least twenty years older than me: sometimes, when I moved or spoke, he’d glance round just as if to see what that old fool of a dadda of his was doing now.  I used to have a fancy that there was something Eastern, or Asiatic--something older than our civilisation or religion--about old-fashioned children. Once I started to explain my idea to a woman I thought would understand--and as it happened she had an old-fashioned child, with very slant eyes--a little tartar he was too. I suppose it was the sight of him that unconsciously reminded me of my infernal theory, and set me off on it, without warning me. Anyhow, it got me mixed up in an awful row with the woman and her husband--and all their tribe. It wasn’t an easy thing to explain myself out of it, and the row hasn’t been fixed up yet. There were some Chinamen in the district.  I took a good-size fencing contract, the frontage of a ten-mile paddock, near Gulgong, and did well out of it. The railway had got as far as the Cudgeegong river--some twenty miles from Gulgong and two hundred from the coast--and ‘carrying’ was good then. I had a couple of draught-horses, that I worked in the tip-drays when I was tank-sinking, and one or two others running in the Bush. I bought a broken-down waggon cheap, tinkered it up myself--christened it ‘The Same Old Thing’--and started carrying from the railway terminus through Gulgong and along the bush roads and tracks that branch out fanlike through the scrubs to the one-pub towns and sheep and cattle stations out there in the howling wilderness. It wasn’t much of a team. There were the two heavy horses for ‘shafters’; a stunted colt, that I’d bought out of the pound for thirty shillings; a light, spring-cart horse; an old grey mare, with points like a big red-and-white Australian store bullock, and with the grit of an old washerwoman to work; and a horse that had spanked along in Cob & Co.’s mail-coach in his time. I had a couple there that didn’t belong to me: I worked them for the feeding of them in the dry weather. And I had all sorts of harness, that I mended and fixed up myself. It was a mixed team, but I took light stuff, got through pretty quick, and freight rates were high. So I got along.  Before this, whenever I made a few pounds I’d sink a shaft somewhere, prospecting for gold; but Mary never let me rest till she talked me out of that.  I made up my mind to take on a small selection farm--that an old mate of mine had fenced in and cleared, and afterwards chucked up--about thirty miles out west of Gulgong, at a place called Lahey’s Creek. (The places were all called Lahey’s Creek, or Spicer’s Flat, or Murphy’s Flat, or Ryan’s Crossing, or some such name--round there.) I reckoned I’d have a run for the horses and be able"]]]
