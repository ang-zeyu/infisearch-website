When we got back, he said he had been talking with a man who had a little steam yacht and would tow us as far as Catskill Landing. He said it wouldn't cost anything, because anyway he was going up through Lake Champlain and Lake George and he was strong for the Boy Scouts. You hear lots of men say that. But, one thing, he wasn't going for two days and so we'd have to stay tied up in Poughkeepsie waiting for him. You see we were a kind of a tramp boat, but what did we care as long as we got to camp some time or other. Scouts are tramps anyway, hey?  So now I have to tell you about that two days we spent in Poughkeepsie and most of the time we spent in teaching Skinny to swim. Of course, that was up to the Elks and you can bet I didn't interfere, nor any of my patrol either, but I was mighty glad to see how easy it was for him to learn.  [Illustration: MOST OF THE TIME WAS SPENT IN TEACHING SKINNY TO SWIM.]  \"That kid is half fish,\" Doc Carson said to me.  \"No wonder,\" I said, \"most all his life has been spent in the marshes. He's going to be a cracker-jack, you see.\"  \"He'll walk away with that badge when he once gets started,\" Westy said.  \"You mean he'll swim away with it,\" I said; \"gee-williger, look how that little codger can dive.\"  One thing, there was a dandy place for learning, that's sure.  We put the skiff into the water and a couple of the Elks rowed around near the house-boat, keeping near, while Hunt Ward showed Skinny the strokes. The rest of us sat along the cabin roof, cheering just so's the kid would be encouraged. He looked awfully thin and little in his bathing suit and whenever he climbed up to the deck of the house-boat the wet cloth stuck tight to him and made him look, oh, I don't know, kind of like a marsh rat, as you may say. That's what he always said people called him, a _swamp rat_, and I guess he was even kind of proud of it.  One sure thing, he was game. And he was just the same in learning to swim as he was in everything else; he got all excited and wanted to go too fast. As soon as he got the hang of it and could manage a few strokes, _good night_, he wanted to swim across the river. He started right off before the fellows in the boat noticed him and was heading across stream. Two or three times we heard him sputtering and shouting, \"_Now can I have that badge?_\"  Late that afternoon they let him dive off the deck. It was low and it didn't make much of a dive. Of course, he didn't dive right, he only just jumped and went kerflop into the water, and he had us all laughing. As soon as he found out how much fun it was, he kept climbing up and splashing into the water again; oh, boy, it was as good as a circus to see him. Then he'd go swimming to the skiff and climb in just like a little eel, and sit there shivering.  You can bet that kid is going to have the swimming badge all right, we all said; the trouble is going to be to hold him back. And we were right, too, because when he came up on the cabin roof to get dry, all of a sudden, before any of us knew it, he was over at the edge and dived off before Mr. Ellsworth had a chance to call to him. That was sure too much of a dive for a beginner, for if he hit the water face down and flat, _good night_, that might have been the end of him. The skiff was hauled up then so Hunt Ward dived in after him, but he had to swim some to catch him and it was mighty funny to see them.  That night Mr. Ellsworth gave Skinny a good lecture and told him he mustn't do things like that until he was told to, but I guess Skinny didn't understand. When I saw Mr, Ellsworth sitting alone on the deck after dark, I went up and sat down and began talking to him. I often do that.  I said, \"I guess Skinny's going to get the swimming badge, all right.\"  \"Yes, I guess he is,\" that's what Mr. Ellsworth said, \"Skinny's too much for me. If the boys would only teach him a little scouting, I'd be better pleased. He wants to be a swimmer now; he's not thinking about being a scout. He thinks of the badge only as something to wear.\"  \"I tried to teach him some things out of the Handbook,\" I said, \"but the Elks didn't like it. I tried to tell him some things about scouting and all I got was a good lecture from Connie. Nix on teaching fellows in other patrols.\"  Mr. Ellsworth seemed awfully worried, kind of; he just sat thinking a minute. Then he said, \"I'm afraid Skinny is going to be hard to tame. He'll make a fine swimmer and a fine stalker--\"  I said, \"He calls that sneaking.\"  Mr. Ellsworth laughed and said, \"But the principal thing is to make him a good scout. Has he done any good turns?\"  I said, \"The only good turns I know about, are the good turns he made in diving; he turns every which way.\"  \"Well, I hope he can forget about swimming long enough to eat his supper,\" Mr. Ellsworth said.  But just the same Skinny didn't.    CHAPTER X  TELLS ABOUT SKINNY AND THE ELKS  Well, that was the way it was with Skinny and I could see that the Elks were rushing him through, so that he'd get the badge. That used to be one trouble with the Elks and I don't care if they do know I said it. They got one good lesson to cure them, that's sure. The trouble with them was they were making a collection of badges and when you're out for badges, you skip at lot of pages in the Handbook, that's sure.  The next day I said to Connie Bennett--this is just what I said; I said, \"I hope you won't get mad at me again if I say something about Skinny, because, anyway, it's none of _my_ business, that's sure. But as long as you fellows are busy teaching him stunts and things, I don't see that there would be any harm in it, if I read some things in the Handbook to him--some other kind of things, I mean.\"  He said, \"What kind of things?\"  \"Oh, just about the laws and things like that, like about being honest and obedient--you know.\"  \"You keep your hands off my patrol,\" that's just what he said; \"and you needn't start hinting that the Elks are dishonest--\"  \"Who's hinting that?\" I said, kind of mad; \"you remind me of an airplane, you're always going up in the air.\"  \"If any of my patrol are dishonest, they'll be thrown out,\" he said, \"and maybe they'll be welcome in the Silver Foxes.\"  \"Sure,\" I said, \"we make a specialty of burglars and pickpockets; we eat 'em alive. All I was asking you was that you let me teach Skinny some of the 'idea' stuff--you know what I mean.\"  \"You're jealous because he's a genius,\" Connie said; \"and you want to fill him up with grandmother stuff. Why don't you let the kid alone? We'll take care of him.\"  \"All right,\" I said; \"I should worry. Only there's no use getting mad; we're all one troop.\"  \"Yes, but we're three separate patrols,\" he said.  \"United we stand, divided we sprawl,\" I said. Then he walked away. That was the second day at Poughkeepsie and most all day the Elks were busy turning Skinny into a fish. Some of the rest of us went up to Metzger's Candy Store to get some jaw-breakers. Did you ever eat those? Pee-wee was quiet for an hour munching one. The licorice ones are best. In the afternoon we sat along the cabin roof watching Skinny and the Elks. Good night, you should have seen that kid! Every time the fellows in the boat had to row after him, because he'd go swimming away on his own hook. He never paid any attention to what they told him.  \"Throw him a jaw-breaker,\" Grove Bronson said; \"just for fun.\"  \"Nix,\" I said; \"you don't catch me interfering with the buzz-saw. Twice was enough. When I try any polishing, I'll polish up the Silver Foxes.\"  \"Go ahead, throw him one,\" Grove said to Pee-wee. But I guess Pee-wee didn't have any jawbreakers to spare. His cheeks were sticking out and there was licorice all over his lips, and he said--this is the way it sounded: \"I--ooo--go--to--goo--to--are--\" something like that, honest.  \"Go in and wash your face,\" Doc said; \"you look like a minstrel actor in a rainstorm.\"  \"Yu--sht--p--m--nd--r--n--business.\" Pee-wee blurted out. Crackey, I thought I'd die.  Pretty soon Doc Carson (he's a Raven) threw a jaw-breaker out into the water and Skinny got it before it went down.  \"What do you know about that little water snake,\" El Sawyer said. Then he shouted, \"Bully for you, Skinny!\"  I said, \"You'd better look out, you'll get yourself in trouble.\"  \"What do I care for the Elks?\" he said.  \"That's all right,\" I said; \"Connie's got Skinny copyrighted, all rights reserved.\"  Then, all of a sudden, Wig Weigand shouted, \"Look at that, will you? Look!\"  We could just see Hunt Ward reach out of the skiff for Skinny, when all of a sudden he disappeared and came up about twenty feet from the skiff. Everybody began laughing and I guess the Elks were mad, because they thought we were just sitting up there kidding them.  Right then I heard Mr. Ellsworth calling out from just in back of us, \"Take him in the skiff and bring him aboard, Huntley.\"  \"Now--e--ng--t--gt--cld--down,\" Pee-wee said, munching away on a jaw breaker.  \"You look as if you'd been gargling a bottle of ink,\" I told him. \"Don't talk, you can't do two things at once.\"  Pretty soon Skinny came up the ladder to the cabin roof where we were all sitting. His wet bathing suit stuck to him and it made him look terribly thin, and his hair was all streaked and the water was dripping from his face. But anyway, his eyes were bright and all excited--I never saw another fellow that had eyes like that. He had the piece of candy in his hand and it was all melting from the water and his hand was black and sticky. Jiminy, he looked awful small and skinny alongside of Mr. Ellsworth, and I had to feel sorry for him as soon as Mr. Ellsworth began to speak.  Skinny looked up at him and said, \"I got it--I dived and got it--see--I saved it--I didn't eat it. I can swim under the water. Now can I have the badge?\" Cracky, the way he stared, if I'd had the badge, I'd have torn it off my arm and handed it to him, honest I would.  Mr. Ellsworth just looked at him and said, \"No, you may"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10316"],["title","Roy Blakeley's Adventures in Camp (#7)"],["body","have the badge. Before you can have the badge for swimming you must be a better scout. You must learn to be obedient. You heard one of your patrol tell you not to go under water. You heard your patrol leader tell you to get into the skiff. Do you think you know better than they do, what is best for you?\"  Even still he didn't pay any attention, he was so excited. \"Now am I a hero?\" he said.  \"No, you are not a hero,\" Mr. Ellsworth told him; \"and you will go inside and get your uniform on. The first duty of a scout is to obey his leader, and you have failed to do that. You are very much mistaken as to the meaning of heroism, and it wasn't necessary to bring us any proof that you got the candy or whatever that is. Scouts are not in the habit of lying and deceiving. We expect always to believe you without proof. Throw that away and go inside and get your clothes on.\"  Gee, maybe he was right, but anyway, I felt mighty sorry for Skinny. His eyes were all full of tears and he went over to the rail and threw the sticky jaw-breaker out into the water. I I could see by his neck that he was gulping and trying not to cry and, oh, boy, it made me feel bad. It seemed as if it was always that way with him--that he had to be disappointed and that things never came out right with him. Anyway, I said to myself, it's Connie's fault, and all the rest of the Elks are to blame, too. Why didn't they tell him in the beginning about those other things. All they cared about was showing their new member off to the rest of the troop, and you see how it ended.  First I thought I'd go in and talk to Skinny and tell him he was a wonder, for that was just what he was, and Mr. Ellsworth knew it, too. Then I decided that I'd better not on account of Connie. And anyway, I wouldn't have any right to go in and spoil what our scoutmaster said, would I?    CHAPTER XI  TELLS YOU HOW TO GET TO TEMPLE CAMP  Gee whiz, I wouldn't say anything against the Elks, that's sure, because they're all peachy scouts when you come right down to it, but I have to admit that they're crazy about stunts. They have more merit badges in their patrol than there are in the Ravens and Silver Foxes put together. Hunt Ward's sleeve looks like one of those Indian totem poles, there are so many badges on it. Anyway, I should worry, we have twenty-two badges in our patrol, and more good turns in the troop book than either of the other patrols. That's what counts, too--good turns.  The trouble with the Elks was that every time they got a new fellow, he must take a header for some badge or other and most always he would have two or three stunt badges (that's merit badges, you know) waiting for him when he passed his first class tests. \"Begin at the beginning,\" that's what Mr. Ellsworth always said, and he says it's more important to know the scout oath and follow it, than it is to get the eagle, award. Connie's a good patrol leader all right; gee, nobody can say he isn't, but he's crazy about stunts and merit badges. He always seemed to think that that was all there was to scouting. But believe me, there's many a girl wears a sailor hat who screams when she gets in a boat. Anyway, I'm not going to be knocking anybody.  Well, the next day in the middle of the night--I mean the next night early in the morning--I mean when it was just getting light, after the night after the next day--we got to Catskill Landing, and oh, boy! wasn't I glad! We tied the houseboat to an old pier maybe a couple of hundred yards above the regular landing, and had a good swim and then breakfast before we started up to camp. Mr. Ellsworth let Skinny go in, but he told him to be careful not to disobey his leaders or he'd have to come out.  Jimmy, it was funny to see that kid. I don't know how to tell you about it, but he seemed to kind of swim different from the other fellows, and he couldn't help getting excited. They threw pieces of stick for him to get, and he would swim out and bring them in in his mouth just like a dog, and then wait for more, all anxious like. One thing about Skinny I noticed, and that was that all the fellows, even in his own patrol, got a lot of fun out of him, making him do things, but nobody exactly seemed to make friends with him. Anyway, I guess he didn't care, he was always so crazy about what he was doing. Even a lot of summer people stood around on the shore, watching him in the water and saying he was a wonder. I guess they didn't know what to do with themselves, hey? Mostly that's the way it is with summer people.  I flopped some flapjacks for breakfast and El Sawyer (he's a Raven) hung one of them around his neck for a souvenir. He's a fresh kid. Maybe you think it's easy to flop flapjacks--I should worry.  Oh, boy, now comes the best part of this whole story. As soon as we could get our stuff into the duffel bags and the boat all tied fast, we started out on our hike for Temple Camp. You can bet I always like to hike, but early in the morning, oh, it's simply great. Some fellows can drink sodas early in the morning but I can't, but anyway, early hikes are my middle name. You know, just when the sun is coming up, all red like, and peeking over the hill, just as if it was stalking.  Oh, boy, if scouts could only sneak up as quiet as all that!  Now the way you get to Temple Camp is to hike up through Catskill village till you get to the old turnpike road, and then go straight along that till you come to a big boarding house, where there are a lot of people sitting on the porch waiting for breakfast or dinner or supper, or time to go to bed. Then you hit the road up through the woods till you come to a turtle. I guess he isn't there now, but anyway, he was there last year. Then you cut up through the woods and follow the scouts' signs, and you'll come out at Leeds--that's a village. You'll see all the summer people waiting for their mail at the post office. Some of them will say, \"Oh, there go some boy scouts, aren't they cute?\" They always say that. There's a stationery store there too, where you can buy fishhooks and marshmallows, and other things to eat. I don't mean you eat fishhooks.  Anyway, you go down Main Street till you come to a smell like rotten wood and then you turn in where the willow trees are and you come to an old sawmill. If you holloa from there, they can hear you at camp. Then you cut through the woods and follow the trail till all of a sudden you come plunk out on the edge of the lake and it's all surrounded by woods. That's Black Lake, and believe me, black is my favorite color when it comes to lakes. Then you go across in the boats to Temple Camp.  Mr. John Temple started Temple Camp. He's rich and owns a lot of railroads and things. He used to be mad at the scouts, but after a while when he saw what kind of fellows scouts are, he got glad at them and started Temple Camp. He's awful grouchy when you first see him, but you should worry about that. Once, when he was out west about some railroads, he saw Jeb Rushmore, who was a trapper and all that, and he was getting old, so Mr. Temple made him come to Temple Camp to be camp manager and live there. Oh, boy, you're going to see him in just a minute and I can hardly wait.    CHAPTER XII  TELLS ALL ABOUT OUR ROW ON BLACK LAKE  So that's the way we went to Temple Camp, but there are short cuts to the Hudson besides that When we got near to the lake we all got anxious--you know how a fellow is when he's almost to a place he's been thinking about a lot.  Doc Carson said, \"I see the water is still wet.\" That was just to jolly Pee-wee.  \"That's because of the recent rains,\" I said.  \"The which?\" Artie asked me.  \"You think you're smart talking about _recent rains,_ don't you?\" Pee-wee shouted. \"You got that out of a book.\"  \"I bet there'll be a lot of troops there this summer,\" El Sawyer said.  Pretty soon I saw he was right, too, because five boats came across to get us and there was a strange scout in every single one of them. Uncle Jeb was waiting at the landing on the other side to meet us, and oh, cracky, didn't it look good to see the big pavilion and the tents and patrol cabins upside down in the water. There were a lot of scouts waiting too, and I could see the camp was pretty full.  Uncle Jeb said, \"Wall, Roay\"--that's just the way he talks, slow like; \"haow's all the boys from Bridgeboro? I reckon little Pee-wee ain't growed at all. Hain't you never goin' ter grow, Pee-wee? And Artie and Grovey, and El, and Hunter Ward and, let's see, Vic Norris--every plaguy one of yer here. Ain't none of yer died or gone off ter war, hey? And there's Connover Bennett, too, large as life, and still crazy about raisin cake, I reckon. Wall, wall, it's good ter see ye all.\"  I said, \"It's good to see you, too, Uncle Jeb, gee, all the fellows were crazy to see you, that's one sure thing.\"  \"And still making them flapjacks, hey?\" he said; \"I remember when one uv them New Hampshire scouts scaled one uv them flapjacks uv your'n across the lake. I reckon you're the same old Roay that put the mosquito dope in the biscuits. Yer remember that?\" Cracky, I'm not going to tell you anything about my past life, but summer before last up there--_oh, boy!_  Most of the morning we rested up and got our patrol cabins cleaned out and all fixed up, and in the afternoon we banged around and got acquainted with some of the new troops.  Just before supper, Westy and I went down for a swim and there were Connie Bennett and two or three of the Elks diving with Skinny. A whole lot of fellows were standing around watching. Most of them laughed at Skinny, but they all had to admit he was a crackerjack. I knew the Elks were just kind of showing him off and putting him through a lot of freak stunts just to get their name up around the camp.  After supper, Westy and I and a new fellow in an Ohio troop were rowing around near the shore. He was an awful nice fellow--quiet like--just like me, only different. All of a sudden we noticed Skinny"]]]
