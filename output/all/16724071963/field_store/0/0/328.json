The Whites lived happily and in peace upon their estates, and the Negroes continued to work for them_.\" Now Toussaint came into power, being general-in-chief of the armies of St. Domingo, a little before the end of the year 1796, and remained in power till the year 1802, or till the invasion of the island by the French expedition of Buonaparte under Leclerc. Malenfant means therefore to state, that from the latter end of 1796 to 1802, a period of six years, the planters or farmers kept possession of their estates; that they lived upon them, and that they lived upon them peaceably, that is, without interruption or disturbance from any one; and, finally, that the Negroes, though they had been all set free, continued to be their labourers. Can there be any account more favourable to our views than this, after so sudden an emancipation.  I may appeal next to General Lacroix, who published his \"Memoirs for a History of St. Domingo,\" at Paris, in 1819. He informs us, that when Santhonax, who had been recalled to France by the Government there, returned to the colony in 1796, \"_he was astonished at the state in which he found it on his return_.\" This, says Lacroix[10], \"was owing to Toussaint, who, while he had succeeded in establishing perfect order and discipline among the black troops, had succeeded also in making the black labourers return to the plantations, there to resume the drudgery of cultivation.\"  But the same author tells us, that in the next year (1797) the most wonderful progress had been made in agriculture. He uses these remarkable words: \"_The colony_,\" says he[11], \"_marched, as by enchantment, towards its ancient splendour; cultivation prospered; every day produced perceptible proofs of its progress. The city of the Cape and the plantations of the North rose up again visibly to the eye_.\" Now I am far from wishing to attribute all this wonderful improvement, this daily visible progress in agriculture, to the mere act of the emancipation of the slaves in St. Domingo. I know that many other circumstances which I could specify, if I had room, contributed towards its growth; but I must be allowed to maintain, that unless the Negroes, who were then free, _had done their part as labourers_, both by working regularly and industriously, and by obeying the directions of their superintendants or masters, the colony could never have gone on, as relates to cultivation, with the rapidity described.  The next witness to whom I shall appeal, is the estimable General Vincent, who lives now at Paris, though at an advanced age. Vincent was a colonel, and afterwards a general of brigade of artillery in St. Domingo. He was stationed there during the time both of Santhonax and Toussaint. He was also a proprietor of estates in the island. He was the man who planned the renovation of its agriculture after the abolition of slavery, and one of the great instruments in bringing it to the perfection mentioned by Lacroix. In the year 1801, he was called upon by Toussaint to repair to Paris, to lay before the Directory the new constitution, which had been agreed upon in St. Domingo. He obeyed the summons. It happened, that he arrived in France just at the moment of the peace of Amiens; here he found, to his inexpressible surprise and grief, that Buonaparte was preparing an immense armament, to be commanded by Leclerc, for the purpose of _restoring slavery in St. Domingo_. He lost no time in seeing the First Consul, and he had the courage to say at this interview what, perhaps, no other man in France would have dared to say at this particular moment. He remonstrated against the expedition; he told him to his face, that though the army destined for this purpose was composed of the brilliant conquerors of Europe, it could do nothing in the Antilles. It would most assuredly be destroyed by the climate of St. Domingo, even though it should be doubtful, whether it would not be destroyed by the Blacks. He stated, as another argument against the expedition, that it was totally unnecessary, and therefore criminal; for that every thing _was going on well_ in St. Domingo. _The proprietors were in peaceable possession of their estates; cultivation was making a rapid progress; the Blacks were industrious, and beyond example happy_. He conjured him, therefore, in the name of humanity, not to reverse this beautiful state of things. But alas! his efforts were ineffectual. The die had been cast: and the only reward, which he received from Buonaparte for his manly and faithful representations, was banishment to the Isle of Elba.  Having carried my examination into the conduct of the Negroes after their liberation to 1802, or to the invasion of the island by Leclerc, I must now leave a blank for nearly two years, or till the year 1804. It cannot be expected during a war, in which every man was called to arms to defend his own personal liberty, and that of every individual of his family, that we should see plantations cultivated as quietly as before, or even cultivated at all. But this was not the fault of _the emancipated Negroes_, but of _their former masters_. It was owing to the prejudices of the latter, that this frightful invasion took place; prejudices, indeed, common to all planters, where slavery obtains, from the very nature of their situation, and upon which I have made my observations in a former place. Accustomed to the use of arbitrary power, they could no longer brook the loss of their whips. Accustomed again to look down upon the Negroes as an inferior race of beings, or as the reptiles of the earth, they could not bear, peaceably as these had conducted themselves, to come into that familiar contact with them, as _free labourers_, which the change of their situation required. They considered them, too, as property lost, but which was to be recovered. In an evil hour, they prevailed upon Buonaparte, by false representations and _promises of pecuniary support_, to restore things to their former state. The hellish expedition at length arrived upon the shores of St. Domingo:--a scene of blood and torture followed, _such as history had never before disclosed_, and compared with which, _though planned and executed by Whites[12]_, all the barbarities said to have been perpetrated by the _insurgent Blacks_ of the North, _amount comparatively to nothing_. In fine, the French were driven from the island. Till that time, the planters retained their property, and then it was, but not till then, that they lost their all; it cannot, therefore, be expected, as I have said before, that I should have any thing to say in favour of the industry or good order of the emancipated Negroes, _during such a convulsive period_.  In the year 1804, Dessalines was proclaimed emperor of this fine territory. Here I resume the thread of my history, (though it will be but for a moment,) in order that I may follow it to its end. In process of time, the black troops, containing the Negroes in question, were disbanded, except such as were retained for the peace-establishment of the army. They, who were disbanded, returned to cultivation. As they were free when they became soldiers, so they continued to be free when they became labourers again. From that time to this, there has been no want of subordination or industry among them. They or their descendants are the persons, by whom the plains and valleys of St. Domingo _are still cultivated_, and they are reported to follow their occupations still, and with _as fair a character_ as other free labourers in any other quarter of the globe.  We have now seen, that the emancipated Negroes never abused their liberty, from the year 1793 (the era of their general emancipation) to the present day, a period of _thirty_ years. An important question then seems to force itself upon us, \"What were the measures taken after so frightful an event, as that of emancipation, to secure the tranquillity and order which has been described, or to rescue the planters and the colony from ruin?\" I am bound to answer this, if I can, were it only to gratify the curiosity of my readers; but more particularly when I consider, that if emancipation should ever be in contemplation in our own colonies, it will be desirable to have all the light possible upon that subject, and particularly of precedent or example. It appears then, that the two commissioners, Santhonax and Polverel, aware of the mischief which might attend their decrees, were obliged to take the best measures they could devise to prevent it. One of their first steps was to draw up a short code of rules to be observed upon the plantations. These rules were printed and made public. They were also ordered to be read aloud to all the Negroes upon every estate, for which purpose the latter were to be assembled at a particular hour once a week. The preamble to these regulations insisted upon _the necessity of working, without which everything would go to ruin_. Among the articles, the two the most worthy of our notice were, that the labourers were to be obliged to hire themselves to their masters for _not less than a year_, at the end of which (September), but not before, they might quit their service, and engage with others; and that they were to receive _a third part_ of the produce of the estate, as a recompense for their labour. These two were _fundamental_ articles. As to the minor, they were not alike upon every estate. This code of the commissioners subsisted for about three years.  Toussaint, when he came into power, reconsidered this subject, and adopted a code of rules of his own. His first object was to prevent oppression on the part of the master or employer, and yet to secure obedience on the part of the labourer. Conceiving that there could be no liberty where any one man had the power of punishing another at his discretion, he took away from every master the use of the whip, and of the chain, and of every other instrument of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1039"],["title","Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa (#0)"],["body","TRAVELS AND RESEARCHES IN SOUTH AFRICA.

By David Livingstone  [British (Scot) Missionary and Explorer--1813-1873.]       [NOTE by the Project Gutenberg Contributor of this file:     This etext was prepared by Alan. R. Light To assure a high quality text,    the original was typed in (manually) twice and electronically compared.    Italicized words or phrases are CAPITALIZED.     David Livingstone was born in Scotland, received his medical degree from    the University of Glasgow, and was sent to South Africa by the London    Missionary Society. Circumstances led him to try to meet the material    needs as well as the spiritual needs of the people he went to, and while    promoting trade and trying to end slavery, he became the first European    to cross the continent of Africa, which story is related in this book.    Two appendixes have been added to this etext, one of which is simply    notes on the minor changes made to make this etext more readable, (old    vs. new forms of words, names, etc.); the other is a review from the    February, 1858 edition of Harper's Magazine, which is included both for    those readers who want to see a brief synopsis, and more importantly to    give an example of how Livingstone's accomplishments were seen in    his own time. The unnamed reviewer was by no means as enlightened as    Livingstone, yet he was not entirely in the dark, either.     The casual reader, who may not be familiar with the historical period,    should note that a few things that Livingstone wrote, which might be    seen as racist by today's standards, was not considered so in his    own time. Livingstone simply uses the terms and the science of his    day--these were no doubt flawed, as is also seen elsewhere, in his    references to malaria, for example. Which all goes to show that it was    the science of the day which was flawed, and not so much Livingstone.     I will also add that the Rev. Livingstone has a fine sense of humour,    which I hope the reader will enjoy. His description of a Makololo dance    is classic.     Lastly, I will note that what I love most about Livingstone's    descriptions is not only that he was not polluted by the racism of his    day, but that he was not polluted by the anti-racism of our own. He    states things as he sees them, and notes that the Africans are, like all    other men, a curious mixture of good and evil. This, to me, demonstrates    his good faith better than any other description could. You see, David    Livingstone does not write about Africa as a missionary, nor as an    explorer, nor yet as a scientist, but as a man meeting fellow men. I    hope you will enjoy his writings as much as I did.     Alan R.

DAVID LIVINGSTONE. London, Oct., 1857.      Preface.  When honored with a special meeting of welcome by the Royal Geographical Society a few days after my arrival in London in December last, Sir Roderick Murchison, the President, invited me to give the world a narrative of my travels; and at a similar meeting of the Directors of the London Missionary Society I publicly stated my intention of sending a book to the press, instead of making many of those public appearances which were urged upon me. The preparation of this narrative* has taken much longer time than, from my inexperience in authorship, I had anticipated.     * Several attempts having been made to impose upon the public,    as mine, spurious narratives of my travels, I beg to tender my    thanks to the editors of the 'Times' and of the 'Athenaeum'    for aiding to expose them, and to the booksellers of London    for refusing to SUBSCRIBE for any copies.  Greater smoothness of diction and a saving of time might have been secured by the employment of a person accustomed to compilation; but my journals having been kept for my own private purposes, no one else could have made use of them, or have entered with intelligence into the circumstances in which I was placed in Africa, far from any European companion. Those who have never carried a book through the press can form no idea of the amount of toil it involves. The process has increased my respect for authors and authoresses a thousand-fold.  I can not refrain from referring, with sentiments of admiration and gratitude, to my friend Thomas Maclear, Esq., the accomplished Astronomer Royal at the Cape. I shall never cease to remember his instructions and help with real gratitude. The intercourse I had the privilege to enjoy at the Observatory enabled me to form an idea of the almost infinite variety of acquirements necessary to form a true and great astronomer, and I was led to the conviction that it will be long before the world becomes overstocked with accomplished members of that profession. Let them be always honored according to their deserts; and long may Maclear, Herschel, Airy, and others live to make known the wonders and glory of creation, and to aid in rendering the pathway of the world safe to mariners, and the dark places of the earth open to Christians!  I beg to offer my hearty thanks to my friend Sir Roderick Murchison, and also to Dr. Norton Shaw, the secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, for aiding my researches by every means in their power.  His faithful majesty Don Pedro V., having kindly sent out orders to support my late companions until my return, relieved my mind of anxiety on their account. But for this act of liberality, I should certainly have been compelled to leave England in May last; and it has afforded me the pleasure of traveling over, in imagination, every scene again, and recalling the feelings which actuated me at the time. I have much pleasure in acknowledging my deep obligations to the hospitality and kindness of the Portuguese on many occasions.  I have not entered into the early labors, trials, and successes of the missionaries who preceded me in the Bechuana country, because that has been done by the much abler pen of my father-in-law, Rev. Robert Moffat, of Kuruman, who has been an energetic and devoted actor in the scene for upward of forty years. A slight sketch only is given of my own attempts, and the chief part of the book is taken up with a detail of the efforts made to open up a new field north of the Bechuana country to the sympathies of Christendom. The prospects there disclosed are fairer than I anticipated, and the capabilities of the new region lead me to hope that by the production of the raw materials of our manufactures, African and English interests will become more closely linked than heretofore, that both countries will be eventually benefited, and that the cause of freedom throughout the world will in some measure be promoted.  Dr. Hooker, of Kew, has had the kindness to name and classify for me, as far as possible, some of the new botanical specimens which I brought over; Dr. Andrew Smith (himself an African traveler) has aided me in the zoology; and Captain Need has laid open for my use his portfolio of African sketches, for all which acts of liberality my thanks are deservedly due, as well as to my brother, who has rendered me willing aid as an amanuensis.  Although I can not profess to be a draughtsman, I brought home with me a few rough diagram-sketches, from one of which the view of the Falls of the Zambesi has been prepared by a more experienced artist.
