The church numbers now 4,000 members, but this estimate, as I understand, is not limited to the Boston adherents, but includes those all over the country. The ceremonial of uniting is to sign a brief \"confession of faith,\" written by Mrs. Eddy, and to unite in communion, which is not celebrated by outward symbols of bread and wine, but by uniting in silent prayer.  The \"confession of faith\" includes the declaration that the Scriptures are the guide to eternal life; that there is a Supreme Being, and his Son, and the Holy Ghost, and that man is made in his image. It affirms the atonement; it recognizes Jesus as the teacher and guide to salvation; the forgiveness of sin by God, and affirms the power of truth over error, and the need of living faith at the moment to realize the possibilities of the divine life. The entire membership of Christian Scientists throughout the world now exceeds 200,000 people. The church in Boston was organized by Mrs. Eddy, and the first meeting held on April 19, 1879. It opened with twenty-six members, and within fifteen years it has grown to its present impressive proportions, and has now its own magnificent church building, costing over $200,000, and entirely paid for when its consecration service on January 6 shall be celebrated. This is certainly a very remarkable retrospect.  Rev. Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of this denomination and discoverer of Christian Science, as they term her work in affirming the present application of the principles asserted by Jesus, is a most interesting personality. At the risk of colloquialism, I am tempted to \"begin at the beginning\" of my own knowledge of Mrs. Eddy, and take, as the point of departure, my first meeting with her and the subsequent development of some degree of familiarity with the work of her life which that meeting inaugurated for me.   MRS. EDDY.  It was during some year in the early '80's that I became aware--from that close contact with public feeling resulting from editorial work in daily journalism--that the Boston atmosphere was largely thrilled and pervaded by a new and increasing interest in the dominance of mind over matter, and that the central figure in all this agitation was Mrs. Eddy. To a note which I wrote her, begging the favor of an interview for press use, she most kindly replied, naming an evening on which she would receive me. At the hour named I rang the bell at a spacious house on Columbus avenue, and I was hardly more than seated before Mrs. Eddy entered the room. She impressed me as singularly graceful and winning in bearing and manner, and with great claim to personal beauty. Her figure was tall, slender, and as flexible in movement as that of a Delsarte disciple; her face, framed in dark hair and lighted by luminous blue eyes, had the transparency and rose-flush of tint so often seen in New England, and she was magnetic, earnest, impassioned. No photographs can do the least justice to Mrs. Eddy, as her beautiful complexion and changeful expression cannot thus be reproduced. At once one would perceive that she had the temperament to dominate, to lead, to control, not by any crude self-assertion, but a spiritual animus. Of course such a personality, with the wonderful tumult in the air that her large and enthusiastic following excited, fascinated the imagination. What had she originated? I mentally questioned this modern St. Catherine who was dominating her followers like any abbess of old. She told me the story of her life, so far as outward events may translate those inner experiences which alone are significant.  Mary Baker was the daughter of Mark and Abigail (Ambrose) Baker, and was born in Concord, N.H., somewhere in the early decade of 1820-'30. At the time I met her she must have been some sixty years of age, yet she had the coloring and the elastic bearing of a woman of thirty, and this, she told me, was due to the principles of Christian Science. On her father's side Mrs. Eddy came from Scotch and English ancestry, and Hannah Moore was a relative of her grandmother. Deacon Ambrose, her maternal grandfather, was known as a \"godly man,\" and her mother was a religious enthusiast, a saintly and consecrated character. One of her brothers, Albert Baker, graduated at Dartmouth and achieved eminence as a lawyer.   MRS. EDDY AS A CHILD.  As a child Mary Baker saw visions and dreamed dreams. When eight years of age she began, like Jeanne d'Arc, to hear \"voices,\" and for a year she heard her name called distinctly, and would often run to her mother questioning if she were wanted. One night the mother related to her the story of Samuel, and bade her, if she heard the voice again to reply as he did: \"Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.\" The call came, but the little maid was afraid and did not reply. This caused her tears of remorse and she prayed for forgiveness, and promised to reply if the call came again. It came, and she answered as her mother had bidden her, and after that it ceased.  These experiences, of which Catholic biographies are full, and which history not unfrequently emphasizes, certainly offer food for meditation. Theodore Parker related that when he was a lad at work in a field one day on his father's farm at Lexington, an old man with a snowy beard suddenly appeared at his side, and walked with him as he worked, giving him high counsel and serious thought. All inquiry in the neighborhood as to whence the stranger came or whither he went was fruitless; no one else had seen him, and Mr. Parker always believed, so a friend has told me, that his visitor was a spiritual form from another world. It is certainly true that many and many persons, whose life has been destined to more than ordinary achievement, have had experiences of voices or visions in their early youth.  At an early age Miss Baker was married to Colonel Glover, of Charleston, S.C., who lived only a year. She returned to her father's home--in 1844--and from that time until 1866 no special record is to be made.  In 1866, while living in Lynn, Mass., Mrs. Eddy (then Mrs. Glover) met with a severe accident and her case was pronounced hopeless by the physicians. There came a Sunday morning when her pastor came to bid her good-by before proceeding to his morning service as there was no probability that she would be alive at its close. During this time she suddenly became aware of a divine illumination and ministration. She requested those with her to withdraw, and reluctantly they did so, believing her delirious. Soon, to their bewilderment and fright, she walked into the adjoining room, \"and they thought I had died, and that it was my apparition,\" she said.   THE PRINCIPLE OF DIVINE HEALING.  From that hour dated her conviction of the principle of divine healing, and that it is as true to-day as it was in the days when Jesus of Nazareth walked the earth. \"I felt that the divine spirit had wrought a miracle,\" she said, in reference to this experience. \"How, I could not tell, but later I found it to be in perfect scientific accord with the divine law.\" From 1866-'69, Mrs. Eddy withdrew from the world to meditate, to pray, to search the Scriptures.  \"During this time,\" she said, in reply to my questions, \"the Bible was my only text-book. It answered my questions as to the process by which I was restored to health; it came to me with a new meaning, and suddenly I apprehended the spiritual meaning of the teaching of Jesus and the principle and the law involved in spiritual science and metaphysical healing--in a word--Christian science.\"  Mrs. Eddy came to perceive that Christ's healing was not miraculous, but was simply a natural fulfilment of divine law--a law as operative in the world to-day as it was nineteen hundred years ago. \"Divine science is begotten of spirituality,\" she says, \"since only the 'pure in heart' can see God.\"  In writing of this experience, Mrs. Eddy has said:    I had learned that thought must be spiritualized   in order to apprehend Spirit. It must become   honest unselfish, and pure, in order to have the   least understanding of God in Divine Science. The   first must become last. Our reliance upon material   things must be transferred to a perception of and   dependence on spiritual things. For spirit to be   supreme in demonstration, it must be supreme in   our affections, and we must be clad with divine   power. I had learned that mind reconstructed the   body and that nothing else could. All science is a   revelation.  Through homeopathy, too, Mrs. Eddy became convinced of the principle of mind healing, discovering that the more attenuated the drug, the more potent was its effects.  In 1877 Mrs. Glover married Dr. Asa Gilbert Eddy, of Londonderry, Vermont, a physician who had come into sympathy with her own views, and who was the first to place \"Christian Scientist,\" on the sign at his door. Dr. Eddy died in 1882, a year after her founding of the \"Metaphysical College\" in Boston, in which he taught.  The work in the Metaphysical College lasted nine years, and it was closed (in 1889) in the very zenith of its prosperity as Mrs. Eddy felt it essential to the deeper foundation of her religious work to retire from active contact with the world. To this college came hundreds and hundreds of students, from Europe as well as this country. I was present at the class lectures now and then by Mrs. Eddy's kind invitation, and such earnestness of attention as was given to her morning talks by the men and women present I never saw equalled.   MRS. EDDY'S PERSONALITY.  On the evening that I first met Mrs. Eddy by her hospitable courtesy, I went to her peculiarly fatigued. I came away in a state of exhilaration and energy that made me feel I could have walked any conceivable distance.

Several years ago Mrs. Eddy removed from Columbus to Commonwealth avenue, where, just beyond Massachusetts avenue, at the entrance to the Back Bay Park, she bought one of the most beautiful residences in Boston. The interior is one of the utmost taste and luxury, and the house is now occupied by Judge and Mrs. Hanna, who are the editors of the _Christian Science Journal_, a monthly publication, and to whose courtesy I am much indebted for some of the data of this paper. \"It is a pleasure to give any information for _The Inter-Ocean_,\" remarked Mrs. Hanna, \"for it is the great daily that is so fair and so just in its attitude toward all questions.\"  The increasing demands of the public on Mrs. Eddy have been, it may be, one factor in her removal to Concord, N.H., where she has a beautiful residence, called Pleasant View. Her health is excellent, and although her hair is white, she retains in a great degree her energy and power; she takes a daily walk and drives in the afternoon. She personally attends to a vast correspondence; superintends the church in Boston, and is engaged on further writings on Christian Science. In every sense she is the recognized head of the Christian Science Church. At the same time it is her most earnest aim to eliminate the element of personality from the faith. \"On this point, Mrs. Eddy feels very strongly,\" said a gentleman to me on Christmas eve, as I sat in the beautiful drawing room, where Judge and Mrs. Hanna, Miss Elsie Lincoln, the soprano for the choir of the new church, and one or two other friends were gathered.  \"Mother feels very strongly,\" he continued, \"the danger and the misfortune of a church depending on any one personality. It is difficult not to centre too closely around a highly gifted personality.\"   THE FIRST ASSOCIATION.  The first Christian Scientist Association was organized on July 4, 1876, by seven persons, including Mrs. Eddy. In April, 1879, the church was founded with twenty-six members, and its charter obtained the following June. Mrs. Eddy had preached in other parishes for five years before being ordained in this church, which ceremony took place in 1881.  The first edition of Mrs. Eddy's book, SCIENCE AND HEALTH, was issued in 1875. During these succeeding twenty years it has been greatly revised and enlarged, and it is now in its ninety-first edition. It consists of fourteen chapters, whose titles are as follows: \"Science, Theology, Medicine,\" \"Physiology,\" \"Footsteps of Truth,\" \"Creation,\" \"Science of Being,\" \"Christian Science and Spiritualism,\" \"Marriage,\" \"Animal Magnetism,\" \"Some Objections Answered,\" \"Prayer,\" \"Atonement and Eucharist,\" \"Christian Science Practice,\" \"Teaching Christian Science,\" \"Recapitulation.\" Key to the Scriptures, Genesis, Apocalypse, and Glossary.  The Christian Scientists do not accept the belief we call spiritualism. They believe those who have passed the change of death are in so entirely different a plane of consciousness that between the embodied and disembodied there is no possibility of communication.  They are diametrically opposed to the philosophy of Karma and of reincarnation, which are the tenets of theosophy. They hold with strict fidelity to what they believe to be the literal teachings of Christ.  Yet each and all these movements, however they may differ among themselves, are phases of idealism and manifestations of a higher spirituality seeking expression.  It is good that each and all shall prosper, serving those who find in one form of belief or another their best aid and guidance, and that all meet on common ground in the great essentials of love to God and love to man as a signal proof of the divine origin of humanity which finds no rest until it finds the peace of the Lord in spirituality. They all teach that one great truth that:    God's greatness flows around our incompleteness,   Round our restlessness, his rest.                        ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.  I add on the following page a little poem that I consider superbly sweet--from my friend, Miss Whiting, the talented author of \"THE WORLD BEAUTIFUL.\"--M.B. EDDY.   AT THE WINDOW.  [_Written for the Traveller_.]    The sunset, burning low,     Throws o'er the Charles its flood of golden light.   Dimly, as in a dream, I watch the flow     Of waves of light.    The splendor of the sky     Repeats its glory in the river's flow;   And sculptured angels, on the gray church tower,     Gaze on the world below.    Dimly, as in a dream,     I see the hurrying throng before me pass,   But 'mid them all I only see _one_ face     Under the meadow grass.    Ah, love! I only know     How thoughts of you forever cling to me:   I wonder how the seasons come and go     Beyond the sapphire sea?  LILLIAN WHITING.  April 15, 1888.     (_Boston Herald_, January 7, 1895.)  EXTRACT.  A TEMPLE GIVEN TO GOD.--DEDICATION OF THE MOTHER CHURCH OF CHRISTIAN SCIENCE.  Novel Method of Enabling Six Thousand Believers to Attend the Exercises--The Service Repeated Four Times--Sermon by Rev. Mary Baker Eddy, Founder of the Denomination--Beautiful Room Which the Children Built.   With simple ceremonies, four times repeated, in the presence of four different congregations, aggregating nearly 6,000 persons, the unique and costly edifice erected in Boston at Norway and Falmouth streets as a home for The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and a testimonial to the discoverer and founder of Christian Science, Rev. Mary Baker Eddy, was yesterday dedicated to the worship of God.  The structure came forth from the hands of the artisans with every stone paid for--with an appeal, not for more money, but for a cessation of the tide of contributions which continued to flow in after the full amount needed was received. From every state in the Union and from many lands, the love offerings of the disciples of Christian Science came to help erect this beautiful structure, and more than 4,000 of these contributors came to Boston from the far-off Pacific coast and the Gulf states and all the territory that lies between, to view the new-built temple and to listen to the message sent them by the teacher they revere.  From all New England the members of the denomination gathered; New York sent its hundreds, and even from the distant states came parties of 40 and 50. The large auditorium, with its capacity for holding 1,400 or 1,500 persons, was hopelessly incapable of receiving this vast throng, to say nothing of the nearly 1,000 local believers. Hence the service was repeated until all who wished had heard and seen; and each of the four vast congregations filled the church to repletion.  At 7:30 a.m. the chimes in the great stone tower, which rises 126 feet above the earth, rung out their message of \"Peace on earth and good will to men.\"  Old familiar hymns--\"All Hail the Power of Jesus's Name,\" and others such--were chimed until the hour for the dedication service had come.  At 9 a.m. the first congregation gathered. Before this service had closed the large vestry room and the spacious lobbies and the sidewalks around the church were all filled with a waiting multitude. At 10:30 o'clock another service began, and at noon still another. Then there was an intermission, and at 3 p.m. the service was repeated for the last time.  There was scarcely even a minor variation in the exercises at any one of these services. At 10:30 a.m., however, the scene was rendered particularly interesting by the presence of several hundred children in the central pews. These were the little contributors to the building fund, whose money was devoted to the \"Mother's room,\" a superb apartment intended for the sole use of Mrs. Eddy. These children are known in the church as the \"Busy Bees,\" and each of them wore a white satin badge with a golden beehive stamped upon it, and beneath the beehive the words \"Mother's Room,\" in gilt letters.  The pulpit end of the auditorium was rich with the adornment of flowers. On the wall of the choir gallery above the platform, where the organ is to be hereafter placed, a huge seven pointed star was hung--a star of lilies resting on palms, with a centre of white immortelles, upon which in letters of red were the words: \"Love-Children's Offering--1894.\"  In the choir and the steps of the platform were potted palms and ferns and Easter lilies. The desk was wreathed with ferns and pure white roses fastened with a broad ribbon bow. On its right was a large basket of white carnations resting on a mat of palms, and on its left a vase filled with beautiful pink roses.  Two combined choirs--that of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, of New York, and the choir of the home church, numbering thirty-five singers in all--led the singing, under the direction, respectively, of Mr. Henry Lincoln Case, and Miss Elsie Lincoln.  Judge S.J. Hanna, editor of the _Christian Science Journal_, presided over the exercises. On the platform with him were Messrs. Ira O. Knapp, Joseph Armstrong, Stephen A. Chase, and William B. Johnson, who compose the board of directors, and Mrs. Henrietta Clark Bemis, a distinguished elocutionist, and a native of Concord, New Hampshire.  The utmost simplicity marked the exercises. After an organ voluntary, the hymn, \"Laus Deo, It Is Done,\" written by Mrs. Eddy for the corner-stone laying last spring, was sung by the congregation. Selections from the Scriptures and from SCIENCE AND HEALTH WITH KEY TO THE SCRIPTURES, were read by Judge Hanna and Dr. Eddy.  A few minutes of silent prayer came next, followed by the recitation of the Lord's prayer, with its spiritual interpretation as given in the Christian Science text-book.  The sermon prepared for the occasion by Mrs. Eddy, which was looked forward to as the chief feature of the dedication, was then read by Mrs. Bemis. Mrs. Eddy remained at her home in Concord, N.H., during the day, because, as heretofore stated in _The Herald_, it is her custom"]]]
