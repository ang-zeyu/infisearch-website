One to Virgilius, and the other turned     To one who sat there, crying, “Up, Currado!     Come and behold what God in grace has willed!”  Then, turned to me: “By that especial grace     Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals     His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,  When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,     Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,     Where answer to the innocent is made.  I do not think her mother loves me more,     Since she has laid aside her wimple white,     Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.  Through her full easily is comprehended     How long in woman lasts the fire of love,     If eye or touch do not relight it often.  So fair a hatchment will not make for her     The Viper marshalling the Milanese     A-field, as would have made Gallura’s Cock.”  In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed     Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal     Which measurably burneth in the heart.  My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,     Still to that point where slowest are the stars,     Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.  And my Conductor: “Son, what dost thou gaze at     Up there?”  And I to him: “At those three torches     With which this hither pole is all on fire.”  And he to me: “The four resplendent stars     Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,     And these have mounted up to where those were.”  As he was speaking, to himself Sordello     Drew him, and said, “Lo there our Adversary!”     And pointed with his finger to look thither.  Upon the side on which the little valley     No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance     The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.  ’Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,     Turning at times its head about, and licking     Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.  I did not see, and therefore cannot say     How the celestial falcons ’gan to move,     But well I saw that they were both in motion.  Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,     The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,     Up to their stations flying back alike.  The shade that to the Judge had near approached     When he had called, throughout that whole assault     Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.  “So may the light that leadeth thee on high     Find in thine own free-will as much of wax     As needful is up to the highest azure,”  Began it, “if some true intelligence     Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood     Thou knowest, tell it me, who once was great there.  Currado Malaspina was I called;     I’m not the elder, but from him descended;     To mine I bore the love which here refineth.”  “O,” said I unto him, “through your domains     I never passed, but where is there a dwelling     Throughout all Europe, where they are not known?  That fame, which doeth honour to your house,     Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land,     So that he knows of them who ne’er was there.  And, as I hope for heaven, I swear to you     Your honoured family in naught abates     The glory of the purse and of the sword.  It is so privileged by use and nature,     That though a guilty head misguide the world,     Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way.”  And he: “Now go; for the sun shall not lie     Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram     With all his four feet covers and bestrides,  Before that such a courteous opinion     Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed     With greater nails than of another’s speech,  Unless the course of justice standeth still.”     Purgatorio: Canto IX   The concubine of old Tithonus now     Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,     Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour;  With gems her forehead all relucent was,     Set in the shape of that cold animal     Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations,  And of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night     Had taken two in that place where we were,     And now the third was bending down its wings;  When I, who something had of Adam in me,     Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,     There were all five of us already sat.  Just at the hour when her sad lay begins     The little swallow, near unto the morning,     Perchance in memory of her former woes,  And when the mind of man, a wanderer     More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,     Almost prophetic in its visions is,  In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended     An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,     With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,  And this, it seemed to me, was where had been     By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,     When to the high consistory he was rapt.  I thought within myself, perchance he strikes     From habit only here, and from elsewhere     Disdains to bear up any in his feet.  Then wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,     Terrible as the lightning he descended,     And snatched me upward even to the fire.  Therein it seemed that he and I were burning,     And the imagined fire did scorch me so,     That of necessity my sleep was broken.  Not otherwise Achilles started up,     Around him turning his awakened eyes,     And knowing not the place in which he was,  What time from Chiron stealthily his mother     Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros,     Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,  Than I upstarted, when from off my face     Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,     As doth the man who freezes with affright.  Only my Comforter was at my side,     And now the sun was more than two hours high,     And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.  “Be not intimidated,” said my Lord,     “Be reassured, for all is well with us;     Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.  Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;     See there the cliff that closes it around;     See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.  Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,     When inwardly thy spirit was asleep     Upon the flowers that deck the land below,  There came a Lady and said: ‘I am Lucia;     Let me take this one up, who is asleep;     So will I make his journey easier for him.’  Sordello and the other noble shapes     Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,     Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.  She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes     That open entrance pointed out to me;     Then she and sleep together went away.”  In guise of one whose doubts are reassured,     And who to confidence his fear doth change,     After the truth has been discovered to him,  So did I change; and when without disquiet     My Leader saw me, up along the cliff     He moved, and I behind him, tow’rd the height.  Reader, thou seest well how I exalt     My theme, and therefore if with greater art     I fortify it, marvel not thereat.  Nearer approached we, and were in such place,     That there, where first appeared to me a rift     Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,  I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,     Diverse in colour, to go up to it,     And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.  And as I opened more and more mine eyes,     I saw him seated on the highest stair,     Such in the face that I endured it not.  And in his hand he had a naked sword,     Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow’rds us,     That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.  “Tell it from where you are, what is’t you wish?”     Began he to exclaim; “where is the escort?     Take heed your coming hither harm you not!”  “A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,”     My Master answered him, “but even now     Said to us, ‘Thither go; there is the portal.’”  “And may she speed your footsteps in all good,”     Again began the courteous janitor;     “Come forward then unto these stairs of ours.”  Thither did we approach; and the first stair     Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,     I mirrored myself therein as I appear.  The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,     Was of a calcined and uneven stone,     Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.  The third, that uppermost rests massively,     Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red     As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.  Both of his feet was holding upon this     The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,     Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.  Along the three stairs upward with good will     Did my Conductor draw me, saying: “Ask     Humbly that he the fastening may undo.”  Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,     For mercy’s sake besought that he would open,     But first upon my breast three times I smote.  Seven P’s upon my forehead he described     With the sword’s point, and, “Take heed that thou wash     These wounds, when thou shalt be within,” he said.  Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,     Of the same colour were with his attire,     And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.  One was of gold, and the other was of silver;     First with the white, and after with the yellow,     Plied he the door, so that I was content.  “Whenever faileth either of these keys     So that it turn not rightly in the lock,”     He said to us, “this entrance doth not open.  More precious one is, but the other needs     More art and intellect ere it unlock,     For it is that which doth the knot unloose.  From Peter I have them; and he bade me err     Rather in opening than in keeping shut,     If people but fall down before my feet.”  Then pushed the portals of the sacred door,     Exclaiming: “Enter; but I give you warning     That forth returns whoever looks behind.”  And when upon their hinges were turned round     The swivels of that consecrated gate,     Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,  Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed     Tarpeia, when was ta’en from it the good     Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.  At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,     And “T"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1002"],["title","Divine Comedy, Longfellow's Translation, Purgatory (#6)"],["body","Deum laudamus” seemed to hear     In voices mingled with sweet melody.  Exactly such an image rendered me     That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,     When people singing with the organ stand;  For now we hear, and now hear not, the words.     Purgatorio: Canto X   When we had crossed the threshold of the door     Which the perverted love of souls disuses,     Because it makes the crooked way seem straight,  Re-echoing I heard it closed again;     And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,     What for my failing had been fit excuse?  We mounted upward through a rifted rock,     Which undulated to this side and that,     Even as a wave receding and advancing.  “Here it behoves us use a little art,”     Began my Leader, “to adapt ourselves     Now here, now there, to the receding side.”  And this our footsteps so infrequent made,     That sooner had the moon’s decreasing disk     Regained its bed to sink again to rest,  Than we were forth from out that needle’s eye;     But when we free and in the open were,     There where the mountain backward piles itself,  I wearied out, and both of us uncertain     About our way, we stopped upon a plain     More desolate than roads across the deserts.  From where its margin borders on the void,     To foot of the high bank that ever rises,     A human body three times told would measure;  And far as eye of mine could wing its flight,     Now on the left, and on the right flank now,     The same this cornice did appear to me.  Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet,     When I perceived the embankment round about,     Which all right of ascent had interdicted,  To be of marble white, and so adorned     With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,     But Nature’s self, had there been put to shame.  The Angel, who came down to earth with tidings     Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,     And opened Heaven from its long interdict,  In front of us appeared so truthfully     There sculptured in a gracious attitude,     He did not seem an image that is silent.  One would have sworn that he was saying, “Ave;”     For she was there in effigy portrayed     Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,  And in her mien this language had impressed,     “Ecce ancilla Dei,” as distinctly     As any figure stamps itself in wax.  “Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,”     The gentle Master said, who had me standing     Upon that side where people have their hearts;  Whereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld     In rear of Mary, and upon that side     Where he was standing who conducted me,  Another story on the rock imposed;     Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,     So that before mine eyes it might be set.  There sculptured in the self-same marble were     The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,     Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.  People appeared in front, and all of them     In seven choirs divided, of two senses     Made one say “No,” the other, “Yes, they sing.”  Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,     Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose     Were in the yes and no discordant made.  Preceded there the vessel benedight,     Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,     And more and less than King was he in this.  Opposite, represented at the window     Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,     Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.  I moved my feet from where I had been standing,     To examine near at hand another story,     Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.  There the high glory of the Roman Prince     Was chronicled, whose great beneficence     Moved Gregory to his great victory;  ’Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;     And a poor widow at his bridle stood,     In attitude of weeping and of grief.  Around about him seemed it thronged and full     Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold     Above them visibly in the wind were moving.  The wretched woman in the midst of these     Seemed to be saying: “Give me vengeance, Lord,     For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking.”  And he to answer her: “Now wait until     I shall return.”  And she: “My Lord,” like one     In whom grief is impatient, “shouldst thou not  Return?”  And he: “Who shall be where I am     Will give it thee.”  And she: “Good deed of others     What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?”  Whence he: “Now comfort thee, for it behoves me     That I discharge my duty ere I move;     Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me.”  He who on no new thing has ever looked     Was the creator of this visible language,     Novel to us, for here it is not found.  While I delighted me in contemplating     The images of such humility,     And dear to look on for their Maker’s sake,  “Behold, upon this side, but rare they make     Their steps,” the Poet murmured, “many people;     These will direct us to the lofty stairs.”  Mine eyes, that in beholding were intent     To see new things, of which they curious are,     In turning round towards him were not slow.  But still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve     From thy good purposes, because thou hearest     How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;  Attend not to the fashion of the torment,     Think of what follows; think that at the worst     It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence.  “Master,” began I, “that which I behold     Moving towards us seems to me not persons,     And what I know not, so in sight I waver.”  And he to me: “The grievous quality     Of this their torment bows them so to earth,     That my own eyes at first contended with it;  But look there fixedly, and disentangle     By sight what cometh underneath those stones;     Already canst thou see how each is stricken.”  O ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones!     Who, in the vision of the mind infirm     Confidence have in your backsliding steps,  Do ye not comprehend that we are worms,     Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly     That flieth unto judgment without screen?  Why floats aloft your spirit high in air?     Like are ye unto insects undeveloped,     Even as the worm in whom formation fails!  As to sustain a ceiling or a roof,     In place of corbel, oftentimes a figure     Is seen to join its knees unto its breast,  Which makes of the unreal real anguish     Arise in him who sees it, fashioned thus     Beheld I those, when I had ta’en good heed.  True is it, they were more or less bent down,     According as they more or less were laden;     And he who had most patience in his looks  Weeping did seem to say, “I can no more!”     Purgatorio: Canto XI   “Our Father, thou who dwellest in the heavens,     Not circumscribed, but from the greater love     Thou bearest to the first effects on high,  Praised be thy name and thine omnipotence     By every creature, as befitting is     To render thanks to thy sweet effluence.  Come unto us the peace of thy dominion,     For unto it we cannot of ourselves,     If it come not, with all our intellect.  Even as thine own Angels of their will     Make sacrifice to thee, Hosanna singing,     So may all men make sacrifice of theirs.  Give unto us this day our daily manna,     Withouten which in this rough wilderness     Backward goes he who toils most to advance.  And even as we the trespass we have suffered     Pardon in one another, pardon thou     Benignly, and regard not our desert.  Our virtue, which is easily o’ercome,     Put not to proof with the old Adversary,     But thou from him who spurs it so, deliver.  This last petition verily, dear Lord,     Not for ourselves is made, who need it not,     But for their sake who have remained behind us.”  Thus for themselves and us good furtherance     Those shades imploring, went beneath a weight     Like unto that of which we sometimes dream,  Unequally in anguish round and round     And weary all, upon that foremost cornice,     Purging away the smoke-stains of the world.  If there good words are always said for us,     What may not here be said and done for them,     By those who have a good root to their will?  Well may we help them wash away the marks     That hence they carried, so that clean and light     They may ascend unto the starry wheels!  “Ah! so may pity and justice you disburden     Soon, that ye may have power to move the wing,     That shall uplift you after your desire,  Show us on which hand tow’rd the stairs the way     Is shortest, and if more than one the passes,     Point us out that which least abruptly falls;  For he who cometh with me, through the burden     Of Adam’s flesh wherewith he is invested,     Against his will is chary of his climbing.”  The words of theirs which they returned to those     That he whom I was following had spoken,     It was not manifest from whom they came,  But it was said: “To the right hand come with us     Along the bank, and ye shall find a pass     Possible for living person to ascend.  And were I not impeded by the stone,     Which this proud neck of mine doth subjugate,     Whence I am forced to hold my visage down,  Him, who still lives and does not name himself,     Would I regard, to see if I may know him     And make him piteous unto this burden.  A Latian was I, and born of a great Tuscan;     Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi was my father;     I know not if his name were ever with you.  The ancient blood and deeds of gallantry     Of my progenitors so arrogant made me     That, thinking not upon the common mother,  All men I held in scorn to such extent     I died therefor, as know the Sienese,     And every child in Campagnatico.  I am Omberto; and not to me alone     Has pride done harm, but all my kith and kin     Has with it dragged into adversity.  And here must I this burden bear for it     Till God be satisfied, since I did not     Among the living, here among the dead.”  Listening I downward bent my countenance;     And one of them, not this one who was speaking,     Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him,  And"]]]
