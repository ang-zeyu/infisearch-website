CHAPTER VII  THE ARRIVAL OF SONGBIRD   \"So you've made some enemies as well as some friends, eh?\" remarked Songbird Powell, after he had been registered, taken up to his room, and had listened to what the Rover boys had to tell. \"No use of talking, it doesn't take you fellows long to stir things up!\"  \"You said you had a surprise for us, Songbird,\" returned Tom. \"I'm dying by inches to know what it is.\"  \"Maybe it's a new poem,\" put in Sam with a grimace at his brothers.  \"I've got a poem--several of them, in fact,\" answered Songbird, \"but I didn't have those in mind when I spoke. Who do you suppose I met yesterday morning, in Ithaca, while I was waiting for the train?\"  \"Dora Stanhope and the Lanings,\" answered Tom promptly.  \"No. Tad Sobber.\"  \"Tad Sobber!\" exclaimed the Rover boys in concert.  \"Songbird, are you sure of it?\" demanded Dick.  \"Sure? Wasn't I talking to him!\"  \"But--but--I thought he was lost in that hurricane, when the _Josephine_ was wrecked.\"  \"No. It seems he escaped to a vessel bound for England; but his uncle, Sid Merrick, was lost, and so were most of the others. Sobber just got back from England--came in on one of the ocean liners, so he told me.\"  \"How did he act?\" asked Tom.  \"Where was he going?\" added Sam.  \"Did he seem to have any money?\" came from Dick.  All of the Rovers were intensely interested, and showed it plainly.  \"Say, one question at a time, please!\" cried Songbird, \"You put me in mind of a song I once wrote about a little boy:    \"'A little lad named Johnny Spark   Was nothing but a question mark.   He asked his questions night and day,   When he was resting or at play.   One minute he would tackle pa,   And then he'd turn and tackle ma;   And then his uncle he would quiz--\"    \"And let that line please end the biz,\"  finished Tom. \"Say, Songbird, please don't quote poetry when we are waiting to hear all about Tad Sobber. Have some pity on us.\"  \"Yes, tell us of Sobber,\" added Sam and Dick.  \"All right, if you don't appreciate my verses,\" returned the would-be poet with a sigh. \"Well, to start with, Tad Sobber was well dressed, and looked as if he had all the money he needed. He wore a brown checkered suit, so evidently he hasn't gone into mourning for his uncle. He told me he had had a rough experience on the ocean during the hurricane, and he blames you Rovers for all his troubles.\"  \"That's just like Sobber,\" was Dick's comment.  \"He wouldn't tell me where he was going or what he was going to do, but he did let drop a remark or two about the fortune you discovered on Treasure Isle. He said that he was firmly convinced that the money belonged to him and to his uncle's estate, and that he meant some day to make a fight for it.\"  \"In the courts?\" asked Tom. \"If he does that he'll get beaten. Father says the treasure belongs to the Stanhope estate and to nobody else.\"  \"No, he didn't say he was going to court about it, but he said he was bound to get hold of it some day.\"  \"I hope he doesn't try to get it by force,\" said Sam. \"That would mean trouble for the Stanhopes and the Lanings.\"  \"The money is in the banks now, Sam,\" said Dick. \"He couldn't get hold of it excepting on an order from those to whom it belongs.\"  \"And they'll never give him any such order,\" added Tom.  \"Do you suppose he was going to see the Stanhopes and the Lanings?\" questioned the oldest Rover anxiously.  \"He didn't say, I wanted to question him further, but a man who was standing on a corner, some distance away, beckoned to him, and he left me and joined the man, and the two walked off.\"  \"Who was the man?\"  \"I don't know.\"  The boys talked the matter over for some time, but Songbird had nothing more to tell, and at last the subject was dropped. Songbird was introduced to Stanley, Max, and a number of the other students, and soon he felt quite at home.  That evening there was a bit of hazing. Dick and Tom escaped, but Sam, Songbird and Stanley were caught in the lower hallway by a number of the sophomores and carried bodily to the gymnasium. Here they were tossed in blankets and then blindfolded.  \"We'll take them to the river,\" said one of the sophomores. \"A bath will do them good.\"  \"Let's give 'em a rubbing down with mud!\" cried Jerry Koswell. He had some tar handy, and if the mud was used he intended to mix some of the tar with it on the sly.  \"That's the talk!\" cried Larkspur, who knew about the tar, he having purchased it for Koswell and Flockley. The three had at first intended to smear the beds of the Rovers with it, but had gotten no chance.  \"Give them a good dose!\" said Dudd Flockley. He had joined in the blanket-tossing with vigor.  Sam, Songbird and Stanley were being led to the river when Max came rushing up to Tom and Dick, who happened to be in the library, looking over some works of travel.  \"Come on mit you!\" he cried excitedly in broken English. \"Da have got Sam and Stanley and dot friend of yours alretty! Hurry up, or da was killed before we git to help 'em!\"  \"They? Who?\" asked Dick, leaping up.  \"Sophs--down by der gym!\" And then Max cooled down a bit and related what he had seen.  \"We must surely go to the rescue!\" cried Tom. \"Wait! I'll get clubs for all hands!\" And he rushed up to his room, where in a clothing closet lay the end of the hose he had taken away from the sophomores. With his knife he cut the section of hose into eight \"clubs,\" and With these in his hands he hurried below again.  At a cry from Dick and Max the freshmen commenced to gather on the campus, and Tom quickly handed around the sections of hose. Other first-year lads procured sticks, boxing gloves, and other things, and looked around for somebody to lead them.  \"Come on!\" cried Dick, and he sprang to the front, with Tom on one side and Max on the other. The German-American boy had a big squirtgun filled with water, a gun used by the gardener for spraying the bushes.  The sophomores had captured four more freshmen, and marched all of the crowd down to the river front, when the band under Dick, sixteen strong, appeared. The latter came on yelling like Indians, and flourishing their sections of hose, and sticks and other things.  \"Let 'em go! Let 'em go!\" was the rallying cry, and then whack! whack! whack! down came the rubber clubs and the sticks on the backs of the second-year students.  \"Fight 'em off!\" came from the sophomores.  \"Chase 'em away!\" yelled Dudd Flockley; but hardly had he spoken when Max discharged the squirtgun, and the water took Flockley in the eye, causing him to yell with fright and retreat. Then Max turned the gun on Larkspur, soaking the latter pretty thoroughly.  Attacked from the rear, the sophomores had to let go their holds on their victims, and as soon as they were released Sam, Songbird and the others ran to the right and the left and joined the force under Dick.  All told, the freshmen now numbered twenty-three, while the sophomores could count up but fourteen. The second-year students were hemmed in and gradually forced nearer and nearer to the bank of the river.  \"Let up! let up!\" yelled several in alarm. \"Don't knock us overboard!\"  \"It's nothing but mud here! I don't want my new suit spoiled!\" cried one.  \"I can't swim!\" added another.  \"I've got an idea,\" whispered Tom to the others near him. \"Shove 'em in the mud and water, or else make 'em promise not to take part in the necktie rush.\"  \"That's the talk!\" replied Dick. He caught hold of the sophomore in front of him. \"All shove, fellows!\" And the second-year students were gradually forced to the very edge of the river at a point where there was a little water and a good deal of dark, sticky mud. Of course they fought desperately to push the freshmen back, but they were outnumbered, as already told.  \"Now, then, every fellow who will promise not to take part in the necktie rush Monday will be allowed to go free,\" said Dick loudly. \"The others must take their ducking in the water--and mud.\"  \"Let me go!\" roared Dudd Flockley. \"I'm not going to have this suit ruined!\"  \"I don't want to get these patent leathers wet!\" cried Jerry Koswell, who had on a new pair of shiny shoes.  \"Then promise!\" cried Sam, and \"Promise!\" \"Promise!\" came from many others.  Without delay several of the sophomores promised, and they were allowed to depart. Then the others began to show fight, and three managed to escape, among them being Dudd Flockley. The others were forced into the water and mud up to their knees. Then they cried out in alarm, and while two finally escaped, the others also promised to keep out of the necktie contest.  \"Just wait!\" snarled Jerry Koswell as he at last managed to pull himself out of the sticky mud. \"Just wait, that's all!\" His patent-leather shoes were a sight to behold.  \"Not so much fun when you are hazed yourself, is it?\" asked Sam coolly.  \"We'll give it to 'em yet,\" put in Bart Larkspur. \"Lots of time between now and the closing of the term.\" And then he and Koswell ran off to join Dudd Flockley. The three went to their rooms and cleaned up as best they could, and then took a walk down the road in the direction of Rushville.  \"It was that Dick Rover who led the attack,\" said Dudd Flockley. \"Do you know what I think? I think he is going to try to make himself leader of the freshies.\"  \"Just what I thought, too,\" answered Larkspur. \"And if that's the fact we ought to do all we can to pull him down.\"  \"Tom Rover is the fellow I am going to get after,\" came from Jerry Koswell. He had not forgotten how Tom and Sam had sent him to the floor in the presence of Minnie Sanderson.  The three students walked a distance of half a mile when they saw approaching them a trampish-looking man carrying what looked to be a new dress-suit case. They looked at the fellow rather sharply and he halted as he came up to them.  \"Excuse me,\" he mumbled, \"but did any of you gents lose this case?\"  \"Why, it must be Rover's case!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10323"],["title","The Rover Boys at College; Or, The Right Road and the Wrong (#8)"],["body"," Flockley. Nearly every one in the college had heard about the missing baggage.  \"I found it in the bushes alongside the road,\" went on the tramp. \"Thought it might belong to some of the college gents.\"  \"Let me look at it,\" said Koswell, and turned the case around. \"Yes, it's Rover's,\" he added, seeing the initials and the address.  \"Better take it up to the college,\" put in Larkspur.  \"Wait, I'll take it up,\" said Jerry Koswell suddenly. \"This belongs to a poor chap,\" he added to the tramp. \"He won't be able to reward you, but I will. Here's a quarter for you.\" And he passed over the silver piece.  \"Much obliged,\" said the tramp. \"Want me to carry it up to the buildings?\"  \"No, I'll do that,\" said Koswell, and then he winked at his cronies. The tramp went on and the three watched him disappear in the distance.  \"What did you do that for, Jerry?\" asked Flockley with interest. He surmised that something new was afoot.  \"Oh, I did it for the fun of the thing,\" answered Koswell coolly. \"But maybe I can work it in somehow against that Rover bunch. Anyway, I'll try.\"     CHAPTER VIII  THE COLORS CONTEST   The next morning Tom was much surprised to find his missing dress-suit case standing in front of his room door.  \"Hello! How did this get here?\" he cried as he picked up the baggage.  \"What's that?\" asked Sam, who was just getting up.  \"Look!\" answered his brother, and brought the case in. \"Somebody must have found it and left it here while I was asleep.\"  \"Very kind, whoever he was,\" said Sam. \"Are the contents all right?\"  Instead of answering Tom placed the suit case on a chair and started to unlock it.  \"Hello, it's unlocked!\" he murmured. \"I thought I had it locked.\"  He shoved back the clasps and threw the case open. The contents were much jumbled, but he had expected this from the fact that the bag had been jounced out of the carriage.  \"I guess the stuff is all here,\" he said slowly, turning over the clothing and other things. \"Somehow, I thought I had more in the case, though,\" he added presently.  \"Don't you know what you had?\"  \"Well--er--I packed it in a hurry, you know. I wanted to go fishing, and so I got through as soon as I could. Oh, I guess it's all right.\"  Tom was too lively a youth to pay much attention to his personal belongings. Often he hardly knew what suit of clothing he had on or what sort of a necktie. The only times he really fixed up was when Nellie Laning was near. Why he did that only himself (and possibly Nellie) knew.  Sunday passed quietly. Some of the boys attended one or another of the churches in Ashton, and the Rovers went with them. Dudd Flockley and his cronies took a walk up the river, and reaching a warm, sunny spot, threw themselves down to smoke cigarettes and talk.  \"Well, what did you do about the dress-suit case, Jerry?\" asked Flockley with a sharp look at his crony.  \"Returned it, as you know,\" was the answer, and Jerry winked suggestively.  \"I'd have flung the bag in the river before I would give it to such a chap as Tom Rover,\" growled Larkspur.  \"You trust me, Larky, old boy,\" answered Jerry Koswell. \"I know what I'm doing.\"  \"Humph!\"  \"I said I returned the case, but I didn't say I returned all that was in it.\"  \"What do you mean by that?\" demanded Flockley. \"If you've got a secret, out with it.\"  Koswell looked around to make certain that no outsider was near.  \"I kept a few things out of the bag--some things that had Tom Rover's name or his initials on them.\"  \"And you are going to--\" went on Flockley.  \"I am going to use 'em some day, when I get the chance.\"  \"Good!\" cried Flockley. \"I'll help you, Jerry!\"  \"And so will I,\" added Larkspur. \"If we work it right we can get Tom Rover in a peck of trouble.\"  On Monday morning the college term opened in earnest, and once again the Rovers had to get down to the \"grind,\" as Sam expressed it. But the boys had had a long vacation and were in the best of health, and they did not mind the studying.  \"Got to have a good education if you want to get along nowadays,\" was the way Dick expressed himself. \"If you don't learn you are bound to be at the mercy of anybody who wants to take advantage of your ignorance.\"  \"Dick, what are you going to do when you get out of college?\" asked Tom.  \"I don't know--go into business, I imagine.\"  \"Oh, he'll marry and settle down,\" chimed in Sam. \"He and Dora will live in an ivy-covered cottage like two turtle doves, and--\"  Sam got no further, for a pillow thrown by Dick caught him full in the face and made him stagger.  \"Sam is thinking of what he and Grace are going to do,\" said Dick. \"And you and Nellie will likely have a cottage across the way,\" he added, grinning at Tom.  \"Really!\" murmured Tom, and got as red as a beet. \"Say, call it off,\" he added. \"Do you know we have the necktie rush this afternoon?\"  \"It won't amount to much,\" answered Sam. \"Too many sophs out of it.\"  \"Don't you believe it,\" said Dick. \"Remember, the juniors come into this as well as the sophs.\"  \"Say, I've thought of a plan!\" cried Tom. \"Greatest ever! I'm going to patent it!\" And he commenced to dance around in his excitement.  \"What's loose?\" asked Songbird, coming up at that moment, followed by some others. \"Tom, have you got a pain in your inwards?\"  \"No, an idea--it's about the same thing,\" responded Tom gaily. \"We want to get the best of the second and third-year fellows during the necktie rush, and I think I know how we can do it. We'll all sew our neckties fast!\"  For a moment there was silence, and then, as the others caught the idea, they commenced to laugh.  \"That's it!\" cried Sam. \"I'll sew mine as tight as a drum!\"  \"I'll rivet mine on, if that will do any good,\" added Dick.  \"Sure thing!\" came from Songbird, and he commenced to recite:    \"Oh, the sophs and the juniors will try   To steal from the freshies each tie;       But they will not win,       For we'll fight them like sin--\"    \"And bust 'em right plumb in the eye!\" finished Tom. \"Oh, say, but will you all sew your neckties fast?\"  \"Sure!\"  \"And we'll tell the rest to do so, too,\" added another freshman who was present.  The news soon circulated, and was kept from all but the first-year students.  It must be confessed that many of the students found it hard to fix their minds on their lessons that afternoon. One boy, Max Spangler, brought on a great laugh when the following question was put to him:  \"What great improvement in navigation did Fulton introduce?\"  \"Neckties,\" answered Max abstractedly.  \"Neckties?\" queried the instructor in astonishment.  \"I--er--I don't mean neckties,\" stammered the German-American student, \"I mean steamboats.\"  When the afternoon session was over the students hurried to their various rooms. The sophomores and the juniors who were to take part in the contest talked matters over, and as far as possible laid out a plan of action. It was decided that the largest and heaviest of the second and third-year students were to tackle the smallest freshmen first, while the others were to hold the rest of the first-year men at bay.  \"We'll get fifteen or twenty neckties first clip that way,\" said one of the sophomores, \"and it doesn't matter who we get them from. A little chap's tie counts as much as that of a two-hundred pounder.\"  In the meantime the freshmen were busy following Tom's advice and sewing their ties fast to their collars, shirts, and even their undershirts. Then Dick, who had, unconsciously almost, become a leader, called the boys into an empty recitation-room.  \"Now, I've got a plan,\" said he. \"We want to bunch up, and all the little fellows and lightweights get in the center. The heavy fellows can take the outside and fight the others off. Understand?\"  \"Yes!\"  \"That's a good idea!\"  \"Forward to the fray!\" yelled Stanley, \"and woe be to him who tries to get my tie! His blood be on his own head!\" he added tragically.  \"Forward!\" cried Sam, \"and let our watchword be, 'Die, but no tie!'\"  \"Now don't get excited,\" said Dick. \"Take it coolly, and I'm certain that when the time is up we'll have the most of our ties still on.\"  It was the custom to go out on the campus at a given time, and when the chapel bell sounded out the hour Dick led the freshmen forward. They came out of a side door in a body and formed around the flagstaff almost before the sophomores and juniors knew they had appeared.  The seniors took no part, but three had been \"told off\" to act as referees, and they stood around as if inspecting the buildings and the scenery. The instructors, who also knew what was coming, wisely kept out of sight.  \"Come on, and at 'em!\" called out Dudd Flockley, and this cry was quickly taken up by all the others who were to take part in the contest.  \"Hello! They know a thing or two,\" said Frank Holden, who was the sophomore leader in the attack. \"They've got the little fellows in the middle.\"  As tightly as possible the freshmen gathered around the flagstaff. Each wore a necktie of the college colors and it was fastened as tightly as strong thread could hold it.  \"At 'em!\" was the yell of the second and third-year lads. \"Tear 'em apart! Pull the ties from 'em!\"  And then they leaped in at the big freshmen, and on the instant a battle royal was started. Down went four boys on the campus, rolling over and over. Others caught each other by the hands and shoulders and wrestled valiantly.  Dick and Tom were in the front rank, with Sam directly behind them. Dick was caught by Frank Holden, and the two wrestled with might and main. Frank was big and strong, but Dick managed to hold him so that all the sophomore leader could do was to get his finger tips on the sought-for necktie.  Flockley tackled Tom, and much to his surprise was tripped up and sent flat on his back. Mad with sudden rage, Flockley scrambled up and let out a savage kick for Tom's stomach. But Tom was too quick for the sophomore, and leaped to one side.  \"Foul!\" cried Tom.  \"Don't do that again!\" called one of the seniors to Dudd. \"If you do you'll"]]]
