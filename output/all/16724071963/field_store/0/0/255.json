The supper was palatable enough, but very unwholesome, and the table-cloth was dirty and wrinkled.  \"You don't seem to like my cooking,\" said Mrs. Rosenberg, with a displeased glance at Dotty's full plate.  \"Yes'm,\" replied the little guest, faintly; \"but I've eaten up my appetite.\"  At the same time she swallowed a little oily gravy in desperation, and looked slyly to see if Solly was watching her. Yes, he was, and so were all the rest of the family, as if she had been a peculiar kind of animal, just caught and caged.  \"I suppose they are dreadful nice folks at your house,\" continued Mrs. Rosenberg. \"I almost wonder your mother let you come here to play with my poor little girl. Mandy's just as good as you are, though,--you can tell her so,--and she's got a sight prettier eyes.\"  Dotty's heart kept swelling and swelling, till presently it seemed as if there wasn't room enough in her whole body to hold it. She thought of the cheerful, orderly tea-table at home; she recalled her mother's gentle ways, her lovely face, and longed to kiss her cheek, and whisper, \"Forgive me.\"  \"Mamma'll be just as patient with me,\" thought Dotty; \"she always is! But if I once get home, I'll never make her patient any more. I'll never run away again; not unless she _asks_ me to--I won't.\"  The children, as fast as they finished their suppers, jumped up and ran away from the table--all but Solly, who had some faint idea that it was not polite to do so before company. He was a natural gentleman; and it was unfortunate that just at this time his mother was obliged to send him to Munjoy of an errand. Otherwise he would have made his sister give up Dotty's hat, and perhaps would have walked home with the unhappy child himself.  As it was, Dotty did not seem to have a friend in the world. It was now so dark that she hardly dared look out of doors; but even in the brightest daylight she could not have found her way home.  \"You've got to stay all night,\" said Mandoline. \"Isn't that splendid?\"  Mandoline did not mean to be cruel. She had observed that her mother urged her own guests to stay, and sometimes kept them almost by force. This she supposed was true politeness. More than that, she was anxious, for private reasons, to hold Dotty, so she might not have to knit so much. She knew, too, that her mother was proud to have such a well-bred little girl in the house. So she would not give up Dotty's hat.  At eight o'clock, Dotty went to bed with Mandoline in the unfinished chamber, sorely against her will; and Mandoline told her such dreadful stories that she could not close her eyes for fright.  \"This is the queerest house I was ever in,\" thought she, \"and the queerest bed. I s'pose it's made of pin-feathers, for they stick into me awfully.\"  The bed was on the floor, and was founded upon woolsacks and buffalo skins. The sleeping arrangements in this house were somewhat peculiar. Mrs. Rosenberg was like the old woman in the shoe, and she stowed her numerous family away for the night in as little space as possible. For instance, the four youngest children slept together in one trundle-bed, two at the top and two at the bottom, their feet coming together in the middle. But Mandoline had left the trundle bed, and was lying on the floor with her guest. The companion the trundle-bed--little Kosina--was quite indignant at being deserted, and made a loud outcry, in the hope of attracting her mother's attention.  \"I don't want to sleep alone!\" said she; \"I don't want to sleep _alo-o-one!_\"  At another time Dotty would have laughed heartily. It was so absurd for a child to be lonesome when there were three in the bed! But Dotty was too low-spirited even to smile. Mrs. Rosenberg came up and boxed Rosina's ears; and after that the trundle-bed subsided.  At last, when Dotty supposed it must be midnight, though it was only nine o'clock, there came a loud knocking at the side door. She hid her face under the coverlet, feeling sure it was either a wild Indian or a highway robber.  \"Don't be afraid,\" said Mandoline, rousing herself. \"It is somebody after beer, and mother has locked up the store.\"  No, it was Mr. Parlin's voice which spoke. Dotty's swollen heart gave a great bound, and then sank heavier than ever.  \"My little daughter Alice has run away.\" That was what he said. \"Is she in your house, Mrs. Rosenberg?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Mrs. Rosenberg, \"I expect its likely she is; but she and my Mandoline's been abed and asleep two hours.\"  \"O, papa, I'm wide awake!\" cried little Dotty, with an eager shriek, which pierced the rafters.  \"Good night, then,\" said Mr. Parlin, coldly.  \"O, but, papa, I want to go home. What did my mamma say about me?\"  \"She said she had sent you of an errand. When you have finished your errand, you may come home. Good night.\"  \"O, NOT good night!\" screamed Dotty, almost falling down stairs in her haste, and fastening her dress as she ran. \"It was 'cause Lina hid my hat; and that was why--\"  \"By the way,\" said Mr. Parlin, without paying the slightest attention to his half-frantic little daughter, who was clinging to his knees, and pleading with her whole soul, \"Mrs. Rosenberg, I'm sorry to trouble you, but if you will be kind enough to keep this little runaway girl till I send for her, I shall be very much obliged.\"  \"O, certainly, Mr. Parlin; certainly, sir,\" replied the Jewess, smiling very sweetly, and trying to pat Dotty's head, which was in such violent motion that she only succeeded in touching the end of her nose. No one who had looked at Mrs. Rosenberg at that moment would have suspected her of being a vixen. She was sure Mr. Parlin would pay her handsomely if she kept his daughter there for a day or two; and the prospect of a little money always made the poor woman very amiable.  \"Thank you, madam,\" said Mr. Parlin, gently disengaging himself from Dotty. \"When you are tired of my little daughter, will you please let me know? Goodnight, Mrs. Rosenberg; good-night, Alice.\"  And, before Dotty had time to scream again, he was gone.  For a moment she stood quite still, gazing at the door-latch; then rushed out into the darkness, calling, \"Papa, papa!\" But Mrs. Rosenberg laid her strong hands upon her, and brought her back.  \"So your mother didn't say you might come? I thought it was queer. Hush! hush! Don't go into fits, child. There are no bears in this house, and nothing will hurt you.\"  Mrs. Rosenberg's manner was much kinder than it had been before; and with a child's quick insight, Dotty perceived that her father's coming had wrought the change.  \"I want to go home! I want to go home!\" cried she, with another passionate outburst. \"O, take me--do! They won't send for me, never! Take me, and I'll give you--O, Mrs. Rosenberg, I'll give you--\"  For a little while there was quite a scene at the little grocery, and it repented Mandoline that she had ever hidden Dotty's hat. The trundle-bed waked up at both ends and screamed; the black and tan dog, who slept under the counter in the store, barked lustily; the parrot in the blue cage called out, \"Quit that! quit that!\" and Mrs. Rosenberg was afraid a policeman would come in to inquire the cause of the uproar. She pattered about in a pair of her husband's cotton-velvet slippers, and tucked all her little ones into bed again, very much as if they had been clothes in a boiler, which she was forcing down with a stick. She was a woman who would be obeyed; and Dotty, finding it of no use to hold out against fate, went up stairs at last, and lay down beside Mandoline on the \"pin-feathers.\"  This stolen visit had turned out quite, quite different from her anticipations. Instead of a delightful supper of some mysterious Jewish cookery, she had been drinking gall and wormwood. That Lina would not let her go--THAT was the gall; that her father made her stay--THIS was the wormwood.  \"She is a tough piece,\" sighed Mrs. Rosenberg, as she laid her weary limbs to repose; \"I didn't know, one while, but she'd get away in spite of me. I wonder what her father'll pay me. He seems to think this is a house of correction. Her mother won't be likely to let her stay more than one day. I'll have on the best table-cloth for breakfast; and along in the forenoon I'll fetch out some macaroni cakes and lager beer; that'll coax her up, I guess.\"  Just then Mrs. Rosenberg down stairs and Dotty Dimple up stairs both fell asleep. One dreamed of running away and being chased by a dog with a hat on his head, who barked \"Good-night\" as fiercely as a bite. The other dreamed of money and brown sugar. And all the while the rats were treating themselves to nibbles of wood; but nobody heard them. Be careful, old rats! Your teeth have done mischief before now! The night wore on to the wee small hours, when a loud noise like a cannon startled Mrs. Rosenberg; or was she dreaming? The house was shaken to its very foundation, as if by an earthquake, and the room was full of smoke. She was just running for the children, when the building fell together with a crash, the roof was blown off into the street, the windows were shivered to atoms, and tongues of flame leaped madly up from the ruins.  What did it mean? She was so stunned by the shock that she scarcely cared whether one of her children was spared or not; she only thought in her stupor that Mr. Parlin would not pay her for Dotty's lodging if the child was blown to pieces.  \"I know how it happened,\" said she, twitching at her own hair to arouse herself. \"Just as Abraham always said; the rats have been nibbling matches in the store; they've burned a hole through the floor, and set fire to that keg of gunpowder. Yes, that's it!\"     CHAPTER VII.  PLAYING PRISONER.   I know how it happened, too. It came of eating sausages. Mrs. Rosenberg, after she was fairly awake,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10320"],["title","Dotty Dimple at Play (#7)"],["body","so uncomfortable and oppressed that she went up stairs to see if the children were safe. Really, I do suppose those little human souls were precious to her, after all.  There lay Mandoline and Dotty side by side on the buffalo skins; and the Jewish mother stood in her short night-dress, with a tallow candle in her hand, and gazed at them tenderly. That horrible dream had stirred the fountain of love in her heart They made a beautiful picture, and there was no stain of evil in their young faces. It seems as if the angel of Sleep flies away with loads of naughtiness, for he always leaves sleeping children looking very innocent. But, alas! he brings back next morning all he carried away, for the little ones wake up with just as bad hearts as ever.  \"What sweet little creeters!\" said Mrs. Rosenberg, bending over and kissing them both; \"just like seraphims right out of the clouds.\"  Softly, madam! If a drop of tallow should fall on them from that candle, they might take to themselves wings and fly away. That was what Cupid did in the fairy story, and you are in fairy-land yourself, Mrs. Rosenberg; you are still half asleep.  She looked at Mandoline's perfect little hand, lying outside the patchwork quilt.  \"It doesn't seem, now,\" murmured the mother, with a tear in her eye, \"that I could ever whack them pretty fingers with a thimble. I do believe if I wasn't pestered to death with everything under the sun to do, I might be kind o' half-way decent.\"  Perhaps the poor woman told the truth; I think she did.  Then, as she stood there, she breathed a little prayer without any words,--not for herself--for she did not suppose God would hear _that_,--but for her children that she \"banged about\" every day of their lives.  She was not really a Jewess, for she had no religion of any sort, and never went to church; but I am sure of one thing: little overworked Mandoline would have loved her mother better if she had known she ever prayed for her at all.  In the morning, Mrs. Rosenberg was just as hard and sharp as ever; she could not stop to be pleasant. Dotty longed to get away; but she was an exile from her own dear home; whither could she turn?  It was a cold morning, and the children ran down stairs half dressed and shivering. Dotty spread out her stiff, red fingers before the cooking-stove like the sticks of a fan. \"O, hum!\" thought she, drearily, \"I wish I could see the red coals in our grate. My mamma wouldn't let me go to the table with such hair as this. Prudy'd say 'twas 'harum scarum.' But I can't brush it with a tooth-comb, 'thout any glass--so there!\"  Dotty's curly hair looked quite as respectable as Mandoline's. Mrs. Rosenberg was far too busy to attend to her children's heads. They might be rough on the outside, and full of mischief inside; but she could not stop to inquire.  \"What a dreadful nice breakfast!\" remarked Judith, rubbing her hands, and accidentally hitting little Jacob, who forthwith spilled some molasses on the clean table-cloth, and had his ears boxed in consequence. It was very evident that this meal was a much better one than usual--a sort of festival in honor of Dotty Dimple: Dutch cheese and pickles, mince-pie and gingerbread, pepper-boxes and green and yellow dishes, were mixed up together as if they had been stirred about with a spoon.  Dotty had not intended to eat a mouthful; but after her light supper of the night before, she was really hungry, and, in spite of her best resolves, the fish-hash and corncake gradually disappeared from her plate.  After breakfast she felt more resigned, and armed herself to meet her fate. Mrs. Rosenberg graciously allowed Mandoline to lay aside her tedious knitting, and give her undivided attention to her guest. Dotty had no heart for play.  \"Seems as if I should choke in this house,\" said she; \"let's go out and breathe.\"  The air inside the house was rather stifling from a mixture of odors, and soon the grocery began to fill with loud-talking men and boys; but not the least of Dotty's troubles was the black and tan dog, who seemed to have just such a temper as Mrs. Rosenberg, and would certainly have scolded if he had had the gift of speech.  The two little girls went out to walk; but it was not a pleasant street where the grocery stood, and Dotty hurried on to a better part of the town. They fluttered about for two or three hours, as aimless as a couple of white butterflies. Just as they were turning to go back to the dismal little grocery, which Dotty thought was more like a lock-up than ever, they met Mr. and Mrs. Parlin riding out in a carriage.  [Illustration: DOTTY AND THE BLACK-AND-TAN DOG.]  Dotty felt a sudden tumult of joy and shame, but the joy was uppermost. She rushed headlong across the street, swinging her arms and startling the horse, who supposed she was some new and improved kind of windmill, dressed up in a little girl's clothes.  \"O, my darling mamma, my darling mamma!\"  To her surprise, the horse did not stop. He only pricked up his ears, and looked with displeasure at the windmill, but kept along as before.  \"Mamma, mamma, I say!\"  Her mother never even looked at her, but turned her gaze to the blackened trees, the heaps of ruin along the pavement.  \"O; papa! O, stop, papa! It's me! It's Dotty!\"  Mr. Parlin bent on his runaway daughter a glance of indifference, and called out, in passing,--  \"What strange little girl is this, who seems to know us so well? It _looks_ like my daughter Alice. If it is, she needn't come to my house to-day; she may go and finish her visit at Mrs. Rosenberg's.\"  Then the horse trotted on,--indeed, he had never paused a moment,--and carried both those dear, dear people out of sight.  What did they mean? What had happened to Dotty Dimple, that her own father and mother did not know her?  She looked down at the skirt of her dress, at her gaiters, at her little bare hands, to make sure no wicked fairy had changed her. Not that she suspected any such thing. She understood but too well what her father and mother meant. They knew her, but had not chosen to recognize her, because they were displeased.  Dotty's little heart, the swelling of which had net gone down at all during the night, now ached terribly. She covered her face with her hands, and groaned aloud.  \"Don't,\" said Mandoline, touched with pity. \"They no business to treat you so.\"  \"O, Lina, don't you talk! You don't know anything about it. You never had such a father'n mother's they are! And now they won't let me come into the house!\"  This wail of despair would have melted Mrs. Parlin if she could have heard it. It was only because she thought it necessary to be severe that she had consented to do as her husband advised, and turn coldly away from her dear little daughter. Dotty was a loving child, in spite of her disobedience, and this treatment was almost more than she could bear. She found no consolation in talking with Lina, for she knew Lina could not understand her feelings.  \"She hasn't any Susy and Prudy at her house, nor no _anything_\" thought Dotty. \"If I lived with Mrs. Rosenberg and that dog, I'd want to be locked out; I'd ask if I couldn't. But, O, my darling mamma! I've been naughty too many times! When I'd been naughty fifty, sixty, five hundred times, then she forgave me; but now she can't forgive me any more; it isn't possible.\"  Dotty staggered against a girl who was drawing a baby-carriage, but recovered herself.  \"It isn't possible to forgive me any more. She told me not to go on the water, and I went. She told me not to have temper, and I had it. Every single thing she's told me not to do, I always went and did it. She said, 'I do not wish you to play with Lina Rosenberg;' and then I went right off and played with her. I didn't have a bit good time; but that's nothing. She hided my hat--Lina did; but if I'd gone home, straight home, and not gone to her house, then she couldn't have hided it.  \"I was naughty; I was real naughty; I was as naughty as King Herod and King Pharaoh. Nobody'll ever love me. I'm a poor _orphanless_ child! I've got a father'n mother, but it's just the same as if I didn't, for they won't let me call 'em by it. O, they didn't die, but they won't be any father'n mother to ME!  \"'What strange little girl is this?' that's what my papa said. '_ Looks_ like my daughter Alice!' O, I wish I could die!\"  \"Come, come,\" said Lina; \"let's go home. Mother said you and I might have some macaroni cakes and lager beer, if we wouldn't let the rest of 'em see us at it.\"  \"I don't care anything about your _locker_ beer, Lina Rosenberg, nor your whiskey and tobacco pipes, either. Nor neither, nor nothing,\" added the desolate child, standing \"stock still,\" with the back of her head against a pile of bricks, her eyes closed, and her hands folded across her bosom.  \"There, there; you're a pretty sight now, Dotty Dimple! What if you should freeze so! Come along and behave.\"  \"I can't, I can't!\"  \"If you don't, Dotty, I'll have to go into that barber's shop. I know the man, and I'll make him carry you home _piggerback_\"  \"Well, if I've got to go, I'll go,\" said Dotty, rousing herself, and starting; \"but I'd rather be dead, over'n over; and wish I was; so there!\"     CHAPTER VIII.  PLAYING THIEF.   This day was the longest one to be found in the almanac; it was longer than all the line of railroad from Maine to Indiana and back again.  Dotty shut her lips together, and suffered in silence. But when the afternoon was half spent, it suddenly occurred to her that if she did not go home she should die. Soldiers had died of homesickness, for she had heard her father say so. She had not been able to swallow a mouthful of dinner, and that fact was of itself rather alarming.  \"Perhaps I'm going to have the _typo_. Any way, my head aches. Besides, my papa didn't say I _mustn't_ go home. He said I must finish my visit, and I _have_. O, I've finished _that_ all up, ever and ever and ever so long ago.\"  She and Mandoline went out again to \"brea"]]]
