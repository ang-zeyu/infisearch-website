Running up to this ice house from the ground near the lake, was a long incline, like a toboggan slide, or a long wooden hill. And clanking up this wooden hill was an endless chain, with strips of wood fastened across it.  The chain was something like the moving stairways which are in some department stores instead of elevators. Only, instead of square, flat stairs there were these cross pieces of wood, to hold the cakes of ice from slipping down the toboggan slide back into the lake again.  Men would float the ice cakes up to the end of the wooden hill. Then, with sharp iron hooks, they would pull and haul on the cakes until they were caught on one of these cross pieces. Then the engine that moved this endless chain, would puff and grunt, and up would slide the glittering ice, cake after cake.  At the top of the incline other men were waiting. They used their sharp hooks to pull the ice cakes off the endless chain, upon a platform of boards, and from there the cakes were slid along into the store house, where they were stacked in piles up to the roof, there to stay until they were needed in the hot summer, to make ice cream, lemonade and ice cream cones.  \"Oh, but it is cold in here!\" cried Mab as they went in the place where the ice was kept. And indeed it was, for there were tons and tons--thousands of pounds--of the frozen cakes. From them arose a sort of steam, or mist, and through this mist the men could hardly be seen as they stacked away the ice. The men looked like shadows moving about in a cold fog on a frosty, cold, wintry morning.  \"Bang! Bang! Clatter! Smash! Crash!\" went the cakes of ice as they came up the incline, and slid down the long wooden chutes, where the men hooked them off and piled them up. Pile after pile was made of the ice, until it was stacked up like an ice berg, inside the store house.  \"Why doesn't the ice melt when the hot summer comes?\" asked Hal.  \"Because this building keeps the hot sun off the ice,\" explained the foreman. \"Very little heat can get in our ice house, and it takes heat to melt ice. Of course some of it melts, but very little. Then, too, the building has two walls. In between the double walls is sawdust, and that sawdust helps to keep the heat out, and the cold in. It is like a refrigerator you see. Ice melts very slowly in a refrigerator because the cold is kept in, and the outside heat kept out.\"  \"Oh, but it's cold here!\" cried Mab shivering. \"Let's go outside.\" And outside something very strange happened.  The children never would have believed it had they read it in a book. But as it really happened to them they knew that it was true, no matter how strange it was.     CHAPTER XII  A GREAT SURPRISE   \"How do you get the ice out of this big house when you want it in the summer time?\" asked Hal, as the foreman led them along the wooden platforms out of the big, cold storehouse. And how much warmer it was outside; even if the sun did not shine, than it was in the ice house. The children were glad to come out.  \"We load the ice from here into freight cars,\" the man explained. \"See, the ice house is built in two parts, with a passage-way between. And is this passage is a railroad track. The engine backs a freight car in here, the big doors of the car are opened, and the ice is slid in on wooden chutes, something like the iron chutes the coal man uses. Then, when the car is full, it is pulled down to the city in a long train, with other cars.\"  \"And then the icemen come with their wagons, get the ice and bring it to us,\" finished Mab. \"I've seen them.\"  \"That's right, little lady!\" said the foreman with a laugh. And sometimes ice comes to the city by a boat, instead of in freight cars, and the men with wagons go down to the boat-dock to get the cold, frozen cakes. And now you have seen how ice is cut in winter, and stored away until we need it in the summer.\"  \"My!\" exclaimed Hal, as he looked up at the big ice store-house. \"There must be enough ice in there for the whole world!\"  \"Oh, no indeed!\" cried Daddy Blake. \"No enough for one city. And besides this ice, which is called natural, because Jack Frost and Mother Nature make it, there is other ice, called artificial. That is what is made by machinery.\"  \"Why, can anybody make ice by machinery?\" asked Mab in surprise.  \"Oh, yes, even on the hottest day in summer,\" her papa told her. \"But it takes a lot of machinery. It is done by putting water into small metal tanks, and then by taking all the warmth out of the water by dipping the tanks into a big vat of salt and water which is made very cold by something called ammonia. It is too hard for you to understand now, but when you get older I will explain. Now I think we had better be skating home,\" said Daddy Blake.  As they walked down to the frozen lake, there was a barking sound from a small shed under which was an engine, that hauled up the ice cakes. Out from the shed rushed a little dog, spotted black and white, and straight for the Blake children he rushed, barking and wagging his tail so that it almost wagged off.  \"Look out!\" cried Daddy Blake.  \"Don't be afraid!\" called the engineer, laughing. \"He's so gentle he wouldn't hurt a baby!\"  And how strangely the dog was acting! He would jump up first on Hal, and then on Mab, trying to lick their faces and hands with his red tongue.  \"Oh dear!\" cried Mab, who was a little bit frightened.  \"He won't hurt you!\" exclaimed the engineer. \"Here, Spot!\" he called. \"Leave the children alone. Be good, Spot!\"  But the dog would not mind. He jumped up on Hal, barking as loudly as he could, and wagging his tail so hard that it is a wonder it did not drop off. The animal seemed wild with delight.  \"Why! Why!\" cried Mab, as she looked carefully at the dog when he stood still a moment to rest after all the excitement. \"That dog looks just like our Roly-Poly, only Roly was white and not spotted black and white,\" said Mab.  \"Well, when I got this dog he was all white,\" explained the engineer. \"He got spotted black by accident.\"  \"I wonder if that could be Roly?\" spoke Daddy Blake thoughtfully. \"Here, Roly-Poly!\" he called. \"Come here, sir!\"  In an instant the dog made a jump for Daddy Blake, barking joyfully, and almost turning a somersault.  \"I believe it is Roly!\" shouted Hal. \"It's our dog!\"  \"But how could it be?\" asked Mab. \"Roly was lost under the ice.\"  \"And that's just where I got this dog,\" the engineer explained. \"Out from under the ice. One day, after the first freeze this winter, I was Balking along a little pond. I came to a thin place in the ice, and looking through, from the shore where I stood, I saw a little white dog down below, just as if he were under a pane of glass.  \"I broke the ice with a stick and got him out. I thought he was dead, but I took him home, thawed him out, gave him some hot milk, and soon he was as lively as a cricket. And I've had this dog ever since. When I came here to work at ice cutting I brought him with me.\"  \"But you said he was pure white when you got him out,\" said Daddy Blake wonderingly.  \"Yes, that's right,\" answered the ice engineer. \"So he was. And how he got spotted was like this. I was blacking my boots one day, and I left the bottle of black polish on a low bench. The dog grabbed it, playful like, and the black stuff spilled all over him. That's how he got spotted. He was worse than he is now, but it's wearing off.\"  \"Then I'm sure this is our Roly-Poly!\" cried \"Oh, you dear Roly!\" she cried, and the spotted poodle dog tried to climb up in her arms and kiss her, he was so glad to see her.  \"I believe it is Roly,\" said Daddy Blake. \"It is all very wonderful, but it must be our Roly.\"  \"Well, if he's yours, take him,\" said the engineer kindly. \"I always wondered how he got under the ice. But of course he could not tell me.\"  \"We were skating, the children and I, one day,\" explained Daddy Blake. \"Poor Roly slipped through an air hole in the ice. Then he must have floated down the pond underneath the ice, until he came to another thin place, where you saw him.\"  \"I guess that's it,\" the engineer agreed. \"He was almost drowned and nearly frozen when I found him. But I'm glad he's all right now, and I'm glad the children have him back.\"  \"Oh, and maybe we aren't glad!\" cried Mab. \"Aren't we, Hal?\"  \"Well, I guess!\" he cried. \"The gladdest ever!\"  Roly-Poly was happy too. He was so glad that he did not know whom to love first, nor how much. He raced back and forth from the children to Mr. Blake, and then over to the kind engineer, who had saved his life.  \"Oh, let's hurry home!\" cried Mab. \"I want to show mamma and Aunt Lolly and Uncle Pennywait that Roly-Poly is still alive.\"  And so Daddy Blake and the children skated down to the end of the lake, Roly-Poly running along with them. He had barked his good-byes to the engineer, and Daddy Blake and Hal and Mab had thanked the nice man over and over again.  \"Don't fall through any more air holes, Roly!\" cautioned Hal, as he skated along with Charlie, while Mab glided slowly at the side of Mary.  \"Bow-wow!\" barked Roly, which meant, I suppose, that he would be very careful.  Soon they were all safely home, and Roly-Poly barked louder than ever, and almost wagged off his tail, sideways and up and down.  \"Oh, how wonderful!\" cried Aunt Lolly when she heard the story. \"I knew something would happen. Something wonderful has happened.\"  And so it had. And it was really wonderful that Roly had floated down beneath the ice, and that the engineer had come along just in time to get him out alive.  And so Roly came back, just as I told you he would. In a few weeks the black spots wore off him, and he was all white again, and as lively and frisky as ever, hiding anything he could find, and barking and wagging his tail like anything.  \"Won't all the boys and girls be surprised when they see our dog back again?\" asked Mab.  \"I guess they will,\" agreed Hal. \"It is just like a fairy story; isn't it?\"  \"Oh, it's better"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10220"],["title","Daddy Takes Us Skating (#7)"],["body","a fairy story, for it's true!\" exclaimed Mab. \"If it was a fairy story we would wake up and Roly-Poly wouldn't be here. Oh! I am so glad!\"  Hal and Mab had many more days of skating on the pond with Daddy; Blake. And then, one morning, when they woke up, the ground was deeply covered with white snow.  \"No more skating right away!\" cried Daddy Blake, \"The ice has gone to sleep under white blankets.\"  \"But we can have other fun!\" said Hal.  \"Lots of it!\" cried Mab, joyfully. \"Oh we'll have more fun!\"  And what fun they had with Daddy Blake I will tell you about in the next book, as this one is all filled up. So I will say good-bye to you for a little while, only a little while, though.  THE END  The next volume in this series will be called \"Daddy Takes Us Coasting.\"  It will be about Santa Claus and Christmas."]]]
