For a company luncheon or supper it is not necessary to serve more than a hot dish, a salad, a biscuit or sandwich, a dessert and a beverage. A first course and a relish may be provided if desired.   SUNDAY NIGHT SUPPERS  The following menus were arranged especially as Sunday night suppers, but they are equally suitable for midday luncheons or high teas. Many of the dishes will be found desirable for afternoon teas or evening spreads, and for use in tea and lunch rooms, and for automobile picnics.   PRELIMINARY PREPARATIONS  Preparations for Sunday night suppers should be made on Saturday as far as possible. For a luncheon it is a help to have some things done the day before. For picnics and parties much must be done in advance. As an aid to the hostess we have listed after each menu what these preliminary preparations may be.   COOKING AT THE TABLE  Many of the hot dishes may be prepared in a chafing dish or on an electric grill. For these, much of the measuring may be done in advance, the ingredients being put in small dishes on a tray. Coffee and tea may be made at the table with electric appliances.   SANDWICHES AND BISCUITS  Sandwiches may be made and wrapped first in dry cheesecloth, then in damp cheesecloth, and placed in a covered crock some hours before a meal. The hot biscuits may be replaced by rolls or bread and butter if desired.   AUTOMOBILE PICNICS  For picnics the beverages and hot dishes may be prepared at home and carried in thermos food jars. The cold dishes may be packed in a small portable refrigerator. The biscuits, sandwiches, cakes, and cookies should be carefully wrapped in wax paper and packed in boxes. Ice creams may be taken in the freezer. Hot sandwiches and bacon may be cooked over the coals or on a portable oil or alcohol stove. In some menus it may be desirable to omit or modify a few of the dishes, if food is to be carried several miles.   MARKET ORDERS  Supplies for use on Sunday evening should, of course, be purchased on Saturday. To prevent any mistakes in ordering we have listed under each menu the foodstuffs that will be required. Supplies that are usually kept on hand are not listed, as    Baking powder   Cayenne   Cornstarch   Bread flour   Pastry flour   Molasses   Mustard   Paprika   Pepper   Rock salt   Table salt   Granulated sugar   Soda   Spices, whole and ground   Table sauce   Vanilla   Vinegar     HOW TO BUY  Some things are listed in the market orders that many people always have on hand. This is for the benefit of those who do not prepare all their meals and have little space for seldom used supplies. As far as feasible the amounts of material in the market orders are such as could be purchased. They may differ somewhat from the amounts called for in the recipes, thus leaving some foodstuff on hand. In many cases it may be more economical to purchase in larger quantities than those given. In some cases smaller amounts are called for than can be purchased, as one-half can, or one-fourth cup, in case supplies on hand are adequate without purchasing more than required. Butter only is given in the market orders. In cooking, margarine, lard, and other shortenings may be used instead, if preferred.     MEASUREMENTS  In all recipes measurements are made level. Measuring cups, divided into thirds and quarters, are used, and tea and table measuring spoons. Cups of dry material are filled to overflowing by putting the material into the cup with a tablespoon, and are then leveled off with a knife. Tea and tablespoons are filled heaping with dry material, and then leveled off with a knife. Flour should be sifted once before measuring.     RECIPES AND MENUS  The recipes are planned to serve eight persons. Most of them may be divided for a smaller party.  The average cost of the menus is fifty cents per person. Some of the dishes may be made less expensive and rich by substituting milk for cream, and by other substitutions and omissions that will suggest themselves to the resourceful hostess. Many types of dishes are given. Many variations are possible.  In some menus a choice of dishes is suggested. A few recipes are given that are not called for in the menus. These are usually to show how to utilize in a different way something for which a recipe is given or to use in another meal some foodstuff left from a recipe.  These recipes and menus have all been tested at Miss Farmer's School of Cookery. The author wishes to express here her appreciation of the painstaking work of all the members of the staff of the school who have assisted in making this little book possible.

If grapes are firm, boiling water may be poured over them and allowed to stand 1 minute, when skins will come off easily.  Pare   2 oranges, removing white part with the skin, and remove sections free from membrane.  Cut   4 slices canned pineapple in dice. Mix the fruit with   1/3 cup sugar   1 tablespoon lemon juice   1/2 cup orange juice   1/2 cup syrup from canned pineapple, and   Few grains salt. Put into ice cream freezer, surround with ice and salt, and stir occasionally until juice begins to freeze. Serve in cocktail glasses, garnishing each glass with a   Maraschino cherry.  [Illustration: FRUIT CUP]    HOT HAM SANDWICHES  Put   1 pound cooked ham through food chopper. Add   4 tablespoons creamed butter,   1 teaspoon mustard and   1 teaspoon paprika, and mix well. Cut Bread in sixteen 1/4-inch slices, spread eight slices bread with the ham mixture, cover with remaining bread and press slices firmly together. Cut each sandwich in three strips. Beat   2 eggs slightly and add   2 cups milk. Dip sandwiches, one at a time, in this mixture, and saut√© in butter, cooking on one side until browned, and then turning and browning the other side. Serve very hot.  Other meat, or marmalade or jam may be used in sandwiches in place of ham.  [Illustration: HOT HAM SANDWICHES]    GRAPE OR CURRANT JELLY  Wash and pick over   Fruit. Crush in kettle one layer at a time and boil, stirring frequently, until juice is extracted from pulp. Let drip through double piece of cheesecloth, rinsed in cold water, over night or till juice no longer drips. Do not squeeze. To   1 tablespoon juice add   1 tablespoon alcohol; stir and let stand 10 minutes. If 2/3 of the mixture is cloudy use   2/3 cup sugar to each cup juice. If all is cloudy use equal parts sugar and juice. (This is called the Pectin Test.) Be sure that juice mixed with alcohol is discarded immediately. Measure remaining juice into kettle, bring to boiling point, add required amount of sugar and cook to 220 degrees F. or until mixture will show two distinct, firm drops when dripped from side of spoon, or when small amount will become firm when dropped on very cold saucer. Then skim and pour into sterilized glasses.   _Second Extraction_  Return fruit pulp to kettle, add barely enough cold water to cover it, bring slowly to boiling point, stirring to prevent burning on; cook 5 minutes, drain and finish as for first extraction, boiling 5 minutes before adding the sugar.   _Third Extraction_  Proceed as for second extraction. Oftentimes the juice from second and third extractions may be combined before being made up into jelly. By making three extractions the amount of jelly obtainable from a given amount of fruit may be almost doubled.    TOMATO SALAD WITH CHEESE DRESSING  Cut   4 tomatoes in halves in such a way that they come apart in points. Arrange each half in a nest of   Lettuce leaves. In the center of tomato pile   Cream cheese forced through a coarse strainer. In center of cheese put a Few bits of green pepper finely chopped. Serve with cheese dressing.

COCOA ICE CREAM  Mix very thoroughly   1/2 cup dry powdered cocoa   Few grains salt   1 cup sugar and   1 tablespoon cornstarch. Add slowly   2 cups milk, scalded, and cook over boiling water 20 minutes, stirring until thickened and occasionally afterward. Pour over   2 eggs well beaten, chill, and add   2 cups cream beaten stiff   1 teaspoon vanilla and   1 cup syrup drained from canned raspberries or strawberries, and freeze.  If frozen in a vacuum freezer, put mixture in center can of freezer; cover, invert freezer, and fill outer compartment with finely crushed ice mixed with half the amount of rock salt. Open the freezer occasionally, scrape cream from sides and mix well, using a long-bladed knife. If frozen in an ordinary freezer, it is not necessary to beat the cream. Put mixture in can of ice cream freezer, surround with three parts ice and one part salt.  Let mixture stand 5 minutes, then turn crank slowly until mixture is stiff. When frozen drain off ice water and repack, using four parts ice and one part salt.    FIG MARGUERITES  Put in top of double boiler   7/8 cup sugar and   3 tablespoons water.

Add   1 egg white, unbeaten. Place over hot water and cook, beating constantly with egg beater for 7 to 12 minutes or until mixture will hold its shape.  Add   1 tablespoon marshmallow cream and   1/4 teaspoon vanilla, and fold over and over until again stiff enough to hold its shape. Add   1/3 cup (3) figs cut in small pieces and   1/3 cup nut meats cut in small pieces. Pile on  Small round crackers and bake at 375 degrees F. for 10 minutes or until delicately brown. This rule will cover 3 dozen small crackers. Should frosting be too soft to hold its shape after adding marshmallow cream, it may be again placed over hot water, and folded gently over and over, until it becomes slightly granular around the edges. Remove from hot water, and continue folding over gently until of the desired stiffness.    MARSHMALLOW FROSTING  Use above mixture with or without figs and nuts as a cake filling or frosting. It need not be baked.    CANDIED MINT LEAVES  Wipe   Fresh mint leaves, remove from stems and rub each leaf gently with the finger dipped in   Egg white slightly beaten. Mix 3 tablespoons granulated sugar with 3 drops oil of spearmint, and sift over each side of the mint leaves.

TEA  Half fill a perforated tea spoon or tea ball with   Orange Pekoe, or other preferred tea. Place in cup, add fresh   Boiling water, until cup is two-thirds full. Remove tea spoon as soon as tea is of the desired strength.  Two or three cups of tea can usually be made without emptying and refilling the tea spoon.          *       *       *       *       *   MENU II  Grapefruit Baskets with Mints Open Cheese and Bacon Sandwich Mixed Sweet Pickles Crab Meat and Tomato Jelly Salad Egg Biscuits Orange Layer Cake Iced Coffee with Vanilla    PRELIMINARY PREPARATIONS  Grapefruit prepared and put on ice Cheese grated (or chopped) for sandwiches Bacon cut same length as bread slices Pickles may be made at any time Tomato jelly and mayonnaise dressing made Eggs, hard cooked Celery (or endive) cut and put in cold water Crab meat picked over and put on ice Lettuce washed and put on ice in cheesecloth Cake baked and one layer frosted Cake filling made, except the whipped cream Dry ingredients and shortening for biscuits combined    MARKET ORDER  1/2 pound crab meat 3/4 pound bacon 3/4 pound cheese 1/2 pint milk 1 pint cream 3/4 pound butter 1 dozen eggs 1/2 pint salad oil 4 grapefruit 1 head lettuce 2 roots celery or 1/2 pound endive 5 oranges 2 lemons 1 green pepper 1 onion 1/4 can (1/2 pint) tomatoes 2 ounces (8) cream peppermints 1/4 pound cluster raisins 1 loaf bread 1/4 pound candied cherries 1 1/2 doz. small sweet cucumber pickles 2 yards narrow ribbon Small fresh flowers or fresh mint leaves 1/2 package gelatin 1/4 pound finely ground coffee    GRAPEFRUIT BASKETS  Cut in two   4 grapefruit.
