I wonder old Welsby doesn't get another man.\"  \"His son's a _what?_\" asked Diggory; but at that moment Acton came marching round the room ordering every one out into the playground, and Jack Vance hurried off to get his cap and muffler without replying to the question.  Sliding was out of the question, and the \"House of Lords\" having amused themselves for a time by capturing small boys and throwing them into the snow-drift, some one remarked that it would be good fun to build a snow man; which proposition was received with acclamation, and all hands were soon hard at work rolling the big balls which were to form the base of the statue.  As the work progressed the interest in it increased, the more so when Diggory suggested that the figure should be supposed to represent the obnoxious Noaks, and that the company could then relieve their feelings by pelting his effigy as soon as it was completed. Every one was pleased with the project, and even Acton, who as a rule would never follow up any plan which was not of his own making, took special pains to cause the snow man to bear some likeness to the original.  He had just, by way of a finishing touch, expended nearly half a penny bottle of red ink in a somewhat exaggerated reproduction of the fiery hue of Noaks's nose, when the bell rang for afternoon school, and the bombardment had to be postponed until the following day.  It was no small trial of patience being thus obliged to wait nearly twenty-four hours before wreaking their vengeance on the effigy; still there was no help for it.  The boys bottled down their feelings, and when at last the classes were dismissed, and the dux cried, \"Come on, you fellows!\" every one obeyed the summons willingly enough.  There had been a slight thaw in the night, and the statue stood in need of some trifling repairs.  Acton suggested, therefore, that the half-hour before dinner should be devoted to putting things to rights, and to making some small additions in the shape of pebbles for waistcoat buttons, and other trifling adornments.  Mr. Welsby kept the boys at the table for nearly a quarter of an hour after the meal was finished, talking over his plans for the coming term, and when at last he finished there was a regular stampede for the playground.  Acton was leading the rush; he dashed through the garden doorway, and then stopped dead with an exclamation of dismay.  All those who followed, as they arrived on the spot, did the same.  Every vestige of the snow man, which had been left barely an hour ago standing such a work of art, had disappeared.  Certainly a portion of the pedestal still remained, looking like the stump of an old, decayed tooth; but the figure itself had been thrown down, trodden flat, and literally stamped out of existence!  The little crowd stood for a moment speechless, gazing with woebegone expressions on their faces at the wreck of their hopes and handiwork; then the silence was broken by a subdued chuckle coming from the other side of the wall on their left, and every one, with a start and a sudden clinching of fists, cried simultaneously: \"The Philistines!\"  The words had hardly been uttered when above the brickwork appeared the head and shoulders of a boy a size or so bigger than Acton; a dirty-looking brown bowler hat was stuck on the very back of his head, and rammed down until the brim rested on the top of his ears; and it will be quite sufficient to remark that his face was in exact keeping with the manner in which he wore his hat.  Once more everybody gave vent to their feelings by another involuntary ejaculation--\"Young Noaks!\"  The stranger laughed, pulled a face which, as far as ugliness went, was hardly an improvement on the one Nature had already bestowed upon him, and then pointed mockingly at the remains of the masterpiece.  His triumph, however, was short-lived.  Jack Vance, as he left the house, had caught up a double handful of snow, which he had been pressing into a hard ball as he ran down the path, determining in his own, mind to be the first to open fire on the snow man.  Without a moment's hesitation he flung the missile at the intruder's head, and, to the intense delight of his companions, it struck the latter fairly on the mouth, causing him to lose his precarious foothold on the wall and fall back into the road.  It needed no further warning to inform the Birchites that the Philistines were upon them, and every one set to work to lay in a stock of snowballs as fast as hands could make them.  \"Look out!\" cried Kennedy.  Young Noaks's face rose once more above the top of the wall, and the next moment a big stone, the size of hen's egg, whizzed past Diggory's head, and struck the garden door with a sounding bang.  \"Oh, the cad!\" cried Acton; \"let's go for him.\"  The whole garrison combined in making a vigorous sortie into the road; but it was only to find the enemy in full retreat, and a few dropping shots at long range ended the skirmish.  \"I say, Vance,\" exclaimed Diggory, \"who are they?  Who are these fellows?\"  Now, as the aforesaid Philistines play rather an Important part in the opening chapters of our story, I propose to answer the question myself, in such a way that the reader may be enabled to take a more intelligent interest in the chain of events which commenced with the destruction of the snow man; and in order that this may be done in a satisfactory manner, I will in a few words map out the ground on which this memorable campaign was afterwards conducted.  Take the well-known drawing of two right angles In Euclid's definition, and imagine the horizontal line to be the main road to Chatford, while the perpendicular one standing on it is a  by-way called Locker's lane. In the right angle stood The Birches; the house itself faced the Chatford road, while behind it, in regular succession, came first the sloping garden, then the walled-in playground, and then the small field in which were attempted such games of cricket and football as the limited number of pupils would permit.  There were three doors in the playground--one the entrance from the garden, another opening into the lane, and a third into the field, the two latter being usually kept locked.  Locker's Lane was a short cut to Chatford, yet Rule 21 in The Birches Statute-Book ordained that no boy should either go or return by this route when visiting the town; the whole road was practically put out of bounds, and the reason for this regulation was as follows:  At the corner of the playing field the lane took a sharp turn, and about a quarter of a mile beyond this stood a large red-brick house, shut in on three sides by a high wall, whereon, close to the heavy double doors which formed the entrance, appeared a board bearing in big letters the legend--                        HORACE HOUSE,                  Middle-Class School for Boys.                           A. PHILLIPS, B.A., Head-master.  The pupils of Mr. Phillips had been formerly called by Mr. Welsby's boys the Phillipians, which title had in time given place to the present nickname of the Philistines.  I have no doubt that the average boy turned out by Horace House was as good a fellow, taking him all round, as the average boy produced by The Birches; and that, if they had been thrown together in one school, they would, for the most part, have made very good friends and comrades. However, in fairness both to them and to their rivals, it must be said that at the period of our story Mr. Phillips seemed for some time past to have been unusually unfortunate in his elder boys: they were undoubtedly \"cads,\" and the character of the whole establishment, as far as the scholars were concerned, naturally yielded to the influence of its leaders.  It had been customary every term for the Birchites to play a match against them either at cricket or football; but their conduct during a visit paid to the ground of the latter, back in the previous summer, had been so very ungentlemanly and unsportsmanlike that, when the next challenge arrived for an encounter at football, Mr. Welsby wrote back a polite note expressing regret that he did not see his way clear to permit a continuation of the matches.  This was the signal for an outbreak of open hostilities between the two schools: the Philistines charged the Birchites in the open street with being afraid to meet them in the field.  These base insinuations led to frequent exchanges of taunts and uncomplimentary remarks; and, last of all, matters were brought to a climax by a stand-up fight between Tom Mason, Acton's predecessor as dux, and young Noaks.  The encounter took place just outside the stronghold of the enemy, the Birchite so far getting the best of it that at the end of a five minutes' engagement he proclaimed his victory by dragging his adversary along by the collar and bumping his head a number of times against the very gates of Horace House. Unfortunately a rumour of what had happened got to the ears of Mr. Welsby.  Mason was severely reprimanded, and his companions were forbidden, under pain of heavy punishment, to walk in Locker's Lane further than the corner of their own playing field.  \"But who is young Noaks?\" asked Diggory, as Jack Vance finished a hasty account of this warfare with the Philistines.  \"Why, that's just the funny part of it,\" returned the other.  \"This Sam Noaks is the son of our Noaks, but he's got an uncle, called Simpson, who lives at Todderton, where I come from.  This man Simpson made a lot of money out in Australia, and when he came back to England he adopted young Noaks, and sends him here to Phillips's school.\"  By this time the home forces had all struggled back into the playground. In one corner stood a wooden shed containing a carpenter's bench, a chest for bats and stumps, and various other things belonging to different boys.  Acton, as head of the school, kept the key, and having unfastened the door, summoned his followers inside to hold an impromptu council of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10027"],["title","The Triple Alliance, Its Trials and Triumphs (#4)"],["body","and discuss the situation.  There was a grave expression on each face, for every one felt that things were beginning to look serious.  Mason, the only one of their number who had been physically equal to the leaders of their opponents, was no longer among them, and the enemy, evidently aware of their helpless condition, had dared for the first time to actually come and beard them in their own den.  \"What I want to know first is this,\" began Acton.  \"You can see by the footmarks that they came in through that door; of course it's always kept locked, and here's the key hanging up inside the shed.  Now who opened it for them, and how was it done?\"  \"Perhaps it wasn't fastened,\" suggested Morris.  \"Yes, it was,\" answered Kennedy excitedly.  \"I noticed that this morning, when we were picking up stones for the snow man's buttons.\"  \"Then I tell you what it is,\" continued Acton solemnly: \"some one here's playing us false, and my belief is it's old Noaks.  D'you remember last term when Mason and Jack Vance and I made a plot for going down and throwing crackers into their yard?  Well, they must have heard of it from some one; for they were all lying in wait for us behind the wall, and as soon as we got near to it they threw cans of water over us and pelted us with stones.\"  There was a murmur of suppressed wrath at the memory of the fate of this gallant expedition.  \"Yes,\" added Shaw, \"and I believe some one told them about this snow man.\"  \"Well, one thing's certain,\" said Acton--\"we must serve 'em out somehow for knocking it down.  They evidently think now Mason's gone they can do what they like, and that we shall be afraid of them.  Now what can we do?\"  There was a silence; every one felt that a serious crisis had arrived in the history of the Birchites, and that unless some immediate steps were taken to avenge this insult they would no longer be free men, but live in constant terror of the Philistines;--every one, I say, felt that some bold action must be taken, yet nobody had a suggestion to make.  \"Well, look here,\" said Acton, \"something's got to be done.  We must all think it over, and we'll have another meeting in a week's time; then if any one's made a plan, we'll talk it over and decide what's to be done.\"  \"Jack,\" said Diggory two evenings later, \"you know what Acton said about the Philistines; well, I've got part of a plan in my head, but I shan't tell you what it is till Wednesday.\"    CHAPTER III.   DISCOMFITURE OF THE PHILISTINES.  On Wednesday afternoon, as soon as dinner was over, Acton summoned his followers to attend the council of war which was to decide what reprisals should be taken on the Philistines for the destruction of the snow man.  Every one felt the importance of a counter-attack, for unless something of the kind were attempted, as Acton remarked in his opening speech, \"they'll think we're funky of them, and they'll simply come down here as often as they like, and worry us to death.\"  \"Couldn't we tell Mr. Welsby?\" suggested Butler, a timid small boy belonging to the \"Dogs' Home.\"  \"Tell Mr. Welsby!\" cried half a dozen voices in withering tones; \"of course not!\"  It was well known by both parties that whenever the real state of affairs became known to their respective head-masters, the war would come to an abrupt termination; and the great reason why each side forbore to make any open complaint against the other was undoubtedly because every one secretly enjoyed the excitement of the campaign, and felt that a peace would make life rather dull and uninteresting.  \"The thing that licks us,\" said Acton, \"is what I was speaking about last week: somehow or other, they always seem to know just what we're up to, and it's no use our doing anything, because they're always prepared. Some one's acting the spy.  I can't think it's any of you fellows, but I believe it's old Noaks.  You see his son's there, and for some reason or other he seems to hate every one here like poison.  Now, what are we to do?\"  There was a silence, broken at length by Diggory Trevanock.  \"I don't know what you think,\" he began, \"but it seems to me it's no use making any plans until we find out who tells 'em to the Philistines. I should say that Noaks is the fellow who does it, but we ought to make certain.\"  \"Yes, but how are we to do it?\" asked Acton, laughing; \"that's just what I want to know.\"  \"Well, I've got a bit of a plan,\" returned the other, \"only I should like to tell it you in private.\"  \"All right,\" answered the dux; \"come on outside.  Now, then, what is it?\"  \"Why,\" said Diggory, \"it's this (I didn't want the other chaps to hear, because then it'll prove who's the spy).  You say the last time you went down to throw some crackers over the wall they were all lying in wait for you.  Well, let you and me go into the boot-room when Noaks is at work there, and pretend to make a plan as though we were going to do it again to-morrow night; then two of us might go down and see if they're prepared.  If so, it must have been Noaks who told them, because no one else knows about it.  I'll go for one, and Jack Vance'll go for another. I'll tell him to keep it dark, and you can let us in and out of the door.\"  \"Oh--ah!\" said Acton, \"that isn't a bad idea; at all events we'll try it.\"  The project was put into immediate execution.  That same afternoon, just before tea, Acton and Diggory discussed the bogus plan in Noaks's hearing, while Jack Vance, having been admitted into their confidence and sworn to secrecy, willingly agreed to go out with Diggory and form the reconnoitering party which was to report on the movements of the enemy.  \"I knew you'd come,\" said the latter; \"and we'll show them what sort of stuff the Triple Alliance is made of.\"  On the following evening, as soon as tea was over, the two friends slipped off down into the playground, where they were joined a minute later by Acton, who, unlocking the shed, took down from the peg on which it hung the key of the door in the outer wall.  \"You'll have plenty of time,\" he said, glancing at his watch, \"and with this moonlight you'll soon be able to see if they're about.  I'll keep the door, and let you in when you come back.\"  The next moment the two members of the Alliance were trotting down Locker's Lane.  It was a bright, frosty night, and the hard ground rang beneath their feet like stone.  They turned off on to the grass, lest the noise should give the enemy warning of their approach; and when within about a hundred yards of Horace House, pulled up to consider for a moment what their plan of action should be, before proceeding any further.  \"I don't see any one,\" said Jack Vance.  \"Perhaps they are hiding,\" answered Diggory.  \"Look here! let's get into this field and run down on the other side of the hedge until we get opposite the gate.\"  The stronghold of the Philistines was silent as the grave.  The two chums crouched behind a thick bush, and peering through its leafless branches could see nothing but the closed double doors, and a stretch of blank wall on either side.  \"There's no one about,\" whispered Vance; \"I don't believe old Noaks has told them.\"  \"Wait a minute,\" answered Diggory.  \"I'll see if I can stir any of them;\" and so saying, he knelt up, and cried in an audible voice, \"Now, then, are you all ready?\"  Diggory and Jack Vance dropped flat on their stomachs, for the words had hardly been uttered when the doors were flung open, and at least ten of the Philistines rushed out into the road with a yell of defiance. Many of them were bigger than Acton, and what would have been the fate of the two Birchites had they kept to the road instead of acting on Diggory's suggestion of advancing under cover of the hedge, one hardly dares to imagine.  \"Hullo!\" cried young Noaks, who had headed the sortie.  \"There's nobody here, and yet I'll swear I heard them somewhere.\"  \"So did I,\" answered another voice; \"they must have cut and run.\"  \"There's no place for them to run to,\" returned Noaks; \"they must be behind that hedge.--Come out of it, you skunks!\"  A big stone came crashing through the twigs within a yard of Diggory's head.  The two boys crouched close to the low earth bank and held their breath.  \"They must be about somewhere,\" cried Noaks.  \"I knew they were coming, and I'm sure I heard some one say, 'Are you ready?'  They're behind that hedge.  We can't get through, it's too thick; but you fellows stop here, and I and Hogson and Bernard'll run down to the gate and cut off their retreat.\"  \"What shall we do?\" whispered Jack; \"this field's so large they'll run us down before we get to the other hedge.  Shall we make a bolt and chance it?\"  Diggory was just about to reply in the affirmative, when help came from an unexpected quarter.  \"What are you boys doing out here at this time?\" cried a loud, stern voice.--\"Noaks, what are you about down the road there?--Come in this moment, every one of you!\"  \"Saved!\" whispered Jack Vance, in an ecstasy of delight as the Philistines trooped back through the double doors.  \"That was old Phillips.  I hope he gives Noaks a jolly good 'impot.'  That chap is a cad,\" continued the speaker, as they hurried back towards The Birches: \"when he can't do anything else, he chucks stones like he did to-night. The wonder is he hasn't killed some one before now.  I don't see how it's possible for the Philistines to show up well when they've got a chap like him bossing the show.\"  The bell for evening preparation was ringing as they reached The Birches, and only a very few hasty replies could be given to Acton's eager inquiries as they rushed together up the garden path.  In the little interval before supper, however, the subject was resumed in a quiet corner of the passage.  \"So it must have been old Noaks who told them,\" said Acton; \"that's proved without a doubt.  I vote we go and have a jolly row with him to-morrow morning.\"  \"No, I shouldn't do that,\" answered Diggory; \"don't let him know that we've found him out.\"  \"Well,"]]]
