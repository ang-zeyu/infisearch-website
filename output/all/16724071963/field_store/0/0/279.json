Between the village and the inlet, and half a mile from the great \"bay,\" lay the Kinzer farm. Beyond the bay was a sandbar, and beyond that the Atlantic Ocean; for all this was on the southerly shore of Long Island.  The Kinzer farm had lain right there--acre for acre, no more, no less--on the day when Hendrik Hudson long ago sailed the good ship \"Half Moon\" into New-York Bay. But it was not then known to any one as the Kinzer farm. Neither was there then, as now, any bright and growing village crowding up on one side of it, with a railway-station and a post-office. Nor was there, at that time, any great and busy city of New York, only a few hours' ride away, over on the island of Manhattan. The Kinzers themselves were not there then. But the bay and the inlet, with the fish and the crabs, and the ebbing and flowing tides, were there, very much the same, before Hendrik Hudson and his brave Dutchmen knew any thing whatever about that corner of the world.  The Kinzer farm had always been a reasonably \"fat\" one, both as to size and quality; and the good people who lived on it had generally been of a somewhat similar description. It was, therefore, every way correct and becoming for Dabney Kinzer's widowed mother and his sisters to be the plump and hearty beings they were, and all the more discouraging to poor Dabney that no amount of regular and faithful eating seemed to make him resemble them at all in that respect.  Mrs. Kinzer excused his thinness, to her neighbors, to be sure, on the ground that he was \"such a growing boy;\" but, for all that, he caught himself wondering, now and then, if he would never be done with that part of his trials. For rapid growth has its trials.  \"The fact is,\" he said to himself one day, as he leaned over the north fence, \"I'm more like Ham Morris's farm than I am like ours. His farm is bigger than ours, all round; but it's too big for its fences, just as I'm too big for my clothes. Ham's house is three times as large as ours, but it looks as if it had grown too fast. It hasn't any paint to speak of, nor any blinds. It looks as if somebody'd just built it there, and then forgot it, and gone oft and left it out of doors.\"  Dabney's four sisters had all come into the world before him; but he was as tall as any of them, and was frequently taken by strangers for a good two years older than he was. It was sometimes very hard for him, a boy of fifteen, to live up to what was expected of those extra two years.  Mrs. Kinzer still kept him in roundabouts; but they did not seem to hinder his growth at all, if that was her object in so doing.  There was no such thing, however, as keeping the four girls in roundabouts of any kind; and, what between them and their mother, the pleasant and tidy little Kinzer homestead, with its snug parlor and its cosey bits of rooms and chambers, seemed to nestle away, under the shadowy elms and sycamores, smaller and smaller with every year that came.  It was a terribly tight fit for such a family, anyway; and, now that Dabney was growing at such a rate, there was no telling what they would all come to. But Mrs. Kinzer came at last to the rescue; and she summoned her eldest daughter, Miranda, to her aid.  A very notable woman was the widow. When the new railway cut off part of the old farm, she had split up the slice of land between the iron track and the village into \"town lots,\" and had sold them all off by the time the railway company paid her for the \"damage\" it had done the property.  The whole Kinzer family gained visibly in plumpness that year, except, perhaps, Dabney.  Of course the condition and requirements of Ham Morris and his big farm, just over the north fence, had not escaped such a pair of eyes as those of the widow; and the very size of his great barn of a house finally settled his fate for him.  A large, quiet, unambitious, but well-brought-up and industrious young man was Hamilton Morris, and he had not the least idea of the good in store for him for several months after Mrs. Kinzer decided to marry him to her daughter Miranda; but all was soon settled. Dab, of course, had nothing to do with the wedding arrangements, and Ham's share was somewhat contracted. Not but what he was at the Kinzer house a good deal; nor did any of the other girls tell Miranda how very much he was in the way. He could talk, however; and one morning, about a fortnight before the day appointed, he said to Miranda and her mother,--  \"We can't have so very much of a wedding: your house is so small, and you've chocked it so full of furniture. Right down nice furniture it is too; but there's so much of it, I'm afraid the minister'll have to stand out in the front yard.\"  \"The house'll do for this time,\" replied Mrs. Kinzer. \"There'll be room enough for everybody. What puzzles me is Dab.\"  \"What about Dab?\" asked Ham.  \"Can't find a thing to fit him,\" said Dab's mother. \"Seems as if he were all odd sizes, from head to foot.\"  \"Fit him?\" exclaimed Ham. \"Oh, you mean ready-made goods! Of course you can't. He'll have to be measured by a tailor, and have his new suit built for him.\"  \"Such extravagance!\" emphatically remarked Mrs. Kinzer.  \"Not for rich people like you, and for a wedding,\" replied Ham; \"and Dab's a growing boy. Where is he now? I'm going to the village, and I'll take him right along with me.\"  There seemed to be no help for it; but that was the first point relating to the wedding, concerning which Ham Morris was permitted to have exactly his own way. His success made Dab Kinzer a fast friend of his for life, and that was something. There was also something new and wonderful to Dabney himself, in walking into a tailor's shop, picking out cloth to please himself, and being so carefully measured all over. He stretched and stretched himself in all directions, to make sure nothing should turn out too small. At the end of it all, Ham said to him,--  \"Now, Dab, my boy, this suit is to be a present from me to you, on Miranda's account.\"  Dab colored and hesitated for a moment: but it seemed all right, he thought; and so he came frankly out with,--  \"Thank you, Ham. You always was a prime good fellow. I'll do as much for you some day. Tell you what I'll do, then: I'll have another suit made right away, of this other cloth, and have the bill for that one sent to our folks.\"  \"Do it!\" exclaimed Ham. \"Do it! You've your mother's orders for that. She's nothing to do with my gift.\"  \"Splendid!\" almost shouted Dab. \"Oh, but don't I hope they'll fit!\"  \"Vit,\" said the tailor: \"vill zay vit? I dell you zay vit you like a knife. You vait und zee.\"  Dab failed to get a very clear idea of what the fit would be, but it made him almost hold his breath to think of it.  After the triumphant visit to the tailor, there was still a necessity for a call upon the shoemaker, and that was a matter of no small importance. Dab's feet had always been a mystery and a trial to him. If his memory contained one record darker than another, it was the endless history of his misadventures with boots and shoes. He and leather had been at war from the day he left his creeping-clothes until now. But now he was promised a pair of shoes that would be sure to fit.  So the question of Dab's personal appearance at the wedding was all arranged between him and Ham; and Miranda smiled more sweetly than ever before upon the latter, after she had heard her usually silent brother break out so enthusiastically about him as he did that evening.  It was a good thing for that wedding, that it took place in fine summer weather; for neither kith, kin, nor acquaintances had been slighted in the invitations, and the Kinzers were one of the \"oldest families.\"  To have gathered them all under the roof of that house, without either stretching it out wider or boiling the guests down, would have been out of the question; and so the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10340"],["title","Dab Kinzer: A Story of a Growing Boy (#1)"],["body","jority, with Dabney in his new clothes to keep them countenance, stood out in the cool shade of the grand old trees during the ceremony, which was performed near the open door; and were afterwards served with the refreshments in a style which spoke volumes for Mrs. Kinzer's good management, as well as for her hospitality.  The only drawback to Dab's happiness that day was that his acquaintances hardly seemed to know him. He had had almost the same trouble with himself, when he looked in the glass that morning.  Ordinarily, his wrists were several inches through his coat-sleeves, and his ankles made a perpetual show of his stockings. His neck, too, seemed to be holding his head as far as possible from his coat-collar, and his buttons had no favors to ask of his button-holes.  Now, even as the tailor had promised, he had received his \"first fit.\" He seemed to himself, to tell the truth, to be covered up in a prodigal waste of new cloth. Would he ever, ever, grow too big for such a suit of clothes as that? It was a very painful thought, and he did his best to put it away from him.  Still, it was a little hard to have a young lady, whom he had known since before she began to walk, remark to him,--  \"Excuse me, sir, but can you tell me if Mr. Dabney Kinzer is here?\"  \"No, Jenny Walters,\" sharply responded Dab, \"he isn't here.\"  \"Why, Dabney!\" exclaimed the pretty Jenny. \"Is that you? I declare, you have scared me out of a year's growth!\"  \"I wish you'd scare me, then,\" said Dab. \"Then my clothes would stay fitted.\"  Every thing had been so well arranged beforehand, thanks to Mrs. Kinzer, that the wedding had no chance at all except to go off well. Ham Morris was rejoiced to find how entirely he was relieved of every responsibility.  \"Don't worry about your house,\" the widow said to him, the night before the wedding. \"We'll go over there, as soon as you and Miranda get away, and it'll be all ready for you by the time you get back.\"  \"All right,\" said Ham. \"I'll be glad to have you take the old place in hand. I've only tried to live in a corner of it. You don't know how much room there is. I don't, I must say.\"  Dabney had longed to ask her if she meant to have it moved over to the Kinzer side of the north fence, but he had doubts as to the propriety of it; and just then the boy came in from the tailor's with his bundle of new clothes.      CHAPTER II.  DAB'S OLD CLOTHES GET A NEW BOY TO FIT.   Hamilton Morris was a very promising young man, of some thirty summers. He had been an \"orphan\" for a dozen years; and the wonder was that he should so long have lived alone in the big, square-built house his father left him. At all events, Miranda Kinzer was just the wife for him.  Miranda's mother had seen that at a glance, the moment her mind was settled about the house. As to that and his great, spreading, half-cultivated farm, all either of them needed was ready money and management.  These were blessings Ham was now made reasonably sure of, on his return from his wedding-trip, and he was likely to appreciate them.  As for Dabney Kinzer, he was in no respect overcome by the novelty and excitement of the wedding-day. All the rest of it, after the departure of Ham Morris and the bride, he devoted himself to such duties as were assigned him, with a new and grand idea steadily taking shape in his mind. He felt as if his brains too, like his body, were growing. Some of his mother's older and more intimate friends remained with her all day, probably to comfort her for the loss of Miranda; and two or three of them, Dab knew, would stay to tea, so that his services would be in demand to see them safely home.  All day long, moreover, Samantha and Keziah and Pamela seemed to find themselves wonderfully busy, one way and another, so that they paid even less attention than usual to any of the ins and outs of their brother.  Dabney was therefore able, with little difficulty, to take for himself whatever of odd time he might require for putting his new idea into execution.  Mrs. Kinzer herself noticed the rare good sense with which her son hurried through with his dinner, and slipped away, leaving her in undisturbed possession of the table and her lady guests, and neither she nor either of the girls had a thought of following him.  If they had done so, they might have seen him draw a good-sized bundle out from under the lilac-thicket in the back yard, and hurry down through the garden.  A few moments more, and Dabney had appeared on the fence of the old cross-road leading down to the shore. There he sat, eying one passer-by after another, till he suddenly sprang from his perch, exclaiming,--  \"That's just the chap! Why, they'll fit him, and that's more'n they ever did for me.\"  Dab would probably have had to search along the coast for miles before he could have found a human being better suited to his present charitable purposes than the boy who now came so lazily down the road.  There was no doubt about his color, or that he was all over of about the same shade of black. His old tow trowsers and calico shirt revealed the shining fact in too many places to leave room for a question, and shoes he had none.  \"Dick,\" said Dabney, \"was you ever married?\"  \"Married!\" exclaimed Dick, with a peal of very musical laughter, \"is I married? No. Is you?\"  \"No,\" replied Dabney; \"but I was very near it, this morning.\"  \"Dat so?\" asked Dick, with another show of his white teeth. \"Done ye good, den; nebber seen ye I look so nice afore.\"  \"You'd look nicer'n I do if you were only dressed up,\" said Dab. \"Just you put on these.\"  \"Golly!\" exclaimed the black boy. But he seized the bundle Dab threw him, and he had it open in a twinkling.  \"Any t'ing in de pockets?\" he asked.  \"Guess not,\" said Dab; \"but there's lots of room.\"  \"Say dar was,\" exclaimed Dick. \"But won't dese t'ings be warm?\"  It was quite likely; for the day was not a cool one, and Dick never seemed to think of getting off what he had on, before getting into his unexpected present. Coat, vest, and trousers, they were all pulled on with more quickness than Dab had ever seen the young African display before.  \"I's much obleeged to ye, Mr. Kinzer,\" said Dick very proudly, as he strutted across the road. \"On'y I dasn't go back fru de village.\"  \"What'll you do, then?\" asked Dab.  \"S'pose I'd better go a-fishin',\" said Dick. \"Will de fish bite?\"  \"Oh! the clothes won't make any odds to them,\" said Dabney. \"I must go back to the house.\"  And so he did: while Dick, on whom the cast-off garments of his white friend were really a pretty good fit, marched on down the road, feeling grander than he ever had before in all his life.  \"That'll be a good thing to tell Ham Morris, when he and Miranda get home again,\" muttered Dab, as he re-entered the house.  Late that evening, when Dabney returned from his final duties as escort to his mother's guests, she rewarded him with more than he could remember ever receiving of motherly commendation.  \"I've been really quite proud of you, Dabney,\" she said, as she laid her plump hand on the collar of his new coat, and kissed him. \"You've behaved like a perfect little gentleman.\"  \"Only, mother,\" exclaimed Keziah, \"he spent too much of his time with that sharp-tongued little Jenny Walters.\"  \"Never mind, Kezi,\" said Dab: \"she didn't know who I was till I told her. I'm going to wear a label with my name on it when I go over to the village to-morrow.\"  \"And then you'll put on your other suit in the morning,\" said Mrs. Kinzer. \"You must keep this for Sundays and great occasions.\"  \"Any more weddings coming, right away?\" said Dab, with a sharp glance around upon what remained of the family; but the girls were all very busy just then, with their books and their sewing, and he did not get any direct reply. Even his mother walked away after something she had left in the dining-room.  When the next morning came, Dabney Kinzer was a more than usually early riser, for he felt that he had waked up to a very important day.  \"Dabney,\" exclaimed his mother, when he came in to breakfast, \"did I not tell you to put on your other suit?\"  \"So I have, mother,\" replied Dab: this is my other suit.\"  \"That?\" exclaimed Mrs. Kinzer.  \"So it is!\" cried Keziah.  \"So it isn't,\" added Samantha. \"Mother, that is not what he had on yesterday.\"  \"He's been trading again,\" mildly suggested Pamela.  \"Dabney,\" said Mrs. Kinzer, \"what does this mean?\"  \"Mean!\" replied Dabney. \"Why, these are the clothes you told me to buy. The lot I wore yesterday were a present from Ham Morris. He's a splendid fellow. I'm glad he got the best of the girls.\"  That was a bad thing for Dabney to say just then, for it was vigorously resented by the remaining three. As soon as quiet was restored, however, Mrs. Kinzer remarked,--  \"I think Hamilton should have consulted me about it, but it's too late now. Anyhow, you may go and put on your other clothes.\"  \"My wedding suit?\" asked Dab.  \"No, indeed! I mean your old ones,--those you took off night before last.\"  \"Dunno where they are,\" slowly responded Dab.  \"Don't know where they are?\" responded a chorus of four voices.  \"No,\" said Dab. \"Bill Lee's black boy had em on all yesterday afternoon, and I reckon he's gone a-fishing again to-day. They fit him a good sight better 'n they ever did me.\"  If Dabney had expected a storm to come from his mother's end of the table, he was pleasantly mistaken; and his sisters had it all to themselves for a moment. Then, with an admiring glance at her son, the thoughtful matron remarked,--  \"Just like his father, for all the world! It's no use, girls: Dabney's a growing boy in more ways than one. Dabney, I shall want you to go over to the Morris house with me after breakfast. Then you may hitch up the ponies, and we'll do some errands around the village.\"  Dab Kinzer's sisters looked at one another in blank astonishment, and Samantha would have left the table if she had only finished her breakfast.
