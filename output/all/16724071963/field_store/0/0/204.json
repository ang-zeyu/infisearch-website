Mr. Blake lifted Hal across this, and showed him where there was a big crack in the water pipe. Then he showed Mab, also lifting her across the little pond in the cellar.  \"You see the pipe was full of water,\" Mr. Blake explained, \"and in the night it got so cold down cellar that the water froze, just as it did in the glass bottle out on the back porch.  \"Then the ice swelled up, and it was so strong that it burst the strong iron pipe, splitting it right down the side.\"  \"But why didn't the water spurt out when I came down cellar earlier this morning?\" asked Mamma Blake. \"It did not leak then.\"  \"I suppose it was still frozen,\" answered her husband. \"But when the furnace fire became hotter it melted the ice in the pipe and that let the water spurt out. But the plumber will soon fix it.\"  Hal and Mab watched the plumber, to whom their papa telephoned. He had to take out the broken pipe, and put in a new piece. Afterward Hal looked at the pipe that had been split by the ice.  \"Why it's just as if gun-powder blew it up,\" he said, for once he had seen a toy cannon that had burst on Fourth of July, from having too much powder in it.  \"Yes, freezing ice is just as strong as gunpowder, only it works more slowly,\" said Daddy Blake with a smile. \"Powder goes off with a puff, a flash and a roar, but ice freezes slowly.\"  \"Oh, but when are we going skating?\" asked Mab, as she and her brother started for school, a little later that morning.  \"As soon as I can find a frozen pond,\" said Daddy Blake with a smile.  Well wrapped up, and wearing warm gloves, Hal and Mab went to their lessons. It was so cold that wintry day, though there was no snow, that they ran instead of walking. Running made them warm.  \"Is my nose red?\" asked Mab, when they were near the school.  \"Oh, it's awful red!\" cried Hal. \"Is mine?\"  \"As red as a boiled lobster!\" laughed Mab. \"Let's run faster!\"  So they ran, and soon they were in a glow of warmth.  \"Oh!\" cried Mab, as she and her brother entered the school-yard, \"we forgot to ask Daddy why we get warm when we run.\"  When the two children reached their house, after lessons were over for the day, they found their father waiting for them. He had his skates over his shoulder, dangling from a strap, and he had Hal's and Mab's in his hand.  \"Come, we are going to look for the frozen pond!\" he said.  Then Hal and Mab forgot all about asking why they became warm when they ran. They cried out joyfully:  \"Oh, Daddy is going to take us skating! Daddy is going to take us skating!\"  Across the fields they went, and in a little while they came to a place where was a pond, in which they used to fish during the summer. But now as they looked down on the water, from the top of a small hill, they saw that the pond was all frozen over. A sheet of ice covered it from edge to edge.  \"Oh, now we can skate!\" cried Hal in delight, \"Now we can try our new skates.\"     CHAPTER V  POOR ROLY-POLY   \"Come on!\" cried Mab, as she started to run down the slope of the hill toward the frozen pond. \"Come on, Hal!\"  \"Hold on!\" called Daddy Blake. \"Wait a minute, Mab! Don't go on the ice yet!\"  Mab stopped at once. So did Hal, who had just begun to run. You see the children had gotten into the habit of stopping when their uncle called: \"Wait a minute and I'll give you a penny,\" so it was not hard for them to do so when their father called.  \"Why can't I go on the ice?\" asked Mab,  \"I must first see how thick it is,\" answered Daddy Blake.  \"What difference does that make?\" Hal wanted to know.  \"Oh, a whole lot,\" said Mr. Blake. \"If the ice is too thin you will break through, and go into the cold water. We must be very careful, I will see if it is thick enough.\"  Mab waited for her father and Hal to come to where she was standing. Roly-Poly did not wait, however. Down he rushed to the frozen pond.  \"Oh, come back! Come back!\" cried Mab. \"You'll go through the ice, Roly!\"  But Roly-Poly paid no attention. Out on the slippery ice he ran, and then he turned around and, looking at Daddy Blake and the two children, he barked as loudly as he could.  Roly-Poly was a queer dog that way. Sometimes he would mind Mab, and then, again, he would not.  \"I guess the ice is thick enough to hold up Roly,\" said Mr. Blake. \"It doesn't need to be very strong for that, as Roly is so little.\"  \"How thick must it be to hold us up?\" Hal wanted to know.  \"Well, on a small pond, ice an inch thick might hold up a little boy or girl,\" explained Mr. Blake. \"But not very many children at a time. On a large pond the ice should be from six to eight inches thick to hold up a crowd of skaters.\"  \"Oh, does ice ever get as thick as that?\" asked Hal.  \"Oh, yes, and much thicker. On big lakes it gets over two feet thick in cold weather,\" Mr. Blake said. \"Then it will hold up a whole regiment of soldiers, and cannon too. Ice is very strong when once it is well frozen. But always be sure it is thick enough before going on.\"  \"How are you going to tell?\" asked Mab.  \"By cutting a little hole through the ice,\" her father told her. \"You can look at the edges of the hole and tell how thick the ice is. We will try it and see.\"  With the big blade of his knife, Mr. Blake cut and chipped a hole in the ice, a little way from shore. Hal and Mab stayed on the ground watching their father, but Roly-Poly ran all about, barking as hard as he could.  \"I guess he is looking for something to bury in a hole,\" spoke Hal. But Roly could not dig in the hard ice, and the ground was also frozen too solidly for him to scratch. So all the little poodle dog could do was to bark.  \"There we are!\" cried Mr. Blake, after a bit. \"See, children, the ice is more than six inches thick. It will be safe for us to skate on!\"  Hal and Mab ran to look into the little hole their father had cut in the ice. It went down for more than half a foot, or six inches, like a well you dig in the sand at the seashore. But no water showed in the bottom of this hole in the ice.  \"The ice is good and thick,\" said Mr. Blake. \"It will hold up all the skaters that will come on this pond.\"  But the children and their Daddy were the only ones there now. Mr. Blake showed Hal and Mab how to put on their skates. He made the straps tight for them, and then put on his own.  \"Now we will see how well you can skate,\" said Mr. Blake.  \"I can!\" cried Hal. \"I've watched the big boys do it. I can skate!\"  \"It's just like roller skating,\" said Mab, \"and I can do that, I know.\"  \"Well, you may find it a little different from roller skating, Mab,\" her papa answered with a laugh.  \"Here I go!\" cried Hal. He struck out on the ice, first with one foot, and then with the other, as he had been used to doing on his roller skates. And then something happened.  Either Hal's feet slid out from under him, or else the whole frozen surface of the pond tilted up, and struck him on the head. He was not quite sure which it was, but it felt, he said afterward, as though the ice flew up and struck him.  \"Oh, be careful!\" cried Daddy Blake, as he saw Hal fall. But it was too late to warn the little boy then.  \"Oh, he's hurt!\" exclaimed Mab with a little sob, as she saw that her brother did not get up.  Daddy Blake skated over to Hal, but there was no need of his help. For Hal got up himself, only he was very careful about it. He did not try to skate any more. He did not want to slip and fall.  \"Are you hurt?\" asked Mr. Blake.  \"N-n-no; I guess not,\" Hal answered slowly. \"The ice is sort of soft, I guess.\"  \"No quite as soft as snow, however,\" laughed Daddy Blake. \"Now you had better not try to skate until I take hold of your hand. I will hold you up. Come, Mab, well take hold of hands and so help each other to stand up.\"  Roly-Poly was rushing here and there, filled with excitement, and he was barking all the while. He was having fun too.  \"Now strike out slowly and carefully,\" directed Daddy Blake to the children. \"First lean forward, with your weight on the left foot and skate, and then do the same with your right. Glide your feet out in a curve,\" and he showed them how to do it, keeping hold of their hands, Mab on one side and Hal on the other. In this way they did not fall down.  Slowly over the ice they went.  \"Oh, we are skating!\" cried Mab, in delight.  \"Isn't it fun!\" shouted Hal.  \"At least you are beginning to skate,\" said Mr. Blake.  Roly-Poly kept prancing around in front, running here and there, and barking louder than ever.  \"Don't get in our way, Roly!\" called Mr. Blake with a laugh, \"or we might skate right over you!\"  \"Bow-wow!\" barked the little poodle dog. And I suppose that was his way of saying:  \"No, I won't! I'll be good.\"  Hal and Mab were beginning to understand the first simple rules of skating. It was not as easy as they had thought--nor was it the same as roller skating. The ice was so slippery.  \"Oh, look at Roly!\" cried Hal, when they had stopped for a rest. \"He's skating, too.\"  A boy who had no skates had come down to the frozen pond, and, seeing the poodle dog, and knowing him to be Hal's pet, this boy wanted to have some fun. He would throw a stick on the ice, sliding it along, and Roly would race after it. He would go so fast, Roly would, that he could not stop when he reached the stick, and along he would slide, almost as if he were skating.  Just as Hal called to Mab to look, Roly cook a long run and a slide. Then, all of a sudden, there was a cracking sound in the ice. A hole seemed to open, close to where the poodle dog was, and, a moment later, Roly-Poly went down, out of sight, into the cold, black water.  \"Poor Roly-Poly!\" cried Mab. \"He's drowned!\"  Roly-Poly had gone under the ice. Hal and Mab were ready to cry. But listen. This is a secret. Roly-Poly was not drowned! A wonderful thing happened to him, but I can not tell you about it until the end of the book. And mind, you're not to turn over the pages to find out, either. That would not be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10220"],["title","Daddy Takes Us Skating (#3)"],["body","r. Just wait, and I'll tell you when the times comes.     CHAPTER VI  FISHING THROUGH THE ICE   \"Come on, Mab,\" cried Hal, to his sister. \"We've got to get him out! We've got to save Roly-Poly!\"  Letting go his father's hand, Hal started to skate toward the place where the little poodle dog had last been seen.  \"Wait--don't go,\" said Mr. Blake quickly, but there was no need. For, as soon as Hal let go of his Daddy's hands, his feet, on which were still the slippery skates, slid out from under him, and down he went again.  \"Oh dear!\" cried Mab. \"Everything is happening! Can't we save Roly, Daddy?\"  \"Yes, perhaps,\" he said slowly. \"But we must not go too near. Roly went down through an air hole in the ice. The ice is thin near there. It might break with us. I will go up carefully and look.\"  Telling Hal and Mab to stay together, in a spot where he knew the ice was thick, Mr. Blake skated slowly toward the place where poor Roly-Poly had gone under. As he came near the ice began to crack again. Mr. Blake skated back.  \"It would be dangerous to go on,\" he said. \"I am sorry for Roly-Poly, but it would not be wise for us to risk our lives for him. It would not be right, however much you love him.\"  \"Oh, we do love him so much!\" sobbed Mab.  \"I'll get you another dog,\" said Mr. Blake, and then he had to blow his nose very hard. Maybe he was crying too, for all I know. Mind, I'm not saying for sure.  \"No other dog will be like Roly-Poly,\" said Hal, who was trying not to cry.  \"I'm awful sorry I threw the sticks for him to chase after,\" said Charlie Anderson, the boy who had been playing with the poodle dog while Hal and Mab were learning to skate.  \"Oh, it wasn't your fault,\" said Daddy Blake. \"Poor Roly! I will see if I can break the ice around the hole. Maybe he is caught fast, and I can loosen the ice so he can get out.\" Daddy Blake took off his skates, and then, with a long piece of fence rail, while he stood on the bank, the children's papa broke the ice around the edges of the air hole. But no Roly-Poly could be seen.  \"Oh dear\" cried Mab. \"He is gone forever!\"  \"Yes,\" spoke Hal, quietly, and then he put his arms around his little sister.  But don't you feel badly, children. We know something Hal and Mab do not know, and we'll keep it a secret from them until it is time for the surprise.  The two Blake children were so sorry their doggie had been lost through the ice, that their father thought it best to take them home.  \"We will have another skating lesson to-morrow,\" he said. \"But this shows you how dangerous air holes are.\"  \"What is an air hole in the ice, Daddy?\" asked Hal.  \"I'll tell you,\" said Mr. Blake. This interested Mab, and she stopped crying. Besides, if you cry when it's cold, the tears may freeze on your cheeks, like little pearls, and fall off.\"  \"An air hole,\" said Mr. Blake, as he walked on home with the children, \"is a place where the ice has not frozen solidly. Sometimes it may be because there is a warm spring in that part of the pond, or a spring that bubbles up, and keeps the water moving. And you know moving or running water will not freeze, except in very, very cold weather.  \"But always be careful of air holes, for the ice around them is easily broken, and you might go through.\"  \"Poor Roly-Poly!\" sighed Mab. \"I wish he had been careful.\"  \"So do I,\" spoke Hal.  \"How would you like to go fishing through the ice?\" asked Daddy Blake, so the children would have something new to think about, and not feel sorry about Roly.  \"Fishing through the ice?\" cried Hal. \"How can we do that? Aren't the fish frozen in the winter?\"  \"I saw some frozen ones down at the fish store,\" Mab said.  \"Well, I don't mean that kind,\" laughed Daddy Blake. \"There are live fish in the waters of the lakes, rivers and ponds, down under the ice. You can not catch all kinds of fish through the ice in winter, but you may some sorts--pickeral for instance.\"  \"Oh, Daddy, and will you take us fishing?\" asked Mab.  \"I think I will, some day soon, if the cold keeps up,\" he said.  And, surely enough he did.  The weather was still very cold, and the ice froze harder and thicker. Several times Daddy Blake took the children down to the pond, and taught them about skating. They were doing very well.  Then, one Saturday, when there was no school, Daddy Blake called out:  \"Now we'll go fishing through the ice. We'll go over to the big lake, so wrap up well, as it is quite cold. We'll take along some lunch, and we'll build a fire on the shore and make hot chocolate.\"  \"Hurray!\" cried Hal.  \"Oh, how lovely!\" exclaimed Mab.  Well wrapped up, and carrying with them their fishing things, as well as lunch, while Mr. Blake had a small axe, the little party set off for a large lake, about two miles away.  When they reached it, Hal wondered how they could ever get any fish, as the water was covered with a thick sheet of ice. But Daddy Blake chopped several holes in the frozen surface, so Hal and Mab could see the dark water underneath. The holes however, were not large enough for the children to fall through.  \"Now we'll fish through the ice!\" said Daddy Blake.  \"Oh, I see how it's done!\" exclaimed Hal with a laugh.     CHAPTER VII  LEARNING TO SKATE   \"Now we'll bait our hooks,\" said Mr. Blake, when he had put the lunch, which they had brought along, safely away in a sheltered place. \"And after that we will have a little skate practice to get warmed up, for it is colder than I thought.\"  \"But if we bait our hooks, and leave them in the water, won't the fish run away with our lines if we are not here to watch them?\" asked Mab.  \"We'll fix the lines so the fish that bite will ring a little bell, to tell us to come and take them off the hook!\" replied Daddy Blake with a laugh.  \"Oh, now I know you're fooling us!\" said Hal.  \"No, really I am not,\" replied his father, but Mr. Blake could not keep the funny twinkle out of his eyes, and Hal was sure there was some joke.  From a small satchel, in which he had put the things for fishing, Mr. Blake took several pieces of wire. On the ends were some bits of red cloth, and also, on each wire, a little brass bell, that went \"tinkle-tinkle.\"  \"Oh, they are really bells!\" cried Mab, as she heard them jingle.  \"Of course they are\" said her father. \"Now I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll bait our hook, and lower it into the water through a hole in the ice. Then, close to the hole, we'll fasten one of these pieces of wire each one of which has, on the upper end, a bell and a bit of red cloth.  \"When the wires are stuck in the ice we'll fasten our lines to them, and then, when the fish, down in the cold water, pulls on the baited hook he will make the piece of red cloth flutter, and he will also ring the bell.\"  \"Oh, now I see!\" cried Hal. \"And if we are off skating we can look over here, and if we see the red rag fluttering we'll know we have a bite, and can come and pull up the fish.\"  \"That's it,\" said Daddy Blake, smiling.  \"And if we don't happen to see the red rag fluttering, we will hear the bell ring,\" added Mab, clapping her hands. \"How nice it is to fish this way!\"  The hooks were soon baited, and lowered into the water through the holes in the ice Then the other end of each fish line was made fast to a wire sticking up, with its bit of red rag, and the little brass bell.  \"Now we'll go skating,\" said Daddy Blake. \"The fish themselves will tell us when they are caught. Come along.\"  Hal and Mab had, by this time, learned to put on their own skates, though of course Hal helped his sister with the straps.  \"You must begin to learn to skate by yourselves,\" said Daddy Blake, after he had held the hands of the children for a time. \"Don't be afraid, strike out for yourselves.\"  \"But s'pose we fall?\" asked Mab.  \"That won't hurt you very much,\" her father said. \"Be careful, of course, not to double your legs up under you, and when you tumble don't hit your head on your own skates, or any one's else. But when you feel that you are going to fall, just let yourself go naturally. If you strain, and try not to fall, you may sprain and hurt yourself more than if you fall easily. Now strike out!\"  Hal and Mab tried it. At first they were timid, and only took little strokes, but, after a while, they grew bolder, and did very well. They were really learning to skate.  \"Oh, look!\" suddenly cried Hal. \"My red rag is bobbing; I must have a bite!\"  He started in such a hurry toward the ice-hole where his line was set that he fell down. But he did not mind that, and was soon up again. However, Mab, who did not stumble, teached her line first.  \"Oh dear! I haven't a bite!\" she sighed, for her bell was not jingling.  \"But I have!\" cried Hal, pulling his line in. \"A big one, too!\"  \"I'll help you,\" said Daddy Blake, as he skated up to his little son, and when Daddy had felt of the tugging line he remarked:  \"Yes, that is a large fish! Up he comes!\" And he pulled up Hal's fish.  Just as the big, flopping pickerel was hauled out on the ice, Mab cried:  \"My bell is tinkling! My bell is tinkling! I've got a fish, too!\" And indeed her piece of wire was moving to and fro where it was stuck up in the ice, and the bell was jingling merrily.  \"Wait, Mab, I'll help you!\" called Daddy Blake, and, leaving Hal to take care of his own fish, the children's papa went to pull in Mab's catch.  Her fish was not quite as large as was Hal's, but it was a very nice one. Then Mr. Blake called out:  \"Oh ho! Now there's a bite on my line!\"  His bell jingled quite loudly, and when the string was pulled up through the hole there was a fine, large pickerel on the hook. The fish were placed in a basket to be taken home, after having been mercifully put out of pain by a blow on the head. Then the hooks were baited again.  In a little while each one had caught another fish and then Daddy Blake said:  \"Now we have all the fish we can use, so there is no need of catching any more. We will practice our skating a little longer, and then go home. For I am"]]]
