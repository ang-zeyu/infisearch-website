He is nothing particular to look at.\"  \"Kaetheli, do you know what?\" Sally said, \"you go home with me. I want to ask whether I may go home with you for a little while. I should like to see that too, and then afterwards we will both go to old Marianne's to call, will you?\"  Kaetheli was ready at once to carry out the plan, and the children ran together toward the parsonage.  It was only a little while before, that Edi and Ritz had arrived home panting for breath. In the garden on the bench under the large apple-tree, Mother and Auntie were sitting mending and conversing over the bringing-up of the children; for Auntie knew many a good advice, quite new and not worn out. Now they heard hasty running, and Edi and Ritz came rushing along.  \"May we--in the Middle Lot--to the Middle Lot--people have arrived--a wagon and a piano--a terribly rich woman and a--\"  Both shouted in confusion, breathlessly and incomprehensibly.  \"Now,\" the aunt cried into the noise, \"if you behave like two canary birds who suddenly have become crazy, no human being can understand a word. One is to be silent and the other may talk, or still better both be silent.\"  But Ritz and Edi could do neither. If Edi began to report, then Ritz had to follow. It always had been so, and to be silent at this moment of excitement, that could not be expected; therefore both began afresh and would no doubt have continued thus for some time if Sally and Kaetheli had not arrived on the scene. They made everything clear in a short time.  But the mother did not like to have her children run to the Middle Lot for the sake of staring at strange people who had arrived there, and to increase the gaping crowd who, no doubt, were standing in front of Marianne's cottage. She did not give the longed-for permission, but she invited Kaetheli to stay at the parsonage and take afternoon coffee with the children and afterwards play in the garden.  That was at least something; Sally and Ritz were satisfied, and they ran at once with Kaetheli into the house. But Edi showed a dissatisfied face, for wherever something strange could be seen or found, he had to be there.  He stood there without saying a word. He was thinking whether he dared to work on his mother to get the desired permission. He feared, however, the auxiliary troops which his aunt would lead into battle to help his mother. But before he had weighed all sides his aunt said: \"Well, Edi, have you not yet swallowed the defeat? Isn't there some old Roman, or Egyptian, who also could not always do what he wanted? Just you think that over and you will see that it will help you.\"  That helped, indeed, for Edi was a great searcher in history, and when he happened in that field, then all other interests were pushed into the background. He at once remembered that he had not finished reading about his old Egyptian, and with a smoothed brow he ran into the house.  The sun had set and it was growing dark among the bushes in the garden, where the children, with red cheeks, were seeking each other and hiding again. All of a sudden there came a loud, penetrating call: \"To bed, to bed!\" Ritz had just found a fine hiding-place in the henhouse, where he had comfortably settled, secure from being discovered, when this terrible call reached him. It struck him like a thunderbolt. Yes, it took his breath away so that he turned white and hadn't the strength to rise; for, with the call came the remembrance of the three sentences which he had to write: three whole sentences and nine different qualities, and he had forgotten everything, and now all the time had gone and he had to go to bed.  \"Where are you, Ritz?\" It sounded into his hiding-place. \"Come, crawl out. I know you are in there and will be covered with feathers from head to foot.\"  The aunt stood before the henhouse, and Sally and Kaetheli beside her full of expectation, for they had sought Ritz for a long time in vain. But Auntie had experience in such things. Ritz actually came crawling out of the henhouse and stood now in a lamentable condition before his aunt.  \"How you do look! You ought to have been in bed an hour ago, you haven't a drop of blood in your cheeks,\" the aunt exclaimed. \"What is the matter with you, Ritz?\"  \"Where is Mamma?\" asked Ritz in his fright.  \"She is upstairs; come, she will put you to bed at once when I have got you finally together. Come, Sally, and you, Kaetheli, go home now.\"  With these words she took Ritz by the hand, and drew him up the stone steps into the house, and wanted to bring him up the stairs to the bedroom. Then everything was over and no rescue from going to bed at once. Now Ritz stopped his aunt and groaned: \"I must--I must--I have to write three sentences for punishment.\"  \"There we have it.\" But Ritz looked so miserable that Auntie felt great pity for him. \"Come in here,\" she said, and shoved him into the living-room, \"and take out your things.\"  Now she sat down beside him and the whole affair proceeded finely. Not that Auntie formed the sentences, no indeed, she was not going to cheat the teacher; but she knew well what was needed to form a sentence and she pushed and spurred Ritz and brought so many things before him, and reminded him how they looked, that he had his three sentences and his nine qualities together in no time. Now there came a feeling to Ritz that he had not acted right, when he said that an aunt must not always be reminding people, and when now Auntie asked: \"Ritz, why had you to write the sentences?\" then the feeling grew stronger in him, for he felt that he could not tell the cause of his punishment without making his aunt angry. He stuttered, \"I have--I have--the teacher has said, that I made an unfitting sentence.\"  \"Yes, I can imagine that,\" said Auntie. \"Now quickly to bed.\"  Edi and Ritz slept in the same room and that was the place where the two boys, every evening after the mother had said evening prayer with them, and they were alone, exchanged their deepest thoughts and experiences with one another and talked them over. Ritz had the greatest respect for Edi, for although the latter was only a little older, yet he was already in the fourth class, and he himself was only in the second, and in history Edi knew more than the scholars in the fifth and some in the sixth class. When now the two were well tucked in their beds, Ritz said: \"Edi, was it a sin that I said Auntie must not always remind?\" Edi thought a bit, such a case had never come to him. After a while he said: \"You see, Ritz, it goes thus: if you have done something that is a sin, then you must go at once to Daddy and confess, there is no help for it; but if you do that, then everything comes again in order and you feel happy again, and afterwards you look out not to do the sinful thing again. I can tell you that, Ritz. But if you do not confess, then you are always full of fear when a door is slammed or a letter-carrier unexpectedly brings a letter, then you think at once: 'There now, everything will come out.' And so you are never sure nor safe and you feel a pressure in the chest. But there is another thing that presses so hard that you can think of nothing else, for example, if you have given away a rabbit, you regret it afterwards. But there is a remedy and I have tried it many a time, and it helps. You must think of something dreadful, like a large fire, when everything is burnt up, the fortress and the soldiers in it and all historical books, and--all at once you think everything backwards and you have everything; then you are so glad that you think: what difference does a rabbit make? You still have everything else. Now Ritz, try that and see if it helps you, then you can find out whether everything passes away or whether you have to tell Daddy tomorrow.\"  \"Yes, I will try it,\" said Ritz somewhat indistinctly, and soon after he took such deep breaths that Edi knew what was going on. He heaved a sigh and said: \"Oh, Ritz, you are asleep and I wanted to tell you so much about the old Egyptian.\"  A little while afterwards the whole peaceful parsonage of Upper Wood lay in deep sleep; only old 'Lizebeth went about the passage calling: \"Bs, bs, bs.\" She wanted to get the old grey cat into the kitchen to catch the mice during the night. 'Lizebeth had been in the parsonage of Upper Wood as long as one could remember, for there had always been a son, and when the time had come, then he had become parson in Upper Wood. First 'Lizebeth had served the grandfather, then the father and now the son, and she had long since elected Edi as the future minister, and intended to look after his house when he should be the master here.    CHAPTER II  _A Call in the Village_   The friendly village Upper Wood lay on the top of the hill close by the fir wood; it had a beautiful white church with a high, slender tower. At a distance of three-quarters of an hour's walk, down in the valley, lay Lower Wood, a small community which, however, did not wish to be considered smaller. They had a new schoolhouse and a church of their own, but the church had no tower, only a little red dome. Therefore the people of Upper Wood were a little proud, because their church was much prettier and also because they learned much more in the old schoolhouse in Upper Wood than in the new one of Lower Wood; but that was the children's fault, not the teacher's. In the middle, between the two villages lay a hamlet consisting of a few farms and some small houses of little pretense. It was called the Middle Lot, and its people the Middle Lotters. They had the choice to what church and school they wished to belong, whether to Lower Wood or Upper Wood, and according to their choice they were judged by the people of Upper Wood; for whoever wanted to learn much and be decent, he must, according to the Upper Wooders, strive "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10436"],["title","Erick and Sally (#2)"],["body","belong to them. This was a fixed and general idea of the people on the top of the hill. In the Middle Lot there lived only two families who were generally respected; the Justice of Peace, who was obliged to live there because otherwise he would have to be called there, and that would have been inconvenient. This peace-making man was Kaetheli's father. And the other was old Marianne, who lived in her own house and pulled horse-hair for a living, and never did harm to anyone.  When on the next morning the three children of the parsonage passed Marianne's house on their way to school, Sally said: \"It is fun to go to school to-day for the strange boy of yesterday will come too; if we only knew his name. Kaetheli described him to me; he wears velvet pants. Of course he will come to Upper Wood to school.\"  \"Of course,\" said Edi with a dignified air; \"who would think of going to Lower Wood to School?\"  \"Of course, who would go there to school?\" observed Ritz.  Then the three in perfect harmony entered the schoolhouse. But no strange face was to be seen in the whole schoolroom; everything went on in the usual way to the end of the morning. Then everyone hurried away in different directions. Sally was standing there, somewhat undecided; she would like to have heard something new of the strange boy and his mother, for she loved to hear news, and now not even Kaetheli, with whom she talked things over, had been in school. But now she saw Edi soaring along like an arrow into the midst of a crowd of boys, and they all acted so strangely and they shouted so strangely that Sally thought that something particular must be in preparation there, and no doubt concerned the new-comers. Then she could hear something from Edi. She went slowly on and kept on turning round, but Edi did not come, and only after Sally had long since greeted the mother and was about to call her father out of his study for dinner, did the two brothers come running along, their faces red as fire, and breathless, for they had lingered to the last moment. The father was just leaving his study when both rushed toward him and now it began: \"We have--the Middle Lotters--with the Lower Wooders--\"  \"Hush, hush,\" said the father. \"First get your breath, then relate, one after the other; but before anything, first the soup.\" With these words the father took Ritz's hand, and Sally and Edi followed them into the dining-room. Sally pulled Edi a little back and whispered:  \"Tell me quickly, what did they tell about the strange boy?\"  \"About him?\" returned Edi in a somewhat scornful tone. \"I had forgotten all about him! We have something else to do than to talk about a strange boy, of whom one does not even know whether he will come to Upper Wood to school.\"  This answer was somewhat unexpected to Sally and had a saddening effect; but she always could find a way out of an unpleasant situation. So she sat as still as a mouse during the whole time the soup was eaten, and her thoughts were hard at work.  Now the father turned to Edi and said: \"Now you can relate your adventure, while Ritz remains quiet, and afterwards his turn will come.\" Ritz looked quite obedient for he had two large noodles on his plate to work with.  But Edi, in a moment, put down knife and fork and quickly began: \"Just think, Papa, we have made three songs, one for each parish. First, the Lower Wooders began. The sixth class were angry because we laughed at them, that they only now have to _make_ sentences, and we in the fourth class have begun to _write_ them already. They made a song about us which runs:      \"'Of Upper Wood the boys      They in their minds rejoice      Because they think that they the cleverest are,      But if ever they must fight      They are in sorry plight      And they turn round and run for ever so far.'  \"How do you like that song, Papa?\"  \"Well, that is such as Lower Wooders would make,\" said the father.  \"And then,\" Edi continued, \"we have made a song for an answer, that goes thus:      \"'And of Lower Wood the crowd      They always yell so loud      That they never, never stay within their den,      For all dispute and strife      They are much alive      For they use their fists when they ought to use their pen.'  \"How do you like this one, Papa?\"  \"Just about the same. And who has sung about the Middle Lot?\" asked the father.  \"The Lower Wooders and we together; they too had to have a song, but the shortest, as it ought to be. It runs so:      \"'And they of Middle Lot      They all together plot      That they are striving zealously for peace,      But with quarrelling they never cease.'  \"And how do you like that, Papa?\"  \"They are, all three of them, kind of fighting songs, Edi,\" answered the father, \"and I should prefer that you keep busy with your history studies, instead of taking sides in these party-fights. One never knows where one comes out, and such poetry usually ends with lumps on the heads.\"  Edi seemed much disappointed as he attacked his noodles with a visibly spoiled appetite.  \"And what has been your experience, Sally? Why are you so pensive?\" the father continued.  \"Kaetheli was not at school,\" reported Sally, \"and I had so much to talk over with her. Perhaps she is sick; may I go to see her this afternoon? We have no school, you know.\"  \"Aha, Sally wants to see the strange boy,\" the sharp-witted Edi remarked.  \"You may go, Sally,\" the mother said, answering a questioning look from the father. \"But you will not go into any house where you have no business, just to look at strangers. I know you are capable of doing such things. You can start soon after dinner.\"  Sally was very happy. She quickly fetched her straw hat and took leave. But outside she did not run straight through the passage-way as she usually did in similar cases, but went to the kitchen door and peeped in, and when she saw 'Lizebeth at the sink, where the latter was scraping her pans, she went in very close to the old woman and said somewhat mysteriously: \"'Lizebeth, does Edi or Ritz perhaps have a torn mattress on their bed?\"  'Lizebeth stopped scraping and turned round. She looked at Sally from head to foot, put her hands on her hips and said very slowly and importantly: \"May I ask what you mean by that question, Sally? Do you think this household is so carried on that one lies about on ragged mattresses and sleeps, until a little one, who is far from old enough to turn a mattress, thinks of coming to ask 'does not this one or that one have a ragged mattress' on his bed? Yes, Sally, what cobwebs you do have in your head.\"  \"I do not care about the mattress, it is on account of Marianne that I ask,\" Sally explained. \"Do you know, she now has some new people in her house and I should so much like to see them, and therefore I wanted so much to know whether you could not sacrifice a mattress so that Marianne could pull the horsehair for a mattress, for Mother will not let me go into the house without a good excuse.\"  \"Oh, so! that is different,\" said 'Lizebeth quite mildly, for she had also been wondering what kind of people her old friend had taken into her home, and now, perhaps, she could learn something about them through Sally.  \"I can help you, Sally,\" she said. \"You go to Marianne and tell her that I send my greetings, and I have long since intended to come and see her, but the likes of us cannot get away when we want to; we never know what may happen if we are out of the house for five minutes; but tell her that I will surely come some fine Sunday. Now then go, and give my message.\"  Sally ran with a joyous heart, first through the garden, then away over the meadow and down the hill as far as the fir wood, where the dry road lay for a long stretch in the shade. Here Sally slackened her pace a little. It was so beautiful to walk along in shade of the trees, where above in their tops the wind rustled so delightfully and all the birds sang in confusion. She also had to consider how she would arrange her calls, whether she would go first to Kaetheli or to Marianne; but this time old Marianne had a stronger attraction than Kaetheli and Sally felt that she must go there first and give her message. Now her thoughts fell on the strange people and she had to imagine how they looked and what she was going to say, and what they would say when she knocked and asked for Marianne. Thus she thought everything well out, for Sally had a great power of imagining things.  In this way she came to the first houses of Middle Lot. She turned away from the road and went toward Marianne's house, which stood a little way from the road and lay almost hidden behind a hedge. As Sally had been accustomed to do, she now ran right into the house, although the house door was also the kitchen door. After entering the front door she stood in the small kitchen and was at once before another door which led into the living-room. This door stood wide open and Sally found herself suddenly in the presence of a lady dressed in black, who sat in that room sewing and who lifted her head at Sally's noisy entrance, and with large sad eyes she looked at the child in silence.  Sally grew as red as fire and in her embarrassment remained standing near the door like one rooted to the floor.  Now the lady held out her hand and said in a friendly tone, \"Come here, dear child, what brings you to me?\"  Sally was quite confused. She did not remember why she had come, for she had really not come to see Marianne. She had invented that--to get into the house where she had arrived now so unexpectedly. She approached the lady and wanted to say something, but nothing came out. Sally grew crimson and stood there more helpless than ever before in her life.  The lady took the child's hand and stroked her glowing cheeks.  \"Come, sit down beside me, dear child,\" she then said, with a voice so sweet that it went deep into Sally's heart. \"Come, we shall come gradually to know each other a little.\"   [Illustration: _Now the lady held out her"]]]
