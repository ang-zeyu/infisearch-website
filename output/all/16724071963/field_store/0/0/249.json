Dan let the boat's head fall off a point in order that he might see better around the mast on the weather side, just where he must head his craft in the last dash in.  \"It's Foss and Ella Wright,\" called Dan, as the flying sailboat got in closer over the foam-crested waves. \"No, it isn't; Foss has Susie.\"  \"Can you make out Canty and Ella?\" demanded Darrin hoarsely.  \"Not a sign, Dave. Maybe he's gone under trying to save Ella.\"  \"Canty was one of our Gridley High School boys, so I'd expect him to have both the nerve and the grace to go down with a girl, if he couldn't save her as well as himself,\" muttered Darrin.  \"There's Canty, just come up!\"  \"Can you make out Ella's head?\"  \"No.\"  \"Look hard.\"  \"I don't see her, and--there!\"  \"What's up?\"  \"Nothing,\" returned Dalzell soberly. \"Canty's down--just gone down again.\"  \"I hope he's gone down trying to find and rescue Ella,\" murmured Dave.  They were now so close that the young midshipmen would have been able to hear the shouts of the imperiled ones had it not been that the wind blew the sounds of voices away from the would-be rescuers.  \"Better ease off the sheet a bit, I guess, Davy,\" called Dan, as he suited the action to the word. \"We don't went to run 'em down.\"  \"No.\"  As he spoke, Dave Darrin brought the boat slightly around. They were now close enough to see that Tom Foss was supporting dead weight in the person of Susie, who was unconscious.  \"Waiting the word from you on the sheet, Davy,\" nodded Dan, as the boat drew close to the only pair of survivors now visible.  \"Let go the sheet!\" called Dave an instant later, and Dan let it run off clear, handing the end of the rope to Darrin.  \"Can you head Susie this way, Foss?\" Dalzell called.  \"I'd rather have help,\" came the faint answer. Tom Foss was evidently well spent by his exertions in keeping up the girl so long.  Splash! Dan Dalzell was in the water, without waiting to hear more. The athletic young midshipman swam with a steadiness and speed that was glorious to see. Many an excellent swimmer, in smooth water, would dread buffeting with such waves as were now rolling.  Dave Darrin, meanwhile, held on to the tiller and the paid-out sheet, ready to manoeuvre the now pitching, rolling boat at an instant's notice. It took all his seamanship to keep the craft afloat, though the sailboat was far better modeled for such water than the motor launch had been.  \"Give her over to me, and save yourself,\" commanded Dalzell cheerily, as he reached Tom Foss. \"Think you can make it, old fellow?\"  \"If I can't, I ought to drown,\" retorted Tom Foss, as he struck out, none too strongly. \"This is all my fault. You fellows gave me better advice than I had sense to follow.\"  Dan, with a skill that he had acquired directly from the excellent instruction given him by the swimming master at the Naval Academy, was now piloting the unconscious form of Susie Danes toward the sailboat.  Even encumbered as he was, Dan made the boat before Tom Foss could accomplish that feat alone. Truth to tell, Foss was very nearly \"all in.\" Had rescue been delayed a few moments longer, Foss and his fair companion must have sunk.  \"Get hold of her, Davy,\" called Dan, as he ranged up on the weather side of the tossing boat.  Darrin promptly leaned over and lifted the unconscious girl into the boat. By the time he had done that Tom Foss reached up both hands, seizing the boat's stern.  \"Going to help me in?\" he called.  \"I don't know,\" Dave answered dubiously.  \"If we can find Ella Wright there may not be room. With such a sea running, this boat won't hold many.\"  \"No matter about me, then,\" muttered Tom. \"If Ella isn't found right away I don't believe I care about going back to Gridley.\"  Dave's response was swiftly to knot a noose and let it down over Tom's shoulders. The other end of the line he made fast astern. Dalzell, in the meantime, had swum back again. Susie Danes lay as still as death in the bottom of the boat.  As Dalzell got back where he had first reached Foss and Susie, he espied the head of Ab Canty some distance away.  \"Ab!\" called Dan.  \"Here!\"  \"What has become of Ella?\"  \"Oh, I wish I knew!\"  \"Was she afloat at all!\" demanded Dan, swimming nearer.  \"Yes; I kept her up for a couple of minutes, maybe. Then she got more scared, wound her arms tight around me, and we both sank. We had a struggle under water. I freed myself, but when I came to the top I found that my hand was clutching nothing but her empty jersey. There it is now,\" chattered Ab, his teeth, knocking against each other, as he pointed to the garment in question on the top of a distant wave. Then Ab sank.  For just an instant Dalzell thought Canty had gone below on purpose. Dan swam closer, to be of assistance. Then he saw the bubbles of air coming up rapidly.  \"Cantys given out--he's going to drown!\" gasped Midshipman Dan, with horror.  Like a flash Dan dived below, found and clutched at Canty. The young man returned the grip with interest, but Midshipman Dalzell struggled to the surface with him. Ab Canty was exhausted, out of his head and altogether past reasoning. Dan hated to do it, but he had to strike the young man in the forehead. Canty gave a gasp and ceased to resist.  Dave Darrin, watching, had run the boat up close alongside as soon as the struggling pair appeared above the waves.  \"You'll have to take him in, Davy,\" announced Midshipman Dalzell. \"Canty isn't strong enough to tow behind. And I'm coming aboard for a fresh look before I dive for Miss Wright.\"  \"You're going to stay aboard and manage the boat,\" retorted Darrin quietly. \"I'm going in next.\"  \"Oh, all right, if you want to,\" half grumbled Dan. \"But I'm just beginning to get used to it and to like it.\"  Dan, however, followed orders and took his seat by tiller and sheet as soon as they had towed Canty safely in the boat. Tom Foss, lied and holding on at the stern, was beginning to chatter hard, but said he was all right.  A brief instant of consultation the two midshipmen held. Then Dave Darrin, holding his hands before him, dived hard and deep into the water.  After nearly a minute he came up again, but only to take an observation. Then he sank, to explore more of the space under water.  For five minutes Darrin continued this, making four dives in all, and sinking twice without diving.  \"I can't give this up, and abandon a girl,\" he muttered. \"Dan, I've got to take more account of the current, and work gradually downstream.\"  A little later Dave rose with a whoop the instant that his head showed above the water.  \"I've got her,\" Dave announced, though his voice was hoarse and panting.  \"Hurrah!\" came from Dan, as he saw the girl's head show above the surface. Dalzell, hauling on the sheet, ran the boat in close. Dave grasped at the rail on the weather quarter, while Dan bent over him, hauling hard. And so Ella Wright was dragged unconscious into the boat.  \"I'd stay here in the water with you, Tom,\" explained Dave, \"but I've got to be in the boat to do my share of handling her.\"  \"Th-th-that's all r-r-r-r-right,\" chattered poor Foss, \"I'm d-d-d-doing f-f-f-fine here--c-c-c-couldn't h-help in the b-b-b-boat\"  While lying to, it had taken some fine management on the part of the midshipmen to keep the sailboat from capsizing. And now, on this rough, wave-strewn river, they had to tack back against a nearly head wind.  \"Look at the crowd on the clubhouse float,\" gasped Dan as soon as the Naval chums had gotten their craft under way.  \"Good thing,\" muttered Darrin. \"We'll need plenty of help.\"  \"I wonder how the crowd got wind of the thing in such short time?\"  \"You forget,\" nudged Darrin, \"that there's a telephone in the clubhouse. Laura and Belle are not given to losing their heads. Undoubtedly they've been 'phoning to Gridley.\"  \"Then they can't have overlooked the need of physicians,\" ventured Dan, \"especially as Laura is the daughter of one.\"  As the boat drew nearer to the float the noise of cheers was borne to the ears of the midshipmen.  \"More of the hero racket,\" uttered Dan disgustedly.  \"I hope this won't get into the newspapers,\" grunted Darrin in a tone of something like real alarm. \"Say, the fellows of the brigade wouldn't do a thing but make us mount chairs and read all the fulsome gush about this rescue.\"  \"And then, after we'd finished a straight reading,\" groaned Dan, \"we'd have to sing it next, to the tune of 'Columbia, the Pride of the Ocean.'\"  \"'Gem of the Ocean,' Dan,\" Darrin corrected.  Though in the middle of the river the sailboat had many a close shave from capsizing in the strong puffs of wind, especially with the load that the little craft carried, yet Dan Dalzell, at the tiller, brought the boat at last in under the lee side of the float, and there a score of pairs of willing hands reached out with offers of help.  Dr. Bentley was in the crowd, as were two other Gridley physicians. There were also two trained nurses, and one of the druggists had brought along a big emergency box of drugs and supplies. Between them the telephone and the automobile can accomplish a lot in these modern times.  Laura and Belle, though they had summoned the aid, now kept tactfully in the background.  The two apparently drowned girls were lifted from the boat in haste and borne to a room that had been made ready on the second floor of the clubhouse. Ab Canty was carried to another room, and Tom Foss, who nearly shook to pieces when lifted from the water, was helped after his friend.  \"You two young midshipmen will have to come inside and get some of our attention,\" called Dr. Bentley in an authoritative voice.  \"I think not, thank you, doctor,\" replied Dave Darrin. \"The most that we want is some place where we can strip and rub down, while waiting for dry clothing.\"  \"I know just the room, and I'll"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10319"],["title","Dave Darrin's Third Year at Annapolis; Or, Leaders of the Second Class (#4)"],["body"," take you there,\" urged Len Spencer, reporter for the \"Morning Blade.\" Len was an old friend of Dick Prescott, who, in his High School days before going to West Point, had worked as an amateur space reporter for the \"Blade.\"  Len led the way gladly. While Dan and Dave stripped and rubbed down, Len got out of them the whole account of what they had been through. Reporter Spencer had already talked with Belle and Laura. A man in an auto had already started for the homes of the two midshipmen, to obtain changes of clothing for them.  \"Now, Len,\" begged Dave, \"don't spread on a lot of taffy. Don't smother us under the hero racket.\"  \"But it was an heroic thing,\" Len argued. \"And, besides, it was done with great skill, of the kind that you've gained at the Naval Academy. It makes a corking, elegant story about two of our brightest Gridley lads.\"  \"But, Len, do you realize that the fellows at the Naval Academy will make us read aloud to them this yarn you're proposing to write about us--that is, if they happen to hear about it?\"  \"And then, after we've read the yarn straight, they'll make us sing it all to some blamed old tune or another,\" groaned Dalzell.  \"Well, I can't help it,\" sighed good-natured Len. \"It's a story we've got to have to-morrow morning. I'd lose my position if I didn't write a good story about this afternoon's work. And, now that I've got a wife and baby to feed, I can't afford to waste any good time in job-hunting.\"  \"Then I hope none of the other fellows at the Naval Academy hear about the 'Blade's' story,\" gulped Dan, as he wrapped himself in a blanket while waiting for his dry clothes.  \"Hear about it?\" retorted Len. \"They'll hear about it, all right. The Associated Press man at Gridley will be sure to send something about it to the papers all over the country.\"  \"I guess we've got to take our medicine, Danny,\" hinted Midshipman Dave Darrin.  In the meantime Tom Foss was soon comfortable, wrapped up in blankets and with plenty of coffee inside him. Nor did it take long to bring Ab Canty around. In three quarters of an hour Susie Danes opened her eyes.  As for Ella Wright, the physicians and nurses worked over her long and earnestly, and were on the point of giving her up when at last a flutter of her eyelids was seen.  By night time all of the young people were quite out of danger, but the parents of the Wright and Danes families were highly indignant over the recklessness of Tom Foss in taking the girls out on the river in such a heavy wind.  Three days later even the launch was saved; that is, it was raised and was towed to a boat-builder for overhauling and repairs.     CHAPTER III  THE TROUBLE-MAKING FOP   The story that Len Spencer wrote for the \"Blade\" was \"worse\" than the midshipmen had expected. That is, the newspaper made them out to be heroes of some rare, solid-gold type. To add to the trouble, the story, in a condensed form, was printed broadcast by the dailies all over the country.  \"We can't hope to keep it quiet, Danny boy,\" groaned Dave when the two chums met the next morning.  \"No,\" sighed Dan. \"The most we can hope for is to be allowed to live it down.\"  \"And I'm much afraid that we've got to stand for a lot more of gush this afternoon,\" continued Darrin.  \"At the reception? Oh, yes! I wish we could desert the town and get away somewhere to hide.\"  The affair for the afternoon was a reception for which Laura Bentley had sent out hurried invitations to a lot of the former High School boys and girls of Gridley. Though Laura was more especially interested in the U. S. Military Academy at West Point--because Dick Prescott was there--yet she did not show undue partiality to the Army.  \"I'm sorry Laura didn't wait a fortnight,\" Dan continued.  \"Oh, well, she doesn't understand,\" Dave urged.  \"You're going, of course?\"  \"I surely am. I wouldn't slight that splendid girl. She's a whole lot to me, Danny boy, both for her own sake and Dick Prescott's.\"  Even the short stroll, however, between Belle Meade's home and Laura's, was bound to bring Dave Darrin again into the unwished-for limelight.  He and Belle had turned into Main Street together, and were walking along, chatting, when Belle's eyes flashed suddenly.  \"There's that horrid wretch Ardmore,\" she murmured in an undertone.  \"Don't believe I know him,\" Darrin returned.  \"Then you haven't been deprived of much,\" replied Belle, in a tone that was very nearly bitter. \"I've been meaning to tell you about him, Dave, but other matters have been cropping up and it has escaped me until now.\"  \"What's wrong with Ardmore?\" asked Dave.  \"He's posing as an admirer of mine.\"  \"I can't quarrel with his taste,\" smiled Darrin.  \"But he annoys me.\"  \"Has he dared to do that?\" demanded Dave, a quick flash in his eyes.  \"Not in any way that it would be easy to resent,\" Belle assured him.  \"Who is this fellow Ardmore?\"  \"He appears to be a gentleman--at least in his ordinary conduct,\" Belle Meade answered. \"He moved here last spring with his parents. The father is a retired lawyer, and wealthy. The Ardmores move in a rather good set in town. About a month ago Caspar Ardmore, the young man, met me at a church affair. Ever since then he has all but waylaid me. Several times he has tried to walk with me when we met, and has often tried to see me home from church or elsewhere. I've been almost downright rude to him, and have shown him in every way I can that I don't wish to continue acquaintance. But he's hard to discourage.\"  \"He hasn't insulted you?\" asked Dave quietly.  \"Oh, dear, no! If he had, I think I might have been able to startle him somewhat,\" laughed Belle, who had a \"temper\" when it was necessary to have one. As she spoke she raised her eyes, glancing ahead.  \"There, he has stopped, and looks almost as though he were waiting for us,\" she added.  \"There's an ugly scowl on his face, too.\"  Dave Darrin looked ahead at the foppish, rather good-looking, tall and slender young man of some twenty-six years.  \"I hope he isn't going to be troublesome,\" murmured Dave. \"I don't want to have to fight with him--at least, not when you're along with me.\"  As they neared Ardmore, Dave continued to look at the young man quietly, steadily, frankly. Ardmore seemed trying to ignore the gaze, and looked, instead, at Belle.  Just as the young couple reached him, Ardmore raised his hat, at the same time stepping forward so that he blocked Belle's progress.  \"Good afternoon, Miss Meade,\" was Ardmore's greeting. \"I was on my way to your house when I saw you. Mother has some tickets for a concert at the Sorosis rooms, and is unable to use them this afternoon. So I have come to ask you if you will not honor me with your company at the concert?\"  \"Thank you, no,\" Belle answered coldly. \"And I would also like to make it plain, Mr. Ardmore, since you make it necessary, that I do not wish your company at any time or place. I am sorry to have to speak so plainly.\"  A deep flush dyed the cheeks of the fop. But he was not so easily discouraged.  \"I had intended to call this evening, Miss Meade. I am to have a box at the theatre.\"  \"You may call anywhere you wish,\" Belle retorted, her eyes flashing, \"provided it is not at my home.\"  \"Oh, I am very much afraid that you are annoyed with me,\" cried Ardmore.  \"I am,\" Belle admitted. \"Mr. Ardmore, will you do me the very great favor of ceasing your attempts at acquaintance?\"  \"Acquaintance? Why, we're already very well acquainted, Miss Meade; in fact, I had hoped that we were, by this time, the most excellent friends. If this gentleman,\" with a sidelong look at Dave, \"will excuse us, Miss Meade, will you stroll along with me and tell me in what way I may have offended you without intending anything of the sort?\"  Dave, who had remained quiet, now felt called upon to interpose.  \"Sir,\" he demanded, \"will you observe Miss Meade's request and take yourself away?\"  \"And what have you to say about this?\" demanded Ardmore sneeringly.  \"The young lady is under my protection.\"  \"I have offered her mine.\"  \"And Miss Meade has just told you that you will please her most by keeping away from her at all times,\" replied Darrin quietly but firmly.  \"What? After all the good times she and I have enjoyed together?\" demanded Ardmore, as though astounded beyond measure.  \"I? Good times with you?\" cried Belle, her cheeks flaming. \"I've never even spoken to you when I could avoid it.\"  \"That's false!\" cried young Ardmore hotly.  \"Stop, right there!\" warned Dave Darrin in a quieter voice than ever, though his face paled swiftly. \"Did I understand you to remark that Miss Meade had made a false statement?\"  \"You did!\"  Whack! Darrin's clenched right fist caught the fop on the temple, felling him to the ground.  \"Go right on to Laura's, Belle,\" begged Dave quickly. \"I'll be along soon.\"  Miss Meade walked rapidly ahead.  Ardmore was on his feet in an instant. Not wanting in a certain amount of animal courage, he rushed at Dave, only to be met with a blow in the mouth that floored him again. The fop's lip was cut and bleeding when he rose.  \"You cur!\" bellowed the fellow.  \"The opinion of a person like you can't matter very much,\" Dave retorted coolly.  A little crowd was beginning to gather. Dave's pallor increased, for his very soul writhed at the thought of having Belle's name involved in a brawl in this fashion.  \"You're a--\" began Ardmore, but Dave Darrin moved quickly up to him.  \"Do you retract the statement you made?\" demanded the midshipman in a low voice.  \"I retract nothing,\" quivered Ardmore. \"I repeat, and repeat--\"  Dave closed in like lightning, Ardmore attempted to guard himself, but he was all but helpless before such a fast, trained hitter as Dave. The fop went down under two well-aimed blows delivered almost together.  Once more Ardmore leaped to his feet, while Darrin disdainfully awaited him.  But two or three men in the crowd leaped between the enemies, forcing the fop back.  \"Don't be a fool, Ardmore!\" urged one of the men,"]]]
