You meet his sort everywhere, and they always have a wife along, who worships them and makes a home out of tin cans and packing-cases that would put the stay-at-home housekeepers to shame.  They always have a picture on the wall of cows standing knee-deep in the water, and no matter what their circumstances are, there's always something in reserve, for guests, offered frankly without apology.  Never hesitate with those folk, but don't let them go too far, for they'll beggar themselves to help you in a tight place, if you'll let them. Ticknor his name was.  He's a good man.  \"Say, Grim, there's a case in the Sikh hospital that ought to interest you,\" he said at last.  \"Fellow from Damascus--Arab--one of Feisul's crowd.  He wouldn't let them take him to the Zionist hospital--swore a Jew knifed him and that the others would finish the job if they got half a chance.  They'd have been arguing yet, and he dead and buried, if I hadn't gone shopping with Mabel. She saw the crowd first (I was in Noureddin's store) and jabbed her way in with her umbrella--she yelled to me and I bucked the line.  \"The Jews wanted to tell me I had no right to take that chap to the Sikh hospital, and no more had I;  so I plugged him up a bit, and put him in a cab, and let him take himself there, Mabel and me beside him.  Seeing I was paying for the cab, I didn't see why Mabel should walk.  Of course, once we had him in there he was too sick to be moved;  but the Army won't pay for him, so I sent a bill to the Zionists, and they returned it with a rude remark on the margin.  Maybe I can get the money out of Feisul some day; otherwise I'm stuck.\"  \"I'll settle that,\" said Grim.  \"What's the tune he plays?\"  \"Utter mystery.  Swears a Jew stabbed him, but that Damascus outfit blame the Jews for everything.  He's only just down from Damascus.  I think he's one of Feisul's officers, although he's not in uniform-- prob'ly on a secret mission.  Suppose you go and see him?  But say, watch out for the doc on duty--he's a meddler. Tell him nothing!\"  \"Sure.  How about Jeremy?  What's the verdict?\"  \"What do you want done with him?\"  \"I want him out of reach of trouble here pending his discharge. No need to certify him mad, is there?\"  \"Mad?  All Australians are mad.  None of us need a certificate for that. Have you arrested him?\"  \"Not yet.\"  \"Then you're too late!  He's suffering from bad food and exposure.  The air of Jerusalem's bad for him, and he's liable to get pugnacious if argued with.  That runs in the blood.  I order him off duty, and shall recommend him within twenty minutes to the P.M.O. for leave of absence at his own expense.  If you know of any general who dares override the P.M.O. I'll show you a brass hat in the wind.  Come on;  d'you want to bet on it?\"  \"Will the P.M.O. fall?\" asked Grim.  \"Like a new chum off a brumby.  Signs anything I shove under his nose. Comes round to our house to eat Mabel's damper and syrup three nights a week.  You bet he'll sign it:  Besides, he's white;  pulled out of the firing-line by an Australian at Gaza, and hasn't forgotten it.  He'd sign anything but checks to help an Anzac.  I'll be going.  \"You trot up to the slaughter-shop, Grim, and interview that Arab--Sidi bin Something-or-Other--forget his name--he lies in number nineteen cot on the left-hand side of the long ward, next to a Pathan who's shy both legs.  You can't mistake him.  I'll write out a medical certificate for Jeremy and follow.  And say; wait a minute!  What price the lot of you eating Mabel's chow tonight at our house?  We don't keep a cook, so you won't get poisoned.  That's settled;  I'll tell Mabel you're coming. Tootleloo!\"  But there was a chance that the brigadier might carry resentment to the point of sending up a provost-marshal's guard to arrest Jeremy on the well-known principle that a bird in the hand can be strafed more easily than one with a medical certificate.  The bush was the place for our bird until such time as the P.M.O.'s signature should adorn the necessary piece of paper;  so we three rode up in a cab together to the Sikh hospital, and had a rare time trying to get in.  You see, there was a Sikh on guard outside, who respected nothing under heaven but his orders.  He wouldn't have known Grim in any event, being only recently from India;  Grim's uniform would have passed him in, but he and Jeremy were still arrayed as Arabs, and my civilian clothes entitled me in the sentry's opinion to protection lest I commit the heinous sin of impertinence.  An Arab in his eyes was as an insect, and a white man, who consorted with such creatures, not a person to be taken seriously.  But our friend Narayan Singh was in the hospital, enjoying the wise veteran's prerogative of resting on full pay after his strenuous adventures along with us at Abu Kem.  There was nothing whatever the matter with him.  He recognized Grim's voice and emerged through the front door with a milk-white smile flashing in the midst of newly-curled black hair--dignified, immense, and full of instant understanding.  Grim said a few words to Narayan Singh in Arabic, which so far as the sentry was concerned wasn't a language, but Narayan Singh spoke in turn in Punjabi, and the man just out from India began to droop like Jonah's gourd under the old soldier's scorn.  In consequence we got a full salute with arms presented, and walked in without having to trouble anybody in authority, Narayan Singh leading with the air of an old-time butler showing royalty to their rooms.  He even ascertained in an aside, that the doctor of the day was busy operating, and broke that good news with consummate tact:  \"The sahibs' lightest wish is law, but if they should wish to speak with the doctor sahib, it would be necessary to call him forth from the surgery, where he works behind locked doors.  Is it desired that I should summon him?\"  \"Operation serious?\" asked Grim, and neither man smiled.  It was perfect acting.  \"Very, sahib.  He removes the half of a sepoy's liver.\"  \"Uh!  Couldn't think of interrupting him.  Too bad!  Lead the way.\"  But we didn't enter the ward until Narayan Singh and an orderly had placed two screens around number nineteen cot, in the way they do when a man is dying, and had placed three chairs at the bedside contrary to the regulations printed on the wall.  Then Narayan Singh stood on guard outside the screens, but didn't miss much of the conversation, I believe.  The man in bed was wounded badly, but not fatally, and though his eyes blazed with fever he seemed to have some of his wits about him.  He recognized Grim after staring hard at him for about a minute.  \"Jimgrim!\"  \"Sidi bin Tagim, isn't it?  Well, well I thought it might be you,\" said Grim, speaking the northern dialect of Arabic, which differs quite a bit from that spoken around Jerusalem.  \"Who are these?\" asked the man in bed, speaking hoarsely as he stared first at Jeremy and then at me.  \"Jmil Ras, a friend of mine,\" Grim answered.  \"And that one?\"  He didn't like the look of me at all.  Western clothes and a shaven face spell nothing reassuring to the Arab when in trouble; he has been \"helped\" by the foreigner a time or two too often.  \"An American named Ramsden.  Also a friend of mine.\"  \"Oh!  An Amirikani?  A hakim?\"  \"No.  Not a doctor.  Not a man to fear.  He is a friend of Feisul.\"  \"On whose word?\"  \"Mine,\" Grim answered.  Sidi bin Tagim nodded.  He seemed willing to take Grim's word for anything.  \"Why did you say a Jew stabbed you?\" Grim asked suddenly.  \"So that they might hang a Jew or two.  Wallah!  Are the Jews not at the bottom of all trouble?  If a Greek should kill a Maltese it would be a Jew who planned it!  May the curse of Allah change their faces and the fire of Eblis consume them!\"  \"Did you see the man who stabbed you?\"  \"Yes.\"  And was he a Jew?\"  \"Jimgrim, you know better than to ask that!  A Jew always hires another to do the killing.  He who struck me was a hireling, who shall die by my hand, as Allah is my witness.  But may Allah do more to me and bring me down into the dust unburied unless I make ten Jews pay for this!\"  \"Any one Jew in particular?\" Grim asked, and the man in bed closed up like a clam that has been touched.  He was a strange-looking fellow--rather like one of those lean Spaniards whom Goya used to paint, with a scant beard turning grey, and hollow cheeks.  He had thrown off the grey army blanket because fever burned him, and his lean, hard muscles stood out as if cast in bronze.  \"But for the Jews, Feisul would be king of all this land this minute!\" he said suddenly, and closed up tight again.  Grim smiled.  He nearly always does smile when apparently at a loose end.  At moments when most cross-examiners would browbeat he grows sympathetic--humours his man, and, by following whatever detour offers, gets back on the trail again.  \"How about the French?\" he asked.  \"May Allah smite them!  They are all in the pay of Jews!\"  \"Can you prove it?\"  \"Wallah!  That I can!\"  Grim looked incredulous.  Those baffling eyes of his twinkled with quiet amusement, and the man in bed resented it.  \"You laugh, Jimgrim, but if you would listen I might tell you something.\"  But Grim only smiled more broadly than ever.  \"Sidi bin Tagim, you're one of those fanatics who think the world is all leagued against you.  Why should the Jews think you sufficiently important to be murdered?\"  \"Wallah!  There are few who hold the reins of happenings as I do.\"  \"If they'd killed you they'd have stopped the clock, eh?\"  \"That is as Allah may determine.  I am not dead.\"  \"Have you friends in Jerusalem?\"  \"Surely.\"  \"Strange that they haven't been to see you.\"  \"Wallah!  Not strange at all.\"  \"I see.  They regard you as a man without authority, who might make trouble and leave other men to face it, eh?\"  \"Who says I have no authority?\"  \"Well, if you could prove you have--\"  \"What then?\" the man in bed demanded, trying to sit up.  \"Feisul, for instance,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10551"],["title","Affair in Araby (#3)"],["body","a friend of mine, and these men with me are his friends too.  You have no letter, of course, for that would be dangerous...\"  \"Jimgrim, in the name of the Most High, I swear I had a letter! He who stabbed me took it.  I--\"  \"Was the letter from Feisul?\"  \"Malaish--no matter.  It was sealed, and bore a number for the signature.  If you can get that letter for me, Jimgrim--but what is the use! You are a servant of the British.\"  \"Tell me who stabbed you and I'll get you the letter.\"  \"No, for you are clever.  You would learn too much.  Better tell the doctor of this place to hurry up and heal me;  then I will attend to my own affairs.\"  \"I'd like to keep you out of jail, if that's possible,\" Grim answered. \"You and I are old acquaintances, Sidi bin Tagim.  But of course, if you're here to sow sedition, and should there be a document at large in proof of it, which document should fall into the hands of the police-- well, I couldn't do much for you then. You'd better tell me who stabbed you, and I'll get after him.\"  \"Ah!  But if you get the letter?\"  \"I shall read it, of course.\"  \"But to whom will you show it?\"  \"Perhaps to my friends here.\"  \"Are they bound by your honour?\"  \"I shall hold them so.\"  There was the glint in Grim's eye now that should warn anyone who knew him that the scent was hot;  added to the fact that the rest of his expression suggested waning interest, that look of his forebode fine hunting.  \"There's one other I might consult,\" he admitted casually.  \"On my way here I saw one of Feisul's staff captains driving in a cab toward the Jaffa Gate.\"  The instant effect of that remark was to throw the wounded man into a paroxysm of mingled rage and fear.  He almost threw a fit. His already bloodless face grew ashy grey and livid blue alternately, and he would have screamed at Grim if the cough that began to rack his whole body would have let him.  As it was, he gasped out unintelligible words and sought to make Grim understand by signs.  And Grim apparently did understand.  \"Very well,\" he laughed, \"tell me who stabbed you and I won't mention your name to Staff-Captain Abd el Kadir.\"  \"And these men?  Will they say nothing?\"  \"Not a word.  Who stabbed you?\"  \"Yussuf Dakmar!  May Allah cut him off from love and mercy!\"  \"Golly!\" exploded Jeremy, forgetting not to talk English. \"There's a swine for you!  Yussuf Dakmar's the son of a sea-cook who used to sell sheep to the Army four times over--drive 'em into camp and get a receipt--drive 'em out again next night--bring 'em back in the morning-- get a receipt again--drive 'em off--bring 'em back--us chaps too busy shifting brother Turk to cotton on.  He'll be the boy I kicked out of camp once.  Maybe remembers it too.  I'll bet his backbone's twanging yet!  Lead me to him, Grim, old cock, I'd like another piece of him!\"  But Grim was humming to himself, playing piano on the bed-sheet with his fingers.  \"Is that man not an Arab?\" asked the fellow in bed, taking alarm all over again.  \"Arab your aunt!\" laughed Jeremy:  \"I eat Arabs!  I'm the only original genuine woolly bad man from way back!  I'm the plumber who pulled the plug out of Arabia!  You know English?  Good!  You know what a dose of salts is then?  You've seen it work? Experienced it, maybe?  Hah! You'll understand me.  I'm a grain of the Epsom Salt that went through Beersheba, time the Turks had all the booze in sight and we were thirsty.  Muddy booze it was too--oozy booze--not fit for washing hogs! Ever heard of Anzacs? Well, I'm one of 'em.  Now you know what the scorpion who stung you's up against!  You lie there and think about it, cocky;  I'll show you his shirt tomorrow morning.\"  \"Suppose we go now,\" suggested Grim.  \"I've got the drift of this thing. Get the rest elsewhere.\"  \"You can fan that Joskins for a lot more yet,\" Jeremy objected. \"The plug's pulled.  He'll flow if you let him.\"  Grim nodded.  \"Sure he would.  Don't want too much from him.  Don't want to have to arrest him.  Get me?\"  \"Come on then,\" answered Jeremy, \"I've promised him a shirt!\"  Beyond the screen Narayan Singh stood like a statue, deaf, dumb, immovable.  Even his eyes were fixed with a blank stare on the wall opposite.  \"How much did you hear?\" Grim asked him.  \"I, sahib?  I am a sick man.  I have been asleep.\"  \"Dream anything?\"  \"As your honour pleases!\"  \"Hospital's stuffy, isn't it?  Think you could recover health more rapidly outdoors?  Sick-leave continued of course, but--how about a little exercise?\"  The Sikh's eyes twinkled.  \"Sahib, you know I need exercise!\"  \"I'll speak to the doctor for you.  In case he signs a new certificate, report to me tonight.\"  \"Atcha, Jimgrim sahib!  Atcha!\"     CHAPTER III  \"Hum Dekta hai\"   Like most of the quarters occupied by British officers, the house occupied by Major Roger Ticknor and his wife Mabel was \"enemy property,\" and its only virtue consisted in its being rent free. Grim, Jeremy, little Ticknor and his smaller wife, and I sat facing across a small deal table with a stuttering oil-lamp between us.  In a house not far away some Orthodox Jews, arrayed in purple and green and orange, with fox-fur around the edges of their hats, were drunk and celebrating noisily the Feast of Esther;  so you can work out the exact date if you're curious enough.  The time was nine p.m.  We had talked the Anzac hurricane-drive through Palestine all over again from the beginning, taking world-known names in vain and doing honour to others that will stay unsung for lack of recognition, when one of those unaccountable pauses came, and for the sake of breaking silence, Mabel Ticknor asked a question.  She was a little, plucky, pale-faced thing whom you called instinctively by her first name at the end of half an hour--a sort of little mother of loose-ended men, who can make silk purses out of sows' ears, and wouldn't know how to brag if she were tempted.  \"Say, Jim,\" she asked, turning her head quickly like a bird toward Grim on my left, \"what's your verdict about that man from Syria that Roger took in a cab to the Sikh hospital?  I'm out a new pair of riding breeches if Roger has to pay the bill for him. I want my money's worth. Tell me his story.\"  \"Go ahead and buy the breeches, Mabel.  I'll settle that bill,\" he answered.  \"No, you won't, Jim!  You're always squandering money.  Half your pay goes to the scallywags you've landed in jail.  This one's up to Roger and me;  we found him.\"  Grim laughed.  \"I can charge his keep under the head of 'information paid for.' I shall sign the voucher without a qualm.\"  \"You'd get blood out of a stone, Jim!  Go on, tell us!\"  \"I'm hired to keep secrets as well as discover them,\" Grim answered, smiling broadly.  \"Of course you are,\" she retorted.  \"But I know all Roger's secrets, and he's a doctor, mind you!  Am I right, Roger?  Come along!  There are no servants--no eavesdroppers.  Wait.  I'll put tea on the table, and then we'll all listen.\"  She made tea Australian fashion in a billy, which is quick and simple, but causes alleged dyspepsia cures to sell well all the way from Adelaide to the Gulf of Carpentraia.  \"You'll have to tell her, Jim,\" said Jeremy.  \"Mabel's safe as an iron roof,\" put in her husband.  \"Noisy in the rain, but doesn't leak.\"  But neither man nor woman could have extracted a story from James Schuyler Grim unless it suited him to tell it.  Mabel Ticknor is one of those honest little women who carry men's secrets with them up and down the world.  Being confided in by nearly every man who met her was a habit.  But Grim tells only when the telling may accomplish something, and I wondered, as he laid his elbow on the table to begin, just what use he meant to make of Mabel Ticknor.  He uses what he knows as other level-headed men use coin, spending thriftily for fair advantage.  \"That is secret,\" he began, as soon as Mabel had dumped the contents of the billy into a huge brown teapot.  \"I expect Narayan Singh here presently.  He'll have a letter with him, taken from the Syrian who stabbed that man in the hospital.\"  \"Whoa, hoss!\" Jeremy interrupted.  \"You mean you've sent that Sikh to get the shirt of Yussuf Dakmar?\"  Grim nodded.  \"That was my job,\" Jeremy objected.  \"Whoa, hoss, yourself, Jeremy!\" Grim answered.  \"You'd have gone down into the bazaar like a bull into a china-shop.  Narayan Singh knows where to find him.  If he shows fight, he'll be simply handed over to the Sikh patrol for attacking a man in uniform, and by the time he reaches the lock-up that letter will be here on the table between us.\"  \"All the same, that's a lark you've done me out of,\" Jeremy insisted. \"That Yussuf Dakmar's a stinker.  I know all about him.  Two whole squadrons had to eat lousy biscuit for a week because that swab sold the same meat five times over.  But I'll get him yet!\"  \"Well, as I was saying,\" Grim resumed, \"there's a letter in Jerusalem that's supposed to be from Feisul.  But when Feisul writes anything he signs his name to it, whereas a number is the signature on this.  Now that fellow Sidi bin Tagim in the hospital is an honest old kite in his way.  He's a great rooter for Feisul.  And the only easy way to ditch a man like Feisul, who's as honest as the day is long, and no man's fool, is to convince his fanatical admirers that for his own sake he ought to be forced along a certain course.  The game's as old as Adam. You fill up a man like Sidi bin Tagim with tales about Jews--convince him that Jews stand between Feisul and a kingdom--and he'll lend a hand in any scheme ostensibly directed against Jews. Get me?\"  \"So would I!\" swore Jeremy.  \"I'm against 'em too!  I camped alongside the Jordan Highlanders one time when--\"  But we had had that story twice that evening with variations. He was balancing his chair on two legs, so I pushed him over backward, and before he could pick himself up again Grim resumed.  \"Feisul is in Damascus, and the Syrian Convention has proclaimed him king.  That don't suit the French, who detest "]]]
