I could not imagine what had formed this wood, and it remained a complete puzzle to me until the following spring, when I found in the expanding shoots, that, wherever a flower-cluster was present, there were one or two pairs of leaflets already well developed in the axils, and that the next season's buds were forming between them, while the internodes of these leaflets were making quite a rapid growth. Subsequently, I found the leaflets also in the buds themselves. I found these leaflets developed on the tree only in the shoots containing flower-clusters, where they would be needed for the future growth of the branches. I suppose the reason must be that the flower-cluster does not use all the nourishment provided and that therefore the axillary buds are able to develop. It would be interesting to know what determines the stronger growth of the one which eventually becomes the leader.]  There is one thing more the pupils may have noticed. The small round dots all over the young stem, which become long rifts in the older parts, are breaks in the epidermis, or skin of the stem, through which the inner layers of bark protrude. They are called lenticels. They provide a passage for gases in and out of the stem. In some trees, as the Birch, they are very noticeable.  After discussing the subject thoroughly in the class-room, the pupils should rewrite their papers, and finally answer the following questions, as a species of review. I have thus spent three recitations on the Horsechestnut. The work is all so new, and, if properly presented, so interesting, that a good deal of time is required to exhaust its possibilities of instruction. If the teacher finds his scholars wearying, however, he can leave as many of the details as he pleases to be treated in connection with other branches.   QUESTIONS ON THE HORSECHESTNUT.  How many scales are there in the buds you have examined?  How are they arranged?  How many leaves are there in the buds?  How are they arranged?  Where does the flower-cluster come in the bud?  Do all the buds contain flower-clusters?  What is the use of the wool and the gum?  Where do the buds come on the stem?  Which are the strongest?  How are the leaves arranged on the stem?  Do the pairs stand directly over each other?  What are the dots on the leaf-scars?  How old is your branch?  How old is each twig?  Which years were the best for growth?  Where were the former flower-clusters?  What happens when a branch is stopped in its growth by flowering?  What effect does this have on the appearance of the tree?  In some parts of the country the Horsechestnut is not so commonly planted as in New England. In the southern states the Magnolia may be used in its stead, but it is not nearly so simple an example of the main points to be observed.[1]  [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. VII. Trees in Winter.]   MAGNOLIA UMBRELLA.  The bud may be examined by removing the scales with a knife, as in Horsechestnut, and also by cutting sections. The outer scales enfold the whole bud, and each succeeding pair cover all within. They are joined, and it is frequently difficult to tell where the suture is, though it can generally be traced at the apex of the bud. On the back is a thick stalk, which is the base of the leaf-stalk. Remove the scales by cutting carefully through a single pair, opposite the leaf-stalk, and peeling them off. The scales are modified stipules, instead of leaf-stalks, as in Horsechestnut. The outer pair are brown and thick, the inner green, and becoming more delicate and crumpled as we proceed toward the centre of the bud. The leaves begin with the second or third pair of scales. The first one or two are imperfect, being small, brown, and dry. The leaves grow larger towards the centre of the bud. They are covered with short, silky hairs, and are folded lengthwise, with the inner surface within (_conduplicate_). In the specimens I have examined I do not see much difference in size between the buds with flowers and those without. In every bud examined which contained a flower, there was an axillary bud in the axil of the last, or next to the last, leaf. This bud is to continue the interrupted branch in the same way as in Horsechestnut.  There are from six to ten good leaves, in the buds that I have seen. Those without flowers contain more leaves, as in Horsechestnut. In the centre of these buds the leaves are small and undeveloped. The flower is very easy to examine, the floral envelopes, stamens and pistils, being plainly discernible. The bud may also be studied in cross-section. This shows the whole arrangement. The plan is not so simple as in Horsechestnut, where the leaves are opposite. The subject of leaf-arrangement should be passed over until phyllotaxy is taken up.  The scars on the stem differ from Horsechestnut in having no distinct bands of rings. The scales, being stipules, leave a line on each side of the leaf-scar, and these are separated by the growth of the internodes. In the Beech, the scales are also stipules; but, whereas in the Magnolia there are only one or two abortive leaves, in the Beech there are eight or nine pairs of stipules without any leaves at all. The rings thus become separated in Magnolia, while in the Beech the first internodes are not developed, leaving a distinct band of rings, to mark the season's growth. The Magnolia is therefore less desirable to begin upon. The branches are swollen at the beginning of a new growth, and have a number of leaf-scars crowded closely together. The leaf-scars are roundish, the lower line more curved. They have many dots on them. From each leaf-scar runs an irregular line around the stem. This has been left by the stipules.  The flower-scar is on the summit of the axis, and often apparently in the axil of a branch, as in Horsechestnut. Sometimes the nearest axillary bud is developed; sometimes there are two, when the branch forks. The axillary buds seldom grow unless the terminal bud is interrupted. The tree therefore has no fine spray.   LILAC _(Syringa vulgaris_).  Ask the scholars to write a description of their branches and to compare them with Horsechestnut. These papers should be prepared before coming into the class, as before.  The buds are four-sided. The scales and leaves are opposite, as in Horsechestnut. The outer pair sometimes have buds in their axils. Remove the scales one by one with a knife, or better, with a stout needle. The scales gradually become thinner as we proceed, and pass into leaves, so that we cannot tell where the scales end and leaves begin. After about six pairs are removed, we come, in the larger buds, to leaves with axillary flower-clusters. The leaves grow smaller and the flower-clusters larger till we come to the centre, where the axis is terminated by a flower-cluster. There is a great difference in the buds on different bushes and on shoots of the same bush, some being large, green, and easy to examine, others small, hard, and dark-colored. It is better, of course, to select as soft and large buds as possible for examination.  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Lilac. I. Branch in winter state: _a_, leaf-scar; _b_, bud-scar (reduced). 2. Same, less reduced. 3. Branch, with leaf-buds expanded. 4. Series in a single bud, showing the gradual transition from scales to leaves.]  That the scales are modified leaves is plainly shown by the gradual transition they undergo, and also by the fact that buds are developed in their axils. If any of these can be shown to the pupils, remind them of the experiment where the top of a seedling Pea was cut off and buds forced to develop in the axils of the lower scales.[1] The transition from scales to leaves can be well studied by bringing branches into the house, where they will develop in water, and towards spring may even be made to blossom. Cherry, Apple, Forsythia, and other blossoming trees and shrubs can be thus forced to bloom. Place the branches in hot water, and cut off a little of their ends under water. If the water is changed every day, and the glass kept near the register or stove, they will blossom out very quickly. These expanded shoots may be compared with the buds. The number of leaves in the bud varies.  [Footnote 1: See p. 31.]  The leaf-scars of Lilac are horseshoe-shaped and somewhat swollen. It can often be plainly seen that the outer tissue of the stem runs up into the scar. It looks as if there were a layer of bark, ending with the scar, fastened over each side of the stem. These apparent layers alternate as well as the scars. The epidermis, or skin of the leaves, is in fact always continuous with that of the stem. There are no dots on the leaf-scars.  The rings are not nearly so noticeable as in Horsechestnut, but they can be counted for some years back.  The flower-cluster can often be traced by a dried bit of stem remaining on the branch.  The terminal bud in the Lilac does not usually develop, and the two uppermost axillary buds take its place, giving to the shrub the forked character of its branching. In all these bud studies, the pupil should finish by showing how the arrangement of the buds determines the growth of the branches.   QUESTIONS ON THE LILAC.  How do the scales differ from those of Horsechestnut?  How many scales and leaves are there?  How are they arranged?  Where does the flower-cluster come in the bud?  Do all the buds contain flower-clusters?  How does the arrangement of leaves and flower-clusters differ from that of Horsechestnut?  How old is your branch?  Which buds develop most frequently?  How does this affect the appearance of the shrub?   COPPER BEECH (_Fagus sylvatica, var. purpurea_).  The buds are long and tapering, the scales thin and scarious, the outer naked, the inner with long, silky hairs. Remove the scales one by one, as in Lilac. The outer four or six pairs are so minute that the arrangement is not very clear, but as we proceed we perceive that the scales are in alternate"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10726"],["title","Outlines of Lessons in Botany, Part I; from Seed to Leaf (#8)"],["body","airs, as in Horsechestnut; that is, that two scales are exactly on the same plane. But we have learned in the Lilac that the scales are modified leaves, and follow the leaf-arrangement of the species. The Beech is alternate-leaved, and we should therefore expect the scales to alternate. The explanation is found as we go on removing the scales. At the eighth or ninth pair we come upon a tiny, silky leaf, directly between the pair of scales, and, removing these, another larger leaf, opposite the first but higher up on the rudimentary stem, and so on, with the rest of the bud. There are five or more leaves, each placed between a pair of scales. Our knowledge of the parts of a leaf shows us at once that the scales must be modified stipules, and that therefore they must be in pairs.[1] Other examples of scales homologous with stipules are the American Elm, Tulip-tree, Poplar and Magnolia. The leaves are plaited on the veins and covered with long, silky hairs. The venation is very distinct. The outer leaves are smaller and, on examining the branch, it will be seen that their internodes do not make so large a growth as the leaves in the centre of the bud.  [Footnote 1: See the stipules of the Pea, p. 31.]  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Copper Beech. 1. Branch in winter state: _a_, leaf-scar; _b_, bud-scar. 2. Branch, with leaf-buds expanding, showing the plicate folding of the leaves.]  The leaf-scars are small, soon becoming merely ridges running half round the stem.  The bud-rings are very plain and easily counted. For this reason, and because it branches freely, it is a good tree for measurements of growth, as is seen in the following tables. Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4: were made by a class of girls, from fourteen to sixteen, from a tree on my lawn. No. 5 was made by a pupil, whom I taught by correspondence, from a tree of the same species in another town. No. 6 was made by myself from my own tree. The measurements of the first four tables were somewhat revised by me, as they were not perfectly accurate. The pupils should always be cautioned to measure from the beginning of one set of rings to the beginning of the next.[1]  [Footnote 1: Care must be taken to select branches well exposed to the light. Of course there are many circumstances that may aid or hinder the growth of any particular branch.]  NO. 1.  YEARS. GROWTH OF  1ST BRANCH. 2nd BRANCH. 3RD BRANCH 4TH BRANCH.

One question brought up by these measurements is whether there is any correspondence in growth between the main axis and its branches. It appears in these tables that there is a general correspondence, in this tree at least. In the recitation of the class, whose tables are given above (Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4), we took all the measurements of these four branches for the year 1885 and added them. We did the same for 1886, and compared the results. The total growth for 1885 was 31-15/16 inches; for 1886, leaving out the measurement of the twig whose entire growth was in that year, 109-3/4 inches or nearly 3-1/2 times as much. The proportion held in a general way throughout, there being only a single case of a branch where the growth was greater in the first year.[1] But there is a point that must not be overlooked in this connection. The branches of the Beech seem to grow about equally well in the first, second, third, or any succeeding year. In some trees, as the Ash, the axillary buds make a large growth, and the succeeding terminal buds carry on the branch much more slowly; in other trees, as the Cherry, a branch grows very slowly in the first few years and then suddenly takes a start. These facts would appear in tables of growth, made from branches of these trees, but the addition of results for any particular year would have no significance.  [Footnote 1: The spring of 1880 was a remarkably early one. Thus I find in my diary of that year the following entries:--  April 17. The red maples are in full bloom, the elms almost over. The leaves of the Horsechestnut are quite large. The lilacs are nearly in leaf. April 24. We went up to Waverley and found bloodroot up, spice bush out, violets, dog-tooths and anemones, also caltha. April 28. All the cherries are in full bloom. April 29. Picked an apple blossom in bud, beautifully pink.  The season was nearly three weeks earlier than usual. 1885 on the other hand was a late spring.]  In table No. 5, the addition of the measurements for 1885 and 1886 shows the growth in the latter year to be about twice that of the former. This branch came from a tree in another town. We have tried also to discover whether the number of leaves each year has any relation to growth. I cannot see that it has, but it requires many experiments to determine these points. To study this, make tables of the number of leaves on the branch each year. I think teachers would find it interesting to keep all data of this kind of work done by their classes, with a view to tabulation and comparison. The scholars themselves are exceedingly interested in anything that partakes of the nature of an original investigation.[1]  [Footnote 1: The class, previously mentioned, were much interested in the addition of their results. One of them asked me whether this subject of measurements had been treated in any book. I replied that I had never seen it mentioned. My attention was afterwards called to \"What may be learned from a Tree,\" by Prof. Harlan Couitas. D. Appleton & Co., New York, 1863. I found, greatly to my surprise, that he had not only given diagrams of growth, but that he also had selected a Copper Beech as his example.]  The leaf-arrangement of the Beech is alternate, on the one-half plan. The small twigs turn upwards, so that all the spray is on the upper side, giving a flat appearance to the branch.[1] This gives the leaves a better exposure to the light. Both the terminal and axillary buds grow freely, thus forming long, straight limbs, with many branches and much fine spray.  [Footnote 1: Phyllotaxy is treated later, by a comparison and study of many branches, but the teacher can draw the pupils' attention to the fact that each Beech leaf and twig is on exactly the opposite side of the branch from the preceding one. This allows all the twigs to grow towards one side of the branch, whereas in trees on"]]]
