He is a very fine--gentleman. Ah--did Mr. Bloodgood invite--er--any of you to come into the--ah--game?\"  Frank fancied he saw a sudden light. Was it possible Mr. Slush was looking for \"suckers?\"  Was it possible he had been sent there to inveigle them into the party, so that some sharp might \"skin\" them? It did not seem improbable.  Harry seemed to catch onto the same idea, for he popped up in his bunk suddenly, but a sudden roll of the steamer caused him to sink down again with a groan.  Diamond's eyes began to glitter. He, too, fancied he saw the little game.  \"No,\" said Merry, slowly, \"he did not invite any of us to come in.\"  The little man seemed relieved.  \"I--I didn't know,\" he faltered. \"If he had--I--I was going to say something. Perhaps it is not--necessary.\"  \"Perhaps not,\" said Frank; \"but it may not do any hurt to say it.\"  \"And it may do some hurt--to you,\" muttered Diamond under his breath. \"I will kick this fellow!\"  But, to the surprise of all, the superstitious man cackled out a short, broken laugh, and said:  \"Oh, I was going to--to warn you--that's all. It--it's liable to be a pretty--stiff game. I thought it would be a--good thing for you to--keep out of it. It started--light, but it's working--up--right along. Almost any time somebody is liable to--to propose throwing off the--the limit, and then somebody is going to get--hurt. If you are--not in it, why you won't be in any--danger.\"  There was a silence. The four youths looked at the visitor and then at each other.  What did it mean?  If he was playing them for \"suckers,\" surely he was doing it in a queer manner.  \"Thank you,\" said Frank, stiffly. \"You are kind!\"  \"More than kind!\" muttered Diamond.  \"Don't mention it,\" said the little man, trying to look pleasant, but making a dismal failure. \"I--I dont' like to see respectable young men caught in a--trap. That's all. Thought I'd tell you. Didn't know that you would--thank me. Took my chances on that. Well, I think I'll--be going.\"  He turned, falteringly, seemed about to say something more, opened the door part way, hesitated, then said \"good-day,\" and went out.     CHAPTER VI.  THE CARGO OF THE \"EAGLE.\"   \"Well?\"  \"Well!\"  \"Well!\"  The same word, but from three different persons, and spoken in three different inflections.  \"Will somebody please hit me with something hard!\" murmured Jack.  \"What does it mean, Merry?\" asked Rattleton.  \"You may search me!\" exclaimed Frank, in rather expressive slang, something in which he seldom indulged, unless under great provocation.  Browning had said nothing. He was pulling steadily at his pipe, quite unaware that it had gone out.  \"What do you make of Mr. Peddington Slush?\" asked Jack.  \"I don't know what to make of him,\" confessed Frank. \"About the only thing of which I am sure is that he has a corker for a name. That name is enough to make any man look sad and dejected.\"  \"What did he come here for, anyhow?\" asked Rattleton.  \"To find out about Raymond Bloodgood--he said.\"  \"I know he said so, but I don't stake any talk--I mean take any stock in that. What difference does it make to him who Bloodgood is?\"  \"That was something he did not make clear.\"  \"He didn't seem to make anything clear,\" declared Jack. \"I thought for sure that he was going to throw out some hooks to drag us into that game of poker. If he had, I should have known he was sent here, and I'd kicked him out, whether you had been willing or not, Merry!\"  \"I'd opened the door and held it wide for you,\" smiled Frank.  \"What do you think of him, Browning?\" asked Harry.  \"His way of talking made me very tired,\" yawned the big fellow. \"He seemed to work so hard to get anything out.\"  \"I'll allow that we have had two rather queer visitors,\" said the Virginian.  \"And I shall take an interest in them both after this,\" declared Frank.  \"Talk about superstitious persons, I believe he heads the list,\" from Jack.  \"He said he was not superstitious,\" laughed Merry.  \"But the cat worried him.\"  \"And my twiddling my thumbs,\" put in Bruce.  \"And this dagger pin in my scarf,\" said Frank.  \"It's a wonder he didn't prophecy shipwreck, or something of that sort,\" groaned Rattleton, who had settled at full length in his berth. \"If this rolling motion keeps up, I shall get so I won't care if we are wrecked.\"  \"He must be a dandy in a good swift game of poker!\" laughed Frank. \"I shouldn't think he'd be able to make up his mind how to discard. He'd be a drawback to the game, or I'm much mistaken.\"  \"It strikes me that he'd be easy fruit,\" said Rattleton.  \"He looks like a 'sucker' himself, but sometimes it is impossible to tell about a man till after you see him play. Anyhow, these two visits were something to break the monotony of the voyage. It promised to be pretty lively at the start, but it has settled down to be rather quiet.\"  Bloodgood and Slush proved good food for conversation, but the boys tired of that after a while.  Diamond went out by himself, and Frank went to Tutor Maybe's room, where he spent the time till the gong sounded for supper.  \"Come, Harry,\" said Frank, appearing in the stateroom, \"aren't you ready for supper?\"  Rattleton gave a groan.  \"Don't talk to me about eating!\" he exclaimed. \"It makes me sick to think about it. Leave me--let me die in peace!\"  Jack was not there, so Frank and Bruce washed up and went out together. They were nearly through eating when the Virginian came in and took his place near them at the table.  Usually the captain sat at the head of that table, but he was not there now.  \"Where have you been?\" asked Frank.  \"Getting onto a few things,\" said Jack, in a peculiar way.  \"Why, what's the matter with you?\" asked Bruce, pausing to stare at the Southerner. \"You are pale as a ghost!\"  \"Am I?\" said Diamond, his voice sounding rather strained and unnatural.  \"Sure thing. I wouldn't advise you to eat any more, and perhaps you hadn't better look at the chandeliers while they are swinging. You'll be keeping Rattleton company.\"  \"Oh, I'm not sick--at least, not seasick,\" averred Jack.  \"Then what ails you? I was going to prescribe ginger ale if it was the first stage of seasickness. Sometimes that will brace a person up and straighten out his stomach.\"  \"Oh, don't talk remedies to me. I took medicine three days before I started on this voyage, and everybody I saw told me something to do to keep from being sick. I'm wearing a sheet of writing paper across my chest now.\"  When supper was over Jack motioned for his friends to follow him. The three went on deck and walked aft till they were quite alone.  The \"Eagle\" was plowing along over a deserted sea. The waves were running heavily, and night was shutting down grimly over the ocean.  \"What's the matter with you, Diamond?\" asked Browning. \"Why have you dragged us out here? It's cold, and I'd rather go into our stateroom and take a loaf after eating so heartily. By Jove! if this keeps up, they won't have provisions enough on this boat to feed me before we get across.\"  \"I wanted to have a little talk without,\" said Jack; \"and I didn't care about talking in the stateroom, where I might be overheard.\"  \"What's up, anyway?\" demanded Frank, warned by the manner of the Virginian that Jack fancied he had something of importance to tell them.  \"I've been investigating,\" said Jack.  \"What?\"  \"Well, I found out that there is something the matter on this boat.\"  \"Did you learn what it was?\"  \"I don't know that I have, but I've discovered one thing. I've learned the kind of cargo we carry.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"Petroleum and powder!\"     CHAPTER VII.  PREMONITIONS OF PERIL.   \"Well, that's hot stuff when it's burning,\" said Merriwell, grimly.  \"Rather!\" grunted Browning.  \"If I'd known what the old boat carried, I think I'd hesitated some about shipping on her,\" declared Jack. \"What if she did get on fire?\"  \"We'd all go up in smoke,\" said Merriwell, with absolute coolness. \"That is about the size of it.\"  \"Well,\" said Jack, \"I heard two of the sailors talking in a very mysterious manner. They say the 'Eagle' is hoodooed and the captain knows it. They say he has not slept any to speak of since we left New York.\"  \"Sailors are always superstitious. They are ignorant, as a rule, and ignorance breeds superstition.\"  \"Do you consider Mr. Slush ignorant?\" asked Bruce.  \"Didn't have time to size him up, but he's queer.\"  \"I shall feel that I am over a volcano during the rest of the voyage,\" said Jack. \"What if there was somebody on board who wished to destroy the ship?\"  \"It wouldn't be much of a job,\" grunted Browning. \"A match touched to a powder keg would do the trick in a hurry.\"  \"But he'd go up with the rest of us,\" said Frank.  \"Unless he used a slow match,\" put in Jack. \"These captains always have their enemies, who are desperate fellows and ready to do almost anything to injure them. The steamer might be set afire by means of a slow match, which would give the villain time enough to get away.\"  \"I hardly think there's anybody desperate enough to do that kind of a trick, for it would be a case of suicide.\"  \"Perhaps not. The chap who did the trick might have some plan of escaping. Then I have known men desperate enough to commit suicide if they could destroy an enemy at the same time.\"  \"Well, it's likely all this worry about this vessel and cargo is entirely needless and foolish.\"  \"I don't believe it,\" said the Virginian. \"I know now that the captain has been worried. I have noticed it in his manner. He is pale and restless.\"  \"Well, it's likely he may be rather anxious, for it's certain he cannot carry any insurance on such a cargo.\"  \"He was not at the table to-night.\"  \"No.\"  \"I'd give something to be on solid ground and away from this powder mill. You know that sometimes there is such a thing as an unaccountable explosion. A heavy sea must cause motion or friction in the cargo, and friction often starts a fire on shipboard. Fire on this vessel means a quick road to glory.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10904"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Nobility; Or, The Tragedy of the Ocean Tramp (#5)"],["body","  \"Huah!\" grunted Bruce. \"I'm not in the habit of worrying about things that may happen. It's cold out here. Let's go back to the stateroom.\"  \"It will be well enough to keep still about the nature of the cargo, Diamond,\" said Frank.  \"Oh, I shall keep still about that all right!\" assured Jack.  As they moved back along the deck they discovered somebody who was leaning over the rail and making all sorts of dismal sounds and groans.  \"The next time I go to Europe I'll stay at home!\" moaned this individual. \"Oh, my! oh, my! How bad I feel! Next that comes will be the shaps of my twos--I mean the taps of my shoes!\"  \"It's Rattles!\" laughed Frank, softly; \"and he is sicker than ever. He's tried to crawl out to get some air.\"  At this moment a man opened the door near Rattleton, and asked:  \"Is the--ah--er--moon up yet?\"  \"I don't know,\" moaned Harry. \"But it is if I swallowed it. Everything else is up, anyhow.\"  \"If the--ah--moon comes up red tonight, it will mean----\"  \"I don't give a rap what it means!\" snorted Rattleton. \"Don't talk to me! Let me die without torturing me! I'm sick enough without having you make me worse!\"  Mr. Slush, for he was the anxious inquirer about the moon, dodged back into the cabin, closing the door hesitatingly.  Then Rattleton, unaware of the proximity of his amused friends, hung over the rail and groaned again.  Frank walked up and spoke:  \"I see, my dear boy, that you are heeding the Bible admonition.\"  \"Hey?\" groaned Harry. \"What is it?\"  \"'Cast thy bread upon the waters!' You are doing it all right, all right.\"  \"Now, don't carry this thing too far!\" Rattleton tried to say in a fierce manner, but his fierceness was laughable. \"The worm will turn when trodden upon.\"  \"But the banana peel knows a trick worth two of that. Did you ever hear that touching little poem about the man who stepped on a banana peel? Never did? Why, that is too bad! You don't know what you've missed. Listen, and you shall hear it.\"  Then Frank solemnly declaimed:       \"He walked along one summer day,        As stately as a prince;      He stepped upon a banana peel,        And he hasn't 'banana' where since.\"  Rattleton gave a still more dismal groan.  \"You are conspiring with the elements to hasten my death!\" he said. \"I can't stand many more like that.\"  \"You should wear a sheet of writing paper across your breast, same as I do,\" said Diamond. \"Then you won't be sick.\"  \"I've got two sheets of writing paper across mine,\" declared Harry.  \"You should drink a bottle of ginger ale to settle your stomach,\" put in Frank.  \"Just drank three bottles of ginger ale, and they've turned my stomach wrong side out,\" gurgled the sick youth.  \"You should allow yourself perfect relaxation, and not try to fight against it,\" from Browning.  \"Oh, I haven't allowed myself anything else but perfect relaxation,\" came from Harry. \"You all make me tired!\"  Then he staggered into the cabin and disappeared on his way back to the stateroom.  Diamond and Browning followed, but Frank lingered behind.  Although he had kept the fact concealed, Merry was troubled with a strange foreboding of coming disaster. In every way he tried to overcome anything like superstition, but he remembered that, on many other occasions, he had been warned of coming trouble by just such feelings.  \"I'd like to know just what is going on upon this steamer,\" he muttered, as he walked forward. \"I feel as if something was wrong, and I shall not be satisfied till I investigate.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  IN THE STOKE-HOLE.   Frank found the chief engineer taking some air. Merry fell into conversation with the man, who was smoking and seemed quite willing to talk.  Having a pleasant and agreeable way, Frank easily led the engineer on, and it was not long before the man was quite taken with the chatty passenger.  Frank was careful not to seem inquisitive or prying, for he knew it would be easy to arouse the engineer's suspicions if there should be anything wrong on the steamer.  However, Merry was working for a privilege, and he obtained it. When he expressed a desire to go below and have a look at the engines and furnaces, the engineer invited him to come along.  They passed through a door, and then began a descent by means of iron ladders. The clanking roar of the machinery came up to them. Frank could hear and feel the throbbing heart beats of the great boat.  The engine room was quickly reached, and there the engineer showed him the massive machinery that moved with the regularity of clockwork and the grace and ease that came from great power and perfect adjustment.  All this was interesting, but Frank was anxious to go still deeper.  \"Go ahead,\" said the engineer, showing him the way. \"Down that ladder there. You'll be able to see the furnaces and the stokers at work. I don't believe you'll care to go into the stoke-hole.\"  Frank descended. Great heat came up to him, accompanied by a glow that shifted and changed, dying down suddenly at one moment and glaring out at the next. He could hear the ring of shovels and the clank of iron doors.  He reached an iron grating, where a fierce heat rolled up and seemed to scorch him. From that position he could look down into the stoke-hole and see the black, grimy, sweating, half-clad men at work there.  Above him, at the head of the ladder he had just descended, a pair of shining eyes glared down, but he saw them not. He had not observed a cleaner who was at work on the machinery in the engine-room, and who kept his hat pulled over his eyes till Frank departed.  The blackened stokers looked like grim demons of the fiery pit as they labored at the coal, which they were shoveling into the mouths of the greedy furnaces.  The shifting glow was caused by the opening and closing of the furnace doors, which clanged and rang.  For a moment the pit below would seem shrouded in almost Stygian darkness, save for some bar of light that gleamed out from a crack or draft, and then there would be a rattle of iron and a flare of blood-red light that came with the flinging open of a furnace door.  In the glare of light the bare-armed, dirt-grimed stokers would shovel, shovel, shovel, till it seemed a wonder that the fire was not completely deadened by so much coal.  Sometimes the doors of all the furnaces would seem open at once, and the glare and heat that came up from the place was something awful.  Merry wondered how human beings could live down there in that terrible place.  Some of the men were raking out ashes and hoisting it by means of a mechanism provided for the purpose.  Frank pitied the poor creatures who were forced to work down in that place. Yet he remembered it was not so many months since he had applied for the position of wiper in an engine round-house, obtained the job, and worked there with the grimiest and lowest employees of the railroad.  There was something fascinating in the black pit and the grimy men who labored down there in the glare and heat. Frank was so absorbed that he heard no sound, received no warning of danger.  Merry leaned out over the edge of the iron grating. Something struck on his back, he was clutched, thrust out, hurled from the grating!  It was done in a twinkling. He could not defend himself, but he made a clutch to save himself, caught something, swung in, struck against the iron ladder, and went tumbling and sliding downward.  At the moment when Frank was attacked, a glare of light had filled the pit. One of the stokers had turned his back to the gleaming mouths of the furnaces and looked upward, as if to relieve his aching eyes.  He saw everything that occurred on the grating. He saw a man slip down the ladder behind Frank and spring on his back. He saw that man hurl Frank from the grating.  The stoker uttered a shout and ran toward the foot of the ladder, expecting to find Frank laying there, severely injured or killed. He was astounded when he saw the ready-witted youth grasp the grating, swing in, strike the ladder, cling and slide.  Down Frank came with a rush, but he did not fall. He landed in the stoke-hole without being severely injured. He was on his feet in a twinkling, and up that ladder he went like a cat.  His assailant had darted up the ladder above and disappeared. Merry reached the grating from which he had been hurled, and then he ran up the other ladder.  He was soon in the engine-room.  In that room there was no excitement. The machinery was sliding and swinging in a regular manner, while the engineer sat watching its movements, talking to an assistant. Oilers and cleaners were at work.  \"Where is he?\" cried Frank, his voice sounding clear and distinct.  They looked at him in amazement.  \"What's the matter?\" asked the engineer, coming forward.  \"I was attacked from behind and thrown into the stoke-hole,\" Merry explained. \"The fellow who did it came in here.\"  \"Thrown into the stoke-hole?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"From where?\"  \"The grating at the foot of the first ladder.\"  The engineer looked doubtful.  \"My dear fellow,\" he said, \"you would have been maimed or killed. You do not seem to be harmed.\"  Frank realized that the engineer actually doubted his word.  \"He might have fallen,\" said the assistant; \"but it would have broken his neck.\"  \"I tell you I was attacked from behind and thrown down!\" exclaimed Frank. \"I managed to get hold of the ladder and slide, so I was not killed.\"  The engineer looked annoyed.  \"This is what comes of letting a passenger in here,\" he said. \"It's the last time I'll do it on my own responsibility. Now if you go out and tell you were thrown into the stoke-hole, there'll be any amount of fuss over it.\"  \"I am telling it right here,\" said Frank, grimly, \"and I want to know who did the trick. Somebody who came from this room must have done it.\"  \"Impossible!\"  \"Then where did he come from?\"  The engineer and his assistant looked at each other, and the former began to swear.  \"What do you think of it, Joe?\" he asked.  \"Think you made a mistake, Bill; but his"]]]
