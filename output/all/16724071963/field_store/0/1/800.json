Barely a sound was audible, and a hush of expectancy descended upon us.  I looked around at my men in the trench; some were quietly asleep, some writing letters, others conversed in subdued and hushed tones.  Every face I saw bore the unmistakable stamp of the feeling so characteristic of the last hour before a battle,--that curious mixture of solemn dignity, grave responsibility, and suppressed emotion, with an undercurrent of sad resignation.  They were pondering over their possible fate, or perhaps dreaming of their dear ones at home.  By and by even the little conversation ceased, and they sat quite silent, waiting and waiting, perhaps awed by their own silence. Sometimes one would bravely try to crack a joke, and they laughed, but it sounded strained.  They were plainly nervous, these brave men that fought like lions in the open when led to an attack, heedless of danger and destruction.  They felt under a cloud in the security of the trenches, and they were conscious of it and ashamed.  Sometimes my faithful orderly would turn his eye on me, mute, as if in quest of an explanation of his own feeling.  Poor dear unsophisticated boy! I was as nervous as they all were, although trying my best to look unconcerned; but I knew that the hush that hovered around us like a dark cloud would give way like magic to wild enthusiasm as soon as the first shot broke the spell and the exultation of the battle took hold of us all.  Suddenly, at about ten o'clock, a dull thud sounded somewhere far away from us, and simultaneously we saw a small white round cloud about half a mile ahead of us where the shrapnel had exploded. The battle had begun.  Other shots followed shortly, exploding here and there, but doing no harm.  The Russian gunners evidently were trying to locate and draw an answer from our batteries.  These, however, remained mute, not caring to reveal their position.  For a long time the Russians fired at random, mostly at too short a range to do any harm, but slowly the harmless-looking white clouds came nearer, until a shell, whining as it whizzed past us, burst about a hundred yards behind our trench.  A second shell followed, exploding almost at the same place.  At the same time, we noticed a faint spinning noise above us.  Soaring high above our position, looking like a speck in the firmament, flew a Russian aeroplane, watching the effect of the shells and presumably directing the fire of the Russian artillery.  This explained its sudden accuracy.  One of our aeroplanes rose, giving chase to the enemy, and simultaneously our batteries got into action.  The Russians kept up a sharply concentrated, well-directed fire against our center, our gunners responding gallantly, and the spirited artillery duel which ensued grew in intensity until the entrails of the earth seemed fairly to shake with the thunder.  By one o'clock the incessant roaring, crashing, and splintering of bursting shells had become almost unendurable to our nerves, which were already strained to the snapping-point by the lack of action and the expectancy.  Suddenly there appeared a thin dark line on the horizon which moved rapidly towards us, looking not unlike a huge running bird with immense outstretched wings.  We looked through our field glasses; there could be no doubt,--it was Russian cavalry, swooping down upon us with incredible impetus and swiftness.  I quickly glanced at our colonel.  He stared open-mouthed.  This was, indeed, good fortune for us,--too good to believe.  No cavalry attack could stand before well-disciplined infantry, providing the latter keep cool and well composed, calmly waiting until the riders come sufficiently close to take sure aim.  There was action for us at last.  At a sharp word of command, our men scrambled out of the trenches for better view and aim, shouting with joy as they did so.  What a change had come over us all! My heart beat with wild exultation.  I glanced at my men.  They were all eagerness and determination, hand at the trigger, eyes on the approaching enemy, every muscle strained, yet calm, their bronzed faces hardened into immobility, waiting for the command to fire. Every subaltern officer's eye hung on our colonel, who stood about thirty yards ahead of us on a little hill, his figure well defined in the sunlight, motionless, the very picture of calm assurance and proud bearing.  He scanned the horizon with his glasses.  Shrapnel was hailing around him, but he seemed utterly unaware of it; for that matter we had all forgotten it, though it kept up its terrible uproar, spitting here and there destruction into our midst.  By this time the avalanche of tramping horses had come perceptibly nearer.  Soon they would sweep by the bundle of hay which marked the carefully measured range within which our fire was terribly effective.  Suddenly the mad stampede came to an abrupt standstill, and then the Cossacks scattered precipitately to the right and left, only to disclose in their rear the advancing Russian infantry, the movements of which it had been their endeavor to veil.  The infantry moved forward in loose lines, endlessly rolling on like shallow waves overtaking each other, one line running forward, then suddenly disappearing by throwing itself down and opening fire on us to cover the advance of the other line, and so on, while their artillery kept up a hellish uproar spreading destruction through our lines.  Simultaneously a Russian aeroplane swept down upon us with a noise like an angered bird of prey and pelted us with bombs, the effects of which, however, were more moral than actual, for we had regained the security of the trenches and opened fire on the approaching enemy, who in spite of heavy losses advanced steadily until he reached our wire entanglements.  There he was greeted by a deadly fire from our machine guns.  The first Russian lines were mowed down as if by a gigantic scythe, and so were the reserves as they tried to advance.  The first attack had collapsed.  After a short time, however, they came on again, this time more cautiously, armed with nippers to cut the barbed wire and using the bodies of their own fallen comrades as a rampart.  Again they were repulsed. Once more their cavalry executed a feigned attack under cover of which the Russian infantry rallied, strongly reinforced by reserves, and more determined than ever.  Supported by heavy artillery fire their lines rolled endlessly on and hurled themselves against the barbed-wire fences.  For a short time it almost seemed, as if they would break through by sheer weight of numbers.  At that critical moment, however, our reserves succeeded in executing a flanking movement.  Surprised and caught in a deadly cross-fire, the Russian line wavered and finally they fled in disorder.  All these combined artillery, infantry, cavalry, and aeroplane attacks had utterly failed in their object of dislodging our center or shaking its position, each one being frustrated by the resourceful, cool alertness of our commanding general and the splendid heroism and stoicism of our troops.  But the strain of the continuous fighting for nearly the whole day without respite of any kind, or chance for food or rest, in the end told on the power of endurance of our men, and when the last attack had been successfully repulsed they lay mostly prostrated on the ground, panting and exhausted.  Our losses had been very considerable too, stretcher-bearers being busy administering first aid and carrying the wounded back to the nearest field hospital, while many a brave man lay stark and still.  By eight o'clock it had grown perceptibly cooler.  We now had time to collect our impressions and look about us.  The Russians had left many dead on the field, and at the barbed-wire entanglements which our sappers had constructed as an obstacle to their advance, their bodies lay heaped upon each other, looking not unlike the more innocent bundles of hay lying in the field.  We could see the small Red Cross parties in the field climbing over the horribly grotesque tumuli of bodies, trying to disentangle the wounded from the dead and administer first aid to them.  Enthusiasm seemed suddenly to disappear before this terrible spectacle.  Life that only a few hours before had glowed with enthusiasm and exultation, suddenly paled and sickened.  The silence of the night was interrupted only by the low moaning of the wounded that came regularly to us.  It was hideous in its terrible monotony.  The moon had risen, throwing fantastic lights and shadows over the desolate landscape and the heaped-up dead. These grotesque piles of human bodies seemed like a monstrous sacrificial offering immolated on the altar of some fiendishly cruel, antique deity.  I felt faint and sick at heart and near swooning away. I lay on the floor for some time unconscious of what was going on around me, in a sort of stupor, utterly crushed over the horrors about me.  I do not know how long I had lain there, perhaps ten minutes, perhaps half an hour, when suddenly I heard a gruff, deep voice behind me--the brigadier, who had come around to inspect and to give orders about the outposts.  His calm, quiet voice brought me to my senses and I reported to him.  His self-assurance, kindness, and determination dominated the situation.  Within five minutes he had restored confidence, giving definite orders for the welfare of every one, man and beast alike, showing his solicitude for the wounded, for the sick and weak ones, and mingling praise and admonition in just measure.  As by magic I felt fortified.  Here was a real man undaunted by nervous qualms or by over-sensitiveness. The horrors of the war were distasteful to him, but he bore them with equanimity.  It was, perhaps, the first time in my life that I regretted that my artistic"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10967"],["title","Four Weeks in the Trenches: The War Story of a Violinist (#5)"],["body"," had over-sharpened and overstrung my nervous system, when I saw how manfully and bravely that man bore what seemed to me almost unbearable.  His whole machinery of thinking was not complicated and not for a moment did qualms of \"Weltschmerz\" or exaggerated altruism burden his conscience and interfere with his straight line of conduct which was wholly determined by duty and code of honor.  In his private life he was an unusually kind man.  His solicitude for his subordinates, for prisoners, and for the wounded was touching, yet he saw the horrors of the war unflinchingly and without weakening, for were they not the consequences of the devotion of men to their cause? The whole thing seemed quite natural to him.  The man was clearly in his element and dominated it.  After having inspected the outposts, I went back, bedded myself in a soft sand-heap, covered myself up, and was soon fast and peacefully asleep.  During the night the dew moistened the sand, and when I awoke in the morning I found myself encased in a plastering which could not be removed for days.    III    Our hopes of getting a little rest and respite from the fighting were soon shattered, for a scouting aeroplane brought news that the Russians were again advancing in overwhelming strength.  Our commanding general, coming to the conclusion that with the reduced and weakened forces at his command he could not possibly offer any effective resistance to a renewed onslaught, had determined to fall back slowly before their pressure.  The consequence was a series of retreating battles for us, which lasted about ten days and which constituted what is now called the battle of Lemberg.  We were then terribly outnumbered by the Russians, and in order to extricate our army and prevent it from being surrounded and cut off, we constantly had to retreat, one detachment taking up positions to resist the advancing Russians, trying to hold them at all costs in order to give the rest of the army sufficient time to retire to safety. This maneuvering could not, of course, be carried out without the forces guarding the rear and covering the retreat suffering sometimes terrible losses.  These were depressing days, with rain and storm adding to the gloom.  The men tramped wearily, hanging their heads, ashamed and humiliated by the retreat, the necessity of which they could not grasp, having, as they thought, successfully repulsed the enemy.  It was difficult to make them understand that our regiment was only a cog in the huge wheel of the Austrian fighting machine and that, with a battle line extending over many miles, it was quite natural that partial successes could take place and yet the consideration of general strategy necessitate a retreat.  Our arguing made little impression on the men; for they only shook their heads and said, \"We were victorious, we should have gone on.\"  The spirit of retreating troops is vastly different from that shown by  an advancing army, and it was probably in recognition of this well-known psychological state that our general staff had in the beginning attacked the Russians wherever they could, in spite of the overwhelming superiority of the foe, but the reinforcements the Russians were able to draw upon had swelled their ranks so enormously that any attack would have been little short of madness.  The real hardships and privations for us began only now.  The few roads of Galicia, which at best are in bad condition, through the constant passing of heavy artillery and wagons of all kinds following each other in endless procession through constant rains, had become well-nigh impassable, the heavy mud constituting an additional impediment to the marching of troops.  In order to get all of the train carrying provisions out of the possible reach of a sudden raid by the Russian cavalry, it had to be sent miles back of us, so as not to interfere with the movement of the troops.  This caused somewhat of an interruption in the organization of the commissary department and very little food reached the troops, and that only at very long intervals.  The distribution of food to an army, even in peace and under the best conditions, is a very complicated and difficult undertaking. Provisions are shipped from the interior to the important railway centers, which serve as huge army depots and form the basis from which the different army corps draw their provisions and from which they are constantly replenished.  They in turn supply the divisions and brigades wherefrom the regiments and battalions draw their provisions.  So it is seen that the great aorta which leads from the interior to the big depots slowly subdivides itself into smaller arteries and feeders until they reach the ultimate destination, the extreme front.  This distribution of food had now become a formidable task, in consequence of the unforeseen movements and diversions which were forced upon us by the unexpected developments of the battle; and it often happened that food supplies intended for a certain detachment would reach their destination only after the departure of that detachment.  My platoon had by this time shrunk from fifty-five men to about thirty-four, but those remaining had become very hardened, efficient, and fit.  It is astonishing how quickly the human organism adjusts itself, if need be, to the most difficult circumstances.  So far as I was concerned, for instance, I adapted myself to the new life without any trouble at all, responding to the unusual demands upon me automatically, as it were.  My rather impaired eyesight improved in the open, with only wide distances to look at.  I found that my muscles served me better than ever before.  I leaped and ran and supported fatigue that would have appalled me under other circumstances.  In the field all neurotic symptoms seem to disappear as by magic, and one's whole system is charged with energy and vitality.  Perhaps this is due to the open-air life with its simplified standards, freed from all the complex exigencies of society's laws, and unhampered by conventionalities, as well as to the constant throb of excitement, caused by the activity, the adventure, and the uncertainty of fate.  The very massing together of so many individuals, with every will merged into one that strives with gigantic effort toward a common end, and the consequent simplicity and directness of all purpose, seem to release and unhinge all the primitive, aboriginal forces stored in the human soul, and tend to create the indescribable atmosphere of exultation which envelopes everything and everybody as with a magic cloak.  It is extraordinary how quickly suggestions of luxury, culture, refinement, in fact all the gentler aspects of life, which one had considered to be an integral part of one's life are quickly forgotten, and, more than that, not even missed.  Centuries drop from one, and one becomes a primeval man, nearing the cave-dweller in an incredibly short time.  For twenty-one days I went without taking off my clothes, sleeping on wet grass or in mud, or in the swamps, wherever need be, and with nothing but my cape to cover me. Nothing disturbs one.  One night, while sleeping, we were drenched to the skin by torrential rains.  We never stirred, but waited for the sun to dry us out again.  Many things considered necessities of civilization simply drop out of existence.  A toothbrush was not imaginable.  We ate instinctively, when we had food, with our hands. If we had stopped to think of it at all, we should have thought it ludicrous to use knife and fork.  We were all looking like shaggy, lean wolves, from the necessity of subsisting on next to nothing.  I remember having gone for more than three days at a time without any food whatsoever, and many a time we had to lick the dew from the grass for want of water.  A certain fierceness arises in you, an absolute indifference to anything the world holds except your duty of fighting.  You are eating a crust of bread, and a man is shot dead in the trench next to you.  You look calmly at him for a moment, and then go on eating your bread. Why not? There is nothing to be done.  In the end you talk of your own death with as little excitement as you would of a luncheon engagement.  There is nothing left in your mind but the fact that hordes of men to whom you belong are fighting against other hordes, and your side must win.  My memory of these days is very much blurred, every day being pretty nearly the same as the preceding one,--fatiguing marches, little rest and comparatively little fighting.  It is quite possible that our commander tried to divide the work of the troops in a just manner, and that in consequence of my regiment having borne the brunt of two terrible attacks, and having suffered considerable loss, we were now temporarily withdrawn from the fighting line, and not once during these days were assigned to the duty of a rear guard.  Consequently we had only few and unimportant skirmishes in these days, twice while guarding the flank through having to repulse attacks of Cossacks, and once being harassed by an armored automobile.  But the movements of an automobile being confined to the road, we had no difficulty in avoiding its fire, and as for the Cossacks with their eternal feigned attacks, we had reached the point where we almost ignored them.  We were in the first days of September, and upon reaching the swamps near Grodeck, south of Lemberg, a determined stand was decided upon by our commanding general.  It seemed the most propitious place for a formidable defense, there being only few roads through otherwise impassable swamps.  On September sixth my battalion was ordered to take up a position commanding a defile which formed one of the possible approaches for the enemy.  Here we awaited the Russians, and they were not long in coming.  First they violently shelled our position and silenced one of our batteries. Finding their artillery fire did not draw any answer from our side, they"]]]
