CHAPTER I  LANDING AT HAVRE--TORTONI'S--FOLLOW THE TRAM LINES--ORDERS FOR THE FRONT   [Illustration: G]  Gliding up the Seine, on a transport crammed to the lid with troops, in the still, cold hours of a November morning, was my debut into the war. It was about 6 a.m. when our boat silently slipped along past the great wooden sheds, posts and complications of Havre Harbour. I had spent most of the twelve-hour trip down somewhere in the depths of the ship, dealing out rations to the hundred men that I had brought with me from Plymouth. This sounds a comparatively simple process, but not a bit of it. To begin with, the ship was filled with troops to bursting point, and the mere matter of proceeding from one deck to another was about as difficult as trying to get round to see a friend at the other side of the ground at a Crystal Palace Cup final.  I stood in a queue of Gordons, Seaforths, Worcesters, etc., slowly moving up one, until, finally arriving at the companion (nearly said staircase), I tobogganed down into the hold, and spent what was left of the night dealing out those rations. Having finished at last, I came to the surface again, and now, as the transport glided along through the dirty waters of the river, and as I gazed at the motley collection of Frenchmen on the various wharves, and saw a variety of soldiery, and a host of other warlike \"props,\" I felt acutely that now I was _in_ the war at last--the real thing! For some time I had been rehearsing in England; but that was over now, and here I was--in the common or garden vernacular--\"in the soup.\"  At last we were alongside, and in due course I had collected that hundred men of mine, and found that the number was still a hundred, after which I landed with the rest, received instructions and a guide, then started off for the Base Camps.  [Illustration: \"Rations\"]  These Camps were about three miles out of Havre, and thither the whole contents of the ship marched in one long column, accompanied on either side by a crowd of ragged little boys shouting for souvenirs and biscuits. I and my hundred men were near the rear of the procession, and in about an hour's time arrived at the Base Camps.  I don't know that it is possible to construct anything more atrociously hideous or uninteresting than a Base Camp. It consists, in military parlance, of nothing more than:--    Fields, grassless   1   Tents, bell       500  In fact, a huge space, once a field, now a bog, on which are perched rows and rows of squalid tents.  I stumbled along over the mud with my troupe, and having found the Adjutant, after a considerable search, thought that my task was over, and that I could slink off into some odd tent or other and get a sleep and a rest. Oh no!--the Adjutant had only expected fifty men, and here was I with a hundred.  Consternation! Two hours' telephoning and intricate back-chat with the Adjutant eventually led to my being ordered to leave the expected fifty and take the others to another Base Camp hard by, and see if they would like to have them there.  The rival Base Camp expressed a willingness to have this other fifty, so at last I had finished, and having found an empty tent, lay down on the ground, with my greatcoat for a pillow and went to sleep.  I awoke at about three in the afternoon, got hold of a bucket of water and proceeded to have a wash. Having shaved, washed, brushed my hair, and had a look at the general effect in the polished back of my cigarette case (all my kit was still at the docks), I emerged from my canvas cave and started off to have a look round.  I soon discovered a small café down the road, and found it was a place used by several of the officers who, like myself, were temporarily dumped at the Camps. I went in and got something to eat. Quite a good little place upstairs there was, where one could get breakfast each morning: just coffee, eggs, and bread sort of thing. By great luck I met a pal of mine here; he had come over in a boat previous to mine, and after we had had a bit of a refresher and a smoke we decided to go off down to Havre and see the sights.  A tram passed along in front of this café, and this we boarded. It took about half an hour getting down to Havre from Bléville where the Camps were, but it was worth it.  Tortoni's Café, a place that we looked upon as the last link with civilization: Tortoni's, with its blaze of light, looking-glass and gold paint--its popping corks and hurrying waiters--made a deep and pleasant indent on one's mind, for \"to-morrow\" meant \"the Front\" for most of those who sat there.  As we sat in the midst of that kaleidoscopic picture, formed of French, Belgian and English uniforms, intermingled with the varied and gaudy robes of the local nymphs; as we mused in the midst of dense clouds of tobacco smoke, we could not help reflecting that this _might_ be the last time we should look on such scenes of revelry, and came to the conclusion that the only thing to do was to make the most of it while we had the chance. And, by Gad, we did....  A little after midnight I parted from my companion and started off to get back to that Base Camp of mine.  Standing in the main square of the town, I realized a few points which tended to take the edge off the success of the evening:  No. 1.--It was too late to get a tram.  No. 2.--All the taxis had disappeared.  No. 3.--It was pouring with rain.  No. 4.--I had three miles to go.  I started off to walk it--but had I known what that walk was going to be, I would have buttoned myself round a lamp-post and stayed where I was.  I made that fatal mistake of thinking that I knew the way.  Leaning at an angle of forty-five degrees against the driving rain, I staggered "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11232"],["title","Bullets & Billets (#1)"],["body","the tram lines past the Casino, and feeling convinced that the tram lines must be correct, determined to follow them.  After about half an hour's walk, mostly uphill, I became rather suspicious as to the road being quite right.  Seeing a sentry-box outside a palatial edifice on the right, I tacked across the road and looked for the sentry.  A lurid thing in gendarmes advanced upon me, and I let off one of my curtailed French sentences at him:  \"Pour Bléville, Monsieur?\"  I can't give his answer in French, but being interpreted I think it meant that I was completely on the wrong road, and that he wasn't certain as to how I could ever get back on it without returning to Havre and starting again.  He produced an envelope, made an unintelligible sketch on the back of it, and started me off again down the way I had come.  I realized what my mistake had been. There was evidently a branch tram line, which I had followed, and this I thought could only have branched off near the Casino, so back I went to the Casino and started again.  I was right about the branch line, and started merrily off again, taking as I thought the main line to Bléville.  After another half-hour of this, with eyes feverishly searching for recognizable landmarks, I again began to have doubts as to the veracity of the tram lines. However, pretending that I placed their honesty beyond all doubt, I plodded on; but round a corner, found the outlook so unfamiliar that I determined to ask again. Not a soul about. Presently I discovered a small house, standing back off the road and showing a thin slit of light above the shutters of a downstairs window. I tapped on the glass. A sound as of someone hurriedly trying to hide a pile of coverless umbrellas in a cupboard was followed by the opening of the window, and a bristling head was silhouetted against the light.  I squeezed out the same old sentence:  \"Pour Bléville, Monsieur?\"  A fearful cataract of unintelligible words burst from the head, but left me almost as much in the dark as ever, though with a faint glimmering that I was \"warmer.\" I felt that if I went back about a mile and turned to the left, all would be well.  I thanked the gollywog in the window, who, somehow or other, I think must have been a printer working late, and started off once more.  After another hour's route march I came to some scattered houses, and finally to a village. I was indignantly staring at a house when suddenly, joy!--I realized that what I was looking at was an unfamiliar view of the café where I had breakfasted earlier in the day.  Another ten minutes and I reached the Camp. Time now 2.30 a.m. I thought I would just take a look in at the Orderly Room tent to see if there were any orders in for me. It was lucky I did. Inside I found an orderly asleep in a blanket, and woke him.  \"Anything in for me?\" I asked. \"Bairnsfather's my name.\"  \"Yes, sir, there is,\" came through the blanket, and getting up he went to the table at the other end of the tent. He sleepily handed me the wire: \"Lieutenant Bairnsfather to proceed to join his battalion as machine-gun officer....\"  \"What time do I have to push off?\" I inquired.  \"By the eight o'clock from Havre to-morrow, sir.\"  Time now 3 a.m. To-morrow--THE FRONT! And then I crept into my tent and tried to sleep.     CHAPTER II  TORTUOUS TRAVELLING--CLIPPERS AND TABLETS--DUMPED AT A SIDING--I JOIN MY BATTALION   Not much sleep that night, a sort of feverish coma instead: wild dreams in which I and the gendarme were attacking a German trench, the officer in charge of which we found to be the Base Camp Adjutant after all.  However, I got up early--packed my few belongings in my valise, which had mysteriously turned up from the docks, and went off on the tram down to Havre. That hundred men I had brought over had nothing to do with me now. I was entirely on my own, and was off to the Front to join my battalion. Down at Havre the officials at the station gave me a complicated yellow diagram, known as a travelling pass, and I got into a carriage in the train bound for Rouen.  I was not alone now; a whole forest of second lieutenants like myself were in the same train, and with them a solid, congealed mass of valises, packs, revolvers and haversacks. At last the train started, and after the usual hour spent in feeling that you have left all the most important things behind, I settled down on a mound of equipment and tried to do a bit of a sleep.  So what with sleeping, smoking and talking, we jolted along until we pulled up at Rouen. Here I had to leave the train, for some obscure reason, in order to go to the Palais de Justice to get another ticket. I padded off down over the bridge into Rouen, found the Palais, went in and was shown along to an office that dealt in tickets.  In this dark and dingy oak-panelled saloon, illuminated by electric light and the glittering reflections from gold braid, there lurked a general or two. I was here given another pass entitling me to be deposited at a certain siding in Flanders.  Back I went to the station, and in due course rattled off in the train again towards the North.  A fearfully long journey we had, up to the Front! The worst of it was that nobody knew--or, if they did, wouldn't tell you--which way you were going, or how long it would take to get to your destination. For instance, we didn't know we were going to Rouen till we got there; and we didn't know we were going from Rouen to Boulogne until, after a night spent in the train, the whole outfit jolted and jangled into the Gare de Something, down by the wharf at that salubrious seaport.  We spent a complete day and part of an evening at Boulogne, as our train did not leave until midnight.  [Illustration: having a smoke]  I and another chap who was going to the next railhead to mine at the Front, went off together into the town and had lunch at a café in the High Street. We then strolled around the shops, buying a few things we needed. Not very attractive things either, but I'll mention them here to show how we thought and felt.  We first went to a \"pharmacie\" and got some boxes of morphia tablets, after which we went to an ironmonger's (don't know the French for it) and each bought a ponderous pair of barbed wire cutters. So what with wire clippers and morphia tablets, we _were_ gay. About four o'clock we calmed down a bit, and went to the same restaurant where we had lunched.  Here we had tea with a couple of French girls, exceeding good to look upon, who had apparently escaped from Lille. We got on splendidly with them till a couple of French officers, one with the Legion of Honour, came along to the next table. That took all the shine out of us, so we determined to quit, and cleared off to the Hotel de Folkestone, where we had a bath to console us. Dinner followed, and then, feeling particularly hilarious, I made my will. Not the approved will of family lawyer style, but just a letter announcing, in bald and harsh terms that, in the event of my remaining permanently in Belgium, I wanted my total small worldly wealth to be disposed of in a certain way.  Felt better after this outburst, and, rejoining my pal, we went off into the town again and by easy stages reached the train.  At about one a.m. the train started, and we creaked and groaned our way out of Boulogne. We were now really off for the Front, and the situation, consequently, became more exciting. We were slowly getting nearer and nearer to the real thing. But what a train! It dribbled and rumbled along at about five miles an hour, and, I verily believe, stopped at every farmhouse within sight of the line. I could not help thinking that the engine driver was a German in disguise, who was trying to prevent our ever arriving at our destination. I tried to sleep, but each time the train pulled up, I woke with a start and thought that we'd got there. This went on for many hours, and as I knew we must be getting somewhere near, my dreams became worse and worse.  I somehow began to think that the engine driver was becoming cautious--(he was a Frenchman again)--thought that, perhaps, he had to get down occasionally and walk ahead a bit to see if it was safe to go on.  Nobody in the train had the least idea where the Front was, how far off, or what it was like. For all we knew, our train might be going right up into the rear of the front line trenches. Somewhere round 6 a.m. I reached my siding. All the others, except myself and one other, had got out at previous halts. I got down from the carriage on to the cinder track, and went along the line to the station. Nobody about except a few Frenchmen, so I went back to the carriage again, and sat looking out through the dimmed window at the rain-soaked flat country. The other fellow with me was doing the same. A sudden, profound depression came over me. Here was I and this other cove dumped down at this horrible siding; nothing to eat, and nobody to meet us. How rude and callous of someone, or something. I looked at my watch; it had stopped, and on trying to wind it I found it was broken.  I stared out of the window again; gave that up, and stared at the opposite seat. Suddenly my eye caught something shiny under the seat. I stooped and picked it up; it was a watch! I have always looked upon this episode as an omen of some sort; but of what sort I can't quite make out. Finding a watch means finding \"Time\"--perhaps it meant I would find time to write this book; on the other hand it may have meant that my time had come--who knows?  At about eight o'clock by my new watch I again made an attack on the station, and at last found the R.T.O., which, being interpreted, means the Railway Transport Officer. He told me where my battalion was to be found; but didn't know whether they were in the trenches or out. He also added that if he were me he wouldn't hurry about going there, as I could probably get a lift in an A.S.C. wagon later on. I took his advice, and having left all my tackle by his"]]]
