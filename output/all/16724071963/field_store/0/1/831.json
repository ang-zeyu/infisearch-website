Breathless the kneeling shepherds heard,   Charmed from their first rude fear, Nor while that music dwelt had stirred   Were it a month or year: And Mary Mother drank its flow, Couched with her Babe divine,--and, lo!   Ere falls the last ecstatic word     Three Holy Kings draw near.  Whenas the star-led shining train   Wheeled from their task complete, Skyward from over Bethlehem's plain   They sped with rapture fleet; And the angel of that orient star, Thenceforth where Heaven's lordliest are,   Stands with a harp, while Christ doth reign,     A seraph near His feet.    THE VISIT OF THE WISE MEN  ST. MATTHEW, II, 1-12   Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,  Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.  When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.  And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.  And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,  And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art not the least among the princes of Judah: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.  Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.  And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.  When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.  When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.  And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.  And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.     THE THREE KINGS  HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW   Three Kings came riding from far away, Melchior and Gaspar and Baltasar; Three Wise Men out of the East were they, And they travelled by night and they slept by day, For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.  The star was so beautiful, large, and clear,   That all the other stars of the sky Became a white mist in the atmosphere, And by this they knew that the coming was near   Of the Prince foretold in the prophecy.  Three caskets they bore on their saddle-bows,   Three caskets of gold with golden keys; Their robes were of crimson silk with rows Of bells and pomegranates and furbelows,   Their turbans like blossoming almond-trees.  And so the Three Kings rode into the West,   Through the dusk of night, over hill and dell, And sometimes they nodded with beard on breast, And sometimes talked, as they paused to rest,   With the people they met at some wayside well.  \"Of the child that is born,\" said Baltasar,   \"Good people, I pray you, tell us the news; For we in the East have seen his star, And have ridden fast, and have ridden far,   To find and worship the King of the Jews.\"  And the people answered, \"You ask in vain;   We know of no king but Herod the Great!\" They thought the Wise Men were men insane, As they spurred their horses across the plain,   Like riders in haste, and who cannot wait.  And when they came to Jerusalem,   Herod the Great, who had heard this thing, Sent for the Wise Men and questioned them; And said, \"Go down unto Bethlehem,   And bring me tidings of this new king.\"  So they rode away; and the star stood still,   The only one in the gray of morn; Yes, it stopped,--it stood still of its own free will, Right over Bethlehem on the hill,   The city of David, where Christ was born.  And the Three Kings rode through the gate and the guard,   Through the silent street, till their horses turned And neighed as they entered the great inn-yard; But the windows were closed, and the doors were barred,   And only a light in the stable burned.  And cradled there in the scented hay,   In the air made sweet by the breath of kine, The little child in the manger lay, The child, that would be king one day   Of a kingdom not human but divine.  His mother Mary of Nazareth   Sat watching beside his place of rest, Watching the even flow of his breath, For the joy of life and the terror of death   Were mingled together in her breast.  They laid their offerings at his feet:   The gold was their tribute to a King, The frankincense, with its odor sweet, Was for the Priest, the Paraclete,   The myrrh for the body's burying.  And the mother wondered and bowed her head,   And sat as still as a statue of stone; Her heart was troubled yet comforted, Remembering what the Angel had said   Of an endless reign and of David's throne.  Then the Kings rode out of the city gate,   With a clatter of hoofs in proud array; But they went not back to Herod the Great, For they knew his malice and feared his hate,   And returned to their homes by another way.    THE THREE HOLY KINGS  ADAPTED FROM THE GOLDEN LEGEND, AND OTHER SOURCES   In a far country, in the days before Jesus was born in Judea, there were great astrologers who studied the heavens by night and by day, for they knew of the prophecy which said that a star shall be born or spring out of Jacob, and a man shall arise of the lineage of Israel. And twelve of them were chosen to take heed, who every year ascended upon a mountain which was called the Hill of Victory. Three days they abode there, and prayed our Lord that He would show to them the star that Balaam had said and prophesied.  Now it happened on a time, that they were there on the day of the Nativity of Jesus Christ, and a star came over them upon this mountain, which had the form of a right fair child, and under his head was a shining cross, and from this cross came a voice saying: \"To-day is there born a King in Judea.\"  Now in Arabia, the land in which the soil is red with gold, there reigned a king called Melchior. And in Saba, where frankincense flows from the trees, the king Balthasar ruled. And in the land where myrrh hangs from the bushes, the kingdom of Tharsis, reigned a third king, called Caspar. These three kings also saw the star and heard the voice, and they each made ready to go on a journey. And no one of the three knew that the others intended thus to make a pilgrimage. And they gathered together their treasures to present to the king whom they should seek, and summoned those who should attend them. So each set out with a great company and great estate. And as they journeyed they found the mountains made level as the plains, while the swollen rivers became as dry land. And never did they lose sight of the star, which shined upon them as the sun, always moving before them to guide them on their way.  But when they were come within two miles of Jerusalem, the star disappeared, a heavy fog arose, and each party halted; Melchior, as it fell out, taking his stand on Mount Calvary, Balthasar on the Mount of Olives, and Caspar just between them. And when the fog cleared away, each was astonished to see two other great companies besides his own, and then the kings first discovered that all had come upon the same errand, and they embraced with great joy, and rode together into Jerusalem.  And when they came into the city, Herod and all the people were troubled, because of their so great company like unto an army. Then they demanded in what place the King of the Jews was born, for, said they, \"We have seen His star in the Orient, and therefore we come to worship Him.\" And when Herod had heard this, he was much troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. Then Herod called all the priests of the law, and the doctors, and demanded  of them where Jesus Christ should be born. And when he had understood them that He should be born in Bethlehem, he called the three kings apart and demanded of them diligently the time that the star appeared to them. And he said to them that as soon as they should have found the Child and have worshipped Him, that they should return and show it to him, feigning that he would worship Him also, though he thought that he would go to slay Him.  And as soon as the kings were entered into Jerusalem, the sight of the star was taken from them. But when they were issued out of the city, the star appeared again and went before them, until it came above the place in Bethlehem where the Child was. And they had journeyed now full thirteen days.  And when they had entered into the place they worshipped the young Child, and Mary, His mother. Now the kings had brought great treasures with them, for it must be known that all that Alexander the Great left at his death, and all that the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon, and all that Solomon collected for the temple, had descended to the three kings from their ancestors; and all this they had now brought with them. But when they had bowed down before the Child, they were filled with fear and amazement because of the so great light which was in the place. And they each offered quickly the first thing that came to their hands, and forgot all their other gifts. Melchior offered thirty golden pennies, Balthasar gave frankincense, and Caspar myrrh; but all else they quite forgot, and only remembered that they bowed before the Child, and said \"Thanks be to God.\"  And when they would have stayed to do honor to the Holy Child, an angel came to them in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11014"],["title","Christmas in Legend and Story: A Book for Boys and Girls (#5)"],["body","dream, to warn them against Herod, who would do them harm. So they departed each to his own country, journeying for two years. And they preached unto the people, telling them of the new-born King, and everywhere upon the temples men placed the figures of a star, the Child, and a cross.  Now it happened years later that St. Thomas the Apostle journeyed to the far country to preach, and that he wondered why the star was placed upon the temples. Then the priests in those temples told him about the three kings and how they had journeyed to Bethlehem and had seen the young Child.  And the three kings were very old and feeble, but when they heard about St. Thomas, each set out from his own place to go to meet him. And when they had come together they builded them a city, and lived together there for two years, worshipping God and preaching. Then Melchior died, and was buried in a large and costly tomb. And when Balthasar died, he, too, was buried there. And at last Caspar was placed beside his companions.  Now in the days of Constantine the Great, his mother Helena determined to find the bodies of the three kings, and for this she made a journey to the far country. And when she had found them, she brought them to Constantinople to the Church of St. Sophia, where they were held in much honor. And from Constantinople they were taken to Milan, where again many pilgrims came. Now when Frederick Barbarossa laid siege to the city of Milan, he rejoiced above all else to find them there. And by him they were taken to Cologne, and there a golden shrine was built in which the bones of the three holy kings were placed that there they might remain until the Judgment day.    THE THREE KINGS OF COLOGNE  EUGENE FIELD   From out Cologne there came three kings   To worship Jesus Christ, their King. To Him they sought fine herbs they brought,   And many a beauteous golden thing;   They brought their gifts to Bethlehem town,   And in that manger set them down.  Then spake the first king, and he said:   \"O Child, most heavenly, bright, and fair! I bring this crown to Bethlehem town.   For Thee, and only Thee, to wear;   So give a heavenly crown to me   When I shall come at last to Thee!\"  The second, then. \"I bring Thee here   This royal robe, O Child!\" he cried; \"Of silk 'tis spun, and such an one   There is not in the world beside; So in the day of doom requite Me with a heavenly robe of white!\"  The third king gave his gift, and quoth:   \"Spikenard and myrrh to Thee I bring, And with these twain would I most fain   Anoint the body of my King;   So may their incense sometime rise   To plead for me in yonder skies!\"  Thus spake the three kings of Cologne,   That gave their gifts and went their way; And now kneel I in prayer hard by   The cradle of the Child to-day;   Nor crown, nor robe, nor spice I bring   As offering unto Christ, my King.  Yet have I brought a gift the Child   May not despise, however small; For here I lay my heart to-day,   And it is full of love to all.   Take Thou the poor but loyal thing,   My only tribute, Christ, my King!    BABOUSCKA  ADELAIDE SKEEL   If you were a Russian child you would not watch to see Santa Klaus come down the chimney; but you would stand by the windows to catch a peep at poor Babouscka as she hurries by.  Who is Babouscka? Is she Santa Klaus' wife?  No, indeed. She is only a poor little crooked wrinkled old woman, who comes at Christmas time into everybody's house, who peeps into every cradle, turns back every coverlid, drops a tear on the baby's white pillow, and goes away very sorrowful.  And not only at Christmas time, but through all the cold winter, and especially in March, when the wind blows loud, and whistles and howls and dies away like a sigh, the Russian children hear the rustling step of the Babouscka. She is always in a hurry. One hears her running fast along the crowded streets and over the quiet country fields. She seems to be out of breath and tired, yet she hurries on.  Whom is she trying to overtake?  She scarcely looks at the little children as they press their rosy faces against the window pane and whisper to each other, \"Is the Babouscka looking for us?\"  No, she will not stop; only on Christmas eve will she come up-stairs into the nursery and give each little one a present. You must not think she leaves handsome gifts such as Santa Klaus brings for you. She does not bring bicycles to the boys or French dolls to the girls. She does not come in a gay little sleigh drawn by reindeer, but hobbling along on foot, and she leans on a crutch. She has her old apron filled with candy and cheap toys, and the children all love her dearly. They watch to see her come, and when one hears a rustling, he cries, \"Lo! the Babouscka!\" then all others look, but one must turn one's head very quickly or she vanishes. I never saw her myself.  Best of all, she loves little babies, and often, when the tired mothers sleep, she bends over their cradles, puts her brown, wrinkled face close down to the pillow and looks very sharply.  What is she looking for?  Ah, that you can't guess unless you know her sad story.  Long, long ago, a great many yesterdays ago, the Babouscka, who was even then an old woman, was busy sweeping her little hut. She lived in the coldest corner of cold Russia, and she lived alone in a lonely place where four wide roads met. These roads were at this time white with snow, for it was winter time. In the summer, when the fields were full of flowers and the air full of sunshine and singing birds, Babouscka's home did not seem so very quiet; but in the winter, with only the snow-flakes and the shy snow-birds and the loud wind for company, the little old woman felt very cheerless. But she was a busy old woman, and as it was already twilight, and her home but half swept, she felt in a great hurry to finish her work before bed-time. You must know the Babouscka was poor and could not afford to do her work by candle-light. Presently, down the widest and the lonesomest  of the white roads, there appeared a long train of people coming. They were walking slowly, and seemed to be asking each other questions as to which way they should take. As the procession came nearer, and finally stopped outside the little hut, Babouscka was frightened at the splendor. There were Three Kings, with crowns on their heads, and the jewels on the Kings' breastplates sparkled like sunlight. Their heavy fur cloaks were white with the falling snow-flakes, and the queer humpy camels on which they rode looked white as milk in the snow-storm. The harness on the camels was decorated with gold, and plates of silver adorned the saddles. The saddlecloths were of the richest Eastern stuffs, and all the servants had the dark eyes and hair of an Eastern people.  The slaves carried heavy loads on their backs, and each of the Three Kings carried a present. One carried a beautiful transparent jar, and in the fading light Babouscka could see in it a golden liquid which she knew from its color must be myrrh. Another had in his hand a richly woven bag, and it seemed to be heavy, as indeed it was, for it was full of gold. The third had a stone vase in his hand, and from the rich perfume which filled the snowy air, one could guess the vase to have been filled with incense.  Babouscka was terribly frightened, so she hid herself in her hut, and let the servants knock a long time at her door before she dared open it and answer their questions as to the road they should take to a far-away town. You know she had never studied a geography lesson in her life, was old and stupid and scared. She knew the way across the fields to the nearest village, but she knew nothing else of all the wide world full of cities. The servants scolded, but the Three Kings spoke kindly to her, and asked her to accompany them on their journey that she might show them the way as far as she knew it. They told her, in words so simple that she could not fail to understand, that they had seen a Star in the sky and were following it to a little town where a young Child lay. The snow was in the sky now, and the Star was lost out of sight.  \"Who is the Child?\" asked the old woman.  \"He is a King, and we go to worship him,\" they answered. \"These presents of gold, frankincense and myrrh are for Him. When we find Him we will take the crowns off our heads and lay them at His feet. Come with us, Babouscka!\"  What do you suppose? Shouldn't you have thought the poor little woman would have been glad to leave her desolate home on the plains to accompany these Kings on their journey?  But the foolish woman shook her head. No, the night was dark and cheerless, and her little home was warm and cosy. She looked up into the sky, and the Star was nowhere to be seen. Besides, she wanted to put her hut in order--perhaps she would be ready to go to-morrow. But the Three Kings could not wait; so when to-morrow's sun rose they were far ahead on their journey. It seemed like a dream to poor Babouscka, for even the tracks of the camels' feet were covered by the deep white snow. Everything was the same as usual; and to make sure that the night's visitors had not been a fancy, she found her old broom hanging on a peg behind the door, where she had put it when the servants knocked.  Now that the sun was shining, and she remembered the glitter of the gold and the smell of the sweet gums and myrrh, she wished she had gone with the travellers.  And she thought a great deal about the little Baby the Three Kings had gone to worship. She had no children of her own--nobody loved her--ah, if she had only gone! The more she brooded on the thought, the more miserable she grew, till the very sight of her home became hateful to her.  It is a dreadful feeling to realize that one has lost a chance of happiness. There is a feeling called remorse that can gnaw like a sharp little tooth. Babouscka felt this little tooth cut into her heart every time she remembered the visit of the Three Kings."]]]
