They were heartily tempted to despise Dan, but as one with the courage to attempt the impossible, they would help him as far as they could. He took their guns one after the other, weighed them, tried the action, and handed them back. It was almost as if there were a separate intelligence in the ends of his fingers which informed him of the qualities of each weapon.  \"Nice gun,\" he said to the first man whose revolver he handled, \"but I don't like a barrel that's quite so heavy. There's a whole ounce too much in the barrel.\"  \"What d'you mean?\" asked the cowpuncher. \"I've packed that gun for pretty nigh eight years!\"  \"Sorry,\" said Dan passing on, \"but I can't work right with a top-heavy gun.\"  The next weapon he handed back almost at once.  \"What's the matter with that?\" asked the owner aggressively.  \"Cylinder too tight,\" said Dan decisively, and a moment later to another man, \"Bad handle. I don't like the feel of it.\"  Over Jim Silent's guns he paused longer than over most of the rest, but finally he handed them back. The big man scowled.  Dan looked back to him in gentle surprise.  \"You see,\" he explained quietly, \"you got to handle a gun like a horse. If you don't treat it right it won't treat you right. That's all I know about it. Your gun ain't very clean, stranger, an' a gun that ain't kept clean gets off feet.\"  Silent glanced at his weapons, cursed softly, and restored them to the holsters.  \"Lee,\" he muttered to Haines, who stood next to him, \"what do you think he meant by that? D' you figger he's got somethin' up his sleeve, an' that's why he acts so like a damned woman?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Haines gravely, \"he looks to me sort of queer--sort of different--damned different, chief!\"  By this time Dan had secured a second gun which suited him. He whirled both guns, tried their actions alternately, and then announced that he was ready. In the dead silence, one of the men paced off the twenty yards.  Dan, with his back turned, stood at the mark, shifting his revolvers easily in his hands, and smiling down at them as if they could understand his caress.  \"How you feelin', Dan?\" asked Morgan anxiously.  \"Everything fine,\" he answered.  \"Are you gettin' weak?\"  \"No, I'm all right.\"  \"Steady up, partner.\"  \"Steady up? Look at my hand!\"  Dan extended his arm. There was not a quiver in it.  \"All right, Dan. When you're shootin', remember that I got pretty close to everything I own staked on you. There's the stranger gettin' his four dollars ready.\"  Silent took his place with the four dollars in his hand.  \"Are you ready?\" he called.  \"Let her go!\" said Dan, apparently without the least excitement.  Jim Silent threw the coins, and he threw them so as to increase his chances as much as possible. A little snap of his hand gave them a rapid rotary motion so that each one was merely a speck of winking light. He flung them high, for it was probable that Whistling Dan would wait to shoot until they were on the way down. The higher he threw them the more rapidly they would be travelling when they crossed the level of the markman's eye.  As a shout proclaimed the throwing of the coins, Dan whirled, and it seemed to the bystanders that a revolver exploded before he was fully turned; but one of the coins never rose to the height of the throw. There was a light \"cling!\" and it spun a dozen yards away. Two more shots blended almost together; two more dollars darted away in twinkling streaks of light. One coin still fell, but when it was a few inches from the earth a six-shooter barked again and the fourth dollar glanced sidewise into the dust. It takes long to describe the feat. Actually, the four shots consumed less than a second of time.  \"That last dollar,\" said Dan, and his soft voice was the first sound out of the silence, \"wasn't good. It didn't ring true. Counterfeit?\"  It seemed that no one heard his words. The men were making a wild scramble for the dollars. They dived into the dust for them, rising white of face and clothes to fight and struggle over their prizes. Those dollars with the chips and neat round holes in them would confirm the truth of a story that the most credulous might be tempted to laugh or scorn. A cowpuncher offered ten dollars for one of the relics--but none would part with a prize.  The moment the shooting was over Dan stepped quietly back and restored the guns to the owners. The first man seized his weapon carelessly. He was in the midst of his rush after one of the chipped coins. The other cowpuncher received his weapon almost with reverence.  \"I'm thankin' you for the loan,\" said Dan, \"an here's hopin' you always have luck with the gun.\"  \"Luck?\" said the other. \"I sure _will_ have luck with it. I'm goin' to oil her up and put her in a glass case back home, an' when I get grandchildren I'm goin' to point out that gun to 'em and tell 'em what men used to do in the old days. Let's go in an' surround some red-eye at my expense.\"  \"No thanks,\" answered Dan, \"I ain't drinkin'.\"  He stepped back to the edge of the circle and folded his arms. It was as if he had walked out of the picture. He suddenly seemed to be aloof from them all.  Out of the quiet burst a torrent of curses, exclamations, and shouts. Chance drew Jim Silent and his three followers together.  \"My God!\" whispered Lee Haines, with a sort of horror in his voice, \"it wasn't human! Did you see? Did you see?\"  \"Am I blind?\" asked Hal Purvis, \"an' think of me walkin' up an' bracin' that killer like he was a two-year-old kid! I figger that's the nearest I ever come to a undeserved grave, an' I've had some close calls! 'That last dollar wasn't good! It didn't ring true,' says he when he finished. I never seen such nerve!\"  \"You're wrong as hell,\" said Silent, \"a _woman_ can shoot at a target, but it takes a cold _nerve_ to shoot at a man--an' this feller is yellow all through!\"  \"Is he?\" growled Bill Kilduff, \"well, I'd hate to take him by surprise, so's he'd forget himself. He gets as much action out of a common six-gun as if it was a gatling. He was right about that last dollar, too. It was pure--lead!\"  \"All right, Haines,\" said Silent. \"You c'n start now any time, an' the rest of us'll follow on the way I said. I'm leavin' last. I got a little job to finish up with the kid.\"  But Haines was staring fixedly down the road.  \"I'm not leaving yet,\" said Haines. \"Look!\"  He turned to one of the cowpunchers.  \"Who's the girl riding up the road, pardner?\"  \"That calico? She's Kate Cumberland--old Joe's gal.\"  \"I like the name,\" said Haines. \"She sits the saddle like a man!\"  Her pony darted off from some imaginary object in the middle of the road, and she swayed gracefully, following the sudden motion. Her mount came to the sudden halt of the cattle pony and she slipped to the ground before Morgan could run out to help. Even Lee Haines, who was far quicker, could not reach her in time.  \"Sorry I'm late,\" said Haines. \"Shall I tie your horse?\"  The fast ride had blown colour to her face and good spirits into her eyes. She smiled up to him, and as she shook her head in refusal her eyes lingered a pardonable moment on his handsome face, with the stray lock of tawny hair fallen low across his forehead. She was used to frank admiration, but this unembarrassed courtesy was a new world to her. She was still smiling when she turned to Morgan.  \"You told my father the boys wouldn't wear guns today.\"  He was somewhat confused.  \"They seem to be wearin' them,\" he said weakly, and his eyes wandered about the armed circle, pausing on the ominous forms of Hal Purvis, Bill Kilduff, and especially Jim Silent, a head taller than the rest. He stood somewhat in the background, but the slight sneer with which he watched Whistling Dan dominated the entire picture.  \"As a matter of fact,\" went on Morgan, \"it would be a ten man job to take the guns away from this crew. You can see for yourself.\"  She glanced about the throng and started. She had seen Dan.  \"How did he come here?\"  \"Oh, Dan?\" said Morgan, \"he's all right. He just pulled one of the prettiest shootin' stunts I ever seen.\"  \"But he promised my father--\" began Kate, and then stopped, flushing.  If her father was right in diagnosing Dan's character, this was the most critical day in his life, for there he stood surrounded by armed men. If there were anything wild in his nature it would be brought out that day. She was almost glad the time of trial had come.  She said: \"How about the guns, Mr. Morgan?\"  \"If you want them collected and put away for a while,\" offered Lee Haines, \"I'll do what I can to help you!\"  Her smile of thanks set his blood tingling. His glance lingered a little too long, a little too gladly, and she coloured slightly.  \"Miss Cumberland,\" said Haines, \"may I introduce myself? My name is Lee.\"  She hesitated. The manners she had learned in the Eastern school forbade it, but her Western instinct was truer and stronger. Her hand went out to him.  \"I'm very glad to know you, Mr. Lee.\"  \"All right, stranger,\" said Morgan, who in the meantime had been shifting from one foot to the other and estimating the large chances of failure in this attempt to collect the guns, \"if you're going to help me corral the shootin' irons, let's start the roundup.\"  The girl went with them. They had no trouble in getting the weapons. The cold blue eye of Lee Haines was a quick and effective persuasion.  When they reached Jim Silent he stared fixedly upon Haines. Then he drew his guns slowly and presented them to his comrade, while his eyes shifted to Kate and he said coldly: \"Lady, I hope I ain't the last one to congratulate you!\"  She did not understand, but Haines scowled and coloured. Dan, in the meantime, was swept into the saloon by an influx of the cowpunchers that left only Lee Haines outside with Kate. She had detained him with a gesture.     CHAPTER VI   LAUGHTER  \"Mr. Lee,\" she said, \"I am going to ask you "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10886"],["title","The Untamed (#7)"],["body","do me a favour. Will you?\"  His smile was a sufficient answer, and it was in her character that she made no pretext of misunderstanding it.  \"You have noticed Dan among the crowd?\" she asked, \"Whistling Dan?\"  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I saw him do some very nice shooting.\"  \"It's about him that I want to speak to you. Mr. Lee, he knows very little about men and their ways. He is almost a child among them. You seem--stronger--than most of the crowd here. Will you see that if trouble comes he is not imposed upon?\"  She flushed a little, there was such a curious yearning in the eyes of the big man.  \"If you wish it,\" he said simply, \"I will do what I can.\"  As he walked beside her towards her horse, she turned to him abruptly.  \"You are very different from the men I have met around here,\" she said.  \"I am glad,\" he answered.  \"Glad?\"  \"If you find me different, you will remember me, whether for better or worse.\"  He spoke so earnestly that she grew grave. He helped her to the saddle and she leaned a little to study him with the same gentle gravity.  \"I should like to see you again, Mr. Lee,\" she said, and then in a little outburst, \"I should like to see you a _lot!_ Will you come to my house sometime?\"  The directness, the sudden smile, made him flinch. His voice was a trifle unsteady when he replied.  \"I _shall!_\" He paused and his hand met hers. \"If it is possible.\"  Her eyebrows raised a trifle.  \"Is it so hard to do?\"  \"Do not ask me to explain,\" he said, \"I am riding a long way.\"  \"Oh, a 'long-rider'!\" she laughed, \"then of course--\" She stopped abruptly. It may have been imagination, but he seemed to start when she spoke the phrase by which outlaws were known to each other. He was forcing his eyes to meet hers.  He said slowly: \"I am going on a long journey. Perhaps I will come back. If I am able to, I shall.\"  He dropped his hand from hers and she remained silent, guessing at many things, and deeply moved, for every woman knows when a man speaks from his soul.  \"You will not forget me?\"  \"I shall never forget you,\" she answered quietly. \"Good-bye, Mr. Lee!\"  Her hand touched his again, she wheeled, and rode away. He remained standing with the hand she had grasped still raised. And after a moment, as he had hoped, she turned in the saddle and waved to him. His eyes were downward and he was smiling faintly when he re-entered the saloon.  Silent sat at a table with his chin propped in his hand--his left hand, of course, for that restless right hand must always be free. He stared across the room towards Whistling Dan. The train of thoughts which kept those ominous eyes so unmoving must be broken. He sat down at the side of his chief.  \"What the hell?\" said the big man, \"ain't you started yet?\"  \"Look here, Jim,\" said Haines cautiously, \"I want you to lay off on this kid, Whistling Dan. It won't meant anything to you to raise the devil with him.\"  \"I tell you,\" answered Silent, \"it'll please me more'n anything in the world to push that damned girl face of his into the floor.\"  \"Silent, I'm asking a personal favour of you!\"  The leader turned upon him that untamed stare. Haines set his teeth.  \"Haines,\" came the answer, \"I'll stand more from you than from any man alive. I know you've got guts an' I know you're straight with me. But there ain't anything can keep me from manhandlin' that kid over there.\" He opened and shut his fingers slowly. \"I sort of yearn to get at him!\"  Haines recognized defeat.  \"But you haven't another gun hidden on you, Jim? You won't try to shoot him up?\"  \"No,\" said Silent. \"If I had a gun I don't know--but I haven't a gun. My hands'll be enough!\"  All that could be done now was to get Whistling Dan out of the saloon. That would be simple. A single word would suffice to send the timid man helter-skelter homewards.  The large, lazy brown eyes turned up to Haines as the latter approached.  \"Dan,\" he said, \"hit for the timbers--get on your way--there's danger here for you!\"  To his astonishment the brown eyes did not vary a shade.  \"Danger?\" he repeated wonderingly.  \"Danger! Get up and get out if you want to save your hide!\"  \"What's the trouble?\" said Dan, and his eyes were surprised, but not afraid.  \"The biggest man in this room is after your blood.\"  \"Is he?\" said Dan wonderingly. \"I'm sorry I don't feel like leavin', but I'm not tired of this place yet.\"  \"Friend,\" said Haines, \"if that tall man puts his hands on you, he'll break you across his knee like a rotten stick of wood!\"  It was too late. Silent evidently guessed that Haines was urging his quarry to flee.  \"Hey!\" he roared, so that all heads turned towards him, \"you over there.\"  Haines stepped back, sick at heart. He knew that it would be folly to meet his chief hand to hand, but he thought of his pledge to Kate, and groaned.  \"What do you want of me?\" asked Dan, for the pointed arm left no doubt as to whom Silent intended.  \"Get up when you're spoke to\" cried Silent. \"Ain't you learned no manners? An' git up quick!\"  Dan rose, smiling his surprise.  \"Your friend has a sort of queer way of talkin',\" he said to Haines.  \"Don't stan' there like a fool. Trot over to the bar an' git me a jolt of red-eye. I'm dry!\" thundered Silent.  \"Sure!\" nodded Whistling Dan amiably, \"glad to!\" and he went accordingly towards the bar.  The men about the room looked to each other with sick smiles. There was an excuse for acquiescence, for the figure of Jim Silent contrasted with Whistling Dan was like an oak compared with a sapling. Nevertheless such bland cowardice as Dan was showing made their flesh creep. He asked at the bar for the whisky, and Morgan spoke as Dan filled a glass nearly to the brim.  \"Dan,\" he whispered rapidly, \"I got a gun behind the bar. Say the word an' I'll take the chance of pullin' it on that big skunk. Then you make a dive for the door. Maybe I can keep him back till you get on Satan.\"  \"Why should I beat it?\" queried Dan, astonished. \"I'm jest beginnin' to get interested in your place. That tall feller is sure a queer one, ain't he?\"  With the same calm and wide-eyed smile of inquiry he turned away, taking the glass of liquor, and left Morgan to stare after him with a face pale with amazement, while he whispered over and over to himself: \"Well, I'll be damned! Well, I'll be damned!\"  Dan placed the liquor before Silent. The latter sat gnawing his lips.  \"What in hell do you mean?\" he said. \"Did you only bring one glass? Are you too damn good to drink with me? Then drink by yourself, you white-livered coyote!\"  He dashed the glass of whisky into Dan's face. Half blinded by the stinging liquor, the latter fell back a pace, sputtering, and wiping his eyes. Not a man in the room stirred. The same sick look was on each face. But the red devil broke loose in Silent's heart when he saw Dan cringe. He followed the thrown glass with his clenched fist. Dan stood perfectly still and watched the blow coming. His eyes were wide and wondering, like those of a child. The iron-hard hand struck him full on the mouth, fairly lifted him from his feet, and flung him against the wall with such violence that he recoiled again and fell forward onto his knees. Silent was making beast noises in his throat and preparing to rush on the half-prostrate figure. He stopped short.  Dan was laughing. At least that chuckling murmur was near to a laugh. Yet there was no mirth in it. It had that touch of the maniacal in it which freezes the blood. Silent halted in the midst of his rush, with his hands poised for the next blow. His mouth fell agape with an odd expression of horror as Dan stared up at him. That hideous chuckling continued. The sound defied definition. And from the shadow in which Dan was crouched his brown eyes blazed, changed, and filled with yellow fires.  \"God!\" whispered Silent, and at that instant the ominous crouched animal with the yellow eyes, the nameless thing which had been Whistling Dan a moment before, sprang up and forward with a leap like that of a panther.  Morgan stood behind the bar with a livid face and a fixed smile. His fingers still stiffly clutched the whisky bottle from which the last glass had been filled. Not another man in the room stirred from his place. Some sat with their cards raised in the very act of playing. Some had stopped midway a laugh. One man had been tying a bootlace. His body did not rise. Only his eyes rolled up to watch.  Dan darted under the outstretched arms of Silent, fairly heaved him up from the floor and drove him backwards. The big man half stumbled and half fell, knocking aside two chairs. He rushed back with a shout, but at sight of the white face with the thin trickle of blood falling from the lips, and at the sound of that inhuman laughter, he paused again.  Once more Dan was upon him, his hands darting out with motions too fast for the eye to follow. Jim Silent stepped back a half pace, shifted his weight, and drove his fist straight at that white face. How it happened not a man in the room could tell, but the hand did not strike home. Dan had swerved aside as lightly as a wind-blown feather and his fist rapped against Silent's ribs with a force that made the giant grunt.  Some of the horror was gone from his face and in its stead was baffled rage. He knew the scientific points of boxing, and he applied them. His eye was quick and sure. His reach was whole inches longer than his opponent's. His strength was that of two ordinary men. What did it avail him? He was like an agile athlete in the circus playing tag with a black panther. He was like a child striking futilely at a wavering butterfly. Sometimes this white-faced, laughing devil ducked under his arms. Sometimes a sidestep made his blows miss by the slightest fraction of an inch.  And for every blow he struck four rained home against him. It was impossible! It could not be! Silent telling himself that he dreamed, and those dancing fists crashed into his face and body like sledgehammers. There was no science in the thing which"]]]
