What a very pleasant baby you must have been!\"  \"Jack!\" said his mother, reprovingly; but his father, who looked upon it as a good joke, remarked, good-humoredly: \"He's got you there, Rachel.\"  But Rachel took it as a serious matter, and observed that, when she was young, children were not allowed to speak so to their elders.  \"But I don't know as I can blame 'em much,\" she continued, wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron, \"when their own parents encourage 'em in it.\"  Timothy was warned, by experience of Rachel's temper, that silence was his most prudent course. Anything that he might say would only be likely to make matters worse than before.  Aunt Rachel sank into a fit of deep despondency, and did not say another word till dinner time. She sat down to the table with a profound sigh, as if there was little in life worth living for. Notwithstanding this, it was observed that she had a good appetite. Indeed, Miss Harding appeared to thrive on her gloomy views of life and human nature. She was, it must be acknowledged, perfectly consistent in all her conduct, so far as this peculiarity was concerned. Whenever she took up a newspaper, she always looked first to the space appropriated to deaths, and next in order to the column of accidents, casualties, etc., and her spirits were visibly exhilarated when she encountered a familiar name in either list.  The cooper continued to look out for work; but it was with a more cheerful spirit. He did not now feel as if the comfort of his family depended absolutely on his immediate success. Used economically, the money he had by him would last eight months; and during that time it was hardly possible that he should not find something to do. It was this sense of security, of having something to fall back upon, that enabled him to keep up good heart. It is too generally the case that people are content to live as if they were sure of constantly retaining their health, and never losing their employment. When a reverse does come, they are at once plunged into discouragement, and feel the necessity of doing something immediately. There is only one way of fending off such an embarrassment; and that is, to resolve, whatever may be the amount of one's income, to lay aside some part to serve as a reliance in time of trouble. A little economy--though it involves self-denial--will be well repaid by the feeling of security it engenders.  Mr. Harding was not compelled to remain inactive as long as he feared. Not that his line of business revived--that still remained depressed for a considerable time--but another path was opened to him.  Returning home late one evening, the cooper saw a man steal out from a doorway, and attack a gentleman, whose dress and general appearance indicated probable wealth.  Seizing him by the throat, the villain effectually prevented his calling for help, and at once commenced rifling his pockets, when the cooper arrived on the scene. A sudden blow admonished the robber that he had more than one to deal with.  \"What are you doing? Let that gentleman be!\"  The villain hesitated but a moment, then springing to his feet, he hastily made off, under cover of the darkness.  \"I hope you have received no injury, sir,\" said Mr. Harding, respectfully, addressing the stranger he had rescued.  \"No, my worthy friend; thanks to your timely assistance. The rascal nearly succeeded, however.\"  \"I hope you have lost nothing, sir.\"  \"Nothing, fortunately. You can form an idea of the value of your interference, when I say that I have fifteen hundred dollars with me, all of which would doubtless have been taken.\"  \"I am glad,\" said Timothy, \"that I was able to do you such a service. It was by the merest chance that I came this way.\"  \"Will you add to my indebtedness by accompanying me with that trusty club of yours? I have some distance yet to go, and the money I have with me I don't want to lose.\"  \"Willingly,\" said the cooper.  \"But I am forgetting,\" continued the gentleman, \"that you will yourself be obliged to return alone.\"  \"I do not carry enough money to make me fear an attack,\" said Mr. Harding, laughing. \"Money brings care, I have always heard, and the want of it sometimes freedom from anxiety.\"  \"Yet most people are willing to take their share of that.\"  \"You are right, sir, nor I can't call myself an exception. Still I would be satisfied with the certainty of constant employment.\"  \"I hope you have that, at least.\"  \"I have had until three or four months since.\"  \"Then, at present, you are unemployed?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"What is your business?\"  \"I am a cooper.\"  \"I will see what I can do for you. Will you call at my office to-morrow, say at twelve o'clock?\"  \"I shall be glad to do so, sir.\"  \"I believe I have a card with me. Yes, here is one. And this is my house. Thank you for your company. Let me see you to-morrow.\"  They stood before a handsome dwelling house, from whose windows, draped by heavy crimson curtains, a soft light proceeded. The cooper could hear the ringing of childish voices welcoming home their father, whose life, unknown to them, had been in such peril, and he felt grateful to Providence for making him the instrument of frustrating the designs of the villain who would have robbed the merchant, and perhaps done him further injury. Timothy determined to say nothing to his wife about the night's adventure, until after his appointed meeting for the next day. Then, if any advantage accrued to him from it, he would tell the whole story.  When he reached home, Mrs. Harding was sewing beside the fire. Aunt Rachel sat with her hands folded in her lap, with an air of martyr-like resignation to the woes of life.  \"I've brought you home a paper, Rachel,\" said her brother, cheerfully. \"You may find something interesting in it.\"  \"I shan't be able to read it this evening,\" said Rachel, mournfully. \"My eyes have troubled me lately. I feel that it is more than probable I am getting blind; but I trust I shall not live to be a burden to you, Timothy. Your prospects are dark enough without that.\"  \"Don't trouble yourself with any fears of that sort, Rachel,\" said the cooper, cheerily. \"I think I know what will enable you to use your eyes as well as ever.\"  \"What?\" asked Rachel, with melancholy curiosity.  \"A pair of spectacles.\"  \"Spectacles!\" retorted Rachel, indignantly. \"It will be a good many years before I am old enough to wear spectacles. I didn't expect to be insulted by my own brother. But I ought not to be surprised. It's one of my trials.\"  \"I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Rachel,\" said the cooper, perplexed.  \"Good-night!\" said Rachel, rising and taking a lamp from the table.  \"Come, Rachel, don't go up to bed yet; it's only nine o'clock.\"  \"After what you have said to me, Timothy, my self-respect will not allow me to stay.\"  Rachel swept out of the room with something more than her customary melancholy.  \"I wish Rachel wasn't quite so contrary,\" said the cooper to his wife. \"She turns upon a body so sudden it's hard to know how to take her. How's the little girl, Martha?\"  \"She's been asleep ever since six o'clock.\"  \"I hope you don't find her very much trouble? That all comes on you, while we have the benefit of the money.\"  \"I don't think of that, Timothy. She is a sweet child, and I love her almost as much as if she were my own. As for Jack, he perfectly idolizes her.\"  \"And how does Rachel look upon her?\"  \"I am afraid she will never be a favorite with Rachel.\"  \"Rachel never took to children much. It isn't her way. Now, Martha, while you are sewing, I will read you the news.\"     CHAPTER IX  WHAT THE ENVELOPE CONTAINED   The card which had been handed to the cooper contained the name of Thomas Merriam, No. ---- Pearl Street.  Punctually at twelve, he presented himself at the countingroom, and received a cordial welcome from the merchant.  \"I am glad to see you,\" he said, affably. \"You rendered me an important service last evening, even if the loss of money alone was to be apprehended. I will come to business at once, as I am particularly engaged this morning, and ask you if there is any way in which I can serve you?\"  \"If you could procure me a situation, sir, you would do me a great service.\"  \"I think you told me you were a cooper?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Does this yield you a good support?\"  \"In good times it pays me two dollars a day, and on that I can support my family comfortably. Lately it has been depressed, and paid me but a dollar and a half.\"  \"When do you anticipate its revival?\"  \"That is uncertain. I may have to wait some months.\"  \"And, in the meantime, you are willing to undertake some other employment?\"  \"I am not only willing, but shall feel very fortunate to obtain work of any kind. I have no objection to any honest employment.\"  Mr. Merriam reflected a moment.  \"Just at present,\" he said, \"I have nothing better to offer you than the position of porter. If that will suit you, you can enter upon its duties to-morrow.\"  \"I shall be very glad to undertake it, sir. Anything is better than idleness.\"  \"As to the compensation, that shall be the same that you have been accustomed to earn by your trade--two dollars a day.\"  \"I only received that in the best times,\" said Timothy, conscientiously.  \"Your services as porter will be worth that amount, and I will cheerfully pay it. I will expect you to-morrow morning at eight, if you can be here at that time.\"  \"I will be here promptly.\"  \"You are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10729"],["title","Jack's Ward; Or, The Boy Guardian (#7)"],["body",", I suppose?\" said the merchant, inquiringly.  \"Yes, sir; I am blessed with a good wife.\"  \"I am glad of that. Stay a moment.\"  Mr. Merriam went to his desk, and presently came back with a sealed envelope.  \"Give that to your wife,\" he said.  \"Thank you, sir.\"  Here the interview terminated, and the cooper went home quite elated by his success. His present engagement would enable him to bridge over the dull time, until his trade revived, and save him from incurring debts, of which he had a just horror.  \"You are just in time, Timothy,\" said Mrs. Harding, cheerfully, as he entered. \"We've got an apple pudding to-day.\"  \"I see you haven't forgotten what I like, Martha.\"  \"There's no knowing how long you'll be able to afford puddings,\" said Rachel, dolefully. \"To my mind it's extravagant to have meat and pudding both, when a month hence you may be in the poorhouse.\"  \"Then,\" said Jack, \"I wouldn't eat any if I were you, Aunt Rachel.\"  \"Oh, if you grudge me the little I eat,\" said his aunt, in serene sorrow, \"I will go without.\"  \"Tut, Rachel! nobody grudges you anything here,\" said her brother; \"and as to the poorhouse, I've got some good news to tell you that will put that thought out of your head.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Mrs. Harding, looking up brightly.  \"I have found employment.\"  \"Not at your trade?\"  \"No; but at something else which will pay equally well till trade revives.\"  Here he told the chance by which he was enabled to serve Mr. Merriam the evening previous, and then he gave an account of his visit to the merchant's countingroom, and the engagement which he had made.  \"You are indeed fortunate, Timothy,\" said his wife, her face beaming with pleasure. \"Two dollars a day, and we've got nearly the whole of the money left that came with this dear child. Why, we shall be getting rich soon!\"  \"Well, Rachel, have you no congratulations to offer?\" asked the cooper of his sister, who, in subdued sorrow, was eating as if it gave her no pleasure, but was rather a self-imposed penance.  \"I don't see anything so very fortunate in being engaged as a porter,\" said Rachel, lugubriously. \"I heard of a porter once who had a great box fall upon him and kill him instantly; and I was reading in the _Sun_ yesterday of another out West somewhere who committed suicide.\"  The cooper laughed.  \"So, Rachel, you conclude that one or the other of these calamities is the inevitable lot of all who are engaged in this business?\"  \"You may laugh now, but it is always well to be prepared for the worst,\" said Rachel, oracularly.  \"But it isn't well to be always looking for it, Rachel.\"  \"It'll come whether you look for it or not,\" retorted his sister, sententiously.  \"Then suppose we waste no time thinking about it, since, according to your admission, it's sure to come either way.\"  Rachel did not deign a reply, but continued to eat in serene melancholy.  \"Won't you have another piece of pudding, Timothy?\" asked his wife.  \"I don't care if I do, Martha, it's so good,\" said the cooper, passing his plate. \"Seems to me it's the best pudding you ever made.\"  \"You've got a good appetite, that is all,\" said Mrs. Harding, modestly disclaiming the compliment.  \"Apple puddings are unhealthy,\" observed Rachel.  \"Then what makes you eat them?\" asked Jack.  \"A body must eat something. Besides, life is so full of sorrow, it makes little difference if it's longer or shorter.\"  \"Won't you have another piece, Rachel?\"  Aunt Rachel passed her plate, and received a second portion. Jack winked slyly, but fortunately his aunt did not observe it.  When dinner was over, the cooper thought of the sealed envelope which had been given him for his wife.  \"Martha,\" he said, \"I nearly forgot that I have something for you.\"  \"For me?\"  \"Yes, from Mr. Merriam.\"  \"But he don't know me,\" said Mrs. Harding, in surprise.  \"At any rate, he first asked me if I was married, and then handed me this envelope, which he asked me to give to you. I am not quite sure whether I ought to allow strange gentlemen to write letters to my wife.\"  Mrs. Harding opened the envelope with considerable curiosity, and uttered an exclamation of surprise as a bank note fell out, and fluttered to the carpet.  \"By gracious, mother!\" said Jack, springing to get it, \"you're in luck. It's a hundred-dollar bill.\"  \"So it is, I declare,\" said his mother, joyfully. \"But, Timothy, it isn't mine. It belongs to you.\"  \"No, Martha, I have nothing to do with it. It belongs to you. You need some clothes, I am sure. Use part of it, and I will put the rest in the savings bank for you.\"  \"I never expected to have money to invest,\" said Mrs. Harding. \"I begin to feel like a capitalist. When you want to borrow money, Timothy, you'll know where to come.\"  \"Merriam's a trump and no mistake,\" said Jack. \"By the way, when you see him again, father, just mention that you've got a son. Ain't we in luck, Aunt Rachel?\"  \"Boast not overmuch,\" said his aunt. \"Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.\"  \"I never knew Aunt Rachel to be jolly but once,\" said Jack under his breath; \"and that was at a funeral.\"     CHAPTER X  JACK'S MISCHIEF   One of the first results of the new prosperity which had dawned upon the Hardings, was Jack's removal from the street to the school. While his father was out of employment, his earnings seemed necessary; but now they could be dispensed with.  To Jack, the change was not altogether agreeable. Few boys of the immature age of eleven are devoted to study, and Jack was not one of these few. The freedom which he had enjoyed suited him, and he tried to impress it upon his father that there was no immediate need of his returning to school.  \"Do you want to grow up a dunce, Jack?\" said his father.  \"I can read and write already,\" said Jack.  \"Are you willing to enter upon life with that scanty supply of knowledge?\"  \"Oh, I guess I can get along as well as the average.\"  \"I don't know about that. Besides, I want you to do better than the average. I am ambitious for you, if you are not ambitious for yourself.\"  \"I don't see what good it does a feller to study so hard,\" muttered Jack.  \"You won't study hard enough to do you any harm,\" said Aunt Rachel, who might be excused for a little sarcasm at the expense of her mischievous nephew.  \"It makes my head ache to study,\" said Jack.  \"Perhaps your head is weak, Jack,\" suggested his father, slyly.  \"More than likely,\" said Rachel, approvingly.  So it was decided that Jack should go to school.  \"I'll get even with Aunt Rachel,\" thought he. \"She's always talking against me, and hectorin' me. See if I don't.\"  An opportunity for getting even with his aunt did not immediately occur. At length a plan suggested itself to our hero. He shrewdly suspected that his aunt's single blessedness, and her occasional denunciations of the married state, proceeded from disappointment.  \"I'll bet she'd get married if she had a chance,\" he thought. \"I mean to try her, anyway.\"  Accordingly, with considerable effort, aided by a school-fellow, he concocted the following letter, which was duly copied and forwarded to his aunt's address:    \"DEAR GIRL: Excuse the liberty I have taken in writing to you;   but I have seen you often, though you don't know me; and you are   the only girl I want to marry. I am not young--I am about your age,   thirty-five--and I have a good trade. I have always wanted to be   married, but you are the only one I know of to suit me. If you think   you can love me, will you meet me in Washington Park, next Tuesday,   at four o'clock? Wear a blue ribbon round your neck, if you want to   encourage me. I will have a red rose pinned to my coat.    \"Don't say anything to your brother's family about this. They may not   like me, and they may try to keep us apart. Now be sure and come.   DANIEL.\"   This letter reached Miss Rachel just before Jack went to school one morning. She read it through, first in surprise, then with an appearance of pleasure.  \"Who's your letter from, Aunt Rachel?\" asked Jack, innocently.  \"Children shouldn't ask questions about what don't concern 'em,\" said his aunt.  \"I thought maybe it was a love letter,\" said he.  \"Don't make fun of your aunt,\" said his father, reprovingly.  \"Jack's question is only a natural one,\" said Rachel, to her brother's unbounded astonishment. \"I suppose I ain't so old but I might be married if I wanted to.\"  \"I thought you had put all such thoughts out of your head long ago, Rachel.\"  \"If I have, it's because the race of men are so shiftless,\" said his sister. \"They ain't worth marrying.\"  \"Is that meant for me?\" asked the cooper, good-naturedly.  \"You're all alike,\" said Rachel, tossing her head.  She put the letter carefully into her pocket, without deigning any explanation.  \"I suppose it's from some of her old acquaintances,\" thought her brother, and he dismissed the subject.  As soon as she could, Rachel took refuge in her room. She carefully locked the door, and read the letter again.  \"Who can he be?\" thought the agitated spinster. \"Do I know anybody of the name of Daniel? It must be some stranger that has fallen in love with me unbeknown. What shall I do?\"  She sat in meditation for a short time. Then she read the letter again.  \"He will be very unhappy if I frown upon him,\" she said to herself, complacently. \"It's a great responsibility to make a fellow being unhappy. It's a sacrifice, I know, but it's our duty to deny ourselves. I don't know but I ought to go and meet him.\"  This was Rachel's conclusion.  The time was close at hand. The appointment was for that very afternoon.  \"I wouldn't have my brother or Martha know it for the world,\" murmured Rachel to herself, \"nor that troublesome Jack. Martha's got some blue ribbon, but I don't dare to ask her for it, for fear she'll suspect something. No, I must go out and buy some.\"  \"I'm goin' to walk, Martha,\" she said, as she came downstairs.  \"Going to walk in the forenoon! Isn't that something unusual?\"  \"I've got a little "]]]
