CHAPTER 12  Magbolotó.  There was once a man named Magbolotó who lived in the depths of the mountains. One day on going down to a brook he saw three goddesses bathing in the water. They had left their wings on the bank, and Magbolotó managed to slip down and steal one pair of them. When the goddesses had finished bathing and looked for their wings, they could not find those belonging to the youngest, Macaya. At last the two goddesses put on their wings and flew up to heaven, leaving behind them Macaya, who wept bitterly, since without her wings she could not go home. Then Magbolotó, feigning to have come from a distance, met her and asked: \"Why do you weep, lady?\"  \"Why do you ask, if you will not help me in my trouble?\" answered Macaya.  \"I will do my best to help you,\" said Magbolotó, \"if you will tell me about it.\"  So Macaya told him that she had lost her wings, and therefore could not return to her home in heaven.  \"I am sorry not to be able to help you out of your trouble,\" said Magbolotó, \"but we terrestrial people do not use wings, nor know where to get them. The only thing I can do for you is to offer you a home with me.\" Macaya was obliged to accept his offer, since there was nothing else for her to do.  About a year after Macaya became Magbolotó's wife they had a child. One day, as Magbolotó was making rice soup on the hearth, Macaya was swinging the child in a hammock. Accidentally, she noticed a bundle stuck into one of the bamboo posts in the partition. She withdrew the bundle, and upon unrolling it found, oh, joy! her long-lost wings, which Magbolotó had hidden in the hollow bamboo. She at once put them on, and leaving her husband and child, flew up to join her celestial family.  Magbolotó, on missing his wife, began calling loudly for her. As he could not find her, he looked for the wings, and seeing that they were gone, knew at once what had happened. He began to weep bitterly, especially as he did not know how to take care of the child. So leaving it in the care of a relative, he set out to find the way to heaven. He had walked a great distance when he met North Wind. \"Magbolotó, Magbolotó, why are you weeping?\" asked North Wind.  \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me in any way,\" answered Magbolotó.  \"Tell me your trouble and I will help you,\" said North Wind. \"Well,\" replied Magbolotó, \"I have a wife who came from heaven. But now she has flown away, leaving a little child for me to take care of, and I am in great sorrow. Please show me the way that leads to her home.\"  \"Magbolotó,\" said North Wind, \"I do not know the way, but my brother, East Wind, can tell you. Good-by.\"  Magbolotó went on his way, and after a while he met East Wind. \"Magbolotó, Magbolotó, why are you weeping?\" asked East Wind.  \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me in any way,\" said Magbolotó.  \"Tell me all your trouble and I will help you,\" answered East Wind.  Then Magbolotó related all his sorrow, just as he had done to North Wind.  \"Well,\" said East Wind, \"I do not know the way, but my brother, South Wind, may be able to show it to you. Good-by.\"  Magbolotó went on, and at last met South Wind.  \"Magbolotó, Magbolotó, why are you weeping?\" asked South Wind.  \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me in any way,\" said Magbolotó.  \"Tell me your trouble and I will help you,\" answered South Wind.  Then Magbolotó told him his story, just as he had done to North Wind and East Wind.  \"Well,\" said South Wind, \"I do not know the way to heaven, but my brother, West Wind, can tell you the course to be taken to get there. Good-by.\"  Magbolotó went on and on, and at last met West Wind. \"Magbolotó, Magbolotó, why are you weeping?\" asked West Wind.  \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me in any way,\" answered Magbolotó.  \"Tell me your trouble and I will help you,\" answered West Wind, and Magbolotó did as he was bidden.  \"Magbolotó,\" said West Wind, \"I don't know the way to heaven, but my friend, Mr. Eagle, does. Good-by.\"  Magbolotó went on until he met Mr. Eagle.  \"Magbolotó, Magbolotó, why are you weeping?\" asked Mr. Eagle.  \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me in any way,\" answered Magbolotó.  \"Tell me your trouble and I will help you,\" replied Mr. Eagle. Then Magbolotó told Mr. Eagle his trouble.  \"Magbolotó,\" said Mr. Eagle, \"get upon my back and I will carry you to your wife's home.\"  Magbolotó climbed upon Mr. Eagle's back and they flew up until they reached Macaya's house. Then Magbolotó requested Macaya's grandmother, with whom she lived, to let her granddaughter return to earth with him.  \"By no means,\" said the grandmother, \"unless you will spread ten jars of luñga (a certain very small grain) out to dry and gather them again in the evening.\"  So Magbolotó spread the jars of luñga on the sand, and at noon began to gather them up; but sunset had come before he had gathered more than five handfuls, so he sat down and began to cry like a little boy.  The king of the ants heard him, and wishing to help him, asked:--\"Magbolotó, Magbolotó, why are you weeping?\"  \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me.\"  \"Tell me about it and I will help you.\"  So Magbolotó told the king of the ants all his history, and the condition imposed by the grandmother before he could have his wife, and how impossible it was to fulfil it.  \"Well, Magbolotó, you shall be helped,\" said the king of the ants. Then he blew his horn, and in a little while all his subjects came, and began picking up the grain and putting it into the jars. In a few moments all the grain was in the jars.  The next morning Magbolotó went to get his wife, but the grandmother stopped him, saying:--  \"You shall not take my granddaughter away until you have first hulled a hundred bushels of rice.\"  Magbolotó was in despair, for he knew that to hull one hundred bushels of rice would take him not less than one hundred days, and the grandmother required him to do it in one day; so he cried like a child at his misfortune. The king of the rats heard him crying, and at once came to help him.  \"Magbolotó, Magbolotó, why are you weeping?\" asked King Rat.  \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me.\"  \"Relate the matter, and I will.\"  Magbolotó told him his trouble. Then the king of the rats called his subjects together and ordered them to gnaw the hulls from the rice. In an instant the rice was all hulled.  The next morning Magbolotó made ready to depart with his wife, but the grandmother stopped him again, saying:--  \"You may not go until you have chopped down all the trees you see on that mountain over there.\"  There were more than a million trees, so Magbolotó was in great trouble, and as usual he began to weep.  The king of the wild boars heard him and came up, saying:--  \"Magbolotó, Magbolotó, why are you weeping?\"  \"Ask me nothing, if you cannot help me.\"  \"Relate the matter, and I will.\"  Magbolotó related all that had happened to him. Then the king of the wild boars called all his subjects together and set them at work cutting down the trees with their tusks. In a few minutes the trees were all down.  When the grandmother saw that Magbolotó accomplished every task she gave him to do she became tired of trying to think of things for him to do; so she allowed him to depart with Macaya, and leaving the celestial abode they descended to their home on the earth, where they lived happily together for many years.   CHAPTER 13  Why Dogs Wag Their Tails.  Once upon a time there lived in a certain pueblo a rich man who had a dog and a cat. His only daughter, of whom he was very fond, was studying in a convent in a city several miles distant and it was his custom, about once a week, to send the dog and cat to take her a little present. The dog was so old that he had lost all his teeth, and so was unable to fight, but the cat was strong and very cunning, and so one could help the other, since the dog knew better how to find the way.  One day the rich man wished to send a magic ring to his daughter, so he called the dog and the cat to him. To the cat he said: \"You are very cunning and prudent. You may carry this magic ring to my daughter, but be sure to take very great care of it.\" To the dog he said: \"You are to go with the cat to take a magic ring to my daughter. Take care not to lose the way, and see that no one molests the cat.\" Both animals promised to do their best and set out immediately.  On the way they were obliged to cross a wide and deep river, over which there was no bridge, and as they were unable to find a boat, they determined to swim across it. The dog said to the cat: \"Give me the magic ring.\" \"Oh, no,\" replied the cat. \"Did you not hear the master say just what each of us had to do?\"  \"Yes, but you are not very good at swimming, and may lose the ring, while I am strong and can take good care of it,\" answered the dog. The cat continued to refuse to disobey its master, until at last the dog threatened to kill it, and it was obliged to intrust the ring to the dog's keeping.  Then they began to swim across the river, which was so strong that they were about an hour in getting over, so that both became very tired and weak. Just before they came to the other side, the dog dropped the ring into the water, and it was impossible to find it. \"Now,\" said the cat, \"we had better go back home and tell our master that we have lost the ring.\" \"Yes,\" answered the dog, \"but I am very much afraid.\" So they turned back toward home, but as they drew near the house his fear so overcame him that he ran away and was never seen again.  The master was very much surprised to see the cat back so soon, and asked him, \"Where is your companion?\" The cat was at first afraid to answer. \"Where is the dog?\" asked the master again. \"Oh, he ran away,\" replied the cat. \"Ran away?\" said the master. \"What do you mean?

A STUDY IN THE NATIVE RELIGIONS OF THE WESTERN CONTINENT.  BY  DANIEL G. BRINTON, M.D.,  MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY; THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY; THE NUMISMATIC AND ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY OF PHILA., ETC.; AUTHOR OF \"THE MYTHS OF THE NEW WORLD;\" \"THE RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT.\" ETC.   1882.   TO  ELI K. PRICE, ESQ.,  PRESIDENT OF THE NUMISMATIC AND ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY OF PHILADELPHIA, WHOSE ENLIGHTENED INTEREST HAS FOR MANY YEARS, AND IN MANY WAYS, FURTHERED THE PROGRESS OF KNOWLEDGE, THIS VOLUME IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.     PREFACE.   This little volume is a contribution to the comparative study of religions. It is an endeavor to present in a critically correct light some of the fundamental conceptions which are found in the native beliefs of the tribes of America.  So little has heretofore been done in this field that it has yielded a very scanty harvest for purposes of general study. It has not yet even passed the stage where the distinction between myth and tradition has been recognized. Nearly all historians continue to write about some of the American hero-gods as if they had been chiefs of tribes at some undetermined epoch, and the effort to trace the migrations and affiliations of nations by similarities in such stories is of almost daily occurrence. How baseless and misleading all such arguments must be, it is one of my objects to set forth.  At the same time I have endeavored to be temperate in applying the interpretations of mythologists. I am aware of the risk one runs in looking at every legend as a light or storm myth. My guiding principle has been that when the same, and that a very extraordinary, story is told by several tribes wholly apart in language and location, then the probabilities are enormous that it is not a legend but a myth, and must be explained as such. It is a spontaneous production of the mind, not a reminiscence of an historic event.  The importance of the study of myths has been abundantly shown of recent years, and the methods of analyzing them have been established with satisfactory clearness.  The time has long since passed, at least among thinking men, when the religious legends of the lower races were looked upon as trivial fables, or as the inventions of the Father of Lies. They are neither the one nor the other. They express, in image and incident, the opinions of these races on the mightiest topics of human thought, on the origin and destiny of man, his motives for duty and his grounds of hope, and the source, history and fate of all external nature. Certainly the sincere expressions on these subjects of even humble members of the human race deserve our most respectful heed, and it may be that we shall discover in their crude or coarse narrations gleams of a mental light which their proud Aryan brothers have been long in coming to, or have not yet reached.  The prejudice against all the lower faiths inspired by the claim of Christianity to a monopoly of religious truth--a claim nowise set up by its founder--has led to extreme injustice toward the so-called heathen religions. Little effort has been made to distinguish between their good and evil tendencies, or even to understand them. I do not know of a single instance on this continent of a thorough and intelligent study of a native religion made by a Protestant missionary.  So little real work has been done in American mythology that very diverse opinions as to its interpretation prevail among writers. Too many of them apply to it facile generalizations, such as \"heliolatry,\" \"animism,\" \"ancestral worship,\" \"primitive philosophizing,\" and think that such a sesame will unloose all its mysteries. The result has been that while each satisfies himself, he convinces no one else.  I have tried to avoid any such bias, and have sought to discover the source of the myths I have selected, by close attention to two points: first, that I should obtain the precise original form of the myth by a rigid scrutiny of authorities; and, secondly, that I should bring to bear upon it modern methods of mythological and linguistic analysis.  The first of these requirements has given me no small trouble. The sources of American history not only differ vastly in merit, but many of them are almost inaccessible. I still have by me a list of books of the first order of importance for these studies, which I have not been able to find in any public or private library in the United States.  I have been free in giving references for the statements in the text. The growing custom among historians of omitting to do this must be deplored in the interests of sound learning. It is better to risk the charge of pedantry than to leave at fault those who wish to test an author's accuracy or follow up the line of investigation he indicates.  On the other hand, I have exercised moderation in drawing comparisons with Aryan, Semitic, Egyptian and other Old World mythologies. It would have been easy to have noted apparent similarities to a much greater extent. But I have preferred to leave this for those who write upon general comparative mythology. Such parallelisms, to reach satisfactory results, should be attempted only by those who have studied the Oriental religions in their original sources, and thus are not to be deceived by superficial resemblances.  The term \"comparative mythology\" reaches hardly far enough to cover all that I have aimed at. The professional mythologist thinks he has completed his task when he has traced a myth through its transformations in story and language back to the natural phenomena of which it was the expression. This external history is essential. But deeper than that lies the study of the influence of the myth on the individual and national mind, on the progress and destiny of those who believed it, in other words, its true _religious_ import. I have endeavored, also, to take some account of this.  The usual statement is that tribes in the intellectual condition of those I am dealing with rest their religion on a worship of external phenomena. In contradiction to this, I advance various arguments to show that their chief god was not identified with any objective natural process, but was human in nature, benignant in character, loved rather than feared, and that his worship carried with it the germs of the development of benevolent emotions and sound ethical principles.  _Media, Pa., Oct., 1882._     CONTENTS.
