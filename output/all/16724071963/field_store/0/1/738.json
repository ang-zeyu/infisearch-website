We do not need to be told of the vice and corruption prevalent, I am sorry to say, among the very best people; what we really need is continually to be reminded of the fact that pure hearts and homes and happy faces are to be found to-day alike in the palatial residences of the wealthy and in the humbler homes of those less abundantly favoured by Fortune, and yet dwelling together in harmony and Christian resignation and--er--comparatively moderate circumstances.\"  \"Surely,\" Mrs. Saumarez protested, \"art has nothing to do with morality. Art is a process. You see a thing in a certain way; you make your reader see it in the same way--or try to. If you succeed, the result is art. If you fail, it may be the book of the year.\"  \"Enduring immortality and--ah--the patronage of the reading public,\" Mr. Jukesbury placidly insisted, \"will be awarded, in the end, only to those who dwell upon the true, the beautiful, and the--er --respectable. Art must cheer; it must be optimistic and edifying and--ah--suitable for young persons; it must have an uplift, a leaven of righteousness, a--er--a sort of moral baking-powder. It must utterly eschew the--ah--unpleasant and repugnant details of life. It is, if I may so express myself, not at home in the ménage à trois or--er--the representation of the nude. Yes, another glass of claret, if you please.\"  \"I quite agree with you,\" said Mrs. Haggage, in her deep voice. Sarah Ellen Haggage is, of course, the well-known author of \"Child-Labour in the South,\" and \"The Down-Trodden Afro-American,\" and other notable contributions to literature. She is, also, the \"Madame President\" both of the Society for the Betterment of Civic Government and Sewerage, and of the Ladies' League for the Edification of the Impecunious.  \"And I am glad to see,\" Mrs. Haggage presently went on, \"that the literature of the day is so largely beginning to chronicle the sayings and doings of the labouring classes. The virtues of the humble must be admitted in spite of their dissolute and unhygienic tendencies. Yes,\" Mrs. Haggage added, meditatively, \"our literature is undoubtedly acquiring a more elevated tone; at last we are shaking off the scintillant and unwholesome influence of the French.\"  \"Ah, the French!\" sighed Mr. Kennaston; \"a people who think depravity the soul of wit! Their art is mere artfulness. They care nothing for Nature.\"  \"No,\" Mrs. Haggage assented; \"they prefer nastiness. _All_ French books are immoral. I ran across one the other day that was simply hideously indecent--unfit for a modest woman to read. And I can assure you that none of its author's other books are any better. I purchased the entire set at once and read them carefully, in order to make sure that I was perfectly justified in warning my working-girls' classes against them. I wish to misjudge no man--not even a member of a nation notoriously devoted to absinthe and illicit relations.\"  She breathed heavily, and looked at Mr. Woods as if, somehow, he was responsible. Then she gave the name of the book to Petheridge Jukesbury. He wished to have it placed on the _Index Expurgatorius_ of the Brotherhood of Benevolence, he said.  \"Dear, dear,\" Felix Kennaston sighed, as Mr. Jukesbury made a note of it; \"you are all so practical. You perceive an evil and proceed at once, in your common-sense way, to crush it, to stamp it out. Now, I can merely lament certain unfortunate tendencies of the age; I am quite unable to contend against them. Do you know,\" Mr. Kenneston continued gaily, as he trifled with a bunch of grapes, \"I feel horribly out-of-place among you? Here is Mrs. Saumarez creating an epidemic of useful and improving knowledge throughout the country, by means of her charming lectures. Here is Mrs. Haggage, the mainspring, if I may say so, of any number of educational and philanthropic alarm clocks which will some day rouse the sleeping public from its lethargy. And here is my friend Jukesbury, whose eloquent pleas for a higher life have turned so many workmen from gin and improvidence, and which in a printed form are disseminated even in such remote regions as Africa, where I am told they have produced the most satisfactory results upon the unsophisticated but polygamous monarchs of that continent. And here, above all, is Miss Hugonin, utilising the vast power of money--which I am credibly informed is a very good thing to have, though I cannot pretend to speak from experience--and casting whole bakeryfuls of bread upon the waters of charity. And here am I, the idle singer of an empty day--a mere drone in this hive of philanthropic bees! Dear, dear,\" said Mr. Kennaston, enviously, \"what a thing it is to be practical!\" And he laughed toward Margaret, in his whimsical way.  Miss Hugonin had been strangely silent; but she returned Mr. Kennaston's smile, and began to take part in the conversation.  \"You're only an ignorant child,\" she rebuked him, \"and a very naughty child, too, to make fun of us in this fashion.\"  \"Yes,\" Mr. Kennaston assented, \"I am wilfully ignorant. The world adores ignorance; and where ignorance is kissed it is folly to be wise. To-morrow I shall read you a chapter from my 'Defense of Ignorance,' which my confiding publisher is going to bring out in the autumn.\"  So the table-talk went on, and now Margaret bore a part therein.         *       *       *       *       *  However, I do not think we need record it further.  Mr. Woods listened in a sort of a daze. Adèle Haggage and Hugh Van Orden were conversing in low tones at one end of the table; the Colonel was eating his luncheon, silently and with a certain air of resignation; and so Billy Woods was left alone to attend and marvel.  The ideas they advanced seemed to him, for the most part, sensible. What puzzled him was the uniform gravity which they accorded equally--as it appeared to him--to the discussion of the most pompous platitudes and of the most arrant nonsense. They were always serious; and the general tone of infallibility, Billy thought, could be warranted only by a vast fund of inexperience.  But, in the main, they advocated theories he had always held--excellent theories, he considered. And he was seized with an unreasonable desire to repudiate every one of them.  For it seemed to him that every one of them was aimed at Margaret's approval. It did not matter to whom a remark was ostensibly addressed--always at its conclusion the speaker glanced more or less openly toward Miss Hugonin. She was the audience to which they zealously played, thought Billy; and he wondered.  I think I have said that, owing to the smallness of the house-party, luncheon was served in the breakfast-room. The dining-room at Selwoode is very rarely used, because Margaret declares its size makes a meal there equivalent to eating out-of-doors.  And I must confess that the breakfast-room is far cosier. The room, in the first place, is of reasonable dimensions; it is hung with Flemish tapestries from designs by Van Eyck representing the Four Seasons, but the walls and ceiling are panelled in oak, and over the mantel carved in bas-relief the inevitable Eagle is displayed.  The mantel stood behind Margaret's chair; and over her golden head, half-protectingly, half-threateningly, with his wings outstretched to the uttermost, the Eagle brooded as he had once brooded over Frederick R. Woods. The old man sat contentedly beneath that symbol of what he had achieved in life. He had started (as the phrase runs) from nothing; he had made himself a power. To him, the Eagle meant that crude, incalculable power of wealth he gloried in. And to Billy Woods, the Eagle meant identically the same thing, and--I am sorry to say--he began to suspect that the Eagle was really the audience to whom Miss Hugonin's friends so zealously played.  Perhaps the misanthropy of Mr. Woods was not wholly unconnected with the fact that Margaret never looked at him. _She'd_ show him!--the fortune-hunter!  So her eyes never strayed toward him; and her attention never left him. At the end of luncheon she could have enumerated for you every morsel he had eaten, every glare he had directed toward Kennaston, every beseeching look he had turned to her. Of course, he had taken sherry--dry sherry. Hadn't he told her four years ago--it was the first day she had ever worn the white organdie dotted with purple sprigs, and they sat by the lake so late that afternoon that Frederick R. Woods finally sent for them to come to dinner--hadn't he told her then that only women and children cared for sweet wines? Of course he had--the villain!  [Illustration: \"Billy Woods\"]  Billy, too, had his emotions. To hear that paragon, that queen among women, descant of work done in the slums and of the mysteries of sweat-shops; to hear her state off-hand that there were seventeen hundred and fifty thousand children between the ages of ten and fifteen years employed in the mines and factories of the United States; to hear her discourse of foreign missions as glibly as though she had been born and nurtured in Zambesi Land: all these things filled him with an odd sense of alienation. He wasn't worthy of her, and that was a fact. He was only a dumb idiot, and half the words that were falling thick and fast from philanthropic lips about him might as well have been hailstones, for all the benefit he was deriving from them. He couldn't understand half she said.  In consequence, he very cordially detested the people who could--especially that grimacing ass, Kennaston.  Altogether, neither Mr. Woods nor Miss Hugonin got much comfort from their luncheon.    VII  After luncheon Billy had a quiet half-hour with the Colonel in the smoking-room.  Said Billy, between puffs of a cigar:  \"Peggy's changed a bit.\"  The Colonel grunted. Perhaps he dared not trust to words.  \"Seems to have made some new friends.\"  A more vigorous grunt.  \"Cultured lot, they seem?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10882"],["title","The Eagle's Shadow (#7)"],["body","Mr. Woods. \"Anxious to do good in the world, too--philanthropic set, eh?\"  A snort this time.  \"Eh?\" said Mr. Woods. There was dawning suspicion in his tone.  The Colonel looked about him. \"My boy,\" said he, \"you thank your stars you didn't get that money; and, depend upon it, there never was a gold-ship yet that wasn't followed.\"  \"Pirates?\" Billy Woods suggested, helpfully.  \"Pirates are human beings,\" said Colonel Hugonin, with dignity. \"Sharks, my boy; sharks!\"    VIII  That evening, after proper deliberation, \"Célestine,\" Miss Hugonin commanded, \"get out that little yellow dress with the little red bandanna handkerchiefs on it; and for heaven's sake, stop pulling my hair out by the roots, unless you want a _raving_ maniac on your hands, Célestine!\"  Whereby she had landed me in a quandary. For how, pray, is it possible for me, a simple-minded male, fittingly to depict for you the clothes of Margaret?--the innumerable vanities, the quaint devices, the pleasing conceits with which she delighted to enhance her comeliness? The thing is beyond me. Let us keep discreetly out of her wardrobe, you and I.  Otherwise, I should have to prattle of an infinity of mysteries--of her scarfs, feathers, laces, gloves, girdles, knots, hats, shoes, fans, and slippers--of her embroideries, rings, pins, pendants, ribbons, spangles, bracelets, and chains--in fine, there would be no end to the list of gewgaws that went to make Margaret Hugonin even more adorable than Nature had fashioned her. For when you come to think of it, it takes the craft and skill and life-work of a thousand men to dress one girl properly; and in Margaret's case, I protest that every one of them, could he have beheld the result of their united labours, would have so gloried in his own part therein that there would have been no putting up with any of the lot.  Yet when I think of the tiny shoes she affected--patent-leather ones mostly, with a seam running straight up the middle (and you may guess the exact date of our comedy by knowing in what year these shoes were modish); the string of fat pearls she so often wore about her round, full throat; the white frock, say, with arabesques of blue all over it, that Felix Kennaston said reminded him of Ruskin's tombstone; or that other white-and-blue one--_décolleté_, that was--which I swear seraphic mantua-makers had woven out of mists and the skies of June: when I remember these things, I repeat, almost am I tempted to become a boot-maker and a lapidary and a milliner and, in fine, an adept in all the other arts and trades and sciences that go to make a well-groomed American girl what she is--the incredible fruit of grafted centuries, the period after the list of Time's achievements--just that I might describe Margaret to you properly.  But the thing is beyond me. I leave such considerations, then, to Célestine, and resolve for the future rigorously to eschew all such gauds. Meanwhile, if an untutored masculine description will content you--  Margaret, I have on reliable feminine authority, was one of the very few blondes whose complexions can carry off reds and yellows. This particular gown--I remember it perfectly--was of a dim, dull yellow--flounciful (if I may coin a word), diaphanous, expansive. I have not the least notion what fabric composed it; but scattered about it, in unexpected places, were diamond-shaped red things that I am credibly informed are called medallions. The general effect of it may be briefly characterised as grateful to the eye and dangerous to the heart, and to a rational train of thought quite fatal.  For it was cut low in the neck; and Margaret's neck and shoulders would have drawn madrigals from a bench of bishops.  And in consequence, Billy Woods ate absolutely no dinner that evening.    IX  It was an hour or two later when the moon, drifting tardily up from the south, found Miss Hugonin and Mr. Kennaston chatting amicably together in the court at Selwoode. They were discussing the deplorable tendencies of the modern drama.  The court at Selwoode lies in the angle of the building, the ground plan of which is L-shaped. Its two outer sides are formed by covered cloisters leading to the palm-garden, and by moonlight--the night bland and sweet with the odour of growing things, vocal with plashing fountains, spangled with fire-flies that flicker indolently among a glimmering concourse of nymphs and fauns eternally postured in flight or in pursuit--by moonlight, I say, the court at Selwoode is perhaps as satisfactory a spot for a _tête-à-tête_ as this transitory world affords.  Mr. Kennaston was in vein to-night; he scintillated; he was also a little nervous. This was probably owing to the fact that Margaret, leaning against the back of the stone bench on which they both sat, her chin propped by her hand, was gazing at him in that peculiar, intent fashion of hers which--as I think I have mentioned--caused you fatuously to believe she had forgotten there were any other trousered beings extant.  Mr. Kennaston, however, stuck to apt phrases and nice distinctions. The moon found it edifying, but rather dull.  After a little Mr. Kennaston paused in his boyish, ebullient speech, and they sat in silence. The lisping of the fountains was very audible. In the heavens, the moon climbed a little further and registered a manifestly impossible hour on the sun-dial. It also brightened.  It was a companionable sort of a moon. It invited talk of a confidential nature.  \"Bless my soul,\" it was signalling to any number of gentlemen at that moment, \"there's only you and I and the girl here. Speak out, man! She'll have you now, if she ever will. You'll never have a chance like this again, I can tell you. Come, now, my dear boy, I'm shining full in your face, and you've no idea how becoming it is. I'm not like that garish, blundering sun, who doesn't know any better than to let her see how red and fidgetty you get when you're excited; I'm an old hand at such matters. I've presided over these little affairs since Babylon was a paltry village. _I'll_ never tell. And--and if anything should happen, I'm always ready to go behind a cloud, you know. So, speak out!--speak out, man, if you've the heart of a mouse!\"  Thus far the conscienceless spring moon.  Mr. Kennaston sighed. The moon took this as a promising sign and brightened over it perceptibly, and thereby afforded him an excellent gambit.  \"Yes?\" said Margaret. \"What is it, beautiful?\"  That, in privacy, was her fantastic name for him.  The poet laughed a little. \"Beautiful child,\" said he--and that, under similar circumstances, was his perfectly reasonable name for her--\"I have been discourteous. To be frank, I have been sulking as irrationally as a baby who clamours for the moon yonder.\"  \"You aren't really anything but a baby, you know.\" Indeed, Margaret almost thought of him as such. He was so delightfully naïf.  He bent toward her. A faint tremor woke in his speech. \"And so,\" said he, softly, \"I cry for the moon--the unattainable, exquisite moon. It is very ridiculous, is it not?\"  But he did not look at the moon. He looked toward Margaret--past Margaret, toward the gleaming windows of Selwoode, where the Eagle brooded:  \"Oh, I really can't say,\" Margaret cried, in haste. \"She was kind to Endymion, you know. We will hope for the best. I think we'd better go into the house now.\"  \"You bid me hope?\" said he.  \"Beautiful, if you really want the moon, I don't see the _least_ objection to your continuing to hope. They make so many little airships and things nowadays, you know, and you'll probably find it only green cheese, after all. What _is_ green cheese, I wonder?--it sounds horribly indigestible and unattractive, doesn't it?\" Miss Hugonin babbled, in a tumult of fear and disappointment. He was about to spoil their friendship now; men were so utterly inconsiderate. \"I'm a little cold,\" said she, mendaciously, \"I really must go in.\"  He detained her. \"Surely,\" he breathed, \"you must know what I have so long wanted to tell you--\"  \"I haven't the _least_ idea,\" she protested, promptly. \"You can tell me all about it in the morning. I have some accounts to cast up to-night. Besides, I'm not a good person to tell secrets to. You--you'd much better not tell me. Oh, really, Mr. Kennaston,\" she cried, earnestly, \"you'd much better not tell me!\"  \"Ah, Margaret, Margaret,\" he pleaded, \"I am not adamant. I am only a man, with a man's heart that hungers for you, cries for you, clamours for you day by day! I love you, beautiful child--love you with a poet's love that is alien to these sordid days, with a love that is half worship. I love you as Leander loved his Hero, as Pyramus loved Thisbe. Ah, child, child, how beautiful you are! You are fairest of created women, child--fair as those long-dead queens for whose smiles old cities burned and kingdoms were lightly lost. I am mad for love of you! Ah, have pity upon me, Margaret, for I love you very tenderly!\"  He delivered these observations with appropriate fervour.  \"Mr. Kennaston,\" said she, \"I am sorry. We got along so nicely before, and I was _so_ proud of your friendship. We've had such good times together, you and I, and I've liked your verses so, and I've liked you--Oh, please, _please_, let's keep on being just friends!\" Margaret wailed, piteously.  \"Friends!\" he cried, and gave a bitter laugh. \"I was never friends with you, Margaret. Why, even as I read my verses to you--those pallid, ineffectual verses that praised you timorously under varied names--even then there pulsed in my veins the riotous pæan of love, the great mad song of love that shamed my paltry rhymes. I cannot be friends with you, child! I must have all or nothing. Bid me hope or go!\"  Miss Hugonin meditated for a moment and did neither.  \"Beautiful,\" she presently queried, \"would you be very, very much shocked if I descended to slang?\"  \"I think,\" said he, with an uncertain smile, \"that I could endure it.\"  \"Why, then--cut it out, beautiful!"]]]
