I guess it'll do me good,\" said Rachel.  \"I hope it will,\" said her sister-in-law, sympathetically.  Rachel went to the nearest dry-goods store, and bought a yard of blue ribbon.  \"Only a yard?\" inquired the clerk, in some surprise.  \"That will do,\" said Rachel, nervously, coloring a little, as though the use which she designed for it might be suspected.  She paid for the ribbon, and presently returned.  \"Does your head feel any better, Rachel?\" asked Mrs. Harding.  \"A little,\" answered Rachel.  \"You've been sewing too steady lately, perhaps?\" suggested Martha.  \"Perhaps I have,\" assented Rachel.  \"You ought to spare yourself. You can't stand work as well as when you were younger,\" said Martha, innocently.  \"A body'd think I was a hundred by the way you talk,\" said Rachel, sharply.  \"I didn't mean to offend you, Rachel. I thought you might feel as I do. I get tired easier than I used to.\"  \"I guess I'll go upstairs,\" said Rachel, in the same tone. \"There isn't anybody there to tell me how old I am gettin'.\"  \"It's hard to make Rachel out,\" thought Mrs. Harding. \"She takes offense at the most innocent remark. She can't look upon herself as young, I am sure.\"  Upstairs Rachel took out the letter again, and read it through once more. \"I wonder what sort of a man Daniel is,\" she said to herself. \"I wonder if I have ever noticed him. How little we know what others think of us! If he's a likely man, maybe it's my duty to marry him. I feel I'm a burden to Timothy. His income is small, and it'll make a difference of one mouth. It may be a sacrifice, but it's my duty.\"  In this way Rachel tried to deceive herself as to the real reason which led her to regard with favoring eyes the suit of this supposed lover whom she had never seen, and about whom she knew absolutely nothing.  Jack came home from school at half-past two o'clock. He looked roguishly at his aunt as he entered. She sat knitting in her usual corner.  \"Will she go?\" thought Jack. \"If she doesn't there won't be any fun.\"  But Jack, whose trick I am far from defending, was not to be disappointed.  At three o'clock Rachel rolled up her knitting, and went upstairs. Fifteen minutes later she came down dressed for a walk.  \"Where are you going, Aunt Rachel?\" asked Jack.  \"Out for a walk,\" she answered, shortly.  \"May I go with you?\" he asked, mischievously.  \"No; I prefer to go alone,\" she said, curtly.  \"Your aunt has taken a fancy to walking,\" said Mrs. Harding, when her sister-in-law had left the house. \"She was out this forenoon. I don't know what has come over her.\"  \"I do,\" said Jack to himself.  Five minutes later he put on his hat and bent his steps also to Washington Park.     CHAPTER XI  MISS HARDING'S MISTAKE   Miss Rachel Harding kept on her way to Washington Park. It was less than a mile from her brother's house, and though she walked slowly, she got there a quarter of an hour before the time.  She sat down on a seat near the center of the park, and began to look around her. Poor Rachel! her heart beat quicker than it had done for thirty years, as she realized that she was about to meet one who wished to make her his wife.  \"I hope he won't be late,\" she murmured to herself, and she felt of the blue ribbon to make sure that she had not forgotten it.  Meanwhile Jack reached the park, and from a distance surveyed with satisfaction the evident nervousness of his aunt.  \"Ain't it rich?\" he whispered to himself.  Rachel looked anxiously for the gentleman with the red rose pinned to his coat.  She had to wait ten minutes. At last he came, but as he neared her seat, Rachel felt like sinking into the earth with mortification when she recognized in the wearer a stalwart negro. She hoped that it was a mere chance coincidence, but he approached her, and raising his hat respectfully, said:  \"Are you Miss Harding?\"  \"What if I am?\" she demanded, sharply. \"What have you to do with me?\"  The man looked surprised.  \"Didn't you send word to me to meet you here?\"  \"No!\" answered Rachel, \"and I consider it very presumptuous in you to write such a letter to me.\"  \"I didn't write you a letter,\" said the negro, astonished.  \"Then what made you come here?\" demanded the spinster.  \"Because you wrote to me.\"  \"I wrote to you!\" exclaimed Rachel, aghast.  \"Yes, you wrote to me to come here. You said you'd wear a blue ribbon on your neck, and I was to have a rose pinned to my coat.\"  Rachel was bewildered.  \"How could I write to you when I never saw you before, and don't know your name. Do you think a lady like me would marry a colored man?\"  \"Who said anything about that?\" asked the other, opening his eyes wide in astonishment. \"I couldn't marry, nohow, for I've got a wife and four children.\"  Rachel felt ready to collapse. Was it possible that she had made a mistake, and that this was not her unknown correspondent, Daniel?  \"There is some mistake,\" she said, nervously. \"Where is that letter you thought I wrote? Have you got it with you?\"  \"Here it is, ma'am.\"  He handed Rachel a letter addressed in a small hand to Daniel Thompson.  She opened it and read:    \"Mr. Thompson: I hear you are out of work. I may be able to give   you a job. Meet me at Washington Park, Tuesday afternoon, at four   o'clock. I shall wear a blue ribbon round my neck, and you may have   a red rose pinned to your coat. Otherwise I might not know you.    \"RACHEL HARDING.\"   \"Some villain has done this,\" said Rachel, wrathfully. \"I never wrote that letter.\"  \"You didn't!\" said Daniel, looking perplexed. \"Who went and did it, then?\"  \"I don't know, but I'd like to have him punished for it,\" said Rachel, energetically.  \"But you've got a blue ribbon,\" said Mr. Thompson. \"I can't see through that. That's just what the letter said.\"  \"I suppose somebody wrote the letter that knew I wear blue. It's all a mistake. You'd better go home.\"  \"Then haven't you got a job for me?\" asked Daniel, disappointed.  \"No, I haven't,\" said Rachel, sharply.  She hurriedly untied the ribbon from her neck, and put it in her pocket.  \"Don't talk to me any more!\" she said, frowning. \"You're a perfect stranger. You have no right to speak to me.\"  \"I guess the old woman ain't right in her head!\" thought Daniel. \"Must be she's crazy!\"  Poor Rachel! she felt more disconsolate than ever. There was no Daniel, then. She had been basely imposed upon. There was no call for her to sacrifice herself on the altar of matrimony. She ought to have been glad, but she wasn't.  Half an hour later a drooping, disconsolate figure entered the house of Timothy Harding.  \"Why, what's the matter, Rachel?\" asked Martha, who noticed her woe-begone expression.  \"I ain't long for this world,\" said Rachel, gloomily. \"Death has marked me for his own.\"  \"Don't you feel well this afternoon, Rachel?\"  \"No; I feel as if life was a burden.\"  \"You have tired yourself with walking, Rachel. You have been out twice to-day.\"  \"This is a vale of tears,\" said Rachel, hysterically. \"There's nothin' but sorrow and misfortune to be expected.\"  \"Have you met with any misfortune? I thought fortune was smiling upon us all.\"  \"It'll never smile on me again,\" said Rachel, despondently.  Just then Jack, who had followed his aunt home, entered.  \"Have you got home so quick, Aunt Rachel?\" he asked. \"How did you enjoy your walk?\"  \"I shall never enjoy anything again,\" said his aunt, gloomily.  \"Why not?\"  \"Because there's nothing to enjoy.\"  \"I don't feel so, aunt. I feel as merry as a cricket.\"  \"You won't be long. Like as not you'll be took down with fever to-morrow, and maybe die.\"  \"I won't trouble myself about it till the time comes,\" said Jack. \"I expect to live to dance at your wedding yet, Aunt Rachel.\"  This reference was too much. It brought to Rachel's mind the Daniel to whom she had expected to link her destiny, and she burst into a dismal sob, and hurried upstairs to her own chamber.  \"Rachel acts queerly to-day,\" said Mrs. Harding. \"I think she can't be feeling well. If she don't feel better to-morrow I shall advise her to send for the doctor.\"  \"I am afraid it was mean to play such a trick on Aunt Rachel,\" thought Jack, half repentantly. \"I didn't think she'd take it so much in earnest. I must keep dark about that letter. She'd never forgive me if she knew.\"  For some days there was an added gloom on Miss Rachel's countenance, but the wound was not deep; and after a time her disappointment ceased to rankle in her too sensitive heart.     CHAPTER XII  SEVEN YEARS   Seven years slipped by unmarked by any important change. The Hardings were still prosperous in an humble way. The cooper had been able to obtain work most of the time, and this, with the annual remittance for little Ida, had enabled the family not only to live in comfort, but even to save up one hundred and fifty dollars a year. They might even have saved more, living as frugally as they were accustomed to do, but there was one point in which they would none of them consent to be economical. The little Ida must have everything she wanted. Timothy brought home nearly every day some little delicacy for her, which none of the rest thought of sharing. While Mrs. Harding, far enough from vanity, always dressed with extreme plainness, Ida's attire was always of good material and made up tastefully.  Sometimes the little girl asked: \"Mother, why don't you buy yourself some of the pretty things you get for me?\"  Mrs. Harding would answer, smiling: \"Oh, I'm an old woman, Ida. Plain things are best for me.\"  \"No, I'm sure you're not old, mother. You don't wear a cap. Aunt Rachel is a good deal older than you.\"  \"Hush, Ida. Don't let Aunt Rachel hear that. She wouldn't like it.\"  \"But she is ever so much older than you, mother,\" persisted the child.  Once Rachel heard a remark of this kind, and perhaps it was that that prejudiced her against Ida. At any rate, she was not one of those who indulged her. Frequently she rebuked her for matters of no importance; but it was so well understood in the cooper's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10737"],["title","Book about Animals (#0)"],["body","ABOUT ANIMALS.  CONCORD, N. H.  RUFUS MERRILL.  1850.  [Illustration: Laplander Travelling.]   ABOUT ANIMALS.   [Illustration: Elephant.]  THE ELEPHANT.  Is the biggest of all land animals. He is more than five times as big as an ox. But he is a harmless creature, for all that. When he is wild, and lives in the woods, he will run away, if you attempt to go near him. When he is tame, he will take a piece of cake out of your pocket, and let you ride upon his back.   [Illustration: Ourang Outang.]  The Ourang Outang is a species of the ape; it has long arms and hands, with very long fingers. It is much larger than the ape, and some have been found about six feet high, when standing erect. It is capable of walking nearly erect; but the usual gait on the ground is like a cripple who supports himself on his hands, and draws his body forward. Its home, like the monkey family, seems to be on the trees. The hair is of a brownish red color, and covers his back, arms, legs, and the outside of his hands and feet. The face has no hair except whiskers on its side. He inhabits Malacca, Cochin China, and particularly the island of Borneo.   [Illustration: Opossums.]  The Opossum is an American animal, having a head like the fox, and large eyes. The head is mostly white, and the body is covered with long black-and-white hairs. He climbs up trees with great facility, hides himself in the leaves to catch birds, or hangs himself by the tail from a branch. It seeks its food in the night, and lives on fruit, insects, and birds' eggs. Its teeth are fifty in number. The most remarkable circumstance in the natural history of this animal is the pouch which is formed under the belly of the female, in which it carries its young ones when they are small. If the little creatures are frightened when absent from their mother, they scamper to this asylum as soon as possible.   [Illustration: The Antelope.]  THE COMMON ANTELOPE  Of this numerous tribe of animals, there is perhaps no species so truly elegant in its appearance as this, and although it is one of the most common, yet its habits are but little known. It is very numerous in all the northern parts of Africa. In size, it is rather smaller than the fallow deer. Its color is a dusky brown, mixed with red; the tail is short; the horns, which are about sixteen inches long, are black, distinctly annulated almost to the top, and have three curves. The brachia, or sides of the lyre, were frequently made of these horns, as appears from ancient gems. The female is destitute of horns, and has a white stripe on the flanks.   [Illustration: Hare.]  THE RABBIT.  The Rabbit is a very pretty animal, and loves to live about the house and barn, in a state of friendship with all around it. It has no defence, but to run away; and so harmless and innocent is it, that nobody can have the heart to do it injury. It feeds upon clover, apples, and other fruits, and will often sit for hours in some snug covered place, quietly chewing its cud, with the greatest satisfaction. There is another kind of rabbit, which runs wild in the woods and fields. He is remarkably swift of foot, and no dog can overtake him in a race, but a grey-hound. His fur is very soft, and is used in making coarse hats.   [Illustration: Musk Deer.]  THE MUSK DEER  These animals are found in the Alpine mountains of Asia and Siberia. Their favorite haunts are the tops of mountains covered with pines, where they delight to wander in places the most difficult of access. They are hunted for the sake of their well-known perfume, which is contained in an oval bag about the size of a small hen's egg, hanging from the abdomen. This receptacle is found constantly filled with a soft, unctuous, brownish substance, of the most powerful and penetrating scent, and which is the perfume in its natural state. When close, and in large quantities, the smell is very powerful and injurious.   [Illustration: Polar Bear.]  THE POLAR BEAR.  The Polar Bear is distinguished for his tremendous ferocity. They are very numerous in the polar seas. There it is seen not only on land and fixed ice, but on floating ice several leagues out at sea. At sea, the food of this animal is fish, seals, and the carcases of whales; on land, it preys upon deer and other animals, and will, like the Black Bear, eat many kinds of berries. In winter, it beds itself deeply under the snow or eminences of ice, and awaits, in a torpid state, the return of the sun.  The Black Bear lives in the woods of the United States, and is not as large as the Polar or Brown Bear, but lives very much like the Polar bear.   [Illustration: Flying Squirrel.]"]]]
