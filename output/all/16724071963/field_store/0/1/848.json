In consequence of this, the young people were obliged to give up the idea of an excursion to the Bush, and defer all dancing with pretty girls until their arrival in another hemisphere, for it was fated that they should not set foot in Europe again.  The transition from the Elbe to the North Sea is scarcely perceptible, as the Elbe is not divided into different channels, but is eight or ten miles broad at its mouth.  It almost forms a small sea of itself, and has even the green hue of one.  We were, consequently, very much surprised, on hearing the captain exclaim, in a joyful tone, \"We are out of the river at last.\"  We imagined that we had long since been sailing upon the wide ocean.  In the afternoon, we bore in sight of the island of Heligoland, which belongs to the English, and presented really a magical appearance, as it rose out from the sea.  It is a barren, colossal rock; and had I not learned, from one of the newest works on geography, that it was peopled by about 2,500 souls, I should have supposed the whole island to have been uninhabited.  On three sides, the cliffs rise so precipitously from the waves, that all access is impossible.  We sailed by the place at a considerable distance, and saw only the towers of the church and lighthouse, in addition to the so-called \"Monk,\" a solitary, perpendicular rock, that is separated from the main body, between which and it there sparkles a small strip of sea.  The inhabitants are very poor.  The only sources of their livelihood are fishing and bathing visitors.  A great number of the latter come every year, as the bathing, on account of the extraordinary swell, is reckoned extremely efficacious.  Unfortunately, great fears are entertained that this watering-place cannot exist much longer, as every year the island decreases in size, from the continual falling away of large masses of rock, so that some day the whole place may disappear into the sea.  From the 5th to the 10th of July, we had continued stormy and cold weather, with a heavy sea, and great rolling of the ship.  All we poor \"land-lubbers\" were suffering from sea sickness.  We first entered the British Channel, also called \"La Manche\" (420 miles from Cuxhaven) in the night of the 10-11th.  We awaited with impatience the rising of the sun, which would display to our gaze two of the mightiest powers in Europe.  Luckily, the day was fine and clear, and the two kingdoms lay before us, in such magnificence and proximity, that the beholder was almost inclined to believe that a sister people inhabited both countries.  On the coast of England, we saw the North Foreland, the Castle of Sandown, and the town of Deal, stretching out at the foot of the cliffs, which extend for many miles, and are about 150 feet high. Further on, we came in sight of the South Foreland; and lastly, the ancient castle of Dover, that sits right bravely enthroned upon an eminence, and overlooks the surrounding country, far and wide.  The town itself lies upon the sea-shore.  Opposite Dover, at the narrowest part of the channel, we distinguished, on the French coast, Cape Grisnez, where Napoleon erected a small building, in order, it is said, to be at least able to see England; and, further on, the obelisk raised in memory of the camp at Boulogne, by Napoleon, but completed under Louis Philippe.  The wind being unfavourable, we were obliged, during the night, to tack in the neighbourhood of Dover.  The great darkness which covered both land and sea rendered this maneuvre a very dangerous one; firstly, on account of the proximity of the coast; and, secondly, on account of the number of vessels passing up and down the channel.  To avoid a collision, we hung out a lantern on the foremast, while, from time to time, a torch was lighted, and held over the side, and the bell frequently kept sounding:  all very alarming occurrences to a person unused to the sea.  For fourteen days were we prisoners in the 360 miles of the Channel, remaining very often two or three days, as if spell-bound, in the same place, while we were frequently obliged to cruise for whole days to make merely a few miles; and near Start we were overtaken by a tolerably violent storm.  During the night I was suddenly called upon deck.  I imagined that some misfortune had happened, and hastily throwing a few clothes on, hurried up--to enjoy the astonishing spectacle of a \"sea-fire.\"  In the wake of the vessel I behold a streak of fire so strong that it would have been easy to read by its light; the water round the ship looked like a glowing stream of lava, and every wave, as it rose up, threw out sparks of fire.  The track of the fish was surrounded by dazzling inimitable brilliancy, and far and wide everything was one dazzling coruscation.  This extraordinary illumination of the sea is of very unfrequent occurrence, and rarely happens after long-continued, violent storms. The captain told me that he had never yet beheld the sea so lighted up.  For my part, I shall never forget the sight.  A second, and hardly less beautiful, spectacle came under our observation at another time, when, after a storm, the clouds, gilt by the rays of the sun, were reflected as in a mirror on the bosom of the sea.  They glittered and shone with an intensity of colour which surpassed even those of the rainbow.  We had full leisure to contemplate Eddystone Lighthouse, which is the most celebrated building of the kind in Europe, as we were cruising about for two days in sight of it.  Its height, and the boldness and strength with which it is built, are truly wonderful; but still more wonderful is its position upon a dangerous reef, situated ten miles from the coast; at a distance, it seems to be founded in the sea itself.  We often sailed so near the coast of Cornwall, that not only could we plainly perceive every village, but even the people in the streets and in the open country.  The land is hilly and luxuriant, and appears carefully cultivated.  During the whole time of our cruising in the Channel, the temperature was cold and raw, the thermometer seldom being higher than 65 to 75 degrees Fah.  At last, on the 24th of July, we came to the end of the Channel, and attained the open sea; the wind was tolerably favourable, and on the 2nd of August we were off Gibraltar, where we were becalmed for twenty-four hours.  The captain threw several pieces of white crockeryware, as well as a number of large bones overboard, to show how beautifully green such objects appeared as they slowly sank down beneath the sea; of course this can only be seen in a perfect calm.  In the evening we were greatly delighted by numbers of moluscae shining through the water; they looked exactly like so many floating stars, about the size of a man's hand; even by day we could perceive them beneath the waves.  They are of a brownish red, and in form resemble a toadstool; many had a thick pedicle, somewhat fimbriated on the under part; others, instead of the pedicle, had a number of threads hanging down from them.  4th August.  This was the first day that it was announced by the heat that we were in a southern latitude; but, as was also the case the following day, the clear dark blue sky that generally overarches the Mediterranean in such exceeding loveliness, was still wanting. We found, however, some slight compensation for this in the rising and setting of the sun, as these were often accompanied by unusual forms and colours of the clouds.  We were now off Morocco, and were fortunate enough today to perceive a great number of bonitos.  Every one on board bestirred himself, and on every side fish hooks were cast overboard; unluckily only one bonito allowed himself to be entrapped by our friendly invitations; he made a dart at the bait, and his good-natured confidence procured us a fresh meal, of which we had long been deprived.  On the 5th of August we saw land for the first time for twelve days. The sun was rising as the little island of Porto Santo greeted our sight.  It is formed of peaked mountains, which, by their shape, betray their volcanic origin.  A few miles in advance of the island stands the beautiful Falcon Rock, like a sentinel upon the look-out. We sailed past Madeira (23 miles from Porto Santo) the same day, but unluckily at such a distance that we could only perceive the long mountain chains by which the island is intersected.  Near Madeira lie the rocky Deserta Islands, which are reckoned as forming part of Africa.  Near these islands we passed a vessel running under reefed sails before the wind, whence the captain concluded that she was a cruiser looking after slavers.  On the 6th of August we beheld, for the first time, flying fish, but at such a distance that we could scarcely distinguish them.  On the 7th of August we neared the Canary Isles, but unfortunately, on account of the thick fog, we could not see them.  We now caught the trade wind, that blows from the east, and is anxiously desired by all sailors.  In the night of the 9-10th we entered the tropics.  We were now in daily expectation of greater heat and a clearer sky, but met with neither.  The atmosphere was dull and hazy, and even in our own raw fatherland the sky could not have been so overcast, except upon some days in November.  Every evening the clouds were piled upon one another in such a way that we were continually expecting to see a water-spout; it was generally not before midnight that the heavens would gradually clear up, and allow us to admire the beautiful and dazzling constellations of the South.  The captain told us that this was the fourteenth voyage he had made to the Brazils, during which time he had always found the heat very easily borne, and had never seen the sky otherwise than dull and lowering.  He said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],["title","A Woman's Journey Round the World (#3)"],["body","this was occasioned by the damp, unhealthy coast of Guinea, the ill effects of which were perceptible much further than where we then were, although the distance between us was 350 miles.  In the tropics the quick transition from day to night is already very perceptible; 35 or 40 minutes after the setting of the sun the deepest darkness reigns around.  The difference in the length of day and night decreases more and more the nearer you approach the Equator.  At the Equator itself the day and night are of equal duration.  All the 14th and 15th of August we sailed parallel with the Cape de Verde Islands, from which we were not more than 23 miles distant, but which, on account of the hazy state of the weather, we could not see.  During this period we used to be much amused by small flocks of flying-fish, which very often rose from the water so near the ship's side that we were enabled to examine them minutely.  They are generally of the size and colour of a herring; their side fins, however, are longer and broader, and they have the power of spreading and closing them like little wings.  They raise themselves about twelve or fifteen feet above the water, and then, after flying more than a distance of a hundred feet, dive down again for a moment beneath the waves, to recommence directly afterwards:  this occurs most frequently when they are pursued by bonitos or other foes. When they were flying at some distance from the ship they really looked like elegant birds.  We very frequently saw the bonitos also, who were pursuing them, endeavour to raise themselves above the water, but they seldom succeeded in raising more than their head.  It is very difficult to catch one of these little denizens of the air, as they are to be secured neither by nets or hooks; but sometimes the wind will drive them, during the night, upon the deck, where they are discovered, in the morning, dead, not having sufficient strength to raise themselves from dry places; in this way I obtained a few specimens.  Today, August 15th, we enjoyed a most interesting sight.  We happened, exactly at 12 o'clock, to be in the sun's zenith, and the sunbeams fell so perpendicularly that every object was perfectly shadowless.  We put books, chairs, ourselves in the sun, and were highly delighted with this unusual kind of amusement.  Luckily we had chanced to be at the right spot at the right time; had we, at the same hour, been only one degree nearer or one degree further, we should have lost the entire sight; when we saw it we were 14 degrees 6' (a minute is equal to a nautical mile).  All observations with the sextant {9} were out of the question until we were once more some degrees from the zenith.  17th August.  Shoals of tunny-fish, (fish four and five feet long, and belonging to the dolphin tribe,) were seen tumbling about the ship.  A harpoon was quickly procured, and one of the sailors sent out with it on the bowsprit; but whether he had bad luck, or was unskilled in the art of harpooning, he missed his mark.  The most wonderful part of the story, though, was that all the fish disappeared as if by magic, and did not appear again for some days; it seemed as if they had whispered and warned each other of the threatened danger.  All the oftener, however, did we see another inhabitant of the sea, namely, that beautiful mollusca, the physolida, called by the sailors Portugiesisches Segel-schiff; (Portuguese sailing-ship.) When floating upon the surface of the sea, with its long crest, which it can elevate or depress at pleasure, it really resembles a delicate tiny little sailing vessel.  I was very desirous of catching one of these little creatures, but this could only be effected by means of a net, which I had not got, nor had I either needle or twine to make one.  Necessity, however, is the mother of invention; so I manufactured a knitting needle of wood, unravelled some thick string, and in a few hours possessed a net.  Very soon afterwards a mollusca had been captured, and placed in a tub filled with sea water.  The little creature's body is about six inches long and two inches high; the crest extends over the whole of the back, and in the middle, where it is highest, measures about an inch and a half.  Both the crest and body are transparent, and appear as if tinged with rose colour; from the belly, which is violet, are suspended a number of threads or arms of the same colour.  I hung the little thing up to dry at the stern, outside the ship; some of the threads reached down into the water (a depth of at least twelve feet), but most of them fell off.  After the animal was dead, the crest remained erect, and the body perfectly filled out, but the beautiful rose colour gradually changed to white.  18th August.  Today we had a heavy thunder-storm, for which we were very grateful, as it cooled the air considerably.  Between 1 and 2 degrees, or 3 degrees North latitude, frequent changes in the weather are very common.  For instance, on the morning of the 20th we were overtaken by a strong wind, which lashed up the sea to a great height, and continued until evening, when it gave way to a tropical shower, which we at home should call a perfect water-spout. The deck was instantaneously transformed into a lake, while at the same time the wind had so completely fallen that even the rudder enjoyed a holiday.  This rain cost me a night's rest, for when I went to take possession of my berth, I found the bed-clothes drenched through and through, and was fain to content myself with a wooden bench for a couch.  On the 27th of August we got beyond these hostile latitudes, and were received by the anxiously desired south-east trade wind, which hurried us quickly on our voyage.  We were now very near the Equator, and, like all other travellers, wished very much to see the celebrated constellations of the south. I myself was most interested in the Southern Cross; and, as I could not find it among the stars, I begged the captain to point it out to me.  Both he and the first mate, however, said that they had never heard of it, and the second mate was the only one to whom it did not appear entirely unknown.  With his help, we really did discover in the spangled firmament four stars, which had something of the form of a somewhat crooked cross, but were certainly not remarkable in themselves, nor did they excite the least enthusiasm amongst us.  A most magnificent spectacle was, on the contrary, formed by Orion, Jupiter, and Venus; the latter, indeed, shone so brilliantly that her gleams formed a silver furrow across the waves.  The great frequency of falling stars is another fact that I cannot corroborate.  They are, perhaps, more frequent than in cold climates, but are far from being as common as is said:  and as for their size, I saw only one which surpassed ours; and this appeared about three times as large as an ordinary star.  For some days also we had now seen the Cape, or Magellan's Clouds, and also the so-called Black Cloud.  The first are bright, and, like the Milky Way, are formed of numberless small stars, invisible to the naked eye; the latter presents a black appearance, and is said to be produced by the absence of all stars whatever from this part of the heavens.  All these different signs prepared us for the most interesting moment of our voyage--namely, passing the line.  On the 29th of August, at 10 o'clock P.M., we saluted the southern hemisphere for the first time.  A feeling nearly allied to pride excited every one, but more especially those who crossed the line for the first time.  We shook each other by the hand, and congratulated one another mutually, as if we had done some great and heroic deed.  One of the passengers had brought with him a bottle or two of champagne to celebrate the event:  the corks sprang gaily in the air, and with a joyful \"huzza,\" the health of the new hemisphere was drunk.  No festivities took place among the crew.  This is at present the case in most vessels, as such amusements seldom end without drunkenness and disorder.  The sailors, however, could not let the cabin-boy, who passed the line for the first time, go quite scot- free; so he was well christened in a few buckets of salt water.  Long before passing the line, we passengers had frequently spoken of all the sufferings and tortures we should be subjected to at the Equator.  Every one had read or heard something exceedingly horrible, which he duly communicated to all the rest.  One expected headache or colic; a second had pictured to himself the sailors falling down from exhaustion; a third dreaded such a fearful degree of heat, that it would not only melt the pitch, {11} but would so dry up the ship, that nothing but continual throwing water over it could prevent its catching fire; while a fourth feared that all the provisions would be spoilt, and ourselves nearly starved to death.  For my own part, I had already congratulated myself on the tragical stories I should be able to present to my readers; I beheld them shedding tears at the narration of the sufferings we had experienced, and I already appeared to myself half a martyr.  Alas! I was sadly deceived.  We all remained in perfectly good health; not a sailor sank exhausted; the ship did not catch fire; and the provisions were not spoilt--they were just as bad as before.  3rd September.  From 2 to 3 degrees South latitude the wind is very irregular, and frequently excessively violent.  Today we passed the 8 degrees South latitude, without seeing land, which put the captain in the best of humours.  He explained to us, that if we had seen land, we should have been obliged to retrace our course almost to the line, because the current sets in with such violence towards the land, that the voyage could only be made at a proper distance.  7th September.  Between 10 and 20 degrees South latitude we again met with very peculiar prevalent winds.  They are called vamperos; and oblige the sailor to be always on his guard,"]]]
