Finally the Russian infantry succeeded in establishing a number of trenches, the one opposite us not more than five hundred yards away.  It was the first time we had come in close touch with the Russians, almost within hailing distance, and with the aid of our field glasses we could occasionally even get a glimpse of their faces and recognize their features.  We stayed four days opposite each other, neither side gaining a foot of ground.  It was there and then that I made a curious observation.  After the second day we had almost grown to know each other.  The Russians would laughingly call over to us, and the Austrians would answer.  The salient feature of these three days' fighting was the extraordinary lack of hatred.  In fact, it is astonishing how little actual hatred exists between fighting men.  One fights fiercely and passionately, mass against mass, but as soon as the mass crystallizes itself into human individuals whose features one actually can recognize, hatred almost ceases.  Of course, fighting continues, but somehow it loses its fierceness and takes more the form of a sport, each side being eager to get the best of the other.  One still shoots at his opponent, but almost regrets when he sees him drop.  By the morning of the third day we knew nearly every member of the opposing trench, the favorite of my men being a giant red-bearded Russian whose constant pastime consisted in jumping like a Jack-in-the-box from the trench, crying over to us as he did so.  He was frequently shot at, but never hit.  Then he grew bolder, showing himself longer and longer, until finally he jumped out of the trench altogether, shouting to us wildly and waving his cap.  His good-humored jollity and bravado appealed to our boys and none of them attempted to shoot at him while he presented such a splendid target. Finally one of our men, who did not want to be second in bravery, jumped out of the trench and presented himself in the full sunlight. Not one attempt was made to shoot at him either, and these two men began to gesticulate at each other, inviting each other to come nearer.  All fighting had suddenly ceased, and both opposing parties were looking on, laughing like boys at play.  Finally the Russian would draw a step nearer, and our man boldly advanced too.  Then the Russians urged on their man with shouts and laughter, and he made a big leap forward, standing still, whereupon the Austrian also jumped forward, and so, step by step, they approached until they nearly touched each other.  They had left their rifles behind, and we thought that they were going to indulge in a fist fight, all of us being sorry for our champion, for he was a small and insignificant-looking man who looked as if he could be crushed with one blow by his gigantic opponent.  But lo, and behold! The big Russian held out his hand which held a package of tobacco and our Austrian, seizing the tobacco, grasped the hand of the Russian, and then reaching in his pocket produced a long Austrian cigar, which he ceremoniously presented to the Russian.  It was indeed a funny sight to see the small, wiry, lean Austrian talking in exaggerated terms of politeness to the blond Russian giant, who listened gravely and attentively, as if he understood every word.  By this time all precautions and even ideas of fighting had been forgotten, and we were surprised to find ourselves out of the shelter of our trenches and fully exposed to the Russians, who, in turn, leaned out of their own trenches and showed their heads in full. This unofficial truce had lasted about twenty minutes, and succeeded more in restoring good humor and joy of life among our soldiers than a trainload of provisions would have done.  It was one of the incidents that helped to relieve the monotony of trench life and was heartily welcomed by all of us.  The fighting, however, soon was resumed with all its earnestness and fierceness, but from this moment on a certain camaraderie was established between the two opposing trenches.  Between skirmishes an unofficial truce would frequently be called for the purpose of removing the wounded. During these times when the stretcher-bearers were busy, no shot would be fired on either side.  Nor was this an isolated case, for similar intermittent truces, sometimes accompanied by actual intercourse between the opposing forces, were quite common all along the battle line.  That very night I was hurriedly summoned to the trenches of the 13th Company, about half a mile east of us, in order to act as an interpreter between the major commanding that battalion and two singular guests he had just received, a Russian officer and his orderly.  The pair, carrying a white flag, had hailed one of the numerous Austrian outposts placed during the night, in front of the trenches, and had been sent blindfolded back to the major.  The Russian officer spoke only broken French.  He commanded one of the opposing trenches, and from his narrative it appeared that his men had not received any food supplies for some days and were actually on the point of starvation.  Not being able to stand their misery any longer, he had taken the bull by the horns and, with the utter confidence and straightforwardness of a fearless nature, had simply come over to us, the enemy, for help, offering a little barrel of water which his companion carried on his head and a little tobacco, in exchange for some provisions.  The major seemed at first, perhaps, a little perplexed and undecided about this singular request, but his generous nature and chivalry soon asserted itself. One single look at the emaciated and worn faces of our guests sufficiently substantiated the truth of their story, for both men were utterly exhausted and on the verge of collapse.  The next minute messengers were flying to the different trenches of the battalion to solicit and collect contributions, and the officers scrambled over each other in their noble contest to deplete their own last and cherished reserves for the supper of the guests.  Soon the latter were seated as comfortably as circumstances permitted before a feast of canned beef, cheese, biscuits, and a slice of salami, my own proud contribution consisting of two tablets of chocolate, part of a precious reserve for extreme cases.  It was a strange sight to see these two Russians in an Austrian trench, surrounded by cordiality and tender solicitude.  The big brotherhood of humanity had for the time enveloped friend and foe, stamping out all hatred and racial differences.  It is wonderful how the most tender flowers of civilization can go hand in hand with the most brutal atrocities of grim modern warfare.  In the mean while the messengers had returned almost staggering under the weight of a sack filled with the gifts of our soldiers to the enemy,--pieces of bread and biscuits with here and there a slice of bacon or a lump of cheese, all thrown pele-mele together.  Many a man must have parted with his last piece of bread in order not to be outdone by the others in generosity, for our own provisions were running very low.  It is true that the bread and biscuits were mildewed, the cheese stale, and the bacon as hard as stone, but the boys gave the best they could, the very poverty and humbleness of the gifts attesting their own desperate plight, and bearing proud witness to the extent of their sacrifice.  With tears in their eyes and reiterated protestations of thanks, our guests staggered back through the night to their lines, undoubtedly carrying with them tender memories of Austrian generosity and hospitality.  On the morning of the next day a Russian detachment succeeded in storming a hill on our flank, commanding the strip of space between ourselves and our reserves in the rear, thus cutting us off from our main body.  They established there a machine-gun battery, and, although we were under cover in our trench, we were now in a very precarious position, for no more provisions or ammunition could reach us, all attempts to do so breaking down under a terrific machine-gun fire, but we had orders to hold our position at all cost and to the last man.  Unfortunately our ammunition was giving out, in spite of our husbanding it as much as possible and shooting only when we had a sure target.  The Russians soon found that each shot meant a victim and took no chances on showing even the tips of their caps.  Neither could we move the least bit without being the target for a volley from their side.  Up to this day I cannot understand why they did not try to rush us, but apparently they were unaware of our comparative weakness.  Also for another reason our position had become more and more untenable.  We were on swampy ground and the water was constantly oozing in from the bottom of the trench, so that we sometimes had to stand nearly knee-deep and were forced to bail the water out with our caps.  It is difficult to imagine a more deplorable situation than to have to stay for four days in a foul trench, half filled with swamp water, constantly exposed to the destructive fire of the enemy, utterly isolated and hopeless.  Soon we were completely without any food or water and our ammunition was almost exhausted.  During the night, here and there daring men would rush through the space swept by the Russian gun fire, which was kept up constantly, trying to bring us what scanty supplies they could procure from neighboring trenches better provided than we were, but the little they brought was nothing compared to our needs.  On the evening of that third day, knowing that our ammunition was giving out, we felt that the next day would bring the end, and all our thoughts turned homewards and to the dear ones.  We all wrote what we considered our parting and last farewell, each one pledging himself to deliver and take care of the letters of the others"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10967"],["title","Four Weeks in the Trenches: The War Story of a Violinist (#7)"],["body","he survived.  It was a grave, sad, deeply touching moment, when we resigned ourselves to the inevitable, and yet somehow we all felt relieved and satisfied that the end might come and grimly resolved to sell our lives dearly.  Never before had I as much reason to admire the wonderful power of endurance and stoicism of our soldiers as on that night.  Once resigned to the worst, all the old-time spirit returned, as if by magic. They sat together playing cards in as much moonlight as would fall into the deep trench, relating jokes and bolstering up one another's courage.  The fourth day broke gloomy, with a drizzling rain.  At ten o'clock one of our men became suddenly insane, jumped out of the trench, danced wildly and divested himself of every stitch of clothing while doing so.  Strange to say, the Russians must have realized that the man was insane, for they never fired at him, neither did they at the two men who jumped out to draw him back.  We succeeded in comforting and subduing him, and he soon fell into a stupor and remained motionless for some time.  As soon as darkness fell we succeeded in conveying him back to the reserves and I understand that he got quite well again in a few days.  At five o'clock that afternoon we suddenly received orders through a running messenger, who was braving the incessant machine-gun fire, that our positions were about to be abandoned and that we were to evacuate our trench under the cover of darkness, at eleven o'clock.  I cannot but confess that we all breathed more freely on the receipt of that information, but unfortunately the purpose could not be carried out.  The Russians by this time evidently had realized our comparatively defenseless condition and utter lack of ammunition, for that same night we heard two shots ring out, being a signal from our sentinels that they were surprised and that danger was near.  I hardly had time to draw my sword, to grasp my revolver with my left hand and issue a command to my men to hold their bayonets in readiness, when we heard a tramping of horses and saw dark figures swooping down upon us.  For once the Cossacks actually carried out their attack, undoubtedly owing to their intimate knowledge of our lack of ammunition.  My next sensation was a crushing pain in my shoulder, struck by the hoof of a horse, and a sharp knife pain in my right thigh.  I fired with my revolver at the hazy figure above me, saw it topple over and then lost consciousness.  This happened, to the best of my recollection, at about half past ten at night.  Upon coming to my senses I found my faithful orderly, kneeling in the trench by my side.  He fairly shouted with delight as I opened my eyes.  According to his story the Austrians, falling back under the cavalry charge, had evacuated the trench without noticing, in the darkness, that I was missing.  But soon discovering my absence he started back to the trench in search of me.  It was a perilous undertaking for him, for the Cossacks were still riding about, and he showed me with pride the place where a stray bullet had perforated his knapsack during the search.  He revived me, gave me first aid, and succeeded with great difficulty in helping me out of the trench.  For more than three hours we stumbled on in the night, trying to find our lines again.  Twice we encountered a small troop of Cossacks, but upon hearing the tramping we quietly lay down on the wayside without a motion until they had passed.  Happily we were not noticed by them, and from then we stumbled on without any further incident until we were hailed by an Austrian outpost and in safety.  By this time I was utterly exhausted and again lost consciousness. When I opened my eyes, I was in a little hut where our ambulance gave first aid.  Therefrom I was transported to the nearest field hospital.  This, however, had to be broken up and the wounded removed because of the Russian advance.  We were hastily put on big ambulance wagons without springs, the jolting of which over the bad road caused us such suffering that we should have almost preferred to walk or crawl.  We tried to reach the railway station at Komarno but found a Russian detachment had intercepted us.  In the streets of the village a shell burst almost in front of our wagons, making the horses shy and causing a great deal of confusion.  We had to turn back and after a long and wearisome detour reached our destination, the troop hospital in Sambor, in a state of great exhaustion.  There I remained but a day.  The less seriously wounded had to make place for the graver cases, and being among the former, I was transferred by hospital train to Miscolcy in Hungary.  The same crowded conditions prevailed here as in Sambor, and after a night's rest I again was put on board a Red Cross train en route to Vienna.  We were met at the station by a number of Red Cross nurses and assistant doctors.  To my great joy my wife was among the former, having been assigned to that particular duty.  A short official telegram to the effect that I was being sent home wounded on hospital train Number 16 was the first news she had received about me for fully four weeks.  None of my field postcards had arrived and she was suffering extreme nervous strain from the long anxiety and suspense, which she had tried in vain to numb by feverish work in her hospital.  I remained two weeks in Vienna and then was transferred to the sulphur bath of Baden near-by, where large hospitals had been established to relieve the overcrowding of Vienna.  There I remained until the first of November when I was ordered to appear before a mixed commission of army surgeons and senior officers, for a medical examination.  Two weeks later I received formal intimation that I had been pronounced invalid and physically unfit for army duty at the front or at home, and consequently was exempted from further service.  My military experience ended there, and with deep regret I bade good-bye to my loyal brother officers, comrades, and faithful orderly, and discarded my well-beloved uniform for the nondescript garb of the civilian, grateful that I had been permitted to be of any, if ever so little, service to my Fatherland."]]]
