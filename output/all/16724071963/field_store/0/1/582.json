Just then a shadow appeared in the doorway, and Katherine looked down to see a shrinking little figure with pipestem legs standing on the top step.  \"Hello!\" Katherine called gaily, from her airy perch. \"Are you our neighbor from Avernus? Do you want anything?\" she added, for the girl was swallowing nervously, and seemed to be on the verge of making a request.  \"Will somebody please show me how to make a bed?\" faltered the visitor in a thin, piping voice. \"It isn't made, and I don't know how to do it.\"  \"Daggers and dirks!\" exploded Katherine, nearly falling off the shelf under the stress of her emotion.  \"What's the matter with the rest of the folks in Avernus--can't they make beds either?\" asked Miss Armstrong, surveying the wisp of a girl in the doorway with an intent, solemn gaze that sent her into a tremble of embarrassment.  \"My 'tenty' hasn't come yet,\" she faltered in reply.  \"Who's your councilor?\"  \"I don't know; she isn't there.\" The voice broke on the last words, and the blue eyes overflowed with tears.  Katherine leaped from the shelf to the bed and down to the floor. \"I'll come over and help you make your bed,\" she said kindly.  \"All right,\" said Miss Armstrong, nodding gravely. \"You go over with her and I'll find out who's councilor in Avernus and send her around.\"  To herself she added, when the other two were out of earshot, \"Baby's away from it's mother for the first time, and it's homesick.\"  \"Poor thing,\" said Oh-Pshaw, who had overheard Miss Armstrong's remark.  \"She'll get over it,\" replied Miss Armstrong prophetically.  If Miss Armstrong was a novelty to the tenants of Bedlam, the councilor in Ponemah also seemed an odd character to the three girls she was to chaperon--only she was a much less agreeable surprise. She was a stout, fussy woman of about forty with thick eye-glasses which pinched the corners of her eyes into a strained expression. She greeted the girls briefly when they presented themselves to her, and in the next breath began giving orders about the arrangement of the tent. The beds must stand thus and so; the washstand must be on the other side from where it was; the mirror must stay on this side. And she must have half of the swinging shelf for her own; she could not possibly do with less; the others could get along as best they might with what was left.  \"We're supposed to divide the shelf up equally,\" announced Bengal Virden, who had begun to look upon Miss Peckham--that was her name--with extreme disapproval from the moment of their introduction. Bengal was a girl whose every feeling was written plainly upon her face; she could not mask her emotions under an inscrutable countenance. Her dislike of Miss Peckham was so evident that Migwan and Gladys had expected an outbreak before this; but Bengal had merely stood scowling while the beds were being moved about. With the episode of the swinging shelf, however, she flared into open defiance.  \"We're all to have an equal share of the shelf,\" she repeated.  \"Nonsense,\" replied Miss Peckham in an emphatic tone. \"I'm a councilor and I need more space.\"  Bengal promptly burst into tears. \"I want to be in Pom-pom's tent!\" she wailed, and fled from the scene, to throw herself upon Pom-pom in the next tent and pour out her tale of woe.  Migwan and Gladys looked at each other rather soberly as they went out to fill their water pitcher.  \"What a strange person to have as councilor,\" ventured Gladys. \"I thought councilors at camps were always as sweet as they could be. Miss Peckham looks as though she could be horrid without half trying.\"  \"Maybe it's just her way, though,\" replied Migwan good temperedly. \"She may be very nice inside after we get to know her. She's probably never been a councilor before, and thinks she must show her authority.\"  \"Authority!\" cried Gladys. \"But we're not babies; we're grown up. I'm afraid she's not going to be a very agreeable proctor.\"  \"Oh, well,\" replied Migwan gently, \"let's make the best of her and have a good time anyway. We mustn't let her spoil our fun for us. We'll probably find something to like in her before long.\"  \"I wish I had your angelic disposition,\" sighed Gladys, \"but I just can't like people when they rub me the wrong way, and Miss Peckham does that to me.\"  \"There's going to be trouble with the Elephant's Child,\" remarked Migwan soberly. \"She has already taken a strong dislike to Miss Peckham, and she is still childish enough to show it.\"  \"Yes, I'm afraid there will be trouble between Bengal and Miss Peckham,\" echoed Gladys, \"and we'll be constantly called upon to make peace. It's a role I'm not anxious for.\"  \"Let's not worry about it beforehand,\" said Migwan, charmed into a blissful attitude of mind toward the whole world by the sheer beauty of the scene that unrolled before her. The river, tinged by the long rays of the late afternoon sun, gleamed like a river of living gold, blinding her eyes and setting her to dreaming of magic seas and far countries. She stood very still for many minutes, lost in golden fancies, until Gladys took her gently by the arm.  \"Come, Migwan, are you going to day-dream here forever? There is the spring we are looking for, just at the end of that little path.\"  Migwan came slowly out of her reverie and followed Gladys down the hill to the spring.  \"It's all so beautiful,\" she sighed in ecstasy, turning to look back once more at the shimmering water, \"it just makes me _ache_. It makes everything unworthy in me want to crawl away and lose itself, while everything good in me wants to sing. Don't you feel that way about it, too?\"  \"Something like that,\" replied Gladys softly. \"When Nature is so lovely, it makes me want to be lovely, too, to match. I don't see how anyone could ever be angry here, or selfish, or mean. It's just like being made over, with all the bad left out.\"  \"It does seem that way,\" replied Migwan.  \"Here is the spring!\" cried both girls in unison, as they reached the end of the path and came upon a deep, rocky basin, filled with crystal clear water that gushed out from the rock above their heads, trickling down through ferns to be caught and held in the pool below, so still and shining that it reflected the faces of the two girls like a mirror.  \"Oh-h!\" breathed Migwan in rapture, sinking down among the ferns and lilies that bordered the spring and dabbling her fingers in the limpid water, \"I feel just like a wood-nymph, or a naiad, or whatever those folks were that lived by the springs and fountains in the Greek mythology.\"  Withdrawing her fingers from the water and clasping her hands loosely around her knees, she began to recite idly:    \"Dian white-armed has given me this cool shrine,   Deep in the bosom of a wood of pine;     The silver sparkling showers     That hive me in, the flowers   That prink my fountain's brim, are hers and mine;   And when the days are mild and fair,   And grass is springing, buds are blowing,     Sweet it is, 'mid waters flowing,     Here to sit and know no care,   'Mid the waters flowing, flowing, flowing,   Combing my yellow, yellow hair.\"  \"That poem must have been written about this very place,\" she added, dreamily gazing into the shadowy depths of the pool beside her.  \"Who wrote it?\" inquired Gladys.  \"I've forgotten,\" replied Migwan. \"I learned it once in Literature, a long time ago.\"  Both girls were silent, gazing meditatively into the pool, like _ gazing into a future-revealing crystal, each absorbed in her own day dreams. They were startled by the sound of a clear, musical piping, coming apparently from the tangle of bushes behind them. Now faint, now louder, it swelled and died away on the breeze, now fairly startling in its joyousness, now plaintive as the wind sighing among the reeds in some lonely spot after nightfall; alluring, thrilling, mocking by turns; elusive as the strains of fairy pipers; utterly ravishing in its sweetness.  Migwan and Gladys lifted their heads and looked at each other in wonder.  \"Pipes of Pan!\" exclaimed Migwan, and both girls glanced around, half expecting to see the graceful form of a faun gliding toward them among the trees. Nothing was to be seen, but the piping went on, merrily as before, rising, falling, swelling, dying away in the distance, breaking out again at near hand.  \"Oh, what _is_ it?\" cried Gladys. \"Is it a bird?\"  \"It can't be a bird,\" replied Migwan, \"it's a _tune--sort_ of a tune. No, I wouldn't exactly call it a tune, either, but it's different from a bird call. It sounds like pipes--fairy pipes--Pipes of Pan. Oh-h-h! Just _listen_! What _can_ it be?\"  The clear tones had leaped a full octave, and with a mingled sound of pipes and flutes went trilling deliriously on a high note until the listeners held their breath with delight. Then abruptly the piping stopped, ending in a queer, unfinished way that tantalized their ears for many minutes afterward, and held them motionless, spellbound, waiting for the strain to be resumed. They listened in vain; the mysterious piper called no more. Soon afterward a bugle pealed forth, sounding the mess call, and coming to earth with a start, the two girls raced back to Ponemah with their water pitcher and then hastened on into the dining room, where the campers, now all clad in regulation blue bloomers and white middies, were already assembled.     CHAPTER III   THE GREAT MYSTERY SOUND  After supper the camp was summoned to the smaller bungalow for first assembly and Sing-Out. Over the wide entrance doorway of this picturesque building among the trees was painted in large ornamental letters:              MATEKA  THE HOUSE OF JOYOUS LEARNING  This house, Dr. Grayson explained, was the place where all the craft work was to be done. The light from the lamps fell upon"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10688"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls at Camp Keewaydin; Or, Paddles Down (#4)"],["body","decorated board walls; wood-blocked curtains, quaint rustic benches and seats made from logs with the bark left on; flower-holders fashioned of birch bark; candlesticks of hammered brass, silver and copper; book covers of beaded leather; vases and bowls of glazed clay.  At one end of the long room stood a piano; at the other end was the huge cobblestone fireplace whose chimney the Winnebagos had noticed from the outside; in it a fire was laid ready for lighting.  The seventy-five girls filed in and seated themselves on the floor, looking expectantly at Dr. Grayson, who stood before the fireplace. He was an imposing figure as he stood there, a man over six feet tall, with a great head of white hair like a lion's mane, which, emphasizing the ruddy complexion and clear blue eyes, contrived to make him look youthful instead of old.  In a beautiful speech, full of both wisdom and humor, he explained the ideals of camp life, and heartily welcomed the group before him into the family circle of Camp Keewaydin. He spoke of the girls who in past years had stood out from the others on account of their superior camp spirit, and led up to the subject of the Buffalo Robe, which at the end of the season would be awarded to the one who should be voted by her fellow campers as the most popular girl.  A solemn hush fell over the assembly as he spoke, and all eyes were fastened upon the Buffalo Robe, hanging over the fireplace. Agony's heart gave a leap at the sight of the beautiful trophy, and then sank as she saw innumerable eyes turn to rest upon Mary Sylvester, sitting on a low stool at Dr. Grayson's feet, gazing up at him with a look of worship in her expressive eyes.  When he had finished speaking of the Buffalo Robe Dr. Grayson announced that the first fire of the season was to be lighted in the House of Joyous Learning to dedicate it to this year's group of campers, and kneeling down on the hearth, he touched off the faggots laid ready in the fireplace, and the flames, leaping and snapping, rose up the chimney, sending a brilliant glow over the room, and causing the most homesick youngster to brighten up and feel immensely cheered.  The fire lighted, and the House of Joyous Learning dedicated to its present occupants, Dr. Grayson proceeded to introduce the camp leaders and councilors. Mrs. Grayson came first, as Camp Mother and Chief Councilor. She was a large woman, and seemed capable of mothering the whole world as she sat before the hearth, beaming down upon the girls clustered around her on the floor, and there was already a note of genuine affection in the voices of the new girls as they joined in the cheer which the old girls started in honor of the Camp Mother.  The cheer was not yet finished when there was a sound of footsteps on the porch outside and a new girl stood in the doorway. She carried a blanket over one arm and held a small traveling bag in her hand. Her face was flushed with exertion and her chest heaved as she stood there looking inquiringly about the room with merry eyes that seemed to be delighted with everything they looked upon. Her face was round; her little button mouth was round; the comical stub of a nose which perched above it gave the effect of being round, too, while the deep dimple that indented her chin was very, _very_ round. Two still deeper dimples lurked in her cheeks, each one a silent chuckle, and the freckles that clustered thickly over her features all seemed to twinkle with a separate and individual hilarity.  An involuntary smile spread over the faces inside the bungalow as they looked at the newcomer, and one of the younger girls laughed aloud. That was the signal for a general laugh, and for a moment the room rang, and the strange girl in the doorway joined in heartily, and Dr. Grayson laughed, too, and everybody felt \"wound up\" and hilarious. Mrs. Grayson left her chair by the hearth and made her way through the group of girls on the floor to the newcomer, holding out her hand in welcome.  \"You must be Jean Lawrence,\" she said, drawing the girl into the room. \"You were to arrive by automobile at Green's Landing this noon, were you not, and come across the river in the mail boat? I have been wondering why you did not arrive on that boat.\"  \"Our automobile broke down on that road that runs through the long woods beyond Green's Landing,\" replied Jean, \"and when father found it could not be fixed on the road he decided to go back to the last town we had passed through and spend the night there; so I had to walk to Green's Landing. It was nearly nine miles and it took me all afternoon to get there. The mail boat had, of course, gone long ago, but a nice old grandpa man brought me over in a row boat.\"  \"You walked nine miles to Green's Landing!\" exclaimed Mrs. Grayson in astonishment. \"But, my dear, why didn't you wait and let your father drive you down in the morning?\"  \"Oh, I wouldn't miss a single night in camp for anything in the world!\" replied Jean. \"I would have walked if it had been _twenty_-nine miles. I nearly died of impatience before I got here, as it was!\"  Mrs. Grayson beamed on the enthusiastic camper; the old girls sang a lusty cheer to the new girl who was such a good sport; and, twinkling and beaming in all directions, Jean sat down on the floor with the others to hear the camp councilors introduced.  Dr. Grayson began by quoting humorously from the Proverbs: \"Where no council is, the people fall, but in a multitude of councilors there is safety.\"  One by one he called the councilors up and introduced them, beginning with his daughter Judith, who was to be gymnastic director at the camp. Miss Judy got up and made a bow, and then prepared to sit down again, but her father would not let her off so easily. He demanded a demonstration of her profession for the benefit of the campers. Miss Judy promptly lined all the other councilors up and put them through a series of ridiculous exercises, such as \"Tongues forward thrust!\" \"Hand on pocket place!\" \"Handkerchief take!\" \"Noses blow!\"--performance which was greeted with riotous applause by the campers.  Miss Armstrong was called up next and introduced as \"our little friend from Australia, the swimming teacher, who, on account of her diminutive size goes by the nickname of Tiny.\" Tiny was made to give her native Australian bush call of \"Coo-ee! Coo-ee!\" and was then told to rescue a drowning person in pantomime, which she did so realistically that the campers sat in shivering fascination. Tiny, still grave and unsmiling, sat down amid shouts for encore, and refused to repeat her performance, pretending to be overcome with bashfulness. Dr. Grayson then rose and said that since Tiny was too modest to appear in public herself, he would bring out her most cherished possession to respond to the encore, and held up the gaudy blanket that Katherine and Oh-Pshaw had already made merry over in the tent, explaining that Tiny always chose quiet, dull colors to match her retiring nature. With a teasing twinkle in his eyes he handed Tiny her blanket and then passed on to the next victim.  This was Pom-pom, the dancing teacher, who was obliged to do a dance on the piano stool to illustrate her art. Pom-pom received a perfect ovation, especially from the younger girls, and was called out half a dozen times.  \"Oh, the sweet thing! The darling!\" gushed Bengal Virden, going into a perfect ecstasy on the floor beside Gladys. \"Don't you just _adore_ her?\"  \"She's very pretty,\" replied Gladys sincerely.  \"Pretty!\" returned Bengal scornfully. \"She's the most beautiful person on earth! Oh, I love her so, I don't know what to _do_!\"  Gladys smiled indulgently at Bengal's gush, and turned away to see Jane Pratt's dull, unpleasant eyes gazing contemptuously upon Pom-pom's performance, and heard her whisper to her neighbor, \"She's too stiff-legged to be really graceful.\"  The Lone Wolf from Labrador, summoned to stand up and show herself next, was a long, lean, mournful-looking young woman who, when introduced, explained in a lugubrious voice that she had no talents like the rest of the councilors and didn't know enough to be a teacher of anything; but she was very good and pious, and had been brought to camp solely for her moral effect upon the other councilors.  For a moment the camp girls looked at the Lone Wolf in silence, not knowing what to make of her; then Sahwah noticed that Mrs. Grayson was biting her lips, while her eyes twinkled; Dr. Grayson was looking at the girls with a quizzical expression on his face; Miss Judy had her face buried in her handkerchief. Sahwah looked back at the Lone Wolf, standing there with her hands folded angelically and her eyes fixed solemnly upon the ceiling, and she suddenly snorted out with laughter. Then everyone caught on and laughed, too, but the Lone Wolf never smiled; she stood looking at them with an infinitely sad, pained expression that almost convinced them that she had been in earnest.  The Lone Wolf, it appeared, was to be Tent Inspector, and when that announcement was made, the laughter of the old girls turned to groans of pretended aversion, which increased to a mighty chorus when Dr. Grayson added that her eye had never been known to miss a single detail of disorder in a tent.  Thus councilor after councilor was introduced in a humorous speech by Dr. Grayson, and made to do her particular stunt, or was rallied about her pet hobby. The two Arts and Crafts teachers were given lumps of clay and a can of house paint and ordered to produce a statue and a landscape respectively; the Sing Leader had to play \"Darling, I Am Growing Old\" on a pitch pipe, and all the plain \"tent councilors\" were called upon for a \"few remarks.\"  All were cheered lustily, and all gave strong evidence of future popularity except Miss Peckham, who drew only a very scattered and perfunctory applause. Gladys and Migwan, who glanced at each other as Miss Peckham stepped forward, were surprised to hear that she was Dr."]]]
