Sugar and spice, and all that's nice!\" he added, smacking his lips, as he filled a glass from a long-necked bottle on the table; \"May the grocer's daughter prove sweeter than her father's plums, and more melting than his butter! Is she without? Are we to see her?\"  Wyvil made no answer, but, walking to the other end of the room, threw himself into a chair, and, covering his face with his hands, appeared wrapped in thought. Lydyard took a seat beside him, and endeavoured to engage him in conversation; but, finding his efforts fruitless, he desisted.  \"Something is wrong,\" observed Parravicin, to the major. \"He has been foiled in his attempt to carry off the girl. Sedley has won his wager, and it is a heavy sum. Shall we resume our play?\" he added, to Disbrowe.  \"I have nothing more to lose,\" observed the young man, filling a large goblet to the brim, and emptying it at a draught. \"You are master of every farthing I possess.\"  \"Hum!\" exclaimed Parravicin, taking up a pack of cards, and snapping them between his finger and thumb. \"You are married, Captain Disbrowe?\"  \"What if I am?\" cried the young man, becoming suddenly pale; \"what if I am?\" he repeated.  \"I am told your wife is beautiful,\" replied Parravicin.  \"Beautiful!\" ejaculated Pillichody; \"by the well-filled coffers of the widow of Watling-street! she is an angel. Beautiful is not the word: Mrs. Disbrowe is divine!\"  \"You have never seen her,\" said the young man, sternly.  \"Ha!--fire and fury! my word doubted,\" cried the major, fiercely. \"I have seen her at the play-houses, at the Mulberry-garden, at court, and at church. Not seen her! By the one eye of a Cyclops, but I have! You shall hear my description of her, and judge of its correctness. _Imprimis_, she has a tall and majestic figure, and might be a queen for her dignity.\"  \"Go on,\" said Disbrowe, by no means displeased with the commencement.  \"Secondly,\" pursued Pillichody, \"she has a clear olive complexion, bright black eyes, hair and brows to match, a small foot, a pretty turn-up nose, a dimpling cheek, a mole upon her throat, the rosiest lips imaginable, an alluring look--\"  \"No more,\" interrupted Disbrowe. \"It is plain you have never seen her.\"  \"Unbelieving pagan!\" exclaimed the major, clapping his hand furiously upon his sword. \"I have done more--I have spoken with her.\"  \"A lie!\" replied Disbrowe, hurling a dice-box at his head.  \"Ha!\" roared Pillichody, in a voice of thunder, and pushing back his chair till it was stopped by the wall. \"Death and fiends! I will make mincemeat of your heart, and send it as a love-offering to your wife.\"  And, whipping out his long rapier, he would have assaulted Disbrowe, if Sir Paul had not interposed, and commanded him authoritatively to put up his blade.  \"You shall have your revenge in a safer way,\" he whispered.  \"Well, Sir Paul,\" rejoined the bully, with affected reluctance, \"as you desire it, I will spare the young man's life. I must wash away the insult in burgundy, since I cannot do so in blood.\"  With this, he emptied the flask next him, and called to a drawer, who was in attendance, in an imperious tone, to bring two more bottles.  Parravicin, meanwhile, picked up the dice-box, and, seating himself, spread a large heap of gold on the table.  \"I mentioned your wife, Captain Disbrowe,\" he said, addressing the young officer, who anxiously watched his movements, \"not with any intention of giving you offence, but to show you that, although you have lost your money, you have still a valuable stake left.\"  \"I do not understand you, Sir Paul,\" returned Disbrowe, with a look of indignant surprise.  \"To be plain, then,\" replied Parravicin, \"I have won from you two hundred pounds--all you possess. You are a ruined man, and, as such, will run any hazard to retrieve your losses. I give you a last chance. I will stake all my winnings, nay, double the amount, against your wife. You have a key of the house you inhabit, by which you admit yourself at all hours; so at least the major informs me. If I win, that key shall be mine. I will take my chance for the rest. Do you understand me now?\"  \"I do,\" replied the young man, with concentrated fury. \"I understand that you are a villain. You have robbed me of my money, and would rob me of my honour.\"  \"These are harsh words, sir,\" replied the knight, calmly; \"but let them pass. We will play first, and fight afterwards. But you refuse my challenge?\"  \"It is false!\" replied Disbrowe, fiercely, \"I accept it.\" And producing a key, he threw it on the table. \"My life is, in truth, set on the die,\" he added, with a desperate look--\"for if I lose, I will not survive my shame.\"  \"You will not forget our terms,\" observed Parravicin. \"I am to be your representative to-night. You can return home to-morrow.\"  \"Throw, sir--throw,\" cried the young man, fiercely.  \"Pardon, me,\" replied the knight; \"the first cast is with you. A single main decides it.\"  \"Be it so,\" returned Disbrowe, seizing the box. And as he shook the dice with a frenzied air, the major and Lydyard drew near the table, and even Wyvil roused himself to watch the result.  \"Twelve!\" cried Disbrowe, as he removed the box. \"My honour is saved! My fortune retrieved--Huzza!\"  \"Not so fast,\" returned Parravicin, shaking the box in his turn. \"You were a little too hasty,\" he added, uncovering the dice. \"I am twelve, too. We must throw again.\"  \"This to decide,\" cried the young officer, again rattling the dice. \"Six!\"  Parravicin smiled, took the box, and threw ten.  \"Perdition!\" ejaculated Disbrowe, striking his brow with his clenched hand. \"What devil tempted me to my undoing?--My wife trusted to this profligate! Horror!--it must not be!\"  \"It is too late to retract,\" replied Parravicin, taking up the key, and turning with a triumphant look to his friends.  Disbrowe noticed the smile, and stung beyond endurance, drew his sword, and called to the knight to defend himself.  In an instant, passes were exchanged. But the conflict was brief. Fortune, as before, declared herself in favour of Parravicin. He disarmed his assailant, who rushed out of the room, uttering the wildest ejaculations of rage and despair.  \"I told you you should have your revenge,\" observed the knight to Pillichody, as soon as Disbrowe was gone. \"Is his wife really as beautiful as you represent her?\"  \"Words are too feeble to paint her charms,\" replied the major. \"Shafts of Cupid! she must be seen to be appreciated.\"  \"Enough!\" returned Parravicin. \"I have not made a bad night's work of it, so far. I'faith, Wyvil, I pity you. To lose a heavy wager is provoking enough--but to lose a pretty mistress is the devil.\"  \"I have lost neither yet,\" replied Wyvil, who had completely recovered his spirits, and joined in the general merriment occasioned by the foregoing occurrence. \"I have been baffled, not defeated. What say you to an exchange of mistresses? I am so diverted with your adventure, that I am half inclined to give you the grocer's daughter for Disbrowe's wife. She is a superb creature--languid as a Circassian, and passionate as an Andalusian.\"  \"I can't agree to the exchange, especially after your rapturous description,\" returned Parravicin, \"but I'll stake Mrs. Disbrowe against Amabel. The winner shall have both. A single cast shall decide, as before.\"  \"No,\" replied Wyvil, \"I could not resign Amabel, if I lost. And the luck is all on your side to-night.\"  \"As you please,\" rejoined the knight, sweeping the glittering pile into his pocket. \"Drawer, another bottle of burgundy. A health to our mistresses!\" he added, quaffing a brimmer.  \"A health to the grocer's daughter!\" cried Wyvil, with difficulty repressing a shudder, as he uttered the pledge.  \"A health to the rich widow of Watling-street,\" cried Pillichody, draining a bumper, \"and may I soon call her mine!\"  \"I have no mistress to toast,\" said Lydyard; \"and I have drunk wine enough. Do not forget, gentlemen, that the plague is abroad.\"  \"You are the death's-head at the feast, Lydyard,\" rejoined Parravicin, setting down his glass. \"I hate the idea of the plague. It poisons all our pleasures. We must meet at noon to-morrow, at the Smyrna, to compare notes as to our successes. Before we separate, can I be of any further service to you, Wyvil? I came here to enjoy _your_ triumph; but, egad, I have found so admirable a bubble in that hot-headed Disbrowe, whom I met at the Smyrna, and brought here to while away the time, that I must demand your congratulations upon _mine_.\"  \"You have certainly achieved an easy victory over the husband,\" returned Wyvil; \"and I trust your success with the wife will be commensurate. I require no further assistance. What I have to do must be done alone. Lydyard will accompany me to the house, and then I must shift for myself.\"  \"Nay, we will all see you safe inside,\" returned Parravicin, \"We shall pass by the grocer's shop. I know it well, having passed it a hundred times, in the vain hope of catching a glimpse of its lovely inmate.\"  \"I am glad it _was_ a vain hope,\" replied Wyvil. \"But I must scale a wall to surprise the garrison.\"  \"In that case you will need the rope-ladder,\" replied Lydyard; \"it is in readiness.\"  \"I will carry it,\" said Pillichody, picking up the ladder which was lying in a corner of the room, and throwing it over his shoulders. \"Bombs and batteries! I like to be an escalader when the forts of love are stormed.\"  The party then set out. As they proceeded, Parravicin ascertained from the major that Disbrowe's house was situated in a small street leading out of Piccadilly, but as he could not be quite sure that he understood his informant aright, he engaged him to accompany him and point it out.  By this time they had reached Wood-street, and keeping in the shade, reconnoitred the house.

CHAPTER I   \"LA-A-A-DIES AN' GEN'L'MUN\"  All through the exhibition the two sat unmoved; yet on the whole it was the best Wild West show that ever stirred sawdust in Madison Square Garden and it brought thunders of applause from the crowded house. Even if the performance could not stir these two, at least the throng of spectators should have drawn them, for all New York was there, from the richest to the poorest; neither the combined audiences of a seven-day race, a prize-fight, or a community singing festival would make such a cosmopolitan assembly.  All Manhattan came to look at the men who had lived and fought and conquered under the limitless skies of the Far West, free men, wild men--one of their shrill whoops banished distance and brought the mountain desert into the very heart of the unromantic East. Nevertheless from all these thrills these two men remained immune.  To be sure the smaller tilted his head back when the horses first swept in, and the larger leaned to watch when Diaz, the wizard with the lariat, commenced to whirl his rope; but in both cases their interest held no longer than if they had been old vaudevillians watching a series of familiar acts dressed up with new names.  The smaller, brown as if a thousand fierce suns and winds had tanned and withered him, looked up at last to his burly companion with a faint smile.  \"They're bringing on the cream now, Drew, but I'm going to spoil the dessert.\"  The other was a great, grey man whom age apparently had not weakened but rather settled and hardened into an ironlike durability; the winds of time or misfortune would have to break that stanch oak before it would bend.  He said: \"We've half an hour before our train leaves. Can you play your hand in that time?\"  \"Easy. Look at 'em now--the greatest gang of liars that never threw a diamond hitch! Ride? I've got a ten-year kid home that would laugh at 'em all. But I'll show 'em up. Want to know my little stunt?\"  \"I'll wait and enjoy the surprise.\"  The wild riders who provoked the scorn of the smaller man were now gathering in the central space; a formidable crew, long of hair and brilliant as to bandannas, while the announcer thundered through his megaphone:  \"La-a-a-dies and gen'l'mun! You see before you the greatest band of subduers and breakers of wild horses that ever rode the cattle ranges. Death defying, reckless, and laughing at peril, they have never failed; they have never pulled leather. I present 'Happy' Morgan!\"  Happy Morgan, yelling like one possessed of ten shrill-tongued demons, burst on the gallop away from the others, and spurring his horse cruelly, forced the animal to race, bucking and plunging, half way around the arena and back to the group. This, then, was a type of the dare-devil horse breaker of the Wild West? The cheers travelled in waves around and around the house and rocked back and forth like water pitched from side to side in a monstrous bowl.  When the noise abated somewhat, \"And this, la-a-a-dies and gen'l'mun, is the peerless, cowpuncher, 'Bud Reeves.'\"  Bud at once imitated the example of Happy Morgan, and one after another the five remaining riders followed suit. In the meantime a number of prancing, kicking, savage-eyed horses were brought into the arena and to these the master of ceremonies now turned his attention.  \"From the wildest regions of the range we have brought mustangs that never have borne the weight of man. They fight for pleasure; they buck by instinct. If you doubt it, step down and try 'em. One hundred dollars to the man who sticks on the back of one of 'em--but we won't pay the hospital bill!\"  He lowered his megaphone to enjoy the laughter, and the small man took this opportunity to say: \"Never borne the weight of a man! That chap in the dress-suit, he tells one lie for pleasure and ten more from instinct. Yep, he has his hosses beat. Never borne the weight of man! Why, Drew, I can see the saddle-marks clear from here; I got a mind to slip down there and pick up the easiest hundred bones that ever rolled my way.\"  He rose to make good his threat, but Drew cut in with: \"Don't be a damn fool, Werther. You aren't part of this show.\"  \"Well, I will be soon. Watch me! There goes Ananias on his second wind.\"  The announcer was bellowing: \"These man-killing mustangs will be ridden, broken, beaten into submission in fair fight by the greatest set of horse-breakers that ever wore spurs. They can ride anything that walks on four feet and wears a skin; they can--\"  Werther sprang to his feet, made a funnel of his hand, and shouted: \"Yi-i-i-ip!\"  If he had set off a great quantity of red fire he could not more effectively have drawn all eyes upon him. The weird, shrill yell cut the ringmaster short, and a pleased murmur ran through the crowd. Of course, this must be part of the show, but it was a pleasing variation.  \"Partner,\" continued Werther, brushing away the big hand of Drew which would have pulled him down into his seat; \"I've seen you bluff for two nights hand running. There ain't no man can bluff all the world three times straight.\"  The ringmaster retorted in his great voice: \"That sounds like good poker. What's your game?\"  \"Five hundred dollars on one card!\" cried Werther, and he waved a fluttering handful of greenbacks. \"Five hundred dollars to any man of your lot--or to any man in this house that can ride a real wild horse.\"  \"Where's your horse?\"  \"Around the corner in a Twenty-sixth Street stable. I'll have him here in five minutes.\"  \"Lead him on,\" cried the ringmaster, but his voice was not quite so loud.  Werther muttered to Drew:  \"Here's where I hand him the lemon that'll curdle his cream,\" and ran out of the box and straight around the edge of the arena. New York, murmuring and chuckling through the vast galleries of the Garden, applauded the little man's flying coat-tails.  He had not underestimated the time; in a little less than his five minutes the doors at the end of the arena were thrown wide and Werther reappeared. Behind him came two stalwarts leading between them a rangy monster. Before the blast of lights and the murmurs of the throng the big stallion reared and flung himself back, and the two who lead him bore down with all their weight on the halter ropes. He literally walked down the planks into the arena, a strange, half-comical, half-terrible spectacle. New York burst into applause. It was a trained horse, of course, but a horse capable of such training was worth applause.  At that roar of sound, vague as the beat of waves along the shore, the stallion lurched down on all fours and leaped ahead, but the two on the halter ropes drove all their weight backward and checked the first plunge. A bright-coloured scarf waved from a nearby box, and the monster swerved away. So, twisting, plunging, rearing, he was worked down the arena. As he came opposite a box in which sat a tall young man in evening clothes the latter rose and shouted: \"Bravo!\"  The fury of the stallion, searching on all sides for a vent but distracted from one torment to another, centred suddenly on this slender figure. He swerved and rushed for the barrier with ears flat back and bloodshot eyes. There he reared and struck at the wood with his great front hoofs; the boards splintered and shivered under the blows.  As for the youth in the box, he remained quietly erect before this brute rage. A fleck of red foam fell on the white front of his shirt. He drew his handkerchief and wiped it calmly away, but a red stain remained. At the same time the two who led the stallion pulled him back from the barrier and he stood with head high, searching for a more convenient victim.  Deep silence spread over the arena; more hushed and more hushed it grew, as if invisible blankets of soundlessness were dropping down over the stirring masses; men glanced at each other with a vague surmise, knowing that this was no part of the performance. The whole audience drew forward to the edge of the seats and stared, first at the monstrous horse, and next at the group of men who could \"ride anything that walks on four feet and wears a skin.\"  Some of the women were already turning away their heads, for this was to be a battle, not a game; but the vast majority of New York merely watched and waited and smiled a slow, stiff-lipped smile. All the surroundings were changed, the flaring electric lights, the vast roof, the clothes of the multitude, but the throng of white faces was the same as that pale host which looked down from the sides of the Coliseum when the lions were loosed upon their victims.  As for the wild riders from the cattle ranges, they drew into a close group with the ringmaster between them and the gaunt stallion, almost as if the"]]]
