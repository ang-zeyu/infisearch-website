We had not the means of doing this, and consequently     could only try to hold as much country as possible, and occupy as     large a force of the enemy as could be kept in front of us. The     movement against Cheat Mountain, which failed, was undertaken with     a view of causing the enemy to contract his lines, and enable     us to unite the troops under Generals Jackson (of Georgia) and     Loring. After the failure of this movement on our part, General     Rosecrans, feeling secure, strengthened his lines in that part of     the country, and went with a part of his forces to the Kanawha,     driving our forces across the Gauley. General Lee then went to     that line of operations, to endeavor to unite the troops under     Generals Floyd and Wise, and stop the movements under Rosecrans.     General Loring, with a part of his force from Valley Mountain,     joined the forces at Sewell Mountain. Rosecrans's movement was     stopped, and, the season for operations in that country being     over, General Lee was ordered to Richmond, and soon afterward sent     to South Carolina, to meet the movement of the enemy from Port     Royal, etc. He remained in South Carolina until shortly before the     commencement of the campaign before Richmond, in 1862.\"  The months spent by General Lee in superintending the coast defences of South Carolina and Georgia, present nothing of interest, and we shall therefore pass to the spring of 1862, when he returned to Richmond. His services as engineer had been highly appreciated by the people of the South, and a writer of the period said: \"The time will yet come when his superior abilities will be vindicated, both to his own renown and the glory of his country.\" The time was now at hand when these abilities, if the individual possessed them, were to have an opportunity to display themselves.     XII.  LEE'S LAST INTERVIEW WITH BISHOP MEADE.   A touching incident of Lee's life belongs to this time--the early spring of 1862. Bishop Meade, the venerable head of the Episcopal Church in Virginia, lay at the point of death, in the city of Richmond. When General Lee was informed of the fact, he exhibited lively emotion, for the good bishop, as we have said in the commencement of this narrative, had taught him his catechism when he was a boy in Alexandria. On the day before the bishop's death. General Lee called in the morning to see him, but such was the state of prostration under which the sick man labored, that only a few of his most intimate friends were permitted to have access to his chamber. In the evening General Lee called again, and his name was announced to Bishop Meade. As soon as he heard it, he said faintly, for his breathing had become much oppressed, and he spoke with great difficulty: \"I must see him, if only for a few moments.\"  General Lee was accordingly introduced, and approached the dying man, with evidences of great emotion in his countenance. Taking the thin hand in his own, he said:  \"How do you feel, bishop?\"  \"Almost gone,\" replied Bishop Meade, in a voice so weak that it was almost inaudible; \"but I wanted to see you once more.\"  He paused for an instant, breathing heavily, and looking at Lee with deep feeling.  \"God bless you! God bless you, Robert!\" he faltered out, \"and fit you for your high and responsible duties. I can't call you 'general'--I must call you 'Robert;' I have heard you your catechism too often.\"  General Lee pressed the feeble hand, and tears rolled down his cheeks.  \"Yes, bishop--very often,\" he said, in reply to the last words uttered by the bishop.  A brief conversation followed, Bishop Meade making inquiries in reference to Mrs. Lee, who was his own relative, and other members of the family. \"He also,\" says the highly-respectable clergyman who furnishes these particulars, \"put some pertinent questions to General Lee about the state of public affairs and of the army, showing the most lively interest in the success of our cause.\"  It now became necessary to terminate an interview which, in the feeble condition of the aged man, could not be prolonged. Much exhausted, and laboring under deep emotion, Bishop Meade shook the general by the hand, and said:  \"Heaven bless you! Heaven bless you! and give you wisdom for your important and arduous duties!\"  These were the last words uttered during the interview. General Lee pressed the dying man's hand, released it, stood for several minutes by the bedside motionless and in perfect silence, and then went out of the room.  On the next morning Bishop Meade expired.  [Illustration: Environs of Richmond.]     PART II.  _IN FRONT OF RICHMOND_.      I.  PLAN OF THE FEDERAL CAMPAIGN.   The pathetic interview which we have just described took place in the month of March, 1862.  By the latter part of that month, General McClellan, in command of an army of more than one hundred thousand men, landed on the Peninsula between the James and York Rivers, and after stubbornly-contested engagements with the forces of General Johnston, advanced up the Peninsula--the Confederates slowly retiring. In the latter part of May, a portion of the Federal forces had crossed the Chickahominy, and confronted General Johnston defending Richmond.  Such was the serious condition of affairs in the spring of 1862. The Federal sword had nearly pierced the heart of Virginia, and, as the course of events was about to place Lee in charge of her destinies, a brief notice is indispensable of the designs of the adversaries against whom he was to contend on the great arena of the State.  While the South had been lulled to sleep, as it were, by the battle of Manassas, the North, greatly enraged at the disaster, had prepared to prosecute the war still more vigorously. The military resources of the South had been plainly underestimated. It was now obvious that the North had to fight with a dangerous adversary, and that the people of the South were entirely in earnest. Many journals of the North had ridiculed the idea of war; and one of them had spoken of the great uprising of the Southern States from the Potomac to the Gulf of Mexico as a mere \"local commotion\" which a force of fifty thousand men would be able to put down without difficulty. A column of twenty-five thousand men, it was said, would be sufficient to carry all before it in Virginia, and capture Richmond, and the comment on this statement had been the battle of Manassas, where a force of more than fifty thousand had been defeated and driven back to Washington.  It was thus apparent that the war was to be a serious struggle, in which the North would be compelled to exert all her energies. The people responded to the call upon them with enthusiasm. All the roving and adventurous elements of Northern society flocked to the Federal standard, and in a short time a large force had once more assembled at Washington. The work now was to drill, equip, and put it in efficient condition for taking the field. This was undertaken with great energy, the Congress co√∂perating with the Executive in every manner. The city of Washington resounded with the wheels of artillery and the tramp of cavalry; the workshops were busy night and day to supply arms and ammunition; and the best officers devoted themselves, without rest, to the work of drilling and disciplining the mass.  By the spring of 1862 a force of about two hundred thousand men was ready to take the field in Virginia. General Scott was not to command in the coming campaigns. He had retired in the latter part of the year 1861, and his place had been filled by a young officer of rising reputation--General George B. McClellan, who had achieved the successes of Rich Mountain and Carrick's Ford in Western Virginia. General McClellan was not yet forty, but had impressed the authorities with a high opinion of his abilities. A soldier by profession, and enjoying the distinction of having served with great credit in the Mexican War, he had been sent as United States military commissioner to the Crimea, and on his return had written a book of marked ability on the military organizations of the powers of Europe. When the struggle between the North and South approached, he was said--with what truth we know not--to have hesitated, before determining upon his course; but it is probable that the only question with him was whether he should fight for the North or remain neutral. In his politics he was a Democrat, and the war on the South is said to have shocked his State-rights view. But, whatever his sentiments had been, he accepted command, and fought a successful campaign in Western Virginia. From that moment his name became famous; he was said to have achieved \"two victories in one day,\" and he received from the newspapers the flattering name of \"the Young Napoleon.\"  The result of this successful campaign, slight in importance as it was, procured for General McClellan the high post of commander-in-chief of the armies of the United States. Operations in every portion of the South were to be directed by him; and he was especially intrusted with the important work of organizing the new levies at Washington. This he performed with very great ability. Under his vigorous hand, the raw material soon took shape. He gave his personal attention to every department; and the result, as we have said, in the early spring of 1862, was an army of more than two hundred thousand men, for operations in Virginia alone.  The great point now to be determined was the best line of operations against Richmond. President Lincoln was strongly in favor of an advance by way of Manassas and the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, which he thought would insure the safety of the Federal capital. This was always, throughout the whole war, a controlling consideration with him; and, regarded in the light of subsequent events, this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10700"],["title","The History of England from the First Invasion (#0)"],["body","Proofreaders      The History of England  From The First Invasion By The Romans To The Accession Of King George The Fifth   BY  JOHN LINGARD, D.D.
