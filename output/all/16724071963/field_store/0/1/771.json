Their publication is the result of persuasion from many sources that, before returning to the war zone, I should put into connected form my personal experiences as correspondent during the first year of the War of Nations.  A few of these adventures were mentioned in news letters from the Continent, where I limited myself so far as possible to descriptions of armies at war and peoples in time of stress; but the greater part of them were merely jotted down from time to time for my own benefit in \"The Log of a Noncombatant.\"    Contents  I.

The Sorrow Of The People  Appendix: Atrocities     The Log Of A Noncombatant  Chapter I  From Broadway To Ghent    When the war broke out in August, 1914, I was at work in the City Room of the \"New York Evening Post.\" One morning, during the first week of activities, the copy boy handed me a telegram which was signed \"Luther, Boston,\" and contained the rather cryptic message: --\"How about this fight?\"  It was some moments before I could recall the time, more than two years before, when I had last seen the writer, Willard B.  Luther, Boston lawyer, devotee of some, and critic of many kinds of sport.  We had been sitting on that previous occasion--a crowd of college fellows, including Luther and myself--in a certain room in Cambridge, Massachusetts, not far from the University in that neighborhood where Luther had attended the Law School and the rest of us, on our respective graduation days, had received valuable pieces of parchment with the presidential signature attached.  The conversation had already run through the question of Votes for Women, progressive politics, and prize-fights, and before the card game began it had settled on the last-named, chiefly because of my own vainglorious description of adventures at Reno, Nevada, at the time of the Jeffries-Johnson battle for the heavyweight championship of the world.  I remember telling with some gusto of my first newspaper interview--one with \"Bob\" Fitzsimmons, then the Old Man of the ring, and \"Gentleman\" Jim Corbett, who was Jeffries' trainer at Reno.  \"I had always wanted to see that performance,\" said Luther, \"and would have gone in a flash if I could have got any one to make the trip with me.  But remember this fact: whenever the next big fight is held I'm going with you.\" Later in the evening we shook hands on the proposition.  At the time that Luther's telegram came I was planning to start for the Continent as Staff Correspondent of the \"New York Evening Post\" and Special Correspondent of the \"Boston Journal.\" Remembering that Cambridge agreement I immediately wired:--  \"Yes.  This fight will do.\"  So that is how it came to pass that Luther and myself boarded the Campania together, landed in Liverpool, cast about for ways and means of getting into the scrimmage, and for the first month and a half of my four months of wandering on the Continent were brother conspirators, until the duties of partnership called my friend home and left me without a companion in adventure.  In London we absorbed to some extent a heavy British fog and to a greater extent British public opinion.  We marveled at the exterior calm of a nation plunged in the greatest of wars, yet fighting, so it seemed at the time, with its top hat on and its smile still undisturbed.  Across the English Channel three days later the Dutch steam packet Princess Juliana carried us safely through mine fields and between lanes of British torpedo boats and torpedo boat destroyers.  We landed on the Continent at Flushing.  Thence we headed for The Hague, Holland, the neutral gateway of northern Europe, where we found the American Minister, Dr. Henry van Dyke, and his first secretary, Marshall Langhorne, shouldering the work of the American Legation in its chameleonesque capacity as bank, post-office, detective bureau, bureau of information, charity organization, and one might even say temporary home for the stranded travelers of every rank and nation.  Antwerp, the temporary capital of Belgium, was at this time invested, but not yet besieged, by the German army.  On the south the city was already cut off by several regiments of the Ninth and Tenth German Army Corps under General von Boehn.  The River Scheldt and the Dutch border formed a wall on the north and west.  It was to Antwerp, therefore, that we determined to go.  After listening to the usual flood of warnings against entering the fighting zone, and drinking our fill of stories of atrocity and hate which every refugee brought across the border into Holland, we took a couple of reefs in our baggage, and, hoisting our knapsacks, set our course for the temporary Belgian capital.  By rail we traveled south across the level fields and lush green meadows of Holland, over bridges ready to be dynamited in case of invasion, and through training camps of the 450,000 Dutch soldiers then mobilized along the border.  At a little town called Eschen the train stopped because the Belgians had torn up the tracks.  Seated on the cross-piece of a joggling two-wheeled ox cart, moving at the rate of not more than four miles an hour, with a dumb specimen for a driver, and a volume of Baedeker for interpreter and guide, we got our first glimpse of the hideous thing called war. Judging from the looks of the country and the burning villages, we were on the heels of a devastating army.  For three, four, and five miles on either side of the road beautiful trees lay flat upon the ground.  It was not until we saw groups of Belgian soldiers tearing down their own walls and hedges and applying match and gasolene to those which still stood, that we realized that this was a case of self-inflicted destruction.  Farmhouses, stores, churches, old Belgian mansions, and windmills were either in flames or smouldering ruins. Where burning had not been sufficient, powder and dynamite had been applied to destroy landmarks which for centuries had been the country's pride.  As far as the eye could reach the countryside was flattened to a desert.  It reminded me of the Salem fire, through which, while the piles of debris were still smoking, I had been taken in the \"Boston Journal's\" car.  But instead of a single town, here for twenty miles along lay stretched a smouldering waste.  The devastation was for the defensive purpose of giving an unobstructed view to the cannon of Antwerp's outer fortifications, which on that side covered one sector of the circle swept by her enormous guns.  I should hesitate to mention the millions of dollars of self-inflicted damage to Antwerp's suburbs alone.  Luther and I did not at the time have the military password.  So that first day was a specimen in the matter of hold-ups and arrests.  From the time that we started across the level plains which approach the city until we got through the double sector of forts, we were stopped, questioned, and searched by thirteen different groups of soldiers.  There were marry occasions where, after one pair of stupid sentries had put us through the grill, a second pair, watching from a distance of thirty yards or so, promptly repeated the entire performance.  As these fellows spoke only Flemish dialect, our conversations were not particularly fluent.  Frequently there gathered around us a crowd of gaping peasants, and when the word \"Americaine\" came out, there were \"Oh's\" and \"Ah\" of astonishment, or as often, when our explanations were not believed, sibilant hisses that shaped themselves into the menacing word \"Spion.\" We had been led to believe that sooner or later a wool-witted sentry would shoot first and investigate later; but so far they had simply crossed bayonets, or with their hands up and palms outward had signaled us to halt.  Our experience that day, as later events proved, was not an extraordinary occurrence for war-time, especially for those endeavoring to gain entrance to an invested city.  But as our first and maiden adventure it somewhat shook our nerve.  When the grilling was over we felt about as guilty as any criminal who has been put through the third degree as practiced in the old police department days, and I had several times to look over my passport and letters of credentials to persuade myself that I was really not a spy.  Eventually we were permitted to pass the gates of the Gare du Nord.  Once inside the city gates, we made our way into the Place Verte and went directly to the Hotel St. Antoine, whose proprietor sent our names to police headquarters.  The St. Antoine was at that time the residence of the diplomatic corps and the Belgian ministers of state, and was fifty yards from the Royal Palace and across the street from headquarters of the Belgian General Staff.  There is no need of describing in detail Antwerp at the time of my first visit.  One or two pictures will suffice to give a rough idea of its existence up to the time of the bombardment.  Try to imagine, for example, going about your business in New York or Boston or Los Angeles (of course Antwerp is smaller than these) when your country, a territory perhaps the size of the New England States, was already two thirds overrun, burnt, smashed, and conquered by a hostile nation, whose forces were now within nineteen miles of the gates of the capital.  Imagine that nation's warriors in the act of crushing your tiny army, whose remnants were already exhausted and on the verge of despair.  Then picture a quaint, sleepy city, with shadowy alleys and twisting, gabled streets, in which every other store and house was decorated with King Albert's picture or draped in the red, black, and yellow"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10918"],["title","The Log of a Noncombatant (#1)"],["body","of the country-a city whose atmosphere was charged with fear and suspicion and excitement.  Sometimes a crowd of a thousand or two drew one toward the Central Station where bedraggled refugee families, just arrived from Liege, Termonde, Aerschot, and Malines, stood on street corner or wagon top and thrilled the crowd with tales of atrocities and the story of their flight from their burning homes to the south.  Now and then the crowd parted before the clanging bell of a Red Cross ambulance rushing its load of bleeding bodies to the hospitals along the Place de Meir. Nurses, male or female, clung to the ambulance steps.  The first one I saw made a vivid impression on me.  She was an English-looking girl in a new khaki skirt, supporting with one hand what was left of a blood-dripping head,--the eyes and nose were shot away,--while out of the other hand she ate with apparent relish a thick rye-bread sandwich.  Occasionally she waved remnants of the sandwich at the gaping crowd.  It struck me as a peculiarly unnecessary exhibition of her callous fitness for the job of nurse.  During the daytime the ordinary things of life went on, for the good burghers and shopkeepers went about their business as usual, and, generally speaking, fought against fear as bravely as the soldiers in the trenches stood up against the German howitzers.  It was only after dark (when martial law permitted no lights of any kind) that the city seemed to shiver and suck in its breath; doors were barricaded, iron shutters came down, and behind them the people talked in whispers. Military autos, fresh from the firing line, groaned and sputtered at the doorstep of the St. Antoine; soldiers with pocket lanterns stamped about the streets.  From sheer nervousness after a day of confinement some citizens, in spite of warnings, groped about the more important avenues at night.  Picture yourself on Broadway or Tremont Street, with not a light on the street gleaming from a window, and walking up and down with one hand on your wallet and the other in the pocket where your Colt automatic ought to be.  Such, very briefly, was the condition of Antwerp at the time when we arrived.  That very evening word came in that the Belgian forces, which had been engaged with the enemy for five consecutive days of severe fighting, had retired behind the southern ramparts of the city.  During the night the stream of incoming wounded confirmed the news of battle.  In the moonlight, and later in the gray dawn, I watched the long lines of Belgian hounds, pulling their rapid-fire guns out toward the trenches.  Many times later I was destined to see them.  They made a picturesque and stimulating sight--those faithful dogs of war --fettered and harnessed, their tongues hanging out as they lay patiently beneath the gun trucks awaiting the order to go into action, or, when the word had been given, trotted along the dusty roads, each pair tugging to the battle front a lean, gray engine of destruction.  For our purpose the best approach to Brussels was by way of Ghent. Luther pushed on ahead while I was finishing a story.  The following morning, shouldering my knapsack, which now contained an extra supply of army rations, and carefully stuffing my different sets of credentials in different pockets (one for Belgian, one for German, and one for English consumption), I crossed the River Scheldt and made a slow and tortuous railway journey to Ghent.  Ghent lies thirty miles west of Antwerp.  The trip took seven hours. During the course of it I passed north of the Belgian lines and through the western sector of forts, that is to say, Fort St. Nicholas, Fort Haesdonck, and Fort Tete de Flandre.  It was the same road along which Winston Churchill's English marines and the remnant of the Belgian forces retreated after the fall of Antwerp.  Ghent resounded with praises of its American Vice-Consul, Julius Van Hee, a hair-trigger politician and a live wire if there ever was one. Van Hee, with his intimate knowledge of four languages and the Yankee knack of being on the right spot at the right time, twice saved blood-shed in the streets of Ghent and in one instance probably prevented a repetition of the scenes at Louvain.  In Ghent I again found Luther, with a fine young rumor in his pocket --a rumor which turned out to be correct--that six German spies were to be executed next morning at sunrise.  The place mentioned was behind the museum in a public park.  \"I suppose we'll take it in,\" said Luther.  \"I don't know about that,\" I answered; adding that, although executions might be part of the day's work for a war correspondent, I drew the line at seeing my first murder before breakfast.  The tip was correct enough except that it mentioned the wrong park.  The following noon the Military Governor, according to regulations, caused to be posted circulars announcing that the men had been put to death; but at all events I am glad to say that at that early date I did not have the experience of watching six blindfolded wretches backed up against a wall, of seeing the officer drop his arm as a signal, and of hearing the fatal crack of a dozen muskets, as the bodies collapsed like a telescope, crumpled inward with the chin upon the chest, and fell forward to the earth.     Chapter II  The Second Bombardment Of Termonde    September 15th was our day with Henry Verhagen, the tall gray alderman of the town that was once Termonde.  During all the time I was with him Verhagen did not speak a bitter word.  On the contrary, he was calm--particularly calm as he stood beside the mound where the Belgian soldiers were buried in the center of the ruined town, pointed to the pile of bricks where he had lived, and told us how in two nights he had lost 340,000 francs, his son, his factory, and his home.  It was from him, from the burgomaster's wife, and from a priest that we learned the story of the city that had ceased to be.  It was the night before that I had wandered into Ghent alone, without even the excitement of getting arrested.  Luther, who became restive early the next morning while I was jotting notes in the log-book, went off in search of adventure.  Because of the influence exerted by Vice- Consul Van Hee an arrangement was very soon made whereby a Belgian Government car and chauffeur were placed at our disposal. We had no laissez-passer for the firing line; but we were accompanied by the United States Consul and not governed by any stipulation as to our destination.  In our Belgian car, decorated with all the American flags we could find, and \"American Consular Service\" pasted in huge letters on the windshield and side flaps, we raced along the Boulevard de l'lndustrie, swung into the southern suburbs, and, once outside the city limits, we opened up the exhaust and threw down the throttle as Van Hee shouted out the order:--\"To Termonde!\"  Termonde was at that time the scene of determined fighting between units of the ninth German Corps and the Belgian defenders.  Situated as it is, twenty-one miles southeast of Ghent, it marks the southwest corner of a square formed by Louvain and Termonde on the south, by Ghent and Antwerp on the north.  It controlled the bridge over the River Scheldt and with it an important approach to Antwerp, the capital at that time of Belgium.  The heavy German siege guns, capable of demolishing a first-class fort at a range of several miles, could not have crossed the river so easily at any other point.  For this reason the Germans particularly wanted Termonde--an open bridge to Antwerp was always worth the taking.  The town had already at that time been captured and recaptured; wounded and refugees were swarming into Ghent full of battle stories and tales of terrible atrocities.  So it was Termonde that we vowed we would see.  We first saw Verhagen trudging in the same direction as ourselves on the level, dusty road two miles southwest of Ghent.  As we approached a cross-road marked by a tavern, a couple of direction-posts, and nondescript stucco buildings, we made out two Belgian sentries, with their rifles lifted overhead and indulging in some acrobatic exercises which we interpreted as a signal to halt.  Van Hee swapped cigarettes with them and gossiped in their native tongue, in return for which they gave us some good advice.  They warned us to pay no attention to sign-posts, which, in order to fool the enemy, were either marked with false names or else were pointed in the wrong direction.  While we were talking, a tall gray alderman came along the road with a greasy package under his arm and at his side a priest--one of those ubiquitous black-robed figures with a hat like an inverted oatmeal bowl.  \"Where to?\" asked the Vice-Consul of Ghent.  \"A Dendermonde,\" (to Termonde), answered Verhagen, sizing us up as strangers, and using French instead of the local Flemish dialect.  \"You know the road?\"  \"Yes, well,\" said Verhagen; and so, partly because of charity and partly because we could have him as a useful guide, we took him into the car.  As we sped through the level lanes of poplars, challenged as usual by every Belgian regular or Garde Civique who could boast a uniform, the smooth green meadows of Flanders with their trim hamlets of stucco and tile seemed to deny the reports of savagery we had heard the night before.  We had been told, and we had read, of German atrocities, and we had talked with survivors of Louvain.  There was pillage, burning, and looting in Louvain, we had agreed, but the cruelty to women and children was the better part myth.  And at all events, there was a semblance of cause for that.  Perhaps there had been more resistance, more sniping by citizens than generally known, and perhaps the German side had not been fully explained.  Then suddenly Termonde lay before us.  The center of the bridge was gone.  Splintered timber sticking on end lay in the mud at the river's side, along with iron beams torn by the charges of dynamite.  The current was"]]]
