I think he is the kind of a fellow to go to pieces in an instant.\"  \"You can't tell about that. I have a fancy that he's deceptive.\"  None of them, save Rattleton, possibly, knew that Merriwell was reserving any of his strength when he struck his foe.  The fellows who a short time before were the most indignant against the Southerner because he seemed determined to \"blow\" were now forced to admire his bulldog tenacity and sand.  Merriwell had no desire to severely injure Diamond, although he had felt some resentment toward the fellow for forcing him into a duel with rapiers.  To Frank it had seemed that the Virginian had no hesitation in taking advantage of an enemy, for Diamond must have presumed that Merriwell knew nothing of the art of fencing and swordplay.  But for this belief, Merriwell would have been inclined to keep on and tire his enemy out, without striking a single blow that could leave a mark.  But when Frank came to consider everything, he decided that it was no more than fair that he should give his persistent foe a certain amount of punishment.  Again and again Frank cross countered and upper-cut Diamond, and gradually he came to strike harder as the Virginian forced the fighting, without showing signs of letting up.  Bruises and swellings began to appear on Diamond's face. On one cheek Merriwell's knuckles cut through the skin, and the blood began to run, creeping down to his chin and dropping on the bosom of his white shirt.  Still, from the determination and fury with which he fought, it seemed that Diamond was utterly unconscious that he had been struck at all.  Jack did not consider how he had led Frank into a duel with rapiers without knowing whether the fellow he hated had ever taken a fencing lesson in all his life.  His one thought was that, being an expert boxer himself, Merriwell had forced him to a fist fight, believing it would be easy to dispose of him that way.  Diamond's hatred of Frank made him blind to the fact that he was in the least to blame, and filled him with a passionate belief that he could kill the smiling Northerner without a qualm of conscience--without a pang of remorse.  At last, disgusted with his non-success in striking Frank at all, he sprang forward suddenly and grappled with him.  Frank had been on the watch for that move.  Then the boys saw a pretty struggle for a moment, ending with Diamond being lifted and dropped heavily, squarely on his back.  Merriwell came down heavily on his persistent enemy.  Frank fell on Jack with the hope of knocking the wind out of the fellow and thus bringing the fight to a close.  For a few moments it seemed that he had succeeded.  Frank sprang up lightly, just as Tad Horner grappled him by the hair with both hands and yelled: \"Break away!\"  Roland Ditson was at Diamond's side in a twinkling.  \"Come, come, old man!\" he whispered; \"get up and get into the game again! Don't let them count you out!\"  But the Virginian was gasping for breath, and he did not seem to hear the words of his second.  \"That settles it,\" said Puss Parker, promptly.  \"Better wait and see,\" advised Bruce Browning. \"Diamond may not give up when he gets his breath.\"  \"It doesn't look as if he'd ever get his breath again.\"  Harry Rattleton was at Frank's side, swiftly saying:  \"Why didn't you knock him out and show the fellows what you can do? You monkeyed with the goat too long. He's stuffy, and you had to settle him sometime. It didn't make a dit of bifference whether it was first or last.\"  \"That's all right,\" smiled Frank. \"He's got sand, and I hated to nail him hard. It seemed a shame to thump such a fellow and cover his face with decorations.\"  \"Shame? shame?\" spluttered Harry. \"Why, didn't he force you into a duel with rapiers, or try to? and he is an expert! Say, what's the matter with you? If I'd been in your place I'd gone into him tooth and nail, and I wouldn't have left him in the shape of anything. Have you got a soft spot around you somewhere, Merriwell?\"  \"I admire sand, even if it is in an enemy.\"  \"You take the cherry pie--yes, you take the whole bakery!\"  Harry gazed at his roommate in wonder that was not entirely unmingled with pity and disgust. He could not understand Merriwell, and such generosity toward a persistent foe on the part of Frank seemed like weakness.  In the meantime Ditson had been urging Diamond to get up.  \"They'll call the scrap finished if you don't get onto your pins in a jiffy,\" he warned. \"Horner's got his watch in his hand.\"  Still the Virginian gasped for breath and seemed unable to lift a hand. If ever a fellow seemed done up, it was Diamond just then.  Roll Ditson ground his teeth in despair.  \"Oh, Merriwell will think he is cock of the walk now!\" he muttered. \"He'll crow and strut! He's laughing over it now!\"  \"Wh-what's that?\" gasped Diamond, trying to sit up.  \"He is laughing at you,\" hurriedly whispered Ditson, lying glibly. \"I just heard him tell Rattleton that he could have knocked the stuffing out of you in less than a quarter of a minute. He says you'll never dare face him again.\"  \"Oh, he does! oh, he does!\" came huskily from Diamond's lips. \"Well, we'll see about that--we'll see!\"  With Ditson's aid he got upon his feet. Then his breath and his strength seemed to come to him in a twinkling. With a backward snap of his arm he flung his second away. Then uttering a hoarse cry, he rushed like a mad bull at the lad he hated.     CHAPTER V.  THE FINISH.   Diamond's recovery and the manner in which he resumed the fight caused general astonishment. Even Bruce Browning had come to think that the Virginian was \"out.\"  Frank was taken by surprise. Before he could square away to meet his foe, Diamond struck him a terrific blow near the temple, knocking him into Rattleton's arms.  \"Foul!\" cried Harry, excitedly. \"Horner hadn't given the word.\"  \"Foul! foul!\" came from all sides.  \"There is no foul in this fight save when something is used besides fists,\" declared Merriwell as he staggered from his roommate's arms. \"It's all right and it goes.\"  But he found that everything seemed swimming around him, and dark spots were pursuing each other before his eyes. The floor seemed to heave like the deck of a ship at sea. He put out his hand to grasp something, and then he was struck again.  Once more Rattleton's arms kept Frank from going down.  \"This is no square deal!\" Harry shouted. \"By the poly hoker--I mean the holy poker! I'll take a hand in this myself!\"  He would have released Merriwell and jumped into the ring, but Frank's strong fingers closed on his arm.  \"Steady, old man!\" came sharply from Merriwell's lips. \"I am in this yet awhile. If Diamond finishes me he is to be let alone. The fellow that lays a hand on him is no friend of mine!\"  \"You give me cramps!\" groaned Harry.  Instead of aiding in finishing Frank, Diamond's second blow seemed to straighten him up, as if it had cleared a fog from his brain. The spots disappeared before his eyes and things ceased to swim around him.  Into the ring to meet his foe sprang Frank, and, to the astonishment of everybody he still smiled.  At the same time, Merriwell knew he had toyed with Diamond too long. He realized that the Virginian's first blow had come within a hair of knocking him out, and he could still hear a faint, ringing and roaring in his head.  Frank saw that the only way he could end the fight was to finish his unrelenting and persistent foe.  Diamond fought like an infuriated tiger. Again and again Frank's fist cracked on his face, and still he did not falter, but continued to stand up and \"take his medicine.\"  In less than a minute the Virginian was bleeding at the nose, and had received a blow in one of his eyes that was causing it to swell in a way that threatened to close it entirely.  The spectators were greatly excited, and not a few of them declared it was the most gamey fight they had ever witnessed.  The front of Diamond's shirt was stained with blood, and he presented a sorry aspect. His chest was heaving, but his uninjured eye glared with unabated fury and determination.  \"Will he never give up?\" muttered Harry Rattleton. \"He's a regular hog! The fellow doesn't know when he has enough.\"  It was true Southern grit. It was the unyielding Southern spirit--the spirit that led the soldiers of the South to make one of the pluckiest struggles known in history.  While the fellow's grit had won Frank's admiration, still Merriwell had learned that it would not do to let up. The only way out of the fight was to end it, and he set about trying to accomplish that with as little delay as possible.  Once Diamond succeeded in getting in another blow, and it left a slight swelling over one of the other lad's eyes.  But Merriwell did not seem to know that he had been hit. He soon cracked the Virginian upon the uninjured eye, and that began to swell. In a few seconds it seemed that Diamond must soon go blind.  \"Finish him, old man--finish him!\" urged Harry.  Frank was looking for the chance, but it was some time before he found it. It came at last, and his left landed on the jaw beneath Diamond's ear.  Over went the Southerner, and he lay like a log where he fell.  At a glance, it was evident to all that he was knocked out.  The boys crowded around Merriwell, eager to congratulate him, but he thrust them back, saying:  \"It's the first time in my life I ever did a thing of which I was ashamed! Look after him. I'm all right.\"  \"Say!\" exploded Harry Rattleton, \"you make me sick! Didn't you have to do it?\"  \"I suppose so.\"  \"Didn't he strike you foul twice?\"  \"He knows nothing of rules, and we were fighting by no rules, so there could be no foul.\"  \"Oh, no! If he'd soaked you with a brick you'd said it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],["title","Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#5)"],["body"," all right! I say, you make me sick! Wait till he gets a good chance to do you, and see how quick he will take it.\"  \"He'll not be to blame if he tries to get square.\"  \"Oh, go hoke your sed--I mean soak your head! I'll catch you some time when you are asleep and try to pound a little sense into you.\"  \"Well, take care of Diamond,\" ordered Merriwell. \"That last one I gave him was a beastly thump.\"  \"Let the other fellows take care of him,\" said Harry. \"We'll rub you down. You need it. Got any towels, Mr. Horner?\"  \"Guess we can find one or two,\" cheerfully answered Tad. \"Come on, Merriwell. We'll fix you up.\"  Frank followed them into the room where the captured freshmen had been confined, and there they found running water, an old iron sink, a tin wash basin, and some towels.  The visitor was stripped and given a brisk and thorough rubbing and sponging by Harry and Tad.  Bruce Browning, with his mask still over his face, came loafing in and looked the stripped freshman over with a critical eye. He inspected Frank from all sides, poked him with his fingers, felt of his arms and legs, surveyed the muscles of his back and chest, and then stood off and took him all in at a glance.  \"Humph!\" he grunted.  Frank's delicate pink skin glowed, and he looked a perfect Apollo, with a splendid head poised upon a white, shapely neck. Never had he looked handsomer in all his life than he did at that moment, stripped to the buff, his brown hair frowsled, his body glowing from the rubbing.  \"By Jove!\" cried Tad Horner, who was sometimes called Baby, \"he's a Jim Hickey--eh, old man?\"  The interrogation was directed at Browning.  \"Humph!\" grunted Bruce, and then with his hands in his pockets he loafed out of the room.  Afterward it was reported that Browning said the freshman was the finest-put-up chap he had ever seen, but he didn't want to give him the swelled head by telling him so.  By the time Merriwell was well rubbed down one of the freshmen came in and reported that Diamond had come around all right.  \"They're going to bring him in here and give him a rubbing,\" said the freshman.  Frank hastened to get into his clothes, in order that Diamond might have a chance. Rattleton had brushed the dirt and sawdust off those clothes, so they looked pretty well, and Merriwell showed no traces of what he had passed through when he stepped out of the little room.  Some of the boys were trying to induce Diamond to be rubbed down, but he objected, declaring he was going directly to his room. The blood had been washed from his face, and one or two cuts had been patched up with court-plaster, but his eyes were nearly closed, and he presented a pitiful appearance.  Frank hesitated a moment, and then he stepped up to his foe, saying in a manner most sincere:  \"Old man, I am sorry this affair took place. I had the advantage, because I have taken boxing lessons, but you made a beautiful fight. I hold no hard feelings. Let's call it quits and shake.\"  He held out his hand.  Diamond's reply was to turn his back squarely on the proffered hand.  An additional flush arose to Merriwell's cheeks, and he dropped his hand by his side, turning away without another word.  A few moments later Diamond left the building, accompanied by a single companion, and that companion was not Roland Ditson.  Ditson remained behind, and he was among those who crowded about Frank Merriwell and offered congratulations.  \"I was Diamond's second,\" said Roll, \"but I am satisfied that the best man won. He is no match for you, Merriwell. I shouldn't have been his second, only he urged me to. I was glad to see you do him up.\"  He got hold of Frank's hand and held on, but received no friendly pressure in return. When he said he was glad that Merriwell did Diamond up Frank looked incredulous.  \"As for me,\" said the victor, \"I was sorry to have to do him up.\"  Somewhere about the place Rattleton had found an old floral decoration representing a harp. He brought it forward and presented it to Frank.  \"Take it,\" he said. \"You'll need it pretty soon. Your wings must be sprouting already!\"  \"What is it?\" asked Frank.  \"Why, can't you see? It's a harp.\"  \"It looks to me like a blasted lyre,\" said Merriwell. \"You'd better give it to Ditson.\"  Then everybody but Ditson laughed.     CHAPTER VI.  A FRESH COUNCIL.   Diamond was in a wretched condition. Hunk Collins, his roommate, procured two slices of fresh beefsteak, and the Virginian had them bound over his eyes, while his face was bathed with soothing and healing lotions; but nothing could soothe his bruised and battered spirit, and Collins said he was kept awake all night by hearing Diamond grind his teeth at irregular intervals.  Even when he slept near morning the Southerner continued to grind his strong white teeth.  Collins was dropping off to sleep from sheer weariness when he awoke to find his roommate astride him and clutching him by the throat.  \"This time I'll fix you!\" mumbled Diamond, thickly. \"I'll kill you, Merriwell--I'll kill you!\"  Then he struck feeby at Collins, who rolled over and flung him off. They grappled, and it was a severe struggle before Diamond was flung down on the bed and held.  \"What in thunder is the matter with you?\" gasped Collins, whose hair was standing. \"I'm not Merriwell! Have you gone daft?\"  \"Where are we?\"  \"Why, in our room, of course. Where did you think we were?\"  \"I didn't know. I was dreaming.\"  \"Well, if you are going to be this way often, I'll have to take out a life insurance policy or quit you.\"  \"Don't mind. I'll be all right in the morning. Oh, hang the luck!\"  Then the passionate Southerner turned over with his face toward the wall. Collins smoked a cigarette to quiet his nerves, after which he got into bed once more. At intervals he could feel the bed shake, and he knew Diamond was shivering as if he had a chill.  In the morning Diamond was not all right. He was ill in bed, and it was necessary to call a physician, although he protested against it. His eyes were in wretched shape, but when the doctor questioned him, he persisted in saying he had injured them by falling downstairs.  Of course he could not appear at chapel or recitations, and he sent in an excuse.  Then Mr. Lovejoy came around to investigate.  Now, Mr. Lovejoy was most mild and lamblike in appearance, and one would have thought never in all his life had he indulged in anything that was not perfectly proper.  But appearances were deceptive in the case of Mr. Lovejoy. When a student at Yale he had made a record, but he had been fortunate, and he was never detected in anything the faculty could not approve. By those who knew him he was regarded as a terror, and by the faculty he was looked on as one of the most quiet and docile students in college.  When Cyrus Lovejoy became an instructor he did not forget the days when he had been a leader in scrapes of all sorts, and he was not inclined to be prying into the affairs of students under him. Not only that, but he could be blind to some things he accidentally discovered.  So when Mr. Lovejoy reported that John Diamond's eyes, being naturally weak, were inflamed by too close application to his studies, especially in the evening, no one thought of investigating further. The doctor, it was said, had forbidden Diamond to attempt to study for several days, and had ordered him to wear a bandage over his eyes.  Two or three evenings after the fight a party of freshmen gathered in Merriwell's room, for they were beginning to realize that Frank was likely to be a leader among them.  \"I say, fellows,\" cried Dan Dorman, who was sitting on the sill of the open window, with a cigarette clinging to his lips, \"do you know what Diamond is doing?\"  \"He's doing his best to cure those beautiful eyes of his,\" said Bandy Robinson.  \"I'm giving it to you straight that he was out to-day and went down to the nearest gun store,\" declared Dorman. \"Collins says he bought a Winchester rifle, a shotgun, two revolvers, a bowie knife, a slungshot, and a set of brass knuckles.\"  \"Wo-o-oh!\" groaned Dismal Jones. \"Why didn't he purchase a cannon and start for some battlefield?\"  \"Look out, Merry,\" laughed Ned Stover. \"He's after your scalp.\"  \"He'll have to get a bigger outfit than that before he takes it,\" declared Harry Rattleton.  \"How about it, Merry?\" asked Bandy Robinson.  \"I'll tell you, fellows,\" said Frank, who was not smoking. \"Diamond is not the fellow to give up whipped very soon. I'm dead sure to hear from him again.\"  \"He's a cad,\" growled Dismal Jones.  \"I think you fellows judge him rather harshly,\" said Frank. \"He is a Southerner, and he looks at many things differently than we do. From his standpoint he seems to be right.\"  \"Well, he'll have to get those notions out of his head if he wants to stay in college,\" airily declared Dan Dorman. \"Now, I came here with the idea of falling into the ways in vogue. Everything goes with me. That's the way to get along.\"  \"I am not so sure of that,\" Merriwell returned. \"A man must have some individuality. If you do everything everybody wants you to, it won't be long before they'll not want you to do anything.\"  \"Oh, well, what's the use to be always hanging off and getting yourself disliked?\"  \"One extreme is as bad as the other. Now, I make allowances for Diamond, and I am not inclined to believe him such a bad fellow.\"  Harry Rattleton flung a book across the room.  \"Oh, you give me the flubdubs!\" he exploded. \"Why, that fellow hates you, and he means to do you some time. Still you are soft enough to say he's not such a bad fellow! It's disgusting!\"  \"Time will tell,\" smiled Frank. \"All of you fellows must admit that he has sand.\"  \"Oh, a kind of bulldog stick-to-it-iveness,\" murmured Stover.  \"I'll tell you one thing,\" said Bandy Robinson; \"now that Diamond has not blowed, he's going to be backed by some of the leading sophs.\"  \"Eh? What makes you think so?\"  \"Oh, I've got it straight. Browning has been to see him.\"  \"No! Why, Browning is king"]]]
