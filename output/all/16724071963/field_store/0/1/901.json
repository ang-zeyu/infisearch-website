That's not torture after being obliged to inhale his breath. My kingdom for some chloroform! Will somebody please hit me on the head with a trip hammer and put me out of my misery?\"  \"Whither art thou bearing us, great chief?\" asked one of the captives.  \"We will bare you out yonder,\" answered Dismal. \"At the stake you shall stand arrayed in the garments nature provided for you.\"  \"I don't care for tea,\" murmured Browning--\"not even for repartee.\"  \"This is worse than being roasted at the stake!\" muttered a soph in a corner. \"It is severe punishment.\"  \"Help!\" cried Dismal. \"Somebody take me out! I can't get ahead of these miserable palefaces.\"  \"You'll get a head if I ever find a good chance to give it to you,\" declared the voice of Puss Parker from the darkness.  Outside the painted savages were roaring:    \"Farewell! farewell! farewell, my fairy fay!     Oh, I'm off to Louisiana     For to see my Susy Anna,   Singing 'Polly-wolly-woodle' all the day.\"  And thus the captured sophomores were borne in triumph out to East Rock, and as they were the ones who engaged the hack, they paid for their own conveyance.  Never before had anything like it happened at Yale. It was an event that was bound to go down in history as the most audacious and daring piece of work ever successfully carried through by freshmen in that college.  And Frank Merriwell was to receive the credit of being the originator of the scheme and the general who carried it out successfully.     CHAPTER VIII.  THE \"ROAST\" AT EAST ROCK.   A strange and remarkable scene was being enacted in the peaceable and civilized State of Connecticut--a scene which must have startled an accidental observer and caused him to fancy for a moment the hand of time had turned back two centuries.  Near a bright fire that was burning on the ground squatted a band of hideously-painted fellows who seemed to be redskins, while close at hand, bound and helpless, were a number of palefaces, plainly the captives of the savages.  That a council of war was taking place seemed apparent. And still the savages seemed waiting for something.  At length, out of the darkness advanced a tall, well-built warrior, the trailing plumes of whose war bonnet reached quite to the ground. If anything, this fellow was more hideously painted than any of the others, and there was an air of distinction about him that proclaimed him a great chief.  \"Ugh!\" he grunted. \"I am here.\"  The savages arose, and one of them said:  \"Fellow warriors, the mighty chief Fale-in-his-Hoce--I mean Hole-in-his-Face--has arrived.\"  Then a wild yell of greeting went up to the twinkling stars, and every savage brandished a tomahawk, scalping knife, or some other kind of weapon.  \"Brothers,\" said Hole-in-his-Face, \"I see that I am welcome in your midst, as any up-to-date country newspaper reporter would say. You have received me with great _Ã©clat_--excuse my French; I was educated abroad--in New Jersey.\"  \"Go back to Princeton!\" cried one of the captives.  \"Fellow warriors,\" continued Hole-in-his-Face, without noticing the interruption, \"I am heap much proud to be with you on this momentous occasion.\"  \"Yah! yah! yah!\" yelled the savages.  \"And now,\" the chief went on, \"if you will proceed to squat on your haunches I will orate a trifle.\"  Once more the redskins sat down on the ground, and then the late arrival struck an attitude and began his oration:  \"Warriors of my people, why are we assembled together to-night?\"  \"Because we couldn't assemble apart,\" murmured a voice.  \"We are assembled to avenge our wrongs upon the hated paleface,\" the chief declared. \"It was long ago that the proud and haughty paleface got the bulge on the red man, and we have not been in the game to any great extent since then. Every time we have held two pairs he has come in with one pair of sixes or a Winchester and raked the pot. He has not given us any kind of a show for our white alley. Whenever we seemed to be getting along fairly well and doing a little something, he has wrung in a cold deck on us and then shot us full of air holes, purely for the purpose of ventilation in case we objected. Warriors, we have grown tired of being soaked in the neck.\"  \"That's right,\" nodded a savage, \"unless we are soaked in the neck with fire water.\"  \"At last,\" shouted the orator--\"at last we have arisen in our wrath and our war paint and we are out for scalps. We have decided that the joy of the red man is fleeting. To-night a flush mantles your dark cheeks, but to-morrow it will be a bobtail flush. What have we to live for but vengeance on the white man and a little booze now and then? Nothing! Our squaws once were beautiful as the wild flowers of the prairie, but now the prize beauty of our tribe is Malt Extract Maria, whose nose is out of joint, whose eyes are skewed, whose teeth are covered with fine-cut tobacco, and who lost one of her ears last week by accidentally getting it into the mouth of her husband.  \"My brothers, we are not built to weep. It is not the way of the noble red man. A few more summers and we will be no more. We will have kicked the stuffing out of the bucket and wended our way up the golden stair. But before we cough up the ghost it behooves us to strike one last blow at the hated paleface. When we get a chance at a paleface it is our duty to do him, and do him bad. Are you on?  \"We have been successful in capturing a few of our hated foes, and they are bound and helpless near at hand. Shall they be fricasseed, broiled, fried, or made into a potpie? That is the question before the meeting, and I am ready to listen to others. Let us hear from Squint-eyed Sausageface.\"  \"It doesn't make a dit of bifference--I mean a bit of difference to me how I have my paleface cooked,\" said the one indicated as Squint-eyed Sausageface. \"Perhaps it would be well enough to cook them at the stake.\"  \"I think that would be the proper mode,\" gravely declared another warrior; \"for I have heard that they boast they are hot stuff. They should not boast in vain.\"  \"Warriors,\" said Hole-in-his-Face, \"you have heard. What have you to say?\"  \"So mote it be,\" came solemnly from one.  \"Yah! yah! yah!\" yelled the others.  \"That settles it, as the sugar remarked to the egg dropped into the coffee. Prepare the torture stakes.\"  There was a great bustle, and in a short time the stakes were prepared and driven into the ground, one of the savages hammering them down with a huge stick of wood.  Then the captives were bound to the stakes and a lot of brush was brought and piled about their feet.  Some of the sophs actually looked scared, but Browning kept up a continual fire of sarcastic remarks.  \"Ugh!\" grunted Hole-in-his-Face. \"This paleface talks heap much. Remove his outer garments, so the fire may reach his flesh without delay.\"  Then Browning was held and his clothes were stripped off till he stood in his under garments, barefooted, bareheaded, and still defiant.  \"Oh, say!\" he muttered, \"won't there be an awful hour of reckoning! Merriwell will regret the day he came to Yale!\"  At this Hole-in-his-Face laughed heartily, and Browning cried:  \"Oh, I know you, Merriwell! You can't fool me, though you have got the best makeup of them all.\"  When everything was ready, one of the savages actually touched a match to the various piles of brush about the feet of the unfortunate sophomores.  As the tiny flames leaped up the painted band joined in a wild war dance about the stakes, flourishing their weapons and whooping as if they were real Indians. Some of their postures and steps were exact imitations of the poses and steps taken by savages in a war dance.  \"Say, confound you fool freshmen!\" howled one of the captives. \"This fire is getting hot! Do you really mean to roast us?\"  \"Yah! yah! yah! Hough! hough! hough!\"  Round and round the stake circled the disguised freshmen, and the fire kept getting higher and higher.  Puss Parker fell to coughing violently, having sucked down a large quantity of smoke. Some of the others raved and some begged. But still the wild dance went on.  \"Merciful cats!\" gasped Tad Horner. \"I believe they actually mean to roast us!\"  \"Sure as fate!\" agreed another. \"They won't think to put out the fires till we are well cooked, if they do then!\"  \"This is awful!\" gurgled Parker. \"Browning, can't you do something?\"  \"Well, I hardly think so,\" confessed the king of the sophomores. \"But I will do something if I ever get out of this alive! You hear me murmur!\"  \"Say!\" cried Tad Horner. \"I can't stand this much longer. The fire is beginning to roast me.\"  \"It's getting warm,\" confessed Parker. \"But it seems to keep burning around the outside edge.\"  \"Keep cool,\" advised Browning.  \"What's that?\" yelled Horner. \"Who said 'keep cool?' Oh, say! That's too much!\"  \"Just look at the wood,\" directed the king of the sophomores. \"You will notice that all the wood about our feet is water soaked, and there's only a little dry wood out around the edges. That's all that is burning.\"  This they soon saw was true, and it gave them great relief, for it had begun to seem that the crazy freshmen actually meant to roast them.  At the very moment when the uproar was at its height there came a sudden loud cry, like a signal, and out of the darkness rushed at least twenty lads.  They were sophomores who had somehow followed them out there to East Rock, having been aroused and told of the capture of Browning and his mates by the soph who escaped.  One fellow on a bicycle had followed them till he felt sure of their destination, and then he had turned back and told the others, who hastily secured teams and flew to the rescue.  \"'Umpty-seven! 'Umpty-seven! 'Rah, 'rah! 'rah!\" yelled the rescuers as they charged upon the freshmen.  \"'Umpty-eight! 'Umpty-eight! 'Rah! 'rah! 'rah!\" howled the painted lads in return.  Then for a few moments there was a pitched battle.  The battle did not last long, for the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1112"],["title","The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (#0)"],["body","*Project Gutenberg is proud to cooperate with The World Library* in the presentation of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare for your reading for education and entertainment.

Two households, both alike in dignity,     In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,     From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,     Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.     From forth the fatal loins of these two foes     A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;     Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows     Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.     The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,     And the continuance of their parents' rage,     Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,     Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;     The which if you with patient ears attend,     What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.                                                          [Exit.]     ACT I. Scene I. Verona. A public place.  Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house of Capulet.     Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.    Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.    Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.    Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.    Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.    Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.    Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.    Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.     Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.    Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take     the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.    Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the     wall.    Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,     are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men     from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.    Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.    Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have     fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off     their heads.    Greg. The heads of the maids?    Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.     Take it in what sense thou wilt.    Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.    Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I     am a pretty piece of flesh.    Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst     been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of     Montagues.             Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].     Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.    Greg. How? turn thy back and run?    Samp. Fear me not.    Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!    Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.    Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.    Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is     disgrace to them, if they bear it.    Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?    Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.    Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?    Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?    Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.    Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my     thumb, sir.    Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?    Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.    Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as     you.    Abr. No better.    Samp. Well, sir.                          Enter Benvolio.     Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my     master's kinsmen.    Samp. Yes, better, sir.    Abr. You lie.    Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.                                                      They fight.    Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]     Put up your swords. You know not what you do.                            Enter Tybalt.     Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?     Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.    Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,     Or manage it to part these men with me.    Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word     As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.     Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.       Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or                           partisans.     Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!    Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!             Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.     Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!    Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?    Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come     And flourishes his blade in spite of me.                   Enter Old Montague and his Wife.     Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.    M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.                  Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.     Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,     Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-     Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,     That quench the fire of your pernicious rage     With purple fountains issuing from your veins!     On pain of torture, from those bloody hands     Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground     And hear the sentence of your moved prince.     Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word     By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,     Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets     And made Verona's ancient citizens     Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments     To wield old partisans, in hands as old,     Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.     If ever you disturb our streets again,     Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.     For this time all the rest depart away.     You, Capulet, shall go along with me;     And, Montague, come you this afternoon,     To know our farther pleasure in this case,     To old Freetown, our common judgment place.     Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.               Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].    Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?     Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?    Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary     And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.     I drew to part them. In the instant came     The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;     Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,     He swung about his head and cut the winds,     Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.     While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,     Came more and more, and fought on part and part,     Till the Prince came, who parted either part.    M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?     Right glad I am he was not at this fray.    Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun     Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,     A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;     Where, underneath the grove of sycamore     That westward rooteth from the city's side,     So early walking did I see your son.     Towards him I made; but he was ware of me     And stole into the covert of the wood.     I- measuring his affections by my own,     Which then most sought where most might not be found,     Being one too many by my weary self-     Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,     And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.    Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,     With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,     Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;     But all so soon as the all-cheering sun     Should in the furthest East bean to draw     The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,     Away from light steals home my heavy son     And private in his chamber pens himself,     Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight     And makes himself an artificial night.     Black and portentous must this humour prove     Unless good counsel may the cause remove.    Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?    Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him    Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?    Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;     But he, his own affections' counsellor,     Is to himself- I will not say how true-     But to himself so secret and so close,     So far "]]]
