The Greeks, on the other hand, pronounce the letter B as though       it were V.)        A strange thing happened to the Volgars or Bulgars. They       completely gave up their Asiatic language and adopted a new one,       which became in time the purest of the Slavic tongues. They       intermarried with the Slavs around them and adopted Slavic names.       They founded a flourishing nation which lay between the kingdom       of Serbia and the Greek Empire of Constantinople.        North of the Bulgars lay the country of the Roumani (ro͞o       mä′nï). These people claimed to be descended from the Roman       Emperor’s colonists, as was previously told, but the reason their       language is so much like the Italian is that a large number of       people from the north of Italy moved into the country nearly a       thousand years after the first Roman colonists settled there.       From 900 to 1300 A.D., south-eastern Europe was inhabited by       Serbians, Bulgarians, Roumanians, and Greeks.  [Illustration: A Typical Bulgarian Family]        A fifth people perhaps ought to be counted here, the Albanians.       (See map) This tribe is descended from the Illyrians, who       inhabited the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea even before the       time of the Roman Empire. Their language, like the Greek, is a       branch of the Indo-European family which is neither Latin,       Celtic, Germanic, nor Slavic. They are distant cousins of the       Italians and are also slightly related to the Greeks. They are a       wild, fierce, uncivilized people, and have never known the       meaning of law and order. Robbery and warfare are common. Each       village is always fighting with the people of the neighboring       towns. The Albanians, or Skipetars (skïp′ĕtars) as they call       themselves, were Christians until they were conquered by the       Turks about 1460. Since that time, the great majority of them       have been staunch believers in the Mohammedan religion.           Questions for Review             Where did the great Indo-European family of languages have           its beginning?            Why is it that the Celtic languages are dying out?            What killed the Celtic languages in Spain and France?            What are the three parts of Europe where Germanic languages           are spoken?            In what parts of Europe are languages spoken which are           descended from the Latin?            Explain the presence in Austria-Hungary of eleven different           peoples?            Are the Bulgarians really a Slavic people?     Chapter VI. “The Terrible Turk”        The Greek Empire at Constantinople.—The invading Mohammedans.—The       Ottoman Turks.—The fall of Constantinople.—The enslaving of the       Bulgars, Serbs, Greeks, Albanians, and Roumanians.—One little       part of Serbia unconquered.—The further conquests of the       Turks.—The attack on Vienna.—John Sobieski to the rescue.—The       waning of the Turkish empire.—The Spanish Jews.—The jumble of       languages and peoples in southeastern Europe.         In the last chapter, we referred briefly to the Greek empire at       Constantinople. This city was originally called Byzantium, and       was a flourishing Greek commercial center six hundred years       before Christ. Eleven hundred years after this, a Roman emperor       named Constantine decided that he liked Byzantium better than       Rome. Accordingly, he moved the capital of the empire to the       Greek city, and renamed it Constantinopolis (the word _polis_       means “city” in Greek). Before long, we find the Roman empire       divided into two parts, the capital of one at Rome, of the other       at Constantinople. This eastern government was continued by the       Greeks nearly one thousand years after the government of the       western empire had been seized by the invading Germanic tribes.  [Illustration: The Turkish Sultan before Constantinople]        For years, this Greek empire at Constantinople had been obliged       to fight hard against the Mohammedans who came swarming across       the fertile plains of Mesopotamia (mĕs′ō pō tā′ mĭ ā) and       Asia Minor. (Mesopotamia is the district lying between the Tigris       (tī′grĭs) and Euphrates (ūfrā′tēz) Rivers. Its name in Greek       means “between the rivers.”) The fiercest of the Mohammedan       tribes, the warlike Ottoman Turks, were the last to arrive. For       several years, they thundered at the gates of Constantinople,       while the Greek Empire grew feebler and feebler.        At last in 1453, their great cannon made a breach in the walls,       and the Turks poured through. The Greek Empire was a thing of the       past, and all of southeastern Europe lay at the mercy of the       invading Moslems (another name for “Mohammedans”). The Turks did       not drive out the Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbians, and Albanians,       but settled down among them as the ruling, military class. They       strove to force these peoples to give up Christianity and turn       Mohammedans, but were successful only in the case of the       Skipetars of Albania. The Albanians, Serbians, Bulgarians,       Greeks, and Roumanians remained where they had been, but were       oppressed by the newcomers.        For more than two hundred years after the capture of       Constantinople, the Turks pushed their conquests farther and       farther into Europe. The entire coast of the Black Sea fell into       their hands. All of Greece, all of Bulgaria, and all of Roumania       became part of their empire. Of the kingdom of Serbia, one small       province remained unconquered. Up in the mountains near the coast       of the Adriatic gathered the people of one county of the Serbian       kingdom. As the Turks attacked them, they retreated higher and       higher up the mountain sides and rolled huge stones down upon the       invaders. Finally, the Turk became disgusted, and concluded that       “the game was not worth the candle.” Thus the little nation of       Montenegro was formed, composed of Serbians who never submitted       to the Ottoman rule. (The inhabitants of this small country call       it Tzernagorah (tzẽr nä gō′ra); the Italians call it       Montenegro. Both of these names mean “Dark Mountain.”)        Not satisfied with these conquests, the Turks pushed on, gaining       control of the greater part of the kingdom of Hungary. About       1682, they were pounding at the forts around Vienna. The heroic       king of Poland, John Sobieski (sō bĭ ĕs′kĭ), came to the       rescue of the Austrian emperor with an army of Poles and Germans       and completely defeated the Turks. He saved Vienna, and ended any       further advance of the Turkish rule into Europe. (The map on page       82 shows the high water mark of the Turkish conquests.)        It must be remembered that the original inhabitants of the       conquered lands were still living where they always had lived.       The Turks were very few in number compared with the millions of       people who inhabited their empire and paid them tribute. Many       wars were caused by this conquest, but it was two hundred and       thirty years before the Christian peoples won back their       territory.  [Illustration: Southeastern Europe 1690 A.D.]        By the year 1685, the Hungarians had begun to win back part of       their kingdom. By 1698, almost all of Hungary and Transylvania       was free from Turkish rule. It will be recalled that a certain       Count of Hapsburg had become Emperor of Germany, and when we say       Germany, we include Austria, which had become the home of the       Hapsburgs. It was shortly after this that the Hapsburg family       came to be lords of Hungary also, through the marriage of one of       their emperors with the only daughter of the king of that       country. (See page 69.)        In this way, when the province of Bukowina and the territory       known as the Banat, just north of the Danube and west of what is       now Roumania, were reconquered from the Turks, it was the joint       kingdom to which they were attached. (Bukowina has never been a       part of Hungary. It is still a crown land, or county subject to       the emperor of Austria personally.)        During the 15th century, the southeastern part of Europe came to       be inhabited by a still different people. Not long after       Ferdinand and Isabella, the king and queen of Spain, had       conquered the Moorish kingdom of Granada (see Chapter II) that       used to stretch across the southern half of Spain, the Spaniards       decided to drive out of their country all “unbelievers,” that is,       all who were not Christians of the Catholic faith. (This happened       in 1492, the same year that they sent Columbus to America.) The       Moors retreated into Africa, which was their former home, but the       millions of Spanish Jews had no homeland to which to return. In       the midst of their distress, the Sultan of Turkey, knowing them       to be prosperous and well-behaved citizens, invited them to enter       his land. They did so by hundreds of thousands.        The descendants of these people are to be found today throughout       the Balkan peninsula, though mainly in the large cities. They are       so numerous in Constantinople that four newspapers are published       there in the Spanish language, but printed in Hebrew characters.       The city of Salonika, a prosperous seaport of 140,000 people,       which used to belong to Turkey but now is part of Greece, has       over 50,000 of these Jews. They readily learn other tongues, and       many of them can talk in four or five languages besides their       native Spanish, which they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11203"],["title","Narrative of a Survey of the Intertropical and Western Coasts of Australia (#0)"],["body","OF A SURVEY  OF THE  INTERTROPICAL AND WESTERN  COASTS OF AUSTRALIA.  PERFORMED BETWEEN  THE YEARS 1818 AND 1822.  BY  CAPTAIN PHILLIP P. KING, R.N., F.R.S., F.L.S.,  AND MEMBER OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY OF LONDON.  WITH AN APPENDIX, CONTAINING VARIOUS SUBJECTS RELATING TO HYDROGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.   IN TWO VOLUMES, ILLUSTRATED BY PLATES, CHARTS, AND WOOD-CUTS.  VOLUME 1.    PREFACE.  THE rapidly-increasing importance to which the English Colonies in Australia have now arrived, rendering every subject connected with that extensive continent of the greatest interest, whether in respect to its geography, or the extraordinary assemblage of its animal and vegetable productions, has induced me to publish such parts of my Journal as may be useful to accompany the Atlas of the Charts of the Coast recently published by the Board of Admiralty.  One of the results of this voyage has been the occupation of Port Cockburn, between Melville and Bathurst Islands on the North Coast, and the formation of an establishment there which cannot fail to be productive of the greatest benefit to our mercantile communications with the Eastern Archipelago, as well as to increase the influence and power of the mother country in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans; and in contemplating this new extension of her possessions*, I cannot avoid recalling to mind a curious and prophetic remark of Burton, who, in alluding to the discoveries of the Spanish navigator Ferdinando de Quiros (Anno 1612), says: \"I would know whether that hungry Spaniard's discovery of Terra Australis Incognita, or Magellanica, be as true as that of Mercurius Britannicus, or his of Utopia, or his of Lucinia. And yet, in likelihood, it may be so; for without all question, it being extended from the tropick of Capricorn to the circle Antarctick, and lying as it doth in the temperate zone, cannot chuse but yeeld in time some flourishing kingdoms to succeeding ages, as America did unto the Spaniards.\"** Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, Part 2 Section 2 Number 3.  (*Footnote. The distance between Melville Island and Hobart Town in Van Diemen's Land, the former being the most northern, and the latter the most southern, establishment under the government of New South Wales, is more than 2700 miles, and comprises an extent of coast nearly equal to that of the British possessions in India!)  (**Footnote. Since the land that Quiros discovered and called Terra del Espiritu Santo was, at the time Burton wrote, considered to be the Eastern Coast of New Holland, I am justified in the use I have made of the above curious passage.)  Since the return of the Expedition, my time has been occupied in arranging the narrative, and divesting it of such parts as were neither calculated to amuse the general reader, nor to give information to the navigator; but this has been so much impeded by the more important employment of constructing the Charts of the Survey, as to defer until the present season the publication of the events of a voyage that was completed nearly three years ago.  In addition to the Hydrographical Notices in the Appendix, I have ventured to insert descriptive catalogues of the few subjects of Natural History that were collected during the voyage; these were supplied by some friends, to whom I have in another part of the work endeavoured, inadequately no doubt, to express my sense of the obligation: but since that part has been printed, my friend Mr. Brown has submitted some specimens of the rocks of the western side of the Gulf of Carpentaria, that were collected by him on the Investigator's voyage, to the inspection of Doctor Fitton, by which means that gentleman's valuable communication in the Appendix has been most materially improved. I have, therefore, taken the present opportunity of acknowledging the readiness with which this additional information has been supplied, and of offering Mr. Brown my best thanks.  It now only remains for me to add, that the views with which these volumes are illustrated were engraved by Mr. Finden from my own sketches on the spot: the charts, which are reductions of those in the Admiralty Atlas, were engraved by Mr. Walker; and the three plates of Natural History by Mr. Curtis, from drawings made from the specimens by himself, by Henry C. Field, Esquire, and by Miss M. Field; to each of whom I take this opportunity of returning my best thanks, and also of bearing testimony to the correctness with which the respective subjects have been represented.
