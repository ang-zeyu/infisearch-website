By eleven o'clock the bridge was complete.  Osterhaus was up, and after some sharp skirmishing the enemy was driven away with considerable loss in killed and captured.  While the operations at the bridge were progressing, Geary was pushing up the hill over great obstacles, resisted by the enemy directly in his front, and in face of the guns on top of the mountain.  The enemy, seeing their left flank and rear menaced, gave way, and were followed by Cruft and Osterhaus.  Soon these were up abreast of Geary, and the whole command pushed up the hill, driving the enemy in advance.  By noon Geary had gained the open ground on the north slope of the mountain, with his right close up to the base of the upper palisade, but there were strong fortifications in his front.  The rest of the command coming up, a line was formed from the base of the upper palisade to the mouth of Chattanooga Creek.  Thomas and I were on the top of Orchard Knob.  Hooker's advance now made our line a continuous one.  It was in full view, extending from the Tennessee River, where Sherman had crossed, up Chickamauga River to the base of Mission Ridge, over the top of the north end of the ridge to Chattanooga Valley, then along parallel to the ridge a mile or more, across the valley to the mouth of Chattanooga Creek, thence up the slope of Lookout Mountain to the foot of the upper palisade.  The day was hazy, so that Hooker's operations were not visible to us except at moments when the clouds would rise.  But the sound of his artillery and musketry was heard incessantly.  The enemy on his front was partially fortified, but was soon driven out of his works.  During the afternoon the clouds, which had so obscured the top of Lookout all day as to hide whatever was going on from the view of those below, settled down and made it so dark where Hooker was as to stop operations for the time.  At four o'clock Hooker reported his position as impregnable.  By a little after five direct communication was established, and a brigade of troops was sent from Chattanooga to reinforce him.  These troops had to cross Chattanooga Creek and met with some opposition, but soon overcame it, and by night the commander, General Carlin, reported to Hooker and was assigned to his left.  I now telegraphed to Washington:  \"The fight to-day progressed favorably.  Sherman carried the end of Missionary Ridge, and his right is now at the tunnel, and his left at Chickamauga Creek. Troops from Lookout Valley carried the point of the mountain, and now hold the eastern slope and a point high up.  Hooker reports two thousand prisoners taken, besides which a small number have fallen into our hands from Missionary Ridge.\"  The next day the President replied: \"Your dispatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here.  Well done. Many thanks to all.  Remember Burnside.\"  And Halleck also telegraphed: \"I congratulate you on the success thus far of your plans. I fear that Burnside is hard pushed, and that any further delay may prove fatal.  I know you will do all in your power to relieve him.\"  The division of Jefferson C. Davis, Army of the Cumberland, had been sent to the North Chickamauga to guard the pontoons as they were deposited in the river, and to prevent all ingress or egress of citizens.  On the night of the 24th his division, having crossed with Sherman, occupied our extreme left from the upper bridge over the plain to the north base of Missionary Ridge. Firing continued to a late hour in the night, but it was not connected with an assault at any point.    CHAPTER XLIV.  BATTLE OF CHATTANOOGA--A GALLANT CHARGE--COMPLETE ROUT OF THE ENEMY --PURSUIT OF THE CONFEDERATES--GENERAL BRAGG--REMARKS ON CHATTANOOGA.  At twelve o'clock at night, when all was quiet, I began to give orders for the next day, and sent a dispatch to Willcox to encourage Burnside. Sherman was directed to attack at daylight.  Hooker was ordered to move at the same hour, and endeavor to intercept the enemy's retreat if he still remained; if he had gone, then to move directly to Rossville and operate against the left and rear of the force on Missionary Ridge. Thomas was not to move until Hooker had reached Missionary Ridge.  As I was with him on Orchard Knob, he would not move without further orders from me.  The morning of the 25th opened clear and bright, and the whole field was in full view from the top of Orchard Knob.  It remained so all day. Bragg's headquarters were in full view, and officers--presumably staff officers--could be seen coming and going constantly.  The point of ground which Sherman had carried on the 24th was almost disconnected from the main ridge occupied by the enemy. A low pass, over which there is a wagon road crossing the hill, and near which there is a railroad tunnel, intervenes between the two hills.  The problem now was to get to the main ridge. The enemy was fortified on the point; and back farther, where the ground was still higher, was a second fortification commanding the first.  Sherman was out as soon as it was light enough to see, and by sunrise his command was in motion.  Three brigades held the hill already gained.  Morgan L. Smith moved along the east base of Missionary Ridge; Loomis along the west base, supported by two brigades of John E. Smith's division; and Corse with his brigade was between the two, moving directly towards the hill to be captured.  The ridge is steep and heavily wooded on the east side, where M. L. Smith's troops were advancing, but cleared and with a more gentle slope on the west side.  The troops advanced rapidly and carried the extreme end of the rebel works.  Morgan L. Smith advanced to a point which cut the enemy off from the railroad bridge and the means of bringing up supplies by rail from Chickamauga Station, where the main depot was located.  The enemy made brave and strenuous efforts to drive our troops from the position we had gained, but without success.  The contest lasted for two hours.  Corse, a brave and efficient commander, was badly wounded in this assault.  Sherman now threatened both Bragg's flank and his stores, and made it necessary for him to weaken other points of his line to strengthen his right.  From the position I occupied I could see column after column of Bragg's forces moving against Sherman.  Every Confederate gun that could be brought to bear upon the Union forces was concentrated upon him.  J. E. Smith, with two brigades, charged up the west side of the ridge to the support of Corse's command, over open ground and in the face of a heavy fire of both artillery and musketry, and reached the very parapet of the enemy.  He lay here for a time, but the enemy coming with a heavy force upon his right flank, he was compelled to fall back, followed by the foe.  A few hundred yards brought Smith's troops into a wood, where they were speedily reformed, when they charged and drove the attacking party back to his intrenchments.  Seeing the advance, repulse, and second advance of J. E. Smith from the position I occupied, I directed Thomas to send a division to reinforce him.  Baird's division was accordingly sent from the right of Orchard Knob.  It had to march a considerable distance directly under the eye of the enemy to reach its position.  Bragg at once commenced massing in the same direction.  This was what I wanted.  But it had now got to be late in the afternoon, and I had expected before this to see Hooker crossing the ridge in the neighborhood of Rossville and compelling Bragg to mass in that direction also.  The enemy had evacuated Lookout Mountain during the night, as I expected he would.  In crossing the valley he burned the bridge over Chattanooga Creek, and did all he could to obstruct the roads behind him.  Hooker was off bright and early, with no obstructions in his front but distance and the destruction above named.  He was detained four hours crossing Chattanooga Creek, and thus was lost the immediate advantage I expected from his forces.  His reaching Bragg's flank and extending across it was to be the signal for Thomas's assault of the ridge.  But Sherman's condition was getting so critical that the assault for his relief could not be delayed any longer.  Sheridan's and Wood's divisions had been lying under arms from early morning, ready to move the instant the signal was given. I now directed Thomas to order the charge at once (*16). I watched eagerly to see the effect, and became impatient at last that there was no indication of any charge being made.  The centre of the line which was to make the charge was near where Thomas and I stood, but concealed from view by an intervening forest.  Turning to Thomas to inquire what caused the delay, I was surprised to see Thomas J. Wood, one of the division commanders who was to make the charge, standing talking to him.  I spoke to General Wood, asking him why he did not charge as ordered an hour before.  He replied very promptly that this was the first he had heard of it, but that he had been ready all day to move at a moment's notice.  I told him to make the charge at once.  He was off in a moment, and in an incredibly short time loud cheering was heard, and he and Sheridan were driving the enemy's advance before them towards Missionary Ridge.  The Confederates were strongly intrenched on the crest of the ridge in front of us, and had a second line half-way down and another at the base. Our men drove the troops in front of the lower line of rifle-pits so rapidly, and followed them so closely, that rebel and Union troops went over the first line of works almost at the same time.  Many rebels were captured and sent to the rear under the fire of their own friends higher up the hill.  Those that were not captured retreated, and were pursued. The retreating hordes being between friends and pursuers caused the enemy to fire high to avoid killing their own men.  In fact, on that occasion the Union soldier"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1068"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant — Volume 2 (#8)"],["body","the enemy was in the safest position. Without awaiting further orders or stopping to reform, on our troops went to the second line of works; over that and on for the crest--thus effectually carrying out my orders of the 18th for the battle and of the 24th (*17) for this charge.  I watched their progress with intense interest.  The fire along the rebel line was terrific.  Cannon and musket balls filled the air:  but the damage done was in small proportion to the ammunition expended.  The pursuit continued until the crest was reached, and soon our men were seen climbing over the Confederate barriers at different points in front of both Sheridan's and Wood's divisions.  The retreat of the enemy along most of his line was precipitate and the panic so great that Bragg and his officers lost all control over their men.  Many were captured, and thousands threw away their arms in their flight.  Sheridan pushed forward until he reached the Chickamauga River at a point above where the enemy crossed.  He met some resistance from troops occupying a second hill in rear of Missionary Ridge, probably to cover the retreat of the main body and of the artillery and trains.  It was now getting dark, but Sheridan, without halting on that account pushed his men forward up this second hill slowly and without attracting the attention of the men placed to defend it, while he detached to the right and left to surround the position.  The enemy discovered the movement before these dispositions were complete, and beat a hasty retreat, leaving artillery, wagon trains, and many prisoners in our hands.  To Sheridan's prompt movement the Army of the Cumberland, and the nation, are indebted for the bulk of the capture of prisoners, artillery, and small-arms that day. Except for his prompt pursuit, so much in this way would not have been accomplished.  While the advance up Mission Ridge was going forward, General Thomas with staff, General Gordon Granger, commander of the corps making the assault, and myself and staff occupied Orchard Knob, from which the entire field could be observed.  The moment the troops were seen going over the last line of rebel defences, I ordered Granger to join his command, and mounting my horse I rode to the front.  General Thomas left about the same time. Sheridan on the extreme right was already in pursuit of the enemy east of the ridge.  Wood, who commanded the division to the left of Sheridan, accompanied his men on horseback in the charge, but did not join Sheridan in the pursuit.  To the left, in Baird's front where Bragg's troops had massed against Sherman, the resistance was more stubborn and the contest lasted longer.  I ordered Granger to follow the enemy with Wood's division, but he was so much excited, and kept up such a roar of musketry in the direction the enemy had taken, that by the time I could stop the firing the enemy had got well out of the way.  The enemy confronting Sherman, now seeing everything to their left giving way, fled also.  Sherman, however, was not aware of the extent of our success until after nightfall, when he received orders to pursue at daylight in the morning.  As soon as Sherman discovered that the enemy had left his front he directed his reserves, Davis's division of the Army of the Cumberland, to push over the pontoon-bridge at the mouth of the Chickamauga, and to move forward to Chickamauga Station.  He ordered Howard to move up the stream some two miles to where there was an old bridge, repair it during the night, and follow Davis at four o'clock in the morning.  Morgan L. Smith was ordered to reconnoitre the tunnel to see if that was still held.  Nothing was found there but dead bodies of men of both armies. The rest of Sherman's command was directed to follow Howard at daylight in the morning to get on to the railroad towards Graysville.  Hooker, as stated, was detained at Chattanooga Creek by the destruction of the bridge at that point.  He got his troops over, with the exception of the artillery, by fording the stream at a little after three o'clock. Leaving his artillery to follow when the bridge should be reconstructed, he pushed on with the remainder of his command.  At Rossville he came upon the flank of a division of the enemy, which soon commenced a retreat along the ridge.  This threw them on Palmer.  They could make but little resistance in the position they were caught in, and as many of them as could do so escaped.  Many, however, were captured.  Hooker's position during the night of the 25th was near Rossville, extending east of the ridge.  Palmer was on his left, on the road to Graysville.  During the night I telegraphed to Willcox that Bragg had been defeated, and that immediate relief would be sent to Burnside if he could hold out; to Halleck I sent an announcement of our victory, and informed him that forces would be sent up the valley to relieve Burnside.  Before the battle of Chattanooga opened I had taken measures for the relief of Burnside the moment the way should be clear. Thomas was directed to have the little steamer that had been built at Chattanooga loaded to its capacity with rations and ammunition.  Granger's corps was to move by the south bank of the Tennessee River to the mouth of the Holston, and up that to Knoxville accompanied by the boat.  In addition to the supplies transported by boat, the men were to carry forty rounds of ammunition in their cartridge-boxes, and four days' rations in haversacks.  In the battle of Chattanooga, troops from the Army of the Potomac, from the Army of the Tennessee, and from the Army of the Cumberland participated.  In fact, the accidents growing out of the heavy rains and the sudden rise in the Tennessee River so mingled the troops that the organizations were not kept together, under their respective commanders, during the battle.  Hooker, on the right, had Geary's division of the 12th corps, Army of the Potomac; Osterhaus's division of the 15th corps, Army of the Tennessee; and Cruft's division of the Army of the Cumberland.  Sherman had three divisions of his own army, Howard's corps from the Army of the Potomac, and Jefferson C. Davis's division of the Army of the Cumberland.  There was no jealousy--hardly rivalry.  Indeed, I doubt whether officers or men took any note at the time of the fact of this intermingling of commands.  All saw a defiant foe surrounding them, and took it for granted that every move was intended to dislodge him, and it made no difference where the troops came from so that the end was accomplished.  The victory at Chattanooga was won against great odds, considering the advantage the enemy had of position, and was accomplished more easily than was expected by reason of Bragg's making several grave mistakes: first, in sending away his ablest corps commander with over twenty thousand troops; second, in sending away a division of troops on the eve of battle; third, in placing so much of a force on the plain in front of his impregnable position.  It was known that Mr. Jefferson Davis had visited Bragg on Missionary Ridge a short time before my reaching Chattanooga. It was reported and believed that he had come out to reconcile a serious difference between Bragg and Longstreet, and finding this difficult to do, planned the campaign against Knoxville, to be conducted by the latter general.  I had known both Bragg and Longstreet before the war, the latter very well.  We had been three years at West Point together, and, after my graduation, for a time in the same regiment.  Then we served together in the Mexican War.  I had known Bragg in Mexico, and met him occasionally subsequently.  I could well understand how there might be an irreconcilable difference between them.  Bragg was a remarkably intelligent and well-informed man, professionally and otherwise.  He was also thoroughly upright. But he was possessed of an irascible temper, and was naturally disputatious.  A man of the highest moral character and the most correct habits, yet in the old army he was in frequent trouble. As a subordinate he was always on the lookout to catch his commanding officer infringing his prerogatives; as a post commander he was equally vigilant to detect the slightest neglect, even of the most trivial order.  I have heard in the old army an anecdote very characteristic of Bragg. On one occasion, when stationed at a post of several companies commanded by a field officer, he was himself commanding one of the companies and at the same time acting as post quartermaster and commissary.  He was first lieutenant at the time, but his captain was detached on other duty.  As commander of the company he made a requisition upon the quartermaster--himself--for something he wanted.  As quartermaster he declined to fill the requisition, and endorsed on the back of it his reasons for so doing.  As company commander he responded to this, urging that his requisition called for nothing but what he was entitled to, and that it was the duty of the quartermaster to fill it.  As quartermaster he still persisted that he was right.  In this condition of affairs Bragg referred the whole matter to the commanding officer of the post. The latter, when he saw the nature of the matter referred, exclaimed: \"My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarrelled with every officer in the army, and now you are quarrelling with yourself!\"  Longstreet was an entirely different man.  He was brave, honest, intelligent, a very capable soldier, subordinate to his superiors, just and kind to his subordinates, but jealous of his own rights, which he had the courage to maintain.  He was never on the lookout to detect a slight, but saw one as soon as anybody when intentionally given.  It may be that Longstreet was not sent to Knoxville for the reason stated, but because Mr. Davis had an exalted opinion of his own military genius, and thought he saw a chance of \"killing two birds with one stone.\"  On several occasions during the war he came to the relief of the"]]]
