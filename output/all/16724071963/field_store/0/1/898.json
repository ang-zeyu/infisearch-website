A moment later the masked youths began to howl and blow horns. A door opened, and Diamond, blindfolded and bound, was led into the room.  The young Virginian stood up haughtily, and he was seen to strain and struggle in an effort to free his hands.  \"I protest against this outrage!\" he cried, angrily. \"I want you to know that my father--\"  The horns and the shouts drowned his words. He was forced to mount the steps to a high platform, and an instant later he found himself shooting down a slippery incline of planed and greased boards.  The racket stopped as Diamond scooted down the slippery surface. He dropped sprawling into the vat of icy water. Several hands caught hold of him, yanked him up, and thrust him down again.  \"Oh, somebody shall suffer for this!\" gurgled the helpless freshman, spluttering water from his mouth.  He was dragged out of the vat, and then he was forced to endure all the hustling, and thumping, and banging which Frank Merriwell had passed through. His protests seemed to fall on deaf ears.  It had been reported that Diamond had declared that the sophomores would not dare to haze him, as his father would make it hot for them if they did. The report was remembered, and he was used more severely than Frank had been.  Hazing at Yale was said to be a thing of the past, but Frank saw it was still carried on secretly.  \"Make a speech, fresh!\" shouted a voice.  \"Speech! speech!\" yelled the masked lads.  Diamond was placed on a low table.  For a moment he hesitated, and then he fancied he saw his opportunity to make a protest that would be heard.  \"I will make a speech,\" he declared. \"I'll tell you young ruffians what I think of you and what--\"  Swish! a sponge that was dripping with dirty water struck him square in the mouth. Some of the water went down his throat, and he choked and strangled.  The table was jerked from beneath his feet, and he fell into the waiting arms of the masked sophomores.  \"He called us ruffians! Give it to him!\"  Then the unfortunate freshman was used worse than ever. He was tossed in a blanket, given a powerful shock of electricity, deafened by the horns, pounded with the stuffed clubs, and hustled till there was scarcely any breath left in his body.  Then the bandage was torn from Diamond's eyes and he was confronted by the guillotine, over which fresh red ink had been liberally spattered. The blade of the huge knife was dripping in a gory manner, and it really looked as if it had just completed a deadly piece of work.  Despite himself, the young Virginian shivered when his eyes rested on the apparently blood-stained blade.  \"Be careful!\" some one distinctly whispered. \"We do not want to kill more than one freshman in a night.\"  Some one else spoke of the frightful manner in which the knife had cut Merriwell, and then, despite his feeble struggles, Diamond was placed upon the instrument of torture.  \"The other fresh died game,\" muttered the executioner. \"Of course we didn't mean to kill him, but the knife is out of order and it slipped by accident. We haven't time to fix it properly, but there are only about nine chances out of ten that it will fall again.\"  \"Oh, you fellows shall pay for this!\" feebly gasped Diamond.  Despite himself, although he knew how unlikely such a thing was, he could not help wondering if a terrible accident had really happened. If not, where was Merriwell. He looked around, but saw nothing of Frank, who was keeping in the background.  And then, when his nerves had been quite unstrung, the knife fell, the ice and warm water were applied, and Diamond could not choke back the cry of horror that forced itself from his lips.  A roar of laughter broke from the masked students.  When Diamond was lifted to his feet he was almost too weak to stand. He clinched his teeth, vowing over and over to himself that he would find a way to square accounts.  \"If it takes me a year, I'll find out who the leaders in this affair are, and they shall suffer for it!\" he thought.  \"Give him a chance to see the others put through the mill,\" said Mephisto, and Diamond's hands were released.  The Virginian looked around, seeming irresolute for a moment. Not far away he saw a masked lad whose clothes were wet and bedaubed with dirt and sawdust.  In an instant Diamond sprang toward this person and snatched the mask from his face.  \"It's Merriwell!\" he triumphantly shouted, \"and he has helped to haze me! His career at Yale will be suddenly cut short!\"     CHAPTER III.  THE BLOW.   There was a sudden hush. The students saw that Diamond was really revengeful, and his words seemed to indicate that he intended to report any one whose identity he discovered.  The Virginian was pale and he trembled with anger.  \"You don't mean to say that you will blow, do you?\" asked one.  \"That's exactly what I do mean, sir!\" came resolutely from the lips of the infuriated freshman. \"I am a gentleman and the son of a gentleman, and I'll never stand it to be treated like a cur. Hazing is said to be no longer tolerated here, and an investigation is certain to follow my report of this affair.\"  A little fellow stepped out.  \"You claim to be a gentleman,\" he said, distinctly, \"but you will prove yourself a cad if you peach.\"  \"I had rather be a cad than a ruffian, sir!\"  \"If you were a gentleman you would take your medicine like a gentleman. You'd never squeal.\"  \"You fellows are the ones who are squealing now, for you see you have been imposing on the wrong man.\"  \"Man!\" shot back the little fellow, contemptuously. \"There's not much man about a chap that blows when he is hazed a little.\"  \"A little! a little! Is this what you call a little?\"  \"Oh, this is nothing. Think of what the poor freshies used to go through in the old days of Delta Kappa and Signa Epsilon. Why, sometimes a fellow would be roasted so his skin would smell like burned steak for a week.\"  \"That was when he was burned at the stake,\" said a chap in the background, and there was a universal dismal groan.  \"This is some of the Delta Kappa machinery here,\" the little fellow explained. \"Sometimes some of the fellows come here to have a cold bot and hot lob. You freshies walked right in on us to-night, and we gave you a pleasant reception. Now, if you blow I'll guarantee you'll never become a soph. The fellows will do you, and do you dirty, before your first year is up.\"  \"Such threats do not frighten me,\" haughtily flung back the lad from Virginia. \"I know this was a put-up job, and Bruce Browning was in it. He got us to come here. Frank Merriwell knew something about it, or he'd never been so ready to come. And I know you, too, Tad Horner.\"  The little fellow fell back a step, and then, with a sudden angry impulse, he tore off his mask, showing a flushed, chubby, boyish face, from which a pair of great blue eyes flashed at Diamond.  \"Well, I am Tad Horner!\" he cried, \"and I'm not ashamed of it! If you want to throw me down, go ahead. It will be a low, dirty trick, and will show the kind of big stuff you are!\"  The masked lads were surprised, for Tad had never exhibited such spirit before. He had always seemed like a mild, shy, mother-boy sort of chap. He had been hazed and had cried; but he wouldn't beg and he never squealed. After that Browning had taken him under his wing, had fought his battles, and had stood by him through the freshman year. Anybody who was looking for trouble could find it by imposing on Horner; and Browning, for all of his laziness, could fight like a tiger when he was aroused.  Some of the students clapped their hands in approbation of Tad's plain words, and there was a general stir. One fellow proposed that everybody unmask, so that all would be on a level with Horner, but the little fellow quickly cried:  \"Don't do it! You'd all be spotted, and the faculty would know who to investigate if anything should happen to Diamond. If I'm fired, I want you fellows to settle with him for me.\"  \"We'll do it--we'll do it, Tad!\" cried more than twenty voices.  Diamond showed his white, even teeth and laughed shortly.  \"Perhaps you think that will scare me,\" he sneered. \"If so, you will find I am not bluffed so easily.\"  \"We are not trying to scare you,\" declared another of the masked students, \"but you'll find we are in earnest if you blow.\"  \"Well, you will find I am in earnest, and I do not care for you all.\"  The boys began to despair, for they saw that Diamond was determined and obstinate, and it would be no easy thing to induce him to abandon his intention of reporting the hazing. If he did so, Browning and Horner would find themselves in deep trouble, and others might become involved during the investigation. It was not probable that the consequences would be serious for Merriwell, who would be able to prove his innocence in the matter.  What could be done?  The boys fell to discussing the matter in little groups, and not a few expressed regret that Tad Horner had unmasked, as an alibi could have been arranged for him if he had not done so. Now he would be too proud to permit them to try anything of the sort, and he would tell the truth about his connection with the affair if the truth were demanded of him.  \"We're in a bad box,\" said one fellow in one of the little groups. \"Diamond is mad enough to do as he threatens.\"  \"Sure,\" nodded another. \"And that breaks up this joint. No more little lunches here--no more games of penny ante.\"  \"It's a howling shame!\" exploded a third. \"It makes me feel grouchy.\"  \"I move we strangle Diamond,\" suggested the first speaker.  \"It seems that that is the only way to keep his tongue still,\" dolefully groaned a tall chap. \"This is a big horse on us.\"  \"That's what,\" sighed a boy with a face like a girl's. \"The whole business puts me in a blue funk.\"  Then they stood and stared silently at each other through the eyeholes in their masks, and not one of them was able to propose anything practicable.  The rest of the assembled sophomores seemed in quite as "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],["title","Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#3)"],["body","a plight, and some of them were inclined to indulge in profanity, which, although it relieved their feelings for the moment, did not suggest any way out of the scrape.  At this point Merriwell spoke up, addressing Diamond.  \"Look here, old man,\" he said in a friendly way, \"you've only taken the same dose they gave me. It's nothing when you get used to it.\"  Diamond gave him a contemptuous look, but did not speak.  \"Now, I don't propose to make a fuss about this little joke,\" Frank went on. \"What's the use? I'm not half killed.\"  \"Perhaps you think you can hoodwink me!\" cried Diamond. \"Well, you cannot! You were in the game all the time. That's why you were so ready to meet me in a duel--that's why you came here.\"  \"I assure you on my word of honor that you are wrong.\"  \"Your word of honor!\"  \"Yes, my word of honor,\" he calmly returned. \"See--look at my clothes. You can tell that I have been through the mill.\"  \"You may have had them fixed that way on purpose to fool me.\"  \"Oh, you must know better than that! Be reasonable, Diamond.\"  The Virginian made a savage gesture.  \"If you are so pleased to be made a laughingstock of it's nothing to me,\" he flashed. \"Keep still if you want to. I'm going to tell all I know.\"  \"That would make a very large book--full of nice clean, blank pages,\" said some one in the background.  Frank's manner suddenly changed.  \"Look here, Diamond,\" he said, \"you won't tell a thing.\"  The Southerner caught his breath and his eyes stared.  \"Eh?\" he muttered, surprised at the other's manner. \"I won't?\"  \"Not on your life.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because it will mean expulsion for you as well as myself if you do.\"  Every one was listening. They gathered about the two freshmen, wondering not a little at Merriwell's words and manner.  \"Expulsion for me?\" slowly repeated Diamond. \"How is that?\"  \"It's straight goods.\"  \"Explain it.\"  \"Well, I will. We came here to fight a duel, didn't we?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You admit that?\"  \"I do, sir.\"  \"That is all that's needed.\"  \"How? Why? I don't understand.\"  \"Duels are not countenanced in the North, and nothing would cause a fellow to be fired from Yale quicker than the knowledge that he had had anything to do with one while here. Do you twig?\"  There was a moment of silence and then a stir. A deep sigh of relief came from the masked lads, and some of them showed an inclination to cheer Merriwell.  Diamond seemed nonplused for the moment. He glared at Frank, his hands clinched and his face pale.  At last he slowly said:  \"A duel is something no gentleman can blow about, so if you are a gentleman you will have to remain silent, sir.\"  \"That's the way you Southerners look at it, but yon will excuse us Northerners if we do not see it in the same light. A hazing is something we do not blow about, but you seem determined to let out everything, for all that it would be a dirty thing to do. In order to even the matter, these fellows are sure to tell that you came here to fight a duel with deadly weapons, and you'll find yourself rusticating in Virginia directly.\"  \"'Way down in ole Virginny,\" softly warbled one of the delighted sophomores. \"That's the stuff, Merry, old boy!\"  Diamond trembled with intense anger. He tried to speak, but his voice was so hoarse that his words were unintelligible. A blue line seemed to form around his mouth.  \"Merriwell's got him!\" Bruce Brown lazily whispered in Tad Horner's ear. \"See him squirm!\"  Tad was relieved, although he endeavored not to show it; but a satisfied smile crept over his rosy face, and he felt like giving Frank Merriwell the \"glad hand.\"  Diamond's anger got the best of him. He strode forward, looked straight into Frank's eyes, and panted:  \"I hate you, sir! I could kill you!\"  And then, before he realized what he was doing, he struck Merriwell a sharp blow on the cheek with his open hand.     CHAPTER IV.  THE FIGHT.   The blow staggered Frank. It had come so suddenly that he was quite unprepared for it. His face became suddenly pale, save where Diamond's hand had struck, and there the crimson prints of four fingers came out quickly, like a danger signal.  With the utmost deliberation Merriwell removed his coat.  \"Come, sir!\" he said to Diamond as he passed coat and hat to a ready sophomore.  \"I--I can't fight you that way!\" protested the Virginian. \"Bring the rapiers.\"  \"This time I claim the right to name the weapons, and they will be bare fists.\"  \"Right! right!\" cried several voices. \"You'll have to fight him that way, Diamond.\"  \"I will fight him!\" grated Jack, furiously. \"It is the prize fighter's way, but I'll fight him, and I will lick him!\"  He tore off his coat and flung it down. The boys quickly formed a ring, and the freshmen foes faced each other.  Then the door of the room where the other freshmen were confined was thrust open, and Harry Rattleton excitedly cried:  \"Whee jiz--I mean jee whiz! what do you fellows think? Do you imagine we are going to stay penned in here while there is a scrap going on? Well, I guess not! We're coming out!\"  Harry came with a rush, and the other freshmen followed at his heels, the party having been abandoned by the sophs who had been placed on guard over them.  \"Hold on! hold on!\" commanded Harry, forcing his way toward the fighters. \"I am Merriwell's second, and I'm going to see fair play, you bet!\"  \"And I am Diamond's second,\" said Roland Ditson. \"Just give me a chance in the ring there.\"  The appearance of the freshmen caused a brief delay. There was some talk about rules and rounds, and Diamond said:  \"If I must fight with my fists, I'll fight as I please. I don't know about your rules, and there will be but one round--that will finish it.\"  \"How does that suit you, Merriwell?\" asked Tad Horner, who seemed to have assumed the position of referee.  \"I am willing that Mr. Diamond should arrange that matter to suit himself.\"  \"But there is to be no kicking,\" Tad Horner hastily put in.  \"Certainly not,\" stiffly agreed the Southerner.  \"All right. Shake hands.\"  Diamond placed both hands behind his back, and Merriwell laughed.  \"Ready!\" called Horner. \"On guard! Now you're off!\"  Barely had the words left the little referee's lips when--top, tap, slap!--Merriwell had struck Diamond three light blows with his open hand.  A gasp of astonishment came from the watching sophomores. Never had they seen three blows delivered in such lightning-like rapidity, but their ears had not fooled them, and they heard each blow distinctly.  Merriwell's guard was perfect, his pose was light and professional, and he suddenly seemed catlike on his feet.  Diamond was astonished, but only for an instant. The tapping blows started his blood, and he sprang toward his foe, striking out with his left and then with his right.  Merriwell did not attempt to guard, but he dodged both blows with ease, and then smiled sweetly into the face of the baffled Virginian.  \"Oh, say!\" chuckled Harry Rattleton, hugging himself in delighted anticipation, \"just you fellows wait a minute! Diamond will think he has been struck by an earthquake!\"  Bruce Browning, himself a scientific boxer, was watching every movement of the two freshmen. He turned to Puss Parker at his side and said:  \"Merriwell handles himself like an old professional. By Jove! I believe there's good stuff in that fellow!\"  \"Diamond would like to kill Merriwell,\" said Parker. \"You can see it in his face and eyes.\"  In truth there was a deadly look in the eyes of the pale-faced young Virginian. His lips were pressed together, and a hardening of the jaws told that his teeth were set. He was following Merriwell up, and the latter was avoiding him with ease. Plainly Diamond meant to corner the lad he hated and then force the fighting to a finish.  The rivals were nearly of a height and they wore built much alike, although Frank had slightly the better chest development.  Merriwell seemed to toy with Diamond, giving him several little pat-like blows on the breast and in the ribs. When the Virginian felt that he had Frank cornered he was astonished to see Merriwell slip under his arm and come up laughing behind him.  Merriwell's laughter filled Diamond's very soul with gall and wormwood.  \"Wait!\" he thought. \"He laughs best who laughs last.\"  \"Give it to him, Frank!\" urged Rattleton. \"You'll get out of wind dodging about, and then it will not be so easy to finish him off.\"  But Frank saw that in a scientific way Diamond was no match for him, and he disliked to strike the fellow. He regretted very much that the unfortunate affair had come about, and he felt that there could be no satisfaction in whipping the Southerner.  Merriwell hoped to toy with Diamond till the latter should see that his efforts were fruitless and give up in disgust.  But he did not yet recognize the kind of stuff of which John Diamond was built.  \"Come! come!\" impatiently called one of the spectators. \"Quit ducking and dodging and get into the game.\"  \"That's right! that's right!\" chorused several. \"This is no sport.\"  \"And it's no six-day walking match,\" sneered Roland Ditson. \"Merriwell seems afraid to stand up and face Diamond.\"  \"Is that what you think?\" Frank mentally exclaimed. \"Well, I suppose I will have to hit him a few times, although it goes against my grain.\"  A moment later he dropped his hands by his side and took a step to meet the Virginian. It seemed like a great opportunity for Diamond, and he led off straight for Frank's face, striking with his left.  With a slight side movement of his head Frank avoided the blow, allowing his enemy's fist to pass over his shoulder. At the same time he cross countered with his right hand, cracking Jack a heavy one under the ear.  \"Hooray!\" cried Harry Rattleton in delight. \"That was a corker! Bet Sparkler saw more stars than there are in the Wilky May--I mean Milky Way.\"  For a few minutes the fight was hot. Again and again Frank struck his enemy, but without putting his full strength into any of the blows, but it did not seem to"]]]
