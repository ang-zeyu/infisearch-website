I don't believe a word you've said, in the first place; and, anyhow, it annoys me to have you talk to me like that. I don't like it, and it simply makes me awfully, awfully tired.\"  With which characteristic speech, Miss Hugonin leaned back and sat up very rigidly and smiled at him like a cherub.  Kennaston groaned.  \"It shall be as you will,\" he assured her, with a little quaver in his speech that was decidedly effective. \"And in any event, I am not sorry that I have loved you, beautiful child. You have always been a power for good in my life. You have gladdened me with the vision of a beauty that is more than human, you have heartened me for this petty business of living, you have praised my verses, you have even accorded me certain pecuniary assistance as to their publication--though I must admit that to accept it of you was very distasteful to me. Ah!\" Felix Kennaston cried, with a quick lift of speech, \"impractical child that I am, I had not thought of that! My love had caused me to forget the great barrier that stands between us.\"  He gasped and took a short turn about the court.  \"Pardon me, Miss Hugonin,\" he entreated, when his emotions were under a little better control, \"for having spoken as I did. I had forgotten. Think of me, if you will, as no better than the others--think of me as a mere fortune-hunter. My presumption will be justly punished.\"  \"Oh, no, no, it isn't that,\" she cried; \"it isn't that, is it? You--you would care just as much about me if I were poor, wouldn't you, beautiful? I don't want you to care for me, of course,\" Margaret added, with haste. \"I want to go on being friends. Oh, that money, that _nasty_ money!\" she cried, in a sudden gust of petulance. \"It makes me so distrustful, and I can't help it!\"  He smiled at her wistfully. \"My dear,\" said he, \"are there no mirrors at Selwoode to remove your doubts?\"  \"I--yes, I do believe in you,\" she said, at length. \"But I don't want to marry you. You see, I'm not a bit in love with you,\" Margaret explained, candidly.  Ensued a silence. Mr. Kennaston bowed his head.  \"You bid me go?\" said he.  \"No--not exactly,\" said she.  He indicated a movement toward her.  \"Now, you needn't attempt to take any liberties with me,\" Miss Hugonin announced, decisively, \"because if you do I'll never speak to you again. You must let me go now. You--you must let me think.\"  Then Felix Kennaston acted very wisely. He rose and stood aside, with a little bow.  \"I can wait, child,\" he said, sadly. \"I have already waited a long time.\"  Miss Hugonin escaped into the house without further delay. It was very flattering, of course; he had spoken beautifully, she thought, and nobly and poetically and considerately, and altogether there was absolutely no excuse for her being in a temper. Still, she was.  The moon, however, considered the affair as arranged.  For she had been no whit more resolute in her refusal, you see, than becomes any self-respecting maid. In fact, she had not refused him; and the experienced moon had seen the hopes of many a wooer thrive, chameleon-like, on answers far less encouraging than that which Margaret had given Felix Kennaston.  Margaret was very fond of him. All women like a man who can do a picturesque thing without bothering to consider whether or not he be making himself ridiculous; and more than once in thinking of him she had wondered if--perhaps--possibly--some day--? And always these vague flights of fancy had ended at this precise point--incinerated, if you will grant me the simile, by the sudden flaming of her cheeks.  The thing is common enough. You may remember that Romeo was not the only gentleman that Juliet noticed at her début: there was the young Petruchio; and the son and heir of old Tiberio; and I do not question that she had a kind glance or so for County Paris. Beyond doubt, there were many with whom my lady had danced; with whom she had laughed a little; with whom she had exchanged a few perfectly affable words and looks--when of a sudden her heart speaks: \"Who's he that would not dance? If he be married, my grave is like to prove my marriage-bed.\" In any event, Paris and Petruchio and Tiberio's young hopeful can go hang; Romeo has come.  Romeo is seldom the first. Pray you, what was there to prevent Juliet from admiring So-and-so's dancing? or from observing that Signor Such-an-one had remarkably expressive eyes? or from thinking of Tybalt as a dear, reckless fellow whom it was the duty of some good woman to rescue from perdition? If no one blames the young Montague for sending Rosaline to the right-about--Rosaline for whom he was weeping and rhyming an hour before--why, pray, should not Signorina Capulet have had a few previous _affaires du coeur_? Depend upon it, she had; for was she not already past thirteen?  In like manner, I dare say that a deal passed between Desdemona and Cassio that the honest Moor never knew of; and that Lucrece was probably very pleasant and agreeable to Tarquin, as a well-bred hostess should be; and that Helen had that little affair with Theseus before she ever thought of Paris; and that if Cleopatra died for love of Antony it was not until she had previously lived a great while with Cæsar.  So Felix Kennaston had his hour. Now Margaret has gone into Selwoode, flame-faced and quite unconscious that she is humming under her breath the words of a certain inane old song:   \"Oh, she sat for me a chair;   She has ringlets in her hair;   She's a young thing and cannot leave her mother\"--  Only she sang it \"father.\" And afterward, she suddenly frowned and stamped her foot, did Margaret.  \"I _hate_ him!\" said she; but she looked very guilty.    X  In the living-hall of Selwoode Miss Hugonin paused. Undeniably there were the accounts of the Ladies' League for the Edification of the Impecunious to be put in order; her monthly report as treasurer was due in a few days, and Margaret was in such matters a careful, painstaking body, and not wholly dependent upon her secretary; but she was entirely too much out of temper to attend to that now.  It was really all Mr. Kennaston's fault, she assured a pricking conscience, as she went out on the terrace before Selwoode. He had bothered her dreadfully.  There she found Petheridge Jukesbury smoking placidly in the effulgence of the moonlight; and the rotund, pasty countenance he turned toward her was ludicrously like the moon's counterfeit in muddy water. I am sorry to admit it, but Mr. Jukesbury had dined somewhat injudiciously. You are not to stretch the phrase; he was merely prepared to accord the universe his approval, to pat Destiny upon the head, and his thoughts ran clear enough, but with Aprilian counter-changes of the jovial and the lachrymose.  \"Ah, Miss Hugonin,\" he greeted her, with a genial smile, \"I am indeed fortunate. You find me deep in meditation, and also, I am sorry to say, in the practise of a most pernicious habit. You do not object? Ah, that is so like you. You are always kind, Miss Hugonin. Your kindness, which falls, if I may so express myself, as the gentle rain from Heaven upon all deserving charitable institutions, and daily comforts the destitute with good advice and consoles the sorrowing with blankets, would now induce you to tolerate an odour which I am sure is personally distasteful to you.\"  \"But _really_ I don't mind,\" was Margaret's protest.  \"I cannot permit it,\" Mr. Jukesbury insisted, and waved a pudgy hand in the moonlight. \"No, really, I cannot permit it. We will throw it away, if you please, and say no more about it,\" and his glance followed the glowing flight of his cigar-end somewhat wistfully. \"Your father's cigars are such as it is seldom my privilege to encounter; but, then, my personal habits are not luxurious, nor my private income precisely what my childish imaginings had pictured it at this comparatively advanced period of life. Ah, youth, youth!--as the poet admirably says, Miss Hugonin, the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts, but its visions of existence are rose-tinged and free from care, and its conception of the responsibilities of manhood--such as taxes and the water-rate--I may safely characterise as extremely sketchy. But pray be seated, Miss Hugonin,\" Petheridge Jukesbury blandly urged.  Common courtesy forced her to comply. So Margaret seated herself on a little red rustic bench. In the moonlight--but I think I have mentioned how Margaret looked in the moonlight; and above her golden head the Eagle, sculptured over the door-way, stretched his wings to the uttermost, half-protectingly, half-threateningly, and seemed to view Mr. Jukesbury with a certain air of expectation.  \"A beautiful evening,\" Petheridge Jukesbury suggested, after a little cogitation.  She conceded that this was undeniable.  \"Where Nature smiles, and only the conduct of man is vile and altogether what it ought not to be,\" he continued, with unction--\"ah, how true that is and how consoling! It is a good thing to meditate upon our own vileness, Miss Hugonin--to reflect that we are but worms with naturally the most vicious inclinations. It is most salutary. Even I am but a worm, Miss Hugonin, though the press has been pleased to speak most kindly of me. Even you--ah, no!\" cried Mr. Jukesbury, kissing his finger-tips, with gallantry; \"let us say a worm who has burst its cocoon and become a butterfly--a butterfly with a charming face and a most charitable disposition and considerable property!\"  Margaret thanked him with a smile, and began to think wistfully of the Ladies' League accounts. Still, he was a good man; and she endeavoured to persuade herself that she considered his goodness to atone for his flabbiness and his fleshiness and his interminable verbosity--which she didn't.  Mr. Jukesbury sighed.  \"A naughty world,\" said he, with pathos--\"a very naughty world, which really does not deserve the honour of including you in its census reports. Yet I dare say it has the effrontery to put you down in the tax-lists"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10885"],["title","Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 1 (#0)"],["body","STORIES FROM THE ITALIAN POETS: WITH LIVES OF THE WRITERS.   BY LEIGH HUNT.    IN TWO VOLUMES. VOL. I.     MDCCCXLVI.     TO SIR PERCY SHELLEY, BART.   MY DEAR SIR PERCY,  As I know no man who surpasses yourself either in combining a love of the most romantic fiction with the coolest good sense, or in passing from the driest metaphysical questions to the heartiest enjoyment of humour,--I trust that even a modesty so true as yours will not grudge me the satisfaction of inscribing these volumes with your name.  That you should possess such varieties of taste is no wonder, considering what an abundance of intellectual honours you inherit; nor might the world have been the better for it, had they been tastes, and nothing more. But that you should inherit also that zeal for justice to mankind, which has become so Christian a feature in the character of the age, and that you should include in that zeal a special regard for the welfare of your Father's Friend, are subjects of constant pleasurable reflection to  Your obliged and affectionate  LEIGH HUNT.    PREFACE.   The purpose of these volumes is, to add to the stock of tales from the Italian writers; to retain as much of the poetry of the originals as it is in the power of the writer's prose to compass; and to furnish careful biographical notices of the authors. There have been several collections of stories from the Novellists of Italy, but none from the Poets; and it struck me that prose versions from these, of the kind here offered to the public, might not be unwillingly received. The stories are selected from the five principal narrative poets, Dante, Pulci, Boiardo, Ariosto, and Tasso; they comprise the most popular of such as are fit for translation; are reduced into one continuous narrative, when diffused and interrupted, as in the instances of those of Angelica, and Armida; are accompanied with critical and explanatory notes; and, in the case of Dante, consist of an abstract of the poet's whole work. The volumes are, furthermore, interspersed with the most favourite _morceaux_ of the originals, followed sometimes with attempts to versify them; and in the Appendix, for the furtherance of the study of the Italian language, are given entire stories, also in the original, and occasionally rendered in like manner. The book is particularly intended for such students or other lovers of the language as are pleased with any fresh endeavours to recommend it; and, at the same time, for such purely English readers as wish to know something about Italian poetry, without having leisure to cultivate its acquaintance.  I did not intend in the first instance to depart from the plan of selection in the case of Dante; but when I considered what an extraordinary person he was,--how intense is every thing which he says,--how widely he has re-attracted of late the attention of the world,--how willingly perhaps his poem might be regarded by the reader as being itself one continued story (which, in fact, it is), related personally of the writer,--and lastly, what a combination of difficulties have prevented his best translators in verse from giving the public a just idea of his almost Scriptural simplicity,--I began to think that an abstract of his entire work might possibly be looked upon as supplying something of a desideratum. I am aware that nothing but verse can do perfect justice to verse; but besides the imperfections which are pardonable, because inevitable, in all such metrical endeavours, the desire to impress a grand and worshipful idea of Dante has been too apt to lead his translators into a tone and manner the reverse of his passionate, practical, and creative style--a style which may be said to write things instead of words; and thus to render every word that is put out of its place, or brought in for help and filling up, a misrepresentation. I do not mean to say, that he himself never does any thing of the sort, or does not occasionally assume too much of the oracle and the schoolmaster, in manner as well as matter; but passion, and the absence of the superfluous, are the chief characteristics of his poetry. Fortunately, this sincerity of purpose and utterance in Dante render him the least pervertible of poets in a sincere prose translation; and, since I ventured on attempting one, I have had the pleasure of meeting with an express recommendation of such a version in an early number of the _Edinburgh Review_.[1]  The abstract of Dante, therefore, in these volumes (with every deprecation that becomes me of being supposed to pretend to give a thorough idea of any poetry whatsoever, especially without its metrical form) aspires to be regarded as, at all events, not exhibiting a false idea of the Dantesque spirit in point of feeling and expression. It is true, I have omitted long tedious lectures of scholastic divinity, and other learned absurdities of the time, which are among the bars to the poem's being read through, even in Italy (which Foscolo tells us is never the case); and I have compressed the work in other passages not essentially necessary to the formation of a just idea of the author. But quite enough remains to suggest it to the intelligent; and in no instance have I made additions or alterations. There is warrant--I hope I may say letter--for every thing put down. Dante is the greatest poet for intensity that ever lived; and he excites a corresponding emotion in his reader--I wish I could say, always on the poet's side; but his ferocious hates and bigotries too often tempt us to hate the bigot, and always compel us to take part with the fellow-creatures whom he outrages. At least, such is their effect on myself. Nor will he or his worshippers suffer us to criticise his faults with mere reference to the age in which he lived. I should have been glad to do so; but the claims made for him, even by himself, will not allow it. We are called upon to look on him as a divine, a prophet, an oracle in all respects for all time. Such a man, however, is the last whom a reporter is inclined to misrepresent. We respect his sincerity too much, ferocious and arrogant though it be; and we like to give him the full benefit of the recoil of his curses and maledictions. I hope I have not omitted one. On the other hand, as little have I closed my feelings against the lovely and enchanting sweetness which this great semi-barbarian sometimes so affectingly utters. On those occasions he is like an angel enclosed for penance in some furious giant, and permitted to weep through the creature's eyes.  The stories from goodnatured Pulci I have been obliged to compress for other reasons--chiefly their excessive diffuseness. A paragraph of the version will sometimes comprise many pages. Those of Boiardo and Ariosto are more exact; and the reader will be good enough to bear in mind, that nothing is added to any of the poets, different as the case might seem here and there on comparison with the originals. An equivalent for whatever is said is to be found in some part of the context--generally in letter, always in spirit. The least characteristically exact passages are some in the love-scenes of Tasso; for I have omitted the plays upon words and other corruptions in style, in which that poet permitted himself to indulge. But I have noticed the circumstance in the comment. In other respects, I have endeavoured to make my version convey some idea of the different styles and genius of the writers,--of the severe passion of Dante; of the overflowing gaiety and affecting sympathies of Pulci, several of whose passages in the Battle of Roncesvalles are masterpieces of pathos; of the romantic and inventive elegance of Boiardo; the great cheerful universality of Ariosto, like a healthy _anima mundi_; and the ambitious irritability, the fairy imagination, and tender but somewhat effeminate voluptuousness of the poet of Armida and Rinaldo. I do not pretend that prose versions of passages from these writers can supersede the necessity of metrical ones, supposing proper metrical ones attainable. They suffice for them, in some respects, less than for Dante, the manner in their case being of more importance to the effect. But with all due respect to such translators as Harrington, Rose, and Wiffen, their books are not Ariosto and Tasso, even in manner. Harrington, the gay \"godson\" of Queen Elizabeth, is not always unlike Ariosto; but when not in good spirits he becomes as dull as if her majesty had frowned on him. Rose was a man of wit, and a scholar; yet he has undoubtedly turned the ease and animation of his original into inversion and insipidity. And Wiffen, though elegant and even poetical, did an unfortunate thing for Tasso, when he gave an additional line and a number of paraphrastic thoughts to a stanza already tending to the superfluous. Fairfax himself, who, upon the whole, and with regard to a work of any length, is the best metrical translator our language has seen, and, like Chapman, a genuine poet, strangely aggravated the sins of prettiness and conceit in his original, and added to them a love of tautology amounting to that of a lawyer. As to Hoole, he is below criticism; and other versions I have not happened to see. Now if I had no acquaintance with the Italian language, I confess I would rather get any friend who had, to read to me a passage out of Dante, Tasso, or Ariosto, into the first simple prose that offered itself, than go to any of the above translators for a taste of it, Fairfax excepted; and we have seen with how much allowance his sample would have to be taken. I have therefore, with some restrictions, only ventured to do for the public what I would have had a friend do for myself.  The _Critical and Biographical Notices_ I did not intend to make so long at first; but the interest grew upon me; and I hope the reader will regard some of them--Dante's and Tasso's in particular--as being \"stories\" themselves, after their kind,--\"stories, alas, too true;\" \"rom"]]]
