As they advanced, Leonard observed a pile of dried skulls and bones in one corner, a stone coffin, strips of woollen shrouds, fragments of coffins, mattocks, and spades. It was evidently half a charnel, half a receptacle for the sexton's tools.  \"If you choose to open that door,\" said the verger, pointing to one at the lower end of the chamber, \"you will find him you seek. I shall go no further.\"  Summoning up all his resolution, Leonard pushed open the door. A frightful scene met his gaze. At one side of a deep, low-roofed vault, the architecture of which was of great antiquity, and showed that it had been a place of burial, was stretched a miserable pallet, and upon it, covered by a single blanket, lay a wretch, whose groans and struggles proclaimed the anguish he endured. A lamp was burning on the floor, and threw a sickly light upon the agonized countenance of the sufferer. He was a middle-aged man, with features naturally harsh, but which now, contracted by pain, had assumed a revolting expression. An old crone, who proved to be his mother, and a young man, who held him down in bed by main force, tended him. He was rambling in a frightful manner; and as his ravings turned upon the most loathly matters, it required some firmness to listen to them.  At a little distance from him, upon a bench, sat a stout, shrewd-looking, but benevolent little personage, somewhat between forty and fifty. This was Doctor Hodges. He had a lancet in his hand, with which he had just operated upon the sufferer, and he was in the act of wiping it on a cloth. As Leonard entered the vault, the doctor observed to the attendants of the sick man, \"He will recover. The tumour has discharged its venom. Keep him as warm as you can, and do not let him leave his bed for two days. All depends upon that. I will send him proper medicines and some blankets shortly. If he takes cold, it will be fatal.\"  The young man promised to attend to the doctor's injunctions, and the old woman mumbled her thanks.  \"Where is Judith Malmayns?\" asked Doctor Hodges: \"I am surprised not to see her. Is she afraid of the distemper?\"  \"Afraid of it!--not she,\" replied the old woman. \"Since the plague has raged so dreadfully, she has gone out as a nurse to the sick, and my poor son has seen nothing of her.\"  Leonard then recollected that he had heard the woman, who called out of the miser's house, addressed as Mother Malmayns by the coffin-maker, and had no doubt that she was the sexton's wife. His entrance having been so noiseless that it passed unnoticed, he now stepped forward, and, addressing Doctor Hodges, acquainted him with his errand.  \"What!\" exclaimed the doctor, as soon as he concluded, \"a son of Stephen Bloundel, the worthy grocer of Wood-street, attacked by the plague! I will go with you instantly, young man. I have a great regard for your master--a very great regard. There is not a better man living. The poor lad must be saved, if possible.\" And hastily repeating his instructions to the attendants of the sick man, he left the vault with the apprentice.  They found the verger in the charnel, and before quitting it, the doctor drew a small flask of canary from his pocket, and applied it to his lips.  \"This is my anti-pestilential drink,\" he remarked with a smile, \"and it has preserved me from contagion hitherto. You must let us out of the south door, friend,\" he added to the verger, \"for I shall be obliged to step home for a moment, and it will save time. Come with me, young man, and tell me what has been done for the grocer's son.\"  As they traversed the gloomy aisle of Saint Faith, and mounted to the upper structure, Leonard related all that had taken place since poor Stephen's seizure. The doctor strongly expressed his approval of what had been done, and observed, \"It could not be better. With Heaven's help, I have no doubt we shall save him, and I am truly glad of it for his father's sake.\"  By this time they had reached the southern door, and the verger having unlocked it, they issued forth. It was still bright moonlight, and Leonard, whose mind was greatly relieved by the assurances of the physician, felt in some degree reconciled to the delay, and kept up his part in the conversation promoted by his companion. The doctor, who was an extremely kind-hearted man, and appeared to have a great regard for the grocer, made many inquiries as to his family, and spoke in terms of the highest admiration of the beauty of his eldest daughter. The mention of Amabel's name, while it made Leonard's cheek burn, rekindled all his jealousy of Wyvil, and he tried to make some excuse to get away, but his companion would not hear of it.  \"I tell you there is no hurry,\" said the doctor; \"all is going on as well as possible. I will make your excuses to your master.\"  \"On reaching the doctor's house they were ushered into a large room, surrounded with bookshelves and cases of anatomical preparations. Hodges seated himself at a table, on which a shaded lamp was placed, and writing out a prescription, desired his servant to get it made up at a neighbouring apothecary's, and to take it, with a couple of blankets, to the sexton of Saint Paul's. He then produced a bottle of medicated canary, and pouring out a large glass for the apprentice, drained another himself.  \"I will answer for its virtue,\" he said: \"it is a sure preservative against the plague.\"  Having furnished himself with several small packets of simples, a few pots of ointment, one or two phials, and a case of surgical instruments, he told Leonard he was ready to attend him.  \"We will go round by Warwick-lane,\" he added. \"I must call upon Chowles, the coffin-maker. It will not detain us a moment; and I have an order to give him.\"  The mention of this name brought to Leonard's mind the hideous attendant on the dead-cart, and he had no doubt he was the person in question. It did not become him, however, to make a remark, and they set out.  Mounting Addle-hill, and threading Ave-Maria-lane, they entered Warwick-lane, and about half-way up the latter thoroughfare, the doctor stopped before a shop, bearing on its immense projecting sign the representation of a coffin lying in state, and covered with scutcheons, underneath which was written, \"ANSELM CHOWLES, COFFIN-MAKER.\"  \"I do not think you will find Mr. Chowles at home,\" observed Leonard: \"for I saw him with the dead-cart not half an hour ago.\"  \"Very likely,\" returned the doctor; \"but I shall see one of his men. The coffin-maker's business is now carried on in the night time,\" he added, with a sigh; \"and he drives a flourishing trade. These sad times will make his fortune.\"  As he spoke, he rapped with his cane at the door, which, after a little delay, was opened by a young man in a carpenter's dress, with a hammer in his hand. On seeing who it was, this person exhibited great confusion, and would have retired; but the doctor, pushing him aside, asked for his master.  \"You cannot see him just now, sir,\" replied the other, evidently considerably embarrassed. \"He is just come home greatly fatigued, and is about to retire to rest.\"  \"No matter,\" returned the doctor, entering a room, in which three or four other men were at work, hastily finishing coffins; \"I _must_ see him.\"  No further opposition being offered, Hodges, followed by the apprentice, marched towards an inner room. Just as he reached the door, a burst of loud laughter, evidently proceeding from a numerous party, arose from within, and a harsh voice was heard chanting the following strains:  SONG OF THE PLAGUE. To others the Plague a foe may be, To me 'tis a friend--not an enemy; My coffins and coffers alike it fills, And the richer I grow the more it kills. _Drink the Plague! Drink the Plague!_  For months, for years, may it spend its rage On lusty manhood and trembling age; Though half mankind of the scourge should die, My coffins will sell--so what care I? _Drink the Plague! Drink the Plague!_  Loud acclamations followed the song, and the doctor, who was filled with disgust and astonishment, opened the door. He absolutely recoiled at the scene presented to his gaze. In the midst of a large room, the sides of which were crowded with coffins, piled to the very ceiling, sat about a dozen personages, with pipes in their mouths, and flasks and glasses before them. Their seats were coffins, and their table was a coffin set upon a bier. Perched on a pyramid of coffins, gradually diminishing in size as the pile approached its apex, Chowles was waving a glass in one hand, and a bottle in the other, when the doctor made his appearance.  A more hideous personage cannot be imagined than the coffin-maker. He was clothed in a suit of rusty black, which made his skeleton limbs look yet more lean and cadaverous. His head was perfectly bald, and its yellow skin, divested of any artificial covering, glistened like polished ivory. His throat was long and scraggy, and supported a head unrivalled for ugliness. His nose had been broken in his youth, and was almost compressed flat with his face. His few remaining teeth were yellow and discoloured with large gaps between them. His eyes were bright, and set in deep cavernous recesses, and, now that he was more than half-intoxicated, gleamed with unnatural lustre. The friends by whom he was surrounded were congenial spirits,--searchers, watchmen, buriers, apothecaries, and other wretches, who, like himself, rejoiced in the pestilence, because it was a source of profit to them.  At one corner of the room, with a part-emptied glass before her, and several articles in her lap, which she hastily pocketed on the entrance of the doctor, sat the plague-nurse, Mother Malmayns; and Leonard thought her, if possible, more villainous-looking than her companions. She was a rough, raw-boned woman, with sandy hair and light brows, a sallow, freckled complexion, a nose with wide nostrils,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11082"],["title","Old Saint Paul's: A Tale of the Plague and the Fire (#7)"],["body","a large, thick-lipped mouth. She had, moreover, a look of mingled cunning and ferocity inexpressibly revolting.  Sharply rebuking Chowles, who, in springing from his lofty seat, upset several of the topmost coffins, the doctor gave him some directions, and, turning to the nurse, informed her of her husband's condition, and ordered her to go to him immediately. Mother Malmayns arose, and glancing significantly at the coffin-maker, took her departure.  Repeating his injunctions to Chowles in a severe tone, the doctor followed; and seeing her take the way towards Saint Paul's, proceeded at a brisk pace along Paternoster-row with the apprentice. In a few minutes they reached Wood-street, and knocking at the door, were admitted by Blaize.  \"Heaven be praised, you are come at last!\" exclaimed the porter. \"Our master began to think something had happened to you.\"  \"It is all my fault,\" returned Doctor Hodges; \"but how is the young man?\"  \"Better, much better, as I understand,\" replied Blaize; \"but I have not seen him.\"  \"Come, that's well,\" rejoined Hodges. \"Lead me to his room.\"  \"Leonard will show you the way,\" returned the porter, holding back.  Glancing angrily at Blaize, the apprentice conducted the doctor to the inner room, where they found the grocer, with the Bible on his knee, watching by the bedside of his son. He was delighted with their appearance, but looked inquisitively at his apprentice for some explanation of his long absence. This Hodges immediately gave; and, having examined the sufferer, he relieved the anxious father by declaring, that, with due care, he had little doubt of his son's recovery.  \"God be praised!\" exclaimed Bloundel, falling on his knees.  Hodges then gave minute directions to the grocer as to how he was to proceed, and told him it would be necessary for some time to keep his family separate. To this Bloundel readily agreed. The doctor's next inquiries were, whether notice had been given to the Examiner of Health, and the grocer referring to Leonard, the latter acknowledged that he had forgotten it, but undertook to repair his omission at once.  With this view, he quitted the room, and was hastening towards the shop, when he observed a figure on the back stairs. Quickly mounting them, he overtook on the landing Maurice Wyvil.  *       *       *       *       *     III. THE GAMESTER AND THE BULLY.  Before proceeding further, it will be necessary to retrace our steps for a short time, and see what was done by Maurice Wyvil after the alarming announcement made to him by the apprentice. Of a selfish nature and ungovernable temper, and seeking only in the pursuit of the grocer's daughter the gratification of his lawless desires, he was filled, in the first instance, with furious disappointment at being robbed of the prize, at the very moment he expected it to fall into his hands. But this feeling was quickly effaced by anxiety respecting his mistress, whose charms, now that there was every probability of losing her (for Leonard's insinuation had led him to believe she was assailed by the pestilence), appeared doubly attractive to him; and scarcely under the governance of reason, he hurried towards Wood-street, resolved to force his way into the house, and see her again, at all hazards. His wild design, however, was fortunately prevented. As he passed the end of the court leading to the ancient inn (for it was ancient even at the time of this history), the Swan-with-two-Necks, in Lad-lane, a young man, as richly attired as himself, and about his own age, who had seen him approaching, suddenly darted from it, and grasping his cloak, detained him.  \"I thought it must be you, Wyvil,\" cried this person. \"Where are you running so quickly? I see neither angry father, nor jealous apprentice, at your heels. What has become of the girl? Are you tired of her already?\"  \"Let me go, Lydyard,\" returned Wyvil, trying to extricate himself from his companion's hold, who was no other than the gallant that had accompanied him on his first visit to the grocer's shop, and had played his part so adroitly in the scheme devised between them to procure an interview with Amabel,--\"let me go, I say, I am in no mood for jesting.\"  \"Why, what the plague is the matter?\" rejoined Lydyard. \"Has your mistress played you false? Have you lost your wager?\"  \"The plague _is_ the matter,\" replied Wyvil, sternly. \"Amabel is attacked by it. I must see her instantly.\"  \"The devil!\" exclaimed Lydyard. \"Here is a pretty termination to the affair. But if this is really the case, you must _not_ see her. It is one thing to be run through the arm,--which you must own I managed as dexterously as the best master of fence could have done,--and lose a few drops of blood for a mistress, but it is another to brave the plague on her account.\"  \"I care for nothing,\" replied Wyvil; \"I _will_ see her.\"  \"This is madness!\" remonstrated Lydyard, still maintaining his grasp. \"What satisfaction will it afford you to witness her sufferings--to see the frightful ravages made upon her charms by this remorseless disease,--to throw her whole family into consternation, and destroy the little chance she may have of recovery, by your presence? What good will this do? No,--you must pay your wager to Sedley, and forget her.\"  \"I cannot forget her,\" replied Wyvil. \"My feelings have undergone a total change. If I _am_ capable of real love, it is for her.\"  \"Real love!\" exclaimed Lydyard, in an incredulous tone. \"If the subject were not too serious, I should laugh in your face. No doubt you would marry her, and abandon your design upon the rich heiress, pretty Mistress Mallet, whom old Rowley recommended to your attention, and whom the fair Stewart has more than half-won for you?\"  \"I would,\" replied the other, energetically.  \"Nay, then, you are more insane than I thought you,\" rejoined Lydyard, relinquishing his hold; \"and the sooner you take the plague the better. It may cure your present brain fever. I shall go back to Parravicin, and the others. You will not require my assistance further.\"  \"I know not,\" replied Wyvil, distractedly; \"I have not yet given up my intention of carrying off the girl.\"  \"If you carry her oft in this state,\" rejoined the other, \"it must be to the pest-house. But who told you she was attacked by the plague?\"  \"Her father's apprentice,\" replied Wyvil.  \"And you believed him?\" demanded Lydyard, with a derisive laugh.  \"Undoubtedly,\" replied Wyvil. \"Why not?\"  \"Because it is evidently a mere trick to frighten you from the house,\" rejoined Lydyard. \"I am surprised so shallow a device should succeed with _you_.\"  \"I wish I could persuade myself it was a trick,\" returned Wyvil. \"But the fellow's manner convinced me he was in earnest.\"  \"Well, I will not dispute the point, though I am sure I am right,\" returned Lydyard. \"But be not too precipitate. Since the apprentice has seen you, some alteration may be necessary in your plans. Come with me into the house. A few minutes can make no difference.\"  Wyvil suffered himself to be led up the court, and passing through a door on the left, they entered a spacious room, across which ran a long table, furnished at one end with wine and refreshments, and at the other with cards and dice.  Three persons were seated at the table, the most noticeable of whom was a dissipated-looking young man, dressed in the extremity of the prevailing mode, with ruffles of the finest colbertine, three inches in depth, at his wrists; a richly-laced cravat round his throat; white silk hose, adorned with gold clocks; velvet shoes of the same colour as the hose, fastened with immense roses; a silver-hilted sword, supported by a broad embroidered silk band; and a cloak and doublet of carnation-coloured velvet, woven with gold, and decorated with innumerable glittering points and ribands. He had a flowing wig of flaxen hair, and a broad-leaved hat, looped with a diamond buckle, and placed negligently on the left side of his head. His figure was slight, but extremely well formed; and his features might have been termed handsome, but for their reckless and licentious expression. He was addressed by his companions as Sir Paul Parravicin.  The person opposite to him, whose name was Disbrowe, and who was likewise a very handsome young man, though his features were flushed and disturbed, partly by the wine he had drunk, and partly by his losses at play, was equipped in the splendid accoutrements of a captain in the king's body-guard. His left hand convulsively clutched an empty purse, and his eyes were fixed upon a large sum of money, which he had just handed over to the knight, and which the latter was carelessly transferring to his pocket.  The last of the three, whose looks betrayed his character--that of a sharper and a bully--called himself Major Pillichody, his pretensions to military rank being grounded upon his service (so ran his own statement, though it was never clearly substantiated) in the king's army during the civil wars. Major Pillichody was a man of remarkably fierce exterior. Seamed with many scars, and destitute of the left eye, the orifice of which was covered, with a huge black patch; his face was of a deep mulberry colour, clearly attesting his devotion to the bottle; while his nose, which was none of the smallest, was covered with \"bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames of fire.\" He was of the middle size, stoutly built, and given to corpulency, though not so much so as to impair his activity. His attire consisted of a cloak and doublet of scarlet cloth, very much stained and tarnished, and edged with gold lace, likewise the worse for wear; jack-boots, with huge funnel tops; spurs, with enormous rowels, and a rapier of preposterous length. He wore his own hair, which was swart and woolly, like that of a negro; and had beard and moustaches to match. His hat was fiercely cocked; his gestures swaggering and insolent; and he was perpetually racking his brain to invent new and extra-ordinary oaths. "]]]
