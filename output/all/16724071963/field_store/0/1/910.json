I tried to ignore it and treat Reuben as I always had done, but this I found impossible; my womanly pride was much too deeply hurt. And yet I felt it the lowest depth of meanness to harbour such thoughts of him without giving him the opportunity to defend himself. And although it was most unlike Reuben in some respects, it was very like him in others; for he has always expressed the utmost contempt for men who marry for a livelihood. So I have remained on the horns of a dilemma and am there still. What do you think I ought to have done?\"  I rubbed my chin in some embarrassment at this question. Needless to say, I was most disagreeably impressed by Walter Hornby's conduct, and not a little disposed to blame my fair companion for giving an ear to his secret disparagement of his cousin; but I was obviously not in a position to pronounce, offhand, upon the merits of the case.  \"The position appears to be this,\" I said, after a pause, \"either Reuben has spoken most unworthily and untruthfully of you, or Walter has lied deliberately about him.\"  \"Yes,\" she agreed, \"that is the position; but which of the two alternatives appears to you the more probable?\"  \"That is very difficult to say,\" I answered. \"There is a certain kind of cad who is much given to boastful rhodomontade concerning his conquests. We all know him and can generally spot him at first sight, but I must say that Reuben Hornby did not strike me as that kind of man at all. Then it is clear that the proper course for Walter to have adopted, if he had really heard such rumours, was to have had the matter out with Reuben, instead of coming secretly to you with whispered reports. That is my feeling, Miss Gibson, but, of course, I may be quite wrong. I gather that our two young friends are not inseparable companions?\"  \"Oh, they are very good friends, but you see, their interests and views of life are quite different. Reuben, although an excellent worker in business hours, is a student, or perhaps rather what one would call a scholar, whereas Walter is more a practical man of affairs--decidedly long-headed and shrewd. He is undoubtedly very clever, as Mrs. Hornby said.\"  \"He takes photographs, for instance,\" I suggested.  \"Yes. But not ordinary amateur photographs; his work is more technical and quite excellent of its kind. For example, he did a most beautiful series of micro-photographs of sections of metalliferous rocks which he reproduced for publication by the collotype process, and even printed off the plates himself.\"  \"I see. He must be a very capable fellow.\"  \"He is, very,\" she assented, \"and very keen on making a position; but I am afraid he is rather too fond of money for its own sake, which is not a pleasant feature in a young man's character, is it?\"  I agreed that it was not.  \"Excessive keenness in money affairs,\" proceeded Miss Gibson oracularly, \"is apt to lead a young man into bad ways--oh, you need not smile, Dr. Jervis, at my wise saws; it is perfectly true, and you know it. The fact is, I sometimes have an uneasy feeling that Walter's desire to be rich inclines him to try what looks like a quick and easy method of making money. He had a friend--a Mr. Horton--who is a dealer on the Stock Exchange and who 'operates' rather largely--'operate' I believe is the expression used, although it seems to be nothing more than common gambling--and I have more than once suspected Walter of being concerned in what Mr. Horton calls 'a little flutter.'\"  \"That doesn't strike me as a very long-headed proceeding,\" I remarked, with the impartial wisdom of the impecunious, and therefore untempted.  \"No,\" she agreed, \"it isn't. But your gambler always thinks he is going to win--though you mustn't let me give you the impression that Walter is a gambler. But here is my destination. Thank you for escorting me so far, and I hope you are beginning to feel less like a stranger to the Hornby family. We shall make our appearance to-night at eight punctually.\"  She gave me her hand with a frank smile and tripped up the steps leading to the street door; and when I glanced back, after crossing the road, she gave me a little friendly nod as she turned to enter the house.      CHAPTER V  THE 'THUMBOGRAPH'   \"So your net has been sweeping the quiet and pleasant waters of feminine conversation,\" remarked Thorndyke when we met at the dinner table and I gave him an outline of my afternoon's adventures.  \"Yes,\" I answered, \"and here is the catch cleaned and ready for the consumer.\"  I laid on the table two of my notebooks in which I had entered such facts as I had been able to extract from my talk with Miss Gibson.  \"You made your entries as soon as possible after your return, I suppose?\" said Thorndyke--\"while the matter was still fresh?\"  \"I wrote down my notes as I sat on a seat in Kensington Gardens within five minutes after leaving Miss Gibson.\"  \"Good!\" said Thorndyke. \"And now let us see what you have collected.\"  He glanced quickly through the entries in the two books, referring back once or twice, and stood for a few moments silent and abstracted. Then he laid the little books down on the table with a satisfied nod.  \"Our information, then,\" he said, \"amounts to this: Reuben is an industrious worker at his business and, in his leisure, a student of ancient and medieval art; possibly a babbling fool and a cad or, on the other hand, a maligned and much-abused man.  \"Walter Hornby is obviously a sneak and possibly a liar; a keen man of business, perhaps a flutterer round the financial candle that burns in Throgmorton Street; an expert photographer and a competent worker of the collotype process. You have done a very excellent day's work, Jervis. I wonder if you see the bearing of the facts that you have collected.\"  \"I think I see the bearing of some of them,\" I answered; \"at least, I have formed certain opinions.\"  \"Then keep them to yourself, _mon ami_, so that I need not feel as if I ought to unbosom myself of my own views.\"  \"I should be very much surprised if you did, Thorndyke,\" I replied, \"and should have none the better opinion of you. I realise fully that your opinions and theories are the property of your client and not to be used for the entertainment of your friends.\"  Thorndyke patted me on the back playfully, but he looked uncommonly pleased, and said, with evident sincerity, \"I am really grateful to you for saying that, for I have felt a little awkward in being so reticent with you who know so much of this case. But you are quite right, and I am delighted to find you so discerning and sympathetic. The least I can do under the circumstances is to uncork a bottle of Pommard, and drink the health of so loyal and helpful a colleague. Ah! Praise the gods! here is Polton, like a sacrificial priest accompanied by a sweet savour of roasted flesh. Rump steak I ween,\" he added, sniffing, \"food meet for the mighty Shamash (that pun was fortuitous, I need not say) or a ravenous medical jurist. Can you explain to me, Polton, how it is that your rump steak is better than any other steak? Is it that you have command of a special brand of ox?\"  The little man's dry countenance wrinkled with pleasure until it was as full of lines as a ground-plan of Clapham Junction.  \"Perhaps it is the special treatment it gets, sir,\" he replied. \"I usually bruise it in the mortar before cooking, without breaking up the fibre too much, and then I heat up the little cupel furnace to about 600 C, and put the steak in on a tripod.\"  Thorndyke laughed outright. \"The cupel furnace, too,\" he exclaimed. \"Well, well, 'to what base uses'--but I don't know that it is a base use after all. Anyhow, Polton, open a bottle of Pommard and put a couple of ten by eight 'process' plates in your dark slides. I am expecting two ladies here this evening with a document.\"  \"Shall you bring them upstairs, sir?\" inquired Polton, with an alarmed expression.  \"I expect I shall have to,\" answered Thorndyke.  \"Then I shall just smarten the laboratory up a bit,\" said Polton, who evidently appreciated the difference between the masculine and feminine view as to the proper appearance of working premises.  \"And so Miss Gibson wanted to know our private views on the case?\" said Thorndyke, when his voracity had become somewhat appeased.  \"Yes,\" I answered; and then I repeated our conversation as nearly as I could remember it.  \"Your answer was very discreet and diplomatic,\" Thorndyke remarked, \"and it was very necessary that it should be, for it is essential that we show the backs of our cards to Scotland Yard; and if to Scotland Yard, then to the whole world. We know what their trump card is and can arrange our play accordingly, so long as we do not show our hand.\"  \"You speak of the police as your antagonists; I noticed that at the 'Yard' this morning, and was surprised to find that they accepted the position. But surely their business is to discover the actual offender, not to fix the crime on some particular person.\"  \"That would seem to be so,\" replied Thorndyke, \"but in practice it is otherwise. When the police have made an arrest they work for a conviction. If the man is innocent, that is his business, not theirs; it is for him to prove it. The system is a pernicious one--especially since the efficiency of a police officer is, in consequence, apt to be estimated by the number of convictions he has secured, and an inducement is thus held out to him to obtain a conviction, if possible; but it is of a piece with legislative procedure in general. Lawyers are not engaged in academic discussions or in the pursuit of truth, but each is trying, by hook or by crook, to make out a particular case without regard to its actual truth or even to the lawyer's own belief on the subject. That is what produces so much friction between lawyers and scientific witnesses; neither can understand the point of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11137"],["title","Twenty-Two Years a Slave, and Forty Years a Freeman (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: [Signature of] Austin Steward]     TWENTY-TWO YEARS A SLAVE, AND FORTY YEARS A FREEMAN;  EMBRACING A CORRESPONDENCE OF SEVERAL YEARS, WHILE PRESIDENT OF WILBERFORCE COLONY, LONDON, CANADA WEST,  BY AUSTIN STEWARD.   1856    FROM GOVERNOR CLARK.

ALLING,  Dear Sir:--The undersigned have heard with pleasure, that you are about issuing a Book made up from incidents in the life of Austin STEWARD. We have been the early acquaintances and associates of Mr. Steward, while a business man in Rochester in an early day, and take pleasure in bearing testimony to his high personal, moral and Christian character. In a world of vicissitude, Mr. Steward has received no ordinary share, and we hope, while his book may do the world good, it may prove a substantial benefit to him in his declining years.

STEWARD, ESQ.,  Dear Sir:--In reply to your letter upon the propriety of publishing your life, I answer, that there is not only no objection to it, but it will be timely, and is demanded by every consideration of humanity and justice. Every tongue which speaks for Freedom, which has once been held by the awful gag of Slavery, is trumpet-tongued--and he who pleads against this monstrous oppression, if he can say, \"here are the scars,\" can do much.  It is a great pleasure to me to run back to my boyhood, and stop at that spot where I first met you. I recollect the story of your wrongs, and your joy in the supposition that all were now ended in your freedom; of your thirst for knowledge, as you gathered up from the rudimental books--not then very plenty--a few snatches of the elements of the language; of playing the school-master to you, in \"setting copies\" for your writing-- book; of guiding your mind and pen. I remember your commencement in business, and the outrage and indignity offered you in Rochester, by white competitors on no other ground than that of color.[1] I saw your bitter tears, and recollect assuring you--what afterwards proved true--that justice would overtake the offenders, and that you would live to see these enemies bite the dust! I remember your unsullied character, and your prosperity, and when your word or endorsement was equal to that of any other citizen. I remember too, when yourself, and others of your kind, sunk all the gatherings of years of toil, in an unsuccessful attempt to establish an asylum for your enslaved and oppressed brethren--and, not to enumerate, which I might do much farther, I remember when your \"old master,\" finding you had been successful, while he himself had lost in the changes on fortune's wheel--came here and set up a claim to yourself and your property--a claim which might have held both, had not a higher power suddenly summoned him to a tribunal, where both master and slave shall one day answer each for himself!  But to the book. Let its plain, unvarnished tale be sent out, and the story of Slavery and its abominations, again be told by one who has felt in his own person its scorpion lash, and the weight of its grinding heel. I think it will do good service, and could not have been sent forth at a more auspicious period. The downfall of the hateful system of Slavery is certain. Though long delayed, justice is sure to come at length; and he must be a slow thinker and a poor seer, who cannot discern in the elements already at work, the mighty forces which must eventually crush this oppression. I know that you and I have felt discouraged at the long delay, years ago,--when we might have kept up our hopes by the fact that every thing that is slow is _sure_. Your book may be humble and your descriptions tame, yet truth is always mighty; and you may furnish the sword for some modern Sampson, who shall shout over more slain than his ancient prototype. I close with the wish, that much success may attend your labors, in more ways than one, and that your last days may be your best--and am,  Your old Friend,  And obed't serv't,  EDWIN SCRANTOM.  [Footnote 1: The indignity spoken of was this: Mr. Steward had established a grocery and provision store on Buffalo Street, in a part of Abner Wakelee's building, opposite the Eagle Hotel. He put up his sign, a very plain and proper one, and at night, some competitors, whom he knew, as well as he could know anything which he could not prove, smeared his sign with black paint, utterly destroying it! But the misguided men who stooped to such an act--the victims of sensuality and excess--have years ago ended their journey, and passed to the bar of a higher adjudication.]         *       *       *       *       *  CONTENTS.

CONCLUSION  CORRESPONDENCE     PREFACE.    The author does not think that any apology is necessary for this issue of his Life and History. He believes that American Slavery is now the great question before the American People: that it is not merely a political question, coming up before the country as the grand element in the making of a President, and then to be laid aside for four years; but that its moral bearings are of such a nature that the Patriot, the Philanthropist, and all good men agree that it is an evil of so much magnitude, that longer to permit it, is to wink at _sin_, and to incur the righteous judgments of God. The late outrages and aggressions of the slave power to possess itself of new soil, and extend the influence of the hateful and God-provoking \"Institution,\" is a practical commentary upon its benefits and the moral qualities of those who seek to sustain and extend it. The author is therefore the more willing--nay, anxious, to lay alongside of such arguments the history of his own life and experiences _as a slave_, that those who read may know what are some of the characteristics of that highly favored institution, which is sought to be preserved and perpetuated. \"Facts are stubborn things,\"--and this is the reason why all systems, religious, moral, or social, which are founded in injustice, and supported by fraud and robbery, suffer so much by faithful exposition.  The author has endeavored to present a true statement of the practical workings of the system of Slavery, as he has seen and _felt it himself._ He has intended \"nothing to extenuate, nor aught set down in malice;\" indeed, so far from believing that he has misrepresented Slavery as an institution, he does not feel that he has the power to give anything like a true picture of it in all its deformity and wickedness; especially _that_ Slavery which is an institution among an enlightened and Christian people, who profess to believe that all men are born _free_ and _equal_, and who have certain inalienable _rights_, among which are _life, liberty_, and the pursuit of happiness.  The author claims that he has endeavored since he had his freedom, as much as in him lay, to benefit his suffering fellows in bondage; and that he has spent most of his free life in efforts to elevate them in manners and morals, though against all the opposing forces of prejudice and pride, which of course, has made much of his labor vain. In his old age he sends out this history--presenting as it were his _own body_, with the marks and scars of the tender mercies of slave drivers upon it, and asking that these may plead in the name of Justice, Humanity, and Mercy, that those who have the power, may have the magnanimity to strike off the chains from the enslaved, and bid him stand up, a Freeman and a Brother!
