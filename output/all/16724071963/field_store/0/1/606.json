The food of the Morning-Glory is called _albumen_; it does not differ from the others in kind, but only in its manner of storage.[1]  [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. III. Seed-Food.]  Also the questions have brought out the fact that the Bean and Pea have the plumule ready formed in the seed, while the Morning-Glory and Sunflower have not. Why should this be? It is because there is so much food stored in the first two that the plumule can develop before a root is formed, while in the others there is only nourishment sufficient to enable the plantlet to form its roots. These must make the second leaves by their own labor.   3. _Comparison with other Dicotyledons_.--The pupils should now have other seeds to compare with these four. Let them arrange Flax, Four o-clock, Horsechestnut, Almond, Nasturtium, Maple-seeds, etc., under two heads.  _Seeds with the Food stored               _Seeds with the Food stored outside the plantlet                      in the embryo itself (Albuminous)_.                            (Exalbuminous)_.  Flax. Four-o'clock.                       Acorn. Horsechestnut. Almond. Morning-Glory.                            Maple. Sunflower. Squash.                                           Bean. Pea. Nasturtium.  They may also be divided into those with and without the plumule.  _Without Plumule_.                        _With Plumule_.  Flax. Maple. Sunflower.                   Acorn. Horsechestnut. Four-o'clock.                             Almond. Bean. Pea. Morning-Glory.                            Squash. Nasturtium.  Those with plumules will be seen to have the most abundant nourishment. In many cases this is made use of by man.  These last can be again divided into those in which the cotyledons come up into the air and those where they remain in the ground.  _In the Air_.                             _In the Ground_.  Bean. Almond. Squash.                     Acorn. Horsechestnut.                                           Pea. Nasturtium.  In the latter the cotyledons are so heavily gorged with nourishment that they never become of any use as leaves. As Darwin points out, they have a better chance of escaping destruction by animals by remaining in the ground.  The cotyledons are very good illustrations of the different uses to which a single organ may be put, and the thorough understanding of it will prepare the pupils' minds for other metamorphoses, and for the theory that all the various parts of a plant are modified forms of a very few members.   4. _Nature of the Caulicle_.--Probably some of the pupils will have called the caulicle the root. It is, however, of the nature of stem. The root grows only at the end, from a point just behind the tip; the stem elongates throughout its whole length. This can be shown by marking the stem and roots of a young seedling with ink. India ink must be used, as common ink injures the plants. Dip a needle in the ink and prick a row of spots at equal distances on a young root. Corn is very good for this purpose, but Morning-Glory or Bean is better for experiments on the stem. The plants should then be carefully watched and the changes in the relative distance of the spots noted. The experiment is very easily conducted with the seedlings growing on sponge, with their roots in the moist air of the tumbler, as before described.  Dr. Goodale says of this experiment,--\"Let a young seedling of corn be grown on damp paper in the manner described in No. 1,[1] and when the longest root is a few centimetres long let it be marked very carefully by means of India ink, or purple ink, put on with a delicate camel's-hair pencil just one centimetre apart. Plants thus marked are to be kept under favorable conditions with respect to moisture and warmth, so that growth will be as rapid as possible. The marks on the older part of the root will not change their relative distance, but the mark at the tip will be carried away from the one next it, showing that the growth has taken place only at this point. Such experiments as the one described are perfectly practicable for all classes of pupils except the very youngest. How far the details of these experiments should be suggested to the pupils, or rather how far they should be left to work out the problem for themselves, is a question to be settled by the teacher in each case. The better plan generally is to bring the problem in a very clear form before the whole class, or before the whole school, and ask whether anybody can think of a way in which it can be solved; for instance, in this case how can it be found out whether roots grow only at their tip or throughout their whole length. If the way is thought out by even a single pupil the rest will be interested in seeing whether the plan will work successfully.\"  [Footnote 1: Concerning a Few Common Plants, page 25.]  I have been more successful in pricking the roots than in marking them with a brush.  The caulicle can be proved by the manner of its growth to be of the nature of stem, not root. The main root grows from its naked end. Roots can also grow from the sides of the caulicle, as in Indian Corn. In this, it acts precisely as does the stem of a cutting. It can be prettily shown with the seedlings by breaking off a bean at the ground and putting the slip in water. It will throw out roots and the pupil will readily understand that the caulicle does the same thing.  Darwin has made very interesting experiments on the movements of seedlings. If the teacher wishes to repeat some of the experiments he will find the details very fully given in \"The Power of Movement of Plants.\"[1] The pupils can observe in their growing seedlings some of the points mentioned and have already noticed a few in their answers. They have said that the caulicle was the part to grow first, and have spoken of the arched form of the young stem. Their attention should also be drawn to the root-hairs, which are well seen in Corn, Wheat, and Oats. They absorb the liquid food of the plants. A secondary office is to hold the seed firmly, so that the caulicle can enter the ground. This is shown in Red Clover, which may be sown on the surface of the ground. It puts out root-hairs, which attach themselves to the particles of sand and hold the seed. These hairs are treated more fully in the lessons on roots.  [Footnote 1: The Power of Movement in Plants. By Charles Darwin. London. John Murray, 1880.]  [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. IV. Movements of Seedlings.]   5. _Leaves of Seedlings_.--Coming now to the question as to the number of leaves at each joint of the stem, the Morning-Glory, Sunflower, and Bean will present no difficulty, but probably all the pupils will be puzzled by the Pea. The stipules, so large and leaf-like, look like two leaves, with a stem between, bearing other opposite leaves, and terminating in a tendril, while in the upper part it could not be told by a beginner which was the continuation of the main stem. For these reasons I left this out in the questions on the Pea, but it should be taken up in the class. How are we to tell what constitutes a single leaf? The answer to this question is that buds come in the _axils_ of single leaves; that is, in the inner angle which the leaf makes with the stem. If no bud can be seen in the Pea, the experiment may be tried of cutting off the top of the seedling plant. Buds will be developed in the axils of the nearest leaves, and it will be shown that each is a compound leaf with two appendages at its base, called stipules, and with a tendril at its apex. Buds can be forced in the same way to grow from the axils of the lower scales, and even from those of the cotyledons, and the lesson may be again impressed that organs are capable of undergoing great modifications. The teacher may use his own judgment as to whether he will tell them that the tendril is a modified leaflet.  [Illustration: FIG. 9. 1. Grain of Indian Corn. 2. Vertical section, dividing the embryo, _a_, caulicle: _b_, cotyledon; _c_, plumule. 3. Vertical section, at right angles to the last.]   6. _Monocotyledons_.--These are more difficult. Perhaps it is not worth while to attempt to make the pupils see the embryo in Wheat and Oats. But the embryo of Indian Corn is larger and can be easily examined after long soaking. Removing the seed-covering, we find the greater part of the seed to be albumen. Closely applied to one side of this, so closely that it is difficult to separate it perfectly, is the single cotyledon. This completely surrounds the plumule and furnishes it with food from the albumen. There is a line down the middle, and, if we carefully bend back the edges of the cotyledon, it splits along this line, showing the plumule and caulicle within. The plumule consists of successive layers of rudimentary leaves, the outer enclosing the rest (Fig. 10, 1, _c_). The latter is the first leaf and remains undeveloped as a scaly sheath (Fig. 10, 2, _c_). In Wheat and Oats the cotyledon can be easily seen in the largest seedlings by pulling off the dry husk of the grain. The food will he seen to have been used up.  [Illustration: FIG. 10. 1. Germination of Indian corn. 2. Same more advanced. _a_, caulicle; _c_1, first leaf of the plumule, sheathing the rest; _c_2, second leaf; _c_3, third leaf of the plumule; _d_, roots.]  The series of Corn seedlings, at least, should be drawn as before and the parts marked, this time with their technical terms. The following questions should then be prepared.  CORN.  What are the parts of the seed?  Compare these parts with the Morning-Glory, Sunflower, Bean, and Pea.  Where is the food stored?  How many cotyledons have Corn, Wheat, and Oats?  How many have Bean, Pea, Morning-Glory, and Sunflower?  Compare the veins of the leaves of each class and see what difference you can find.  This will bring up the terms dicotyledon and monocotyledon. _Di_ means two, _mono_ means one. This"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10726"],["title","Outlines of Lessons in Botany, Part I; from Seed to Leaf (#4)"],["body","in the veins, netted in the first class, parallel in the second, is characteristic of the classes. Pupils should have specimens of leaves to classify under these two heads. Flowering plants are divided first into these two classes, the Dicotyledons and the Monocotyledons.  If Pine-seeds can be planted, the polycotyledonous embryo can also be studied.   7. _Food of seedlings_.--The food of the Wheat seedling may be shown in fine flour. [1]\"The flour is to be moistened in the hand and kneaded until it becomes a homogeneous mass. Upon this mass pour some pure water and wash out all the white powder until nothing is left except a viscid lump of gluten. This is the part of the crushed wheat-grains which very closely resembles in its composition the flesh of animals. The white powder washed away is nearly pure wheat-starch. Of course the other ingredients, such as the mineral matter and the like, might be referred to, but the starch at least should be shown. When the seed is placed in proper soil, or upon a support where it can receive moisture, and can get at the air and still be warm enough, a part of the starch changes into a sort of gum, like that on postage stamps, and finally becomes a kind of sugar. Upon this sirup the young seedling feeds until it has some good green leaves for work, and as we have seen in the case of some plants it has these very early.\"  [Footnote 1: Concerning a Few Common Plants, page 18.]  The presence of starch can be shown by testing with a solution of iodine. Starch is turned blue by iodine and may thus be detected in flour, in seeds, in potatoes, etc.  After all this careful experimental work the subject may be studied in the text-book and recited, the recitation constituting a thorough review of the whole.  A charming description of the germination of a seed will be found in the Reader. V. The Birth of Picciola.  _Gray's Lessons_. Sect. II, 8-14. III. _How Plants Grow_. Sect. I, 22, 23. II.     III  ROOTS.   This subject can be treated more conveniently while the young seedlings are still growing, because their roots are very suitable for study. It seems best, therefore, to take it up before examining the buds.   1. _Study of the Roots of Seedlings_.--One or two of the seedlings should be broken off and the slips put into a glass of water. They will be studied later. Bean and Sunflower are the best for the purpose.  Begin by telling the pupils to prepare for their first lesson a description of the roots of their seedlings. Those grown on sponge or paper will show the development of the root-hairs, while those grown on sand are better for studying the form of the root. Give them also some fleshy root to describe, as a carrot, or a radish; and a spray of English Ivy, as an example of aërial roots.  Throughout these lessons, the method is pursued of giving pupils specimens to observe and describe before teaching them botanical terms. It is better for them to name the things they see than to find examples for terms already learned. In the first case, they feel the difficulty of expressing themselves and are glad to have the want of exact terms supplied. This method is discouraging at first, especially to the younger ones; but, with time and patience, they will gradually become accustomed to describe whatever they can see. They have, at any rate, used their eyes; and, though they may not understand the real meaning of anything they have seen, they are prepared to discuss the subject intelligently when they come together in the class. If they will first write out their unassisted impressions and, subsequently, an account of the same thing after they have had a recitation upon it, they will be sure to gain something in the power of observation and clear expression. It cannot be too strongly urged that the number of facts that the children may learn is not of the slightest consequence, but that the teacher should aim to cultivate the quick eye, the ready hand, and the clear reason.  The root of the Morning-Glory is _primary_; it is a direct downward growth from the tip of the caulicle. It is about as thick as the stem, tapers towards the end, and has short and fibrous branches. In some plants the root keeps on growing and makes a _tap-root_; in the Bean, it soon becomes lost in the branches. These are all simple, that is, there is but one primary root. Sometimes there are several or many, and the root is then said to be _multiple_. The Pumpkin is an example of this. The root of the Pea is described in the older editions of Gray's Lessons as being multiple, but it is generally simple. Indian Corn, also, usually starts with a single root, but this does not make a tap-root, and is soon followed by many others from any part of the caulicle, or even from the stem above, giving it the appearance of having a multiple root.  The root of the Radish is different from any of these; it is _fleshy_. Often, it tapers suddenly at the bottom into a root like that of the Morning-Glory with some fibres upon it. It is, in fact, as the Morning-Glory would be if the main root were to be thickened up by food being stored in it. It is a primary tap-root. The radish is _spindle-shaped_, tapering at top and bottom, the carrot is _conical_, the turnip is called _napiform_; some radishes are shaped like the turnip.  The aërial roots of the English Ivy answer another purpose than that of giving nourishment to the plant. They are used to support it in climbing. These are an example of _secondary_ roots, which are roots springing laterally from any part of the stem. The Sweet Potato has both fleshy and fibrous roots and forms secondary roots of both kinds every year.[1] Some of the seedlings will probably show the root-hairs to the naked eye. These will be noticed hereafter.  [Footnote 1: Gray's Lessons, p. 35, Fig. 86.]  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--1. Tap-root. 2. Multiple root of Pumpkin. 3. Napiform root of Turnip. 4. Spindle-shaped root of Radish. 5. Conical root of Carrot. 6. Aërial roots of Ivy.]  It is my experience that pupils always like classifying things under different heads, and it is a good exercise. The following table may be made of the roots they have studied, adding other examples. Dr. Gray says that ordinary roots may be roughly classed into fibrous and fleshy.[1] Thomé classes them as woody and fleshy.[2]  [Footnote 1: Gray's Lessons, p. 34.]  [Footnote 2: Text-book of Structural and Physiological Botany. Otto Thomé. Translated and edited by Alfred W. Bennett, New York. John Wiley and Sons. 1877.

[Footnote 3: The Irish potato will very likely be mentioned as an example of a fleshy root. The teacher can say that this will be explained later.]   2. _Fleshy Roots_.--The scholars are already familiar with the storing of food for the seedling in or around the cotyledons, and will readily understand that these roots are storehouses of food for the plant. The Turnip, Carrot, and Beet are _biennials_; that is, their growth is continued through two seasons. In the first year, they make a vigorous growth of leaves alone, and the surplus food is carried to the root in the form of a syrup, and there stored, having been changed into starch, or something very similar. At the end of the first season, the root is filled with food, prepared for the next year, so that the plant can live on its reserve fund and devote its whole attention to flowering. These roots are often good food for animals. There are some plants that store their surplus food in their roots year after year, using up in each season the store of the former one, and forming new roots continually. The Sweet Potato is an example of this class. These are _perennials_. The food in perennials, however, is usually stored in stems, rather than in roots, as in trees. _Annuals_ are generally fibrous-rooted, and the plant dies after its first year. The following experiment will serve as an illustration of the way in which the food stored in fleshy roots is utilized for growth.  Cut off the tapering end of a carrot and scoop out the inside of the larger half in the form of a vase, leaving about half of the flesh behind. Put strings through the upper rim, fill the carrot cup with water, and hang it up in a sunny window. Keep it constantly full of water. The leaf-buds below will put forth, and grow into leafy shoots, which, turning upwards, soon hide the vase in a green circle. This is because the dry, starchy food stored in the carrot becomes soft and soluble, and the supply of proper food and the warmth of the room make the leaf-buds able to grow. It is also a pretty illustration of the way in which stems always grow upward, even though there is enough light and air for them to grow straight downwards. Why this is so, we do not know.   3. _Differences between the Stem and the Root.--_Ask the pupils to tell what differences they have found.  _Stems_.                           _Roots_.
