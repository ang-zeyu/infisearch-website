So great had been the pressure of work, that he had escaped much of the practical joking to which a new-comer on board ship, as at school, is generally subject.  He had for comrades four midshipmen; one of these, Simmons, had already nearly served his time, and was looking forward to the war as giving him a sure promotion; two others, Delafield and Hawtry, had already served for two or three years at sea, although only a year or so older than Jack, while the fourth, Herbert Coveney, was a year younger, and was, like Jack, a new hand. There were also in the berth two master's mates, young men of from twenty to two-and-twenty. With all of these Jack, with his high spirits, good-tempered face, merry laugh, soon became a favorite.  During the first two days at sea he had suffered the usual agonies from sea-sickness. But before reaching Gibraltar he had got his sea-legs and was regularly doing duty, being on the watch of the second lieutenant, Mr. Pierson.  The wind, which had blown strongly across the Bay of Biscay and down the coast of Portugal, moderated as the \"Falcon\" steamed past Cape St. Vincent with its picturesque monastery, and the straits were calm as a mill-pond as she slowly made her way along the Spanish coast and passed Tarifa. Up to the time when she dropped her anchor in the Bay of Gibraltar, the only incident which had happened on the way was that, as they steamed up the straits, they passed close by a homeward-bound P. and O. steamer, whose passengers crowded the sides, and cheered and waved their handkerchiefs to the eastward-bound ship.  The \"Falcon\" was not a fast vessel, seldom making, under favorable circumstances, more than eight knots an hour. She carried sixteen guns, twelve of which were eighteen-pounders. It had been intended that the \"Falcon\" should only stay a few hours at Gibraltar, proceeding immediately she had taken in a fresh supply of coal. The engineers, however, reported several defects in her machinery, which would take three or four days to put in order.  Jack was pleased at the delay, as he was anxious to set his foot for the first time ashore in a foreign country, and to visit the famous fortifications of the Rock. The first day he did not ask for leave, as he did not wish to presume upon his being the first lieutenant's relation.  Charles Hethcote differed widely from the typical first lieutenant of fiction, a being as stiff as a ramrod, and as dangerous to approach as a polar bear. He was, indeed, a bright, cheery fellow, and although he was obliged to surround himself with a certain amount of official stiffness, he was a great favorite among officers and crew.  It was not till the third day of his stay that Jack, his seniors having all been ashore, asked for leave, which was at once granted. Young Coveney, too, had landed on the previous day, and Hawtry, whom Jack was inclined to like most of his shipmates, now accompanied him. They had leave for the whole day, and, as soon as breakfast was over, they went ashore.  \"What a rum old place!\" Hawtry said, as they wandered along the principal street. \"It looks as Spanish as ever. Who would have thought that it had been an English town for goodness knows how long?\"  \"I wish I had paid a little more attention to history,\" Jack said. \"It makes one feel like a fool not to know such things as that when one comes to a famous place like this. Look at that tall fellow with the two little donkeys. Poor little brutes, they can scarcely stagger under their loads. There is a pretty girl with that black thing over her head, a mantilla don't they call it? There is a woman with oranges, let's get some. Now, I suppose, the first thing is to climb up to the top of the Rock.\"  With their pockets full of oranges, the boys started on their climb, which was accomplished in capital time. From the flagstaff they enjoyed the magnificent view of the African coast across the straits, of Spain stretching away to their right, of the broad expanse of the blue Mediterranean, and of the bay with its ships, and the \"Falcon\" dwarfed to the dimensions of a toy vessel, at their feet. Then they came down, paid a flying visit to the various fortifications and to the galleries, whence the guns peer out threateningly across the low, sandy spit, known as the neutral ground.  When all this was finished, it was only natural that they should go to the principal hotel and eat a prodigious luncheon, and then Hawtry proposed that they should sally out for a ramble into Spain.  They had been disappointed in the oranges, which they found in no way better than those which they had bought in England. But they thought that if they could pick them off the trees, they must somehow have a superior flavor. Accordingly they sallied out by the land gate, passed unquestioned through the line of British sentries, and were soon in the little village inside the Spanish lines.  \"It's awfully hot,\" Hawtry said, mopping his forehead. \"Who would have thought that it would have been so hot as this in any place in Europe in the middle of February? Just fancy what it must be here in July! Look, there is a fellow with two mules. I expect he would let them. I vote we go for a ride. It's too hot for walking altogether.  \"I say, old boy,\" he said, approaching a tall and powerfully-built man, who was smoking a cigar, and leaning lazily against one of his mules; \"you let mules, we hire them, eh?\"  The Spaniard opened his eyes somewhat, but made no reply, and continued to smoke tranquilly.  \"Oh, nonsense,\" Hawtry said. \"Look here.\"  And he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out some silver. Then he made signs of mounting one of the mules, and waved his hand over the surrounding country to signify that he wanted a general ride.  The Spaniard nodded, held up five fingers, and touched one of the mules, and did the same with the other.  \"He wants five shillings a head,\" Hawtry said.  \"I don't know,\" Jack said doubtfully. \"I don't suppose he knows much about shillings. It may be five dollars or five anything else. We'd better show him five shillings, and come to an understanding that that is what he means before we get on.\"  The Spaniard, on being shown the five shillings, shook his head, and pointing to a dollar which they had obtained in change on shore, signified that these were the coins he desired.  \"Oh, nonsense!\" Hawtry said indignantly. \"You don't suppose we're such fools as to give you a pound apiece for two or three hours' ride on those mules of yours. Come on, Jack. We won't put up with being swindled like that.\"  So saying the two lads turned away, and started on their walk.  While they were speaking to the Spaniard, he had been joined by one of his countrymen, and when they turned away, these entered into a rapid conversation together. The result was, that before the boys had gone thirty yards, the Spaniard with the mules called them back again, and intimated that he accepted their terms.  They were about to jump up at once, but the man signed to them to stop, and his companion in a minute or two had brought out two rough rugs which were secured with some cords over the wooden saddles.  \"That's an improvement,\" Jack said. \"I was just wondering how we were going to sit on those things, which are not saddles at all, but only things for boxes and barrels to be fastened to.\"  \"I wonder which way we'd better go,\" Hawtry said, as he climbed up with some difficulty, aided by the Spaniard, on to one of the mules. \"My goodness, Jack, this is horribly uncomfortable. I never can stand this. Hi, there! help me down. It would be better a hundred times to ride barebacked.\"  Accordingly the saddles were taken off, the rugs folded and secured on the animals' backs by a rope passed round them, and then the boys again took their seats.  \"I hope the brutes are quiet,\" Jack said, \"for I am nothing of a rider at the best of times, and one feels an awful height at the top of these great mules, with one's legs dangling without stirrups.\"  \"If you find yourself going, Jack,\" Hawtry said, \"the best thing is to catch hold of his ears. Come on, let's get out of this. All the village is staring at us.\"  The mules, upon the reins being jerked, and boys' heels briskly applied to their ribs, moved on at a fast walk.  \"We shall have to stop under a tree and cut a stick presently,\" Hawtry said. \"It will not do to get down, for I should never be able to climb up again. Mind, we must take our bearings carefully, else we shall never get back again. We have neither chart nor compass. Hallo! here comes the mules' master.\"  They had by this time gone two or three hundred yards from the village, and, behind them, at a brisk trot, seated on a diminutive donkey, was the Spaniard.  \"Perhaps it's best he should come,\" Jack said. \"There will be no fear of being lost then, and if one of us gets capsized, he can help him up again.\"  Upon the Spaniard coming up to them, he gave a sharp shout to the mules, at the same time striking the donkey on which he rode with a stick. Instantly the mules, recognizing the signal, started into a sharp trot, the first effect of which was to tumble Hawtry from his seat into the road, Jack with difficulty saving himself by clutching wildly at the mane.  \"Confound it!\" Hawtry exclaimed furiously, as he regained his feet, to the Spaniard. \"Why didn't you say what you were going to be up to? Starting the ship ahead at full speed without notice! I believe I've broken some of my ribs. Don't you laugh too soon, Jack. It will be your turn next.\"  The Spaniard helped Hawtry to regain his seat, and they were soon clattering along the dusty road at a brisk rate, the boys quickly getting accustomed to the pace, which, indeed, was smooth and easy. For hours they rode on, sometimes trotting, sometimes walking, taking no heed whither they were going, and enjoying the novelty of the ride, the high cactus hedges, the strange vegetation, little villages here and there, sometimes embowered in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11058"],["title","Jack Archer: A Tale of the Crimea (#3)"],["body","trees, and paying no heed to time.  Presently Jack exclaimed,--  \"I say, Hawtry, it must be getting late. We have been winding and turning about, and I have not an idea how far we are now from Gib. We must be through the gates by gun-fire, you know.\"  They stopped, and by pantomime explained to the Spaniard that they wanted to get back again as soon as possible.  He nodded, made a circle with his arm, and, as they understood, explained that they were making a circuit, and would arrive ere long at their starting-place.  For another hour and a half they rode along, chatting gayly.  \"I say, Jack,\" Hawtry exclaimed suddenly, \"why, there's the sun pretty nearly down, and here we are among the hills, in a lonelier looking place than we have come to yet. I don't believe we're anywhere near Gib. I say, old fellow, it strikes me we're getting into a beastly mess. What on earth's to be done?\"  They checked their mules, and looked at each other.  \"What can the Spaniard's game be, Hawtry? We've had a good five shillings' worth.\"  \"Let us take our own bearings,\" Hawtry said. \"The sun now is nearly on our left. Well, of course, that is somewhere about west-sou-west, so we must be going northward. I don't think that can be right. I'm sure it can't. Look here, you fellow, there is the sun setting there\"--and he pointed to it--\"Gibraltar must lie somewhere over there, and that's the way we mean to go.\"  The Spaniard looked surly, then he pointed to the road ahead, and indicated that it bent round the next spur of the hill, and made a detour in the direction in which Hawtry indicated that Gibraltar must lie.  \"What on earth shall we do, Jack? If this fellow means mischief, we are in an awkward fix. I don't suppose he intends to attack us, because we with our dirks would be a match for him with that long knife of his. But if he means anything, he has probably got some other fellows with him.\"  \"Then hadn't we better go in for him at once,\" Jack said, \"before he gets any one to help him?\"  Hawtry laughed.  \"We can hardly jump off our mules and attack him without any specific reason. We might get the worst of it, and even if we didn't how should we get back again, and how should we account for having killed our mule-driver? No. Whatever we are in for, we must go through with it now, Jack. Let us look as though we trusted him.\"  So saying, they continued on the road by which they had previously travelled.  \"I don't believe,\" Hawtry said, after a short silence, \"that they can have any idea of cutting our throats. Midshipmen are not in the habit of carrying much money about with them, but I have heard of Guerillas carrying people off to the mountains and getting ransoms. There, we are at the place where that fellow said the road turned. It doesn't turn. Now, I vote we both get off our mules and decline to go a step farther.\"  \"All right,\" Jack said. \"I shall know a good deal better what I am doing on my feet than I shall perched up here!\"  The two boys at once slid off their mules to the ground.  \"There is no turning there,\" Hawtry said, turning to the hill. \"You have deceived us, and we won't go a foot farther,\" and turning, the lads started to walk back along the road they had come.  The Spaniard leapt from his donkey, and with angry gesticulation endeavored to arrest them. Finding that they heeded not his orders, he put his hand on his knife, but in a moment the boys' dirks flashed in the air.  \"Now, my lad,\" Hawtry said. \"Two can play at that game, and if you draw that knife, we'll let daylight into you.\"  The Spaniard hesitated, then drew back and gave a loud, shrill whistle which was, the boys fancied, answered in the distance.  \"Come on, Jack. We must run for it. We can leave this lumbering Spaniard behind, I have no doubt,\" and sheathing their dirks, the boys set off at full speed.  The Spaniard appeared inclined to follow them, but distrusting his powers, he paused, gave a long, shrill whistle, twice repeated, and then mounted his donkey and driving the mules before him, he followed the boys at a hand gallop.  They had, however, a good start, and maintained their advantage.  \"I don't think,\" Jack said, \"we have passed a village for the last hour. When we get to one, we'd better rush into a house, and ask for shelter. These fellows will hardly dare to touch us there.\"  Had the race been simply between the boys and their immediate pursuer, it is probable that they would have won it, for they were light, active, and in good condition, while the animals behind them had already been travelling for five hours, at a rate considerably above the speed to which they were accustomed. The road, however, was an exceedingly winding one, which gave time to the confederates of the mule-driver to make a short cut, and, as the boys turned a sharp corner, they saw three men barring the road in front.  \"It's all up, Jack,\" Hawtry said, pausing in his run. \"It's no use making any resistance. We should only get our throats cut straight off.\"  Jack agreed, and they walked up to the men in front just as the muleteer came galloping up with his troupe.  \"What do you want with us?\" Hawtry said, advancing to the men.  There was a volley of maledictions at the run they had given them. The boys were seized by the collar, their dirks, watches, and money roughly taken from them, their arms tied to their sides by the ropes taken from the mules, and they were motioned to accompany their captors. These at once left the road and struck up the hill, the muleteer proceeding along the road with the animals.  With their arms tied, the boys found it hard work to keep up with their captors, who strode along with long steps. The sun had by this time sunk, and presently they heard the distant boom of the sunset gun from Gibraltar.  \"That gun must be fifteen miles away,\" Hawtry said. \"What fools we have been, Jack, to be sure!\"  In one of the three men who accompanied them they recognized the peasant who had spoken to the muleteer when he refused to accept their first offer, and they had no doubt that he had arranged with the man to lead them to a certain spot, to which he had proceeded direct, while their guide had conducted them by a circuitous route.  They walked for four hours without a pause, ever ascending among the hills, until they at last reached a sort of plateau, upon which some six or eight men were gathered round a fire. Upon three sides the hill rose abruptly, on the fourth the ground sloped away, and in front, seemingly almost at their feet, some 2000 feet below them stretched away the waters of the Mediterranean, sparkling in the moonlight.  \"They have got something to eat that smells nice,\" Jack said, as they approached the fire. \"I hope to goodness they are going to give us some. I feel awfully peckish.\"  The men gathered round the fire rose at the approach of the new-comers, and an animated conversation took place. Then the boys were motioned to sit down, and the rest threw themselves round the fire. Some meat which was roasting on a rough spit over it was taken off, and one of the men undid the cords which tied their arms, and a share of the meat was given them.  \"This is stunning,\" Jack said. \"What on earth is it? It does not taste to me like mutton, or beef, or pork, or veal.\"  \"I fancy it's kid,\" Hawtry said. \"Well, it is evident they have no idea of cutting our throats. If they had been going to do that, they would have done it a quarter of a mile after we left the road. I suppose they are going to try to get a ransom for us. Where it's coming from as far as I'm concerned, I don't know, for my father is a clergyman, and has as much as he can do to make ends meet, for there are eight of us and I'm the eldest.\"  \"It's an awful fix altogether,\" Jack said. \"And anyhow, we shall lose our ship and get into a frightful row, and, if somebody won't pay our ransom, I suppose they will knock us on the head finally. The best thing, you know, will be for us to make our escape.\"  \"But how on earth are we to do that?\" Hawtry said. \"There are ten of them, and I see a lot of guns piled there.\"  \"Oh, I daresay we shall see some chance,\" Jack said cheerfully. \"We must think it over. Jack Easy, Peter Simple, and all those fellows used to get into worse scrapes than this, and they always managed to get out of them somehow; so why shouldn't we? The best thing is, just to think what one of them would have done if he had been in our place. I wish to goodness that we had Mesty prowling about somewhere; he would get us out in no time.\"  Hawtry answered with a grunt, and devoted himself to his kid. Presently Jack spoke again.  \"Look here, Hawtry, I vote that to begin with we both pretend to be in an awful funk. If they think that we are only two frightened boys, they won't keep as sharp a watch over us as if they thought we were determined fellows, likely to attempt our escape. There is the sea down there in front of us, and there are sure to be villages on the coast. Therefore we shall know which way to go if we once manage to escape, and, if we can get down there, we can either claim the protection of the head man in the village, or we can take a boat and make off to sea.\"  When the meal was over, one of the men, who appeared to be the leader, rose and come to the boys. Pointing to himself, he said, \"Pedro,\" to another \"Sancho,\" to a third \"Garcia.\"  \"He wants to know our names,\" Jack said, and pointing to his companion, he said, \"Hawtry,\" and to himself \"Archer.\"  The Spaniard nodded and resumed his seat, when an animated conversation took place. Jack, in the meantime, began to enact the part which he had arranged, turning over upon his face, and at times making a loud, sobbing noise.  Hawtry, after hesitating for some time, seconded his efforts by burying his face in his hands, and appearing also to give way to violent grief.     CHAPTER III.   THE ESCAPE  Shortly after the meal was over, the brigands rose. The boys were again bound, and were laid down on the"]]]
