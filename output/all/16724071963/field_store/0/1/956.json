P. Bénézet          SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS, EVANSVILLE, INDIANA  [Illustration: The Peace Palace at the Hague]     Preface   This little volume is the result of the interest shown by pupils, teachers, and the general public in a series of talks on the causes of the great European war which were given by the author in the fall of 1914. The audiences were widely different in character. They included pupils of the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, students in high school and normal school, teachers in the public schools, an association of business men, and a convention of boards of education. In every case, the same sentiment was voiced: “If there were only some book which would give us these facts in simple language and illustrate them by maps and charts as you have done!” After searching the market for a book of this sort without success, the author determined to put the subject of his talks into manuscript form. It has been his aim to write in a style which is well within the comprehension of the children in the upper grades and yet is not too juvenile for adult readers. The book deals with the remarkable sequence of events in Europe which made the great war inevitable. Facts are revealed which, so far as the author knows, have not been published in any history to date; facts which had the strongest possible bearing on the outbreak of the war. The average American, whether child or adult, has little conception of conditions in Europe. In America all races mix. The children of the Polish Jew mingle with those of the Sicilian, and in the second generations both peoples have become Americans. Bohemians intermarry with Irish, Scotch with Norwegians. In Europe, on the other hand, Czech and Teuton, Bulgar and Serb may live side by side for centuries without mixing or losing their distinct racial characteristics. In order that the American reader may understand the complicated problem of European peace, a study of races and languages is given in the text, showing the relationship of Slav, Celt, Latin, and Teuton, and the various sub-divisions of these peoples. A knowledge of these facts is very essential to any understanding of the situation in Europe. The author has pointed out the fact that political boundaries are largely king-made, and that they have seldom been drawn with regard to the natural division of Europe by nationalities, or to the wishes of the mass of the population.  The chapter, entitled “Europe as it Should Be,” with its accompanying map, shows the boundaries of the various nations as they would look if the bulk of the people of each nationality were included in a single political division. In many places, it is, of course, impossible to draw sharp lines. Greek shades off into Bulgar on one side and into Skipetar and Serb on the other. Prague, the capital of the Czechs, is one-third German in its population. There are large islands of Germans and Magyars in the midst of the Roumanians of Transylvania. These are a few examples out of many which could be cited. However, the general aim of the chapter has been to divide the continent into nations, in each of which the leading race would vastly predominate in population.  It is hoped that the study of this little work will not only throw light upon the causes of war in general, but will also reveal its cruelty and its needlessness. It is shown that the history of Europe from the time of the great invasions by the Germanic tribes has been a continuous story of government without the consent of the governed.  A preventive for wars, such as statesmen and philanthropists in many countries have urged, is outlined in the closing chapter. It would seem as though after this terrible demonstration of the results of armed peace, the governments of the world would be ready to listen to some plan which would forever forbid the possibility of another war. Just as individuals in the majority of civilized countries discovered, a hundred years ago, that it was no longer necessary for them to carry weapons in order to insure their right to live and to enjoy protection, so nations may learn at last that peace and security are preferable to the fruits of brigandage and aggression. The colonies of America, after years of jealousy and small differences, followed by a tremendous war, at last learned this lesson. In the same way the states of Europe will have to learn it. The stumbling blocks in the way are the remains of feudal government in Europe and the ignorance and short-sightedness of the common people in many countries. Ignorance is rapidly waning with the advance of education, and we trust that feudalism will not long survive its last terrible crime, the world war of 1914.  Now that the United States has become a belligerent, it is very essential that our people understand the events that led up to our participation in the war. So many of our citizens are of a peace-loving nature, we are so far removed from the militarism of continental Europe, and the whole war seems so needless and so profitless to those who have not studied carefully its causes, that there is danger of a want of harmony with the program of the government if all are not taught the simple truth of the matter. There is no quicker channel through which to reach all the people than the public schools. With this in mind, two entire chapters and part of a third are devoted to demonstrating why no other course was open to this country than to accept the war which was forced upon her.  In the preparation of this little work, the author has received many helpful suggestions from co-workers. His thanks are especially due to Professor A. G. Terry of Northwestern University and Professor A. H. Sanford of the Wisconsin State Normal School at La Crosse, who were kind enough to read through and correct the manuscript before its final revision. The author is especially indebted to the Committee on Public Information at Washington, D. C., for furnishing to him authoritative data on many phases of the war. Acknowledgment is also made to Row, Peterson and Company for kind permission to use illustrations from _History Stories of Other Lands_; also to the International Film Service, Inc., of New York City for the use of many valuable copyright illustrations of scenes relating to the great war.

The Great War        The call from Europe.—Friend against friend.—Why?—Death and       devastation.—No private quarrel.—Ordered by government.—What       makes government?—The influence of the past.—Four causes of war.         Among the bricklayers at work on a building which was being       erected in a great American city during the summer of 1914 were       two men who had not yet become citizens of the United States.       Born abroad, they still owed allegiance, one to the Emperor of       Austria, the other to the Czar of Russia.  Meeting in a new country, and using a new language which gave them a chance to understand each other, they had become well acquainted. They were members of the same labor union, and had worked side by side on several different jobs. In the course of time, a firm friendship had sprung up between them. Suddenly, on the same day, each was notified to call at the office of the agent of his government in the city. Next morning the Russian came to his boss to explain that he must quit work, that he had been called home to fight for the “Little Father” of the Russians. He found his chum, the Austrian, there ahead of him, telling that he had to go, for the Russians had declared war on Austria and the good Kaiser,[1] Franz Josef, had need of all his young men.   [1] In the German language, the title Kaiser means Emperor.        The two chums stared at each other in sorrow and dismay. The       pitiless arm of the god of war had reached across the broad       Atlantic, plucking them back from peace and security. With       weapons put into their hands they would be ordered to kill each       other on sight.        A last hand-clasp, a sorrowful “Good luck to you,” and they       parted.        Why was this necessary? What was this irresistible force, strong       enough to separate the two friends and drag them back five       thousand miles for the purpose of killing each other? To answer       these two questions is the purpose of this little volume.        Beginning with the summer of 1914, Europe and parts of Asia and       Africa were torn and racked with the most tremendous war that the       world has ever seen. Millions of men were killed. Other millions       were maimed, blinded, or disfigured for life. Still other       millions were herded into prison camps or forced to work like       convict laborers. Millions of homes were filled with grief.       Millions of women were forced to do hard work which before the       war had been considered beyond their power. Millions of children       were left fatherless. What had been the richest and most       productive farming land in Europe was made a barren waste.       Thousands of villages and towns were utterly destroyed and their       inhabitants were forced to flee, the aged, the sick, and the       infants alike.        In many cases, as victorious armies swept through Poland and       Serbia, the wretched inhabitants fled before them, literally       starving, because all food had been seized for the use of       fighting men. Dreadful diseases, which cannot exist where people       have the chance to bathe and keep themselves clean, once more       appeared, sweeping away hundreds of thousands of victims. The       strongest, healthiest, bravest men of a dozen different nations       were shot down by the millions or left to drag out a miserable       existence, sick or crippled for life. Silent were the wheels in       many factories which once turned out the comforts and luxuries of       civilization. There were no men to make toys for the children, or       to work for mankind’s happiness. The only mills and factories       which were running full time were those that turned out the tools       of destruction and shot and shell for the guns. Nations poured       out one hundred fifty million dollars a day for the purpose of       killing off the best men in Europe. Had the world gone mad? What       was the reason for it all?  [Illustration: Fleeing from their Homes, around which a Battle is Raging]        In 1913 Germans traveled in Russia and Englishmen traveled in       Germany freely and safely. Germans were glad to trade with       intercourse Russians, and happy to have Englishmen spend their       money in Germany. France and Austria exchanged goods and their       inhabitants traveled within each other’s boundaries. A Frenchman       might go anywhere through Germany and be welcomed. There was       nothing to make the average German hate the average Englishman or       Belgian. The citizen of Austria and the citizen of Russia could       meet and find plenty of ground for friendship.        We cannot explain this war, then, on the grounds of race hatred.       One can imagine that two men living side by side and seeing each       other every day might have trouble and grow to hate each other,       but in this great war soldiers were shooting down other soldiers       whom they had never seen before, with whom they had never       exchanged a word, and it would not profit them if they killed a       whole army of their opponents. In many cases, the soldiers did       not see the men whom they were killing. An officer with a       telescope watched where the shells from the cannon were falling       and telephoned to the captain in charge to change the aim a       trifle for his next shots. The men put in the projectile, closed       and fired the gun. Once in a while, a shell from the invisible       enemy, two, three, or four miles away, fell among them, killing       and wounding. When a regiment of Austrians were ordered to charge       the Russian trenches, they shot and bayoneted the Russians       because they were told to do so by their officers, and the       Russian soldiers shot the Austrians because their captains so       ordered them. The officers on each side were only obeying orders       received from their generals. The generals were only obeying       orders from the government.        In the end, then, we come back to the governments, and we wonder       what has caused these nations to fly at each other’s throats. The       question arises as to what makes up a government or why a       government has the right to rule its people.        In the United States, the government officials are simply the       servants of the people. Practically every man in our country,       unless he is a citizen of some foreign nation, has a right to       vote, and in many of the states women, too, have a voice in the       government. We, the people of the United States, can choose our       own lawmakers, can instruct them how to vote and, in some states,       can vote out of existence any law that they the people have made       which we do not like. In all states, we can show our disapproval       of what our law-makers have done by voting against them at the       next election. Such is the government of a republic, a       “government of the people, by the people, and for the people,” as       Abraham Lincoln called it. In the leading British colonies, the       people rule. Australian citizens voted against forcing men to       serve in the army. The result was very close and the vote of the       women helped to decide it. Canada, on the contrary, voted to       compel her men to go. How is it in Europe? Have the people of       Germany or Austria the right to vote on war? Were they consulted       before their governments called them to arms and sent them to       fight each other? It is plain that in order to understand what       this war is about, we must look into the story of how the       different governments of Europe came to be and learn why their       peoples obey them so unquestioningly.        We must remember that government by the people is a very new       thing. One hundred and thirty years ago, even in the United       States only about one-fourth of the men had the right to vote.       These were citizens of property and wealth. They did not think a       poor man was worth considering. In England, a country which       allows its people more voice in the government than almost any       other nation in Europe, it is only within the last thirty years       that all men could vote. There are some European countries, like       Turkey, where the people have practically no power at all and       others, like Austria, where they have very little voice in how       they shall be governed.        For over a thousand years, the men of Europe have obeyed without       thinking when their lords and kings have ordered them to pick up       their weapons and go to war. In many instances they have known       nothing of the causes of the conflict or of what they were       fighting for. A famous English writer has written a poem which       illustrates how little the average citizen has ever known       concerning the cause of war, and shows the difference between the       way in which war was looked upon by the men of old and the way in       which one should regard it. The poem runs as follows:  The Battle of Blenheim  It was a summer evening,     Old Kaspar’s work was done, And he before his cottage door     Was sitting in the sun, And by him sported on the green His little grandchild Wilhelmine.  She saw her brother Peterkin     Roll something large and round, Which he beside the rivulet     In playing there had found, He came to ask what he had found That was so large"]]]
