Cora, his wife, stood beside him, looking smilingly down in his face, while her left hand toyed with a stray ringlet that would protrude itself from beneath her husband's cap.  \"Cora, are you sorry that we came into this wild country?\"  The smile on her face grew more radiant, as she shook her head without speaking. She was in that pleasant, dreamy state, in which it seems an effort to speak--so much so that she avoided it until compelled to do so by some direct question.  \"You are perfectly contented--happy, are you?\"  Again the same smile, as she answered in the affirmative by an inclination of the head.  \"You would not change it for a residence at home with your own people if you could?\"  The same sweet denial in pantomime.  \"Do you not become lonely sometimes, Cora, hundreds of miles away from the scenes of your childhood?\"  \"Have I not my husband and boy?\" she asked, half reproachfully, as the tears welled up in her eyes. \"Can I ask more?\"  \"I have feared sometimes, when I've been in the village, that perhaps you were lonely and sorrowful, and often I have hurried my footsteps that I might be with you a few moments sooner. When preaching and talking to the Indians, my thoughts would wander away to you and the dear little fellow there. And what husband could prevent them?\" said Harvey, impulsively, as he drew his wife to him, and kissed her again and again.  \"You must think of the labor before you.\"  \"There is scarcely a moment of my life in which I don't, but it is impossible to keep you and him from my mind. I am sorry that I am compelled to leave you alone so often. It seems to me that Teddy has acted in a singular manner of late. He is absent every afternoon. He says he goes hunting and yet he rarely, if ever, brings anything back with him.\"  \"Yesterday he returned shortly after you left, and acted so oddly, I did not know what to make of him. He appeared very anxious to keep me at a distance, but once he came close enough for me to catch his breath, and if it did not reveal the fumes of liquor then I was never more mistaken in my life.\"  \"Impossible! where could he obtain it?\"  \"The question I asked myself and which I could not answer; nevertheless his manner and the evidence of his own breath proved it beyond all doubt to my mind. You have noticed how set he is every afternoon about going away in the woods. Such was not his custom, and I think makes it certain some unusual attraction calls him forth.\"  \"What can it all mean?\" asked the missionary of himself. \"No; it cannot be that he brought any of the stuff with him and concealed it in the boat. It must have been discovered.\"  \"Every article that came with us is in this house.\"  \"Then some one must furnish him with it, and who now can it be?\"  \"Are there not some of your people who are addicted to the use of liquor?\"  \"Alas! there are too many who cannot withstand the tempter; but I never yet heard of an Indian who knew how to _make_ it. It is only when they visit some of the ports, or the Red river settlement, that they obtain it. Or perhaps a trader may come this way, and bring it with him.\"  \"And could not Teddy have obtained his of such a man?\"  \"There has been none here since last autumn, and then those who visited the village had no liquor with them. They always come to the village first so that I could not avoid learning of their presence. Let me see, he has been away since morning?\"  \"Yes; he promised an early return.\"  \"He will probably make his appearance in the course of an hour or so. Watch him closely. I will be back sooner to-day, and we shall probe this matter to the bottom. Good-by!\"  Again he embraced his wife, and then strode rapidly across the Clearing in the direction of the woods. His wife watched his form winding in and out among the trees, until it finally disappeared from view; and then, waiting a few moments longer, as if loth to withdraw her gaze from the spot where she had last seen him, she finally turned within the house to engage in her domestic duties.  The thrifty housewife has seldom an idle moment on her hands, and Cora passed hither and thither, performing the numerous little acts that were not much in themselves, but collectively were necessary, if not indispensable, in her household management. Occasionally she paused and bent over her child, that lay sleeping on the bed, and like a fond mother, could not restrain herself from softly touching her lips to its own, although it was at the imminent risk of awaking it.  An hour passed. She went to the door and looked out to see whether Teddy was in sight; but the woods were as silent as if they contained no living thing. Far away over the river, nearly opposite the Indian village, she saw two canoes crossing the stream, resembling ordinary-sized water-birds in the distance. These, so in harmony with the lazy, sunshiny afternoon, were all that gave evidence that man had ever invaded this solitude.  Cora Richter could but be cheerful, and, as she moved to and fro, she sung a hymn, one that was always her husband's favorite. She sung it unconsciously, from her very blithesomeness of spirits, not knowing she was making music which the birds themselves might have envied.  All at once her ear caught the sound of a footstep, and confident that Teddy had come, she turned her face toward the door to greet him. She uttered a slight scream, as she saw, instead of the honest Hibernian, the form of a towering, painted savage, glaring in upon her.  Ordinarily such a visitor would have occasioned her no surprise or alarm. In fact, it was rare that a day passed without some Indian visiting the cabin--either to consult with the missionary himself, or merely to rest a few moments. Sometimes several called together, and it often happened that they came while none but the wife was at home. They were always treated kindly, and were respectful and pleased in turn. During the nights in winter, when the storm howled through the forest, a light burned at the missionary's window, and many a savage, who belonged often to a distant tribe, had knocked at the door and secured shelter until morning. Ordinarily we say, then, the visit of an Indian gave the young wife no alarm.  But there was something in the appearance of this painted sinewy savage that filled her with dread. There was a treacherous look in his black eyes, and a sinister expression visible in spite of vermilion and ocher, that made her shrink from him, as she would have shrunk from some loathsome monster.  As the reader may have surmised, he was no other than Daffodil or Mahogany, who had left Teddy on purpose to visit the cabin, while both the servant and his master were absent. In spite of the precaution used, he had taken more liquor than he intended; and, as a consequence, was just in that reckless state of mind, when he would have hesitated at no deed, however heinous. From a jovial, good-natured Indian, in the company of the Hibernian, he was transformed into a sullen, vindictive savage in the presence of the gentle wife of Harvey Richter. He supported himself against the door and seemed undecided whether to enter or not. The alarm of Cora Richter was so excessive that she endeavored to conceal it.  \"What do you wish?\" she asked.  \"Where Misser Richter?\"  \"Gone to the village,\" she replied, bravely resolving that no lie should cross her lips if her life depended upon it.  \"When come back?\"  \"In an hour or so perhaps.\"  \"Where Ted?\"  \"He has gone hunting.\"  \"Big lie--he drunk--don't know nothing--lay sleep on ground.\"  \"How do you know? Did you see him?\"  \"Me gib him fire-water--much like it--drink good deal--tumble over like tree hain't got root.\"  \"Did you ever give it him before?\" asked the young wife, her curiosity supplanting her alarm for the moment.  \"Gib him offin--gib him every day--much like it--drink much.\"  Again the wife's instinctive fear came back to her, and she endeavored to conceal it by a calm, unimpassioned exterior.  \"Won't you come in and rest yourself until Mr. Richter returns?\"  \"Don't want to see him,\" replied the savage, sullenly.  \"Who do you wish to see then?\"  \"You--t'ink much of you.\"  The wife felt as if she would sink to the floor. There was something in the tones of his voice that had alarmed her from the first. She was almost certain this savage intended rudeness, now that he knew the missionary himself was gone. She glanced up at the rifle which was hung above the fireplace. It was charged, and she had learned how to fire it since her marriage. Several times she was on the point of springing up and seizing it and placing herself upon the defensive. Her heart throbbed wildly at the thought, but she finally concluded to resort to such an act only at the last moment. She might still conciliate the Indian by kindness, and after all, perhaps he meditated no harm or rudeness.  \"Come and sit down then, and talk with me awhile,\" said she, as pleasantly as it was possible.  The savage stumbled forward a few feet, and dropped into a seat, where he glared fully a minute straight into the face of the woman. This was the most trying ordeal of all, especially when she raised her own blue eyes, and addressed him. It seemed impossible to combat the fierce light of those orbs, although she bore their scrutiny like a heroine. He had seated himself near the door, but he was close enough for her to detect the fumes of the liquor he had drank, and she knew a savage was never so dangerous as when in a half-intoxicated condition.  \"Have you come a long distance?\" she asked.  \"Good ways--live up north.\"  \"You are not a Sioux, then?\"  \"No--don't like Sioux--bad people.\"  \"Why do you come in their neighborhood--in their country?\"  \"'Cause I want to--_come see you_.\"  \"You must come again--\"  At this juncture, the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11151"],["title","The Lost Trail (#8)"],["body","in the cradle awoke and began crying. The face of the savage assumed an expression of ferocity, and he said, abruptly:  \"Stop noise--me tomahawk if don't.\"  As he spoke he laid his hand in a threatening manner upon his tomahawk, and the mother sprung up and lifted the infant in her arms for the purpose of pacifying it. The dreadful threat had almost unnerved her, for she believed the savage would carry it out upon the slightest pretext. But before that tomahawk should reach her child, the mother must be stricken to the earth. She pressed it convulsively to her breast, and it quickly ceased its cries. She waited until it closed its eyes in slumber and then some impulse prompted her to lay it upon the bed, and to place herself between it and the Indian, so that she might be unimpeded in her movements if the savage should attempt harm to her or her offspring.  Several moments now passed without the Indian speaking. The interval was occupied by him in looking around the room and examining every portion upon which it was possible to rest his gaze. The survey completed, he once more fixed his scrutiny upon the young wife, and suddenly spoke in his sententious, abrupt manner.  \"Want sunkin eat.\"  This question was a relief, for it afforded the wife an opportunity of expressing her kindness; but, at the same time, it caused a more rapid beating of her heart, since to procure what was asked, she would be compelled to pass out of the door, and thus not only approach him much more closely than she was willing, but it would be necessary to leave him alone with her infant until her return.  She was in a painful dilemma, to decide whether it was best to refuse the visitor's request altogether or to comply with it, trusting to Providence to protect them both. A casual glance at the Indian convinced her that it would be dangerous to thwart his wishes longer; and, with an inward prayer to God, she arose and approached the door. As she passed near him, he moved and she involuntarily quickened her step, until she was outside. The Indian did not follow, and she hurried on her errand.  She had gone scarcely a yard, when she heard him walking across the floor, and detected at the same moment, the cry of her infant. Fairly beside herself with terror, she ran back in the house, and saw the savage taking down her husband's rifle. The revulsion of her feelings brought tears to her eyes, and she said:  \"I wish you would go away, I don't like you.\"  \"Kiss me--den I go!\" said he, stepping toward her.  \"Keep away! keep away!\" she screamed, retreating to the door and yet fearing to go out.  \"Kiss me--tomahawk pappoose!\" said the savage, placing his hand upon the weapon.  The young wife placed her hands over her face and sobbed aloud. She did not hear the cat-like footsteps of the savage, as he approached. His long arm was already stretched forth to clasp her, when the door was darkened, a form leaped into the room, and with the quickness of lightning, dealt the savage a tremendous blow that stretched him limp and lifeless upon the floor.  [Illustration: Dealt the savage a tremendous blow.]  \"Move a limb and I will kill you!\" shouted the young missionary, his face all ablaze with passion. \"Cora, has he harmed you?\"  \"No, no, no, Harvey; have you not already killed him?\"  \"Pity that I haven't. He is not fit to live.\"  \"Dear Harvey, you are carried away by your passion. Do restrain yourself.\"  Woman-like, the only emotion of Cora Richter was that of commiseration for the poor wretch that had been stricken down by the hand of her husband. She saw the blood trickling from his face and knew that he was dreadfully injured. The missionary, too, began to become more calm and collected; and yet, while regretting the occasion, he could but think he had done his simple duty to his insulted wife. Had he been prepared as he entered the door, he would have shot the savage dead in his tracks.  Harvey picked up his rifle that lay in the middle of the floor, and approached the prostrate Indian. After pushing and shaking, he gave signs of returning consciousness, and at length arose to his feet. His nose had bled copiously, and one eye was \"closed,\" as if he had been under the manipulation of some pugilist.  The wife brought a basin of water, and offered a bandage, while Harvey proffered his assistance. But the Indian, without speaking, motioned them aside, and made his way out the door. On the threshold he paused a moment and looked back--and that look Harvey Richter will remember to his dying day.  Both breathed freer when he had gone. They then looked in each other's faces a moment and the wife sunk into her husband's arms.  \"Did I not do right, Cora?\"  \"Yes; oh, yes; but, Harvey, this will not be the last of it. You have made an enemy of that Indian, and he can never be made a friend.\"  \"Such is often the result of doing your simple duty. Let us therefore trust to God and say no more about it. Ah! here comes Teddy.\"  The Irishman at this moment entered the door. He was still under the influence of liquor though he made ludicrous efforts to conceal it. The wife found opportunity to communicate to her husband all that had been told her, before the conversation had progressed far. The peril which she had so narrowly escaped decided the missionary to be severely just with his servant.  \"Teddy, where have you been?\"  \"Won't that spake for itself?\" he replied, holding up a handsome string of fish. \"Begorrah, but it was mighty poor luck I had hunting.\"  \"I should judge you had discovered something unusual from your strange actions.\"  The face of the Irishman flushed scarlet, and his confusion was distressing. \"Teddy,\" he continued, \"I am displeased at the manner in which you have acted for the last week or two. Had it not happened that I left the village sooner than usual to-day, most probably my wife and son would have been killed.\"  The fellow was completely sobered.  \"What is it ye say, Mister Harvey?\"  \"For several days you have failed to return in the time you promised, so that I have been compelled to leave them alone and unprotected. This afternoon, an Indian came in the house and threatened the life of both my wife and child--\"  \"Where the divil is he?\" demanded Teddy, springing up; \"I'll brake ivery bone in his body.\"  \"He is gone, never to return I trust.\"  \"Be the powers! if I could but maat him--\"  \"Do not add falsehood to your conduct. He said that you and he have met constantly and drank liquor together.\"  The expression of blank amazement was so genuine and laughable that the missionary could hardly repress a smile. He felt that his last remark was hardly fair. Teddy finally burst out.  \"'Twas that owld Mahogany copperskin; but did I iver 'xpact he was up to _sich_ a trick and he would niver have l'aved me a-fishing. Oorah, oorah!\" he muttered, gnashing his teeth together. \"What a miserable fool I _have_ been. He to come here and insult me mistress after professin' the kindest regards. May I be made to eat rat-tail files for potaties if iver I trust red-skin honor again!\"  \"It strikes me that you and this precious savage had become quite intimate. I suppose in a few weeks longer you would have left us and lived with him altogether.\"  The tears trickled down Teddy's cheeks, and he made answer in a meek, mournful tone:  \"Plaise forgive me, Mister Harvey, and Miss Cora. Yees both knows I would die for yees, and it was little I dr'amed of a savage iver disecrating this house by an ungentlemanly act. Teddy never'll sarve yees the like agin.\"  \"I have no faith in the promises of a man who is intemperate.\"  The Irishman raised his hand to heaven:  \"May the good Father above strike me dead if I iver swallow another drop! Do yees belave me now. Mister Harvey?\"  \"You must not place the reliance in your own power, Teddy. Ask His assistance and you'll succeed.\"  \"I'll do so; but, ye saa, the only mill where I could get the cursed stuff was of this same Indian, and as I politely towld him I'd practice wid me gun on him if he offered me anither drop, and, as I'd pick him off now, after this shine, as quick as I would a sarpent, it ain't likely he'll bother me agin.\"  \"I hope not, but I have the same apprehension as Cora that he will return when we least expect him. We must manage so that we are never both away from the house at the same time. It is now getting well along in the afternoon, Teddy; you may prepare your fish for supper.\"  The Irishman obediently moved away, and the young missionary and his wife were left together.     CHAPTER V.   GONE!    Alas, alas, fair Inez,   She went away with song,   In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell   To her you've loved so long.--HOOD.   Alertness or watchfulness is sure to succeed the accomplishment of an enemy's designs. The moment danger is over, then the most vigilant preparations against it are made. The burglar knows better than to visit the same house two nights in succession. He is wise enough to wait until time has lulled the inmates into fancied security.  With such an interest at stake as had Harvey Richter, one may well believe that no precaution was neglected which could operate to defeat the designs of the savage whom he had driven in anger from his door. He changed his hour of visitation from the afternoon to the forenoon. Teddy needed no admonition against leaving the house during his absence. He kept watch and ward over the house as if he would atone by vigilance for past shortcomings.  The missionary had dwelt long enough among the Indians to gain a pretty accurate estimate of their character. What troubled him most, therefore, was a conviction that the savage's revenge, though delayed for ten years, for want of the convenient opportunity, was sure to be accomplished. He might have gone immediately to the north or east, there to remain with his own tribe until convinced that the moment had come to strike the blow--a blow, which no human influence, no personal danger, no suffering, could"]]]
