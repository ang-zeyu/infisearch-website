SPOTTSYLVANIA     THE SHADES OF THE WILDERNESS     CHAPTER I  THE SOUTHERN RETREAT   A train of wagons and men wound slowly over the hills in the darkness and rain toward the South.  In the wagons lay fourteen or fifteen thousand wounded soldiers, but they made little noise, as the wheels sank suddenly in the mud or bumped over stones.  Although the vast majority of them were young, boys or not much more, they had learned to be masters of themselves, and they suffered in silence, save when some one, lost in fever, uttered a groan.  But the chief sound was a blended note made by the turning of wheels, and the hoofs of horses sinking in the soft earth.  The officers gave but few orders, and the cavalrymen who rode on either flank looked solicitously into the wagons now and then to see how their wounded friends fared, though they seldom spoke.  The darkness they did not mind, because they were used to it, and the rain and the coolness were a relief, after three days of the fiercest battle the American continent had ever known, fought in the hottest days that the troops could recall.  Thus Lee's army drew its long length from the fatal field of Gettysburg, although his valiant brigades did not yet know that the clump of trees upon Cemetery Hill had marked the high tide of the Confederacy.  All that memorable Fourth of July, following the close of the battle they had lain, facing Meade and challenging him to come on, confident that while the invasion of the North was over they could beat back once more the invasion of the South.  They had no word of complaint against their great commander, Lee. The faith in him, which was so high, remained unbroken, as it was destined to remain so to the last.  But men began to whisper to one another, and say if only Jackson had been there.  They mourned anew that terrible evening in the Wilderness when Lee had lost his mighty lieutenant, his striking arm, the invincible Stonewall.  If the man in the old slouch hat had only been with Lee on Seminary Ridge it would now be the army of Meade retreating farther into the North, and they would be pursuing. That belief was destined to sink deep in the soul of the South, and remain there long after the Confederacy was but a name.  The same thought was often in the mind of Harry Kenton, as he rode near the rear of the column, whence he had been sent by Lee to observe and then to report.  It was far after midnight now, and the last of the Southern army could not leave Seminary Ridge before morning.  But Harry could detect no sign of pursuit.  Now and then, a distant gun boomed, and the thunder muttered on the horizon, as if in answer.  But there was nothing to indicate that the Army of the Potomac was moving from Gettysburg in pursuit, although the President in Washington, his heart filled with bitterness, was vainly asking why his army would not reap the fruits of a victory won so hardly.  Fifty thousand men had fallen on the hills and in the valleys about Gettysburg, and it seemed, for the time, that nothing would come of such a slaughter.  But the Northern army had suffered immense losses, and Lee and his men were ready to fight again if attacked.  Perhaps it was wiser to remain content upon the field with their sanguinary success.  At least, Meade and his generals thought so.  Harry, toward morning came upon St. Clair and Langdon riding together. Both had been wounded slightly, but their hurts had not kept them from the saddle, and they were in cheerful mood.  \"You've been further back than we, Harry,\" said St. Clair.  \"Is Meade hot upon our track?  We hear the throb of a cannon now and then.\"  \"It doesn't mean anything.  Meade hasn't moved.  While we didn't win we struck the Yankees such a mighty blow that they'll have to rest, and breathe a while before they follow.\"  \"And I guess we need a little resting and breathing ourselves,\" said Langdon frankly.  \"There were times when I thought the whole world had just turned itself into a volcano of fire.\"  \"But we'll come back again,\" said St. Clair.  \"We'll make these Pennsylvania Dutchmen take notice of us a second time.\"  \"That's the right spirit,\" said Langdon.  \"Arthur had nearly all of his fine uniform shot off him, but he's managed to fasten the pieces together, and ride on, just as if it were brand new.\"  But Harry was silent.  The prescient spirit of his famous great grandfather, Henry Ware, had descended upon his valiant great grandson. Hope had not gone from him, but it did not enter his mind that they should invade Pennsylvania again.  \"I'm glad to leave Gettysburg,\" he said.  \"More good men of ours have fallen there than anywhere else.\"  \"That's true,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12532"],["title","The Shades of the Wilderness: A Story of Lee's Great Stand (#1)"],["body"," said St. Clair, \"but Marse Bob will win for us, anyhow. You don't think any of these Union generals here in the East can whip our Lee, do you?\"  \"Of course not!\" said Happy Tom.  \"Besides, Lee has me to help him.\"  \"How are Colonel Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire?\" asked Harry.  \"Sound asleep, both of 'em,\" replied St. Clair.  \"And it's a strange thing, too.  They were sitting in a wagon, having resumed that game of chess which they began in the Valley of Virginia, but they were so exhausted that both fell sound asleep while playing.  They are sitting upright, as they sleep, and Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire's thumb and forefinger rest upon a white pawn that he intended to move.\"  \"I hope they won't be jarred out of their rest and that they'll sleep on,\" said Harry.  \"Nobody deserves it more.\"  He waved a hand to his friends and continued his ride toward the rear. The column passed slowly on in silence.  Now and then gusts of rain lashed across his face, but he liked the feeling.  It was a fillip to his blood, and his nerves began to recover from the tremendous strain and excitement of the last four days.  Obeying his orders he rode almost directly back toward the field of Gettysburg from which the Southern forces were still marching.  A friendly voice from a little wood hailed him, and he recognized it at once as that of Sherburne, who sat his horse alone among the trees.  \"Come here, Harry,\" he said.  \"Glad to find you alive, Sherburne.  Where's your troop?\"  \"What's left of it is on ahead.  I'll join the men in a few minutes. But look back there!\"  Harry from the knoll, which was higher than he had thought, gazed upon a vast and dusky panorama.  Once more the field of Gettysburg swam before him, not now in fire and smoke, but in vapors and misty rain. When he shut his eyes he saw again the great armies charging on the slopes, the blazing fire from hundreds of cannon and a hundred thousand rifles. There, too, went Pickett's brigades, devoted to death but never flinching.  A sob burst from his throat, and he opened his eyes again.  \"You feel about it as I do,\" said Sherburne.  \"We'll never come back into the North.\"  \"It isn't merely a feeling within me, I know it.\"  \"So do I, but we can still hold Virginia.\"  \"I think so, too.  Come, we'd better turn.  There goes the field of Gettysburg.  The rain and mist have blotted it out.\"  The panorama, the most terrible upon which Harry had ever looked, vanished in the darkness.  The two rode slowly from the knoll and into the road.  \"It will be daylight in an hour,\" said Sherburne, \"and by that time the last of our men will be gone.\"  \"And I must hasten to our commander-in-chief,\" said Harry.  \"How is he?\" asked Sherburne.  \"Does he seem downcast?\"  \"No, he holds his head as high as ever, and cheers the men.  They say that Pickett's charge was a glorious mistake, but he takes all the blame for it, if there is any.  He doesn't criticize any of his generals.\"  \"Only a man of the greatest moral grandeur could act like that.  It's because of such things that our people, boys, officers and all, will follow him to the death.\"  \"Good-by, Sherburne,\" said Harry.  \"Hope I'll see you again soon.\"  He urged his horse into a faster gait, anxious to overtake Lee and report that all was well with the rear guard.  He noticed once more, and with the greatest care that long line of the wounded and the unwounded, winding sixteen miles across the hills from Gettysburg to Chambersburg, and his mind was full of grave thoughts.  More than two years in the very thick of the greatest war, then known, were sufficient to make a boy a man, at least in intellect and responsibility.  Harry saw very clearly, as he rode beside the retreating but valiant army that had failed in its great attempt, that their role would be the defensive.  For a little while he was sunk in deep depression.  Then invincible youth conquered anew, and hope sprang up again.  The night was at the darkest, but dawn was not far away.  Fugitive gusts of wind drenched him once more, but he did not mind it, nor did he pay any attention to the occasional growl of a distant gun.  He was strong in the belief that Meade would not pursue--at least not yet.  A general who had just lost nearly one-third of his own army was not in much condition to follow his enemy.  He urged his horse to increased speed, and pressed on toward the head of the column.  The rain ceased and cool puffs of wind came out of the east. Then the blackness there turned to gray, which soon deepened into silver. Through the silver veil shot a bolt of red fire, and the sun came over the hills.  Although the green world had been touched with brown by the hot sun of July it looked fresh and beautiful to Harry.  The brown in the morning sunlight was a rosy red, and the winds of dawn were charged with life. His horse, too, felt the change and it was easy now to force him into a gallop toward a fire on a low hill, which Harry felt sure had been built to cook breakfast for their great commander.  As he approached he saw Lee and his generals standing before the blaze, some eating, and others drinking.  An orderly, near by, held the commander's famous horse, Traveller, and two or three horses belonging to the other generals were trying to find a little grass between the stony outcrops of the hills.  Harry felt an overwhelming curiosity, but he kept it in restraint, dismounting at a little distance, and approaching on foot.  He could not observe much change in the general's appearance.  His handsome gray suit was as neat as ever, and the three stars, the only marks of his rank that he wore, shone untarnished upon his collar. The dignified and cheerful manner that marked him before Gettysburg marked him also afterward.  To Harry, so young and so thoroughly charged with the emotions of his time and section, he was a figure to be approached with veneration.  He saw the stalwart and bearded Longstreet and other generals whom he knew, among them the brilliant Stuart in his brilliant plumage, but rather quiet and subdued in manner now, since he had not come to Gettysburg as soon as he was needed.  Harry hung back a little, fearing lest he might be regarded as thrusting himself into a company so much his superior in rank, but Lee saw him and beckoned to him.  \"I sent you back toward Gettysburg to report on our withdrawal, Lieutenant Kenton,\" he said.  \"Yes, sir.  I returned all the way to the field.  The last of our troops should be leaving there just about now.  The Northern army had made no preparation for immediate pursuit.\"  \"Your report agrees with all the others that I have received.  How long have you been without sleep?\"  \"I don't know, sir,\" he said at last.  \"I can't remember.  Maybe it has been two or three days.\"  Stuart, who held a cup of coffee in his hand, laughed.  \"The times have been such that there are generals as well as lieutenants,\" he said, \"who can't remember when they've slept.\"  \"You're exhausted, my lad,\" said Lee gravely and kindly, \"and there's nothing more you can do for us just now.  Take some breakfast with us, and then you must sleep in one of the wagons.  An orderly will look after your horse.\"  Lee handed him a cup of coffee with his own hand, and Harry, thanking him, withdrew to the outer fringe of the little group, where he took his breakfast, amazed to find how hungry he was, although he had not thought of food before.  Then without a word, as he saw that the generals were engrossed in a conference, he withdrew.  \"You'll find Lieutenant Dalton of the staff in the covered wagon over there,\" said the orderly who had taken his horse.  \"The general sent him to it more'n two hours ago.\"  \"Then I'll be inside it in less than two minutes,\" said Harry.  But with rest in sight he collapsed suddenly.  His head fell forward of its own weight.  His feet became lead.  Everything swam before his eyes. He felt that he must sleep or die.  But he managed to drag himself to the wagon and climbed inside.  Dalton lay in the center of it so sound asleep that he was like one dead.  Harry rolled him to one side, making room for himself, and lay down beside him.  Then his eyes closed, and he, too, slept so soundly that he also looked like one dead.  He was awakened by Dalton pulling at him.  The young Virginian was sitting up and looking at Harry with curiosity.  He clapped his hands when the Kentuckian opened his eyes.  \"Now I know that you're not dead,\" he said.  \"When I woke up and found you lying beside me I thought they had just put your body in here for safekeeping.  As that's not the case, kindly explain to me and at once what you're doing in my wagon.\"  \"I'm waking up just at present, but for an hour or two before that I was sleeping.\"  \"Hour or two?  Hour or two?  Hear him!  An orderly who I know is no liar told me that you got in here just after dawn.  Now kindly lift that canvasflap, look out and tell me what you see.\"  Harry did as he was told, and was amazed.  The same rolling landscape still met his eyes, and the sun was just about as high in the sky as it was when he had climbed into the wagon.  But it was in the west now instead of the east.  \"See and know, young man!\" said Dalton, paternally.  \"The entire day has elapsed and here you have lain in ignorant slumber, careless of everything, reckless of what might happen to the army.  For twelve hours General Lee has been without your advice, and how, lacking it, he has got this far, Heaven alone knows.\"  \"It seems that he's pulled through, and, since I'm now awake, you can hurry to him and tell him I'm ready to furnish the right plans to stop the forthcoming Yankee invasion.\"  \"They'll keep another day, but we've certainly had a good sleep, Harry.\"  \"Yes, a provision or ammunition wagon isn't a bad place for a wornout soldier.  I remember I slept in another such as this in the Valley of Virginia, when we were with Jackson.\"  He stopped suddenly and choked.  He could not mention the name of "]]]
