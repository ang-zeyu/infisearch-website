The sun sank in a cloudless blaze behind a line of trenches on a gentle slope above the western shore when I entered the _Gasthof Rabe_, where I hoped to get a room for the night.  I had no sooner crossed the threshold, however, than I was arrested and brought to the Etappen-Commandant in the Pregelstrasse.  I fully expected to be placed under arrest or be deported, but I determined to put up the best bluff possible.  A knowledge of Germans and their respect for any authority above that invested in their own individual selves led me to decide upon a bold course of action, so I resolved to play the game with a high hand and with an absolute exterior confidence of manner.  Instead of waiting to be questioned when I was brought into the presence of the stern old officer, I told him at once that I had been looking for him.  I informed him that Herr von Meyer and Commandant Rauch in Konigsberg were in hearty sympathy with my search for Russian atrocities, but although I succeeded in quieting any suspicions which the Commandant may have entertained, I found winning permission to stay in Wehlau an exceedingly difficult matter.  Orders were orders!  He explained that the battle was rolling eastward not far away and that I must go back.  To add weight to what he said he read me a set of typewritten orders which had come from Berlin the day before.  \"Journalists are not allowed with the army or in the wake of the army in East Prussia. . . .\" he read, in a tone which indicated that he considered the last word said.  But I had become so fascinated with this battle-scarred, uncanny, out-of-the-way land that I resolved to try every means to stay.  I declared that on this particular mission I was more of an investigator than a journalist, that I had the special task (self-imposed, to be sure) of investigating Russian atrocities; that if Berlin reports were to be given credence abroad they must be substantiated by some impartial observer.  If Germany would supply the atrocities, I would supply the copy.  That she wished to do so was evidenced by the permissions granted me by Herr von Meyer of the Wolff Telegraph Bureau and Commandant Rauch of the capital of the devastated province.  (I had passed beyond the point where I was told that I could go, but at any rate their names carried weight.)  Would it not seem strange if the Commandant at Wehlau had me sent back after these great men had set their seal of approval upon my investigations?  After Germany had made such grave charges against the Russians, how would it impress American readers that the German Commandant at Wehlau could not make good and had sent me back?  Then, as a finishing stroke, I pulled my passport from my pocket and showed Berlin's approval of me stamped impressively in the right-hand corner.  This vise was not at all unique with me.  It had been affixed to the passports of thousands of Americans of all grades, and was merely to ensure passage from Germany into Holland. As I did not wish to impose upon the time of the Commandant I did not burden him with these extraneous details while he feasted his eyes on the magic words: _Gesehen, Berlin_.  Mount Olympus, Mecca, Imperial and Ecclesiastical Rome all rolled into one--that is authoritative Berlin to the German of the province.  \"Gesehen, Berlin\" he repeated with reverence, carefully folded the passport and deferentially handed it back to me.  I saw that I was winning, so I sought to rise to the occasion.  \"And now, Herr Commandant,\" I began, \"can you suggest where I may best begin my atrocity work tomorrow?  Or first, would it not be well for me to get a more complete idea of the invasion by seeing on the map just what routes the Russians took coming in?\"  He unfolded a large military map of peerless German accuracy and regaled me for more than half an hour with the military features of the campaign.  \"Just tell me the worst things that the Russians have done,\" I began, \"and I will start investigating them tomorrow.\"  Then he anathematised the Russians and all things Russian, while his orderly stood stiffly and admiringly at attention and the other officers stopped in their tracks.  \"First you should visit the ruins of the once beautiful old castle at Labiau destroyed by the beasts,\" he thundered.   \"And they also wantonly destroyed the magnificent old church near by.\"  He followed with an account of the history of the castle, and it was clear that he was deeply affected by the loss of these landscape embellishments which he had learned to love so much that they became part of his life, and that their destruction deeply enraged him against the enemy.  Though I saw his point of view and sympathised with him, I questioned him in the hope of learning of some real atrocities.  It was useless.  Although he made general charges against the Russians, he always reverted, when pinned down to facts, with a fresh burst of anger, to the castle and church of Labiau as his pet atrocity.  The orderly had just been commanded to take me on a search for quarters for the night, when an automobile horn tooted beneath the window.  Heavy steps on the stairs; a Staff Officer entered the room, looked surprised to see me, and asked who I was.  The Commandant justified his permission to let me remain by eulogising the noble work upon which I was engaged, but though the Staff Officer's objections were hushed, he did not enthuse over my coming.  With intent to convince him that I was already hard at work I told him of the terrible destruction of the castle and church at Labiau, which I would visit on the following day.  \"I have a sergeant below who was there, and I will have him come in,\" he said.  The sergeant entered, clicked his heels at attention; a doughty old warrior, small and wiry, not a civilian thrust into field-grey, but a soldier, every inch of him, a Prussian soldier, turned to stone in the presence of his superior officers, his sharp clear eyes strained on some point in space directly ahead.  He might have stepped out of the pages of the Seven Years' War.  Nobody spoke.  The pale yellow light of the oil lamp on the Commandants desk fell on the military faces, figures and trappings of the men in the room.  The shuffling tramp of soldiers in the dark street below died away in the direction of the river.  I felt the military tenseness of the scene.  I realised that I was inside the German lines on a bluff that was succeeding but might collapse at any moment.  Feeling that a good investigating committee should display initiative I broke the silence by questioning the little sergeant, and I began on a line which I felt would please the Commandant, \"You were at Labiau during the fighting?\" I asked.  \"I was, sir!\"  He did not move a muscle except those necessary for speech.  His eyes were still rigid on that invisible something directly ahead. He clearly was conscious of the importance of his position, as informant to a stranger before his superior officers.  \"I have heard that the beautiful old castle and the magnificent old church were destroyed,\" I continued.  \"You know of this, of course?\"  \"Ja, ja, that is true!  Our wonderful artillery knocked them to pieces when we drove the Russians out in panic!\"  The sergeant was not the only one looking into space now.  The Staff Officer relieved the situation by dismissing him from the room, whereupon the Commandant sharply bade the orderly conduct me to my night lodgings.  \"No Iron Cross for the little sergeant,\" I reflected, as we stumbled through the cooked old streets in the dark.  Is it any wonder that the German Government insists that neutral correspondents be chaperoned by someone who can skilfully show them what is proper for them to see, and let them hear that which is proper for them to hear?  Everywhere in rooms lighted by oil lamps soldiers sat talking, drinking and playing cards.  They were under every roof, and were also bivouacked on the flats along the river.  In all three inns there was not even floor space available.   The little brick town hall, too, was crowded with soldiers.  At the pontoon bridge we were sharply challenged by a sentry.  The orderly answered and we passed on to a crowded beer hall above which I was fortunate to secure a room.  By the flickering light of a candle I was conducted to a dusty attic furnished with ferruginous junk in one corner and a dilapidated bed in another. No such luxuries as bed clothing, of course; only a red mattress which had not been benefited in the least by Russian bayonet thrusts and sabre slashes in the quest of concealed treasure.  I could not wash unless I would go down to the river, for with the blowing up of the bridges the water mains had also been destroyed. The excellent organisation of the Germans was in evidence, however, for during my stay I witnessed their prompt and efficient measures to restore sanitation, in order to avert disease.  I went downstairs and entered the large beer room, hazy with tobacco smoke, and filled for the most part with non-commissioned officers.  They, like everybody else in the room, seemed to have heard of my arrival.  I joined a group at a long table, a jovial crowd of men who chaffed good naturedly one of their number who said he wished to be home with his wife and little ones.  They looked at me and laughed, then pointing at him said, \"He is no warrior!\"  But it was their talk about the Russians which, interested me most. There was no hate in their speech, only indifference and contempt for their Eastern enemy.  Hindenburg was their hero, and they drank toast after toast to his health.  The Russian menace was over, they felt; Britain and France would be easily smashed.  They loved their Army, their Emperor, and Hindenburg, and believed implicitly in all three.  They sang a song of East Prussia and raised their foaming glasses at the last two lines:    \"Es trinkt der Mensch, es sauft das Pferd,   In "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],["title","Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#0)"],["body","Team.

The following diary was kept in the winter and spring of 1838-9, on an estate consisting of rice and cotton plantations, in the islands at the entrance of the Altamaha, on the coast of Georgia.  The slaves in whom I then had an unfortunate interest were sold some years ago. The islands themselves are at present in the power of the Northern troops.

Philadelphia: December 1838.  My Dear E----. I return you Mr. ----'s letter. I do not think it answers any of the questions debated in our last conversation at all satisfactorily: the _right_ one man has to enslave another, he has not the hardihood to assert; but in the reasons he adduces to defend that act of injustice, the contradictory statements he makes appear to me to refute each other. He says, that to the continental European protesting against the abstract iniquity of slavery, his answer would be, 'the slaves are infinitely better off than half the continental peasantry.' To the Englishman, 'they are happy compared with the miserable Irish.' But supposing that this answered the question of original injustice, which it does not, it is not a true reply. Though the negroes are fed, clothed, and housed, and though the Irish peasant is starved, naked, and roofless, the bare name of freeman--the lordship over his own person, the power to choose and will--are blessings beyond food, raiment, or shelter; possessing which, the want of every comfort of life is yet more tolerable than their fullest enjoyment without them. Ask the thousands of ragged destitutes who yearly land upon these shores to seek the means of existence--ask the friendless, penniless foreign emigrant, if he will give up his present misery, his future uncertainty, his doubtful and difficult struggle for life, at once, for the secure, and as it is called, fortunate dependance of the slave: the indignation with which he would spurn the offer will prove that he possesses one good beyond all others, and that his birthright as a man is more precious to him yet than the mess of pottage for which he is told to exchange it because he is starving.  Of course the reverse alternative cannot be offered to the slaves, for at the very word the riches of those who own them would make themselves wings and flee away. But I do not admit the comparison between your slaves and even the lowest class of European free labourers, for the former are _allowed_ the exercise of no faculties but those which they enjoy in common with the brutes that perish. The just comparison is between the slaves and the useful animals to whose level your laws reduce them; and I will acknowledge that the slaves of a kind owner may be as well cared for, and as happy, as the dogs and horses of a merciful master; but the latter condition--i.e. that of happiness--must again depend upon the complete perfection of their moral and mental degradation. Mr. ----, in his letter, maintains that they _are_ an inferior race, and, compared with the whites, '_animals_, incapable of mental culture and moral improvement:' to this I can only reply, that if they are incapable of profiting by instruction, I do not see the necessity for laws inflicting heavy penalties on those who offer it to them. If they really are brutish, witless, dull, and devoid of capacity for progress, where lies the _danger_ which is constantly insisted upon of offering them that of which they are incapable. We have no laws forbidding us to teach our dogs and horses as much as they can comprehend; nobody is fined or imprisoned for reasoning upon knowledge, and liberty, to the beasts of the field, for they are incapable of such truths. But these themes are forbidden to slaves, not because they cannot, but because they can and would seize on them with avidity--receive them gladly, comprehend them quickly; and the masters' power over them would be annihilated at once and for ever. But I have more frequently heard, not that they were incapable of receiving instruction, but something much nearer the truth--that knowledge only makes them miserable: the moment they are in any degree enlightened, they become unhappy. In the letter I return to you Mr. ---- says that the very slightest amount of education, merely teaching them to read, 'impairs their value as slaves, for it instantly destroys their contentedness, and since you do not contemplate changing their condition, it is surely doing them an ill service to destroy their acquiescence in it;' but this is a very different ground of argument from the other. The discontent they evince upon the mere dawn of an advance in intelligence proves not only that they can acquire but combine ideas, a process to which it is very difficult to assign a limit; and there indeed the whole question lies, and there and nowhere else the shoe really pinches. A slave is ignorant; he eats, drinks, sleeps, labours, and is happy. He learns to read; he feels, thinks, reflects, and becomes miserable. He discovers himself to be one of a debased and degraded race, deprived of the elementary rights which God has granted to all men alike; every action is controlled, every word noted; he may not stir beyond his appointed bounds, to the right hand or to the left, at his own will, but at the will of another he may be sent miles and miles of weary journeying--tethered, yoked, collared, and fettered--away from whatever he may know as home, severed from all those ties of blood and affection which he alone of all human, of all living creatures on the face of the earth may neither enjoy in peace nor defend when they are outraged. If he is well treated, if his master be tolerably humane or even understand his own interest tolerably, this is probably _all_ he may have to endure: it is only to the consciousness of these evils that knowledge and reflection awaken him. But how is it if his master be severe, harsh, cruel--or even only careless--leaving his creatures to the delegated dominion of some overseer, or agent, whose love of power, or other evil dispositions, are checked by no considerations of personal interest? Imagination shrinks from the possible result of such a state of things; nor must you, or Mr. ----, tell me that the horrors thus suggested exist only in imagination. The Southern newspapers, with their advertisements of negro sales and personal descriptions of fugitive slaves, supply details of misery that it would be difficult for imagination to exceed. Scorn, derision, insult, menace--the handcuff, the lash--the tearing away of children from parents, of husbands from wives--the weary trudging in droves along the common highways, the labour of body, the despair of mind, the sickness of heart--these are the realities which belong to the system, and form the rule, rather than the exception, in the slave's experience. And this system exists here in this country of your's, which boasts itself the asylum of the oppressed, the home of freedom, the one place in all the world where all men may find enfranchisement from all thraldoms of mind, soul, or body--the land elect of liberty.  Mr. ---- lays great stress, as a proof of the natural inferiority of the blacks, on the little comparative progress they have made in those States where they enjoy their freedom, and the fact that, whatever quickness of parts they may exhibit while very young, on attaining maturity they invariably sink again into inferiority, or at least mediocrity, and indolence. But surely there are other causes to account for this besides natural deficiency, which must, I think, be obvious to any unprejudiced person observing the condition of the free blacks in your Northern communities. If, in the early portion of their life, they escape the contempt and derision of their white associates--if the blessed unconsciousness and ignorance of childhood keeps them for a few years unaware of the conventional proscription under which their whole race is placed (and it is difficult to walk your streets, and mark the tone of insolent superiority assumed by even the gutter-urchins over their dusky cotemporaries, and imagine this possible)--as soon as they acquire the first rudiments of knowledge, as soon as they begin to grow up and pass from infancy to youth, as soon as they cast the first observing glance upon the world by which they are surrounded, and the society of which, they are members, they must become conscious that they are marked as the Hebrew lepers of old, and are condemned to sit, like those unfortunates, without the gates of every human and social sympathy. From their own sable colour, a pall falls over the whole of God's universe to them, and they find themselves stamped with a badge of infamy of Nature's own devising, at sight of which all natural kindliness of man to man seems to recoil from them. They are not slaves indeed, but they are pariahs; debarred from all fellowship save with their own despised race--scorned by the"]]]
