The tension portion of the fracture is nearly the same as though the piece were pulled in two lengthwise. The fibre walls are torn across obliquely and usually in a spiral direction. There is practically no pulling apart of the fibres, that is, no separation of the fibres along their walls, regardless of their thickness. The nature of tension failure is apparently not affected by the moisture condition of the specimen, at least not so much so as the other strength values.[3]  [Footnote 3: See Brush, Warren D.: A microscopic study of the mechanical failure of wood. Vol. II, Rev. F.S. Investigations, Washington, D.C., 1912, p. 35.]  Tension at right angles to the grain is closely related to cleavability. When wood fails in this manner the thin fibre walls are torn in two lengthwise while the thick-walled fibres are usually pulled apart along the primary wall.  |--------------------------------------------| |                 TABLE III                  | |--------------------------------------------| |  TENSILE STRENGTH AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE   | | GRAIN OF SMALL CLEAR PIECES OF 25 WOODS IN | |              GREEN CONDITION               | |         (Forest Service Cir. 213)          | |--------------------------------------------| |                  |    When    |    When    | |   COMMON NAME    | surface of | surface of | |   OF SPECIES     | failure is | failure is | |                  |   radial   | tangential | |------------------+------------+------------| |                  |  Lbs. per  |  Lbs. per  | |                  |  sq. inch  |  sq. inch  | |                  |            |            | |    Hardwoods     |            |            | |                  |            |            | | Ash, white       |      645   |      671   | | Basswood         |      226   |      303   | | Beech            |      633   |      969   | | Birch, yellow    |      446   |      526   | | Elm, slippery    |      765   |      832   | | Hackberry        |      661   |      786   | | Locust, honey    |    1,133   |    1,445   | | Maple, sugar     |      610   |      864   | | Oak, post        |      714   |      924   | |   red            |      639   |      874   | |   swamp white    |      757   |      909   | |   white          |      622   |      749   | |   yellow         |      728   |      929   | | Sycamore         |      540   |      781   | | Tupelo           |      472   |      796   | |                  |            |            | |    Conifers      |            |            | |                  |            |            | | Arborvitæ        |      241   |      235   | | Cypress, bald    |      242   |      251   | | Fir, white       |      213   |      304   | | Hemlock          |      271   |      323   | | Pine, longleaf   |      240   |      298   | |   red            |      179   |      205   | |   sugar          |      239   |      304   | |   western yellow |      230   |      252   | |   white          |      225   |      285   | | Tamarack         |      236   |      274   | |--------------------------------------------|    COMPRESSIVE OR CRUSHING STRENGTH   ~Compression across the grain~ is very closely related to hardness and transverse shear. There are two ways in which wood is subjected to stress of this kind, namely, (1) with the load acting over the entire area of the specimen, and (2) with a load concentrated over a portion of the area. (See Fig. 2.) The latter is the condition more commonly met with in practice, as, for example, where a post rests on a horizontal sill, or a rail rests on a cross-tie. The former condition, however, gives the true resistance of the grain to simple crushing.  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Compression across the grain.]  The first effect of compression across the grain is to compact the fibres, the load gradually but irregularly increasing as the density of the material is increased. If the specimen lies on a flat surface and the load is applied to only a portion of the upper area, the bearing plate indents the wood, crushing the upper fibres without affecting the lower part. (See Fig. 3.) As the load increases the projecting ends sometimes split horizontally. (See Fig. 4.) The irregularities in the load are due to the fact that the fibres collapse a few at a time, beginning with those with the thinnest walls. The projection of the ends increases the strength of the material directly beneath the compressing weight by introducing a beam action which helps support the load. This influence is exerted for a short distance only.  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Side view of failures in compression across the grain, showing crushing of blocks under bearing plate. Specimen at right shows splitting at ends.]  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--End view of failures in compression across the grain, showing splitting of the ends of the test specimens.]  When wood is used for columns, props, posts, and spokes, the weight of the load tends to shorten the material endwise. This is ~endwise compression~, or compression parallel to the grain. In the case of long columns, that is, pieces in which the length is very great compared with their diameter, the failure is by sidewise bending or flexure, instead of by crushing or splitting. (See Fig. 5.) A familiar instance of this action is afforded by a flexible walking-stick. If downward pressure is exerted with the hand on the upper end of the stick placed vertically on the floor, it will be noted that a definite amount of force must be applied in each instance before decided flexure takes place. After this point is reached a very slight increase of pressure very largely increases the deflection, thus obtaining so great a leverage about the middle section as to cause rupture.  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Testing a buggy spoke in endwise compression, illustrating the failure by sidewise bending of a long column fixed only at the lower end. _Photo by U. S. Forest Service_]  The lateral bending of a column produces a combination of bending with compressive stress over the section, the compressive stress being maximum at the section of greatest deflection on the concave side. The convex surface is under tension, as in an ordinary beam test. (See Fig. 6.) If the same stick is braced in such a way that flexure is prevented, its supporting strength is increased enormously, since the compressive stress acts uniformly over the section, and failure is by crushing or splitting, as in small blocks. In all columns free to bend in any direction the deflection will be seen in the direction in which the column is least stiff. This sidewise bending can be overcome by making pillars and columns thicker in the middle than at the ends, and by bracing studding, props, and compression members of trusses. The strength of a column also depends to a considerable extent upon whether the ends are free to turn or are fixed.

Ordinarily where the length of the test specimen is not greater than four diameters and the ends are squarely faced (see Fig. 7), the force acts uniformly over each square inch of area and the crushing strength is equal to the maximum load (P) divided                                       {      P  } by the area of the cross-section (A). { C = --- }                                       {      A  }  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Endwise compression of a short column.]  It has been demonstrated[4] that the ultimate strength in compression parallel to the grain is very nearly the same as the extreme fibre stress at the elastic limit in bending. (See Table V.) In other words, the transverse strength of beams at elastic limit is practically equal to the compressive strength of the same material in short columns. It is accordingly possible to calculate the approximate breaking strength of beams from the compressive strength of short columns except when the wood is brittle. Since tests on endwise compression are simpler, easier to make, and less expensive than transverse bending tests, the importance of this relation is obvious, though it does not do away with the necessity of making beam tests.

The fibres (tracheids in conifers) act as hollow tubes bound closely together, and in giving way they either (1) buckle, or (2) bend.[5]  [Footnote 5: See Bulletin 70, _op. cit._, p. 129.]  The first is typical of any dry thin-walled cells, as is usually the case in seasoned white pine and spruce, and in the early wood of hard pines, hemlock, and other species with decided contrast between the two portions of the growth ring. As a rule buckling of a tracheid begins at the bordered pits which form places of least resistance in the walls. In hardwoods such as oak, chestnut, ash, etc., buckling occurs only in the thinnest-walled elements, such as the vessels, and not in the true fibres.  According to Jaccard[6] the folding of the cells is accompanied by characteristic alterations of their walls which seem to split them into extremely thin layers. When greatly magnified, these layers appear in longitudinal sections as delicate threads without any definite arrangements, while on cross section they appear as numerous concentric strata. This may be explained on the ground that the growth of a fibre is by successive layers which, under the influence of compression, are sheared apart. This is particularly the case with thick-walled cells such as are found in late wood.  [Footnote 6: Jaccard, P.: Étude anatomique des bois comprimés. Mit. d. Schw. Centralanstalt f.d. forst.
