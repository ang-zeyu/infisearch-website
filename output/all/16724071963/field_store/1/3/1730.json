Yet do thou regard, with pity                                             5 For a nameless child of passion, This small unfrequented valley By the sea, O sea-born mother.     II   What shall we do, Cytherea? Lovely Adonis is dying.   Ah, but we mourn him!  Will he return when the Autumn Purples the earth, and the sunlight                                       5   Sleeps in the vineyard?  Will he return when the Winter Huddles the sheep, and Orion   Goes to his hunting?  Ah, but thy beauty, Adonis,                                              10 With the soft spring and the south wind,   Love and desire!     III   Power and beauty and knowledge,— Pan, Aphrodite, or Hermes,— Whom shall we life-loving mortals   Serve and be happy?  Lo now, your garlanded altars,                                            5 Are they not goodly with flowers? Have ye not honour and pleasure   In lovely Lesbos?  Will ye not, therefore, a little Hearten, impel, and inspire                                              10 One who adores, with a favour   Threefold in wonder?     IV   O Pan of the evergreen forest, Protector of herds in the meadows, Helper of men at their toiling,— Tillage and harvest and herding,— How many times to frail mortals                                           5   Hast thou not hearkened!  Now even I come before thee With oil and honey and wheat-bread, Praying for strength and fulfilment Of human longing, with purpose                                           10 Ever to keep thy great worship   Pure and undarkened.         *       *       *       *       *  O Hermes, master of knowledge, Measure and number and rhythm, Worker of wonders in metal,                                              15 Moulder of malleable music, So often the giver of secret   Learning to mortals!  Now even I, a fond woman, Frail and of small understanding,                                        20 Yet with unslakable yearning Greatly desiring wisdom, Come to the threshold of reason   And the bright portals.         *       *       *       *       *  And thou, sea-born Aphrodite,                                            25 In whose beneficent keeping Earth, with her infinite beauty, Colour and fashion and fragrance, Glows like a flower with fervour   Where woods are vernal!                                                30  Touch with thy lips and enkindle This moon-white delicate body, Drench with the dew of enchantment This mortal one, that I also Grow to the measure of beauty                                            35   Fleet yet eternal.     V   O Aphrodite, God-born and deathless, Break not my spirit With bitter anguish: Thou wilful empress,                                                      5 I pray thee, hither!  As once aforetime Well thou didst hearken To my voice far off,— Listen, and leaving                                                      10 Thy father’s golden House in yoked chariot,  Come, thy fleet sparrows Beating the mid-air Over the dark earth.                                                     15 Suddenly near me, Smiling, immortal, Thy bright regard asked  What had befallen,— Why I had called thee,—                                                 20 What my mad heart then Most was desiring. “What fair thing wouldst thou Lure now to love thee?  “Who wrongs thee, Sappho?                                                25 If now she flies thee, Soon shall she follow;— Scorning thy gifts now, Soon be the giver;— And a loth loved one                                                     30  “Soon be the lover.” So even now, too, Come and release me From mordant love pain, And all my heart’s will                                                  35 Help me accomplish!     VI   Peer of the gods he seems, Who in thy presence Sits and hears close to him Thy silver speech-tones And lovely laughter.                                                      5  Ah, but the heart flutters Under my bosom, When I behold thee Even a moment; Utterance leaves me;                                                     10  My tongue is useless; A subtle fire Runs through my body; My eyes are sightless, And my ears ringing;                                                     15  I flush with fever, And a strong trembling Lays hold upon me; Paler than grass am I, Half dead for madness.                                                   20  Yet must I, greatly Daring, adore thee, As the adventurous Sailor makes seaward For the lost sky-line                                                    25  And undiscovered Fabulous islands, Drawn by the lure of Beauty and summer And the sea’s secret.                                                    30     VII   The Cyprian came to thy cradle, When thou wast little and small, And said to the nurse who rocked thee “Fear not thou for the child:  “She shall be kindly favoured,                                            5 And fair and fashioned well, As befits the Lesbian maidens And those who are fated to love.”  Hermes came to thy cradle, Resourceful, sagacious, serene,                                          10 And said, “The girl must have knowledge, To lend her freedom and poise.  Naught will avail her beauty, If she have not wit beside. She shall be Hermes’ daughter,                                           15 Passing wise in her day.”  Great Pan came to thy cradle, With calm of the deepest hills, And smiled, “They have forgotten The veriest power of life.                                               20  “To kindle her shapely beauty, And illumine her mind withal, I give to the little person The glowing and craving soul.”     VIII   Aphrodite of the foam, Who hast given all good gifts, And made Sappho at thy will Love so greatly and so much,  Ah, how comes it my frail heart                                           5 Is so fond of all things fair, I can never choose between Gorgo and Andromeda?     IX   Nay, but always and forever Like the bending yellow grain, Or quick water in a channel, Is the heart of man.  Comes the unseen breath in power                                          5 Like a great wind from the sea, And we bow before his coming, Though we know not why.     X   Let there be garlands, Dica, Around thy lovely hair. And supple sprays of blossom Twined by thy soft hands.  Whoso is crowned with flowers                                             5 Has favour with the gods, Who have no kindly eyes For the ungarlanded.     XI   When the Cretan maidens Dancing up the full moon Round some fair new altar, Trample the soft blossoms of fine grass,  There is mirth among them.                                                5 Aphrodite’s children Ask her benediction On their bridals in the summer night.     XII   In a dream I spoke with the Cyprus-born,   And said to her, “Mother of beauty, mother of joy, Why hast thou given to men  “This thing called love, like the ache of a wound                         5   In beauty’s side, To burn and throb and be quelled for an hour And never wholly depart?”  And the daughter of Cyprus said to me,   “Child of the earth,                                                   10 Behold, all things are born and attain, But only as they desire,—  “The sun that is strong, the gods that are wise,   The loving heart, Deeds and knowledge and beauty and joy,—                                15 But before all else was desire.”     XIII   Sleep thou in the bosom Of the tender comrade, While the living water "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12389"],["title","Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics (#2)"],["body","in the well-run, And the oleanders                                                         5 Glimmer in the moonlight.  Soon, ah, soon the shy birds Will be at their fluting, And the morning planet Rise above the garden;                                                   10 For there is a measure Set to all things mortal.     XIV   Hesperus, bringing together All that the morning star scattered,—  Sheep to be folded in twilight, Children for mothers to fondle,—  Me too will bring to the dearest,                                         5 Tenderest breast in all Lesbos.     XV   In the grey olive-grove a small brown bird Had built her nest and waited for the spring. But who could tell the happy thought that came To lodge beneath my scarlet tunic’s fold?  All day long now is the green earth renewed                               5 With the bright sea-wind and the yellow blossoms. From the cool shade I hear the silver plash Of the blown fountain at the garden’s end.     XVI   In the apple boughs the coolness Murmurs, and the grey leaves flicker Where sleep wanders.  In this garden all the hot noon I await thy fluttering footfall                                           5 Through the twilight.     XVII   Pale rose leaves have fallen In the fountain water; And soft reedy flute-notes Pierce the sultry quiet.  But I wait and listen,                                                    5 Till the trodden gravel Tells me, all impatience, It is Phaon’s footstep.     XVIII   The courtyard of her house is wide And cool and still when day departs. Only the rustle of leaves is there   And running water.  And then her mouth, more delicate                                         5 Than the frail wood-anemone, Brushes my cheek, and deeper grow   The purple shadows.     XIX   There is a medlar-tree Growing in front of my lover’s house,   And there all day The wind makes a pleasant sound.  And when the evening comes,                                               5 We sit there together in the dusk,   And watch the stars Appear in the quiet blue.     XX   I behold Arcturus going westward Down the crowded slope of night-dark azure, While the Scorpion with red Antares Trails along the sea-line to the southward.  From the ilex grove there comes soft laughter,—                          5 My companions at their glad love-making,— While that curly-headed boy from Naxos With his jade flute marks the purple quiet.     XXI   Softly the first step of twilight Falls on the darkening dial, One by one kindle the lights   In Mitylene.  Noises are hushed in the courtyard,                                       5 The busy day is departing, Children are called from their games,—   Herds from their grazing.  And from the deep-shadowed angles Comes the soft murmur of lovers,                                         10 Then through the quiet of dusk   Bright sudden laughter.  From the hushed street, through the portal, Where soon my lover will enter, Comes the pure strain of a flute                                         15   Tender with passion.     XXII   Once you lay upon my bosom, While the long blue-silver moonlight Walked the plain, with that pure passion   All your own.  Now the moon is gone, the Pleiads                                         5 Gone, the dead of night is going; Slips the hour, and on my bed   I lie alone.     XXIII   I loved thee, Atthis, in the long ago, When the great oleanders were in flower In the broad herded meadows full of sun. And we would often at the fall of dusk Wander together by the silver stream,                                     5 When the soft grass-heads were all wet with dew, And purple-misted in the fading light. And joy I knew and sorrow at thy voice, And the superb magnificence of love,— The loneliness that saddens solitude,                                    10 And the sweet speech that makes it durable,— The bitter longing and the keen desire, The sweet companionship through quiet days In the slow ample beauty of the world, And the unutterable glad release                                         15 Within the temple of the holy night. O Atthis, how I loved thee long ago In that fair perished summer by the sea!     XXIV   I shall be ever maiden, If thou be not my lover, And no man shall possess me Henceforth and forever.  But thou alone shalt gather                                               5 This fragile flower of beauty,— To crush and keep the fragrance Like a holy incense.  Thou only shalt remember This love of mine, or hallow                                             10 The coming years with gladness, Calm and pride and passion.     XXV   It was summer when I found you In the meadow long ago,— And the golden vetch was growing   By the shore.  Did we falter when love took us                                           5 With a gust of great desire? Does the barley bid the wind wait   In his course?     XXVI   I recall thy white gown, cinctured With a linen belt, whereon Violets were wrought, and scented With strange perfumes out of Egypt.  And I know thy foot was covered                                           5 With fair Lydian broidered straps; And the petals from a rose-tree Fell within the marble basin.     XXVII   Lover, art thou of a surety Not a learner of the wood-god? Has the madness of his music   Never touched thee?  Ah, thou dear and godlike mortal,                                         5 If Pan takes thee for his pupil, Make me but another Syrinx   For that piping.     XXVIII   With your head thrown backward In my arm’s safe hollow, And your face all rosy With the mounting fervour;  While the grave eyes greaten                                              5 With the wise new wonder, Swimming in a love-mist Like the haze of Autumn;  From that throat, the throbbing Nightingale’s for pleading,                                              10 Wayward, soft, and welling Inarticulate love-notes,  Come the words that bubble Up through broken laughter, Sweeter than spring-water,                                               15 “Gods, I am so happy!”     XXIX   Ah, what am I but a torrent, Headstrong, impetuous, broken, Like the spent clamour of waters   In the blue canyon?  Ah, what art thou but a fern-frond,                                       5 Wet with blown spray from the river, Diffident, lovely, sequestered,   Frail on the rock-ledge?  Yet, are we not for one brief day, While the sun sleeps on the mountain,                                    10 Wild-hearted lover and loved one,   Safe in Pan’s keeping?     XXX   Love shakes my soul, like a mountain wind   Falling upon the trees, When they are swayed and whitened and bowed   As the great gusts will.  I know why Daphne sped through the grove                                  5   When the bright god came by, And shut herself in the laurel’s heart   For her silent doom.  Love fills my heart, like my lover’s breath   Filling the hollow flute,                                              10 Till the magic wood awakes and cries   With remembrance and joy.  Ah, timid Syrinx, do I not know   Thy tremor of sweet fear? For a beautiful and imperious player                                     15   Is the lord of life.     XXXI   Love, let the wind cry On the dark mountain, Bending the ash-trees And the tall hemlocks, With the great voice of                                                   5 Thunderous legions, How I adore thee.  Let the hoarse torrent In the blue canyon, Murmuring mightily                                                       10 Out of the grey mist Of primal chaos, Cease not proclaiming How I adore thee.  Let the long rhythm                                                      15 Of crunching rollers, Breaking and bellowing On the white seaboard, Titan and tireless, Tell, while the world stands,                                            20 How I adore thee.  Love, let the clear call Of the tree-cricket, Frailest of creatures, Green as the young grass,                                                25 Mark with his trilling Resonant bell-note, How I adore thee.  Let the glad lark-song Over the meadow,                                                         30 That melting lyric Of molten silver, Be for a signal To listening mortals, How I adore thee.                                                        35  But more than all sounds, Surer, serener, Fuller with passion And exultation, Let the hushed whisper                                                   40 In thine own heart say, How I adore thee.     XXXII   Heart of mine, if all the altars Of the ages stood before me, Not one pure enough nor sacred Could I find to lay this white, white   Rose of love upon.                                                      5  I who am not great enough to Love thee with this mortal body So impassionate with ardour, But oh, not too small to worship   While the sun shall shine,—                                           10  I would build a fragrant temple To thee, in the dark green forest, Of red cedar and fine sandal, And there love thee with sweet service   All my whole life long.                                                15  I would freshen it with flowers, And the piney hill-wind through it Should be sweetened with soft fervours Of small prayers in gentle language   Thou wouldst smile to hear.                                            20  And a tinkling Eastern wind-bell, With its fluttering inscription, From the rafters with bronze music Should retard the quiet fleeting   Of uncounted hours.                                                    25  And my hero, while so human, Should be even as the gods are, In that shrine of utter gladness, With the tranquil stars above it   And the sea below.                                                     30     XXXIII  Never yet, love, in earth’s lifetime, Hath any cunningest minstrel Told the one seventh of wisdom, Ravishment, ecstasy, transport, Hid in the hue of the hyacinth’s   "]]]
