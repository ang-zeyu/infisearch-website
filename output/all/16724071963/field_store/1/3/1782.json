Buck Daniels was speaking seriously, hunting for words, and if he used superlatives it was because he needed them.  \"Extraordinary!\" murmured the doctor, and he repeated the word in a louder tone. It was a rare word for him; in all his scholastic career and in all of his scientific investigations he had found occasion to use so strong a term not more than half a dozen times at the most. He went on, cautiously, and his weak eyes blinked at Daniels: \"And there is a relation between this man and a horse and dog?\"  Buck Daniels shuddered and his colour changed.  \"Listen!\" he said, \"I've talked enough. You ain't going to get another word out of me except this: Doc, have a good sleep, get on your hoss to-morrow mornin', and beat it. Don't even wait for breakfast. Because, if you _do_ wait, you may get a hand in this little hell of ours. You may be waiting, too!\" A sudden thought brought him to his feet. He stood over the doctor. \"How many times,\" he thundered, \"have you seen Kate Cumberland?\"  \"To-day, for the first time.\"  \"Well,\" said Daniels, growling with relief, \"you've seen her enough. I _know_.\" And he turned towards the door. \"Unlock,\" he commanded. \"I'm tired out--and sick--of talking about _him_.\"  But the doctor did not move.  \"Nevertheless,\" he stated, \"you will remain. There is something further which you know and which you will communicate to me.\"  Buck Daniels turned at the door; his face was not pleasant.  \"While observing you as you talked with the girl,\" Byrne said, \"it occurred to me that you were holding information from her. The exact nature of that information I cannot state, but it is reasonable to deduce that you could, at the present moment, name the place where the man for whom Mr. Cumberland and his daughter wait is now located.\"  Buck Daniels made no reply, but he returned to his chair and slumped heavily into it, staring at the little doctor. And Byrne realised with a thrill of pleasure that he was not afraid of death.  \"I may further deduct,\" said the doctor, \"that you will go in person to the place where you know this man may be found and induce him to come to this ranch.\"  The silent anger of Daniels died away. He smiled, and at length he laughed without mirth.  \"Doc,\" he said, \"if you knew where there was a gun, would that make you want to put it up agin your head and pull the trigger?\"  But the doctor proceeded inexorably with his deductions: \"Because you are aware, Mr. Daniels, that the presence of this man may save the life of Mr. Cumberland, a thought, to be sure, which might not be accepted by the medical fraternity, but which may without undue exaggeration devolve from the psychological situation in this house.\"  \"Doc,\" said Daniels huskily, \"you talk straight, and you act straight, and I think you are straight, so I'll take off the bridle and talk free. I know where Whistling Dan is--just about. But if I was to go to him and bring him here I'd bust the heart of Kate Cumberland. D'you understand?\" His voice lowered with an intense emotion. \"I've thought it out sideways and backwards. It's Kate or old Joe. Which is the most important?\"  The doctor straightened in the chair, polished his glasses, and peered once more at the cowpuncher.  \"You are quite sure, also, that the return of this man, this strange wanderer, might help Mr. Cumberland back to health?\"  \"I am, all right. He's sure wrapped up in Whistlin' Dan.\"  \"What is the nature of their relations; what makes him so oddly dependent upon the other?\"  \"I dunno, doc. It's got us all fooled. When Dan is here it seems like old Cumberland jest nacherally lives on the things Dan does and hears and sees. We've seen Cumberland prick up his ears the minute Dan comes into the room, and show life. Sometimes Dan sits with him and tells him what he's been doin'--maybe it ain't any more than how the sky looks that day, or about the feel of the wind--but Joe sits with his eyes dreamin', like a little kid hearin' fairy stories. Kate says it's been that way since her dad first brought Dan in off'n the range. He's been sort of necessary to old Joe--almost like air to breathe. I tell you, it's jest a picture to see them two together.\"  \"Very odd, very odd,\" brooded the doctor, frowning, \"but this seems to be an odd place and an odd set of people. You've no real idea why Dan left the ranch?\"  \"Ask the wild geese,\" said Buck bitterly. He added: \"Maybe you'd better ask Dan's black hoss or his dog, Bart. They'd know better'n anything else.\"  \"But what has the man been doing since he left? Have you any idea?\"  \"Get a little chatter, now and then, of a gent that's rid into a town on a black hoss, prettier'n anything that was ever seen before.  \"It's all pretty much the same, what news we get. Mostly I guess he jest wanders around doin' no harm to nobody. But once in a while somebody sicks a dog on Bart, and Bart jest nacherally chaws that dog in two. Then the owner of the dog may start a fight, and Dan drops him and rides on.\"  \"With a trail of dead men behind him?\" cried the doctor, hunching his shoulders as if to shake off a chill.  \"Dead? Nope. You don't have to shoot to kill when you can handle a gun the way Dan does. Nope, he jest wings 'em. Plants a chunk of lead in a shoulder, or an arm, or a leg. That's all. They ain't no love of blood in Dan--except-----\"  \"Well?\"  \"Doc,\" said Buck with a shudder, \"I ain't goin' to talk about the exceptions. Mostly the news we gets of Dan is about troubles he's had. But sometimes we hear of gents he's helped out when they was sick, and things like that. They ain't nobody like Dan when a gent is down sick, I'll tell a man!\"  The doctor sighed.  He said: \"And do I understand you to say that the girl and this man--Whistling Dan, as you call him--are intimately and sentimentally related?\"  \"She loves him,\" said Daniels slowly. \"She loves the ground he walks on and the places where he's been.\"  \"But, sir, it would seem probable from your own reasoning that the return of the man, in this case, will not be unwelcome to her.\"  \"Reason?\" broke out Daniels bitterly. \"What the hell has reason got to do with Whistling Dan? Man, man! if Barry was to come back d'you suppose he'd remember that he'd once told Kate he loved her? Doc, I know him as near as any man can know him. I tell you, he thinks no more of her than--than the wild geese think of her. If old Joe dies because Dan is away--well, Cumberland is an old man anyway. But how could I stand to see Barry pass Kate by with an empty eye, the way he'd do if he come back? I'd want to kill him, and I'd get bumped off tryin' it, like as not. And what would it do to Kate? It'd kill her, Doc, as sure as you're born.\"  \"Your assumption being,\" murmured the doctor, \"that if she never sees the man again she will eventually forget him.\"  \"D'you forget a knife that's sticking into you? No, she won't forget him. But maybe after a while she'll be able to stand thinkin' about him. She'll get used to the hurt. She'll be able to talk and laugh the way she used to. Oh, doc, if you could of seen her as I've seen her in the old days----\"  \"When the man was with her?\" cut in the doctor.  Buck Daniels caught his breath.  \"Damn your eternal soul, doc!\" he said softly.  And for a time neither of them spoke. Whatever went on in the mind of Daniels, it was something that contorted his face. As for Byrne, he was trying to match fact and possibility and he was finding a large gap between the two; for he tried to visualise the man whose presence had been food to old Joe Cumberland, and whose absence had taken the oil from the lamp so that the flame now flickered dimly, nearly out. But he could build no such picture. He could merely draw together a vague abstraction of a man to whom the storm and the wild geese who ride the storm had meaning and relationship. The logic which he loved was breaking to pieces in the hands of Randall Byrne.  Silence, after all, is only a name, never a fact. There are noises in the most absolute quiet. If there is not even the sound of the cricket or the wind, if there are not even ghost whispers in the house, there is the sigh of one's own breathing, and in those moments of deadly waiting the beat of the heart may be as loud and as awful as the rattle of the death-march. Now, between the doctor and the cowpuncher, such a silence began. Buck Daniels wanted nothing more in the world than to be out of that room, but the eye of the doctor held him, unwilling. And there began once more that eternal waiting, waiting, waiting, which was the horror of the place, until the faint creakings through the windshaken house took on the meaning of footsteps stalking down the hall and pausing at the door, and there was the hushing breath of one who listened and smiled to himself! Now the doctor became aware that the eye of Buck Daniels was widening, brightening; it was as if the mind of the big man were giving way in the strain. His face blanched. Even the lips had no colour, and they moved, gibberingly.  \"Listen!\" he said.  \"It is the wind,\" answered the doctor, but his voice was hardly audible.  \"Listen!\" commanded Daniels again.  The doctor could hear it then. It was a pulse of sound obscure as the thudding of his heart. But it was a human sound and it made his throat close up tightly, as if a hand were settling around his wind-pipe. Buck Daniels rose from his chair; that half-mad, half-listening look was still in his eyes--behind his eyes. Staring at him the doctor understood, intimately, how men can throw their lives away gloriously in battle, fighting for an idea; or how they can commit secret and foul murder. Yet he was more afraid of that pulse of sound than of the face of Buck Daniels. He, also, was rising from his chair, and when Daniels stalked to the side door of the room and leaned there, the doctor followed.  Then they could hear it clearly. There was a note of music in the voice; it was a woman weeping in that room where the chain lay on the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],["title","The Night Horseman (#7)"],["body","oor, coiled loosely like a snake. Buck Daniels straightened and moved away from the door. He began to laugh, guarding it so that not a whisper could break outside the room, and his silent laughter was the most horrible thing the doctor had ever seen. It was only for a moment. The hysteria passed and left the big man shaking like a dead leaf.  \"Doc,\" he said, \"I can't stand it no longer. I'm going out and try to get him back here. And God forgive me for it.\"  He left the room, slamming the door behind him, and then he stamped down the hall as if he were trying to make a companion out of his noise. Doctor Randall Byrne sat down to put his thoughts in order. He began at the following point: \"The physical fact is not; only the immaterial is.\" But before he had carried very far his deductions from this premise, he caught the neighing of a horse near the house; so he went to the window and threw it open. At the same time he heard the rattle of galloping hoofs, and then he saw a horseman riding furiously into the heart of the wind. Almost at once the rider was lost from sight.     CHAPTER VII  JERRY STRANN   The wrath of the Lord seems less terrible when it is localised, and the world at large gave thanks daily that the range of Jerry Strann was limited to the Three B's. As everyone in the mountain-desert knows, the Three B's are Bender, Buckskin, and Brownsville; they make the points of a loose triangle that is cut with canyons and tumbled with mountains, and that triangle was the chosen stamping ground of Jerry Strann. Jerry was not born in the region of the Three B's and why it should have been chosen specially by him was matter which the inhabitants could not puzzle out; but they felt that for their sins the Lord had probably put his wrath among them in the form of Jerry Strann.  He was only twenty-four, this Jerry, but he was already grown into a proverb. Men of the Three B's reckoned their conversational dates by the visits of the youth; if a storm hung over the mountains someone might remark: \"It looks like Jerry Strann is coming,\" and such a remark was always received in gloomy silence; mothers had been known to hush their children by chanting: \"Jerry Strann will get you if you don't watch out.\" Yet he was not an ogre with a red knife between his teeth. He stood at exactly the perfect romantic height; he was just six feet tall; he was as graceful as a young cotton-wood in a windstorm and he was as strong and tough as the roots of the mesquite. He was one of those rare men who are beautiful without being unmanly. His face was modelled with the care a Praxiteles would lavish on a Phoebus. His brown hair was thick and dark and every touch of wind stirred it, and his hazel eyes were brilliant with an enduring light--the inextinguishable joy of life.  Consider that there was no malice in Jerry Strann. But he loved strife as the young Apollo loved strife--or a pure-blooded bull terrier. He fought with distinction and grace and abandon and was perfectly willing to use fists or knives or guns at the pleasure of the other contracting party. In another age, with armour and a golden chain and spurs, Jerry Strann would have been--but why think of that? Swords are not forty-fives, and the Twentieth Century is not the Thirteenth. He was, in fact, born just six hundred years too late. From his childhood he had thirsted for battle as other children thirst for milk: and now he rode anything on hoofs and threw a knife like a Mexican--with either hand--and at short range he did snap shooting with two revolvers that made rifle experts sick at heart.  However, the men of the Three B's, as everyone understands, are not gentle or long-enduring, and you will wonder why this young destroyer was allowed to range at large so long. There was a vital reason. Up in the mountains lived Mac Strann, the hermit-trapper, who hated everything in the wide world except his young brother, the beautiful, wild, and sunny Jerry Strann. And Mac Strann loved his brother as much as he hated everything else; it is impossible to state it more strongly. It was not long before the men of the Three B's discovered how Mac Strann felt about his brother. After Jerry's famous Hallowe'en party in Buckskin, for instance, Williamson, McKenna, and Rath started out to rid the country of the disturber. They went out to hunt him as men go out to hunt a wild mustang. And they caught him and bent him down--those three stark men--and he lay in bed for a month; but before the month was over Mac Strann came down from his mountain and went to Buckskin and gathered Williamson and McKenna and Rath in one public place. And when the morning came Williamson and McKenna and Rath had left this vale of tears and Mac Strann was back on his mountain. He was not even arrested. For there was a devilish cunning about the fellow and he made his victims, without exception, attack him first; then he destroyed them, suddenly and surely, and retreated to his lair. Things like this happened once or twice and then the men of the Three B's understood that it was not wise to lay plots for Jerry Strann. They accepted him, as I have said before, as men accept the wrath of God.  Let it not be thought that Jerry Strann was a solitary like his brother. When he went out for a frolic the young men of the community gathered around him, for Jerry paid all scores and the red-eye flowed in his path like wine before the coming of Bacchus; where Jerry went there was never a dull moment, and young men love action. So it happened that when he rode into Brownsville this day he was the leader of a cavalcade. Rumour rode before them, and doors were locked and windows were darkened, and men sat in the darkness within with their guns across their knees. For Brownsville lay at the extreme northern tip of the triangle and it was rarely visited by Jerry; and it is well established that men fear the unfamiliar more than the known.  As has been said, Jerry headed the train of revellers, partially because it was most unwise to cut in ahead of Jerry and partially because there was not a piece of horseflesh in the Three B's which could outfoot his chestnut. It was a gelding out of the loins of the north wind and sired by the devil himself, and its spirit was one with the spirit of Jerry Strann; perhaps because they both served one master. The cavalcade came with a crash of racing hoofs in a cloud of dust. But in the middle of the street Jerry raised his right arm stiffly overhead with a whoop and brought his chestnut to a sliding stop; the cloud of dust rolled lazily on ahead. The young men gathered quickly around the leader, and there was silence as they waited for him to speak--a silence broken only by the wheezing of the horses, and the stench of sweating horseflesh was in every man's nostrils.  \"Who owns that hoss?\" asked Jerry Strann, and pointed.  He had stopped just opposite O'Brien's hotel, store, blacksmith shop, and saloon, and by the hitching rack was a black stallion. Now, there are some men who carry tidings of their inward strength stamped on their foreheads and written in their eyes. In times of crises crowds will turn to such men and follow them as soldiers follow a captain; for it is patent at a glance that this is a man of men. It is likewise true that there are horses which stand out among their fellows, and this was such a horse. He was such a creature that, if he had been led to a barrier, the entire crowd at the race track would rise as one man and say: \"What is that horse?\" There were points in which some critics would find fault; most of the men of the mountain-desert, for instance, would have said that the animal was too lightly and delicately limbed for long endurance; but as the man of men bears the stamp of his greatness in his forehead and his eyes, so it was with the black stallion. When the thunder of the cavalcade had rushed upon him down the street he had turned with catlike grace and raised his head to see; and his forehead and his eyes arrested Jerry Strann like a levelled rifle. Looking at that proud head one forgot the body of the horse, the symmetry of curves exquisite beyond the sculptor's dream, the arching neck and the steel muscles; one was only conscious of the great spirit. In Human beings we refer to it as \"personality.\"  After a little pause, seeing that no one offered a suggestion as to the identity of the owner, Strann said, softly: \"That hoss is mine.\"  It caused a stir in the crowd of his followers. In the mountain-desert one may deal lightly with a man's wife and lift a random cow or two and settle the score, at need, with a snug \"forty-five\" chunk of lead. But with horses it is different. A horse in the mountain-desert lies outside of all laws--and above all laws. It is greater than honour and dearer than love, and when a man's horse is taken from him the men of the desert gather together and hunt the thief whether it be a day or whether it be a month, and when they have reached him they shoot him like a dog and leave his flesh to the buzzards and his bones to the merciless stars. For all of this there is a reason. But Jerry Strann swung from his mount, tossed the reins over the head of the chestnut, and walked towards the black with hungry eyes. He was careless, also, and venturing too close--the black whirled with his sudden, catlike agility, and two black hoofs lashed within a hair's breadth of the man's shoulder. There was a shout from the crowd, but Jerry Strann stepped back and smiled so that his teeth showed.  \"Boys,\" he said, but he was really speaking to himself, \"there's nothing in the world I want as bad as I want that hoss. Nothing! I'm going to buy him; where's the owner?\"  \"Don't look like a hoss a man would want to sell, Jerry,\" came a suggestion from the cavalcade, who had dismounted and now pressed behind their leader.  Jerry favoured the speaker with another of his enigmatic smiles: \"Oh,\" he chuckled, \"he'll sell, all right! Maybe he's inside. You gents "]]]
