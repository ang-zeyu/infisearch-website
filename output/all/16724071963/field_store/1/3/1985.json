CHAPTER 11.  THE PRINTING OFFICE.  Jotham Anderson, editor and publisher of the \"Centreville Gazette,\" was sitting at his desk penning an editorial paragraph, when the office door opened, and Harry Walton entered.  \"Good-morning, Mr. Anderson,\" said our hero, removing his hat.  \"Good-morning, my friend.  I believe you have the advantage of me,\" replied the editor.  Our hero was taken aback.  It didn't occur to him that the engagement was a far less important event to the publisher than to himself.  He began to be afraid that the place had not been kept open for him.  \"My name is Harry Walton,\" he explained.  \"I was travelling with Prof. Henderson last winter, and called here to get some bills printed.\"  \"Oh yes, I remember you now.  I agreed to take you into the office,\" said the editor, to Harry's great relief.  \"Yes, air.\"  \"You haven't changed your mind, then?--You still want to be a printer?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You have left the Professor, I suppose.\"  \"I left him yesterday.\"  \"What did he pay you?\"  \"Five dollars a week.  He offered me six, if I would stay with him.\"  \"Of course you know that I can't pay you any such wages at present.\"  \"Yes, sir.  You agreed to give me my board the first month, and two dollars a week for six months afterward.\"  \"That is all you will be worth to me at first.  It is a good deal less than you would earn with Professor Henderson.\"  \"I know that, sir; but I am willing to come for that.\"  \"Good.  I see you are in earnest about printing, and that is a good sign.  I wanted you to understand just what you had to expect, so that you need not be disappointed.\"  \"I sha'n't be disappointed, sir,\" said Harry confidently.  \"I have made up my mind to be a printer, and if you didn't receive me into your office, I would try to get in somewhere else.\"  \"Then no more need be said.  When do you want to begin?\"  \"I am ready any time.\"  \"Where is your trunk?\"  \"At the tavern.\"  \"You can have it brought over to my house whenever you please.  The hotel-keeper will send it over for you.  He is our expressman.  Come into the house now, and I will introduce you to my wife.\"  The editor's home was just across the street from his printing office.  Followed by Harry he crossed the street, opened the front door, and led the way into the sitting-room, where a pleasant-looking lady of middle age was seated.  \"My dear,\" he said, \"I bring you a new boarder.\"  She looked at Harry inquiringly.  \"This young man,\" her husband explained, \"is going into the office to learn printing.  I have taken a contract to make a second Benjamin Franklin of him.\"  \"Then you'll do more for him than you have been able to do for yourself,\" said Mrs. Anderson, smiling.  \"You are inclined to be severe, Mrs. Anderson, but I fear you are correct.  However, I can be like a guide-post, which points the way which it does not travel.  Can you show Harry Walton--for that is his name--where you propose to put him?\"  \"I am afraid I must give you a room in the attic,\" said Mrs. Anderson.  \"Our house is small, and all the chambers on the second floor are occupied.\"  \"I am not at all particular,\" said Harry.  \"I have not been accustomed to elegant accommodations.\"  \"If you will follow me upstairs, I will show you your room.\"  Pausing on the third landing, Mrs. Anderson found the door of a small but comfortable bed-room.  There was no carpet on the floor, but it was painted yellow, and scrupulously clean.  A bed, two chairs, a bureau and wash-stand completed the list of furniture.  \"I shall like this room very well,\" said our hero.  \"There is a closet,\" said the lady, pointing to a door in the corner. \"It is large enough to contain your trunk, if you choose to put it in there.  I hope you don't smoke.\"  \"Oh, no, indeed,\" said Harry, laughing.  \"I haven't got so far along as that.\"  \"Mr. Anderson's last apprentice--he is a journeyman now--was a smoker.  He not only scented up the room, but as he was very careless about lights, I was continually alarmed lest he should set the house on fire.  Finally, I got so nervous that I asked him to board somewhere else.\"  \"Is he working for Mr. Anderson now?\"  \"Yes; you probably saw him in the office.\"  \"I saw two young men at the case.\"  \"The one I speak of is the youngest.  His name is John Clapp.\"  \"There is no danger of my smoking.  I don't think it would do me any good.  Besides, it is expensive, and I can't afford it.\"  \"I see we think alike,\" said Mrs. Anderson, smiling.  \"I am sure we will get along well together.\"  \"I shall try not to give you any trouble,\" said our hero, and his tone, which was evidently sincere, impressed Mrs. Anderson still more favorably.  \"You won't find me very hard to suit, I hope.  I suppose you will be here to supper?\"  \"If it will he quite convenient.  My trunk is at the tavern, and I could stay there till morning, if you wished.\"  \"Oh, no, come at once.  Take possession of the room now, if you like, and leave an order to have your trunk brought here.\"  \"Thank you.  What is your hour for supper?\"  \"Half-past five.\"  \"Thank you.  I will go over and speak to Mr. Anderson a minute.\"  The editor looked up as Harry reappeared.  \"Well, have you settled arrangements with Mrs. Anderson?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir, I believe so.\"  \"I hope you like your room.\"  \"It is very comfortable.  It won't take me long to feel at home there.\"  \"Did she ask you whether you smoked?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I thought she would.  That's where Clapp and she fell out.\"  Harry's attention was drawn to a thin, sallow young man of about twenty, who stood at a case on the opposite side of the room.  \"Mrs. Anderson was afraid I would set the house on fire,\" said the young man thus referred to.  \"Yes, she felt nervous about it.  However, it is not surprising.  An uncle of hers lost his house in that way.  I suppose you don't smoke, Walton?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Clapp smokes for his health.  You see how stout and robust he is,\" said the editor, a little satirically.  \"It doesn't do me any harm,\" said Clapp, a little testily.  \"Oh, well, I don't interfere with you, though I think you would be better off if you should give up the habit.  Ferguson don't smoke.\"  This was the other compositor, a man of thirty, whose case was not far distant from Clapp's.  \"I can't afford it,\" said Ferguson; \"nor could Clapp, if he had a wife and two young children to support.\"  \"Smoking doesn't cost much,\" said the younger journeyman.  \"So you think; but did you ever reckon it up?\"  \"No.\"  \"Don't you keep any accounts?\"  \"No; I spend when I need to, and I can always tell how much I have left.  What's the use of keeping accounts?\"  \"You can tell how you stand.\"  \"I can tell that without taking so much trouble.\"  \"You see we must all agree to disagree,\" said Mr. Anderson.  \"I am afraid Clapp isn't going to be a second Benjamin Franklin.\"  \"Who is?\" asked Clapp.  \"Our young friend here,\" said the editor.  \"Oh, is he?\" queried the other with a sneer.  \"It'll be a great honor I'm sure, to have him in the office.\"  \"Come, no chaffing, Clapp,\" said Mr. Anderson.  Harry hastened to disclaim the charge, for Clapp's sneer affected him disagreeably.  \"I admire Franklin,\" he said, \"but there isn't much danger of my turning out a second edition of him.\"  \"Professional already, I see, Walton,\" said the editor.  \"When shall I go to work, Mr. Anderson?\"  \"Whenever you are ready.\"  \"I am ready now.\"  \"You are prompt.\"  \"You won't be in such a hurry to go to work a week hence,\" said Clapp.  \"I think I shall,\" said Harry.  \"I am anxious to learn as fast as possible.\"  \"Oh, I forgot.  You want to become a second Franklin.\"  \"I sha'n't like him,\" thought our hero.  \"He seems to try to make himself disagreeable.\"  \"Mr. Ferguson will give you some instruction, and set you to work,\" said his employer.  Harry was glad that it was from the older journeyman that he was to receive his first lesson, and not from the younger.     CHAPTER III.  HARRY STUMBLES UPON AN ACQUAINTANCE.  After supper Harry went round to the tavern to see about his trunk. A group of young men were in the bar-room, some of whom looked up as he entered.  Among these was Luke Harrison, who was surprised and by no means pleased to see his creditor.  Harry recognized him at the same instant, and said, \"How are you, Luke?\"  \"Is that you, Walton?\" said Luke.  \"What brings you to Centreville? Professor Henderson isn't here, is he?\"  \"No; I have left him.\"  \"Oh, you're out of a job, are you?\" asked Luke, in a tone of satisfaction, for we are apt to dislike those whom we have injured, and for this reason he felt by no means friendly.  \"No, I'm not,\" said Harry, quietly.  \"I've found work in Centreville.\"  \"Gone back to pegging, have you?  Whose shop are you in?\"  \"I am in a different business.\"  \"You don't say!  What is it?\" asked Luke, with some curiosity.  \"I'm in the office of the 'Centreville Gazette.'  I'm going to learn the printing business.\"  \"You are?  Why, I've got a friend in the office,--John Clapp.  He never told me about your being there.\"  \"He didn't know I was coming.  I only went to work this afternoon.\"  \"So you are the printer's devil?\" said Luke, with a slight sneer.  \"I believe so,\" answered our hero, quietly.  \"Do you get good pay?\"  \"Not much at first.  However, I can get along with what money I have, _and what is due me_.\"  Luke Harrison understood the last allusion, and turned away abruptly. He had no wish to pay up the money which he owed Harry, and for this reason was sorry to see him in the village.  He feared, if the conversation were continued, Harry would be asking for the money, and this would be disagreeable.  At this moment John Clapp entered the bar-room.  He nodded slightly to Harry, but walked up to Luke, and greeted him cordially.  There were many points of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12741"],["title","Risen from the Ranks; Or, Harry Walton's Success (#2)"],["body","between them, and this drew them into habits of intimacy.  \"Will you have something to drink, Harrison?\" said Clapp.  \"I don't mind if I do,\" answered Luke, with alacrity.  They walked up to the bar, and they were soon pledging each other in a fiery fluid which was not very likely to benefit either of them. Meanwhile Harry gave directions about his trunk, and left the room.  \"So you've got a new 'devil' in your office,\" said Luke, after draining his glass.  \"Yes.  He came this afternoon.  How did you hear?\"  \"He told me.\"  \"Do you know him?\" asked Clapp, in some surprise.  \"Yes.  I know him as well as I want to.\"  \"What sort of a fellow is he?\"  \"Oh, he's a sneak--one of your pious chaps, that 'wants to be an angel, and with the angels stand.'\"  \"Then he's made a mistake in turning 'devil,'\" said Clapp.  \"Good for you!\" said Luke, laughing.  \"You're unusually brilliant to-night, Clapp.\"  \"So he's a saint, is he?\"  \"He set up for one; but I don't like his style myself.  He's as mean as dirt.  Why I knew him several months, and he never offered to treat in all that time.  He's as much afraid of spending a cent as if it were a dollar.\"  \"He won't have many dollars to spend just at present.  He's working for his board.\"  \"Oh, he's got money saved up,\" said Luke.  \"Fellows like him hang on to a cent when they get it.  I once asked him to lend me a few dollars, just for a day or two, but he wouldn't do it.  I hate such mean fellows.\"  \"So do I.  Will you have a cigar?\"  \"I'll treat this time,\" said Luke, who thought it polite to take his turn in treating once to his companion's four or five times.  \"Thank you.  From what you say, I am sorry Anderson has taken the fellow into the office.\"  \"You needn't have much to say to him.\"  \"I shan't trouble myself much about him.  I didn't like his looks when I first set eyes on him.  I suppose old Mother Anderson will like him.  She couldn't abide my smoking, and he won't trouble her that way.\"  \"So; he's too mean to buy the cigars.\"  \"He said he couldn't afford it.\"  \"That's what it comes to.  By the way, Clapp, when shall we take another ride?\"  \"I can get away nest Monday afternoon, at three.\"  \"All right.  I'll manage to get off at the same time.  We'll go to Whiston and take supper at the hotel.  It does a fellow good to get off now and then.  It won't cost more than five dollars apiece altogether.\"  \"We'll get the carriage charged.  The fact is, I'm little low on funds.\"  \"So am I, but it won't matter.  Griffin will wait for his pay.\"  While Harry's character waa being so unfavorably discussed, he was taking a walk by himself, observing with interest the main features of his new home.  He had been here before with Professor Henderson, but had been too much occupied at that time to get a very clear idea of Centreville, nor had it then the interest for him which it had acquired since.  He went upon a hill overlooking the village, and obtained an excellent view from its summit.  It was a pleasant, well-built village of perhaps three thousand inhabitants, with outlying farms and farm-houses.  Along the principal streets the dwellings and stores were closely built, so as to make it seem quite city-like.  It was the shire town of the county, and being the largest place in the neighborhood, country people for miles around traded at its stores.  Farmers' wives came to Centreville to make purchases, just as ladies living within a radius of thirty miles visit New York and Boston, for a similar purpose.  Altogether, therefore, Centreville was quite a lively place, and a town of considerable local importance.  The fact that it had a weekly paper of its own, contributed to bring it into notice.  Nor was that all. Situated on a little hillock was a building with a belfry, which might have been taken for a church but for a play-ground near by, which indicated that it had a different character.  It was in fact the Prescott Academy, so called from the name of its founder, who had endowed it with a fund of ten thousand dollars, besides erecting the building at his own expense on land bought for the purpose.  This academy also had a local reputation, and its benefits were not confined to the children of Centreville.  There were about twenty pupils from other towns who boarded with the Principal or elsewhere in the town, and made up the whole number of students in attendance--about eighty on an average.  Standing on the eminence referred to, Harry's attention was drawn to the Academy, and he could not help forming the wish that he, too, might share in its advantages.  \"There is so much to learn, and I know so little,\" he thought.  But he did not brood over the poverty which prevented him from gratifying his desire.  He knew it would do no good, and he also reflected that knowledge may be acquired in a printing office as well as within the walls of an academy or college.  \"As soon as I get well settled,\" he said to himself, \"I mean to get some books and study a little every day.  That is the way Franklin did.  I never can be an editor, that's certain, without knowing more than I do now.  Before I am qualified to teach others, I must know something myself.\"  Looking at the village which lay below him, Harry was disposed to congratulate himself on his new residence.  \"It looks like a pleasant place,\" he said to himself, \"and when I get a little acquainted, I shall enjoy myself very well, I am sure.  Of course I shall feel rather lonely just at first.\"  He was so engrossed by his thoughts that he did not take heed to his steps, and was only reminded of his abstraction by his foot suddenly coming in contact with a boy who was lying under a tree, and pitching headfirst over him.  \"Holloa!\" exclaimed the latter, \"what are you about?  You didn't take me for a foot-ball, did you?\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" said Harry, jumping up in some confusion.  \"I was so busy thinking that I didn't see you.  I hope I didn't hurt you.\"  \"Nothing serious.  Didn't you hurt yourself?\"  \"I bumped my head a little, but it only struck the earth.  If it had been a stone, it might have been different.  I had no idea there was any one up here except myself.\"  \"It was very kind of you to bow so low to a perfect stranger,\" said the other, his eyes twinkling humorously.  \"I suppose it would only be polite for me to follow your example.\"  \"I'll excuse you,\" said Harry laughing.  \"Thank you.  That takes a great burden off my mind.  I don't like to be outdone in politeness, but really I shouldn't like to tumble over you.  My head may be softer than yours.  There's one thing clear.  We ought to know each other.  As you've taken the trouble to come up here, and stumble over me, I really feel as if we ought to strike up a friendship.  What do you say?\"  \"With all my heart,\" said our hero.     CHAPTER IV.  OSCAR VINCENT.  \"Allow me to introduce myself,\" said the stranger boy.  \"My name is Oscar Vincent, from Boston, at present a student at the Prescott Academy, at your service.\"  As he spoke, he doffed his hat and bowed, showing a profusion of chestnut hair, a broad, open brow, and an attractive face, lighted up by a pleasant smile.  Harry felt drawn to him by a feeling which was not long in ripening into friendship.  Imitating the other's frankness, he also took off his hat and replied,--  \"Let me introduce myself, in turn, as Harry Walton, junior apprentice in the office of the 'Centreville Gazette,' sometimes profanely called 'printer's devil.'\"  \"Good!\" said Oscar, laughing.  \"How do you like the business?\"  \"I think I shall like it, but I have only just started in it.  I went into the office for the first time to-day.\"  \"I have an uncle who started as you are doing,\" said Oscar.  \"He is now chief editor of a daily paper in Boston.\"  \"Is he?\" said Harry, with interest.  \"Did he find it hard to rise?\"  \"He is a hard worker.  I have heard him say that he used to sit up late of nights during his apprenticeship, studying and improving himself.\"  \"That is what I mean to do,\" said Harry.  \"I don't think he was as lazy as his nephew,\" said Oscar.  \"I am afraid if I had been in his place I should have remained in it.\"  \"Are you lazy?\" asked Harry, smiling at the other's frankness.  \"A little so; that is, I don't improve my opportunities as I might. Father wants to make a lawyer of me so he has put me here, and I am preparing for Harvard.\"  \"I envy you,\" said Harry.  \"There is nothing I should like so much as entering college.\"  \"I daresay I shall like it tolerably well,\" said Oscar; \"but I don't _hanker_ after it, as the boy said after swallowing a dose of castor oil.  I'll tell you what I should like better--\"  \"What?\" asked Harry, as the other paused.  \"I should like to enter the Naval Academy, and qualify myself for the naval service.  I always liked the sea.\"  \"Doesn't your father approve of your doing this?\"  \"He wouldn't mind my entering the navy as an officer, but he is not willing to have me enter the merchant service.\"  \"Then why doesn't he send you to the Naval Academy?\"  \"Because I can't enter without receiving the appointment from a member of Congress.  Our member can only appoint one, and there is no vacancy.  So, as I can't go where I want to, I am preparing for Harvard.\"  \"Are you studying Latin and Greek?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Have you studied them long?\"  \"About two years.  I was looking over my Greek lesson when you playfully tumbled over me.\"  \"Will you let me look at your book?  I never saw a Greek book.\"  \"I sometimes wish I never had,\" said Oscar; \"but that's when I am lazy.\"  Harry opened the book--a Greek reader--in the middle of an extract from Xenophon, and looked with some awe at the unintelligible letters.  \"Can you read it?  Can you understand what it means?\" he asked, looking up from the book.  \"So-so.\"  \"You must know a great deal.\"  Oscar laughed.  \"I wonder what Dr. Burton would say if he heard you,\" he said.  \"Who is he?\"  \"Principal of our Academy.   He gave me a blowing up for my ignorance to-day, because I"]]]
