THE MEADOW       Here when the cloudless April days begin,         And the quaint crows flock thicker day by day,     Filling the forests with a pleasant din,         And the soiled snow creeps secretly away,     Comes the small busy sparrow, primed with glee,         First preacher in the naked wilderness,         Piping an end to all the long distress     From every fence and every leafless tree.      Now with soft slight and viewless artifice         Winter's iron work is wondrously undone;     In all the little hollows cored with ice         The clear brown pools stand simmering in the sun,     Frail lucid worlds, upon whose tremulous floors         All day the wandering water-bugs at will,         Shy mariners whose oars are never still,     Voyage and dream about the heightening shores.      The bluebird, peeping from the gnarlèd thorn,         Prattles upon his frolic flute, or flings,     In bounding flight across the golden morn,         An azure gleam from off his splendid wings.     Here the slim-pinioned swallows sweep and pass         Down to the far-off river; the black crow         With wise and wary visage to and fro     Settles and stalks about the withered grass.      Here, when the murmurous May-day is half gone,         The watchful lark before my feet takes flight,     And wheeling to some lonelier field far on,         Drops with obstreperous cry; and here at night,     When the first star precedes the great red moon,         The shore-lark tinkles from the darkening field,         Somewhere, we know not, in the dusk concealed,     His little creakling and continuous tune.      Here, too, the robins, lusty as of old,         Hunt the waste grass for forage, or prolong     From every quarter of these fields the bold,         Blithe phrases of their never-finished song.     The white-throat's distant descant with slow stress         Note after note upon the noonday falls,         Filling the leisured air at intervals     With his own mood of piercing pensiveness.      How often from this windy upland perch,         Mine eyes have seen the forest break in bloom,     The rose-red maple and the golden birch,         The dusty yellow of the elms, the gloom     Of the tall poplar hung with tasseled black;         Ah, I have watched, till eye and ear and brain         Grew full of dreams as they, the moted plain,     The sun-steeped wood, the marsh-land at its back,      The valley where the river wheels and fills,         Yon city glimmering in its smoky shroud,     And out at the last misty rim the hills         Blue and far off and mounded like a cloud,     And here the noisy rutted road that goes         Down the slope yonder, flanked on either side         With the smooth-furrowed fields flung black and wide,     Patched with pale water sleeping in the rows.      So as I watched the crowded leaves expand,         The bloom break sheath, the summer's strength uprear,     In earth's great mother's heart already planned         The heaped and burgeoned plenty of the year,     Even as she from out her wintry cell         My spirit also sprang to life anew,         And day by day as the spring's bounty grew,     Its conquering joy possessed me like a spell.      In reverie by day and midnight dream         I sought these upland fields and walked apart,     Musing on Nature, till my thought did seem         To read the very secrets of her heart;     In mooded moments earnest and sublime         I stored the themes of many a future song,         Whose substance should be Nature's, clear and strong,     Bound in a casket of majestic rhyme.      Brave bud-like plans that never reached the fruit,         Like hers our mother's who with every hour,     Easily replenished from the sleepless root,         Covers her bosom with fresh bud and flower;     Yet I was happy as young lovers be,         Who in the season of their passion's birth         Deem that they have their utmost worship's worth,     If love be near them, just to hear and see.     IN MAY       Grief was my master yesternight;         To-morrow I may grieve again;         But now along the windy plain           The clouds have taken flight.      The sowers in the furrows go;         The lusty river brimmeth on;         The curtains from the hills are gone;           The leaves are out; and lo,      The silvery distance of the day,         The light horizons, and between         The glory of the perfect green,           The tumult of the May.      The bobolinks at noonday sing         More softly than the softest flute,         And lightlier than the lightest lute           Their fairy tambours ring.      The roads far off are towered with dust;         The cherry-blooms are swept and thinned;         In yonder swaying elms the wind           Is charging gust on gust.      But here there is no stir at all;         The ministers of sun and shadow         Horde all the perfumes of the meadow           Behind a grassy wall.      An infant rivulet wind-free         Adown the guarded hollow sets,         Over whose brink the violets           Are nodding peacefully.      From pool to pool it prattles by;         The flashing swallows dip and pass,         Above the tufted marish grass,           And here at rest am I.      I care not for the old distress,         Nor if to-morrow bid me moan;         To-day is mine, and I have known           An hour of blessedness.     LIFE AND NATURE       I passed through the gates of the city,       The streets were strange and still,     Through the doors of the open churches       The organs were moaning shrill.      Through the doors and the great high windows       I heard the murmur of prayer,     And the sound of their solemn singing       Streamed out on the sunlit air;      A sound of some great burden       That lay on the world's dark breast,     Of the old, and the sick, and the lonely,       And the weary that cried for rest.      I strayed through the midst of the city       Like one distracted or mad.     \"Oh, Life! Oh, Life!\" I kept saying,       And the very word seemed sad.      I passed through the gates of the city,       And I heard the small birds sing,     I laid me down in the meadows       Afar from the bell-ringing.      In the depth and the bloom of the meadows       I lay on the earth's quiet breast,     The poplar fanned me with shadows,       And the veery sang me to rest.      Blue, blue was the heaven above me,       And the earth green at my feet;     \"Oh, Life! Oh, Life!\" I kept saying,       And the very word seemed sweet.     WITH THE NIGHT       O doubts, dull passions, and base fears,       That harassed and oppressed the day,     Ye poor remorses and vain tears,       That shook this house of clay:      All heaven to the western bars       Is glittering with the darker dawn;     Here with the earth, the night, the stars,       Ye have no place: begone!     JUNE       Long, long ago, it seems, this summer morn         That pale-browed April passed with pensive tread         Through the frore woods, and from its frost-bound bed     Woke the arbutus with her silver horn;             And now May, too, is fled,     The flower-crowned month, the merry laughing May,         With rosy feet and fingers dewy wet,     Leaving the woods and all cool gardens gay         With tulips and the scented violet.      Gone are the wind-flower and the adder-tongue         And the sad drooping bellwort, and no more         The snowy trilliums crowd the forest's floor;     The purpling grasses are no longer young,             And summer's wide-set door     O'er the thronged hills and the broad panting earth         Lets in the torrent of the later bloom,     Haytime, and harvest, and the after mirth,         The slow soft rain, the rushing thunder plume.      All day in garden alleys moist and dim,         The humid air is burdened with the rose;         In moss-deep woods the creamy orchid blows;     And now the vesper-sparrows' pealing hymn             From every orchard close     At eve comes flooding rich and silvery;         The daisies in great meadows swing and shine;     And with the wind a sound as of the sea         Roars in the maples and the topmost pine.      High in the hills the solitary thrush         Tunes magically his music of fine dreams,         In briary dells, by boulder-broken streams;     And wide and far on nebulous fields aflush             The mellow morning gleams.     The orange cone-flowers purple-bossed are there,         The meadow's bold-eyed gypsies deep of hue,     And slender hawkweed tall and softly fair,         And rosy tops of fleabane veiled with dew.      So with thronged voices and unhasting flight         The fervid hours with long return go by;         The far-heard hylas piping shrill and high     Tell the slow moments of the solemn night             With unremitting cry;     Lustrous and large out of the gathering drouth         The planets gleam; the baleful Scorpion     Trails his dim fires along the droused south;         The silent world-incrusted round moves on.      And all the dim night long the moon's white beams         Nestle deep down in every brooding tree,       "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12664"],["title","Lyrics of Earth (#2)"],["body","  And sleeping birds, touched with a silly glee,     Waken at midnight from their blissful dreams,             And carol brokenly.     Dim surging motions and uneasy dreads         Scare the light slumber from men's busy eyes,     And parted lovers on their restless beds         Toss and yearn out, and cannot sleep for sighs.      Oft have I striven, sweet month, to figure thee,         As dreamers of old time were wont to feign,         In living form of flesh, and striven in vain;     Yet when some sudden old-world mystery             Of passion fired my brain,     Thy shape hath flashed upon me like no dream,         Wandering with scented curls that heaped the breeze,     Or by the hollow of some reeded stream         Sitting waist-deep in white anemones;      And even as I glimpsed thee thou wert gone,         A dream for mortal eyes too proudly coy,         Yet in thy place for subtle thought's employ     The golden magic clung, a light that shone             And filled me with thy joy.     Before me like a mist that streamed and fell         All names and shapes of antique beauty passed     In garlanded procession with the swell         Of flutes between the beechen stems; and last,      I saw the Arcadian valley, the loved wood,         Alpheus stream divine, the sighing shore,         And through the cool green glades, awake once more,     Psyche, the white-limbed goddess, still pursued,             Fleet-footed as of yore,     The noonday ringing with her frighted peals,         Down the bright sward and through the reeds she ran,     Urged by the mountain echoes, at her heels         The hot-blown cheeks and trampling feet of Pan.     DISTANCE       To the distance! Ah, the distance!         Blue and broad and dim!     Peace is not in burgh or meadow,         But beyond the rim.      Aye, beyond it, far beyond it;         Follow still my soul,     Till this earth is lost in heaven,         And thou feel'st the whole.     THE BIRD AND THE HOUR       The sun looks over a little hill       And floods the valley with gold--             A torrent of gold;     And the hither field is green and still;       Beyond it a cloud outrolled,       Is glowing molten and bright;     And soon the hill, and the valley and all,             With a quiet fall,       Shall be gathered into the night.       And yet a moment more,             Out of the silent wood,       As if from the closing door     Of another world and another lovelier mood,       Hear'st thou the hermit pour--             So sweet! so magical!--     His golden music, ghostly beautiful.     AFTER RAIN       For three whole days across the sky,     In sullen packs that loomed and broke,     With flying fringes dim as smoke,     The columns of the rain went by;     At every hour the wind awoke;         The darkness passed upon the plain;         The great drops rattled at the pane.      Now piped the wind, or far aloof     Fell to a sough remote and dull;     And all night long with rush and lull     The rain kept drumming on the roof:     I heard till ear and sense were full         The clash or silence of the leaves,         The gurgle in the creaking eaves.      But when the fourth day came--at noon,     The darkness and the rain were by;     The sunward roofs were steaming dry;     And all the world was flecked and strewn     With shadows from a fleecy sky.         The haymakers were forth and gone,         And every rillet laughed and shone.      Then, too, on me that loved so well     The world, despairing in her blight,     Uplifted with her least delight,     On me, as on the earth, there fell     New happiness of mirth and might;         I strode the valleys pied and still;         I climbed upon the breezy hill.      I watched the gray hawk wheel and drop,     Sole shadow on the shining world;     I saw the mountains clothed and curled,     With forest ruffling to the top;     I saw the river's length unfurled,         Pale silver down the fruited plain,         Grown great and stately with the rain.      Through miles of shadow and soft heat,     Where field and fallow, fence and tree,     Were all one world of greenery,     I heard the robin ringing sweet,     The sparrow piping silverly,         The thrushes at the forest's hem;         And as I went I sang with them.     CLOUD-BREAK       With a turn of his magical rod,     That extended and suddenly shone,     From the round of his glory some god     Looks forth and is gone.      To the summit of heaven the clouds     Are rolling aloft like steam;     There's a break in their infinite shrouds,     And below it a gleam.     O'er the drift of the river a whiff     Comes out from the blossoming shore;     And the meadows are greening, as if     They never were green before.      The islands are kindled with gold     And russet and emerald dye;     And the interval waters outrolled     Are more blue than the sky.     From my feet to the heart of the hills     The spirits of May intervene,     And a vapor of azure distills     Like a breath on the opaline green.      Only a moment!--and then     The chill and the shadow decline,     On the eyes of rejuvenate men     That were wide and divine.     THE MOON-PATH       The full, clear moon uprose and spread       Her cold, pale splendor o'er the sea;     A light-strewn path that seemed to lead       Outward into eternity.     Between the darkness and the gleam       An old-world spell encompassed me:     Methought that in a godlike dream       I trod upon the sea.      And lo! upon that glimmering road,       In shining companies unfurled,     The trains of many a primal god,       The monsters of the elder world;     Strange creatures that, with silver wings,       Scarce touched the ocean's thronging floor,     The phantoms of old tales, and things       Whose shapes are known no more.      Giants and demi-gods who once       Were dwellers of the earth and sea,     And they who from Deucalion's stones,       Rose men without an infancy;     Beings on whose majestic lids       Time's solemn secrets seemed to dwell,     Tritons and pale-limbed Nereids,       And forms of heaven and hell.      Some who were heroes long of yore,       When the great world was hale and young;     And some whose marble lips yet pour       The murmur of an antique tongue;     Sad queens, whose names are like soft moans,       Whose griefs were written up in gold;     And some who on their silver thrones       Were goddesses of old.      As if I had been dead indeed,       And come into some after-land,     I saw them pass me, and take heed,       And touch me with each mighty hand;     And evermore a murmurous stream,       So beautiful they seemed to me,     Not less than in a godlike dream       I trod the shining sea.     COMFORT OF THE FIELDS       What would'st thou have for easement after grief,       When the rude world hath used thee with despite,       And care sits at thine elbow day and night,     Filching thy pleasures like a subtle thief?     To me, when life besets me in such wise,     'Tis sweetest to break forth, to drop the chain,       And grasp the freedom of this pleasant earth,       To roam in idleness and sober mirth,     Through summer airs and summer lands, and drain     The comfort of wide fields unto tired eyes.      By hills and waters, farms and solitudes,       To wander by the day with wilful feet;       Through fielded valleys wide with yellowing wheat;     Along gray roads that run between deep woods,     Murmurous and cool; through hallowed slopes of pine,       Where the long daylight dreams, unpierced, unstirred,       And only the rich-throated thrush is heard;     By lonely forest brooks that froth and shine       In bouldered crannies buried in the hills;     By broken beeches tangled with wild vine,       And log-strewn rivers murmurous with mills.      In upland pastures, sown with gold, and sweet       With the keen perfume of the ripening grass,       Where wings of birds and filmy shadows pass,     Spread thick as stars with shining marguerite;     To haunt old fences overgrown with brier,       Muffled in vines, and hawthorns, and wild cherries,       Rank poisonous ivies, red-bunched elderberries,     And pièd blossoms to the heart's desire,       Gray mullein towering into yellow bloom,       Pink-tasseled milkweed, breathing dense perfume,     And swarthy vervain, tipped with violet fire.      To hear at eve the bleating of far flocks,       The mud-hen's whistle from the marsh at morn;       To skirt with deafened ears and brain o'erborne     Some foam-filled rapid charging down its rocks     With iron roar of waters; far away       Across wide-reeded meres, pensive with noon,       To hear the querulous outcry of the loon;     To lie among deep rocks, and watch all day       On liquid heights the snowy clouds melt by;     Or hear from wood-capped mountain-brows the jay       Pierce the bright morning with his jibing cry.      To feast on summer sounds; the jolted wains,       The thrasher humming from the farm near by,       The prattling cricket's intermittent cry,     The locust's rattle from the sultry lanes;     Or in the shadow of some oaken spray,       To watch, as through a mist of light and dreams,       The far-off hay-fields, where the dusty teams     Drive round and round the lessening squares of hay,       And hear upon the wind, now loud, now low,     With drowsy cadence half a summer's day,       The clatter of the reapers come and go.      Far violet hills, horizons filmed with showers,       The murmur of cool streams, the forest's gloom,       The voices of the breathing grass, the hum     Of ancient gardens overbanked with flowers:     Thus, with a smile as golden as the dawn,       And cool fair fingers radiantly divine,       The mighty mother brings us in her hand,     For all tired eyes and foreheads pinched and wan,     Her restful cup, her beaker of bright wine:       Drink, and be filled,"]]]
