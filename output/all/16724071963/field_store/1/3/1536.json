There were no signs now of tears or weakness; he was a man fighting for what he believed to be right and just.  \"Captain, that man is a dirty liar!\" he cried hotly. \"He and his precious cronies tried to rob me, out there. I was coming into town from across the bay; I had hired a Spaniard to bring me across in a small sailboat, and the tide carried us down too far, so I told him to land and I'd walk back to town, rather than tack back. And these men met me, and tried to rob me! This man,\" he accused excitedly, pointing a rageful finger at Swift, \"was going to stab me in the throat when he saw I resisted. I was fighting the three, and they were getting the best of me. I never owned a gun, and I just had my fists. The two others had grabbed me, and this man Swift pulled a knife. I remember one of them saying: 'Don't shoot--it'll bring the whole town out!' And just as this one raised his knife to drive it into my throat--they were bending me backwards, the other two--I heard a shot, and this one dropped his knife and gave a yell. There were two other shots, and the two who were holding me dropped. This one ran off. Then--\" The boy turned and looked down at Jack, smoking his cigarette and trying to read what lay behind the stolid stare of the twelve men who sat in a solemn row on the bunks opposite him. \"This young man--\" His lips trembled, and he stopped, to bite them into a more manlike firmness.  \"Gentlemen, do what you like with me, but you've got to let this man go! He's the coolest, bravest man I ever saw! He saved my life. You can't hang him for protecting a man from murder and robbery!\"  \"Young man,\" interrupted the Captain after a surprised silence, \"we admire your generosity in trying to clear your fellow prisoner, but you must let this jury try his case. What's your name?\"  \"John Belden, of Cambridge, Massachusetts.\" The young fellow's rage faded to a sullen calm under the cold voice.  The Captain made a startled movement and looked at him sharply. \"And what was your hurry to get to town?\" he asked, after a minute.  \"I wanted to get a ticket on the boat, the _Mary Elizabeth_, that is going to leave for New York to-morrow. I wanted to go--home. I've had enough of gold-hunting!\" Youthful bitterness was in his tone and in the look he turned on the jury.  The Captain cleared his throat. When he spoke again, he addressed the twelve before him:  \"Gentlemen of the jury, I have reasons for feeling convinced that this young man is in part telling the truth. I am acquainted with his father, unless he has given a name he does not own--and his face is a pretty good witness for him; he looks like his dad. While he has undoubtedly glossed and warped the story of the shooting in a mistaken effort to make things look better for the man who did the killing, I can see no sufficient reason for holding him. This Committee stands for justice and is not backward about tempering it with mercy. Gentlemen of the jury, I recommend that John Belden be released from custody and permitted to go home. He was unarmed when I took him, and there is no evidence of his having dealt anything but hard words to the victims of the shooting. Gentlemen, you will give your verdict; after which we will proceed with the investigation.\"  The jury looked at one another and nodded to the man on the end of the first bunk; and he, shifting a quid of tobacco to the slack of his right cheek, expectorated gravely into the sand and spoke solemnly:  \"The verdict of the jury is all in favor of turnin' the kid loose.\"  \"John Belden, you are released. And we'd advise you to be a little careful how you sass men in this country. Also, you better see about that ticket on the _Mary Elizabeth_. Jack Allen, you may come forward and take the oath.\"  \"This box is just as comfortable as that one,\" said Jack, \"and you needn't worry but what I'll tell the truth!\" He took a last pull at his cigarette, pinched out the fire, and ground the stub under his heel. He could feel the silence grow tense with expectancy; and when he lifted his eyes, he knew that every man in that tent was staring into his face.  \"I used to believe,\" he began clearly, \"in the Vigilantes. If I had been here when the first Committee was formed, I'd have worked for it myself. I believe it cleared the town of some of the worst scoundrels in the country, and that's saying a good deal. But--\"  \"The Committee,\" interrupted the Captain, \"would like to hear your story of the shooting. Your private opinions can wait until the investigation of that affair is ended.\"  \"You're right. I beg your pardon for forgetting that it is not settled yet!\" Jack's voice was politely scornful. \"Well, then, this kid told the truth in every particular, even when he declared that Dick Swift is a dirty liar. Swift is a liar. He's also a thief, and he's also a murderer--and a few other things not as decent!  \"As to the row, I was walking out that way, when I saw this kid coming up from the bay toward the town. The three, Swift, Rawhide Jack, and Texas Bill, met him where the--er--trouble took place. I was too far off to hear what was said; in fact, I didn't pay any attention much, till I saw the kid struggling to get away. I walked towards them then. It was easy enough to see that it was a hold-up, pure and simple. I was about fifty yards from them when I saw Swift, here, raise a knife to jab it into the boy's throat. Texas and Rawhide were both holding the kid's arms and bending him backwards so he couldn't do anything. When I saw the knife, I began to shoot.\" His eyes sought those of Bill Wilson, standing in the crowd near the door. \"That's the truth of the whole matter,\" he said, speaking directly to Bill. \"I didn't try to make trouble; but I couldn't stand by and see a man murdered, no more than any decent man could.\" He paused; and still looking toward Bill, added: \"I didn't even notice particularly who the men were, until I went up to the boy. It all happened so sudden that I--\"  The Captain cleared his throat. \"You admit, then, that you killed Rawhide Jack and Texas Bill this morning?\"  \"I surely do,\" retorted Jack. \"And if you want to know, I'm kinda proud of it; it was a long shot--to clean the town of two such blackguards. And right here I want to apologize to the town for making a bungle of killing Swift!\"  \"We have two witnesses who also swear that you killed Tex' and Rawhide, though they give a very different version of the trouble with the boy. Would you ask us to believe that Texas Bill lied with his last breath?\"  \"If he told the story you say he did, he certainly lied most sinfully with his last breath; but I'd hate to take your word for anything, so I don't know whether he lied or not.\"  \"Mr. Swift, here, tells the same story that Texas Bill told.\" The Captain chose to ignore the insults. \"I think their testimony should carry more weight with the Committee than yours, or the boy's. You are trying to save your neck; and the boy probably feels that he owes you some gratitude for taking his part. But the Committee's business is to weed out the dangerous element which is altogether too large in this town; and the Committee feels that you are one of the most dangerous. However, we will call another witness. Shorty, you may come forward.\"  Shorty came scowling up and sat down upon the box Swift had occupied. He took the oath and afterwards declared that he had overheard Jack coaching the boy about what he should tell the Committee. The Captain, having brought out that point, promptly excused him.  \"Gentlemen of the jury, you have heard the evidence, and your duty is plain. We are waiting for the verdict.\"  The man with the cud looked a question at the Captain; turned and glanced down the row at the eleven, who nodded their heads in unanimous approval of his thoughts. He once more shifted the wad of tobacco, as a preliminary to expectorating gravely into the sand floor, and pronounced his sentence with a promptness that savored of relish:  \"The verdict of the jury is that we hang Jack Allen for killin' Texas and Rawhide, and for bein' a mean, ornery cuss, anyway.\"  The Captain turned coldly to the prisoner. \"You hear the verdict. The Committee believes it to be just.\"  He looked at the group near the door. \"Mr. Wilson,\" he called maliciously, \"you will now be given an opportunity to collect from the prisoner what he owes you.\"  \"Jack Allen don't owe me a cent!\" cried Bill Wilson hotly, shouldering his way to the open space before the Captain. \"But there's a heavy debt hanging over this damned Committee--a debt they'll have to pay themselves one day at the end of a rope, if there's as many honest men in this town as I think there is.  \"I helped form the first Vigilance Committee, boys. We did it to protect the town from just such men as are running the Committee right now. When crimes like this can be done right before our eyes, in broad daylight, I say it's time another Committee was formed, to hang this one! Here they've got a man that they know, and we all know, ain't done a thing but what any brave, honest man would do. They've gone through a farce trial that'd make the Digger Injuns ashamed of themselves; and they've condemned Jack Allen, that's got more real manhood in his little finger than there is in the dirty, lying carcasses of the whole damned outfit--they've condemned him to be hung!  \"And why! I can tell yuh why--and it ain't for killing Texas and Rawhide--two as measly, ornery cusses as there was in town--it ain't for that. It's for daring to say, last night in my place, that the Committee is rotten to the core, and that they murdered Sandy McTavish in cold blood when they took him out and hung him for killing that greaser in self-defense. It's for speaking his mind, the mind of an honest man, that they're going to hang him. That is, they'll hang him if you'll stand by and let 'em do it. I believe both these boys told a straight story. I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12139"],["title","The Gringos (#6)"],["body","them three was trying to pull off a daylight robbery, and Jack shot to save the kid.  \"Now, men, see here! I for one have stood about all I'm going to stand from this bunch of cutthroats that've taken the place of the Committee we organized to protect the town. To-night I want every man that calls himself honest to come to my place and hold a mass meeting, to elect a Committee like we had in the first place. I want every man--\"  \"Bill, you're crazy!\" It was Jack, white to the lips in sheer terror for Wilson, Jack who refused to blench at his own dire strait, who sprang up and clapped a hand over the mouth that was sealing the doom of the owner. \"Take him out, Jim, for God's sake! Take him--Bill, listen to me, you fool! What was it you were telling me, there in your own doorway, to-day? About not thinking out loud? You can't save me by talking like that! These men--those that don't hate me--are so scared of their own necks that they wouldn't lift a finger to save a twin brother. Take him out, boys! Bill doesn't mean any harm.\" He tried to smile and failed utterly. \"He likes me, and he's--he's--\"  Shorty it was who jerked him away from Bill. The Captain, on his feet, was dominating the uneasy crowd with his cold stare more than with the gun he held in his hand.  \"This Committee,\" he stated in his calm, judicial tone, which chilled the growing fire of excitement and held the men silent that they might listen, \"this Committee regrets that in the course of its unpleasant duties it must now and then rouse the antagonism of a bad man's friends. But this Committee must perform the duties for which it was elected. This Committee is sorry to see Mr. Wilson take the stand he takes, but it realizes that friendship for the condemned man leads him to make statements and threats for which he should not be held responsible. Gentlemen, this court of inquiry is dismissed, and it may not be amiss to point out the necessity for order being maintained among you. The Committee would deeply regret any trouble arising at this time.\"  \"Oh, damn you and your Committee!\" gritted Bill Wilson, out of the bitterness that filled him. He gave Jack one glance; one, and with his jaws set hard together, turned his back.  The crowd pushed and parted to make way for him. Jim, his face the color of a pork rind, followed dog-like at the heels of his boss. And when they had passed, the tent began to belch forth men who walked with heads and shoulders a little bent, talking together under their breaths of this man who dared defy the Committee to its face, and whose daring was as impotent as the breeze that still pulled at the flapping corner of the cloth sign over the door of his place.  Bill glanced dully up at the sign before he opened his door. \"Better get the hammer and nail that corner down, Jim,\" he said morosely, and went in. He poured a whisky glass two-thirds full of liquor and emptied it with one long swallow--and Bill was not a drinking man.  \"God! This thing they call justice!\" he groaned, as he set down the glass; and went out to make an attempt at organizing a rescue party, though he had little hope of succeeding. Jack was a stranger to the better class of business men, and those who did know him were either friends of the Committee or in deadly fear of it. Still, Bill was a gambler. He was probably putting the mark of the next victim on himself; but he did not stop for that.     CHAPTER IV  WHAT HAPPENED AT THE OAK   Jack sat looking after the crowd that shuffled through the doorway into the sunlight. He thought he had believed that he would receive the sentence which the juryman had spoken so baldly; yet, after the words had been actually spoken, he stared blankly after Bill and the others, and incredulously at the Captain, who seated himself upon a bunk opposite to watch his prisoner, his pistol resting suggestively upon his knee. The boy lingered to shake Jack's unresponsive hand and mutter a broken sentence or two of gratitude and sympathy. But Jack scarcely grasped his meaning, and his answer sounded chillingly calm; so that the boy, wincing under the cold stare of the Captain and the seeming indifference of the prisoner, turned away with downy chin a-tremble and in his eyes the look of horrified awe which sometimes comes to a youth who has seen death hesitate just over his head, pass him by, and choose another. In the doorway he stopped and looked back bewildered. Jack had said that he loved life and would hate to leave it; and yet he sat there calmly, scraping idly with his boot-toe a little furrow in the loose sand, his elbows resting on his knees, his face unlined by frown or bitterness, his eyes bent abstractedly upon the shallow trench he was desultorily digging. He did not look as the boy believed a man should look who has just been condemned to die the ignominious death of hanging. The boy shuddered and went out into the sunlight, dazed with this glimpse he had got of the inexorable hardness of life.  Jack did not even know when the boy left. He, also, was looking upon the hardness of life, but he was looking with the eyes of the fighter. So long as Jack Allen had breath in his body, he would fight to keep it there. His incredulity against the verdict swung to a tenacious disbelief that it would really come to the worst. So long as he was alive, so long as he could feel the weight of the dagger in his sleeve, it was temperamentally impossible for him to believe that he was going to die that day.  Plans he made and smoothed them in the dirt with his toe. If they did not bind his arms... They had not tied Sandy's arms, he remembered; and he wondered if a dagger concealed in Sandy's sleeve would have made any essential difference in the result of that particular crime of the Committee. He sickened at a vivid memory of how Sandy had ridden away, just a week or so before; and of the appealing glance which he had sent toward Bill's place when Shorty started to lead the buckskin from before the prison tent with six men walking upon either side and a curious crowd straggling after. Would a dagger in Sandy's sleeve have made any difference?  Then his thoughts swung to the Mexican who had told him of the trick, only the night before. It had amused Jack to experiment with his own knife; and the very novelty of the thing had impelled him to slip his dagger into the new hiding-place that morning when he dressed. The Captain had not discovered it there--but would it make any difference? It occurred to him that he need not die the death of dangling and strangling at the end of the rope, at any rate; if it came to dying... Jack became acutely conscious of the steady beat in his chest, and immediately afterward felt the same throb in his throat; he could stop that beating whenever he chose, if they did not bind his arms.  \"Horse's ready, Captain,\" announced Shorty succinctly, thrusting his head through the closed flaps; and the Captain rose instantly and made a commanding gesture to his prisoner.  Jack swept the loose dirt back into the furrow with one swing of his foot and stood up. He went out quietly, two steps in advance of the Captain and the Captain's drawn pistol, and advanced unflinchingly towards the horse that stood saddled in the midst of the group of executioners, with the same curious crowd looking on greedily at the spectacle.  \"Ever been on a horse?\" asked the Captain, his deep voice little more than a growl.  \"Once or twice,\" Jack answered indifferently.  \"Climb on, then!\"  Jack was young and he was very human. It might be his last hour on earth, but there rose up in him a prideful desire to show them whether he had ever been on a horse; he caught the saddle-horn with one hand and vaulted vaingloriously into the saddle without touching a toe to the stirrup. The buckskin ducked and danced sidewise at the end of the rope in Shorty's hand, and more than one gun flashed into sight at the unexpectedness of the move.  The Captain scowled at the exclamations of admiration from the crowd. \"You needn't try any funny work, young man, or I'll tie you hand as well as foot!\" he threatened sternly. \"Give me that rope, Davis.\"  Then Jack paid in pain for his vanity, and paid in full. The Captain did not bind his arms--perhaps because of the crowd and a desire to seem merciful. But though he merely tied the prisoner's ankle after the usual manner, he knotted the small rope with a vicious yank, pulled it as tight as he could and passed the rope under the flinching belly of the buckskin to Davis, on the other side. Also he sent a glance of meaning which the other read unerringly and obeyed most willingly. Davis drew the rope taut under the cinch and tied Jack's other ankle as if he were putting the diamond hitch on a pack mule. The two stepped back and eyed him sharply for some sign of pain, when all was done.  \"Thanks,\" drawled Jack. \"Sorry I can't do as much for you.\" Whereupon he set his teeth against the growing agony of strained muscles and congesting arteries, and began to roll a cigarette with fingers which he held rigidly from trembling.  Bill Wilson, returning gloomily to the doorway of his place, grated an oath and turned away his head.  Some day, he promised himself vengefully, those two--yes, and the whole group of murderers moving briskly away from the tent--would pay for that outrage; and he prayed that the day might come soon.  He went heavily into the big room where men were already foregathering to gossip between drinks of the trial and of the man who was to die. Bill bethought him of the young stranger; made some inquiries of certain inoffensive individuals among the crowd, and sent Jim out with instructions to find the kid and bring him back with him.  Bill was standing in the door waiting for Jim to return, when, in a swirl of dust, came Dade galloping around a corner and to the very doorstep before he showed any desire to slow up. At the first tightening of the reins, the white horse stiffened his front legs, dug"]]]
