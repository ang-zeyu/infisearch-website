At this point I profited by a lesson which had been dinned into my ears a good many times since boyhood. Andrew Dunlop, Maisie's father, was one of those men who are uncommonly fond of lecturing young folk in season and out of season. He would get a lot of us, boys and girls, together in his parlour at such times as he was not behind the counter and give us admonitions on what he called the practical things of life. And one of his favourite precepts--especially addressed to us boys--was \"Cultivate your powers of observation.\" This advice fitted in very well with the affairs of the career I had mapped out for myself--a solicitor should naturally be an observant man, and I had made steady effort to do as Andrew Dunlop counselled. Therefore it was with a keenly observant eye that I, all unseen, watched the man with his electric torch and his map, and it did not escape my notice that the hand which held the map was short of the two middle fingers. But of the rest of him, except that he was a tallish, well-made man, dressed in--as far as I could see things--a gentlemanlike fashion in grey tweeds, I could see nothing. I never caught one glimpse of his face, for all the time that he stood there it was in shadow.  He did not stay there long either. The light of the electric torch was suddenly switched off; I heard the crackling of the map again as he folded it up and pocketed it. And just as suddenly he was once more on the move, taking the by-way up to the north, which, as I knew well, led to Norham, and--if he was going far--over the Tweed to Ladykirk. He went away at the same quick pace; but the surface in that by-way was not as hard and ringing as that of the main road, and before long the sound of his steps died away into silence, and the hot, oppressive night became as still as ever.  I presently mounted my bicycle again and rode forward on my last stage, and having crossed Twizel Bridge, turned down the lane to the old ruin close by where Till runs into Tweed. It was now as dark as ever it would be that night, and the thunderclouds which hung all over the valley deepened the gloom. Gloomy and dark the spot indeed was where I was to meet the man of whom Mr. Gilverthwaite had spoken. By the light of my bicycle lamp I saw that it was just turned eleven when I reached the spot; but so far as I could judge there was no man there to meet anybody. And remembering what I had been bidden to do, I spoke out loud.  \"From James Gilverthwaite, who is sick, and can't come himself,\" I repeated. And then, getting no immediate response, I spoke the password in just as loud a voice. But there was no response to that either, and for the instant I thought how ridiculous it was to stand there and say Panama to nobody.  I made it out that the man had not yet come, and I was wheeling my bicycle to the side of the lane, there to place it against the hedge and to sit down myself, when the glancing light of the lamp fell on a great red stain that had spread itself, and was still spreading, over the sandy ground in front of me. And I knew on the instant that this was the stain of blood, and I do not think I was surprised when, advancing a step or two further, I saw, lying in the roadside grass at my feet, the still figure and white face of a man who, I knew with a sure and certain instinct, was not only dead but had been cruelly murdered.     CHAPTER IV  THE MURDERED MAN   There may be folk in the world to whom the finding of a dead man, lying grim and stark by the roadside, with the blood freshly run from it and making ugly patches of crimson on the grass and the gravel, would be an ordinary thing; but to me that had never seen blood let in violence, except in such matters as a bout of fisticuffs at school, it was the biggest thing that had ever happened, and I stood staring down at the white face as if I should never look at anything else as long as I lived. I remember all about that scene and that moment as freshly now as if the affair had happened last night. The dead man lying in the crushed grass--his arms thrown out helplessly on either side of him--the gloom of the trees all around--the murmuring of the waters, where Till was pouring its sluggish flood into the more active swirl and rush of the Tweed--the hot, oppressive air of the night--and the blood on the dry road--all that was what, at Mr. Gilverthwaite's bidding, I had ridden out from Berwick to find in that lonely spot.  But I knew, of course, that James Gilverthwaite himself had not foreseen this affair, nor thought that I should find a murdered man. And as I at last drew breath, and lifted myself up a little from staring at the corpse, a great many thoughts rushed into my head, and began to tumble about over each other. Was this the man Mr. Gilverthwaite meant me to meet? Would Mr. Gilverthwaite have been murdered, too, if he had come there in person? And had the man been murdered for the sake of robbery? But I answered that last question as soon as I asked it, and in the negative, for the light of my lamp showed a fine, heavy gold watch-chain festooned across the man's waistcoat--if murderously inclined thieves had been at him, they were not like to have left that. Then I wondered if I had disturbed the murderers--it was fixed in me from the beginning that there must have been more than one in at this dreadful game--and if they were still lurking about and watching me from the brushwood; and I made an effort, and bent down and touched one of the nerveless hands. It was stiffened already, and I knew then that the man had been dead some time.  And I knew another thing in that moment: poor Maisie, lying awake to listen for the tap at her window, so that she might get up and peep round the corner of her blind to assure herself that her Hughie was alive and safe, would have to lie quaking and speculating through the dark hours of that night, for here was work that was going to keep me busied till day broke. I set to it there and then, leaving the man just as I had found him, and hastening back in the direction of the main road. As luck would have it, I heard voices of men on Twizel Bridge, and ran right on the local police-sergeant and a constable, who had met there in the course of their night rounds. I knew them both, the sergeant being one Chisholm, and the constable a man named Turndale, and they knew me well enough from having seen me in the court at Berwick; and it was with open-mouthed surprise that they listened to what I had to tell them. Presently we were all three round the dead man, and this time there was the light of three lamps on his face and on the gouts of blood that were all about him, and Chisholm clicked his tongue sharply at what he saw.  \"Here's a sore sight for honest folk!\" he said in a low voice, as he bent down and touched one of the hands. \"Aye, and he's been dead a good hour, I should say, by the feel of him! You heard nothing as you came down yon lane, Mr. Hugh?\"  \"Not a sound!\" I answered.  \"And saw nothing?\" he questioned.  \"Nothing and nobody!\" I said.  \"Well,\" said he, \"we'll have to get him away from this. You'll have to get help,\" he went on, turning to the constable. \"Fetch some men to help us carry him. He'll have to be taken to the nearest inn for the inquest--that's how the law is. I wasn't going to ask it while yon man was about, Mr. Hugh,\" he continued, when Turndale had gone hurrying towards the village; \"but you'll not mind me asking it now--what were you doing here yourself, at this hour?\"  \"You've a good right, Chisholm,\" said I; \"and I'll tell you, for by all I can see, there'll be no way of keeping it back, and it's no concern of mine to keep it back, and I don't care who knows all about it--not me! The truth is, we've a lodger at our house, one Mr. James Gilverthwaite, that's a mysterious sort of man, and he's at present in his bed with a chill or something that's like to keep him there; and tonight he got me to ride out here to meet a man whom he ought to have met himself--and that's why I'm here and all that I have to do with it.\"  \"You don't mean to say that--that!\" he exclaimed, jerking his thumb at the dead man; \"that--that's the man you were to meet?\"  \"Who else?\" said I. \"Can you think of any other that it would be? And I'm wondering if whoever killed this fellow, whoever he may be, wouldn't have killed Mr. Gilverthwaite, too, if he'd come? This is no by-chance murder, Chisholm, as you'll be finding out.\"  \"Well, well, I never knew its like!\" he remarked, staring from me to the body, and from it to me. \"You saw nobody about close by--nor in the neighbourhood--no strangers on the road?\"  I was ready for that question. Ever since finding the body, I had been wondering what I should say when authority, either in the shape of a coroner or a policeman, asked me about my own adventures that night. To be sure, I had seen a stranger, and I had observed that he had lost a couple of fingers, the first and second, of his right hand; and it was certainly a queer thing that he should be in that immediate neighbourhood about the time when this unfortunate man met his death. But it had been borne in on my mind pretty strongly that the man I had seen looking at his map was some gentleman-tourist who was walking the district, and had as like as not been tramping it over Plodden Field and that historic corner of the country, and had become benighted ere he could reach wherever his headquarters were. And I was not going to bring suspicion on what was in all probability an innocent stranger, so I answered Chisholm's question as I meant to answer any similar one--unless, indeed, I had reason to alter my mind.  \"I saw"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12239"],["title","Dead Men's Money (#4)"],["body","and heard nothing--about here,\" said I. \"It's not likely there'd be strangers in this spot at midnight.\"  \"For that matter, the poor fellow is a stranger himself,\" said he, once more turning his lamp on the dead face. \"Anyway, he's not known to me, and I've been in these parts twenty years. And altogether it's a fine mystery you've hit on, Mr. Hugh, and there'll be strange doings before we're at the bottom of it, I'm thinking.\"  That there was mystery in this affair was surer than ever when, having got the man to the nearest inn, and brought more help, including a doctor, they began to examine him and his clothing. And now that I saw him in a stronger light, I found that he was a strongly built, well-made man of about Mr. Gilverthwaite's age--say, just over sixty years or so,--dressed in a gentlemanlike fashion, and wearing good boots and linen and a tweed suit of the sort affected by tourists. There was a good deal of money in his pockets--bank-notes, gold, and silver--and an expensive watch and chain, and other such things that a gentleman would carry; and it seemed very evident that robbery had not been the motive of the murderers. But of papers that could identify the man there was nothing--in the shape of paper or its like there was not one scrap in all the clothing, except the return half of a railway ticket between Peebles and Coldstream, and a bit of a torn bill-head giving the name and address of a tradesman in Dundee.  \"There's something to go on, anyway,\" remarked Chisholm, as he carefully put these things aside after pointing out to us that the ticket was dated on what was now the previous day (for it was already well past midnight, and the time was creeping on to morning), and that the dead man must accordingly have come to Coldstream not many hours before his death; \"and we'll likely find something about him from either Dundee or Peebles. But I'm inclined to think, Mr. Hugh,\" he continued, drawing me aside, \"that even though they didn't rob the man of his money and valuables, they took something else from him that may have been of much more value than either.\"  \"What?\" I asked.  \"Papers!\" said he. \"Look at the general appearance of the man! He's no common or ordinary sort. Is it likely, now, such a man would be without letters and that sort of thing in his pockets? Like as not he'd carry his pocket-book, and it may have been this pocket-book with what was in it they were after, and not troubling about his purse at all.\"  \"They made sure of him, anyway,\" said I, and went out of the room where they had laid the body, not caring to stay longer. For I had heard what the doctor said--that the man had been killed on the spot by a single blow from a knife or dagger which had been thrust into his heart from behind with tremendous force, and the thought of it was sickening me. \"What are you going to do now?\" I asked of Chisholm, who had followed me. \"And do you want me any more, sergeant?--for, if not, I'm anxious to get back to Berwick.\"  \"That's just where I'm coming with you,\" he answered. \"I've my bicycle close by, and we'll ride into the town together at once. For, do you see, Mr. Hugh, there's just one man hereabouts that can give us some light on this affair straightaway--if he will--and that the lodger you were telling me of. And I must get in and see the superintendent, and we must get speech with this Mr. Gilverthwaite of yours--for, if he knows no more, he'll know who yon man is!\"  I made no answer to that. I had no certain answer to make. I was already wondering about a lot of conjectures. Would Mr. Gilverthwaite know who the man was? Was he the man I ought to have met? Or had that man been there, witnessed the murder, and gone away, frightened to stop where the murder had been done? Or--yet again--was this some man who had come upon Mr. Gilverthwaite's correspondent, and, for some reason, been murdered by him? It was, however, all beyond me just then, and presently the sergeant and I were on our machines and making for Berwick. But we had not been set out half an hour, and were only just where we could see the town's lights before us in the night, when two folk came riding bicycles through the mist that lay thick in a dip of the road, and, calling to me, let me know that they were Maisie Dunlop and her brother Tom that she had made to come with her, and in another minute Maisie and I were whispering together.  \"It's all right now that I know you're safe, Hugh,\" she said breathlessly. \"But you must get back with me quickly. Yon lodger of yours is dead, and your mother in a fine way, wondering where you are!\"     CHAPTER V  THE BRASS-BOUND CHEST   The police-sergeant had got off his bicycle at the same time that I jumped from mine, and he was close behind me when Maisie and I met, and I heard him give a sharp whistle at her news. And as for me, I was dumbfounded, for though I had seen well enough that Mr. Gilverthwaite was very ill when I left him, I was certainly a long way from thinking him like to die. Indeed, I was so astonished that all I could do was to stand staring at Maisie in the grey light which was just coming between the midnight and the morning. But the sergeant found his tongue more readily.  \"I suppose he died in his bed, miss?\" he asked softly. \"Mr. Hugh here said he was ill; it would be a turn for the worse, no doubt, after Mr. Hugh left him?\"  \"He died suddenly just after eleven o'clock,\" answered Maisie; \"and your mother sought you at Mr. Lindsey's office, Hugh, and when she found you weren't there, she came down to our house, and I had to tell her that you'd come out this way on an errand for Mr. Gilverthwaite. And I told her, too, what I wasn't so sure of myself, that there'd no harm come to you of it, and that you'd be back soon after twelve, and I went down to your house and waited with her; and when you didn't come, and didn't come, why, I got Tom here to get our bicycles out and we came to seek you. And let's be getting back, for your mother's anxious about you, and the man's death has upset her--he went all at once, she said, while she was with him.\"  We all got on our bicycles again and set off homewards, and Chisholm wheeled alongside me and we dropped behind a little.  \"This is a strange affair,\" said he, in a low voice; \"and it's like to be made stranger by this man's sudden death. I'd been looking to him to get news of this other man. What do you know of Mr. Gilverthwaite, now?\"  \"Nothing!\" said I.  \"But he's lodged with you seven weeks?\" said he.  \"If you'd known him, sergeant,\" I answered, \"you'd know that he was this sort of man--you'd know no more of him at the end of seven months than you would at the end of seven weeks, and no more at the end of seven years than at the end of seven months. We knew nothing, my mother and I, except that he was a decent, well-spoken man, free with his money and having plenty of it, and that his name was what he called it, and that he said he'd been a master mariner. But who he was, or where he came from, I know no more than you do.\"  \"Well, he'll have papers, letters, something or other that'll throw some light on matters, no doubt?\" he suggested. \"Can you say as to that?\"  \"I can tell you that he's got a chest in his chamber that's nigh as heavy as if it were made of solid lead,\" I answered. \"And doubtless he'll have a key on him or about him that'll unlock it. But what might be in it, I can't say, never having seen him open it at any time.\"  \"Well,\" he said, \"I'll have to bring the superintendent down, and we must trouble your mother to let us take a look at this Mr. Gilverthwaite's effects. Had he a doctor to him since he was taken ill?\"  \"Dr. Watson--this--I mean yesterday--afternoon,\" I answered.  \"Then there'll be no inquest in his case,\" said the sergeant, \"for the doctor'll be able to certify. But there'll be a searching inquiry in this murder affair, and as Gilverthwaite sent you to meet the man that's been murdered--\"  \"Wait a bit!\" said I. \"You don't know, and I don't, that the man who's been murdered is the man I was sent to meet. The man I was to meet may have been the murderer; you don't know who the murdered man is. So you'd better put it this way: since Gilverthwaite sent me to meet some man at the place where this murder's been committed--well?\"  \"That'll be one of your lawyer's quibbles,\" said he calmly. \"My meaning's plain enough--we'll want to find out, if we can, who it was that Gilverthwaite sent you to meet. And--for what reason? And--where it was that the man was to wait for him? And I'll get the superintendent to come down presently.\"  \"Make it in, say, half an hour,\" said I. \"This is a queer business altogether, sergeant, and I'm so much in it that I'm not going to do things on my own responsibility. I'll call Mr. Lindsey up from his bed, and get him to come down to talk over what's to be done.\"  \"Aye, you're in the right of it there,\" he said. \"Mr. Lindsey'll know all the law on such matters. Half an hour or so, then.\"  He made off to the county police-station, and Maisie and Tom and I went on to our house, and were presently inside. My mother was so relieved at the sight of me that she forbore to scold me at that time for going off on such an errand without telling her of my business; but she grew white as her cap when I told her of what I had chanced on, and she glanced at the stair and shook her head.  \"And indeed I wish that poor man had never come here, if it's this sort of dreadfulness follows him!\" she said. \"And though I was slow to say it, Hugh, I always had a feeling of mystery about him. However, he's gone now--and died that suddenly and quietly!--and we've laid him out in his bed; and--and--what's to be done now?\" she exclaimed. \"We don't know who he is!\"  \"Don't trouble yourself, mother,\" said I. \"You've done your duty by him. And now that you've seen I'm safe, I'm away to bring Mr. Lindsey down and he'll tell us all that should be done.\"  I left Maisie and Tom Dunlop keeping my"]]]
