XIV.  The thought beneath so slight a film Is more distinctly seen, -- As laces just reveal the surge, Or mists the Apennine.      XV.  The soul unto itself Is an imperial friend, -- Or the most agonizing spy An enemy could send.  Secure against its own, No treason it can fear; Itself its sovereign, of itself The soul should stand in awe.      XVI.  Surgeons must be very careful When they take the knife! Underneath their fine incisions Stirs the culprit, -- Life!      XVII.  THE RAILWAY TRAIN.  I like to see it lap the miles, And lick the valleys up, And stop to feed itself at tanks; And then, prodigious, step  Around a pile of mountains, And, supercilious, peer In shanties by the sides of roads; And then a quarry pare  To fit its sides, and crawl between, Complaining all the while In horrid, hooting stanza; Then chase itself down hill  And neigh like Boanerges; Then, punctual as a star, Stop -- docile and omnipotent -- At its own stable door.      XVIII.  THE SHOW.  The show is not the show, But they that go. Menagerie to me My neighbor be. Fair play -- Both went to see.      XIX.  Delight becomes pictorial When viewed through pain, -- More fair, because impossible That any gain.  The mountain at a given distance In amber lies; Approached, the amber flits a little, -- And that 's the skies!      XX.  A thought went up my mind to-day That I have had before, But did not finish, -- some way back, I could not fix the year,  Nor where it went, nor why it came The second time to me, Nor definitely what it was, Have I the art to say.  But somewhere in my soul, I know I 've met the thing before; It just reminded me -- 't was all -- And came my way no more.      XXI.  Is Heaven a physician? They say that He can heal, But medicine posthumous    Is unavailable.  Is Heaven an exchequer?    They speak of what we owe; But that negotiation    I 'm not a party to.      XXII.  THE RETURN.  Though I get home how late, how late! So I get home, 't will compensate. Better will be the ecstasy That they have done expecting me, When, night descending, dumb and dark, They hear my unexpected knock. Transporting must the moment be, Brewed from decades of agony!  To think just how the fire will burn, Just how long-cheated eyes will turn To wonder what myself will say, And what itself will say to me, Beguiles the centuries of way!      XXIII.  A poor torn heart, a tattered heart, That sat it down to rest, Nor noticed that the ebbing day Flowed silver to the west, Nor noticed night did soft descend Nor constellation burn, Intent upon the vision Of latitudes unknown.  The angels, happening that way, This dusty heart espied; Tenderly took it up from toil And carried it to God. There, -- sandals for the barefoot; There, -- gathered from the gales, Do the blue havens by the hand Lead the wandering sails.      XXIV.  TOO MUCH.  I should have been too glad, I see, Too lifted for the scant degree    Of life's penurious round; My little circuit would have shamed This new circumference, have blamed    The homelier time behind.  I should have been too saved, I see, Too rescued; fear too dim to me    That I could spell the prayer I knew so perfect yesterday, -- That scalding one, \"Sabachthani,\"    Recited fluent here.  Earth would have been too much, I see, And heaven not enough for me;    I should have had the joy Without the fear to justify, -- The palm without the Calvary;    So, Saviour, crucify.  Defeat whets victory, they say; The reefs in old Gethsemane    Endear the shore beyond. 'T is beggars banquets best define; 'T is thirsting vitalizes wine, --    Faith faints to understand.      XXV.  SHIPWRECK.  It tossed and tossed, -- A little brig I knew, -- O'ertook by blast, It spun and spun, And groped delirious, for morn.  It slipped and slipped, As one that drunken stepped; Its white foot tripped, Then dropped from sight.  Ah, brig, good-night To crew and you; The ocean's heart too smooth, too blue, To break for you.      XXVI.  Victory comes late, And is held low to freezing lips Too rapt with frost To take it. How sweet it would have tasted, Just a drop! Was God so economical? His table 's spread too high for us Unless we dine on tip-toe. Crumbs fit such little mouths, Cherries suit robins; The eagle's golden breakfast Strangles them. God keeps his oath to sparrows, Who of little love Know how to starve!      XXVII.  ENOUGH.  God gave a loaf to every bird, But just a crumb to me; I dare not eat it, though I starve, -- My poignant luxury To own it, touch it, prove the feat That made the pellet mine, -- Too happy in my sparrow chance For ampler coveting.  It might be famine all around, I could not miss an ear, Such plenty smiles upon my board, My garner shows so fair. I wonder how the rich may feel, -- An Indiaman -- an Earl? I deem that I with but a crumb Am sovereign of them all.      XXVIII.  Experiment to me Is every one I meet. If it contain a kernel? The figure of a nut  Presents upon a tree, Equally plausibly; But meat within is requisite, To squirrels and to me.      XXIX.  MY COUNTRY'S WARDROBE.  My country need not change her gown, Her triple suit as sweet As when 't was cut at Lexington, And first pronounced \"a fit.\"  Great Britain disapproves \"the stars;\" Disparagement discreet, -- There 's something in their attitude That taunts her bayonet.      XXX.  Faith is a fine invention For gentlemen who see; But microscopes are prudent In an emergency!      XXXI.  Except the heaven had come so near, So seemed to choose my door, The distance would not haunt me so; I had not hoped before.  But just to hear the grace depart I never thought to see, Afflicts me with a double loss; 'T is lost, and lost to me.      XXXII.  Portraits are to daily faces As an evening west To a fine, pedantic sunshine In a satin vest.      XXXIII.  THE DUEL.  I took my power in my hand. And went against the world; 'T was not so much as David had, But I was twice as bold.  I aimed my pebble, but myself Was all the one that fell. Was it Goliath was too large, Or only I too small?      XXXIV.  A shady friend for torrid days Is easier to find Than one of higher temperature For frigid hour of mind.  The vane a little to the east Scares muslin souls away; If broadcloth breasts are firmer Than those of organdy,  Who is to blame? The weaver? Ah! the bewildering thread! The tapestries of paradise So notelessly are made!      XXXV.  THE GOAL.  Each life converges to some centre Expressed or still; Exists in every human nature A goal,  Admitted scarcely to itself, it may be, Too fair For credibility's temerity To dare.  Adored with caution, as a brittle heaven, To reach Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment To touch,  Yet persevered toward, surer for the distance; How high Unto the saints' slow diligence The sky!  Ungained, it may be, by a life's low venture, But then, Eternity enables the endeavoring Again.      XXXVI.  SIGHT.  Before I got my eye put out, I liked as well to see As other creatures that have eyes, And know no other way.  But were it told to me, to-day, That I might have the sky For mine, I tell you that my heart Would split, for size of me.  The meadows mine, the mountains mine, -- All forests, stintless stars, As much of noon as I could take Between my finite eyes.  The motions of the dipping birds, The lightning's jointed road, For mine to look at when I liked, -- The news would strike me dead!  So safer, guess, with just my soul Upon the window-pane Where other creatures put their eyes, Incautious of the sun.      XXXVII.  Talk with prudence to a beggar Of 'Potosi' and the mines! Reverently to the hungry Of your viands and your wines!  Cautious, hint to any captive You have passed enfranchised feet! Anecdotes of air in dungeons Have sometimes proved deadly sweet!      XXXVIII.  THE PREACHER.  He preached upon \"breadth\" till it argued him narrow, -- The broad are too broad to define; And of \"truth\" until it proclaimed him a liar, -- The truth never flaunted a sign.  Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence As gold the pyrites would shun. What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus To meet so enabled a man!      XXXIX.  Good night! which put the candle out? A jealous zephyr, not a doubt.    Ah! friend, you little knew How long at that celestial wick The angels labored diligent;    Extinguished, now, for you!  It might have been the lighthouse spark Some sailor, rowing in the dark,    Had importuned to see! It might have been the waning lamp That lit the drummer from the camp    To purer reveille!      XL.  When I hoped I feared, Since I hoped I dared; Everywhere alone As a church remain; Spectre cannot harm, Serpent cannot charm; He deposes doom, Who hath suffered him.      XLI.  DEED.  A deed knocks first at thought, And then it knocks at will. That is the manufacturing spot, And will at home and well.  It then goes out an act, Or is entombed so still That only to the ear of God Its doom is audible.      XLII.  TIME'S LESSON.  Mine enemy is growing old, -- I have at last revenge. The palate of the hate departs; If any would avenge, --  Let him be quick, the viand flits, It is a faded meat. Anger as soon as fed is dead; 'T is starving makes it fat.      XLIII.  REMORSE.  Remorse is memory awake, Her companies astir, -- A presence of departed acts At window and at door.  It's past set down before the soul, And lighted with a match, Perusal to facilitate Of its condensed despatch.  Remorse is cureless, -- the disease Not even God can heal; For 't is his institution, -- The complement of hell.      XLIV.  THE SHELTER.  The body grows outside, -- The more convenient way, -- That if the spirit like to hide, Its temple stands alway  Ajar,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],["title","Poems (#7)"],["body"," secure, inviting; It never did betray The soul that asked its shelter In timid honesty.      XLV.  Undue significance a starving man attaches To food Far off; he sighs, and therefore hopeless, And therefore good.  Partaken, it relieves indeed, but proves us That spices fly In the receipt. It was the distance Was savory.      XLVI.  Heart not so heavy as mine, Wending late home, As it passed my window Whistled itself a tune, --  A careless snatch, a ballad, A ditty of the street; Yet to my irritated ear An anodyne so sweet,  It was as if a bobolink, Sauntering this way, Carolled and mused and carolled, Then bubbled slow away.  It was as if a chirping brook Upon a toilsome way Set bleeding feet to minuets Without the knowing why.  To-morrow, night will come again, Weary, perhaps, and sore. Ah, bugle, by my window, I pray you stroll once more!      XLVII.  I many times thought peace had come, When peace was far away; As wrecked men deem they sight the land At centre of the sea,  And struggle slacker, but to prove, As hopelessly as I, How many the fictitious shores Before the harbor lie.      XLVIII.  Unto my books so good to turn Far ends of tired days; It half endears the abstinence, And pain is missed in praise.  As flavors cheer retarded guests With banquetings to be, So spices stimulate the time Till my small library.  It may be wilderness without, Far feet of failing men, But holiday excludes the night, And it is bells within.  I thank these kinsmen of the shelf; Their countenances bland Enamour in prospective, And satisfy, obtained.      XLIX.  This merit hath the worst, -- It cannot be again. When Fate hath taunted last And thrown her furthest stone,  The maimed may pause and breathe, And glance securely round. The deer invites no longer Than it eludes the hound.      L.  HUNGER.  I had been hungry all the years; My noon had come, to dine; I, trembling, drew the table near, And touched the curious wine.  'T was this on tables I had seen, When turning, hungry, lone, I looked in windows, for the wealth I could not hope to own.  I did not know the ample bread, 'T was so unlike the crumb The birds and I had often shared In Nature's dining-room.  The plenty hurt me, 't was so new, -- Myself felt ill and odd, As berry of a mountain bush Transplanted to the road.  Nor was I hungry; so I found That hunger was a way Of persons outside windows, The entering takes away.      LI.  I gained it so,       By climbing slow, By catching at the twigs that grow Between the bliss and me.       It hung so high,       As well the sky       Attempt by strategy.   I said I gained it, --       This was all. Look, how I clutch it,       Lest it fall, And I a pauper go; Unfitted by an instant's grace For the contented beggar's face I wore an hour ago.      LII.  To learn the transport by the pain, As blind men learn the sun; To die of thirst, suspecting That brooks in meadows run;  To stay the homesick, homesick feet Upon a foreign shore Haunted by native lands, the while, And blue, beloved air --  This is the sovereign anguish, This, the signal woe! These are the patient laureates Whose voices, trained below,  Ascend in ceaseless carol, Inaudible, indeed, To us, the duller scholars Of the mysterious bard!      LIII.  RETURNING.  I years had been from home, And now, before the door, I dared not open, lest a face I never saw before  Stare vacant into mine And ask my business there. My business, -- just a life I left, Was such still dwelling there?  I fumbled at my nerve, I scanned the windows near; The silence like an ocean rolled, And broke against my ear.  I laughed a wooden laugh That I could fear a door, Who danger and the dead had faced, But never quaked before.  I fitted to the latch My hand, with trembling care, Lest back the awful door should spring, And leave me standing there.  I moved my fingers off As cautiously as glass, And held my ears, and like a thief Fled gasping from the house.      LIV.  PRAYER.  Prayer is the little implement Through which men reach Where presence is denied them. They fling their speech  By means of it in God's ear; If then He hear, This sums the apparatus Comprised in prayer.      LV.  I know that he exists Somewhere, in silence. He has hid his rare life From our gross eyes.  'T is an instant's play, 'T is a fond ambush, Just to make bliss Earn her own surprise!  But should the play Prove piercing earnest, Should the glee glaze In death's stiff stare,  Would not the fun Look too expensive? Would not the jest Have crawled too far?      LVI.  MELODIES UNHEARD.  Musicians wrestle everywhere: All day, among the crowded air,   I hear the silver strife; And -- waking long before the dawn -- Such transport breaks upon the town   I think it that \"new life!\"  It is not bird, it has no nest; Nor band, in brass and scarlet dressed,   Nor tambourine, nor man; It is not hymn from pulpit read, -- The morning stars the treble led   On time's first afternoon!  Some say it is the spheres at play! Some say that bright majority   Of vanished dames and men! Some think it service in the place Where we, with late, celestial face,   Please God, shall ascertain!      LVII.  CALLED BACK.  Just lost when I was saved! Just felt the world go by! Just girt me for the onset with eternity, When breath blew back, And on the other side I heard recede the disappointed tide!  Therefore, as one returned, I feel, Odd secrets of the line to tell! Some sailor, skirting foreign shores, Some pale reporter from the awful doors Before the seal!  Next time, to stay! Next time, the things to see By ear unheard, Unscrutinized by eye.  Next time, to tarry, While the ages steal, -- Slow tramp the centuries, And the cycles wheel.       II. LOVE.   I.  CHOICE.  Of all the souls that stand create I have elected one. When sense from spirit files away, And subterfuge is done;  When that which is and that which was Apart, intrinsic, stand, And this brief tragedy of flesh Is shifted like a sand;  When figures show their royal front And mists are carved away, -- Behold the atom I preferred To all the lists of clay!      II.  I have no life but this, To lead it here; Nor any death, but lest Dispelled from there;  Nor tie to earths to come, Nor action new, Except through this extent, The realm of you.      III.  Your riches taught me poverty. Myself a millionnaire In little wealths, -- as girls could boast, -- Till broad as Buenos Ayre,  You drifted your dominions A different Peru; And I esteemed all poverty, For life's estate with you.  Of mines I little know, myself, But just the names of gems, -- The colors of the commonest; And scarce of diadems  So much that, did I meet the queen, Her glory I should know: But this must be a different wealth, To miss it beggars so.  I 'm sure 't is India all day To those who look on you Without a stint, without a blame, -- Might I but be the Jew!  I 'm sure it is Golconda, Beyond my power to deem, -- To have a smile for mine each day, How better than a gem!  At least, it solaces to know That there exists a gold, Although I prove it just in time Its distance to behold!  It 's far, far treasure to surmise, And estimate the pearl That slipped my simple fingers through While just a girl at school!      IV.  THE CONTRACT.  I gave myself to him, And took himself for pay. The solemn contract of a life Was ratified this way.  The wealth might disappoint, Myself a poorer prove Than this great purchaser suspect, The daily own of Love  Depreciate the vision; But, till the merchant buy, Still fable, in the isles of spice, The subtle cargoes lie.  At least, 't is mutual risk, -- Some found it mutual gain; Sweet debt of Life, -- each night to owe, Insolvent, every noon.      V.  THE LETTER.  \"GOING to him! Happy letter! Tell him -- Tell him the page I didn't write; Tell him I only said the syntax, And left the verb and the pronoun out. Tell him just how the fingers hurried, Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow; And then you wished you had eyes in your pages, So you could see what moved them so.  \"Tell him it wasn't a practised writer, You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled; You could hear the bodice tug, behind you, As if it held but the might of a child; You almost pitied it, you, it worked so. Tell him -- No, you may quibble there, For it would split his heart to know it, And then you and I were silenter.  \"Tell him night finished before we finished, And the old clock kept neighing 'day!' And you got sleepy and begged to be ended -- What could it hinder so, to say? Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious, But if he ask where you are hid Until to-morrow, -- happy letter! Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!\"      VI.  The way I read a letter 's this: 'T is first I lock the door, And push it with my fingers next, For transport it be sure.  And then I go the furthest off To counteract a knock; Then draw my little letter forth And softly pick its lock.  Then, glancing narrow at the wall, And narrow at the floor, For firm conviction of a mouse Not exorcised before,  Peruse how infinite I am To -- no one that you know! And sigh for lack of heaven, -- but not The heaven the creeds bestow.      VII.  Wild nights! Wild nights! Were I with thee, Wild nights should be Our luxury!  Futile the winds To a heart in port, -- Done with the compass, Done with the chart.  Rowing in Eden! Ah! the sea! Might I but moor To-night in thee!      VIII.  AT HOME.  The night was wide, and furnished scant With but a single star, That often as a cloud it met Blew out itself for fear.  The wind pursued the little bush, And drove away the leaves November left; then clambered up And fretted in the eaves.  No squirrel went abroad; A dog's belated feet Like intermittent plush were heard Adown the empty street.  To feel if blinds be fast, And closer to the fire Her little rocking-chair to draw, And shiver for the poor,  The housewife's gentle task. \"How pleasanter,\" said she Unto the sofa opposite, \"The sleet than May -- no thee!\"      IX."]]]
