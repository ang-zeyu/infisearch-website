[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/123"],["title","At the Earth's Core (#6)"],["body"," will they do with you?\" I asked.  \"Where are they taking us?\"  Again she looked her incredulity.  \"I can almost believe that you are of another world,\" she said, \"for otherwise such ignorance were inexplicable.  Do you really mean that you do not know that the Sagoths are the creatures of the Mahars--the mighty Mahars who think they own Pellucidar and all that walks or grows upon its surface, or creeps or burrows beneath, or swims within its lakes and oceans, or flies through its air?  Next you will be telling me that you never before heard of the Mahars!\"  I was loath to do it, and further incur her scorn; but there was no alternative if I were to absorb knowledge, so I made a clean breast of my pitiful ignorance as to the mighty Mahars.  She was shocked.  But she did her very best to enlighten me, though much that she said was as Greek would have been to her.  She described the Mahars largely by comparisons.  In this way they were like unto thipdars, in that to the hairless lidi.  About all I gleaned of them was that they were quite hideous, had wings, and webbed feet; lived in cities built beneath the ground; could swim under water for great distances, and were very, very wise.  The Sagoths were their weapons of offense and defense, and the races like herself were their hands and feet--they were the slaves and servants who did all the manual labor.  The Mahars were the heads--the brains--of the inner world.  I longed to see this wondrous race of supermen.  Perry learned the language with me.  When we halted, as we occasionally did, though sometimes the halts seemed ages apart, he would join in the conversation, as would Ghak the Hairy One, he who was chained just ahead of Dian the Beautiful.  Ahead of Ghak was Hooja the Sly One.  He too entered the conversation occasionally.  Most of his remarks were directed toward Dian the Beautiful.  It didn't take half an eye to see that he had developed a bad case; but the girl appeared totally oblivious to his thinly veiled advances.  Did I say thinly veiled? There is a race of men in New Zealand, or Australia, I have forgotten which, who indicate their preference for the lady of their affections by banging her over the head with a bludgeon.  By comparison with this method Hooja's lovemaking might be called thinly veiled.  At first it caused me to blush violently although I have seen several Old Years out at Rectors, and in other less fashionable places off Broadway, and in Vienna, and Hamburg.  But the girl!  She was magnificent.  It was easy to see that she considered herself as entirely above and apart from her present surroundings and company.  She talked with me, and with Perry, and with the taciturn Ghak because we were respectful; but she couldn't even see Hooja the Sly One, much less hear him, and that made him furious.  He tried to get one of the Sagoths to move the girl up ahead of him in the slave gang, but the fellow only poked him with his spear and told him that he had selected the girl for his own property--that he would buy her from the Mahars as soon as they reached Phutra.  Phutra, it seemed, was the city of our destination.  After passing over the first chain of mountains we skirted a salt sea, upon whose bosom swam countless horrid things.  Seal-like creatures there were with long necks stretching ten and more feet above their enormous bodies and whose snake heads were split with gaping mouths bristling with countless fangs.  There were huge tortoises too, paddling about among these other reptiles, which Perry said were Plesiosaurs of the Lias.  I didn't question his veracity--they might have been most anything.  Dian told me they were tandorazes, or tandors of the sea, and that the other, and more fearsome reptiles, which occasionally rose from the deep to do battle with them, were azdyryths, or sea-dyryths--Perry called them Ichthyosaurs.  They resembled a whale with the head of an alligator.  I had forgotten what little geology I had studied at school--about all that remained was an impression of horror that the illustrations of restored prehistoric monsters had made upon me, and a well-defined belief that any man with a pig's shank and a vivid imagination could \"restore\" most any sort of paleolithic monster he saw fit, and take rank as a first class paleontologist.  But when I saw these sleek, shiny carcasses shimmering in the sunlight as they emerged from the ocean, shaking their giant heads; when I saw the waters roll from their sinuous bodies in miniature waterfalls as they glided hither and thither, now upon the surface, now half submerged; as I saw them meet, open-mouthed, hissing and snorting, in their titanic and interminable warring I realized how futile is man's poor, weak imagination by comparison with Nature's incredible genius.  And Perry!  He was absolutely flabbergasted.  He said so himself.  \"David,\" he remarked, after we had marched for a long time beside that awful sea.  \"David, I used to teach geology, and I thought that I believed what I taught; but now I see that I did not believe it--that it is impossible for man to believe such things as these unless he sees them with his own eyes.  We take things for granted, perhaps, because we are told them over and over again, and have no way of disproving them--like religions, for example; but we don't believe them, we only think we do.  If you ever get back to the outer world you will find that the geologists and paleontologists will be the first to set you down a liar, for they know that no such creatures as they restore ever existed.  It is all right to IMAGINE them as existing in an equally imaginary epoch--but now?  poof!\"  At the next halt Hooja the Sly One managed to find enough slack chain to permit him to worm himself back quite close to Dian.  We were all standing, and as he edged near the girl she turned her back upon him in such a truly earthly feminine manner that I could scarce repress a smile; but it was a short-lived smile for on the instant the Sly One's hand fell upon the girl's bare arm, jerking her roughly toward him.  I was not then familiar with the customs or social ethics which prevailed within Pellucidar; but even so I did not need the appealing look which the girl shot to me from her magnificent eyes to influence my subsequent act.  What the Sly One's intention was I paused not to inquire; but instead, before he could lay hold of her with his other hand, I placed a right to the point of his jaw that felled him in his tracks.  A roar of approval went up from those of the other prisoners and the Sagoths who had witnessed the brief drama; not, as I later learned, because I had championed the girl, but for the neat and, to them, astounding method by which I had bested Hooja.  And the girl?  At first she looked at me with wide, wondering eyes, and then she dropped her head, her face half averted, and a delicate flush suffused her cheek.  For a moment she stood thus in silence, and then her head went high, and she turned her back upon me as she had upon Hooja.  Some of the prisoners laughed, and I saw the face of Ghak the Hairy One go very black as he looked at me searchingly.  And what I could see of Dian's cheek went suddenly from red to white.  Immediately after we resumed the march, and though I realized that in some way I had offended Dian the Beautiful I could not prevail upon her to talk with me that I might learn wherein I had erred--in fact I might quite as well have been addressing a sphinx for all the attention I got.  At last my own foolish pride stepped in and prevented my making any further attempts, and thus a companionship that without my realizing it had come to mean a great deal to me was cut off. Thereafter I confined my conversation to Perry.  Hooja did not renew his advances toward the girl, nor did he again venture near me.  Again the weary and apparently interminable marching became a perfect nightmare of horrors to me.  The more firmly fixed became the realization that the girl's friendship had meant so much to me, the more I came to miss it; and the more impregnable the barrier of silly pride.  But I was very young and would not ask Ghak for the explanation which I was sure he could give, and that might have made everything all right again.  On the march, or during halts, Dian refused consistently to notice me--when her eyes wandered in my direction she looked either over my head or directly through me.  At last I became desperate, and determined to swallow my self-esteem, and again beg her to tell me how I had offended, and how I might make reparation.  I made up my mind that I should do this at the next halt.  We were approaching another range of mountains at the time, and when we reached them, instead of winding across them through some high-flung pass we entered a mighty natural tunnel--a series of labyrinthine grottoes, dark as Erebus.  The guards had no torches or light of any description.  In fact we had seen no artificial light or sign of fire since we had entered Pellucidar.  In a land of perpetual noon there is no need of light above ground, yet I marveled that they had no means of lighting their way through these dark, subterranean passages.  So we crept along at a snail's pace, with much stumbling and falling--the guards keeping up a singsong chant ahead of us, interspersed with certain high notes which I found always indicated rough places and turns.  Halts were now more frequent, but I did not wish to speak to Dian until I could see from the expression of her face how she was receiving my apologies.  At last a faint glow ahead forewarned us of the end of the tunnel, for which I for one was devoutly thankful.  Then at a sudden turn we emerged into the full light of the noonday sun.  But with it came a sudden realization of what meant to me a real catastrophe--Dian was gone, and with her a half-dozen other prisoners. The guards saw it too, and the ferocity of their rage was terrible to behold.  Their awesome, bestial faces"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/123"],["title","At the Earth's Core (#7)"],["body","contorted in the most diabolical expressions, as they accused each other of responsibility for the loss.  Finally they fell upon us, beating us with their spear shafts, and hatchets.  They had already killed two near the head of the line, and were like to have finished the balance of us when their leader finally put a stop to the brutal slaughter.  Never in all my life had I witnessed a more horrible exhibition of bestial rage--I thanked God that Dian had not been one of those left to endure it.  Of the twelve prisoners who had been chained ahead of me each alternate one had been freed commencing with Dian.  Hooja was gone.  Ghak remained.  What could it mean?  How had it been accomplished?  The commander of the guards was investigating.  Soon he discovered that the rude locks which had held the neckbands in place had been deftly picked.  \"Hooja the Sly One,\" murmured Ghak, who was now next to me in line. \"He has taken the girl that you would not have,\" he continued, glancing at me.  \"That I would not have!\" I cried.  \"What do you mean?\"  He looked at me closely for a moment.  \"I have doubted your story that you are from another world,\" he said at last, \"but yet upon no other grounds could your ignorance of the ways of Pellucidar be explained.  Do you really mean that you do not know that you offended the Beautiful One, and how?\"  \"I do not know, Ghak,\" I replied.  \"Then shall I tell you.  When a man of Pellucidar intervenes between another man and the woman the other man would have, the woman belongs to the victor.  Dian the Beautiful belongs to you.  You should have claimed her or released her.  Had you taken her hand, it would have indicated your desire to make her your mate, and had you raised her hand above her head and then dropped it, it would have meant that you did not wish her for a mate and that you released her from all obligation to you.  By doing neither you have put upon her the greatest affront that a man may put upon a woman.  Now she is your slave.  No man will take her as mate, or may take her honorably, until he shall have overcome you in combat, and men do not choose slave women as their mates--at least not the men of Pellucidar.\"  \"I did not know, Ghak,\" I cried.  \"I did not know.  Not for all Pellucidar would I have harmed Dian the Beautiful by word, or look, or act of mine.  I do not want her as my slave.  I do not want her as my--\" but here I stopped.  The vision of that sweet and innocent face floated before me amidst the soft mists of imagination, and where I had on the second believed that I clung only to the memory of a gentle friendship I had lost, yet now it seemed that it would have been disloyalty to her to have said that I did not want Dian the Beautiful as my mate.  I had not thought of her except as a welcome friend in a strange, cruel world.  Even now I did not think that I loved her.  I believe Ghak must have read the truth more in my expression than in my words, for presently he laid his hand upon my shoulder.  \"Man of another world,\" he said, \"I believe you.  Lips may lie, but when the heart speaks through the eyes it tells only the truth.  Your heart has spoken to me.  I know now that you meant no affront to Dian the Beautiful.  She is not of my tribe; but her mother is my sister. She does not know it--her mother was stolen by Dian's father who came with many others of the tribe of Amoz to battle with us for our women--the most beautiful women of Pellucidar.  Then was her father king of Amoz, and her mother was daughter of the king of Sari--to whose power I, his son, have succeeded.  Dian is the daughter of kings, though her father is no longer king since the sadok tossed him and Jubal the Ugly One wrested his kingship from him.  Because of her lineage the wrong you did her was greatly magnified in the eyes of all who saw it.  She will never forgive you.\"  I asked Ghak if there was not some way in which I could release the girl from the bondage and ignominy I had unwittingly placed upon her.  \"If ever you find her, yes,\" he answered.  \"Merely to raise her hand above her head and drop it in the presence of others is sufficient to release her; but how may you ever find her, you who are doomed to a life of slavery yourself in the buried city of Phutra?\"  \"Is there no escape?\" I asked.  \"Hooja the Sly One escaped and took the others with him,\" replied Ghak. \"But there are no more dark places on the way to Phutra, and once there it is not so easy--the Mahars are very wise.  Even if one escaped from Phutra there are the thipdars--they would find you, and then--\" the Hairy One shuddered.  \"No, you will never escape the Mahars.\"  It was a cheerful prospect.  I asked Perry what he thought about it; but he only shrugged his shoulders and continued a longwinded prayer he had been at for some time.  He was wont to say that the only redeeming feature of our captivity was the ample time it gave him for the improvisation of prayers--it was becoming an obsession with him.  The Sagoths had begun to take notice of his habit of declaiming throughout entire marches.  One of them asked him what he was saying--to whom he was talking.  The question gave me an idea, so I answered quickly before Perry could say anything.  \"Do not interrupt him,\" I said.  \"He is a very holy man in the world from which we come.  He is speaking to spirits which you cannot see--do not interrupt him or they will spring out of the air upon you and rend you limb from limb--like that,\" and I jumped toward the great brute with a loud \"Boo!\" that sent him stumbling backward.  I took a long chance, I realized, but if we could make any capital out of Perry's harmless mania I wanted to make it while the making was prime.  It worked splendidly.  The Sagoths treated us both with marked respect during the balance of the journey, and then passed the word along to their masters, the Mahars.  Two marches after this episode we came to the city of Phutra.  The entrance to it was marked by two lofty towers of granite, which guarded a flight of steps leading to the buried city.  Sagoths were on guard here as well as at a hundred or more other towers scattered about over a large plain.    V  SLAVES   AS WE DESCENDED THE BROAD STAIRCASE WHICH led to the main avenue of Phutra I caught my first sight of the dominant race of the inner world. Involuntarily I shrank back as one of the creatures approached to inspect us.  A more hideous thing it would be impossible to imagine. The all-powerful Mahars of Pellucidar are great reptiles, some six or eight feet in length, with long narrow heads and great round eyes. Their beak-like mouths are lined with sharp, white fangs, and the backs of their huge, lizard bodies are serrated into bony ridges from their necks to the end of their long tails.  Their feet are equipped with three webbed toes, while from the fore feet membranous wings, which are attached to their bodies just in front of the hind legs, protrude at an angle of 45 degrees toward the rear, ending in sharp points several feet above their bodies.  I glanced at Perry as the thing passed me to inspect him.  The old man was gazing at the horrid creature with wide astonished eyes.  When it passed on, he turned to me.  \"A rhamphorhynchus of the Middle Olitic, David,\" he said, \"but, gad, how enormous!  The largest remains we ever have discovered have never indicated a size greater than that attained by an ordinary crow.\"  As we continued on through the main avenue of Phutra we saw many thousand of the creatures coming and going upon their daily duties. They paid but little attention to us.  Phutra is laid out underground with a regularity that indicates remarkable engineering skill.  It is hewn from solid limestone strata.  The streets are broad and of a uniform height of twenty feet.  At intervals tubes pierce the roof of this underground city, and by means of lenses and reflectors transmit the sunlight, softened and diffused, to dispel what would otherwise be Cimmerian darkness.  In like manner air is introduced.  Perry and I were taken, with Ghak, to a large public building, where one of the Sagoths who had formed our guard explained to a Maharan official the circumstances surrounding our capture.  The method of communication between these two was remarkable in that no spoken words were exchanged.  They employed a species of sign language.  As I was to learn later, the Mahars have no ears, not any spoken language.  Among themselves they communicate by means of what Perry says must be a sixth sense which is cognizant of a fourth dimension.  I never did quite grasp him, though he endeavored to explain it to me upon numerous occasions.  I suggested telepathy, but he said no, that it was not telepathy since they could only communicate when in each others' presence, nor could they talk with the Sagoths or the other inhabitants of Pellucidar by the same method they used to converse with one another.  \"What they do,\" said Perry, \"is to project their thoughts into the fourth dimension, when they become appreciable to the sixth sense of their listener.  Do I make myself quite clear?\"  \"You do not, Perry,\" I replied.  He shook his head in despair, and returned to his work.  They had set us to carrying a great accumulation of Maharan literature from one apartment to another, and there arranging it upon shelves.  I suggested to Perry that we were in the public library of Phutra, but later, as he commenced to discover the key to their written language, he assured me that we were handling the ancient archives of the race.  During this period my thoughts were continually upon Dian the Beautiful.  I was, of course, glad that she had escaped the Mahars, and the fate that had been suggested by the Sagoth who had threatened to purchase her upon our arrival at Phutra.  I often wondered if the little party of fugitives had been overtaken by the guards who had returned to search for them.  Sometimes I was not so sure but that I should have been more contented "]]]
