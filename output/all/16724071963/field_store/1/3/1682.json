He is as poor as a church mouse, and would be very glad of the money.\"  \"That reminds me,\" said Miss Allison, \"he asked me if the boys could not come down to see Jonesy this afternoon, and bring the bear. He thought it would give the little fellow so much pleasure, and might help him to forget his suffering.\"  Mrs. MacIntyre hesitated. \"I do not believe their mother would like it,\" she answered. \"Sydney is careful enough about their associates, but Elise is doubly particular. You can imagine how much badness this child must know when you remember how he has been reared. He told me that his name is Jones Carter, and that he cannot remember ever having a father or a mother. I questioned him very closely this morning. He comes from the worst of the Chicago slums. He slept in the cellar of one of its poorest tenement houses, and lived in the gutters. He has a brother only a little older, who is a bootblack. On days when shines were plentiful they had something to eat, otherwise they starved or begged.\"  \"Poor little lamb,\" murmured Miss Allison.  \"It was by the brother's advice he came away with that tramp,\" continued Mrs. MacIntyre. \"He had gotten possession of that trained bear in some way, and probably took a fancy to Jones because he could whistle and dance all sorts of jigs. He probably thought it would be a good thing to have a child with him to work on peoples' sympathies. They walked all the way from Chicago to Lloydsborough, Jones told me, excepting three days' journey they made in a wagon. They have been two months on the road, and showed the bear in the country places they passed through. They avoided the large towns.\"  \"Think what a Christmas he must have had!\" exclaimed Miss Allison.  \"Christmas! I doubt if he ever heard the word. His speech is something shocking; nothing but the slang of the streets, and so ungrammatical that I could scarcely understand him at times. No, I am very sure that neither Sydney nor Elise would want the boys to be with him.\"  \"But he is so little, mother, and so sick and pitiful looking,\" pleaded Miss Allison. \"Surely he cannot know so very much badness or hurt the boys if they go down to cheer him up for a little while.\"  Notwithstanding Mrs. Maclntyre's fears, she consented to the boys visiting Jonesy that afternoon. She could not resist the professor's second appeal or the boys' own urging.  They took the bear with them, which Jonesy welcomed like a lost friend. They spent an interesting hour among the professor's collections, listening to his explanations in his funny broken English. Then they explored his cottage, much amused by his queer housekeeping, cracked nuts on the hearth, and roasted apples on a string in front of the fire.  Jonesy did not seem to be cheered up by the visit as much as the professor had expected. Presently the old man left the room and Keith sat down on the side of the bed.  \"What makes you so still, Jonesy?\" he asked. \"You haven't said a word for the last half hour.\"  \"I was thinking about Barney,\" he answered, keeping his face turned away. \"Barney is my brother, you know.\"  \"Yes, so grandmother said,\" answered Keith. \"How big is he?\"  \"'Bout as big as yourn.\" There was a choke in Jonesy's voice now. \"Seein' yourn put his arm across your shoulder and pullin' your head back by one ear and pinchin' you sort in fun like, made me think the way Barney uster do to me.\"  Keith did not know what to say, so there was a long, awkward pause.  \"I'd never a-left him,\" said Jonesy, \"but the boss said it 'ud only be a little while and we'd make so much money showin' the bear that I'd have a whole pile to take home. I could ride back on the cars and take a whole trunk full of nice things to Barney,--clothes, and candy, and a swell watch and chain, and a bustin' beauty of a bike. Now the bear's sold and the boss has run away, and I don't know how I can get back to Barney. Him an me's all each other's got, and I want to see him _so_ bad.\"  The little fellow's lip quivered, and he put up one bandaged hand to wipe away the hot tears that would keep coming, in spite of his efforts not to make a baby of himself. There was something so pitiful in the gesture that Keith looked across at Malcolm and then patted the bedclothes with an affectionate little hand.  \"Never mind, Jonesy,\" he said, \"papa will be home in the spring and he'll send you back to Barney.\" But Jonesy never having known anything of fathers whose chief pleasure is in spending money to make little sons happy, was not comforted by that promise as much as Keith thought he ought to be.  \"But I won't be here then,\" he sobbed. \"They're goin' to put me in a 'sylum, and I can't get out for so long that maybe Barney will be dead before we ever find each other again.\"  He was crying violently now.  \"Who is going to put you in an asylum?\" asked Malcolm, lifting an end of the pillow under which Jonesy's head had burrowed, to hide the grief that his eight-year-old manhood made him too proud to show.  \"An old lady with white hair what comes here every day. The professor said he would keep me if he wasn't so old and hard up, and she said as how a 'sylum was the proper place for a child of the slums, and he said yes if they wasn't nobody to care for 'em. But I've got somebody!\" he cried. \"I've got Barney! Oh, _don't_ let them shut me up somewhere so I can't never get back to Barney!\"  \"They don't shut you up when they send you to an asylum,\" said Malcolm. \"The one near here is a lovely big house, with acres of green grass around it, and orchards and vine-yards, and they are ever so good to the children, and give them plenty to eat and wear, and send them to school.\"  \"Barney wouldn't be there,\" sobbed Jonesy, diving under the pillow again. \"I don't want nothing but him.\"  \"Well, we'll see what we can do,\" said Malcolm, as he heard the professor coming back. \"If we could only keep you here until spring, I am sure that papa would send you back all right. He's always helping people that get into trouble.\"  Jonesy took his little snub nose out of the pillow as the professor came in, and looked around defiantly as if ready to fight the first one who dared to hint that he had been crying. The boys took their leave soon after, leading the bear back to his new quarters in the carriage house, where they had made him a comfortable den. Then they walked slowly up to the house, their arms thrown across each other's shoulders.  \"S'pose it was us,\" said Keith, after walking on a little way in silence. \"S'pose that you and I were left of all the family, and didn't have any friends in the world, and I was to get separated from you and couldn't get back?\"  \"That would be tough luck, for sure,\" answered Malcolm.  \"Don't you s'pose Jonesy feels as badly about it as we would?\" asked Keith.  \"Shouldn't be surprised,\" said Malcolm, beginning to whistle. Keith joined in, and keeping step to the tune, like two soldiers, they marched on into the house.  Virginia found them in the library, a little while later, sitting on the hearth-rug, tailor-fashion. They were still talking about Jonesy. They could think of nothing else but the loneliness of the little waif, and his pitiful appeal: \"Oh, don't let them shut me up where I can't never get back to Barney.\"  \"Why don't you write to your father?\" asked Virginia, when they had told her the story of their visit.  \"Oh, it is so hard to explain things in a letter,\" answered Malcolm, \"and being off there, he'd say that grandmother and all the grown people certainly know best. But if he could see Jonesy,--how pitiful looking he is, and hear him crying to go back to his brother, I know he'd feel the way we do about it.\"  \"I called the professor out in the hall, and told him so,\" said Keith, \"and asked him if he couldn't adopt Jonesy, or something, until papa comes home. But he said that he is too poor. He has only a few dollars a month to live on. I didn't mind asking him. He smiled in that big, kind way he always does. He said Jonesy was lots of company, and he would like to keep him this summer, if he could afford it, and let him get well and strong out here in the country.\"  \"Then he would keep him till Uncle Sydney comes, if somebody would pay his board?\" asked Virginia.  \"Yes,\" said Malcolm, \"but that doesn't help matters much, for we children are the only ones who want him to stay, and our monthly allowances, all put together, wouldn't be enough.\"  \"We might earn the money ourselves,\" suggested Virginia, after awhile, breaking a long silence.  \"How?\" demanded Malcolm. \"Now, Ginger, you know, as well as I do, there is no way for us to earn anything this time of year. You can't pick fruit in the dead of winter, can you? or pull weeds, or rake leaves? What other way is there?\"  \"We might go to every house in the valley, and exhibit the bear,\" said Keith, \"taking up a collection each time.\"  \"Now you've made me think of it,\" cried Virginia, excitedly. \"I've thought of a good way. We'll give Jonesy a benefit, like great singers have. The bear will be the star performer, and we'll all act, too, and sell the tickets, and have tableaux. I love to arrange tableaux. We were always having them out at the fort.\"  \"I bid to show off the bear,\" cried Malcolm, entering into Virginia's plan at once. \"May be I'll learn something to recite, too.\"  \"I'll help print the tickets,\" said Keith, \"and go around selling them, and be in anything you want me to be. How many tableaux are you going to have, Ginger?\"  \"I can't tell yet,\" she answered, but a moment after she cried out, her eyes shining with pleasure, \"Oh, I've thought of a lovely one. We can have the Little Colonel and the bear for 'Beauty and the Beast.'\"  Malcolm promptly turned a somersault on the rug, to express his approval, but came up with a grave face, saying, \"I'll bet that grandmother will say we can't have it.\"  \"Let's get Aunt Allison on our side,\" suggested Virginia. \"She's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12317"],["title","Two Little Knights of Kentucky (#8)"],["body"," up in her room now, painting a picture.\"  A little sigh of disappointment escaped Miss Allison's lips, as she heard the rush of feet on the stairs. This was the first time that she had touched her brushes since the children's coming, and she had hoped that this one afternoon would be free from interruption, when she heard them planning their afternoon's occupations at the lunch-table. They had come back before the little water-colour sketch she was making was quite finished.  There was no disappointment, however, in the bright face she turned toward them, and Virginia lost no time in beginning her story. She had been elected to tell it, but before it was done all three had had a part in the telling, and all three were waiting with wistful eyes for her answer.  \"Well, what is it you want me to do?\" she asked, finally.  \"Oh, just be on our side!\" they exclaimed, \"and get grandmother to say yes. You see she doesn't feel about Jonesy the way we do. She is willing to pay a great deal of money to have him taken off and cared for, but she says she doesn't see how grandchildren of hers can be so interested in a little tramp that comes from nobody knows where, and who will probably end his days in a penitentiary.\"  Aunt Allison answered Malcolm's last remark a little sternly. \"You must understand that it is only for your own good that she is opposed to Jonesy's staying,\" she said. \"There is nobody in the valley so generous and kind to the poor as your grandmother.\" \"Yes'm,\" said Virginia, meekly, \"but you'll ask her, won't you please, auntie?\"  Miss Allison smiled at her persistence. \"Wait until I finish this,\" she said. \"Then I'll go down-stairs and put the matter before her, and report to you at dinner-time. Now are you satisfied?\"  \"Yes,\" they cried in chorus, \"you're on our side. It's all right now!\" With a series of hearty hugs that left her almost breathless, they hurried away.  When Miss Allison kept her promise she did not go to her mother with the children's story of Jonesy, to move her to pity. She told her simply what they wanted, and then said, \"Mother, you know I have begun to teach the children the 'Vision of Sir Launfal.' Virginia has learned every word of it, and the boys will soon know all but the preludes. There will never be a better chance than this for them to learn the lesson:       \"'Not what we give, but what we share,      For the gift without the giver is bare.'  \"This would be a real sharing of themselves, all their time and best energies, for they will have to work hard to get up such an entertainment as this. It isn't for Jonesy's sake I ask it, but for the children's own good.\"  The old lady looked thoughtfully into the fire a moment, and then said, \"Maybe you are right, Allison. I do want to keep them unspotted from a knowledge of the world's evils, but I do not want to make them selfish. If this little beggar at the gate can teach them where to find the Holy Grail, through unselfish service to him, I do not want to stand in the way. Bless their little hearts, they may play Sir Launfal if they want to, and may they have as beautiful a vision as his!\"    CHAPTER V.  JONESY'S BENEFIT.  The Jonesy Benefit grew like Jack's bean-stalk after Miss Allison took charge of it. There was less than a week in which to get ready, as the boys insisted on having it on the twenty-second of February, in honour of Washington's birthday; but in that short time the childish show which Ginger had proposed grew into an entertainment so beautiful and elaborate that the neighbourhood talked of it for weeks after.  Miss Allison spent one sleepless night, planning her campaign like a general, and next morning had an army of helpers at work. Before the day was over she sent a letter to an old school friend of hers in the city, Miss Eleanor Bond, who had been her most intimate companion all through her school-days, and who still spent a part of every summer with her.  \"Dearest Nell,\" the letter said, \"come out to-morrow on the first afternoon train, if you love me. The children are getting up an entertainment for charity, which shall be duly explained on your arrival. No time now. I am superintending a force of carpenters in the college hall, where the entertainment is to take place, have two seamstresses in the house hurrying up costumes, and am helping mother scour the country for pretty children to put in the tableaux.  \"The house is like an ant-hill in commotion, there is so much scurrying around; but I know that is what you thoroughly enjoy. You shall have a finger in every pie if you will come out and help me to make this a never-to-be-forgotten occasion.  \"I want to make the old days of chivalry live again for Virginia and Malcolm and Keith. I am going back to King Arthur's Court for the flower of knighthood at his round table. Come and read for us between tableaux as only you can do. Be the interpreter of 'Sir Launfal's Vision' and the 'Idylls of the King,' Give us the benefit of your talent for sweet charity's sake, if not for the sake of 'auld lang syne' and your devoted ALLISON.\"  \"She'll be here,\" said Miss Allison, as she sealed the letter, nodding confidently to Mrs. Sherman, who had come over to help with Lloyd's costume. \"You remember Nell Bond, do you not? She took the prize every year in elocution, and was always in demand at every entertainment. She is the most charming reader I ever heard, and as for story-telling--well, she's better than the 'Arabian Nights.' You must let the Little Colonel come over every evening while she is here.\"  Miss Bond arrived the next day, and her visit was a time of continual delight to the children. They followed her wherever she went, until Mrs. Maclntyre laughingly called her the 'Pied Piper of Hamelin,' and asked what she had done to bewitch them.  The first night they gathered around the library-table, all as busy as bees. Keith and the Little Colonel were cutting tinsel into various lengths for Virginia to tie into fringe for a gay banner. Malcolm was gilding some old spurs, Mrs. Maclntyre sat stringing yards of wax beads, that gleamed softly in the lamplight like great rope of pearls, and Mrs. Sherman was painting the posters, which were to be put up in the post-office and depot as advertisements of the Jonesy Benefit.  Miss Allison, who had been busy for hours with pasteboard and glue, tin-foil and scissors, held up the suit of mail which she had just finished.  \"Isn't that fine!\" cried Malcolm. \"It looks exactly like some of the armour we saw in the Tower of London, doesn't it, Keith?\"  \"I've thought of a riddle!\" exclaimed Virginia. \"Why is Aunt Allison's head like Aladdin's lamp?\"  \"'Cause it's so bright?\" ventured Malcolm.  \"No; because she has only to rub it, and everything she thinks of appears. I don't see how it is possible to make so many beautiful things out of almost nothing.\"  Virginia looked admiringly around at all the pretty articles scattered over the room. A helmet with nodding white plumes lay on the piano. A queen's robe trailed its royal ermine beside it. A sword with a jewelled hilt shone on the mantel, and a dozen dazzling shields were ranged in various places on the low bookshelves.  It was easy, in the midst of such surroundings, for the children to imagine themselves back in the days of King Arthur and his court, while Miss Bond sat there telling them such beautiful tales of its fair ladies and noble knights. Indeed, before the day of the entertainment came around they even found themselves talking to each other in the quaint speech of that olden time.  When Malcolm accidentally ran against his grandmother in the hall, instead of his usual, \"Oh, excuse me, grandmother,\" it was \"Prithee grant me gracious pardon, fair dame. Not for a king's ransom would I have thus jostled thee in such unseemly haste!\" And Ginger, instead of giving Keith a slap when he teasingly penned her up in a corner, to make her divide some nuts with him, said, in a most tragic way, \"Unhand me, villain, or by my troth thou'lt rue this ruffian conduct sore!\"  The library-table was strewn with books of old court life, and pictures of kings and queens whose costumes were to be copied in the tableaux. There was one book which Keith carried around with him until he had spelled out the whole beautiful tale. It was called \"In Kings' Houses,\" and was the story of the little Duke of Gloster who was made a knight in his boyhood. And when Keith had read it himself, he took it down to the professor's, and read it all over again to Jonesy.  [Illustration: \"THERE WAS ONE BOOK WHICH KEITH CARRIED AROUND WITH HIM.\"]  \"Think how grand he must have looked, Jonesy,\" cried Keith, \"and I am to be dressed exactly like him when I am knighted in the tableau.\" Then he read the description again:  \"'A suit of white velvet embroidered with seed pearls, and literally blazing with jewels,--even the buttons being great brilliants. From his shoulder hung a cloak of azure blue velvet, the colour of the order, richly wrought with gold; and around his neck he wore the magnificent collar and jewel of St. George and the Dragon, that was the personal gift of his Majesty, the king.'  \"Think how splendid it must have been, Jonesy, when the procession came in to the music of trumpets and bugles and silver flutes and hautboys! Wouldn't you like to have seen the heralds marching by, two by two, in cloth of gold, with an escort of the queen's guard following? All of England's best and bravest were there, and they sat in the carven stalls in St. George's Chapel, with their gorgeous banners drooping over them. I saw that chapel, Jonesy, when we were in England, and I saw where the knights kept the 'vigil of arms' in the holy places, the night before they took their vows.\" He picked up the book and read again: \"'Fasting and praying and lonely watching by night in the great abbey where there are so many dead folk.'  \"Oh, don't you wish you could have lived in those days, Jonesy, and have been a knight?\"  It"]]]
