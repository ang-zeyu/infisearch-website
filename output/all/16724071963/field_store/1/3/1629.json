No one (excepting his wife) wanted to hear it, but the Pumpherston song had become traditional with the McOstrich entertainments.  One could not have the latter without the former.  'He's got a new sang,' Mrs. Pumpherston intimated, with a stimulating glance round the company, 'an' he's got a tunin' fork, forbye, that saves him wrastlin' for the richt key, as it were. Tune up, Geordie!'  Mr. Pumpherston deliberately produced the fork, struck it on his knee, winced, muttered 'dammit,' and gazed upwards.  Not so many years ago Macgregor would have exploded; to-night he was occupied in trying to find Christina's hand under the table.  'Doh, me, soh, doh, soh, me, doh,' hummed the vocalist.  Christina, who had been looking desperately serious, let out a small squeak and hurriedly blew her nose.  Macgregor regarded her in astonishment, and she withdrew the little finger she had permitted him to capture.  'It's a patriotic sang in honour,' Mrs. Pumpherston started to explain----  'Ach, woman!' cried her spouse, 'ye've made me loss ma key.'  He re-struck the fork irritably, and proceeded to inform the company--'It's no exac'ly a new sang, but----'  'Ye'll be lossin' yer key again, Geordie.'  With a sulky grunt, Mr. Pumpherston once more struck his fork, but this time discreetly on the leg of his chair, and in his own good time made a feeble attack on 'Rule, Britannia.'  'This is fair rotten,' Macgregor muttered at the third verse, resentful that his love should be apparently enjoying it.  'Remember ye're a sojer,' she whispered back, 'an' thole.'  But she let him find her hand again.  The drear performance came to an end amid applause sufficient to satisfy Mrs. Pumpherston.  'Excep' when ye cracked on \"arose,\" ye managed fine,' she said to her perspiring mate, and to the hostess, 'What think ye o' that for a patriotic sang, Mistress McOstrich?'  'Oh, splendid--splendid!' replied Mrs. McOstrich with a nervous start.  For the last five minutes she had been lost in furtive contemplation of her two youthful guests, her withered countenance more melancholy even than usual.  Ten o'clock struck, and, to Macgregor's ill-disguised delight, Christina rose and said she must be going.  Mrs. McOstrich accompanied the two to the outer door.  There she took Christina's hand, stroked it once or twice, and let it go.  'Macgreegor has been a frien' o' mines since he was a gey wee laddie,' she said, 'an' I'm rael prood to ha'e had his intended in ma hoose.  I'll never forget neither o' ye.  If I had had a laddie o' ma ain, I couldna ha'e wished him to dae better nor Macgreegor has done--in every way.' Abruptly she pressed something into Christina's hand and closed the girl's fingers upon it.  'Dinna look at it noo,' she went on hastily.  'It's yours, dearie, but ye'll gi'e it to Macgreegor when the time comes for him to--to gang.  Ma grandfayther was a dandy in his way, an' it's a' he left me, though I had great expectations.'  Gently she pushed the pair of them forth and closed the door.  At the foot of the stair, under a feeble gas-jet, Christina opened her hand, disclosing an old-fashioned ring set with a blood-stone.  'Ye never tell't me she was like that,' the girl said softly, yet a little accusingly.  'I never thought,' muttered he, truthfully enough.     VII  WILLIE STANDS UP  It is not the most roughly nurtured of us who will rough it the most cheerfully.  Willie Thomson, of harsh and meagre upbringing, was the grumbler of his billet.  He found fault with the camp fare, accommodation and hours in particular, with the discipline in general.  Yet, oddly enough, after a fortnight or so, he seemed to accept the physical drill at 7 a.m. with a sort of dour satisfaction, though he never had a good word to say for it.  His complaints at last exasperated Macgregor, who, on a certain wet evening, when half the men were lounging drearily within the billet, snapped the question:  'What the blazes made ye enlist?'  The answer was unexpected.  'You!'  'Ye're a leear!'  With great deliberation Willie arose from the bench on which he had been reclining.  He spat on the floor and proceeded to unbutton his tunic,  'Nae man,' he declared, as if addressing an audience, 'calls me that twicet!'  'Wudna be worth his while,' said his friend, carelessly.  'I challenge ye to repeat it.'  The tone of the words caused Macgregor to stare, but he said calmly enough: 'Either ye was a leear the nicht ye enlisted, or ye're a leear noo.  Ye can tak' yer choice.'  'An' you can tak' aff yer coat!'  'I dinna need to undress for to gi'e ye a hammerin', if that's what ye're efter.  But I'm no gaun to dae it here.  We'd baith get into trouble.'  'Ye're henny,' said Willie.  Macgregor was more puzzled than angry.  Here was Willie positively asking for a punching in public!  'What's wrang wi' ye, Wullie?' he asked in a lowered voice.  'Wait till we get oor next leave.  The chaps here'll jist laugh at ye.'  'It'll maybe be you they'll laugh at.  Come on, ye cooard!'  By this time the other fellows had become interested, and one of them, commonly called Jake, the oldest in the billet, came forward.  'What's up, Grocer?' he inquired of Macgregor, who had early earned his nickname thanks to Uncle Purdie's frequent consignments of dainties, which were greatly appreciated by all in the billet.  'He's aff his onion,' said Macgregor, disgustedly.  'He says I'm a leear,' said Willie, sullenly.  Jake's humorous mouth went straight, not without apparent effort.  'Weel,' he said slowly, judicially, 'it's maybe a peety to fecht aboot a trifle like that, an' we canna permit kickin', clawin' an' bitin' in this genteel estayblishment; but seein' it's a dull evenin', an' jist for to help for to pass the time, I'll len' ye ma auld boxin' gloves, an' ye can bash awa' till ye're wearit.  Sam!' he called over his shoulder, 'fetch the gloves, an' I'll see fair play. . . .  I suppose.  Grocer, ye dinna want to apologeeze.'  Macgregor's reply was to loosen his tunic.  He was annoyed with himself and irritated by Willie, but above all he resented the publicity of the affair.  With mock solemnity Jake turned to Willie.  'In case o' yer decease, wud ye no like to leave a lovin' message for the aunt we've heard ye blessin' noo an' then?'  'To pot wi' her!' muttered Willie.  A high falsetto voice from the gathering' audience cried: 'Oh, ye bad boy, come here till I skelp ye!'--and there was a general laugh, in which the hapless object did not join.  'Ach, dinna torment him,' Macgregor said impulsively.  While willing hands fixed the gloves on the combatants the necessary floor space was cleared.  There were numerous offers of the services of seconds, but the self-constituted master of ceremonies, Jake, vetoed all formalities.  'Let them dae battle in their ain fashion,' said he.  'It'll be mair fun for us.  But it's understood that first blood ends it. Are ye ready, lads?  Then get to wark.  Nae hittin' ablow the belt.'  By this time Macgregor was beginning to feel amused.  The sight of Willie and himself in the big gloves tickled him.  'Come on, Wullie,' he called cheerfully.  'Am I a leear?' Willie demanded.  'Ye are!--but ye canna help it.'  'I can if I like!' yelled Willie, losing his head.  'Tak' that!'  A tremendous buffet with the right intended for Macgregor's nose caught his forehead with a sounding whack.  Thus began an extraordinary battle in which there was little attempt at dodging, less at guarding and none at feinting.  Each man confined his attentions to his opponent's face and endeavoured to reached the bull's eye, as it were, of the target, though that point was not often attained, and never with spectacular effect. Ere long, however, Macgregor developed a puffiness around his left eye while Willie exhibited a swelling lip.  Both soon were pouring out sweat.  They fought with frantic enthusiasm and notable waste of energy.  The audience laughed itself into helplessness, gasping advice and encouragement to each with a fine lack of favouritism.  'Wire in, wee yin!  Try again, pipeshanks!  Weel hit, Grocer!  That had him, Wullie!--ye'll be a corporal afore yer auntie!  Haw, Mac, that was a knock-oot, if it had struck!  Cheer up, Private Thomson; gi'e him the kidney punch on his whuskers!  Guid stroke. Grocer!--fair on his goods' entrance!  We'll be payin' for to see ye in pictur' hooses yet--the Brithers Basher!  Gor, this is better nor a funeral!  Keep it up, lads!'  And so forth.  But it was far too fast to last.  A few minutes, and both were utterly pumped.  As though with mutual agreement, they paused panting.  Neither had gained any visible advantage.  'Nae blood yet,' remarked some one in tones of regret mingled with hope.  'Never heed,' interposed Jake, humanely Tak' aff their gloves. They've done enough.  We'll ca' it a draw--or to be conteenued in oor next dull evenin'--whichever they like.  I hope you twa lads 'll never learn scienteefic boxin'.  There's ower little fun in the warld nooadays.'  Neither offered any resistance to the removal of the gloves.  'Shake han's, lads,' said Jake.  To Macgregor's surprise, Willie's hand was out before his own.  'I'm a leear if ye like,' said Willie, still panting, 'but I can stan' up to ye noo!'  'So ye can,' Macgregor admitted--a little reluctantly perhaps, for he had long been used to being the winner.  'If I wasna teetotal,' Willie added in a burst of generosity, 'I wud stan' ye a drink.'     VIII  CORRESPONDENCE  _Macgregor to Christina_  MY DEAR CHRISTINA,--  I was looking for your letter the whole of yesterday, but it did not come till this morning at 8.35 a.m., and I am sorry to say it is not near as nice as I expected.  Some parts is niceish, but others is rotten.  What for do you ask me if I have spotted many pretty girls here, when you know I would not be for taking the troubble of spoting any girl in the world "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12269"],["title","Wee Macgreegor Enlists (#5)"],["body","you, and besides they are all terrible ugly here.  Yesterday I seen 2 that made me feel sick.  Willie said they was on for being picked up, and he give a wink at one of them, and she put out her tongue at him, but no more happened.  They was quite young girls, though hiddeous, but Willie did not seem to mind their faces ['mugs' scored out].  Willie is greatly changed since the last few weeks.  You would scarcely know him, he is that fond of exercises.  He is near as strong as me.  They are telling him he will be a corporal before his aunt, and he gets huffy.  He spoke too much about his aunt at the beginning, cursing and swearing like, and now he can't get away from it, poor sole.  It is a pity she does not send him some small presents now and then.  He is awful jealous of the chaps that get things from home; you can tell it by his face and the bad language he uses about the billet and the Zeppelins for 2 hours after.  So just for fun, when I was writing to Uncle Purdie, I said please send the next parcel addressed to Pte. Wm. Thomson.  Willie got it last night.  He never let on he was pleased, but he was.  He was freer nor I expected him to be with the groceries, but he eat a tin of salmon all by his lone, and in the middle of the night, at 3.15 a.m., he was took horrid bad, and 7 of the chaps made him take their private meddicines, and he could not turn out for physical exercise in the morning, but is now much better, and has made a good tea, and is eating 1 lb. cokernut lozenges at this very minute.  I have no more news.  But, dear Christina, I am not well pleased with your letter at all.  I am quite disconsoled about it.  It makes me feel like wet cold feet that has no hopes of ever getting dry and cosy again.  When I seen yourself last Friday night I was not feared for anything, for you was that kind and soft-hearted, and you laughed that gentle and pretty, and your words did sound sweet even when they was chaffing-like.  But now I am fearing something has gone wrong.  Are you offended?  I did not mean to do so.  Have you got tired of me?  I would think _yes_ at once, if you was the common sort of girl, but you are the honest sort that would tell me straight, and not with hints in a letter.  So if you are not offended, I think you must have catched a cold in your head, or got something wrong with your inside.  Colds in the head is very permanent [? prevalent] in the billet for the present, and the chaps with them are ready to bite your nose off if you say a word to them.  Dear, dear Christina, please tell me what is the matter.  I will not sleep well till I hear from you.  The stew for dinner to-day was better than the stew yesterday, but I could not take my usual. I am fed up with anxiousness.  Kindly write by return.  Why do you never put any X X X in your letters?  Do you want me to stop putting them in mine?    Your aff. intended,     M. ROBINSON.  P.S.--It is not to be the Dardanelles, but we are likely going to Flanders next week.  Excuse writing and spelling as usual.  X X X Please write at once.   _Christina to Macgregor_  DEAR SIR,--  Your esteemed favour duly to hand and contents noted.  I deeply regret that my last communication did not meet with your unmitigated approval, but oh, dear wee Mac, I could not write a lovey-dovey letter to save my only neck.  In my youth, when penny novels were my sole mental support, I used to see myself pouring forth screeds of beauteous remarks to an adoring swine 6 1/2 ft. high x 2 3/4 ft. broad.  But now it can't be done.  Still, I am sorry if my letter hurt you.  It was never meant to do that, lad. You must learn to take my chaff and other folks' unseriously. Honest, if I had been really thinking of you along with other girls, I would not have mentioned it.  I'm not that sort of girl, and I'm not the sort that gets cold in the head, either, thanking you all the same for kind enquiries.  But I'm by no means faultless.  I get what the novelists call flippant when I am feeling most solemn.  I was a bit down-hearted when I wrote last, for your letter had said 'Dardanelles.'  Now you say 'Flanders,' which is no better, but I am not going to cry this time.  Surely they won't send you away so soon, dear.  Glad to hear Willie is greatly changed, and I hope he will keep on changing, though I could never admire a man that ate a whole tin of salmon in once.  I'm sure the two girls were not so dreadfully plain as you report.  Had they got their hair up?  Girls don't usually put out their tongues at young men after their hair is up, so I presume they were _very_ young.  It was like you to ask your uncle to send Willie the parcel.  Miss Tod is not so brisk just now.  The doctor says she must either drink less tea or become a chronic dyspeptomaniac.  She prefers the latter.  Poor old thing, her joys are few and simple!  Trade is not so bad.  A new line in poetical patriotical postcards is going well.  The poetry is the worst yet.  I am sending you some cigarettes with my uncle's best wishes and a pair of socks with mine.  Perhaps you have enough socks from home already.  If so, give them to W. T., and ask him from me to practise blushing.  He can begin by winking at himself in a mirror thrice daily.  When are you going to get leave again?  Miss Tod says I can get away at 6, any night I want to.  No; I don't want you to stop putting those marks in your letters.  If you can find one in this letter, you may take it, and I hope it will make you half as happy as I want you to be.  Good-night.    CHRISTINA.     IX  THE FAT GIRL  Never a day passed without its camp rumour.  If Macgregor was disposed to be over-credulous, his friend Willie was sceptical enough for two.  'I hear we're for the Dardanelles next week,' the former observed one afternoon.  Willie snorted.  'What the ---- wud they send us yins to the Dardanelles afore we ken hoo to fire a rifle?'  'I heard it for a fac',' Macgregor returned imperturbably.  'They want us yins for begnet wark, no for snipin'.'  'Begnet wark!  I'll bet ye fifty fags I get a dizzen Turks on ma begnet afore ye get twa on yours!'  Macgregor let the boastful irrelevance pass.  'I wonder,' he said, thoughtfully, 'if we'll get extra leave afore we gang.'  'Plenty o' leave!  Keep yer mind easy, Macgreegor.  It's a million in gold to a rotten banana we never get a bash at onybody.  It's fair putrid to think o' a' the terrible hard wark we're daein' here to nae purpose.  I wisht I was deid!  Can ye len' 'us a bob?'  'I ha'ena got it, Wullie; honest.' Willie sadly shook his head. 'That moll o' yours,' said he, 'is awfu' expensive.  Ye've nae notion o' managin' weemen.  Listen, an' I'll tell ye something.  Ye mind last Monday?  Weel, I had a late pass that nicht, an' I thocht I wud miss seein' ma aunt's ugly for wance--though it meant missin' a guid meal forbye.  So when I got to Glesca I picked up thon fat girl we used to fling rubbish at when we was young.  An', by Jings, she was pleased an' prood!  She stood me ma tea, includin' twa hot pies, an' she gi'ed me a packet o' fags--guid quality, mind ye!--an' she peyed for first-class sates in a pictur' hoose! That's hoo to dae it, ma lad!' he concluded complacently.  'An' what did you gi'e her?' Macgregor inquired, after a pause.  'Ma comp'ny, likewise some nice fresh air fried in naething, for I took her for a short walk.  I could manage wi' ninepence.'  'Ach, I didna think ye was as mean as that, Wullie!  Was--was she guid-lookin'?'  'I didna notice her face a great deal; but she's a beezer for stootness.  I'm gaun to meet her again on ma next leave.  If I tell her we've orders for the Dardanelles, there's nae guessin' what she'll dae for me.'  'She maun be unco saft,' Macgregor commented pityingly.  'Maybe the kilt had something to dae wi' it,' Willie modestly allowed.  'They a' adore the kilt.  Can ye no spare saxpence . . . weel, thruppence?'  'I could spare ye a bat on the ear, but I'll tell ye what I'll dae. I've got some money comin' the morn, an' I'll present ye wi' twa bob, if ye'll tak' yer oath to spend them baith on gi'ein' the fat yin a treat.'  Willie gasped.  'D'ye think I'm completely mad?'  There's something wrang wi' ye when ye can sponge aft a girl, even supposin' she's fat.  So ye can tak' ma offer or a dashed guid hammerin' when the first chance comes.'  'Dinna be sae free wi' yer hammerin's, ma lord!  Remember, it was a draw the last time.'  'I wasna angry, an' I had gloves on.' Willie considered for a moment and decided to compromise.  'I'll burst a bob on her to please ye.'  'Twa--or a hammerin'.'  'But what ---- guid is the siller gaun to dae me, if I squander it a' on her?  Ye micht as weel fling it in the Clyde.  She's no wantin' that sort o' kindness frae me.  She prefers a bit cuddle.'  'Did ye cuddle her?' Macgregor asked with an interest indifferently concealed.  'Some o' her.  But she's earnin' guid money at the ----'  'I dinna suppose she wud ha'e treated ye excep' she had mair money nor brains.'  'She wud pairt wi' her last farden for ma sake!'  'Ach, awa' an' eat grass!  It's weel seen that men are scarce the noo.'  'Mind wha ye're insultin'!'  'I'm gaun up to the billet.' Macgregor said, shortly, and walked off.  Presently, Willie, a new idea in his busy brain, overtook him.  'Macgreegor, if ye len' me thruppence the noo, I'll ca' it a bargain aboot the twa bob.'  He got the pennies then, and on the following day a florin, upon which he took a solemn oath.  But as he fingered the silver later he smiled secretly and almost serenely.  If the fat girl had stood him a substantial meal, cigarettes and a picture entertainment for nothing, what might not he expect as a return for the squandering of two shillings?  As for Macgregor, his motives were probably not unmixed: the pleasure which he foresaw for the poor, fat girl was contingent on the agony of Willie while spending good money on a person other than himself.  However, Willie was not long in securing a late"]]]
