Dutchmen were not behind the door when the Almighty gave out noses, and their deceitfulness is in proportion to their noses.\"  The company murmured assent, and one gentleman, with a rather large organ, concealed it in a red cotton handkerchief, trumpeting uneasily.  \"The Holy One, blessed be He, has given them larger noses than us,\" said the _Maggid_, \"because they have to talk through them so much.\"  A guffaw greeted this sally. The _Maggid's_ wit was relished even when not coming from the pulpit. To the outsider this disparagement of the Dutch nose might have seemed a case of pot calling kettle black. The _Maggid_ poured himself out a glass of rum, under cover of the laughter, and murmuring \"Life to you.\" in Hebrew, gulped it down, and added, \"They oughtn't to call it the Dutch tongue, but the Dutch nose.\"  \"Yes, I always wonder how they can understand one another,\" said Mrs. Belcovitch, \"with their _chatuchayacatigewesepoopa_.\" She laughed heartily over her onomatopoetic addition to the Yiddish vocabulary, screwing up her nose to give it due effect. She was a small sickly-looking woman, with black eyes, and shrivelled skin, and the wig without which no virtuous wife is complete. For a married woman must sacrifice her tresses on the altar of home, lest she snare other men with such sensuous baits. As a rule, she enters into the spirit of the self-denying ordinance so enthusiastically as to become hideous hastily in every other respect. It is forgotten that a husband is also a man. Mrs. Belcovitch's head was not completely shaven and shorn, for a lower stratum of an unmatched shade of brown peeped out in front of the _shaitel_, not even coinciding as to the route of the central parting.  Meantime Pesach Weingott and Alte (Fanny) Belcovitch held each other's hand, guiltily conscious of Batavian corpuscles in the young man's blood. Pesach had a Dutch uncle, but as he had never talked like him Alte alone knew. Alte wasn't her real name, by the way, and Alte was the last person in the world to know what it was. She was the Belcovitches' first successful child; the others all died before she was born. Driven frantic by a fate crueller than barrenness, the Belcovitches consulted an old Polish Rabbi, who told them they displayed too much fond solicitude for their children, provoking Heaven thereby; in future, they were to let no one but themselves know their next child's name, and never to whisper it till the child was safely married. In such wise, Heaven would not be incessantly reminded of the existence of their dear one, and would not go out of its way to castigate them. The ruse succeeded, and Alte was anxiously waiting to change both her names under the _Chuppah_, and to gratify her life-long curiosity on the subject. Meantime, her mother had been calling her \"Alte,\" or \"old 'un,\" which sounded endearing to the child, but grated on the woman arriving ever nearer to the years of discretion. Occasionally, Mrs. Belcovitch succumbed to the prevailing tendency, and called her \"Fanny,\" just as she sometimes thought of herself as Mrs. Belcovitch, though her name was Kosminski. When Alte first went to school in London, the Head Mistress said, \"What's your name?\" The little \"old 'un\" had not sufficient English to understand the question, but she remembered that the Head Mistress had made the same sounds to the preceding applicant, and, where some little girls would have put their pinafores to their eyes and cried, Fanny showed herself full of resource. As the last little girl, though patently awe-struck, had come off with flying colors, merely by whimpering \"Fanny Belcovitch,\" Alte imitated these sounds as well as she was able.  \"Fanny Belcovitch, did you say?\" said the Head Mistress, pausing with arrested pen.  Alte nodded her flaxen poll vigorously.  \"Fanny Belcovitch,\" she repeated, getting the syllables better on a second hearing.  The Head Mistress turned to an assistant.  \"Isn't it astonishing how names repeat themselves? Two girls, one after the other, both with exactly the same name.\"  They were used to coincidences in the school, where, by reason of the tribal relationship of the pupils, there was a great run on some half-a-dozen names. Mr. Kosminski took several years to understand that Alte had disowned him. When it dawned upon him he was not angry, and acquiesced in his fate. It was the only domestic detail in which he had allowed himself to be led by his children. Like his wife, Chayah, he was gradually persuaded into the belief that he was a born Belcovitch, or at least that Belcovitch was Kosminski translated into English.  Blissfully unconscious of the Dutch taint in Pesach Weingott, Bear Belcovitch bustled about in reckless hospitality. He felt that engagements were not every-day events, and that even if his whole half-sovereign's worth of festive provision was swallowed up, he would not mind much. He wore a high hat, a well-preserved black coat, with a cutaway waistcoat, showing a quantity of glazed shirtfront and a massive watch chain. They were his Sabbath clothes, and, like the Sabbath they honored, were of immemorial antiquity. The shirt served him for seven Sabbaths, or a week of Sabbaths, being carefully folded after each. His boots had the Sabbath polish. The hat was the one he bought when he first set up as a _Baal Habaas_ or respectable pillar of the synagogue; for even in the smallest _Chevra_ the high hat comes next in sanctity to the Scroll of the Law, and he who does not wear it may never hope to attain to congregational dignities. The gloss on that hat was wonderful, considering it had been out unprotected in all winds and weathers. Not that Mr. Belcovitch did not possess an umbrella. He had two,--one of fine new silk, the other a medley of broken ribs and cotton rags. Becky had given him the first to prevent the family disgrace of the spectacle of his promenades with the second. But he would not carry the new one on week-days because it was too good. And on Sabbaths it is a sin to carry any umbrella. So Becky's self-sacrifice was vain, and her umbrella stood in the corner, a standing gratification to the proud possessor. Kosminski had had a hard fight for his substance, and was not given to waste. He was a tall, harsh-looking man of fifty, with grizzled hair, to whom life meant work, and work meant money, and money meant savings. In Parliamentary Blue-Books, English newspapers, and the Berner Street Socialistic Club, he was called a \"sweater,\" and the comic papers pictured him with a protuberant paunch and a greasy smile, but he had not the remotest idea that he was other than a God-fearing, industrious, and even philanthropic citizen. The measure that had been dealt to him he did but deal to others. He saw no reason why immigrant paupers should not live on a crown a week while he taught them how to handle a press-iron or work a sewing machine. They were much better off than in Poland. He would have been glad of such an income himself in those terrible first days of English life when he saw his wife and his two babes starving before his eyes, and was only precluded from investing a casual twopence in poison by ignorance of the English name for anything deadly. And what did he live on now? The fowl, the pint of haricot beans, and the haddocks which Chayah purchased for the Sabbath overlapped into the middle of next week, a quarter of a pound of coffee lasted the whole week, the grounds being decocted till every grain of virtue was extracted. Black bread and potatoes and pickled herrings made up the bulk of the every-day diet No, no one could accuse Bear Belcovitch of fattening on the entrails of his employees. The furniture was of the simplest and shabbiest,--no aesthetic instinct urged the Kosminskis to overpass the bare necessities of existence, except in dress. The only concessions to art were a crudely-colored _Mizrach_ on the east wall, to indicate the direction towards which the Jew should pray, and the mantelpiece mirror which was bordered with yellow scalloped paper (to save the gilt) and ornamented at each corner with paper roses that bloomed afresh every Passover. And yet Bear Belcovitch had lived in much better style in Poland, possessing a brass wash-hand basin, a copper saucepan, silver spoons, a silver consecration beaker, and a cupboard with glass doors, and he frequently adverted to their fond memories. But he brought nothing away except his bedding, and that was pawned in Germany on the route. When he arrived in London he had with him three groschen and a family.  \"What do you think, Pesach,\" said Becky, as soon as she could get at her prospective brother-in-law through the barriers of congratulatory countrymen. \"The stuff that came through there\"--she pointed to the discolored fragment of ceiling--\"was soup. That silly little Esther spilt all she got from the kitchen.\"  \"_Achi-nebbich_, poor little thing,\" cried Mrs. Kosminski, who was in a tender mood, \"very likely it hungers them sore upstairs. The father is out of work.\"  \"Knowest thou what, mother,\" put in Fanny. \"Suppose we give them our soup. Aunt Leah has just fetched it for us. Have we not a special supper to-night?\"  \"But father?\" murmured the little woman dubiously.  \"Oh, he won't notice it. I don't think he knows the soup kitchen opens to-night. Let me, mother.\"  And Fanny, letting Pesach's hand go, slipped out to the room that served as a kitchen, and bore the still-steaming pot upstairs. Pesach, who had pursued her, followed with some hunks of bread and a piece of lighted candle, which, while intended only to illumine the journey, came in handy at the terminus. And the festive company grinned and winked when the pair disappeared, and made jocular quotations from the Old Testament and the Rabbis. But the lovers did not kiss when they came out of the garret of the Ansells; their eyes were wet, and they went softly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12680"],["title","Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (#6)"],["body","hand in hand, feeling linked by a deeper love than before.  Thus did Providence hand over the soup the Belcovitches took from old habit to a more necessitous quarter, and demonstrate in double sense that Charity never faileth. Nor was this the only mulct which Providence exacted from the happy father, for later on a townsman of his appeared on the scene in a long capote, and with a grimy woe-begone expression. He was a \"greener\" of the greenest order, having landed at the docks only a few hours ago, bringing over with him a great deal of luggage in the shape of faith in God, and in the auriferous character of London pavements. On arriving in England, he gave a casual glance at the metropolis and demanded to be directed to a synagogue wherein to shake himself after the journey. His devotions over, he tracked out Mr. Kosminski, whose address on a much-creased bit of paper had been his talisman of hope during the voyage. In his native town, where the Jews groaned beneath divers and sore oppressions, the fame of Kosminski, the pioneer, the Croesus, was a legend. Mr. Kosminski was prepared for these contingencies. He went to his bedroom, dragged out a heavy wooden chest from under the bed, unlocked it and plunged his hand into a large dirty linen bag, full of coins. The instinct of generosity which was upon him made him count out forty-eight of them. He bore them to the \"greener\" in over-brimming palms and the foreigner, unconscious how much he owed to the felicitous coincidence of his visit with Fanny's betrothal, saw fortune visibly within his grasp. He went out, his heart bursting with gratitude, his pocket with four dozen farthings. They took him in and gave him hot soup at a Poor Jews' Shelter, whither his townsman had directed him. Kosminski returned to the banqueting room, thrilling from head to foot with the approval of his conscience. He patted Becky's curly head and said:  \"Well, Becky, when shall we be dancing at your wedding?\"  Becky shook her curls. Her young men could not have a poorer opinion of one another than Becky had of them all. Their homage pleased her, though it did not raise them in her esteem. Lovers grew like blackberries--only more so; for they were an evergreen stock. Or, as her mother put it in her coarse, peasant manner. _Chasanim_ were as plentiful as the street-dogs. Becky's beaux sat on the stairs before she was up and became early risers in their love for her, each anxious to be the first to bid their Penelope of the buttonholes good morrow. It was said that Kosminski's success as a \"sweater\" was due to his beauteous Becky, the flower of sartorial youth gravitating to the work-room of this East London Laban. What they admired in Becky was that there was so much of her. Still it was not enough to go round, and though Becky might keep nine lovers in hand without fear of being set down as a flirt, a larger number of tailors would have been less consistent with prospective monogamy.  \"I'm not going to throw myself away like Fanny,\" said she confidentially to Pesach Weingott in the course of the evening. He smiled apologetically. \"Fanny always had low views,\" continued Becky. \"But I always said I would marry a gentleman.\"  \"And I dare say,\" answered Pesach, stung into the retort, \"Fanny could marry a gentlemen, too, if she wanted.\"  Becky's idea of a gentleman was a clerk or a school-master, who had no manual labor except scribbling or flogging. In her matrimonial views Becky was typical. She despised the status of her parents and looked to marry out of it. They for their part could not understand the desire to be other than themselves.  \"I don't say Fanny couldn't,\" she admitted. \"All I say is, nobody could call this a luck-match.\"  \"Ah, thou hast me too many flies in thy nose,\" reprovingly interposed Mrs. Belcovitch, who had just crawled up. \"Thou art too high-class.\"  Becky tossed her head. \"I've got a new dolman,\" she said, turning to one of her young men who was present by special grace. \"You should see me in it. I look noble.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Belcovitch proudly. \"It shines in the sun.\"  \"Is it like the one Bessie Sugarman's got?\" inquired the young man.  \"Bessie Sugarman!\" echoed Becky scornfully. \"She gets all her things from the tallyman. She pretends to be so grand, but all her jewelry is paid for at so much a week.\"  \"So long as it is paid for,\" said Fanny, catching the words and turning a happy face on her sister.  \"Not so jealous, Alte,\" said her mother. \"When I shall win on the lottery, I will buy thee also a dolman.\"  Almost all the company speculated on the Hamburg lottery, which, whether they were speaking Yiddish or English, they invariably accentuated on the last syllable. When an inhabitant of the Ghetto won even his money back, the news circulated like wild-fire, and there was a rush to the agents for tickets. The chances of sudden wealth floated like dazzling Will o' the Wisps on the horizon, illumining the gray perspectives of the future. The lottery took the poor ticket-holders out of themselves, and gave them an interest in life apart from machine-cotton, lasts or tobacco-leaf. The English laborer, who has been forbidden State Lotteries, relieves the monotony of existence by an extremely indirect interest in the achievements of a special breed of horses.  \"_Nu_, Pesach, another glass of rum,\" said Mr. Belcovitch genially to his future son-in-law and boarder.  \"Yes, I will,\" said Pesach. \"After all, this is the first time I've got engaged.\"  The rum was of Mr. Belcovitch's own manufacture; its ingredients were unknown, but the fame of it travelled on currents of air to the remotest parts of the house. Even the inhabitants of the garrets sniffed and thought of turpentine. Pesach swallowed the concoction, murmuring \"To life\" afresh. His throat felt like the funnel of a steamer, and there were tears in his eyes when he put down the glass.  \"Ah, that was good,\" he murmured.  \"Not like thy English drinks, eh?\" said Mr. Belcovitch.  \"England!\" snorted Pesach in royal disdain. \"What a country! Daddle-doo is a language and ginger-beer a liquor.\"  \"Daddle doo\" was Pesach's way of saying \"That'll do.\" It was one of the first English idioms he picked up, and its puerility made him facetious. It seemed to smack of the nursery; when a nation expressed its soul thus, the existence of a beverage like ginger-beer could occasion no further surprise.  \"You shan't have anything stronger than ginger-beer when we're married,\" said Fanny laughingly. \"I am not going to have any drinking.'\"  \"But I'll get drunk on ginger-beer,\" Pesach laughed back.  \"You can't,\" Fanny said, shaking her large fond smile to and fro. \"By my health, not.\"  \"Ha! Ha! Ha! Can't even get _shikkur_ on it. What a liquor!\"  In the first Anglo-Jewish circles with which Pesach had scraped acquaintance, ginger-beer was the prevalent drink; and, generalizing almost as hastily as if he were going to write a book on the country, he concluded that it was the national beverage. He had long since discovered his mistake, but the drift of the discussion reminded Becky of a chance for an arrow.  \"On the day when you sit for joy, Pesach,\" she said slily. \"I shall send you a valentine.\"  Pesach colored up and those in the secret laughed; the reference was to another of Pesach's early ideas. Some mischievous gossip had heard him arguing with another Greener outside a stationer's shop blazing with comic valentines. The two foreigners were extremely puzzled to understand what these monstrosities portended; Pesach, however, laid it down that the microcephalous gentlemen with tremendous legs, and the ladies five-sixths head and one-sixth skirt, were representations of the English peasants who lived in the little villages up country.  \"When I sit for joy,\" retorted Pesach, \"it will not be the season for valentines.\"  \"Won't it though!\" cried Becky, shaking her frizzly black curls. \"You'll be a pair of comic 'uns.\"  \"All right, Becky,\" said Alte good-humoredly. \"Your turn'll come, and then we shall have the laugh of you.\"  \"Never,\" said Becky. \"What do I want with a man?\"  The arm of the specially invited young man was round her as she spoke.  \"Don't make _schnecks_,\" said Fanny.  \"It's not affectation. I mean it. What's the good of the men who visit father? There isn't a gentleman among them.\"  \"Ah, wait till I win on the lottery,\" said the special young man.  \"Then, vy not take another eighth of a ticket?\" inquired Sugarman the _Shadchan_, who seemed to spring from the other end of the room. He was one of the greatest Talmudists in London--a lean, hungry-looking man, sharp of feature and acute of intellect. \"Look at Mrs. Robinson--I've just won her over twenty pounds, and she only gave me two pounds for myself. I call it a _cherpah_--a shame.\"  \"Yes, but you stole another two pounds,\" said Becky.  \"How do you know?\" said Sugarman startled.  Becky winked and shook her head sapiently. \"Never _you_ mind.\"  The published list of the winning numbers was so complex in construction that Sugarman had ample opportunities of bewildering his clients.  \"I von't sell you no more tickets,\" said Sugarman with righteous indignation.  \"A fat lot I care,\" said Becky, tossing her curls.  \"Thou carest for nothing,\" said Mrs. Belcovitch, seizing the opportunity for maternal admonition. \"Thou hast not even brought me my medicine to-night. Thou wilt find, it on the chest of drawers in the bedroom.\"  Becky shook herself impatiently.  \"I will go,\" said the special young man.  \"No, it is not beautiful that a young man shall go into my bedroom in my absence,\" said Mrs. Belcovitch blushing.  Becky left the room.  \"Thou knowest,\" said Mrs. Belcovitch, addressing herself to the special young man, \"I suffer greatly from my legs. One is a thick one, and one a thin one.\"  The young man sighed sympathetically.  \"Whence comes it?\" he asked.  \"Do I know? I was born so. My poor lambkin (this was the way Mrs. Belcovitch always referred to her dead mother) had"]]]
