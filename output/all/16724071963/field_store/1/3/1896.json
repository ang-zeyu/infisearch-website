It has little to say of the ultimate psychological basis of speech and gives only enough of the actual descriptive or historical facts of particular languages to illustrate principles. Its main purpose is to show what I conceive language to be, what is its variability in place and time, and what are its relations to other fundamental human interests--the problem of thought, the nature of the historical process, race, culture, art.  The perspective thus gained will be useful, I hope, both to linguistic students and to the outside public that is half inclined to dismiss linguistic notions as the private pedantries of essentially idle minds. Knowledge of the wider relations of their science is essential to professional students of language if they are to be saved from a sterile and purely technical attitude. Among contemporary writers of influence on liberal thought Croce is one of the very few who have gained an understanding of the fundamental significance of language. He has pointed out its close relation to the problem of art. I am deeply indebted to him for this insight. Quite aside from their intrinsic interest, linguistic forms and historical processes have the greatest possible diagnostic value for the understanding of some of the more difficult and elusive problems in the psychology of thought and in the strange, cumulative drift in the life of the human spirit that we call history or progress or evolution. This value depends chiefly on the unconscious and unrationalized nature of linguistic structure.  I have avoided most of the technical terms and all of the technical symbols of the linguistic academy. There is not a single diacritical mark in the book. Where possible, the discussion is based on English material. It was necessary, however, for the scheme of the book, which includes a consideration of the protean forms in which human thought has found expression, to quote some exotic instances. For these no apology seems necessary. Owing to limitations of space I have had to leave out many ideas or principles that I should have liked to touch upon. Other points have had to be barely hinted at in a sentence or flying phrase. Nevertheless, I trust that enough has here been brought together to serve as a stimulus for the more fundamental study of a neglected field.  I desire to express my cordial appreciation of the friendly advice and helpful suggestions of a number of friends who have read the work in manuscript, notably Profs. A.L. Kroeber and R.H. Lowie of the University of California, Prof. W.D. Wallis of Reed College, and Prof. J. Zeitlin of the University of Illinois.  EDWARD SAPIR.  OTTAWA, ONT., April 8, 1921.     CONTENTS  PREFACE  CHAPTER    I. INTRODUCTORY: LANGUAGE DEFINED      Language a cultural, not a biologically inherited, function.

THE ELEMENTS OF SPEECH      Sounds not properly elements of speech. Words and significant parts     of words (radical elements, grammatical elements). Types of words.     The word a formal, not a functional unit. The word has a real     psychological existence. The sentence. The cognitive, volitional,     and emotional aspects of speech. Feeling-tones of words.    III. THE SOUNDS OF LANGUAGE      The vast number of possible sounds. The articulating organs and     their share in the production of speech sounds: lungs, glottal     cords, nose, mouth and its parts. Vowel articulations. How and where     consonants are articulated. The phonetic habits of a language. The     \"values\" of sounds. Phonetic patterns.    IV. FORM IN LANGUAGE: GRAMMATICAL PROCESSES      Formal processes as distinct from grammatical functions.     Intercrossing of the two points of view. Six main types of     grammatical process. Word sequence as a method. Compounding of     radical elements. Affixing: prefixes and suffixes; infixes. Internal     vocalic change; consonantal change. Reduplication. Functional     variations of stress; of pitch.    V. FORM IN LANGUAGE: GRAMMATICAL CONCEPTS      Analysis of a typical English sentence. Types of concepts     illustrated by it. Inconsistent expression of analogous concepts.     How the same sentence may be expressed in other languages with     striking differences in the selection and grouping of concepts.     Essential and non-essential concepts. The mixing of essential     relational concepts with secondary ones of more concrete order. Form     for form's sake. Classification of linguistic concepts: basic or     concrete, derivational, concrete relational, pure relational.     Tendency for these types of concepts to flow into each other.     Categories expressed in various grammatical systems. Order and     stress as relating principles in the sentence. Concord. Parts of     speech: no absolute classification possible; noun and verb.    VI. TYPES OF LINGUISTIC STRUCTURE      The possibility of classifying languages. Difficulties.     Classification into form-languages and formless languages not valid.     Classification according to formal processes used not practicable.     Classification according to degree of synthesis. \"Inflective\" and     \"agglutinative.\" Fusion and symbolism as linguistic techniques.     Agglutination. \"Inflective\" a confused term. Threefold     classification suggested: what types of concepts are expressed? what     is the prevailing technique? what is the degree of synthesis? Four     fundamental conceptual types. Examples tabulated. Historical test of     the validity of the suggested conceptual classification.    VII. LANGUAGE AS A HISTORICAL PRODUCT: DRIFT      Variability of language. Individual and dialectic variations. Time     variation or \"drift.\" How dialects arise. Linguistic stocks.     Direction or \"slope\" of linguistic drift. Tendencies illustrated in     an English sentence. Hesitations of usage as symptomatic of the     direction of drift. Leveling tendencies in English. Weakening of     case elements. Tendency to fixed position in the sentence. Drift     toward the invariable word.    VIII. LANGUAGE AS A HISTORICAL PRODUCT: PHONETIC LAW      Parallels in drift in related languages.

Phonetic interinfluencings of neighboring languages. Morphological     borrowings. Morphological resemblances as vestiges of genetic     relationship.    X. LANGUAGE, RACE, AND CULTURE      Na√Øve tendency to consider linguistic, racial, and cultural     groupings as congruent. Race and language need not correspond.     Cultural and linguistic boundaries not identical. Coincidences     between linguistic cleavages and those of language and culture due     to historical, not intrinsic psychological, causes. Language does     not in any deep sense \"reflect\" culture.    XL LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE      Language as the material or medium of literature. Literature may     move on the generalized linguistic plane or may be inseparable from     specific linguistic conditions. Language as a collective art.     Necessary esthetic advantages or limitations in any language. Style     as conditioned by inherent features of the language. Prosody as     conditioned by the phonetic dynamics of a language.  INDEX     I  INTRODUCTORY: LANGUAGE DEFINED   Speech is so familiar a feature of daily life that we rarely pause to define it. It seems as natural to man as walking, and only less so than breathing. Yet it needs but a moment's reflection to convince us that this naturalness of speech is but an illusory feeling. The process of acquiring speech is, in sober fact, an utterly different sort of thing from the process of learning to walk. In the case of the latter function, culture, in other words, the traditional body of social usage, is not seriously brought into play. The child is individually equipped, by the complex set of factors that we term biological heredity, to make all the needed muscular and nervous adjustments that result in walking. Indeed, the very conformation of these muscles and of the appropriate parts of the nervous system may be said to be primarily adapted to the movements made in walking and in similar activities. In a very real sense the normal human being is predestined to walk, not because his elders will assist him to learn the art, but because his organism is prepared from birth, or even from the moment of conception, to take on all those expenditures of nervous energy and all those muscular adaptations that result in walking. To put it concisely, walking is an inherent, biological function of man.  Not so language. It is of course true that in a certain sense the individual is predestined to talk, but that is due entirely to the circumstance that he is born not merely in nature, but in the lap of a society that is certain, reasonably certain, to lead him to its traditions. Eliminate society and there is every reason to believe that he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],["title","Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#1)"],["body","learn to walk, if, indeed, he survives at all. But it is just as certain that he will never learn to talk, that is, to communicate ideas according to the traditional system of a particular society. Or, again, remove the new-born individual from the social environment into which he has come and transplant him to an utterly alien one. He will develop the art of walking in his new environment very much as he would have developed it in the old. But his speech will be completely at variance with the speech of his native environment. Walking, then, is a general human activity that varies only within circumscribed limits as we pass from individual to individual. Its variability is involuntary and purposeless. Speech is a human activity that varies without assignable limit as we pass from social group to social group, because it is a purely historical heritage of the group, the product of long-continued social usage. It varies as all creative effort varies--not as consciously, perhaps, but none the less as truly as do the religions, the beliefs, the customs, and the arts of different peoples. Walking is an organic, an instinctive, function (not, of course, itself an instinct); speech is a non-instinctive, acquired, \"cultural\" function.  There is one fact that has frequently tended to prevent the recognition of language as a merely conventional system of sound symbols, that has seduced the popular mind into attributing to it an instinctive basis that it does not really possess. This is the well-known observation that under the stress of emotion, say of a sudden twinge of pain or of unbridled joy, we do involuntarily give utterance to sounds that the hearer interprets as indicative of the emotion itself. But there is all the difference in the world between such involuntary expression of feeling and the normal type of communication of ideas that is speech. The former kind of utterance is indeed instinctive, but it is non-symbolic; in other words, the sound of pain or the sound of joy does not, as such, indicate the emotion, it does not stand aloof, as it were, and announce that such and such an emotion is being felt. What it does is to serve as a more or less automatic overflow of the emotional energy; in a sense, it is part and parcel of the emotion itself. Moreover, such instinctive cries hardly constitute communication in any strict sense. They are not addressed to any one, they are merely overheard, if heard at all, as the bark of a dog, the sound of approaching footsteps, or the rustling of the wind is heard. If they convey certain ideas to the hearer, it is only in the very general sense in which any and every sound or even any phenomenon in our environment may be said to convey an idea to the perceiving mind. If the involuntary cry of pain which is conventionally represented by \"Oh!\" be looked upon as a true speech symbol equivalent to some such idea as \"I am in great pain,\" it is just as allowable to interpret the appearance of clouds as an equivalent symbol that carries the definite message \"It is likely to rain.\" A definition of language, however, that is so extended as to cover every type of inference becomes utterly meaningless.  The mistake must not be made of identifying our conventional interjections (our oh! and ah! and sh!) with the instinctive cries themselves. These interjections are merely conventional fixations of the natural sounds. They therefore differ widely in various languages in accordance with the specific phonetic genius of each of these. As such they may be considered an integral portion of speech, in the properly cultural sense of the term, being no more identical with the instinctive cries themselves than such words as \"cuckoo\" and \"kill-deer\" are identical with the cries of the birds they denote or than Rossini's treatment of a storm in the overture to \"William Tell\" is in fact a storm. In other words, the interjections and sound-imitative words of normal speech are related to their natural prototypes as is art, a purely social or cultural thing, to nature. It may be objected that, though the interjections differ somewhat as we pass from language to language, they do nevertheless offer striking family resemblances and may therefore be looked upon as having grown up out of a common instinctive base. But their case is nowise different from that, say, of the varying national modes of pictorial representation. A Japanese picture of a hill both differs from and resembles a typical modern European painting of the same kind of hill. Both are suggested by and both \"imitate\" the same natural feature. Neither the one nor the other is the same thing as, or, in any intelligible sense, a direct outgrowth of, this natural feature. The two modes of representation are not identical because they proceed from differing historical traditions, are executed with differing pictorial techniques. The interjections of Japanese and English are, just so, suggested by a common natural prototype, the instinctive cries, and are thus unavoidably suggestive of each other. They differ, now greatly, now but little, because they are builded out of historically diverse materials or techniques, the respective linguistic traditions, phonetic systems, speech habits of the two peoples. Yet the instinctive cries as such are practically identical for all humanity, just as the human skeleton or nervous system is to all intents and purposes a \"fixed,\" that is, an only slightly and \"accidentally\" variable, feature of man's organism.  Interjections are among the least important of speech elements. Their discussion is valuable mainly because it can be shown that even they, avowedly the nearest of all language sounds to instinctive utterance, are only superficially of an instinctive nature. Were it therefore possible to demonstrate that the whole of language is traceable, in its ultimate historical and psychological foundations, to the interjections, it would still not follow that language is an instinctive activity. But, as a matter of fact, all attempts so to explain the origin of speech have been fruitless. There is no tangible evidence, historical or otherwise, tending to show that the mass of speech elements and speech processes has evolved out of the interjections. These are a very small and functionally insignificant proportion of the vocabulary of language; at no time and in no linguistic province that we have record of do we see a noticeable tendency towards their elaboration into the primary warp and woof of language. They are never more, at best, than a decorative edging to the ample, complex fabric.  What applies to the interjections applies with even greater force to the sound-imitative words. Such words as \"whippoorwill,\" \"to mew,\" \"to caw\" are in no sense natural sounds that man has instinctively or automatically reproduced. They are just as truly creations of the human mind, flights of the human fancy, as anything else in language. They do not directly grow out of nature, they are suggested by it and play with it. Hence the onomatopoetic theory of the origin of speech, the theory that would explain all speech as a gradual evolution from sounds of an imitative character, really brings us no nearer to the instinctive level than is language as we know it to-day. As to the theory itself, it is scarcely more credible than its interjectional counterpart. It is true that a number of words which we do not now feel to have a sound-imitative value can be shown to have once had a phonetic form that strongly suggests their origin as imitations of natural sounds. Such is the English word \"to laugh.\" For all that, it is quite impossible to show, nor does it seem intrinsically reasonable to suppose, that more than a negligible proportion of the elements of speech or anything at all of its formal apparatus is derivable from an onomatopoetic source. However much we may be disposed on general principles to assign a fundamental importance in the languages of primitive peoples to the imitation of natural sounds, the actual fact of the matter is that these languages show no particular preference for imitative words. Among the most primitive peoples of aboriginal America, the Athabaskan tribes of the Mackenzie River speak languages in which such words seem to be nearly or entirely absent, while they are used freely enough in languages as sophisticated as English and German. Such an instance shows how little the essential nature of speech is concerned with the mere imitation of things.  The way is now cleared for a serviceable definition of language. Language is a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions, and desires by means of a system of voluntarily produced symbols. These symbols are, in the first instance, auditory and they are produced by the so-called \"organs of speech.\" There is no discernible instinctive basis in human speech as such, however much instinctive expressions and the natural environment may serve as a stimulus for the development of certain elements of speech, however much instinctive tendencies, motor and other, may give a predetermined range or mold to linguistic expression. Such human or animal communication, if \"communication\" it may be called, as is brought about by involuntary, instinctive cries is not, in our sense, language at all.  I have just referred to the \"organs of speech,\" and it would seem at first blush that this is tantamount to an admission that speech itself is an instinctive, biologically predetermined activity. We must not be misled by the mere term. There are, properly speaking, no organs of speech; there are only organs that are incidentally useful in the production of speech sounds. The lungs, the larynx, the palate, the nose, the tongue, the teeth, and the lips, are all so utilized, but they are no more to be thought of as primary organs of speech than are the fingers to be considered as essentially organs of piano-playing or the knees as organs of prayer."]]]
