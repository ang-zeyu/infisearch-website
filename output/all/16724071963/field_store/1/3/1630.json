He returned in the worst possible.  'Twa bob clean wasted,' he grunted, squatting down by Macgregor's bed.  'I wish to ---- I had flung it in the Clyde when we was crossin' the brig.'  'What gaed wrang?' inquired Macgregor, rubbing his eyes.  'Did she no like yer treat?'  'I'll warrant she did!'  'What did ye buy her wi' the twa bob?'  Willie sniffed at his recollections.  'Like a ---- goat,' said he, 'I askit her what she wud like best for twa bob, me thinkin' naterally she wud say a feed to stairt wi'.  I was ready for a feed masel'.  But she squeezed ma airm an' shoved her big face intil mines, an' said she wud like a sooveneer best.  To blazes wi' sooveneers!  An' she dragged me awa' to a shop, an' I had to buy her a silly-like wee tie that cost me eichteen-pence-ha'penny; an' then she wanted a lang ride on the caur, an' that burst fivepence; an' she nabbed the remainin' bawbee for a keepsake.'  The reciter paused as if from exhaustion.  'Hurry up!' said Macgregor encouragingly.  'What did she gi'e you?'  'A ---- kiss up a ---- close!  To pot wi' kissin'!  An' then she said she was afraid her mither wud be waitin' the ham an' egg supper for her, so she wud need to run, an' she was vexed she couldna meet me again because she had been hearin' I was a terrible bad character.  An' then, takin' advantage o' ma surprise, she done a bunk. . . .  An' if ever I ha'e ony mair truck wi' weemen, may I be ----'  'She wasna as saft as I fancied she was,' remarked Macgregor in an uncertain voice.  'So ye wud jist gang to yer aunt's for yer supper, efter a'?'  'Ay!  An' the auld cat was oot at a prayer-meetin'.  I ha'ena had a bite in ma mooth since denner-time.  Ha'e ye onything o' yer uncle's handy?'  'I can gi'e ye a wee tin o' corned beef, Wullie.  Ye ken whaur to find it.'  'Least ye can dae,' Willie growled.  'Thenk Goad it was your money!'  'I'm thinkin' I've got guid value.'  'What?'  'Guid nicht!'  And stuffing some blanket into his mouth, Macgregor rolled over and quaked with imprisoned mirth.     X  THE ALARM  It came, as Christina would have expressed it in her early days, like a 'blot from the blue.'  On a certain fine morning, while battalion drill was in progress, a mounted officer dashed upon the scene and was forthwith engaged in earnest conversation with the colonel.  The news was evidently urgent, and it was received with an obvious gravity.  A thrill ran through the ranks; you would have fancied you heard breaths of anticipation.  A minute later the companies were making for camp at the double. Arrived there they were instructed to repair to billets and, with all speed, pack up.  And presently ammunition was being served out, a hundred rounds to each man; and, later, 'iron' rations.  'We're awa' noo!' gasped Macgregor, recovering forcibly from Willie's greedy clutch a pair of socks knitted by Christina.  'Ay, we're awa'; an' I'll bet ye we're for Flanders,' said Willie, no less excited.  'Dardanelles!' shouted Macgregor, above the din that filled the billet.  'Flanders!' yelled Willie, wildly, and started to dance--unfortunately upon a thin piece of soap.  'Dardanelles!' Macgregor repeated as he gave his friend a hand up.  'Oh ----!' groaned Willie, rubbing the back of his head.  'But what'll ye bet?'  'What ha'e ye got?'  'I'll bet ye thruppence--the thruppence ye lent me the day afore yesterday.'  'Done!  If ye win, we'll be quits; if ye loss----'  'Na, na!  If I win, ye'll ha'e to pay me----'  'Ach, I've nae time to listen to ye.  I've twa letters to write.'  'Letters!  What aboot the bet?'  'Awa' an' chase yersel'! Are ye no gaun to drap a line to yer aunt?'  'No dashed likely!  She's never sent the postal order I asked her for.  If I had got it, I wud ha'e payed what I'm owin' ye, Macgreegor.  By heavens, I wud!  I'll tak' ma oath I----'  'Aweel, never heed aboot that,' Macgregor said, soothingly.  'Send her a post caird an' let me get peace for three meenutes.'  'Ye canna get peace in this,' said Willie, with a glance round the tumultuous billet.  'I can--if ye haud yer silly tongue.' Macgregor thereupon got his pad and envelopes (a gift from Miss Tod), squatted on his bed, and proceeded to gnaw his pencil.  The voice of the sergeant was heard ordering the men to hurry up.  'I'll tell ye what I'll dae,' said Willie, sitting down at his friend's elbow.  'I'll bet ye a' I owe ye to a bob it's Flanders. Ye see, I'll maybe get shot, an' I dinna want to dee in debt.  An' I'll send the auld cat a caird wi' something nice on it, to please ye . . . .  Eh?'  'Aw, onything ye like, but for ony sake clay up!  Shift!' cried the distracted Macgregor.  'Weel gi'e's a fag . . . .  an' a match,' said Willie.  He received them in his face, but merely grinned as he languidly removed himself.  The two scrawls so hastily and under such difficulties produced by Macgregor are sacred.  He would never write anything more boyish and loving, nor yet more manly and brave, than those 'few lines' to his mother and sweetheart.  There was no time left for posting them when the order came to fall in, but he anticipated an opportunity at one of the stations on the journey south.  Out in the sunshine stood the hundreds of lads whose training had been so brief that some carried ammunition for the first time. There were few grave faces, though possibly some of the many grins were more reflected than original.  Yet there was a fine general air of eagerness, and at the word 'attention' the varied expressions gave place to one of determination.  Boom! boom! boom! . . .  Boom! boom!  boom!  Dirl and skirl; skirl and dirl!  So to the heart-lifting, hell-raising music of pipes and drums they marched down to the railway.  At the station it seemed as though they had been expected to break all records in military entraining.  There was terrific haste and occasional confusion, the latter at the loading of the vans.  The enthusiasm was equalled only by the perspiration.  But at last everything and nearly everybody was aboard, and the rumour went along that they had actually broken such and such a battalion's record.  Private William Thomson, however, had already started his inevitable grumbling.  There were eight in the compartment, and he had stupidly omitted to secure a corner seat.  'I'll bet ye I'm a corp afore we get to Dover,' he bleated.  'That's as near as ever ye'll be to bein' a corporal,' remarked the cheerful Jake.  'But hoo d'ye ken it'll be Dover?'  'I'll bet ye ---- Na!  I'll no tak' on ony mair wagers.  I've a tremenjous bet on wi' this yin'--indicating Macgregor--'every dashed penny I possess--that we're boun' for Flanders.  He says the Dardanelles.'  All excepting Macgregor fell to debating the question.  He had just remembered something he had forgotten to say to Christina; also, he was going away without the ring she was to have given him.  He was not sorry he was going, but he felt sad. . . .  The debate waxed furious.  'I tell ye,' bawled Willie, 'we're for Flanders!  The Ninth's been there since the----'  A sudden silence!  What the ---- was that?  Surely not--ay, it was!--an order to detrain!  And soon the whisper went round that they were not bound for anywhere--unless the ---- old camp.  The morning's alarm and all that followed had been merely by way of practice.  At such a time different men have different feelings, or, at least, different ways of expressing them.  Jake laughed philosophically and appeared to dismiss the whole affair.  Willie swore with a curious and seemingly unnecessary bitterness, at frequent intervals, for the next hour or so.  Macgregor remained in a semi-stunned condition of mind until the opportunity came for making a little private bonfire of the two letters; after which melancholy operation he straightway recovered his usual good spirits.  'Never heed, Wullie,' he said, later; 'we'll get oor chance yet.'  Willie exploded.  'What for did ye get me to mak' sic a ---- cod o' masel'?'  'Cod o' yersel'?  Me?'  'Ay, you!--gettin' me to send a caird to ma ---- aunt!  What for did ye dae it?'  Macgregor stared.  'But ye didna post it,' he began.  'Ay, but I did.  I gi'ed it to a man at the station.'  'Oh! . . .  Weel, ye'll just ha'e to send her anither.'  'That'll no mak' me less o' a cod.'  'What way?  What did ye write on the caird?'  Willie hesitated, muttered a few curses, and said slowly yet savagely:--  '\"Off to Flanders, wi'--wi' kind love\"--_oh, dammit_!'     XI  AN INVITATION  After considering the matter at intervals for about thirty years, Miss Tod, Christina's employer, decided to take a short change of air by accepting the long-standing invitation of an old and aged friend who dwelt in the country.  The hour of departure arriving, she shed tears, expressed the fear that she was going to her death, embraced the girl, handed her the keys of the premises, and requested her to make any use she pleased of the rather stuffy living-room behind the shop.  Christina had no notion of accepting the offer until, an hour or two later, the idea struck her that it would be fun to give a little tea party for Macgregor and Willie Thomson.  She knew Willie but slightly, but though her respect was no greater than her knowledge, she had kept a softish corner for him since the day, two years ago, when he had gone out of his way to inform her, impudently enough, that his friend Macgregor was not courting a certain rather bold and attractive damsel called Jessie Mary.  So she wrote forthwith to Macgregor and enclosed the following invitation, in her neatest writing, for his friend:--    Miss Christina Baldwin requests   the unspeakable pleasure of   Pte. William Thomson's company      to T. T. Tea    on the first evening possible   (Sunday excepted) at 5.30   precisely till 7 prompt.      Menu.    Sandwiches, Sausage Rolls,   Hot Cookies, Cream Dittos,   Macaroons, Cheesecakes,   Currant Cakes, Jam"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12269"],["title","Wee Macgreegor Enlists (#7)"],["body","fs,   Imperial (_nee_ German) Biscuits,     And   NO BREAD.   God Save the King!    P.S.--Miss C. B. will expect   Pte. W. T. to Ask a Blessing.   It took time and patience on Macgregor's part to persuade his friend that the missive was not a 'cod'; but once convinced of its genuineness, Willie took the business seriously.  He swore, however, to have nothing to do with the matter of the P.S. Nevertheless, in moments of solitude, his lips might have been observed to move diligently, and it is possible that he was mentally rehearsing 'For what we are about to receive, etc.'  His written acceptance was a model in its way.  'Coming with thanks,--Yours truly, W. THOMSON.'   By the same post he wrote to his aunt--for cash; but her reply consisting of a tract headed with a picture of a young man in the remnants of a bath towel dining in a pig-sty, he was compelled once more to appeal to Macgregor, who fortunately happened to be fairly flush.  He expended the borrowed shilling on a cane and a packet of Breath Perfumers for himself, and for Christina a box of toffee which, being anhungered while on sentry duty the same night, he speedily devoured with more relish than regret.  Unless we reckon evenings spent in Macgregor's home in the small boy period, and a funeral or two, Willie's experience of tea parties was nil.  Despite his frequently expressed contempt for such 'footerin' affairs,' he was secretly flattered by Christina's invitation.  At the same time, he suffered considerable anguish of mind on account of his ignorance of the 'fancy behaviour' which he deemed indispensable in the presence of a hostess whom he considered 'awfu' genteel.'  With reluctance, but in sheer desperation, he applied to his seldom-failing friend.  'What the blazes,' he began with affected unconcern, 'dae ye dae at a tea pairty?'  'Eat an' jaw,' came the succinct reply.  'But what dae ye jaw aboot?'  'Onything ye like--as long as ye leave oot the bad language.'  'I doobt I'll no ha'e muckle to say,' sighed Willie.  'She'll want to hear aboot the camp an' so on,' Macgregor said, by way of encouragement.  'But that'll be piper's news to her.  You've tell't her----'  'I've never had the time.'  Willie gasped.  'What the ---- dae you an' her jaw aboot?'  'Nane o' your business!'  'Haw, haw!' laughed Willie, mirthlessly.  'My! but ye're a spoony deevil!--nae offence intendit.'  The apology was made hastily owing to a sudden change in Macgregor's expression and colour.  Macgregor lit a cigarette and returned his well-stocked aluminium case to his pocket.  The silence was broken by Willie.  'Savin' up?'  'Ay.'  'It's a dashed bad habit, Macgreegor.  Dinna let it grow on ye.  If naebody saved up, everybody wud be weel aff. . . .  Aweel, what maun be maun be.'  And, groaning, Private Thomson drew forth a packet which his friend had 'stood' him the previous day. 'Regairdin' this tea pairty,' he resumed, 'are ye supposed to eat a' ye can an' leave what ye canna--if there's onything to leave?'  'She'll expect ye to eat a' ye can.'  'It's easy seen she doesna ken me.'  'Oh, she'll be prepared for the warst, Wullie,' said Macgregor, his good-humour returned.  'I can shift a bit masel' when I'm in form.'  Whereat Willie's countenance was illuminated by a happy thought. 'I'll bet ye a tanner I'll shift mair nor you!'  Macgregor laughed and shook his head.  'If you an' me was gaun oor lane to restewrant, I wud tak' ye on; but----'  'Aw, ye mean it wudna be the thing a tea pairty?'  'Hardly.'  'Weel, weel,' said Willie, with sorry resignation, 'honest money's ill to earn.  It wud ha'e been a snip for me.  Ha'e ye a match? 'Having lit up: 'Tell us what else I maunna dae at the pairty.'  Macgregor scratched his head.  'If it had been a denner pairty,' he said slowly, thinking doubtless of Aunt Purdie's, 'I could ha'e gi'ed ye a queer list; but ye canna gang faur wrang at a tea pairty.'  'I dinna want to gang an inch wrang.'  'Weel, then, for instance, some folk objec's to a chap sookin' his tea frae his saucer----'  'I'll note that.  Fire awa'!'  'An' if a cream cookie bursts----'  'Dae they burst whiles?'  'Up yer sleeve, as a rule,' said Macgregor very solemnly.  'Guid Goad!  I'll pass the cream cookies.'  'But they're awfu' tasty.'  'Are they? . . .  Weel, what dae ye dae if it bursts?'  'Never let bug.'  'Ay, but--but what aboot the cream?'  'Best cairry an extra hanky an' plug yer sleeve wi' it.'  After a dismal pause, Willie inquired: 'Could ye no get her to leave the cream cookies oot o' her programme, Macgreegor?'  Macgregor looked dubious.  'She's gey saft on them hersel', an' she micht be offendit if we refused them.  Of course they dinna scoot up the sleeve every time.'  'Oh!'--more hopefully.  'Whiles they explode doon the waistcoat--I mean tunic.'  'That's enough!' wailed Willie.  'If the Clyde was handy, I wud gang an' droon masel'!'  On the third day following, they obtained late passes.  Willie's uneasiness was considerable, yet so was his vanity.  He affected an absurdly devil-may-care deportment which so stirred Macgregor's sense of pity that he had thoughts of taking back what he had said about the cream cookies.  But at the last moment his bootlace snapped. . . .  Willie's toilet was the most careful he had ever made, and included an application of exceeding fragrant pomade pilfered from his corporal's supply and laid on thickly enough to stop a leak. Finally, having armed himself with his new cane and put seven breath perfumers and a cigarette in his mouth, he approached the stooping Macgregor and declared himself ready for the road.  'What's that atrocious smell?' demanded Macgregor, with unwonted crustiness.  For once in his life Willie had no answer at hand, and for once he blushed.     XII  A TEA-PARTY  Christina was serving a customer when her two guests entered the shop.  Unembarrassed she beamed on both and signed to Macgregor to go 'right in.' So Macgregor conducted his friend, who during the journey had betrayed increasing indications of 'funk,' into the absent owner's living-room, which Christina had contrived to make brighter looking than for many a year.  At the sight of the laden table Willie took fright and declared his intention of doing an immediate 'slope.'  'Ye didna tell me,' he complained, 'there was to be a big compn'y.'  Macgregor grabbed him by the arm.  'Keep yer hair on, Wullie. There'll be naebody but the three o' us.  There's nae scrimp aboot Christina,' he added with pride.  'I believe ye!' responded the reassured guest.  'Gor, I never seen as much pastries in a' ma born days--no but what I'm ready to dae ma bit.'  Just then Christina entered, remarking:  'It's an awfu' job tryin' to sell what a person doesna want to a person that wants what ye ha'ena got; but I done it this time. Evenin', Mac.  Mr. Thomson, I am delighted to meet ye.'  'Aw,' murmured Willie helplessly.  'Dinna terrify him,' Macgregor whispered.  'Sorry,' she said with quick compunction.  'I'm gled to see ye, Wullie.  Sit doon an' feel at hame.  The kettle's jist at the bile. See, tak' Miss Tod's chair.  She'll like to think that a sojer sat in it.  She'll never ha'e been as near to a man.  I was askin' her the ither nicht if she had ever had a lad.  The answer was in the negative.'  'Maybe,' Macgregor suggested, 'she didna like to tell ye the truth.'  Christina smiled gently, saying, 'Ye've a lot to learn aboot us females, Mac.'  'By Jings, ye're richt there!' Willie exploded, and immediately subsided in confusion.  'Ay,' she agreed placidly; 'he's no a connoisseur like you, Wullie. Talkin' o' females, hoo's yer aunt keepin'?'  'Rotten--at least she was fine the last time I seen her ugly.'  'The decay seems to ha'e been rapid.  But, seriously, it's a peety ye canna love yer aunt better----'  Love her! Oh, help!'  The 'p' was sounded just in time, and Willie glanced at Macgregor to see whether he had noticed the stumble.  Macgregor, however, had forgotten Willie--unless, perhaps to wish him a hundred miles away.  Christina was wearing a new white blouse which showed a little bit of her neck, with a bow of her favourite scarlet at the opening.  'D'ye ken what ma aunt done to me the ither day?' Willie proceeded, craving for sympathy.  'I was terrible hard up, an' I wrote her a nice letter on a caird wi' a view o' Glesca Cathedral on it, includin' the graveyaird--cost me a penny; an' what dae ye think she sent me back?  A bl--oomin' trac'!'  At that moment the kettle boiled, and Christina, exclaiming 'Oh, mercy!' sprang to the hearth.  Over her shoulder she said in a voice that wavered slightly:  'That was hard cheese, Wullie, but ye maun send her a cheerier-like caird next time.  I'll stand ye an optimistic specimen afore ye leave the shop.'  'Thenk ye!  A--of course we'll ha'e to draw the line at picturs o' folk dookin' in the sad sea waves or canoodlin' on the shore----'  Christina, teapot in one hand, kettle in the other, burst out laughing.  'Mind ye dinna burn yersel'!' cried Macgregor, starting into life.  'Haud the kettle, Mac,' said she.  'It's no fair o' Wullie to be sae funny.'  'I wasna funny!' Willie protested.  'It's yer notion o' the optimistic that tickled me,' she said. 'Pour, Mac; I'm steady noo.  But ye're quite richt, Wullie.  We canna be ower discreet when cash is involved.  I'll get some high-class cairds for ye to inspect till the tea's infused.'  Macgregor would dearly have liked to follow her into the shop.  'She's a clinker,' observed Willie under his breath.  'Eh?'  'Naething.'  Which was all the conversation during the absence of the hostess.  She returned with a tray.  Willie was tempted by a card with the 'V.C.' emblazoned on it, but feared it would look 'swanky' on his part.  Though hampered by the adverse criticisms of Macgregor, who naturally wanted to hold Christina's hand under cover of the table as long as possible, he succeeded at last in choosing one entitled 'The Soldier's Return,' depicting a bronzed"]]]
