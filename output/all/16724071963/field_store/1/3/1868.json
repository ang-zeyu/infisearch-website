Come on!\"  Stubbs drew back.  \"We'll all be killed!\" he exclaimed.  \"Never mind that,\" said Hal impatiently. \"Are you coming with me or are you going to stay here?\"  \"Alone?\"  \"Yes, alone.\"  \"Oh, I'll go,\" said Stubbs mournfully, \"but I know I'll never get back to America alive. The _New York Gazette_ is about to lose its best man.\"  Still mumbling to himself he followed Hal.  The British under Hal and Captain Anderson broke from their shelter and crossed the road to the enemy's side on a dead run, their smoking rifles dealing out death on every hand as they advanced.  When Hal's men had attacked, Chester found it unnecessary to retreat, as he had figured upon doing, and the rain of hail continued to pour upon the enemy from all sides.  The British gradually closed on the enemy, fewer now by half than they had been a few moments ago, until the circle had narrowed to within a few yards of the enemy.  In spite of the semi-darkness the aim of the British cavalrymen had been remarkable, and wherever and whenever a German showed himself, in nine cases out of ten he fell to rise no more. The losses of the British had been heavy, but not so great as those of the foe.  Now, at a command from Hal, the fire of the British ceased. Then the lad, raising his voice to its highest pitch, shouted:  \"Surrender!\"     CHAPTER VIII.  THE MISSION SUCCESSFUL.   \"Never!\" came back the reply of the German officer in command.  Hal, who had stepped slightly from the shelter of a big tree, jumped back quickly as a bullet lifted his cap from his head.  \"Too bad,\" he said quietly. \"I would have avoided further loss of life. However, if they will have it, give it to them, men.\"  The fight had raged, at intervals, all during the night. Now the first faint signs of dawn appeared and a little while later it became light.  From his shelter Hal took in the situation about him. Here and there dead bodies strewed the woods, Germans and British alike. Wounded men also lay upon the ground.  Hal now decided that the battle had lasted long enough. With a cry to his men he dashed suddenly forward, the troopers following close behind. Chester, at his end of the field, perceiving this movement, also led his handful of men forward.  Some fell, as they dashed into the very face of the German fire, but the bulk of the British reached their goal, where, outnumbering the Germans now, they soon disposed of them. When all were down but a mere handful, a German lieutenant, the sole surviving officer, threw down his revolver and raised his hands in token of surrender.  Hal drew a great breath of pure relief and advanced. He was within ten feet of the German officer, when the latter suddenly sprang forward. His sword again leaped forth, and he made a furious thrust at the lad.  Although surprised at this attack, Hal was not caught completely off his guard. With a single movement his own sword leaped from its scabbard and parried the thrust of the German officer.  Chester took a sudden step forward to interfere, but Hal, perceiving his friend's move out of the corner of his eye, cried out:  \"Stand back, Chester. I'll dispose of this cowardly dog alone.\"  But the German was an accomplished swordsman, which Hal was not. True, the lad had had some experience with the sword and had already fought one successful duel; but, in spite of this, he was no match for the more experienced German officer.  The German pressed the lad hard and, secure in the knowledge that he would not be interfered with, he tried his best to run the lad through. Fortunately, however, the lad's blade met his at every thrust. Tiring of this, the German took a step backward, and, raising his sword, grasped it by the point and hurled it at Hal.  The lad escaped being impaled only by a quick spring aside. The German turned to flee, and as he did so, bumped squarely into Anthony Stubbs, who accidentally barred his path at that moment. The two collided with a crash, and were soon rolling about on the ground.  To attack the German officer had been farthest from Stubbs's mind; but the German officer, believing that the little American had barred his path purposely, struck out at him heavily. More by good fortune than anything else, Stubbs evaded the blow by rolling quickly over, and as he did so his right hand accidentally descended upon the German's face.  Stubbs was as greatly surprised as was his opponent, but the latter became furiously angry.  \"Hit me, will you!\" he cried.  \"I didn't do it on purpose!\" exclaimed Stubbs, greatly alarmed by the anger of the German.  Quickly he rolled over again, once more escaping by a hair's breadth a heavy blow of the German's fist. Then he arose quickly and started to run; but the German was close behind him.  Realizing that he could not possibly outrun his opponent, Stubbs turned suddenly and dived at the German's legs, crying out as he did so:  \"Help! Help! Anthony, you will be killed.\"  His sudden maneuver had taken the German by surprise, and again the two rolled over and over upon the ground in a tangled heap.  In some unaccountable manner Stubbs was the first to extricate himself, and, absolutely certain that his adversary meant to kill him, he rolled over quickly and sat upon his enemy's breast.  In vain did the German attempt to shake himself free. Stubbs, still crying for help and moaning to himself, was as immovable as the Rock of Gibraltar.  Hal, Chester, Captain Anderson and the British cavalrymen had derived great amusement from this scene, and, as Hal had realized that the German, now unarmed, could not do much harm to the war correspondent, he had let the two fight it out alone.  Now that Stubbs had been returned the victor, greatly to the surprise of all, Hal advanced and induced the little American to relinquish his seat. This the latter did, though not without some trepidation--fearing that the German would attack him again as soon as he could arise--and, when he finally did get upon his feet, he put a respectable distance between himself and his late opponent.  \"You fellows are bent on getting me killed,\" he said, turning to Chester with a frown. \"You always help each other, but whenever I am in trouble you leave me to fight it out alone.\"  \"And you always acquit yourself admirably,\" said Chester, forbearing to smile.  \"Well, I'll admit that,\" returned Stubbs; \"but some time I am bound to get the worst of it. Then I suppose you'll laugh.\"  By this time Hal had the German officer securely bound, and at his command the rest of the enemy still upon their feet also were tied up. Then, with their prisoners in the center, the British once more set out upon their march to the British lines, Stubbs trailing along behind.  Before noon they came within sight of the first British outposts, and soon had passed to safety. Here they procured horses, and made all haste back toward their own division, where they arrived several hours later.  When those of the British troop who had gone forth with the two lads returned to their own regiment, and the lads, with Captain Anderson, took their departure, they raised three lusty cheers for each of the officers in farewell.  The three, accompanied by Stubbs, immediately made their way to the headquarters of General French. Here Hal, Chester and Captain Anderson were at once admitted, but Stubbs was forced to remain without, being told that Sir John French had no time to waste upon war correspondents.  \"Well, what do you think of that?\" Stubbs ejaculated. \"A newspaper man refused admittance! I never heard of such a thing before.\"  Nevertheless he was forced to cool his heels on the outside until his newly found friends should come out, and this is what he proceeded to do.  General French greeted the two lads with a smile.  \"Back so soon?\" he exclaimed. \"I hardly expected you before to-morrow. And was your mission a success?\"  \"Well, General,\" replied Hal, \"we didn't go as far as we could have gone. We were fortunate enough to come upon Captain Anderson, who had just escaped from the Germans, and knows more of the situation there than we could possibly have learned. We figured that it was not necessary to sacrifice lives foolishly.\"  \"You did exactly right,\" replied General French.  He turned to Captain Anderson. \"Are the Germans contemplating any new move in the north that you know of?\" he asked.  \"They are not, sir,\" was the reply. \"I can say that positively. I heard plans while I was in the hospital. The German forces in the west have been drawn upon somewhat heavily to reÃ«nforce their troops in the eastern theater of war.\"  \"Do you believe that a new offensive would drive them back?\"  \"That's a hard question, sir. They are strongly intrenched all along the line, and I should say that unless the offensive were to be pushed to the limit, with some object in view besides merely advancing a mile or two, it would be a needless sacrifice.\"  General French looked Captain Anderson full in the eye.  \"That, sir,\" he said gravely, \"is my idea exactly, which is the reason we have not assumed the offensive long before this. I have been censured for my policy more than once; but I would not sacrifice lives needlessly, and would wait until Lord Kitchener has furnished me with sufficient men before ordering a concerted advance.\"  Captain Anderson did not reply to this statement, for he knew that no answer was expected. He was, nevertheless, honored by the general's confidence, and pleased to know that his ideas found favor with his commander.  \"You gentlemen had all better get a little rest,\" said General French.  He turned to his desk, littered with maps and papers, signifying that the interview was ended. The three officers drew themselves up to attention, saluted, and left the tent.  Outside they were joined by Anthony Stubbs, who poured into their ears his tale of woe at being refused admission to the general's quarters.  \"And where am I to go, now?\" he asked.  \"Where do you want to go?\" asked Hal.  \"Why,\" was the reply, \"I "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12571"],["title","The Boy Allies in the Trenches; Or, Midst Shot and Shell Along the Aisne (#8)"],["body","to go where I can get some news for my paper. I want big news--something that the other papers will not get.\"  \"But,\" said Hal, \"you know that, even if you got it, you could not send it to your paper. The censor would see to that.\"  \"Oh, I know that,\" replied Stubbs, \"but if I can get it I'll get it out. You leave that to me.\"  \"Well, Mr. Stubbs,\" said Hal, \"I don't know where you can get it right now, but for to-night I ask you to share our tent. You may fare forth on your quest in the morning.\"  Mr. Stubbs made a profound bow.  \"I thank you,\" he replied, \"and I shall do myself that honor.\"  Hal turned to Captain Anderson.  \"And you, too, Captain,\" he said, \"I hope you will stay the night with us. You can look up your regiment in the morning.\"  Captain Anderson replied that he would be happy to accept this invitation, and the four immediately went to the quarters provided for the two lads when they had returned to the army from the air flight from Russia.  Here, tired out and almost exhausted, they turned in immediately--in spite of the fact that the sun had not yet sunk below the horizon--and soon all lay snug and comfortable in the arms of Morpheus.     CHAPTER IX.  OFF TO THE SOUTH.   The following morning Captain Anderson bade the boys good-by and set out to find his own regiment. Stubbs also said good-by, announcing that he must be moving in his search for news. He had been given credentials days before and, representing as he did one of the greatest newspapers in the world, was one of the few correspondents to have the freedom of the allied lines.  Hal and Chester idled about the greater part of the day. There had been a lull in the fighting, and, although they had reported to General French, no duties had been assigned them; but along in the afternoon they were again summoned to headquarters.  \"I have here,\" said General French, placing a document in Hal's hand, \"a communication that must be placed in the hands of General Joffre with all possible dispatch. I have selected you to deliver it. General Joffre has his headquarters near Soissons. You should have no difficulty in reaching him. Take an automobile and make haste.\"  The lads saluted and left the tent, actually disappointed that they had not been selected for some more strenuous work.  \"Anybody could carry this,\" said Hal.  \"There is certainly no danger,\" agreed Chester. \"All we have to do is to stay within our own lines.\"  Half an hour later found them speeding southward, well in the rear of the great battle line. Hal himself was at the wheel and Chester sat in the tonneau of the machine. Through Ypres, Douai and many smaller towns the huge car sped without a stop. At Roy they halted for a fresh supply of petrol, and immediately resumed their journey.  But the lads were not entirely familiar with the lay of the land, and this fact resulted in throwing them into great danger once more.  Just south of Roy the long battle line--which had previously stretched straight southward--swerved suddenly to the east. The lads turned with it all right, but too soon. Instead of going straight south to the banks of the river Aisne, as they should have done, they turned eastward some distance north of this river, and were in trouble before they realized it.  Neither lad thought anything of the fact that they were pushing straight through the mass of French troops in this region, and it was not until they had come into an isolated region--an opening between the two great armies--that Chester surmised there was something wrong. The desolate appearance of the land spelled suspicion to him, and, leaning forward in his seat, he shouted to Hal:  \"Slow down, quick!\"  Hal obeyed without question and then turned to his chum to ascertain the reason for this abrupt command.  \"We must have gone clear through our own lines,\" Chester explained. \"If we hadn't, certainly there would be troops about. I believe we must be right between the two armies.\"  \"I don't think so,\" replied Hal. \"There are probably more French troops ahead of us.\"  \"I am sure I'm right,\" persisted Chester.  \"Well, it's not worth while taking a chance,\" said Hal. \"We'll turn south here.\"  At a cross road he swerved toward the south again. But, although neither lad realized it then, they had penetrated right through the German lines where they had been thinnest and most greatly scattered. They were still north of the Aisne, and the main German line lay between them and the far shore, where the French were massed in strength. They could have turned west again at this point and probably have reached safety by the way they had come; but neither realized his danger, and so the big car sped south directly toward the enemy.  It was night now, and the machine was forced to travel more slowly, running along at a snail-like gait until the first signs of dawn appeared in the eastern sky. An hour later the lads made out in the distance a mass of troops. They were still too far away to make out plainly, but neither doubted that they were French.  But they were doomed to disappointment.  As the machine sped closer, Hal suddenly applied the brakes and uttered an exclamation of dismay.  \"What's the matter?\" demanded Chester.  \"Matter!\" echoed Hal. \"Why, we have run right into a nest of Germans!\"  It was only too true. The troops whom they were now approaching were the enemy, and both lads realized in an instant that they must be surrounded by Germans on all sides. In the darkness they had penetrated through the rear line, and now were in the very midst of their foes.  Hal thought quickly. So far they had not been perceived. Two men in civilian clothes were approaching afoot, and as they came up to them Hal crawled under the machine and began to tinker with it. The men came closer and stopped to watch.  Suddenly Hal crawled from under the car, and, as the men cried out in surprise at the sight of his British uniform, he covered both of them with a pair of revolvers.  \"Silence!\" he cried, \"or you are dead men.\" He spoke to Chester over his shoulder. \"We'll have to go straight though the line,\" he said, \"and we can't do it with these uniforms. We'll have to exchange with these fellows.\"  In vain did their prisoners protest. Hal kept the two covered while Chester stripped himself of his own garments and climbed into those one of the prisoners passed to him. Then Chester covered the men while Hal made a change and transferred the document given him by General French to the pocket of his new coat. Then they bound and gagged the two men and tumbled them into the ditch at the side of the road.  \"So far so good,\" said Hal. \"Now, if we simply act unconcerned, we should have no difficulty in going through the lines. It's when we make a dash for the other side that the trouble is likely to come; but we must chance that.\"  \"All right,\" said Chester, \"let's move.\"  They started off slowly down the road and within the hour were in the town of Caronne, held by the Germans, but a few miles from the northern bank of the river Aisne. Here they left the machine to avoid attracting unnecessary attention.  They lost no time, and made their way through the town as swiftly as possible. They walked along boldly, and near the outskirts, coming upon a little restaurant Chester suggested a cup of coffee and a sandwich. Hal assented and they entered the door.  They took seats at an improvised counter and soon were engaged in the pleasant occupation of satisfying their appetites. A German officer, who had been eating in the rear of the restaurant, passed them on his way out, and, as he did so, he cast a quick look at Chester, and turned back toward him.  \"Haven't I seen you some place before?\" he asked, tapping the lad on the shoulder.  The lad turned and glanced at him sharply, and his heart leaped into his throat. He recognized the officer in a moment. He was the man with whom Hal had fought in a farmhouse near LiÃ¨ge in the earlier days of the war, the man who, mistaking Chester for Hal, had spared the former's life when he was sentenced to death by a band of conspirators in Louvain, and from whom the lad had escaped in time to warn the Belgian commander of the plot to deliver the town into the hands of the Germans.  \"I don't seem to remember you,\" said Chester, replying to the German's question.  The officer looked at him long and searchingly. Chester returned the gaze without flinching, and finally the German, evidently satisfied that he had made a mistake, bowed and turned to leave. Chester drew a quick breath of relief as the officer stepped from the door.  \"Do you know who that was,\" he whispered to Hal, who, although he had said no word, had been greatly surprised by the conversation between his friend and the German officer.  \"No,\" he replied. \"Who is he?\"  \"That,\" replied Chester, \"is the German whom you disarmed in Edna Johnson's home and whose life you spared.\"  \"Is that so?\"  \"Yes; and it's lucky he didn't recognize us.\"  \"I should say it is. Well, let's be moving.\"  The two lads left the restaurant and started on their journey again. They had not gone a block, however, when they halted at a sudden hail from behind them. Turning suddenly they saw the German officer hurrying after them.  \"I can't get you off my mind,\" he said to Chester, as he came up. \"I am positive that I have seen you some place, but for the life of me I can't tell where.\"  \"Well, you have the advantage of me,\" replied the lad, his hand seeking his pocket and resting on the butt of one of his revolvers.  The two lads started to move on again, and at that moment the German explained:  \"I have it! You are the lad who invaded our secret council in Louvain!\"  Chester did not take the trouble to deny it, but as the German's hand went to his hip he said quietly:  \"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\"  His revolver gleamed in his hand as he spoke, and he took a step forward. The German moved back a pace, but he made no further move to draw his weapon.  \"Now that you have"]]]
