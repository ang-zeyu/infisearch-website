But when it is founded on nothing but money, I wouldn't give much for it.\"  \"Of course we all know that the higher classes are more refined--\"  \"Than printers' devils and vulgar apprentices, I suppose,\" put in Oscar, laughing,  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, if refinement consists in wearing kid gloves and stunning neckties, I suppose the higher classes, as you call them, are more refined.\"  \"Do you mean me?\" demanded Fletcher, who was noted for the character of his neckties.  \"Well, I can't say I don't.  I suppose you regard yourself as a representative of the higher classes, don't you?\"  \"To be sure I do,\" said Fletcher, complacently.  \"So I supposed.  Then you see I had a right to refer to you.  Now listen to my prediction.  Twenty-five years from now, the boy whom you look down upon as a vulgar apprentice will occupy a high position, and you will be glad to number him among your acquaintances.\"  \"Speak for yourself, Oscar,\" said Fletcher, scornfully.  \"I speak for both of us.\"  \"Then I say I hope I can command better associates than this friend of yours.\"  \"You may, but I doubt it.\"  \"You seem to be carried away by him,\" said Fitzgerald, pettishly.  \"I don't see anything very wonderful about him, except dirty hands.\"  \"Then you have seen more than I have.\"  \"Of course a fellow who meddles with printer's ink must have dirty hands.  Faugh!\" said Fletcher, turning up his nose.  At the same time he regarded complacently his own fingers, which he carefully kept aloof from anything that would soil or mar their aristocratic whiteness.  \"The fact is, Fitz,\" said Oscar, argumentatively, \"our upper ten, as we call them, spring from just such beginnings as my friend Harry Walton.  My own father commenced life in a printing office.  But, as you say, he occupies a high position at present.\"  \"Really!\" said Fletcher, a little taken aback, for he knew that Vincent's father ranked higher than his own.  \"I daresay your own ancestors were not always patricians.\"  Fletcher winced.  He knew well enough that his father commenced life as a boy in a country grocery, but in the mutations of fortune had risen to be the proprietor of a large dry-goods store on Washington Street.  None of the family cared to look back to the beginning of his career.  They overlooked the fact that it was creditable to him to have risen from the ranks, though the rise was only in wealth, for Mr. Fletcher was a purse-proud parvenu, who owed all the consideration he enjoyed to his commercial position.  Fitz liked to have it understood that he was of patrician lineage, and carefully ignored the little grocery, and certain country relations who occasionally paid a visit to their wealthy relatives, in spite of the rather frigid welcome they received.  \"Oh, I suppose there are exceptions,\" Fletcher admitted reluctantly. \"Your father was smart.\"  \"So is Harry Walton.  I know what he is aiming at, and I predict that he will be an influential editor some day.\"  \"Have you got your Greek lesson?\" asked Fletcher, abruptly, who did not relish the course the conversation had taken.  \"Yes.\"  \"Then I want you to translate a passage for me.  I couldn't make it out.\"  \"All right.\"  Half an hour later Fletcher left Vincent's room.  \"What a snob he is!\" thought Oscar.  And Oscar was right.     CHAPTER IX.  THE CLIONIAN SOCIETY.  On Thursday evening the main school of the Academy building was lighted up, and groups of boys, varying in age from thirteen to nineteen, were standing in different parts of the room.  These were members of the Clionian Society, whose weekly meeting was about to take place.  At eight o'clock precisely the President took his place at the teacher's desk, with the Secretary at his side, and rapped for order. The presiding officer was Alfred DeWitt, a member of the Senior Class, and now nearly ready for college.  The Secretary was a member of the same class, by name George Sanborn.  \"The Secretary will read the minutes of the last meeting,\" said the President, when order had been obtained.  George Sanborn rose and read his report, which was accepted.  \"Are any committees prepared to report?\" asked the President.  The Finance Committee reported through its chairman, recommending that the fee for admission be established at one dollar, and that each member be assessed twenty-five cents monthly.  \"Mr. President,\" said Fitzgerald Fletcher, rising to his feet, \"I would like to say a word in reference to this report.\"  \"Mr. Fletcher has the floor.\"  \"Then, Mr. President, I wish to say that I disagree with the Report of the Committee.  I think a dollar is altogether too small.  It ought to be at least three dollars, and I myself should prefer five dollars.  Again, sir, the Committee has recommended for the monthly assessment the ridiculously small sum of twenty-five cents.  I think it ought to be a dollar.\"  \"Mr. President, I should like to ask the gentleman his reason,\" said Henry Fairbanks, Chairman of the Finance Committee.  \"Why should we tax the members to such an extent, when the sums reported are sufficient to defray the ordinary expenses of the Society, and to leave a small surplus besides?\"  \"Mr. President,\" returned Fletcher, \"I will answer the gentleman.  We don't want to throw open the Society to every one that can raise a dollar.  We want to have an exclusive society.\"  \"Mr. President,\" said Oscar Vincent, rising, \"I should like to ask the gentleman for how many he is speaking.  He certainly is not speaking for me.  I don't want the Society to be exclusive.  There are not many who can afford to pay the exorbitant sums which he desires fixed for admission fee and for monthly assessments, and I for one am not willing to exclude any good fellow who desires to become one of us, but does not boast as heavy a purse as the gentleman who has just spoken.\"  These remarks of Oscar were greeted with applause, general enough to show that the opinions of nearly all were with him.  \"Mr. President,\" said Henry Fairbanks, \"though I am opposed to the gentleman's suggestion, (does he offer it as an amendment?) I have no possible objection to his individually paying the increased rates which he recommends, and I am sure the Treasurer will gladly receive them.\"  Laughter and applause greeted this hit, and Fletcher once more arose, somewhat vexed at the reception of his suggestion.  \"I don't choose--\" he commenced.  \"The gentleman will address the chair,\" interrupted the President.  \"Mr. President, I don't choose to pay more than the other members, though I can do it without inconvenience.  But, as I said, I don't believe in being too democratic.  I am not in favor of admitting anybody and everybody into the Society.\"  \"Mr. President,\" said James Hooper, \"I congratulate the gentleman on the flourishing state of his finances.  For my own part, I am not ashamed to say that I cannot afford to pay a dollar a month assessment, and, were it required, I should be obliged to offer my resignation.\"  \"So much the better,\" thought Fitzgerald, for, as Hooper was poor, and went coarsely clothed, he looked down upon him.  Fortunately for himself he did not give utterance to his thought.  \"Does Mr. Fletcher put his recommendation into the form of an amendment?\" asked, the President.  \"I do.\"  \"Be kind enough to state it, then.\"  Fletcher did so, but as no one seconded it, no action was of course taken.  \"Nominations for membership are now in order,\" said the President.  \"I should like to propose my friend Henry Walton.\"  \"Who is Henry Walton?\" asked a member.  \"Mr. President, may I answer the gentleman?\" asked Fitzgerald Fletcher, rising to his feet.  \"As the nominee is not to be voted upon this evening, it is not in order.\"  \"Mr. President,\" said Oscar, \"I should be glad to have the gentleman report his information.\"  \"Mr. Fletcher may speak if he desires it, but as the name will be referred to the Committee on Nominations, it is hardly necessary.\"  \"Mr. President, I merely wish to inform the Society, that Mr. Walton occupies the dignified position of printer's devil in the office of the 'Centreville Gazette.'\"  \"Mr. President,\" said Oscar, \"may I ask the indulgence of the Society long enough to say that I am quite aware of the fact.  I will add that Mr. Walton is a young man of excellent abilities, and I am confident will prove an accession to the Society.\"  \"I cannot permit further remarks on a matter which will come in due course before the Committee on Nominations,\" said the President.  \"The next business in order is the debate.\"  Of the debate, and the further proceedings, I shall not speak, as they are of no special interest.  But after the meeting was over, groups of members discussed matters which had come up during the evening.  Fletcher approached Oscar Vincent, and said, \"I can't see, Oscar, why you are trying to get that printer's devil into our Society.\"  \"Because he's a good fellow, and smart enough to do us credit.\"  \"If there were any bootblacks in Centreville I suppose you'd be proposing them?\" said Fletcher with a sneer.  \"I might, if they were as smart as my friend Walton.\"  \"You are not very particular about your friends,\" said Fletcher in the same tone.  \"I don't ask them to open their pocket-books, and show me how much money they have.\"  \"I prefer to associate with gentlemen.\"  \"So do I.\"  \"Yet you associate with that printer's devil.\"  \"I consider him a gentleman.\"  Fletcher laughed scornfully.  \"You have strange ideas of a gentleman,\" he said.  \"I hold the same,\" said James Hooper, who had come up in time to hear the last portion of the conversation.  \"I don't think a full purse is the only or the chief qualification of a gentleman.  If labor is to be a disqualification, then I must resign all claims to be considered a gentleman, as I worked on a farm for two years before coming to school, and in that way earned the money to pay my expenses here.\"  Fletcher"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12741"],["title","Risen from the Ranks; Or, Harry Walton's Success (#8)"],["body","up his nose, but did not reply.  Hooper was a good scholar and influential in the Society, but in Fletcher's eyes he was unworthy of consideration.  \"Look here, Fletcher,--what makes you so confoundedly exclusive is your ideas?\" asked Henry Fairbanks.  \"Because I respect myself,\" said Fletcher in rather a surly tone.  \"Then you have one admirer,\" said Fairbanks.  \"What do you mean by that?\" asked Fletcher, suspiciously.  \"Nothing out of the way.  I believe in self-respect, but I don't see how it is going to be endangered by the admission of Oscar's friend to the Society.\"  \"Am I expected to associate on equal terms with a printer's devil?\"  \"I can't answer for you.  As for me, if he is a good fellow, I shall welcome him to our ranks.  Some of our most eminent men have been apprenticed to the trade of printer.  I believe, after all, it is the name that has prejudiced you.\"  \"No it isn't.  I have seen him.\"  \"Henry Walton?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Where?\"  \"In Oscar's room.\"  \"Well?\"  \"I don't like his appearance.\"  \"What's the matter with his appearance?\" asked Oscar.  \"He looks low.\"  \"That's where I must decidedly contradict you, Fitz, and I shall appeal confidently to the members of the Society when they come to know him, as they soon will, for I am sure no one else shares your ridiculous prejudices.  Harry Walton, in my opinion, is a true gentleman, without reference to his purse, and he is bound to rise hereafter, take my word for it.\"  \"There's plenty of room for him to rise,\" said Fletcher with a sneer.  \"That is true not only of him, but of all of us, I take it.\"  \"Do you refer to me?\"  \"Oh no,\" said Oscar with sarcasm.  \"I am quite aware that you are at the pinnacle of eminence, even if you do flunk in Greek occasionally.\"  Fitzgerald had failed in the Greek recitation during the day, and that in school parlance is sometimes termed a \"flunk.\"  He bit his lip in mortification at this reference, and walked away, leaving Oscar master of the situation.  \"You had the best of him there, Vincent,\" said George Sanborn.  \"He has gone off in disgust.\"  \"I like to see Fletcher taken down,\" said Henry Fairbanks.  \"I never saw a fellow put on so many airs.  He is altogether too aristocratic to associate with ordinary people.\"  \"Yes,\" said Oscar, \"he has a foolish pride, which I hope he will some time get rid of.\"  \"He ought to have been born in England, and not in a republic.\"  \"If he had been born in England, he would have been unhappy unless he had belonged to the nobility,\" said Alfred DeWitt.  \"Look here, boys,\" said Tom Carver, \"what do you say to mortifying Fitz's pride?\"  \"Have you got a plan in view, Tom?  If so, out with it.\"  \"Yes: you know the pedler that comes into town about once a month to buy up rags, and sell his tinwares.\"  \"I have seen him.  Well, what of him?\"  \"He is coming early next week.  Some of us will see him privately, and post him up as to Fitz's relations and position, and hire him to come up to school, and inquire for Fitz, representing himself as his cousin.  Of course Fitz will deny it indignantly, but he will persist and show that he knows all about the family.\"  \"Good!  Splendid!\" exclaimed the boys laughing.  \"Won't Fitz be raving?\"  \"There's no doubt about that.   Well, boys, I'll arrange it all, if you'll authorize me.\"  \"Go ahead, Tom.  You can draw upon us for the necessary funds.\"  Fletcher had retired to his room, angry at the opposition his proposal had received, and without any warning of the humiliation which awaited him.     CHAPTER X.  THE TIN-PEDLER.  Those of my readers who live in large cities are probably not familiar with the travelling tin-pedler, who makes his appearance at frequent intervals in the country towns and villages of New England. His stock of tinware embraces a large variety of articles for culinary purposes, ranging from milk-pans to nutmeg-graters.  These are contained in a wagon of large capacity, in shape like a box, on which he sits enthroned a merchant prince.  Unlike most traders, he receives little money, most of his transactions being in the form of a barter, whereby be exchanges his merchandise for rags, white and colored, which have accumulated in the household, and are gladly traded off for bright tinware.  Behind the cart usually depend two immense bags, one for white, the other for colored rags, which, in time, are sold to paper manufacturers.  It may be that the very paper on which this description is printed, was manufactured from rags so collected.  Abner Bickford was the proprietor of such an establishment as I have described.  No one, at first sight, would have hesitated to class him as a Yankee.  He was long in the limbs, and long in the face, with a shrewd twinkle in the eye, a long nose, and the expression of a man who respected himself and feared nobody.  He was unpolished, in his manners, and knew little of books, but he belonged to the same resolute and hardy type of men who in years past sprang to arms, and fought bravely for an idea.  He was strong in his manhood, and would have stood unabashed before a king.  Such was the man who was to mortify the pride of Fitzgerald Fletcher.  Tom Carver watched for his arrival in Centreville, and walking up to his cart, accosted him.  \"Good-morning, Mr. Bickford.\"  \"Good-mornin', young man.  You've got the advantage of me.  I never saw you before as I know of.\"  \"I am Tom Carver, at your service.\"  \"Glad to know you.  Where do you live?  Maybe your wife would like some tinware this mornin'?\" said Abner, relaxing his gaunt features into a smile.  \"She didn't say anything about it when I came out,\" said Tom, entering into the joke.  \"Maybe you'd like a tin-dipper for your youngest boy?\"  \"Maybe I would, if you've got any to give away.\"  \"I see you've cut your eye-teeth.  Is there anything else I can do for you?  I'm in for a trade.\"  \"I don't know, unless I sell myself for rags.\"  \"Anything for a trade.  I'll give you two cents a pound.\"  \"That's too cheap.  I came to ask your help in a trick we boys want to play on one of our number.\"  \"Sho! you don't say so.  That aint exactly in my line.\"  \"I'll tell you all about it.  There's a chap at our school--the Academy, you know--who's awfully stuck up.  He's all the time bragging about belonging to a first family in Boston, and turning up his nose at poorer boys.  We want to mortify him.\"  \"Just so!\" said Abner, nodding.  \"Drive ahead!\"  \"Well, we thought if you'd call at the school and ask after him, and pretend he was a cousin of yours, and all that, it would make him mad.\"  \"Oh, I see,\" said Abner, nodding, \"he wouldn't like to own a tin-pedler for his cousin.\"  \"No,\" said Tom; \"he wants us to think all his relations are rich.  I wouldn't mind at all myself,\" he added, it suddenly occurring to him that Abner's feelings might be hurt.  \"Good!\" said Abner, \"I see you aint one of the stuck-up kind.  I've got some relations in Boston myself, that are rich and stuck up.  I never go near 'em.  What's the name of this chap you're talkin' about?\"  \"Fletcher--Fitzgerald Fletcher.\"  \"Fletcher!\" repeated Abner.  \"Whew! well, that's a joke!\"  \"What's a joke?\" asked Tom, rather surprised.  \"Why, he _is_ my relation--a sort of second cousin.  Why, my mother and his father are own cousins.  So, don't you see we're second cousins?\"  \"That's splendid!\" exclaimed Tom.  \"I can hardly believe it.\"  \"It's so.  My mother's name was Fletcher--Roxanna Fletcher--afore she married.  Jim Fletcher--this boy's father--used to work in my grandfather's store, up to Hampton, but he got kinder discontented, and went off to Boston, where he's been lucky, and they do say he's mighty rich now.  I never go nigh him, 'cause I know he looks down on his country cousins, and I don't believe in pokin' my nose in where I aint wanted.\"  \"Then you are really and truly Fitz's cousin?\"  \"If that's the boy's name.  Seems to me it's a kinder queer one.  I s'pose it's a fust-claas name.  Sounds rather stuck up.\"  \"Won't the boys roar when they hear about it!  Are you willing to enter into our plan?\"  \"Well,\" said Abner, \"I'll do it.  I can't abide folks that's stuck up.  I'd rather own a cousin like you.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Bickford.\"  \"When do you want me to come round?\"  \"How long do you stay in town?\"  \"Well, I expect to stop overnight at the tavern; I can't get through in one day.\"  \"Then come round to the Academy to-morrow morning, about half-past eight.  School don't begin till nine, but the boys will be playing ball alongside.  Then we'll give you an introduction to your cousin.\"  \"That'll suit me well enough.  I'll come.\"  Tom Carver returned in triumph, and communicated to the other boys the arrangement be had made with Mr. Bickford, and his unexpected discovery of the genuine relationship that existed between Fitz and the tin-pedler.  His communication was listened to with great delight, and no little hilarity, and the boys discussed the probable effect of the projected meeting.  \"Fitz will be perfectly raving,\" said Henry Fairbanks.  \"There's nothing that will take down his pride so much.\"  \"He'll deny the relationship, probably,\" said Oscar.  \"How can he?\"  \"He'll do it.  See if he don't.  It would be death to all his aristocratic claims to admit it.\"  \"Suppose it were yourself, Oscar?\"  \"I'd say, 'How are you, cousin?  How's the the business?'\" answered Oscar, promptly.  \"I believe you would, Oscar.  There's nothing of the snob about you.\"  \"I hope not.\"  \"Yet your family stands as high as Fletcher's.\"  \"That's a point I leave to others to discuss,\" said Oscar.  \"My father is universally respected, I am sure, but he rose from the ranks.  He was once a printer's devil, like my friend Harry Walton. Wouldn't it be ridiculous in me to turn up my nose at Walton, just because be stands now where my father did thirty years ago?  It would be the same thing as sneering at father.\"  \"Give us your hand, Oscar,\" said Henry Fairbanks.  \"You've got no nonsense about you--I like you.\"  \"I'm not sure"]]]
