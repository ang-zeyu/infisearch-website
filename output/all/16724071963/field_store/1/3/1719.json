The timid man is never reckless, the wise man frequently is, the fool always; the recklessness of the last is blind; if he gets through all right he is lucky.  It is reckless to race sixty miles an hour over a highway; but the man who does it with his eyes wide open, with a perfect appreciation of all the dangers, is, in reality, less reckless than the man who blindly runs his machine, hit or miss, along the road at thirty miles an hour,--the latter leaves havoc in his train.  One must have a cool, quick, and accurate appreciation of the margin of safety under all circumstances; it is the utilization of this entire margin--to the very verge--that yields the largest results in the way of rapid progress.  Every situation presents its own problem,--a problem largely mechanical,--a matter of power, speed, and obstructions; the chauffeur will win out whose perception of the conditions affecting these several factors is quickest and clearest.  One man will go down a hill, or make a safe turn at a high rate of speed, where another will land in the ditch, simply because the former overlooks nothing, while the latter does. It is not so much a matter of experience as of natural bent and adaptability. Some men can drive machines with very little experience and no instructions; others cannot, however long they try and however much they are told.  Accidents on the road are due to Defects in the road, Defects in the machine, or Defects in the driver.  American roads are bad, but not so bad that they can, with justice, be held responsible for many of the troubles attributed to them.  The roads are as they are, a practically constant,--and, for some time to come,--an unchangeable quantity. The roads are like the hills and the mountains, obstacles which must be overcome, and machines must be constructed to overcome them.  Complaints against American roads by American manufacturers of automobiles are as irrelevant to the issue as would be complaints on the part of traction-engine builders or wagon makers. Any man who makes vehicles for a given country must make them to go under the conditions--good, bad, or indifferent--which prevail in that country. In building automobiles for America or Australia, the only pertinent question is, \"What are the roads of America or Australia?\" not what ought they to be.  The manufacturer who finds fault with the roads should go out of the business.  Roads will be improved, but in a country so vast and sparsely settled as North America, it is not conceivable that within the next century a net-work of fine roads will cover the land; for generations to come there will be soft roads, sandy roads, rocky roads, hilly roads, muddy roads,--and the American automobile must be so constructed as to cover them as they are.  The manufacturer who waits for good roads everywhere should move his factory to the village of Falling Waters, and sleep in the Kaatskills.  Machines which give out on bad roads, simply because the roads are bad, are faultily constructed.  Defects in roads, to which mishaps may be fairly attributed, are only those unlooked for conditions which make trouble for all other vehicles, such as wash-outs, pit-holes, weak culverts, broken bridges,--in short, conditions which require repairs to restore the road to normal condition. The normal condition may be very bad; but whatever it is, the automobile must be constructed so as to travel thereon, else it is not adapted to that section of the country.  It may be discouraging to the driver for pleasure to find in rainy weather almost bottomless muck and mud on portions of the main travelled highway between New York and Buffalo, but that, for the present, is normal. The manufacturer may regret the condition and wish for better, but he cannot be heard to complain, and if the machine, with reasonably careful driving, gives out, it is the fault of the maker and not the roads.  It follows, therefore, that few troubles can be rightfully attributed to defects in the road, since what are commonly called defects are conditions quite normal to the country.  It was nearly six o'clock when we arrived at Fremont. The streets were filled with people in gala attire, the militia were out, --bands playing, fire-crackers going,--a belated Fourth of July.  When we stopped for water, we casually asked a small patriot,--  \"What are you celebrating?\"  \"The second of August,\" was the prompt reply. I left it to the Professor to find out what had happened on the second of August, for the art of teaching is the concealment of ignorance.  With a fine assumption of his very best lecture-room manner, the Professor leaned carelessly upon the delicate indicator on the gasoline tank and began:  \"That was a great day, my boy.\"  \"Yes, sir, it was.\"  \"And it comes once a year.\"  \"Why, sure.\"  \"Ahem--\" in some confusion, \"I mean you celebrate once a year.\"  \"Sure, we celebrate every second of August, and it comes every year.\"  \"Quite right, quite right; always recall with appropriate exercises the great events in your country's history.\" The Professor peered benignly over his glasses at the boy and continued kindly but firmly:  \"Now, my boy, do you go to school?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Very good. Now can you tell me why the people of Fremont celebrate the second of August?\"  \"Sure, it is on account of--\" then a curious on-looker nudged the Professor in the ribs and began, as so many had done before,--  \"Say, mister, it's none of my business--\"  \"Exactly,\" groaned the Professor; \"it weighs a ton--two tons sometimes--more in the sand; it cost twelve hundred dollars, and will cost more before we are done with it. Yes, I know what you are about to say, you could buy a 'purty slick' team for that price,--in fact, a dozen nags such as that one leaning against you,--but we don't care for horses. My friend here who is spilling the water all over the machine and the small boy, once owned a horse, it kicked over the dash-board, missed his mother-in-law and hit him; horse's intention good, but aim bad,--since then he has been prejudiced against horses; it goes by gasoline--sometimes; that is not a boiler, it is the cooler--on hot days we take turns sitting on it;--explosions,--electric spark,--yes, it is queer; --man at last stop made same bright remark; no danger from explosions if you are not too near,--about a block away is safer; start by turning a crank; yes, that is queer, queerer than the other queer things; cylinder does get hot, but so do we all at times; we ought to have water jackets--that is a joke that goes with the machine; yes, it is very fast, from fifty to seventy miles per--; 'per what?' you say; well, that depends upon the roads,--not at all, I assure you, no trouble to anticipate your inquiries by these answers--it is so seldom one meets any one who is really interested--you can order a machine by telegraph; any more information you would like?--No!--then my friend, in return, will you tell me why you celebrate the second of August?\"  \"Danged if I know.\" And we never found out.  At Bellevue we lighted our lamps and ran to Norwalk over a very fair road, arriving a few minutes after eight. Norwalk liveries did not like automobiles, so we put the machine under a shed.  This second day's run was about one hundred and fifty miles in twelve hours and fifty-four minutes gross time; deducting stops, left nine hours and fifty-four minutes running time--an average of about fourteen and one-half miles per hour.  Ohio roads are by no means so good as Indiana. Not until we left Painesville did we find any gravel to speak of. There was not much deep sand, but roads were dry, dusty, and rough; in many localities hard clay with deep ruts and holes.  A six o'clock call and a seven o'clock breakfast gave time enough to inspect the machine.  The water-tank was leaking through a crack in the side, but not so badly that we could not go on to Cleveland, where repairs could be made more quickly. A slight pounding which had developed was finally located in the pinion of a small gear-wheel that operated the exhaust-valve.  It is sometimes by no means easy to locate a pounding in a gasoline motor, and yet it must be found and stopped. An expert from the factory once worked four days trying to locate a very loud and annoying pounding. He, of course, looked immediately at the crank- and wrist-pins, taking up what little wear was perceptible, but the pounding remained; then eccentric strap, pump, and every bearing about the motor were gone over one by one, without success; the main shaft was lifted out, fly-wheel drawn off, a new key made; the wheel drawn on again tight, all with no effect upon the hard knock which came at each explosion. At last the guess was made that possibly the piston was a trifle small for the cylinder; a new and slightly larger piston was put in and the noise ceased. It so happened that the expert had heard of one other such case, therefore he made the experiment of trying a fractionally larger piston as a last resort; imagine the predicament of the amateur, or the mechanic who had never heard of such a trouble.  There is, of course, a dull thud at each explosion; this is the natural \"kick\" of the engine, and is very perceptible on large single-cylinder motors; but this dull thud is very different from the hammer-like knock resulting from lost motion between the parts, and the practised ear will detect the difference at once.  The best way to find the pounding is to throw a stream of heavy lubricating oil on the bearings, one by one, until the noise is silenced for the moment. Even the piston can be reached with a flood of oil and tested.  It is not easy to tell by feeling whether a bearing on a gasoline motor is too free. The heat developed is so great that bearings are left with considerable play.  A leak in the water-tank or coils is annoying; but if facilities for permanent repair"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12380"],["title","Two Thousand Miles on an Automobile (#7)"],["body"," lacking, a pint of bran or middlings from any farmer's barn, put in the water, will close the leak nine times out of ten.  From Norwalk through Wakeman and Kipton to Oberlin the road is rather poor, with but two or three redeeming stretches near Kipton. It is mostly clay, and in dry weather is hard and dusty and rough from much traffic.  Leading into Oberlin the road is covered with great broad flag-stones, which once upon a time must have presented a smooth hard surface, but now make a succession of disagreeable bumps.  Out of Elyria we made the mistake of leaving the trolley line, and for miles had to go through sand, which greatly lessened our speed, but towards Stony River the road was perfect, and we made the best time of the day.  It required some time in Cleveland to remove and repair the water-tank, cut a link out of the chain, take up the lost motion in the steering-wheel, and tighten up things generally. It was four o'clock before we were off for Painesville.  Euclid Avenue is well paved in the city, but just outside there is a bit of old plank road that is disgracefully bad. Through Wickliff, Willoughby, and Mentor the road is a smooth, hard gravel.  Arriving at Painesville a few minutes after seven, we took in gasoline, had supper, and prepared to start for Ashtabula.  It was dark, so we could not see the tires; but just before starting I gave each a sharp blow with a wrench to see if it was hard,--a sharp blow, or even a kick, tells the story much better than feeling of the tires.  One rear tire was entirely deflated. A railroad spike four and three-quarters inches long, and otherwise well proportioned, had penetrated full length. It had been picked up along the trolley line, was probably struck by the front wheel, lifted up on end so that the rear tire struck the sharp end exactly the right angle to drive the spike in lengthwise of the tread.  It was a big ragged puncture which could not be repaired on the road; there was nothing to do but stop over night and have a tire sent out from Cleveland next day.  While waiting the next morning, we jacked up the wheel and removed the damaged tire.  It is not easy to remove quickly and put on heavy single-tube tires, and a few suggestions may not be amiss.  The best tools are half-leaves of carriage springs. At any carriage shop one can get halves of broken springs. They should be sixteen or eighteen inches long, and are ready for use without forging filing or other preparation. With three such halves one man can take off a tire in fifteen or twenty minutes; two men will work a little faster; help on the road is never wanting.  Let the wheel rest on the tire with valve down; loosen all the lugs; insert thin edge of spring-leaf between rim and tire, breaking the cement and partially freeing tire; insert spring-leaf farther at a point just about opposite valve and pry tire free from rim, holding and working it free by pushing in other irons or screw-drivers, or whatever you have handy; when lugs and tire are out of the hollow of the rim for a distance of eighteen or twenty inches, it will be easy to pass the iron underneath the tire, prying up the tire until it slips over the rim, when with the hands it can be pulled off entirely; the wheel is then raised and the valve-stem carefully drawn out.  All this can be done with the wheel jacked up, but if resting on the tire as suggested, the valve-stem is protected during the efforts to loosen tire.  To put on a single-tube tire properly, the rim should be thoroughly cleaned with gasoline, and the new tire put on with shellac or cement, or with simply the lugs to hold.  Shellac can be obtained at any drug store, is quickly brushed over both the tire and the rim, and the tire put in place--that holds very well. Cement well applied is stronger. If the rim is well covered with old cement, gasoline applied to the surface of the old cement will soften it; or with a plumber's torch the rim may be heated without injuring enamel and the cement melted, or take a cake of cement, soften it in gasoline or melt it, or even light it like a stick of sealing-wax and apply it to the rim. If hot cement is used it will be necessary to heat the rim after the tire is on to make a good job.  After the rim is prepared, insert valve-stem and the lugs near it; let the wheel down so as to rest on that part of the tire, then with the iron work the tire into the rim, beginning at each side of valve. The tire goes into place easily until the top is reached where the two irons are used to lift tire and lugs over the rim; once in rim it is often necessary to pound the tire with the flat of the iron to work the lugs into their places; by striking the tire in the direction it should go the lugs one by one will slip into their holes; put on the nuts and the work is done.  In selecting a half-leaf of a spring, choose one the width of the springs to the machine, and carry along three or four small spring clips, for it is quite likely a spring may be broken in the course of a long run, and, if so, the half-leaf can be clipped over the break, making the broken spring as serviceable and strong for the time being as if sound.     CHAPTER FIVE ON TO BUFFALO \"GEE WHIZ!!\"  From Painesville three roads led east,--the North Ridge, Middle Ridge, and South Ridge. We followed the middle road, which is said to be by far the best; it certainly is as good a gravel road as one could ask. Some miles out a turn is made to the South Ridge for Ashtabula.  There is said to be a good road out of Ashtabula; possibly there is, but we missed it at one of the numerous cross roads, and soon found ourselves wallowing through corn-fields, climbing hills, and threading valleys in the vain effort to find Girard,--a point quite out of our way, as we afterwards learned.  The Professor's bump of locality is a depression. As a passenger without serious occupation, it fell to his lot to inquire the way. This he would do very minutely, with great suavity and becoming gravity, and then with no sign of hesitation indicate invariably the wrong road. Once, after crossing a field where there were no fences to mark the highway, descending a hill we could not have mounted, and finding a stream that seemed impassable, the Professor quietly remarked,--  \"That old man must have been mistaken regarding the road; yet he had lived on that corner forty years. Strange how little some people know about their surroundings!\"  \"But are you sure he said the first turn to the left?\"  \"He said the first turn, but whether to the left or right I cannot now say. It must have been to the right.\"  \"But, my dear Professor, you said to the left.\"  \"Well, we were going pretty fast when we came to the four corners, and something had to be said, and said quickly. I notice that on an automobile decision is more important than accuracy. After being hauled over the country for three days, I have made up my mind that automobiles are driven upon the hypothesis that it is better to lose the road, lose life, lose anything than lose time, therefore, when you ask me which way to turn, you will get an immediate, if not an accurate, response; besides, there is a bridge ahead, a little village across the stream, so the road leads somewhere.\"  Now and then the Professor would jump out to assist some female in distress with her horse; at first it was a matter of gallantry, then a duty, then a burden. Towards the last it used to delight him to see people frantically turning into lanes, fields, anywhere to get out of the way.  The horse is a factor to be considered--and placated. He is in possession and cannot be forcibly ejected,--a sort of terre-tenant; such title as he has must be respected.  After wrestling with an unusually notional beast, to the great disorder of clothing and temper, the Professor said,--  \"The brain of the horse is small; it is an animal of little sense and great timidity, but it knows more than most people who attempt to drive.\"  In reality horses are seldom driven; they generally go as they please, with now and then a hint as to which corner to turn. Nine times out of ten it is the driven horse that makes trouble for owners of automobiles. The drunken driver never has any trouble; his horses do not stop, turn about, or shy into the ditch; the man asleep on the box is perfectly safe; his horse ambles on, minding its own business, giving a full half of the road to the approaching machine. It is the man, who, on catching sight of the automobile, nervously gathers up his reins, grabs his whip, and pulls and jerks, who makes his own troubles; he is searching for trouble, expects it, and is disappointed if he gets by without it. Nine times out of ten it is the driver who really frightens the horse. A country plug, jogging quietly along, quite unterrified, may be roused to unwonted capers by the person behind.  Some take the antics of their horses quite philosophically. One old farmer, whose wheezy nag tried to climb the fence, called out,--  \"Gee whiz! I wish you fellers would come this way every day; the old hoss hasn't showed so much ginger for ten year.\"  Another, carrying just a little more of the wine of the country than his legs could bear, stood up unsteadily in his wagon and shouted,--  \"If you (hic) come around these pa-arts again with that thres-in' ma-a-chine, I'll have the law on you,--d'ye hear?\"  The personal equation is everything on the road, as elsewhere.  It is quite idle to expect skill, courage, or common sense from the great majority of drivers. They get along very well so long as nothing happens, but in emergencies they are helpless, because they have never had experience in emergencies. The man who has driven horses all his life is frequently as helpless under unusual conditions as the novice. Few drivers know when and how to use the whip to prevent a runaway or a smash-up.  With the exception of professional and a few amateur whips, no one is ever taught how to drive. Most persons who"]]]
