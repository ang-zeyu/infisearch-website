A railroad was built through the town and the land I owned there rose enormously in value. I had a splendid location for a modern store but I could not seem to make up my mind to change. So I sold out everything--store, land, the home farm and all, and received a good figure--a _very_ good figure. I was very fortunate in owning practically the whole townsite--the new townsite, that is. I do not like these so-called booms, however, and so I left to begin somewhere else. I did not care to enter the mercantile business again, and our doctor advised me to live as much as possible in the open air. Mother died of consumption. So I decided to come West and buy a cattle ranch. I believed I should like it. I always liked animals.\"  \"Uh-huh--so do I.\" It was not just what Charming Billy most wanted to say, but that much was perfectly safe, and noncommittal to say.  Mr. Dill was silent a minute, looking speculatively across to the Hardup Saloon which was practically empty and therefore quite peaceful. Billy, because long living on the range made silence easy, smoked and said nothing.  \"Mr. Boyle,\" began Dill at last, in the hesitating way that he had used when Billy first met him, \"you say you know this country, and have worked at cattle-raising for a good many years--\"  \"Twelve,\" supplemented Charming Billy. \"Turned my first cow when I was sixteen.\"  \"So you must be perfectly familiar with the business. I frankly admit that I am not familiar with it. You say you are at present out of employment and so I am thinking seriously of offering you a position myself, as confidential adviser if you like. I really need some one who can accompany me about the country and keep me from such deplorable blunders as was yesterday's experience. After I have bought a place, I shall need some one who is familiar with the business and will honestly work for my interests and assist me in the details until I have myself gained a practical working-knowledge of it. I think I can make such an arrangement to your advantage as well as my own. From the start the salary would be what is usually paid to a foreman. What do you say?\"  For an appreciable space Charming Billy Boyle did not say a word. He was not stupid and he saw in a flash all the possibilities that lay in the offer. To be next the very top--to have his say in the running of a model cow-outfit--and it should be a model outfit if he took charge, for he had ideas of his own about how these things should be done--to be foreman, with the right to \"hire and fire\" at his own discretion--He turned, flushed and bright-eyed, to Dill.  \"God knows why yuh cut _me_ out for the job,\" he said in a rather astonished voice. \"What you've seen uh me, so far, ain't been what I'd call a gilt-edge recommend. But if you're fool enough to mean it serious, it's as I told yuh a while back: Yuh can count on me till they're cutting figure-eights all over hell.\"  \"That, according to the scientists who are willing to concede the existence of such a place, will be quite as long as I shall be likely to have need of your loyalty,\" observed Mr. Dill, puckering his long face into the first smile Billy had seen him attempt.  He did not intimate the fact that he had inquired very closely into the record and the general range qualifications of Charming Billy Boyle, sounding, for that purpose, every responsible man in Hardup. With the new-born respect for him bred by his peculiarly efficacious way of handling those who annoyed him beyond the limit, he was told the truth and recognized it as such. So he was not really as rash and as given over to his impulses as Billy, in his ignorance of the man, fancied.  The modesty of Billy would probably have been shocked if he had heard the testimony of his fellows concerning him. As it was, he was rather dazed and a good deal inclined to wonder how Alexander P. Dill had ever managed to accumulate enough capital to start anything--let alone a cow-outfit--if he took on trust every man he met. He privately believed that Dill had taken a long chance, and that he should consider himself very lucky because he had accidentally picked a man who would not \"steal him blind.\"         *       *       *       *       *  After that there were many days of riding to and fro, canvassing all northern Montana in search of a location and an outfit that suited them and that could be bought. And in the riding, Mr. Dill became under the earnest tutelage of Charming Billy a shade less ignorant of range ways and of the business of \"raising wild cattle for the Eastern markets.\"  He even came to speak quite easily of \"outfits\" in all the nice shades of meaning which are attached to that hard-worked term. He could lay the saddle-blanket smooth and unwrinkled, slap the saddle on and cinch it without fixing it either upon the withers or upon the rump of his long-suffering mount. He could swing his quirt without damaging his own person, and he rode with his stirrups where they should be to accommodate the length of him--all of which speaks eloquently of the honest intentions of Dill's confidential adviser.     CHAPTER VIII.  _Just a Day-dream._   Charming Billy rode humped over the saddle-horn, as rides one whose mind feels the weight of unpleasant thoughts. Twice he had glanced uncertainly at his companion, opening his lips for speech; twice he had closed them silently and turned again to the uneven trail.  Mr. Dill also was humped forward in the saddle, but if one might judge from his face it was because he was cold. The wind blew chill from out the north and they were facing it; the trail they followed was frozen hard and the gray clouds above promised snow. The cheek-bones of Dill were purple and the point of his long nose was very red. Tears stood in his eyes, whipped there by the biting wind.  \"How far are we now from town?\" he asked dispiritedly.  \"Only about five miles,\" Billy cheered. Then, as if trivial speech had made easier what he had in mind to say, he turned resolutely toward the other. \"Yuh expect to meet old man Robinson there, don't yuh?\"  \"That was the arrangement, as I understood it\"  \"And you're thinking strong of buying him out?\"  \"His place appeals to me more than any of the others, and--yes, it seems to me that I can't do better.\" Mr. Dill turned the collar of his coat up a bit farther--or fancied he did so--and looked questioningly at Billy.  \"Yuh gave me leave to advise yuh where yuh needed it,\" Billy said almost challengingly, \"and I'm going to call yuh, right here and now. If yuh take my advice yuh won't go making medicine with old Robinson any more. He'll do yuh, sure. He's asking yuh double what the outfit's worth. They _all_ are. It looks to me like they think you're just out here to get rid of your pile and the bigger chunk they can pry loose from yuh the better. I was going to put yuh next before this, only yuh didn't seem to take to any uh the places real serious, so it wasn't necessary.\"  \"I realize that one cannot buy land and cattle for nothing,\" Dill chuckled. \"It seemed to me that, compared with the prices others have asked, Mr. Robinson's offer was very reasonable.\"  \"It may be lower than Jacobs and Wilter, but that don't make it right.\"  \"Well, there were the Two Sevens\"--he meant the Seventy-Seven, but that was a mere detail--\"I didn't get to see the owner, you know. I have written East, however, and should hear from him in a few days.\"  \"Yuh ain't likely to do business with _that_ layout, because I don't believe they'd sell at any price. Old Robinson is the washout yuh want to ride around at present; I ain't worrying about the rest, right now. He's a smooth old devil, and he'll do yuh sure.\"  To this Mr. Dill made no reply whatever. He fumbled the fastenings on his coon-skin coat, tried to pull his cap lower and looked altogether unhappy. And Charming Billy, not at ail sure that his advice would be taken or his warning heeded, stuck the spurs into his horse and set a faster pace reflecting gloomily upon the trials of being confidential adviser to one who, in a perfectly mild and good-mannered fashion, goes right along doing pretty much as he pleases.  It made him think, somehow, of Miss Bridger and the way she had forced him to take his gun with him when he had meant to leave it. She was like Dill in that respect: nice and good-natured and smiling--only Dill smiled but seldom--and yet always managing to make you give up your own wishes. He wished vaguely that the wanderings of Dill would bring them back to the Double-Crank country, instead of leading them always farther afield. He did not, however, admit openly to himself that he wanted to see Miss Bridger again; yet he did permit himself to wonder if she ever played coon-can with any one else, or if she had already forgotten the game. Probably she had, and--well, a good many other things that he remembered quite distinctly.  Later, when they had reached town, were warmed and fed and when even Billy was thinking seriously of sleep, Dill came over and sat down beside him solemnly, folded his bony hands upon knees quite as bony, regarded pensively the generously formed foot dangling some distance before him and smiled his puckered smile.  \"I have been wondering, William, if you had not some plan of your own concerning this cattle-raising business, which you think is better than mine but which you hesitate to express. If you have, I hope you will feel quite free to--er--lay it before the head of the firm. It may interest you to know that I have, as you would put it, 'failed to connect' with Mr. Robinson. So, if you have any ideas--\"  \"Oh, I'm burning up with 'em,\" Charming Billy retorted in a way he meant to be sarcastic, but which Mr. Dill took quite seriously.  \"Then I hope you won't hesitate--\"  \"Now look here, Dilly,\" expostulated he, between puffs. \"Recollect, it's _your_ money that's going to feed the birds--and it's your privilege to throw it out to suit"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1221"],["title","A Preliminary Revision of the North American Species of Cactus, Anhalonium, and (#0)"],["body","Preliminary Revision of the North American Species of Cactus, Anhalonium, and Lophophora by John M.

C., March 21, 1894 SIR:  I have the honor to transmit herewith, for publication as Vol. III, No. 2, of Contributions from the U. S. National Herbarium, a Preliminary Revision of the North American species of Cactus, Anhalonium, and Lophophora, by President John M. Coulter. Respectfully, Frederick V. Coville, Chief of the Division of Botany. Hon. J. Sterling Morton, Secretary of Agriculture.     PRELIMINARY REVISION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN SPECIES OF CACTUS, ANHALONIUM, AND LOPHOPHORA. Prefatory Note. In the fall of 1890 Dr. George Vasey, then Botanist of the Department of Agriculture, arranged with me to prepare a revision of North American Cactaceae.  Owing to the peculiar difficulty of preserving material the family was poorly represented, even in our leading herbaria.  To secure a large amount of additional material in the way of specimens and field notes the Department authorized me to visit the region of the Mexican boundary during the summer of 1891.  Preliminary to this exploration it was necessary to examine the Engelmann collection of Cactaceae, in the possession of the Missouri Botanical Garden.  This collection, supplemented by the continual additions made at the garden, is by far the largest collection of skeletons and living specimens in this country, and also contains the large majority of our types.  In March, 1891, I visited this collection and made such notes as seemed necessary for use in the field, and in June, accompanied by Mr. W. H. Evans and Mr. G. C. Nealley, I began field work in the neighborhood of El Paso, Tex.  After ten days of exploration it was necessary for me to leave the field work in charge of Mr. Evans, who, with Mr. Nealley, continued work westward, during July and a part of August, to southern California, along the Southern Pacific Railway.  As a result a large number of complete plant bodies was secured, but very few of them were in flower and the field notes indicated little besides collection stations. During the following fall and winter preliminary determinations of this material were made by Mr. Evans. In the fall of 1892 critical study of this and other collections was begun in connection with my assistants, Dr. Elmon M. Fisher and Mr. Edwin B. Uline, who have ever since rendered constant and most import assistance in the examination of material and bibliography, which alone has made the work possible in the midst of other pressing duties.  In the spring of 1893 these two gentlemen spent several weeks at the Missouri Botanical Garden in the critical study of its rich material, and during the latter part of their stay I assisted in the work.  Dr. William Trelease, the director of the garden, had hastened the arrangement of the Engelmann material, and had mounted in convenient form the large mass of notes left by Dr. Engelmann.  These notes contained not only critical remarks upon known species, but also the diagnoses of many unpublished species which had come into his hands, notably those collected by Mr. William Gabb in 1867 in Lower California.  The collections that have thus far been studied are:  (1) Those of the Missouri Botanical Garden; and thanks are especially due to Dr. Trelease for his generous cooperation in the use of this material, without which the work would have been impossible.  (2) Those of the Department of Agriculture, including the results of several recent explorations, for the use of which I am indebted to Mr. Frederick V. Coville.  (3) Those of the Gray Herbarium at Harvard University, which Dr. B. L. Robinson kindly placed at my disposal.  (4) Those of the California Academy of Sciences, notably rich in forms from Lower California and the adjacent islands, kindly loaned by Mr. T. S. Brandegee.  (5) Those of Dr. Louis Eschanzier, of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, who send a large series of Mexican forms collected in 1891.  (6) Numerous small sets from different correspondents, who have given both time and material in aiding the work.  It is needless to say that Dr. George Engelmann, the great pioneer student of this difficult family, has opened the paths in which we must follow, and it was exceedingly unfortunate that he was not able to complete the final revision that he had in mind.  The difficulties which beset the critical study of this group can not be easily exaggerated.  Such scanty material as has been collected has been for the most part very incomplete, consisting of plant bodies without flower or fruit, flower or fruit without plant bodies, and bunches of spines without either.  The species are displayed also in the most inaccessible regions, and their culmination is found in the still poorly known regions of Mexico.  On account of their singular forms and often brilliant flowers they have long been extensively cultivated, especially in Europe. These cultivated forms have formed the basis of original descriptions in almost all of the European publications, and in very rare cases have any types been preserved.  As a result, the bibliography of Cactaceae is appalling, and it is questionable whether satisfactory conclusions can be reached in the case of hundreds of published names.  The earlier descriptions were not only meager, but were based upon what are now regarded very insufficient characters, and in the absence of types it is not only unsafe, but impossible to venture an opinion concerning their identity.  In view of these facts, I have thought it advisable to present a preliminary revision of the order, which shall contain the results of the study of material confessedly insufficient.  With such knowledge as we possess brought together, it is hoped that the study of this very interesting and much neglected group will be stimulated, and that more critical exploration of our southwestern territory and adjacent Mexico will make a more satisfactory presentation possible.  It would be useless to notice the vast number of reputed species that are not represented by actual specimens in our possession.  In the proposed preliminary account of the family, of which the present paper is the first part, only those genera are considered which form a part of the flora of the United States, and those species which I have been able to examine and to identify with reasonable certainty.  All forms credited to the United States have been studied, and the account of these species may be considered fairly complete, but the far more numerous Mexican species are but scantily represented.  The Mexican boundary is so unnatural a dividing line in the distribution of Cactaceae that it has been disregarded, and all the species studied have been arranged in a lineal series of uniform prominence.  So far as known the subject of geographical distribution is considered, but it will be seen how meager is our knowledge of this subject.  It is to be hoped that this preliminary presentation will provoke exploration and study, and that species will not only be collected, but all the facts of their distribution noted.  It is more than probable that our present notion of species in this group must be much modified, and doubtless many forms are at present kept specifically distinct which will prove to be but different phases of a single species.  In the matter of generic delimitation we are in still greater uncertainty, and several generic lines at present recognized must be regarded as purely arbitrary, a fact which must become still more evident with additional material.  The whole group is to be regarded as made up of poorly differentiated forms and only long observation under cultivation can determine the possibilities of specific variation under the influence of environment, of age, of inherent tendencies.  For instance, that these plants change in form and in spine characters with increasing age and after they have begun to flower can not be doubted, but what described forms have thus been separated in descriptions can only be guessed at.  John M. Coulter. Lake Forest University, Lake Forest, Ill., January, 1891.     CACTUS, ANHALONIUM, AND LOPHOPHORA.  1. CACTUS Linn. Sp. Pl. 466 (1753), restricted.  MAMILLARIA Haw. Synop. 177 (1812), not Stackh. (1809).  Usually globose to oblong plants (simple, branching or cespitose), but sometimes slender-cylindrical, covered with spine-bearing tubercles: flower-bearing areola axillary (with reference to tubercles), entirely separate from the terminal spine-bearing areola, although sometimes (Coryphantha) connected with it by a woolly groove along the upper face of the tubercle: ovary naked: seeds smooth or pitted: embryo usually straight, with short cotyledons. Originally defined by Linnaeus in his Systema, ed. l (1735).  The Linnaean genus Cactus of 1753 included 22 species and was coextensive with the present order.  In 1812 the species were separated by Haworth into five genera, the original generic name Cactus being discarded.  Among these species C. mamillaris seems to have stood as the type, not only of the Linnaean genus Cactus, but also of Haworth's Mamillaria, and as such should retain the original generic name.  Besides, Mamillaria was used as the generic name of an alga in 1809.  Cactus mamillaris L. is the West Indian Mamillaria simplex Haw.  From one point of view the two sections of the genus (Eumamillaria and Coryphantha) deserve generic separation, for the character of grooveless and grooved tubercles seems to hold without exception, and the sections are separated with more"]]]
