The Osiris story was one of the most widespread in Egypt, and, powerful in its effect on the feelings of all classes, was certain, sooner or later, to prepare the way for a general belief in a better immortality; but if we may judge from the burial customs, the great mass of the people still believed merely in an underworld, Earu, a duplicate of the earthly life, but with greater possibilities of danger and evil.  During the course of Egyptian history the position in which the body is buried undergoes a series of remarkable changes.  During the early pre-dynastic period, the body, loosely enfolded in cloths and skins, is laid in the grave double up on the left side, _usually_ with the head south (i.e. upstream).  This position becomes the custom, with very few exceptions, during the late predynastic period and the first three dynasties.  Throughout the Fourth to Sixth Dynasties, the body was in the same position, but with the head north, loosely covered with shawls and garments.  The crouching position, with some slight modifications, continues to be used for the poorest class down to the New Empire. Among the Nubians, it is universal to the New Empire and customary even later in unmixed Nubian communities.  The swathed extended burials begin in Egypt in the Fourth Dynasty, so far as remains are preserved.  Some members of the royal family of Cheops were buried in swathed wrapping, lying extended on the left side with the knees bent.  During the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties this extended position on the side becomes customary for the better classes; and during the Middle Empire it becomes almost universal.  The final burial position, the swathed mummy lying extended on the back, does not become general until the New Empire, about 1600 B.C. although it is the position hitherto regarded as the characteristic Egyptian burial position.  A few isolated cases, some of them perhaps accidental, occur as early as the Old Empire; but in the New Empire the extended burial on the back is practically the only one to be observed.  In other words, beginning in the predynastic period with a burial position which may be called natural and primitive, the Egyptian gradually adopted a position which imitated the form of the dead Osiris, the god of the dead.  Each new change is first adopted by the royal family, and is taken up by the other classes in turn until it becomes universal.  In the final form, the mummy was a simulacrum of the dead as Osiris.  Alongside these changes in the burial position progressed the art of preserving the body.  The earliest attempts were made on the body of the king; and the knowledge of embalming gained in preserving his body was gradually utilized for the higher classes and finally for all but the poorest.  It seems indisputable that the royal personages of the Fourth and Sixth Dynasties were mummified--i.e., the entrails were drawn, the body prepared with spices and resins and wrapped tightly in cloths smeared with resin.  But the mummies of the nobles, even of this period, show no trace of such treatment.  The receptacles for the viscera are sometimes found in their graves in the Sixth Dynasty, but are, as a rule, empty, being mere dummy vases.  Even in the Middle Empire, the preservation of the bodies of the better classes was extremely imperfect.  The bundles of wrappings have kept their form to the present day and it seems as if the mummy were still intact; but an examination of the interior shows only loose bones.  Successful mummification appears among better-class people in the New Empire for the first time and becomes a general custom in the Late Period.  The processes of successful mummification necessitated the practical destruction of the body.  In the Middle Empire, which is the period under discussion, the process of mummification had reached a middle stage, and, while we are unable to explain exactly the causal relationship, it is clear that this advance in the treatment of the body accompanied a spread of the belief in the Osirian immortality.     VII. THE NEW EMPIRE   The New Empire (1600-1200 B.C.) was the great period of foreign conquest.  The Hyksos, Asiatic invaders, had held Egypt for a century or more.  The Theban princes who drove them out became kings of Egypt, and followed them into Asia.  With an army trained in war by the long struggle with the Hyksos, the Egyptian kings, having tasted the sweetness of the spoils of war, entered on the conquest of western Asia and the Sudan.  The plunder of both these regions poured into Egypt.  Under Thothmes III an annual campaign was conducted into Syria to bring back the spoils and the tribute.  Foreign slaves and the products of foreign handicraft were for sale in every market-place.  The treasury was filled to overflowing.  A large share was assigned to Amon, the god of the Theban family.  Temples were built for him; estates established for the maintenance of his rites; thousands of priests enrolled for the service of his properties.  The god became, in a material sense, the greatest god of Egypt, the national god; and his priesthood became the most powerful organization in the kingdom. The high priest of Amon usurped the power of the king and finally supplanted him.  Such was the period in which the next great development of the Egyptian idea of immortality is to be noted-- a period of priestly activity in the beginning and of priestly domination in the end.  The priests are the scribes, the men of learning.  They have the lore of all magic, medicine, rules of conduct, religious rites. It is not mere chance, therefore, that the New Empire was marked by a great increase of magic in all its forms--texts and symbolic objects--and by a great development in the knowledge of the other world.  In some of the texts the geography of the underworld, in which Osiris is king, is worked out in great detail.  When the sun sets in the west, Ra in his boat enters the underworld and passes through it during the twelve hours of the night, bringing light and happiness to those who are in the underworld.  In the effort to secure the tomb against plundering, the royal graves had been cut in the solid rock,--long and complicated passages with false leads and deceptive turns and the burial chamber in an unexpected place.  The long walls of these rooms presented a great surface suitable to decoration, and they were utilized to depict scenes from the underworld and the passage of Ra through it, so that the tombs became in fact representations of the land of the dead, and were so considered. These royal tombs were at a distance from the cultivated land, hidden in valleys in the desert.  Their funerary temples were built on the edge of the desert beside the temples of the gods of the place.  Such fantastical reconstructions of the other world, however, never found general favor and are confined to a few royal tombs. The priests and other prominent people have rolls of papyrus buried with them, bearing copies of books of the dead.  These books of the dead are made up of a series of chapters, each complete in itself and each dealing with some phase of the future life.  There is no set order of chapters.  There is no fixed number of chapters.  Each scribe seems to have selected the chapters which he considered useful.  The general title is: Chapters of the going forth by day.  The general character may be given by a paragraph attached to one of the chapters in the Book of Ani the Scribe [Edited by E. A. W. Budge, p. 26]: \"If this book be known on earth and written on the coffin, it is my mouth.  He shall come forth by day in any form he desires and he shall go into his place without being prevented.  There shall be given to him bread and beer and meat upon the altar of Osiris.  He shall enter in, in peace, to the field of Earu according to this decree of the one who is in the City of Dedu.  There shall be given to him wheat and barley there.  He shall flourish as he did upon earth.  He shall do his desires like these nine Gods who are in the underworld, as found true millions of times.  He is the Osiris: the Scribe Ani.\"  There are chapters to overcome all the evil which a soul may encounter; there are words to greet all the gods whom the soul desires to visit.  The Scribe Ani had an exceptional position on earth; he desires to do his desire in the other world; and in the names of Osiris he recites the magic words that bring him the power.  He is Ani, but he calls himself Osiris; just as the priestly doctor mixes his dose of medicine and calls it \"the eye of Horus tested and found true.\"  In addition to magical texts, there are also magical, or symbolic, objects placed in the graves,--amulets of various kinds which were to be used in the other world.  Some of these were simply the amulets used in daily life to guard against sickness, bite of snake, and other earthly evils which were also incident to the life after death.  Other amulets, like the so-called _Ushabtiu_, were to meet special conditions of the other world.  These _Ushabtiu_, or \"answerers,\" were little images of workmen bearing agricultural implements whose duty it was to take the place of the dead in the fields of Earu when Osiris as king called him to do his share of the field work.  Even the king appears liable to this service, and for him thousands of these figures were made,--sometimes labeled each with the day of the year.  In a few cases there was even a charm written on the figure to prevent it hearing the command of any one but its master.  Alongside these manifold manifestations of the belief in magic, other furniture--implements, weapons, and utensils--are still placed in the grave.  The offering places are still maintained. All burials are now extended on the back and wrapped in bandages. Yet the common graves lack "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12255"],["title","The Egyptian Conception of Immortality (#5)"],["body","receptacles for the viscera, lack magical texts, lack ushabtiu, and--in a word--lack all those things which are typical of the better-class graves of the period.  The conception of the future life among the common people is apparently not essentially different from that of the Old Empire.  But the books of the dead and the offering formulas show that the priests and high officials at death were called Osiris.  By the end of the Late Period the Osiris cult of the dead had come to be universal.  No doubt political events had much to do with this.  The absorption of the powers of the king by the priesthood of the national god Amon-Ra, the crushing of the nobility by a succession of foreign invaders, and the general uncertainty of life, had disturbed the old fixed relations.  The hope of every Egyptian turned to a glorified future life as Osiris.  The tendency to use magical texts and symbolic objects reached its height.  About 700 B.C. a revival of national life, brought about by the establishment of the Egyptian kings of Sais as kings of Egypt, led to a renaissance of Egyptian art.  The old monuments were copied and imitated, the old funerary texts and offering formulas were sought out in the older graves.  Even the pyramid texts reappear after one thousand years of practical oblivion. The value of master words was so firmly fixed in the Egyptian mind that misunderstood texts of all sorts were copied out and placed in the graves to secure to the dead some vague benefit in the other world.  The process of mummification was at its height.  The bodies were no longer preserved.  The process was merely the creation of a simulacrum of the dead Osiris So-and-So.  All the perishable parts of the body were removed or destroyed by chemicals.  Only the skin, bones, hair, and teeth remained to be padded with mud and resin, wrapped in cloths, covered with a painted and gilded _cartonnage_ to represent the glorified Osiris mummy.     VIII. THE PTOLEMAIC-ROMAN PERIOD   In the Ptolemaic-Roman period we see the final stage of the Osiris cult.  Every dead man is laid in his grave without furniture, prepared as a simulacrum of Osiris.  The wealthiest people have gilded and painted mummy cases with amulets and funerary papyrus.  The poorer are merely bundles of wrappings. Every dead man is Osiris, and no doubt carried with him words learned on earth to gain his way to a place in the kingdom of Osiris.  The offering places above the grave are still made and offerings are still brought.  To gain some idea of the way in which these two conceptions of the living dead were worked out in actual life, one has only to turn to the funerary customs of the modern Egyptians.  In the case of both Christians and Moslems, the grave rites are similar; but with those of the Moslems I am more familiar.  The grave consists still of the two parts, the burying place and the offering place. The swathed body is laid on the right side, with the right hand under the cheek and the face towards Mecca.  At the burial the confession of the faith is recited over and over, lest the dead forget it.  Korans are sometimes placed in the graves; and I have even seen a confession of the faith written on paper and placed on a twig before the face of the dead.  At the appointed seasons-- especially at the great Feast of Sacrifice--offerings are brought to the grave.  The family party passes through the cemetery, the women bearing baskets of bread and bottles of water, the men turning the head to the right and to the left and reciting the _fatha_ in propitiation of the spirits.  The party enters the offering inclosure of the grave of their relative.  The wives greet the dead--\"Peace unto thee, oh, my husband, oh, my father, we have wept until we have watered the earth with our tears on thy account.\" The offerings are laid before the tomb.  A scribe is called and recites or reads some chapter of the Koran over and over, one hundred, one hundred and fifty, five hundred, one thousand times, and concludes: \"I have read this for thee, oh, such and such a one.\" Or, \"I have transferred the merit of this to thee.\" When you question these people as to the particulars of their belief, you find their ideas vague and indefinite.  Among the men a dispute quickly starts,--the people who have been found good by the examining angels on the night of the burial are there, but the bad are somewhere else.  No, says another, they are all in their graves, but the bad suffer torment.  Still another maintains that the good have already passed to the lowest heaven.  These are all mere remnants of theological discussions caught from the sheikhs.  The women stolidly maintain that the dead are in their tombs and the offerings must be brought.  When you inquire which are the good and which are the bad, there is again a great divergence of opinion; but it is clear that every man believes in his heart that a knowledge of the prayers and forms of the Moslem religion is absolutely essential and entirely sufficient to gain a desirable future life.  The great master word is the confession of faith--there is no god but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet.  So it must have been in the last stage of the Osiris cult. Immortality, a glorified future existence as an Osiris in the kingdom of Osiris, with all the pleasures and comforts of life, was secured to him who was buried with the proper rites and knew the magic words.  And yet the old feeling was never lost that the dead was somehow in the grave and might suffer hunger and thirst.  When Christianity came into Egypt, all the gaudy apparatus of the Osiris religion was swept out of existence.  The body was to rise again and might not be mutilated.  Mummification, which destroyed the body in order to preserve a conventional simulacrum, ceased abruptly.  Grave furniture was of course unthinkable.  But the use of charms did not cease.  Crosses were embroidered in the gravecloths; or small crosses of metal or wood placed on the breast or arm; the gravestone bore a simple prayer to the Holy Spirit for the peaceful rest of the soul.  But the offering place was still maintained; prayers were recited on the feast days; lamps were allowed to remain at the grave; food was brought, but given to the poor.  In all periods there are thousands of graves of poor people without a single thing to secure their future life,--people who were probably content simply to lay down the burdens of life.  In the Christian period these thousands of unnamed dead all have one mark.  They are laid with their feet to the east.  Each one was a Christian and secure in his future life, according to his faith and his life on earth.     IX. SUMMARY   To sum up, the essential idea of the Egyptian conception of immortality was that the ghost or spirit of the man preserved the personality and the form of the man in the existence after death; that this spirit had the same desires, the same pleasures, the same necessities, and the same fears as on earth.  Life after death was a duplicate of life on earth.  On earth life depended on work, on getting food from the fields and the herds, on forming stone and metal, hide and vegetable fibre, into useful objects. In other words, life depended on human power over the natural materials of the earth.  At the same time there were many things which could not be controlled by power over the earth and its elements,--the sting of the scorpion, the bite of the adder, the rise of the Nile, sickness, the sudden onslaught of the enemy, the straying of cattle, the disfavor of the god.  For these evils man's only hope was magic,--the set words spoken in the proper manner which have power over all unseen influence.  So in the case of life after death, all which human strength can provide of stores of grain and drink and garments must be secured for his use; but he must also be provided with the magic words to meet the chance evils of the future life.  It is not surprising that the unknown future presented to the imagination many evils unknown on earth.  The spirit might forget its name, it might lose its heart, it might be bound fast by evil powers in the grave and unable to come forth by day.  The mummy might decay; the spirit might forget its form.  So, as time went on, the use of magic words became of greater and greater importance, until, to modern eyes, it seemed to overshadow all else in the Egyptian conception of life after death.  As a part of the magical provisions of the dead, the Osiris myth, probably built up in explanation of old rites, was drawn into the belief in a future life, and apparently at the beginning _solely for the benefit of the king_, for the benefit of those who claimed a certain divinity on earth.  The earth-god Osiris, god of the living, had died and had been brought to life as god of the dead.  So, also, the earth-king, the Horus, the son of Ra, must die, but he also would live again in the other world and share the throne of Osiris.  More than this even, he became Osiris.  He was admitted to the life of the gods.  Of course the ideas of the existence of the gods were never clear and consistent.  They lived in secret places, their whole life was mysterious as well as powerful.  These are the field of knowledge which the Egyptian mind could not oversee with any satisfaction to itself.  The most it could do was to formulate the magic words, invoking the names of the gods and conjuring them by the events in the Osiris myth to accept this king as Osiris.  The exceptional man, the super-man, must have an exceptional future life; but to obtain it, he must have the knowledge of the names and words necessary to force the powers of the other world.  Thus the idea of an exceptional future life, a heaven, was brought into the Egyptian conception of life after death. Admission to it depended on the exceptional position on earth of those admitted.  As even this exceptional position was only of avail when combined with the knowledge of certain"]]]
