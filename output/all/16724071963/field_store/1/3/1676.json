He was ramming a post--Andy rammed honestly, from the bottom of the hole, not the last few shovelfuls below the surface, as some do. He was ramming the last layer of clay when a cloud of white dust came along the road, paused, and drifted or poured off into the scrub, leaving long Dave Bentley, the horse-breaker, on his last victim.  “'Ello, Andy! Graftin'?”  “I want to speak to you, Dave,” said Andy, in a strange voice.  “All--all right!” said Dave, rather puzzled. He got down, wondering what was up, and hung his horse to the last post but one.  Dave was Andy's opposite in one respect: he jumped to conclusions, as women do; but, unlike women, he was mostly wrong. He was an old chum and mate of Andy's who had always liked, admired, and trusted him. But now, to his helpless surprise, Andy went on scraping the earth from the surface with his long-handled shovel, and heaping it conscientiously round the butt of the post, his face like a block of wood, and his lips set grimly. Dave broke out first (with bush oaths):  “What's the matter with you? Spit it out! What have I been doin' to you? What's yer got yer rag out about, anyway?”  Andy faced him suddenly, with hatred for “funny business” flashing in his eyes.  “What did you say to my sister Mary about Lizzie Porter?”  Dave started; then he whistled long and low. “Spit it all out, Andy!” he advised.  “You said she was travellin' with a feller!”  “Well, what's the harm in that? Everybody knows that--”  “If any crawler says a word about Lizzie Porter--look here, me and you's got to fight, Dave Bentley!” Then, with still greater vehemence, as though he had a share in the garment: “Take off that coat!”  “Not if I know it!” said Dave, with the sudden quietness that comes to brave but headstrong and impulsive men at a critical moment: “Me and you ain't goin' to fight, Andy; and” (with sudden energy) “if you try it on I'll knock you into jim-rags!”  Then, stepping close to Andy and taking him by the arm: “Andy, this thing will have to be fixed up. Come here; I want to talk to you.” And he led him some paces aside, inside the boundary line, which seemed a ludicrously unnecessary precaution, seeing that there was no one within sight or hearing save Dave's horse.  “Now, look here, Andy; let's have it over. What's the matter with you and Lizzie Porter?”  “I'M travellin' with her, that's all; and we're going to get married in two years!”  Dave gave vent to another long, low whistle. He seemed to think and make up his mind.  “Now, look here, Andy: we're old mates, ain't we?”  “Yes; I know that.”  “And do you think I'd tell you a blanky lie, or crawl behind your back? Do you? Spit it out!”  “N--no, I don't!”  “I've always stuck up for you, Andy, and--why, I've fought for you behind your back!”  “I know that, Dave.”  “There's my hand on it!”  Andy took his friend's hand mechanically, but gripped it hard.  “Now, Andy, I'll tell you straight: It's Gorstruth about Lizzie Porter!”  They stood as they were for a full minute, hands clasped; Andy with his jaw dropped and staring in a dazed sort of way at Dave. He raised his disengaged hand helplessly to his thatch, gulped suspiciously, and asked in a broken voice:  “How--how do you know it, Dave?”  “Know it? Andy, I SEEN 'EM MESELF!”  “You did, Dave?” in a tone that suggested sorrow more than anger at Dave's part in the seeing of them.  “Gorstruth, Andy!”      .   .   .   .   .  “Tell me, Dave, who was the feller? That's all I want to know.”  “I can't tell you that. I only seen them when I was canterin' past in the dusk.”  “Then how'd you know it was a man at all?”  “It wore trousers, anyway, and was as big as you; so it couldn't have been a girl. I'm pretty safe to swear it was Mick Kelly. I saw his horse hangin' up at Porter's once or twice. But I'll tell you what I'll do: I'll find out for you, Andy. And, what's more, I'll job him for you if I catch him!”  Andy said nothing; his hands clenched and his chest heaved. Dave laid a friendly hand on his shoulder.  “It's red hot, Andy, I know. Anybody else but you and I wouldn't have cared. But don't be a fool; there's any Gorsquantity of girls knockin' round. You just give it to her straight and chuck her, and have done with it. You must be bad off to bother about her. Gorstruth! she ain't much to look at anyway! I've got to ride like blazes to catch the coach. Don't knock off till I come back; I won't be above an hour. I'm goin' to give you some points in case you've got to fight Mick; and I'll have to be there to back you!” And, thus taking the right moment instinctively, he jumped on his horse and galloped on towards the town.  His dust-cloud had scarcely disappeared round a corner of the paddocks when Andy was aware of another one coming towards him. He had a dazed idea that it was Dave coming back, but went on digging another post-hole, mechanically, until a spring-cart rattled up, and stopped opposite him. Then he lifted his head. It was Lizzie herself, driving home from town. She turned towards him with her usual faint smile. Her small features were “washed out” and rather haggard.  “'Ello, Andy!”  But, at the sight of her, all his hatred of “funny business”--intensified, perhaps, by a sense of personal injury--came to a head, and he exploded:  “Look here, Lizzie Porter! I know all about you. You needn't think you're goin' to cotton on with me any more after this! I wouldn't be seen in a paddock with yer! I'm satisfied about you! Get on out of this!”  The girl stared at him for a moment thunderstruck; then she lammed into the old horse with a stick she carried in place of a whip.  She cried, and wondered what she'd done, and trembled so that she could scarcely unharness the horse, and wondered if Andy had got a touch of the sun, and went in and sat down and cried again; and pride came to her aid and she hated Andy; thought of her big brother, away droving, and made a cup of tea. She shed tears over the tea, and went through it all again.  Meanwhile Andy was suffering a reaction. He started to fill the hole before he put the post in; then to ram the post before the rails were in position. Dubbing off the ends of the rails, he was in danger of amputating a toe or a foot with every stroke of the adze. And, at last, trying to squint along the little lumps of clay which he had placed in the centre of the top of each post for several panels back--to assist him to take a line--he found that they swam and doubled, and ran off in watery angles, for his eyes were too moist to see straight and single.  Then he threw down the tools hopelessly, and was standing helplessly undecided whether to go home or go down to the creek and drown himself, when Dave turned up again.  “Seen her?” asked Dave.  “Yes,” said Andy.  “Did you chuck her?”  “Look here, Dave; are you sure the feller was Mick Kelly?”  “I never said I was. How was I to know? It was dark. You don't expect I'd 'fox' a feller I see doing a bit of a bear-up to a girl, do you? It might have been you, for all I knowed. I suppose she's been talking you round?”  “No, she ain't,” said Andy. “But, look here, Dave; I was properly gone on that girl, I was, and--and I want to be sure I'm right.”  The business was getting altogether too psychological for Dave Bentley. “You might as well,” he rapped out, “call me a liar at once!”  “'Taint that at all, Dave. I want to get at who the feller is; that's what I want to get at now. Where did you see them, and when?”  “I seen them Anniversary night, along the road, near Ross' farm; and I seen 'em Sunday night afore that--in the trees near the old culvert--near Porter's sliprails; and I seen 'em one night outside Porter's, on a log near the woodheap. They was thick that time, and bearin' up proper, and no mistake. So I can swear to her. Now, are you satisfied about her?”  But Andy was wildly pitchforking his thatch under his hat with all ten fingers and staring at Dave, who began to regard him uneasily; then there came to Andy's eyes an awful glare, which caused Dave to step back hastily.  “Good God, Andy! Are yer goin' ratty?”  “No!” cried Andy, wildly.  “Then what the blazes is the matter with you? You'll have rats if you don't look out!”  “JIMMINY FROTH!--It was ME all the time!”  “What?”  “It was me that was with her all them nights. It was me that you seen. WHY, I POPPED ON THE WOODHEAP!”  Dave was taken too suddenly to whistle this time.  “And you went for her just now?”  “Yes!” yelled Andy.  “Well--you've done it!”  “Yes,” said Andy, hopelessly; “I've done it!”  Dave whistled now--a very long, low whistle. “Well, you're a bloomin' goat, Andy, after this. But this thing'll have to be fixed up!” and he cantered away. Poor Andy was too badly knocked to notice the abruptness of Dave's departure, or to see that he turned through the sliprails on to the track that led to Porter's.      .   .   .   .   .  Half an hour later Andy appeared at Porter's back door, with an expression on his face as though the funeral was to start in ten minutes. In a tone befitting such an occasion, he wanted to see Lizzie.  Dave had been there with the laudable determination of fixing the business up, and had, of course, succeeded in making it much worse than it was before. But Andy made it all right.     The Iron-Bark Chip    Dave Regan and party--bush-fencers, tank-sinkers, rough carpenters, &c.--were finishing the third and last culvert of their contract on the last section of the new railway line, and had already sent in their vouchers for the completed contract, so that there might be no excuse for extra delay in connection with the cheque.  Now it had been expressly stipulated in the plans and specifications that the timber for certain beams and girders was to be iron-bark and no other, and Government inspectors were authorised to order the removal from the ground of any timber or material they might deem inferior, or not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1231"],["title","On the Track (#5)"],["body"," accordance with the stipulations. The railway contractor's foreman and inspector of sub-contractors was a practical man and a bushman, but he had been a timber-getter himself; his sympathies were bushy, and he was on winking terms with Dave Regan. Besides, extended time was expiring, and the contractors were in a hurry to complete the line. But the Government inspector was a reserved man who poked round on his independent own and appeared in lonely spots at unexpected times--with apparently no definite object in life--like a grey kangaroo bothered by a new wire fence, but unsuspicious of the presence of humans. He wore a grey suit, rode, or mostly led, an ashen-grey horse; the grass was long and grey, so he was seldom spotted until he was well within the horizon and bearing leisurely down on a party of sub-contractors, leading his horse.  Now iron-bark was scarce and distant on those ridges, and another timber, similar in appearance, but much inferior in grain and “standing”  quality, was plentiful and close at hand. Dave and party were “about full of” the job and place, and wanted to get their cheque and be gone to another “spec” they had in view. So they came to reckon they'd get the last girder from a handy tree, and have it squared, in place, and carefully and conscientiously tarred before the inspector happened along, if he did. But they didn't. They got it squared, and ready to be lifted into its place; the kindly darkness of tar was ready to cover a fraud that took four strong men with crowbars and levers to shift; and now (such is the regular cussedness of things) as the fraudulent piece of timber lay its last hour on the ground, looking and smelling, to their guilty imaginations like anything but iron-bark, they were aware of the Government inspector drifting down upon them obliquely, with something of the atmosphere of a casual Bill or Jim who had dropped out of his easy-going track to see how they were getting on, and borrow a match. They had more than half hoped that, as he had visited them pretty frequently during the progress of the work, and knew how near it was to completion, he wouldn't bother coming any more. But it's the way with the Government. You might move heaven and earth in vain endeavour to get the “Guvermunt” to flutter an eyelash over something of the most momentous importance to yourself and mates and the district--even to the country; but just when you are leaving authority severely alone, and have strong reasons for not wanting to worry or interrupt it, and not desiring it to worry about you, it will take a fancy into its head to come along and bother.  “It's always the way!” muttered Dave to his mates. “I knew the beggar would turn up!... And the only cronk log we've had, too!” he added, in an injured tone. “If this had 'a' been the only blessed iron-bark in the whole contract, it would have been all right.... Good-day, sir!” (to the inspector). “It's hot?”  The inspector nodded. He was not of an impulsive nature. He got down from his horse and looked at the girder in an abstracted way; and presently there came into his eyes a dreamy, far-away, sad sort of expression, as if there had been a very sad and painful occurrence in his family, way back in the past, and that piece of timber in some way reminded him of it and brought the old sorrow home to him. He blinked three times, and asked, in a subdued tone:  “Is that iron-bark?”  Jack Bentley, the fluent liar of the party, caught his breath with a jerk and coughed, to cover the gasp and gain time. “I--iron-bark? Of course it is! I thought you would know iron-bark, mister.” (Mister was silent.) “What else d'yer think it is?”  The dreamy, abstracted expression was back. The inspector, by-the-way, didn't know much about timber, but he had a great deal of instinct, and went by it when in doubt.  “L--look here, mister!” put in Dave Regan, in a tone of innocent puzzlement and with a blank bucolic face. “B--but don't the plans and specifications say iron-bark? Ours does, anyway. I--I'll git the papers from the tent and show yer, if yer like.”  It was not necessary. The inspector admitted the fact slowly. He stooped, and with an absent air picked up a chip. He looked at it abstractedly for a moment, blinked his threefold blink; then, seeming to recollect an appointment, he woke up suddenly and asked briskly:  “Did this chip come off that girder?”  Blank silence. The inspector blinked six times, divided in threes, rapidly, mounted his horse, said “Day,” and rode off.  Regan and party stared at each other.  “Wha--what did he do that for?” asked Andy Page, the third in the party.  “Do what for, you fool?” enquired Dave.  “Ta--take that chip for?”  “He's taking it to the office!” snarled Jack Bentley.  “What--what for? What does he want to do that for?”  “To get it blanky well analysed! You ass! Now are yer satisfied?” And Jack sat down hard on the timber, jerked out his pipe, and said to Dave, in a sharp, toothache tone:  “Gimmiamatch!”  “We--well! what are we to do now?” enquired Andy, who was the hardest grafter, but altogether helpless, hopeless, and useless in a crisis like this.  “Grain and varnish the bloomin' culvert!” snapped Bentley.  But Dave's eyes, that had been ruefully following the inspector, suddenly dilated. The inspector had ridden a short distance along the line, dismounted, thrown the bridle over a post, laid the chip (which was too big to go in his pocket) on top of it, got through the fence, and was now walking back at an angle across the line in the direction of the fencing party, who had worked up on the other side, a little more than opposite the culvert.  Dave took in the lay of the country at a glance and thought rapidly.  “Gimme an iron-bark chip!” he said suddenly.  Bentley, who was quick-witted when the track was shown him, as is a kangaroo dog (Jack ran by sight, not scent), glanced in the line of Dave's eyes, jumped up, and got a chip about the same size as that which the inspector had taken.  Now the “lay of the country” sloped generally to the line from both sides, and the angle between the inspector's horse, the fencing party, and the culvert was well within a clear concave space; but a couple of hundred yards back from the line and parallel to it (on the side on which Dave's party worked their timber) a fringe of scrub ran to within a few yards of a point which would be about in line with a single tree on the cleared slope, the horse, and the fencing party.  Dave took the iron-bark chip, ran along the bed of the water-course into the scrub, raced up the siding behind the bushes, got safely, though without breathing, across the exposed space, and brought the tree into line between him and the inspector, who was talking to the fencers. Then he began to work quickly down the slope towards the tree (which was a thin one), keeping it in line, his arms close to his sides, and working, as it were, down the trunk of the tree, as if the fencing party were kangaroos and Dave was trying to get a shot at them. The inspector, by-the-bye, had a habit of glancing now and then in the direction of his horse, as though under the impression that it was flighty and restless and inclined to bolt on opportunity. It was an anxious moment for all parties concerned--except the inspector. They didn't want HIM to be perturbed. And, just as Dave reached the foot of the tree, the inspector finished what he had to say to the fencers, turned, and started to walk briskly back to his horse. There was a thunderstorm coming. Now was the critical moment--there were certain prearranged signals between Dave's party and the fencers which might have interested the inspector, but none to meet a case like this.  Jack Bentley gasped, and started forward with an idea of intercepting the inspector and holding him for a few minutes in bogus conversation. Inspirations come to one at a critical moment, and it flashed on Jack's mind to send Andy instead. Andy looked as innocent and guileless as he was, but was uncomfortable in the vicinity of “funny business”, and must have an honest excuse. “Not that that mattered,” commented Jack afterwards; “it would have taken the inspector ten minutes to get at what Andy was driving at, whatever it was.”  “Run, Andy! Tell him there's a heavy thunderstorm coming and he'd better stay in our humpy till it's over. Run! Don't stand staring like a blanky fool. He'll be gone!”  Andy started. But just then, as luck would have it, one of the fencers started after the inspector, hailing him as “Hi, mister!” He wanted to be set right about the survey or something--or to pretend to want to be set right--from motives of policy which I haven't time to explain here.  That fencer explained afterwards to Dave's party that he “seen what you coves was up to,” and that's why he called the inspector back. But he told them that after they had told their yarn--which was a mistake.  “Come back, Andy!” cried Jack Bentley.  Dave Regan slipped round the tree, down on his hands and knees, and made quick time through the grass which, luckily, grew pretty tall on the thirty or forty yards of slope between the tree and the horse. Close to the horse, a thought struck Dave that pulled him up, and sent a shiver along his spine and a hungry feeling under it. The horse would break away and bolt! But the case was desperate. Dave ventured an interrogatory “Cope, cope, cope?” The horse turned its head wearily and regarded him with a mild eye, as if he'd expected him to come, and come on all fours, and wondered what had kept him so long; then he went on thinking. Dave reached the foot of the post; the horse obligingly leaning over on the other leg. Dave reared head and shoulders cautiously behind the post, like a snake; his hand went up twice, swiftly--the first time he grabbed the inspector's chip, and the second time he put the iron-bark one in its place. He drew down and back, and scuttled off for the tree like a gigantic tailless “goanna”.  A few"]]]
