It was just at the end of this conversation that the lads had joined the crowd before the palace, and Chester had made the remark that opens this story.     CHAPTER III.  THE MOB.   Hal sat up and passed his right hand gently over his head.  \"Quite a bump,\" he muttered to himself. \"What a fool I was not to have been prepared for that ruse. Well, I'll know better next time.\"  The lad pulled himself to his feet and gazed in the direction in which the other had disappeared. He made as if to move after him, and then changed his mind.  \"Not much chance of finding him now, I guess,\" he muttered.  He turned on his heel, and then, for the first time, his eyes fell upon Chester's prostrate form.  \"So he got you, too, eh?\" he said to himself.  He hurried forward and bent over his chum. At the same moment Chester opened his eyes and smiled up at him feebly.  \"Hello,\" he said; \"where's our friend?\"  \"Gone,\" replied Hal briefly, raising Chester's head to his knee. \"How do you feel?\"  \"A little rocky, and that's a fact,\" was the reply.  \"What did he bump you over with--gun?\"  \"No; fist.\"  \"I don't see any marks.\"  \"I feel 'em,\" said Chester, rubbing his chin ruefully. \"He landed an uppercut that was a beauty.\"  \"I am glad you are well enough to appreciate it,\" said Hal, with a slight smile. \"He was big enough to have put you out for keeps.\"  \"I'm not to be gotten rid of so easily,\" returned Chester. \"Help me up.\"  Hal lent a supporting hand and Chester struggled to his feet.  \"Dizzy?\" queried Hal.  \"A little,\" was the reply. \"I'll be all right in a minute, though.\"  He shook his head several times and at last appeared to have gotten rid of the effects of the blow. He threw off Hal's hand.  \"Well, what now?\" he asked.  Hal hesitated.  \"I hate to see that fellow get away,\" he said finally. \"He probably has stolen important information.\"  \"I guess there is not much doubt of that,\" replied Chester, \"but Rome is a pretty sizeable town. A slim chance we have of finding him.\"  \"I'd know him if I see him,\" said Hal  \"So will I. Did you notice the scar across his face?\"  \"Yes; that's why I say I would know him any place. What do you suppose it was he stole?\"  \"A paper of some kind; I saw that. Probably has to do with troop movements or something of the sort. You remember he stole it from an army officer.\"  \"Yes; which reminds me that he also disposed of said army officer without much trouble. The last I saw of him he was floundering about on the ground in the midst of the crowd.\"  \"Let's go back and have a look for him.\"  \"Good; come on.\"  The boys turned and retraced their steps. Rounding a corner they came again within sight of the palace.  \"Crowd still there,\" Hal commented briefly.  It was true. The crowd seemed to have grown rather than to have diminished.  \"Something must have happened while we were gone,\" said Chester. \"Hear them yell.\"  \"I guess it means war,\" was Hal's quiet response. \"Well, I'm glad.\"  \"And so am I. This German business should be settled without much trouble now.\"  \"Don't you believe it. The Kaiser is good for a long, hard fight yet.\"  They pushed their way through the crowd. Suddenly they came to a stop, their further progress being barred by a solid mass of humanity directly in front of them, Hal took Chester by the arm.  \"Let's see what is going on here,\" he said.  By dint of hard pushing and shoving they worked their way gradually through the crowd.  \"As I live, it's our friend the army officer,\" ejaculated Hal.  \"So it is,\" agreed Chester, \"and he seems to be rather excited. Look at him waving his arms about.\"  Surrounded by a curious crowd, the officer referred to was declaiming eloquently. It was plain from the attitude of the crowd, however, that he wasn't making himself plain.  \"He's too excited to talk coherently,\" said Hal. \"Maybe we can help him out a bit. Let's get through the rest of this gang.\"  He put his elbows in front of him, and closely followed by Chester, threw his weight upon the mass of humanity in front. The crowd parted, and the lads pushed their way through, unheeding the protests their rough methods called forth. They stopped beside the still excited officer.  \"Signor--\" began Hal, but the officer paid no attention to him, and continued to wave his arms violently about.  \"You can't get his attention that way,\" said Chester. \"Let me try.\"  He grasped the Italian officer roughly by the arm and whirled him about.  Immediately the latter's arms ceased their violent gesticulations and he turned an angry face upon Chester.  \"How dare you lay your hands upon an officer of the king?\" he demanded in a harsh voice.  His hand dropped to his holster.  \"Here! Here!\" exclaimed Hal. \"Hold your horses now and don't get excited. We've come to tell you something about that paper you lost.\"  \"Ah!\" cried the Italian. \"So you have it, eh? Give it to me!\"  He held out a hand expectantly.  \"No, we haven't it,\" replied Hal, \"but--\"  \"Give me the paper!\" cried the officer, his voice becoming shrill with anger.  \"I tell you we haven't the paper,\" said Hal.  \"That's a lie!\" shouted the Italian. \"You knocked me down and stole the paper.\"  He clutched Hal by the arm.  \"Let go of me,\" said the lad angrily. \"We are trying to help you and--\"  The Italian officer now suddenly drew his revolver, and pointed it squarely at Hal.  \"Give me the paper or I shall shoot,\" he said more quietly.  He staggered suddenly backward and the revolver dropped to the ground with a clatter. The Italian wheeled and confronted the angry face of Chester, who had struck up the weapon.  \"What's the matter with you? Can't you see we are trying to help you?\" demanded Chester.  At this point there came a diversion. Members of the crowd who had witnessed the dispute between the officer and the two lads suddenly set up a cry of \"spies.\"  Others behind them took it up.  \"Spies! Spies!\" a hundred voices rang out.  The crowd surged in about them.  Hal gave one quick look about, and then said quietly to Chester:  \"We are in for it now, old man. We'll have to make a break for it.\"  \"All right,\" said Chester grimly. \"Lead the way.\"  Once more the Italian officer stretched forth a detaining hand, but this time Hal wasted no time in explanation. He struck out straight from the shoulder, and the officer toppled to the ground.  \"Second fall for him to-day,\" muttered Hal between his teeth.  He felt Chester's arm press his elbow.  \"Come on,\" he said.  Side by side the lads stepped forward in the very faces of the mob that barred their path, and for a moment the crowd gave back. Then one man, bolder than the rest, sprang forward and sought to clutch Chester's arm. The lad's fist met him half way and he dropped silently to the ground.  An angry roar went up from the crowd.  Chester's hand dropped to his pocket. Hal perceived the motion and cried out:  \"No guns, Chester!\"  Chester realized the soundness of the warning and his revolver remained where it was.  Two of the crowd sprang forward together, but Hal and Chester, with their greater strength and reach, disposed of them easily. A blow from behind landed on Chester's neck and he staggered forward. He recovered himself in a moment, however, and shouted.  \"Rush 'em, Hal!\"  The latter also realized that to stand still and fight gave the crowd behind too great an opening and he obeyed Chester's injunction. At the same moment both sprang forward, and the crowd opened before them.  Straight ahead they went, striking out right and left, but rushing forward as fast as possible all the time. Men fell on both sides of them beneath their heavy blows, and so far neither lad had received a severe jolt.  At that moment, however, Hal felt a keen pain in his left arm. He glanced down curiously and saw a tiny stream of red spout forth. His lips set in a thin line.  \"Guns, Chester,\" he said quietly, halting in his tracks. \"They are using knives.\"  \"Good,\" said Chester, also halting. \"Back to back.\"  The lads whipped out their automatics simultaneously, and, back to back, confronted the crowd. Hal spoke.  \"We are not spies,\" he shouted, \"but we are not going to be killed without a fight. We are British army officers. Stand back!\"  Before the threatening muzzles of the two automatics the crowd hesitated. Then, from directly ahead of Chester, a shot rang out. The lad heard something whiz past his head, and from beyond came a cry of pain.  \"Shot one of his own number,\" muttered the lad.  His finger tightened on the trigger as he saw a man about to leap forward regardless of the automatic.  \"I'm going to shoot, Hal,\" he called.  \"I guess it can't be helped,\" replied the lad quietly. \"When I give the word turn loose on 'em, and then we'll make another break.\"  He hesitated a single instant and then called:  \"Ready?\"  \"Ready!\" came the reply.  \"Then--\" began Hal, and suddenly cried, \"Wait!\"  For at that moment the crowd in front of him suddenly began to scatter, and from beyond Hal made out a troop of Italian cavalry bearing down on them with drawn sabers. Hal lowered his weapon and called out:  \"It's all right, Chester!\"     CHAPTER IV.  AN OLD FRIEND.   \"What's the meaning of this?\" demanded an officer, pulling in his horse beside the two lads, while his troop gave their attention to driving back the crowd, which gave ground slowly.  \"We were attacked by the crowd, captain,\" Hal explained.  \"Why?\" asked the officer.  \"We were accused of being spies.\"  \"By whom?\"  \"By an Italian army officer back there,\" replied Hal, making a gesture with his hand.  \"Here he comes now,\" interrupted Chester.  The man who had caused all the trouble now came pompously forward. At sight of him, the mounted officer sprang from the saddle and came to attention.  \"What is the matter, sir?\" he asked.  \"Arrest these two,\" said his superior, pointing to Hal and Chester. \"They are spies, and they knocked me down.\"  The Italian"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12682"],["title","The Boy Allies in Great Peril; Or, With the Italian Army in the Alps (#3)"],["body"," motioned to half a dozen of his men. He also pointed to the two lads.  \"Arrest them,\" he said quietly.  The men surrounded the lads.  \"But--\" began Chester.  \"No words,\" said the officer. \"Take them before General Ferrari,\" he ordered his men.  He motioned to the commander of the troop to accompany them.  \"I shall be there to make the charge against them,\" he said.  The young officer saluted.  \"Very well, sir,\" he replied. He turned to the lads. \"March,\" he ordered.  There was no help for it, as the lads realized in a moment. Accordingly they made no further protests and marched off, surrounded on all sides.  As they walked along the street there came a new diversion. A man came hurrying toward them. Hal and Chester recognized him in an instant.  \"Uncle John!\" cried Chester.  He glanced at Hal and smiled sheepishly.  \"We seem always to be in trouble when he appears,\" said Chester with a slight smile.  Uncle John addressed the officer in command of the squad.  \"What's the meaning of this?\" he demanded.  \"The meaning of what, sir?\" asked the officer respectfully, for he was impressed by Uncle John's manner.  \"What are you doing with these two lads?\"  \"They are under arrest, sir.\"  \"What!\" ejaculated Uncle John. \"Under arrest, and what for?\"  \"They are spies.\"  \"Spies!\" The good man staggered back. He forced a smile. \"You are joking with me,\" he said.  The Italian officer drew himself up.  \"I never joke of serious matters,\" he said quietly. \"But what interest have you in these prisoners?\"  \"Well, I have considerable interest,\" was the reply. \"One of them happens to be my nephew. What have they been doing?\"  \"I couldn't say as to that. All I know is that they are spies.\"  \"You're crazy,\" shouted Uncle John, now becoming angry. \"They are British army officers, and American citizens.\"  The young officer drew himself up.  \"Crazy, am I?\" he demanded. \"March!\" he ordered his men.  \"Here, hold on a minute,\" gasped Uncle John. \"I didn't mean to ruffle your feelings; but one of those boys is my nephew. I tell you they are British officers.\"  \"I trust they will be able to prove it,\" said the Italian.  \"What?\" demanded Uncle John. \"Why?\"  \"Because,\" replied the officer with a pleasant smile, \"they probably will be shot if they don't.\"  \"Shot!\" gasped Uncle John.  \"Exactly. That is the usual treatment accorded spies.\"  \"But I tell you--\"  \"You can tell the rest to General Ferrari,\" said the Italian officer. \"Forward, men.\"  Uncle John was brushed unceremoniously aside in spite of his protests, and the lads were led away.  \"Don't worry, Uncle John,\" Chester called back to him. \"We'll get out of this all right. Tell mother to have no fear.\"  \"I'll see the ambassador!\" shouted Uncle John. \"I'll get you out of this. I'll show these confounded Italians they are not half as big as Uncle Sam.\"  \"Poor old Uncle John,\" said Chester to Hal. \"He does get excited so easily. I'll bet the ambassador is due for an unpleasant half hour.\"  \"I'd give a whole lot to be there to hear what transpires,\" agreed Hal.  In front of a large and imposing building the Italian officer called a halt; and a few minutes later ordered the prisoners up the steps.  \"Where are we going?\" demanded Hal.  \"You'll find out soon enough,\" was the reply.  \"You're very civil and courteous, to be sure,\" said Hal.  \"I can see no reason for being courteous to a spy,\" replied the officer.  \"Perhaps not,\" returned the lad; \"but when we are out of this I believe I shall hunt you up and pull your nose.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed the officer, stepping back. \"Pull my nose! Such American impudence! I have a notion to pull your nose right here.\"  \"I wouldn't if I were you,\" said Chester, grinning.  \"And what have you to say about it?\" exclaimed the now angry officer.  \"Oh, nothing,\" replied Chester. \"Just a kindly word of warning; that's all.\"  The officer stared at both lads angrily, as they stood at the top of the steps, and seemed about to say more, when a second officer appeared in the doorway and motioned for all to enter.  \"Move on there,\" said the first officer angrily.  The lads obeyed without replying.  Inside the building they were led through a long corridor, and thence to a room which they were motioned to enter. Inside stood a tall, stout man attired in full military uniform.  \"General Ferrari, I guess,\" Chester whispered to his friend.  Hal nodded in assent. It was indeed General Ferrari, and he came forward.  \"What have we here?\" he demanded, addressing the officer.  \"Spies, sir,\" was the reply.  \"Where did you find them?\"  The officer explained.  \"So Colonel Fuesco found them, eh? You say they stole an important document from him?\"  \"Yes, sir, and the colonel will be here directly, sir.\"  \"Good, you may go. Leave a guard outside the door.\"  The officer saluted and took his departure, casting a sneering glance at the two lads.  \"Sit down,\" commanded the general.  The lads obeyed, and the general took a seat at a huge desk at the far end of the room and immediately plunged into a mass of correspondence. For half an hour he was busy with his letters and paid no attention to the boys. The latter also sat silently.  An orderly entered the room and announced:  \"Colonel Fuesco, sir.\"  \"Show him in,\" said the general.  A moment later and the colonel came blustering in. He gazed angrily at the two lads and spoke to General Ferrari in a whisper. Then both turned upon the lads.  \"Have you the paper?\" demanded the general.  \"No, sir,\" replied Hal. \"We never had it in the first place. Will you allow me to explain, sir?\"  \"Proceed,\" said the general.  \"First,\" said Hal, \"I would inform your excellency that we are officers in the British army, having recently come from France.\"  He then went ahead with the story of how they had seen Colonel Fuesco relieved of his papers before the palace a short time ago. At the conclusion of the story the colonel sniffed audibly.  \"A likely tale,\" he sneered.  \"Silence, colonel,\" said the general sharply. \"I shall go at this matter in my own way. Can you prove your identity?\" he asked of Hal.  \"With time, yes,\" was the reply.  At this moment the orderly again entered the room.  \"The officer you were expecting, sir,\" he said to General Ferrari.  \"Have him enter,\" said the general, and the orderly saluted and disappeared.  \"There can be no doubt that these are spies, sir,\" said Colonel Fuesco.  Chester became suddenly angry.  \"That's a lie,\" he said flatly.  \"What!\" exclaimed the doughty colonel. \"You call me a liar?\"  Before General Ferrari or Hal could move to stay him, he stepped close to Chester and struck him in the face.  Hal, knowing Chester's quick temper, became alarmed and cried out sharply:  \"Don't hit him, Chester.\"  But he spoke too late. The blow aroused Chester's fighting blood and he took no thought of consequences. His right fist shot out sharply, and struck squarely upon the nose, the colonel reeled back and fell to the floor.  He was up in a moment, however, and in spite of his commander's sharp order, closed with Chester. The two rocked back and forth, as Hal and General Ferrari sought to separate them.  And at this moment a newcomer entered the room. He was a young man, thin and tall, and his face showed the marks of hard service. He was attired in the uniform of a French major. He, too, took a hand in attempting to separate the combatants.  As the five struggled about, Hal caught a glimpse of the newcomer's face, and he gave a cry of wonder, uttering a name that caused Chester to release his hold upon the Italian officer and step back in surprise and pleasure.  \"Major Derevaux!\" exclaimed Hal.     CHAPTER V.  A NEW RECRUIT.   The French officer also stepped back in surprise, for until that moment he had not had time to glance at the two lads. He, too, gave vent to an exclamation of pleasure and held out both hands.  \"Hal! Chester!\" he cried.  Each lad seized upon a hand and wrung it heartily. General Ferrari and Colonel Fuesco stood back and eyed them curiously. Finally the general spoke to the Frenchman.  \"You know these boys?\" he asked.  \"Know them!\" repeated Major Derevaux. \"Well, I should say I do. They are Lieutenants Paine and Crawford, of His British majesty's service, sir.\"  \"Then they are not German or Austrian spies?\"  \"What! These lads German spies! If you but knew of what invaluable service they have been to the cause of the Allies, you would be proud to shake hands with them. Why, let me tell you,\" and forgetting all other matters for the moment, Major Derevaux plunged into an account of the boys' triumphs since joining the allied forces.  At the conclusion of this recital, General Ferrari extended a hand to each of the boys.  \"I am indeed glad to know two such gallant lads,\" he said. \"I felt sure when I first saw you that there must be some mistake in your cases.\"  \"But they stole my paper!\" cried Colonel Fuesco.  \"That is not true,\" said Major Derevaux. \"I can vouch for their loyalty.\"  \"But who can vouch for you?\" demanded the colonel. \"How is General Ferrari to know that you, too, are not a spy, coming to him with false credentials?\"  \"I can answer that question,\" replied the general. \"As it happens, I have known Major Derevaux for years. He has often visited at my home, he and his parents. You owe these lads an apology, colonel.\"  \"He knocked me down,\" replied the colonel, pointing to Chester.  \"So he did,\" said the general, \"and you deserved it.\"  Chester now approached the colonel and extended a hand.  \"I bear you no ill will,\" he said.  The officer glanced at him searchingly for a moment, and then took the hand.  \"I have done you and your friend an injustice,\" he said. \"I am sorry.\"  \"Say no more about it,\" replied Chester.  Colonel Fuesco also shook hands with Hal.  \"But what of my paper?\" he demanded of the general.  \"I can give you a description of the man who took it,\" said Hal, and did so. When he mentioned that the man had a scar on his face, the two Italian officers uttered a cry.  \"Hans Robard!\" they "]]]
