We came       together to the great ravine behind the Theatre. It is empty save       for trees and weeds. Beyond the ravine there is a plain, and       beyond the plain there lies the Uncharted Forest, about which men       must not think.        We were gathering the papers and the rags which the wind had       blown from the Theatre, when we saw an iron bar among the weeds.       It was old and rusted by many rains. We pulled with all our       strength, but we could not move it. So we called International       4-8818, and together we scraped the earth around the bar. Of a       sudden the earth fell in before us, and we saw an old iron grill       over a black hole.        International 4-8818 stepped back. But we pulled at the grill and       it gave way. And then we saw iron rings as steps leading down a       shaft into a darkness without bottom.        “We shall go down,” we said to International 4-8818.        “It is forbidden,” they answered.        We said: “The Council does not know of this hole, so it cannot be       forbidden.”        And they answered: “Since the Council does not know of this hole,       there can be no law permitting to enter it. And everything which       is not permitted by law is forbidden.”        But we said: “We shall go, none the less.”        They were frightened, but they stood by and watched us go.        We hung on the iron rings with our hands and our feet. We could       see nothing below us. And above us the hole open upon the sky       grew smaller and smaller, till it came to be the size of a       button. But still we went down. Then our foot touched the ground.       We rubbed our eyes, for we could not see. Then our eyes became       used to the darkness, but we could not believe what we saw.        No men known to us could have built this place, nor the men known       to our brothers who lived before us, and yet it was built by men.       It was a great tunnel. Its walls were hard and smooth to the       touch; it felt like stone, but it was not stone. On the ground       there were long thin tracks of iron, but it was not iron; it felt       smooth and cold as glass. We knelt, and we crawled forward, our       hand groping along the iron line to see where it would lead. But       there was an unbroken night ahead. Only the iron tracks glowed       through it, straight and white, calling us to follow. But we       could not follow, for we were losing the puddle of light behind       us. So we turned and we crawled back, our hand on the iron line.       And our heart beat in our fingertips, without reason. And then we       knew.        We knew suddenly that this place was left from the Unmentionable       Times. So it was true, and those Times had been, and all the       wonders of those Times. Hundreds upon hundreds of years ago men       knew secrets which we have lost. And we thought: “This is a foul       place. They are damned who touch the things of the Unmentionable       Times.” But our hand which followed the track, as we crawled,       clung to the iron as if it would not leave it, as if the skin of       our hand were thirsty and begging of the metal some secret fluid       beating in its coldness.        We returned to the earth. International 4-8818 looked upon us and       stepped back.        “Equality 7-2521,” they said, “your face is white.”        But we could not speak and we stood looking upon them.        They backed away, as if they dared not touch us. Then they       smiled, but it was not a gay smile; it was lost and pleading. But       still we could not speak. Then they said:        “We shall report our find to the City Council and both of us will       be rewarded.”        And then we spoke. Our voice was hard and there was no mercy in       our voice. We said:        “We shall not report our find to the City Council. We shall not       report it to any men.”        They raised their hands to their ears, for never had they heard       such words as these.        “International 4-8818,” we asked, “will you report us to the       Council and see us lashed to death before your eyes?”        They stood straight all of a sudden and they answered: “Rather       would we die.”        “Then,” we said, “keep silent. This place is ours. This place       belongs to us, Equality 7-2521, and to no other men on earth. And       if ever we surrender it, we shall surrender our life with it       also.”        Then we saw that the eyes of International 4-8818 were full to       the lids with tears they dared not drop. They whispered, and       their voice trembled, so that their words lost all shape:        “The will of the Council is above all things, for it is the will       of our brothers, which is holy. But if you wish it so, we shall       obey you. Rather shall we be evil with you than good with all our       brothers. May the Council have mercy upon both our hearts!”        Then we walked away together and back to the Home of the Street       Sweepers. And we walked in silence.        Thus did it come to pass that each night, when the stars are high       and the Street Sweepers sit in the City Theatre, we, Equality       7-2521, steal out and run through the darkness to our place. It       is easy to leave the Theatre; when the candles are blown out and       the Actors come onto the stage, no eyes can see us as we crawl       under our seat and under the cloth of the tent. Later, it is easy       to steal through the shadows and fall in line next to       International 4-8818, as the column leaves the Theatre. It is       dark in the streets and there are no men about, for no men may       walk through the City when they have no mission to walk there.       Each night, we run to the ravine, and we remove the stones which       we have piled upon the iron grill to hide it from the men. Each       night, for three hours, we are under the earth, alone.        We have stolen candles from the Home of the Street Sweepers, we       have stolen flints and knives and paper, and we have brought them       to this place. We have stolen glass vials and powders and acids       from the Home of the Scholars. Now we sit in the tunnel for three       hours each night and we study. We melt strange metals, and we mix       acids, and we cut open the bodies of the animals which we find in       the City Cesspool. We have built an oven of the bricks we       gathered in the streets. We burn the wood we find in the ravine.       The fire flickers in the oven and blue shadows dance upon the       walls, and there is no sound of men to disturb us.        We have stolen manuscripts. This is a great offense. Manuscripts       are precious, for our brothers in the Home of the Clerks spend       one year to copy one single script in their clear handwriting.       Manuscripts are rare and they are kept in the Home of the       Scholars. So we sit under the earth and we read the stolen       scripts. Two years have passed since we found this place. And in       these two years we have learned more than we had learned in the       ten years of the Home of the Students.        We have learned things which are not in the scripts. We have       solved secrets of which the Scholars have no knowledge. We have       come to see how great is the unexplored, and many lifetimes will       not bring us to the end of our quest. But we wish no end to our       quest. We wish nothing, save to be alone and to learn, and to       feel as if with each day our sight were growing sharper than the       hawk’s and clearer than rock crystal.        Strange are the ways of evil. We are false in the faces of our       brothers. We are defying the will of our Councils. We alone, of       the thousands who walk this earth, we alone in this hour are       doing a work which has no purpose save that we wish to do it. The       evil of our crime is not for the human mind to probe. The nature       of our punishment, if it be discovered, is not for the human       heart to ponder. Never, not in the memory of the Ancient Ones’       Ancients, never have men done that which we are doing.        And yet there is no shame in us and no regret. We say to       ourselves that we are a wretch and a traitor. But we feel no       burden upon our spirit and no fear in our heart. And it seems to       us that our spirit is clear as a lake troubled by no eyes save       those of the sun. And in our heart—strange are the ways of       evil!—in our heart there is the first peace we have known in       twenty years.          PART TWO        Liberty 5-3000... Liberty five-three thousand ... Liberty       5-3000....        We wish to write this name. We wish to speak it, but we dare not       speak it above a whisper. For men are forbidden to take notice of       women, and women are forbidden to take notice of men. But we       think of one among women, they whose name is Liberty 5-3000, and       we think of no others. The women who have been assigned to work       the soil live in the Homes of the Peasants beyond the City. Where       the City ends there is a great road winding off to the north, and       we Street Sweepers must keep this road clean to the first       milepost. There is a hedge along the road, and beyond the hedge       lie the fields. The fields are black and ploughed, and they lie       like a great fan before us, with their furrows gathered in some       hand beyond the sky, spreading forth from that hand, opening wide       apart as they come toward us, like black pleats that sparkle with       thin, green spangles. Women work in the fields, and their white       tunics in the wind are like the wings of sea-gulls beating over       the black soil.        And there it was that we saw Liberty 5-3000 walking along the       furrows. Their body was straight and thin as a blade of iron.       Their eyes were dark and hard and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1250"],["title","Anthem (#3)"],["body","lowing, with no fear in them,       no kindness and no guilt. Their hair was golden as the sun; their       hair flew in the wind, shining and wild, as if it defied men to       restrain it. They threw seeds from their hand as if they deigned       to fling a scornful gift, and the earth was a beggar under their       feet.        We stood still; for the first time did we know fear, and then       pain. And we stood still that we might not spill this pain more       precious than pleasure.        Then we heard a voice from the others call their name: “Liberty       5-3000,” and they turned and walked back. Thus we learned their       name, and we stood watching them go, till their white tunic was       lost in the blue mist.        And the following day, as we came to the northern road, we kept       our eyes upon Liberty 5-3000 in the field. And each day       thereafter we knew the illness of waiting for our hour on the       northern road. And there we looked at Liberty 5-3000 each day. We       know not whether they looked at us also, but we think they did.       Then one day they came close to the hedge, and suddenly they       turned to us. They turned in a whirl and the movement of their       body stopped, as if slashed off, as suddenly as it had started.       They stood still as a stone, and they looked straight upon us,       straight into our eyes. There was no smile on their face, and no       welcome. But their face was taut, and their eyes were dark. Then       they turned as swiftly, and they walked away from us.        But the following day, when we came to the road, they smiled.       They smiled to us and for us. And we smiled in answer. Their head       fell back, and their arms fell, as if their arms and their thin       white neck were stricken suddenly with a great lassitude. They       were not looking upon us, but upon the sky. Then they glanced at       us over their shoulder, as we felt as if a hand had touched our       body, slipping softly from our lips to our feet.        Every morning thereafter, we greeted each other with our eyes. We       dared not speak. It is a transgression to speak to men of other       Trades, save in groups at the Social Meetings. But once, standing       at the hedge, we raised our hand to our forehead and then moved       it slowly, palm down, toward Liberty 5-3000. Had the others seen       it, they could have guessed nothing, for it looked only as if we       were shading our eyes from the sun. But Liberty 5-3000 saw it and       understood. They raised their hand to their forehead and moved it       as we had. Thus, each day, we greet Liberty 5-3000, and they       answer, and no men can suspect.        We do not wonder at this new sin of ours. It is our second       Transgression of Preference, for we do not think of all our       brothers, as we must, but only of one, and their name is Liberty       5-3000. We do not know why we think of them. We do not know why,       when we think of them, we feel all of a sudden that the earth is       good and that it is not a burden to live. We do not think of them       as Liberty 5-3000 any longer. We have given them a name in our       thoughts. We call them the Golden One. But it is a sin to give       men names which distinguish them from other men. Yet we call them       the Golden One, for they are not like the others. The Golden One       are not like the others.        And we take no heed of the law which says that men may not think       of women, save at the Time of Mating. This is the time each       spring when all the men older than twenty and all the women older       than eighteen are sent for one night to the City Palace of       Mating. And each of the men have one of the women assigned to       them by the Council of Eugenics. Children are born each winter,       but women never see their children and children never know their       parents. Twice have we been sent to the Palace of Mating, but it       is an ugly and shameful matter, of which we do not like to think.        We had broken so many laws, and today we have broken one more.       Today, we spoke to the Golden One.        The other women were far off in the field, when we stopped at the       hedge by the side of the road. The Golden One were kneeling alone       at the moat which runs through the field. And the drops of water       falling from their hands, as they raised the water to their lips,       were like sparks of fire in the sun. Then the Golden One saw us,       and they did not move, kneeling there, looking at us, and circles       of light played upon their white tunic, from the sun on the water       of the moat, and one sparkling drop fell from a finger of their       hand held as frozen in the air.        Then the Golden One rose and walked to the hedge, as if they had       heard a command in our eyes. The two other Street Sweepers of our       brigade were a hundred paces away down the road. And we thought       that International 4-8818 would not betray us, and Union 5-3992       would not understand. So we looked straight upon the Golden One,       and we saw the shadows of their lashes on their white cheeks and       the sparks of sun on their lips. And we said:        “You are beautiful, Liberty 5-3000.”        Their face did not move and they did not avert their eyes. Only       their eyes grew wider, and there was triumph in their eyes, and       it was not triumph over us, but over things we could not guess.        Then they asked:        “What is your name?”        “Equality 7-2521,” we answered.        “You are not one of our brothers, Equality 7-2521, for we do not       wish you to be.”        We cannot say what they meant, for there are no words for their       meaning, but we know it without words and we knew it then.        “No,” we answered, “nor are you one of our sisters.”        “If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?”        “We shall look upon you, Liberty 5-3000, if we see you among all       the women of the earth.”        Then they asked:        “Are Street Sweepers sent to different parts of the City or do       they always work in the same places?”        “They always work in the same places,” we answered, “and no one       will take this road away from us.”        “Your eyes,” they said, “are not like the eyes of any among men.”        And suddenly, without cause for the thought which came to us, we       felt cold, cold to our stomach.        “How old are you?” we asked.        They understood our thought, for they lowered their eyes for the       first time.        “Seventeen,” they whispered.        And we sighed, as if a burden had been taken from us, for we had       been thinking without reason of the Palace of Mating. And we       thought that we would not let the Golden One be sent to the       Palace. How to prevent it, how to bar the will of the Councils,       we knew not, but we knew suddenly that we would. Only we do not       know why such thought came to us, for these ugly matters bear no       relation to us and the Golden One. What relation can they bear?        Still, without reason, as we stood there by the hedge, we felt       our lips drawn tight with hatred, a sudden hatred for all our       brother men. And the Golden One saw it and smiled slowly, and       there was in their smile the first sadness we had seen in them.       We think that in the wisdom of women the Golden One had       understood more than we can understand.        Then three of the sisters in the field appeared, coming toward       the road, so the Golden One walked away from us. They took the       bag of seeds, and they threw the seeds into the furrows of earth       as they walked away. But the seeds flew wildly, for the hand of       the Golden One was trembling.        Yet as we walked back to the Home of the Street Sweepers, we felt       that we wanted to sing, without reason. So we were reprimanded       tonight, in the dining hall, for without knowing it we had begun       to sing aloud some tune we had never heard. But it is not proper       to sing without reason, save at the Social Meetings.        “We are singing because we are happy,” we answered the one of the       Home Council who reprimanded us.        “Indeed you are happy,” they answered. “How else can men be when       they live for their brothers?”        And now, sitting here in our tunnel, we wonder about these words.       It is forbidden, not to be happy. For, as it has been explained       to us, men are free and the earth belongs to them; and all things       on earth belong to all men; and the will of all men together is       good for all; and so all men must be happy.        Yet as we stand at night in the great hall, removing our garments       for sleep, we look upon our brothers and we wonder. The heads of       our brothers are bowed. The eyes of our brothers are dull, and       never do they look one another in the eyes. The shoulders of our       brothers are hunched, and their muscles are drawn, as if their       bodies were shrinking and wished to shrink out of sight. And a       word steals into our mind, as we look upon our brothers, and that       word is fear.        There is fear hanging in the air of the sleeping halls, and in       the air of the streets. Fear walks through the City, fear without       name, without shape. All men feel it and none dare to speak.        We feel it also, when we are in the Home of the Street Sweepers.       But here, in our tunnel, we feel it no longer. The air is pure       under the ground. There is no odor of men. And these three hours       give us strength for our hours above the ground.        Our body is betraying us, for the Council of the Home looks with       suspicion upon us. It is not good to feel too much joy nor to be       glad that our body lives. For we matter not and it must not       matter to us whether we live or die, which "]]]
