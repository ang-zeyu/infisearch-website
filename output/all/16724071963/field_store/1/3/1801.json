If danger threatens you, we shall face it also.       If it be death, we shall die with you. You are damned, and we       wish to share your damnation.”        They looked upon us, and their voice was low, but there was       bitterness and triumph in their voice.        “Your eyes are as a flame, but our brothers have neither hope nor       fire. Your mouth is cut of granite, but our brothers are soft and       humble. Your head is high, but our brothers cringe. You walk, but       our brothers crawl. We wish to be damned with you, rather than       blessed with all our brothers. Do as you please with us, but do       not send us away from you.”        Then they knelt, and bowed their golden head before us.        We had never thought of that which we did. We bent to raise the       Golden One to their feet, but when we touched them, it was as if       madness had stricken us. We seized their body and we pressed our       lips to theirs. The Golden One breathed once, and their breath       was a moan, and then their arms closed around us.        We stood together for a long time. And we were frightened that we       had lived for twenty-one years and had never known what joy is       possible to men.        Then we said:        “Our dearest one. Fear nothing of the forest. There is no danger       in solitude. We have no need of our brothers. Let us forget their       good and our evil, let us forget all things save that we are       together and that there is joy as a bond between us. Give us your       hand. Look ahead. It is our own world, Golden One, a strange,       unknown world, but our own.”        Then we walked on into the forest, their hand in ours.        And that night we knew that to hold the body of women in our arms       is neither ugly nor shameful, but the one ecstasy granted to the       race of men.        We have walked for many days. The forest has no end, and we seek       no end. But each day added to the chain of days between us and       the City is like an added blessing.        We have made a bow and many arrows. We can kill more birds than       we need for our food; we find water and fruit in the forest. At       night, we choose a clearing, and we build a ring of fires around       it. We sleep in the midst of that ring, and the beasts dare not       attack us. We can see their eyes, green and yellow as coals,       watching us from the tree branches beyond. The fires smoulder as       a crown of jewels around us, and smoke stands still in the air,       in columns made blue by the moonlight. We sleep together in the       midst of the ring, the arms of the Golden One around us, their       head upon our breast.        Some day, we shall stop and build a house, when we shall have       gone far enough. But we do not have to hasten. The days before us       are without end, like the forest.        We cannot understand this new life which we have found, yet it       seems so clear and so simple. When questions come to puzzle us,       we walk faster, then turn and forget all things as we watch the       Golden One following. The shadows of leaves fall upon their arms,       as they spread the branches apart, but their shoulders are in the       sun. The skin of their arms is like a blue mist, but their       shoulders are white and glowing, as if the light fell not from       above, but rose from under their skin. We watch the leaf which       has fallen upon their shoulder, and it lies at the curve of their       neck, and a drop of dew glistens upon it like a jewel. They       approach us, and they stop, laughing, knowing what we think, and       they wait obediently, without questions, till it pleases us to       turn and go on.        We go on and we bless the earth under our feet. But questions       come to us again, as we walk in silence. If that which we have       found is the corruption of solitude, then what can men wish for       save corruption? If this is the great evil of being alone, then       what is good and what is evil?        Everything which comes from the many is good. Everything which       comes from one is evil. This have we been taught with our first       breath. We have broken the law, but we have never doubted it. Yet       now, as we walk through the forest, we are learning to doubt.        There is no life for men, save in useful toil for the good of all       their brothers. But we lived not, when we toiled for our       brothers, we were only weary. There is no joy for men, save the       joy shared with all their brothers. But the only things which       taught us joy were the power we created in our wires, and the       Golden One. And both these joys belong to us alone, they come       from us alone, they bear no relation to all our brothers, and       they do not concern our brothers in any way. Thus do we wonder.        There is some error, one frightful error, in the thinking of men.       What is that error? We do not know, but the knowledge struggles       within us, struggles to be born. Today, the Golden One stopped       suddenly and said:        “We love you.”        But they frowned and shook their head and looked at us       helplessly.        “No,” they whispered, “that is not what we wished to say.”        They were silent, then they spoke slowly, and their words were       halting, like the words of a child learning to speak for the       first time:        “We are one... alone... and only... and we love you who are       one... alone... and only.”        We looked into each other’s eyes and we knew that the breath of a       miracle had touched us, and fled, and left us groping vainly.        And we felt torn, torn for some word we could not find.          PART TEN        We are sitting at a table and we are writing this upon paper made       thousands of years ago. The light is dim, and we cannot see the       Golden One, only one lock of gold on the pillow of an ancient       bed. This is our home.        We came upon it today, at sunrise. For many days we had been       crossing a chain of mountains. The forest rose among cliffs, and       whenever we walked out upon a barren stretch of rock we saw great       peaks before us in the west, and to the north of us, and to the       south, as far as our eyes could see. The peaks were red and       brown, with the green streaks of forests as veins upon them, with       blue mists as veils over their heads. We had never heard of these       mountains, nor seen them marked on any map. The Uncharted Forest       has protected them from the Cities and from the men of the       Cities.        We climbed paths where the wild goat dared not follow. Stones       rolled from under our feet, and we heard them striking the rocks       below, farther and farther down, and the mountains rang with each       stroke, and long after the strokes had died. But we went on, for       we knew that no men would ever follow our track nor reach us       here.        Then today, at sunrise, we saw a white flame among the trees,       high on a sheer peak before us. We thought that it was a fire and       stopped. But the flame was unmoving, yet blinding as liquid       metal. So we climbed toward it through the rocks. And there,       before us, on a broad summit, with the mountains rising behind       it, stood a house such as we had never seen, and the white fire       came from the sun on the glass of its windows.        The house had two stories and a strange roof flat as a floor.       There was more window than wall upon its walls, and the windows       went on straight around the corners, though how this kept the       house standing we could not guess. The walls were hard and       smooth, of that stone unlike stone which we had seen in our       tunnel.        We both knew it without words: this house was left from the       Unmentionable Times. The trees had protected it from time and       weather, and from men who have less pity than time and weather.       We turned to the Golden One and we asked:        “Are you afraid?”        But they shook their head. So we walked to the door, and we threw       it open, and we stepped together into the house of the       Unmentionable Times.        We shall need the days and the years ahead, to look, to learn,       and to understand the things of this house. Today, we could only       look and try to believe the sight of our eyes. We pulled the       heavy curtains from the windows and we saw that the rooms were       small, and we thought that not more than twelve men could have       lived here. We thought it strange that men had been permitted to       build a house for only twelve.        Never had we seen rooms so full of light. The sunrays danced upon       colors, colors, more colors than we thought possible, we who had       seen no houses save the white ones, the brown ones and the grey.       There were great pieces of glass on the walls, but it was not       glass, for when we looked upon it we saw our own bodies and all       the things behind us, as on the face of a lake. There were       strange things which we had never seen and the use of which we do       not know. And there were globes of glass everywhere, in each       room, the globes with the metal cobwebs inside, such as we had       seen in our tunnel.        We found the sleeping hall and we stood in awe upon its       threshold. For it was a small room and there were only two beds       in it. We found no other beds in the house, and then we knew that       only two had lived here, and this passes understanding. What kind       of world did they have, the men of the Unmentionable Times?        We found garments, and the Golden One gasped at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12507"],["title","The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#0)"],["body","Proofreaders.

THE HISTORY OF THE RISE, PROGRESS, AND ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE ABOLITION OF THE AFRICAN SLAVE-TRADE BY THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT.  BY THOMAS CLARKSON, M.A.  1808.     CHAPTER I.  _Continuation from June 1788 to July 1789--Author travels to collect further evidence--great difficulties in obtaining it--forms committees on his tour--Privy council resume the examinations--inspect cabinet of African productions--obliged to leave many of the witnesses in behalf of the abolition unexamined--prepare their report--Labours of the committee in the interim--Proceedings of the planters and others--Report laid on the table of the House of Commons--Introduction of the question, and debate there--twelve propositions deduced from the report and reserved for future discussion--day of discussion arrives--opponents refuse to argue from the report--require new evidence--this granted and introduced--further consideration of the subject deferred to the next session--Renewal of Sir William Dolben's bill--Death and character of Ramsay._   Matters had now become serious. The gauntlet had been thrown down and accepted. The combatants had taken their stations, and the contest was to be renewed, which was to be decided soon on the great theatre of the nation. The committee by the very act of their institution had pronounced the Slave-trade to be criminal. They, on the other hand, who were concerned in it, had denied the charge. It became the one to prove, and the other to refute it, or to fall in the ensuing session.  The committee, in this perilous situation, were anxious to find out such other persons, as might become proper evidences before the privy council. They had hitherto sent there only nine or ten, and they had then only another, whom they could count upon for this purpose, in their view. The proposal of sending persons to Africa, and the West Indies, who might come back and report what they had witnessed, had been already negatived. The question then was, what they were to do. Upon this they deliberated, and the result was an application to me to undertake a journey to different parts of the kingdom for this purpose.  When this determination was made I was at Teston, writing a long letter to the privy council on the ill usage and mortality of the seamen employed in the Slave-trade, which it had been previously agreed should be received as evidence there. I thought it proper, however, before I took my departure, to form a system of questions upon the general subject. These I divided into six tables. The first related to the productions of Africa, and the disposition and manners of the natives. The second, to the methods of reducing them to slavery. The third, to the manner of bringing them to the ships, their value, the medium of exchange, and other circumstances. The fourth, to their transportation. The fifth, to their treatment in the Colonies. The sixth, to the seamen employed in the trade. These tables contained together one hundred and forty-five questions. My idea was that they should be printed on a small sheet of paper, which should be folded up in seven or eight leaves, of the length and breadth of a small almanac, and then be sent in franks to our different correspondents. These, when they had them, might examine persons capable of giving evidence, who might live in their neighbourhoods or fall in their way, and return us their examinations by letter.  The committee having approved and printed the tables of questions, I began my tour. I had selected the southern counties from Kent to Cornwall for it. I had done this, because these included the great stations of the ships of war in ordinary; and as these were all under the superintendence of Sir Charles Middleton, as comptroller of the navy, I could get an introduction to those on board them. Secondly, because sea-faring people, when they retire from a marine life, usually settle in some town or village upon the coast.  Of this tour I shall not give the reader any very particular account. I shall mention only those things which are most worthy of his notice in it. At Poole in Dorsetshire I laid the foundation of a committee, to act in harmony with that of London for the promotion of the cause. Moses Neave, of the respectable society of the Quakers, was the chairman; Thomas Bell, the secretary, and Ellis. B. Metford and the reverend Mr. Davis and others the committee. This was the third committee, which had been instituted in the country for this purpose. That at Bristol, under Mr. Joseph Harford as chairman, and Mr. Lunell as secretary, had been the first. And that at Manchester, under Mr. Thomas Walker as chairman, and Mr. Samuel Jackson as secretary, had been the second.  As Poole was a great place for carrying on the trade to Newfoundland, I determined to examine the assertion of the Earl of Sandwich in the House of Lords, when he said, in the debate on Sir William Dolben's bill, that the Slave-trade was not more fatal to seamen than the Newfoundland and some others. This assertion I knew at the time to be erroneous, as far as my own researches had been concerned: for out of twenty-four vessels, which had sailed out of the port of Bristol in that employ, only two sailors were upon the dead list. In sixty vessels from Poole, I found but four lost. At Dartmouth, where I went afterwards on purpose, I found almost a similar result. On conversing however with Governor Holdsworth, I learnt that the year 1786 had been more fatal than any other in this trade. I learnt that in consequent of extraordinary storms and hurricanes, no less than five sailors had died and twenty-one had been drowned in eighty-three vessels from that port. Upon this statement I determined to look into the muster-rolls of the trade there for two or three years together. I began by accident with the year 1769, and I went on to the end of 1772. About eighty vessels on an average had sailed thence in each of these years. Taking the loss in these years, and compounding it with that in the fatal year, three sailors had been lost, but taking it in these four years by themselves, only two had been lost, in twenty-four vessels so employed. On a comparison with the Slave-trade, the result would be, that two vessels to Africa would destroy more seamen than eighty-three sailing to Newfoundland. There was this difference also to be noted, that the loss in the one trade was generally by the weather or by accident, but in the other by cruel treatment or disease; and that they, who went out in a declining state of health in the one, came home generally recovered, whereas they, who went out robust in the other, came home in a shattered condition.  At Plymouth I laid the foundation of another committee. The late William Cookworthy, the late John Prideaux, and James Fox, all of the society of the Quakers, and Mr. George Leach, Samuel Northcote, and John Saunders, had a principal share in forming it. Sir William Ellford was chosen chairman.  From Plymouth I journeyed on to Falmouth, and from thence to Exeter, where having meetings with the late Mr. Samuel Milford, the late Mr. George Manning, the reverend James Manning, Thomas Sparkes, and others, a desire became manifest among them of establishing a committee there. This was afterwards effected; and Mr. Milford, who, at a general meeting of the inhabitants of Exeter, on the tenth of June, on this great subject, had been called by those present to the chair, was appointed the chairman of it.  With respect to evidence, which was the great object of this tour, I found myself often very unpleasantly situated in collecting it. I heard of many persons capable of giving it to our advantage, to whom I could get no introduction. I had to go after these many miles out of my established route. Not knowing me, they received me coldly, and even suspiciously; while I fell in with others, who, considering themselves, on account of their concerns and connexions, as our opponents, treated me in an uncivil manner.  But the difficulties and disappointments in other respects, which I experienced in this tour, even where I had an introduction, and where the parties were not interested in the continuance of the Slave-trade, were greater than people in general would have imagined. One would have thought, considering the great enthusiasm of the nation on this important subject, that they, who could have given satisfactory information upon it, would have rejoiced to do it. But I found it otherwise, and this frequently to my sorrow. There was an aversion in persons to appear before such a tribunal as they conceived the privy council to be. With men of shy or timid character this operated as an insuperable barrier in their way. But it operated more or less upon all. It was surprising to see what little circumstances affected many. When I took out my pen and ink to put down the information, which a person was giving me, he became evidently embarrassed and frightened. He began to excuse himself from staying, by alleging that he had nothing more to communicate, and he took himself away as quickly as he could with decency. The sight of the pen and ink had lost me so many good evidences, that I was obliged wholly to abandon the use of them, and to betake myself to other means. I was obliged for the future to commit my tables of questions to memory, and endeavour by practice to put down, after the examination of a person, such answers as he had given me to each of them.  Others went off because it happened that immediately on my interview, I acquainted them with the nature of my errand, and solicited their attendance in London. Conceiving that I had no right to ask them such a favour, or terrified at the abruptness and apparent awfulness of my request, some of them gave me an immediate denial, which they would never afterwards retract. I began to"]]]
