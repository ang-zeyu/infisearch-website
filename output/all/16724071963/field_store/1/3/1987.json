I mean I can't.\"  \"How do you expect I get along, then?  I have a wife and two children to support, and only get two dollars a week more than you.\"  \"Perhaps you get into debt.\"  \"No; I owe no man a dollar,\" said Ferguson emphatically.  \"That isn't all.  I save two dollars a week; so that I actually support four on fifteen dollars a week--your salary.  What do you say to that?\"  \"I don't want to be mean,\" said Clapp.  \"Nor I.  I mean to live comfortably, but of course I have to be economical.\"  \"Oh, hang economy!\" said Clapp impatiently.  \"The old man used to lecture me about economy till I got sick of hearing the word.\"  \"It is a good thing, for all that,\" persisted Ferguson.  \"You'll think so some day, even if you don't now.\"  \"I guess you mean to run opposition to young Franklin, over there,\" sneered Clapp, indicating Harry, who had listened to the discussion with not a little interest.  \"I think he and I will agree together pretty well,\" said Ferguson, smiling.  \"Franklin's a good man to imitate.\"  \"If there are going to be two Franklins in the office, it will be time for me to clear out,\" returned Clapp.  \"You can do better.\"  \"How is that?\"  \"Become Franklin No. 3.\"  \"You don't catch me imitating any old fogy like that.  As far as I know anything about him, he was a mean, stingy old curmudgeon!\" exclaimed Clapp with irritation.  \"That's rather strong language, Clapp,\" said Mr. Anderson, looking up from his desk with a smile.  \"It doesn't correspond with the general estimate of Franklin's character.\"  \"I don't care,\" said Clapp doggedly, \"I wouldn't be like Franklin if I could.  I have too much self-respect.\"  Ferguson laughed, and Harry wanted to, but feared he should offend the younger journeyman, who evidently had worked himself into a bad humor.  \"I don't think you're in any danger,\" said Ferguson, who did not mind his fellow-workman's little ebullitions of temper.  Clapp scowled, but did not deign to reply, partly, perhaps, because he knew that there was nothing to say.  From the outset Ferguson took a fancy to the young apprentice.  \"He's got good, solid ideas,\" said he to Mr. Anderson, when Harry was absent.  \"He isn't so thoughtless as most boys of his age.  He looks ahead.\"  \"I think you are right in your judgment of him,\" said Mr. Anderson. \"He promises to be a faithful workman.\"  \"He promises more than that,\" said Ferguson.  \"Mark my words, Mr. Anderson; that boy is going to make his mark some day.\"  \"It is a little too soon to say that, isn't it?\"  \"No; I judge from what I see.  He is industrious and ambitious, and is bound to succeed.  The world will hear of him yet.\"  Mr. Anderson smiled.  He liked what he had seen of his new apprentice, but he thought Ferguson altogether too sanguine.  \"He's a good, faithful boy,\" he admitted, \"but it takes more than that to rise to distinction.  If all the smart boys turned out smart men, they'd be a drug in the market.\"  But Ferguson held to his own opinion, notwithstanding.  Time will show which was right.  The next day Ferguson said, \"Harry, come round to my house, and take tea to-night.  I've spoken to my wife about you, and she wants to see you.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Ferguson,\" said Harry.  \"I shall be very glad to come.\"  \"I'll wait till you are ready, and you can walk along with me.\"  \"All right; I will be ready in five minutes.\"  They set out together for Ferguson's modest home, which was about half a mile distant.  As they passed up the village street Harry's attention was drawn to two boys who were approaching them.  One he recognized at once as Fitzgerald Fletcher.  He had an even more stunning necktie than when Harry first met him, and sported a jaunty little cane, which he swung in his neatly gloved hand.  \"I wonder if he'll notice me,\" thought Harry.  \"At any rate, I won't be wanting in politeness.\"  \"Good-afternoon, Mr. Fletcher,\" he said, as they met.  Fitzgerald stared at him superciliously, and made the slightest possible nod.  \"Who is that?\" asked Ferguson.  \"It is a boy who has great contempt for printers' devils and low apprentices,\" answered Harry.  \"I was introduced to him two evenings ago, but he evidently doesn't care about keeping up the acquaintance.\"  \"Who is that, Fitz?\" asked his companion in turn.  \"It's a low fellow--a printer's devil,\" answered Fitz, shortly.  \"How do you happen to know him?\"  \"Oscar Vincent introduced him to me.  Oscar's a queer fellow.  He belongs to one of the first families in Boston--one of my set, you know, and yet he actually invited that boy to his room.\"  \"He's rather a good-looking boy--the printer.\"  \"Think so?\" drawled Fitz.  \"He's low--all apprentices are.  I mean to keep him at a distance.\"     CHAPTER VII.  A PLEASANT EVENING.  \"This is my house,\" said Ferguson, pausing at the gate.  Harry looked at it with interest.  It was a cottage, containing four rooms, and a kitchen in the ell part.  There was a plot of about a quarter of an acre connected with it.  Everything about it was neat, though very unpretentious.  \"It isn't a palace,\" said Ferguson, \"but,\" he added cheerfully, \"it's a happy home, and from all I've read, that is more than can be said of some palaces.  Step right in and make yourself at home.\"  They entered a tiny entry, and Mrs. Ferguson opened the door of the sitting-room.  She was a pleasant-looking woman, and her face wore a smile st welcome.  \"Hannah,\" said Ferguson, \"this is our new apprentice, Harry Walton.\"  \"I am glad to see you,\" she said, offering her hand.  \"My husband has spoken of you.  You are quite welcome, if you can put up with humble fare.\"  \"That is what I have always been accustomed to,\" said Harry, beginning to feel quite at home.  \"Where are the children, Hannah?\"  Two children, a boy and a girl, of six and four years respectively, bounded into the room and answered for themselves.  They looked shyly at Harry, but before many minutes their shyness had worn off, and the little girl was sitting on his knee, while the boy stood beside him. Harry was fond of children, and readily adapted himself to his young acquaintances.  Supper was soon ready--a plain meal, but one that Harry enjoyed.  He could not help comparing Ferguson's plain, but pleasant home, with Clapp's mode of life.  The latter spent on himself as much as sufficed his fellow-workman to support a wife and two children, yet it was easy to see which found the best enjoyment in life.  \"How do you like your new business?\" asked Mrs. Ferguson, as she handed Harry a cup of tea.  \"I like all but the name,\" said our hero, smiling.  \"I wonder how the name came to be applied to a printer's apprentice any more than to any other apprentice,\" said Mrs. Ferguson.  \"I never heard,\" said her husband.  \"It seems to me to be a libel upon our trade.  But there is one comfort.  If you stick to the business, you'll outgrow the name.\"  \"That is lucky; I shouldn't like to be called the wife of a ----.  I won't pronounce the word lest the children should catch it.\"  \"What is it, mother?\" asked Willie, with his mouth full.  \"It isn't necessary for you to know, my boy.\"  \"Do you know Mr. Clapp?\" asked Harry.  \"I have seen him, but never spoke with him.\"  \"I never asked him round to tea,\" said Ferguson.  \"I don't think he would enjoy it any better than I.  His tastes are very different from mine, and his views of life are equally different.\"  \"I should think so,\" said Harry.  \"Now I think you and I would agree very well.  Clapp dislikes the business, and only sticks to it because he must get his living in some way.  As for me, if I had a sum of money, say five thousand dollars, I would still remain a printer, but in that case I would probably buy out a paper, or start one, and be a publisher, as well as a printer.\"  \"That's just what I should like,\" said Harry.  \"Who knows but we may be able to go into partnership some day, and carry out our plan.\"  \"I would like it,\" said Harry; \"but I am afraid it will be a good while before we can raise the five thousand dollars.\"  \"We don't need as much.  Mr. Anderson started on a capital of a thousand dollars, and now he is in comfortable circumstances.\"  \"Then there's hopes for us.\"  \"At any rate I cherish hopes of doing better some day.  I shouldn't like always to be a journeyman.  I manage to save up a hundred dollars a year.  How much have we in the savings bank, Hannah?\"  \"Between four and five hundred dollars, with interest.\"  \"It has taken me four years to save it up.  In five more, if nothing happens, I should be worth a thousand dollars.  Journeymen printers don't get rich very fast.\"  \"I hope to have saved up something myself, in five years,\" said Harry.  \"Then our plan may come to pass, after all.  You shall be editor, and I publisher.\"  \"I should think you would prefer to be an editor,\" said his wife.  \"I am diffident of my powers in the line of composition,\" said Ferguson.  \"I shouldn't be afraid to undertake local items, but when it comes to an elaborate editorial, I should rather leave it in other hands.\"  \"I always liked writing,\" said Harry.  \"Of course I have only had a school-boy's practice, but I mean to practise more in my leisure hours.\"  \"Suppose you write a poem for the 'Gazette,' Walton.\"  Harry smiled.  \"I am not ambitious enough for that,\" he replied.  \"I will try plain prose.\"  \"Do so,\" said Ferguson, earnestly.  \"Our plan may come to something after all, if we wait patiently.  It will do no harm to prepare yourself as well as you can.  After a while you might write something for the 'Gazette.'  I think Mr. Anderson would put it in.\"  \"Shall I sign it P. D.?\" asked Harry.  \"P. D. stands for Doctor of Philosophy.\"  \"I don't aspire to such a learned title.  P. D. also stands for Printer's Devil.\"  \"I see.  Well, joking"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12741"],["title","Risen from the Ranks; Or, Harry Walton's Success (#6)"],["body","e, I advise you to improve yourself in writing.\"  \"I will.  That is the way Franklin did.\"  \"I remember.  He wrote an article, and slipped it under the door of the printing office, not caring to have it known that he was the author.\"  \"Shall I give you a piece of pie, Mr. Walton?\" said Mrs. Ferguson.  \"Thank you.\".  \"Me too,\" said Willie, extending his plate.  \"Willie is always fond of pie,\" said his father, \"In a printing office _pi_ is not such a favorite.\"  When supper was over, Mr. Ferguson showed Harry a small collection of books, about twenty-five in number, neatly arranged on shelves.  \"It isn't much of a library,\" he said, \"but a few books are better than none.  I should like to buy as many every year; but books are expensive, and the outlay would make too great an inroad upon my small surplus.\"  \"I always thought I should like a library,\" said Harry, \"but my father is very poor, and has fewer books than you.  As for me, I have but one book besides the school-books I studied, and that I gained as a school prize--The Life of Franklin.\"  \"If one has few books he is apt to prize them more,\" said Ferguson, \"and is apt to profit by them more.\"  \"Have you read the History of China?\" asked Harry, who had been looking over his friend's books.  \"No; I have never seen it.\"  \"Why, there it is,\" said our hero, \"In two volumes.\"  \"Take it down,\" said Ferguson, laughing.  Harry did so, and to his surprise it opened in his hands, and revealed a checker-board.  \"You see appearances are deceitful.  Can you play checkers?\"  \"I never tried.\"  \"You will easily learn.  Shall I teach you the game?\"  \"I wish you would.\"  They sat down; and Harry soon became interested in the game, which requires a certain degree of thought and foresight.  \"You will make a good player after a while,\" said his companion. \"You must come in often and play with me.\"  \"Thank you, I should like to do so.  It may not be often, for I am taking lessons in French, and I want to get on as fast as possible.\"  \"I did not know there was any one in the village who gave lessons in French.\"  \"Oh, he's not a professional teacher.  Oscar Vincent, one of the Academy boys, is teaching me.  I am to take two lessons a week, on Tuesday and Friday evenings.\"  \"Indeed, that is a good arrangement.  How did it come about?\"  Harry related the particulars of his meeting with Oscar.  \"He's a capital fellow,\" he concluded.  \"Very different from another boy I met in his room.  I pointed him out to you in the street. Oscar seems to be rich, but he doesn't put on any airs, and he treated me very kindly.\"  \"That is to his credit.  It's the sham aristocrats that put on most airs.   I believe you will make somebody, Walton.  You have lost no time in getting to work.\"  \"I have no time to lose.  I wish I was in Oscar's place.  He is preparing for Harvard, and has nothing to do but to learn.\"  \"I heard a lecturer once who said that the printing office is the poor man's college, and he gave a great many instances of printers who had risen high in the world, particularly in our own country.\"  \"Well, that is encouraging.  I should like to have heard the lecture.\"  \"I begin to think, Harry, that I should have done well to follow your example.  When I was in your position, I might have studied too, but I didn't realize the importance as I do now.  I read some useful books, to be sure, but that isn't like studying.\"  \"It isn't too late now.\"  Ferguson shook his head.  \"Now I have a wife and children,\" he said.  \"I am away from them during the day, and the evening I like to pass socially with them.\"  \"Perhaps you would like to be divorced,\" said his wife, smiling. \"Then you would get time for study.\"  \"I doubt if that would make me as happy, Hannah.  I am not ready to part with you just yet.  But our young friend here is not quite old enough to be married, and there is nothing to prevent his pursuing his studies.  So, Harry, go on, and prepare yourself for your editorial duties.\"  Harry smiled thoughtfully.  For the first time he had formed definite plans for his future.  Why should not Ferguson's plans be realized?  \"If I live long enough,\" he said to himself, \"I will be an editor, and exert some influence in the world.\"  At ten o'clock he bade good-night to Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson, feeling that he had passed a pleasant and what might prove a profitable evening.     CHAPTER VIII.  FLETCHER'S VIEWS ON SOCIAL POSITION.  \"You are getting on finely, Harry,\" said Oscar Vincent, a fortnight later.  \"You do credit to my teaching.  As you have been over all the regular verbs now, I will give you a lesson in translating.\"  \"I shall find that interesting,\" said Harry, with satisfaction.  \"Here is a French Reader,\" said Oscar, taking one down from the shelves.  \"It has a dictionary at the end.  I won't give you a lesson.  You may take as much as you have time for, and at the same time three or four of the irregular verbs.  You are going about three times as fast as I did when I commenced French.\"  \"Perhaps I have a better teacher than you had,\" said Harry, smiling.  \"I shouldn't wonder,\" said Oscar.  \"That explains it to my satisfaction.  Well, now the lesson is over, sit down and we'll have a chat.  Oh, by the way, there's one thing I want to speak to you about.  We've got a debating society at our school.  It is called 'The Clionian Society.'  Most of the students belong to it.  How would you like to join?\"  \"I should like it very much.  Do you think they would admit me?\"  \"I don't see why not.  I'll propose you at the next meeting, Thursday evening.  Then the nomination will lie over a week, and be acted upon at the next meeting.\"  \"I wish you would.  I never belonged to a debating society, but I should like to learn to speak.\"  \"It's nothing when you're used to it.  It's only the first time you know, that troubles you.  By Jove!  I remember how my knees trembled when I first got up and said Mr. President.  I felt as if all eyes were upon me, and I wanted to sink through the floor.  Now I can get up and chatter with the best of them.  I don't mean that I can make an eloquent speech or anything of that kind, but I can talk at a minute's notice on almost any subject.\"  \"I wish I could.\"  \"Oh, you can, after you've tried a few times.  Well, then, it's settled.  I'll propose you at the next meeting.\"  \"How lucky I am to have fallen in with you, Oscar.\"  \"I know what you mean.  I'm your guide, philosopher, and friend, and all that sort of thing.  I hope you'll have proper veneration for me. It's rather a new character for me.  Would you believe it, Harry,--at home I am regarded as a rattle-brained chap, instead of the dignified Professor that you know me to be.  Isn't it a shame?\"  \"Great men are seldom appreciated at home, Oscar.\"  \"I know that.  I shall have to get a certificate from you, certifying to my being a steady and erudite young man.\"  \"I'll give it with the greatest pleasure.\"  \"Holloa, there's a knock.  Come in!\" shouted Oscar.  The door opened, and Fitzgerald Fletcher entered the room.  \"How are you, Fitz?\" said Oscar.  \"Sit down and make yourself comfortable.  You know my friend, Harry Walton, I believe?\"  \"I believe I had the honor to meet him here one evening,\" said Fitzgerald stiffly, slightly emphasizing the word \"honor.\"  \"I hope you are well, Mr. Fletcher,\" said Harry, more amused than disturbed by the manner of the aristocratic visitor.  \"Thank you, my health is good,\" said Fitzgerald with equal stiffness, and forthwith turned to Oscar, not deigning to devote any more attention to Harry.  Our hero had intended to remain a short time longer, but, under the circumstances, as Oscar's attention would be occupied by Fletcher, with whom he was not on intimate terms, he thought he might spend the evening more profitably at home in study.  \"If you'll excuse me, Oscar,\" he said, rising, \"I will leave you now, as I have something to do this evening.\"  \"If you insist upon it, Harry, I will excuse you.  Come round Friday evening.\"  \"Thank you.\"  \"Do you have to work at the printing office in the evening?\" Fletcher deigned to inquire.  \"No; I have some studying to do.\"  \"Reading and spelling, I suppose,\" sneered Fletcher.  \"I am studying French.\"  \"Indeed!\" returned Fletcher, rather surprised.  \"How can you study it without a teacher?\"  \"I have a teacher.\"  \"Who is it?\"  \"Professor Vincent,\" said Harry, smiling.  \"You didn't know that I had developed into a French Professor, did you, Fitz?  Well, it's so, and whether it's the superior teaching or not, I can't say, but my scholar is getting on famously.\"  \"It must be a great bore to teach,\" said Fletcher.  \"Not at all.  I like it.\"  \"Every one to his taste,\" said Fitzgerald unpleasantly.  \"Good-night, Oscar.  Good-night, Mr. Fletcher,\" said Harry, and made his exit.  \"You're a strange fellow, Oscar,\" said Fletcher, after Harry's departure.  \"Very likely, but what particular strangeness do you refer to now?\"  \"No one but you would think of giving lessons to a printer's devil.\"  \"I don't know about that.\"  \"No one, I mean, that holds your position in society.\"  \"I don't know that I hold any particular position in society.\"  \"Your family live on Beacon Street, and move in the first circles.  I am sure my mother would be disgusted if I should demean myself so far as to give lessons to any vulgar apprentice.\"  \"I don't propose to give lessons to any vulgar apprentice.\"  \"You know whom I mean.  This Walton is only a printer's devil.\"  \"I don't know that that is any objection to him.  It isn't morally wrong to be a printer's devil, is it?\"  \"What a queer fellow you are, Oscar.  Of course I don't mean that.  I daresay he's well enough in his place, though he seems to be very forward and presuming, but you know that he's not your equal.\"  \"He is not my equal in knowledge, but I shouldn't be surprised if he would be some time.  You'd be astonished to see how fast he gets on.\"  \"I daresay.  But I mean in social position.\"  \"It seems to me you can't think "]]]
