VISIT TO THE HOLY LAND, EGYPT, AND ITALY     [Illustration 1. Frontispiece:--JERUSALEM.   ill1.jpg]  By Madame Ida Pfeiffer.  Translated from the German by H. W. Dulcken.  [Illustration 2.  Title-page:--NAZARETH.   ill2.jpg]     PREFACE BY THE VIENNA PUBLISHER   For two centuries the princes and nations of the West were accustomed to wander towards the land of the morning.  In vain was the noblest blood poured forth in streams in the effort to wrest the country of our heavenly Teacher from the grasp of the infidel; and though the Christian Europe of the present day forbears to renew a struggle which, considering the strength that has been gradually increasing for the last six hundred years, might prove an easy one, we cannot wonder that millions of the votaries of Christianity should cherish an earnest longing to wander in the paths the Redeemer has trod, and to view with their own eyes the traces of the Saviour's progress from the cradle to the grave.  In the generality of cases, however, the hardships, dangers, and difficulties of such a journey were sufficient to overthrow the bravest resolution; and thus the wishes of the majority remained unfulfilled.  Few _men_ were found to possess the degree of strength and endurance requisite for the carrying out of such an undertaking; but that a delicate lady of the higher classes, a native of Vienna, should have the heroism to do what thousands of men failed to achieve, seemed almost incredible.  In her earliest youth she earnestly desired to perform this journey; descriptions of the Holy Land were perused by her with peculiar interest, and a book of Eastern travel had more charms for her than the most glowing accounts of Paris or London.  It was not, however, until our Authoress had reached a riper age, and had finished the education of her sons, that she succeeded in carrying into effect the ardent aspiration of her youth.  On the 2d of March, 1842, she commenced her journey alone, without companions, but fully prepared to bear every ill, to bid defiance to every danger, and to combat every difficulty.  That this undertaking should have succeeded may almost be looked upon as a wonder.  Far from desiring publicity, she merely kept a diary, in order to retain the recollections of her tour during her later life, and to impart to her nearest relatives the story of her fortunes.  Every evening, though often greatly exhausted with heat, thirst, and the hardships of travel, she never failed to make notes in pencil of the occurrences of the day, frequently using a sand-mound or the back of a camel as a table, while the other members of the caravan lay stretched around her, completely tired out.  It was in the house of my friend Halm that I first heard of this remarkable woman, at a time when she had not yet completed her journey; and every subsequent account of Madame Pfeiffer increased my desire to make her acquaintance.  In manners and appearance I found her to resemble many other women who have distinguished themselves by fortitude, firmness of soul, and magnanimity; and who are in private life the most simple and unaffected, the most modest, and consequently also the most agreeable of beings.  My request to read our Authoress's journal was granted with some timidity; and I am ready to assert that seldom has a book so irresistibly attracted me, or so completely fixed my attention from beginning to end, as this.  The simple and unadorned relation of facts, the candour, combined with strong sound sense, which appear throughout, might put to shame the bombastic striving after originality of many a modern author. The scheme and execution of the work are complete and agreeable; strict truth shines forth from every page, and no one can doubt but that so pure and noble a mind must see things in a right point of view.  This circumstance is sufficient in itself to raise the book above many descriptions of travel to the Holy Land, whose authors, trusting to the fact that their assertions could not easily be disproved, have indulged their fancy, seeking to impart interest to their works by the relation of imaginary dangers, and by exaggeration of every kind, for the sake of gaining praise and admiration.  Many such men might blush with shame on reading this journal of a simple, truth-loving woman.  After much trouble I succeeded in persuading the Authoress to allow her journal to appear in print.  My efforts were called forth by the desire to furnish the reading public, and particularly the female portion, with a very interesting and attractive, and at the same time a strictly authentic picture of the Holy Land, and of Madame Pfeiffer's entire journey.

I had for years cherished the wish to undertake a journey to the Holy Land; years are, indeed, required to familiarise one with the idea of so hazardous an enterprise.  When, therefore, my domestic arrangements at length admitted of my absence for at least a year, my chief employment was to prepare myself for this journey.  I read many works bearing on the subject, and was moreover fortunate enough to make the acquaintance of a gentleman who had travelled in the Holy Land some years before.  I was thus enabled to gain much oral information and advice respecting the means of prosecuting my dangerous pilgrimage.  My friends and relations attempted in vain to turn me from my purpose by painting, in the most glowing colours, all the dangers and difficulties which await the traveller in those regions.  \"Men,\" they said, \"were obliged gravely to consider if they had physical strength to endure the fatigues of such a journey, and strength of mind bravely to face the dangers of the plague, the climate, the attacks of insects, bad diet, etc.  And to think of a woman's venturing alone, without protection of any kind, into the wide world, across sea and mountain and plain,--it was quite preposterous.\"  This was the opinion of my friends.  I had nothing to advance in opposition to all this but my firm unchanging determination.  My trust in Providence gave me calmness and strength to set my house in every respect in order.  I made my will, and arranged all my worldly affairs in such a manner that, in the case of my death (an event which I considered more probable than my safe return), my family should find every thing perfectly arranged.  And thus, on the 22d of March 1842, I commenced my journey from Vienna.  At one o'clock in the afternoon I drove to the Kaisermuhlen (Emperor's Mills), from which place the steamboats start for Pesth. I was joyfully surprised by the presence of several of my relations and friends, who wished to say farewell once more.  The parting was certainly most bitter, for the thought involuntarily obtruded itself, \"Should we ever meet again in this world?\"  Our mournful meditations were in some degree disturbed by a loud dispute on board the vessel.  At the request of a gentleman present, one of the passengers was compelled, instead of flying, as he had intended, with bag and baggage to Hungary, to return to Vienna in company of the police.  It appeared he owed the gentleman 1300 florins, and had wished to abscond, but was luckily overtaken before the departure of the boat.  This affair was hardly concluded when the bell rang, the wheels began to revolve, and too soon, alas, my dear ones were out of sight!  I had but few fellow-passengers.  The weather was indeed fine and mild; but the season was not far enough advanced to lure travellers into the wide world, excepting men of business, and those who had cosmopolitan ideas, like myself.  Most of those on board were going only to Presburg, or at farthest to Pesth.  The captain having mentioned that a woman was on board who intended travelling to Constantinople, I was immediately surrounded by curious gazers.  A gentleman who was bound to the same port stepped forward, and offered his services in case I should ever stand in need of them; he afterwards frequently took me under his protection.  The fine mild weather changed to cold and wind as we got fairly out into the great Danube.  I wrapped myself in my cloak, and remained on deck, in order to see the scenery between Vienna and Presburg, which, no doubt, appears lovely enough when nature is clad in the garment of spring; but now I only saw leafless trees and fallow ground--a dreary picture of winter.  Hainburg with its old castle on a rock, Theben with its remarkable fortress, and farther on the large free city of Presburg, have all a striking appearance.  In three hours' time we reached Presburg, and landed in the neighbourhood of the Coronation-hill, an artificial mound, on which the king must stand in his royal robes, and brandish his sword towards the four quarters of the heavens, as a token that he is ready to defend his kingdom against all enemies, from whatever direction they may approach.  Not far from this hill is situate the handsome inn called the \"Two Green Trees,\" where the charges are as high, if not higher, than in Vienna.  Until we have passed Pesth, passengers going down the river are not allowed to remain on board through the night.  March 23d.  This morning we continued our journey at six o'clock.  Immediately below Presburg the Danube divides into two arms, forming the fertile island of Schutt, which is about forty-six miles long and twenty- eight in breadth.  Till we reach Gran the scenery is monotonous enough, but here it improves.  Beautiful hills and several mountains surround the place, imparting a charm of variety to the landscape.  In the evening, at about seven o'clock, we arrived at Pesth. Unfortunately it was already quite dark.  The magnificent houses, or rather palaces, skirting the left bank of the Danube, and the celebrated ancient fortress and town of Ofen on the right, form a splendid spectacle, and invite the traveller to a longer sojourn. As I had passed some days at Pesth several years before, I now only stayed there for one night.  As the traveller must change steamers here, it behoves him to keep a careful eye upon the luggage he has not delivered up at the office in Vienna.  I put up at the \"Hunting-horn,\" a fine hotel, but ridiculously expensive.  A little back room cost me 45 kreutzers (about one shilling and eightpence) for one night.  The whole day I had felt exceedingly unwell.  A violent headache, accompanied by nausea and fever, made me fear the approach of a fit of illness which would interrupt my journey.  These symptoms were probably a consequence of the painful excitement of parting with my friends, added to the change of air.  With some difficulty I gained my modest chamber, and immediately went to bed.  My good constitution was luckily proof against the attacks of all enemies, and waking the next morning, on  March 24th,  in tolerable health, I betook myself on board our new steamboat the Galata, of sixty-horse power:  this boat did not, however, appear to me so tidy and neat as the Marianna, in which we had proceeded from Vienna to Pesth.  Our journey was a rapid one; at ten o'clock in the morning we were already at Feldvar, a place which seems at a distance to be of some magnitude, but which melts away like a soap- bubble on a nearer approach.  By two o'clock we had reached Paks; here, as at all other places of note, we stopped for a quarter of an hour.  A boat rows off from the shore, bringing and fetching back passengers with such marvellous speed, that you have scarcely finished the sentence you are saying to your neighbour before he has vanished.  There is no time even to say farewell.  At about eight o'clock in the evening we reached the market-town of Mohacs, celebrated as the scene of two battles.  The fortress here is used as a prison for criminals.  We could distinguish nothing either of the fortress or the town.  It was already night when we arrived, and at two o'clock in the morning of  March 25th  we weighed anchor.  I was assured, however, that I had lost nothing by this haste.  Some hours afterwards, our ship suddenly struck with so severe a shock, that all hastened on deck to see what was the matter.  Our steersman, who had most probably been more asleep than awake, had given the ship an unskilful turn, in consequence of which, one of the paddles was entangled with some trunks of trees projecting above the surface of the water.  The sailors hurried into the boats,"]]]
