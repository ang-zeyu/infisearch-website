While they acknowledged the necessity of removing one evil, they were terrified by the prospect of introducing another; and were therefore only able to relieve their feelings, by lamenting in the bitterness of their hearts, that this traffic had ever been begun at all.  After the death of cardinal Ximenes, the emperor Charles the Fifth, who had come into power, encouraged the Slave-trade. In 1517 he granted a patent to one of his Flemish favourites, containing an exclusive right of importing four thousand Africans into America. But he lived long enough to repent of what he had thus inconsiderately done. For in the year 1542 he made a code of laws for the better protection of the unfortunate Indians in his foreign dominions; and he stopped the progress of African slavery by an order, that all slaves in his American islands should be made free. This order was executed by Pedro de la Gasca. Manumission took place as well in Hispaniola as on the Continent. But on the return of Gasca to Spain, and the retirement of Charles into a monastery, slavery was revived.  It is impossible to pass over this instance of the abolition of slavery by Charles in all his foreign dominions, without some comments. It shows him, first, to have been a friend both to the Indians and the Africans, as a part of the human race. It shows he was ignorant of what he was doing when he gave his sanction to this cruel trade. It shows when legislators give one set of men an undue power over another, how quickly they abuse it,--or he never would have found himself obliged in the short space of twenty-five years to undo that which he had countenanced as a great state-measure. And while it confirms the former lesson to statesmen, of watching the beginnings or principles of things in their political movements, it should teach them never to persist in the support of evils, through the false shame of being obliged to confess that they had once given them their sanction, nor to delay the cure of them because, politically speaking, neither this nor that is the proper season; but to do them away instantly, as there can only be one fit or proper time in the eye of religion, namely, on the conviction of their existence.  From the opinions of cardinal Ximenes and of the emperor Charles the Fifth, I hasten to that which was expressed much about the same time, in a public capacity, by pope Leo the Tenth. The Dominicans in Spanish America, witnessing the cruel treatment which the slaves underwent there, considered slavery as utterly repugnant to the principles of the gospel, and recommended the abolition of it. The Franciscans did not favour the former in this their scheme of benevolence; and the consequence was, that a controversy on this subject sprung up between them, which was carried to this pope for his decision. Leo exerted himself, much to his honour, in behalf of the poor sufferers, and declared \"That not only the Christian religion, but that Nature herself cried out against a state of slavery.\" This answer was certainly worthy of one who was deemed the head of the Christian church. It must, however, be confessed that it would have been strange if Leo, in his situation as pontiff, had made a different reply. He could never have denied that God was no respecter of persons. He must have acknowledged that men were bound to love each other as brethren. And, if he admitted the doctrine, that all men were accountable for their actions hereafter, he could never have prevented the deduction, that it was necessary they should be free. Nor could he, as a man of high attainments, living early in the sixteenth century, have been ignorant of what had taken place in the twelfth; or that, by the latter end of this latter century, Christianity had obtained the undisputed honour of having extirpated slavery from the western part of the European world.  From Spain and Italy I come to England. The first importation of slaves from Africa by our countrymen was in the reign of Elizabeth, in the year 1562. This great princess seems on the very commencement of the trade to have questioned its lawfulness. She seems to have entertained a religious scruple concerning it, and, indeed, to have revolted at the very thought of it. She seems to have been aware of the evils to which its continuance might lead, or that, if it were sanctioned, the most unjustifiable means might be made use of to procure the persons of the natives of Africa. And in what light she would have viewed any acts of this kind, had they taken place, we may conjecture from this fact,--that when captain (afterwards Sir John) Hawkins returned from his first voyage to Africa and Hispaniola, whither he had carried slaves, she sent for him, and, as we learn from Hill's Naval History, expressed her concern lest any of the Africans should be carried off without their free consent, declaring that \"It would be detestable, and call down the vengeance of Heaven upon the undertakers.\" Captain Hawkins promised to comply with the injunctions of Elizabeth in this respect. But he did not keep his word; for when he went to Africa again, he seized many of the inhabitants and carried them off as slaves, which occasioned Hill, in the account he gives of his second voyage, to use these remarkable words:--\"Here began the horrid practice of forcing the Africans into slavery, an injustice and barbarity, which, so sure as there is vengeance in heaven for the worst of crimes, will sometime be the destruction of all who allow or encourage it.\" That the trade should have been suffered to continue under such a princess, and after such solemn expressions as those which she has been described to have uttered, can be only attributed to the pains taken by those concerned in it to keep her ignorant of the truth.  From England I now pass over to France. Labat, a Roman missionary, in his account of the isles of America, mentions, that Louis the Thirteenth was very uneasy when he was about to issue the edict, by which all Africans coming into his colonies were to be made slaves, and that this uneasiness continued, till he was assured, that the introduction of them in this capacity into his foreign dominions was the readiest way of converting them to the principles of the Christian religion.  These, then, were the first forerunners in the great cause of the abolition of the Slave-trade. Nor have their services towards it been of small moment. For, in the first place, they have enabled those, who came after them, and who took an active interest in the same cause, to state the great authority of their opinions and of their example. They have enabled them, again, to detail the history connected with these, in consequence of which circumstances have been laid open, which it is of great importance to know. For have they not enabled them to state, that the African Slave-trade never would have been permitted to exist but for the ignorance of those in authority concerning it--That at its commencement there was a revolting of nature against it--a suspicion--a caution--a fear--both as to its unlawfulness and its effects? Have they not enabled them to state, that falsehoods were advanced, and these concealed under the mask of religion, to deceive those who had the power to suppress it? Have they not enabled them to state that this trade began in piracy, and that it was continued upon the principles of force? And, finally, have not they, who have been enabled to make these statements, knowing all the circumstances connected with them, found their own zeal increased and their own courage and perseverance strengthened; and have they not, by the communication of them to others, produced many friends and even labourers in the cause?     CHAPTER III.  _Forerunners continued to 1787--divided from this time into four classes--First class consists principally of persons in Great Britain of various description--Godwyn--Baxter--Tryon--Southern--Primatt-- Montesquieu--Hutcheson--Sharp--Ramsay--and a multitude of others, whose names and services follow._   I have hitherto traced the history of the forerunners in this great cause only up to about the year 1640. If I am to pursue my plan, I am to trace it to the year 1787. But in order to show what I intend in a clearer point of view, I shall divide those who have lived within this period, and who will now consist of persons in a less elevated station, into four classes: and I shall give to each class a distinct consideration by itself.  Several of our old English writers, though they have not mentioned the African Slave-trade, or the slavery consequent upon it, in their respective works, have yet given their testimony of condemnation against both. Thus our great Milton:--    \"O execrable son, so to aspire   Above his brethren, to himself assuming   Authority usurpt, from God not given;   He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,   Dominion absolute; that right we hold   By his donation;--but man over men   He made not lord, such title to himself   Reserving, human left from human free.\"  I might mention bishop Saunderson and others, who bore a testimony equally strong against the lawfulness of trading in the persons of men, and of holding them in bondage, but as I mean to confine myself to those, who have favoured the cause of the Africans specifically, I cannot admit their names into any of the classes which have been announced.  Of those who compose the first class, defined as it has now been, I cannot name any individual who took a part in this cause till between the years 1670 and 1680. For in the year 1640, and for a few years afterwards, the nature of the trade and of the slavery was but little known, except to a few individuals, who were concerned in them; and it is obvious that these would neither endanger their own interest nor proclaim their own guilt by exposing it. The first, whom I shall mention, is Morgan Godwyn, a clergyman of the established church.

He gave it to the world, at the time mentioned, under the title of \"The Negros and Indians Advocate.\" In this treatise he lays open the situation of these oppressed people, of whose sufferings he had been an eye-witness in the island of Barbadoes. He calls forth the pity of the reader in an affecting manner, and exposes with a nervous eloquence the brutal sentiments and conduct of their oppressors. This seems to have been the first work undertaken in England expressly in favour of the cause.  The next person, whom I shall mention, is Richard Baxter, the celebrated divine among the Nonconformists. In his Christian Directory, published about the same time as the Negros and Indians Advocate, he gives advice to those masters in foreign plantations, who have Negros and other slaves. In this he protests loudly against this trade. He says expressly that they, who go out as pirates, and take away poor Africans, or people of another land, who never forfeited life or liberty, and make them slaves and sell them, are the worst of robbers, and ought to be considered as the common enemies of mankind; and that they, who buy them, and use them as mere beasts for their own convenience, regardless of their spiritual welfare, are fitter to be called demons than Christians. He then proposes several queries, which he answers in a clear and forcible manner, showing the great inconsistency of this traffic, and the necessity of treating those then in bondage with tenderness and a due regard to their spiritual concerns.  The Directory of Baxter was succeeded by a publication called \"Friendly Advice to the Planters: in three parts.\" The first of these was, \"A brief Treatise of the principal Fruits and Herbs that grow in Barbadoes, Jamaica, and other Plantations in the West Indies.\" The second was, \"The Negros Complaint, or their hard Servitude, and the Cruelties practised upon them by divers of their Masters professing Christianity.\" And the third was, \"A Dialogue between an Ethiopian and a Christian, his Master, in America.\" In the last of these, Thomas Tryon, who was the author, inveighs both against the commerce and the slavery of the Africans, and in a striking manner examines each by the touchstone of reason, humanity, justice, and religion.  In the year 1696, Southern brought forward his celebrated tragedy of Oronooko, by means of which many became enlightened upon the subject, and interested in it. For this tragedy was not a representation of fictitious circumstances, but of such as had occurred in the colonies, and as had been communicated in a publication by Mrs. Behn.  The person, who seems to have noticed the subject next was Dr. Primatt. In his \"Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy, and on the Sin of Cruelty to Brute-animals,\" he takes occasion to advert to the subject of the African Slave-trade. \"It has pleased God,\" says he, \"to cover some men with white skins and others with black; but as there is neither merit nor demerit in complexion, the white man, notwithstanding the barbarity of custom and prejudice, can have no right by virtue of his colour to enslave and tyrannize over the black man. For whether a man be white or black, such he is by God's appointment, and, abstractedly considered, is neither a subject for pride, nor an object of contempt.\"  After Dr. Primatt, we come to baron Montesquieu. \"Slavery,\" says he, \"is not good in itself. It is neither useful to the master nor to the slave. Not to the slave, because he can do nothing from virtuous motives. Not to the master, because he contracts among his slaves all sorts of bad habits, and accustoms himself to the neglect of all the moral virtues. He becomes haughty, passionate, obdurate, vindictive, voluptuous, and cruel.\" And with respect to this particular species of slavery he proceeds to say, \"it is impossible to allow the Negros are men, because, if we allow them to be men, it will begin to be believed that we ourselves are not Christians.\"  Hutcheson, in his System of Moral Philosophy, endeavours to show that he, who detains another by force in slavery, can make no good title to him, and adds, \"Strange that in any nation where a sense of liberty prevails, and where the Christian religion is professed, custom and high prospect of gain can so stupefy the consciences of men and all sense of natural justice, that they can hear such computations made about the value of their fellow-men and their liberty without abhorrence and indignation!\"  Foster, in his Discourses on Natural Religion and Social Virtue, calls the slavery under our consideration \"a criminal and outrageous violation of the natural rights of mankind.\" I am sorry that I have not room to say all that he says on this subject. Perhaps the following beautiful extracts may suffice:      \"But notwithstanding this, we ourselves, who profess to be     Christians, and boast of the peculiar advantages we enjoy by means     of an express revelation of our duty from heaven, are in effect     these very untaught and rude heathen countries. With all our     superior light we instil into those, whom we call savage and     barbarous, the most despicable opinion of human nature. We, to the     utmost of our power, weaken and dissolve the universal tie, that     binds and unites mankind. We practise what we should exclaim     against as the utmost excess of cruelty and tyranny, if nations of     the world, differing in colour and form of government from     ourselves, were so possessed of empire, as to be able to reduce us     to a state of unmerited and brutish servitude. Of consequence we     sacrifice our reason, our humanity, our christianity, to an     unnatural sordid gain. We teach other nations to despise and     trample under foot all the obligations of social virtue. We take     the most effectual method to prevent the propagation of the gospel,     by representing it as a scheme of power and barbarous oppression,     and an enemy to the natural privileges and rights of man.\"      \"Perhaps all that I have now offered may be of very little weight     to restrain this enormity, this aggravated iniquity. However, I     shall still have the satisfaction of having entered my private     protest against a practice, which, in my opinion, bids that God,     who is the God and Father of the Gentiles unconverted to     Christianity, most daring and bold defiance, and spurns at all the     principles both of natural and revealed religion.\"  The next author is sir Richard Steele, who, by means of the affecting story of Inkle and Yarico, holds up this trade again to our abhorrence.  In the year 1735, Atkins, who was a surgeon in the navy, published his Voyage to Guinea, Brazil, and the West-Indies, in his Majesty's ships Swallow and Weymouth. In this work he describes openly the manner of making the natives slaves, such as by kidnapping, by unjust accusations and trials, and by other nefarious means. He states also the cruelties practised upon them by the white people, and the iniquitous ways and dealings of the latter, and answers their argument, by which they insinuated that the condition of the Africans was improved by their transportation to other countries.  From this time the trade beginning to be better known, a multitude of persons of various stations and characters sprung up, who by exposing it are to be mentioned among the forerunners and coadjutors in the cause.  Pope, in his Essay on Man, where he endeavours to show that happiness in the present depends, among other things, upon the hope of a future state, takes an opportunity of exciting compassion in behalf of the poor African, while he censures the avarice and cruelty of his master:    \"Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind   Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;   His soul proud Science never taught to stray   Far as the solar walk, or milky-way;   Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n   Behind the cloud-topt hill an humbler heav'n;   Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd,   Some happier island in the watry waste,   Where slaves once more their native land behold,   No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.\"  Thomson also, in his Seasons, marks this traffic as destructive and cruel, introducing the well-known fact of sharks following the vessels employed in it;    \"Increasing still the sorrows of those storms,   His jaws horrific arm'd with three-fold fate,   Here dwells the direful shark. Lur'd by the scent   Of steaming crowds, of rank disease, and death,   Behold! he rushing cuts the briny flood,   Swift as the gale can bear the ship along,   And from the partners of that cruel trade,   Which spoils unhappy Guinea of her sons,   Demands his share of prey, demands themselves.   The stormy fates descend: one death involves   Tyrants and slaves; when straight their mangled limbs   Crashing at once, he dyes the purple seas   With gore, and riots in the vengeful meal.\"  Neither was Richard Savage forgetful in his poems of the Injured Africans: he warns their oppressors of a day of retribution for their barbarous conduct. Having personified Public Spirit, he makes her speak on the subject in the following manner:--    \"Let by my specious name no tyrants rise,   And cry, while they enslave, they civilize!   Know, Liberty and I are still the same   Congenial--ever mingling flame with flame!   Why must I Afric's sable children see   Vended for slaves, though born by nature free,   The nameless tortures cruel minds invent   Those to subject whom Nature equal meant?   If these you dare (although unjust success   Empow'rs you now unpunish'd to oppress),   Revolving empire you and yours may doom--   (Rome all subdu'd--yet Vandals vanquish'd Rome)   Yes--Empire may revolt--give them the day,   And yoke may yoke, and blood may blood repay.\"  Wallis, in his System of the Laws of Scotland, maintains, that \"neither men nor governments have a"]]]
