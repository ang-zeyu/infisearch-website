But, what merit they can build upon having joined with a Protestant army, under a King they acknowledged, to defend their own liberties and properties against a Popish enemy under an abdicated King; is, I confess to me absolutely inconceivable; and I believe will equally be so for ever, to any reasonable man.  When these sectaries were several years ago making the same attempt for abolishing the Test, many groundless reports were industriously and seasonably spread, of an invasion threatened by the Pretender on the north of Ireland. At which time the Presbyterians in their pamphlets, argued in a menacing manner, that if the Pretender should invade those parts of the kingdom, where the numbers and estates of dissenters chiefly lay; they would sit still, and let us fight our own battles;[12] since they were to reap no advantage, whichever side should be victors. If this were the course they intended to take in such a case; I should desire to know, how they could contrive safely to stand neuters, otherwise than by a compact with the Pretender and his army, to support their neutrality, and protect them against the forces of the Crown? This is a necessary supposition; because they must otherwise have inevitably been a prey to both. However, by this frank declaration, they sufficiently shewed their good-will; and confirmed the common charge laid at their door; that a Scottish or northern Presbyterian hates our Episcopal Established Church more than Popery itself. And, the reason for this hatred, is natural enough; because it is the Church alone, that stands in the way between them and power, which Popery doth not.  [Footnote 12: See the poem, reprinted by Monck Mason (\"History of St. Patrick's,\" p. 388 note), entitled:    \"The Grunters' request   To take off the Test,\"  in which the poet advises his \"lauds\" to \"faight y'er ain battel.\" [T.S.]]  Upon this occasion I am in some doubt, whether the political spreaders of those chimerical invasions, made a judicious choice in fixing the northern parts of Ireland for that romantic enterprize. Nor, can I well understand the wisdom of the Presbyterians in countenancing and confirming those reports. Because it seems to cast a most infamous reflection upon the loyalty and religious principles of their whole body: For if there had been any truth in the matter, the consequence must have been allowed, that the Pretender counted upon more assistance from his father's friends the Presbyterians, by choosing to land in those very parts, where their number, wealth, and power most prevailed; rather than among those of his own religion. And therefore, in charity to this sect, I rather incline to believe, that those reports of an invasion were formed and spread by the race of small politicians, in order to do a seasonable job.  As to Popery in general, which for a thousand years past hath been introducing and multiplying corruptions both in doctrine and discipline; I look upon it to be the most absurd system of Christianity professed by any nation. But I cannot apprehend this kingdom to be in much danger from it. The estates of Papists are very few; crumbling into small parcels, and daily diminishing. Their common people are sunk in poverty, ignorance, and cowardice, and of as little consequence as women and children. Their nobility and gentry are at least one-half ruined, banished, or converted: They all soundly feel the smart of what they suffered in the last Irish war. Some of them are already retired into foreign countries; others as I am told, intend to follow them; and the rest, I believe, to a man, who still possess any lands, are absolutely determined never to hazard them again for the sake of establishing their superstition. If it hath been thought fit, as some observe, to abate of the law's rigour against Popery in this kingdom, I am confident it was done for very wise reasons, considering the situation of affairs abroad at different times, and the interest of the Protestant religion in general. And as I do not find the least fault in this proceeding; so I do not conceive why a sunk discarded party, who neither expect nor desire anything more than a quiet life; should under the names of highflyers, Jacobites, and many other vile appellations, be charged so often in print, and at common tables, with endeavouring to introduce Popery and the Pretender; while the Papists abhor them above all other men, on account of severities against their priests in her late Majesty's reign; when the now disbanded reprobate party was in power. This I was convinced of some years ago by a long journey into the southern parts; where I had the curiosity to send for many priests of the parishes I passed through; and, to my great satisfaction found them everywhere abounding in professions of loyalty to the late King George; for which they gave me the reasons above-mentioned; at the same time complaining bitterly of the hardships they suffered under the Queen's last ministry.  I return from this digression to the modest demands of the Presbyterians for a repeal of the Sacramental Test, as a reward for their merits at the Restoration and the Revolution; which merits I have fairly represented as well as my memory will allow me. If I have committed any mistakes they must be of little moment. The facts and principal circumstances are what I have obtained and digested, from reading the histories of those times, written by each party; and many thousands have done the same as well as I, who I am sure have in their minds drawn the same conclusions.  This is the faction, and these the men, who are now resuming their applications, and giving in their bills of merit to both kingdoms upon two points, which of all others, they have the least pretensions to offer. I have collected the facts with all possible impartiality, from the current histories of those times; and have shewn, although very briefly, the gradual proceedings of those sectaries under the denomination of Puritans, Presbyterians, and Independents, for about the space of an hundred and eighty years, from the beginning of Queen Elizabeth to this present time. But, notwithstanding all that can be said, these very schismatics (for such they are in temporals as well as spirituals) are now again expecting, soliciting, and demanding, (not without insinuating threats, according to their custom) that the Parliament should fix them upon an equal foot with the Church established. I would fain know to what branch of the legislature they can have the forehead to apply. Not to my lords the bishops; who must have often read, how the predecessors of this very faction, acting upon the same principles, drove the whole bench out of the house; who were then, and hitherto continue one of the three estates. Not to the temporal peers, the second of the three estates; who must have heard, that, immediately after those rebellious fanatics had murdered their king, they voted a House of Lords to be useless and dangerous, and would let them sit no longer, otherwise than when elected as commoners: Not to the House of Commons; who must have heard, that in those fanatic times the Presbyterian and Independent commanders in the army, by military power, expelled all the moderate men out of the house, and left a Rump to govern the nation. Lastly, not to the Crown, which those very saints destined to rule the earth, trampled under their feet, and then in cold blood murdered the blessed wearer.  But, the session now approaching, and a clan of dissenting teachers being come up to town from their northern headquarters, accompanied by many of their elders and agents, and supported by a general contribution, to solicit their establishment, with a capacity of holding all military as well as civil employments; I think it high time, that this paper should see the light. However, I cannot conclude without freely confessing, that if the Presbyterians should obtain their ends, I could not be sorry to find them mistaken in the point which they have most at heart by the repeal of the Test; I mean the benefit of employments. For, after all, what assurance can a Scottish northern dissenter, born on Irish ground, have, that he shall be treated with as much favour as a true Scot born beyond the Tweed?  I am ready enough to believe that all I have said will avail but little. I have the common excuse of other men, when I think myself bound by all religious and civil ties, to discharge my conscience, and to warn my countrymen upon this important occasion. It is true, the advocates for this scheme promise a new world, after this blessed work shall be completed: that all animosities and faction must immediately drop; that the only distinction in this kingdom will then be of Papist and Protestant. For, as to Whig and Tory, High Church and Low Church, Jacobite and Hanoverian, Court and Country party, English and Irish interests, Dissenters and Conformists, New Light and Old Light, Anabaptist and Independent, Quaker and Muggletonian, they will all meet and jumble together into a perfect harmony, at the sessions and assizes, on the bench and in the revenues; and upon the whole, in all civil and military trust, not excepting the great councils of the nation. For it is wisely argued thus, that a kingdom being no more than a larger knot of friends met together, it is against the rules of good manners to shut any person out of the company, except the Papists; who profess themselves of another club.  I am at a loss to know what arts the Presbyterian sect intends to use, in convincing the world of their loyalty to kingly government; which long before the prevalence, or even the birth of their independent rivals, as soon as the King's forces were overcome, declared their principles to be against monarchy, as well as Episcopacy and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12750"],["title","The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents (#0)"],["body","STOLEN BACILLUS AND OTHER INCIDENTS  BY H.G.

THE TREASURE IN THE FOREST     THE STOLEN BACILLUS   \"This again,\" said the Bacteriologist, slipping a glass slide under the microscope, \"is a preparation of the celebrated Bacillus of cholera--the cholera germ.\"  The pale-faced man peered down the microscope. He was evidently not accustomed to that kind of thing, and held a limp white hand over his disengaged eye. \"I see very little,\" he said.  \"Touch this screw,\" said the Bacteriologist; \"perhaps the microscope is out of focus for you. Eyes vary so much. Just the fraction of a turn this way or that.\"  \"Ah! now I see,\" said the visitor. \"Not so very much to see after all. Little streaks and shreds of pink. And yet those little particles, those mere atomies, might multiply and devastate a city! Wonderful!\"  He stood up, and releasing the glass slip from the microscope, held it in his hand towards the window. \"Scarcely visible,\" he said, scrutinising the preparation. He hesitated. \"Are these--alive? Are they dangerous now?\"  \"Those have been stained and killed,\" said the Bacteriologist. \"I wish, for my own part, we could kill and stain every one of them in the universe.\"  \"I suppose,\" the pale man said with a slight smile, \"that you scarcely care to have such things about you in the living--in the active state?\"  \"On the contrary, we are obliged to,\" said the Bacteriologist. \"Here, for instance--\" He walked across the room and took up one of several sealed tubes. \"Here is the living thing. This is a cultivation of the actual living disease bacteria.\" He hesitated, \"Bottled cholera, so to speak.\"  A slight gleam of satisfaction appeared momentarily in the face of the pale man.  \"It's a deadly thing to have in your possession,\" he said, devouring the little tube with his eyes. The Bacteriologist watched the morbid pleasure in his visitor's expression. This man, who had visited him that afternoon with a note of introduction from an old friend, interested him from the very contrast of their dispositions. The lank black hair and deep grey eyes, the haggard expression and nervous manner, the fitful yet keen interest of his visitor were a novel change from the phlegmatic deliberations of the ordinary scientific worker with whom the Bacteriologist chiefly associated. It was perhaps natural, with a hearer evidently so impressionable to the lethal nature of his topic, to take the most effective aspect of the matter.  He held the tube in his hand thoughtfully. \"Yes, here is the pestilence imprisoned. Only break such a little tube as this into a supply of drinking-water, say to these minute particles of life that one must needs stain and examine with the highest powers of the microscope even to see, and that one can neither smell nor taste--say to them, 'Go forth, increase and multiply, and replenish the cisterns,' and death--mysterious, untraceable death, death swift and terrible, death full of pain and indignity--would be released upon this city, and go hither and thither seeking his victims. Here he would take the husband from the wife, here the child from its mother, here the statesman from his duty, and here the toiler from his trouble. He would follow the water-mains, creeping along streets, picking out and punishing a house here and a house there where they did not boil their drinking-water, creeping into the wells of the mineral-water makers, getting washed into salad, and lying dormant in ices. He would wait ready to be drunk in the horse-troughs, and by unwary children in the public fountains. He would soak into the soil, to reappear in springs and wells at a thousand unexpected places. Once start him at the water supply, and before we could ring him in, and catch him again, he would have decimated the metropolis.\"  He stopped abruptly. He had been told rhetoric was his weakness.  \"But he is quite safe here, you know--quite safe.\"  The pale-faced man nodded. His eyes shone. He cleared his throat. \"These Anarchist--rascals,\" said he, \"are fools, blind fools--to use bombs when this kind of thing is attainable. I think--\"  A gentle rap, a mere light touch of the finger-nails was heard at the door. The Bacteriologist opened it. \"Just a minute, dear,\" whispered his wife.  When he re-entered the laboratory his visitor was looking at his watch. \"I had no idea I had wasted an hour of your time,\" he said. \"Twelve minutes to four. I ought to have left here by half-past three. But your things were really too interesting. No, positively I cannot stop a moment longer. I have an engagement at four.\"  He passed out of the room reiterating his thanks, and the Bacteriologist accompanied him to the door, and then returned thoughtfully along the passage to his laboratory. He was musing on the ethnology of his visitor. Certainly the man was not a Teutonic type nor a common Latin one. \"A morbid product, anyhow, I am afraid,\" said the Bacteriologist to himself. \"How he gloated on those cultivations of disease-germs!\" A disturbing thought struck him. He turned to the bench by the vapour-bath, and then very quickly to his writing-table. Then he felt hastily in his pockets, and then rushed to the door. \"I may have put it down on the hall table,\" he said.  \"Minnie!\" he shouted hoarsely in the hall.  \"Yes, dear,\" came a remote voice.  \"Had I anything in my hand when I spoke to you, dear, just now?\"  Pause.  \"Nothing, dear, because I remember--\"  \"Blue ruin!\" cried the Bacteriologist, and incontinently ran to the front door and down the steps of his house to the street.  Minnie, hearing the door slam violently, ran in alarm to the window. Down the street a slender man was getting into a cab. The Bacteriologist, hatless, and in his carpet slippers, was running and gesticulating wildly towards this group. One slipper came off, but he did not wait for it. \"He has gone _mad_!\" said Minnie; \"it's that horrid science of his\"; and, opening the window, would have called after him. The slender man, suddenly glancing round, seemed struck with the same idea of mental disorder. He pointed hastily to the Bacteriologist, said something to the cabman, the apron of the cab slammed, the whip swished, the horse's feet clattered, and in a moment cab, and Bacteriologist hotly in pursuit, had receded up the vista of the roadway and disappeared round the corner.  Minnie remained straining out of the window for a minute. Then she drew her head back into the room again. She was dumbfounded. \"Of course he is eccentric,\" she meditated. \"But running about London--in the height of the season, too--in his socks!\" A happy thought struck her. She hastily put her bonnet on, seized his shoes, went into the hall, took down his hat and light overcoat from the pegs, emerged upon the doorstep, and hailed a cab that opportunely crawled by. \"Drive me up the road and round Havelock Crescent, and see if we can find a gentleman running about in a velveteen coat and no hat.\"  \"Velveteen coat, ma'am, and no 'at. Very good, ma'am.\" And the cabman whipped up at once in the most matter-of-fact way, as if he drove to this address every day in his life.  Some few minutes later the little group of cabmen and loafers that collects round the cabmen's shelter at Haverstock Hill were startled by the passing of a cab with a ginger-coloured screw of a horse, driven furiously.  They were silent as it went by, and then as it receded--\"That's 'Arry 'Icks. Wot's _he_ got?\" said the stout gentleman known as Old Tootles.  \"He's a-using his whip, he is, _to_ rights,\" said the ostler boy.  \"Hullo!\" said poor old Tommy Byles; \"here's another bloomin' loonatic. Blowed if there aint.\"  \"It's old George,\" said old Tootles, \"and he's drivin' a loonatic, _as_ you say. Aint he a-clawin' out of the keb? Wonder if he's after 'Arry 'Icks?\"  The group round the cabmen's shelter became animated. Chorus: \"Go it, George!\" \"It's a race.\" \"You'll ketch 'em!\" \"Whip up!\"  \"She's a goer, she is!\" said the ostler boy.  \"Strike me giddy!\" cried old Tootles. \"Here! _I'm_ a-goin' to begin in a minute. Here's another comin'. If all the kebs in Hampstead aint gone mad this morning!\"  \"It's a fieldmale this time,\" said the ostler boy.  \"She's a followin' _him_,\" said old Tootles. \"Usually the other way about.\"  \"What's she got in her 'and?\"  \"Looks like a 'igh 'at.\"  \"What a bloomin' lark it is! Three to one on old George,\" said the ostler boy. \"Nexst!\"  Minnie went by in a perfect roar of applause. She did not like it but she felt that she was doing her duty, and whirled on down Haverstock Hill and Camden Town High Street with her eyes ever intent on the animated back view of old George, who was driving her vagrant husband so incomprehensibly away from her.  The man in the foremost cab sat crouched in the corner, his arms tightly folded, and the little tube that contained such vast possibilities of destruction gripped in his hand. His mood was a singular mixture of fear and exultation. Chiefly he was afraid of being caught before he could accomplish his purpose, but behind this was a vaguer but larger fear of the awfulness"]]]
