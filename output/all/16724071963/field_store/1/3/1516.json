For those who were criminal offenders simple execution was not always considered severe enough; the right hand might first be amputated, the criminal then hanged and his head cut off, and his body quartered and the parts suspended in public places. Sometimes the hanging was in chains, and several instances of burning are on record. A master was regularly reimbursed by the government for a slave legally executed, and in 1714 there was a complaint in South Carolina that the treasury had become almost exhausted by such reimbursements. In Massachusetts hanging was the worst legal penalty, but the obsolete common-law punishment was revived in 1755 to burn alive a slave-woman who had killed her master in Cambridge.[3]  [Footnote 1: Blake: _History of Slavery and the Slave-Trade_, 378.]  [Footnote 2: Ballagh: _Slavery in Virginia_, 12.]  [Footnote 3: Edward Eggleston: \"Social Conditions in the Colonies,\" in _Century Magazine_, October, 1884, p. 863.]  The relations between the free Negro and the slave might well have given cause for concern. Above what was after all only an artificial barrier spoke the call of race and frequently of kindred. Sometimes at a later date jealousy arose when a master employed a free Negro to work with his slaves, the one receiving pay and the others laboring without compensation. In general, however, the two groups worked like brothers, each giving the other the benefit of any temporary advantage that it possessed. Sometimes the free Negro could serve by reason of the greater freedom of movement that he had, and if no one would employ him, or if, as frequently happened, he was browbeaten and cheated out of the reward of his labor, the slave might somehow see that he got something to eat. In a state of society in which the relation of master and slave was the rule, there was of course little place for either the free Negro or the poor white man. When the pressure became too great the white man moved away; the Negro, finding himself everywhere buffeted, in the colonial era at least had little choice but to work out his salvation at home as well as he could. More and more character told, and if a man had made himself known for his industry and usefulness, a legislative act might even be passed permitting him to remain in the face of a hostile law. Even before 1700 there were in Virginia families in which both parents were free colored persons and in which every effort was made to bring up the children in honesty and morality. When some prosperous Negroes found themselves able to do so, they occasionally purchased Negroes, who might be their own children or brothers, in order to give them that protection without which on account of recent manumission they might be required to leave the colony in which they were born. Thus, whatever the motive, the tie that bound the free Negro and the slave was a strong one; and in spite of the fact that Negroes who owned slaves were generally known as hard masters, as soon as any men of the race began to be really prominent their best endeavor was devoted to the advancement of their people. It was not until immediately after the Revolutionary War, however, that leaders of vision and statesmanship began to be developed.  It was only the materialism of the eighteenth century that accounted for the amazing development of the system of Negro slavery, and only this that defeated the benevolence of Oglethorpe's scheme for the founding of Georgia. As yet there was no united protest--no general movement for freedom; and as Von Holst said long afterwards, \"If the agitation had been wholly left to the churches, it would have been long before men could have rightly spoken of 'a slavery question.'\" The Puritans, however, were not wholly unmindful of the evil, and the Quakers were untiring in their opposition, though it was Roger Williams who in 1637 made the first protest that appears in the colonies.[1] Both John Eliot and Cotton Mather were somewhat generally concerned about the harsh treatment of the Negro and the neglect of his spiritual welfare. Somewhat more to the point was Richard Baxter, the eminent English nonconformist, who was a contemporary of both of these men. \"Remember,\" said he, in speaking of Negroes and other slaves, \"that they are of as good a kind as you; that is, they are reasonable creatures as well as you, and born to as much natural liberty. If their sin have enslaved them to you, yet Nature made them your equals.\" On the subject of man-stealing he is even stronger: \"To go as pirates and catch up poor Negroes or people of another land, that never forfeited life or liberty, and to make them slaves, and sell them, is one of the worst kinds of thievery in the world.\" Such statements, however, were not more than the voice of individual opinion. The principles of the Quakers carried them far beyond the Puritans, and their history shows what might have been accomplished if other denominations had been as sincere and as unselfish as the Society of Friends. The Germantown protest of 1688 has already been remarked. In 1693 George Keith, in speaking of fugitives, quoted with telling effect the text, \"Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee\" (Deut. 23.15). In 1696 the Yearly Meeting in Pennsylvania first took definite action in giving as its advice \"that Friends be careful not to encourage the bringing in of any more Negroes; and that such that have Negroes, be careful of them, bring them to meetings, have meetings with them in their families, and restrain them from loose and lewd living as much as in them lies, and from rambling abroad on First-days or other times.\"[2] As early as 1713 the Quakers had in mind a scheme for freeing the Negroes and returning them to Africa, and by 1715 their efforts against importation had seriously impaired the market for slaves in Philadelphia. Within a century after the Germantown protest the abolition of slavery among the Quakers was practically accomplished.  [Footnote 1: For this and the references immediately following note Locke: _Anti-Slavery in America_, 11-45.]  [Footnote 2: _Brief Statement of the Rise and Progress of the Testimony of the Religious Society of Friends against Slavery and the Slave-Trade_, 8.]  In the very early period there seems to have been little objection to giving a free Negro not only religious but also secular instruction; indeed he might be entitled to this, as in Virginia, where in 1691 the church became the agency through which the laws of Negro apprenticeship were carried out; thus in 1727 it was ordered that David James, a free Negro boy, be bound to Mr. James Isdel, who was to \"teach him to read the Bible distinctly, also the trade of a gunsmith\" and \"carry him to the clerk's office and take indenture to that purpose.\"[1] In general the English church did a good deal to provide for the religious instruction of the free Negro; \"the reports made in 1724 to the English bishop by the Virginia parish ministers are evidence that the few free Negroes in the parishes were permitted to be baptized, and were received into the church when they had been taught the catechism.\"[2] Among Negroes, moreover, as well as others in the colonies the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts was active. As early as 1705, in Goose Creek Parish in South Carolina, among a population largely recently imported from Africa, a missionary had among his communicants twenty blacks who well understood the English tongue.[3] The most effective work of the Society, however, was in New York, where as early as 1704 a school was opened by Elias Neau, a Frenchman who after several years of imprisonment because of his Protestant faith had come to New York to try his fortune as a trader. In 1703 he had called the attention of the Society to the Negroes who were \"without God in the world, and of whose souls there was no manner of care taken,\" and had suggested the appointment of a catechist. He himself was prevailed upon to take up the work and he accordingly resigned his position as an elder in the French church and conformed to the Church of England. He worked with success for a number of years, but in 1712 was embarrassed by the charge that his school fomented the insurrection that was planned in that year. He finally showed, however, that only one of his students was in any way connected with the uprising.  [Footnote 1: Russell: _The Free Negro in Virginia_, 138-9.]  [Footnote 2: _Ibid_., 138.]  [Footnote 3: C.E. Pierre, in _Journal of Negro History_, October, 1916, p. 350.]  From slave advertisements of the eighteenth century[1] we may gain many sidelights not only on the education of Negroes in the colonial era, but on their environment and suffering as well. One slave \"can write a pretty good hand; plays on the fife extremely well.\" Another \"can both read and write and is a good fiddler.\" Still others speak \"Dutch and good English,\" \"good English and High Dutch,\" or \"Swede and English well.\" Charles Thomas of Delaware bore the following remarkable characterization: \"Very black, has white teeth ... has had his left leg broke ... speaks both French and English, and is a very great rogue.\" One man who came from the West Indies \"was born in Dominica and speaks French, but very little English; he is a very ill-natured fellow and has been much cut in his back by often whipping.\" A Negro named Simon who in 1740 ran away in Pennsylvania \"could bleed and draw teeth pretending to be a great doctor.\" Worst of all the incidents of slavery, however, was the lack of regard for home ties, and this situation of course obtained in the North as well as the South. In the early part of the eighteenth century marriages in New York were by mutual consent only, without the blessing of the church, and burial was in a common field"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12103"],["title","The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle (#0)"],["body","Sanchez, and Matthew Sanchez      THE TALE OF MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE  BY BEATRIX POTTER  Author of \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\", &c.  1905    For  THE REAL LITTLE LUCIE OF NEWLANDS     ONCE upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town.  She was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket- handkerchiefs!  One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying-- oh, she did cry so!  \"I've lost my pocket-handkin!  Three handkins and a pinny!  Have you seen them, Tabby Kitten?\"  THE Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen--  \"Sally Henny-penny, have you found three pocket-handkins?\"  But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--  \"I go barefoot,  barefoot, barefoot!\"  AND then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.  Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.  Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town--a hill that goes up-up--into the clouds as though it had no top!  And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.  LUCIE scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!  PRESENTLY she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.  Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup!  And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a very small person.  Lucie ran on, and on.  THE path ended under a big rock.  The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes  pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!  But there was something else--a  door!  straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--  \"Lily-white and clean, oh! With little frills between, oh! Smooth and hot--red rusty spot Never here be seen, oh!\"  LUCIE, knocked--once-- twice, and interrupted the song.  A little frightened voice called out \"Who's that?\"  Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged  floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.  THERE was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring  anxiously at Lucie.  Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron  over her striped petticoat.  Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where Lucie had yellow curls--that little person had PRICKLES!  \"Who are you?\" said Lucie.  \"Have you seen my  pocket-handkins?\" The little person made a bob-curtsey--\"Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear-starcher!\"  And she took something out of a clothes- basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.  \"What's that thing?\" said Lucie--\"that's not by pocket-handkin?\" \"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!\" And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.  Then she took something else off a clothes-horse-- \"That isn't my pinny?\" said Lucie. \"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine!  It's very bad to wash!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.  MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE'S nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.  \"THERE'S one of my pocket-handkins!\" cried Lucie--\"and there's my pinny!\" Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.  \"Oh that is lovely!\" said Lucie.  \"AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?\"  \"Oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny --look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard!  She'll very soon go barefoot!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.  \"WHY, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?\" \"Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it did so smell of onions!  I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the smell.\"  \"There's another one of mine,\" said Lucie.  \"WHAT are those funny little white things?\" \"That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes then herself.\" \"There's my last pocket- handkin!\" said Lucie.  \"AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch?\" \"They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Tits-mouse --most terrible particular!\" said Mrs. Tiddy-winkle. \"Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes.\"  \"WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things?\" said Lucie. \"Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.\"  \"Will their jackets take-off?\" asked Lucie.  \"Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder.  And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town. They're always marked at washing!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.  AND she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes-- small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black mole-skin waist coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing --and at last the basket was empty!  THEN Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before a fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.  Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were hair-pins sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit to near her.  WHEN they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.  And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.  THEN away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle and the bundles of clothes!  All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met was Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!  AND she gave them their Nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.  SO that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle.  Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say, \"Good-Night,\" and to thank the washer-woman-- But what a very odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill! She was running running running up the hill--and Where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat?  AND how small she had grown--and how brown --and covered with prickles! Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a hedgehog.       *   *   *   *   *  (Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile-- but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety pin? And besides--I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells--and besides I am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)"]]]
