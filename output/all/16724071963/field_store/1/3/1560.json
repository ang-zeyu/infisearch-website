Although the work of opening the great house was begun immediately, and a thorough cleaning was in progress from garret to cellar, Brossard did not believe that his master would really be at home before the end of the week. He made his own plans accordingly, although he hurried Henri relentlessly with the cleaning.  As soon as Joyce heard the news she made an excuse to slip away, and ran down to the field to Jules. She found him paler than usual, and there was a swollen look about his eyes that made her think that maybe he had been crying.  \"What's the matter?\" she asked. \"Aren't you glad that your uncle is coming home?\"  Jules gave a cautious glance over his shoulder towards the house, and then looked up at Joyce. Heretofore, some inward monitor of pride had closed his lips about himself whenever he had been with her, but, since the Thanksgiving Day that had made them such firm friends, he had wished every hour that he could tell her of his troubles. He felt that she was the only person in the world who took any interest in him. Although she was only three years older than himself, she had that motherly little way with her that eldest daughters are apt to acquire when there is a whole brood of little brothers and sisters constantly claiming attention.  So when Joyce asked again, \"What's the matter, Jules?\" with so much anxious sympathy in her face and voice, the child found himself blurting out the truth.  \"Brossard beat me again last night,\" he exclaimed. Then, in response to her indignant exclamation, he poured out the whole story of his ill-treatment. \"See here!\" he cried, in conclusion, unbuttoning his blouse and baring his thin little shoulders. Great red welts lay across them, and one arm was blue with a big mottled bruise.  Joyce shivered and closed her eyes an instant to shut out the sight that brought the quick tears of sympathy.  \"Oh, you poor little thing!\" she cried. \"I'm going to tell madame.\"  \"No, don't!\" begged Jules. \"If Brossard ever found out that I had told anybody, I believe that he would half kill me. He punishes me for the least thing. I had no breakfast this morning because I dropped an old plate and broke it.\"  \"Do you mean to say,\" cried Joyce, \"that you have been out here in the field since sunrise without a bite to eat?\"  Jules nodded.  \"Then I'm going straight home to get you something.\" Before he could answer she was darting over the fields like a little flying squirrel.  \"Oh, what if it were Jack!\" she kept repeating as she ran. \"Dear old Jack, beaten and starved, without anybody to love him or say a kind word to him.\" The mere thought of such misfortune brought a sob.  In a very few minutes Jules saw her coming across the field again, more slowly this time, for both hands were full, and without their aid she had no way to steady the big hat that flapped forward into her eyes at every step. Jules eyed the food ravenously. He had not known how weak and hungry he was until then.  \"It will not be like this when your uncle comes home,\" said Joyce, as she watched the big mouthfuls disappear down the grateful little throat. Jules shrugged his shoulders, answering tremulously, \"Oh, yes, it will be lots worse. Brossard says that my Uncle Martin has a terrible temper, and that he turned his poor sister and my grandfather out of the house one stormy might. Brossard says he shall tell him how troublesome I am, and likely he will turn me out, too. Or, if he doesn't do that, they will both whip me every day.\"  Joyce stamped her foot. \"I don't believe it,\" she cried, indignantly. \"Brossard is only trying to scare you. Your uncle is an old man now, so old that he must be sorry for the way he acted when he was young. Why, of course he must be,\" she repeated, \"or he never would have brought you here when you were left a homeless baby. More than that, I believe he will be angry when he finds how you have been treated. Maybe he will send Brossard away when you tell him.\"  \"I would not dare to tell him,\" said Jules, shrinking back at the bare suggestion.  \"Then _I_ dare,\" cried Joyce with flashing eyes. \"I am not afraid of Brossard or Henri or your uncle, or any man that I ever knew. What's more, I intend to march over here just as soon as your uncle comes home, and tell him right before Brossard how you have been treated.\"  Jules gasped in admiration of such reckless courage. \"Seems to me Brossard himself would be afraid of you if you looked at him that way.\" Then his voice sank to a whisper. \"Brossard is afraid of one thing, I've heard him tell Henri so, and that is _ghosts_. They talk about them every night when the wind blows hard and makes queer noises in the chimney. Sometimes they are afraid to put out their candles for fear some evil spirit might be in the room.\"  \"I'm glad he is afraid of something, the mean old thing!\" exclaimed Joyce. For a few moments nothing more was said, but Jules felt comforted now that he had unburdened his long pent up little heart. He reached out for several blades of grass and began idly twisting them around his finger.  Joyce sat with her hands clasped over her knees, and a wicked little gleam in her eyes that boded mischief. Presently she giggled as if some amusing thought had occurred to her, and when Jules looked up inquiringly she began noiselessly clapping her hands together.  \"I've thought of the best thing,\" she said. \"I'll fix old Brossard now. Jack and I have played ghost many a time, and have even scared each other while we were doing it, because we were so frightful-looking. We put long sheets all over us and went about with pumpkin jack-o'-lanterns on our heads. Oh, we looked awful, all in white, with fire shining out of those hideous eyes and mouths. If I knew when Brossard was likely to whip you again, I'd suddenly appear on the scene and shriek out like a banshee and make him stop. Wouldn't it be lovely?\" she cried, more carried away with the idea the longer she thought of it. \"Why, it would be like acting our fairy story. You are the Prince, and I will be the giant scissors and rescue you from the Ogre. Now let me see if I can think of a rhyme for you to say whenever you need me.\"  Joyce put her hands over her ears and began to mumble something that had no meaning whatever for Jules: \"Ghost--post--roast--toast,--no that will never do; need--speed deed,--no! Help--yelp (I wish I could make him yelp),--friend--spend--lend,--that's it. I shall try that.\"  There was a long silence, during which Joyce whispered to herself with closed eyes. \"Now I've got it,\" she announced, triumphantly, \"and it's every bit as good as Cousin Kate's:       \"Giant scissors, fearless friend,      Hasten, pray, thy aid to lend.  \"If you could just say that loud enough for me to hear I'd come rushing in and save you.\"  Jules repeated the rhyme several times, until he was sure that he could remember it, and then Joyce stood up to go.  \"Good-by, fearless friend,\" said Jules. \"I wish I were brave like you.\" Joyce smiled in a superior sort of way, much flattered by the new title. Going home across the field she held her head a trifle higher than usual, and carried on an imaginary conversation with Brossard, in which she made him quail before her scathing rebukes.  Joyce did not take her usual walk that afternoon. She spent the time behind locked doors busy with paste, scissors, and a big muff-box, the best foundation she could find for a jack-o'-lantern. First she covered the box with white paper and cut a hideous face in one side,--great staring eyes, and a frightful grinning mouth. With a bit of wire she fastened a candle inside and shut down the lid.  \"Looks too much like a box yet,\" she said, after a critical examination. \"It needs some hair and a beard. Wonder what I can make it of.\" She glanced all around the room for a suggestion, and then closed her eyes to think. Finally she went over to her bed, and, turning the covers back from one corner, began ripping a seam in the mattress. When the opening was wide enough she put in her thumb and finger and pulled out a handful of the curled hair. \"I can easily put it back when I have used it, and sew up the hole in the mattress,\" she said to her conscience. \"My! This is exactly what I needed.\" The hair was mixed, white and black, coarse and curly as a negro's wool.  She covered the top of the pasteboard head with it, and was so pleased that she added long beard and fierce mustache to the already hideous mouth. When that was all done she took it into a dark closet and lighted the candle. The monster's head glared at her from the depth of the closet, and she skipped back and forth in front of it, wringing her hands in delight.  \"Oh, if Jack could only see it! If he could only see it!\" she kept exclaiming. \"It is better than any pumpkin head we ever made, and scary enough to throw old Brossard into a fit. I can hardly wait until it is dark enough to go over.\"  Meanwhile the short winter day drew on towards the close. Jules, out in the field with the goats, walked back and forth, back and forth, trying to keep warm. Brossard, who had gone five miles down the Paris road to bargain about some grain, sat comfortably in a little tobacco shop, with a pipe in his mouth and a glass and bottle on the table at his elbow. Henri was at home, still scrubbing and cleaning. The front of the great house was in order, with even the fires laid on all the hearths ready for lighting. Now he was scrubbing the back stairs. His brush bumped noisily against the steps, and the sound of its scouring was nearly drowned by the jerky tune which the old fellow sung through his nose as he worked.  A carriage drove slowly down the road and stopped at the gate with the scissors; then, in obedience to some command from within, the vehicle drove on to the smaller gate beyond. An old man with white hair and bristling mustache slowly alighted. The master had come home. He put out his hand as if to ring"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12187"],["title","The Mystery of 31 New Inn (#0)"],["body","MYSTERY OF 31 NEW INN  BY R. AUSTIN FREEMAN  Author of \"The Red Thumb Mark,\" \"The Eye of Osiris,\" etc.     TO MY FRIEND  BERNARD E. BISHOP     Preface   Commenting upon one of my earlier novels, in respect of which I had claimed to have been careful to adhere to common probabilities and to have made use only of really practicable methods of investigation, a critic remarked that this was of no consequence whatever, so long as the story was amusing.  Few people, I imagine, will agree with him. To most readers, and certainly to the kind of reader for whom an author is willing to take trouble, complete realism in respect of incidents and methods is an essential factor in maintaining the interest of a detective story. Hence it may be worth while to mention that Thorndyke's method of producing the track chart, described in Chapters II and III, has been actually used in practice. It is a modification of one devised by me many years ago when I was crossing Ashanti to the city of Bontuku, the whereabouts of which in the far interior was then only vaguely known. My instructions were to fix the positions of all towns, villages, rivers and mountains as accurately as possible; but finding ordinary methods of surveying impracticable in the dense forest which covers the whole region, I adopted this simple and apparently rude method, checking the distances whenever possible by astronomical observation.  The resulting route-map was surprisingly accurate, as shown by the agreement of the outward and homeward tracks, It was published by the Royal Geographical Society, and incorporated in the map of this region compiled by the Intelligence Branch of the War Office, and it formed the basis of the map which accompanied my volume of <i>Travels in Ashanti and Jaman</i>. So that Thorndyke's plan must be taken as quite a practicable one.  New Inn, the background of this story, and one of the last surviving inns of Chancery, has recently passed away after upwards of four centuries of newness. Even now, however, a few of the old, dismantled houses (including perhaps, the mysterious 31) may be seen from the Strand peeping over the iron roof of the skating rink which has displaced the picturesque hall, the pension-room and the garden. The postern gate, too, in Houghton Street still remains, though the arch is bricked up inside. Passing it lately, I made the rough sketch which appears on next page, and which shows all that is left of this pleasant old London backwater.  R. A. F.

Many of these experiences I have already placed on record; but it now occurs to me that I have hitherto left unrecorded one that is, perhaps, the most astonishing and incredible of the whole series; an adventure, too, that has for me the added interest that it inaugurated my permanent association with my learned and talented friend, and marked the close of a rather unhappy and unprosperous period of my life.  Memory, retracing the journey through the passing years to the starting-point of those strange events, lands me in a shabby little ground-floor room in a house near the Walworth end of Lower Kennington Lane. A couple of framed diplomas on the wall, a card of Snellen's test-types and a stethoscope lying on the writing-table, proclaim it a doctor's consulting-room; and my own position in the round-backed chair at the said table, proclaims me the practitioner in charge.  It was nearly nine o'clock. The noisy little clock on the mantelpiece announced the fact, and, by its frantic ticking, seemed as anxious as I to get the consultation hours over. I glanced wistfully at my mud-splashed boots and wondered if I might yet venture to assume the slippers that peeped coyly from under the shabby sofa. I even allowed my thoughts to wander to the pipe that reposed in my coat pocket. Another minute and I could turn down the surgery gas and shut the outer door. The fussy little clock gave a sort of preliminary cough or hiccup, as if it should say: \"Ahem! ladies and gentlemen, I am about to strike.\" And at that moment, the bottle-boy opened the door and, thrusting in his head, uttered the one word: \"Gentleman.\"  Extreme economy of words is apt to result in ambiguity. But I understood. In Kennington Lane, the race of mere men and women appeared to be extinct. They were all gentlemen--unless they were ladies or children--even as the Liberian army was said to consist entirely of generals. Sweeps, labourers, milkmen, costermongers--all were impartially invested by the democratic bottle-boy with the rank and title of <i>armigeri</i>. The present nobleman appeared to favour the aristocratic recreation of driving a cab or job-master's carriage, and, as he entered the room, he touched his hat, closed the door somewhat carefully, and then, without remark, handed me a note which bore the superscription \"Dr. Stillbury.\"  \"You understand,\" I said, as I prepared to open the envelope, \"that I am not Dr. Stillbury. He is away at present and I am looking after his patients.\"  \"It doesn't signify,\" the man replied. \"You'll do as well.\"  On this, I opened the envelope and read the note, which was quite brief, and, at first sight, in no way remarkable.  \"DEAR SIR,\" it ran, \"Would you kindly come and see a friend of mine who is staying with me? The bearer of this will give you further particulars and convey you to the house. Yours truly, H. WEISS.\"  There was no address on the paper and no date, and the writer was unknown to me.  \"This note,\" I said, \"refers to some further particulars. What are they?\"  The messenger passed his hand over his hair with a gesture of embarrassment. \"It's a ridicklus affair,\" he said, with a contemptuous laugh. \"If I had been Mr. Weiss, I wouldn't have had nothing to do with it. The sick gentleman, Mr. Graves, is one of them people what can't abear doctors. He's been ailing now for a week or two, but nothing would induce him to see a doctor. Mr. Weiss did everything he could to persuade him, but it was no go. He wouldn't. However, it seems Mr. Weiss threatened to send for a medical man on his own account, because, you see, he was getting a bit nervous; and then Mr. Graves gave way. But only on one condition. He said the doctor was to come from a distance and was not to be told who he was or where he lived or anything about him; and he made Mr. Weiss promise to keep to that condition before he'd let him send. So Mr. Weiss promised, and, of course, he's got to keep his word.\"  \"But,\" I said, with a smile, \"you've just told me his name--if his name really is Graves.\"  \"You can form your own opinion on that,\" said the coachman.  \"And,\" I added, \"as to not being told where he lives, I can see that for myself. I'm not blind, you know.\"  \"We'll take the risk of what you see,\" the man replied. \"The question is, will you take the job on?\"  Yes; that was the question, and I considered it for some time before replying. We medical men are pretty familiar with the kind of person who \"can't abear doctors,\" and we like to have as little to do with him as possible. He is a thankless and unsatisfactory patient. Intercourse with him is unpleasant, he gives a great deal of trouble and responds badly to treatment. If this had been my own practice, I should have declined the case off-hand. But it was not my practice. I was only a deputy. I could not lightly refuse work which would yield a profit to my principal, unpleasant though it might be.  As I turned the matter over in my mind, I half unconsciously scrutinized my visitor--somewhat to his embarrassment--and I liked his appearance as little as I liked his mission. He kept his station near the door, where the light was dim--for the illumination was concentrated on the table and the patient's chair--but I could see that he had a somewhat sly, unprepossessing face and a greasy, red moustache that seemed out of character with his rather perfunctory livery; though this was mere prejudice. He wore a wig, too--not that there was anything discreditable in that--and the thumb-nail of the hand that held his hat bore disfiguring traces of some injury--which, again, though unsightly, in no wise reflected on his moral character. Lastly, he watched me keenly with a mixture of anxiety and sly complacency that I found distinctly unpleasant. In a general way, he impressed me disagreeably. I did not like the look of him at all; but nevertheless I decided to undertake the case.  \"I suppose,\" I answered, at length, \"it is no affair of mine who the patient is or where he lives. But how do you propose to manage the business? Am I to be led to the house blindfolded, like the visitor to the bandit's cave?\"  The man grinned slightly and looked very decidedly relieved.  \"No, sir,\" he answered; \"we ain't going to blindfold you. I've got a carriage outside. I don't think you'll see much out of that.\"  \"Very well,\" I rejoined, opening the door to let him out, \"I'll be with you in a minute. I suppose you can't give me any idea as to what is the matter with the patient?\"  \"No, sir, I can't,\" he replied; and he went out to see to the carriage.  I slipped into a bag an assortment of emergency drugs and a few diagnostic instruments, turned down the gas and passed "]]]
