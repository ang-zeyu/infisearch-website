Let her come;   She challenges the planet of Doom, And naught shall save her--not her iron bark.  _Slip anchor, all! and at her, all!_   _Bear down with rushing beaks--and_ now! First the Monongahela struck--and reeled;     The Lackawana’s prow Next crashed--crashed, but not crashing; then   The Admiral rammed, and rasping nigh   Sloped in a broadside, which glanced by: The Monitors battered at her adamant den.  The Chickasaw plunged beneath the stern   And pounded there; a huge wrought orb From the Manhattan pierced one wall, but dropped;     Others the seas absorb. Yet stormed on all sides, narrowed in,   Hampered and cramped, the bad one fought--   Spat ribald curses from the port Who shutters, jammed, locked up this Man-of-Sin.  No pause or stay. They made a din   Like hammers round a boiler forged; Now straining strength tangled itself with strength,     Till Hate her will disgorged. The white flag showed, the fight was won--   Mad shouts went up that shook the Bay;   But pale on the scarred fleet’s decks there lay A silent man for every silenced gun.  And quiet far below the wave,   Where never cheers shall move their sleep, Some who did boldly, nobly earn them, lie--     Charmed children of the deep. But decks that now are in the seed,   And cannon yet within the mine,   Shall thrill the deeper, gun and pine, Because of the Tecumseh’s glorious deed.    Sheridan at Cedar Creek. (October, 1864.)   Shoe the steed with silver   That bore him to the fray, When he heard the guns at dawning--       Miles away; When he heard them calling, calling--     Mount! nor stay:       Quick, or all is lost;       They’ve surprised and stormed the post,       They push your routed host--   Gallop! retrieve the day.  House the horse in ermine--   For the foam-flake blew White through the red October;   He thundered into view; They cheered him in the looming,   Horseman and horse they knew.       The turn of the tide began,       The rally of bugles ran,       He swung his hat in the van;   The electric hoof-spark flew.  Wreathe the steed and lead him--   For the charge he led Touched and turned the cypress   Into amaranths for the head Of Philip, king of riders,   Who raised them from the dead.       The camp (at dawning lost),       By eve, recovered--forced,       Rang with laughter of the host   At belated Early fled.  Shroud the horse in sable--   For the mounds they heap! There is firing in the Valley,   And yet no strife they keep; It is the parting volley,   It is the pathos deep.       There is glory for the brave       Who lead, and noblys ave,       But no knowledge in the grave   Where the nameless followers sleep.    In the Prison Pen. (1864.)   Listless he eyes the palisades   And sentries in the glare; ’Tis barren as a pelican-beach--   But his world is ended there.  Nothing to do; and vacant hands   Bring on the idiot-pain; He tries to think--to recollect,   But the blur is on his brain.  Around him swarm the plaining ghosts   Like those on Virgil’s shore-- A wilderness of faces dim,   And pale ones gashed and hoar.  A smiting sun. No shed, no tree;   He totters to his lair-- A den that sick hands dug in earth   Ere famine wasted there,  Or, dropping in his place, he swoons,   Walled in by throngs that press, Till forth from the throngs they bear him dead--   Dead in his meagreness.    The College Colonel.   He rides at their head;   A crutch by his saddle just slants in view, One slung arm is in splints, you see,   Yet he guides his strong steed--how coldly too.  He brings his regiment home--   Not as they filed two years before, But a remnant half-tattered, and battered, and worn, Like castaway sailors, who--stunned     By the surf’s loud roar,   Their mates dragged back and seen no more-- Again and again breast the surge,   And at last crawl, spent, to shore.  A still rigidity and pale--   An Indian aloofness lones his brow; He has lived a thousand years Compressed in battle’s pains and prayers,   Marches and watches slow.  There are welcoming shouts, and flags;   Old men off hat to the Boy, Wreaths from gay balconies fall at his feet,   But to _him_--there comes alloy.  It is not that a leg is lost,   It is not that an arm is maimed. It is not that the fever has racked--   Self he has long disclaimed.  But all through the Seven Day’s Fight,   And deep in the wilderness grim, And in the field-hospital tent,   And Petersburg crater, and dim Lean brooding in Libby, there came--   Ah heaven!--what _truth_ to him.    The Eagle of the Blue.[12]   Aloft he guards the starry folds   Who is the brother of the star; The bird whose joy is in the wind   Exultleth in the war.  No painted plume--a sober hue,   His beauty is his power; That eager calm of gaze intent   Foresees the Sibyl’s hour.  Austere, he crowns the swaying perch,   Flapped by the angry flag; The hurricane from the battery sings,   But his claw has known the crag.  Amid the scream of shells, his scream   Runs shrilling; and the glare Of eyes that brave the blinding sun   The vollied flame can bear.  The pride of quenchless strength is his--   Strength which, though chained, avails; The very rebel looks and thrills--   The anchored Emblem hails.  Though scarred in many a furious fray,   No deadly hurt he knew; Well may we think his years are charmed--   The Eagle of the Blue.    A Dirge for McPherson,[13] Killed in front of Atlanta. (July, 1864.)   Arms reversed and banners craped--     Muffled drums; Snowy horses sable-draped--     McPherson comes.        _But, tell us, shall we know him more,       Lost-Mountain and lone Kenesaw?_  Brave the sword upon the pall--     A gleam in gloom; So a bright name lighteth all     McPherson’s doom.  Bear him through the chapel-door--     Let priest in stole Pace before the warrior     Who led. Bell--toll!  Lay him down within the nave,     The Lesson read-- Man is noble, man is brave,     But man’s--a weed.  Take him up again and wend     Graveward, nor weep: There’s a trumpet that shall rend     This Soldier’s sleep.  Pass the ropes the coffin round,     And let descend; Prayer and volley--let it sound     McPherson’s end.        _True fame is his, for life is o’er--       Sarpedon of the mighty war._    At the Cannon’s Mouth. Destruction of the Ram Albermarle by the Torpedo-Launch. (October, 1864.)   Palely intent, he urged his keel   Full on the guns, and touched the spring; Himself involved in the bolt he drove Timed with the armed hull’s shot that stove His shallop--die or do! Into the flood his life he threw,   Yet lives--unscathed--a breathing thing To marvel at.                He has his fame; But that mad dash at death, how name?  Had Earth no charm to stay the Boy   From the martyr-passion? Could he dare Disdain the Paradise of opening joy   Which beckons the fresh heart every where? Life has more lures than any girl   For youth and strength; puts forth a share Of beauty, hinting of yet rarer store; And ever with unfathomable eyes,     Which baffingly entice, Still strangely does Adonis draw. And life once over, who shall tell the rest? Life is, of all we know, God’s best. What imps these eagles then, that they Fling disrespect on life by that proud way In which they soar above our lower clay.  Pretense of wonderment and doubt unblest:   In Cushing’s eager deed was shown   A spirit which brave poets own-- That scorn of life which earns life’s crown;   Earns, but not always wins; but he--   The star ascended in his nativity.    The March to the Sea. (December, 1864.)   Not Kenesaw high-arching,   Nor Allatoona’s glen-- Though there the graves lie parching--   Stayed Sherman’s miles of men; From charred Atlanta marching   They launched the sword again.         The columns streamed like rivers           Which in their course agree,         And they streamed until their flashing           Met the flashing of the sea:             It was glorious glad marching,             That marching to the sea.  They brushed the foe before them   (Shall gnats impede the bull?); Their own good bridges bore them   Over swamps or torrents full, And the grand pines waving o’er them   Bowed to axes keen and cool.         The columns grooved their channels.           Enforced their own decree,         And their power met nothing larger           Until it met the sea:             It was glorious glad marching,             A marching glad and free.  Kilpatrick’s snare of riders   In zigzags mazed the land, Perplexed the pale Southsiders   With feints on every hand; Vague menace awed the hiders   In forts beyond command.         To Sherman’s shifting problem           No foeman knew the key;         But onward went the marching           Unpausing to the sea:             It was glorious glad marching,             The swinging step was free.  The flankers ranged like pigeons   In clouds through field or wood; The flocks of all those regions,   The herds and horses good, Poured in and swelled the legions,   For they caught the marching mood.         A volley ahead! They hear it;           And they hear the repartee:         Fighting was but frolic           In that marching to the sea:             It was glorious glad marching,             A marching bold and free.  All nature felt their coming,   The birds like couriers flew, And the banners brightly blooming   The slaves by thousands drew, And they marched beside the drumming,   And they joined the armies blue.         The cocks crowed from the cannon           (Pets named from Grant and Lee),         Plumed fighters and campaigners           In the marching to the sea:             It was glorious glad marching,             For every man was free.  The foragers through calm lands   Swept in tempest gay, And they breathed the air of balm-lands   Where rolled savannas lay, And they helped themselves from farm-lands--   As who should say them nay?         The regiments uproarious           Laughed in Plenty’s glee;         And they marched till their broad laughter  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12384"],["title","Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (#8)"],["body","         Met the laughter of the sea:             It was glorious glad marching,             That marching to the sea.  The grain of endless acres   Was threshed (as in the East) By the trampling of the Takers,   Strong march of man and beast; The flails of those earth-shakers   Left a famine where they ceased.         The arsenals were yielded;           The sword (that was to be),         Arrested in the forging,           Rued that marching to the sea:             It was glorious glad marching,             But ah, the stern decree!  For behind they left a wailing,   A terror and a ban, And blazing cinders sailing,   And houseless households wan, Wide zones of counties paling,   And towns where maniacs ran.         Was it Treason’s retribution--           Necessity the plea?         They will long remember Sherman           And his streaming columns free--             They will long remember Sherman             Marching to the sea.    The Frenzy in the Wake.[14] Sherman’s advance through the Carolinas. (February, 1865.)   So strong to suffer, shall we be   Weak to contend, and break The sinews of the Oppressor’s knee   That grinds upon the neck?     O, the garments rolled in blood       Scorch in cities wrapped in flame,     And the African--the imp!       He gibbers, imputing shame.  Shall Time, avenging every woe,   To us that joy allot Which Israel thrilled when Sisera’s brow   Showed gaunt and showed the clot?     Curse on their foreheads, cheeks, and eyes--       The Northern faces--true     To the flag we hate, the flag whose stars       Like planets strike us through.  From frozen Maine they come,   Far Minnesota too; They come to a sun whose rays disown--   May it wither them as the dew!     The ghosts of our slain appeal:       “Vain shall our victories be”     But back from its ebb the flood recoils--       Back in a whelming sea.  With burning woods our skies are brass,   The pillars of dust are seen; The live-long day their cavalry pass--   No crossing the road between.     We were sore deceived--an awful host!       They move like a roaring wind.     Have we gamed and lost? but even despair       Shall never our hate rescind.    The Fall of Richmond. The tidings received in the Northern Metropolis. (April, 1865.)   What mean these peals from every tower,   And crowds like seas that sway? The cannon reply; they speak the heart   Of the People impassioned, and say-- A city in flags for a city in flames,   Richmond goes Babylon’s way--         _Sing and pray._  O weary years and woeful wars,   And armies in the grave; But hearts unquelled at last deter The helmed dilated Lucifer--   Honor to Grant the brave, Whose three stars now like Orion’s rise   When wreck is on the wave--         _Bless his glaive._  Well that the faith we firmly kept,   And never our aim forswore For the Terrors that trooped from each recess When fainting we fought in the Wilderness,   And Hell made loud hurrah; But God is in Heaven, and Grant in the Town,   And Right through might is Law--         _God’s way adore._    The Surrender at Appomattox. (April, 1865.)   As billows upon billows roll,   On victory victory breaks; Ere yet seven days from Richmond’s fall   And crowning triumph wakes The loud joy-gun, whose thunders run   By sea-shore, streams, and lakes.     The hope and great event agree     In the sword that Grant received from Lee.  The warring eagles fold the wing,   But not in Cæsar’s sway; Not Rome o’ercome by Roman arms we sing,   As on Pharsalia’s day, But Treason thrown, though a giant grown,   And Freedom’s larger play.     All human tribes glad token see     In the close of the wars of Grant and Lee.    A Canticle: Significant of the national exaltation of enthusiasm at the close of the War.   O the precipice Titanic   Of the congregated Fall, And the angle oceanic   Where the deepening thunders call--     And the Gorge so grim,     And the firmamental rim! Multitudinously thronging   The waters all converge, Then they sweep adown in sloping   Solidity of surge.      The Nation, in her impulse       Mysterious as the Tide,     In emotion like an ocean       Moves in power, not in pride;     And is deep in her devotion       As Humanity is wide.          Thou Lord of hosts victorious,           The confluence Thou hast twined;         By a wondrous way and glorious           A passage Thou dost find--           A passage Thou dost find:         Hosanna to the Lord of hosts,           The hosts of human kind.  Stable in its baselessness   When calm is in the air, The Iris half in tracelessness   Hovers faintly fair. Fitfully assailing it   A wind from heaven blows, Shivering and paling it   To blankness of the snows; While, incessant in renewal,   The Arch rekindled grows, Till again the gem and jewel   Whirl in blinding overthrows-- Till, prevailing and transcending,   Lo, the Glory perfect there, And the contest finds an ending,   For repose is in the air.  But the foamy Deep unsounded,   And the dim and dizzy ledge, And the booming roar rebounded,   And the gull that skims the edge!     The Giant of the Pool     Heaves his forehead white as wool-- Toward the Iris every climbing   From the Cataracts that call-- Irremovable vast arras   Draping all the Wall.      The Generations pouring       From times of endless date,     In their going, in their flowing       Ever form the steadfast State;     And Humanity is growing       Toward the fullness of her fate.          Thou Lord of hosts victorious,           Fulfill the end designed;         By a wondrous way and glorious           A passage Thou dost find--           A passage Thou dost find:         Hosanna to the Lord of hosts,           The hosts of human kind.    The Martyr. Indicative of the passion of the people on the 15th of April, 1865.   Good Friday was the day   Of the prodigy and crime, When they killed him in his pity,   When they killed him in his prime Of clemency and calm--     When with yearning he was filled     To redeem the evil-willed, And, though conqueror, be kind;   But they killed him in his kindness,   In their madness and their blindness, And they killed him from behind.          There is sobbing of the strong,           And a pall upon the land;         But the People in their weeping             Bare the iron hand:         Beware the People weeping           When they bare the iron hand.  He lieth in his blood--   The father in his face; They have killed him, the Forgiver--   The Avenger takes his place, [15] The Avenger wisely stern,     Who in righteousness shall do     What the heavens call him to, And the parricides remand;   For they killed him in his kindness,   In their madness and their blindness, And his blood is on their hand.          There is sobbing of the strong,           And a pall upon the land;         But the People in their weeping             Bare the iron hand:         Beware the People weeping           When they bare the iron hand.    “The Coming Storm:” A Picture by S.R. Gifford, and owned by E.B. Included in the N.A. Exhibition, April, 1865.   All feeling hearts must feel for him   Who felt this picture. Presage dim-- Dim inklings from the shadowy sphere   Fixed him and fascinated here.  A demon-cloud like the mountain one   Burst on a spirit as mild As this urned lake, the home of shades.   But Shakspeare’s pensive child  Never the lines had lightly scanned,   Steeped in fable, steeped in fate; The Hamlet in his heart was ’ware,   Such hearts can antedate.  No utter surprise can come to him   Who reaches Shakspeare’s core; That which we seek and shun is there--     Man’s final lore.    Rebel Color-bearers at Shiloh:[16] A plea against the vindictive cry raised by civilians shortly after the surrender at Appomattox.   The color-bearers facing death White in the whirling sulphurous wreath,   Stand boldly out before the line Right and left their glances go, Proud of each other, glorying in their show; Their battle-flags about them blow,   And fold them as in flame divine: Such living robes are only seen Round martyrs burning on the green-- And martyrs for the Wrong have been.  Perish their Cause! but mark the men-- Mark the planted statues, then Draw trigger on them if you can.  The leader of a patriot-band Even so could view rebels who so could stand;   And this when peril pressed him sore, Left aidless in the shivered front of war--   Skulkers behind, defiant foes before, And fighting with a broken brand. The challenge in that courage rare-- Courage defenseless, proudly bare-- Never could tempt him; he could dare Strike up the leveled rifle there.  Sunday at Shiloh, and the day When Stonewall charged--McClellan’s crimson May, And Chickamauga’s wave of death, And of the Wilderness the cypress wreath--     All these have passed away. The life in the veins of Treason lags, Her daring color-bearers drop their flags,   And yield. _Now_ shall we fire?     Can poor spite be? Shall nobleness in victory less aspire Than in reverse? Spare Spleen her ire,   And think how Grant met Lee.    The Muster:[17] Suggested by the Two Days’ Review at Washington (May, 1865.)   The Abrahamic river--   Patriarch of floods, Calls the roll of all his streams   And watery mutitudes:       Torrent cries to torrent,         The rapids hail the fall;       With shouts the inland freshets         Gather to the call.      The quotas of the Nation,       Like the water-shed of waves,     Muster into union--       Eastern warriors, Western braves.      Martial strains are mingling,       Though distant far the bands,     And the wheeling of the squadrons       Is like surf upon the sands.      The bladed guns are gleaming--       Drift in lengthened trim,     Files on files for hazy miles--       Nebulously dim.      O Milky Way of armies--       Star rising after star,     New banners of the Commonwealths,       And eagles of the War.  The Abrahamic river   To sea-wide fullness fed, Pouring from the thaw-lands   By the God of floods"]]]
