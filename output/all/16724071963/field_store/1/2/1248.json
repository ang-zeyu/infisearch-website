All three cousins had birthdays in January. The Mortons always celebrated the birthdays of every member of the family, but since there were three in the same month they usually had one large party and noticed the other days with less ceremony. This year Mrs. Emerson, Ethel Brown's grandmother, had invited the whole United Service Club, to which the girls belonged, to go to New York on a day's expedition. They had ascended the Woolworth Tower, gone through the Natural History Museum, seen the historic Jumel Mansion, lunched at a large hotel and gone to the Hippodrome. Everybody called it a perfectly splendid party, and Ethel Blue and Dorothy were quite willing to consider it as a part of their own birthday observances.  Next year it would be Dorothy's turn. This year her party had consisted merely in taking her cousins on an automobile ride. A similar ride had been planned for Ethel Blue's birthday, but the giants had plans of their own and the young people had had to give way to them. Dorothy had come over to spend the afternoon and dine with her cousins, however. She lived just around the corner, so her mother was willing to let her go in spite of the gathering drifts, because Roger, Ethel Brown's older brother, would be able to take her home such a short distance, even if he had to shovel a path all the way.  The snow was so beautiful that they had not wanted to do anything all the afternoon but gaze at it. Dicky, Ethel Brown's little brother, who was the \"honorary member\" of the U.S.C., had come in wanting to be amused, and they had opened the window for an inch and brought in a few of the huge flakes which grew into ferns and starry crystals under the magnifying glass that Mrs. Morton always kept on the desk.  \"Wouldn't it be fun if our eyeth could thee thingth like that!\" exclaimed Dicky, and the girls agreed with him that it would add many marvels to our already marvellous world.  \"As long as our eyes can't see the wee things I'm glad Aunt Marion taught us to use this glass when we were little,\" said Ethel Blue who had been brought up with her cousins ever since she was a baby.  \"Mother says that when she and Uncle Roger and Uncle Richard,\" said Dorothy, referring to Ethel Brown's and Ethel Blue's fathers, her uncles--\"were all young at home together Grandfather Morton used to make them examine some new thing every day and tell him about it. Sometimes it would be the materials a piece of clothing was made of, or the paper of a magazine or a flower--anything that came along.\"  [Illustration: \"It looked just as if it were a house with a lot of rooms\"]  \"When I grow up,\" said Ethel Blue, \"I'm going to have a large microscope like the one they have in the biology class in the high school. Helen took me to the class with her one day and the teacher let me look through it. It was perfectly wonderful. There was a slice of the stem of a small plant there and it looked just as if it were a house with a lot of rooms. Each room was a cell, Helen said.\"  \"A very suitable name,\" commented Ethel Brown.  \"What are you people talking about?\" asked Helen, who came in at that instant.  \"I was telling the girls about that time when I looked through the high school microscope,\" answered Ethel Blue.  [Illustration: Single Cell]  [Illustration: Double Cell]  \"You saw among other things, some cells in the very lowest form of life. A single cell is all there is to the lowest animal or vegetable.\"  [Illustration: Multiple Cells]  \"What do you mean by a single cell?\"  \"Just a tiny mass of jelly-like stuff that is called protoplasm. The cells grow larger and divide until there are a lot of them. That's the way plants and animals grow.\"  \"If each is as small as those I saw under the microscope there must be billions in me!\" and Ethel Blue stretched her arms to their widest extent and threw her head upwards as far as her neck would allow.  \"I guess there are, young woman,\" and Helen went off to hang her snowy coat where it would dry before she put it in the closet.  \"There'th a thnow flake that lookth like a plant!\" cried Dicky who had slipped open the window wide enough to capture an especially large feather.  \"It really does!\" exclaimed Ethel Blue, who was nearest to her little cousin and caught a glimpse of the picture through the glass before the snow melted.  \"Did it have 'root, stem and leaves'?\" asked Dorothy. \"That's what I always was taught made a plant--root, stem and leaves. Would Helen call a cell that you couldn't see a plant?\"  \"Yes,\" came a faint answer from the hall. \"If it's living and isn't an animal it's a vegetable--though way down in the lower forms it's next to impossible to tell one from the other. There isn't any rule that doesn't have an exception.\"  \"I should think the biggest difference would be that animals eat plants and plants eat--what do plants eat?\" ended Dorothy lamely.  \"That is the biggest difference,\" assented Helen. \"Plants are fed by water and mineral substances that come from the soil directly, while animals get the mineral stuff by way of the plants.\"  \"Father told us once about some plants that caught insects. They eat animals.\"  \"And there are animals that eat both vegetables and animals, you and I, for instance. So you can't draw any sharp lines.\"  \"When a plant gets out of the cell stage and has a 'root, stem and leaves' then you know it's a plant if you don't before,\" insisted Dorothy, determined to make her knowledge useful.  \"Did any of you notice the bean I've been sprouting in my room?\" asked Helen.  \"I'll get it, I'll get it!\" shouted Dicky.  \"Trust Dicky not to let anything escape his notice!\" laughed his big sister.  Dicky returned in a minute or two carrying very carefully a shallow earthenware dish from which some thick yellow-green tips were sprouting.  \"I soaked some peas and beans last week,\" explained Helen, \"and when they were tender I planted them. You see they're poking up their heads now.\"  [Illustration: Bean Plant]  \"They don't look like real leaves,\" commented Ethel Blue.  \"This first pair is really the two halves of the bean. They hold the food for the little plant. They're so fat and pudgy that they never do look like real leaves. In other plants where there isn't so much food they become quite like their later brothers.\"  \"Isn't it queer that whatever makes the plant grow knows enough to send the leaves up and the roots down,\" said Dorothy thoughtfully.  \"That's the way the life principle works,\" agreed Helen. \"This other little plant is a pea and I want you to see if you notice any difference between it and the bean.\"  She pulled up the wee growth very delicately and they all bent over it as it lay in her hand.  \"It hathn't got fat leaveth,\" cried Dicky.  [Illustration: The Pea Plant]  \"Good for Dicky,\" exclaimed Helen. \"He has beaten you girls. You see the food in the pea is packed so tight that the pea gets discouraged about trying to send up those first leaves and gives it up as a bad job. They stay underground and do their feeding from there.\"  \"A sort of cold storage arrangement,\" smiled Ethel Brown.  \"After these peas are a little taller you'd find if you pulled them up that the supply of food had all been used up. There will be nothing down there but a husk.\"  \"What happens when this bean plant uses up all its food?\"  \"There's nothing left but a sort of skin that drops off. You can see how it works with the bean because that is done above the ground.\"  \"Won't it hurt those plants to pull them up this way?\"  \"It will set them back, but I planted a good many so as to be able to pull them up at different ages and see how they looked.\"  \"You pulled that out so gently I don't believe it will be hurt much.\"  \"Probably it will take a day or two for it to catch up with its neighbors. It will have to settle its roots again, you see.\"  \"What are you doing this planting for?\" asked Dorothy.  \"For the class at school. We get all the different kinds of seeds we can--the ones that are large enough to examine easily with only a magnifying glass like this one. Some we cut open and examine carefully inside to see how the new leaves are to be fed, and then we plant others and watch them grow.\"  \"I'd like to know why you never told me about that before?\" demanded Ethel Brown. \"I'm going to get all the grains and fruits I can right off and plant them. Is all that stuff in a horse chestnut leaf-food?\"  \"The horse chestnut is a hungry one, isn't it?\"  \"I made some bulbs blossom by putting them in a tall glass in a dark place and bringing them into the light when they had started to sprout,\" said Ethel Blue, \"but I think this is more fun. I'm going to plant some, too.\"  \"Grandmother Emerson always has beautiful bulbs. She has plenty in her garden that she allows to stay there all winter, and they come up and are scrumptious very early in the Spring. Then she takes some of them into the house and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11660"],["title","Ethel Morton's Enterprise (#1)"],["body","them in the dark, and they blossom all through the cold weather.\"  \"Mother likes bulbs, too,\" said Dorothy, \"crocuses and hyacinths and Chinese lilies--but I never cared much about them. Somehow the bulb itself looks too fat. I don't care much for fat things or people.\"  \"Don't think of it as fat; it's the food supply.\"  \"Well, I think they're greedy things, and I'm not going ever to bother with them. I'll leave them to Mother, but I am really going to plant a garden this summer. I think it will be loads of fun.\"  \"We haven't much room for a garden here,\" said Helen, \"but we always have some vegetables and a few flowers.\"  \"Why don't we have a fine one this summer, Helen?\" demanded Ethel Brown. \"You're learning a lot about the way plants grow, I should think you'd like to grow them.\"  \"I believe I should if you girls would help me. There never has been any member of the family who was interested, and I wasn't wild about it myself, and I just never got started.\"  \"The truth is,\" confessed Ethel Brown, \"if we don't have a good garden Dorothy here will have something that will put ours entirely in the shade.\"  The girls all laughed. They never had known Dorothy until the previous summer. When she came to live in Rosemont in September they had learned that she was extremely energetic and that she never abandoned any plan that she attempted. The Ethels knew, therefore, that if Dorothy was going to have a garden the next summer they'd better have a garden, too, or else they would see little of her.  \"If we both have gardens Dorothy will condescend to come and see ours once in a while and we can exchange ideas and experiences,\" continued Ethel Brown.  \"I'd love to have a garden,\" said Ethel Blue. \"Do you suppose Roger would be willing to dig it up for us?\"  \"Dig up what?\" asked Roger, stamping into the house in time to hear his name.  The girls told him of their new plan.  \"I'll help all of you if you'll plant one flower that I like; plant enough of it so that I can pick a lot any time I want to. The trouble with the little garden we've had is that there weren't enough flowers for more than the centrepiece in the dining-room. Whenever I wanted any I always had to go and give a squint at the dining room table and then do some calculation as to whether there could be a stalk or two left after Helen had cut enough for the next day.\"  \"And there generally weren't any!\" sympathized Helen.  \"What flower is it you're so crazy over?\" asked Ethel Blue.  \"Sweetpeas, my child. Never in all my life have I had enough sweetpeas.\"  \"I've had more than enough,\" groaned Ethel Brown. \"One summer I stayed a fortnight with Grandmother Emerson and I picked the sweetpeas for her every morning. She was very particular about having them picked because they blossom better if they're picked down every day.\"  \"It must have taken you an awfully long time; she always has rows and rows of them,\" said Helen.  \"I worked a whole hour in the sun every single day! If we have acres of sweetpeas we'll all have to help Roger pick.\"  \"I'm willing to,\" said Ethel Blue. \"I'm like Roger, I think they're darling; just like butterflies or something with wings.\"  \"We'll have to cast our professional eyes into the garden and decide on the best place for the sweetpeas,\" said Roger. \"They have to be planted early, you know. If we plant them just anywhere they'll be sure to be in the way of something that grows shorter so it will be hidden.\"  \"Or grows taller and is a color that fights with them.\"  \"It would be hard to find a color that wasn't matched by one sweetpea or another. They seem to be of every combination under the sun.\"  \"It's queer, some of the combinations would be perfectly hideous in a dress but they look all right in Nature's dress.\"  \"We'll send for some seedsmen's catalogues and order a lot.\"  \"I suppose you don't care what else goes into the garden?\" asked Helen.  \"Ladies, I'll do all the digging you want, and plant any old thing you ask me to, if you'll just let me have my sweetpeas,\" repeated Roger.  \"A bargain,\" cried all the girls.  \"I'll write for some seed catalogues this afternoon,\" said Helen. \"It's so appropriate, when it's snowing like this!\"  \"'Take time by the fetlock,' as one of the girls says in 'Little Women,'\" laughed Roger. \"If you'll cast your orbs out of the window you'll see that it has almost stopped. Come on out and make a snow man.\"  Every one jumped at the idea, even Helen who laid aside her writing until the evening, and there was a great putting on of heavy coats and overshoes and mittens.     CHAPTER II   A SNOW MAN AND SEED CATALOGUES  The snow was of just the right dampness to make snowballs, and a snow man, after all, is just a succession of snowballs, properly placed. Roger started the one to go at the base by rolling up a ball beside the house and then letting it roll down the bank toward the gate.  \"See it gather moss!\" he cried. \"It's just the opposite of a rolling stone, isn't it?\"  When it stopped it was of goodly size and it was standing in the middle of the little front lawn.  \"It couldn't have chosen a better location,\" commended Helen.  \"We need a statue in the front yard,\" said Ethel Brown.  \"This will give a truly artistic air to the whole place,\" agreed Ethel Blue.  \"What's the next move?\" asked Dorothy, who had not had much experience in this kind of manufacture.  \"We start over here by the fence and roll another one, smaller than this, to serve as the body,\" explained Roger. \"Come on here and help me; this snow is so heavy it needs an extra pusher already.\"  Dorothy lent her muscles to the task of pushing on the snow man's \"torso,\" as Ethel Blue, who knew something about drawing figures, called it. The Ethels, meanwhile, were making the arms out of small snowballs placed one against the next and slapped hard to make them stick. Helen was rolling a ball for the head and Dicky had disappeared behind the house to hunt for a cane.  \"Heigho!\" Roger called after him. \"I saw an old clay pipe stuck behind a beam in the woodshed the other day. See if it's still there and bring it along.\"  Dicky nodded and raised a mittened paw to indicate that he understood his instructions.  It required the united efforts of Helen and Roger to set the gentleman's head on his shoulders, and Helen ran in to the cellar to get some bits of coal to make his eyes and mouth.  \"He hasn't any expression. Let me try to model a nose for the poor lamb!\" begged Ethel Blue. \"Stick on this arm, Roger, while I sculpture these marble features.\"  By dint of patting and punching and adding a long and narrow lump of snow, one side of the head looked enough different from the other to warrant calling it the face. To make the difference more marked Dorothy broke some straws from the covering of one of the rosebushes and created hair with them.  \"Now nobody could mistake this being his speaking countenance,\" decided Helen, sticking two pieces of coal where eyes should be and adding a third for the mouth. Dicky had found the pipe and she thrust it above his lips.  \"Merely two-lips, not ruby lips,\" commented Roger. \"This is an original fellow; he's 'not like other girls.'\"  \"This cane is going to hold up his right arm; I don't feel so certain about the left,\" remarked Ethel Brown anxiously.  \"Let it fall at his side. That's some natural, anyway. He's walking, you see, swinging one arm and with the other on the top of his cane.\"  \"He'll take cold if he doesn't have something on his head. I'm nervous about him,\" and Dorothy bent a worried look at their creation.  \"Hullo,\" cried a voice from beyond the gate. \"He's bully. Just make him a cap out of this bandanna and he'll look like a Venetian gondolier.\"  James Hancock and his sister, Margaret, the Glen Point members of the United Service Club, came through the gate, congratulated Ethel Blue on her birthday, and paid elaborate compliments to the sculptors of the Gondolier.  \"That red hanky on his massive brow gives the touch of color he needed,\" said Margaret.  \"We don't maintain that his features are 'faultily faultless,'\" quoted Roger, \"but we do insist that they're 'icily regular.'\"  \"Thanks to the size of the nose Ethel Blue stuck on they're not 'splendidly null.'\"  \"No, there's no 'nullness' about that nose,\" agreed James. \"That's 'some' nose!\"  When they were all in the house and preparing for dinner Ethel Blue unwrapped the gift that Margaret had brought for her birthday. It was a shallow bowl of dull green pottery in which was growing a grove of thick, shiny leaves. The plants were three or four inches tall and seemed to be in the pink of condition.  \"This is for the top of your Christmas desk,\" Margaret explained.  \"It's perfectly beautiful,\" exclaimed not only Ethel Blue but all the other girls, while Roger peered over their shoulders to see what it was.  \"I planted it myself,\" said Margaret with considerable pride. \"Each one is a little grapefruit tree.\"  \"Grapefruit? What we have for breakfast? It grows like this?\"  \"Mother has some in a larger bowl and it is really lovely as a centrepiece on the dining room table.\"  \"Watch me save grapefruit seeds!\" and Ethel Brown ran out of the room to leave an immediate request in the kitchen that no grapefruit seeds should be thrown away when the fruit was being prepared for the table.  \"When Mr. Morton and I were in Florida last winter,\" said Mrs. Morton, \"they told us that it was not a great number of years ago that grapefruit was planted only because it was a handsome shrub on the lawn. The fruit never was eaten, but was thrown away after it fell from the tree.\"  \"Now nobody can get enough of it,\" smiled Helen.  \"Mother has a receipt for grapefruit marmalade that is better than the English orange marmalade that is made of both sweet and sour oranges,\" said Dorothy. \"Sometimes the sour oranges are hard to find in the market, but grapefruit seems to have both flavors in itself.\"  \"Is it much work?\" asked Margaret.  \"It isn't much work at any one"]]]
