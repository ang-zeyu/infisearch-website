Anyhow, the French laid claim to Syria.  By the time the war was over the Zionists had a hard-and-fast guarantee, the French claim to Syria had been admitted, and there wasn't any country left except some Arabian desert to let the Arabs have.  That's the situation.  Feisul is in Damascus, going through the farce of being proclaimed king, with the French holding the sea-ports and getting ready to oust him.  The Zionists are in Jerusalem, working like beavers, and the British are getting ready to pull out as much as possible and leave the Zionists to do their own worrying.  Mesopotamia is in a state of more or less anarchy. Egypt is like a hot-box full of explosive--may go off any minute. The Arabs would like to challenge the world to mortal combat, and then fight one another while the rest of the world pays the bill--\"  \"And you?\"  \"The French, for instance.  Their army is weak at the moment. They've neither men nor money--only a hunger to own Syria.  They don't play what the English call 'on side.'  They play a mean game.  The French General Staff figure that if Feisul should attack them now he might beat them.  So they've conceived the brilliant idea of spreading sedition and every kind of political discontent into Palestine and across the Jordan, so that if the Arabs make an effort they'll make it simultaneously in both countries.  Then the British, being in the same mess with the French, would have to take the French side and make a joint campaign of it.\"  \"But don't the British know this?\"  \"You bet they know it.  What's the Intelligence for?  The French are hiring all the Arab newspapers to preach against the British. A child could see it with his eyes shut.\"  \"Then why in thunder don't the British have a showdown?\"  \"That's where the joker comes in.  The French know there's a sort of diplomatic credo at the London Foreign Office to the general effect that England and France have got to stand together or Europe will go to pieces.  The French are realists.  They bank on that.  They tread on British corns, out here, all they want to, while they toss bouquets, backed by airplanes, across the English Channel.\"  \"Then the war didn't end the old diplomacy?\"  \"What a question!  But I haven't more than scratched the Near East surface for you yet.  There's Mustapha Kemal in Anatolia, leader of the Turkish Nationalists, no more dead or incapacitated than a possum.  He's playing for his own hand--Kaiser Willy stuff--studying Trotzky and Lenin, and flirting with Feisul's party on the side.  Then there's a Bolshevist element among the Zionists--got teeth, too.  There's an effort being made from India to intrigue among the Sikh troops employed in Palestine. There's a very strong party yelling for an American mandate.  The Armenians, poor devils, are pulling any string they can get hold of, in the hope that anything at all may happen.  The orthodox Jews are against the Zionists;  the Arabs are against them both, and furious with one another.  There's a pan-Islam movement on foot, and a pan-Turanian--both different, and opposed.  About 75 per cent of the British are as pro-Arab as they dare be, but the rest are strong for the Zionists.  And the Administrator's neutral!--strong for law and order but taking no sides.\"  \"And you?\"  \"I'm one of the men who is trying to keep the peace.\"  He invited me to stay to dinner.  The other members of the mess were trooping in, all his juniors, all obviously fond of him and boisterously irreverent of his rank.  Dinner under his chairmanship was a sort of school for repartee.  It was utterly unlike the usual British mess dinner.  If you shut your eyes for a minute you couldn't believe that any one present had ever worn a uniform.  I learned afterward that there was quite a little competition to get into that mess.  After dinner most of them trooped out again, to dance with Zionist ladies at an institute affair.  But he and I stayed, and talked until midnight.  Before I left, the key of Palestine and Syria was in my hands.  \"You seem interested,\" he said, coming with me to the door.  \"If you don't mind rough spots now and then, I'll try to show you a few things at first hand.\"      Chapter Two  \"No objection;  only a stipulation.\"   The showmanship began much sooner than I hoped.  The following day was Sunday, and I had an invitation to a sort of semi-public tea given by the American Colony after their afternoon religious service.  They received their guests in a huge, well-furnished room on the upper floor of a stone house built around a courtyard filled with flowers.  I think they were a little proud of the number of fierce-looking Arabs, who had traveled long distances in order to be present.  Ten Arab chieftains in full costume, with fifteen or twenty of their followers, all there at great expense of trouble, time and money, for friends sake, were, after all, something to feel a bit chesty about.  Every member of the Colony seemed able to talk Arabic like a native and, as they used to say in the up- state papers, a good time was being had by all.  The Near East adores ice-cream, and there was lots of it.  Two of the Arab chiefs were Christians;  the rest were not.  The peace and war record of the Colony was what had brought them all there.  Hardly an Arab in the country was not the Colony's debtor for disinterested help, direct or indirect, at some time in some way.  The American Colony was the one place in the country where a man of any creed could go and be sure that whatever he might say would not be used against him.  So they were talking their heads off.  Hot air and Arab politics have quite a lot in common. But there was a broad desert-breath about it all.  It wasn't like the little gusty yaps you hear in the city coffee-shops.  A lot of the talk was foolish, but it was all magnificent.  There was one sheikh named Mustapha ben Nasir dressed in a blue serge suit and patent-leather boots, with nothing to show his nationality except a striped silk head-dress with the camel-hair band around the forehead.  He was a handsome fellow, with a black beard trimmed to a point, and perfect manners, polished no doubt in a dozen countries, but still Eastern in slow, deferential dignity.  He could talk good French.  I fell in conversation with him.  The frankness with which treason is mooted, admitted and discussed in the Near East is one of the first things that amaze you.  They are so open about it that nobody takes them seriously. Apparently it is only when they don't talk treason openly that the ruling authorities get curious and make arrests.  To me, a total stranger, with nothing to recommend me but that for an hour or two that afternoon I was a guest of the American Colony, Mustapha ben Nasir made no bones whatever about the fact that the was being paid by the French to stir up feeling over Jordan against the British.  \"I receive a monthly salary,\" he boasted.  \"I am just from Damascus, where the French Liaison-officer paid me and gave me some instructions.\"  \"Where is your home?\" I asked him.  \"At El-Kerak, in the mountains of Moab, across the Dead Sea.  I start this evening.  Will you come with me?\"  \"Je m'en bien garderai!\"  He smiled.  \"Myself, I am in favor of the British.  The French pay my expenses, that is all.  What we all want is an independent Arab government--some say kingdom, some say republic.  If it is not time for that yet, then we would choose an American mandate. But America has deserted us.  Failing America, we prefer the English for the present.  Anything except France!  We do not want to become a new Algeria.\"  \"What is the condition now at El-Kerak?\"  \"Condition?  There is none.  There is chaos.  You see, the British say their authority ceases at the River Jordan and at a line drawn down the middle of the Dead Sea.  That leaves us with a choice between two other governments--King Hussein's government of Mecca, and Feisul's in Syria.  But Hussein's arm is not long enough to reach us from the South, and Feisul's is not nearly strong enough to interfere from the North.  So there is no government, and each man is keeping the peace with his own sword.\"  \"You mean;  each man on his own account?\"  \"Yes.  So there is peace.  Five--fifteen--thirty throats are cut daily;  and if you go down to the Jordan and listen, you will hear the shots being fired from ambush any day.\"  \"And you invite me to make the trip with you?\"  \"Oh, that is nothing.  In the first place, you are American. Nobody will interfere with an American.  They are welcome.  In the second place, there is a good reason for bringing you;  we all want an American school at El-Kerak.\"  \"But I am no teacher.\"  \"But you will be returning to America?  It is enough, then, that you look the situation over, and tell what you know on your return.  We will provide a building, a proper salary, and guarantee the teacher's life.  We would prefer a woman, but it would be wisest to send a man.\"  \"How so?  The woman might not shoot straight?  I've some of our Western women do tricks with a gun that would--\"  \"There would be no need.  She would have our word of honour.  But every sheikh who has only three wives would want to make her his fourth.  A man would be best.  Will you come with me?\"  \"On your single undertaking to protect me?  Are you king of all that countryside?\"  \"If you will come, you shall have an escort, every man of whom will die before he would let you be killed.  And if they, and you, should all be killed, their sons and grandsons would avenge you to the third generation of your murderers.\"  \"That's undoubtedly handsome, but--\"  \"Believe me, effendi,\" he urged, \"many a soul has been consoled in hell-fire by the knowledge that his adversaries would be cut off in their prime by friends who are true to their given word.\"  Meaning to back out politely, I assured him I would think the offer over.  \"Well and good,\" he answered."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11357"],["title","Jimgrim and Allah's Peace (#3)"],["body","  \"You have my promise.  Should you decide to come, leave word here with the American Colony.  They will get word to me.  Then I will send for you, and the escort shall meet you at the Dead Sea.\"  I talked it over with two or three members of the Colony, and they assured me the promise could be depended on.  One of them added:  \"Besides, you ought to see El-Kerak.  It's an old crusader city, rather ruined, but more or less the way the crusaders left it. And that craving of theirs for a school is worth doing something about, if you ever have an opportunity.  They say they have too much religion already, and no enlightenment at all.  A teacher who knew Arabic would have a first-class time, and would be well paid and protected, if he could keep his hands off politics.  Why not talk with Major Grim?\"  It was a half-hour's walk to Grim's place, but I had the good fortune to catch him in again.  He was sitting in the same chair, studying the same book, and this time I saw the title of it-- Walter Pater's Marius the Epicurean--a strange book for a soldier to be reading, and cutting its pages with an inlaid dagger, in a Jerusalem semi-military boarding-house.  But he was a man of unexpectedly assorted moods.  He laughed when I told of ben Nasir.  He looked serious when I mooted El-Kerak--serious, then interested, them speculative. From where I sat I could watch the changes in his eyes.  \"What would the escort amount to?\" I asked him.  \"Absolute security.\"  \"And what's this bunk about Americans being welcome anywhere?\"  \"Perfectly true.  All the way from Aleppo down to Beersheba.  Men like Dr. Bliss* have made such an impression that an occasional rotter might easily take advantage of it.  Americans in this country--so far--stand for altruism without ulterior motive. If we'd accepted the mandate they might have found us out! Meanwhile, an American is safe.\"  [*President of the American College at Beirut.  Died 1920, probably more respected throughout the Near East than any ten men of any other nationality.]  \"Then I think I'll go to El-Kerak.\"  Again his eyes grew speculative.  I could not tell whether he was considering me or some problem of his own.  \"Speaking unofficially,\" he said, \"there are two possibilities. You might go without permission--easy enough, provided you don't talk beforehand.  In that case, you'd get there and back;  after which, the Administration would label and index you.  The remainder of your stay in Palestine would be about as exciting as pushing a perambulator in Prospect Park, Brooklyn.  You'd be canned.\"  \"I'd rather be killed.  What's the alternative?\"  \"Get permission.  I shall be at El-Kerak myself within the next few days.  I think it can be arranged.\"  \"D'you mean I can go with you?\" I asked, as eager as a schoolboy for the circus.  \"Not on your life!  I don't go as an American.\"  Recalling the first time I had seen him, I sat still and tried to look like a person who was not thrilled in the least by seeing secrets from the inside.  \"Well,\" I said, \"I'm in your hands.\"  I think he rather liked that.  As I came to know him more intimately later on he revealed an iron delight in being trusted. But he did not say another word for several minutes, as if there were maps in his mind that he was conning before reaching a decision.  Then he spoke suddenly.  \"Are you busy?\" he asked.  \"Then come with me.\"  He phoned to some place or other for a staff automobile, and the man was there with it within three minutes.  We piled in and drove at totally unholy speed down narrow streets between walls, around blind right-angle turns where Arab policemen stood waving unintelligible signals, and up the Mount of Olives, past the British military grave-yard, to the place they call OETA.*  The Kaiser had it built to command every view of the countryside and be seen from everywhere, as a monument to his own greatness--the biggest, lordliest, most expensive hospice that his architects could fashion, with pictures in mosaic on the walls and ceilings of the Kaiser and his ancestors in league with the Almighty.  But the British had adopted it as Administration Headquarters. [*Headquarters:  Occupied Enemy Territory Administration.]  All the way up, behind and in front and on either hand, there were views that millions* would give years of their lives to see; and they would get good value for their bargain.  Behind us, the sky-line was a panorama of the Holy City, domes, minarets and curved stone roofs rising irregularly above gray battlemented walls.  Down on the right was the ghastly valley of Jehoshaphat, treeless, dry, and crowded with white tombs--\"dry bones in the valley of death.\"  To the left were everlasting limestone hills, one of them topped by the ruined reputed tomb of Samuel--all trenched, cross-trenched and war-scarred, but covered now in a Joseph's coat of flowers, blue, blood-red, yellow and white. [* This is no exaggeration.  There are actually millions, and on more than one continent, whose dearest wish, could they have it, would be to see Jerusalem before they die.]  There were lines of camels sauntering majestically along three hill-tops, making time, and the speed of the car we rode in, seem utterly unreal.  And as we topped the hill the Dead Sea lay below us, like a polished turquoise set in the yellow gold of the barren Moab Mountains.  That view made you gasp.  Even Grim, who was used to it, could not turn his eyes away.  We whirled past saluting Sikhs at the pompous Kaiserish entrance gate, and got out on to front steps that brought to mind one of those glittering hotels at German cure-resorts--bad art, bad taste, bad amusements and a big bill.  But inside, in the echoing stone corridors that opened through Gothic windows on a courtyard, in which statues of German super- people stared with blind eyes, there was nothing now but bald military neatness and economy.  Hurrying up an uncarpeted stone stairway (Grim seemed to be a speed-demon once his mind was set) we followed a corridor around two sides of the square, past dozens of closed doors bearing department names, to the Administrator's quarters at the far end.  There, on a bare bench in a barren ante-room, Grim left me to cool my heels.  He knocked, and entered a door marked \"private.\"  It was fully half an hour before the door opened again and I was beckoned in.  Grim was alone in the room with the Administrator, a rather small, lean, rigidly set up man, with merry fire in his eye, and an instantly obvious gift for being obeyed.  He sat at an enormous desk, but would have looked more at ease in a tent, or on horseback.  The three long rows of campaign ribbons looked incongruous beside the bunch of flowers that somebody had crammed into a Damascus vase on the desk, with the estimable military notion of making the utmost use of space.  Sir Louis was certainly in an excellent temper.  He offered me a chair, and looked at me with a sort of practical good-humour that seemed to say, \"Well, here he is;  now how shall we handle him?\" I was minded to ask outright for what I wanted, but something in his attitude revealed that he knew all that already and would prefer to come at the problem in his own way.  It was clear, without a word being said, that he proposed to make some sort of use of me without being so indiscreet as to admit it.  He reminded me rather of Julius Caesar, who was also a little man, considering the probable qualifications of some minor spoke in a prodigious wheel of plans.  \"I understand you want to go to El-Kerak?\" he said, smiling as if all life were an amusing game.  I admitted the impeachment.  Grim was standing, some little way behind me and to one side;  I did not turn my head to look at him, for that might have given a false impression that he and I were in league together, but I was somehow aware that with folded arms he was studying me minutely.  \"Well,\" said Sir Louis, \"there's no objection;  only a stipulation:  We wouldn't let an Englishman go, because of the risk--not to him, but to us.  Any fool has a right to get killed, but not to obligate his government.  All the missionaries were called in from those outlying districts long ago.  We don't want to be held liable for damages for failure to protect.  Such things have happened.  You see, the idea is, we assume no responsibility for what takes place beyond the Jordan and the Dead Sea.  Now, if you'd like to sign a letter waiving any claim against us for protection, that would remove any obstacle to your going.  But, if you think that unreasonable, the alternative is safe.  You can, stay in Jerusalem.  Quite simple.\"  That had the merit of frankness.  It sounded fair enough. Nevertheless, he was certainly not being perfectly frank.  The merriment in his eyes meant something more than mere amusement. It occurred to me that his frankness took the extreme form of not concealing that he had something important in reserve.  I rather liked him for it.  His attitude seemed to be that if I wanted to take a chance, I might on my own responsibility, but that if my doing so should happen to suit his plans, that was his affair. Grim was still watching me the way a cat watches a mouse.  \"I'll sign such a letter,\" said I.  \"Good.  Here are pen and paper.  Let's have it all in your handwriting.  I'll call a clerk to witness the signature.\"  I wrote down the simple statement that I wished to go to El-Kerak for personal reasons, and that I waived all claim against the British Administration for personal protection, whether there or en route.  A clerk, who looked as if he could not have been hired to know, or understand, or remember anything without permission, came in answer to the bell.  I signed.  He witnessed.  Sir Louis put the letter in a drawer, and the clerk went out again.  \"How soon will you go?\"  I told about the promised escort, and that a day or two would be needed to get word to ben Nasir.  I forgot that ben Nasir would not start before moonrise.  It appeared that"]]]
