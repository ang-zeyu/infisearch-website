INTRODUCTION   The reputation of WILLIAM GODWIN as a social philosopher, and the merits of his famous novel, \"Caleb Williams,\" have been for more than a century the subject of extreme divergencies of judgment among critics. \"The first systematic anarchist,\" as he is called by Professor Saintsbury, aroused bitter contention with his writings during his own lifetime, and his opponents have remained so prejudiced that even the staid bibliographer Allibone, in his \"Dictionary of English Literature,\" a place where one would think the most flagitious author safe from animosity, speaks of Godwin's private life in terms that are little less than scurrilous. Over against this persistent acrimony may be put the fine eulogy of Mr. C. Kegan Paul, his biographer, to represent the favourable judgment of our own time, whilst I will venture to quote one remarkable passage that voices the opinions of many among Godwin's most eminent contemporaries.  In \"The Letters of Charles Lamb,\" Sir T.N. Talfourd says:      \"Indifferent altogether to the politics of the age, Lamb could     not help being struck with productions of its newborn energies     so remarkable as the works and the character of Godwin. He     seemed to realise in himself what Wordsworth long afterwards     described, 'the central calm at the heart of all agitation.'     Through the medium of his mind the stormy convulsions of society     were seen 'silent as in a picture.' Paradoxes the most daring     wore the air of deliberate wisdom as he pronounced them. He     foretold the future happiness of mankind, not with the     inspiration of the poet, but with the grave and passionless     voice of the oracle. There was nothing better calculated at once     to feed and to make steady the enthusiasm of youthful patriots     than the high speculations in which he taught them to engage, on     the nature of social evils and the great destiny of his species.     No one would have suspected the author of those wild theories     which startled the wise and shocked the prudent in the calm,     gentlemanly person who rarely said anything above the most     gentle commonplace, and took interest in little beyond the     whist-table.\"  WILLIAM GODWIN (1756-1836) was son and grandson of Dissenting ministers, and was destined for the same profession. In theology he began as a Calvinist, and for a while was tinctured with the austere doctrines of the Sandemanians. But his religious views soon took an unorthodox turn, and in 1782, falling out with his congregation at Stowmarket, he came up to London to earn his bread henceforward as a man of letters. In 1793 Godwin became one of the most famous men in England by the publication of his \"Political Justice,\" a work that his biographer would place side by side with the \"Speech for Unlicensed Printing,\" the \"Essay on Education,\" and \"Emile,\" as one of \"the unseen levers which have moved the changes of the times.\" Although the book came out at what we should call a \"prohibitive price,\" it had an enormous circulation, and brought its author in something like 1,000 guineas. In his first novel, \"Caleb Williams,\" which was published the next year, he illustrated in scenes from real life many of the principles enunciated in his philosophical work. \"Caleb Williams\" went through a number of editions, and was dramatized by Colman the younger under the title of \"The Iron Chest.\" It has now been out of print for many years. Godwin wrote several other novels, but one alone is readable now, \"St. Leon,\" which is philosophical in idea and purpose, and contains some passages of singular eloquence and beauty.  Godwin married the authoress of the \"Rights of Woman,\" Mary Wollstonecraft, in 1797, losing her the same year. Their daughter was the gifted wife of the poet Shelley. He was a social man, particularly fond of whist, and was on terms of intimacy and affection with many celebrated men and women. Tom Paine, Josiah Wedgwood, and Curran were among his closest male friends, while the story of his friendships with Mrs. Inchbald, Amelia Opie, with the lady immortalized by Shelley as Maria Gisborne, and with those literary sisters, Sophia and Harriet Lee, authors of the \"Canterbury Tales,\" has a certain sentimental interest. Afterwards he became known to Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Lamb. He married Mrs. Clairmont in 1801. His later years were clouded by great embarrassments, and not till 1833 was he put out of reach of the worst privations by the gift of a small sinecure, that of yeoman usher of the Exchequer. He died in 1836.  Among the contradictory judgments passed on \"Caleb Williams\" by Godwin's contemporaries those of Hazlitt, Sir James Mackintosh, and Sir T. N. Talfourd were perhaps the most eulogistic, whilst De Quincey and Allan Cunningham criticized the book with considerable severity. Hazlitt's opinion is quoted from the \"Spirit of the Age\":      \"A masterpiece, both as to invention and execution. The romantic     and chivalrous principle of the love of personal fame is     embodied in the finest possible manner in the character of     Falkland; as in Caleb Williams (who is not the first, but the     second character in the piece), we see the very demon of     curiosity personified. Perhaps the art with which these two     characters are contrived to relieve and set off each other has     never been surpassed by any work of fiction, with the exception     of the immortal satire of Cervantes.\"  Sir Leslie Stephen said of it the other day:      \"It has lived--though in comparative obscurity--for over a     century, and high authorities tell us that vitality prolonged     for that period raises a presumption that a book deserves the     title of classic.\"--_National Review, February_, 1902.  To understand how the work came to be written, and its aim, it is advisable to read carefully all three of Godwin's prefaces, more particularly the last and the most candid, written in 1832. This will, I think, dispose of the objection that the story was expressly constructed to illustrate a moral, a moral that, as Sir Leslie Stephen says, \"eludes him.\" He says:      \"I formed a conception of a book of fictitious adventure that     should in some way be distinguished by a very powerful interest.     Pursuing this idea, I invented first the third volume of my     tale, then the second, and, last of all, the first. I bent     myself to the conception of a series of adventures of flight and     pursuit; the fugitive in perpetual apprehension of being     overwhelmed with the worst calamities, and the pursuer, by his     ingenuity and resources, keeping his victim in a state of the     most fearful alarm. This was the project of my third volume.\"  He goes on to describe in more detail the \"dramatic and impressive\" situations and the \"fearful events\" that were to be evolved, making it pretty clear that the purpose somewhat vaguely and cautiously outlined in the earliest preface was rather of the nature of an afterthought. Falkland is not intended to be a personification of the evils caused by the social system, nor is he put forward as the inevitable product of that system. The reader's attention is chiefly absorbed by the extraordinary contest between Caleb Williams and Falkland, and in the tragic situations that it involves. Compared with these the denunciation of the social system is a matter of secondary interest; but it was natural that the author of the \"Political Justice,\" with his mind preoccupied by the defects of the English social system, should make those defects the, evil agencies of his plot. As the essential conditions of the series of events, as the machinery by which everything is brought about, these defects are of the utmost importance to the story. It is the accused system that awards to Tyrrel and Falkland their immense preponderance in society, and enables them to use the power of the law for the most nefarious ends. Tyrrel does his cousin to death and ruins his tenant, a man of integrity, by means of the law. This is the occasion of Falkland's original crime. His more heinous offence, the abandonment of the innocent Hawkinses to the gallows, is the consequence of what Godwin expressly denounces, punishment for murder. \"I conceived it to be in the highest degree absurd and iniquitous, to cut off a man qualified for the most essential and extensive utility, merely out of retrospect to an act which, whatever were its merits, could not be retrieved.\" Then a new element is imported into the train of causation, Caleb's insatiable curiosity, and the strife begins between these well-matched antagonists, the man of wealth and station"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11323"],["title","Caleb Williams; Or, Things as They Are (#1)"],["body","all the advantages granted him by the state of society to crush his enemy. Godwin, then, was justified in declaring that his book comprehended \"a general view of the modes of domestic and unrecorded despotism by which man becomes the destroyer of man.\" Such were the words of the original preface, which was suppressed for a short time owing to the fears caused by the trial of Horne Tooke, Thomas Holcroft and other revolutionists, with whom Godwin was in profound sympathy. Had he intended \"Caleb Williams,\" however, from its first inception, to be an imaginative version of the \"Political Justice,\" he would have had to invent a different plan and different characters. The arguments of a sociological novel lack cogency unless the characters are fairly representative of average mankind. Godwin's principal actors are both, to say the least, exceptional. They are lofty idealizations of certain virtues and powers of mind. Falkland is like Jean Valjean, a superhuman creature; and, indeed, \"Caleb Williams\" may well be compared on one side with \"Les Misérables,\" for Victor Hugo's avowed purpose, likewise, was the denunciation of social tyranny. But the characteristics that would have weakened the implied theorem, had such been the main object, are the very things that make the novel more powerful as drama of a grandiose, spiritual kind. The high and concentrated imagination that created such a being as Falkland, and the intensity of passion with which Caleb's fatal energy of mind is sustained through that long, despairing struggle, are of greater artistic value than the mechanical symmetry by which morals are illustrated.  E. A. B.     PREFACE  BY THE AUTHOR.   The following narrative is intended to answer a purpose more general and important than immediately appears upon the face of it. The question now afloat in the world respecting THINGS AS THEY ARE is the most interesting that can be presented to the human mind. While one party pleads for reformation and change, the other extols in the warmest terms the existing constitution of society. It seemed as if something would be gained for the decision of this question if that constitution were faithfully developed in its practical effects. What is now presented to the public is no refined and abstract speculation; it is a study and delineation of things passing in the moral world. It is but of late that the inestimable importance of political principles has been adequately apprehended. It is now known to philosophers that the spirit and character of the Government intrudes itself into every rank of society. But this is a truth highly worthy to be communicated to persons whom books of philosophy and science are never likely to reach. Accordingly, it was proposed, in the invention of the following work, to comprehend, as far as the progressive nature of a single story would allow, a general review of the modes of domestic and unrecorded despotism by which man becomes the destroyer of man. If the author shall have taught a valuable lesson, without subtracting from the interest and passion by which a performance of this sort ought to be characterised, he will have reason to congratulate himself upon the vehicle he has chosen.  _May_ 12, 1794.  This preface was withdrawn in the original edition, in compliance with the alarms of booksellers. \"Caleb Williams\" made his first appearance in the world in the same month in which the sanguinary plot broke out against the liberties of Englishmen, which was happily terminated by the acquittal of its first intended victims in the close of that year. Terror was the order of the day; and it was feared that even the humble novelist might be shown to be constructively a traitor.  _October_ 29, 1795.     AUTHOR'S LATEST PREFACE.   LONDON,  _November_ 20, 1832.  \"CALEB WILLIAMS\" has always been regarded by the public with an unusual degree of favour. The proprietor of \"THE STANDARD NOVELS\" has therefore imagined that even an account of the concoction and mode of writing of the work would be viewed with some interest.  I finished the \"Enquiry concerning Political Justice,\" the first work which may be considered as written by me in a certain degree in the maturity of my intellectual powers, and bearing my name, early in January, 1793; and about the middle of the following month the book was published. It was my fortune at that time to be obliged to consider my pen as the sole instrument for supplying my current expenses. By the liberality of my bookseller, Mr. George Robinson, of Paternoster Row, I was enabled then, and for nearly ten years before, to meet these expenses, while writing different things of obscure note, the names of which, though innocent and in some degree useful, I am rather inclined to suppress. In May, 1791, I projected this, my favourite work, and from that time gave up every other occupation that might interfere with it. My agreement with Robinson was that he was to supply my wants at a specified rate while the book was in the train of composition. Finally, I was very little beforehand with the world on the day of its publication, and was therefore obliged to look round and consider to what species of industry I should next devote myself.  I had always felt in myself some vocation towards the composition of a narrative of fictitious adventure; and among the things of obscure note which I have above referred to were two or three pieces of this nature. It is not therefore extraordinary that some project of the sort should have suggested itself on the present occasion.  But I stood now in a very different situation from that in which I had been placed at a former period. In past years, and even almost from boyhood, I was perpetually prone to exclaim with Cowley:    \"What shall I do to be for ever known,   And make the age to come my own?\"  But I had endeavoured for ten years, and was as far from approaching my object as ever. Everything I wrote fell dead-born from the press. Very often I was disposed to quit the enterprise in despair. But still I felt ever and anon impelled to repeat my effort.  At length I conceived the plan of Political Justice. I was convinced that my object of building to myself a name would never be attained by merely repeating and refining a little upon what other men had said, even though I should imagine that I delivered things of this sort with a more than usual point and elegance. The world, I believed, would accept nothing from me with distinguishing favour that did not bear upon the face of it the undoubted stamp of originality. Having long ruminated upon the principles of Political Justice, I persuaded myself that I could offer to the public, in a treatise on this subject, things at once new, true, and important. In the progress of the work I became more sanguine and confident. I talked over my ideas with a few familiar friends during its progress, and they gave me every generous encouragement. It happened that the fame of my book, in some inconsiderable degree, got before its publication, and a certain number of persons were prepared to receive it with favour. It would be false modesty in me to say that its acceptance, when published, did not nearly come up to everything that could soberly have been expected by me. In consequence of this, the tone of my mind, both during the period in which I was engaged in the work and afterwards, acquired a certain elevation, and made me now unwilling to stoop to what was insignificant.  I formed a conception of a book of fictitious adventure that should in some way be distinguished by a very powerful interest. Pursuing this idea, I invented first the third volume of my tale, then the second, and last of all the first. I bent myself to the conception of a series of adventures of flight and pursuit; the fugitive in perpetual apprehension of being overwhelmed with the worst calamities, and the pursuer, by his ingenuity and resources, keeping his victim in a state of the most fearful alarm. This was the project of my third volume. I was next called upon to conceive a dramatic and impressive situation adequate to account for the impulse that the pursuer should feel, incessantly to alarm and harass his victim, with an inextinguishable resolution never to allow him the least interval of peace and security. This I apprehended could best be effected by a secret murder, to the investigation of which the innocent victim should be impelled by an unconquerable spirit of curiosity. The murderer would thus have a sufficient motive to persecute the unhappy discoverer, that he might deprive him of peace, character, and credit, and have him for ever in his power. This constituted the outline of my second volume.  The subject of the first volume was still to be invented. To account for the fearful events of the third, it was necessary that the pursuer should be invested with every advantage of fortune, with a resolution that nothing could defeat or baffle, and with extraordinary resources of intellect. Nor could my purpose of giving an overpowering interest to my tale be answered without his appearing to have been originally endowed with a mighty store of amiable dispositions and virtues, so that his being driven to the first act of murder should be judged worthy of the deepest regret, and should be seen in some measure to have arisen out of his virtues themselves. It was necessary to make him, so to speak, the tenant of an atmosphere of romance, so that every reader should feel prompted almost to worship him for his high qualities. Here were ample materials for a first volume.  I felt that I had a great advantage in thus carrying back my invention from the ultimate conclusion to the first commencement of the train of adventures upon which I purposed to employ my pen. An entire unity of plot would be the infallible result; and the unity of spirit and interest in a tale truly considered gives it a powerful hold on the reader, which can scarcely be generated with equal success "]]]
