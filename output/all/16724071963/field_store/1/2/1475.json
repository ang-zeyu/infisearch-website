But he tried to rouse himself from this despondency, and laughed at himself for this credulous fear.  \"This Pfannenstiel is a fool, and I would he a greater one if I believed his nonsense,\" said he. \"No, no, my information is warranted and authentic. The king has had a sharp skirmish with the Russians near Reitwan, and driven them back, and then proceeded quietly to Meissen. Thus there is no ground for anxiety, and I can safely let off my bomb-shells against the Russians.\"  Mr. Kretschmer felt his courage return and his heart grow warm.  \"Now I see the whole game,\" cried he, laughing. \"Pfannenstiel wishes the _Vossian Gazette_ to take notice of him. He wants to be talked about, and wishes the newspapers to spread his reputation. For that reason he stationed himself right under my window, for that reason he cast such significant looks at me, for that reason he addressed the crowd and poured forth his nonsense right here. Yes, that's it! He wishes to prove to me how great his power is over this people which believes in him, even when he utters the most incredible and unheard-of things. Well, we can help the man,\" continued he, laughing, as he stepped to his desk. \"The desired article for the 'Miscellaneous' is found, and I think that the prophetic linen-weaver, Pfannenstiel, is well worth more than the four children at a birth and the miserable stork's nest of yesterday's _Spener's Journal_. Let's write it off quickly.\"  Kretschmer began to write most industriously, when he was suddenly interrupted by a violent knocking at the door. It opened, and a stately old gentleman entered, with well-powdered wig and long queue.  \"Mr. Krause, my worthy colleague!\" exclaimed Kretschmer, jumping up and hastening toward the old man. But Mr. Krause had no word of greeting. He sank sighing into a chair.  \"Do you know the news?\" asked he, in a whining tone, folding his trembling hands, and looking at Kretschmer timidly, as he stood before him.  \"Know what?\" demanded the latter in reply, feeling his heart sink.  \"The Russians are coming!\" sighed Mr. Krause.  \"That is a silly tale,\" cried Kretschmer peevishly, with an impatient gesture.  \"Would to God it were!\" groaned Krause; \"but the news is, alas, but too true, and it can no longer be doubted!\"  \"Man of misfortune,\" cried Mr. Kretschmer, \"who told you so?\"  \"Pfannenstiel.\"  \"Pfannenstiel?\" repeated Kretschmer, laughing heartily; \"oh, yes! Pfannenstiel prophesied it just now in the streets, under my window. Now don't distress yourself, dearest friend and colleague. That was only a clumsy trick of the scoundrel to get me to write an article about him in the _Vossian Gazette_. I have already gratified his wish.\"  \"You are mistaken,\" said Krause, mournfully. \"I sent Pfannenstiel into the streets, to quiet the people, and to admonish them to behave peaceably and soberly, even if the Russians should come.\"  \"Oh! you believe in all these dreams of Pfannenstiel?\"  \"I believe in the truth, and in what I know!\" exclaimed Krause emphatically. \"Pfannenstiel has for a long time been my agent, and for a considerable stipend, paid every month, informs me of all that happens, is talked and thought of in the town. He is a very useful man, peculiarly suited to this service.\"  \"The approach of the Russians is then town-talk, and nothing more?\" asked Kretschmer, who was still anxious to throw doubt on the bad news.  \"No, it is a fact,\" said Krause seriously. \"Pfannenstiel is, as you know, not only a prophet, but also a quack doctor, and his herbs and decoctions are certainly often of astonishing efficacy. He always gathers the plants for his mixtures himself, and roams about in search of them in the neighborhood of Berlin for days together. Last evening he was outside the town, on one of these tramps, intending to pass the night sleeping under a tree. He was awoke by the sound of troops marching, and as he looked carefully around, he could plainly distinguish in the bright moonlight the uniforms of the Russian army. It was a long column of many thousand men. They halted not far from the place where Pfannenstiel lay, and he crept carefully nearer. He then ascertained from their conversation that this was only a small division of the army, which had advanced by forced marches from Frankfort, and was commanded by General Tottleben.\"  \"By Tottleben!\" cried Kretschmer in dismay.  \"Yes, by Tottleben,\" whimpered Krause, and they both looked in silence on the ground. \"Yes, his vengeance will be terrible,\" said Krause, after a long and anxious pause. \"Have you not heard,\" continued he in whisper--\"have you not heard the sad story of what occurred last year in Erlangen? The editor of the _Erlangen Gazette_ admitted into his columns an article abusive of our great king. A Prussian officer came in person to Erlangen to call the editor to account. And what do you think he did? He caused the unfortunate and pitiable journalist to be beaten with cudgels, and then gave him a receipt for the bastinado he had gotten.\"  \"Horrible!\" cried Mr. Kretschmer, wringing his hands.  Mr. Krause continued: \"When a refined Prussian, officer can behave in this way, what have we to expect from these rough, uncivilized enemies, the Russians? Oh! they will murder us, for we, too, have ventured to write boldly and energetically against them.\"  \"Yes, you particularly,\" said Mr. Kretschmer quickly. \"Do you recollect the famous article in your paper, in which you called General Tottleben a notorious adventurer, who had deserted to the enemy after having enjoyed the unmerited favor of our king? This was, certainly, rather strong; it might even be called indiscreet.\"  \"Not as indiscreet as your 'Earnest and Confidential Country Talk,'\" cried Krause sharply.  \"I never avowed myself the author of that pamphlet,\" said Kretschmer quickly.  \"But every one knows that you are, and you never denied it,\" replied Krause maliciously. \"This 'Country Talk' is more than indiscreet, it is foolhardy. In it you nicknamed Maria Theresa, Aunt Tilla; the Elector of Saxony, Brother Osten; the Empress of Russia, Cousin Lizzy; and our king, Neighbor Flink. And don't you remember what words you put into Cousin Lizzie's mouth, and how you made neighbor Flink ridicule her? Ah, I am afraid you will pay dearly for this\" piece of boldness.\"  \"It is not quite so bad as your calling Tottleben a notorious adventurer; for the princes are not here, but Tottleben is before the gates of Berlin, and will revenge himself.\"  \"I am afraid our prospects are equally bad, and for that reason I have come to you, that we might consult together as to what we had best do, to avert this threatening blow from our heads.\"  \"You are right,\" said Kretschmer, drawing nearer to his brother editor. \"Let us consider. Above all things, no exciting calls, no appeals to the people to perform deeds of heroic valor. Berlin is too weak for defence; why, then, should we irritate the enemy by useless opposition?\"  \"You, too, are right,\" said Krause thoughtfully; \"let us rather advise the citizens of Berlin to be quiet; let us wheel boldly round, and speak in our journals with respect and deference of our worthy enemy.\"  \"Besides which, it would be well to consult with some of the principal men who have an influence on the people. For example, let us go to Gotzkowsky,\" said Kretschmer.  \"Gotzkowsky gives a great holiday to his workmen to-day.\"  \"So much the better, for then he can immediately use his influence on his workmen. Come, let us go at once to Gotzkowsky, this Croesus of Berlin, who bought for our king three hundred thousand dollars' worth of pictures in Italy, without having been paid for them up to this day, and yet is able to take a contract for commissary stores to the amount of eight millions. Let us go to him; and, hark ye! it would be as well to take Pfannenstiel with us to back us.\"  \"Yes,\" said Krause, raising himself quickly by the arm of his younger friend, \"let us go to Gotzkowsky with Pfannenstiel, and preach mildness and submission to him and his workmen.\"  They both prepared to go. Suddenly Kretschmer stopped as if struck by lightning, and sank down on a chair stunned. \"My article, my article!\" moaned he. \"I am a lost man!\"  \"What article do you mean, my dearest friend?\"  \"The leading article in tomorrow's paper,\" whimpered Kretschmer. \"Oh, it was a beautiful article, full of inspiration, but it is not suitable to the times or the circumstances. I wrote it under the erroneous impression that our armies had gained a victory, and in it I spoke with great contempt of the incendiary enemy.\"  \"My God, what rashness!\" exclaimed Krause, clasping his hands in despair.  Kretschmer flew from his stool, and grasped his hat. \"My article! I must have my article back. The printer must give it up to me. Wait for me in the street. I come either with my article or not at all.\"  Bidding Krause a hasty farewell, he hurried out.         *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER VII.  THE INTERRUPTED FESTIVAL.   Gotzkowsky had as yet received no intelligence of the danger which threatened the town, and was enjoying the festival in his garden in the midst of his people.  They were all collected on a grass-plat for target-shooting. In the midst of the plat rose a pole with a target. The women and girls were standing around, attentively and curiously watching the men, who, collected under a tent, were shooting with crossbows at the target. Every lucky shot was greeted with a cheer, every unlucky one with derisive laughter; and the prizes which were assigned to the fortunate marksmen only served to increase the joy and merriment of the happy crowd.  Suddenly loud cries of weeping and lamentation were heard from a distance. The people looked at each other with anxiety and alarm. The dismal noise came nearer and still nearer, and then appeared at the entrance gate near"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12016"],["title","The Merchant of Berlin: An Historical Novel (#8)"],["body","the strange and wild figure of the linen-weaver, accompanied by the two editors, Krause and Kretschmer.  \"Pfannenstiel! it is Pfannenstiel, our prophet!\" shouted the crowd, while they hastened with joyous laughter and words of greeting toward their beloved seer.  The linen-weaver strode forward with a serious and majestic air, answering the greetings of the workmen with patronizing nods, and from time to time stretching out his hand as if to bless them. The multitude crowded around him, and seemed to look upon the advent of the prophet as part of the programme of the entertainment. But Gotzkowsky hastened toward the two editors with a cheerful smile, bidding them a courteous welcome. They responded to his friendly greeting with a solemn earnestness, and requested a conference with a mysterious and important air. Gotzkowsky looked at them with astonishment; but as he read in their countenances an expression of deep and anxious concern, he motioned to them and preceded them to a summer-house on the other side of the lawn.  \"Here we can talk without being observed,\" said he, casting a look across at his workmen. \"You see my guests are still busy with the scarecrow which you brought here; and what business has this man, indeed, among merry people?\"  \"He maintains that God ordered him to come to you, to warn you in His name, and call upon you to protect Berlin,\" said Krause.  \"Yes,\" continued Kretschmer, \"and he entreated us to accompany him, trusting to our influence with our dear friend.\"  Gotzkowsky looked at both of the men with astonishment. \"Tell me, my worthy friends, which of us is crazy?\" asked he, smiling, partly in derision, partly in pity. \"I am called on to protect Berlin, and from what?\"  \"Because the Russians are coming,\" said Mr. Krause, solemnly.  Gotzkowsky shrugged his shoulders. \"That is an idle rumor,\" said he; \"two days ago they were still in Frankfort. You see, therefore, that some wag has amused himself by teasing you and frightening you a little for the thunderbolts which you two, and particularly the _Vossian Gazette_, have launched against the Russians.\"  Mr. Kretschmer shuddered and turned pale. \"I beg you,\" cried he, \"do not speak of it! Good Heavens! the _Vossian Gazette_ is the organ of the popular mind, and it is its duty to take each day the exact tone of public opinion. I abused the Russians, therefore, because--\"  \"Because they were still a hundred miles from Berlin. Oh, yes! we know you, gentlemen of the press. You are full of courage as long as no enemy is in the field, but as soon as you scent him and see the points of his lances, you become quite humble and mild; and when he comes threateningly down upon you, assure him of your respect and swear to him that you love him,\" interrupted Gotzkowsky.  \"You are pleased to jest,\" said Mr. Krause, casting a rapid glance of hatred at Gotzkowsky; \"it is well, indeed, that the rich and powerful Gotzkowsky is so cheerful. I will notice it in my journal. It is news for 'Change, and the funds will rise when people hear that Gotzkowsky has laughed.\"  Gotzkowsky's countenance became sad and serious. \"You may tell the world,\" said he, \"that my lips laugh; but how my heart feels, that you gossips and newspapers know nothing about.\"  \"God be praised,\" said Kretschmer, ironically, \"you are now talking earnestly, and I can request you to listen to our serious representations. It is no idle rumor that I have told you. The Russians are already at the gates of Berlin. They have hurried thither by forced marches. This news is no longer a secret. All Berlin knows it, and it is only accidentally that you have not learned it earlier.\"  \"Oh, Heavens!\" sobbed Krause, wringing his hands, \"what a terrible fate awaits our unfortunate town!\"  Gotzkowsky looked at him with a gloomy frown. \"You are, it is true, an old man,\" said he, \"but even old men should, at such a time, possess some manhood. But you, Mr. Kretschmer, are young and hearty; what do you say to this approach of the Russians?\"  \"I say,\" replied Kretschmer, sharply, \"I say that it would be madness to excite the wrath of the enemy by resistance. I say, that those citizens who call on the people to fight are rash fools.\"  \"Oh!\" cried Gotzkowsky, joyfully, \"if there be any such _rash fools_, then all is not lost!\"  \"Can you comprehend such madness?\" whispered Krause, \"to wish to oppose an overwhelming force while all our capable men and youths are with the army in Silesia, and we have no troops but the sick and maimed; no artillery save two old rusty cannon?\"  \"A people willing to fight for liberty,\" cried Gotzkowsky, \"such a people have the strength of a giant even without cannon and bayonets. God has given them hands and paving-stones. If we cannot shoot down the enemy who threatens our liberty, we can beat him down.\"  \"What do you say?\" stammered Krause, looking with amazement at Gotzkowsky's glowing countenance.  \"I say,\" said Gotzkowsky, \"that you have mistaken your man. I will not advise the brave Berlin people to yield without having at least fought for their freedom.\"  \"But only reflect!\" exclaimed Kretschmer, while Krause paced up and down, wringing his hands and moaning in a low tone; \"have you forgotten that the Russian generals have proclaimed that the empress has commanded them to leave nothing but air and earth to the inhabitants of every conquered town and province of Prussia?\"  \"Oh, pshaw!\" cried Gotzkowsky, laughing, \"they will have to conclude to leave us something more.\"  \"And did you hear London's terrible threat? He has said his soldiers should massacre every one, and not spare even the child in its mother's womb.\"  \"And did you not hear the brave Schwerin's answer to this Austrian bravado?\" asked Gotzkowsky. \"He said, 'My soldiers are not with child, neither am I.' Well, our men of Berlin are not with child, and therefore they need not be afraid.\"  \"But you must be afraid!\" whined Krause. \"It is disgraceful madness not to be afraid. How! You can be so unreasonable as to advise war? But war is the most bitter enemy of prosperity, and threatens property above all things.\"  \"Then shame on the proprietors,\" cried Gotzkowsky, \"if their property is to make cowardly poltroons of them! Liberty is our greatest possession, and all else must yield to it.\"  At this moment loud cries and sounds of wailing were heard in the garden from the collected workmen, who surrounded the prophet in a dense group, and listened to his prophecies with anxious wonder as he uttered them from a high bench.  Gotzkowsky frowned. \"Ah, I understand!\" said he, \"this good linen-weaver is your accomplice, my brave gentlemen, and as you wish to convert me, so does he wish to convert my honest workmen into old women. Let us see first in what sort of gibberish he preaches his wisdom to these good people.\"  Without taking any further notice of the two editors, Gotzkowsky left the summer-house rapidly and approached the listening multitude.         *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER VIII.  THE LEADER OF THE PEOPLE.   The inspired prophet stood on a bench, and, as he unrolled his pictures, he endeavored to explain these mystical paintings to his devout gazers and listeners in equally mystical language. Gotzkowsky hastened toward this group, and pressed in silent observation close up to Pfannenstiel's side.  The linen-weaver, wholly possessed by his prophetic god, had in the mean while unrolled another picture, and holding it up high with solemn countenance, exclaimed with a screaming voice: \"The day of judgment is at hand, and destiny is at your door! In my dream I saw a face like unto no other face, and I heard a voice, and the voice was like unto no other voice!\"  \"And yet you heard it! What ears you must have!\" said Gotzkowsky, laughing.  The prophet answered calmly, \"Yes! for then were seen invisible things, and then were heard inaudible sounds!\" And showing a fresh picture to the crowd, he continued: \"Look at this picture, which I found this morning on my sheet. It contains the history of your future, and God announced it to me as I sat at my loom weaving. I heard a voice crying, 'Pfannenstiel, my beloved son, dost thou hear me?' And I fell on my knees and answered, 'Yes, I hear.' 'Dost thou know what thou art weaving?' asked the voice. 'Yes,' said I, 'it is linen shirting for the almshouse.' 'No,' said the voice, 'it is a cloth of weeping for the town of Berlin, for the daughters of your fathers will shed tears, and there will be moaning and weeping.'\"  These last words he accompanied with a sobbing and plaintive howl, in which his trembling hearers joined. They assured each other in uncomfortable whispers that Pfannenstiel's prophecies usually came true, and that, even before the war, he had predicted the coming of this day of terror.  But soon Pfannenstiel raised his voice, and its hoarse croaking sounded above the loud conversation and anxious cries of the multitude. \"Woe unto Berlin!\" cried he, with shrieking pathos. \"Blood will flow within her walls! The voice said unto me, 'I will look upon red, but it will not be a scarlet cloak, and when the red banner waves thrones will tremble, and there will be no end to the lamentation. And the cock will crow, and the heavens will shine blood-red, and everywhere and in all places men will cry, \"Blood! blood is the drink of new life; blood makes young what is old; blood wipes out sworn debts; blood makes the proud humble. Let us drink blood!\"'\"  Here the prophet was interrupted by the loud cries and wailing of the multitude. The women broke out in tears, sank on their knees and prayed, or clung trembling and weeping to their moody-looking husbands.  Pfannenstiel looked with an air of proud triumph on this evident effect of his speech, and then continued in a more subdued tone: \"But the voice said to me, 'Hope, and every thing will turn out well, and the blood which flows will transform itself into a purple robe, and men will call it freedom. Out of death"]]]
