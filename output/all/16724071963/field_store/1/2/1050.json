They also gathered in all the mavericks, and no one dared interfere.  It should be added that no more dangerous set of men can be found anywhere than the Wyoming rustlers. No living being excels them in horsemanship. The bucking pony is as a child in their hands. There is not one among them who cannot rope, throw, tie and brand a steer single-handed. They include the best riders and the best shots in the cattle business. They do not know what fear is, and in the year named became strong enough to elect one of their own number sheriff.     CHAPTER VII.  THE WARNING.   The full moon was shining on the second night succeeding the conflict which Budd Hankinson described between the rustlers and the cowmen of Whitney's ranch. The man that had fallen was laid away in a grave back of the house, and mother, son and daughter mourned him with a sorrow that was soothed by the consciousness that he had been a good husband and father in every sense of the word.  On this night, before the hour was late, three persons were seated in the balmy air on the outside of the dwelling, talking together in low tones.  They were Fred Whitney, whose bandaged arm rested in a sling, Monteith Sterry, and Jennie Whitney. The memory of the recent affliction suffered in the death of the father naturally subdued the voices and tinged the words with a seriousness that would not have been felt at other times.  Young Sterry, as already stated, had accepted an engagement with the Live Stock Association, which required him to investigate the operations of the rustlers over a large portion of Wyoming and Montana, and to report at regular intervals to his superior officers.  This was perilous business, but Sterry set about the work with a vigour, directness and intelligence that were felt over an extent of territory numbering hundreds of square miles, and made him a marked man by the rustlers, who are always quick to identify their friends and enemies. It seemed to make little difference, however, to him, who loved the excitement. He was a capital pistol and rifle-shot, a fine horseman, and as devoid of fear as the men against whom he directed his movements.  Unconsciously Monteith Sterry brought a grievous peril upon his friends, who held him in so high regard. Hated intensely by the rustlers, they were not long in learning that he spent a great deal of his time at the Whitneys. They came to be regarded, therefore, as aiders and abettors of his. This enmity was emphasized by the attack of which an account has been given.  \"I think, Fred,\" said his sister, oppressed by the shadow that had fallen across the threshold, \"we ought to sell out and leave this country.\"  \"Why?\" he gently asked.  \"Because not only of what happened yesterday, but of the certainty that such attacks will be repeated.\"  \"What reason have you to fear their repetition?\" asked Monteith.  \"Matters are growing worse between the cowmen and the rustlers; I have heard our men talk, and you have said so yourself.\"  \"I cannot deny it,\" replied their visitor, thoughtfully smoking his cigar. He would have been pleased had her brother, now the head of the little household, decided to make his home once more in the East, for then he would take up the study of his profession of law and be placed where he could often meet them.  \"It would be cowardly to sell out and abandon the country through fear of those men,\" said the brother, to whom the proposition was not pleasant.  \"But suppose you should be their next victim?\" suggested Jennie, with a shudder.  \"I don't think I shall be a victim,\" he quietly responded; \"this wound won't bother me long, and with Budd and Grizzly to help, we can laugh at all the rustlers in the country.\"  \"It is hardly a matter of courage,\" ventured Sterry, \"for no one knowing you or your sister would question your bravery, but it is rather the peace of mind of your mother and her. It will be a long time, if ever, before your parent recovers from the shock of yesterday. No matter how confident and plucky you may be, Fred, you know it is no guarantee against a bullet from one of those scamps at five hundred or a thousand yards. I shudder to think of what might happen.\"  Fred turned and looked full in the handsome face of the fellow beside him.  \"It strikes me that you are showing little faith in your own words. Why do you remain where you are a marked man when there is no need of it, and where your personal danger is certainly as great as mine?\"  This _argumentum ad hominem_ was so unexpected that Sterry was embarrassed for the moment, but found voice to reply:  \"I have no mother and sister dependent on me, as you have.\"  \"But you have brothers, sisters, father and mother, and therefore the more to mourn if you should fall. The fact is, Mont, I feel that it is a duty you owe to them to give up the dangerous calling you have adopted. You not only do not need it, but are squandering time that ought to be given to the study of your profession, and you have become so feared and hated by the rustlers that they will go to any length to 'remove' you.\"  \"The more cause, therefore, why I should stay,\" responded the other.  \"A poor argument--\"  The discussion was interrupted by the sound of a horse's hoofs. Some one was riding toward them on a gallop, and speedily loomed to view in the bright moonlight. The three instinctively ceased speaking and gazed curiously at the horseman, who reined up in front of where they were sitting.  Hospitality is limitless in the West, and, before the stranger had halted, Fred Whitney rose from his chair and walked forward to welcome him.  The man was in the costume of a cowboy, with rifle, revolver and all the paraphernalia of the craft.  \"Is your name Whitney?\" asked the horseman, speaking first.  \"It is; what can I do for you?\"  \"Do you know Mont Sterry?\"  \"He is a particular friend of mine,\" replied Whitney, refraining from adding that he was the young man sitting a few paces away with his sister and hearing every word said.  \"Well, there's a letter for him; if I knew where to find him I would deliver it myself. Will you hand it to him the next time you meet him?\"  As he spoke he leaned forward from his saddle and handed a sealed envelope to Fred Whitney, who remarked, as he accepted it:  \"I will do as you wish; I expect to see him soon; won't you dismount and stay over night with us?\"  \"No; I have business elsewhere,\" was the curt answer, as the fellow wheeled and spurred off on a gallop.  Budd Hankinson and Grizzly Weber, the two hired men, were absent, looking after the cattle, for the rustler is a night hawk who often gets in the best part of his work between the set and rise of sun.  Mrs. Whitney was sitting in the gloom, alone in her sorrow. Jennie wished to stay with her, but the mother gently refused, saying she preferred to have none with her. No light was burning in the building, and that night the weather was unusually mild.  Mont Sterry accepted the paper from the hand of his friend and remarked, with a smile:  \"I suspect what it is. When the rustlers don't like a man they have a frank way of telling him so, supplemented by a little good advice, I fancy I have been honoured in a similar way.\"  He deliberately tore open the envelope, while Jennie and her brother looked curiously at him. The moonlight, although strong, was not sufficiently so to show the words, which were written in lead-pencil. Fred Whitney, therefore, struck a match and held it in front of the paper, while the recipient read in a low voice, loud enough, however, to be heard in the impressive hush:      \"MONT STERRY: If you stay in the Powder River country twenty-four     hours longer you are a dead man. Over fifty of us rustlers have     sworn to shoot you on sight, whether it is at Fort McKinley,     Buffalo, or on the streets of Cheyenne. I have persuaded the     majority to hold off for the time named, but not one of them will     do so an hour longer, nor will I ask them to do so. We are bound     to make an honest living, and it is weak for me to give you this     warning, but I do it, repeating that if you are within reach     twenty-four hours from the night on which this is handed to     Whitney I will join them in hunting you down, wherever you may be.      \"LARCH CADMUS.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  GOOD-BYE.   Monteith Sterry read the \"warning\" through in a voice without the slightest tremor. Then he quietly smoked his cigar and looked off in the moonlight, as though thinking of something of a different nature.  It was natural that Jennie Whitney should be more impressed by the occurrence, with the memory of the recent tragedy crushing her to the earth. She exclaimed:  \"Larch Cadmus! Why, Fred, he has visited our house several times; he was here last week.\"  \"Yes,\" replied her brother; \"he has often sat at our table; and, by the way, he is a great admirer of yours.\"  \"Nonsense!\" was the response; \"why do you say that?\"  \"It may be nonsense, but it is true, nevertheless. Your mother noticed it; and, that there might be no mistake, Larch had the impudence to tell me so himself.\"  \"I never liked him; he is a bad man,\" said Jennie, much to the relief of Sterry, who felt a little uncomfortable. \"I did not know he belonged to the rustlers.\"  \"He was a cowboy until last fall. He had a quarrel with Col. Ringgold and went off with the others, and has been on the blacklist ever since.\"  \"Why didn't he bring the message himself,\" continued the sister, \"instead of sending it?\"  \"He did,\" was the significant reply of the brother.  \"What! That surely was not he?\"  \"It was. I knew his voice the moment he spoke; those whiskers were false; he didn't want to be recognized, and I thought it as well to humor his fancy, but I could not be mistaken.\"  \"Now that I recall it, his voice _did_ resemble Cadmus',\" said the sister, more thoughtfully.  \"Of course, and I can tell you something more; he was among the rustlers with whom we had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11337"],["title","Cowmen and Rustlers: A Story of the Wyoming Cattle Ranges (#8)"],["body","fight yesterday. He did his best to kill me, and came pretty near succeeding. It wasn't he, however, who put the bullet through my arm, for I dropped that fellow.\"  \"You frighten me!\" was all that Jennie Whitney could say.  Sterry still smoked in silence. He was thinking hard, but it was his turn to be startled by the next remark.  \"Larch Cadmus hates you, Mont, not so much because you are the enemy of all rustlers, but more because he believes my sister holds you in higher esteem than she does him.\"  Sterry was clever enough to parry this compliment with considerable skill.  \"For the same reason he is jealous of every gentleman whom Miss Whitney has ever met, for it would be a sorry tribute to any man's worth if he did not stand higher in her regard than Larch Cadmus.\"  \"Well spoken!\" said the young lady, relieved from what threatened to become an embarrassing situation for her.  Had her brother chosen he might have expressed what was in his mind, but he had the good taste to refrain. None knew better than he the deep, tender affection existing between his friend and his sister, though it had not yet reached the point of avowal and confession.  \"Well, Mont, what are you going to do about it?\" asked Whitney.  By way of reply, the latter twisted the \"warning\" into the form of a lamplighter. Then he applied a match to one corner, and held the paper until it had burned to the last fragment.  \"That's my opinion of Mr. Larch Cadmus and his gang, and I shall pay the same attention to them.\"  \"You are not wise,\" ventured Jennie, who, with the awful memory of the preceding day upon her, could not but shudder at the peril to her friend, who had never been quite so near to her as during the last few hours, when he showed so much tender sympathy for her and her mother and brother in the depth of their desolation and woe.  \"I thank you,\" he said, with the same manly frankness he had always shown; \"I have no desire to appear as a boaster or to make light of danger, but one of the truest adages is that it is not the barking dog that does the biting.\"  \"Don't make the mistake of supposing it is not so in this case,\" said Whitney, \"and none should know it better than you.\"  \"I do not underestimate the courage of those fellows; they will shrink at nothing, but there is no more excuse for my running away upon receiving such a warning than there would be for all the inhabitants of Wyoming to leave the State at such a command.\"  \"The case is not parallel,\" was the comment of Fred Whitney.  \"Bear in mind that if I stay, as I intend to do, I do not mean to sit down and wait for those rustlers to pick me off. I count on having something to say and do in the matter; but, friends, I must bid you good-night.\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked the astonished Fred Whitney.  \"I must leave,\" replied Sterry, rising to his feet; \"I have already staid too long.\"     CHAPTER IX.  A SUMMONS AND A REPLY.   Brother and sister were astounded. The hour was late, and they had been urging their guest to remain several days with them. He had not consented, nor had he refused, from which they were confident he would stay.  And now he announced his intention of departing at once, riding out into the night--whither?  They protested, but he replied so earnestly that an urgent necessity existed that they refrained. He gave no hint of the reason for his strange action, and they could not ask it. His fleet mare, which had been allowed to graze on the succulent grass at the rear of the building with the other horses, was brought forward and saddled and bridled, and he quickly vaulted upon her back.  \"Remember me to your mother; it is not worth while to disturb her; I hope soon to be with you again.\"  He leaned over and pressed the hand of Fred Whitney, and then, raising his hat with his left hand, extended the right to Jennie.  Fred made an excuse to move away a few paces, for he understood the situation.  \"Good-by,\" Sterry said in a voice just low enough to reach the dear one, as he pressed the delicate hand which rested so trustingly in his own.  \"Good-by,\" she answered. \"I am sorry you are going.\"  \"So am I, but it is better that I should leave. As I said, I trust soon to see you again. Do you know why I hope Fred will decide to return to the East with you and your mother?\"  \"I suppose because we shall all be safer there;\" and then she added, forgetting her sorrow for the moment, \"that is if we do not go skating to Wolf Glen.\"  \"It is not necessary to remove as far as Maine, but father insists that I am wasting time here, when I ought to be home studying my profession.\"  \"And he is right, Monteith.\"  \"But,\" he replied in a low voice, \"before I go back I want to make sure that you will do the same. There, good-by again.\"  He replaced his hat, wheeled and dashed across the prairie without another word.  Jennie stood gazing in the direction taken by him for some time after he had disappeared in the gloom of the night. Then she turned to speak to her brother, but he had passed within the house. She resumed her seat, knowing he would soon return.  Fifteen minutes and more went by and she was still alone.  Sh! Was she mistaken, or was that the faint sound of a horse's hoofs in the distance?  She turned her head and listened. The murmur of voices, as her brother and mother talked in low tones, did not disturb her, and the almost inaudible lowing of the cattle on the distant ranges was but a part of silence itself.  Hardly a breath of air was stirring, but all knew the eccentric way in which sound is sometimes carried by it. Suddenly the reports of rifle-firing were heard, faint but distinct, and lasting several minutes. Then other and different noises reached her, still faint but clear.  Her power of hearing, like her vision, was exceptionally strong. It was that which enabled her to tell that the last sounds were not made by a single animal, but by several going at a high rate of speed. These, with the reports of rifles, made her certain that the rustlers had attacked Sterry.  Meanwhile the young man found matters exceedingly lively.  The reception of the \"warning\" through the hands of Fred Whitney was proof that his enemies knew he was frequently at his house. Their messenger had gone thither to deliver it. Young Whitney had slain one of their number, and though the law-breakers themselves had suffered the most, they felt bitter resentment toward the family.  If Sterry remained with them they would have trouble. He was satisfied that Larch Cadmus recognized him, as he sat in front of the rancher's house, and would not forget to tell it to his comrades, who would speedily make the place a visit. He believed they were likely to do it before the rise of the morrow's sun.  If the Whitneys were attacked, his presence would add to the defensive strength, but such an attack would not be made if he was not there. Desperate and defiant as the rustlers had been, it would be an injustice to represent them as capable of such wantonness.  He felt, therefore, that it was his duty to leave the ranch without delay, thus removing an element of grave danger. It would have been hardly wise to make this explanation to them, though he believed Fred suspected it.  Turning his back, therefore, upon the dearest spot in all the West to him, he set his mare Queenie on an easy, swift gallop, heading southward toward the ranges where the cattle of the Whitneys were grazing.  Sterry, in one sense, was without a home as long as he remained in Wyoming or Montana, while in another sense he was the owner of numberless dwelling-places or \"headquarters.\" He may be likened to a commercial traveller in a vast and sparsely-settled region, where he is well known and welcomed by the inhabitants.  The ranchmen who knew him--and there were few who did not--were his friends, for he was working in their interests. At whichever cabin he drew rein he was certain of a hospitable reception.  With no clearly defined idea of where he would spend the remaining hours of the night, he turned the nose of Queenie toward the ranges, among the mountain spurs.  Grizzly Weber and Budd Hankinson would stay near the cattle for an indefinite time, and he was debating whether to join them or to ride on to the ranch of Dick Hawkridge, a number of miles to the northeast, when his meditations were broken in upon in the most startling manner.  During those perilous times, the lonely horseman, in a dangerous region, relies much on his intelligent steed for warning. While Monteith Sterry could do a great deal of thinking in the saddle, he was too alert to drop into a brown study that would divert his thoughts from his surroundings.  He was no more than a mile from the Whitney ranch when his mare pricked up her ears, gave an almost inaudible whinny, and slightly slackened her pace.  That meant that she scented danger, and her rider was on the _qui vive_.  He tightened the rein and drew her to a full stop. She turned her head to the right and looked steadily in that direction, with her pretty ears thrown forward. This meant that whatever impended was coming from that point of the compass.  But the keen eyes of Mont Sterry could not penetrate the moonlight sufficiently far to detect anything. He was out of the saddle in a twinkling, and tried a trick learned from the old hunters. He pressed one ear against the ground, which, as all know, is a much better conductor of sound than the air.  This told the story he anticipated. The faint but distinct clamping of horses' hoofs was heard. The number was indefinite, but, somewhat to his surprise, none of them was running or loping; all were moving on a walk.  The noise was so clear that when he rose to his feet and looked off to the right he expected to see the animals and their riders, and he was not disappointed.  On the outer margin of the field of vision the outlines of several horsemen assumed shape. They were approaching, and one of their steeds emitted a whinny, as a salutation to the"]]]
