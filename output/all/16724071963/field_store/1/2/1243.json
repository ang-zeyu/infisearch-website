The view from this point, aptly named Gibbet Hill, is quite magnificent for Surrey.  On the northern slope of Blackdown--the high ridge of hills towards the south-east--is Aldworth House, where Tennyson resided in his latter years.  [Illustration: THE PORTSMOUTH ROAD.

In 1871, while _Middlemarch_ was appearing in parts, George Eliot, who as Mr. Lewes said, \"never seemed at home except under a broad sweep of sky,\" spent part of the spring and summer at Brookbank,--an old-fashioned gabled cottage in the village (close to the church) with delightful lattice-paned windows,--belonging to a Mrs. Gilchrist. At this time George Eliot was in a delicate state of health and scarcely equal to finishing her new story. One cannot call it a novel, for it had no plot. It was simply a remarkable picture of provincial life in the first half of the nineteenth century. George Eliot greatly enjoyed her quiet life at Shottermill, although many of her friends thought it incomprehensible that she could endure such a secluded life. One can scarcely read her graphic description of the sweet beauty of a Warwickshire lane, with its hedgerows all radiant in summer beauty, without feeling how much this remarkable woman loved it all, and in some degree one may understand how restful were the village surroundings. They led a most uneventful life, but occasionally would pay a visit to Tennyson, whose house at Aldworth was only 3 miles off. George Eliot rarely went out in the daytime, but sometimes she would go to see some cottagers and have a chat with them. A farmer's wife was greatly astonished at her knowledge of butter-making, and of the growth of fruit and vegetables, little imagining that in her early days, after her mother's death, the great authoress had managed the dairy in her own home at Griff House.

Railway. =Nearest Station.=--Billingshurst (3 miles from Thakeham). =Distance from London.=--44 miles. =Average Time.=--1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours.                       1st      2nd      3rd =Fares.=--Single   7s. 2d.  4s. 8d.  3s. 6-1/2d.           Return  11s. 5d.  8s. 2d.  7s. 1d.  =Accommodation Obtainable.=--None at Thakeham. \"King's Arms\"   at Billingshurst.  The little chapel where the great William Penn used to worship when he lived at the old mansion of Warminghurst is so entirely buried in the country that one must make careful inquiries in order to find one's way to it from Billingshurst. When one reaches the cottage at last, one finds a gate right across the road, for beyond it the lane gradually deteriorates to a mere grassy track between hedges. Locally this Thakeham meeting-house is known as the \"Blue Idol,\" a name not altogether explained when one discovers that for a long period the interior of the chapel had blue-washed walls.  As one may see from the drawing given here, it is an exceedingly quaint old building, the portion shown being used as a meeting-house, the other half being a cottage occupied by the family who act as caretakers. The cream-washed walls are broken up by the richly mellowed half-timber work, and above is the roof of grey green Horsham slabs splashed over with bright orange lichen.  Inside there are the very old oaken settles as well as less ancient ones. The timber framing shows on the walls and roof, here, as on the exterior, and the general quaintness of the place is enhanced by the old stone-flagged floor. Of William Penn's house at Warminghurst no traces whatever remain, but this only helps to increase the interest in the little chapel which has remained entirely unaltered for over two centuries. Penn, who bought the house in 1682, probably chose its site on account of its remoteness, for those were the days when their meetings were at any moment liable to interruption--when the members of the congregation met together knowing well that discovery meant imprisonment. In the quaint little meeting-house it is easy to feel the spirit of the Quakers, and one may almost imagine that one hears outside the rumble of the wheels of the heavy ox-waggon in which Penn drove over from Warminghurst Place.

Railway. =Nearest Station.=--Alton (1 mile from Chawton). =Distance from London.=--46-1/2 miles. =Average Time.=--Varies between 1-3/4 to 2 hours.                       1st      2nd      3rd =Fares.=--Single   7s. 9d.  5s. 0d.  3s. 10-1/2d.           Return  13s. 6d.  8s. 8d.  7s.  9d.  =Accommodation Obtainable.=--At Alton--\"Swan Hotel,\" \"Crown   Hotel,\" etc.  Situated about a mile from Alton Station, on the main line of the South-Western Railway, is the little village of Chawton, the residence of Jane Austen at the time when she was producing her best literary work. A walk along the main Winchester road brings one to the charming old-world place, and, keeping on past the thatched cottages of the village, one reaches a small brick house on the right-hand side, near a pond, just before the road divides for Winchester and Gosport. This building, which is now tenanted by a workman's club, was Chawton Cottage, where Jane Austen spent some of the brightest days of her life, and wrote her most successful novels, books which are more highly appreciated at the present day than they were during the lifetime of the authoress.  Her father was rector of Steventon, another Hampshire village, at which place his daughter was born in 1775, and where her early days were spent. Jane Austen's novels are remarkable for the truthfulness and charm with which they reproduce the everyday life of the upper middle classes in England in her time, and for delicate and yet distinct insight into every variety of the human character. Miss Austen's first four novels, _Sense and Sensibility_, _Pride and Prejudice_, _Mansfield Park_, and _Emma_, were published anonymously.  A short distance along the Gosport road is Chawton Park, a remarkably fine Elizabethan mansion, occupied in Miss Austen's time by Edward Knight, the lord of the manor. This country seat, which is not accessible to visitors, was most probably the original of _Mansfield Park_, and in the little church close by are several monuments to the Knight family. Miss Austen died at Winchester on July 24, 1817, and is buried in the cathedral. The brass to her memory is in the north aisle.  Within easy walking distance is Gilbert White's home at Selborne, which is treated under a separate heading (p. 70).  [Illustration: JANE AUSTEN'S COTTAGE AT CHAWTON.  _Sense and Sensibility_, _Pride and Prejudice_, and _Northanger Abbey_ were revised and partly rewritten here; and _Emma_, _Mansfield Park_, and _Persuasion_ were entirely produced at the cottage.]    SELBORNE  THE HOME OF GILBERT WHITE   =How to get there.=--Train from Waterloo.

A vast chalk hill rises some 300 feet above the south-western side of the village, part of which is covered with an extensive beech wood, called \"The Hanger,\" and a down or sheep-walk. This down is a beautiful park-like spot, with a delightful woodland, now bounded by the Sussex Downs. The village lies at the foot of the chalk hill parallel with the Hanger, and contains only one straggling street, nearly a mile in length, a small rivulet rising at each end. The stream at the north-western end often fails, but the other, known as the \"Well-Head,\" is a fine spring, seldom influenced by drought. Wolmer Forest, near by, is famed for its timber. In the centre of the village, on a piece of ground commonly known as \"The Plestor,\" there stood, until the fearful storm of 1703, a colossal oak tree, with a short body and enormous horizontally spreading arms. The stone steps, with seats above them, surrounding the tree, formed a favourite resort for both old and young during summer evenings. This oak, together with an equally large elm tree, are mentioned by White.  Gilbert White was born in 1720. He began his education at Basingstoke, from whence he proceeded in 1739 to Oriel College, Oxford, and finally became one of the senior proctors of the university "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11656"],["title","The Great Shadow and Other Napoleonic Tales (#0)"],["body","GREAT SHADOW AND OTHER NAPOLEONIC TALES   A.

It is strange to me, Jock Calder of West Inch, to feel that though now, in the very centre of the nineteenth century, I am but five-and-fifty years of age, and though it is only once in a week perhaps that my wife can pluck out a little grey bristle from over my ear, yet I have lived in a time when the thoughts and the ways of men were as different as though it were another planet from this.  For when I walk in my fields I can see, down Berwick way, the little fluffs of white smoke which tell me of this strange new hundred-legged beast, with coals for food and a thousand men in its belly, for ever crawling over the border. On a shiny day I can see the glint of the brass work as it takes the curve near Corriemuir; and then, as I look out to sea, there is the same beast again, or a dozen of them maybe, leaving a trail of black in the air and of white in the water, and swimming in the face of the wind as easily as a salmon up the Tweed.  Such a sight as that would have struck my good old father speechless with wrath as well as surprise; for he was so stricken with the fear of offending the Creator that he was chary of contradicting Nature, and always held the new thing to be nearly akin to the blasphemous.  As long as God made the horse, and a man down Birmingham way the engine, my good old dad would have stuck by the saddle and the spurs.  But he would have been still more surprised had he seen the peace and kindliness which reigns now in the hearts of men, and the talk in the papers and at the meetings that there is to be no more war--save, of course, with blacks and such like.  For when he died we had been fighting with scarce a break, save only during two short years, for very nearly a quarter of a century.  Think of it, you who live so quietly and peacefully now!  Babies who were born in the war grew to be bearded men with babies of their own, and still the war continued.  Those who had served and fought in their stalwart prime grew stiff and bent, and yet the ships and the armies were struggling.  It was no wonder that folk came at last to look upon it as the natural state, and thought how queer it must seem to be at peace.  During that long time we fought the Dutch, we fought the Danes, we fought the Spanish, we fought the Turks, we fought the Americans, we fought the Monte-Videans, until it seemed that in this universal struggle no race was too near of kin, or too far away, to be drawn into the quarrel.  But most of all it was the French whom we fought, and the man whom of all others we loathed and feared and admired was the great Captain who ruled them.  It was very well to draw pictures of him, and sing songs about him, and make as though he were an impostor; but I can tell you that the fear of that man hung like a black shadow over all Europe, and that there was a time when the glint of a fire at night upon the coast would set every woman upon her knees and every man gripping for his musket.  He had always won: that was the terror of it.  The Fates seemed to be behind him.  And now we knew that he lay upon the northern coast with a hundred and fifty thousand veterans, and the boats for their passage.  But it is an old story, how a third of the grown folk of our country took up arms, and how our little one-eyed, one-armed man crushed their fleet. There was still to be a land of free thinking and free speaking in Europe.  There was a great beacon ready on the hill by Tweedmouth, built up of logs and tar-barrels; and I can well remember how, night after night, I strained my eyes to see if it were ablaze.  I was only eight at the time, but it is an age when one takes a grief to heart, and I felt as though the fate of the country hung in some fashion upon me and my vigilance.  And then one night as I looked I suddenly saw a little flicker on the beacon hill--a single red tongue of flame in the darkness.  I remember how I rubbed my eyes, and pinched myself, and rapped my knuckles against the stone window-sill, to make sure that I was indeed awake.  And then the flame shot higher, and I saw the red quivering line upon the water between; and I dashed into the kitchen, screeching to my father that the French had crossed and the Tweedmouth light was aflame.  He had been talking to Mr. Mitchell, the law student from Edinburgh; and I can see him now as he knocked his pipe out at the side of the fire, and looked at me from over the top of his horn spectacles.  \"Are you sure, Jock?\" says he.  \"Sure as death!\" I gasped.  He reached out his hand for the Bible upon the table, and opened it upon his knee as though he meant to read to us; but he shut it again in silence, and hurried out.  We went too, the law student and I, and followed him down to the gate which opens out upon the highway.  From there we could see the red light of the big beacon, and the glimmer of a smaller one to the north of us at Ayton.  My mother came down with two plaids to keep the chill from us, and we all stood there until morning, speaking little to each other, and that little in a whisper.  The road had more folk on it than ever passed along it at night before; for many of the yeomen up our way had enrolled themselves in the Berwick volunteer regiments, and were riding now as fast as hoof could carry them for the muster.  Some had a stirrup cup or two before parting, and I cannot forget one who tore past on a huge white horse, brandishing a great rusty sword in the moonlight.  They shouted to us as they passed that the North Berwick Law fire was blazing, and that it was thought that the alarm had come from Edinburgh Castle.  There were a few who galloped the other way, couriers for Edinburgh, and the laird's son, and Master Clayton, the deputy sheriff, and such like.  And among others there was one a fine built, heavy man on a roan horse, who pulled up at our gate and asked some question about the road.  He took off his hat to ease himself, and I saw that he had a kindly long-drawn face, and a great high brow that shot away up into tufts of sandy hair.  \"I doubt it's a false alarm,\" said he.  \"Maybe I'd ha' done well to bide where I was; but now I've come so far, I'll break my fast with the regiment.\"  He clapped spurs to his horse, and away he went down the brae.  \"I ken him weel,\" said our student, nodding after him.  \"He's a lawyer in Edinburgh, and a braw hand at the stringin' of verses.  Wattie Scott is his name.\"  None of us had heard of it then; but it was not long before it was the best known name in Scotland, and many a time we thought of how he speered his way of us on the night of the terror.  But early in the morning we had our minds set at ease.  It was grey and cold, and my mother had gone up to the house to make a pot of tea for us, when there came a gig down the road with Dr. Horscroft of Ayton in it and his son Jim.  The collar of the doctor's brown coat came over his ears, and he looked in a deadly black humour; for Jim, who was but fifteen years of age, had trooped off to Berwick at the first alarm with his father's new fowling piece.  All night his dad had chased him, and now there he was, a prisoner, with the barrel of the stolen gun sticking out from behind the seat.  He looked as sulky as his father, with his hands thrust into his side-pockets, his brows drawn down, and his lower lip thrusting out.  \"It's all a lie!\" shouted the doctor as he passed.  \"There has been no landing, and all the fools in Scotland have been gadding about the roads for nothing.\"  His son Jim snarled something up at him on this, and his father struck him a blow with his clenched fist on the side of his head, which sent the boy's chin forward upon his breast as though he had been stunned. My father shook his head, for he had a liking for Jim; but we all walked up to the house again, nodding and blinking, and hardly able to keep our eyes open now that we knew that all was safe, but with a thrill of joy at our hearts such as I have only matched once or twice in my lifetime.  Now all this has little enough to do with what I took my pen up to tell about; but when a man has a good memory and little skill, he cannot draw one thought from his mind without a dozen others trailing out behind it. And yet, now that I come to think of it, this had something to do with it after all; for Jim Horscroft had so deadly a quarrel with his father, that he was packed off to the Berwick Academy, and as my father had long wished me to go there, he took advantage of this chance to send me also.  But before I say a word about this school, I shall go back to where I should have begun, and give you a hint as to who I am; for it may be that these words of mine may be read by some folk beyond the border country who never heard of the Calders of  West Inch.  It has a brave sound, West Inch, but it is not a fine estate with a braw house upon it, but only a great hard-bitten, wind-swept sheep run, fringing off into links along the sea-shore, where a frugal man might with hard work just pay his rent and have butter instead of treacle on Sundays.  In the centre there is a grey-stoned slate-roofed house with a byre behind it, and \"1703\" scrawled in stonework over the lintel of the door.  There for more than a hundred years our folk have lived, until, for all their poverty, they came to take a good place among the"]]]
