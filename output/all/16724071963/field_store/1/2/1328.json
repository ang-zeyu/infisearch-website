From the recess formed by a shop door he peered out at Gray, where the light of a street lamp fell upon him, studying his face, his movements, with unrelaxing vigilance.  Gray, following some moments of indecision, strode off towards Piccadilly. The little man came out cautiously from his hiding-place and looked after him. Out of a dark porch, ten paces along Bond Street, appeared a burly figure to fall into step a few yards behind Gray. The little man licked his lips appreciatively and returned to the doorway below the premises of Kazmah.  Reaching Piccadilly, Gray stood for a time on the corner, indifferent to the jostling of passers-by. Finally he crossed, walked along to the Prince’s Restaurant, and entered the lobby. He glanced at his wrist-watch. It registered the hour of seven-twenty-five.  He cancelled his order for a table and was standing staring moodily towards the entrance when the doors swung open and a man entered who stepped straight up to him, hand extended, and:  “Glad to see you, Gray,” he said. “What’s the trouble?”  Quentin Gray stared as if incredulous at the speaker, and it was with an unmistakable note of welcome in his voice that he replied:  “Seton! Seton Pasha!”  The frown disappeared from Gray’s forehead, and he gripped the other’s hand in hearty greeting. But:  “Stick to plain Seton!” said the new-comer, glancing rapidly about him. “Ottoman titles are not fashionable.”  The speaker was a man of arresting personality. Above medium height, well but leanly built, the face of Seton “Pasha” was burned to a deeper shade than England’s wintry sun is capable of producing. He wore a close-trimmed beard and moustache, and the bronze on his cheeks enhanced the brightness of his grey eyes and rendered very noticeable a slight frosting of the dark hair above his temples. He had the indescribable air of a “sure” man, a sound man to have beside one in a tight place; and looking into the rather grim face, Quentin Gray felt suddenly ashamed of himself. From Seton Pasha he knew that he could keep nothing back. He knew that presently he should find himself telling this quiet, brown-skinned man the whole story of his humiliation—and he knew that Seton would not spare his feelings.  “My dear fellow,” he said, “you must pardon me if I sometimes fail to respect your wishes in this matter. When I left the East the name of Seton Pasha was on everybody’s tongue. But are you alone?”  “I am. I only arrived in London tonight and in England this morning.”  “Were you thinking of dining here?”  “No; I saw you through the doorway as I was passing. But this will do as well as another place. I gather that you are disengaged. Perhaps you will dine with me?”  “Splendid!” cried Gray. “Wait a moment. Perhaps my table hasn’t gone!”  He ran off in his boyish, impetuous fashion, and Seton watched him, smiling quietly.  The table proved to be available, and ere long the two were discussing an excellent dinner. Gray lost much of his irritability and began to talk coherently upon topics of general interest. Presently, following an interval during which he had been covertly watching his companion:  “Do you know, Seton,” he said, “you are the one man in London whose company I could have tolerated tonight.”  “My arrival was peculiarly opportune.”  “Your arrivals are always peculiarly opportune.” Gray stared at Seton with an expression of puzzled admiration. “I don’t think I shall ever understand your turning up immediately before the Senussi raid in Egypt. Do you remember? I was with the armored cars.”  “I remember perfectly.”  “Then you vanished in the same mysterious fashion, and the C. O. was a sphinx on the subject. I next saw you strolling out of the gate at Baghdad. How the devil you’d got to Baghdad, considering that you didn’t come with us and that you weren’t with the cavalry, heaven only knows!”  “No,” said Seton judicially, gazing through his uplifted wine-glass; “when one comes to consider the matter without prejudice it is certainly odd. But do I know the lady to whose non-appearance I owe the pleasure of your company tonight?”  Quentin Gray stared at him blankly.  “Really, Seton, you amaze me. Did I say that I had an appointment with a lady?”  “My dear Gray, when I see a man standing biting his nails and glaring out into Piccadilly from a restaurant entrance I ask myself a question. When I learn that he has just cancelled an order for a table for two I answer it.”  Gray laughed. “You always make me feel so infernally young, Seton.”  “Good!”  “Yes, it’s good to feel young, but bad to feel a young fool; and that’s what I feel—and what I am. Listen!”  Leaning across the table so that the light of the shaded lamp fell fully upon his flushed, eager face, Gray, not without embarrassment, told his companion of the “dirty trick”—so he phrased it—which Sir Lucien Pyne had played upon him. In conclusion:  “What would you do, Seton?” he asked.  Seton sat regarding him in silence with a cool, calculating stare which some men had termed insolent, absently tapping his teeth with the gold rim of a monocle which he carried but apparently never used for any other purpose; and it was at about this time that a long low car passed near the door of the restaurant, crossing the traffic stream of Piccadilly to draw up at the corner of old Bond Street.  From the car Monte Irvin alighted and, telling the man to wait, set out on foot. Ten paces along Bond Street he encountered a small, stooping figure which became detached from the shadows of a shop door. The light of a street lamp shone down upon the sharp, hooked nose and into the cunning little brown eyes of Brisley, of Spinker’s Detective Agency. Monte Irvin started.  “Ah, Brisley!” he said, “I was looking for you. Are they still there?”  “Probably, sir.” Brisley licked his lips. “My colleague, Gunn, reports no one came out whilst I was away ’phoning.”  “But the whole thing seems preposterous. Are there no other offices in the block where they might be?”  “I personally saw Mr. Gray, Sir Lucien Pyne and the lady go into Kazmah’s. At that time—roughly, ten to seven—all the other offices had been closed, approximately, one hour.”  “There is absolutely no possibility that they might have come out unseen by you?”  “None, sir. I should not have troubled a client if in doubt. Here’s Gunn.”  Old Bond Street now was darkened and deserted; the yellow mist had turned to fine rain, and Gunn, his hands thrust in his pockets, was sheltering under the porch of the arcade. Gunn possessed a purple complexion which attained to full vigor of coloring in the nasal region. His moustache of dirty grey was stained brown in the centre as if by frequent potations of stout, and his bulky figure was artificially enlarged by the presence of two overcoats, the outer of which was a waterproof and the inner a blue garment appreciably longer both in sleeve and skirt than the former. The effect produced was one of great novelty. Gunn touched the brim of his soft felt hat, which he wore turned down all round apparently in imitation of a flower-pot.  “All snug, sir,” he said, hoarsely and confidentially, bending forward and breathing the words into Irvin’s ear. “Snug as a bee in a hive. You’re as good as a bachelor again.”  Monte Irvin mentally recoiled.  “Lead the way to the door of this place,” he said tersely.  “Yes, sir, this way, sir. Be careful of the step there. You may remark that the outer door is not yet closed. I am informed upon reliable authority as the last to go locks the door. Hence we perceive that the last has not yet gone. It is likewise opened by the first to come of a mornin’. Here we are, sir; door on the right.”  The landing was in darkness, but as Gunn spoke he directed the ray of a pocket lamp upon a bronze plate bearing the name “Kazmah.” He rested one hand upon his hip.  “All snug,” he repeated; “as snug as a eel in mud. The _decree nisi_ is yours, sir. As an alderman of the City of London and a Justice of the Peace you are entitled to call a police officer—”  “Hold your tongue!” rapped Irvin. “You’ve been drinking: and I place no reliance whatever in your evidence. I do not believe that my wife or any one else but ourselves is upon these premises.”  The watery eyes of the insulted man protruded unnaturally. “Drinkin’!” he whispered, “drink—”  But indignation now deprived Gunn of speech and:  “Excuse me, sir,” interrupted the nasal voice of Brisley, “but I can absolutely answer for Gunn. Reputation of the Agency at stake. Worked with us for three years. Parties undoubtedly on the premises as reported.”  “Drink—” whispered Gunn.  “I shall be glad,” said Monte Irvin, and his voice shook emotionally, “if you will lend me your pocket lamp. I am naturally upset. Will you kindly both go downstairs. I will call if I want you.”  The two men obeyed, Gunn muttering hoarsely to Brisley; and Monte Irvin was left standing on the landing, the lamp in his hand. He waited until he knew from the sound of their footsteps that the pair had regained the street, then, resting his arm against the closed door, and pressing his forehead to the damp sleeve of his coat, he stood awhile, the lamp, which he held limply, shining down upon the floor.  His lips moved, and almost inaudibly he murmured his wife’s name.     CHAPTER V. THE DOOR IS OPENED   Quentin Gray and Seton strolled out of Prince’s and both paused whilst Seton lighted a long black cheroot.  “It seems a pity to waste that box,” said Gray. “Suppose we look in at the Gaiety for an hour?”  His humor was vastly improved, and he watched the passing throngs with an expression more suited to his boyish good looks than that of anger and mortification which had rested upon him an hour earlier.  Seton Pasha tossed a match into the road.  “My official business is finished for the day,” he replied. “I place myself unreservedly in your hands.”  “Well, then,” began Gray—and paused.  A long, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],["title","Dope (#4)"],["body","car, the chauffeur temporarily detained by the stoppage of a motorbus ahead, had slowed up within three yards of the spot where they were standing. Gray seized Seton’s arm in a fierce grip.  “Seton,” he said, his voice betraying intense excitement, “Look! There is Monte Irvin!”  “In the car?”  “Yes, yes! But—he has two _police_ with him! Seton, what can it mean?”  The car moved away, swinging to the right across the traffic stream and clearly heading for old Bond Street. Quentin Gray’s mercurial color deserted him, and he turned to Seton a face grown suddenly pale.  “Good God,” he whispered, “something has happened to Rita!”  Neglectful of his personal safety, he plunged out into the traffic, dodging this way and that, and making after Monte Irvin’s car. Of the fact that his friend was close beside him he remained unaware until, on the corner of old Bond Street, a firm grip settled upon his shoulder. Gray turned angrily. But the grip was immovable, and he found himself staring into the unemotional face of Seton Pasha.  “Seton, for God’s sake, don’t detain me! I must learn what’s wrong.”  “Pull up, Gray.”  Quentin Gray clenched his teeth.  “Listen to me, Seton. This is no time for interference. I—”  “You are about to become involved in some very unsavory business; and I repeat—pull up. In a moment we shall learn all there is to be learned. But are you determined openly to thrust yourself into the family affairs of Mr. Monte Irvin?”  “If anything has happened to Rita I’ll kill that damned cur Pyne!”  “You are determined to intrude upon this man in your present frame of mind at a time of evident trouble?”  But Gray was deaf to the promptings of prudence and good taste alike.  “I’m going to see the thing through,” he said hoarsely.  “Quite so. Rely upon me. But endeavor to behave more like a man of the world and less like a dangerous lunatic, or we shall quarrel atrociously.”  Quentin Gray audibly gnashed his teeth, but the cool stare of the other’s eyes was quelling, and now as their glances met and clashed, a sympathetic smile softened the lines of Seton’s grim mouth, and:  “I quite understand, old chap,” he said, linking his arm in Gray’s. “But can’t you see how important it is, for everybody’s sake, that we should tackle the thing coolly?”  “Seton”—Gray’s voice broke—“I’m sorry. I know I’m mad; but I was with her only an hour ago, and now—”  “And now ‘her’ husband appears on the scene accompanied by a police inspector and a sergeant. What are your relations with Mr. Monte Irvin?”  They were walking rapidly again along Bond Street.  “What do you mean, Seton?” asked Gray.  “I mean does he approve of your friendship with his wife, or is it a clandestine affair?”  “Clandestine?—certainly not. I was on my way to call at the house when I met her with Pyne this evening.”  “That is what I wanted to know. Very well; since you intend to follow the thing up, it simplifies matters somewhat. Here is the car.”  “At Kazmah’s door! What in heaven’s name does it mean?”  “It means that we shall get a very poor reception if we intrude. Question the chauffeur.”  But Gray had already approached the man, who touched his cap in recognition.  “What’s the trouble, Pattison?” he demanded breathlessly. “I saw police in the car a moment ago.”  “Yes, sir. I don’t rightly know, sir, what’s happened. But Mr. Irvin drove from home to the corner of old Bond Street a quarter of an hour ago and told me to wait, then came back again and drove round to Vine Street to fetch the police. They’re inside now.”  Even as he spoke, with excitement ill-concealed, a police-sergeant came out of the doorway, and:  “Move on, there,” he said to Seton and Gray. “You mustn’t hang about this door.”  “Excuse me, Sergeant,” cried Gray, “but if the matter concerns Mrs. Monte Irvin I can probably supply information.”  The Sergeant stared at him hard, saw that both he and his friend wore evening dress, and grew proportionately respectful.  “What is your name, sir?” he asked. “I’ll mention it to the officer in charge.”  “Quentin Gray. Inform Mr. Monte Irvin that I wish to speak to him.”  “Very good, sir.” He turned to the chauffeur. “Hand me out the bag I gave you at Vine Street.” Pattison leaned over the door at the front of the car, and brought out a big leather grip. With this in hand the police-sergeant returned into the doorway.  “We’re in for it now,” said Seton grimly, “whatever it is.”  Gray returned no answer, moving restlessly up and down before the door in a fever of excitement and dread. Presently the Sergeant reappeared.  “Step this way, please,” he said.  Followed by Seton and Gray he led the way up to the landing before Kazmah’s apartments. It was vaguely lighted by two police-lanterns. Four men were standing there, and four pairs of eyes were focussed upon the stair-head.  Monte Irvin, his features a distressing ashen color, spoke.  “That you, Gray?” Quentin Gray would not have recognized the voice. “Thanks for offering your help. God knows I need all I can get. You were with Rita tonight. What happened? Where is she?”  “Heaven knows where she is!” cried Gray. “I left her here with Pyne shortly after seven o’clock.”  He paused, fixing his gaze upon the face of Brisley, whose shifty eyes avoided him and who was licking his lips in the manner of a dog who has seen the whip.  “Why,” said Gray, “I believe you are the fellow who has been following me all night for some reason.”  He stepped toward the foxy little man but:  “Never mind, Gray,” interrupted Irvin. “I was to blame. But he was following my wife, not you. Tell me quickly: Why did she come here?”  Gray raised his hand to his brow with a gesture of bewilderment.  “To consult this man, Kazmah. I actually saw her enter the inner room, I went to get a cab, and when I returned the door was locked.”  “You knocked?”  “Of course. I made no end of a row. But I could get no reply and went away.”  Monte Irvin turned, a pathetic figure, to the Inspector who stood beside him.  “We may as well proceed, Inspector Whiteleaf,” he said. “Mr. Gray’s evidence throws no light on the matter at all.”  “Very well, sir,” was the reply; “we have the warrant, and have given the usual notice to whoever may be hiding inside. Burton!”  The Sergeant stepped forward, placed the leather bag on the floor, and stooping, opened it, revealing a number of burglarious-looking instruments.  “Shall I try to cut through the panel?” he asked.  “No, no!” cried Monte Irvin. “Waste no time. You have a crowbar there. Force the door from its hinges. Hurry, man!”  “It doesn’t work on hinges!” Gray interrupted excitedly. “It slides to the right by means of some arrangement concealed under the mat.”  “Pass that lantern,” directed Burton, glancing over his shoulder to Gunn.  Setting it beside him, the Sergeant knelt and examined the threshold of the door.  “A metal plate,” he said. “The weight moves a lever, I suppose, which opens the door if it isn’t locked. The lock will be on the left of the door as it opens to the right. Let’s see what we can do.”  He stood up, crowbar in hand, and inserted the chisel blade of the implement between the edge of the door and the doorcase.  “Hold steady!” said the Inspector, standing at his elbow.  The dull metallic sound of hammer blows on steel echoed queerly around the well of the staircase. Brisley and Gunn, standing very close together on the bottom step of the stair to the third floor, watched the police furtively. Irvin and Gray found a common fascination in the door itself, and Seton, cheroot in mouth, looked from group to group with quiet interest.  “Right!” cried the Sergeant.  The blows ceased.  Firmly grasping the bar, Burton brought all his weight to bear upon it. There was a dull, cracking sound and a sort of rasping. The door moved slightly.  “There’s where it locks!” said the Inspector, directing the light of a lantern upon the crevice created. “Three inches lower. But it may be bolted as well.”  “We’ll soon get at the bolts,” replied Burton, the lust of destruction now strong upon him.  Wrenching the crowbar from its place he attacked the lower panel of the door, and amid a loud splintering and crashing created a hole big enough to allow of the passage of a hand and arm.  The Inspector reached in, groped about, and then uttered an exclamation of triumph.  “I’ve unfastened the bolt,” he said. “If there isn’t another at the top you ought to be able to force the door now, Burton.”  The jimmy was thrust back into position, and:  “Stand clear!” cried Burton.  Again he threw his weight upon the bar—and again.  “Drive it further in!” said Monte Irvin; and snatching up the heavy hammer, he rained blows upon the steel butt. “Now try.”  Burton exerted himself to the utmost.  “Take hold up here, someone!” he panted. “Two of us can pull.”  Gray leapt forward, and the pair of them bent to the task.  There came a dull report of parting mechanism, more sounds of splintering wood... and the door rolled open!  A moment of tense silence, then:  “Is anyone inside there?” cried the Inspector loudly.  Not a sound came from the dark interior.  “The lantern!” whispered Monte Irvin.  He stumbled into the room, from which a heavy smell of perfume swept out upon the landing. Quentin Gray, snatching the lantern from the floor, where it had been replaced, was the next to enter.  “Look for the switch, and turn the lights on!” called the Inspector, following.  Even as he spoke, Gray had found the switch, and the apartment of Kazmah became flooded with subdued light.  A glance showed it to be unoccupied.  Gray ran across to the _mushrabîyeh_ cabinet and jerked the curtains aside. There was no one in the cabinet. It contained a chair and a table. Upon the latter was a telephone and some papers and books. “This way!” he cried, his voice high pitched and unnatural.  He burst through the doorway into the inner room which he had seen Mrs. Irvin enter. The air was laden with the smell of frankincense.  “A lantern!” he called. “I"]]]
