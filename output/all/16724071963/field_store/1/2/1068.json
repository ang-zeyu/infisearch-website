(3) SILVERY SPLEENWORT. ATHÝRIUM ACROSTICHÒIDES  _Asplènium acrostichòides. Asplènium thelypteròides_  Fronds two to four feet tall, pinnate, tapering both ways from the middle. Pinnæ deeply pinnatifid, linear-lanceolate, acuminate. Lobes oblong, obtuse, minutely toothed, each bearing two rows of oblong or linear fruit-dots. Indusium silvery when young.  [Illustration: Silvery Spleenwort. _Athyrium acrostichoides_]  [Illustration: Silvery Spleenwort. Athyrium acrostichoides]  The sterile fronds come up first and the taller, fertile ones do not appear until late in June. Where there are no fruit-dots the hairs on the upper surface of the fronds will help to distinguish it from specimens of the Marsh fern tribe, which it somewhat resembles. The regular rows of nearly straight, clear-cut sori of the fertile fronds are very attractive, and the lower ones, as well as those at the slender tips of the pinnæ, are frequently double.  Rich woods and moist, shady banks, New England to Kentucky and westward. Generally distributed but hardly common.  (4) NARROW-LEAVED SPLEENWORT  ATHÝRIUM ANGUSTIFÒLIUM. _Asplenium angustifòlium_  Fronds one to four feet tall, pinnate. Pinnæ numerous, thin, short-stalked, linear-lanceolate, acuminate, those of the fertile fronds narrower. Fruit-dots linear. Indusium slightly convex.  [Illustration: Narrow-leaved Spleenwort. _Athyrium angustifolium_ (Vermont) (Geo. E. Davenport)]  In rich woods from southern Canada and New Hampshire to Minnesota and southward. September. Not common. Mt. Toby, Mass., Berlin and Meriden, Conn., and Danville, Vt. Can be cultivated but should not be exposed to severe weather, as its thin and delicate fronds are easily injured. Woolson writes of it, \"There is nothing in the fern kingdom which looks so cool and refreshing on a hot day as a mass of this clear-cut, delicately made-up fern.\"  [Illustration: Pinnæ and Sori of _Athyrium angustifolium_]     HART'S TONGUE  _Scolopéndrium_. PHYLLÌTIS  Sori linear, a row on either side of the midvein, and at right angles to it, the indusium appearing to be double. (_Scolopendrium_ is the Greek for centipede, whose feet the sori were thought to resemble. _Phyllitis_ is the ancient Greek name for a fern.) Only one species in the United States.  [Illustration: Sori of _Scolopendrium vulgare_]  (1) _Scolopendrium vulgàre_  PHYLLÌTIS SCOLOPÉNDRIUM  Fronds thick and leathery, oblong-lanceolate from an auricled, heart-shaped base, ten to twenty inches long and one to two inches wide. Margin entire, bright green.  In shaded ravines under limestone cliffs. Chittenango Falls, and Scolopendrium Lake, central New York, and Tennessee. Also, locally in Ontario and New Brunswick. One of the rarest of our native ferns, although very common in Great Britain. This plant is said to be easily cultivated, and to produce numerous varieties. According to Woolson, \"No rockery is complete without the Hart's Tongue, the long, glossy, undulating fronds of which are sufficiently unique to distinguish any collection.\" In cultivation it \"needs light protection through the winter in northern New England.\"  [Illustration: Hart's Tongue. _Scolopendrium vulgare_ (Base of calcareous rocks, Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada)]   WALKING FERN. WALKING LEAF  _Camptosòrus_  Fruit-dots oblong or linear as in _Asplènium_, but irregularly scattered on either side of the reticulated veins of the simple frond, the outer ones sometimes confluent at their ends, forming crooked lines (hence, the name from the Greek meaning crooked sori). Only one species within our limits.  _Camptosòrus rhizophyllus_  Fronds evergreen, leathery, four to eighteen inches long, heart-shaped at the base, but tapering towards the apex, which often roots and forms a new plant. Veins reticulated. The auricles of this species are sometimes elongated and may even take root.  This curious and interesting fern is one of the finest for rockeries, the tips taking root in rock-fissures. Shaded limestone, or sometimes other rocks. Shapleigh and Winthrop, Me., rarely in New Hampshire (Lebanon), and Connecticut, Mt. Toby, Mass., and western New England; also Canada to Georgia and westward.  [Illustration: Walking Fern. _Camptosorus rhizophyllus_]     THE SHIELD FERNS   THE CHRISTMAS AND HOLLY FERNS  _Polýstichum_  These have been grouped with the wood ferns, but are now usually placed under the genus _Polýstichum_, which has the sori round and covered with a circular indusium fixed to the frond by its depressed center. The wood ferns, on the other hand, have a kidney-shaped indusium attached to the fronds by the sinus. (_Polýstichum_ is the Greek for many rows, the sori of some species being in many ranks.)  (1) THE CHRISTMAS FERN  _Polýstichum acrostichòides. Aspídium acrostichòides_  Stipes clothed with pale, brown scales. Frond rigid and evergreen, one to two feet long, lanceolate, pinnate. Pinnæ linear-lanceolate, scythe-shaped, auricled on the upper side, and with bristly teeth; fertile pinnæ contracted toward the top, bearing two rows of sori, which soon become confluent and cover the entire surface. Indusium orbicular, fixed by its depressed center.  _F. incìsum_ is a form in which the pinnæ are much incised.  _F. críspum_ has the edges of its pinnæ crisped and ruffled. The name Christmas fern, due to John Robinson, of Salem, Mass., suggests its fitness for winter decoration. Its deep green and glossy fronds insure it a welcome at Christmas time. \"Its mission is to cheer the winter months and enhance the beauty of the other ferns by contrast.\" In transplanting, a generous mass of earth should be included and its roots should not be disturbed.  [Illustration: Christmas Fern. _Polystichum acrostichoides_]  [Illustration: Christmas Fern. _Polystichum acrostichoides_]  [Illustration: Christmas Fern. _Polystichum acrostichoides_ Top, Forked Form; Bottom, Incised Form (Maine)]  (2) BRAUN'S HOLLY FERN  _Polystichum Bráunii. Aspídium aculeàtum Bráunii_  Fronds thick, rigid, one to two feet long, spreading, lanceolate, tapering both ways, bipinnate. Pinnules ovate or oblong, truncate, nearly rectangular at the base, sharply toothed and covered beneath with chaff and hairs. Fruit-dots small and near the mid veins. Indusium orbicular, entire. Stipes chaffy with brown scales.  [Illustration: Braun's Holly Fern. _Polystichum Braunii_ (Willoughby Mountain, Vt.) (Herbarium of G.H.T.)]  This handsome fern is rather common in northern New England. We have collected it in the Willoughby Lake region, Vt., and it is found at Mt. Mansfield, Randolph, and elsewhere in that state; also at Gorham, N.H., and Fernald reports it as common in northern Maine. It also grows in the mountains of New York and Pennsylvania, and westward. It was formerly thought to be a variety of the prickly shield fern (_P. aculeàtum_), which has a very wide range and numerous varieties. The fronds remain green through the winter but the stipes weaken and fall over.  (3) HOLLY FERN. _Polystichum Lonchìtis_  Fronds linear-lanceolate, short-stalked and rigid, eight to fifteen inches long. Pinnæ broadly lanceolate-falcate or the lowest triangular, strongly auricled on the upper side, densely spinulose-toothed. Sori midway between the margin and midrib.  [Illustration: Holly Fern. Polystichum Lonchitis (Nottawasaga, Canada, West, Right, Alaska, Left) (Herbarium of C.E. Davenport)]  The name holly fern suggests its resemblance to holly leaves with their bristle-tipped teeth. The specific name lonchìtis (like a spear) refers to its sharp teeth. A northern species growing in rocky woods from Labrador to Alaska, and south to Niagara Falls, Lake Superior and westward. Its southern limits nearly coincide with the northern limits of the Christmas fern.     THE MARSH FERN TRIBE   Under this designation Clute has grouped three of the shield ferns, which have a close family resemblance, and has thus distinguished them from the wood ferns, which also belong to the shield fern family.  (1) THE MARSH FERN  _Aspídium thelýpteris_. THELÝPTERIS PALÚSTRIS _Dryópteris thelýpteris. Nephròdium thelýpteris_  [Illustration: The Marsh Fern]  These are all good names and each one is worthy to be chosen. _Aspídium_, Greek for shield, in use for a century, adopted in all the seven editions of Gray's Manual, is still the most familiar and pleasing term to its friends. _Dryópteris_, Greek for oak fern, has been chosen by Underwood and Britton and Brown and has grown in favor. _Nephròdium_, meaning kidney-like, favored by Davenport, Waters and, of late, Clute, is a most fitting name. THELÝPTERIS, meaning lady fern, is found to be the earliest name in use and according to rule the correct one.  [Illustration: The Marsh Fern. _Aspidium Thelypteris_]  Fronds pinnate, lanceolate, slightly or not at all narrowed at the base. Pinnæ horizontal or slightly recurved, linear-lanceolate and deeply pinnatifid. Lobes obtuse, but appear acute when their margins are reflexed over the sori. Veins once forked. Indusium minute. Stipes tall, lifting the blades ten to fifteen inches above the mud, whence they spring.  The fronds of the marsh fern are apt to be sterile in deep shade. It may be readily distinguished from the New York fern by its broad base, instead of tapering to very small pinnæ; by its long stalk, lifting the blade up into the sunlight, and by the revolute margins of the fertile fronds, which have suggested for it the name of \"snuff-box\" fern. It is separated from the Massachusetts fern by its forked veins. Common in marshes and damp woodlands; Canada to Florida and westward. While the marsh fern loves moisture and shade it is sometimes found in dry, open fields. Miss Lilian A. Cole, of Union, Me., reports a colony as growing on land above the swale in which Twayblade and Adder's Tongue are found, \"around rock heaps in open sunlight on clay soil, but homely and twisted,\" as if a former"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11365"],["title","The Fern Lover's Companion (#8)"],["body","environment had been long since cleared away while the deserted ferns persisted.  (2) MASSACHUSETTS FERN  _Aspidium simulàtum_. THELÝPTERIS SIMULÀTA _Dryópteris simulata. Nephròdium simulàtum_  Fronds pinnate, one to three feet long, oblong-lanceolate, somewhat narrowed at the base. Pinnæ lanceolate, deeply pinnatifid, the lower most often turned inward. Veins simple. Indusium glandular. Sori rather large.  Resembles the marsh fern, of which it was once thought to be a variety. In some respects it is also like the New York fern, and is in fact intermediate between the two.  [Illustration: Massachusetts Fern. _Aspidium simulatum_ 1. Sterile Frond. 2. A Fruiting Pinnule. 3. Pinnule enlarged showing venation (From the \"Fern Bulletin\")]  That it is a distinct species was first pointed out by Raynal Dodge in 1880, and it later was named _simulàtum_ by Geo. E. Davenport because of its similarity to a form of the lady fern. It may be identified by its thin texture and particularly by its simple veins. On account of its close resemblance to the marsh fern, Clute would call it \"The lance-leaved Marsh Fern,\" instead of the irrelevant name of Massachusetts Fern. Woodland swamps usually in deep shade, New England to Maryland and westward. Often found growing with the marsh fern.  (3) NEW YORK FERN  _Aspidium noveboracénse_. THELÝPTERIS NOVEBORACÉNSIS _Dryópteris noveboracénsis. Nephròdium noveboracénse_  Fronds pinnate, tapering both ways from the middle. Pinnæ lanceolate, pinnatifid, the lowest pairs gradually shorter and deflexed. Veins simple. Indusium minute and beset with glands.  [Illustration: New York Fern. _Aspidium noveboracense_]  Very common in woodlands, preferring a dryer soil than the marsh fern. August. The fronds are pale green, delicate and hairy beneath along the midrib and veins.  [Illustration: Sori of New York Fern (From Waters's \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]  [Illustration: New York Fern. _Aspidium noveboracense_]  When bruised its resinous glands give out a pleasing, ferny odor. This species can be distinguished from every other by the greatly reduced pinnæ at its base. Throughout North America east of the Mississippi.     THE BEECH FERNS   The beech ferns are often classed with the polypodies, because, like them, they have no indusium; but in other ways they are more akin to the wood ferns. Their stipes are not jointed to the root stock, nor are their sori at the ends of the veins as in the polypodies. We here place them with the wood ferns, retaining the familiar name _Phegópteris_ but giving THELÝPTERIS as a synonym. The fruit-dots are small, round and naked, borne on the back of the veins below the apex. Stipe continuous with the rootstock. Veins free. (The name _Phegópteris_ in Greek means oak or beech fern.)  (1) OAK FERN  _Phegópteris dryópteris_. THELÝPTERIS DRYÓPTERIS  Fronds glabrous, broadly triangular, ternate, four to seven inches broad, the divisions widely spreading, each division pinnate at the base. Segments oblong, obtuse, entire or toothed. Fruit-dots near the margin. Rootstock slender and creeping from which fronds are produced all summer, in appearance like the small, ternate divisions of the bracken.  This dainty fern has fronds of a delicate yellow-green, \"the greenest of all green things growing.\" Its ternate character is shown even in the uncoiling of the fronds, the three round balls suggesting the sign of the pawnbroker. The parts of the oak fern develop with great regularity, each pinna, pinnule and lobe having another exactly opposite to it nearly always. In rocky woods, common northward; also in Virginia, Kansas and Colorado. A fine species for cultivation at the base of the artificial rockery.  [Illustration: Oak Fern. _Phegopteris Dryopteris_]    (2) THE NORTHERN OAK FERN  _Phegopteris Robertiana. Phegopteris calcàrea_  THELÝPTERIS ROBERTIÀNA  Resembles the oak fern, but with fronds rather larger, especially the terminal segment; also more rigid and coarser in appearance. Stalks and fronds minutely glandular beneath. Lower pinnules of the lateral divisions scarcely longer than the others. Often called \"Limestone Polypody,\" the beech ferns having formerly been classed with the polypodies. Britton and Brown designate it as the \"Scented Oak Fern.\" Canada and the northwestern states. Rare.  [Illustration: Northern Oak Fern. _Phegopteris Robertiana_ (From Water's \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]  [Illustration: BROAD BEECH FERN. Phegopteris hexagonoptera]  (3) BROAD BEECH FERN  _Phegopteris hexagonóptera_  THELÝPTERIS HEXAGONÓPTERA  Fronds triangular, broader than long, seven to twelve inches broad, spreading more or less horizontally at the summit of the stipe; pubescent and often glandular beneath; pinnæ fragrant, lanceolate, the lowest pair usually much larger than those above, having the segments elongated and cut into lobes. Basal segments decurrent and forming a many-angled wing along the main rachis. Fruit-dots small, near the margin.  The broad beech fern is usually larger than its sister, the long beech fern, and extends farther south, ranging from New England to Minnesota and southward to Florida. It is sometimes called \"six-angled polypody.\" According to Dodge it is most common in Rhode Island and Connecticut. It prefers rather dry, open woods. It is said to have a pleasant, ferny odor when bruised. August.  (4) LONG BEECH FERN  _Phegopteris polypodiòides_. THELÝPTERIS PHEGÓPTERIS  Fronds triangular, longer than broad, four to six inches long, twice pinnatifid. Pinnæ lanceolate, acuminate, the lowest pair deflexed and standing forward; cut into oblong, obtuse segments. Fruit-dots near the margin.  Compared with the broad beech fern this is the more northern species. While usually quite distinct in structure, it sometimes approaches its sister fern rather closely.  It prefers deep woods and shaded banks. Newfoundland to Alaska and southward to the mountains of Virginia. July.  [Illustration: Long Beech Fern. _Phegopteris polypodioides_]  [Illustration: The Long Beech Fern]     THE FRAGRANT FERN  _Aspídium fràgrans. Nephròdium fràgrans_  THELÝPTERIS FRÀGRANS. _Dryópteris fràgrans_  Fronds four to twelve inches high, glandular-aromatic, narrowly lanceolate and twice pinnate or nearly so. Pinnæ oblong-lanceolate, pinnate or deeply pinnatifid. Pinnules toothed or entire nearly covered beneath with the large, thin, imbricated indusia which are orbicular with a narrow sinus, having the margins ragged and sparingly glanduliferous. Stipe short and chaffy.  The fragrant fern grows on high cliffs among the mountains of northern New England. It is reported from scattered stations in northern Maine, from north of the White Mountains and from Sunapee Lake in New Hampshire, and in the Green Mountains south to central Vermont, New Brunswick and to Minnesota. Found also in Alaska and Greenland. This much-coveted fern has a singularly sweet and lasting fragrance, compared by some to strawberries, by others to new-mown hay and sweet brier leaves. We have seen herbarium specimens that were mildly and pleasantly odorous after several years. When growing the fern may be tested \"by its fragrance, its stickiness and its beautiful brown curls.\" Evergreen. Spores ripen the middle of August.  [Illustration: Fragrant Fern. _Aspidium fragrans_ (Mt. Mansfield. Vt.)]     KEY TO THE WOOD FERNS  ASPIDIUM  Fronds pinnate, the pinnæ pinnatifid;     Blade soft and thin, not evergreen;         Lower pinnæ reduced to mere lobes                                                    New York Fern         Lower pinnæ but slightly reduced;             Veins simple......................Massachusetts Fern             Veins forked..............................Marsh Fern      Blade rather thick (subcoreaceous) mostly evergreen;         Fronds small, narrow, glandular, rock species                                                    Fragrant Fern         Fronds large, two or more feet high;             Lower pinnæ short, broadly triangular                                               Crested Shield Fern             Lower pinnæ longer;                 Sori close to the margin....

Although the genus _Polýstichum_ represents the true shield ferns, the wood ferns are also thus designated, as their indusia have nearly the shape of small, roundish shields. The old generic name for them all was _Aspídium_ (meaning shield), first published in 1800. For a long time its chief rival was _Nephròdium_ (kidney-like), 1803. Many modern botanists have preferred the earlier name _Dryópteris_ (1763), meaning oak fern, alluding, perhaps, to its forest-loving habits. THELÝPTERIS, still earlier (1762), may supersede the others.  [Illustration: Marginal Shield Fern.

THELÝPTERIS MARGINÀLIS _Dryópteris marginàlis. Nephròdium marginàle_  Fronds from a few inches to three feet long, ovate-oblong, somewhat leathery, smooth, twice pinnate. Pinnæ lanceolate, acuminate, broadest just above the base. Pinnules oblong, often slightly falcate, entire or toothed. Fruit-dots large, round, close to the margin. Rocky hillsides in rich woods, rather common throughout our area. The heavy rootstock rises slightly above the ground and is clothed at the crown with shaggy, brown scales.
