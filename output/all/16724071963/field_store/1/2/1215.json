They don't do any trade with the whites, and they don't wear gold ornaments. They are wise enough to know that if they were to show much gold about them it would make the whites more eager than ever to come in among their mountains in search of it, so if the Mexican party gathered some up afore they went under, like enough we shall find it.\"  It was with deep satisfaction that they at last caught sight of the mountain with three sharp peaks, but it was four days after they first saw it that they reached a point due south of it. They were now in a wide valley running east and west; to the south a wall of rock rose in a seemingly unbroken line. On the northern side of the valley the hills sloped away, rising one above another, with the peaks of the Sisters visible above them all.  They had left their animals in charge of Boston Joe, in a clump of trees four miles back, as the miners were of opinion that some Indian village might lie somewhere in the neighborhood, and that it would be safer to make their way on foot. One of the many branches of the Gila ran along the center of the valley, but except in deep pools it was now dry.  \"Now we must keep a sharp lookout for marks on the hills,\" Dave said; \"we know we are about right as to the line, but we may have to go two or three miles north or as much south before we get a mark just bearing on that middle peak. Stop,\" he broke off suddenly; \"look up there just beyond the shoulder of that hill; there are some wigwams, sure enough.\"  Tom brought his telescope to bear.  \"Yes, there are about twenty of them, but they never can see us at this distance.\"  \"Don't you make any mistake, young fellow; there aint no saying what an Indian can see and what he can't see. I reckon their eyes is as good as that glass of yours, and I would not guarantee they could not see a rabbit run at this distance. There, get among those rocks at the foot of the cliff; we will make our way along them, hiding as much as we can. I suppose those are horses away there on the hillside to the right of the village; they can't be nothing else.\"  \"Yes, they are horses, Dave.\"  For another half hour they made their way among the rocks, and then Dick exclaimed suddenly:  \"Look, Dave, there is a tree standing by itself at the top of that hill. I believe in another fifty yards it will just be on the line of the peaks.\"  \"I think you are right, Dick, and we have hit the very point at the first try; if it is right, there must be a break in this wall above us.\"     Chapter IX.--The Tree On The Peak.   They hastened on now with their eyes fixed on the tree. A minute later an exclamation broke from Dave, who was ahead, and the others on joining him saw that the great wall of rock had been split as if by an earthquake. The opening was not more than ten yards wide, and on looking up a narrow line of sky appeared between the walls of rock. Looking the other way, they saw that the tree on the hill bore exactly on the middle peak, the Indian village lying just in the same line halfway up the hill.  \"Here is the place, sure enough,\" Dave said; \"there can't be no mistake about it; it is just as the map made it, the tree on the middle peak and the line from them going right into this Canyon. Look, boys, there is a stream comes down here in the wet season, and runs into the one in the middle of the valley. See, I can make out gold sparkling in the sand; that is how it was the place was found; they were prospecting along the valley, and they came upon gold, and traced it up to the mouth of this Canyon.\"  \"Shall we go in now, Dave?\" Dick asked excitedly, for they were still standing among the rocks, which broke off abruptly opposite the mouth of the Canyon, those in front of it evidently having been swept away by the torrents flowing down it.  \"No, don't go a step forward, Dick. Don't let us risk nothing by showing ourselves now. We will make our way back as we came to Boston, and bring up the horses after dark. We have not got a chance to throw away, I can tell you.\"  At night they returned with the horses; two blankets had been cut up, and the feet of the animals muffled.  \"If one of them redskins was to come upon our track and saw the print of a horseshoe, it would be all up with us,\" Zeke said; \"we had best do the same ourselves; the heel of boot would be as ugly a mark as a horseshoe. We must keep well along at the edge of these fallen rocks. Like enough they come down here to fetch water up to their village, and the further we keep away from the stream the better.\"  The moon was half full, which was fortunate, as they would otherwise have had great difficulty in finding the narrow gap in the cliff. Its light, too, enabled them to avoid rocks that had rolled out farther than the rest; once inside the gorge it was pitch-dark, and they had to feel their way along.  In about a hundred yards it began to widen, and they soon found themselves in a narrow valley with perpendicular sides, which seemed to widen farther up. The horses, were at once unloaded.  \"Now do you lie down,\" Dave said. \"I will keep watch at the mouth. I don't think there is any danger; still, we may as well begin as we shall have to go on.\"  \"Well, call me up in a couple of hours, then,\" Zeke said; \"it will begin to get light in about four, and as soon as it does we will cover up the tracks.\"  With the first dawn of light the three miners, taking their blankets, went down to the mouth of the Canyon. The boys accompanied them to watch their operations. It was only in the sand and gravel swept down by the floods from the gorge that any footmarks could be seen; these were first leveled, and then with the blankets the surface of the sand was carefully swept so as to erase all signs of disturbance. Before the sun was up the operation was completed, twenty or thirty yards up the Canyon.  \"That is enough for the present,\" Dave said; \"we are safe from anyone passing. Now, let us have a look round up above.\"  \"They must have been awful careless if they were surprised in here,\" Zeke said; \"half a dozen men ought to hold this place against a hull tribe of redskins.\"  \"That is so,\" Boston Joe agreed, \"but the greasers are mighty bad watchmen, and no doubt they thought they were safe in here. That Indian village could not have been over on the hill opposite then, or it would have been put down on the map.\"  \"Like enough they had been followed,\" Dave said. \"If a redskin had caught sight of them, he might have followed on their trail for weeks, till he found where they were going, and then made off to bring his tribe down on them. It may be that one has been hanging behind us just in the same way.\"  \"It is a very unpleasant idea,\" Tom said.  \"The redskins' ways aint pleasant,\" Dave said. \"Well, let us be moving up. The first thing we have got to look for aint gold. There is no doubt about that being here somewhere. What we have got to look for is if there is any way out of this hole, because it is a regular trap, and if we were caught here we might hold the gorge for a long time, but they would have us at last certain; besides, they could shoot us down from the top.\"  They proceeded a few hundred yards up the valley, and then stopped suddenly on a cleared space of ground. In the center lay a score of skeletons, some separately, some in groups of twos and threes. The remnants of the rags that still hung on them showed that they had been Mexicans. The two lads felt a thrill of horror at this proof of the fate that had befallen their predecessors.  \"Wall,\" Zeke exclaimed, \"that was something like a surprise; there aint no sign they made a fight of it; they were just caught in their sleep, and never even gathered, for resistance. Well, well, what fools men are to be sure. I shouldn't have believed as even Mexicans would have been such fools as to sleep here without putting a guard at the entrance. I reckon the redskins must have come down from above somewhere, and so caught them unawares. Well, let us be moving on.\"     Chapter X.--Watched.   A little higher up the valley narrowed again, the sides came closer and closer, until they closed in abruptly in a rounded precipice, down which in the wet season it was evident that a waterfall leaped from a height above.  \"They didn't come down here,\" Dave said. \"If it were anywhere it was near where the attack was made; the sides slope away a bit there. Now keep your eyes skinned, and see if you can make out any place where a man might climb up or down. Our lives may depend on it.\"  Just as they reached the old encampment Dick said, \"Look, Dave, there is a ledge running up behind that bush; it seems to me that it joins another ledge halfway up. Tom and I are accustomed to climbing; we will go up a bit and see if it goes anywhere.\"  The two lads stopped as they got behind the bush.  \"It looks like a path here, Dave; it has certainly been trodden.\"  The miners came to the spot.  \"You are right,\" Dave said; \"it is a path, sure enough. Animals of some sort come up and down--bears, I should say; maybe goats, and lots of them, like enough; it is the only way they can get down from the top into the valley, and they come down to drink.\"  The ridge was wider than it looked, being, where it started, fully two feet across. The boys at once set off up it; as Dick had supposed, it met another ledge running along halfway up the face of the hill. From below this ledge seemed a mere line, but it was really two feet wide in most places, and even at the narrowest was not less than a foot. Two hundred yards along, another ascent was met with, and after half an hour's climbing they found themselves on a level plateau, from which they could see across to the three peaks. The path was everywhere worn smooth, showing that it had been used for ages by animals of some kind.  \"One would almost think it had been cut by hand,\" Dick said; \"who would have thought from below that there"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11609"],["title","The Golden Canyon (#7)"],["body","such a way as this out of the valley? The best of it is, that it is good enough for the horses to get up as well as us. Well, thank goodness, we have found a back door to that place. It was not a pleasant idea that we might be shut up there with the option of being either shot or starved.\"  \"They would take some time to starve us, Dick; nine horses would last us for a long time.\"  \"Yes, but it would come sooner or later, Tom. Anyhow, I shall feel a great deal more comfortable now I know that there is a way out.\"  \"But the Indians know of it too, Dick, if, as Dave thinks, they came down this way to attack the Mexicans.\"  \"Yes, that is not such a comfortable idea.\"  \"Well, lads, what do you make of it?\" Dave shouted to them as they approached the bottom.  \"We have been right up to the top; the ponies could go anywhere. It is narrow in places, but we have passed many worse on the way; the cliffs never close up, so even at the worst places there is room for them to get along with their loads.\"  \"What is it like at the top?\"  \"Level ground along to the drop of the cliffs, hills behind it to the south.\"  \"Well, it is a comfort there is a way down into the valley. Anyhow, since you have been gone, we have been fossicking about, and there is no doubt about the gold; it is the richest place any of us have ever seed.\"  \"Have you found water, Dave?\"  \"No, that is the one thing bad, we shall have to go out to fetch water, but maybe if we dig in the center of the channel we shall find it. The best place to try will be at the end, right under where the waterfall comes down in winter. There is most always a deep hole in the rock there, where the water and stones and so on have come down and pounded away the bed rock. We found where the gold comes from too. There is a big quartz vein running right up the face of the cliff there; it is just full of gold. You can see it sparkle everywhere. Some day, when the Indians is all wiped out, fellows will bring machinery and powder, and will have one of the richest mines in the world. However, that don't concern us. I reckon there is enough in this gravel under our feet to make a hundred men rich. Now, Boston, what do you think is the best thing to do first?\"  \"See if we can get water, Dave. If we were shut up here without water they would have us in twelve hours, so we have got to get enough for ourselves and the horses to drink if we can, even if we have to fetch up what we want for the gravel. When we have got water, the next job will be to make a cradle; there are plenty of trees here, and we have got our hatchets, and we have brought the zinc screens, so we have got everything we want. I don't say we mightn't pick up a lot in nuggets. Still, I have got a dozen already, making, I should say, over an ounce between them. Still, the others is the real thing to depend on.\"  \"And there is another thing, Dave,\" Zeke put in; \"we must have a watch. We had intended that, but we thought we should have only one place to watch; now we have found this track up the hill we have two.\"  \"That is so, Dave, though it is pretty hard on us having two out of five idle. Still, we have got a lesson there,\" Boston said, pointing to the spot where they had found the skeletons.  \"Aye, aye, it has got to be done,\" Dave said. \"Well, lads, will you take the watch to-day, one above and one at the mouth, and we will set to work at the water hole?\"  \"We will toss up which goes up the hill again, Dick. You spin. Heads; tails it is.\"  \"Then I will choose the mouth here. You go up to the mouth's head.\"  \"Don't you be walking about when you get to the top,\" Dave said. \"Find some place where you can get a clear view all round, and then lie down. Choose a bit of shade, if you can find it. When we knock off work and have had a bit of grub, I will come up and take your place.\"  It was just getting dusk when Dave came up and relieved Dick.  \"Are you going to stay here all night, Dick?\"  \"Yes, we have agreed I shall keep watch here to-night, Boston to-morrow night, and then I go on again. Zeke will take the watch below regular; he sleeps like a dog, and the least noise in the world will wake him, so he will do very well. Can you make out the Indian village across there from here?\"  \"Yes, quite plainly.\"  \"You have not been using your glass, I hope,\" Dave said in alarm.  \"No, I forgot to bring it up with me. But why shouldn't I?\"  \"Because if the sun were to flash on the glass or brasswork, it would be sartin to catch the eye of someone in the village, and if it did you may be sure they would send up to see what it was. Still, if you can make out the village, it will save us the need for keeping watch in the daytime down below. It is from there we have got to expect an attack the most, and if you saw them moving out strong, you could shout down to us and we should be ready for them. At night, in course, we must watch both places, for there may be, for anything we know, a big village half a mile from here, and the attack might come from one way or the other. I expect you would rather work than watch, Dick; so you had better arrange to change places with Tom in the middle of the day, then you can each work half a day. You will find that plenty, I warrant.\"  \"Did you find water, Dave?\"  \"Yes, plenty of it, enough for the horses and the washing too.\"     Chapter XI.--Hard At Work.   Tom took the first watch in the morning. Dick rendered all the assistance he could to the men, who cut down a couple of the trees that stood in the gorge, chopped them into eight-feet lengths, and then with wedges split them into boards, which they smoothed up with an adze. All were accustomed to the work, and by nightfall a deep trough was constructed, resting upon rockers like a cradle.  Next morning the work began; two men threw the gravel and sand into the cradle, the third kept it in motion, while whichever of the boys was off watch brought water in two of the pails from the hole.  The horses were no trouble, finding plenty of coarse grass among the rocks, and only requiring watering night and morning. Thrice a day the contents of the cradle were cleared entirely out, and the gold that had sunk to the bottom collected. Much, of it was in fine dust, but there was also a large number of nuggets, varying in size from a pea to a marble. Each clear-up they obtained on an average eight or nine pounds of gold.  The fourth day Tom had come down from above at twelve o'clock, and found that the men had only just finished the clear-up, and had sat down to have some food.  Having nothing to do, he strolled away to the spot where the Mexicans had been massacred, a short distance away, on some ground at the side of the valley. Some three or four feet above the ground level of the bottom he saw a charred stump of a pole sticking up; he went across to it.  \"I suppose this is where the leader of the party had a tent or rough hut,\" he said.  He was confirmed in the belief by a number of bits of charred wood lying round the pole.  \"It was sort of arbor, I suppose,\" he said to himself.  There were several relics lying about: two boots shriveled by fire, a tin cup flattened by some weight that had fallen on it, a pistol with its stock blackened by fire. He called the men to the spot.  \"Yes, like enough it is as you say, Dick, but it is scarcely worth getting up to look at.\"  \"No, there is not much to look at, Dave, but you have been wondering ever since you came that you had not come upon any of the gold they must have gathered, and you said you didn't believe the Indians had taken it away. Now if this was the hut of the leader of the party, it struck me that it would most likely be kept here, and that it may be buried somewhere under this circle of ashes.\"  \"Tom is right, mates,\" Dave said, \"that is just where the gold would be kept, and there aint much doubt that they would bury it as they got it, so as to prevent anyone from taking any of it till it was divided up. Let us fetch our picks, Boston, and we will soon see if it is here. Let us try round the post first,\" he went on, when the three men fetched their picks; \"it will be either close to the middle of the hut, or else on one side under where he made his bed.\"  The ground was sand, which had been washed up by an, eddy in one of the floods, and they had struck but three or four blows with the pick, when Dave exclaimed:  \"Here is something, boys!\"  They had brought a shovel with them, and throwing aside the sand, they saw a piece of leather.  \"It is a bag,\" Joe said; \"this is their hoard, sure enough.\"  Going down on their hands and knees, they pulled up bag after bag, each about fifty pounds in weight, until they had a pile on the surface of eight bags.  \"Eureka!\" Dave exclaimed, as he lifted the last bag out of the hole. \"They had made something like a pile; no doubt they were a strong party, but even with that they must have been here a couple of months to have got this lot together. Well, Boston,\" and he held out his hand, \"we can go east again; we have struck it rich at last.\"  \"You bet,\" Joe said briefly.  \"How much is it?\" Dick asked.  \"Each of them bags weighs about fifty pounds, Dick.\"  Dick looked incredulous, and stooped to pick up one of the bags, and was astonished at its weight.  \"Fifty pounds if it weighs an ounce, and there are eight of them--four hundred pounds of gold; think of that, lad; that is pretty nigh eighty pounds apiece. I aint good at reckoning, but put it rough at two hundred and fifty dollars a pound, that is somewhere like two hundred thousand dollars each.\"  \"Forty thousand pounds!\" Dick exclaimed; \"it does not seem possible.\"  \"We aint got it to the settlements yet,\" Zeke said quietly; \"them chaps had it, and they lost it. Don't let us figure it up much till we get beyond the sound of the Apache war-whoop.\"  \"Well, I will go on watch at the mouth,\" Dick said, \"and then you can talk things over together.\"  \"Do, Dick; there is a lot more to look after than there was before,"]]]
