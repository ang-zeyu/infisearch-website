She could hear his pants as he moved.  \"No, no,\" she gurgled. \"You left it. It is enough. I can understand\"--she looked bravely up at him--\"I can understand any man leaving it.\"  Then as he moved still nearer her, there was the sound of a sudden swift step in the corridor. The door opened and there stood before them The Other Man, the Husband of The Woman--Edward Dangerfield.  This, of course, is the grand snoopopathic climax, when the author gets all three of them--The Man, The Woman, and The Woman's Husband--in an hotel room at night. But notice what happens.  He stood in the opening of the doorway looking at them, a slight smile upon his lips.  \"Well?\" he said. Then he entered the room and stood for a moment quietly looking into The Man's face.  \"So,\" he said, \"it was you.\" He walked into the room and laid the light coat that he had been carrying over his arm upon the table. He drew a cigar-case from his waistcoat pocket.  \"Try one of these Havanas,\" he said.  Observe the _calm_ of it. This is what the snoopopath loves--no rage, no blustering--calmness, cynicism. He walked over towards the mantelpiece and laid his hat upon it. He set his boot upon the fender.  \"It was cold this evening,\" he said. He walked over to the window and gazed a moment into the dark.  \"This is a nice hotel,\" he said. (This scene is what the author and the reader love; they hate to let it go. They'd willingly keep the man walking up and down for hours saying \"Well!\")  The Man raised his head! \"Yes, it's a good hotel,\" he said. Then he let his head fall again.  This kind of thing goes on until, if possible, the reader is persuaded into thinking that there is nothing going to happen. Then:  \"He turned to The Woman. 'Go in there,' he said, pointing to the bedroom door. Mechanically she obeyed.\" This, by the way, is the first intimation that the reader has that the room in which they were sitting was not a bedroom. The two men were alone. Dangerfield walked over to the chair where he had thrown his coat.  \"I bought this coat in St. Louis last fall,\" he said. His voice was quiet, even passionless. Then from the pocket of the coat he took a revolver and laid it on the table. Marsden watched him without a word.  \"Do you see this pistol?\" said Dangerfield.  Marsden raised his head a moment and let it sink.  Of course the ignorant reader keeps wondering why he doesn't explain. But how can he? What is there to say? He has been found out of his own room at night. The penalty for this in all the snoopopathic stories is death. It is understood that in all the New York hotels the night porters shoot a certain number of men in the corridors every night.  \"When we married,\" said Dangerfield, glancing at the closed door as he spoke, \"I bought this and the mate to it--for her--just the same, with the monogram on the butt--see! And I said to her, 'If things ever go wrong between you and me, there is always this way out.'\"  He lifted the pistol from the table, examining its mechanism. He rose and walked across the room till he stood with his back against the door, the pistol in his hand, its barrel pointing straight at Marsden's heart. Marsden never moved. Then as the two men faced one another thus, looking into one another's eyes, their ears caught a sound from behind the closed door of the inner room--a sharp, hard, metallic sound as if some one in the room within had raised the hammer of a pistol--a jewelled pistol like the one in Dangerfield's hand.  And then--  A loud report, and with a cry, the cry of a woman, one shrill despairing cry--  Or no, hang it--I can't consent to end up a story in that fashion, with the dead woman prone across the bed, the smoking pistol, with a jewel on the hilt, still clasped in her hand--the red blood welling over the white laces of her gown--while the two men gaze down upon her cold face with horror in their eyes. Not a bit. Let's end it like this:  \"A shrill despairing cry--'Ed! Charlie! Come in here quick! Hurry! The steam coil has blown out a plug! You two boys quit talking and come in here, for heaven's sake, and fix it.'\" And, indeed, if the reader will look back he will see there is nothing in the dialogue to preclude it. He was misled, that's all. I merely said that Mrs. Dangerfield had left her husband a few days before. So she had--to do some shopping in New York. She thought it mean of him to follow her. And I never said that Mrs. Dangerfield had any connection whatever with The Woman with whom Marsden was in love. Not at all. He knew her, of course, because he came from Brick City. But she had thought he was in Philadelphia, and naturally she was surprised to see him back in New York. That's why she exclaimed \"Back!\" And as a matter of plain fact, you can't pick up a revolver without its pointing somewhere. No one said he meant to fire it.  In fact, if the reader will glance back at the dialogue--I know he has no time to, but if he does--he will see that, being something of a snoopopath himself, he has invented the whole story.     III. Foreign Fiction in Imported Instalments.  Serge the Superman: A Russian Novel  (Translated, with a hand pump, out of the original Russian)     SPECIAL EDITORIAL NOTE, OR, FIT OF CONVULSIONS INTO    WHICH AN EDITOR FALLS IN INTRODUCING THIS SORT OF    STORY TO HIS READERS. We need offer no apology to    our readers in presenting to them a Russian novel.    There is no doubt that the future in literature lies    with Russia. The names of Tolstoi, of Turgan-something,    and Dostoi-what-is-it are household words in America.    We may say with certainty that Serge the Superman is    the most distinctly Russian thing produced in years.    The Russian view of life is melancholy and fatalistic.    It is dark with the gloom of the great forests of the    Volga, and saddened with the infinite silence of the    Siberian plain. Hence the Russian speech, like the    Russian thought, is direct, terse and almost crude in    its elemental power. All this appears in Serge the    Superman. It is the directest, tersest, crudest thing    we have ever seen. We showed the manuscript to a friend    of ours, a critic, a man who has a greater Command of    the language of criticism than perhaps any two men in    New York to-day. He said at once, \"This is big. It is    a big thing, done by a big man, a man with big ideas,    writing at his very biggest. The whole thing has a    bigness about it that is--\" and here he paused and    thought a moment and added--\"big.\" After this he sat    back in his chair and said, \"big, big, big,\" till we    left him. We next showed the story to an English critic    and he said without hesitation, or with very little,    \"This is really not half bad.\" Last of all we read    the story ourselves and we rose after its perusal--itself    not an easy thing to do--and said, \"Wonderful but    terrible.\" All through our (free) lunch that day we    shuddered.   CHAPTER I  As a child. Serge lived with his father--Ivan Ivanovitch --and his mother--Katrina Katerinavitch. In the house, too were Nitska, the serving maid. Itch, the serving man, and Yump, the cook, his wife.  The house stood on the borders of a Russian town. It was in the heart of Russia. All about it was the great plain with the river running between low banks and over it the dull sky.  Across the plain ran the post road, naked and bare. In the distance one could see a moujik driving a three-horse tarantula, or perhaps Swill, the swine-herd, herding the swine. Far away the road dipped over the horizon and was lost.  \"Where does it go to?\" asked Serge. But no one could tell him.  In the winter there came the great snows and the river was frozen and Serge could walk on it.  On such days Yob, the postman, would come to the door, stamping his feet with the cold as he gave the letters to Itch.  \"It is a cold day,\" Yob would say.  \"It is God's will,\" said Itch. Then he would fetch a glass of Kwas steaming hot from the great stove, built of wood, that stood in the kitchen.  \"Drink, little brother,\" he would say to Yob, and Yob would answer, \"Little Uncle, I drink your health,\" and he would go down the road again, stamping his feet with the cold.  Then later the spring would come and all the plain was bright with flowers and Serge could pick them. Then the rain came and Serge could catch it in a cup. Then the summer came and the great heat and the storms, and Serge could watch the lightning.  \"What is lightning for?\" he would ask of Yump, the cook, as she stood kneading the _mush_, or dough, to make _slab_, or pancake, for the morrow. Yump shook her _knob_, or head, with a look of perplexity on her big _mugg_, or face.  \"It is God's will,\" she said.  Thus Serge grew up a thoughtful child.  At times he would say to his mother, \"Matrinska (little mother), why is the sky blue?\" And she couldn't tell him.  Or at times he would say to his father, \"Boob (Russian for father), what is three times six?\" But his father didn't know.  Each year Serge grew.  Life began to perplex the boy. He couldn't understand it. No one could tell him anything.  Sometimes he would talk with Itch, the serving man.  \"Itch,\" he asked, \"what is morality?\" But Itch didn't know. In his simple life he had never heard of it.  At times people came to the house--Snip, the schoolmaster, who could read and write, and Cinch, the harness maker, who made harness.  Once there came Popoff, the inspector of police, in his blue coat with fur on it. He stood in front of the fire writing down the names of all the people in the house. And when he came to Itch, Serge noticed how Itch trembled and cowered before Popoff, cringing as he brought a three-legged stool and saying, \"Sit"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11504"],["title","Further Foolishness (#3)"],["body"," the fire, little father; it is cold.\" Popoff laughed and said, \"Cold as Siberia, is it not, little brother?\" Then he said, \"Bare me your arm to the elbow, and let me see if our mark is on it still.\" And Itch raised his sleeve to the elbow and Serge saw that there was a mark upon it burnt deep and black.  \"I thought so,\" said Popoff, and he laughed. But Yump, the cook, beat the fire with a stick so that the sparks flew into Popoff's face. \"You are too near the fire, little inspector,\" she said. \"It burns.\"  All that evening Itch sat in the corner of the kitchen, and Serge saw that there were tears on his face.  \"Why does he cry?\" asked Serge.  \"He has been in Siberia,\" said Yump as she poured water into the great iron pot to make soup for the week after the next.  Serge grew more thoughtful each year.  All sorts of things, occurrences of daily life, set him thinking. One day he saw some peasants drowning a tax collector in the river. It made a deep impression on him. He couldn't understand it. There seemed something wrong about it.  \"Why did they drown him?\" he asked of Yump, the cook.  \"He was collecting taxes,\" said Yump, and she threw a handful of cups into the cupboard.  Then one day there was great excitement in the town, and men in uniform went to and fro and all the people stood at the doors talking.  \"What has happened?\" asked Serge.  \"It is Popoff, inspector of police,\" answered Itch. \"They have found him beside the river.\"  \"Is he dead?\" questioned Serge.  Itch pointed reverently to the ground--\"He is there!\" he said.  All that day Serge asked questions. But no one would tell him anything. \"Popoff is dead,\" they said. \"They have found him beside the river with his ribs driven in on his heart.\"  \"Why did they kill him?\" asked Serge.  But no one would say.  So after this Serge was more perplexed than ever.  Every one noticed how thoughtful Serge was.  \"He is a wise boy,\" they said. \"Some day he will be a learned man. He will read and write.\"  \"Defend us!\" exclaimed Itch. \"It is a dangerous thing.\"  One day Liddoff, the priest, came to the house with a great roll of paper in his hand.  \"What is it?\" asked Serge.  \"It is the alphabet,\" said Liddoff.  \"Give it to me,\" said Serge with eagerness.  \"Not all of it,\" said Liddoff gently. \"Here is part of it,\" and he tore off a piece and gave it to the boy.  \"Defend us!\" said Yump, the cook. \"It is not a wise thing,\" and she shook her head as she put a new lump of clay in the wooden stove to make it burn more brightly.  Then everybody knew that Serge was learning the alphabet, and that when he had learned it he was to go to Moscow, to the Teknik, and learn what else there was.  So the days passed and the months. Presently Ivan Ivanovitch said, \"Now he is ready,\" and he took down a bag of rubles that was concealed on a shelf beside the wooden stove in the kitchen and counted them out after the Russian fashion, \"Ten, ten, and yet ten, and still ten, and ten,\" till he could count no further.  \"Protect us!\" said Yump. \"Now he is rich!\" and she poured oil and fat mixed with sand into the bread and beat it with a stick.  \"He must get ready,\" they said. \"He must buy clothes. Soon he will go to Moscow to the Teknik and become a wise man.\"  Now it so happened that there came one day to the door a drosky, or one-horse carriage, and in it was a man and beside him a girl. The man stopped to ask the way from Itch, who pointed down the post road over the plain. But his hand trembled and his knees shook as he showed the way. For the eyes of the man who asked the way were dark with hate and cruel with power. And he wore a uniform and there was brass upon his cap. But Serge looked only at the girl. And there was no hate in her eyes, but only a great burning, and a look that went far beyond the plain, Serge knew not where. And as Serge looked, the girl turned her face and their eyes met, and he knew that he would never forget her. And he saw in her face that she would never forget him. For that is love.  \"Who is that?\" he asked, as he went back again with Itch into the house.  \"It is Kwartz, chief of police,\" said Itch, and his knees still trembled as he spoke.  \"Where is he taking her?\" said Serge.  \"To Moscow, to the prison,\" answered Itch. \"There they will hang her and she will die.\"  \"Who is she?\" asked Serge. \"What has she done?\" and as he spoke he could still see the girl's face, and the look upon it, and a great fire went sweeping through his veins.  \"She is Olga Ileyitch,\" answered Itch, \"She made the bomb that killed Popoff, the inspector, and now they will hang her and she will die.\"  \"Defend us!\" murmured Yump, as she heaped more clay upon the stove.     CHAPTER II  Serge went to Moscow. He entered the Teknik. He became a student. He learned geography from Stoj, the professor, astrography from Fudj, the assistant, together with giliodesy, orgastrophy and other native Russian studies.  All day he worked. His industry was unflagging. His instructors were enthusiastic. \"If he goes on like this,\" they said, \"he will some day know something.\"  \"It is marvellous,\" said one. \"If he continues thus, he will be a professor.\"  \"He is too young,\" said Stoj, shaking his head. \"He has too much hair.\"  \"He sees too well,\" said Fudj. \"Let him wait till his eyes are weaker.\"  But all day as Serge worked he thought. And his thoughts were of Olga Ileyitch, the girl that he had seen with Kwartz, inspector of police. He wondered why she had killed Popoff, the inspector. He wondered if she was dead. There seemed no justice in it.  One day he questioned his professor.  \"Is the law just?\" he said. \"Is it right to kill?\"  But Stoj shook his head, and would not answer.  \"Let us go on with our orgastrophy,\" he said. And he trembled so that the chalk shook in his hand.  So Serge questioned no further, but he thought more deeply still. All the way from the Teknik to the house where he lodged he was thinking. As he climbed the stair to his attic room he was still thinking.  The house in which Serge lived was the house of Madame Vasselitch. It was a tall dark house in a sombre street. There were no trees upon the street and no children played there. And opposite to the house of Madame Vasselitch was a building of stone, with windows barred, that was always silent. In it were no lights, and no one went in or out.  \"What is it?\" Serge asked.  \"It is the house of the dead,\" answered Madame Vasselitch, and she shook her head and would say no more.  The husband of Madame Vasselitch was dead. No one spoke of him. In the house were only students, Most of them were wild fellows, as students are. At night they would sit about the table in the great room drinking Kwas made from sawdust fermented in syrup, or golgol, the Russian absinth, made by dipping a gooseberry in a bucket of soda water. Then they would play cards, laying matches on the table and betting, \"Ten, ten, and yet ten,\" till all the matches were gone. Then they would say, \"There are no more matches; let us dance,\" and they would dance upon the floor, till Madame Vasselitch would come to the room, a candle in her hand, and say, \"Little brothers, it is ten o'clock. Go to bed.\" Then they went to bed. They were wild fellows, as all students are.  But there were two students in the house of Madame Vasselitch who were not wild. They were brothers. They lived in a long room in the basement. It was so low that it was below the street.  The brothers were pale, with long hair. They had deep-set eyes. They had but little money. Madame Vasselitch gave them food. \"Eat, little sons,\" she would say. \"You must not die.\"  The brothers worked all day. They were real students. One brother was Halfoff. He was taller than the other and stronger. The other brother was Kwitoff. He was not so tall as Halfoff and not so strong.  One day Serge went to the room of the brothers. The brothers were at work. Halfoff sat at a table. There was a book in front of him.  \"What is it?\" asked Serge.  \"It is solid geometry,\" said Halfoff, and there was a gleam in his eyes.  \"Why do you study it?\" said Serge.  \"To free Russia,\" said Halfoff.  \"And what book have you?\" said Serge to Kwitoff.  \"Hamblin Smith's _Elementary Trigonometry_,\" said Kwitoff, and he quivered like a leaf.  \"What does it teach?\" asked Serge.  \"Freedom!\" said Kwitoff.  The two brothers looked at one another.  \"Shall we tell him everything?\" said Halfoff.  \"Not yet,\" said Kwitoff. \"Let him learn first. Later he shall know.\"  After that Serge often came to the room of the two brothers.  The two brothers gave him books. \"Read them,\" they said.  \"What are they?\" asked Serge.  \"They are in English,\" said Kwitoff. \"They are forbidden books. They are not allowed in Russia. But in them is truth and freedom.\"  \"Give me one,\" said Serge.  \"Take this,\" said Kwitoff. \"Carry it under your cloak. Let no one see it.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Serge, trembling in spite of himself.  \"It is Caldwell's _Pragmatism_,\" said the brothers.  \"Is it forbidden?\" asked Serge.  The brothers looked at him.  \"It is death to read it,\" they said.  After that Serge came each day and got books from Halfoff and Kwitoff. At night he read them. They fired his brain. All of them were forbidden books. No one in Russia might read them. Serge read Hamblin Smith's _Algebra_. He read it all through from cover to cover feverishly. He read Murray's _Calculus_. It set his brain on fire. \"Can this be true?\" he asked.  The books opened a new world to Serge.  The brothers often watched him as he read.  \"Shall we tell him everything?\" said Halfoff.  \"Not yet.\" said Kwitoff. \"He is not ready.\"  One night Serge went to the room of the two brothers. They were not working at their books. Littered about the room were blacksmith's tools and wires, and pieces of metal lying on the floor. There was a crucible and underneath it a blue fire that burned fiercely. Beside it the brothers worked. Serge could see their faces in the light of the flame.  \"Shall we tell him now?\""]]]
