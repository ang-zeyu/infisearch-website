It was the time of the Jubilee: neither the king nor Madame de Montespan had lost all religious feeling; the wrath of God and the refusal of the sacraments had terrors for them still.  Madame de Montespan left the court after some stormy scenes; the king set out for Flanders.  “Pluck this sin from your heart, Sir,” Bossuet wrote to him; “and not only this sin, but the cause of it; go even to the root. In your triumphant march amongst the people whom you constrain to recognize your might, would you consider yourself secure of a rebel fortress if your enemy still had influence there?  We hear of nothing but the magnificence of your troops, of what they are capable under your leadership!  And as for me, Sir, I think in my secret heart of a war far more important, of a far more difficult victory which God holds out before you.  What would it avail you to be dreaded and victorious without, when you are vanquished and captive within?”  “Pray God for me,”  wrote the bishop at the same time to Marshal Bellefonds, “pray Him to deliver me from the greatest burden man can have to bear, or to quench all that is man in me, that I may act for Him only.  Thank God, I have never yet thought, during the whole course of this business, of my belonging to the world; but that is not all; what is wanted is to be a St.  Ambrose, a true man of God, a man of that other life, a man in whom everything should speak, with whom all his words should be oracles of the Holy Spirit, all his conduct celestial; pray, pray, I do beseech you.”  At the bottom of his soul, and in the innermost sanctuary of his conscience, Bossuet felt his weakness; he saw the apostolic severance from the world, the apostolic zeal and fervor required for the holy crusade he had undertaken.  “Your Majesty has given your promise to God and the world,” he wrote to Louis XIV. in, ignorance of the secret correspondence still kept up between the king and Madame de Montespan. “I have been to see her,” added the prelate.  “I find her pretty calm; she occupies herself a great deal in good works.  I spoke to her as well as to you the words in which God commands us to give Him our whole heart; they caused her to shed many tears; may it please God to fix these truths in the bottom of both your hearts, and accomplish His work, in order that so many tears, so much violence, so many strains that you have put upon yourselves, may not be fruitless.”  The king was on the road back to Versailles; Madame de Montespan was to return thither also, her duties required her to do so, it was said; Bossuet heard of it; he did not for a single instant delude himself as to the emptiness of the king’s promises and of his own hopes.  He determined, however, to visit the king at Luzarches.  Louis XIV. gave him no time to speak.  “Do not say a word to me, sir,” said he, not without blushing, do not say a word; I have given my orders, they will have to be executed.”  Bossuet held his tongue.  “He had tried every thrust; had acted like a pontiff of the earliest times, with a freedom worthy of the earliest ages and the earliest bishops of the Church,” says St. Simon.  He saw the inutility of his efforts; henceforth, prudence and courtly behavior put a seal upon his lips.  It was the time of the great king’s omnipotence and highest splendor, the time when nobody withstood his wishes.  The great Mademoiselle had just attempted to show her independence: tired of not being married, with a curse on the greatness which kept her astrand, she had made up her mind to a love-match.  “Guess it in four, guess it in ten, guess it in a hundred,” wrote Madame de Sevigne to Madame de Coulanges: “you are not near it; well, then, you must be told.  M. de Lauzun is to marry on Sunday at the Louvre, with the king’s permission, mademoiselle .  .  .  mademoiselle de .  ..  mademoiselle, guess the name .  .  .  he is to marry Mademoiselle, my word! upon my word! my sacred word!  Mademoiselle, the great Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle daughter of the late Monsieur, Mademoiselle grand-daughter of Henry IV., Mademoiselle d’Eu, Mademoiselle de Dombes, Mademoiselle de Montpensier, Mademoiselle d’ Orleans, Mademoiselle, cousin-german to the king, Mademoiselle destined to the throne, Mademoiselle, the only match in France who would have been worthy of Monsieur!”  The astonishment was somewhat premature; Mademoiselle did not espouse Lauzun just then, the king broke off the marriage.  “I will make you so great,” he said to Lauzun, “that you shall have no cause to regret what I am taking from you; meanwhile, I make you duke, and peer, and marshal of France.”  “Sir,” broke in Lauzun, insolently, “you have made so many dukes that it is no longer an honor to be one, and as for the baton of marshal of France, your Majesty can give it me when I have earned it by my services.”  He was before long sent to Pignerol, where he passed ten years.  There he met Fouquet, and that mysterious personage called the Iron Mask, whose name has not yet been discovered to a certainty by means of all the most ingenious conjectures. It was only by settling all her property on the Duke of Maine after herself that Mademoiselle purchased Lauzun’s release.  The king had given his posts to the Prince of Marcillac, son of La Rochefoucauld.  He at the same time overwhelmed Marshal Bellefonds with kindnesses.  [Illustration: The Iron Mask----14]  “He sent for him into his study,” says Madame de Sevigne,--and said to him, ‘Marshal, I want to know why you are anxious to leave me.  Is it a devout feeling?  Is it a desire for retirement?  Is it the pressure of your debts?  If the last, I shall be glad to set it right, and enter into the details of your affairs.’  The marshal was sensibly touched by this kindness: ‘Sir,’ said he, ‘it is my debts; I am over head and ears. I cannot see the consequences borne by some of my friends who have assisted me, and whom I cannot pay.’  ‘Well,’ said the king, ‘they must have security for what is owing to them.  I will give you a hundred thousand francs on your house at Versailles, and a patent of retainder (_brevet de retenue_--whereby the emoluments of a post were not lost to the holder’s estate by his death) for four hundred thousand francs, which will serve as a policy of assurance if you should die; that being so, you will stay in my service.’  In truth, one must have a very hard heart not to obey a master who enters with so much kindness into the interests of one of his domestics; accordingly, the marshal made no objection, and here he is in his place again, and loaded with benefits.”  The king entered benevolently into the affairs of a marshal of France; he paid his debts, and the marshal was his domestic; all the court had come to that; the duties which brought servants in proximity to the king’s person were eagerly sought after by the greatest lords.  Bontemps, his chief valet, and Fagon, his physician, as well as his surgeon Marachal, very excellent men, too, were all-powerful amongst the courtiers.  Louis XIV. had possessed the art of making his slightest favors prized; to hold the candlestick at bedtime (_au petit coucher_), to make one in the trips to Marly, to play in the king’s own game, such was the ambition of the most distinguished; the possessors of grand historic castles, of fine houses at Paris, crowded together in attics at Versailles, too happy to obtain a lodging in the palace.  The whole mind of the greatest personages, his favorites at the head, was set upon devising means of pleasing the king; Madame de Montespan had pictures painted in miniature of all the towns he had taken in Holland; they were made into a book which was worth four thousand pistoles, and of which Racine and Boileau wrote the text; people of tact, like M. de Langlee, paid court to the master through those whom he loved.  “M. de Langlee has given Madame de Montespan a dress of the most divine material ever imagined; the fairies did this work in secret, no living soul had any notion of it; and it seemed good to present it as mysteriously as it had been fashioned. Madame de Montespan’s dressmaker brought her the dress she had ordered of him; he had made the body a ridiculous fit; there was shrieking and scolding as you may suppose.  The dressmaker said, all in a tremble, ‘As time presses, madame, see if this other dress that I have here might not suit you for lack of anything else.’  ‘Ah! what material!  Does it come from heaven?  There is none such on earth.’  The body is tried on; it is a picture.  The king comes in.  The dressmaker says, ‘Madame, it is made for you.’  Everybody sees that it is a piece of gallantry; but on whose part?  ‘It is Langl4e,’ says the king; ‘it is Langlee.’  ‘Of course,’ says Madame de Montespan, ‘none but he could have devised such a device; it is Langlee, it is Langlee.’  Everybody repeats, ‘it is Langlee;’ the echoes are agreed and say, ‘it is Langlee;’ and as for me, my child, I tell you, to be in the fashion, ‘it is Langlle.’ ”  [Illustration: Bed-chamber Etiquette----15]  All the style of living at court was in accordance with the magnificence of the king and his courtiers; Colbert was beside himself at the sums the queen lavished on play.  Madame de Montespan lost and won back four millions, in one night at bassette; Mdlle. de Fontanges gave away twenty thousand crowns’ worth of New Year’s gifts; the king had just accomplished the dauphin’s marriage.  “He made immense presents on this occasion; there is certainly no need to despair,” said Madame de Sevigne, “though one does not happen to be his valet; it may happen that, whilst paying one’s court, one will find one’s self underneath what he showers around.  One thing is certain, and that is, that away from him all services go for nothing; it used to be the contrary.”  All the court were of the same opinion as Madame de Sevigne.  A new power was beginning to appear on the horizon, with such modesty and backwardness that none"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],["title","A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#2)"],["body","as yet discern it, least of all could the king.  Madame de Montespan had looked out for some one to take care of and educate her children.  She had thought of Madame Scarron; she considered her clever; she was so herself, “in that unique style which was peculiar to the Mortemarts,” said the Duke of St. Simon; she was fond of conversation; Madame Scarron had a reputation of being rather a blue-stocking; this the king did not like; Madame de Montespan had her way; Madame Scarron took charge of the children secretly and in an isolated house.  She was attentive, careful, sensible.  The king was struck with her devotion to the children intrusted to her.  “She can love,” he said; “it would be a pleasure to be loved by her.”  The confidence of Madame de Montespan went on increasing.  “The person of quality (Madame de Montespan) has no partnership with the person who has a cold (Madame Scarron), for she regards her as the confidential person; the lady who is at the head of all (the queen) does the same; she is, therefore, the soul of this court,” writes Madame de Sevigne in 1680. There were, however, frequent storms; Madame de Montespan was jealous and haughty, and she grew uneasy at the nascent liking she observed in the king for the correct and shrewd judgment, the equable and firm temper, of his children’s governess.  The favor of which she was the object did not come from Madame de Montespan.  The king had made the Parliament legitimatize the Duke of Maine, Mdlle. de Nantes, and the Count of Vexin; they were now formally installed at Versailles.  Louis XIV. often chatted with Madame Scarron.  She had bought the estate of Maintenon out of the king’s bounty.  He made her take the title.  The recollection of Scarron was displeasing to him.  “It is supposed that I am indebted for this present to Madame de Montespan,” she wrote to Madame de St. Geran; “I owe it to my little prince.  The king was amusing himself with him one day, and, being pleased with the manner with which he answered his questions, told him that he was a very sensible little fellow.  ‘I can’t help being,’ said the child, ‘I have by me a lady who is sense itself.’ ‘Go and tell her,’ replied the king, ‘that you will give her this evening a hundred thousand francs for your sugar-plums.’  The mother gets me into trouble with the king, the son makes my peace with him; I am never for two days together in the same situation, and I do not get accustomed to this sort of life, I who thought I could make myself used to anything.”  She often spoke of leaving the court.  “As I tell you everything honestly,” she wrote in 1675 to her confessor, Abbe Gobelin, “I will not tell you that it is to serve God that I should like to leave the place where I am; I believe that I might work out my salvation here and elsewhere, but I see nothing to forbid us from thinking of our repose, and withdrawing from a position that vexes us every moment.  I explained myself badly if you understood me to mean that I am thinking of being a nun; I am too old for a change of condition, and, according to the property I shall have, I shall look out for securing one full of tranquillity.  In the world, all reaction is towards God; in a convent, all reaction is towards the world; there is one great reason; that of age comes next.”  She did not, however, leave the court except to take to the waters the little Duke of Maine, who had become a cripple after a series of violent convulsions.  “Never was anything more agreeable than the surprise which Madame de Maintenon gave the king,” writes Madame de Sdvigne to her daughter.  “He had not expected the Duke of Maine till the next day, when he saw him come walking into his room, and only holding by the hand of his governess; he was transported with joy.  M. do Louvois on her arrival went to call upon Madame de Maintenon; she supped at Madame de Richelieu’s, some kissing her hand, others her gown, and she making fun of them all, if she is not much changed; but they say that she is.”  The king’s pleasure in conversing with the governess became more marked every day; Madame de Montespan frequently burst out into bitter complaints.  “She reproaches me with her kindnesses, with her presents, with those of the king, and has told me that she fed me, and that I am strangling her; you know what the fact is; it is a strange thing that we cannot live together and that we cannot separate.  I love her, and I cannot persuade myself that she hates me.”  They found themselves alone together in one of the court carriages.  “Let us not be duped by such a thing as this,” said Madame de Montespan, rudely; “let us talk as if we had no entanglements between us to arrange; it being understood, of course,” added she, “that we resume our entanglements when we get back.”  “Madame de Maintenon accepted the proposal,” says Madame de Caylus, who tells the story, “and they kept their word to the letter.”  Madame de Maintenon had taken a turn for preaching virtue.  “The king passed two hours in my closet,” she wrote to Madame de St. Geran; “he is the most amiable man in his kingdom.  I spoke to him of Father Bourdaloue.  He listened to me attentively.  Perhaps he is not so far from thinking of his salvation as the court suppose.  He has good sentiments and frequent reactions towards God.”  “The star of Quanto (Madame de Montespan) is paling,” writes Madame de Sevigne to her daughter; “there are tears, natural pets, affected gayeties, poutings--in fact, my dear, all is coming to an end.  People look, observe, imagine, believe that there are to be seen as it were rays of light upon faces which, a month ago, were thought to be unworthy of comparison with others.  If Quanto had hidden her face with her cap at Easter in the year she returned to Paris, she would not be in the agitated state in which she now is.  The spirit, indeed, was willing, but great is human weakness; one likes to make the most of a remnant of beauty.  This is an economy which ruins rather than enriches.”  “Madame de Montespan asks advice of me,” said Madame de Maintenon; “I speak to her of God, and she thinks I have some understanding with the king; I was present yesterday at a very animated conversation between them.  I wondered at the king’s patience, and at the rage of that vain creature.  It all ended with these terrible words: ‘I have told you already, madame; I will not be interfered with.’”  Henceforth Madame de Montespan “interfered with” the king.  He gave the new dauphiness Madame de Maintenon as her mistress of the robes.  “I am told,” writes Madame de Sevigne, “that the king’s conversations do nothing but increase and improve, that they last from six to ten o’clock, that the daughter-in-law goes occasionally to pay them a shortish visit, that they are found each in a big chair, and that, when the visit is over, the talk is resumed.  The lady is no longer accosted without awe and respect, and the ministers pay her the court which the rest do.  No friend was ever so careful and attentive as the king is to her; she makes him acquainted with a perfectly new line of country--I mean the intercourse of friendship and conversation, without chicanery and without constraint; he appears to be charmed with it.”  Discreet and adroit as she was, and artificial without being false, Madame de Maintenon gloried in bringing back the king and the court to the ways of goodness.  “There is nothing so able as irreproachable conduct,” she used to say.  The king often went to see the queen; the latter heaped attentions upon Madame de Maintenon.  “The king never treated me more affectionately than he has since she had his ear,” the poor princess would say.  The dauphiness had just had a son.  The joy at court was excessive.  “The king let anybody who pleased embrace him,”  says the Abbe de Croisy; “he gave everybody his hand to kiss.  Spinola, in the warmth of his zeal, bit his finger; the king began to exclaim. ‘Sir,’ interrupted the other, ‘I ask your Majesty’s pardon; but, if I hadn’t bitten you, you would not have noticed me.’  The lower orders seemed beside themselves, they made bonfires of everything.  The porters and the Swiss burned the poles of the chairs, and even the floorings and wainscots intended for the great gallery.  Bontemps, in wrath, ran and told the king, who burst out laughing and said, ‘Let them be; we will have other floorings.’”  The least clear-sighted were beginning to discern the modest beams of a rising sun.  Madame de Montespan, who had a taste for intellectual things, had not long since recommended Racine and Boileau to the king to write a history of his reign.  They had been appointed historiographers. “When they had done some interesting piece,” says Louis Racine in his Memoires, “they used to go and read it to the king at Madame de Montespan’s.  Madame de Maintenon was generally present at the reading. She, according to Boileau’s account, liked my father better than him, and Madame de Montespan, on the contrary, liked Boileau better than my father, but they always paid their court jointly, without any jealousy between them.  When Madame de Montespan would let fall some rather tart expressions, my father and Boileau, though by no means sharp-sighted, observed that the king, without answering her, looked with a smile at Madame de Maintenon, who was seated opposite to him on a stool, and who finally disappeared all at once from these meetings.  They met her in the gallery, and asked her why she did not come any more to hear their readings.  She answered very coldly, ‘I am no longer admitted to those mysteries.’  As they found a great deal of cleverness in her, they were mortified and astonished at this.  Their astonishment was very much greater, then, when the king, being obliged to keep his bed, sent for them with orders to bring what they had newly written of history, and they saw as they went in Madame de Maintenon sitting in an arm-chair near the king’s pillow, chatting familiarly with his "]]]
