It will possibly make many holidays, week-ends, or isolated days more enjoyable by placing a defined objective before the rambler. Places within an hour or two of London are in the front of the book, so that as one turns over the pages one is taken further and further afield. The brief summary of the interests of each place, and the many illustrations, may help to memorise the impressions obtained.  The first edition of a book of this nature must of necessity be incomplete, and the author is prepared to hear of long lists of places which should have been included, and also to hear criticisms on his choice of those appearing. It is to some extent natural that special familiarity with certain places and certain writers or heroes of the past may distort one's vision, and perhaps induce a choice of subjects which may not seem so comprehensive to some individuals as to others. Future editions will, however, give ample scope for embracing all the good suggestions which may be made.  G.H.    HAM HOUSE AND PETERSHAM   =How to get there.=--Train from Waterloo. L. and S.W. Railway. =Nearest Station.=--Richmond (1-1/4 miles from Petersham Church). =Distance from London.=--10 miles. =Average Time.=--1/2 hour.                      1st      2nd      3rd =Fares.=--Single  1s. 3d.  1s. 0d.  0s. 9d.           Return  2s. 0d.  1s. 6d.  1s. 3d.  =Accommodation Obtainable.=--\"Castle Hotel,\" \"Roebuck Hotel,\"   Richmond. \"Dysart Arms\" at Petersham.  The little church at Petersham is interesting on account of the memorial it contains to the memory of Vancouver, the discoverer, in 1792, of the island bearing his name, on the west coast of the North American continent. It is said that \"the unceasing exertions which Vancouver himself made to complete the gigantic task of surveying 9000 miles of unknown and intricate coasts--a labour chiefly performed in open boats--made an inroad on his constitution from which he never recovered, and, declining gradually, he died in May 1798.\" The church is also the burying-place of the Duchess of Lauderdale, whose residence was Ham House. This fine old Jacobean mansion stands at no great distance from Petersham Church. It was built as a residence for Prince Henry, the eldest son of James I., who, however, died early, the gossips of the time hinting at poison. The house is still said to be haunted by the spirit of the old Duchess of Lauderdale, who lived in the time of Charles II.    WALTON-ON-THAMES (SCOLD'S BRIDLE)   =How to get there.=--Train from Waterloo. L. and S.W. Railway. =Nearest Station.=--Walton. =Distance from London.=--17 miles. =Average Time.=--3/4 hour.                      1st       2nd       3rd =Fares.=--Single  2s. 10d.  1s. 10d.  1s. 5d.

The church contains in a glass case in the vestry a \"scold's bridle.\" This rusty iron contrivance is one of the few specimens of this mediaeval instrument of torture to be seen in this country, and it is certainly the nearest to London.  In Elizabethan times a \"scold\" was looked upon in much the same light as a witch, and this bridle was applied to those women who obtained for themselves the undesirable reputation.

By the Saxons it was called Hereways, and was purchased in 822 by Wilfred, Archbishop of Canterbury. The ancient manor-house, of which no traces now remain, was formerly the residence of the Archbishops of Canterbury, and it was here that Thomas Ã  Becket resided during his banishment from Court. Cardinal Wolsey, who was once Rector of Harrow, resided at Pinner, and is said to have entertained Henry VIII. during his visit to Harrow. The manor was exchanged by Archbishop Cranmer with the king for other lands, and was subsequently given to Sir Edmund Dudley, afterwards Lord North.  At the bottom of the hill, and spreading rapidly in all directions, are quantities of modern houses and villas, but the point of greatest interest in Harrow is the celebrated school, wonderfully situated on the very summit of the hill, with views extending over thirteen counties. Founded in the reign of Queen Elizabeth by John Lyon, a yeoman of the parish, the school has now grown enormously, the oldest portion being that near the church, which was erected three years after the founder's death. In the wainscotting of the famous schoolroom are the carvings cut by many generations of Harrovians, among them being the names of Peel, Byron, Sheridan, the Marquess of Hastings, Lord Normanby, and many others.  The church stands on the extreme summit of the hill, and from the churchyard the view is simply magnificent. In the building are some interesting tombs and brasses, and a monument to John Lyon, the founder of the school.  The grave shown on the opposite page is known as \"Byron's tomb,\" on account of his fondness for the particular spot it occupied in the churchyard, from whence the fascinating view just mentioned can be seen, from the shade of the trees growing on either side.  [Illustration: _Photochrom Co., Ltd._  \"BYRON'S TOMB\" IN HARROW CHURCHYARD.]    HOLWOOD HOUSE, KESTON  THE HOME OF WILLIAM PITT   =How to get there.=--Train from Charing Cross, Cannon Street, and   London Bridge. South-Eastern and Chatham Railway. =Nearest Station.=--Hayes (2 miles from Keston village). About 3   miles from Holwood House. =Distance from London.=--12 miles. =Average Time.=--35 minutes.                      1st      2nd      3rd =Fares.=--Single  2s. 0d.  1s. 3d.  1s. 0-1/2d.           Return  3s. 3d.  2s. 4d.  1s. 10d.  =Accommodation Obtainable.=--\"The Fox Inn,\" \"The George.\" =Alternative Route.=--To Orpington Station by the South-Eastern and   Chatham Railway, about 4 miles distant.  _Visitors are able to pass through the park on a public footpath._  About 3 miles' walk from Hayes Station by a pleasant road over Hayes Common is Holwood House, a stately, classic building, for many years the home of William Pitt, the famous statesman and son of the Earl of Chatham. He owned the estate between 1785 and 1802, and it was during this period that the British camp in the park suffered so severely. The earth-works were occupied by some early British tribe before Caesar crossed the Channel, and the place probably owed its strength to its well-chosen position. Pitt, however, caused these fascinating remains to be levelled to a considerable extent, in order to carry out some of his ideas of landscape gardening. A magnificent tree growing near the house is known as \"Pitt's Oak,\" from the tradition that Pitt was specially fond of spending long periods of quiet reading beneath its overshadowing boughs. Another tree of more interest still stands quite near the public footpath through the park. This is known as \"Wilberforce's Oak,\" and is easily distinguished from the surrounding trees by the stone seat constructed in its shade. The momentous decision which makes this tree so interesting is given in Wilberforce's diary for the year 1788. He writes, \"At length, I well remember after a conversation with Mr. Pitt in the open air at the root of an old tree at Holwood, just above the steep descent into the vale of Keston, I resolved to give notice on a fit occasion in the House of Commons of my intention to bring forward the abolition of the slave-trade.\"  With the exception of Knole Park, Holwood boasts some of the finest beeches in the country. The present house took the place of the one occupied by Pitt in 1825; the architect was Decimus Burton.  [Illustration: WILBERFORCE'S OR \"EMANCIPATION OAK\" IN HOLWOOD PARK, KESTON.]    CHIGWELL, ESSEX   =How to get there.=--Train from Liverpool Street or Fenchurch Street.   Great Eastern Railway. =Nea"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11642"],["title","What to See in England (#1)"],["body","Station.=--Chigwell. =Distance from London.=--12-3/4 miles. =Average Time.=--55 minutes. Quickest train, 31 minutes.                      1st       2nd       3rd =Fares.=--Single  1s. 10d.  1s.  4d.  0s. 11d.           Return  2s.  6d.  1s. 10d.  1s.  4d.  =Accommodation Obtainable.=--\"The King's Head.\"  In 1844 Charles Dickens wrote to Forster: \"Chigwell, my dear fellow, is the greatest place in the world. Name your day for going. Such a delicious old inn facing the church--such a lovely ride--such forest scenery--such an out-of-the-way rural place--such a sexton! I say again, Name your day.\" This is surely sufficient recommendation for any place; and when one knows that the \"delicious old inn\" is still standing, and that the village is as rural and as pretty as when Dickens wrote over sixty years ago, one cannot fail to have a keen desire to see the place. \"The King's Head\" illustrated here is the inn Dickens had in his mind when describing the \"Maypole\" in _Barnaby Rudge_, and the whole of the plot of that work is so wrapped up in Chigwell and its immediate surroundings that one should not visit the village until one has read the story. One may see the panelled \"great room\" upstairs where Mr. Chester met Mr. Geoffrey Haredale. This room has a fine mantelpiece, great carved beams, and beautiful leaded windows. On the ground floor is the cosy bar where the village cronies gathered with Mr. Willett, and one may also see the low room with the small-paned windows against which John Willett flattened his nose looking out on the road on the dark night when the story opens.  Chigwell School, built in 1629, and founded by Archbishop Harsnett, still remains, although there have been several modern additions. Here William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, was educated. (See Index for Jordans and Penn's Chapel at Thakeham.)  Chigwell Church, facing \"The King's Head,\" has a dark avenue of yews leading from the road to the porch. A brass to the memory of Archbishop Harsnett may be seen on the floor of the chancel. The epitaph in Latin was ordered to be so written in the will of the archbishop. Translated, the first portion may be read: \"Here lieth Samuel Harsnett, formerly vicar of this church. First the unworthy Bishop of Chichester, then the more unworthy Bishop of Norwich, at last the very unworthy Archbishop of York.\"  [Illustration: THE KING'S HEAD INN AT CHIGWELL.

Great Eastern   Railway. =Nearest Station.=--Waltham. =Distance from London.=--12-3/4 miles. =Average Time.=--40 minutes. Quickest train, 23 minutes.                      1st      2nd      3rd =Fares.=--Single  2s. 0d.  1s. 6d.  1s. 1d.

Harold II. founded the stately Abbey Church in May 1060. William the Conqueror disputed Harold's claim to the throne and landed in England at Pevensey in 1066. At Waltham Abbey, troubled and anxious, Harold prayed for victory in England's name before the fatal battle of Hastings, where he was slain. William at first refused to give up Harold's body to his mother, Gytha, but he afterwards allowed two monks from Waltham to search for the body of the king. They were unable to find it amongst the nameless dead, but his favourite, Edith the swan-necked, whose eye of affection was not to be deceived, discovered it. His weeping mother buried the disfigured corpse probably about 120 feet from the east end of the old church.  At Waltham is one of the many crosses erected by Edward I. in memory of his first wife, Eleanor of Castile, wherever her body rested on its way to Westminster from Lincoln. At Northampton is another of these famous crosses. When the king asked the Abbot of Cluny to intercede for her soul, he said, \"We loved her tenderly in her lifetime; we do not cease to love her in death.\"  A little way to the left of Waltham Cross, now a gateway to the park of Theobalds, stands Temple Bar, stone for stone intact as it was in the days when traitors' heads were raised above it in Fleet Street, although the original wooden gates have gone. A portion of the richly-carved top of the gate is still in existence in London. Waltham Abbey is probably close to that part of the river Lea where King Alfred defeated the Danes. They had penetrated far up the river when King Alfred diverted the waters of the river from underneath their black vessels and left them high and dry in a wilderness of marsh and forest. The gentle Charles Lamb was very fond of the country all round Waltham Abbey, especially Broxbourne and Amwell.  [Illustration: THE ABBEY GATE AT WALTHAM.  Waltham Abbey was founded in 1060 by Harold II.]    DOWNE  THE HOME OF DARWIN   =How to get there.=--Train from Charing Cross, Cannon Street, or   London Bridge. South-Eastern and Chatham Railway. =Nearest Station.=--Orpington (3-1/2 to 4 miles from Downe). =Distance from London.=--13-3/4 miles. =Average Time.=--35 minutes.                      1st      2nd      3rd =Fares.=--Single  2s. 4d.  1s. 6d.  1s. 2-1/2d.           Return  4s. 0d.  3s. 0d.     ...  =Accommodation Obtainable.=--\"Queen's Head,\" at Downe, facing the   church. Hotels at Farnborough--\"White Lion,\" \"George and   Dragon.\"  The home of the great scientist is still standing in the little village of Downe in Kent. The road to the hamlet is through Farnborough, and the walk takes an hour. Downe is a pleasant place, possessing a large village pond and a small church with a shingled spire. Darwin's home, known as Downe House, was built in the eighteenth century. Its front is of white stucco, relieved by ivy and other creepers. The wing on the west side of the house was added by Darwin shortly after he came to live there. This new portion of the house was used partly to accommodate his library. On the north side is the room used by Darwin as a study, in which he wrote some of his most important works. The garden of the house is sheltered and reposeful, and from the old wall-garden to the south there is a beautiful view over the delightful stretch of country in the direction of Westerham.  The life led by Darwin when at Downe was exceedingly quiet and regular, for he always went to bed at an early hour, and rising at six was enabled to get in a walk and breakfast before commencing work at eight o'clock. At some other time of the day he would manage to get an opportunity for another walk, and part of the evening would be given up to his family and friends who were privileged to enjoy conversation with the great author of _The Origin of Species_. Professor Haeckel, describing a visit to Darwin's home, says, \"There stepped out to meet me from the shady porch ... the great naturalist himself, a tall and venerable figure, with the broad shoulders of an Atlas supporting a world of thought, his Jupiter-like forehead, highly and broadly arched ... and deeply furrowed with the plough of mental labour; his kindly, mild eyes looking forth under the shadow of prominent brows.\"  [Illustration: DOWNE HOUSE AT DOWNE, KENT.  The Home of Charles Darwin.]    EPSOM: ITS RACES AND ITS SALTS   =How to get there.=--From Waterloo, South-Western Railway. From   London Bridge or Victoria, London, Brighton, and South Coast Rly. =Nearest Station.=--Epsom. =Distance from London.=--14 miles. =Average Time.=--3/4 hour.                      1st      2nd      3rd =Fares.=--Single  2s. 3d.  1s. 6d.  1s. 2d.           Return  3s. 0d.  2s. 6d.  2s. 2d.  =Accommodation Obtainable.=--\"King's Head,\" \"Spread Eagle,\" etc.  One must choose any other than a race-day if one wishes to see the charming old town of Epsom at its best. But if, on the other hand, one wishes, to see something of the scene on the race-course depicted in Mr. Frith's famous picture, one gets no suggestion of the great spectacle except on race-days. On these occasions, at the Spring meeting and during Derby week, one has merely to follow the great streams of humanity which converge on the downs from the roads from London and from the railway stations. On ordinary days the wide rolling downs are generally left alone to the health-giving breezes which blow over them. In the town itself there is much to be seen of the seventeenth-century architecture associated with the days of Epsom's fame as a watering-place. The wide portion of the High Street at once attracts one's notice, for with one or two exceptions its whole length is full of the quaintest of buildings with cream walls and mossy tiled roofs. The clock-tower was built in 1848, when it replaced a very simple old watch-house with a curious little tower rising from it. The \"Spread Eagle\" is one of the oldest of the Epsom inns; its irregular front and its position looking up the High Street make it more conspicuous than the \"King's Head,\" an equally old and very interesting hostelry facing the clock-tower. Pepys stayed there in 1667, for in his diary of July 14 of that year he writes, \"To Epsom, by eight o'clock, to the well; where much company. And to the towne to the King's Head; and hear that my Lord Buckhurst and Nelly (Gwynne) are lodged at the next house, and Sir Charles Sedley with them: and keep a merry house.\" This house, next to the \"King's Head,\" is still standing. A little further along the street is the large red-brick building known to-day as Waterloo House. It was built about the year 1680, and was then known as the New Inn. The old banqueting-hall it contains is divided up now, for the building is converted into shops.  Durdans, the residence of Lord Rosebery, is about ten minutes' walk from the High Street. One can see the house and grounds from the narrow lane leading to the downs.  [Illustration: HIGH STREET, EPSOM.  Showing"]]]
