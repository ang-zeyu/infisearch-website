From that day on he gained strength rapidly, but it was a month before he could sit up, and another two weeks before he could stand. And so it happened that it was full two months after he had made his assertion in the old cabin before Rod was in good health again.  One day Minnetaki had a tremendous surprise in store for him. Rod had never seen her look quite so pretty, or quite so timid, as she did on this particular morning.  \"Will you forgive me for--for--keeping something from you, Rod?\" she asked. She did not wait for the boy's reply, but went on. \"When you were so sick, and we thought you might die, I wrote to your mother and we sent the letter down by a special sledge. And--and--oh, Rod, I just can't keep it in any longer, no matter if you do scold me! Your mother has come--and she is at Wabinosh House now!\"  For a moment Rod stood like one struck dumb. Then he found his voice in a series of war-whoops which quickly brought Wabi in, only to see his friend dancing around Minnetaki like one gone crazy.  \"Forgive you!\" he shouted again and again. \"Minnetaki, you're a brick--you certainly are a brick!\"  As soon as Wabi was made acquainted with the cause of Roderick's excitement he also joined in the other's wild rejoicing, and their antics startled half the house of Kenegami. Mukoki shared their joy, and Wabi hugged and kissed his sister until her pretty face was like a wild rose.  \"Hurrah!\" shouted Wabi for the twentieth time. \"That means we start on our hunt for the lost gold-mine within a fortnight!\"  \"It means--\" began Roderick.  \"It means--\" interrupted Minnetaki, \"it means that you're all happy but me--and I'm glad for Rod's sake, and I want to know his mother. But you're all going--and I'm to be left behind!\"  There was no laughter in her voice, and Rod and Wabigoon became suddenly quiet as she turned away.  \"I'm sorry,\" said Wabi. \"But--we can't help it.\"  Mukoki broke the tension.  \"How bright the sun shine!\" he exclaimed. \"Snow an' ice go. Spring--heem here!\"     CHAPTER VII   ON THE TRAIL OF GOLD  And each day thereafter the sun rose earlier, and the day was longer, and the air was warmer; and with the warmth there now came the sweet scents of the budding earth and the myriad sounds of the deep, unseen life of the forests, awakening from its long slumber in its bed of snow. The moose-birds chirped their mating songs and flirted from morning till night in bough and air, and the jays and ravens fluffed themselves in the sun, and the snowbirds, little black and white beauties that were wont to whisk about like so many flashing gems, became fewer and fewer, until they were gone altogether. The poplar buds swelled more and more in their joy, until they split like over-fat peas, and the partridges feasted upon them.  And Mother Bear came out of her winter den, accompanied by her little ones born two months before, and taught them how to pull down the slender saplings for these same buds; and the moose came down from the blizzardy tops of the great ridges, which are called mountains in the North, and where for good reasons they had passed the winter, followed by the wolves, who fed upon their weak and sick. Everywhere there were the rushing torrents of melting snows, the crackle of crumbling ice, the dying frost-cries of rock and earth and tree, and each night the cold, pale glow of the Aurora Borealis crept farther and farther toward the Pole in fading glory.  It was spring, and at Wabinosh House it brought more joy than elsewhere, for there Roderick Drew joined his mother. We have not time here to dwell on the things that happened at the old Hudson Bay Post during the ten days after their first happy reunion--of the love that sprang up between Rod's mother and Minnetaki, and the princess wife of George Newsome, the factor; of the departure of the soldiers whose task of running down Woonga ended with Rod's desperate fight in the cabin, or of the preparations of the gold hunters themselves.  On a certain evening in April, Wabi, Mukoki and Rod had assembled in the latter's room. The next morning they were to start on their long and thrilling adventure into the far North, and on this last night they went carefully over their equipment and plans to see that nothing had been forgotten. That night Rod slept little. For the second time in his life the fever of adventure was running wild in his blood. After the others had gone he studied the precious old map until his eyes grew dim; in the half slumber that came to him afterward his brain worked ceaselessly, and he saw visions of the romantic old cabin again, and the rotting buckskin bag filled with nuggets of gold on the table.  He was up before the stars began fading in the dawn, and in the big dining-room of the Post, in which had gathered the factors and their families for two hundred years, the boys ate their last breakfast with those whom they were about to leave for many weeks, perhaps months. The factor himself was boisterously cheerful in his efforts to keep up the good cheer of Mrs. Drew and the princess mother, and even Minnetaki forced herself to smile and laugh, though her eyes were red, and all knew that she had been crying. Rod was glad when the meal was over and they went out into the chill air of the morning, and down to the edge of the lake, where their big birch-bark canoe was loaded and waiting for their departure, and he was still more relieved when they had bade a last good-by to the two mothers. But Minnetaki came down to the canoe with them, and when Wabi kissed her she burst into tears, and Rod felt a queer thickening in his throat as he took her firm little hand and held it for a moment between both his own.  \"Good-by, Minnetaki,\" he whispered.  He turned and took his position in the middle of the canoe, and with a last shout Wabi shoved off and the canoe sped out into the gloom.  For a long time there was silence, except for the rhythmic dip of the three paddles. Once Minnetaki's voice came to them faintly, and they answered it with a shout. But that was all. After a time Rod said,  \"By George, this saying good-by is the toughest part of the whole business!\"  His words cleared away the feeling of oppression that seemed to have fallen on them.  \"It's always hard for me to leave Minnetaki,\" replied Wabigoon. \"Some day I'm going to take her on a trip with me.\"  \"She'd be a bully fellow!\" cried Rod with enthusiasm.  From the stern of the canoe came a delighted chuckle from Mukoki.  \"She brave--she shoot, she hunt, she be dam' fine!\" he added, and both Rod and Wabi burst out laughing. The young Indian looked at his compass by the light of a match.  \"We'll strike straight across Lake Nipigon instead of following the shore. What do you say, Muky?\" he called back.  The old pathfinder was silent. In surprise Wabi ceased paddling, and repeated his question.  \"Don't you think it is safe?\"  Mukoki wet his hand over the side and held it above his head.  \"Wind in south,\" he said. \"Maybe no get stronger, but--\"  \"If she did,\" added Rod dubiously, noting how heavily laden the canoe was, \"we'd be in a fix, as sure as you live!\"  \"It will take us all of to-day and half of to-morrow to follow the shore,\" urged Wabi, \"while by cutting straight across the lake we can make the other side early this afternoon. Let's risk it!\"  Mukoki grunted something that was a little less than approval, and Rod felt a peculiar sensation shoot through him as the frail birch headed out into the big lake. Their steady strokes sent the canoe through the water at fully four miles an hour, and by the time broad day had come the forest-clad shore at Wabinosh House was only a hazy outline in the distance. The white youth's unspoken fears were dispelled when the sun rose, warm and glorious, over the shimmering lake, driving the chill from the air, and seeming to bring with it the sweet scents of the forests far away. Joyfully he labored at his paddle, the mere exhilaration of the morning filling his arms with the strength of a young giant. Wabi whistled and sang wild snatches of Indian song by turns, Rod joined him with _Yankee Doodle_ and _The Star Spangled Banner_, and even the silent Mukoki gave a whoop now and then to show that he was as happy as they.  One thought filled the minds of all. They were fairly started on that most thrilling of all trails, the trail of gold. In their possession was the secret of a great fortune. Romance, adventure, discovery, awaited them. The big, silent North, mysterious in its age-old desolation, where even the winds seemed to whisper of strange things that had happened countless years before, was just ahead of them. They were about to bury themselves in its secrets, to wrest from it the yellow treasure it guarded, and their blood tingled and leaped excitedly at the thought. What would be revealed to them? What might they not discover? What strange adventures were they destined to encounter in that Unknown World, peopled only by the things of the wild, that stretched trackless and unexplored before them? A hundred thoughts like these fired the brains of the three adventurers, and made their work a play, and every breath they drew one of joy.  The lake was alive with ducks. Huge flocks of big black ducks, mallards, blue bills and whistlers rose about them, and now and then, when an unusually large flock was seen floating upon the water ahead of them, one of the three would take a pot-shot with his rifle. Rod and Mukoki had each killed two, and Wabi three, when the old warrior stopped the fun.  \"No waste too much shooting on ducks,\" he advised. \"Need shells--big game.\"  Several times during the morning the three rested from their exertions, and at noon they ceased paddling for more than an hour while they ate the generous dinner that had been put up for them at Wabinosh House. The farther side of the lake was now "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1167"],["title","A Strange Disappearance (#0)"],["body","STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE  By Anna Katharine Green    OTHER BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR     The House of the Whispering Pines   Miss Hurd.

A NOVEL CASE   “Talking of sudden disappearances the one you mention of Hannah in that Leavenworth case of ours, is not the only remarkable one which has come under my direct notice. Indeed, I know of another that in some respects, at least, surpasses that in points of interest, and if you will promise not to inquire into the real names of the parties concerned, as the affair is a secret, I will relate you my experience regarding it.”  The speaker was Q, the rising young detective, universally acknowledged by us of the force as the most astute man for mysterious and unprecedented cases, then in the bureau, always and of course excepting Mr. Gryce; and such a statement from him could not but arouse our deepest curiosity. Drawing up, then, to the stove around which we were sitting in lazy enjoyment of one of those off-hours so dear to a detective’s heart, we gave with alacrity the required promise; and settling himself back with the satisfied air of a man who has a good story to tell that does not entirely lack certain points redounding to his own credit, he began:  I was one Sunday morning loitering at the ----- Precinct Station, when the door opened and a respectable-looking middle-aged woman came in, whose agitated air at once attracted my attention. Going up to her, I asked her what she wanted.  “A detective,” she replied, glancing cautiously about on the faces of the various men scattered through the room. “I don’t wish anything said about it, but a girl disappeared from our house last night, and”--she stopped here, her emotion seeming to choke her--“and I want some one to look her up,” she went on at last with the most intense emphasis.  “A girl? what kind of a girl; and what house do you mean when you say our house?”  She looked at me keenly before replying. “You are a young man,” said she; “isn’t there some one here more responsible than yourself that I can talk to?”  I shrugged my shoulders and beckoned to Mr. Gryce who was just then passing. She at once seemed to put confidence in him. Drawing him aside, she whispered a few low eager words which I could not hear. He listened nonchalantly for a moment but suddenly made a move which I knew indicated strong and surprised interest, though from his face--but you know what Gryce’s face is. I was about to walk off, convinced he had got hold of something he would prefer to manage himself, when the Superintendent came in.  “Where is Gryce?” asked he; “tell him I want him.”  Mr. Gryce heard him and hastened forward. As he passed me, he whispered, “Take a man and go with this woman; look into matters and send me word if you want me; I will be here for two hours.”  I did not need a second permission. Beckoning to Harris, I reapproached the woman. “Where do you come from,” said I, “I am to go back with you and investigate the affair it seems.”  “Did he say so?” she asked, pointing to Mr. Gryce who now stood with his back to us busily talking with the Superintendent.  I nodded, and she at once moved towards the door. “I come from No.---- Second Avenue: Mr. Blake’s house,” she whispered, uttering a name so well known, I at once understood Mr. Gryce’s movement of sudden interest “A girl--one who sewed for us--disappeared last night in a way to alarm us very much. She was taken from her room--” “Yes,” she cried vehemently, seeing my look of sarcastic incredulity, “taken from her room; she never went of her own accord; and she must be found if I spend every dollar of the pittance I have laid up in the bank against my old age.”  Her manner was so intense, her tone so marked and her words so vehement, I at once and naturally asked if the girl was a relative of hers that she felt her abduction so keenly.  “No,” she replied, “not a relative, but,” she went on, looking every way but in my face, “a very dear friend--a--a--protegee, I think they call it, of mine; I--I--She must be found,” she again reiterated.  We were by this time in the street.  “Nothing must be said about it,” she now whispered, catching me by the arm. “I told him so,” nodding back to the building from which we had just issued, “and he promised secrecy. It can be done without folks knowing anything about it, can’t it?”  “What?” I asked.  “Finding the girl.”  “Well,” said I, “we can tell you better about that when we know a few more of the facts. What is the girl’s name and what makes you think she didn’t go out of the house-door of her own accord?”  “Why, why, everything. She wasn’t the person to do it; then the looks of her room, and--They all got out of the window,” she cried suddenly, “and went away by the side gate into ------ Street.”  “They? Who do you mean by they?”  “Why, whoever they were who carried her off.”  I could not suppress the “bah!” that rose to my lips. Mr. Gryce might have been able to, but I am not Gryce.  “You don’t believe,” said she, “that she was carried off?”  “Well, no,” said I, “not in the sense you mean.”  She gave another nod back to the police station now a block or so distant. “He did’nt seem to doubt it at all.”  I laughed. “Did you tell him you thought she had been taken off in this way?”  “Yes, and he said, ‘Very likely.’ And well he might, for I heard the men talking in her room, and--”  “You heard men talking in her room--when?”  “O, it must have been as late as half-past twelve. I had been asleep and the noise they made whispering, woke me.”  “Wait,” I said, “tell me where her room is, hers and yours.”  “Hers is the third story back, mine the front one on the same floor.”  “Who are you?” I now inquired. “What position do you occupy in Mr. Blake’s house?”  “I am the housekeeper.”  Mr. Blake was a bachelor.  “And you were wakened last night by hearing whispering which seemed to come from this girl’s room.”  “Yes, I at first thought it was the folks next door,--we often hear them when they are unusually noisy,--but soon I became assured it came from her room; and more astonished than I could say,--She is a good girl,”  she broke in, suddenly looking at me with hotly indignant eyes, “a--a--as good a girl as this whole city can show; don’t you dare, any of you, to hint at anything else o--”  “Come, come,” I said soothingly, a little ashamed of my too communicative face, “I haven’t said anything, we will take it for granted she is as good as gold, go on.”  The woman wiped her forehead with a hand that trembled like a leaf. “Where was I?” said she. “O, I heard voices and was surprised and got up and went to her door. The noise I made unlocking my own must have startled her, for all was perfectly quiet when I got there. I waited a moment, then I turned the knob and called her: she did not reply and I called again. Then she came to the door, but did not unlock it. ‘What is it?’ she asked. ‘O,’ said I, ‘I thought I heard talking here and I was frightened,’ ‘It must have been next door,’ said she. I begged pardon and went back to my room. There was no more noise, but when in the morning we broke into her room and found her gone, the window open and signs of distress and struggle around, I knew I had not been mistaken; that there were men with her when I went to her door, and that they had carried her off--”  This time I could not restrain myself.  “Did they drop her out of the window?” I inquired.  “O,” said she, “we are building an extension, and there is a ladder running up to the third floor, and it was by means of that they took her.”  “Indeed! she seems at least to have been a willing victim,” I remarked.  The woman clutched my arm with a grip like iron. “Don’t you believe it,”  gasped she, stopping me in the street where we were. “I tell you if what I say is true, and these burglars or whatever they were, did carry her off, it was an agony to her, an awful, awful thing that will kill her if it has not done so already. You don’t know what you are talking about, you never saw her--”  “Was she pretty,” I asked, hurrying the woman along, for more than one passer-by had turned their heads to look at us. The question seemed in some way to give her a shock.  “Ah, I don’t know,” she muttered; “some might not think so, I always did; it depended upon the way you looked at her.”  For the first time I felt a thrill of anticipation shoot through my veins. Why, I could not say. Her tone was peculiar, and she spoke in a sort of brooding way as though she were weighing something in her own mind; but then her manner had been peculiar throughout. Whatever it was that aroused my suspicion, I determined henceforth to keep a very sharp eye upon her ladyship. Levelling"]]]
