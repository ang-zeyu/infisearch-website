So we chatted as we walked along the clean, hard sand, and looked out at the old North Sea.  How little did Jim know at that moment, as he strode along by my side so full of health and of spirits, that he had reached the extreme summit of his life, and that from that hour all would, in truth, be upon the downward slope!  There was a little haze out to sea;  for it had been very misty in the early morning, though the sun had thinned it.  As we looked seawards we suddenly saw the sail of a small boat break out through the fog, and come bobbing along towards the land.  A single man was seated in the sheets, and she yawed about as she ran, as though he were of two minds whether to beach her or no.  At last, determined it may be by our presence, he made straight for us, and her keel grated upon the shingle at our very feet.  He dropped his sail, sprang out, and pulled her bows up on the beach.  \"Great Britain, I believe?\" said he, turning briskly round and facing us.  He was a man somewhat above middle height, but exceedingly thin. His eyes were piercing and set close together, a long sharp nose jutted out from between them, and beneath them was a bristle of brown moustache as wiry and stiff as a cat's whiskers.  He was well dressed in a suit of brown with brass buttons, and he wore high boots which were all roughened and dulled by the sea water.  His face and hands were so dark that he might have been a Spaniard, but as he raised his hat to us we saw that the upper part of his brow was quite white and that it was from without that he had his swarthiness.  He looked from one to the other of us, and his grey eyes had something in them which I had never seen before.  You could read the question; but there seemed to be a menace at the back of it, as if the answer were a right and not a favour.  \"Great Britain?\" he asked again, with a quick tap of his foot on the shingle.  \"Yes,\" said I, while Jim burst out laughing.  \"England?  Scotland?\"  \"Scotland.  But it's England past yonder trees.\"  \"_Bon!_ I know where I am now.  I've been in a fog without a compass for nearly three days, and I didn't thought I was ever to see land again.\"  He spoke English glibly enough, but with some strange turn of speech from time to time.  \"Where did you come from then?\" asked Jim.  \"I was in a ship that was wrecked,\" said he shortly.  \"What is the town down yonder?\"  \"It is Berwick.\"  \"Ah! well, I must get stronger before I can go further.\"  He turned towards the boat, and as he did so he gave a lurch, and would have fallen had he not caught the prow.  On this he seated himself and looked round with a face that was flushed, and two eyes that blazed like a wild beast's.  \"_Voltigeurs de la Garde_,\" he roared in a voice like a trumpet call, and then again \"_Voltigeurs de la Garde!_\"  He waved his hat above is head, and suddenly pitching forwards upon his face on the sand, he lay all huddled into a little brown heap.  Jim Horscroft and I stood and stared at each other.  The coming of the man had been so strange, and his questions, and now this sudden turn. We took him by a shoulder each and turned him upon his back.  There he lay with his jutting nose and his cat's whiskers, but his lips were bloodless, and his breath would scarce shake a feather.  \"He's dying, Jim!\" I cried.  \"Aye, for want of food and water.  There's not a drop or crumb in the boat.  Maybe there's something in the bag.\"  He sprang and brought out a black leather bag, which with a large blue coat was the only thing in the boat.  It was locked, but Jim had it open in an instant.  It was half full of gold pieces.  Neither of us had ever seen so much before--no, nor a tenth part of it. There must have been hundreds of them, all bright new British sovereigns.  Indeed, so taken up were we that we had forgotten all about their owner until a groan took our thoughts back to him.  His lips were bluer than ever, and his jaw had dropped.  I can see his open mouth now, with its row of white wolfish teeth.  \"My God, he's off!\" cried Jim. \"Here, run to the burn.  Jock, for a hatful of water.  Quick, man, or he's gone!  I'll loosen his things the while.\"  Away I tore, and was back in a minute with as much water as would Stay in my Glengarry.  Jim had pulled open the man's coat and shirt, and we doused the water over him, and forced some between his lips.  It had a good effect; for after a gasp or two he sat up and rubbed his eyes slowly, like a man who is waking from a deep sleep. But neither Jim nor I were looking at his face now, for our eyes were fixed upon his uncovered chest.  There were two deep red puckers in it, one just below the collar bone, and the other about half-way down on the right side.  The skin of his body was extremely white up to the brown line of his neck, and the angry crinkled spots looked the more vivid against it.  From above I could see that there was a corresponding pucker in the back at one place, but not at the other.  Inexperienced as I was, I could tell what that meant. Two bullets had pierced his chest; one had passed through it, and the other had remained inside.  But suddenly he staggered up to his feet, and pulled his shirt to, with a quick suspicious glance at us.  \"What have I been doing?\" he asked.  \"I've been off my head.  Take no notice of anything I may have said.  Have I been shouting?\"  \"You shouted just before you fell.\"  \"What did I shout?\"  I told him, though it bore little meaning to my mind.   He looked sharply at us, and then he shrugged his shoulders.  \"It's the words of a song,\" said he.  \"Well, the question is, What am I to do now?  I didn't thought I was so weak.   Where did you get the water?\"  I pointed towards the burn, and he staggered off to the bank.  There he lay down upon his face, and he drank until I thought he would never have done.  His long skinny neck was outstretched like a horse's, and he made a loud supping noise with his lips.  At last he got up with a long sigh, and wiped his moustache with his sleeve.  \"That's better,\" said he.  \"Have you any food?\"  I had crammed two bits of oat-cake into my pocket when I left home, and these he crushed into his mouth and swallowed.  Then he squared his shoulders, puffed out his chest, and patted his ribs with the flat of his hands.  \"I am sure that I owe you exceedingly well,\" said he.  \"You have been very kind to a stranger.  But I see that you have had occasion to open my bag.\"  \"We hoped that we might find wine or brandy there when you fainted.\"  \"Ah! I have nothing there but just a little--how do you say it?--my savings.  They are not much, but I must live quietly upon them until I find something to do.  Now one could live quietly here, I should say. I could not have come upon a more peaceful place, without perhaps so much as a _gendarme_ nearer than that town.\"  \"You haven't told us yet who you are, where you come from, nor what you have been,\" said Jim bluntly.  The stranger looked him up and down with a critical eye:  \"My word, but you would make a grenadier for a flank company,\" said he. \"As to what you ask, I might take offence at it from other lips; but you have a right to know, since you have received me with so great courtesy. My name is Bonaventure de Lapp.  I am a soldier and a wanderer by trade, and I have come from Dunkirk, as you may see printed upon the boat.\"  \"I thought that you had been shipwrecked!\" said I.  But he looked at me with the straight gaze of an honest man.  \"That is right,\" said he, \"but the ship went from Dunkirk, and this is one of her boats.  The crew got away in the long boat, and she went down so quickly that I had no time to put anything into her.  That was on Monday.\"  \"And to-day's Thursday.  You have been three days without bite or sup.\"  \"It is too long,\" said he.  \"Twice before I have been for two days, but never quite so long as this.  Well, I shall leave my boat here, and see whether I can get lodgings in any of these little grey houses upon the hillsides.  Why is that great fire burning over yonder?\"  \"It is one of our neighbours who has served against the French.   He is rejoicing because peace has been declared.\"  \"Oh, you have a neighbour who has served then!  I am glad; for I, too, have seen a little soldiering here and there.\"  He did not look glad, but he drew his brows down over his keen eyes.  \"You are French, are you not?\" I asked, as we all walked up the hill together, he with his black bag in his hand and his long blue cloak slung over his shoulder.  \"Well, I am of Alsace,\" said he; \"and, you know, they are more German than French.  For myself, I have been in so many lands that I feel at home in all.  I have been a great traveller; and where do you think that I might find a lodging?\"  I can scarcely tell now, on looking back with the great gap of five-and-thirty years between, what impression this singular man had made upon me.  I distrusted him, I think, and yet I was fascinated by him also; for there was something in his bearing, in his look, and his whole fashion of speech which was entirely unlike anything that I had ever seen.  Jim Horscroft was a fine man, and Major Elliott was a brave one, but they both lacked something that this wanderer had.  It was the quick alert look, the flash of the eye, the nameless distinction which is so hard to fix.  And then we had saved him when he lay gasping upon the shingle, and one's heart always softens towards what one has once helped.  \"If you will come with me,\" said I, \"I have little doubt that I can find you a bed for a night or two, and by that time you will be better able to make your own arrangements.\"  He pulled off his hat, and bowed with all the grace imaginable. But Jim Horscroft pulled me by the sleeve, and led me aside.  \"You're mad, Jock,\" he whispered.  \"The fellow's a common adventurer. What do you want to get mixed up with him for?\"  But I was as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11656"],["title","The Great Shadow and Other Napoleonic Tales (#8)"],["body","a man as ever laced his boots, and if you jerked me back it was the finest way of sending me to the front.  \"He's a stranger, and it's our part to look after him,\" said I.  \"You'll be sorry for it,\" Said he.  \"Maybe so.\"  \"If you don't think of yourself, you might think of your cousin.\"  \"Edie can take very good care of herself.\"  \"Well, then, the devil take you, and you may do what you like!\" he cried, in one of his sudden flushes of anger.  Without a word of farewell to either of us, he turned off upon the track that led up towards his father's house.  Bonaventure de Lapp smiled at me as we walked on together.  \"I didn't thought he liked me very much,\" said he.  \"I can see very well that he has made a quarrel with you because you are taking me to your home.  What does he think of me then?  Does he think perhaps that I have stole the gold in my bag, or what is it that he fears?\"  \"Tut, I neither know nor care,\" said I.  \"No stranger shall pass our door without a crust and a bed.\"  With my head cocked and feeling as if I was doing something very fine, instead of being the most egregious fool south of Edinburgh, I marched on down the path with my new acquaintance at my elbow.    CHAPTER VI.   A WANDERING EAGLE.  My father seemed to be much of Jim Horscroft's opinion; for he was not over warm to this new guest and looked him up and down with a very questioning eye.  He set a dish of vinegared herrings before him, however, and I noticed that he looked more askance than ever when my companion ate nine of them, for two were always our portion.  When at last he had finished Bonaventure de Lapp's lids were drooping over his eyes, for I doubt that he had been sleepless as well as foodless for these three days.  It was but a poor room to which I had led him, but he threw himself down upon the couch, wrapped his big blue cloak around him, and was asleep in an instant.  He was a very high and strong snorer, and, as my room was next to his, I had reason to remember that we had a stranger within our gates.  When I came down in the morning, I found that he had been beforehand with me; for he was seated opposite my father at the window-table in the kitchen, their heads almost touching, and a little roll of gold pieces between them.  As I came in my father looked up at me, and I saw a light of greed in his eyes such as I had never seen before.  He caught up the money with an eager clutch and swept it into his pocket.  \"Very good, mister,\" said he; \"the room's yours, and you pay always on the third of the month.\"  \"Ah! and here is my first friend,\" cried de Lapp, holding out his hand to me with a smile which was kindly enough, and yet had that touch of patronage which a man uses when he smiles to his dog.  \"I am myself again now, thanks to my excellent supper and good night's rest.  Ah! it is hunger that takes the courage from a man.  That most, and cold next.\"  \"Aye, that's right,\" said my father; \"I've been out on the moors in a snow-drift for six-and-thirty hours, and ken what it's like.\"  \"I once saw three thousand men starve to death,\" remarked de Lapp, putting out his hands to the fire.  \"Day by day they got thinner and more like apes, and they did come down to the edge of the pontoons where we did keep them, and they howled with rage and pain.   The first few days their howls went over the whole city, but after a week our sentries on the bank could not hear them, so weak they had fallen.\"  \"And they died!\" I exclaimed.  \"They held out a very long time.  Austrian Grenadiers they were, of the corps of Starowitz, fine stout men as big as your friend of yesterday; but when the town fell there were but four hundred alive, and a man could lift them three at a time as if they were little monkeys.  It was a pity.  Ah! my friend, you will do me the honours with madame and with mademoiselle.\"  It was my mother and Edie who had come into the kitchen.  He had not seen them the night before, but now it was all I could do to keep my face as I watched him; for instead of our homely Scottish nod, he bent up his back like a louping trout, and slid his foot, and clapped his hand over his heart in the queerest way.  My mother stared, for she thought he was making fun of her; but Cousin Edie fell into it in an instant, as though it had been a game, and away she went in a great curtsy until I thought she would have had to give it up, and sit down right there in the middle of the kitchen floor.  But no, she up again as light as a piece of fluff, and we all drew up our stools and started on the scones and milk and  porridge.  He had a wonderful way with women, that man.   Now if I were to do it, or Jim Horscroft, it would look as if we were playing the fool, and the girls would have laughed at us; but with him it seemed to go with his style of face and fashion of speech, so that one came at last to look for it: for when he spoke to my mother or Cousin Edie--and he was never backward in speaking--it would always be with a bow and a look as if it would hardly be worth their while to listen to what he had to say, and when they answered he would put on a face as though every word they said was to be treasured up and remembered for ever.  And yet, even while he humbled himself to a woman, there was always a proud sort of look at the back of his eye as if he meant to say that it was only to them that he was so meek, and that he could be stiff enough upon occasion.  As to my mother, it was wonderful the way she softened to him, and in half-an-hour she had told him all about her uncle, who was a surgeon in Carlisle, and the highest of any upon her side of the house.  She spoke to him about my brother Rob's death, which I had never heard her mention to a soul before, and he looked as if the tears were in his eyes over it--he, who had just told us how he had seen three thousand men starved to death!  As to Edie, she did not say much, but she kept shooting little glances at our visitor, and once or twice he looked  very hard at her.  When he had gone to his room after  breakfast, my father pulled out eight golden pounds and laid them on the  table.  \"What think ye of that, Martha?\"  said he.  \"You've sold the twa black tups after all.\"  \"No, but it's a month's pay for board and lodging from Jock's friend, and as much to come every four weeks.\"  But my mother shook her head when  she heard it.  \"Two pounds a week is over much,\" said she; \"and it is not when the poor gentleman is in distress that we should put such a price on his bit food.\"  \"Tut!\" cried my father, \"he can very well afford it, and he with a bag full of gold.  Besides, it's his own proposing.\"  \"No blessing will come from that money,\" said she.  \"Why, woman, he's turned your head wi' his foreign ways of speech!\" cried my father.  \"Aye, and it would be a good thing if Scottish men had a little more of that kindly way,\" she said, and that was the first time in all my life that I had heard her answer him back.  He came down soon and asked me whether I would come out with him. When we were in the sunshine he held out a little cross made of red stones, one of the bonniest things that ever I had set eyes upon.  \"These are rubies,\" said he, \"and I got it at Tudela, in Spain. There were two of them, but I gave the other to a Lithuanian girl. I pray that you will take this as a memory of your exceedingly kindness to me yesterday.  It will fashion into a pin for your cravat.\"  I could but thank him for the present, which was of more value than anything I had ever owned in my life.  \"I am off to the upper muir to count the lambs,\" said I; \"maybe you would care to come up with me and see something of the country?\"  He hesitated for a moment, and then he shook his head.  \"I have some letters,\" he said,  \"which I ought to write as soon as possible.  I think that I will stay at quiet this morning and get them written.\"  All forenoon I was wandering over the links, and you may imagine that my mind was turning all the time upon this strange man whom chance had drifted to our doors.  Where did he gain that style of his, that manner of command, that haughty menacing glint of the eye?  And his experiences to which he referred so lightly, how wonderful the life must have been which had put him in the way of them!  He had been kind to us, and gracious of speech, but still I could not quite shake myself clear of the distrust with which I had regarded him.  Perhaps, after all, Jim Horscroft had been right and I had been wrong about taking him to West Inch.  When I got back he looked as though he had been born and bred in the steading.  He sat in the big wooden-armed ingle-chair, with the black cat on his knee.  His arms were out, and he held a skein of worsted from hand to hand which my mother was busily rolling into a ball.  Cousin Edie was sitting near, and I could see  by her eyes that she had been crying.  \"Hullo, Edie!\" said I, \"what's the trouble?\"  \"Ah! mademoiselle, like all good and true women, has a soft heart,\" said he.  \"I didn't thought it would have moved her, or I should have been silent.  I have been talking of the suffering of some troops of which I knew something when they were crossing the Guadarama mountains in the winter of 1808.  Ah! yes, it was very bad, for they were fine men and fine horses.  It is strange to see men blown by the wind over the precipices, but the ground was so slippery and there was nothing to which they could hold.  So companies all linked arms, and they did better in that fashion; but one artilleryman's hand came off as I held it, for he had had the frost-bite for three days.\"  I stood staring with my mouth open.  \"And the old Grenadiers, too, who were not so active as they used to be, they could not keep up; and yet if they lingered the peasants would catch them and crucify them to the barn doors with their feet up and a fire under their heads, which was a pity for these fine old soldiers. So when they could go no further, it was interesting to see what they would"]]]
