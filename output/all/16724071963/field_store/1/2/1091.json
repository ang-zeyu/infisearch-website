Just as the captain pleases.\" He gave a little shrug of his epauletted shoulders to signify his doubt whether any good could arise from it.  \"No,\" said De Catinat, with a sudden happy thought.  \"I charge them with laying their halberds down while on duty, and with having their uniforms dirty and disarranged.\"  \"That is better,\" answered the sergeant, with the freedom of a privileged veteran.  \"Thunder of God, but you have disgraced the guards! An hour on the wooden horse with a musket at either foot may teach you that halberds were made for a soldier's hand, and not for the king's grass-plot.  Seize them!  Attention!  Right half turn!  March!\"  And away went the little clump of guardsmen with the sergeant in the rear.  The Huguenot had stood in the background, grave and composed, without any sign of exultation, during this sudden reversal of fortune; but when the soldiers were gone, he and the young officer turned warmly upon each other.  \"Amory, I had not hoped to see you!\"  \"Nor I you, uncle.  What, in the name of wonder, brings you to Versailles?\"  \"My wrongs, Amory.  The hand of the wicked is heavy upon us, and whom can we turn to save only the king?\"  The young officer shook his head.  \"The king is at heart a good man,\" said he.  \"But he can only see the world through the glasses which are held before him.  You have nothing to hope from him.\"  \"He spurned me from his presence.\"  \"Did he ask your name?\"  \"He did, and I gave it.\"  The young guardsman whistled.  \"Let us walk to the gate,\" said he. \"By my faith, if my kinsmen are to come and bandy arguments with the king, it may not be long before my company finds itself without its captain.\"  \"The king would not couple us together.  But indeed, nephew, it is strange to me how you can live in this house of Baal and yet bow down to no false gods.\"  \"I keep my belief in my own heart.\"  The older man shook his head gravely.  \"Your ways lie along a very narrow path,\" said he, \"with temptation and danger ever at your feet.  It is hard for you to walk with the Lord, Amory, and yet go hand in hand with the persecutors of His people.\"  \"Tut, uncle!\" said the young man impatiently.  \"I am a soldier of the king's, and I am willing to let the black gown and the white surplice settle these matters between them.  Let me live in honour and die in my duty, and I am content to wait to know the rest.\"  \"Content, too, to live in palaces, and eat from fine linen,\" said the Huguenot bitterly, \"when the hands of the wicked are heavy upon your kinsfolk, and there is a breaking of phials, and a pouring forth of tribulation, and a wailing and a weeping throughout the land.\"  \"What is amiss, then?\" asked the young soldier, who was somewhat mystified by the scriptural language in use among the French Calvinists of the day.  \"Twenty men of Moab have been quartered upon me, with one Dalbert, their captain, who has long been a scourge to Israel.\"  \"Captain Claude Dalbert, of the Languedoc Dragoons?  I have already some small score to settle with him.\"  \"Ay, and the scattered remnant has also a score against this murderous dog and self-seeking Ziphite.\"  \"What has he done, then?\"  \"His men are over my house like moths in a cloth bale.  No place is free from them.  He sits in the room which should be mine, his great boots on my Spanish leather chairs, his pipe in his mouth, his wine-pot at his elbow, and his talk a hissing and an abomination.  He has beaten old Pierre of the warehouse.\"  \"Ha!\"  \"And thrust me into the cellar.\"  \"Ha!\"  \"Because I have dragged him back when in his drunken love he would have thrown his arms about your cousin Adele.\"  \"Oh!\"  The young man's colour had been rising and his brows knitted at each successive charge, but at this last his anger boiled over, and he hurried forward with fury in his face, dragging his elderly companion by the elbow.  They had been passing through one of those winding paths, bordered by high hedges, which thinned away every here and there to give a glimpse of some prowling faun or weary nymph who slumbered in marble amid the foliage.  The few courtiers who met them gazed with surprise at so ill-assorted a pair of companions.  But the young soldier was too full of his own plans to waste a thought upon their speculations.  Still hurrying on, he followed a crescent path which led past a dozen stone dolphins shooting water out of their mouths over a group of Tritons, and so through an avenue of great trees which looked as if they had grown there for centuries, and yet had in truth been carried over that very year by incredible labour from St. Germain and Fontainebleau.  Beyond this point a small gate led out of the grounds, and it was through it that the two passed, the elder man puffing and panting with this unusual haste.  \"How did you come, uncle?\"  \"In a caleche.\"  \"Where is it?\"  \"That is it, beyond the auberge.\"  \"Come, let us make for it.\"  \"And you, Amory, are you coming?\"  \"My faith, it is time that I came, from what you tell me.  There is room for a man with a sword at his side in this establishment of yours.\"  \"But what would you do?\"  \"I would have a word with this Captain Dalbert.\"  \"Then I have wronged you, nephew, when I said even now that you were not whole-hearted towards Israel.\"  \"I know not about Israel,\" cried De Catinat impatiently.  \"I only know that if my Adele chose to worship the thunder like an Abenaqui squaw, or turned her innocent prayers to the Mitche Manitou, I should like to set eyes upon the man who would dare to lay a hand upon her.  Ha, here comes our caleche! Whip up, driver, and five livres to you if you pass the gate of the Invalides within the hour.\"  It was no light matter to drive fast in an age of springless carriages and deeply rutted roads, but the driver lashed at his two rough unclipped horses, and the caleche jolted and clattered upon its way.  As they sped on, with the road-side trees dancing past the narrow windows, and the white dust streaming behind them, the guardsman drummed his fingers upon his knees, and fidgeted in his seat with impatience, shooting an occasional question across at his grim companion.  \"When was all this, then?\"  \"It was yesterday night.\"  \"And where is Adele now?\"  \"She is at home.\"  \"And this Dalbert?\"  \"Oh, he is there also!\"  \"What! you have left her in his power while you came away to Versailles?\"  \"She is locked in her room.\"  \"Pah! what is a lock?\"  The young man raved with his hands in the air at the thought of his own impotence.  \"And Pierre is there?\"  \"He is useless.\"  \"And Amos Green.\"  \"Ah, that is better.  He is a man, by the look of him.\"  \"His mother was one of our own folk from Staten Island, near Manhattan. She was one of those scattered lambs who fled early before the wolves, when first it was seen that the king's hand waxed heavy upon Israel. He speaks French, and yet he is neither French to the eye, nor are his ways like our ways.\"  \"He has chosen an evil time for his visit.\"  \"Some wise purpose may lie hid in it.\"  \"And you have left him in the house?\"  \"Yes; he was sat with this Dalbert, smoking with him, and telling him strange tales.\"  \"What guard could he be?  He is a stranger in a strange land.  You did ill to leave Adele thus, uncle.\"  \"She is in God's hands, Amory.\"  \"I trust so.  Oh, I am on fire to be there!\"  He thrust his head through the cloud of dust which rose from the wheels, and craned his neck to look upon the long curving river and broad-spread city, which was already visible before them, half hid by a thin blue haze, through which shot the double tower of Notre Dame, with the high spire of St. Jacques and a forest of other steeples and minarets, the monuments of eight hundred years of devotion.  Soon, as the road curved down to the river-bank, the city wall grew nearer and nearer, until they had passed the southern gate, and were rattling over the stony causeway, leaving the broad Luxembourg upon their right, and Colbert's last work, the Invalides, upon their left.  A sharp turn brought them on to the river quays, and crossing over the Pont Neuf, they skirted the stately Louvre, and plunged into the labyrinth of narrow but important streets which extended to the northward.  The young officer had his head still thrust out of the window, but his view was obscured by a broad gilded carriage which lumbered heavily along in front of them.  As the road broadened, however, it swerved to one side, and he was able to catch a glimpse of the house to which they were making.  It was surrounded on every side by an immense crowd.

Men blood-lusting like a lot of tigers!  Horrible they are indeed. But my experiences in the war zone render them no longer incomprehensible. For, while over there, in my own blood I felt the same raging beasts. Over there, in my own soul I knew the shattering of my most cherished principles.  It is not an unique experience. Whoever has been drawn into the center of the conflict has found himself swept by passions of whose presence and power he had never dreamed.  For example: I was a pacifist bred in the bone. Yet, caught in Paris at the outbreak of the war, my convictions underwent a rapid crumbling before the rising tide of French national feeling. The American Legion exercised a growing fascination over me. A little longer, and I might have been marching out to the music of the Marseillaise, dedicated to the killing of the Germans. Two weeks later I fell under the spell of the self-same Germans. That long gray column swinging on through Liege so mesmerized me that my natural revulsion against slaughter was changed to actual admiration.  Had an officer right then thrust a musket into my hand, I could have mechanically fallen into step and fared forth to the killing of the French. Such an experience makes one chary about dispensing counsels of perfection to those fighting in the vortex of the world-storm. Whenever I begin to get shocked at the black crimes of the belligerents, my own collapse lies there to accuse me.  It is in the spirit of a non-partisan, then, that this chronicle of adventure in those crucial days of the early war is written. It is a welter of experiences and reactions which the future may use as another first-hand document in casting up its own conclusions. There is no careful culling out of just those episodes which support a particular theory, such as the total and complete depravity of the German race.  Despite my British ancestry, the record tries to be impartial-- without pro- or anti-German squint. If the reader had been in my skin, zigzagging his way through five different armies, the things which I saw are precisely the ones which he would have seen. So I am not to blame whether these episodes damn the Germans or bless them. Some do, and some don't. What one ran into was largely a matter of luck.  For example: In Brussels on September 27, 1914, I fell in with a lieutenant of the British army. With an American passport he had made his way into the city through the German lines. We both desired to see Louvain, but all passage thereto was for the moment forbidden. Starting out on the main road, however, sentry after sentry passed us along until we were halted near staff headquarters, a few miles out of the city, and taken before the commandant. We informed him of our overweening desire to view the ruins of Louvain. He explained, as sarcastically as he could, that war was not a social diversion, and bade us make a quick return to Brussels, swerving neither to the right nor left as we went.  As we were plodding wearily back, temptation suddenly loomed up on our right in the shape of a great gas-bag which we at first took to be a Zeppelin. It proved to be a stationary balloon which was acting as the eye of the artillery. It was signaling the range to the German gunners beneath, who were pounding away at the Belgians. In our excitement over the spectacle, we went plunging across fields until we gained a good view of the great swaying thing, tugging away at the slender filament of rope which bound it to the earth.  Sinking down into the grass, we were so intent upon the sharp electric signaling as to be oblivious to aught else, until a voice rang a harsh challenge from behind. Jumping to our feet, we faced a squad of German soldiers and an officer who said:  \"What are you doing here?\"  \"Came out to see the big balloon,\" we somewhat naively informed him.  \"Very good!\" he said. And then, quite as if he were rewarding our manifest zeal for exploration, he added, \"Come along with me and you can see the big commandant, too.\"  Three soldiers ahead and three behind, we were escorted down the railroad track in silence until we began to pass some cars filled with the recently wounded in a fearfully shot-to-pieces state. Some one mumbled \"Englishmen!\" and the whole crowd, bandaged and bleeding as they were, rose to the occasion and greeted us with derisive shouts.  \"Put the blackguards to work,\" growled one.  \"No! Kill the damn spies!\" shouted another, as he pulled himself out of the straw, \"kill them!\"  A huge fellow almost wild from his wounds bellowed out: \"Why don't you stick your bayonet into the cursed Englishmen?\" No doubt it would have eased his pain a bit to see us getting a taste of the same thing he was suffering.  Our officer, as if to make concessions to this hue and cry, growled harshly: \"Don't look around! Damn you! and take your hands out of your pockets!\"  We heaved sighs of relief as we left this place of pain and hate behind. But a new terror took hold of us as a turn in the track brought our destination into view. It was the staff headquarters in which, two hours before, the commandant had ordered us to make direct return to Brussels.  \"Wait here,\" said the officer as he walked inside.  We stood there trying to appear unconcerned while we cursed the exploring bent in our constitutions, and mentally composed farewell letters to the folks at home.  But luck does sometimes light upon the banners of the daring. It seems that in the two hours since we had left headquarters a complete change had been made in the staff. At any rate, an officer whom we had not seen before came out and addressed us in English. We told him that we were Americans.  \"Well, let's see what you know about New York,\" he said.  We displayed an intensive knowledge of Coney Island and the Great White Way, which he deemed satisfactory.  \"Nothing like them in Europe!\" he assured us. \"I did enjoy those ten years in America. I would do anything I could for one of you fellows.\"  He backed this up by straightway ordering our release, and authenticated his claim to American residence by his last shot:  \"Now boys, beat it back to Brussels.\"  We stood not on the order of our beating, but beat at once.  One may pick out of such an experience precisely what one wishes to pick out: the imbecile hatred in the Teuton--the perfidy of the British--the efficiency or the blundering of the German--or perchance the foolhardiness of the American, just as his nationalistic bias leads him.  So, from the narratives in this book, one may select just the material which supports his theory as to the merits or demerits of any nation. To myself, out of these insights into the Great Calamity, there has come re-enforcement to my belief in the essential greatness of the human stuff in all nations. Along with this goes a faith that in the New Internationalism mankind will lay low the military Frankenstein that he has created, and realize the triumphant brotherhood of all human souls.      Part I The Spy-Hunters Of Belgium     Chapter I  A Little German Surprise Party    \"Two days and the French will be here! Three days at the outside, and not an ugly Boche left. Just mark my word!\"  This the patriarchal gentleman in the Hotel Metropole whispered to me about a month after the Germans had captured Brussels. They had taken away his responsibilities as President of the Belgian Red Cross, so that now he had naught to do but to sit upon the lobby divan, of which he covered much, being of extensive girth. But no more extensive than his heart, from which radiated a genial glow of benevolence to all--all except the invaders, the sight or mention of whom put harshness in his face and anger in his voice.  \"Scabbard-rattler!\" he mumbled derisively, as an officer approached. \"Clicks his spurs to get attention! Wants you to look at him. Don't you do it. I never do.\" He closed his eyes tightly, as if in sleep.  Oftentimes he did not need to feign his slumber. But sinking slowly down into unconsciousness his native gentleness would return and a smile would rest upon his lips; I doubt not that in his dreams the Green-Gray troops of Despotism were ridden down by the Blue and Red Republicans of France.  Once even he hummed a snatch of the Marseillaise. An extra loud blast from the distant cannonading stirred him from his reverie. \"Ah ha!\" he exclaimed, clasping my arm, the artillery--\"it's getting nearer all the time. They are driving back the Boches, eh? We'll be free to-morrow, certain. Then we'll celebrate together in my country- home.\"  Walking over to the door, he peered down the street as if he already expected to catch a glint of the vanguard of the Blue and Red. Twice he did this and returned with confidence unshaken. \"Mark my word,\" he reiterated; \"three days at the"]]]
