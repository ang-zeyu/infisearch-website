Nobody, I say, not even our mayor, who is a very good mayor, but who cannot help the poor, feed the hungry, and give bread and work to hands willing to work. Who is able to do that, and who does it? Who in Berlin is the rich, the good man, who gives work to all, and in his large and celebrated mills procures us food and wages? Who is it?\"  \"Gotzkowsky, our father Gotzkowsky!\" cried the crowd unanimously.  Balthazar waved his hat joyfully in the air. \"Therefore, say I, long live Gotzkowsky our father!\" cried he with stentorian voice. And loud shouts and cheers followed this appeal. Men and women surrounded Gotzkowsky and offered him their hand, and thanked him with those simple and plain words which never fail to reach the heart, because they come from the heart. All hailed him as friend and father, benefactor and master. Gotzkowsky stood in their midst, proud and erect. A deep emotion was evident in his noble features, and he raised his beaming, radiant face to heaven, thanking God in the humbleness of his heart for the proud joy of this hour.  \"Long live Gotzkowsky, our father!\" reiterated the happy multitude.  He lowered his eyes, and glanced with friendly looks at the cheerful assemblage.  \"Thank you, my children,\" said he, \"but I beg you not to overrate my merits. You are of as much service to me as I am to you. He who gives work is nothing without the worker; the one has need of the other, to increase and thrive. Of what avail would my looms and my money be if I had not your industrious hands and your good will to serve me? Money alone will not do it, but the good will and love of the workmen carry the day. I thank you all for your good will and your love; but above all,\" continued he, turning to Bertram, \"above all things I must thank you, my friend. You have stood by me and helped me bravely, and it is full time that I should try to reward you. Children, one more surprise have I in reserve for you to-day. I appoint Mr. Bertram my partner and sole director of the silk factory.\" \"That's right, that's noble!\" cried the workmen.  Bertram said nothing. He only turned his eyes, clouded with tears, toward Gotzkowsky, and the latter read in his looks his deep emotion and affectionate gratitude.  \"My son,\" said he, opening his arms.  \"My father, oh my dear, noble father,\" cried the young man, throwing himself, with streaming eyes, on Gotzkowsky's breast. The workmen stood round, deeply moved, and in silence; and in their hearts they sent up quiet prayers to God on high for their employer. At last Gotzkowsky raised himself from Bertram's arms and sought his daughter with his eyes. She was still sitting, silent and pensive, at the table, and did not appear to have observed what was going on around her. A light cloud crossed his brow as he took Bertram's hand and approached Elise.  \"Well, Elise, have you no word of congratulation for him?\"  She shuddered, as if awaking from a dream. \"Oh,\" said she, \"my good brother Bertram knows that I rejoice in his fortune.\"  \"Brother! still brother?\" murmured Gotzkowsky impatiently.  \"And why should she not give me that sweet name?\" asked Bertram, quickly. \"Have you not often called me son, and allowed me to call you father?\"  \"Oh, I would like indeed to be your father, my son, without Elise's having to call you brother. But we will speak of this another time,\" said he, interrupting himself; and turning to his workmen, continued: \"Come, let us be merry, and of good cheer. Who knows how long Heaven will grant us sunshine? Come, you young folks, I have caused a target to be set up in the court. Let us go there. He who makes the best shot shall get a new coat. Come, bride Greta, take my arm; I will be your groomsman to-day. Bertram, you and Elise follow us. Now, music, strike up a song for the bride.\"  Gotzkowsky offered his arm to the bride and led her out. Cheerfully the motley crowd followed him, and soon there was heard in the distance their happy laughter and the merry sound of the music.         *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER III.  BROTHER AND SISTER.   Elise did not follow the joyous multitude. She still sat musing, unaware that Bertram was standing opposite to her, considering her attentively. At last he ventured to pronounce her name softly. She looked up at him with perfect composure.  \"You do not go with them, Elise?\" asked he. \"Do you not take any part in the general rejoicing?\"  She tried to smile. \"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I am glad to see how much these good people love my father. And he deserves it too. The welfare of his workmen is his only thought, and the only fame for which he strives.\"  \"You are too modest in your estimate of your father, Elise,\" cried Bertram. \"Gotzkowsky's fame extends far beyond the walls of this town. All Germany, yes, even Holland and England, are familiar with his name, and the Prussian merchant is as much a hero on \"'Change' as the Prussian king is on the battle-field.\"  \"Only my father's victories are less bloody,\" said Elise, smiling.  A pause ensued. Both felt anxious and embarrassed, and neither dared to break the silence. It was the first time, since Bertram's return from his grand tour, that she had found herself in his presence without witnesses, for she had carefully avoided being alone with him. This had not escaped Bertram's notice, and he had therefore determined to take advantage of the present opportunity to have his fate decided. But yet he did not venture to speak, and the words died away on his lips as he remarked her silent, indifferent composure. As he contemplated her, memories of former days rose up before him. He saw her as, half child, half maiden, she clung trustingly and affectionately to his side, and with charming blushes listened to the teasing jokes of her father. Then her whole soul lay open and clear before him; then she disclosed to him the entire treasure of her pure, full heart, and all the fanciful and dreamy thoughts of her young virgin soul were perceptible; then he had participated in her joys, her little sorrows, every feeling which agitated her breast.  And now, why was it all so different?  A deep, painful melancholy took possession of him, and made him overcome his fear of her decision. He sat down resolutely at her side, and took her hand.  \"Elise,\" said he, \"do you still remember what you said to me three years ago, as I took leave of you?\"  She shook her head and turned her eyes toward him. These eyes were full of tears, and her countenance was agitated with painful emotion.  Bertram continued: \"You then said to me, 'Farewell, and however far you may travel my heart goes with you, and when you return I will be to you the same loving, faithful sister that I now am.' These were your words, Elise; you see that I have preserved them in my memory more faithfully than you, my sister.\"  Elise shuddered slightly. Then she said, with a painfully subdued voice, \"You were so long absent, Bertram, and I was only a child when you left.\"  \"The young woman wishes, then, to recall the words spoken by the child?\"  \"No, Bertram, I will always love you as a sister.\"  Bertram sighed. \"I understand you,\" said he, sadly; \"you wish to erect this sisterly love into an impassable barrier separating me from you, and to pour this cool and unsubstantial affection like a soothing balm upon my sufferings. How little do you know of love, Elise; of that passion which desires every thing, which is satisfied with nothing less than extreme happiness, or, failing that, extreme wretchedness, and will accept no pitiful compromise, no miserable substitute!\"  Elise looked at him firmly, with beaming eyes. She too felt that the decisive hour had come, and that she owed the friend of her youth an open and unreserved explanation.  \"You are mistaken, Bertram,\" said she. \"I know this love of which you speak, and for that very reason, because I know it, I tell you I will always love you as a sister. As a true sister I bid you welcome.\"  She offered him her hand; but as she read in his pale face the agony which tormented his soul, she turned her eyes away and drew her hand back.  \"You are angry with me, Bertram,\" said she, sobbing.  He pressed his hand convulsively to his heart, as if he would suppress a cry of agony, then held it firmly to his eyes, which were scalded by his hot tears. He wrestled with his sufferings, but he wrestled like a hero and a man who would not be subjugated, but is determined to conquer. As his hand glided from his face his eyes were tearless, and nothing was visible in his countenance but an expression of deep earnestness.  \"Well, then,\" said he, recovering himself, \"I accept this sisterly love as a sick man accepts the bitter medicine which he will not cast away lest he commit suicide. I accept you as my sister, but a sister must at least have confidence in her brother; she must not stand before him like a sealed book whose contents he is ignorant of. If I am to be your brother, I demand also the rights of a brother. I demand truth and trust.\"  \"And who says that I will deny you either?\" asked she, quickly.  \"You, yourself, Elise; your whole conduct, your shyness and reserve, the manner in which you avoid me, the intentional coldness with which you meet me. Oh! even at this moment you would withdraw from me, but I will not let you, Elise; I will compel your heart to reveal itself to me. I will move you with my devotion, my tender anxiety, so that the cruel crust will fall from your gentle and pure heart, and you will become again my candid and confiding sister. Oh, Elise, have compassion on me! tell me what secret, mysterious charm has suddenly seized you; what wicked, hurtful demon has suddenly converted this bright ingenuous girl into a pale, sad, serious woman."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12016"],["title","The Merchant of Berlin: An Historical Novel (#4)"],["body","courage and trust me, and let me read as in those happier days.\"  Elise looked at his noble countenance with a deep and painful emotion, and met his inquiring look with unabashed eye.  \"Well, then,\" said she, \"I will trust you, Bertram. I will tell you what I have confided to no human ear. Know, then, that my heart also has felt the pains which affect yours. Know that an ardent, hopeless love burnt my soul.\"  \"A hopeless love?\" asked Bertram.  \"Yes, hopeless,\" said she, firmly; \"for never can I hope for my father's blessing on this love, and never, without it, will I leave my father's house to follow the man I love.\"  \"The man you love!\" cried Bertram, painfully. \"Does he also then love you, and does he know that you love him?\"  She looked at him with astonishment. \"Can one then love without being beloved?\" asked she, with the unconscious pride of a young girl.  \"You are right,\" said Bertram; \"I was a fool to ask this question of you. But why do you doubt your father's consent? Why do you not go confidingly to him and confess your love? But how? Is this love such that it dare not face the light, and must conceal itself from the eyes of your father?\"  \"Yes, Bertram, it is such a love; but yet you must not doubt me, you must not think that this love which conceals itself from the eyes of my father need therefore fear the light of the world. My father would, perhaps, if he knew my secret, declare me unworthy of him; but never, be assured, never would I commit any act unworthy of myself, and for which I would have to blush. It is possible that not only my father but the whole world would pronounce me guilty if it knew my love; but, believe me, that in the consciousness of my rectitude I would have the courage to brave the verdict of the whole world, provided that my own heart acquitted me, and that I am guilty of no other crime than this accidental one, which fate, and not my own will and trespass, imposes on me. Love allows itself neither to be given nor taken, and when it cannot command fortune, it can at least lighten misfortune. More I cannot tell you, my brother, and what is the use of words? Only depend on what I assure you, I will never be faithless to my honor nor my love. You may think,\" continued she, proudly and passionately, \"that my love is a crime, but never that I could love unworthily, or that I could bow my head under the disgrace of a dishonorable love.\"  She looked beautiful in her proud, flashing maidenhood; and Bertram felt, as he looked on her handsome, glowing countenance, that he had never loved her so sincerely, and at the same time so painfully, as at this moment.  \"Elise,\" said he, grasping her hand, \"will you not have entire confidence in your brother? Will you not tell me the name of your lover?\"  She shook her head earnestly. \"Only God and my heart dare know it.\"  \"Elise,\" continued he more urgently, \"shall I tell you what has been whispered in my ear as I returned from a long absence? Shall I tell you what your enemies--for your youth and beauty and your father's wealth have made you enemies--shall I tell you what your enemies whisper to each other with malicious joy?\"  \"No, no!\" said she anxiously, \"how would it help me to know it?\"  Bertram continued inexorably, \"They say that the captive Russian, General Sievers, was welcomed by your father into his house as a friend, and that he overwhelmed the noble prisoner with kind attention.\"  Elise breathed more freely. \"It was with the consent and by the wish of the king that my father was kind to the captive Russian general.\"  \"And was it also by the wish of the king that Gotzkowsky's daughter accepted the homage of the Russian general's adjutant?\"  A slight shudder ran through Elise's whole frame, and her cheeks became crimson.  \"Ah,\" cried Bertram sadly, \"I see you understand me. You will not tell me the name of your lover--let me tell it to you. It is Feodor von Brenda.\"  \"No, no!\" cried Elise, looking around in alarm, and fearful lest some treacherous ear had heard the dangerous secret.  \"Yes,\" said Bertram, \"his name is Feodor von Brenda; he serves as a colonel in the Russian army; he fights against our brothers and our king; he is the enemy of our country.\"  \"You have no pity on me,\" cried Elise, wringing her hands, her eyes streaming with tears. \"You wish to kill me with your cruel words.\"  \"I wish to show to the daughter of the noblest and truest patriot, I wish to point out to the young, inexperienced, credulous maiden, to my sister, that she stands at the edge of an abyss. I wish to open her eyes that she may be aware of the danger which threatens her. I wish to draw her back from this abyss which threatens to engulf her.\"  \"It is too late,\" said Elise, rising proudly and drying her tears. \"I know it all, Bertram; I stand at the edge of this abyss with open eyes, conscious of the danger; but I will not, cannot draw back, for my heart holds me fast.\"  Elise took leave of him with a sad smile, and hurried rapidly down the dark walk which led to the retired and unfrequented parts of the garden.  Bertram looked after her until her pink dress disappeared behind the dark foliage of the hedge.  \"She loves him,\" murmured he, letting his head drop upon his breast, \"it is certain she loves him.\"         *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER IV.  FEODOR VON BRENDA.   Elise directed her hasty steps toward the now retired parts of the garden. She longed to be alone. Her soul, agitated by painful emotions, required silence and solitude, in order to settle down again gently to rest and peace. Slowly, and with bowed head, she traversed the dark, silent garden-walks. Her thoughts wandered afar off, and she sought some little comfort, some relief from the privations of the present, in the sweet and blissful recollections of bygone days.  \"What can keep him?\" asked she of herself; and as she thought of him, her countenance assumed a cheerful, almost happy expression. \"He swore to brave every danger, every difficulty, in order to let me hear from him; and now, alas! ten weeks have passed, and no news, no token, from him. My God! is it possible that in all this long time he could have found no opportunity to write to me?--or perhaps his love has not survived the test of separation and silence.\"  At this thought she stopped, as if stunned, and pressed her hand to her breast. A sharp pain shot through her, and her heart seemed to cease to pulsate. But, in a moment, her countenance brightened up, and she murmured, with a gentle smile, \"Oh, to doubt his love were a greater treason than to love my country's enemy. Oh, no! Feodor, my heart does not doubt you; and notwithstanding your silence, I know that your heart answers mine, and that we are forever and inseparably united.\"  With rapid step and cheerful mind she continued her wandering. She had now arrived at the darkest and most secluded part of the garden. Nothing stirred around her, and there was only heard the rustling of the dark fir-tree moved by the wind, or the melodious note of some bird hidden in the foliage.  The garden, elsewhere so carefully and artistically tended, stretching from the Leipsic Street to the Palisades, which surrounded the town in lieu of a wall at that time, was here overgrown with underwood, protecting the more beautiful parts like a quickset hedge. But this bush was, besides, surrounded by a high wall, running immediately next to the Palisades, and bounding the whole back part of the garden. It was seldom that any one wandered in this neighborhood, and Elise was certain, therefore, that no inquisitive eye could watch her, no treacherous ear listen to her half-whispered words.  She seated herself on a bench under a tree, not far from the wall, and looked up dreamingly and thoughtfully at the patches of blue sky visible through the tree-tops. Her whole soul was sunk in reminiscence. Ah, how often had she sat here, but not alone--not with this painful longing in her heart, but in the fullest contentment of happiness, listening with delighted ear to words spoken by him who sat next to her, holding her hand in his, and gazing on her with looks which made her heart tremble with happiness! Here, on this spot, he had taken leave of her, and since then it had become, as it were, the temple of her recollections, to which she daily made her pilgrimage to offer up her devout, sincere, and ardent prayer of love.  She sat and looked up to heaven, and her ear, dwelling on words which had died away long ago, did not hear sounds which were perceptible on the other side of the wall. It appeared as if some one were striving to climb it, and indeed there could be now seen a hand feeling about, and then a man's figure rising above the wall.  Cautiously spying around, large flashing eyes looked into the garden. One moment the figure rested upon the wall, as if exhausted by the exertion, or listening for some sound. It was a young man, in the garb of a peasant, who sat upon the wall; but the heavy, black mustache little suited this peaceful dress, and his bold air, verging on insolence, seemed to challenge the dangers which surrounded him.  He rested for a moment on the wall, and listened attentively. Then he drew a pistol from his breast, and examined carefully its lock and barrel. He then cocked it, and holding it in one hand, began carefully and noiselessly to descend. With one leap he sprang to the ground; the leaves rustled under his feet, and again he stood motionless in a listening attitude. His glance was as keen and bright as that of an eagle, and it seemed to penetrate the dark foliage. Suddenly a light flashed across his countenance, and a smile of delight played about his lips. He had seen the young girl, who was seated on the bench lost in deep thought, and that he had recognized her was betrayed by his animated expression. Quietly, carefully, he drew nearer, ever and again standing still and listening. Then he stood close behind her at the tree. Again he listens,"]]]
