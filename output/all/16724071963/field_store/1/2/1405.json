One of the king’s pages, overcome by the heat, had fallen asleep, and the lance he carried fell against his helmet, and suddenly caused a loud clash of steel.  “The king shuddered; and then he was observed, rising in his stirrups, to draw his sword, touch his horse with the spur, and make a dash, crying, ‘Forward upon these traitors!  They would deliver me up to the enemy!’ Every one moved hastily aside, but not before some were wounded; it is even said that several were killed, among them a bastard of Polignac. The king’s brother, the Duke of Orleans, happened to be quite close by. ‘Fly, my nephew d’Orleans,’ shouted the Duke of Burgundy: ‘my lord is beside himself.  My God! let some one try and seize him!’  He was so furious that none durst risk it; and he was left to gallop hither and thither, and tire himself in pursuit of first one and then another.  At last, when he was weary and bathed in sweat, his chamberlain, William de Martel, came up behind and threw his arms about him.  He was surrounded, had his sword taken from him, was lifted from his horse, and laid gently on the ground, and then his jacket was unfastened.  His brother and his uncles came up, but his eyes were fixed and recognized nobody, and he did not utter a word.  ‘We must go back to Le Mans,’ said the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy: ‘here is an end of the trip to Brittany.’ On the way they fell in with a wagon drawn by oxen; in this they laid the King of France, having bound him for fear of a renewal of his frenzy, and so took him back, motionless and speechless, to the town.”  It was not a mere fit of delirious fever; it was the beginning of a radical mental derangement, sometimes in abeyance, or at least for some time alleviated, but bursting out again without appreciable reason, and aggravated at every fresh explosion.  Charles VI. had always had a taste for masquerading.  When in 1389 the young queen, Isabel of Bavaria, came to Paris to be married, the king, on the morning of her entry, said to his chamberlain, Sire de Savoisy, “Prithee, take a good horse, and I will mount behind thee; and we will dress so as not to be known and go to see my wife cone in.”  Savoisy did not like it, but the king insisted; and so they went in this guise through the crowd, and got many a blow from the officers’ staves when they attempted to approach too near the procession. In 1393, a year after his first outbreak of madness, the king, during an entertainment at court, conceived the idea of disguising as savages himself and five of his courtiers.  They had been sewn up in a linen skin which defined their whole bodies; and this skin had been covered with a resinous pitch, so as to hold sticking upon it a covering of tow, which made them appear hairy from head to foot.  Thus disguised these savages went dancing into the ball-room; one of those present took up a lighted torch and went up to them; and in a moment several of them were in flames.  It was impossible to get off the fantastic dresses clinging to their bodies.  “Save the king!” shouted one of the poor masquers; but it was not known which was the king.  The Duchess de Berry, his aunt, recognized him, caught hold of him, and wrapped him in her robe, saying, “Do not move; you see your companions are burning.”  And thus he was saved amidst the terror of all present.  When he was conscious of his mad state, he was horrified; he asked pardon for the injury he had done, confessed and received the communion.  Later, when he perceived his malady returning, he would allude to it with tears in his eyes, ask to have his hunting-knife taken away, and say to those about him, “If any of you, by I know not what witchcraft, be guilty of my sufferings, I adjure him, in the name of Jesus Christ, to torment me no more, and to put an end to me forthwith without making me linger so.”  He conceived a horror of Queen Isabel, and, without recognizing her, would say when he saw her, “What woman is this?  What does she want?  Will she never cease her importunities?  Save me from her persecution!”  At first great care was taken of him.  They sent for a skilful doctor from Laon, named William de Harsely, who put him on a regimen from which, for some time, good effects were experienced.  But the doctor was uncomfortable at court; he preferred going back to his little place at Laon, where he soon afterwards died; and eleven years later, in 1405, nobody took any more trouble about the king.  He was fed like a dog, and allowed to fall ravenously upon his food.  For five whole months he had not a change of clothes.  At last some shame was felt for this neglect, and an attempt was made to repair it.  It took a dozen men to overcome the madman’s resistance.  He was washed, shaved, and dressed in fresh clothes.  He became more composed, and began once more to recognize certain persons, amongst others, the former provost of Paris, Juvenal des Ursins, whose visit appeared to give him pleasure, and to whom he said, without well knowing why, “Juvenal, let us not waste our time.”  On his good days he was sometimes brought in to sit at certain councils at which there was a discussion about the diminution of taxes and relief of the people, and he showed symptoms, at intervals, of taking an interest in them.  A fair young Burgundian, Odette de Champdivers, was the only one amongst his many favorites who was at all successful in soothing him during his violent fits.  It was Duke John the Fearless, who had placed her near the king, that she might promote his own influence, and she took advantage of it to further her own fortunes, which, however, did not hinder her from afterwards passing into the service of Charles VII. against the house of Burgundy.  [Illustration: Charles VI. and Odette----71]  For thirty years, from 1392 to 1422, the crown remained on the head of this poor madman, whilst France was a victim to the bloody quarrels of the royal house, to national dismemberment, to licentiousness in morals, to civil anarchy, and to foreign conquest.  When, for the first time, in the forest of Le Mans, the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy saw their nephew in this condition, their first feeling was one of sorrow and disquietude.  The Duke of Burgundy especially, who was accessible to generous and sympathetic emotions, cried out with tears, as he embraced the king, “My lord and nephew, comfort me with just one word!”  But the desires and the hopes of selfish ambition reappeared before long more prominently than these honest effusions of feeling. “All!” said the Duke of Berry, “De Clisson, La Mviere, Noviant, and Vilaine have been haughty and harsh towards me; the time has come when I shall pay them out in the same coin from the same mint.”  The guardianship of the king was withdrawn from his councillors, and transferred to four chamberlains chosen by his uncles.  The two dukes, however, did not immediately lay hands on the government of the kingdom; the constable De Clisson and the late councillors of Charles V. remained in charge of it for some time longer; they had given enduring proofs of capacity and fidelity to the king’s service; and the two dukes did not at first openly attack them, but labored strenuously, nevertheless, to destroy them.  The Duke of Burgundy one day said to Sire de Noviant, “I have been overtaken by a very pressing business, for which I require forthwith thirty thousand crowns; let me have them out of my lord’s treasury; I will restore them at another time.”  Noviant answered respectfully that the council must be spoken to about it.  “I wish none to know of it,” said the duke.  Noviant persisted.  “You will not do me this favor?” rejoined the duke; “you shall rue it before long.”  It was against the constable that the wrath of the princes was chiefly directed. He was the most powerful and the richest.  One day he went, with a single squire behind him, to the Duke of Burgundy’s house; and, “My lord,” said he, “many knights and squires are persecuting me to get the money which is owing to them.  I know not where to find it.  The chancellor and the treasurer refer me to you.  Since it is you and the Duke of Berry who govern, may it please you to give me an answer.”  “Clisson,” said the duke, “you have no occasion to trouble yourself about the state of the kingdom; it will manage very well without your services.  Whence, pray, have you been able to amass so much money?  My lord, my brother of Berry and myself have not so much between us three.  Away from my presence, and let me see you no more!  If I had not a respect for myself, I would have your other eye put out.”  Clisson went out, mounted his horse, returned to his house, set his affairs in order, and departed, with two attendants, to his strong castle of Montlhery.  The two dukes were very sorry that they had not put him under arrest on the spot.  The rupture came to a climax.  Of the king’s four other councillors one escaped in time; two were seized and thrown into prison; the fourth, Bureau de la Riviere was at his castle of Auneau, near Chartres, honored and beloved by all his neighbors.  Everybody urged him to save himself.  “If I were to fly or hide myself,” said he, “I should acknowledge myself guilty of crimes from which I feel myself free.  Here, as elsewhere, I am at the will of God; He gave me all I have, and He can take it away whensoever He pleases.  I served King Charles of blessed memory, and also the king, his son; and they recompensed me handsomely for my services.  I will abide the judgment of the parliament of Paris touching what I have done according to my king’s commands as to the affairs of the realm.”  He was told that the people sent to look for him were hard by, and was asked, “Shall we open to them?”  “Why not?” was his reply.  He himself went to meet them, and received them with a courtesy which they returned.  He was then removed to Paris, where he was shut up with his colleagues in the Louvre.  Their trial before parliament"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],["title","A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#5)"],["body"," prosecuted eagerly, especially in the case of the absent De Clisson, whom a royal decree banished from the kingdom “as a false and wicked traitor to the crown, and condemned him to ‘pay a hundred thousand marks of silver, and to forfeit forever the office of constable.’”  It is impossible in the present day to estimate how much legal justice there was in this decree; but, in any case, it was certainly extreme severity to so noble and valiant a warrior who had done so much for the safety and honor of France.  The Dukes of Burgundy and Berry and many barons of the realm signed the decree; but the king’s brother, the Duke of Orleans, refused to have any part in it.  Against the other councillors of the king the prosecution was continued, with fits and starts of determination, but in general with slowness and uncertainty.  Under the influence of the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry, the parliament showed an inclination towards severity; but Bureau de la Riviere had warm friends, and amongst others, the young and beautiful Duchess of Berry, to whose marriage he had greatly contributed, and John Juvenal des Ursins, provost of the tradesmen of Paris, one of the men towards whom the king and the populace felt the highest esteem and confidence.  The king, favorably inclined towards the accused by his own bias and the influence of the Duke of Orleans, presented a demand to parliament to have the papers of the procedure brought to him. Parliament hesitated and postponed a reply; the procedure followed its course; and at the end of some months further the king ordered it to be stopped, and Sires de la Riviere and Neviant to be set at liberty and to have their real property restored to them, at the same time that they lost their personal property and were commanded to remain forever at fifteen leagues’ distance, at least, from the court.  This was moral equity, if not legal justice.  The accused had been able and faithful servants of their king and country.  Their imprisonment had lasted more than a year. The Dukes of Burgundy and Berry remained in possession of power.  They exercised it for ten years, from 1392 to 1402, without any great dispute between themselves--the Duke of Burgundy’s influence being predominant--or with the king, who, save certain lucid intervals, took merely a nominal part in the government.  During this period no event of importance disturbed France internally.  In 1393 the King of England, Richard II., son of the Black Prince, sought in marriage the daughter of Charles VI., Isabel of France, only eight years old.  In both courts and in both countries there was a desire for peace.  An embassy came in state to demand the hand of the princess.  The ambassadors were presented, and the Earl of Northampton, marshal of England, putting one knee to the ground before her, said, “Madame, please God you shall be our sovereign lady and Queen of England.”  The young girl, well tutored, answered, “If it please God and my lord and father that I should be Queen of England, I would be willingly, for I have certainly been told that I should then be a great lady.”  The contract was signed on the 9th of March, 1396, with a promise that, when the princess had accomplished her twelfth year, she should be free to assent to or refuse the union; and ten days after the marriage, the king’s uncles and the English ambassadors mutually signed a truce, which promised--but quite in vain--to last for eight and twenty years.  About the same time Sigismund, King of Hungary, threatened with an invasion of his kingdom by the great Turkish Sultan Bajazet I., nicknamed Lightning (El Derfr), because of his rapid conquests, invoked the aid of the Christian kings of the West, and especially of the King of France. Thereupon there was a fresh outbreak of those crusades so often renewed since the end of the thirteenth century.  All the knighthood of France arose for the defence of a Christian king.  John, Count of Nevers, eldest son of the Duke of Burgundy, scarcely eighteen years of age, said to his comrades, “If it pleased my two lords, my lord the king and my lord and father, I would willingly head this army and this venture, for I have a desire to make myself known.”  The Duke of Burgundy consented, and, in person, conducted his son to St. Denis, but without intending to make him a knight as yet.  “He shall receive the accolade,” said he, “as a knight of Jesus Christ, at the first battle against the infidels.”  In April, 1396, an army of new crusaders left France and traversed Germany uproariously, everywhere displaying its valiant ardor, presumptuous recklessness, and chivalrous irregularity.  Some months elapsed without any news; but, at the beginning of December, there were seen arriving in France some poor creatures, half naked, dying of hunger, cold, and weariness, and giving deplorable accounts of the destruction of the French army.  The people would not believe them: “They ought to be thrown into the water,” they said, “these scoundrels who propagate such lies.”  But, on the 23th of December, there arrived at Paris James de Helly, a knight of Artois, who, booted and spurred, strode into the hostel of St. Paul, threw himself on his knees before the king in the midst of the princes, and reported that he had come straight from Turkey; that on the 28th of the preceding September the Christian army had been destroyed at the battle of Nicopolis; that most of the lords had been either slain in battle or afterwards massacred by the sultan’s order; and that the Count of Nevers had sent him to the king and to his father the duke, to get negotiations entered into for his release.  There was no exaggeration about the knight’s story.  The battle had been terrible, the slaughter awful.  For the latter, the French, who were for a moment victorious, had set a cruel example with their prisoners; and Bajazet had surpassed them in cool ferocity.  After the first explosion of the father’s and the people’s grief, the ransom of the prisoners became the topic.  It was a large sum, and rather difficult to raise; and, whilst it was being sought for, James de Helly returned to report as much to Bajazet, and to place himself once more in his power.  “Thou art welcome,” said the sultan; “thou hast loyally kept thy word; I give thee thy liberty; thou canst go whither thou wiliest.”  Terms of ransom were concluded; and the sum total was paid through the hands of Bartholomew Pellegrini, a Genoese trader.  Before the Count of Nevers and his comrades set out, Bajazet sent for them.  “John,” said he to the count through an interpreter, “I know that thou art a great lord in thy country, and the son of a great lord.  Thou art young.  It may be that thou art abashed and grieved at what hath befallen thee in thy first essay of knighthood, and that, to retrieve thine honor, thou wilt collect a powerful army against me.  I might, ere I release thee, bind thee by oath not to take arms against me, neither thyself nor thy people.  But no; I will not exact this oath either from them or from thee.  When thou hast returned yonder, take up arms if it please thee, and come and attack me.  Thou wilt find me ever ready to receive thee in the open field, thee and thy men-at-arms.  And what I say to thee, I say for the sake of all the Christians thou mayest purpose to bring.  I fear them not; I was born to fight them, and to conquer the world.”  Everywhere and at all times human pride, with its blind arrogance, is the same.  Bajazet saw no glimpse of that future when his empire would be decaying, and held together only by the interested protection of Christian powers.  After paying dearly for their errors and their disasters, Count John of Nevers and his comrades in captivity re-entered France in February, 1398, and their expedition to Hungary was but one of the last vain ventures of chivalry in the great struggle that commenced in the seventh century between Islamry and Christendom.  While this tragic incident was taking place in Eastern Europe, the court of the mad king was falling a victim to rivalries, intrigues, and scandals which, towards the close of this reign, were to be the curse and the shame of France.  There had grown up between Queen Isabel of Bavaria and Louis, Duke of Orleans, brother of the king, an intimacy which, throughout the city and amongst all honorable people, shocked even the least strait-laced.  It was undoubtedly through the queen’s influence that Charles VI., in 1402, suddenly decided upon putting into the hands of the Duke of Orleans the entire government of the realm and the right of representing him in everything during the attacks of his malady.  The Duke of Burgundy wrote at once about it to the parliament of Paris, saying, “Take counsel and pains that the interests of the king and his dominion be not governed as they now are, for, in good truth, it is a pity and a grief to hear what is told me about it.”  The accusation was not grounded solely upon the personal ill-temper of the Duke of Burgundy. His nephew, the Duke of Orleans, was elegant, affable, volatile, good-natured; he had for his partisans at court all those who shared his worse than frivolous tastes and habits; and his political judgment was no better than his habits.  No sooner was he invested with power than he abused it strangely; he levied upon the clergy as well as the people an enormous talliage, and the use he made of the money increased still further the wrath of the public.  An Augustine monk, named James Legrand, already celebrated for his writings, had the hardihood to preach even before the court against abuses of power and licentiousness of morals. The king rose up from his own place, and went and sat down right opposite the preacher.  “Yes, sir,” continued the monk, “the king your father, during his reign, did likewise lay taxes upon the people, but with the produce of them he built fortresses for the defence of the kingdom, he hurled back the enemy and took possession of"]]]
