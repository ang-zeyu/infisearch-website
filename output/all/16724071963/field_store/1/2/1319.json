The Astronomer twitched his beard and demanded if the fact that Ellinor had been a married woman these ten years past was not an obstacle to the plan which his fair cousin had proposed?  Here the Prince was accoutred cap-à-pie, and hauled out a paper. Dating from Viterbo, Clement, Bishop of Rome, servant to the servants of God, desirous of all health and apostolical blessing for his well-beloved son in Christ, stated that a compact between a boy of fifteen and a girl of ten was an affair of no particular moment; and that in consideration of the covenantors never having clapped eyes upon each other since the wedding-day,--even had not the precontract of marriage between the groom's father and the bride's mother rendered a consummation of the childish oath an obvious and a most heinous enormity,--why, that, in a sentence, and for all his coy verbosity, the new pontiff was perfectly amenable to reason.  So in a month it was settled. Alphonso would give his sister to de Gâtinais, and in exchange get the latter's vote to make Alphonso King of Germany; and Gui Foulques of Sabionetta--now Clement, fourth Pope to assume that name--would annul the previous marriage, and in exchange get an armament to serve him against Manfred, the late and troublesome tyrant of Sicily and Apulia. The scheme promised to each one of them that which he in particular desired, and messengers were presently sent into Ponthieu.  It is now time we put aside these Castilian matters and speak of other things. In England, Prince Edward had fought, and won, a shrewd battle at Evesham. People said, of course, that such behavior was less in the manner of his nominal father, King Henry, than reminiscent of Count Manuel of Poictesme, whose portraits certainly the Prince resembled to an embarrassing extent. Either way, the barons' power was demolished, there would be no more internecine war; and spurred by the unaccustomed idleness, Prince Edward began to think of the foreign girl he had not seen since the day he wedded her. She would be a woman by this, and it was befitting that he claim his wife. He rode with Hawise Bulmer and her baby to Ambresbury, and at the gate of the nunnery they parted, with what agonies are immaterial to this history's progression; the tale merely tells that, having thus decorously rid himself of his mistress, the Prince went into Lower Picardy alone, riding at adventure as he loved to do, and thus came to Entréchat, where his wife resided with her mother, the Countess Johane.  In a wood near the castle he approached a company of Spaniards, four in number, their horses tethered while these men (Oviedans, as they told him) drank about a great stone which served them for a table. Being thirsty, he asked and was readily accorded hospitality, and these five fell into amicable discourse. One fellow asked his name and business in those parts, and the Prince gave each without hesitancy as he reached for the bottle, and afterward dropped it just in time to catch, cannily, with his naked left hand, the knife-blade with which the rascal had dug at the unguarded ribs. The Prince was astounded, but he was never a subtle man: here were four knaves who, for reasons unexplained--but to them of undoubted cogency--desired his death: manifestly there was here an actionable difference of opinion; so he had his sword out and killed the four of them.  Presently came to him an apple-cheeked boy, habited as a page, who, riding jauntily through the forest, lighted upon the Prince, now in bottomless vexation. The lad drew rein, and his lips outlined a whistle. At his feet were several dead men in various conditions of dismemberment. And seated among them, as if throned upon this boulder, was a gigantic and florid person, so tall that the heads of few men reached to his shoulder; a person of handsome exterior, high-featured and blond, having a narrow, small head, and vivid light blue eyes, and the chest of a stallion; a person whose left eyebrow had an odd oblique droop, so that the stupendous man appeared to be winking the information that he was in jest.  \"Fair friend,\" said the page. \"God give you joy! and why have you converted this forest into a shambles?\"  The Prince told him as much of the half-hour's action as has been narrated. \"I have perhaps been rather hasty,\" he considered, by way of peroration, \"and it vexes me that I did not spare, say, one of these lank Spaniards, if only long enough to ascertain why, in the name of Termagaunt, they should have desired my destruction.\"  But midway in his tale the boy had dismounted with a gasp, and he was now inspecting the features of one carcass. \"Felons, my Prince! You have slain some eight yards of felony which might have cheated the gallows had they got the Princess Ellinor safe to Burgos. Only two days ago this chalk-eyed fellow conveyed to her a letter.\"  Prince Edward said, \"You appear, lad, to be somewhat overheels in the confidence of my wife.\"  Now the boy arose and defiantly flung back his head in shrill laughter. \"Your wife! Oh, God have mercy! Your wife, and for ten years left to her own devices! Why, look you, to-day you and your wife would not know each other were you two brought face to face.\"  Prince Edward said, \"That is very near the truth.\" But, indeed, it was the absolute truth, and as it concerned him was already attested.  \"Sire Edward,\" the boy then said, \"your wife has wearied of this long waiting till you chose to whistle for her. Last summer the young Prince de Gâtinais came a-wooing--and he is a handsome man.\" The page made known all which de Gâtinais and King Alphonso planned, the words jostling as they came in torrents, but so that one might understand. \"I am her page, my lord. I was to follow her. These fellows were to be my escort, were to ward off possible pursuit. Cry haro, beau sire! Cry haro, and shout it lustily, for your wife in company with six other knaves is at large between here and Burgos,--that unreasonable wife who grew dissatisfied after a mere ten years of neglect.\"  \"I have been remiss,\" the Prince said, and one huge hand strained at his chin; \"yes, perhaps I have been remiss. Yet it had appeared to me--But as it is, I bid you mount, my lad!\"  The boy demanded, \"And to what end?\"  \"Oy Dieus, messire! have I not slain your escort? Why, in common reason, equity demands that I afford you my protection so far as Burgos, messire, just as plainly as equity demands I slay de Gâtinais and fetch back my wife to England.\"  The page wrung exquisite hands with a gesture which was but partially tinged with anguish, and presently began to laugh. Afterward these two rode southerly, in the direction of Castile.  For it appeared to the intriguing little woman a diverting jest that in this fashion her husband should be the promoter of her evasion. It appeared to her more diverting when in two days' space she had become fond of him. She found him rather slow of comprehension, and she was humiliated by the discovery that not an eyelash of the man was irritated by his wife's decampment; he considered, to all appearances, that some property of his had been stolen, and he intended, quite without passion, to repossess himself of it, after, of course, punishing the thief.  This troubled the Princess somewhat; and often, riding by her stolid husband's side, the girl's heart raged at memory of the decade so newly overpast which had kept her always dependent on the charity of this or that ungracious patron--on any one who would take charge of her while the truant husband fought out his endless squabbles in England. Slights enough she had borne during the period, and squalor, and physical hunger also she had known, who was the child of a king and a saint.[2] But now she rode toward the dear southland; and presently she would be rid of this big man, when he had served her purpose; and afterward she meant to wheedle Alphonso, just as she had always wheedled him, and later still, she and Etienne would be very happy: in fine, to-morrow was to be a new day.  So these two rode southward, and always Prince Edward found this new page of his--this Miguel de Rueda,--a jolly lad, who whistled and sang inapposite snatches of balladry, without any formal ending or beginning, descanting always with the delicate irrelevancy of a bird-trill.  Sang Miguel de Rueda:    \"Man's Love, that leads me day by day   Through many a screened and scented way,   Finds to assuage my thirst.    \"No love that may the old love slay,   None sweeter than the first.    \"Fond heart of mine, that beats so fast   As this or that fair maid trips past,   Once, and with lesser stir   We viewed the grace of love, at last,   And turned idolater.    \"Lad's Love it was, that in the spring   When all things woke to blossoming   Was as a child that came   Laughing, and filled with wondering,   Nor knowing his own name--\"  \"And still I would prefer to think,\" the big man interrupted, heavily, \"that Sicily is not the only allure. I would prefer to think my wife so beautiful.--And yet, as I remember her, she was nothing extraordinary.\"  The page a little tartly said that people might forget a deal within a decade.  The Prince continued his unriddling of the scheme hatched in Castile. \"When Manfred is driven out of Sicily they will give the throne to de Gâtinais. He intends to get both a kingdom and a handsome wife by this neat affair. And in reason, England must support my Uncle Richard's claim to the German crown, against El Sabio--Why, my lad, I ride southward to prevent a war that would devastate half Europe.\"  \"You ride southward in the attempt to rob a miserable woman of her sole chance of happiness,\" Miguel de Rueda estimated.  \"That is undeniable, if she loves this thrifty Prince, as indeed I do not question my wife does. Yet our happiness here is a trivial matter, whereas war is a great disaster. You have not seen--as I, my little Miguel, have often seen--a man viewing his death-wound with a face"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11752"],["title","Chivalry: Dizain des Reines (#7)"],["body"," stupid wonder, a bewildered wretch in point to die in his lord's quarrel and understanding never a word of it. Or a woman, say--a woman's twisted and naked body, the breasts yet horribly heaving, in the red ashes of some village, or the already dripping hoofs which will presently crush this body. Well, it is to prevent many such ugly spectacles hereabout that I ride southward.\"  Miguel de Rueda shuddered. But, \"She has her right to happiness,\" the page stubbornly said.  \"She has only one right,\" the Prince retorted; \"because it has pleased the Emperor of Heaven to appoint us twain to lofty stations, to entrust to us the five talents of the parable; whence is our debt to Him, being fivefold, so much the greater than that of common persons. Therefore the more is it our sole right, being fivefold, to serve God without faltering, and therefore is our happiness, or our unhappiness, the more an inconsiderable matter. For, as I have read in the Annals of the Romans--\" He launched upon the story of King Pompey and his daughter, whom a certain duke regarded with impure and improper emotions. \"My little Miguel, that ancient king is our Heavenly Father, that only daughter is the rational soul of us, which is here delivered for protection to five soldiers--that is, to the five senses,--to preserve it from the devil, the world, and the flesh. But, alas! the too-credulous soul, desirous of gazing upon the gaudy vapors of this world--\"  \"You whine like a canting friar,\" the page complained; \"and I can assure you that the Lady Ellinor was prompted rather than hindered by her God-given faculties of sight and hearing and so on when she fell in love with de Gâtinais. Of you two, he is, beyond any question, the handsomer and the more intelligent man, and it was God who bestowed on her sufficient wit to perceive the superiority of de Gâtinais. And what am I to deduce from this?\"  The Prince reflected. At last he said: \"I have also read in these same Gestes how Seneca mentions that in poisoned bodies, on account of the malignancy and the coldness of the poison, no worm will engender; but if the body be smitten by lightning, in a few days the carcass will abound with vermin. My little Miguel, both men and women are at birth empoisoned by sin, and then they produce no worm--that is, no virtue. But once they are struck with lightning--that is, by the grace of God,--they are astonishingly fruitful in good works.\"  The page began to laugh. \"You are hopelessly absurd, my Prince, though you will never know it,--and I hate you a little,--and I envy you a great deal.\"  \"Ah, but,\" Prince Edward said, in misapprehension, for the man was never quick-witted,--\"but it is not for my own happiness that I ride southward.\"  The page then said, \"What is her name?\"  Prince Edward answered, very fondly, \"Hawise.\"  \"I hate her, too,\" said Miguel de Rueda; \"and I think that the holy angels alone know how profoundly I envy her.\"  In the afternoon of the same day they neared Ruffec, and at the ford found three brigands ready, two of whom the Prince slew, and the other fled.  Next night they supped at Manneville, and sat afterward in the little square, tree-chequered, that lay before their inn. Miguel had procured a lute from the innkeeper, and he strummed idly as these two debated together of great matters; about them was an immeasurable twilight, moonless, but tempered by many stars, and everywhere they could hear an agreeable whispering of leaves.  \"Listen, my Prince,\" the boy said: \"here is one view of the affair.\" And he began to chant, without rhyming, without raising his voice above the pitch of talk, while the lute monotonously accompanied his chanting.  Sang Miguel:    \"Passeth a little while, and Irus the beggar and   Menephtah the high king are at sorry unison, and   Guenevere is a skull. Multitudinously we tread   toward oblivion, as ants hasten toward sugar, and   presently Time cometh with his broom. Multitudinously   we tread a dusty road toward oblivion; but   yonder the sun shines upon a grass-plot, converting it   into an emerald; and I am aweary of the trodden path.    \"Vine-crowned is the fair peril that guards the   grasses yonder, and her breasts are naked. 'Vanity   of Vanities!' saith the beloved. But she whom I love   seems very far away to-night, though I might be with   her if I would. And she may not aid me now, for not   even love is all-powerful. She is most dear of created   women, and very wise, but she may never understand   that at any time one grows aweary of the trodden path.    \"At sight of my beloved, love closes over my heart   like a flood. For the sake of my beloved I have striven,   with a good endeavor, to my tiny uttermost. Pardie, I   am not Priam at the head of his army! A little while   and I will repent; to-night I cannot but remember that   there are women whose lips are of a livelier tint, that   life is short at best, that wine evokes in me some admiration   for myself, and that I am aweary of the trodden   path.    \"She is very far from me to-night. Yonder in the   Hörselberg they exult and make sweet songs, songs   which are sweeter, immeasurably sweeter, than this   song of mine, but in the trodden path I falter, for I am   tired, tired in every fibre of me, and I am aweary of   the trodden path\"  Followed a silence. \"Ignorance spoke there,\" the Prince said. \"It is the song of a woman, or else of a boy who is very young. Give me the lute, my little Miguel.\" And presently the Prince, too, sang.  Sang the Prince:    \"I was in a path, and I trod toward the citadel of the   land's Seigneur, and on either side were pleasant and   forbidden meadows, having various names. And one   trod with me who babbled of the brooding mountains   and of the low-lying and adjacent clouds; of the west   wind and of the budding fruit-trees. He debated the   significance of these things, and he went astray to   gather violets, while I walked in the trodden path.\"    \"He babbled of genial wine and of the alert lips of   women, of swinging censers and of the serene countenances   of priests, and of the clear, lovely colors of   bread and butter, and his heart was troubled by a   world profuse in beauty. And he leaped a stile to share   his allotted provision with a dying dog, and afterward,   being hungry, a wall to pilfer apples, while I walked   in the trodden path.    \"He babbled of Autumn's bankruptcy and of the age-long   lying promises of Spring; and of his own desire   to be at rest; and of running waters and of decaying   leaves. He babbled of the far-off stars; and he debated   whether they were the eyes of God or gases which   burned, and he demonstrated, with logic, that neither   existed. At times he stumbled as he stared about him   and munched his apples, so that he was all bemired, but   I walked in the trodden path.    \"And the path led to the gateway of a citadel, and   through the gateway. 'Let us not enter,' he said, 'for   the citadel is vacant, and, moreover, I am in profound   terror, and, besides, I have not as yet eaten all my   apples.' And he wept aloud, but I was not afraid, for   I had walked in the trodden path.\"  Again there was a silence. \"You paint a dreary world, my Prince.\"  \"My little Miguel, I paint the world as the Eternal Father made it. The laws of the place are written large, so that all may read them; and we know that every road, whether it be my trodden path or some byway through your gayer meadows, yet leads in the end to God. We have our choice,--or to come to Him as a laborer comes at evening for the day's wages fairly earned, or to come as a roisterer haled before the magistrate.\"  \"I consider you to be in the right,\" the boy said, after a lengthy interval, \"although I decline--and decline emphatically--to believe you.\"  The Prince laughed. \"There spoke Youth,\" he said, and he sighed as though he were a patriarch. \"But we have sung, we two, the Eternal Tenson of God's will and of man's desires. And I claim the prize, my Little Miguel.\"  Suddenly the page kissed one huge hand. \"You have conquered, my very dull and very glorious Prince. Concerning that Hawise--\" But Miguel de Rueda choked. \"Oh, I do not understand! and yet in part I understand!\" the boy wailed in the darkness.  And the Prince laid one hand upon his page's hair, and smiled in the darkness to note how soft was this hair, since the man was less a fool than at first view you might have taken him to be; and he said:  \"One must play the game out fairly, my lad. We are no little people, she and I, the children of many kings, of God's regents here on earth; and it was never reasonable, my Miguel, that gentlefolk should cheat at their dicing.\"  The same night Miguel de Rueda repeated the prayer which Saint Theophilus made long ago to the Mother of God:      \"Dame, je n'ose,   Flors d'aiglentier et lis et rose,   En qui li filz Diex se repose,\"  and so on. Or, in other wording: \"Hearken, O gracious Lady! thou that art more fair than any flower of the eglantine, more comely than the blossoming of the rose or of the lily! thou to whom was confided the very Son of God! Harken, for I am afraid! afford counsel to me that am ensnared by Satan and know not what to do! Never will I make an end of praying. O Virgin débonnaire! O honored Lady! Thou that wast once a woman--!\"  So he prayed, and upon the next day as these two rode southward, he sang half as if in defiance.  Sang Miguel:      \"And still,--whatever years impend   To witness Time a fickle friend,   And Youth a dwindling fire,--   I must adore till all years end   My first love, Heart's Desire.      \"I may not hear men speak of her   Unmoved, and vagrant pulses stir   To greet her passing-by,   And I, in all her worshipper   Must serve her till I die.      \"For I remember: this is she   That reigns in one man's memory   Immune to age and fret,   And stays the maid I may not see   Nor win to, nor forget.\"  It was on the following day, near Bazas, that these two encountered"]]]
