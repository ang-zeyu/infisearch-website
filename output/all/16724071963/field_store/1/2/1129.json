The boy thought he recognized a significant signal as the fellow disappeared,  The lads never knew exactly how it all occurred.  They only knew at the time that there was a quick rush, a flash of weapons, a desperate struggle, then momentary unconsciousness.  They decided afterwards that their enemies had rushed upon them from every direction, and that the sneering face of Rae had gloated over their capture.  \"Don't injure them,\" Rae ordered, as ropes were knotted about the wrists and ankles of the prisoners.  \"I'll go out now and see that the two Black Bears,\" with a double sneer in his voice, \"are taken into camp in short order.  Bad climate, this, for school boys who imitate wild animals,\" he added, with a malicious smile.  \"A bad climate.\"  \"You're all right!\" Jimmie called out, as Rae paused in the doorway for an instant.  \"You're all right!  But let me give you a pointer.  You keep the Bears and Wolves you get in strong cages!  If they get out, they'll eat you up!\"  \"Oh! I'll pull their fangs!\" laughed the other, and then he was gone.  \"This China seems to be a nice country,\" Jimmie said, turning to Ned. \"Some people would break our crusts in instead of tyin' us up.\"  \"I rather think,\" Ned replied, \"that they have planned to do that a little later on.  We ought never to have taken such chances.\"  \"You can't have a chicken pie,\" grinned Jimmie, \"unless some one kills a chicken!  No more can you find out what's goin' on by sittin' down in an old house an' waitin' for someone to bring you the news in a New York newspaper!  We had to keep cases on this chap, didn't we?\"  \"I think you would talk slang if you were drowning,\" Ned smiled. \"Anyway,\" he added, \"we've caused Rae, if that is his name, to show his hand.  That is something.\"  \"If we never get away,\" laughed Jimmie, \"we can leave the information to our friends in a will!  I wonder if this gazabo will get Frank and Jack?\"  \"Possibly,\" Ned answered.  \"They seem to be puttin' most all the Americans in China out of circulation!\" said the little fellow.  \"Wonder if that old gear-face thinks he can guard us an' sleep, too?  Say, you watch your chance, Ned, an' I'll roll over and geezle him an' you get out of the house.  Roll out, tumble out, any way to get out!  There,\" with a sigh of disappointment, \"there's another Chink in the game.  Listen to what they are saying!\"     CHAPTER IV  TWO BLACK BEARS IN TROUBLE   Jack and Frank sat long by the window, waiting for Ned and Jimmie to return.  The doors of the adjoining rooms were wide open, so they had a full view of the lower floor.  There were windows, unglazed like that which looked out on the Gulf of Pechili, too, and the lads could see for some distance along the street which ran parallel with the one upon which the miserable old structure faced.  Presently a mist crept over the sky, and black clouds rolled in from the threatening canopy over the gulf.  There was evidently a storm brewing, and, besides, the night was coming on.  In spite of the fact that they had a good view all about them, so far as the house and its immediate vicinity was concerned, both boys felt that almost indescribable sensation which one experiences when being observed from behind by keen and magnetic eyes.  They were not exactly afraid, but they had premonitions of approaching trouble.  \"I wonder what's keeping Ned?\" Jack asked.  \"Hope he hasn't gotten into trouble.\"  \"Oh, he'll look out for that!\"  \"Of course!  Ned's no slouch!\"  While the boys cheered themselves with such remarks as these, the rooms grew darker and the black clouds from off the gulf dropped nearer.  \"What an ungodly country!\" Jack exclaimed.  \"I feel as if I were surrounded by snakes, and all kinds of reptiles.  How would you like to take a New York special, just now?\"  \"I'm not yet seared of the job we are on,\" Frank replied, \"but I'd like a half decent show of getting out alive.  I feel like we were in a hole in the ground, with all manner of creeping things about us.  The very air seems to be impregnated with treachery and cunning.\"  \"That's the breath of the Orient,\" smiled Jack, not inclined to continue in the vein in which the conversation had started.  \"I don't know why the breath of the Orient should differ from the breath of the Occident,\" replied Frank, well pleased at the change of subject. \"It wouldn't, if the natives of the far East would put bathtubs in their houses and garbage cans on the street comers.\"  \"Well, there certainly is an odor about the East,\" grinned Jack. \"Perhaps it is the hot weather.\"  \"Hot weather has nothing to do with the sanitary conditions of this part of the world,\" Frank went on.  \"Peking is in the latitude of Philadelphia, or New York.  You wouldn't think so to hear people talk about the Orient back home, but you'll change your mind if you don't get out of this before winter sets in.\"  \"Somehow I never associated cold weather with the East,\" Jack said.  \"Why,\" Frank continued, \"this river freezes over about the middle of December and they run sledges on the ice until the middle of March.  In summer it is often 106 above zero, while in the winter it drops to about 6 degrees below.  If the natives were half civilized, you might get the idea that you were in Ohio, because of the fields of corn.\"  \"We don't know much about China, do we?\" mused Jack.  This was Frank's opportunity.  Before reaching the coast he had spent many hours studying up on the history of the strange land he was about to visit. His father was owner and editor of one of the most powerful newspapers in New York City, and the boy had had plenty of inspiration for historical research from the time he was old enough to read.  His father's library had supplied him with all the facilities necessary to the carrying out of his inclination, and his travels with the Boy Scouts had brought him into contact with many of the countries whole history he had studied so enthusiastically.  Now he saw an opportunity of talking China to Jack, and started in at once. Jack listened eagerly, for, while interested in the past of the strange land, he was too busy a young man to spend much time in any library.  His father was one of the leading corporation lawyers in New York, but the boy's inclinations pointed to mining as a future profession--when he had investigated the wilds of the world!  \"We don't know much about China,\" Frank began, \"because for centuries China has shunned what we call civilization.  This is said to be the most ancient and populous nation in the world, although it seems to me that history goes back farther on the banks of the Nile and the Euphrates than on the western shore of the Yellow Sea.  \"The authentic history of China goes back 2207 years before the birth of Christ, while Egyptian records and the data found along the Euphrates and the Tigris point to a much older organization of men into communities. However, it is said by some that Fuh-hi founded the Chinese empire eight hundred years before the date given, when Yu the Great began to make history.  \"One reason why the story of China is so short, comparatively, is that Ching Wang, the old fellow who caused the Chinese wall to be built to keep out the Tartars, ordered all books and records previous to his time to be destroyed.  This was to dispose of the stories of wars, in which China, before his time, was always engaged.  \"China has always been at war with the Mongolians.  In 1300 A.D., Genghis Khan raised a Mongolian army and captured Peking.  Later, one Kublai Khan overthrew the Sung dynasty and established a Mongolian empire.  The members of the defeated royal family drowned themselves in the river at Canton. This Mongolian dynasty lasted until the middle of the fourteenth century, when it was overthrown.  \"The Chinese governed their own land, then, until 1644, just before which time the emperor was murdered by native sons.  Then the Tartars got to Peking, in spite of the Great Wall, and established the dynasty now on the throne.  \"One cause of the growing revolt in China is the fact that the Tartars are still in power.  But the Tartars who were warlike enough when China lay before them for conquest quieted down as soon as Sun-chi took the throne. Peace has been the rule since then.  \"It seem strange, but it is true, that China has not progressed, has not been given the respect conferred on other nations, because she would not, or could not fight.  Talk about peace all you like, but it is the fighters that win whether in private or national life.  \"China has been kicked about by all the nations of the world, large and powerful as she is, because it was understood that she could be insulted with impunity.  England put the opium curse on her against only feeble resistance.  She has stood for peace, not conquest, and had been treated condescendingly, like a big booby of a boy at school who is afraid of lads half his size.  The secret organization now forming in this country may overthrow the Manchu dynasty, but if it does it will build a Chinese republic and not a new Chinese empire.  \"It is claimed by some that the United States is favoring this new Chinese party of liberty, that the gold recently lost in the Pacific was our contribution to the cause--by the roundabout way we have heard so much about--and that the Washington government will be the first to recognize the new republic.  \"I don't know whether all this is true or not, but father says it is, and he ought to know.  Anyhow, there will be plenty of fighting before the present rulers release their grip on the royal treasury.  It may be that our mission here is to find out something more about this new movement.  \"You see,\" he added, \"if our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11469"],["title","Boy Scouts on Motorcycles; Or, With the Flying Squadron (#4)"],["body","is for the new movement, the nation which rammed the gold ship, which set the conspirators at work, which sent a great statesman, as we believe, to negotiate with the conspirators, is against it, and Uncle Sam possibly wants to know what power it is that is likely to assist the present Emperor of China in holding his job.  If Ned can get the proof he needs to establish what he already knows and suspects, he will do a good piece of work.\"  \"I wish he would return,\" Jack said, with an apprehensive look about the room.  'I don't see what is keeping him.\"  \"Here he comes, now!\" Frank cried, \"or it may be Jimmie,\" he added, \"blundering through the window.\"  Both boys arose and hastened to the door of the room from which the sounds of approach had been heard.  The apartment was dark and still, save for the whipping of the wind at the open casement.  While the boys stood there, expecting every instant to hear the voice of one of their chums, rain began to fall, and a sharp zigzag of lightning cut across the sky.  By this natural searchlight the lads saw a figure crouching just under the window.  The illumination lasted for an instant only, and it was not possible for them to see whether the visitor was dressed in native or European costume.  His face was not in sight, and only the barest outlines of his figure were discernible.  Jack was for rushing forward on a tour of inspection, but Frank took a firm grip on his friend's arm and held him back.  He not only prevented him springing upon the crouching figure, but drew him away from the open door-way, believing that both had been observed by the intruder.  \"We ought to get him!\" Jack panted, in a whisper.  \"We ought to find out if he is one of our enemies or only a common thief.\"  \"Much good it would do to capture him!\" Frank whispered back.  \"We couldn't force the truth out of him, and the things they call courts of justice here would soon be after us.\"  \"Then what can we do?\" demanded Jack.  Frank did not reply, for footsteps, now plainly heard above the sweep of the wind and rain, were approaching the room where the boys were standing, with automatic revolvers in their hands.  \"He's got his nerve!\" Jack said.  \"Why doesn't he come into the place with a brass band?  Shall we sneak out of a window, or remain here and find out what he wants?\"  \"I'm for getting out!\"  Frank leaped from the window as he spoke, and in a second Jack came piling out on top of him.  \"Gee whiz!\" Frank whispered.  \"Why don't you knock a fellow over?\"  \"What are you trying to do?\" demanded Jack.  \"Not a thing,\" was the reply.  \"Say, but we'll get a nice soak if we remain here.\"  \"You'll get a nice soak on the coco, if you don't stop pulling me around,\" came back from Jack.  \"Then keep your hands off me!\" Frank responded.  But in a moment both boys knew that they were not struggling with each other.  A brilliant flash of lightning cut the sky, and by its light they saw each other lying on the ground under the window, each with a couple of men in native costume perched on top.  Jack fired, but the pressure on his back was not lessened.  Instead, he felt a snaky hand slip down his arm, seize his fingers and twist the gun away.  \"Frank!\" he called out.  \"Frank!  Shoot at the heathens!  I missed, and one of them has my gun.\"  Frank obeyed the suggestion, and three reports were heard.  Jack, though not naturally bloodthirsty, was overjoyed at the sound of a groan which came from the spot where Frank lay.  \"Don't try that again, son!\"  \"That will be enough!\"  Both sentences were spoken in English.  Then the boys were carried bodily into the house and sat down against a wall.  Then a lighted lantern was brought in, and the prisoners saw six sleepy-looking Chinamen grinning at them.     CHAPTER V  A COLLECTION OF WILD ANIMALS   \"Well, what do you think of it?\"  The voice was that of an Englishman, and the words were spoken in the room, but the struggling prisoners could not discover where the person who uttered them stood.  It seemed to them that there were only the six sleepy-looking Chinamen and themselves in the apartment.  Frank ceased his useless struggling with the rope which held both feet and hands in its strong coils, and glanced along the row of stupid faces.  \"What did you say?\" he asked, hoping that the speaker would say something more and so locate himself.  \"How do you like it?\"  That was the same voice, and it was in that room, but, still, there were only the six Chinamen and Jack in sight.  Frank looked at his chum with a smile on his face.  In that moment he resolved to meet whatever Fate might have in store for him with a cheerful heart.  He had little doubt that both Ned and Jimmie had been caught in the trap into which Jack and himself had fallen.  There was no knowing what the fate of himself and his friends would be, but whatever had been planned for them by their enemies, there would be no relief in sighs and pleas for pity.  They were alone in the land of mystery.  Owing to the necessity for secrecy regarding their movements, no one with whom they had been associated in the Secret Service work knew of their whereabouts, save only Lieutenant Scott, who had sent them on to Taku, and who had failed to keep his promises to them.  And Lieutenant Scott?  Frank believed him dead or in the clutches of the conspirators.  Otherwise, he would have kept his appointment at the old house on the water front.  The view ahead was not a long one, as the boy considered the matter, nor a smooth one, but he decided that nothing was to be gained by subserviency.  \"I like it!\" was Jack's quick reply.  \"Who is it that is doing the talking?\"  \"One of the six in front of you,\" came the answer in English.  Jack cast his eyes quickly along the row of faces, but failed to catch the movement of a lip, the twinkle of an eye.  \"You're a funny bloke,\" Jack went on.  \"How much will you take for a month in vaudeville?\"  \"He'd make a fine spirit medium,\" Frank cut in.  \"Can you make the talk come from behind me?\" he added, with a grin.  \"Of course I can!\"  Although the boys watched closely, there were no signs of motion in any one of the six yellow, foxy faces, still the words seemed to come from the wall directly back of Jack's head.  \"If I had you on the Bowery,\" Jack continued, \"I'd give you a hundred a month.  Come on over and get busy in the little old United States!\"  \"I think I'll wait until the boys bring in the other two wild animals,\" replied the unknown speaker.  \"I rather want to see the finish of you Wolves and Black Bears before I see the Bowery again.\"  \"You'll find more wild animals of our stripe on the Bowery than you will want to meet,\" Jack replied, \"especially when it is known that you've been mixed up with Boy Scouts, to their harm, in China.\"  \"I'll take my chances on that,\" was the reply.  \"You have been very successful, you wild beasts, in butting into the business of other people, and getting out again uninjured, but it is going to be different now. There are two black Bears and two Wolves that I know of who will never get back to New York again.\"  \"All right,\" Frank said.  \"We've had fun enough out of the Secret Service work we have done to pay for whatever trouble we have now.  Ned will be along presently, and then you'll have another think coming.\"  \"Sure, he'll be along directly,\" was the reply.  \"In fact, he's right here now!\"  But it was not Ned who was pushed, bound hand and foot, into the circle of light in the room.  The little fellow came near falling as he was thrust forward, but he regained his equilibrium, and turned around to face his tormentor.  \"You're a cheap skate!\" he said.  \"If  I had you on Chatham Square I'd change your face good and plenty!\"  Then he saw that he was speaking to empty air.  There was no one in the doorway.  The person who had brought him there and hustled him into the room had disappeared.  \"Now, what do you know about that?\"  Jimmie chuckled as he asked the question of the six silent figures ranged along the wall.  As yet his eyes had not fallen on the figures of Frank and Jack, farther back in the shadows.  There was, of course, no answer to his question, and the boy leaned forward, a grin on his freckled face.  \"Say, but you're a bum lot!\" he cried.  \"Why don't you go back to the Pyramids and sleep for another thousand years?  There ain't no nourishment in sitting up there like a dime museum, for there's no one sellin' tickets at the door.\"  \"Look behind you!\"  That was the English voice again, seemingly out of the heavy air, or out of the storm outside.  Jimmie turned quickly and saw his chums nicely tied up.  In a moment he turned back to the row of six, without even exchanging a look with his friends.  \"Who's doin' the talkin',\" he asked.  Frank and Jack were now too impatient to know what had become of their leader to delay longer.  The latter asked:  \"Where's Ned?\"  \"Ask this lineup,\" Jimmie replied.  \"I don't know.  Gee!  If I had a face like that man on the end, I'd sell it to the wild man of Borneo, its an improvement on anythin' he could get up.  Say, Old Socks!\" he added, \"where is Ned?\"  \"Packed up, ready for delivery,\" was the reply.  \"Say, how would you wild animals like to take a jaunt on your motorcycles to-night?  Nice cool night for a ride!  You might reach Poking by morning and report to the American ambassador!\"  \"We'll get there in due time,\" Frank answered.  \"I've drawn the teeth of this collection of wild animals, at all events,\" said the voice.  \"No more Wolves and Black Bears will be apt to come to China.  Such collections are not popular here.\"  Jimmie dropped back to where his chums were seated.  Serious as the situation was, the boy could not restrain a smile as he threw himself down beside Frank.  The storm was still thundering outside, and splashes of rain now and then whirled in at the open casement.  The lantern which illuminated the interior of the room showed only a round blotch against the darkness.  In"]]]
