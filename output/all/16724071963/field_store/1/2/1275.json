The young men said to their mother,       \"Hear us, O dearest and best!     Time cannot cool or smother       The love of you in our breast;     Here is your place and no other--       Come home and rest.\"      And the mother's heart was grateful       For the love of her cherished ones,     And her labor, bitter and hateful,       She left at the word of her sons,     Till she heard far off the fateful       Voices of guns.      Their love did more enslave her;       They did not understand     That none could guard or save her       When war was on the land,     But herself, and God, who gave her       Heart and mind and hand.     Playthings       Last year the shops were crowded       With soldier suits and guns--     The presents that at Christmas time       We give our little sons;     And many a glittering trumpet       And many a sword and drum;     But as they're made in Germany       This year they will not come.      Perhaps another season       We shall not give our boys     Such very warlike playthings,       Such military toys;     Perhaps another season       We shall not think it sweet     To watch their game of soldier men,       Who dream not of defeat.     Militants       Hippolta, Penthesilea,       Maria Teresa and Joan,     Agustina and Boadicea       And some militant girls of our own--     It would take a brave man and a dull one       To say to these ladies: \"Of course     We adore you while meek,     Timid, clinging and weak,       But a woman can never use force.\"     A Lady's Choice       Her old love in tears and silence had been building her a palace       Ringed by moats and flanked with towers, he had set it on a hill     \"Here,\" he said, \"will come no whisper of the world's alarms and         malice,       In these granite walls imprisoned, I will keep you safe from ill.\"      As he spoke along the highway there came riding by a stranger,       For an instant on her features, he a fleeting glance bestowed,     Then he said: \"My heart is fickle and the world is full of danger,\"       And he offered her his stirrup and he pointed down the road.     The Ballad of Lost Causes   (_About 465 years after Villon_.)       Tell me in what spot remote       Do the antis dwell to-day,     Those who did not want to vote,       Feared their sex's prompt decay?       Where are those who used to say:     \"Home alone is woman's sphere;       Only those should vote who slay\"?     Where the snows of yester-year?      Where are those who used to quote       Nietzsche's words in dread array?     Where the ancient crones who wrote:       \"Women rule through Beauty's sway\"?       And those lovers, where are they,     Who could hold no woman dear       If she had the ballot? Nay!     Where the snows of yester-year?      Prince, inquire no more, I pray,       Whither antis disappear.     Suffrage won; they melt away,       Like the snows of yester-year.     Thoughts at an Anti Meeting       There are no homes in suffrage states,       There are no children, glad and good,     There, men no longer seek for mates,       And women lose their womanhood.      This I believe without debate,       And yet I ask--and ask in vain--     Why no one in a suffrage state       Has moved to change things back again?     A MASQUE OF TEACHERS  AND  THE UNCONSCIOUS SUFFRAGISTS     The Ideal Candidates   (A by-law of the New York Board of Education says: \"No married woman shall be appointed to any teaching or supervising position in the New York public schools unless her husband is mentally or physically incapacitated to earn a living or has deserted her for a period of not less than one year.\")   CHARACTERS      _Board of Education_.            _Three Would-Be Teachers_.      _Chorus by Board_:       Now please don't waste         Your time and ours       By pleas all based         On mental powers.       She seems to us         The proper stuff       Who has a hus-         Band bad enough.       All other pleas appear to us       Excessively superfluous.      _1st Teacher_:       My husband is not really bad----      _Board_:         How very sad, how very sad!      _1st Teacher_:         He's good, but hear my one excuse----      _Board_:         Oh, what's the use, oh, what's the use?      _1st Teacher_:         Last winter in a railroad wreck         He lost an arm and broke his neck.         He's doomed, but lingers day by day.      _Board_:         Her husband's doomed! Hurray! hurray!      _2nd Teacher_:         My husband's kind and healthy, too----      _Board_:         Why, then, of course, you will not do.      _2nd Teacher_:         Just hear me out. You'll find you're wrong.         It's true his body's good and strong;         But, ah, his wits are all astray.      _Board_:         Her husband's mad. Hip, hip, hurray!      _3rd Teacher_:       My husband's wise and well--the creature!      _Board_:       Then you can never be a teacher.      _3rd Teacher_:       Wait. For I led him such a life       He could not stand me as a wife;       Last Michaelmas, he ran away.      _Board_:       Her husband hates her, Hip, hurray!      _Chorus by Board_:       Now we have found         Without a doubt,       By process sound         And well thought out,       Each candidate         Is fit in truth       To educate         The mind of youth.       No teacher need apply to us       Whose married life's harmonious.               (_Curtain_.)     The Unconscious Suffragists   \"They who have no voice nor vote in the electing of representatives do not enjoy liberty, but are absolutely enslaved to those who have votes.\"--Benjamin Franklin.  \"No such phrase as virtual representation was ever known in law or constitution.\"--James Otis.  \"But these great cities, says my honorable friend, are virtually, though not directly represented. Are not the wishes of Manchester, he asks, as much consulted as those of any other town which sends members to Parliament? Now, sir, I do not understand how a power which is salutary when exercised virtually can be noxious when exercised directly. If the wishes of Manchester have as much weight with us as they would have under a system which gives representatives to Manchester, how can there be any danger in giving representatives to Manchester?\"--Lord Macaulay's Speech on the Reform Bill.  \"Universal suffrage prolongs in the United States the effect of universal education: for it stimulates all citizens throughout their lives to reflect on problems outside the narrow circle of their private interests and occupations: to read about public questions; to discuss public characters and to hold themselves ready in some degree to give a rational account of their political faith.\"--Dr. Charles Eliot.  \"But liberty is not the chief and constant object of their (the American people) desires: equality is their idol; they make rapid and sudden efforts to obtain liberty and if they miss their aim, resign themselves to their disappointment; but nothing can satisfy them without equality, and they would rather perish than lose it.\"--De Tocqueville: Democracy in America, 1835.  \"A government is for the benefit of all the people. We believe that this benefit is best accomplished by popular government because in the long run each class of individuals is apt to secure better provision for themselves through their own voice in government than through the altruistic interest of others, however intelligent or philanthropic.\"--William H. Taft in Special Message.  \"I have listened to some very honest and eloquent orators whose sentiments were noteworthy for this: that when they spoke of the people, they were not thinking of themselves, they were thinking of somebody whom they were commissioned to take care of. And I have seen them shiver when it was suggested that they arrange to have something done by the people for themselves.\"--The New Freedom, by Woodrow Wilson."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11696"],["title","The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: He sat down in a garden, with his back to a house that overlooked all London.]  THE FOOD OF THE GODS AND HOW IT CAME TO EARTH  H.G.

In the middle years of the nineteenth century there first became abundant in this strange world of ours a class of men, men tending for the most part to become elderly, who are called, and who are very properly called, but who dislike extremely to be called--\"Scientists.\" They dislike that word so much that from the columns of _Nature_, which was from the first their distinctive and characteristic paper, it is as carefully excluded as if it were--that other word which is the basis of all really bad language in this country. But the Great Public and its Press know better, and \"Scientists\" they are, and when they emerge to any sort of publicity, \"distinguished scientists\" and \"eminent scientists\" and \"well-known scientists\" is the very least we call them.  Certainly both Mr. Bensington and Professor Redwood quite merited any of these terms long before they came upon the marvellous discovery of which this story tells. Mr. Bensington was a Fellow of the Royal Society and a former president of the Chemical Society, and Professor Redwood was Professor of Physiology in the Bond Street College of the London University, and he had been grossly libelled by the anti-vivisectionists time after time. And they had led lives of academic distinction from their very earliest youth.  They were of course quite undistinguished looking men, as indeed all true Scientists are. There is more personal distinction about the mildest-mannered actor alive than there is about the entire Royal Society. Mr. Bensington was short and very, very bald, and he stooped slightly; he wore gold-rimmed spectacles and cloth boots that were abundantly cut open because of his numerous corns, and Professor Redwood was entirely ordinary in his appearance. Until they happened upon the Food of the Gods (as I must insist upon calling it) they led lives of such eminent and studious obscurity that it is hard to find anything whatever to tell the reader about them.  Mr. Bensington won his spurs (if one may use such an expression of a gentleman in boots of slashed cloth) by his splendid researches upon the More Toxic Alkaloids, and Professor Redwood rose to eminence--I do not clearly remember how he rose to eminence! I know he was very eminent, and that's all. Things of this sort grow. I fancy it was a voluminous work on Reaction Times with numerous plates of sphygmograph tracings (I write subject to correction) and an admirable new terminology, that did the thing for him.  The general public saw little or nothing of either of these gentlemen. Sometimes at places like the Royal Institution and the Society of Arts it did in a sort of way see Mr. Bensington, or at least his blushing baldness and something of his collar and coat, and hear fragments of a lecture or paper that he imagined himself to be reading audibly; and once I remember--one midday in the vanished past--when the British Association was at Dover, coming on Section C or D, or some such letter, which had taken up its quarters in a public-house, and following two, serious-looking ladies with paper parcels, out of mere curiosity, through a door labelled \"Billiards\" and \"Pool\" into a scandalous darkness, broken only by a magic-lantern circle of Redwood's tracings.  I watched the lantern slides come and go, and listened to a voice (I forget what it was saying) which I believe was the voice of Professor Redwood, and there was a sizzling from the lantern and another sound that kept me there, still out of curiosity, until the lights were unexpectedly turned up. And then I perceived that this sound was the sound of the munching of buns and sandwiches and things that the assembled British Associates had come there to eat under cover of the magic-lantern darkness.  And Redwood I remember went on talking all the time the lights were up and dabbing at the place where his diagram ought to have been visible on the screen--and so it was again so soon as the darkness was restored. I remember him then as a most ordinary, slightly nervous-looking dark man, with an air of being preoccupied with something else, and doing what he was doing just then under an unaccountable sense of duty.  I heard Bensington also once--in the old days--at an educational conference in Bloomsbury. Like most eminent chemists and botanists, Mr. Bensington was very authoritative upon teaching--though I am certain he would have been scared out of his wits by an average Board School class in half-an-hour--and so far as I can remember now, he was propounding an improvement of Professor Armstrong's Heuristic method, whereby at the cost of three or four hundred pounds' worth of apparatus, a total neglect of all other studies and the undivided attention of a teacher of exceptional gifts, an average child might with a peculiar sort of thumby thoroughness learn in the course of ten or twelve years almost as much chemistry as one could get in one of those objectionable shilling text-books that were then so common....  Quite ordinary persons you perceive, both of them, outside their science. Or if anything on the unpractical side of ordinary. And that you will find is the case with \"scientists\" as a class all the world over. What there is great of them is an annoyance to their fellow scientists and a mystery to the general public, and what is not is evident.  There is no doubt about what is not great, no race of men have such obvious littlenesses. They live in a narrow world so far as their human intercourse goes; their researches involve infinite attention and an almost monastic seclusion; and what is left over is not very much. To witness some queer, shy, misshapen, grey-headed, self-important, little discoverer of great discoveries, ridiculously adorned with the wide ribbon of some order of chivalry and holding a reception of his fellow-men, or to read the anguish of _Nature_ at the \"neglect of science\" when the angel of the birthday honours passes the Royal Society by, or to listen to one indefatigable lichenologist commenting on the work of another indefatigable lichenologist, such things force one to realise the unfaltering littleness of men.  And withal the reef of Science that these little \"scientists\" built and are yet building is so wonderful, so portentous, so full of mysterious half-shapen promises for the mighty future of man! They do not seem to realise the things they are doing! No doubt long ago even Mr. Bensington, when he chose this calling, when he consecrated his life to the alkaloids and their kindred compounds, had some inkling of the vision,--more than an inkling. Without some such inspiration, for such glories and positions only as a \"scientist\" may expect, what young man would have given his life to such work, as young men do? No, they _must_ have seen the glory, they must have had the vision, but so near that it has blinded them. The splendour has blinded them, mercifully, so that for the rest of their lives they can hold the lights of knowledge in comfort--that we may see!  And perhaps it accounts for Redwood's touch of preoccupation, that--there can be no doubt of it now--he among his fellows was different, he was different inasmuch as something of the vision still lingered in his eyes.   II.  The Food of the Gods I call it, this substance that Mr. Bensington and Professor Redwood made between them; and having regard now to what it has already done and all that it is certainly going to do, there is surely no exaggeration in the name. So I shall continue to call it therefore throughout my story. But Mr. Bensington would no more have called it that in cold blood than he would have gone out from his flat in Sloane Street clad in regal scarlet and a wreath of laurel. The phrase was a mere first cry of astonishment from him. He called it the Food of the Gods, in his enthusiasm and for an hour or so at the most altogether. After that he decided he was being absurd. When he first thought of the thing he saw, as it were, a vista of enormous possibilities--literally enormous possibilities; but upon this dazzling vista, after one stare of amazement, he resolutely shut his eyes, even as a conscientious \"scientist\" should. After that, the Food of the Gods sounded blatant to the pitch of indecency. He was surprised he had used the expression. Yet for all that something of that clear-eyed moment hung about him and broke out ever and again....  \"Really, you know,\" he said, rubbing his hands together and laughing nervously, \"it has more than a theoretical interest.  \"For example,\" he confided, bringing his face close to the Professor's and dropping to an undertone, \"it would perhaps, if suitably handled, _sell_....  \"Precisely,\" he said, walking away,--\"as a Food. Or at least a food ingredient.  \"Assuming of course that it is palatable. A thing we cannot know till we have prepared it.\"  He turned upon the hearthrug, and studied the carefully designed slits upon his cloth shoes.  \"Name?\" he said, looking up in response to an inquiry. \"For my part I incline to the good old classical allusion. It--it makes Science res--. Gives it a touch of old-fashioned dignity. I have been thinking ... I don't know if you will think it absurd of me....
