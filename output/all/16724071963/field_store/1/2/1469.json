War makes men fast; I know that for my home has been in the track of both armies.\"  \"You live in this neighborhood?\"  \"Yes, about twenty miles south of where we are now. Shall I tell you what I am doing here?\"  I bowed, eager to learn although I had not been brash enough to inquire.  \"You have been wondering all night,\" carelessly. \"If you had asked I should have refused to answer, but will now reward your remarkable patience with a full confession. I am going to take quinine back to our hospitals. I won't tell you where I am going to get it,\" a bit defiantly, \"although I am not afraid you would try to stop me.\"  \"Certainly not; why should I?\"  \"There are plenty of Yanks who do; the last messenger was shot by your raiders, and the whole consignment lost. He was my cousin; that is why I am trying what I can do--the boys need it so badly. If you are an honorable soldier you will not interfere with a work of mercy.\"  \"An honorable soldier!\" I exclaimed, stung by the words. \"Do you question that?\"  \"Not until after daylight came, and I noticed how you were clothed,\" and her eyes lost all gleam of humor. \"I respect a scout, but despise a spy.\"  My cheeks flamed, as I realized what she meant--the tattered gray jacket, buttoned tightly, and concealing my blue blouse. In swift disgust I wrenched it open, and flung the garment into the road.  \"I had entirely forgotten I had the thing on,\" I explained hastily. \"Don't condemn until you hear my story. You will listen, will you not?\"  She sat silent, looking intently into my face, with merely the slightest inclination of the head.  \"I came into your lines dressed just as I am now, drifting across the river behind a log. It was my third attempt to get through your pickets, and this time I succeeded. I found myself in thick brush near a cluster of tents, and overheard two officers talking. One was a major by the name of Hardy--do you know him?\"  \"Yes,\" a swift little catch in her voice.  \"The other was a shorter, heavier-set man, out-ranking Hardy.\"  \"Speaking with short, crisp sentences,\" she interrupted, \"and wearing a heavy beard?\"  \"He spoke that way--yes; but as to the beard I could not say owing to the darkness.\"  \"It must have been General Johnston.\"  \"I thought as much. The two were discussing the getting of despatches through to Beauregard, and decided no one could succeed but a fellow they called Billie, some relative or friend of Hardy's. It was all arranged he should try it, and the major started off to complete arrangements. An aide, with the despatches, was to meet the messenger at the 'Three Corners,' where the little log church is, and then accompany him through the pickets. It was plainly enough my duty to intercept these if I could, but in order to do so I must pass through two miles of the Confederate camp, meeting soldiers almost every step of the way. That was when I stole the jacket, and slipped it on, and never thought of it again until you spoke.\"  She was leaning forward now, intensely interested, her lips parted, the quick breath revealed by the pulsing of her breast.  \"And--and you got to the 'Three Corners'?\"  \"To a point just below. I ran most of the way, and then had to crawl through the bushes to get around a picket-post, but I believed I was there in plenty of time. Then you came rattling down the hill, with an officer riding along beside you, and, of course, I mistook you for Billie. I jumped your outfit in the hollow.\"  She flung up her hands in expressive gesture.  \"Were you hanging there all that time--even before the lieutenant left?\"  \"I certainly was; hanging on for dear life too. My limbs are black and blue. I never saw a pony travel like that little devil.\"  She burst into an unrestrained ripple of laughter, scarcely able to speak, as the full humor of the situation appealed to her. No doubt the expression of my face did its part, but she certainly found it most amusing. In spite of myself I had to smile in sympathy.  \"Oh, that was too good; I shall have to tell the general. Well, I helped Billie Hardy out that time, didn't I? I reckon you don't see much fun in it though.\"  \"No, I don't,\" frankly, \"yet I cannot say I am entirely sorry.\"  \"Indeed,\" sobering instantly because of my earnestness. \"I cannot understand that--the despatches have gone through.\"  \"Without doubt. From a military standpoint I surely regret my failure. But if I had intercepted Billie I should never have met you.\"  \"Oh!\"  \"Nor come to know you.\"  Again the girl laughed, and I noticed the dimple in her cheek, the gray-blue eyes glancing up at me mockingly.  \"Don't flatter yourself that you do,\" she retorted pleasantly, \"for you might be mistaken altogether.\"    CHAPTER V  ACQUAINTANCES, NOT FRIENDS  The manner in which this was uttered made me feel that she was in earnest. Indeed I was already beginning to realize that this young woman was an enigma, her moods changing so rapidly as to keep me in a state of constant bewilderment--one moment frank, outspoken, friendly; the next hiding her real self behind a barrier of cold reserve which I seemed helpless to penetrate. Yet this very changeableness was attractive, keeping my mind constantly on the alert, and yielding her a peculiar charm. As she spoke these words her eyes encountered mine, almost in challenge, which I met instantly.  \"Perhaps not--but I shall.\"  \"Oh, indeed! Is this conceit, or determination?\"  \"The latter assuredly. Why is it not possible for one to know you?\"  \"Really I cannot tell,\" not altogether displeased at my decision, \"yet it would border upon a miracle, for I do not even know myself. Besides I doubt your having the opportunity for sufficient study--that is Jonesboro yonder.\"  The road rounded the crest of a sharp hill, and, from off the summit, we could look directly down into the river valley. Except for little groves of scrub oak it was open country, the broad stream showing clearly between green banks, with few cultivated fields in sight. We had turned toward the north, and the straggling town lay directly in front two miles away, so hidden behind trees the houses were scarcely distinguishable; a quarter of a mile below was the bridge. I stood up, thrusting my head beyond the carriage cover, so as to see better. To the west the woods concealed everything. It was somewhere in that direction Beauregard's troops were encamped, yet, even if they were already advancing to unite with Johnston, they would hardly cross the country so far to the north. Knowing the situation as I did I felt little fear of any encounter with Confederates. Our cavalry were patrolling all the roads across the river, and, as late as the previous day, were guarding the Jonesboro bridge. I could see no signs of any such guard now, however, yet the trees were thick and obscured the view, and that heavy dust cloud to the right was probably caused by the passing of a troop of horse. Convinced that this would prove to be either a cavalry vidette, or a Federal foraging party, it made me more anxious to get quickly down into the town, hopeful they might have a spare horse with them, and I pointed out the dust spirals to my companion.  \"If you have friends in Jonesboro,\" I said, \"I've also got some coming.\"  \"Who are they?\" her eyes on the distant dust. \"Yankees?\"  \"Certainly; there are none of your people on that side of the river. Beauregard is out yonder in those hills. Let's drive on, the town looks quiet.\"  She leaned forward, holding to the edge of the carriage cover to keep her balance, her glance turning toward the southwest.  \"If those are your people they mustn't see me,\" she said quietly, a little accent of pleading in her voice. \"You promise that first?\"  \"Of course,\" although surprised at her asking. \"I know it is our orders to intercept everything which can aid the enemy, but I don't feel inclined to prevent your taking quinine to the poor fellows in the hospital. War hasn't made me as inhuman as that. We can easily reach the town ahead of that squad of cavalry, and if you have some safe place there to go, and will only keep indoors, there is no danger of discovery.\"  \"I have,\" eagerly, \"Judge Moran's house; you can see its gable there among the trees. He is so old he has not even been conscripted.\" She laughed, flashing a look aside at me as she shook the reins and applied the whip. \"I wonder what he will think when he sees me driving up alongside a Yankee. It will be like the end of the world. No, don't talk to me any more; I've got to conjure up a nice, respectable story to tell him.\"  She remained very quiet as we rattled down the hill, her forehead puckered, her gaze straight ahead. Suddenly she asked,  \"Do you sometimes tell falsehoods?\"  \"Guilty.\"  \"Are they ever justified?\"  \"Well, really I don't know; from the standpoint of the strict moralist I presume not; but it is my judgment the strict moralist wouldn't last long in time of war.\"  I was amused at the earnestness with which she looked at me, apparently weighing my words as soberly as though they had important meaning.  \"What's the trouble? If there is any prevaricating to be done, turn it over to me--I have become an expert.\"  \"No doubt,\" her face brightening, \"but I must attend to this case myself. Judge Moran will have to suppose you a Confederate spy. No, not a word of protest will I listen to. If you go along with me, it must be exactly as I say; there is no other way, for otherwise he would never receive you into the house.\"  \"Oh, very well,\" I replied indifferently, my eyes marking the swift approach of that distant squad of cavalry. \"The masquerade will be short, and well worth while if it only earns me a breakfast with you.\"  The toss of her head was hardly complimentary. We were in the tree-lined streets by this time, and suddenly she wheeled the pony in through an open gate-"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12015"],["title","Love under Fire (#5)"],["body","way. The house was large, painted white, of distinctly Southern architecture, the broad stone steps surmounted by rounded pillars. On the porch a man sat smoking. He arose instantly, hat in hand, and came down to meet us. His was a tall, slender, slightly stooped figure, a finely chiselled face, the hair and beard white. His eyes, apparently as keen as ever, instantly recognized the girl, his stern features relaxing into a smile of welcome.  \"I am surprised and pleased to greet you, Miss Willifred,\" cordially bowing over her extended hand. \"'Tis a long while since we have seen you here.\"  \"Not from any doubt of your hospitality, Judge, but the armies have made travelling unsafe.\"  \"True; we live in constant peril. The Yankees have driven off my negroes, and also robbed me of every horse on the place. Your father, the major, is well?\"  \"In most excellent health, thank you. He was wounded at Chattanooga, but soon recovered. We had him at home with us for a month.\"  \"So I heard. A young Louisiana officer, a Captain Le Gaire, gave me news of your family. He was through Jonesboro with a scouting party two days ago. He seemed very glad to talk about you, my dear.\"  The girl's face flushed, as she withdrew her hand, attempting a laugh.  \"We are excellent friends, yet really it does not require any deep interest to induce Captain Le Gaire to talk. That is one of his specialties.\"  \"I suspected as much, yet I found his conversation highly interesting. He is intelligent, and has travelled widely. But come, my dear, let me help you down. I am such an early bird I have breakfasted already, yet there will be something ready for you, and your companion.\"  His gaze surveyed me for the first time, and he stepped back, his eyes darkening suspiciously.  \"But what have you here--a Yankee?\"  \"So far as uniform goes, yes,\" she answered lightly, descending over the wheel, and adroitly dodging a direct reply. \"But all things are not as they seem, outwardly. Surely, Judge, you do not suppose I would ever harbor one of the enemy? If I vouch for the gentleman it should be sufficient.\"  He took my hand cordially enough, yet with a question still in his keen old eyes.  \"I am glad to know you, sir. Any friend of Miss Willifred's is a friend of mine, but I'm damned if I like that color.\"  \"The nature of my mission makes it necessary,\" I explained.  \"Exactly, sir, exactly; I understand perfectly. Alight, and come in, but you wear the first Yankee uniform ever welcomed to my house. Come right along, both of you. I've got one servant left, who will attend the pony.\"  Twenty minutes later we were breakfasting together in a cool, spacious room the windows of which opened upon the porch. The judge, after satisfying himself that we were being well served, had disappeared, leaving us alone. It was a beautiful morning, the birds singing outside, the sunlight sifting through the branches of the great oaks shading the windows. Not a sound, other than the rustling of leaves, broke the silence. My companion appeared disinclined to talk, her eyes turned away from me. The constraint became so marked I endeavored to start conversation, but with poor result.  \"Our meeting has been an odd one,\" I began, \"romantic enough to form a basis for fiction.\"  Her glance shifted to my face.  \"Do you think so? I merely find it extremely embarrassing.\"  \"Then I will withdraw at once,\" I insisted, hurt by the indifference of her voice. \"I had supposed you wished me to remain until now--surely your words implied this.\"  \"Oh, yes! I did, and you are in no way to blame. It was an impulse, and I failed to realize that it would involve deceit to an old friend. Perhaps I am too easily hurt, but I am afraid Judge Moran half suspects the truth. Anyway you must go immediately.\"  \"We shall part as friends?\"  She hesitated, as though considering the full intent of my request.  \"Hardly that, Lieutenant Galesworth. The word 'friend' should mean much, and we are merely chance acquaintances--politically enemies.\"  \"I had hoped that difference--merely the accident of war--might have been swept aside. It has no personal weight with me, and I supposed you were of broader mind.\"  \"I am,\" she responded earnestly. \"Some of my best friends are Northerners, wearing that uniform, but, as it chances, we have met in war, playing at cross-purposes. You are a Federal scout whom I have unwittingly helped through the Confederate lines. Surely I have done enough already to help you--perhaps to injure the cause I love--without being asked for more. Under other conditions we might continue friends, but not as matters stand.\"  \"Yet later--when the war ends?\"  \"It is useless to discuss what may occur then. There is little likelihood we shall ever meet after to-day. Indeed, I have no wish that we should.\"  It was a dismissal so clearly expressed I could only bow, wondering what it was I saw in the depths of her eyes which seemed almost to contradict the utterance of the lips.  \"You leave me no choice.\"  \"There is none. I have no desire to be considered an enemy, and there is no possibility for us to become friends. We are but the acquaintances of a chance meeting.\" She held out her hand across the table, the impulsive movement robbing her words of their sting. \"You understand this is not indifference, but necessity.\"  I clasped closely the white fingers extended toward me, my heart throbbing, but my lips held prisoners by her eyes.  \"Yes, I understand perfectly, but I make no promise.\"  \"No promise! What do you mean?\"  \"Only that to my mind this is no mere chance acquaintance, nor is it destined to end here. Sometime I am going to know you, and we are going to be friends.\"  \"Indeed!\" her eyes dropped, the shadow of lashes on her cheeks. \"You are very audacious to say that.\"  \"Yet you are not altogether sorry to hear me say it.\"  \"Oh, I do not take your words seriously at all. They are mere Yankee boasting--\"  She stopped suddenly, the slight flush fading from her cheeks as she arose to her feet, staring out through the open window. It was the sound of horses' hoofs on the gravel roadway, and I sprang up also, endeavoring to see. A squad of troopers was without, dusty, hard-riding fellows, uniformed in Confederate gray.    CHAPTER VI  A BOLD FRONT  It was but a glimpse through the leaf-draped window of dust-caked horses, the bronzed faces of their riders, and the gray hair of Judge Moran, as he hastened down the steps to greet them. I saw one man swing down from his saddle, and advance toward the house, then a sharp catching of the girl's breath drew my attention toward her, and our eyes met.  \"You--you must not suppose I expected this,\" she faltered, \"--that I have betrayed you.\"  There was no doubting her earnestness, nor her disgust at such treachery.  \"Not for a moment. But I must get away. Are you acquainted with the house?\"  \"Yes; but two of the men rode around to the well. It would be impossible now to slip out the back way without discovery.\" She ran across the room, and flung open a door. \"Go in there and lie down; pretend to be asleep. If the judge does not inform them of your presence here it may never be suspected. If he does I must cling to the old story.\"  I caught her hands, and in the excitement she seemed scarcely aware of the act.  \"You are willing to do this for me?\"  \"I don't know what I do it for,\" a little nervous laugh in her voice. \"When one once gets started into deceit there seems to be no end--but go quick! the officer is coming now.\"  The room into which I was thrust was darkened by lowered shades, but the bookcases lining the walls proclaimed it a library. A comfortable leather couch occupied the space between the two windows. The door remained half an inch ajar, and, before I could close it, some one entered the dining-room. The first words uttered held me silent, listening. There was a heavy step on the uncarpeted floor, the jingle of spurs, and a startled exclamation from the girl.  \"You! Why, I had no thought of meeting you here.\"  \"Yet I trust you are not sorry,\" the voice deep, yet so low I lost an occasional word. \"Judge Moran says you bear--\"  \"Hush,\" she interrupted quickly. \"Yes, and they must go on at once. What brings you here, Gerald? A scouting party?\"  \"We are Beauregard's advance scouts; he is moving eastward.\"  \"Then these papers must reach him at once. Don't stop to ask questions, Gerald, but send some man; have him kill his horse if necessary. Oh, don't stand there looking at me, but go! I'll explain later.\"  I heard the rustle of papers, the rapid movement of the man as he left the room, the quick breathing of the excited woman. Then she crossed the room to the window, and the next moment a horse galloped past. My head whirled--then it was not quinine for the hospitals which had brought her through the lines; she had deliberately lied to me, and instead, was a bearer of despatches. Sudden anger at the trick banished every other feeling; yet what could I do? My hand gripped the knob of the door, every nerve throbbing, when I heard the officer's voice again in the breakfast room.  \"He's off; now let's have the straight of all this, Billie.\"  Billie! I grasped the full truth of it in an instant. Lord! I had been a fool. The woman had played with me as though I were a mere child; had been laughing at me all night; and doubtless intended now to hand me over prisoner to this squad of gray-jackets. Billie! The very person I was seeking; the only one who could hope to get through after all others had failed. And I had supposed \"Billie\" was a man, never once thinking of the name as a pet feminine one of the South. The realization of all this confused me so that I missed a part of what was being said, and only aroused as the man spoke more sharply.  \"That's all right, of course; I understand what brought you here, but where is that fellow you had with you?\"  \"Who?\" it was an indignant voice.  \"Oh, you understand, Miss Innocence,\" a slight sneer in the utterance. \"The"]]]
