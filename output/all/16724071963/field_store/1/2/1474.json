Now he calls her softly by name, and whispers almost inaudibly, \"Elise!\"  She started and looked up, but saw no one, and as she recovered herself, she sighed gently, and said: \"I was mistaken, it was only the wind.\"  But again he whispered: \"Start not, Elise; do not utter a word or cry!\"  \"O God!\" murmured she in a low tone, trembling in all her limbs. An ardent embrace, a glowing kiss upon her brow, and a well-beloved voice whispered her name.  \"Feodor!\" uttered she faintly. Overcome by the sudden violence of her feelings, her head dropped languidly on his breast. Then, drawing herself up, she gazed at him, and her eager, loving look encountered his flashing eye. She was, as it were, fascinated--happy as in a dream, and yet conscious of the most delicious waking.  \"Do you know me, Elise? Do you recognize your Feodor in spite of his disguise?\"  \"Oh, speak again,\" said she as he ceased. \"It is so long since I have heard your voice!\"  \"Ten weeks have passed,\" said he, pressing her still closer to his heart, \"without my being able to see you or convey to you any information. I could endure it no longer. I said to myself, 'God is the friend of lovers,' and so I disguised myself as you see me, and ventured here.\"  Elise started up and gazed at him anxiously. Awaking from her ecstasy of delight, she just began to be conscious of the present.  \"Good heavens!\" she cried, \"danger threatens you.\"  \"Death, if I am found here!\" said he, solemnly--\"death, if it is known in the Russian camp why I came here!\"  She uttered a cry, and clung anxiously to him. \"You should not have come here,\" said she, trembling. \"My God, if my father should find you here! It was cruel of you to come.\"  \"It would have been more cruel,\" said he, smiling, \"if being so near you, I had not come at all. I have watched and yearned so long for this meeting; I have longed so to read in your eyes that you have not forgotten me! Why do you cast them down, Elise?\"  \"Because, Feodor, you have already read too much in them, more than my father would ever forgive.\"  \"Your father was always kind and friendly toward me but at that time I was his prisoner, now he regards me only as the enemy of his country; and yet, Elise, my object here is any thing but that of an enemy. It is not only the desire but also the anxiety of love which brings me here. Listen to me--my time is limited, and I am lost if I linger too long; but I had to see you to warn you, to avert the danger which threatens you, and all of you. Listen, therefore. Your father is the most powerful and influential man in Berlin. His influence will go far with the council and the citizens. Entreat him, Elise, to use all his influence to avert a terrible bloodshed from this city.\"  Elise shook her head seriously and sadly. Her sweet dream was dissipated; she was now no longer the dreaming, loving girl, but a conscious, reasoning, collected woman.  \"How can my father do that?\" said she, doubtingly.  \"He must persuade the citizens to yield without fighting.\"  \"That my father will never do,\" said she, warmly.  \"Yes, he will do it,\" replied her lover, \"when he learns that all fighting is useless. Let him have compassion on his native town, on himself. You are all lost if you fight. Already twelve thousand of our men, under General Tottleben, stand before the gates. At this moment, while I am speaking, Tschernitscheff, with twenty thousand regulars, is approaching from the other side. Count Lacy, too, with his Austrians, is drawing near. All this tell your father. Tell him, also, that General Tottleben has promised our Empress Elizabeth to take Berlin, if he has to lay it in ruins and ashes. Use all your influence, implore him to do all in his power to persuade the citizens to a peaceful surrender.\"  \"I have no influence over my father,\" said she, sadly, \"and if I had I would not abuse it. Such a surrender, without a fight, would be cowardice.\"  \"But a fight, with the assured certainty of defeat, would be madness. Your father does not know the number of troops massed around Berlin. Do you tell him.\"  She looked at him mournfully. \"And shall I tell him, too, from whom I received this information?\"  After a little reflection, he replied: \"Yes, if it cannot be otherwise, tell him. Your father will not betray me.\"  \"No, but he will curse his daughter,\" cried Elise, painfully--\"curse her for having had intercourse with our country's enemy, while the Russian cannon threaten our town. No, no, Feodor, it were no use to warn him. My father would not listen to me.\"  \"So Berlin will run toward its ruin, and I cannot prevent it,\" said the colonel, sadly. \"I have done all in my power. I wish to requite your father for all the kindness he has shown me, and for that reason I risked my life in order to warn him.\"  \"Believe me, Feodor, I will never forget you for it,\" said she, offering him both her hands. \"However angry my father may be, my heart still remains yours. Love does not recognize any national hatred. It yields itself without reserve to him who has won it.\"  She leaned her head upon his breast, and he imprinted a kiss upon her forehead.  \"Thank you for these words,\" said he; \"wherever I go they shall be my talisman.\"  \"Are you going already?\" asked she, anxiously.  \"I must go, Elise,\" replied he.  \"Oh, Feodor, I dare not bid you stay. I tremble at the thought of my father seeing you,\" sighed she; \"but when, my beloved, when shall we see each other again?\"  He looked at her a long time with a steady, piercing glance. He then exclaimed, almost rudely: \"You have sworn me love and constancy till death. Do you remember it?\"  \"I remember it, and never will I be faithless to my vow,\" whispered she, smiling through her tears.  \"You swore to me never to belong to any one but me. Have you forgotten that?\"  \"No, I have not.\"  \"Well, then,\" said he, rising, \"we shall soon see each other again.\"  \"When, Feodor, when?\"  \"When Berlin is in our hands,\" said he, smiling proudly; \"when we enter your gates as conquerors.\"  She shuddered painfully. He saw it, and a hateful, mocking expression passed across his features; but this lasted only a moment, and his changeable countenance appeared again bright and loving. He took Elise's hand and pressed it to his lips.  \"Will you, even at such a time, allow me to see you? Will you, faithful to your vow, remember that my Elise has sworn by God and her love never to turn a deaf ear to my call? Will you expect me?\" asked he, coaxingly.  \"I will,\" answered she, in a low voice.  \"And I will come,\" cried he, passionately, \"if the way to you leads over mountains of dead bodies!\"  She threw herself into his open arms, and nestled like a timid dove on his breast.  \"Oh!\" cried she, \"when danger threatens you, then I think I would like to be a man to share it with you.\"  He covered her lips and eyes with kisses. \"Farewell, farewell, Elise; and if it is God's will, we will meet again.\"  One last kiss, one last embrace, and he tore himself from her arms and hurried toward the wall. Now he climbs it, and throws his last greetings to her, then descends on the other side.  \"He is gone, he is gone!\" she shrieked, and, falling on her knees, raised her hands to heaven. \"O God, have mercy on me, have pity on my love!\"  It seemed as if God did grant her prayer, for a thick veil sank over her eyes, and a swoon robbed her of consciousness.         *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER V.  MR. KRETSCHMER, OF THE VOSSIAN GAZETTE.   The editor of the _Vossian Gazette_, Mr. Kretschmer, sat at his desk, busily writing. That he was a learned man was seen by his earnest, care-worn forehead, his large, well-powdered wig, and above all by the disorder and confusion which reigned in the whole room. Besides which, Mr. Kretschmer wore a dressing-gown, thickly sprinkled with ink-spots, the official robe of his literary dignity. And whosoever beheld him in this robe, his long pipe in his mouth, filling the room with a thick blue smoke, seated on his high tripod before his desk, could not but believe that Mr. Kretschmer was a learned man.  But more than this, he was a great politician. Thereto testified the numerous journals which lay scattered about on the floor, but more especially the nineteen quarto volumes, which stood above on the book-shelf, lettered in gold on the back, \"VOSSIAN GAZETTE,\" and under that the number of the year, from 1740 to 1759. The _Vossian Gazette_ was then a young, blooming rose, of scarcely nineteen summers. It could still pass for a vigorous, handsome, and perhaps even innocent young maiden; and Mr. Kretschmer was the editor of the _Vossian Gazette_. Had he not, then, a right to be regarded as a great politician?  Mr. Kretschmer was at this moment occupied in writing an article for the next morning's paper, and as he had just received news \"by special courier\" of another battle, subsequent to that of Liegnitz, which had resulted favorably for the Prussians, he was composing, with the courage of a lion, an extra, which fairly glowed with ardent hatred against the oppressors and cannibals, namely, the Russians and the Austrians; and declared that the salvation of all Germany depended on the supreme dominion of Prussia.  The bold editor of the _Vossian Gazette_ in this article called upon the people to fly to arms against the \"incendiary oppressors of Freedom and the people's rights,\" as he called the Russians; he exhorted even the women and girls to fight, and called upon them to grasp the sword in their tender hands instead of the needle. Finally, he entreated all Berlin, if ever the _incendiary enemy_ should approach the gates, rather to let the whole city be destroyed by fire, and bury themselves in the ruins before they submitted to the foe.  Mr. Kretschmer then laid his pen down, and revised with a satisfied look what he had written.  \"That will have an effect,\" said he, rubbing his hands together, delighted. \"When his majesty, our heroic king, returns"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12016"],["title","The Merchant of Berlin: An Historical Novel (#6)"],["body","to Berlin, I will send him this sheet of the _Vossian Gazette_, and I know that he will be satisfied with my heroism.\"  He looked again at the paper. \"Beautiful, beautiful!\" exclaimed he, with a self-satisfied smile. \"My pen has shot nothing less than bomb-shells and grape, and my ink has turned into whole streams of the enemy's blood. And why should I not be bold, it being perfectly safe, since the king must certainly be victorious, and the enemy has no idea of visiting Berlin? Tschernitscheff and Tottleben are quietly encamped on the other side of the Oder; Soltikoff with his army is near Frankfort; and Count Lacy with his Austrians is waiting an opportunity to give battle to our king. Thus, as I said, I can safely exhort the good citizens of Berlin to defend themselves heroically against the infamous spoiler. How beautifully this peroration sounds: 'People of Berlin! rather let yourselves be buried under the ruins of your burning city than submit to an incendiary enemy!'--_Incendiary_,\" repeated he thoughtfully, \"that is rather a strong expression, and if the Russians do come, they will revenge themselves for it; but, pshaw! the Russians are not coming, and I can safely send this article to the press. And, furthermore, did not the king himself stigmatize the Russians as such? Yes, I remember last year, after the unfortunate invasion of the Russians, he looked down from the steeple in Frankfort upon the devastation of the country, and cried out with angry indignation, 'Incendiaries! incendiaries!' The expression is at least official, and can therefore remain.\"  Mr. Kretschmer seized the bell-rope, and began to ring violently. Immediately the door opened, and a small boy entered with a portfolio under his arm.  \"Devil,\" said Mr. Kretschmer, majestically, \"here is my article; run as fast as you can to the printing-office with it, and impress upon the compositor the necessity of haste, and, above all things, not to make such mistakes as he did lately, when, in speaking of the Russians, he put 'friends' instead of 'fiends,' which was an unpardonable and most treasonable error of expression.\"  The little boy took the paper and laid it in his portfolio.  \"The printer told me to ask you,\" said he, \"if you had written nothing yet for the 'Miscellaneous.' _Spener's Journal_ had yesterday such a beautiful 'Miscellaneous,' and told about a woman who had four children at a birth, and a stork which had arrived and built its nest, although it was the month of October.\"  Mr. Kretschmer frowned. \"_Spener's Journal_ always has some wonderful news, and amuses the Berlin people with all kinds of stupid gossip,\" grumbled he. \"The rivalry of such a paper is unbearable.\"  \"Well, how about the miscellaneous intelligence?\" asked the printer's boy.  Mr. Kretschmer stamped his foot angrily. \"Go to the devil!\" said he.  At this moment there was heard a loud crying and shouting; and while the printer's boy pitched out of the door, Mr. Kretschmer hurried to the window to find out the cause of the uproar.  A heaving, noisy crowd filled the street below, and had halted right under the editor's window. In the midst thereof was seen the tall, lank figure of a man, whose extraordinary appearance enchained the attention of the multitude, and excited afresh their shouts and derisive laughter. And, in fact, nothing could be more striking or fantastic than this man. Notwithstanding the cool October weather, his gigantic figure was clothed from head to foot in gray linen, harmonizing strangely with the gray color of his skin and hair, which latter fell in long locks from his uncovered head down on his shoulders, and gave to the apparition the semblance of a pyramidical ash-heap, out of which his eyes shone like two burning coals. Around his shoulders hung a long cloak of gray linen, which, in addressing the multitude, he sometimes threw around him in picturesque folds, sometimes spread out wide, enveloping his long arms in it, so that he looked like an expanded bat.  \"Ah! it is Pfannenstiel, our prophetic linen-weaver,\" said Mr. Kretschmer, smiling, as he opened his window, and exchanged a look of recognition with the man who was gazing up at him.  The linen-weaver and prophet had rapidly acquired some renown in Berlin by his prophecies and predictions. The people believed in his mystic words and soothsayings and mistaken fanaticism. He related to them his visions and apparitions; he told about the angels and the Lord Jesus, who often visited him; about the Virgin Mary, who appeared in his room every night, and inspired him with what he was to say to the people, and gave him pictures whose mystic signification he was to interpret to them. The prophet possessed more than a hundred of these pictures, given him by celestial apparitions. He had them carefully pasted together, and rolled up always with him. These pictorial sheets, roughly painted on coarse paper, served the linen-weaver in lieu of cards or coffee-grounds, for the purpose of prophesying to the people and announcing the future to them; and the good folks of Berlin believed in these prophecies with firm faith, and listened with devout confidence to the words of their prophet.  Pfannenstiel was in the act of unrolling his pictures, and the multitude, which, just before, had been shouting and screaming, became suddenly silent, and gazed up at the weaver with intense expectation. A breathless silence ensued, and, far down the street, sounded the prophet's loud and sonorous voice. He pointed to the last of his pictures, which, in coarse, clumsy drawing, represented a town, from the houses of which flames arose in the most variegated colors.  \"Behold! behold!\" cried the prophet, \"and fall on your knees and pray! Yes, pray! for I tell you the Holy Ghost appeared to me, His wings dripping with blood, and in His burning and flaming beak He held this picture which I now show you.\"  \"Well, then, how is it that the picture is not burnt too, if the Holy Ghost held it in His burning beak?\" asked an impudent shoemaker's boy.  A low laugh ran through the crowd, but this was soon suppressed by angry, threatening voices, commanding silence and quiet.  The prophet turned with an air of majestic composure toward the questioner: \"Why was not this picture burnt? Because God wished to perform a miracle, to manifest Himself to me in His glory, and to prove to me that this vision was from Him, and not from the devil. Yes, indeed, God gave me this picture that we might be warned--not to terrify us. Listen, therefore, to my voice, and learn what God announces to you from my mouth.\"  \"I would like indeed to hear what the stupid rascal is going to announce to these poor foolish devils,\" muttered Mr. Kretschmer, leaning out of the window and listening attentively.  Pfannenstiel continued: \"Behold these columns of fire rising from the houses of this town. This town is Berlin, and the fire will burst out of the roofs of your houses. Woe! woe! will sound in your streets, and weeping and lamentation will fill the air. I say unto you, watch and pray! Strew ashes on your heads, and fall down on your knees and pray to God for mercy, for the enemy is before your gates, and ere the sun sets the Russians will enter your town! I say unto you, verily I say unto you, God spoke to me in a voice of thunder, and said, 'The Russians are coming!' Fall down and pray, for the Russians are coming!\"  \"The Russians are coming!\" cried the terrified multitude and some among them turned pale. The weeping women folded their hands in prayer; the men looked around timidly, and the frightened children clung to their mothers in dread of the Russians, whose name was synonymous with that of savages and cannibals. Even Kretschmer could not help feeling somewhat terrified. He drew back thoughtfully from the window, muttering with a shudder, \"The Russians are coming!\"  The people crowded around the prophet in still narrower circles, and in more piercing tones wept and cried out: \"What shall we do? What shall we do to be saved? Have mercy, O God! Have mercy on Berlin, for the Russians are coming!\"  \"Yes, they are coming!\" cried Pfannenstiel. \"God told me so in the roll of His thunder and the lightning of His eyes; and he said to me: 'Go and say to the people of Berlin, \"The Russians are coming!\" and thou shalt see in the same hour how their hearts will shrink, and how cast down they will be; how their eyes will run tears, and their lips utter prayers, for the Russian is the sworn enemy of the Berlin people; and as often as the cry, \"The Russians are coming,\" sounds through the streets of Berlin, there will be wailing and lamentation in every house and every heart; and they will bow down in timid contrition and abject obedience. Speak, therefore, to them, and say, \"The Russians are coming!\" that they may become humble and quiet; that the proud word may be silenced on their lips, and that they may submit in peace.'\"  \"What shall we do?\" asked the people. \"Help us, advise us, for thou art our prophet.\"  Pfannenstiel drew himself up to his utmost height, and an expression of triumphant cunning sparkled in his eyes. \"Do you not understand the voice of God? God commands you to withdraw in silence and peace to your own dwellings, to weep and pray. Go, then! Let the word of your mouth and the rebelliousness of your hearts be silent. Go home to your huts, shut the doors and windows, and do not venture out, for without, death and the Russians await you!\"  Obedient to the voice of their prophet, the crowd separated in different directions, and dispersed quietly.  Pfannenstiel looked after them with a smile of scorn; then silently rolled up his pictures, threw his gray cloak over his shoulders, and, casting a serious and significant look up at Mr. Kretschmer's window, strode down the street slowly and with an air of majestic dignity.         *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER VI.
