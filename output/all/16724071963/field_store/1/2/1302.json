And one did fall, just as they were going through, and came smashing down in the path at their feet. Nakwisi ran to pick it up and the guide said she might have it, adding that such a bunch, unbruised, sold for twenty-five cents in the city market. \"Oh, how delicious!\" cried Nakwisi,' tasting the grapes and dividing them among the girls. Mrs. Evans bought a basketful and let them eat all they wanted. In some of the hothouses tangerines were growing, and in some persimmons, while others were given over to the raising of roses, carnations and rare orchids. It was a trip through fairyland for the girls, and they could hardly tear themselves away when the time came.  \"There is something else I must show you while we are in the neighborhood,\" said Mrs. Evans, as they passed through Akron. \"Does anybody know what two historical things are near here?\" Nobody knew. Mrs. Evans began humming, \"John Brown's Body Lies A-mouldering in the Grave.\"  \"What has that to do with it?\" asked Gladys.  \"Everything, with one of them,\" said Mrs. Evans.  \"Did you know that John Brown, owner of the said body, was born in Akron, and there is a monument here to his memory?\"  \"Oh how lovely,\" cried Migwan, \"let us see it.\" So Mrs. Evans drove them over to the monument and they all stood around it and sang \"John Brown's Body\" in his honor.  \"Now, what's the other thing?\" they asked.  \"I believe I know,\" said Nyoda. \"Doesn't the old Portage Trail run through here somewhere?\"  \"That's it,\" said Mrs. Evans.  Then Nyoda told them about the Portage Path of Indian days, before the canal was built, that extended from Lake Erie to the Ohio River. \"The part that runs through Akron is still called Portage Path,\" said Mrs. Evans, and the girls were eager to see it.  \"Why, it's nothing but a paved street!\" exclaimed Migwan in disappointment, when they had reached the historical spot.  \"That's all it is now,\" answered Mrs. Evans, \"but it is built over the old Portage Trail, and some of these old trees undoubtedly shaded the original path.\" In the minds of the girls the handsome residences faded from sight, and in place of the wide street they saw the narrow path trailing off through the forest, with dusky forms stealing along it on their long journey southward.  \"It's time to strike our own trail now,\" said Nyoda, breaking the silence, and they started back to the river. Every one was anxious to make it as pleasant as possible for Hinpoha, and the jests came thick and fast as they drove along. \"Who is the best Latin scholar here?\" asked Nyoda.  \"I am,\" said Sahwah, mischievously.  \"Then you can undoubtedly tell me what Caesar said on the Fourth of July, 45 B.C.\" said Nyoda.  \"I don't seem to recollect,\" said Sahwah.  \"Then read for yourself,\" said Nyoda, scribbling a few words on a leaf from her notebook and handing it to her.  \"What's this?\" said Sahwah, spelling out the words. On the paper was written,  _Quis crudis enim rufus, albus et expiravit._  Sahwah tried to translate. \"_Quis,_ who; _crudis_, raw; _enim_--what's _enim_?\"  \"For,\" answered Migwan.  \"And _expiravit_\" said Sahwah, \"what's that from?\"  \"_Expiro_\" answered Migwan, \"_expirare, expiravi, expiratus_. It means 'blow,' '_Expiravit_' is 'have blown.'\"  \"_Rufus_ is 'red,'\" continued Sahwah, \"and is _albus_ 'white'?\" Migwan nodded, and Sahwah went back to the beginning and began to read: \"_Who raw for red white and have blown._\"  Nyoda shouted. \"That last word is _blew_, not _have blown_\" she said.  \"I have it!\" cried Migwan, jumping up. \"It's '_Who raw for the red, white and blew.' 'Hoorah for the red, white and blue!_'\"  \"Such wit!\" said Sahwah, laughing with the rest.  \"Now, I'll make a motto for Sahwah,\" said Migwan, seizing the pencil. Migwan was a Senior and took French, and having a sudden inspiration, she wrote, \"_Pas de lieu Rhone que nous!_\" The girls could not translate it and Nyoda puzzled over it for a long time.  \"I don't seem to be able to make anything out of it,\" she said at length.  \"Don't try to translate it,\" said Migwan, \"just read it out loud,\" Nyoda complied and Sahwah caught it immediately.  \"It's '_Paddle your own canoe!_\" she cried.  Thus, laughing and joking, they followed the road back to the dam and embarked in the launch with all speed, for the sun was already sinking beneath the treetops and they had a two-hour ride ahead of them. Mrs. Evans took Hinpoha back in the machine and delivered her to her aunt safe and sound at eight o'clock, with many expressions of pleasure at the fun she had had with the Camp Fire Girls, which were intended as seeds to be planted in Aunt Phoebe's mind.  \"I think your mother's a perfect dear,\" said Sahwah to Gladys on the trip home. \"I used to be frightened to death of her, because she always looked so straight-laced and proper, but she isn't like that at all. She's a regular Camp Fire Girl!\"     CHAPTER V.   A COASTING PARTY.  The memory of that happy day sustained Hinpoha through many of the trials that came to her in the days that followed. It seemed that everything she did brought down the wrath of her aunt in some way or another. For instance, she left a bottle of bees standing on the table in her room, and Aunt Phoebe's dog Silky, who had been in the habit of going into the room and chewing Hinpoha's painted paddle, knocked the bottle over and let the bees out, getting badly stung in the process. Then there was a scene with Aunt Phoebe because she had brought the bees in. This and a dozen more incidents of a similar nature made Hinpoha despair of ever gaining the good will of her aunt. Thus the autumn wore away to winter and as yet the Desert of Waiting had borne nothing but thorns.  Gladys's progress through school was like the advance of a conquering hero. Although she had just entered this fall she was already one of the most popular girls in school. She had that fair, delicate prettiness which invariably appeals to boys, and an open, unaffected manner which endeared her to the girls. Beside her very lovable personality she had a background which was almost certain to insure popularity to a girl. She was rich and lived in a great house on a fashionable avenue; she had a little electric car all her own, and she wore the smartest clothes of any girl in school. Her fame as a dancer soon spread and she was in constant demand at school entertainments. Nyoda watched her a trifle anxiously at first. She was just a little afraid that Gladys's head would be turned with all the homage paid her, or that, blinded by her present success, she would lose the deeper meanings of life and be nothing but a butterfly after all. But she need not have feared. Gladys's experience in camp had kindled a fire in her that would never be extinguished as long as life guarded the flame. Having changed her Camp Fire name from Butterfly to Real Woman, she was anxious to prove her right to the name. So she worked diligently to win new honors which made her efficient in the home as well as those which helped her to shine in society.  Mrs. Evans was returning from an afternoon card party. She was tired and her head ached and she felt out of sorts. A remark which she had overheard during the afternoon stayed in her mind and made her cross. Two ladies on the other side of a large screen near which she was sitting were discussing a campaign in which they were interested to raise funds for a certain philanthropy. \"I am going to ask Mrs. Evans if she would not like to subscribe one hundred dollars,\" said the one lady.  \"So much?\" asked the other in an uncertain voice, \"I don't believe I would if I were you.\"  \"Why not?\" asked the first lady.  \"Haven't you heard,\" replied the second lady, with the air of imparting a delicious secret, \"that Mr. Evans is on the verge of financial ruin?\"  \"No,\" replied the second in a tone of lively interest, \"I haven't. Who told you so?\"  \"A great many people are saying so,\" continued the first. \"Do you know that they took their daughter out of the private school she had been attending and sent her to public school this year? They must be hard up if they can't pay school bills any more.\"  \"It certainly looks like it,\" said the first lady.  \"Possibly I had better not ask Mrs. Evans for any subscription at all. It might embarrass her, poor thing.\" The voices trailed off and Mrs. Evans was left feeling decidedly annoyed. She was the kind of woman who rarely discussed other people's affairs, and likewise disliked having her own discussed by other people. The thought that some folks might misconstrue Gladys's entering the public school to mean that her father was about to fail in business, first amused, and then irritated her. Nothing like that could be farther from correct, but the thought came to her that such rumors floating around might have some effect on Mr. Evans's standing in the business world. She began to wonder if after all it had not been a mistake to take Gladys out of Miss Russell's school in the middle of her course.  Thinking cynical thoughts about the gossiping abilities of most people, she drove up the long driveway and entered the house. The long hall with its wide staircase and large, splendidly furnished rooms opening on either side, struck her as being cold and gloomy. The polished chairs and tables shone dully in the fast waning light of the December afternoon, cheerless and unfriendly looking. The house suddenly seemed to her to be less a home than a collection of furniture. For the moment she almost hated the wealth which made it necessary to maintain this vast and magnificent display. The women she had played cards with that afternoon seemed shallow and artificial. Life was decidedly uninteresting just then. She went upstairs and took off her wraps and came down again, aimlessly. Gladys was nowhere in sight, which made the house seem lonelier than ever, for with Gladys around "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11719"],["title","Kincaid's Battery (#0)"],["body","KINCAID'S BATTERY  BY  GEORGE W.

Kincaid's Battery   I   CARROLLTON GARDENS  For the scene of this narrative please take into mind a wide quarter-circle of country, such as any of the pretty women we are to know in it might have covered on the map with her half-opened fan.  Let its northernmost corner be Vicksburg, the famous, on the Mississippi. Let the easternmost be Mobile, and let the most southerly and by far the most important, that pivotal corner of the fan from which all its folds radiate and where the whole pictured thing opens and shuts, be New Orleans. Then let the grave moment that gently ushers us in be a long-ago afternoon in the Louisiana Delta.  Throughout that land of water and sky the willow clumps dotting the bosom of every sea-marsh and fringing every rush-rimmed lake were yellow and green in the full flush of a new year, the war year, 'Sixty-one.  Though rife with warm sunlight, the moist air gave distance and poetic charm to the nearest and humblest things. At the edges of the great timbered swamps thickets of young winter-bare cypresses were budding yet more vividly than the willows, while in the depths of those overflowed forests, near and far down their lofty gray colonnades, the dwarfed swamp-maple drooped the winged fruit of its limp bush in pink and flame-yellow and rose-red masses until it touched its own image in the still flood.  That which is now only the \"sixth district\" of greater New Orleans was then the small separate town of Carrollton. There the vast Mississippi, leaving the sugar and rice fields of St. Charles and St. John Baptist parishes and still seeking the Gulf of Mexico, turns from east to south before it sweeps northward and southeast again to give to the Creole capital its graceful surname of the \"Crescent City.\" Mile-wide, brimful, head-on and boiling and writhing twenty fathoms deep, you could easily have seen, that afternoon, why its turfed levee had to be eighteen feet high and broad in proportion. So swollen was the flood that from any deck of a steamboat touching there one might have looked down upon the whole fair still suburb.  Widely it hovered in its nest of rose gardens, orange groves, avenues of water-oaks, and towering moss-draped pecans. A few hundred yards from the levee a slender railway, coming from the city, with a highway on either side, led into its station-house; but mainly the eye would have dwelt on that which filled the interval between the nearer high road and the levee--the \"Carrollton Gardens.\"  At a corner of these grounds closest to the railway station stood a quiet hotel from whose eastern veranda it was but a step to the centre of a sunny shell-paved court where two fountains danced and tinkled to each other. Along its farther bound ran a vine-clad fence where a row of small tables dumbly invited the flushed visitor to be inwardly cooled. By a narrow gate in this fence, near its townward end, a shelled walk lured on into a musky air of verdurous alleys that led and misled, crossed, doubled, and mazed among flowering shrubs from bower to bower. Out of sight in there the loiterer came at startling moments face to face with banks of splendid bloom in ravishing negligee--Diana disrobed, as it were, while that untiring sensation-hunter, the mocking-bird, leaped and sang and clapped his wings in a riot of scandalous mirth.  In the ground-floor dining-room of that unanimated hotel sat an old gentleman named Brodnax, once of the regular army, a retired veteran of the Mexican war, and very consciously possessed of large means. He sat quite alone, in fine dress thirty years out of fashion, finishing a late lunch and reading a newspaper; a trim, hale man not to be called old in his own hearing. He had read everything intended for news or entertainment and was now wandering in the desert of the advertising columns, with his mind nine miles away, at the other end of New Orleans.  Although not that person whom numerous men of his acquaintance had begun affectionately to handicap with the perilous nickname of \"the ladies' man,\" he was thinking of no less than five ladies; two of one name and three of another. Flora Valcour and her French grandmother (as well as her brother of nineteen, already agog to be off in the war) had but lately come to New Orleans, from Mobile. On a hilly border of that smaller Creole city stood the home they had left, too isolated, with war threatening, for women to occupy alone. Mrs. Callender was the young widow of this old bachelor's life-long friend, the noted judge of that name, then some two years deceased. Constance and Anna were her step-daughters, the latter (if you would believe him) a counterpart of her long-lost, beautiful mother, whose rejection of the soldier's suit, when he was a mere lieutenant, was the well-known cause of his singleness. These Callender ladies, prompted by him and with a sweet modesty of quietness, had just armed a new field battery with its six splendid brass guns, and it was around these three Callenders that his ponderings now hung; especially around Anna and in reference to his much overprized property and two nephews: Adolphe Irby, for whom he had obtained the command of this battery, which he was to see him drill this afternoon, and Hilary Kincaid, who had himself cast the guns and who was to help the senior cousin conduct these evolutions.  The lone reader's glance loitered down a long row of slim paragraphs, each beginning with the same wee picture of a steamboat whether it proclaimed the _Grand Duke_ or the _Louis d'Or_, the _Ingomar_ bound for the \"Lower Coast,\" or the _Natchez_ for \"Vicksburg and the Bends.\" Shifting the page, he read of the Swiss Bell-Ringers as back again \"after a six years' absence,\" and at the next item really knew what he read. It was of John Owens' appearance, every night, as _Caleb Plummer_ in \"Dot,\" \"performance to begin at seven o'clock.\" Was it there Adolphe would this evening take his party, of which the dazzling Flora would be one and Anna, he hoped, another? He had proposed this party to Adolphe, agreeing to bear its whole cost if the nephew would manage to include in it Anna and Hilary. And Irby had duly reported complete success and drawn on him, but the old soldier still told his doubts to the newspaper.  \"Adolphe has habits,\" he meditated, \"but success is not one of them.\"  Up and down a perpendicular procession on the page he every now and then mentally returned the salute of the one little musketeer of the same height as the steamboat's chimneys, whether the Attention he challenged was that of the Continentals, the Louisiana Grays, Orleans Cadets, Crescent Blues or some other body of blithe invincibles. Yet his thought was still of Anna. When Adolphe, last year, had courted her, and the hopeful uncle had tried non-intervention, she had declined him--\"and oh, how wisely!\" For then back to his native city came Kincaid after years away at a Northern military school and one year across the ocean, and the moment the uncle saw him he was glad Adolphe had failed. But now if she was going to find Hilary as light-headed and cloying as Adolphe was thick-headed and sour, or if she must see Hilary go soft on the slim Mobile girl--whom Adolphe was already so torpidly enamored of--\"H-m-m-m!\"  Two young men who"]]]
