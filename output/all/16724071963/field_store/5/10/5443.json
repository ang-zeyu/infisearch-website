It is good that thou shouldest do thy will in the season of youth and the days of thy pleasure.  Yea, and I deem that thou shalt come back again great and worshipful; and I am called somewhat foreseeing. Only look to it that thou keep the pretty thing that I have just given thee.\"  \"Well,\" said the chapman, \"this is fine talk about pleasure and the doing of one's will; nevertheless a whole skin is good wares, though it be not to be cheapened in any market of the world.  Now, lord, go thou where thou wilt, whether I say go or abide; and forsooth I am no man of King Peter's, that I should stay thee.  As for the name of the next town, it is called Higham-on-the-Way, and is a big town plenteous of victuals, with strong walls and a castle, and a very rich abbey of monks:  and there is peace within its walls, because the father abbot wages a many men to guard him and his, and to uphold his rights against all comers; wherein he doth wisely, and also well.  For much folk flocketh to his town and live well therein; and there is great recourse of chapmen thither.  No better market is there betwixt this and Babylon.  Well, Sir Ralph, I rede thee if thou comest unhurt to Higham-on-the-Way, go no further for this time, but take service with the lord abbot, and be one of his men of war; thou may'st then become his captain if thou shouldest live; which would be no bad adventure for one who cometh from Upmeads.\"  Ralph looked no brighter for this word, and he answered nought to it: but said presently:  \"And what is to be looked for beyond Higham if one goeth further?  Dost thou know the land any further?\"  The carle smiled:  \"Yea forsooth, and down to the Wood Perilous, and beyond it, and the lands beyond the Wood; and far away through them.  I say not that I have been to the Dry Tree; but I have spoken to one who hath heard of him who hath seen it; though he might not come by a draught of the Well at the World's End.\"  Ralph's eyes flashed, and his cheeks reddened as he listened hereto; but he spake quietly:  \"Master Clement, how far dost thou make it to Higham-on-the-Way?\"  \"A matter of forty miles,\" said the Chapman; \"because, as thou wottest, if ye ride south from hence, ye shall presently bring your nose up against the big downs, and must needs climb them at once; and when ye are at the top of Bear Hill, and look south away ye shall see nought but downs on downs with never a road to call a road, and never a castle, or church, or homestead:  nought but some shepherd's hut; or at the most the little house of a holy man with a little chapel thereby in some swelly of the chalk, where the water hath trickled into a pool; for otherwise the place is waterless.\" Therewith he took a long pull at the tankard by his side, and went on:  \"Higham is beyond all that, and out into the fertile plain; and a little river hight Coldlake windeth about the meadows there; and it is a fair land; though look you the wool of the downs is good, good, good! I have foison of this year's fleeces with me.  Ye shall raise none such in Upmeads.\"  Ralph sat silent a little, as if pondering, and then he started up and said: \"Good master Clement, we have eaten thy meat and thank thee for that and other matters.  Wilt thou now be kinder, and bid thy boy bring round Falcon our horse; for we have far to go, and must begone straight-away.\"  \"Yea, lord,\" said Clement, \"even so will I do.\"  And he muttered under his breath; \"Thou talkest big, my lad, with thy 'we'; but thou art pressed lest Nicholas be here presently to fetch thee back; and to say sooth I would his hand were on thy shoulder even now.\"  Then he spake aloud again, and said:  \"I must now begone to my lads, and I will send one round with thy war-horse. But take my rede, my lord, and become the man of the Abbot of St. Mary's of Higham, and all will be well.\"  Therewith he edged himself out of the chamber, and the dame fell to making a mighty clatter with the vessel and trenchers and cups on the board, while Ralph walked up and down the chamber his war-gear jingling upon him.  Presently the dame left her table-clatter and came up to Ralph and looked kindly into his face and said:  \"Gossip, hast thou perchance any money?\"  He flushed up red, and then his face fell; yet he spake gaily: \"Yea, gossip, I have both white and red:  there are three golden crowns in my pouch, and a little flock of silver pennies: forsooth I say not as many as would reach from here to Upmeads, if they were laid one after the other.\"  She smiled and patted his cheek, and said:  \"Thou art no very prudent child, king's son.  But it comes into my mind that my master did not mean thee to go away empty-handed; else had he not departed and left us twain together.\"  Therewith she went to the credence that stood in a corner, and opened a drawer therein and took out a little bag, and gave it into Ralph's hand, and said:  \"This is the gift of the gossip; and thou mayst take it without shame; all the more because if thy father had been a worser man, and a harder lord he would have had more to give thee.  But now thou hast as much or more as any one of thy brethren.\"  He took the bag smiling and shame-faced, but she looked on him fondly and said:  \"Now I know not whether I shall lay old Nicholas on thine heels when he cometh after thee, as come he will full surely; or whether I shall suffer the old sleuth-hound nose out thy slot of himself, as full surely he will set on to it.\"  \"Thou mightest tell him,\" said Ralph, \"that I am gone to take service with the Abbot of St. Mary's of Higham:  hah?\"  She laughed and said:  \"Wilt thou do so, lord, and follow the rede of that goodman of mine, who thinketh himself as wise as Solomon?\"  Ralph smiled and answered her nothing.  \"Well,\" she said, \"I shall say what likes me when the hour is at hand. Lo, here! thine horse.  Abide yet a moment of time, and then go whither thou needs must, like the wind of the summer day.\"  Therewith she went out of the chamber and came back again with a scrip which she gave to Ralph and said:  \"Herein is a flask of drink for the waterless country, and a little meat for the way.  Fare thee well, gossip!  Little did I look for it when I rose up this morning and nothing irked me save the dulness of our town, and the littleness of men's doings therein, that I should have to cut off a piece of my life from me this morning, and say, farewell gossip, as now again I do.\"  Therewith she kissed him on either cheek and embraced him; and it might be said of her and him that she let him go thereafter; for though as aforesaid he loved her, and praised her kindness, he scarce understood the eagerness of her love for him; whereas moreover she saw him not so often betwixt Upmeads and Wulstead:  and belike she herself scarce understood it.  Albeit she was a childless woman.  So when he had got to horse, she watched him riding a moment, and saw how he waved his hand to her as he turned the corner of the market-place, and how a knot of lads and lasses stood staring on him after she lost sight of him.  Then she turned her back into the chamber and laid her head on the table and wept.  Then came in the goodman quietly and stood by her and she heeded him not.  He stood grinning curiously on her awhile, and then laid his hand on her shoulder, and said as she raised her face to him:  \"Sweetheart, it availeth nought; when thou wert young and exceeding fair, he was but a little babe, and thou wert looking in those days to have babes of thine own; and then it was too soon: and now that he is such a beauteous young man, and a king's son withal, and thou art wedded to a careful carle of no weak heart, and thou thyself art more than two-score years old, it is too late.  Yet thou didst well to give our lord the money.  Lo! here is wherewithal to fill up the lack in thy chest; and here is a toy for thee in place of the pair of beads thou gavest him; and I bid thee look on it as if I had given him my share of the money and the beads.\"  She turned to Clement, and took the bag of money, and the chaplet which he held out to her, and she said: \"God wot thou art no ill man, my husband, but would God I had a son like to him!\"  She still wept somewhat; but the chapman said:  \"Let it rest there, sweetheart! let it rest there!  It may be a year or twain before thou seest him again:  and then belike he shall be come back with some woman whom he loves better than any other; and who knows but in a way he may deem himself our son.  Meanwhile thou hast done well, sweetheart, so be glad.\"  Therewith he kissed her and went his ways to his merchandize, and she to the ordering of her house, grieved but not unhappy.    CHAPTER 4  Ralph Rideth the Downs   As for Ralph, he rode on with a merry heart, and presently came to an end of the plain country, and the great downs rose up before him with a white road winding up to the top of them.  Just before the slopes began to rise was a little thorp beside a stream, and thereby a fair church and a little house of Canons: so Ralph rode toward the church to see if therein were an altar of St. Nicholas, who was his good lord and patron, that he might ask of him a blessing on his journey.  But as he came up to the churchyard-gate he saw a great black horse tied thereto as if abiding some one; and as he lighted down from his saddle he saw a man coming hastily from out the church-door and striding swiftly toward the said gate.  He was a big man, and armed; for he had a bright steel sallet on his head, which covered his face all save the end of his chin; and plates he had on his legs and arms.  He wore a green coat over his armour, and thereon was wrought in gold an image of a tree leafless:  he had a little steel axe about his neck, and a great sword hung by his side.  Ralph stood looking on him with his hand on the latch of the gate, but when the man came thereto he tore it open roughly and shoved through at once, driving Ralph back, so that he well-nigh overset him,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/169"],["title","The Well at the World's End: A Tale (#4)"],["body"," so sprang to his horse and swung himself into the saddle, just as Ralph steadied himself and ruffled up to him, half drawing his sword from the scabbard the while.  But the man-at-arms cried out, \"Put it back, put it back!  If thou must needs deal with every man that shoveth thee in his haste, thy life is like to be but short.\"  He was settling himself in his saddle as he spoke, and now he shook his rein, and rode off speedily toward the hill-road.  But when he was so far off that Ralph might but see his face but as a piece of reddish colour, he reined up for a moment of time, and turning round in his saddle lifted up his sallet and left his face bare, and cried out as if to Ralph, \"The first time!\" And then let the head-piece fall again, and set spurs to his horse and gallopped away.  Ralph stood looking at him as he got smaller on the long white road, and wondering what this might mean, and how the unknown man should know him, if he did know him.  But presently he let his wonder run off him, and went his ways into the church, wherein he found his good lord and friend St. Nicholas, and so said a paternoster before his altar, and besought his help, and made his offering; and then departed and gat to horse again, and rode softly the way to the downs, for the day was hot.  The way was steep and winding, with a hollow cup of the hills below it, and above it a bent so steep that Ralph could see but a few yards of it on his left hand; but when he came to the hill's brow and could look down on the said bent, he saw strange figures on the face thereof, done by cutting away the turf so that the chalk might show clear.  A tree with leaves was done on that hill-side, and on either hand of it a beast like a bear ramping up against the tree; and these signs were very ancient.  This hill-side carving could not be seen from the thorp beneath, which was called Netherton, because the bent looked westward down into the hollow of the hill abovesaid; but from nigher to Wulstead they were clear to see, and Ralph had often beheld them, but never so nigh: and that hill was called after them Bear Hill.  At the top of it was an earth-work of the ancient folk, which also was called Bear Castle.  And now Ralph rode over the hill's brow into it; for the walls had been beaten down in places long and long ago.  Now he rode up the wall, and at the topmost of it turned and looked aback on the blue country which he had ridden through stretching many a league below, and tried if he could pick out Upmeads from amongst the diverse wealth of the summer land: but Upmeads Water was hidden, and he could see nothing to be sure of to tell him whereabouts the High House stood; yet he deemed that he could make out the Debateable Wood and the hills behind it well enough.  Then he turned his horse about, and had the down-country before him; long lines of hills to wit, one rising behind the other like the waves of a somewhat quiet sea: no trees thereon, nor houses that he might see thence: nought but a green road that went waving up and down before him greener than the main face of the slopes.  He looked at it all for a minute or two as the south-west wind went past his ears, and played a strange tune on the innumerable stems of the bents and the hard-stalked blossoms, to which the bees sang counterpoint.  Then the heart arose within him, and he drew the sword from the scabbard, and waved it about his head, and shook it toward the south, and cried out, \"Now, welcome world, and be thou blessed from one end to the other, from the ocean sea to the uttermost mountains!\"  A while he held the white steel in his fist, and then sheathed the blade, and rode down soberly over the turf bridge across the ancient fosse, and so came on to the green road made many ages before by an ancient people, and so trotted south along fair and softly.  Little is to be told of his journey through the downs: as he topped a low hill whereon were seven grave-mounds of the ancient folk in a row, he came on a shepherd lying amidst of his sheep: the man sprang to his feet when he heard horse-hoofs anigh him and saw the glint of steel, and he set his hand to a short spear which lay by him; but when he saw nought but Ralph, and heard how he gave him the sele of the day, he nodded his head in a friendly way, though he said nought in salutation; for the loneliness of the downs made the speech slow within him.  Again some two miles further on Ralph met a flock of sheep coming down a bent which the road climbed, and with them were three men, their drovers, and they drew nigh him as he was amidst of the sheep, so that he could scarce see the way.  Each of these three had a weapon; one a pole-axe, another a long spear, and the third a flail jointed and bound with iron, and an anlace hanging at his girdle.  So they stood in the way and hailed him when the sheep were gone past; and the man with the spear asked him whither away.  \"I am turned toward Higham-on-the-Way,\" quoth he; \"and how many miles shall I ride ere I get there?\"  Said one of them:  \"Little less than twenty, lord.\"  Now it was past noon two hours, and the day was hot; so whereas the faces of the men looked kind and friendly, albeit somewhat rugged, he lighted down from his horse and sat down by the way-side, and drew his bottle of good wine from out of his wallet, and asked the men if they were in haste. \"Nay, master,\" said he of the pole-axe, while all eyes turned to the bottle, \"HE has gone by too long; and will neither meddle with us, nor may we deal with him.\"  \"Well then,\" quoth Ralph, \"there is time for bever.  Have ye ought of a cup, that we may drink to each other?\"  \"Yea,\" said the carle with the anlace, \"that have I.\" Therewith he drew from his pouch a ram's horn rimmed with silver, and held it up, and said as if he were speaking to it:  \"Now, Thirly, rejoice! for ye shall have lord's wine poured into thy maw.\"  Therewith he held it out toward Ralph, who laughed and filled it up, and filled for himself a little silver cup which he carried, and said: \"To you, shepherds!  Much wool and little cry!\" And he drank withal.  \"And I,\" quoth the man with the horn, \"call this health; Much cry and little wool!\"  \"Well, well, how mean ye by that, Greasy Wat?\" said the man with the spear, taking the horn as he spake; \"that is but a poor wish for a lord that drinketh out of our cup.\"  Said Wat:  \"Why, neighbour, why! thy wit is none too hasty.  The wool that a knight sheareth is war and battle; that is wounding and death; but the cry is the talk and boasting and minstrelsy that goeth before all this.  Which is the best wish to wish him? the wounds and the death, or the fore-rumour and stir thereof which hurteth no man?\"  Ralph laughed thereat, and was merry and blithe with them; but the spearman, who was an old man, said:  \"For all Wat sayeth, lord, and his japes, ye must not misdeem of us that we shepherds of the Downs can do nought but run to ales and feasts, and that we are but pot-valiant: maybe thou thyself mayst live to see things go otherwise:  and in that day may we have such as thee for captain.  Now, fair lord, I drink to thy crown of valour, and thy good luck; and we thank thee for the wine and yet more for the blithe fellowship.\"  So Ralph filled up the ram's horn till Dame Katherine's good island wine was well-nigh spent; and at last he said:  \"Now, my masters, I must to horse; but I pray you tell or we depart, what did ye mean when ye said that HE had gone past?  Who is HE?\"  The merry faces of the men changed at his word, and they looked in each other's faces, till at last the old spearman answered him:  \"Fair lord, these things we have little will to talk about: for we be poor men with no master to fleece us, and no lord to help us: also we be folk unlearned and unlettered, and from our way of life, whereas we dwell in the wilderness, we seldom come within the doors of a church. But whereas we have drunk with thee, who seemest to be a man of lineage, and thou hast been blithe with us, we will tell thee that we have seen one riding south along the Greenway, clad in a coat as green as the way, with the leafless tree done on his breast.  So nigh to him we were that we heard his cry as he sped along, as ye may hear the lapwing whining; for he said: 'POINT AND EDGE, POINT AND EDGE!  THE RED WATER AMIDST OF THE HILLS!' In my lifetime such a man hath, to my knowledge, been seen thrice before; and after each sight of him followed evil days and the death of men.  Moreover this is the Eve of St. John, and we deem the token the worse therefor.  Or how deemest thou?\"  Ralph stood silent awhile; for he was thinking of the big man whom he had met at the churchyard gate, and all this tale seemed wonderful to him.  But at last he said:  \"I cannot tell what there is in it; herein am I no help to you.  To-day I am but little; though I may one day be great.  Yet this may I do for you; tomorrow will I let sing a mass in St. Mary's Church on your behoof.  And hereafter, if I wax as my will is, and I come to be lord in these lands, I will look to it to do what a good lord should do for the shepherds of the Downs, so that they may live well, and die in good hope.  So may the Mother of God help me at need!\"  Said the old shepherd:  \"Thou hast sworn an oath, and it is a good oath, and well sworn.  Now if thou dost as thou swearest, words can but little thanks, yet deeds may.  Wherefore if ever thou comest back hither, and art in such need that a throng of men may help thee therein; then let light a great fire upon each corner of the topmost wall of Bear Castle, and call to mind this watch-word: 'SMITE ASIDE THE AXE, O BEAR-FATHER,' and then shalt thou see what shall betide thee for thy good-hap: farewell now, with the saints to aid!\"  Ralph bade them live well and hail, and mounted his horse and rode off down the Greenway, and as he rode the shepherds waved their weapons to him in token of good-will.
