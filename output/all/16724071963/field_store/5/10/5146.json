Yet the compassion which he feels for mankind and the good Karma which he has accumulated cause a human image of him (Nirmâna-kâya) to appear among men for their instruction and a superhuman image, perceptible yet not material, to appear in Paradise.

Ratnasambhava and Amoghasiddhi are rarely mentioned apart from the others. According to Getty (_Gods of Northern Buddhism_, pp. 26, 27) a group of six, including the Âdi-Buddha himself under the name of Vajrasattva, is sometimes worshipped.]  [Footnote 75: About the same period Śiva and Vishnu were worshipped in five forms.

This idea is very common in China and Japan but goes back to Indian sources. See _e.g._ Lotus, XXIV. verse 3.]  [Footnote 85: These Bodhisattvas are also mentioned but without much emphasis in the Greater Sukhâvatî-vyûha.]  [Footnote 86: Even in Hinayanist works such as the Nidânakathâ Sumedha's resolution to become a Buddha, formed as he lies on the ground before Dipankara, has a resemblance to Amîda's vow. He resolves to attain the truth, to enable mankind to cross the sea of the world and only then to attain Nirvana.]  [Footnote 87: See Foucher, _Iconographie Bouddhique dans l'Inde._]  [Footnote 88: The Bhagavad-gîtâ states quite clearly the doctrine of the deathbed prayer (VIII. ad init.). \"He who leaves this body and departs remembering me in his last moments comes to my essence. Whatever form (of deity) he remembers when he finally leaves this body, to that he goes having been used to ponder on it.\"]  [Footnote 89: See art. Âdi-Buddha in _E.R.E._ Asanga in the Sûtrâlankâra (IX. 77) condemns the doctrine of Âdi-Buddha, showing that the term was known then, even if it had not the precise dogmatic sense which it acquired later. His argument is that no one can become a Buddha without an equipment (Sambhâra) of merit and knowledge. Such an equipment can only be obtained from a previous Buddha and therefore the series of Buddhas must extend infinitely backwards.]  [Footnote 90: For the prevalence of the doctrine in mediæval Bengal see B.K. Sarkar, _Folklore Element in Hindu Culture_, which is however sparing of precise references. The Dharma or Nirañjana of the Śûnya Purâna seems to be equivalent to Âdi-Buddha.  Sometimes the Âdi-Buddha is identified with Vajrasattva or Samantabhadra, although these beings are otherwise classified as Bodhisattvas. This appears analogous to the procedure common in Hinduism by which a devotee declares that his special deity is all the gods and the supreme spirit.]  [Footnote 91: It would appear that some of the Tantras treat of five bodies, adding to the three here given others such as the Ânandakâya, Vajrakâya and Svabhâvakâya.

See Huth, _Ges. d. Bud. in d. Mongolei_, vol. II. pp. 83-89. Hinduism also assigns to living beings three bodies, the Kâraṇa-śarîra, lingaś. and sthûlaś.]  [Footnote 92: Translated into Chinese by Dharmaraksha between 397 and 439 A.D.]  [Footnote 93: The prototype of the Sambhoga-kâya is found in the Pali Canon, for the Buddha says (Mahâparinib. Sut. III. 22) that when he appears among the different classes of gods his form and voice are similar to theirs.]  [Footnote 94: Watters, vol. II. p. 38. \"Spiritual essence\" is Fa-shên in Chinese, _i.e._ Dharma-kâya. Another passage is quoted to the effect that \"henceforth the observances of all my disciples constitute the Tathâgata's Fa-shên, eternal and imperishable.\"]  [Footnote 95: Mahâparinib. Sut. VI. i.]  [Footnote 96: Something similar might happen in English if think and thing were pronounced in the same way and a thing were believed to be that which we can think.]  [Footnote 97: See Ashtasâhasrikâ Prajñâ-pâramitâ, chap. IV, near beginning.]  [Footnote 98: It is in this last point that no inferior intelligence can follow the thought of a Buddha.]  [Footnote 99: _The Awakening of Faith_, Teitaro Suzuki, p. 59.]     CHAPTER XIX  MAHAYANIST METAPHYSICS   Thus the theory of the three bodies, especially of the Dharma-kâya, is bound up with a theory of ontology. Metaphysics became a passion among the travellers of the Great Vehicle as psychology had been in earlier times. They may indeed be reproached with being bad Buddhists since they insisted on speculating on those questions which Gotama had declared to be unprofitable and incapable of an answer in human language. He refused to pronounce on the whence, the whither and the nature of things, but bade his disciples walk in the eightfold path and analyse the human mind, because such analysis conduces to spiritual progress. India was the last country in the world where such restrictions were likely to be observed. Much Mahayanist literature is not religious at all but simply metaphysics treated in an authoritative and ecclesiastical manner. The nature and origin of the world are discussed as freely as in the Vedânta and with similar results: the old ethics and psychology receive scant attention. Yet the difference is less than might be supposed. Anyone who reads these treatises and notices the number of apparently eternal beings and the talk about the universal mind is likely to think the old doctrine that nothing has an âtman or soul, has been forgotten. But this impression is not correct; the doctrine of _Nairâtmyam_ is asserted so uncompromisingly that from one point of view it may be said that even Buddhas do not exist. The meaning of this doctrine is that no being or object contains an unchangeable permanent self, which lives unaltered in the same or in different bodies. On the contrary individual existences consist of nothing but a collection of skandhas or a _santâna_, a succession or series of mental phenomena. In the Pali books this doctrine is applied chiefly to the soul and psychological enquiries. The Mahayana applied it to the external world and proved by ingenious arguments that nothing at all exists. Similarly the doctrine of Karma is maintained, though it is seriously modified by the admission that merit can be transferred from one personality to another. The Mahayana continued to teach that an act once performed affects a particular series of mental states until its effect is exhausted, or in popular language that an individual enjoys or suffers through a series of births the consequences of previous acts. Even the instance of Amitâbha's paradise, though it strains the doctrine of Karma to the utmost, does not repudiate it. For the believer performs an act--to wit, the invocation of Amitâbha--to which has been attached the wonderful result that the performer is reborn in a blessed state. This is not essentially different from the idea found in the Pali Canon that attentions paid to a Buddha may be rewarded by a happy rebirth in heaven.[100]  Mahayanist metaphysics, like all other departments of this theology, are beset by the difficulty that the authorities who treat of them are not always in accord and do not pretend to be in accord. The idea that variety is permissible in belief and conduct is deeply rooted in later Buddhism: there are many vehicles, some better than others no doubt and some very ramshackle, but all are capable of conveying their passengers to salvation. Nominally the Mahayana was divided into only two schools of philosophy: practically every important treatise propounds a system with features of its own. The two schools are the Yogâcâras and Mâdhyamikas.[101] Both are idealists and deny the reality of the external world, but whereas the Yogâcâras (also called Vijñânavâdins) admit that Vijñâna or consciousness and the series of states of which it consists are real, the Mâdhyamikas refuse the title of reality to both the subjective and the objective world and hence gained a reputation of being complete nihilists. Probably the Mâdhyamikas are the older school.  Both schools attach importance to the distinction between relative and absolute knowledge. Relative knowledge is true for human beings living in the world: that is to say it is not more false"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16551"],["title","The Girl of the Golden West (#0)"],["body","GIRL OF THE GOLDEN WEST  by  DAVID BELASCO  1911           \"In those strange days, people coming from God knows where,    joined forces in that far Western land, and, according to the    rude custom of the camp, their very names were soon lost and    unrecorded, and here they struggled, laughed, gambled, cursed,    killed, loved and worked out their strange destinies in a    manner incredible to us of to-day. Of one thing only are we    sure--they lived!\"                                   _Early History of California_     I.   It was when coming back to the mines, after a trip to Monterey, that the Girl first met him. It happened, too, just at a time when her mind was ripe to receive a lasting impression. But of all this the boys of Cloudy Mountain Camp heard not a word, needless to say, until long afterwards.  Lolling back on the rear seat of the stage, her eyes half closed,--the sole passenger now, and with the seat in front piled high with boxes and baskets containing _rebozos_, silken souvenirs, and other finery purchased in the shops of the old town,--the Girl was mentally reviewing and dreaming of the delights of her week's visit there,--a visit that had been a revelation to one whose sole experience of the world had until now been derived from life in a rough mining camp. Before her half-closed eyes still shimmered a vista of strange, exotic scenes and people, the thronging crowds of carnivals and fêtes; the Mexican girls swaying through the movements of the fandango to the music of guitars and castanets; the great _rodeo_ with its hundreds of _vaqueros_, which was held at one of the ranchos just outside the town; and, lastly, and most vividly of all, the never-to-be-forgotten thrill of her first bull-fight.  Still ringing in her ears was the piercing note of the bugle which instantly silenced the expectant throng; the hoarse roar that greeted the entrance of the bull, and the thunder of his hoofs when he made his first mad charge. She saw again, with marvellous fidelity, the whole colour-scheme just before the death of the big, brave beast: the huge arena in its unrivalled setting of mountain, sea and sky; the eager multitude, tense with expectancy; the silver-mounted bridles and trappings of the horses; the many-hued capes of the _capadors_; the gaily-dressed _banderilleros_, poising their beribboned barbs; the red flag and long, slender, flashing sword of the cool and ever watchful _matador_; and, most prominent of all to her eyes, the brilliant, gold-laced packets of the gentlemen-_picadors_, who, after the Mexican fashion,--so she had been told,--deemed it in nowise beneath them to enter the arena in person.  And so it happened that now, as the stage swung round a corner, and a horseman suddenly appeared at a point where two roads converged, and was evidently spurring his horse with the intent of coming up with the stage, it was only natural that, even before he was near enough to be identified, the _caballero_ should already have become a part of the pageant of her mental picture.  Up to the moment of the stranger's appearance, nothing had happened to break the monotony of her long return journey towards Cloudy Mountain Camp. Far back in the distance now lay the Mission where the passengers of the stage had been hospitably entertained the night before; still further back the red-tiled roofs and whitewashed walls of the little pueblo of San Jose,--a veritable bower of roses; and remotest of all, the crosses of San Carlos and the great pines, oaks and cypresses, which bordered her dream-memory of the white-beach crescent formed by the waves of Monterey Bay.  The dawn of each day that swept her further from her week in wonderland had ushered in the matchless spring weather of California,--the brilliant sunshine, the fleecy clouds, the gentle wind with just a tang in it from the distant mountains; and as the stage rolled slowly northward through beautiful valleys, bright with yellow poppies and silver-white lupines, every turn of the road varied her view of the hills lying under an enchantment unlike that of any other land. Yet strange and full of interest as every mile of the river country should have been to a girl accustomed to the great forest of the Sierras, she had gazed upon it for the most part with unseeing eyes, while her thoughts turned, magnet-like, backward to the delights and the bewilderment of the old Mexican town. So now, as the pursuing horseman swept rapidly nearer, each swinging stride of the powerful horse, each rhythmic movement of the graceful rider brought nearer and more vivid the vision of a handsome _picador_ holding off with his lance a thoroughly maddened bull until the crowd roared forth its appreciation.  \"See, Señorita,\" said the horseman, at last galloping close to the coach and lifting his sombrero, \"A beautiful bunch of syringa,\" and then, with his face bent towards her and his voice full of appeal, he added in lower tone: \"for you!\"  For a brief second, the Girl was too much taken back to find the adequate words with which to accept the stranger's offering. Notwithstanding that in his glance she could read, as plainly as though he had spoken: \"I know I am taking a liberty, but please don't be angry with me,\" there was something in his sweeping bow and grace of manner that, coupled with her vague sense of his social advantage, disconcerted her. A second more, however, and the embarrassment had passed, for on lifting her eyes to his again she saw that her memory had not played her false; beyond all chance of a mistake, he was the man who, ten days earlier, had peered into the stage, as she was nearing Monterey, and later, at the bull-fight, had found time to shoot admiring glances at her between his daring feats of horsemanship. Therefore, genuine admiration was in her eyes and extreme cordiality in her voice when, after a word or two of thanks, she added, with great frankness:  \"But it strikes me sort o' forcible that I've seen you before.\" Then, with growing enthusiasm: \"My, but that bull-fight was jest grand! You were fine! I'm right glad to know you, sir.\"  The _caballero's_ face flushed with pleasure at her free-and-easy reception of him, while an almost inaudible \"_Gracias_\" fell from his lips. At once he knew that his first surmise, that the Girl was an American, had been correct. Not that his experience in life had furnished him with any parallel, for the Girl constituted a new and unique type. But he was well aware that no Spanish lady would have received the advances of a stranger in like fashion. It was inevitable, therefore, that for the moment he should contrast, and not wholly to her advantage, the Girl's unconventionality with the enforced reserve of the _dulcineas_ who, custom decrees, may not be courted save in the presence of _duennas_. But the next instant he recalled that there were, in Sacramento, young women whose directness it would never do to mistake for boldness; and,--to his credit be it said,--he was quick to perceive that, however indifferent the Girl seemed to the customary formality of introduction, there was no suggestion of indelicacy about her. All that her frank and easy manner suggested was that she was a child of nature, spontaneous and untrammelled by the dictates of society, and normally and healthily at home in the company of the opposite sex.  \"And she is even more beautiful than I supposed,\" was the thought that went through his mind.  And yet, the Girl was not beautiful, at least if judged by Spanish or Californian standards. Unlike most of their women, she was fair, and her type purely American. Her eyes of blue were lightly but clearly browed and abundantly fringed; her hair of burnished gold was luxuriant and wavy, and framed a face of singularly frank and happy expression, even though the features lacked regularity. But it was a face, so he told himself, that any man would trust,--a face that would make a man the better for looking at it,--a face which reflected a soul that no environment could make other than pure and spotless. And so there was, perhaps, a shade more of respect and a little less assurance in his manner when he asked:  \"And you like Monterey?\"  \"I love it! Ain't it romantic--an', my, what a fine time the girls there must have!\"  The man laughed; the Girl's enthusiasm amused him.  \"Have you had a fine trip so far?\" he asked, for want of something better to say.  \"Mercy, yes! This 'ere stage is a pokey ol' thing, but we've made not bad time, considerin'.\"  \"I thought you were never going to get here!\"  The Girl shot a coquettish glance at him.  \"How did you know I was comin' on this 'ere stage?\"  \"I did not know,\"--the stranger broke off and thought a moment. He may have been asking himself whether it were best for him to be as frank as she had been and admit his admiration for her; at last, encouraged perhaps by a look in the Girl's blue eyes, he ventured: \"But I've been riding along this road every day since I saw you. I felt that I must see you again.\"  \"You must like me powerful well . . .?\" This remark, far from being a question, was accompanied with all the physiognomical evidences of an assertion.  The stranger shot a surprised glance at her, out of the corner of his eye. Then he admitted, in all truthfulness:  \"Of course I do. Who could help . . .?\"  \"Have you tried not to?\" questioned the Girl, smiling in his face now, and enjoying in the full this stolen intimacy.  \"Ah, Señorita, why should I . . .? All I know is that I do.\"  The Girl became reflective; presently she observed:  \"How funny it seems, an' yet, p'r'aps not so strange after all. The boys--all my boys at the camp like me--I'm glad you do, too.\"  Meanwhile the good-natured and loquaciously-inclined driver had turned his head and was subjecting the man cantering alongside of his stage to a rigid inspection. With his knowledge of the various types of men in California at that time, he had no difficulty in placing the status of this"]]]
