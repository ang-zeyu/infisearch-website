We are told that sin is  wrong, because it will make us miserable hereafter. Guilt is  represented as the short-sightedness which barters for a home on  earth--a home in heaven.   In the text-book of ethics studied in one of our universities, virtue  is defined as that which is done at the command of God for the sake of  an eternal reward. So then, religion is nothing more than a  calculation of infinite and finite quantities; vice is nothing more  than a grand imprudence; and heaven is nothing more than selfishness  rewarded with eternal well-being!   Yet this you will observe, is a necessary step in the development of  faith. Faith is the conviction that God is a rewarder of them who  diligently seek Him; and there is a moment in human progress when the  anticipated rewards and punishments must be of a Mahometan  character--the happiness of the senses. It was thus that the Jews were  disciplined; out of a coarse, rude, infantine state, they were  educated by rewards and punishments to abstain from present sinful  gratification: at first, the promise of the life which now is,  afterwards the promise of that which is to come; but even then the  rewards and punishments of a future state were spoken of, by  inspiration itself, as of an arbitrary character; and some of the best  of the Israelites, in looking to the recompense of reward, seemed to  have anticipated, coarsely, recompense in exchange for duties  performed.   The last step is that which alone deserves to be called Christian  Faith--\"Who is he that overcometh but he that believeth that Jesus is  the Christ?\" The difference between the faith of the Christian and  that of the man of the world, or the mere ordinary religionist, is not  a difference in mental operation, but in the object of the faith--to  believe that Jesus is the Christ is the peculiarity of Christian  faith.   The anticipated heaven of the Christian differs from the anticipated  heaven of any other man, not in the distinctness with which its  imagery is perceived, but in the kind of objects which are hoped for.  The apostle has told us the character of heaven. \"Eye hath not seen,  nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to  conceive the things which God hath prepared for them that love  Him\"--which glorious words are sometimes strangely misinterpreted, as  if the apostle merely meant rhetorically to exalt the conception of  the heavenly world, as of something beyond all power to imagine or to  paint. The apostle meant something infinitely deeper: the heaven of  God is not only that which \"eye hath not seen,\" but that which eye can  _never_ see; its glories are not of that kind at all which can ever  stream in forms of beauty on the eye, or pour in melody upon the  enraptured ear--not such joys as genius in its most gifted hour (here  called \"the heart of man\") can invent or imagine: it is something  which these sensuous organs of ours never can appreciate--bliss of  another kind altogether, revealed to the spirit of man by the Spirit  of God--joys such as spirit alone can receive.   Do you ask what these are? \"The fruits of the Spirit are love, joy,  peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,  temperance.\" That is heaven, and therefore the Apostle tells us that  he alone who \"believeth that Jesus is the Christ,\" and only he, feels  that. What is it to believe that Jesus is the Christ?--That He is the  Anointed One, that His life is the anointed life, the only blessed  life, the blessed life divine for thirty years?--Yes, but if so, the  blessed Life still, continued throughout all eternity: unless you  believe that, you do not believe that Jesus is the Christ.   What is the blessedness that you expect?--to have the joys of earth  with the addition of the element of eternity? Men think that heaven is  to be a compensation for earthly loss: the saints are earthly-wretched  here, the children of this world are earthly-happy; but _that_, they  think, shall be all reversed--Lazarus, beyond the grave, shall have  the purple and the fine linen, and the splendour, and the houses, and  the lands which Dives had on earth: the one had them for time, the  other shall have them for eternity. That is the heaven that men  expect--this earth sacrificed _now_, in order that it may be  re-granted for _ever_.   Nor will this expectation be reversed except by a reversal of the  nature. None can anticipate such a heaven as God has revealed, except  they that are born of the Spirit; therefore to believe that Jesus is  the Christ, a man must be born of God. You will observe that no other  victory overcomes the world: for this is what St. John means by  saying, \"Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth  that Jesus is the Christ?\" For then it comes to pass that a man begins  to feel, that to do wrong is hell; and that to love God, to be like  God, to have the mind of Christ, is the only heaven. Until this  victory is gained, the world retains its stronghold in the heart.   Do you think that the temperate man has overcome the world, who,  instead of the short-lived rapture of intoxication, chooses regular  employment, health, and prosperity? Is it not the world in another  form, which has his homage? Or do you suppose that the so-called  religious man is really the world's conqueror by being content to give  up seventy years of enjoyment in order to win innumerable ages of the  very same species of enjoyment? Has he not only made earth a hell, in  order that earthly things may be his heaven for ever?   Thus the victory of Faith proceeds from stage to stage: the first  victory is, when the Present is conquered by the Future; the last,  when the Visible and Sensual is despised in comparison of the  Invisible and Eternal. Then earth has lost its power for ever; for if  _all_ that it has to give be lost eternally, the gain of faith is  still infinite.      III.   _Preached Whitsunday, May 19, 1850._   THE DISPENSATION OF THE SPIRIT.      \"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.\"--1     Corinthians xii, 4.   According to a view which contains in it a profound truth, the ages of  the world are divisible into three dispensations, presided over by the  Father, the Son, and the Spirit.   In the dispensation of the Father, God was known as a Creator;  creation manifested His eternal power and Godhead, and the religion of  mankind was the religion of Nature.   In the dispensation of the Son, God manifested Himself to Humanity  through man; the Eternal Word spoke, through the inspired and gifted  of the human race, to those that were uninspired and ungifted. This  was the dispensation of the prophets--its climax was the advent of the  Redeemer; it was completed when _perfect_ Humanity manifested God to  man. The characteristic of this dispensation was, that God revealed  Himself by an authoritative Voice, speaking from without, and the  highest manifestation of God whereof man was capable, was a Divine  Humanity.   The age in which we at present live is the dispensation of the Spirit,  in which God has communicated Himself by the highest revelation, and  in the most intimate communion, of which man is capable; no longer  through Creation, no more as an authoritative Voice from without, but  as a Law within--as a Spirit mingling with a spirit. This is the  dispensation of which the prophet said of old, that the time should  come when they should no longer teach every man his brother and every  man his neighbour, saying, \"Know the Lord\"--that is, by a will  revealed by external authority from other human minds--\"for they shall  all know him, from the least of them to the greatest.\" This is the  dispensation, too, of whose close the Apostle Paul speaks thus: \"Then  shall the Son also be subject to Him that hath put all things under  Him, that God may be all in all.\"   The outward humanity is to disappear, that the inward union may be  complete. To the same effect, he speaks in another place, \"Yea, though  we have known Christ after the flesh, yet henceforth know we Him no  more.\" For this reason, the Ascension was necessary before Pentecost  could come: the Spirit was not given, we are told, because Jesus was  not yet glorified. It was necessary for the Son to disappear as an  outward authority, in order that he might re-appear as an inward  principle of life. Our salvation is no longer God manifested in a  Christ _without_ us, but as a Christ _within_ us, the hope of glory.  To-day is the selected anniversary of that memorable day when the  first proof was given to the senses, in the gift of Pentecost, that  that spiritual dispensation had begun.   There is a twofold way in which the operations of the Spirit on  mankind may be considered--His influence on the Church as a whole, and  His influence on individuals; both of these are brought together in  the text. It branches, therefore, into a twofold division.      I. Spiritual gifts conferred on individuals.    II. Spiritual union of the Church.   Let us distinguish between the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit: by  the Spirit, the apostle meant the vital principle of new life from  God, common to all believers--the animating Spirit of the Church of  God; by the gifts of the Spirit, he meant the diversities of form in  which He operates on individuals; its influence varied according to  their respective peculiarities and characteristics. In the  twenty-eighth verse of this chapter a full catalogue of gifts is  found; looking at them generally, we discover two classes into which  they may be divided--the first are natural, the second are  supernatural: the first are those capacities which are originally  found in human nature--personal endowments of mind, a character  elevated and enlarged by the gift of the Spirit; the second are those  which were created and called into"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16645"],["title","Sermons Preached at Brighton (#6)"],["body"," by the sudden approach of  the same influence.   Just as if the temperature of this Northern hemisphere were raised  suddenly, and a mighty tropical river were to pour its fertilizing  inundation over the country, the result would be the impartation of a  vigorous and gigantic growth to the vegetation already in existence,  and at the same time the development of life in seeds and germs which  had long lain latent in the soil, incapable of vegetation in the  unkindly climate of their birth. Exactly in the same way, the flood of  a Divine life, poured suddenly into the souls of men, enlarged and  ennobled qualities which had been used already, and at the same time  _developed_ powers which never could have become apparent in the cold,  low temperature of natural life.   Among the natural gifts, we may instance these: teaching--healing--the  power of government. Teaching is a gift, natural or acquired. To know,  is one thing; to have the capacity of imparting knowledge, is another.   The physician's art again is no supernatural mystery; long and  careful study of physical laws capacitate him for his task. To govern,  again, is a natural faculty: it may be acquired by habit, but there  are some who never could acquire it. Some men seem born to command:  place them in what sphere you will, others acknowledge their secret  influence, and subordinate themselves to their will. The faculty of  organization, the secret of rule, need no supernatural power. They  exist among the uninspired. Now the doctrine of the apostle was, that  all these are transformed and renovated by the spirit of a new life in  such a way as to become almost new powers, or, as he calls them, gifts  of the Spirit. A remarkable illustration of this is his view of the  human body. If there be anything common to us by nature, it is the  members of our corporeal frame; yet the apostle taught that these,  guided by the Spirit as its instruments and obeying a holy will,  became transfigured; so that, in his language, the body becomes a  temple of the Holy Ghost, and the meanest faculties, the lowest  appetites, the humblest organs, are ennobled by the Spirit mind which  guides them. Thus he bids the Romans yield themselves \"unto God as  those that are alive from the dead, and their members as instruments  of righteousness unto God.\"   The second class of gifts are supernatural: of these we find two  pre-eminent--the gift of tongues, and the gift of prophecy.   It does not appear that the gift of tongues was merely the imparted  faculty of speaking foreign languages--it could not be that the  highest gift of God to His Church merely made them rivals of the  linguist; it would rather seem that the Spirit of God, mingling with  the soul of man, supernaturally elevated its aspirations and glorified  its conceptions, so that an entranced state of ecstasy was  produced, and feelings called into energy, for the expression of which  the ordinary forms of speech were found inadequate. Even in a far  lower department, when a man becomes possessed of ideas for which his  ordinary vocabulary supplies no sufficient expression, his language  becomes broken, incoherent, struggling, and almost unnaturally  elevated; much more was it to be expected that when divine and new  feelings rushed like a flood upon the soul, the language of men would  have become strange and extraordinary; but in that supposed case, wild  as the expressions might appear to one coldly looking on and not  participating in the feelings of the speaker, they would be quite  sufficient to convey intelligible meaning to any one affected by the  same emotions.   Where perfect sympathy exists, incoherent utterance--a word--a  syllable--is quite as efficient as elaborate sentences. Now this is  precisely the account given of the phenomenon which attended the gift  of tongues. On the day of Pentecost, all who were in the same state of  spiritual emotion as those who spoke, understood the speakers; each  was as intelligible to all as if he spoke in their several tongues: to  those who were coolly and sceptically watching, the effects appeared  like those of intoxication. A similar account is given by the Apostle  Paul: the voice appeared to unsympathetic ears as that of a barbarian;  the uninitiated and unbelieving coming in, heard nothing that was  articulate to them, but only what seemed to them the ravings of  insanity.   The next was the gift of prophecy. Prophecy has several meanings in  Scripture; sometimes it means the power of predicting future events,  sometimes an entranced state accompanied with ravings, sometimes it  appears to mean only exposition; but prophecy, as the miraculous  spiritual gift granted to the early Church, seems to have been a state  of communion with the mind of God lower than that which was called the  gift of tongues, at least less ecstatic, less rapt into the world to  come, more under the guidance of the reason, more within the control  of calm consciousness--as we might say, less supernatural.   Upon these gifts we make two observations:   1. Even the highest were not accompanied with spiritual faultlessness.  Inspiration was one thing, infallibility another. The gifts of the  Spirit were, like the gifts of Nature, subordinated to the  will--capable of being used for good or evil, sometimes pure,  sometimes mixed with human infirmity. The supernaturally gifted man  was no mere machine, no automaton ruled in spite of himself by a  superior spirit. Disorder, vanity, over-weening self-estimation, might  accompany these gifts, and the prophetic utterance itself might be  degraded to a mere brawling in the Church; therefore St. Paul  established laws of control, declared the need of subjection and rule  over spiritual gifts: the spirits of the prophets were to be subject  to the prophets; if those in the ecstatic state were tempted to break  out into utterance and unable to interpret what it meant, those so  gifted were to hold their peace.   The prophet poured out the truths supernaturally imparted to his  highest spirit, in an inspired and impassioned eloquence which was  intelligible even to the unspiritual, and was one of the appointed  means of convincing the unconverted. The lesson derivable from this is  not obsolete even in the present day. There is nothing perhaps  precisely identical in our own day with those gifts of the early  Church; but genius and talent are uncommon gifts, which stand in a  somewhat analogous relation--in a closer one certainly--than more  ordinary endowments. The flights of genius, we know, appear like  maniac ravings to minds not elevated to the same spiritual level. Now  these are perfectly compatible with mis-use, abuse, and moral  disorder. The most gifted of our countrymen has left this behind him  as his epitaph, \"The greatest, wisest, _meanest_ of mankind.\" The most  glorious gift of poetic insight--itself in a way divine--having  something akin to Deity--is too often associated with degraded life  and vicious character. Those gifts which elevate us above the rest of  our species, whereby we stand aloof and separate from the crowd,  convey no moral--nor even mental--infallibility: nay, they have in  themselves a peculiar danger, whereas that gift which is common to us  all as brethren, the animating spirit of a divine life, in whose soil  the spiritual being of all is rooted, cannot make us vain; we _cannot_  pride ourselves on _that_, for it is common to us all.   2. Again, the gifts which were higher in one sense were lower in  another; as supernatural gifts they would rank thus--the gift of  tongues before prophecy, and prophecy before teaching; but as  blessings to be desired, this order is reversed: rather than the gift  of tongues St. Paul bids the Corinthians desire that they might  prophecy. Inferior again to prophecy was the quite simple, and as we  should say, lower faculty of explaining truth. Now the principle upon  which that was tried was that of utility--not utility in the low sense  of the utilitarian, who measures the value of a thing by its  susceptibility of application to the purpose of this present life, but  a utility whose measure was love, charity. The apostle considered  _that_ gift most desirable by which men might most edify one another.  And hence that noble declaration of one of the most gifted of  mankind--\"I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I  might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown  tongue.\"   Our estimate is almost the reverse of this: we value a gift in  proportion to its rarity, its distinctive character, separating its  possessor from the rest of his fellow-men; whereas, in truth, those  gifts which leave us in lonely majesty apart from our species, useless  to them, benefiting ourselves alone, are not the most godlike, but the  least so; because they are dissevered from that beneficent charity  which is the very being of God. Your lofty incommunicable thoughts,  your ecstasies, and aspirations, and contemplative raptures--in virtue  of which you have estimated yourself as the porcelain of the earth, of  another nature altogether than the clay of common spirits--tried by  the test of Charity, what is there grand in these if they cannot be  applied as blessings to those that are beneath you? One of our  countrymen has achieved for himself extraordinary scientific renown;  he pierced the mysteries of nature, he analysed her processes, he gave  new elements to the world. The same man applied his rare intellect to  the construction of a simple and very common instrument--that  well-known lamp which has been the guardian of the miner's life from  the explosion of fire. His discoveries are his nobility in this world,  his trifling invention gives him rank in the world to come. By the  former he shines as one of the brightest luminaries in the firmament  of science, by the latter evincing a spirit animated and directed by  Christian love, he takes his place"]]]
