Overhead the martins flicker and swoop, and starlings sail by in circling clouds, while the colossal noises crash and boom away merrily.  Ought I, perhaps, not to talk of these things? Does it worry you to think of crumps bursting and so on? But, really, it seems quite ordinary and in the day's work here. Men talk of crumps as you would talk of bread and butter. That is, perhaps, why letters from home that talk about homely things--cows and lavender and the new chintz--are so welcome.  Besides, good heavens! don't you know that there's not a man in France but knows that the best-beloved ones at home are having a far worse time than we are having here? Wet clothes? Mud? Shells a-bursting, guns a-popping? Even a wound, perhaps? Pish! No one _thinks_ at all out here. There isn't time. Most of the people out here are perfectly happy and merry, really. The sort of \"long-drawn-out-agony\" touch is, I think, rare.  I'm writing this in a jolly Boche dug-out, all panelled and cosy. Jezebel and Swallow and a new pack mare I've got are in a valley that's hardly ever touched, and in fine, all's well.   _September 24._  [Sidenote: TEAR SHELLS]  Tear shells or \"lachrymatory shells.\" They haven't been putting many over lately, apparently. But they put some over the other day, and they are so amusing that I must describe them to you.  The Colonel and I were up trying to find a \"working-party\" from the regiment. The regiment is sadly split up at present into various parties doing various jobs in various places, all unpleasant. Better than infantry work, but still unpleasant.  We rode up much closer than we have ridden before, and left the Colonel's orderly and Hale in a bit of a valley with Minotaur, Jezebel, Hob, and Tank. Tank is a new mare I've got. Hale was riding her, as I never take Swallow closer than I can help.  We dismounted in this small valley, and the Colonel's orderly and Hale were given orders to move if any shells were put over too near them.  Then the Colonel and I went up through a wood that is just a few splintered stumps now.  We passed behind several batteries, and I thought to myself: \"Dash it all! I know my eyes can't be watering because of the noise. What the deuce is the matter? I hope the Colonel won't notice.\"  However, on we waded and plodded. Suddenly the Colonel stopped, and exclaimed: \"Oh damnation! This is perfect nonsense.\" His eyes were like tomatoes, and the tears were rolling down his cheeks!  By this time we could hardly see at all, and it dawned on us that we must hastily put on our tear goggles, which we had never used before, but always, of course, carry. They go in the satchel along with the two gas helmets.  Presently we met some infantry coming back, all safely begoggled. The Huns, they told us, were dropping tear shells just into that valley in front, where our working-party was supposed to be. You can tell them (the tear shells), they said, by the fluttering sound, and they knock up no earth and make very little smoke.  Sure enough, as soon as we got over the brow there they were. They make a foolish wobbly, wavy sound as they come over, and look most innocent. So they are really if you get your goggles on in time. But if one bursts close to you, and you haven't got goggles on, why, then you'll be as blind as an owl, and you'll weep like a shower bath.  [Sidenote: BETWEEN HIGH WOOD AND FLERS]  Then the absurd thing was that we couldn't find the working-party. Plenty of dead Huns, but nobody alive. Not a sign. Only crumps dropping here and there and everywhere. So we found a bit of a trench that led back round the side of the wood. The front line trenches were only very lightly held, partly because they are almost completely blown in. And we could get no information as to the working-party at all.  Presently we saw why. The Huns had put up a barrage across the valley they were coming up. We knew they would come up this other valley, as they had to report on their way to H.Q., ---- Division. So we got into a hole and waited.  After about half an hour the barrage lifted and up came our working-party none the worse. It is a most amazing war. People literally dodge shells and things as you might dodge snow-balls.  When we arrived back at the place where we left our two men, they also were not to be seen.  After some time and anxious inquiries for two men with four horses, we at last discovered them nearly half a mile away. Fritz had put some heavy stuff over fairly near, and they had moved.  \"A very interesting bit of the line isn't it, Hale?\" I said as we moved off. \"Yes, sir,\" he said, adding with a fierce frown, \"but not very _safe_, sir.\"  And then we all laughed. Hale does frown so when he makes one of his oracular utterances.   [Illustration: A HOUSE IN GEUDECOURT Here, as in many of these sketches, there are no people to be seen, for the simple reason that they are all underground in dug-outs.]   _September 29._  It's up to us to reconnoitre carefully every time there is a move forward, so as to see the new ground.  One of the most curious and interesting things is this: the Boche rarely wastes. He only puts his crumps and pip-squeaks just where he thinks (or knows) our batteries are, and our infantry want to be, and our horses would be likely to be (if they weren't somewhere else). So that gradually you begin to track out safe routes. Don't go near the edge of ---- Wood, but 200 yards inside the wood, on the north side, you're pretty comfy. Don't go near the mangled remains of ---- village, but keep to the right of it until you get to the wrecked aeroplane, and then turn down the remains of ---- trench, and you probably won't be touched. That sort of thing.  [Sidenote: BOCHE DUG-OUTS]  I've been sleeping in the most superb Boche dug-out. Very deep; I should think 30 feet down. The inside is pillared rather like the studio, and cretonned all over with maroon-coloured stuff instead of wall-paper. There are lovely little cupboards everywhere, and doors and window-frames just like a real house. The windows, of course, only look out on to an air-shaft, so it's very dark, and you have to have candles all the time. The windows have no glass, of course, as that would be shattered to smithereens by the vibrations. Then there's an arch and more steps down lower still, into the bedroom for two.  Yesterday, being rather misty, I thought as follows:  \"It is too foggy to see what Fritz is doing. No attack is intended or expected. The Colonel is at corps H.Q. Swallow and Jezebel and Tank are safe in ---- valley. Roger is still here as Adjutant. Why not an afternoon off?\"  So picture a holiday-maker armed with a revolver, two gas helmets, tear goggles, some sandwiches, and a large empty haversack. Now where to go? What about ---- trench and all round ---- village, even, perhaps, a lightning five minutes in the village itself? We have just taken the village, but it's rather an unhealthy spot at present.  ---- trench is a new trench that poor Fritz dug just before he was driven out of it. I had seen lots of dead Fritzes there the day before. Also there were reports of curious things flung out into the mud in and round the village.  [Sidenote: TROPHIES]  So I set forth. And at ---- met another fellow I knew, and the affair became neither more nor less than a search for souvenirs. Here is a list:       1. A few buttons with double-tailed lions.       2. Four shoulder-straps with the figure 6 in red. This indicated a      division which has been opposite us for some time and is quite      exhausted, I think.       3. One haversack and one respirator haversack.       4. One rosary.       5. Five different sorts of bayonets from different regiments. These      I thought we might hang up.       6. Four tassels. They are worn by Fritz rather in the same sort of      way as lanyards are worn. Quite pretty, though rather soiled and      worn.       7. A bit of a wing of a crushed aeroplane that is lying on the      brown, feverish earth like a dead sea-gull.       8. A brass spring very beautifully made, that I am going to have      made into a bracelet for you. Also from the aeroplane.       9. A cardboard box for signal flares. _Signal Patronen_ they are      labelled. I threw the flares away, as they might go pop _en route_.       10. A jolly bit of gilded carving from a house in ----       11. Now then for No. 11! A bit of embroidery. I think it is a      vestment of sorts. It's white, and there's heavy gold embroidery at      the sides. It is a cloak of some description, but the top part,      where there should be a collar or something, is gone. Then      11A is a piece of black and silver embroidery. It was all      very muddy and riddled with shrapnel or bits of crump, so I just      cut off the only sound bit. Both these things are exceedingly      beautiful. They are probably vestments, because they were quite      near what must have been the church. I am sure it must have been      the church, although I hadn't a map--first, because I saw the      village in the distance some time ago, while the church was still      standing, and therefore I know the church's situation; and,      secondly, because I saw remains of large pillars, and a few bits of      what was once a font amongst the d√©bris.  There now. Isn't that a good haul! It's not easy to get anything worth sending home, because everything is so utterly smashed up.   _October 2._  Jezebel and Swallow and Tank have all been clipped trace high. I am getting rather attached to Tank. She is so modest and unselfish--a contrast to Jezebel. She never expects little treats, and seems quite surprised when I give her anything. Swallow and Jezebel always neigh when they see my electric torch coming towards them after dinner (while we are back in these safe places). But Tank is very shy of the light, and thinks it will bite her.  Swallow is getting much better, and really seems to understand that the shells and guns and things probably won't "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16626"],["title","Letters to Helen: Impressions of an Artist on the Western Front (#8)"],["body","him. We have been most extraordinarily lucky. The troop that got through nearly to ---- the other day, hadn't a single casualty, although Dick's own mare was shot under him and a great many other horses were wounded. The squadron of ---- were very badly scuppered, I fear. But, anyhow, we all feel that Lloyd George is right. We are just beginning to win.   _October 5._  It is a glorious day. Such clouds. Swallow kicked up his heels and played about like a kitten when Hunt took him to water this morning. It's extraordinary how used the horses are getting to trenches and wire, etc. At first they were rather afraid to jump these sudden deep ditches, but now they pop across like rabbits.   _October 17._  [Sidenote: ARCHIE]  Yesterday some Hun aeroplanes got across and came right above this camp, a comfortable way behind the front line. Heavily strafed by our Archies. The blue sky was dotted all over with the pretty little white clouds of shrapnel.  Sergeant Pritchard and I were standing close to Flannagan (one of the men's horses), and the men were at stables. We were all looking up and longing to see a Hun aeroplane hit, when suddenly \"s-s-s-swish, plop!\" just behind me. It was one of the Archie shrapnel cases. It buried itself deep in the ground 3 yards from where we were standing. We dug it up, and I'll bring it home for you. If it isn't too tediously heavy.  Of course, Archie shrapnel cases all come down, and you see hundreds of them lying about; but I've never had one so close before. They sometimes fall broadside on, and sometimes end on, in which case they bury themselves fairly deep. All the Hun aeroplanes got away, alas!   _October 26._  Once more I'm going up to the strange dead village of ----. In many ways I shall be sorry to go back to comfort and billets, because the material for pictures here is very wonderful. You shall see several small things (the powers that be call it waste of time!), and it's infuriating to think that more can't be done.  I tell you, if you were here, and if I could paint a bit every day, I should be quite happy. The \"subjects\" are endless, and in particular I long to do great big stretches of this bleak brown land. Well, it can't be helped, so it's no good thinking about it.   _October 29._  We are moving to a \"back area\" to-morrow.   [Illustration: A WOUNDED TANK This Tank got hit as it was walking over a house in FLERS. They covered it up with tarpaulins to prevent the Hun aeroplanes from obtaining too much information about it. The black stuff is shrapnel. The pink clouds are sent up by crumps as they explode amongst the remains of the brick houses.]   _November 1._  It's a superb day, and we are back at ----, one of our old billets, right away from the beastliness. And although leave won't be for another week or two, still, it will come soon. And Swallow is in tremendous spirits.  Here is a drawing done surreptitiously of a tank in full view of Fritz. You see those little stumps of trees? Well, I'll tell you what those are called when we meet, and also what village is just on their left. You may say it was stupid to sit in full view of Fritz, but it was the day after an advance, and there's hardly ever anything doing then in the way of sniping. The guns, of course, are all pooping off, but they weren't shelling just there, so it was quite safe. This drawing gives you some idea of the desolation, but none of the unevenness of the ground. You can't walk in a bee-line for three yards without getting into a hole. The last time I was in those parts, by the way, I came on a rather jolly cottage wineglass that had been thrown out into some soft mud, and was not even cracked.   _November 6._  [Sidenote: COCQUEREL]  An extraordinary change. Let me now give you an idea.  We are in a pretty little country village miles and miles away, and (although one of Fritz's aeroplanes flew over the church as bold as brass just before we got in) the quiet and peace of the place is very refreshing. And, droll to relate, I'm writing this in bed, with a touch of flu--such a bed, too, all soft and billowy. In ordinary life it would be condemned as a \"feather\" bed, but now it is a bed for princes.  And the room. A rather dark old-fashioned paper, an old clock ticking, an old shining chest of drawers with a marble top, and clothes hanging on pegs. Hale has arranged the pistol, and ammunition, and maps, and gas helmets, and steel helmet, and spare kit, with great elaboration, all over the room. At the present moment he is \"sweeping out\" with the appropriate hissing noises. The dust will, I hope, subside during the course of the day.  Hunt has got Jezebel, Swallow, and Tank into a disused barn, where they will be warm and happy.  Out of the window I can see hens pecking in an orchard, and an old grey pony browsing. The leaves are yellow, and there's no wind.  The old man and the old lady to whom the cottage belong have brought me in some little \"rem√®des,\" which Tim refuses to let me have. One is what the old man (an ex-chemist) calls \"salicite de m√©tal,\" and the other is what the old lady calls a \"rem√®de de bonne femme.\" You rub yourself with it all over every two hours!  Tick, tick, tick, tick. Lovely! The old clock is rumbling. It is about to strike twelve.  It has struck twelve--no, not struck twelve, rather it has buzzed twelve, like some old happy bee.  The hens are still pecking about in the orchard, and the grey pony is rubbing himself against a tree.  All so cosy and delicious. Now for a doze.   _November 7._  [Sidenote: DOZING]  Here's a poem. It's called  HENS.      At the end of the war             (Ring, bells, merry bells!)               We intend             To keep hens,               Me and Helen.             (Ring, bells!)               Such hens!             (Merry bells!)     And though all our hens' eggs be surrounded by shells,     We shall laugh and not care;     For there won't be no war,     And no hell any more,     While Helen is there     With the hens.  I've just made that up, and the inspiration of so profound an epic has made me want to doze again. Such a lot of dozing!   _November 12._  In to-day's letter I enclose a couple of field post-cards which I found on a Boche dug-out bed-hole.  I've been so busy these last days, up till late hours, and writing has been \"na-poo.\" Leave? Yes, leave will come in time. Probably the first half of December.  How maddening it is for poor old Tom! It's most damnable hard luck being kept there without leave such a long time. And I expect that he also has rather lost interest. At first the men were a great source of interest, and the horses and everything. Then France and the front were very interesting. Lastly, being under fire was very interesting. But now that we are back in Rest, I begin to feel I shall be rather sorry to go through it again. And Tom has had so much of it. Yes, he ought to come home.  The cottage people here have those lovely pale salmon winter chrysanthemums in their gardens. Don't you like them?  Since we arrived in this wee village a week ago, I haven't been on a horse once, and have never seen anything outside the village itself, which consists of one street and a side-lane.   _November 14._  I wasn't able to write yesterday, and there may be several blank days to come.  Roger is temporarily away, and I am in charge. The thing that's happening is this: A and B are coming down to us, and others are going to relieve them. So the arrangements and correspondence are vast. All the billeting of this town is pushed on to my hands, too; and though it's only a small village, there's a good lot to do. I can't collect any thoughts to write to you. You understand, I know, and so I needn't say more. I'll write again at length when things settle down. This sounds muddled. But I count on your understanding that I've got more work to do than I can manage.   _November 16._  [Sidenote: THE OTHER SQUADRONS ARRIVE]  To-day, by some amazing fluke, there's a lull. One squadron has gone. Sir John is on his way down. Julian starts early next week, and Gerald a few days later. So within a fortnight we shall all be together. Which will be good.  Some infantry came in from the line to-day. Oh ye gods! the British infantry! No rewards, honours, no fame, can ever be enough for them. We have not yet gone through what they have to go through, but we have been in and out amongst them all the time, and we know. Thank goodness this spell of dry weather seems to have come for a few days at least. Cold at night is nothing. It's wet at night that just kills men right and left. Alan died yesterday morning. Died of exposure. He caught a chill while we were up in front, and then got much worse, and it finally developed into peritonitis and pneumonia. And now he, too, is dead. We were all very fond of Alan.  Death is such a little thing. A change of air--no more. Death is the last day of Term, the last day of the Year. Regret? That's because we don't understand, quite.   _November 17._  I sent you off another beastly little scrap of paper to-day, because it was impossible to write more. Here (7 p.m.) is another moment, so I snatch it.  Listen. Of course it is true that leave has been cancelled, but we hear (Rumour) that this is only for a few days owing to submarines. _If_ leave reopens again, as seems likely therefore, I go next. I shall have to hand over Orderly Room and all current correspondence, etc. That means, with luck, I leave here on the 2nd. Don't, of course, count on this; but let's toy with the idea.   _November 23._  I am sitting in the sun, having read your letter. The valley of the ---- is below me, a mile wide, all reed-beds and half submerged willows, with the main stream lying like a blue snake amongst pale acres of sedge.  Damn! I was going to write a long and cosy letter, but was called back. I had escaped for an hour from Orderly Room with your letter and a sketchbook, and was caught in the act. No time now.   _November 25._  [S"]]]
