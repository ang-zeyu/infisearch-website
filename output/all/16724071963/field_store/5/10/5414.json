He had just come from Béthisy and had seen no Germans. The officers started arguing whether or no they should wait for an escort. We got impatient and slipped on. Of course there was nothing in Béthisy except a wide-eyed population, a selection of smells, and a vast congregation of chickens. The other two basked on some hay in the sun, while I went back and pleased myself immensely by reporting to the officers who were timorously trotting along that there wasn't a sign of a Uhlan.  We rested a bit. One of us suggested having a look round for some Uhlans from the top of the nearest hill. It was a terrific climb up a narrow track, but our bicycles brought us up magnificently. From the top we could see right away to the forest of Compiègne, but a judicious bit of scouting produced nothing.  Coming down we heard from a passing car that H.Q. were to be at Crêpy-en-Valois, a biggish old place about four miles away to the south the other side of Béthancourt. We arrived there just as the sun was going to set. It was a confusing place, crammed full of transport, but I found my way to our potential H.Q. with the aid of a joyous little flapper on my carrier.  Then I remembered I had left my revolver behind on the hill above Béthisy. Just before I started I heard that there were bags of Uhlans coming along over the hills and through the woods. But there was nothing for it but to go back, and back I went. It was a bestial climb in the dusk. On my way back I saw some strange-looking figures in the grounds of a chateau. So I opened my throttle and thundered past.  Later I found that the figures belonged to the rest of the motor-cyclists. The chateau ought to have been our H.Q., and arriving there they had been entertained to a sit-down tea and a bath.  We had a rotten night--nothing between me and a cold, hard tiled floor except a waterproof sheet, but no messages.  We woke very early (September 1st) to the noise of guns. The Germans were attacking vigorously, having brought up several brigades of Jaegers by motor-bus. The 15th was on our left, the 13th was holding the hill above Béthancourt, and the 14th was scrapping away on the right. The guns were ours, as the Germans didn't appear to have any with them. I did a couple of messages out to the 15th. The second time I came back with the news that their left flank was being turned.  A little later one of our despatch riders rode in hurriedly. He reported that, while he was riding along the road to the 15th, he had been shot at by Uhlans whom he had seen distinctly. At the moment it was of the utmost importance to get a despatch through to the 15th. The Skipper offered to take it, but the General refused his offer.  A second despatch rider was carefully studying his map. It seemed to him absolutely inconceivable that Uhlans should be at the place where the first despatch rider had seen them. They must either have ridden right round our left flank and left rear, or else broken through the line. So he offered boldly to take the despatch.  He rode by a slightly roundabout road, and reached the 15th in safety. On his way back he saw a troop of North Irish Horse. In the meantime the Divisional Headquarters had left Crépy in great state, the men with rifles in front, and taken refuge on a hill south-east of the town. On his return the despatch rider was praised mightily for his work, but to this day he believes the Uhlans were North Irish Horse and the bullets \"overs\"[11]--to this day the first despatch rider contradicts him.  The Division got away from Crépy with the greatest success. The 13th slaughtered those foolish Huns that tried to charge up the hill in the face of rifle, machine-gun, and a considerable shell fire. The Duke of Wellington's laid a pretty little ambush and hooked a car containing the general and staff of the 1st Cavalry Division. The prisoners were remorsefully shot, as it would have been impossible to bring them away under the heavy fire.  We jogged on to Nanteuil, all of us very pleased with ourselves, particularly the Duke of Wellington's, who were loaded with spoils, and a billeting officer who, running slap into some Uhlans, had been fired at all the way from 50 yards' range to 600 and hadn't been hit.  I obtained leave to give a straggler a lift of a couple of miles. He was embarrassingly grateful. The last few miles was weary work for the men. Remember they had marched or fought, or more often both, every day since our quiet night at Landrecies. The road, too, was the very roughest _pavé_, though I remember well a little forest of bracken and pines we went through. Being \"a would-be literary bloke,\" I murmured \"Scottish\"; being tired I forgot it from the moment after I saw it until now.  There was no rest at Nanteuil. I took the Artillery Staff Captain round the brigades on my carrier, and did not get back until 10. A bit of hot stew and a post-card from home cheered me. I managed a couple of hours' sleep.  We turned out about 3, the morning of September 2nd. It was quite dark and bitterly cold. Very sleepily indeed we rode along an exiguous path by the side of the cobbles. The sun had risen, but it was still cold when we rattled into that diabolical city of lost souls, Dammartin.  Nobody spoke as we entered. Indeed there were only a few haggard, ugly old women, each with a bit of a beard and a large goitre. One came up to me and chattered at me. Then suddenly she stopped and rushed away, still gibbering. We asked for a restaurant. A stark, silent old man, with a goitre, pointed out an _estaminet_. There we found four motionless men, who looked up at us with expressionless eyes. Chilled, we withdrew into the street. Silent, melancholy soldiers--the H.Q. of some army or division--were marching miserably out. We battered at the door of a hotel for twenty minutes. We stamped and cursed and swore, but no one would open. Only a hideous and filthy crowd stood round, and not one of them moved a muscle. Finally, we burst into a bare little inn, and had such a desolate breakfast of sour wine, bread, and bully. We finished as soon as we could to leave the nightmare place. Even the houses were gaunt and ill-favoured.  On our way out we came across a deserted motor-cycle. Some one suggested sending it on by train, until some one else remarked that there were no trains, and this was fifteen miles from Paris.  We cut across country, rejoined the column, and rode with it to Vinantes, passing on the way a lost motor-lorry. The driver was tearing his hair in an absolute panic. We told him the Germans were just a few miles along the road; but we wished we hadn't when, in hurriedly reversing to escape, he sent a couple of us into the ditch.  At Vinantes we \"requisitioned\" a car, some chickens, and a pair of boots. There was a fusty little tavern down the street, full of laughing soldiers. In the corner a fat, middle-aged woman sat weeping quietly on a sack. The host, sullen and phlegmatic, answered every question with a shake of the head and a muttered \"N'importe.\" The money he threw contemptuously on the counter. The soldiers thought they were spies. \"As speaking the langwidge,\" I asked him what the matter was.       \"They say, sir, that this village will be shelled by the      cursed Germans, and the order has gone out to evacuate.\"  Then, suddenly his face became animated, and he told me volubly how he had been born in the village, how he had been married there, how he had kept the _estaminet_ for twenty years, how all the leading men of the village came of an evening and talked over the things that were happening in Paris.  He started shouting, as men will--       \"What does it matter what I sell, what I receive? What does      it matter, for have I not to leave all this?\"  Then his wife came up and put her hand on his arm--       \"Now, now; give the gentlemen their beer.\"  I bought some cherry brandy and came away.  I was sent on a couple of messages that afternoon: one to trace a telephone wire to a deserted station with nothing in it but a sack of excellent potatoes, another to an officer whom I could not find. I waited under a tree eating somebody else's pears until I was told he had gone mad, and was wandering aimlessly about.  It was a famous night for me. I was sent off to Dammartin, and knew something would go wrong. It did. A sentry all but shot me. I nearly rode into an unguarded trench across the road, and when I started back with my receipt my bicycle would not fire. I found that the mechanic at Dammartin had filled my tank with water. It took me two hours, two lurid hours, to take that water out. It was three in the morning when I got going. I was badly frightened the Division had gone on, because I hadn't the remotest conception where it was going to. When I got back H.Q. were still at Vinantes. I retired thankfully to my bed under the stars, listening dreamily to Grimers, who related how a sentry had fired at him, and how one bullet had singed the back of his neck.  We left Vinantes not too early after breakfast,--a comfort, as we had all of us been up pretty well the whole night. Grimers was still upset at having been shot at by sentries. I had been going hard, and had had only a couple of hours' sleep. We rode on in advance of the company. It was very hot and dusty, and when we arrived at Crécy with several hours to spare, we first had a most excellent omelette and then a shave, a hair-cut, and a wash. Crécy was populous and excited. It made us joyous to think we had reached a part of the country where the shops were open, people pursuing their own business, where there was no dumbly reproaching glance for us in our retreat.  We had been told that our H.Q. that night were going to be at the chateau of a little village called La Haute Maison. Three of us arrived there and found the caretaker just leaving. We obtained the key, and when he had gone did a little bit of looting on our own.

The mountain's sides   Are flecked with gleams of light and spots of shade;   Here, golden sunshine spreads in mellow rays, and there,   Stretching across its hoary breast, deep shadows lurk.   A stream, with many a turn, now lost to sight,   And then, again revealed, winds through the vale,   Shimmering in the early morning sun.   A few white clouds float in the blue expanse,   Their forms revealed in the clear lake beneath,   Which bears upon its breast a bark canoe,   Cautiously guided by a sinewy arm.   High in the heavens, three eagles proudly poise,   Keeping their mountain eyrie still in view,   Although their flight has borne them far away.   Upon the cliff which beetles o'er the pool,   Two Indians, peering from the brink, appear,   Clad in the gaudy dress their nature craves--   Robes of bright blue and scarlet, but which blend   In happy union with the landscape round.   Near by a wigwam stands--a fire within   Sends out a ruddy glow--and from its roof,   Cone-shaped, a spiral wreath of smoke ascends.   Not far away, though deeper in the woods,   Another hut, with red-men grouped about,   Attracts the eye, and wakens saddened thoughts   Of that brave race who once were masters here,   But now, like autumn leaves, are dying out.--BARRY GRAY.   \"Shtop dat noise! shtop dat noise!\" vociferated Hans Vanderbum, growing red in the face with fury, because his repeated commands had received so little attention.  The scene was deep in the forests of Ohio, a short distance from the Miami river.  An Indian town of twenty-five or thirty lodges here stood, resembling a giant apiary, with its inhabitants flitting in and out, darting hither and thither, like so many bees.  The time was early in the morning of a radiant spring, when the atmosphere was still and charming; the dew lingered upon the grass and undergrowth; birds were singing in every tree; the sky glowed with the pure blue of Italy; and the whole wilderness in its bloom looked like a sea of emerald. Everything was life and exhilaration, one personage alone excepted--Hans Vanderbum was unhappy!  The Indian lodges differed very little from each other, being of a rough, substantial character, built with an eye to comfort rather than beauty.  One at the extreme northern edge of the village is that with which our story deals.  A brief description of it will serve as a general daguerreotype of all those wild abodes.  The wigwam was composed of skins and bark, the latter greatly predominating.  The shape was that of a cone.  The framework was of poles, the lower ends of which were placed in a sort of circle, while the tops were intersected, leaving a small opening, through which the smoke reached the clear air above.  Unsightly and repulsive as this might seem from the outside view, the dwelling, nevertheless, was water-proof and comfortable, and abundantly answered the end for which it was built.  A thin vapor was ascending in a bluish spiral at the top of the lodge indicated.  A Shawnee squaw was occupied in preparing the morning meal, while her liege lord still reclined in one corner, in the vain effort to secure a few minutes more of slumber.  This latter personage was Hans Vanderbum--our friend Hans--a huge, plethoric, stolid, lazy Dutchman, who had \"married\" an Indian widow several years before.  At the time of her marriage this squaw had a boy some three or four years of age, while a second one, the son of the Dutchman, was now just large enough to be as mischievous as a kitten.  They were a couple of greasy, copper-hued little rascals, with eyes as black as midnight, and long, wiry hair, like that of a horse's mane.  Brimful of animal spirits, they were just the reverse of Hans Vanderbum, whose laziness and stupidity were only excelled by his indifference to the dignity and rights of human nature.  Hans Vanderbum lay fiat upon his back, for the atmosphere of the wigwam was too warm for covering, his ponderous belly rising and falling like a wave of the sea, and his throat giving forth that peculiar rattling of the glottis, which might be mistaken for suffocation.  The boys certainly would have been outside, basking in the genial sunshine, had not their mother, Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock, positively denied them that coveted privilege.  The commands of the father might be trampled upon with impunity, but the young half-breeds knew better than to disobey their mother.  \"Shtop dat noise! shtop dat noise!\" repeated Hans, raising his head without stirring his body or limbs.  His broad face seemed all ablaze from its fiery red color, and the threatening fury throned upon his lowering forehead would almost have annihilated him who encountered it for the first time.  As it was, the two boys suddenly straightened their faces, and assumed an air of meek penitence, as if suffering the most harrowing remorse for what they had done; and the father, after glaring at them a moment, as if to drive in and clinch the impression he had made, let his head drop back with a dull thump upon the ground, and again closed his eyes.  The black, snaky orbs of the boys twinkled like stars through their overhanging hair.  Glancing first at their mother, who did not deign to notice them, the eldest picked up his younger brother, who was grinning from ear to ear with delight, and, summoning all his strength, he poised him over the prostrate form of his father for a moment, and then dropped him!  The prolonged snore which was steadily issuing from the throat of the sleeping parent, terminated in a sharp, explosive grunt. As his eyes opened, the boys scrambled away like frogs to the opposite side of the lodge, under the protecting care of their mother.  \"Dunder and blixen!  You dunderin' Dutch Indians, dishturbin' your poor old dad dat is wearing his life out for you!  I'll pound both of you till you're dead!\"  Hans Vanderbum's system had suffered too great a shock for further slumber.  He rose to the sitting position, and, digging both hands into his head, glared at his offspring a moment, and then began his regular lecture.  \"Quanonshet, you little Dutchman, and Madokawandock, you little bigger Dutchman, vot does you t'ink of yourselves?  Vot does you t'ink will become of you, disgracing your parents in this manner?  You oughter be pounded to death to treat your poor old fader in this manner, who is working of himself away to bring you up in the way you ought for to go. Eh? vot do you t'ink of yourself, eh?  Vot do you t'ink of yourself?\" demanded Hans, furiously shaking his head toward the boys at each word.  Quanonshet and Madokawandock were too confounded for reply.  \"Shposing your poor old fader should go crazy!!  Here he is working himself to skin and bone--Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock, ain't you got dat cooked?\"  [Illustration: \"Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock, ain't you got dat cooked?\"]  \"No!\" screamed the wife.  \"You big, lazy man, get up and stir yourself! You don't do anything but sleep and smoke, while _I'm_ working all the flesh off _my_ bones for you!\"  These forcible remarks were made in the pure Shawnee tongue, and were accompanied by gesticulation too pointed and significant for Hans to mistake the spirit in which they were given.  Although it is the invariable custom among the North American Indians for the husband to rule the wife, and impose all burdens upon her, except those of the hunt, and fight, such, by no means, was the case with the present couple.  Hans Vanderbum's body was too unwieldy for him to accompany the young men (or even the old men) upon their hunting expeditions; in short, he contributed nothing toward the support of his interesting family.  The first husband of Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock had been an Indian, with all the characteristics of his race--indolent, selfish and savage; and her life with him had been that of the usual servitude and drudgery.  Accordingly, when she ventured a second time upon the sea of matrimony, she naturally fell into the same routine of labor, planting and cultivating what little corn, beans and vegetables were raised for the family, and doing all the really hard work.  Hans Vanderbum sometimes gathered firewood, and frequently, when the weather was pleasant, spent hours in fishing.  He was an inveterate smoker and sleeper; and, beyond doubt, was perfectly content in his situation. Having been taken a prisoner some years before, and adopted into this branch of the Shawnee tribe, he was offered the hand of Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock in marriage, and accepted it at"]]]
