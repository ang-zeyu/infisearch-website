The very way she throned you in her heart, dropped you on one knee before her footstool.  He had fully justified her belief in him; but he well knew how much of his success he owed to her. Their love had taught him lessons, given him ideals which had not been his before.  But there was nothing selfish or sentimental about Helen. When the most sacred of their experiences crept into his work, and stood revealed for all the world to read; when his art transferred to hard type, and to the black and white of print and paper, the magic thrill of Helen's tenderness, so that all her friends could buy it for four shillings and sixpence, and discuss it at leisure, Helen never winced. She only smiled and said: \"The world has a right to every beautiful thing we can give it. I have always felt indignant with the people who collect musical instruments which they have no intention of playing; who lock up Strads and Cremonas in glass cases, thus holding them dumb for ever to the eager ear of a listening world.\"  Only once, when he had put into a story a tender little name by which Helen sometimes called him, unable to resist giving his hero the bliss he, on those rare occasions, himself felt--he found a firm pencil line drawn through the words, when he looked at the proof sheets, after Helen had returned them to his desk. She never mentioned the matter to him, nor did he speak of it to her; but his hero had to forego that particular thrill, and it was a long time before Ronald himself heard again the words Helen had deleted.  He heard them now, however--murmured very softly; and he caught her to him with sudden passion, kissing her hair.  Yet he meant to go. _In hoc vince_. He must conquer his very need of her, if it came between him and the best thing he had yet done in his work.  He could not face the thought of the parting; but there was no need to face that as yet. A whole fortnight intervened. It is useless to suffer a pang until the pang is actually upon you. Besides, every experience--however hard to bear--is of value. How much more harrowing and vivid would be his next description of a parting----  Then, suddenly, Ronald felt ashamed. His arms dropped from around her. He knew himself unworthy--in a momentary flash of self-revelation he knew himself utterly unworthy--of Helen's generous love, and noble womanhood.  \"My wife,\" he said, \"I won't go. It isn't worth it.\"  Her arms strained around him, and he heard her sob; and, alas--it was the sob of the woman in the long grass, when she clung to the man who had crawled out first. His plot stood out to him once more as the supreme thing.  \"At least,\" he added, \"it wouldn't be worth it, if it costs you so much. It _is_ my strongest plot, but I will give it up if you would rather I stayed at home.\"  Then Helen loosed her detaining arms, and lifting a brave white face, smiled at him through her tears.  \"No, Ronnie,\" she said. \"I promised, when we married, always to help you with your work and to make it easy. I am not going to fail you now. If the new book requires a parting, we will face it bravely. At the present moment we both need luncheon, and I must get out of my habit. Ring, and tell them we shall not be ready for a quarter of an hour, there's a dear boy! And think of something really funny to tell me at lunch. Afterwards we will discuss plans.\"  She had reached the door when Ronald suddenly called after her: \"Helen! Hadn't you something to tell me, too?\"  She turned in the doorway. Her face was gay with smiles.  \"Oh, mine must wait,\" she said. \"Your new plot, and the wonderful journey it involves, require our undivided attention.\"  The sun shone very brightly just then. It touched the halo of Helen's soft hair, turning it to gold. _In hoc vince_ gleamed upon the pane.  For a moment she stood in the doorway, giving him a chance to insist upon hearing that which she had to tell. But Ronald, easily satisfied, turned and rang the bell.  \"All right, sweet,\" he said. \"How lovely you look in the sunshine! If it was business, or anything worrying, I would certainly rather not hear it now. You have bucked me up splendidly, Helen. Seven months seem nothing; and my whole mind is bounding forward into my story. I really must give you an outline of the plot.\" He followed her into the hall. \"Helen! Do come back for a minute.\"  But Helen was half way up the stairs. He heard her laugh as she reached the landing.  \"I am hungry, dear,\" she called over the banisters, \"and so are you, only you don't know it! Crawl out of your long grass, and make yourself presentable before the gong sounds; or I shall send bananas for one, to your study!\"  \"All right!\" he shouted; gave Helen's message to the butler; then went through the billiard-room, whistling gaily.  \"Why, she is as keen as I am,\" he said to himself, as he turned on the hot and cold water taps. \"And she is perfectly right about not coming with me. Of course it's jolly hard to leave her; but I believe I shall do better work alone.\"  His mind went back to Helen's bright face in the doorway. He realised her mastery, for his sake, of her own dread of the parting.  \"What a brick she is!\" he said. \"Always so perfectly plucky. I don't believe any other fellow in the world has such a wife as Helen!\"     CHAPTER III  HELEN TAKES THE INITIATIVE   Having once made up her mind that it was right and wise to let Ronnie go, Helen did not falter. She immediately took control of all necessary arrangements. Nothing was forgotten. Ronnie's outfit was managed with as little trouble to himself as possible. They dealt together, in a gay morning at the Stores, with all interesting items, but those he called \"the dull things\" apparently selected themselves. Anyway, they all appeared in his room, when the time came for packing.  So whole-hearted was his wife's interest in the undertaking, that Ronnie almost began to look upon it as her plan.  It was she who arranged routes and booked his passages.  When Cook's cheque had to be written it was a large one.  Helen took out her cheque book.  \"No, no, dear,\" said Ronnie. \"I must pay it out of my own earnings. It is a literary speculation.\"  Helen hesitated. She knew Ronnie did not realise how much the new building and necessary repairs on the estate were costing her this year.  \"What is your balance at the bank, Ronnie?\"  \"I haven't the remotest idea.\"  \"Darling, why don't you make a note of your last balance on your counterfoil? Then at any moment you can add up all subsequent cheques and see at a glance how you stand.\"  \"Yes, I know, you have explained all that to me before, Helen. But, you see, most of my counterfoils are blank! I forget to fill them in. You can't write books, and also keep accounts. If you really think it important, I might give up the former, and turn my whole attention to the latter.\"  \"Don't be silly, dear! You are blessed with a wife who keeps a careful account of every penny of her own. But I know nothing of your earnings and spendings, excepting when you suddenly remark at breakfast: 'Hullo! Here's a useful little cheque for a thousand'--in much the same tone of voice as you exclaim the next minute: 'Hullo! What excellent hot-buttered toast!' Ronnie, I wish you would manage to invest rather more.\"  \"My dear girl, I have invested heaps! You made me. But what is the use of saving money when there are only ourselves to consider? We may as well spend it, and have a good time. If there were kiddies to leave it to, it would be different. I had so long of being impecunious, that I particularly enjoy feeling bottomless! Besides, each year will bring in more. This African book ought to be worth all the rest put together.\"  Helen was silent; but she sighed as she filled in Cook's cheque and signed it. Ronald had spoken so lightly of the great disappointment of their married life. It was always difficult to get Ronnie to take things seriously. The fact was: he took _himself_ so seriously, that he was obliged to compensate by taking everything and everybody else rather lightly. No doubt this arrangement of relative values, made for success. Ronnie's success had been very rapid, and very brilliant. He accepted it with the unconscious modesty of the true artist; his work meaning immeasurably more to him than that which his work brought him, either in praise or pennies.  But Helen gloried in the praise, kept a watchful eye, so far as he would let her, on the pennies; and herself ministered to the idea that all else must be subservient, where Ronnie's literary career was concerned.  She was ministering to it now, at a personal cost known only to her own brave heart.     CHAPTER IV  FIRELIGHT IN THE STUDIO   It was Ronnie's last evening in England. The parting, which had seemed so far away, must take place on the morrow. It took all Helen's bright courage to keep up Ronnie's spirits.  After dinner they sat together in a room they still called the studio, although Helen had given up her painting, soon after their marriage.  It was a large old-fashioned room, oak-panelled and spacious.  A huge mirror, in a massive gilt frame, hung upon the wall opposite door and fireplace, reaching from the ceiling to the parquet floor.  Ronald, who used the studio as a smoking-room, had introduced three or four deep wicker chairs, comfortably cushioned, and a couple of oriental tables.  The fireplace lent itself grandly in winter to great log-fires, when the crimson curtains were drawn in ample folds over the many windows, shutting out the dank bleakness of the park without, and imparting a look of cosiness to the empty room.  A dozen old family portraits--banished from more important places, because their expressions annoyed Ronnie--were crowded into whatever space was available, and glowered down, from the bad light to which they had been relegated, on the very modern young man whose uncomplimentary remarks had effected their banishment, and who sprawled"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16454"],["title","The Upas Tree: A Christmas Story for all the Year (#3)"],["body","in the firelight, monarch of all he surveyed, in the domain which for centuries had been their own.  The only other thing in the room was a piano, on which Ronnie very effectively and very inaccurately strummed by ear; and on which Helen, with careful skill, played his accompaniments, when he was seized with a sudden desire to sing.  Ronald's music was always a perplexity to Helen. There was a quality about it so extraordinarily, so unusually, beautiful; combined with an entire lack of method or of training, and a quite startling ignorance of the most rudimentary rules.  On one occasion, during a sharp attack of influenza, when he had insisted upon being down and about, with a temperature of 104, he suddenly rose from the depths of a chair in which he had been lying, talking wild and feverish nonsense; stumbled over to the piano, dropped heavily upon the stool, then proceeded to play and sing, in a way, which brought tears to his wife's eyes, while her heart stood still with anxiety and wonder.  Yet, when she mentioned it a few days later, he appeared to have forgotten all about it, turning the subject with almost petulant abruptness.         *       *       *       *       *  But, on this their last evening together, the piano stood unheeded. They seemed only to want two chairs, and each other.  She could hardly take her eyes from his face, remembering how many months must pass before she could see him again. Yet it was Ronnie who made moan, and Helen who bravely comforted; turning as often as possible to earnest discussion of his plot and its possibilities. But after a while even she went under, to the thought of the nearness of the parting.  Though it was late in April, the evenings were chilly; a fire glowed in the grate.  Presently Ronnie rose, turned off the electric light, and seated himself on the rug in the firelight, resting his head against his wife's knees.  Silently she passed her fingers through his hair.  Something in the quality of her silence turned Ronald's thoughts from himself to her alone. \"Helen,\" he said, \"I hate to be leaving you. Shall you be very lonely?\"  She could not answer.  \"You are sure your good old Mademoiselle Victorine is coming to be with you?\"  \"Yes, dear. She holds herself in readiness to come as soon as I feel able to send for her. She and I lived alone together here during eighteen months, after Papa's death. We were very quietly happy. I do not see why we should not be happy again.\"  \"What shall you do all day?\"  \"Well, I shall have my duties in the village and on the estate; and, for our recreation, we shall read French and German, and do plenty of music. Mademoiselle Victorine delights in playing what she calls '_des à quatre mains_,' which consist in our both prancing vigorously upon the same piano; she steadily punishing the bass; while I fly after her, on the more lively treble. It is good practice; it has its fascinations, and it will take the place of riding, for me.\"  \"Shan't you ride, Helen?\"  \"No, Ronnie; not without you.\"  \"Will you and Mademoiselle Victorine drive your four-in-hands in here?\"  \"No, not in here, darling. I don't think I shall be able to bear to touch the piano on which you play to me.\"  \"I don't play,\" said Ronnie. \"I strum.\"  \"True, dear. You often strum. But sometimes you play quite wonderfully. I wish you had been properly taught!\"  \"I always hated being taught anything,\" said Ronald. \"I like doing things, without learning to do them. And I know what you mean, about the times when I really play. But, excepting when the mood is on me, I don't care to think of those times. I never feel really myself when it happens. I seem to be listening to somebody else playing, and trying to remember something I have hopelessly forgotten. It gives me a strained, uncanny feeling, Helen.\"  \"Does it, darling? Then let us talk of something else. Oh, Ronnie, you must promise me to take care of your health out in that climate! I believe you are going at the very worst time of year.\"  \"I have to know it at its worst and at its hottest,\" he said. \"But I shall be all right. I'm strong as a horse, and sound in wind and limb.\"  \"I hope you will get good food.\"  He laughed. \"I expect to have to live on just whatever I can shoot or grub up. You see, the more completely I leave all civilisation, the more correctly I shall get my 'copy.' I can't crawl into the long grass, carrying tins of sardines and bottles of Bass!\"  \"You might take meat lozenges,\" suggested Ronnie's wife.  \"Meat lozenges, darling, are concentrated nastiness. I felt like an unhealthy bullock the whole of the rest of the day when, to please you, I sucked one while we were mountain climbing. I propose living on interesting and unique fruits and roots--all the things which correspond to locusts and wild honey. But, Helen, I am afraid there will be quite a long time during which I shall not be able either to send or to receive letters. We shall have to console ourselves with the trite old saying: 'No news is good news.' Of course, so far as I am concerned, it would be useless to hear of any cause for anxiety or worry when I could not possibly get back, or deal with it.\"  \"You shall not hear of any worries, or have any anxieties, darling. If difficulties arise, I will deal with them. You must keep a perfectly free mind, all the time. For my part, I will try not to give way to panics about you, if you will promise to cable occasionally, and to write as often as you can.\"  \"_You_ won't go and get ill, will you, Helen?\"  She smiled, laying her cheek on the top of his head, as she bent over him.  \"I never get ill, darling. Like you, I am sound in wind and limb. We are a most healthy couple.\"  \"We shall both be thirty, Helen, before we meet again. You will attain to that advanced age a month before I shall. On your birthday I shall drink your health in some weird concoction of juices; and I shall say to all the lions and tigers, hippopotamuses, cockatrices and asps, sitting round my camp fire: 'You will hardly believe it, my heathen hearers, out in this well-ordered jungle, where the female is kept in her proper place--but my wife has had the cheek to march up to-day into the next decade, leaving me behind in the youthful twenties!'--Oh, Helen, I wish we had a little kiddie playing around! I am tired of being the youngest of the family.\"  She clasped both hands about his throat. He might have heard the beating of her heart--had he been listening.  \"Ronald, that is a joy which may yet be ours--some day. But my writer of romances, who is such a stickler for grammatical accuracy, is surely the _younger_ of a family of _two_!\"  \"Oh, grammar be--relegated to the library!\" cried Ronnie, laughing. \"And you really presume too much on that one short month, Helen. You often treat me as if I were an infant.\"  The smile in her eyes held the mother look, in its yearning tenderness.  \"Ronnie dear, you _are_ so very much younger than I, in many ways; and you always will be. Unlike the 'Infant of Days,' if you live to be a hundred years old, you will still die young; a child in heart, full of youth's joyous joy in living. You must not mind if your wife occasionally treats you as though you were a dear big baby, requiring maternal care and petting. You are such a veritable boy sometimes, and it soothes the yearning for a little son of yours to cuddle in her arms, when she plays that her big boy is something of a baby.\"  Ronald took her left hand from about his neck, and kissed it tenderly.  This was his only answer, but his silence meant more to Helen than speech. Words flowed so readily to express his surface thoughts; but when words suddenly and unexpectedly failed, a deeper depth had been reached; and in that silence, his wife found comfort and content.  Ronnie was not all ripples. There was more beneath than the shifting shallows. Deep, still pools were there, and rocks on which might eventually be built a beacon-light for the souls of men. But, as yet, it took Helen's clear and faithful eyes to discern the pools; to perceive the possible strong foundations.  \"Do you remember,\" he said presently, \"the Dalmains coming over last January, with their little Geoff? When I saw that jolly little chap trotting about, and looking up at his mother with big shining eyes, full of trustful love and innocent courage, absolutely unafraid--notwithstanding her rather peremptory manner, and apparently stern discipline--I felt that it must be the making of two people to have such a little son as that, depending upon them to show him how to grow up right. One would simply be obliged to live up to his baby belief in one; wouldn't one, Helen?\"  \"Yes, darling; we--we should.\"  \"I hope you will see a lot of the Dalmains while I am away. Try to put in a good long visit there. And she would come over, if you wanted her, wouldn't she?\"  \"Yes; she will come if I want her.\"  \"You and she are great friends,\" pursued Ronnie, \"aren't you? _I_ find her alarming. When she looks at me, I feel such a worm. I want to slide into a hole and hide. But there is never a hole to be found. I have to remain erect, handing tea and bread-and-butter, while I mentally grovel. I almost pray that a hungry blackbird or a prying thrush may chance to come my way, and consider me juicy and appetising. You remember--the Vicar and _Mrs._ Vicar came to tea that day. She wore brown spots. But even the priestly blackbird, and the Levitical thrush, passed me by on the other side.\"  \"Oh, Ronnie, how silly! I know Jane admires your books, darling!\"  \"She considers me quite unfit to tie your shoe-strings.\"  \"Ronnie, be quiet! You would not be afraid of her, had you ever known what it was to turn to her in trouble or difficulty. She helped me through an awfully hard time, six months before I met you. She showed me the right thing to do, then stood by me while I did it. There is nobody in the whole world quite like her.\"  \"Well, send for her if you get into any troubles while I am"]]]
