XIII. ARDOR  [Illustration: Animez toujours]  As Mélisande leans further and further out of her window, these two themes (_Night_ and _Ardor_) grow increasingly insistent. They are interrupted at Pelléas' words, \"I see only the branches of the willow drooping over the wall,\" by a rich passage for divided violins, violas, and 'cellos (page 124, measure 3), and by a brief phrase to which attention should be drawn because of its essentially Debussy-like quality--the progression in the first measure of page 125 (scored for violins and violas). Then suddenly Mélisande's unloosed hair streams down from the open window and envelops Pelléas, and we hear (a famous passage) in the strings alone, _ff_, a precipitate descending series of seventh-chords built on the familiar whole-tone scale which Debussy finds so impelling (page 127, measure 1).   XIV  [Illustration: Animez toujours]  Then begins (page 128, measure 1) a delectable episode. Over a murmurous accompanying figure given out by violas, 'cellos, harp, and horn, a clarinet sings a variant of the _Mélisande_ theme. The harmonic changes are kaleidoscopic, the orchestral color of prismatic variety. The lovely rhapsody over his belovèd's   XV  [Illustration: Moins vite et passionnément contenu]  tresses which Maeterlinck puts into the mouth of Pelléas is exquisitely enforced by the music. There is ravishing tenderness and beauty here, and an intensity of expression as penetrating as it is restrained. As Mélisande's doves come from the tower and fly about the heads of the lovers, we hear, tremolo in the strings, a variation of her motive. Golaud enters by the winding stair, and the threatening phrase quoted as Ex. XI is heard sombrely in the horns, bassoons, violas, and 'cellos--its derivation from Golaud's own theme (see Ex. VI) is here apparent. The latter motive sounds, _p_, as he warns Mélisande that she will fall from the window if she leans so far out. It is followed by the _Fate_ theme as he departs, laughing nervously. A short interlude is evolved from the _Mélisande_ theme (the _Pelléas_ motive forming a counterpoint), and the _Fate_ and _Vengeance_ motives--the latter outlined, over a roll of the timpani and a sustained chord in the horns and wood-wind, by a muted trumpet, _pp_.  No new thematic matter is presented during the two succeeding scenes (in the vaults under the castle and, afterward, on the terrace), nor are there significant reminiscences of themes already brought forward. The music of the vault scene forms a pointed commentary on the implications of the action and dialogue--in character it is dark-hued, forbidding, sinister. As Golaud and Pelléas emerge from the vaults, much use is made in the orchestra of a jubilant figure in triplets (first given out _fortissimo_ by flutes and oboes, over an undulating accompaniment, on page 152, measure 1) which seems to express a certain irresponsible exuberance on the part of Pelléas; it accompanies his light-hearted remarks about the odor of the flowers, the sheen of the water, and the invigorating air, as they come out upon the sunlit terrace. As the scene changes again, a very short interlude introduces a new theme--that of Little Yniold, Golaud's son, whom he is to use as the innocent tool of his suspicions. This motive, which occurs repeatedly during the ensuing scene, is one of the less important, but most typical and haunting ones, in the entire score. It is first presented (page 158, measure 4) by the oboe, _doux et expressif_:   XVI. YNIOLD  [Illustration: _p doux et expressif_]  It is heard again as an accompaniment to Yniold's naïve answers to Golaud's interrogations (page 160); when he cries out that his father, in his agitation, has hurt him (page 164); and, in a particularly touching form, on page 165, measure 4, when Golaud promises that he will give him a present on the morrow if Yniold will tell him what he knows concerning Mélisande and Pelléas. We hear the _Pelléas_ theme in the strings and wood-wind (page 172, measure 7) when Yniold says that they \"weep always in the dark,\" and that \"that makes one weep also,\" and again when he tells of having seen them kiss one day--\"when it rained.\" Thereafter it is heard repeatedly in varying forms to the end of the scene, at times underlying a persistent triplet-figure which has the effect of an inverted pedal-point. A tumultuous and agitated _crescendo_ passage brings the act to a portentous close.     ACT IV  A variant of the _Pelléas_ theme, with the opening notes of the _Fate_ motive as an under voice, begins the short prelude to the fourth act; there is a hint of the _Yniold_ theme, and the first two notes of the _Pelléas_ motive introduce the first scene. The interview between Mélisande and her lover, in which they arrange their tryst at the fountain in the park, is treated with restraint; an expressive phrase sung by the 'cellos (page 194, measure 11) may be noted at the point where Pelléas informs Mélisande that she will look in vain for his return after he has gone. The _Mélisande_ theme, in a new form, opens the moving scene between Mélisande and Arkël in which he tells her of his compassionate observation of her since first she came to the castle. During his speech and her replies we hear her motive and that of _Fate_ (page 205), the latter theme announcing the entrance of Golaud, distraught, blood-bespattered, seeking, he says, his sword. The music of the ensuing scene does not call for extended description--rather for the single comment that in it Debussy has proved once for all his power of forceful, direct, and tangible dramatic utterance: the music here, to apply to it Golaud's phrase in the play, is compact of \"blood and iron\"--as well it needed to be for the accentuation of this perturbing and violent episode. The _Fate_ motive courses ominously through its earlier portions. We hear, too, what I have called the \"second\" _Mélisande_ theme--that which seems to denote her naïveté (see Ex. IV), and a strange variant of the first _Mélisande_ theme (page 212, measure 4). At the climax of the scene, when Golaud seizes his wife by her long hair and flings her from side to side, the music is as brutal, as \"virile,\" as the most exigent could reasonably demand. Later, as he hints at his purpose,--\"I shall await my chance,\"--the trombones, tubas, and double-basses _pizzicato_ mutter, _pp_, the motive of _Vengeance_. The orchestral interlude is long and elaborate. We hear a variant of the _Fate_ theme, which reaches a climax in a _fortissimo_ outburst of the full orchestra. The theme in this form is developed at length; there is a reminiscence of the _Mélisande_ theme, and the music, by a gradual _diminuendo_, passes into the third scene of the act--in the park, before the Fountain of the Blind. At the beginning occurs the incident of the passing flock of sheep observed by Yniold. This scene need not detain us long, since it is musically as well as dramatically episodic. There are no new themes, and no significant recurrences of familiar ones, though the music is rich in suggestive and imaginative details; as I have previously noted, it is omitted in the performances at the Opéra-Comique.  Pelléas enters, and there is an impassioned declaration of his theme, scored, _f_, for wood-wind, horns, and strings, as he observes that he is about to depart, \"crying out for joy and woe like a blind man fleeing from his burning house.\" There is a return of the _Mélisande_ theme; and then, as she herself enters, and Pelléas urges her not to stay at the edge of the moonlight, but to come with him into the shadow of the linden, there enters a theme of great beauty and tenderness, announced, _mystérieusement_, by horns and 'cellos (page 236, measure 6). I may call it, for want of a better name, the motive of _The Shadows_, since it appears only in association with the thought of sheltering darkness and concealment:   XVII. THE SHADOWS  [Illustration: Modéré]  We hear the _Fate_ motive when Mélisande warns Pelléas that it is late, that they must take care, as the gates of the castle will soon be closed for the night. There is a gracious variant of this motive as Mélisande tells how she caught her gown on the nails of the gate as she left the castle, and so was delayed. Then comes a reminiscence of the _Fountain_ theme (the authentic wonder of which is that it is not a theme at all, but merely a single chord introduced by a grace-note; yet the vividness of its effect is indisputable), suggested, _pp_, by horns and harp, at Mélisande's words: \"We have been here before.\" As Pelléas asks her if she knows why he has bidden her to meet him, strings and horn give out, _pp et très expressif_, a lovely phrase derived from the _Pelléas_ theme (page 242, measure 1). Their mutual   XVIII  [Illustration: Modéré]  confessions of love, so simply uttered in the text, are entirely unaccompanied by the orchestra; but as Pelléas exclaims: \"The ice is melted with glowing fire!\" four solo 'cellos, with sustained harmonics in the violins and violas, sound, _pianissimo_, a ravishing series of \"ninth-chords\" (page 244, measure 6)--a sheer Debussy-esque effect, for the relation between the chords is as absolutely anarchistic as it is deeply beautiful. \"Your voice seems to have   XIX  [Illustration: Lent]  [Illustration]  blown across the sea in spring,\" says Pelléas, and a horn, accompanied by violins in six parts, announces the motive of _Ecstasy_ (page 245, measure 7):   XX. ECSTASY  [Illustration: Modéré]  The 'cellos intone the _Mélisande_ theme as Pelléas tells her that he has never seen anyone so beautiful as she; the theme of _Ecstasy_ follows in the strings, horns, and wood-wind, _forte_; the theme of _The Shadows_ returns as Pelléas again invites her into the darkness beneath the trees; there is a dolorous hint of the _Mélisande_ theme"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16494"],["title","The Transvaal from Within: A Private Record of Public Affairs (#0)"],["body","TRANSVAAL FROM WITHIN  A Private Record of Public Affairs  BY J.P. FITZPATRICK AUTHOR OF 'THE OUTSPAN'   LONDON WILLIAM HEINEMANN 1899   _Written August, 1896. Privately circulated June, 1899. Supplemented and published September 1899._    PREFACE   It was originally designed to compile a statement of the occurrences of 1895-6 in the Transvaal and of the conditions which led up to them, in the hope of removing the very grave misunderstandings which existed. Everybody else had been heard and judged, the Uitlander had only been judged. It therefore seemed proper that somebody should attempt to present the case for the Uitlander. The writer, as a South African by birth, as a resident in the Transvaal since 1884, and lastly as Secretary of the Reform Committee, felt impelled to do this, but suffered under the disability of President Kruger's three years' ban; and although it might possibly have been urged that a plain statement of facts and explanations of past actions could not be fairly regarded as a deliberate interference in politics, the facts themselves when set out appeared to constitute an indictment so strong as to make it worth while considering whether the Government of the Transvaal would not regard it as sufficient excuse to put in force the sentence of banishment. The postponement of publication which was then decided upon for a period of three years appeared to be tantamount to the abandonment of the original purpose, and the work was continued with the intention of making it a private record to be printed at the expiry of the term of silence, and to be privately circulated among those who were personally concerned or interested; a record which might perhaps be of service some day in filling in a page of South African history.  The private circulation of that work during June of the present year led to suggestions from many quarters that it should be supplemented by a chapter or two dealing with later events and published; and the present volume is the outcome of these suggestions.  It is realized that much of what might properly appear in a private record will be considered rather superfluous in a book designed for wider circulation. For instance, a good deal of space is given to details of the trial and the prison life of the Reformers, which are of no interest whatever to the public, although they form a record which the men themselves may like to preserve. These might have been omitted but that the writer desired to make no alterations in the original text except in the nature of literary revision.  The writer may be charged by the \"peace\" party with deliberately selecting a critical and anxious time as opportune to contribute a new factor to those already militating against a peaceful settlement. Two replies could be made to this: one an excuse and one an answer. It would be an excuse that the writer did not deliberately select the time of publication, but that the Transvaal Government in its wisdom chose to impose silence for three years, and that the project with which their action had interfered was resumed at the earliest possible moment. The coincidence of another crisis with the date of emancipation may be an unlucky coincidence, or it may be a result. But there is neither necessity nor intention to offer excuses. The responsibility is accepted and the answer is that a case so sound needs only to be understood, that a recital of the facts must help to dispel the mists of race prejudice and misunderstanding which are obscuring the judgment of many; and that a firm but strictly just and dignified handling of the question by the Imperial Government is the only possible way to avert a catastrophe in South Africa. It is essential therefore that first of all the conditions as they are should be understood; and this record is offered as a contribution to that end. Let the measure of its truth be the measure of its usefulness!  The reader is not invited to believe that the case is presented in such form as it might have been presented by an impartial historian. It is the Transvaal _from within_, by one who feels all the injustice and indignity of the position. With the knowledge, however, that a good case is spoiled by overstatement and with the desire to avoid injustice to others an earnest attempt has been made to state the facts fairly. In how far that attempt has been successful the reader must decide for himself.  J.P.F.   _July, 1899._     NOTE   It has been impossible to avoid in this volume more or less pointed reference to certain nationalities in certain connections; for instance such expressions as \"the Boers,\" \"the Cape Dutch,\" \"the Hollanders,\" \"the Germans,\" are used. The writer desires to say once and for all that unless the contrary is obviously and deliberately indicated, the distinctions between nationalities are intended in the political sense only and not in the racial sense, and if by mischance there should be found something in these pages which seems offensive, he begs the more indulgent interpretation on the ground of a very earnest desire to remove and not to accentuate race distinctions.  General references are also made to classes--\"the civil service,\" \"the officials,\" &c. There are officials in the Transvaal service who would earn the confidence and esteem of the public in any administration in the world. It is hardly necessary to say that there is no intention to disparage them.     CONTENTS  PART I.   CHAPTER I. EARLIER DAYS                                            1   CHAPTER II.

When, before resorting to extreme measures to obtain what the Uitlanders deemed to be their bare rights, the final appeal or declaration was made on Boxing Day, 1895, in the form of the manifesto published by the Chairman of the National Union, President Kruger, after an attentive consideration of the document as translated to him, remarked grimly: 'Their rights. Yes, they'll get them--over my dead body!' And volumes of explanation could not better illustrate the Boer attitude and policy towards the English-speaking immigrants.  'L'État c'est moi' is almost as true of the old Dopper President as it was of its originator; for in matters of external policy and in matters which concern the Boer as a party the President has his way as surely and as completely as any anointed autocrat. To anyone who has studied the Boers and their ways and policy--who has given more than passing consideration to the incidents and negotiations of the present year{01}--it must be clear that President Kruger does something more than represent the opinion of the people and execute their policy: he moulds them in the form he wills. By the force of his own strong convictions and prejudices, and of his indomitable will, he has made the Boers a people whom he regards as the germ of the Africander nation; a people chastened, selected, welded, and strong enough to attract and assimilate all their kindred in South Africa, and then to realize the dream of a Dutch Republic from the Zambesi to Capetown.  In the history of South Africa the figure of the grim old President will loom large and striking--picturesque, as the figure of one who by his character and will made and held his people; magnificent, as one who in the face of the blackest fortune never wavered from his aim or faltered in his effort; who, with a courage that seemed, and still seems, fatuous, but which may well be called heroic, stood up against the might of the greatest empire in the world. And, it may be, pathetic, too, as one whose limitations were great, one whose training and associations--whose very successes--had narrowed, and embittered and hardened him; as one who, when the greatness of success was his to take and to hold, turned his back on the supreme opportunity, and used his strength and qualities to fight against the spirit of progress, and all that the enlightenment of the age pronounces to be fitting and necessary to good government and a healthy State.  To an English nobleman, who, in the course of an interview, remarked, 'My father was a Minister of England, and twice Viceroy of Ireland,' the old Dutchman answered, 'And my father was a shepherd!' It was not pride rebuking pride; it was the ever-present fact which would not have been worth mentioning but for the suggestion of the antithesis. He too was a shepherd, and is--a peasant. It may be that he"]]]
