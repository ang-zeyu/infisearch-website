Jack has saved me from disgrace, from exposing my ignorance. He whispered, 'That would not do, sir; _we_ never eats rice with fish.'\"  Russell's book-shop on King Street was a favorite place of meeting for the Club which recognized Simms as king by divine right. From these pleasant gatherings grew the thought of giving to Charleston a medium through which the productions of her thought might go out to the world. In April, 1857, appeared _Russell's Magazine_, bearing the names of Paul Hamilton Hayne and W.B. Carlisle as editors, though upon Hayne devolved all the editorial work and much of the other writing for the new publication. He had helped to keep alive the _Southern Literary Messenger_ after the death of Mr. White and the departure of Poe for other fields of labor, had assisted Richards on the _Southern Literary Gazette_ and had been associate editor of Harvey's _Spectator_. For Charleston had long been ambitious to become the literary centre of the South. The object of _Russell's Magazine_ was to uphold the cause of literature in Charleston and in the South, and incidentally to stand by the friends of the young editor, who carried his partisanship of William Gilmore Simms so far as to permit the publication of a severe criticism of Dana's \"Household Book of Poetry\" because it did not include any of the verse of the Circle's rugged mentor. _Russell's_ had a brilliant and brief career, falling upon silence in March, 1860; probably not much to the regret of Paul Hayne, who, while too conscientious to withhold his best effort from any enterprise that claimed him, was too distinctly a poet not to feel somewhat like Pegasus in pound when tied down to the editorial desk.  This quiet life, in which the gentle soul of Hayne, with its delicate sensitiveness, poetic insight, and appreciation of all beauty, found congenial environment, soon suffered a rude interruption. As Charleston was the first to throw off the yoke of Great Britain and draw up a constitution which she thought adapted to independent government, so did she first express the determination of South Carolina to break the bonds that held her turbulent political soul in uncongenial association.  Hayne heard the twelve-hour cannonade of Fort Sumter's hundred and forty guns echoing over the sea, and saw the Stars and Bars flutter above the walls of the old fort. He saw Generals Bee and Johnson come back from Manassas, folded in the battle flag for which they had given their lives, to lie in state in the City Hall at the marble feet of Calhoun, the great political leader whom they had followed to the inevitable end. General Lee was in the old town for a little while. A man said to him, \"It is difficult for so many men to abandon their business for the war.\" The general replied, \"Believe me, sir, the business of this generation _is_ the war.\" In the spirit of this answer Charleston met the crisis so suddenly come upon her.  All the young poet's patriotic love and inherited martial instinct urged him to the battle, but his frail physique withheld him from the field, and he took service as an aide on the staff of Governor Pickens.  At the close of the war, wrecked in health, with only the memory of his beautiful home and library left to him, with not even a piece of the family silver remaining from the \"march to the sea,\" Hayne went to the pine-barrens of Georgia, eighteen miles from Augusta, to build a new home.  When the first man and woman were sent out from their garden home, it was not as a punishment for sin, but as an answer to their ambitious quest for knowledge and their new-born longing for a wider life. It was not that the gate of Eden was closed upon them; it was that the gates of all the Edens of the world were opened for them and for the generations of their children. One of those gates opened upon the Eden of Copse Hill, where the poet of Nature found a home and all friendly souls met a welcome that filled the pine-barrens with joy for them. Of Copse Hill the poet says:      A little apology for a dwelling was perched on the top of a     hill overlooking in several directions hundreds of leagues of     pine-barrens there was as yet neither garden nor inclosure near     it; and a wilder, more desolate and savage-looking home could     hardly have been seen east of the prairies.  What that \"little apology of a dwelling\" was to him is best pictured in his own words:      On a steep hillside, to all airs that blow,       Open, and open to the varying sky,       Our cottage homestead, smiling tranquilly,     Catches morn's earliest and eve's latest glow;     Here, far from worldly strife and pompous show,       The peaceful seasons glide serenely by,       Fulfil their missions and as calmly die     As waves on quiet shores when winds are low.     Fields, lonely paths, the one small glimmering rill       That twinkles like a wood-fay's mirthful eye,     Under moist bay-leaves, clouds fantastical     That float and change at the light breeze's will,--       To me, thus lapped in sylvan luxury,     Are more than death of kings, or empires' fall.  Here with \"the bonny brown hand\" in his that was \"dearer than all dear things of earth\" Paul Hayne found a life that was filled with beauty, notwithstanding its moments of discouragement and pain. We like to remember that always with him, helping him bear the burdens of life, was that wifely hand of which the poet could say, \"The hand which points the path to heaven, yet makes a heaven of earth.\"  On sunny days he paced to and fro under the pines, the many windows of his mind opened to the studies in light and shade and his soul attuned to the music of the drifting winds and the whispering trees. When Nature was in darkened mood and gave him no invitation to the open court wherein she reigned, he walked up and down his library floor, engrossed with some beautiful thought which, in harmonious garb of words, would go forth and bless the world with its music.  The study, of which he wrote:      This is my world! within these narrow walls       I own a princely service  was perhaps as remarkable a room as any in which student ever spent his working hours, the walls being papered wholly with cuts from papers and periodicals. The furniture was decorated in the same way, even to the writing desk, which was an old work bench left by some carpenters. All had been done by the \"bonny brown hands\" that never wearied in loving service.  Many of his friends made pilgrimages to the little cottage on the hill, where they were cordially welcomed by the poet, who, happy in his home with his wife and little son, lived among the flowers which he tended with his own hands, surrounded by the majesty of the pines whose      Passion and mystery murmur through the leaves,--       Passion and mystery touched by deathless pain,     Whose monotone of long, low anguish grieves       For something lost that shall not live again.  Hither came Henry Timrod, doomed to failure, loss, and early death, but with soul eternally alive with the fires of genius. In the last days of his sad and broken life William Gilmore Simms came to renew old memories and recount the days when life in old Charleston was iridescent as the waves that washed the feet of the Queen of the Sea. Congenial spirits they were who met in that charming little study where Paul Hayne walked \"the fields of quiet Arcadies\" and      ... gleamings of the lost, heroic life     Flashed through the gorgeous vistas of romance.  Hayne had the subtle power of touching the friendliness in the hearts of those who were far away, as well as of the comrades who had walked with him along the road of life. Often letters came from friends in other lands, known to him only by that wireless intuitional telegraphy whereby kindred souls know each other, though hands have not met nor eyes looked into eyes. Many might voice the thought expressed by one: \"I may boast that Paul Hayne was my friend, though it was never my good fortune to meet him.\" Many a soul was upheld and strengthened by him, as was that of a man who wrote that he had been saved from suicide by reading the \"Lyric of Action.\" His album held autographed photographs of many writers, among them Charles Kingsley, William Black, and Wilkie Collins. He cherished an ivy vine sent him by Blackmore from Westminister Abbey.  Hayne's many-windowed mind looked out upon all the phases of the beauty of Nature. Her varied moods found in him a loving response. He awaited her coming as the devotee at the temple gate waits for the approach of his Divinity:      I felt, through dim, awe-laden space,     The coming of thy veiled face;       And in the fragrant night's eclipse       The kisses of thy deathless lips,     Like strange star-pulses, throbbed through space!  Whether it is drear November and      But winds foreboding fill the desolate night     And die at dawning down wild woodland ways,  or in May \"couched in cool shadow\" he hears      The bee-throngs murmurous in the golden fern,     The wood-doves veiled by depths of flickering green,  for him the music of the spheres is in it all. Whether at midnight          The moon, a ghost of her sweet self,         *       *       *       *       *          Creeps up the gray, funereal sky wearily, how wearily,  or morning comes \"with gracious breath of sunlight,\" it is a part of glorious Nature, his star-crowned Queen, his sun-clad goddess.  To no other heart has the pine forest come so near unfolding its immemorial secret. That poet-mind was a wind-harp, and its quivering strings echoed to every message that came from the dim old woods on the \"soft whispers of the twilight breeze,\" the flutterings of the newly awakened morn or the crash of the storm. \"The Dryad of the Pine\" bent \"earth-yearning branches\" to give him loving greeting and receive his quick response:      Leaning on thee, I feel the subtlest thrill     Stir"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16622"],["title","Literary Hearthstones of Dixie (#7)"],["body"," dusk limbs, tho' all the heavens are still,     And 'neath thy rings of rugged fretwork mark     What seems a heart-throb muffled in the dark.  \"The imprisoned spirits of all winds that blow\" echoed to his ear from the heart of the pine-cone fallen from \"the wavering height of yon monarchal pine.\"  When a glorious pine, to him a living soul, falls under the axe he hears \"the wail of Dryads in their last distress.\"  In the greenery of his loved and loving pines, with memories happy, though touched to tender sadness by the sorrows that had come to the old-time group of friends, blessed with the companionship of the two loving souls who were dearest to him of all the world, he sang the melodies of his heart till a cold hand swept across the strings of his wonderful harp and chilled them to silence.  In his last year of earth he was invited to deliver at Vanderbilt University a series of lectures on poetry and literature. Before the invitation reached him he had \"fallen into that perfect peace that waits for all.\"     \"THE FLAME-BORN POET\"  HENRY TIMROD   A writer on Southern poets heads his article on one of the most gifted of our children of song, \"Henry Timrod, the Unfortunate Singer.\"  At first glance the title may seem appropriate. Viewed by the standard set up by the world, there was little of the wine of success in Timrod's cup of life. Bitter drafts of the waters of Marah were served to him in the iron goblet of Fate. But he lived. Of how many of the so-called favorites of Fortune could that be said? Through the mists of his twilit life, he caught glimpses of a sun-radiant morning of wondrous glory.  Thirty years after Timrod's death a Northern critic, writing of the new birth of interest in Timrod's work, said: \"Time is the ideal editor.\" Surely, Editor Time's blue pencil has dealt kindly with our flame-born poet.  In Charleston, December 8, 1829, the \"little blue-eyed boy\" of his father's verse first opened his eyes upon a world that would give him all its beauty and much of its sadness, verifying the paternal prophecy:      And thy full share of misery     Must fall in life on thee!  In early childhood he was destined to lose the loving father to whom his \"shouts of joy\" were the sweetest strain in life's harmony.  Henry Timrod and Paul Hayne, within a month of the same age, were seat-mates in school. Writing of him many years later, Hayne tells of the time that Timrod made the thrilling discovery that he was a poet; that being, perhaps, the most exciting epoch in any life. Coming into school one morning, he showed Paul his first attempt at verse-writing, which Hayne describes as \"a ballad of stirring adventures and sanguinary catastrophe,\" which he thought wonderful, the youthful author, of course, sharing that conviction. Convictions are easy at thirteen, even when one has not the glamour of the sea and the romance of old Charleston to prepare the soul for their riveting.  Unfortunately, the teacher of that school thus honored by the presence of two budding poets had not a mind attuned to poesy. Seeing the boys communing together in violation of the rules made and provided for school discipline, he promptly and sharply recalled them to the subjects wisely laid down in the curriculum. Notwithstanding this early discouragement, the youthful poet, abetted by his faithful fellow song-bird, persevered in his erratic way, and Charleston had the honor of being the home of one who has been regarded as the most brilliant of Southern poets.  When Henry Timrod finished his course of study in the chilling atmosphere in which his poetic ambition first essayed to put forth its tender leaflets, he entered Franklin College, in Athens, the nucleus of what is now the University of Georgia. A few years ago a visitor saw his name in pencil on a wall of the old college. The \"Toombs oak\" still stood on the college grounds, and it may be that its whispering leaves brought to the youthful poet messages of patriotism which they had garnered from the lips of the embryonic Georgia politician. Timrod spent only a year in the college, quitting his studies partly because his health failed, and partly because the family purse was not equal to his scholastic ambition.  Returning to Charleston at a time when that city cherished the ambition to become to the South what Boston was to the North, he helped form the coterie of writers who followed the leadership of that burly and sometimes burry old Mentor, William Gilmore Simms. The young poet seems not to have been among the docile members of the flock, for when Timrod's first volume of poems was published Hayne wrote to Simms, requesting him to write a notice of Timrod's work, not that he (Timrod) deserved it of Simms, but that he (Hayne) asked it of him. It may be that Timrod's recognition of the fact that he could write poetry and that Simms could only try to write it led to a degree of youthful assumption which clashed with the dignity of the older man. The Nestor of Southern literature seems not to have cherished animosity, for he not only noticed Timrod favorably, but in after years, when the poet's misfortunes pressed most heavily upon him, made every possible exertion to give him practical and much needed assistance.  Upon his return from college, Timrod, with some dim fancies concerning a forensic career circling around the remote edges of his imagination, entered the office of his friend, Judge Petigru. The \"irrepressible conflict\" between Law and Poesy that has been waged through the generations broke forth anew, and Timrod made the opposite choice from that reached by Blackstone. Judging from the character of the rhythmic composition in which the great expounder of English law took leave of the Lyric Muse, his decision was a judicious one. Doubtless that of our poet was equally discreet. When the Club used to gather in Russell's book-shop on King Street, Judge Petigru and his recalcitrant protégé had many pleasant meetings, unmarred by differences as to the relative importance of the Rule in Shelley's Case and the flight of Shelley's Lark.  Henry Timrod was thrust into the literary life of Charleston at a time when that life was most full of impelling force. It was a Charleston filled with memories quite remote from the poetry and imaginative literature which represented life to the youthful writers. It was a Charleston with an imposing background of history and oratory, forensic and legislative, against which the poetry and imagination of the new-comers glittered capriciously, like the glimmering of fireflies against the background of night, with swift, uncertain vividness that suggested the early extinguishing of those quivering lamps. But the heart of Charleston was kindled with a new ambition, and the new men brought promise of its fulfilment.  Others have given us a view of the literary life of Charleston, of her social position, of her place in the long procession of history. To Timrod it was left to give us martial Charleston, \"girt without and garrisoned at home,\" looking \"from roof and spire and dome across her tranquil bay.\" With him, we see her while      Calm as that second summer which precedes       The first fall of the snow,     In the broad sunlight of heroic deeds       The City bides the foe.  Through his eyes we look seaward to where      Dark Sumter, like a battlemented cloud,       Looms o'er the solemn deep.  We behold the Queen City of the Sea standing majestically on the sands, the storm-clouds lowering darkly over her, the distant thunders of war threatening her, and the pale lightnings of the coming tempest flashing nearer,      And down the dunes a thousand guns lie couched,       Unseen, beside the flood--     Like tigers in some Orient jungle crouched       That wait and watch for blood.  We see her in those dark days before the plunge into the darkness has been taken, as      Meanwhile, through streets still echoing with trade,       Walk grave and thoughtful men,     Whose hands may one day wield the patriot's blade       As lightly as the pen.  Thus he gives us the picture of the beautiful city of his love as      All untroubled in her faith, she waits       The triumph or the tomb.  Hayne said that of all who shared the suppers at the hospitable home of Simms in Charleston none perhaps enjoyed them as vividly as Timrod. He chooses the word that well applies to Timrod's life in all its variations. He was vivid in all that he did. Being little of a talker, he was always a vivid listener, and when he spoke, his words leaped forth like a flame.  Russell's book-shop, where the Club used to spend their afternoons in pleasant conversation and discourse of future work, was a place of keen interest to Timrod, and when their discussions resulted in the establishment of _Russell's Magazine_ he was one of the most enthusiastic contributors to the ambitious publication.  While Charleston was not the place of what would be called Timrod's most successful life, it was the scene in which he reached his highest exemplification of Browning's definition of poetry: \"A presentment of the correspondence of the universe to the Deity, of the natural to the spiritual, and of the actual to the ideal.\"  In the environments of Charleston he roamed with his Nature-worshipping mother, who taught him the beauties of clouds and trees and streams and flowers, the glory of the changeful pageantry of the sky, the exquisite grace of the bird atilt on a swaying branch. Through the glowing picture which Nature unfolded before him he looked into the heart of the truth symbolized there and gave us messages from woods and sky and sea. While it may be said that a poet can make his own environment, yet he is fortunate who finds his place where nature has done so much to fit the outward scene to the inward longing.  In Charleston he met \"Katie, the Fair Saxon,\" brown-eyed and with      Entangled in her golden hair     Some English sunshine, warmth and air.  He straightway entered"]]]
