He began the cry of \"Dutchy,\" and, finding that it did not disturb the serenity of the lad, he resorted to more active measures on the way home from school.  He began by knocking off his hat, and when Nick looked at him in a surprised way and asked why he did it, the city youth assumed a pugilistic attitude and answered, \"Greens; what are you going to do about it, Dutchy?\"  \"Be careful of him,\" whispered one of the boys, who felt some sympathy for Nick in his persecutions; \"he's _science_.\"  \"I don't care vat he ain't,\" replied Nick, beginning to lose his temper; \"if he don't lets me be, he'll got into trouble.\"  Just then Nick started to overtake a lad, who tapped him on the back and invited him to play a game of tag. As he passed close to Herbert, that boy threw out his foot and Nick went sprawling headlong, his book and slate flying from under his arm, while his cap shot a dozen-feet in another direction.  The other boys broke into laughter, while several of the girls cried out that it was a shame.  Nick picked himself up, and putting on his cap, turned about to ask Herbert what he meant by such cruelty, when he was confronted by the bully, who had thrown himself into his fancy pugilistic posture, and with one eye shut and his tongue thrust out, said:  \"What are you going to do about it, Dutchy?\"  \"I'll show you vot I do!\"     CHAPTER II.  SCHOOL DAYS.   Nicholas Ribsam proceeded to show Master Herbert Watrous what he meant to do about it.  Paying no heed to the formidable attitude of the city youth, Nick rushed straight upon him, and embracing him about the waist so as to pinion his arms, he threw him flat upon the ground with great emphasis. Then, while Herbert lay on his face, vainly struggling to rise, Nick sat down heavily on his back. Although he could have used his fists with great effect, Nick declined to do so; but, rising some six or eight inches, he sat down on him again, and then repeated the performance very fast, bounding up and down as a man is sometimes seen to do when a horse is trotting; descending each time on the back of Herbert with such vigor that the breath was almost forced from his body.  \"Let me up!\" shouted the victim, in a jerky, spasmodic manner, as the words were helped out; \"that ain't the right way to fight: that isn't fair.\"  \"It suits me better as nefer vas,\" replied the grinning Nick, banging himself down on the back of the struggling Herbert, until the latter began to cry and ask the boys to pull Nick off.  No one interfered, however, and when the conqueror thought he had flattened out the city youth to that extent that he would never acquire any plumpness again, he rose from his seat and allowed Herbert to climb upon his feet.  Never was a boy more completely cowed than was this vaunting youth, on whom all the others had looked with such admiration and awe. He meekly picked up his hat, brushed off the dirt, and looking reproachfully at Nick said:  \"Do you know you broke two of my ribs?\"  \"I dinks I brokes dem _all_: dat's what I meant to do; I will try him agin.\"  \"No, you won't!\" exclaimed Herbert, darting off in a run too rapid for the short legs of Nick to equal.  Nick Ribsam had conquered a peace, and from that time forth he suffered no persecution at school. Master Herbert soon after went back to his city home, wondering how it was that a small, dumpy lad, four years younger than he, was able to vanquish him so completely when all the science was on the side of the elder youth.  Young as was Nick Ribsam, there was not a boy in the school who dared attempt to play the bully over him. The display he had given of his prowess won the respect of all.  Besides this he proved to be an unusually bright scholar. He dropped his faulty accent with astonishing rapidity, and gained knowledge with great facility. His teacher liked him, as did all the boys and girls, and when he was occasionally absent he was missed more than half a dozen other lads would have been.  The next year Nick brought his sister Nellie to school. He came down the road, holding her fat little hand in his, while her bright eyes peered out from under her plain but odd-looking hat in a timid way, which showed at the same time how great her confidence was in her big brother.  Nellie looked as much like Nick as a sister can look like a brother. There were the same ruddy cheeks, bright eyes, sturdy health, and cleanly appearance. Her gingham pantalettes came a little nearer the tops of her shoes, perhaps than was necessary, but the dress, with the waist directly under the arms, would have been considered in the height of fashion in late years.  One daring lad ventured to laugh at Nellie, and ask her whether she had on her father's or mother's shoes, but when Nick heard of it he told the boy that he would \"sit down\" on any one that said anything wrong to Nellie. Nothing of the kind was ever hinted to the girl again. No one wished to be \"sat down\" on by the Pennsylvania Hollander who banged the breath so utterly from the body of the city youth who had aroused his wrath.  The common sense, sturdy frame, sound health, and mental strength of the parents were inherited in as marked a degree by the daughter Nellie as by Nick. She showed a quickness of perception greater than that of her brother; but, as is generally the case, the boy was more profound and far-reaching in his thoughts.  After Nick had done his chores in the evening and Nellie was through helping her mother, Gustav, the father, was accustomed to light his long-handled pipe, and, as he slowly puffed it while sitting in his chair by the hearth, he looked across to his boy, who sat with his slate and pencil in hand, preparing for the morrow. Carefully watching the studious lad for a few minutes, he generally asked a series of questions:  \"Nicholas, did you knowed your lessons to-day?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Did you know efery one dot you knowed?\"  \"Yes, sir,--every one,\" answered Nick respectfully, with a quiet smile over his father's odd questions and sentences. The old gentleman could never correct or improve his accent, while Nick, at the age of ten, spoke so accurately that his looks were all that showed he was the child of German parents.  \"Did nopody gif you helps on der lessons?\"  \"Nobody at all.\"  \"Dot is right; did you help anypodies?\"  \"Yes, sir,--three or four of the girls and some of the boys asked me to give them a lift--\"  \"Gif dem _vat_?\"  \"A lift--that is, I helped them.\"  \"Dot ish all right, but don't let me hears dot nopody vos efer helping _you_; if I does--\"  And taking his pipe from his mouth, Mr. Ribsam shook his head in a way which threatened dreadful things.  Then the old gentleman would continue smoking a while longer, and more than likely, just as Nick was in the midst of some intricate problem, he would suddenly pronounce his name. The boy would look up instantly, all attention.  \"Hef you been into any fights mit nopodies to-day?\"  \"I have not, sir; I have not had any trouble like that for a long while.\"  \"Dot is right--dot is right; but, Nick, if you does get into such bad tings as fightin', don't ax nopodies to help you; _takes care mit yorself!_\"  The lad modestly answered that he did not remember when he had failed to take care of himself under such circumstances, and the father resumed his pipe and brown study.  The honest German may not have been right in every point of his creed, but in the main he was correct, his purpose being to implant in his children a sturdy self-reliance. They could not hope to get along at all times without leaning upon others, but that boy who never forgets that God has given him a mind, a body, certain faculties and infinite powers, with the intention that he should cultivate and use them to the highest point, is the one who is sure to win in the great battle of life.  Then, too, every person is liable to be overtaken by some great emergency which calls out all the capacities of his nature, and it is then that false teaching and training prove fatal, while he who has learned to develop the divine capacities within him comes off more than conqueror.     CHAPTER III.  A MATHEMATICAL DISCUSSION.   The elder Ribsam took several puffs from his pipe, his eyes fixed dreamily on the fire, as though in deep meditation. His wife sat in her chair on the other side, and was busy with her knitting, while perhaps her thoughts were wandering away to that loved Fatherland which she had left so many years before, never to see again. Nellie had grown sleepy and gone to bed.  Mr. Ribsam turned his head and looked at Nick. The boy was seated close to the lamp on the table, and the scratching of his pencil on his slate and his glances at the slip of paper lying on the stand, with the problems written upon it, told plainly enough what occupied his thoughts.  \"Nicholas,\" said the father.  \"Just one minute, please,\" replied the lad, glancing hastily up: \"I am on the last of the problems that Mr. Layton gave us for this week, and I have it almost finished.\"  The protest of the boy was so respectful that the father resumed his smoking and waited until Nick laid his slate on the table and wheeled his chair around.  \"There, father, I am through.\"  \"Read owed loud dot sum von you shoost don't do.\"  \"Mr. Layton gave a dozen original problems as he called them, to our class to-day, and we have a week in which to solve them. I like that kind of work, and so I kept at it this evening until I finished them all.\"  \"You vos sure dot you ain't right, Nicholas, eh?\"  \"I have proved every one of them. Oh, you asked me to read the last one! When Mr. Layton read that we all laughed because it was so simple, but when you come to study it it isn't so simple as you would think. It is this: If New York has fifty per cent. more population than Philadelphia, what per cent. has Philadelphia less than New York?\"  Mr. Ribsam's shoulders went up and down, and he shook like a bowl of jelly."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16472"],["title","Through Forest and Fire (#2)"],["body"," seemed to be overcome by the simplicity of the problem over which his son had been racking his brains.  \"Dot makes me laughs. Yaw, yaw, yaw!\"  \"If you will sit down and figure on it you won't laugh quite so hard,\" said Nick, amused by the jollity of his father, which brought a smile to his mother; \"what is your answer?\"  \"If I hafs feefty tollar more don you hafs, how mooch less tollar don't you hafs don I hafs? Yaw, yaw, yaw!\"  \"_That_ is plain enough,\" said Nick sturdily \"but if you mean to say that the answer to the problem I gave you is fifty per cent., you are wrong.\"  \"Oxplains how dot ain't,\" said Mr. Ribsam, suddenly becoming serious.  The mother was also interested, and looked smilingly toward her bright son. Like every mother, her sympathies went out to him. When Nick told his father that he was in error, the mother felt a thrill of delight; she wanted Nick to get the better of her husband, much as she loved both, and you and I can't blame her.  Nick leaned back in his chair, shoved his hands into his pockets, and looked smilingly at his father and his pipe as he said:  \"Suppose, to illustrate, that Philadelphia has just one hundred people. Then, if New York has fifty per cent. more, it must have one hundred and fifty people as its population; that is correct, is it not, father?\"  Mr. Ribsam took another puff or two, as if to make sure that his boy was not leading him into a trap, and then he solemnly nodded his head.  \"Dot ish so,--dot am,--yaw.\"  \"Then if Philadelphia has one hundred people for its population, New York has one hundred and fifty?\"  \"Yaw, and Pheelatelphy has feefty per cent. less--yaw, yaw, yaw!\"  \"Hold on, father,--not so fast. I'm teacher just now, and you mustn't run ahead of me. If you will notice in this problem the per cent. in the first part is based on Philadelphia's population, while in the second part it is based on the population of New York, and since the population of the two cities is different, the per cent. cannot be the same.\"  \"How dot is?\" asked Mr. Ribsam, showing eager interest in the reasoning of the boy.  \"We have agreed, to begin with, that the population of Philadelphia is one hundred and of New York one hundred and fifty. Now, how many people will have to be subtracted from New York's population to make it the same as Philadelphia?\"  \"Feefty,--vot I says.\"  \"And fifty is what part of one hundred and fifty,--that is, what part of the population of New York?\"  \"It vos one thirds.\"  \"And one third of anything is thirty-three and one third per cent. of it, which is the correct answer to the problem.\"  Mr. Ribsam held his pipe suspended in one hand while he stared with open mouth into the smiling face of his son, as though he did not quite grasp his reasoning.  \"Vot you don't laughs at?\" he said, turning sharply toward his wife, who had resumed her knitting and was dropping many a stitch because of the mirth, which shook her as vigorously as it stirred her husband a few minutes before.  \"I laughs ven some folks dinks dey ain't shmarter don dey vosn't all te vile, don't it?\"  And stopping her knitting she threw back her head and laughed unrestrainedly. Her husband hastily shoved the stem of his pipe between his lips, sunk lower down in the chair, and smoked so hard that his head soon became almost invisible in the vapor.  By-and-by he roused himself and asked Nick to begin with the first problem and reason out the result he obtained with each one in turn.  Nick did so, and on the last but one his parent tripped him. A few pointed questions showed the boy that he was wrong. Then the hearty \"Yaw, yaw, yaw!\" of the father rang out, and looking at the solemn visage of his wife, he asked:  \"Vy you don't laughs now, eh? Yaw, yaw, yaw!\"  The wife meekly answered that she did not see anything to cause mirth, though Nick proved that he did.  Not only that, but the son became satisfied from the quickness with which his father detected his error, and the keen reasoning he gave, that he purposely went wrong on the first problem read to him with the object of testing the youngster.  Finally, he asked him whether such was not the case. Many persons in the place of Mr. Ribsam would have been tempted to fib, because almost every one will admit any charge sooner than that of ignorance; but the Dutchman considered lying one of the meanest vices of which a man can be guilty. Like all of his countrymen, he had received a good school education at home, besides which his mind possessed a natural mathematical bent. He said he caught the answer to the question the minute it was asked him, and, although Mr. Layton may not have seen it before, Mr. Ribsam had met and conquered similar ones when he was a boy.  While he persistently refused to show Nick how to solve some of the intricate problems brought home, yet when the son, after hours of labor, was still all abroad, his father would ask him a question or two so skillfully framed that the bright boy was quick to detect their bearing on the subject over which he was puzzling his brain. The parent's query was like the lantern's flash which shows the ladder for which a man is groping.  The task of the evening being finished, Mr. Ribsam tested his boy with a number of problems that were new to him. Most of them were in the nature of puzzles, with a \"catch\" hidden somewhere. Nick could not give the right answer in every instance, but he did so in a majority of cases; so often, indeed, that his father did a rare thing,--he complimented his skill and ability.     CHAPTER IV.  LOST.   It was two miles from the home of Mr. Ribsam to the little stone school-house where his children were receiving their education. A short distance from the dwelling a branch road turned off to the left, which, being followed nine miles or so, mostly through woods, brought one to the little country town of Dunbarton.  Between the home of Gustav Ribsam and the school-house were only two dwellings. The first, on the left, belonged to Mr. Marston, whose land adjoined that of the Hollander, while the second was beyond the fork of the roads and was owned by Mr. Kilgore, who lived a long distance back from the highway.  Nick Ribsam, as he grew in years and strength, became more valuable to his father, who found it necessary, now and then, to keep him home from school. This, however, did not happen frequently, for the parents were anxious that their children should receive a good school education, and Nick's readiness enabled him to recover, very quickly, the ground thus lost.  There was not so much need of Nellie, and, when at the age of six she began her attendance, she rarely missed a day. If it was stormy she was bundled up warmly, and, occasionally, she was taken in the carriage when the weather was too severe for walking.  The summer was gone when Nick helped harness the roan mare to the carriage, and, driving down to the forks, let Nellie out, and kept on toward Dunbarton, while the little girl continued ahead in the direction of the school-house.  \"I've got to stay there so long,\" said Nick, in bidding his sister good-by, \"that I won't be here much before four o'clock, so I will look out for you and you can look out for me and I'll take you home.\"  Nellie said she would not forget, and walked cheerfully up the road, singing a school song to herself.  The little girl, when early enough, stopped at the house of Mr. Marston, whose girl Lizzie attended school. This morning, however, when Nick called from the road, he was told that Lizzie had been gone some time, so he drove on without her.  The dwelling of Mr. Kilgore stood so far back that Nellie never could spare the time to walk up the long lane and back again, but she contented herself with peering up the tree-lined avenue in quest of Sallie and Bobby Kilgore.  However, they were also invisible, and so it was that Nellie made the rest of the journey alone.  The distance being so considerable, Nellie and Nick always carried their dinners with them, so that, after their departure in the morning, the parents did not expect to see them again until between four and five in the afternoon.  The roan mare was young and spirited, but not vicious, and the boy had no trouble in controlling her.  When half way through the stretch of woods they crossed a bridge, whose planks rattled so loudly under the wheels and hoofs that the animal showed a disposition to rear and plunge over the narrow railing at the side.  But the boy used his whip so vigorously that he quickly tamed the beast, which was not slow to understand that her master was holding the reins.  When Nick was on such journeys as these, he generally carried his father's watch, so as to \"make his connections\" better. The timepiece was of great size and thickness, having been made somewhere in England a good many years before. It ticked so loudly that it sounded like a cricket, and would have betrayed any person in an ordinary sized room, when there was no unusual noise. Nick's own handsome watch was too valuable for him to carry.  The former was so heavy that it seemed to Nick, when walking with it, that he went in a one-sided fashion. However, the lad was quite proud of it, and perhaps took it out oftener than was necessary, especially when he saw the eyes of others upon him.  Nick was kept in Dunbarton so long by the many errands he had to perform, that he was fully an hour late in starting. The mare was spirited enough to make up this time, if urged, but there was no need of doing so, and the boy knew his father would prefer him not to push the animal when no urgency existed.  Thus it came about that when Nick re-entered the main highway that afternoon, and looked in the direction of the school-house, he saw nothing of Nellie, nor indeed of any one coming from the school.  \"She has gone home long ago,\" was his conclusion, as he allowed the mare to drop into a brisk trot, which speedily took him to his house.  When Nick had put away the horse and rendered up his"]]]
