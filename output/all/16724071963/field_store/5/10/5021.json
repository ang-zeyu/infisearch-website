And love, and concord dwell; Here give the troubled conscience ease--   The wounded spirit heal.  3 The feeling heart, the melting eye.   The humble mind bestow; And shine upon us from on high,   To make our graces grow.  4 May we in faith receive thy word,   In faith present our prayers; And in the presence of our Lord,   Unbosom all our cares.  5 Shew us some token of thy love,   Our fainting hope to raise; And pour thy blessing from above,   That we may render praise.       John Newton, 1779, _a._   41     Mear. C.M.  _Dedication_.     (1175)  Oh, thou, whose own vast temple stands,   Built over earth and sea! Accept the walls that human hands   Have raised to worship thee.  2 Lord! from thine inmost glory send,   Within these walls t' abide, The peace that dwelleth without end   Serenely by thy side!  3 May erring minds, that worship here,   Be taught the better way; And they who mourn, and they who fear,   Be strengthened as they pray.  4 May faith grow firm, and love grow warm,   And pure devotion rise, While, round these hallowed walls, the storm   Of earth-born passion dies.       William C. Bryant, 1835   42     Mear. C.M.  _Psalm 122._     (106)  How did my heart rejoice to hear   My friends devoutly say-- \"In Zion let us all appear--   And keep the solemn day!\"  2 I love her gates, I love the road;   The church, adorned with grace, Stands like a palace, built for God   To show his milder face.  3 Up to her courts, with joys unknown,   The holy tribes repair; The Son of David holds his throne,   And sits in judgment there.  4 He hears our praises and complaints;   And, while his awful voice Divides the sinners from the saints,   We tremble and rejoice.  5 Peace be within this sacred place,   And joy a constant guest! With holy gifts and heavenly grace   By her attendants blest!  6 My soul shall pray for Zion still,   While life or breath remains; There my best friends, my kindred, dwell,   There God, my Saviour, reigns.       Isaac Watts, 1719   43     Lisbon. S.M.  _The Sabbath Welcomed._     (81)  Welcome! sweet day of rest,   That saw the Lord arise! Welcome to this reviving breast,   And these rejoicing eyes!  2 The King himself comes near,   And feasts his saints to-day; Here we may sit and see him here,   And love, and praise, and pray.  3 One day in such a place,   Where thou, my God, art seen, Is sweeter than ten thousand days   Of pleasurable sin.  4 My willing soul would stay   In such a frame as this, And sit and sing herself away   To everlasting bliss.       Isaac Watts, 1707   44     Mendebras. 7s & 6s.    D.  _The Sabbath Holy._  O day of rest and gladness,   O day of joy and light! O balm of care and sadness,   Most beautiful, most bright! On thee, the high and lowly,   Before th' eternal throne, Sing Holy! Holy! Holy!   To the great Three in One.  2 On thee, at the creation.   The light first had its birth; On thee for our salvation,   Christ rose from depths of earth. On thee, our Lord, victorious,   The Spirit sent from heaven, And thus on thee, most glorious,   A triple light was given.  3 New graces ever gaining   From this our day of rest, We reach the rest remaining   To spirits of the blest; To Holy Ghost be praises,   To Father and to Son; The church her voice upraises   To thee, blest Three in One.       Christopher Wordsworth, 1858.   45     Auburn. C.M.  _Sweet Day of Rest._     (66)  Come, dearest Lord, and feed thy sheep,   On this sweet day of rest; Oh, bless this flock, and make this fold   Enjoy a heavenly rest.  2 Welcome, and precious to my soul   Are these sweet days of love; But what a Sabbath shall I keep   When I shall rest above!  3 I come, I wait, I hear, I pray;   Thy footsteps. Lord. I trace; Here, in thine own appointed way,   I wait to see thy face.  4 Those are the sweet and precious days   On which my Lord I've seen; And oft, when feasting on his word,   In raptures I have been.  5 Oh, if my soul, when death appears.   In this sweet frame be found, I'll clasp my Savior in mine arms,   And leave this earthly ground.       John Mason, 1683.   46     Auburn. C.M.  _Sabbath Morn._     (60)  How sweetly breaks the Sabbath dawn   Along the eastern skies! So, when the night of time hath gone,   Eternity shall rise.  2 How softly spreads the Sabbath light!   How soon the gloom hath fled! So o'er the new created sight   Celestial bliss is spread.  3 What quiet reigns o'er earth and sea,   Through all the stilly air! So calm may we this Sabbath be,   And free from worldly care.  4 Thus let thy peace, O Lord! pervade   Our bosoms all our days; And let each passing hour be made   A herald of thy praise.  5 This peace of God--how full! how sweet   It flows from Jesus' breast; It makes our bliss on earth complete,   It brings eternal rest.       Edwin F. Hatfield, 1840   47     Auburn. C.M.  _The Lord's Day Morning._     (65)  When the worn spirit wants repose,   And sighs her God to seek, How sweet to hail the evening's close   That ends the weary week!  2 How sweet to hail the early dawn   That opens on the sight, When first that soul-reviving morn   Sheds forth new rays of light!  3 Sweet day! thine hours too soon will cease;   Yet, while they gently roll, Breathe, heavenly Spirit, source of peace,   A Sabbath o'er my soul.  4 When will my pilgrimage be done,   The world's long week be o'er, That Sabbath dawn which needs no sun,   That day which fades no more?       James Edmeston, 1820.   48     Sabbath. 7s, 6 or 8 lines.  _Blessing of the Sabbath._     (94)  Safely thro' another week,   God has bro't us on our way; Let us now a blessing seek,   Waiting in his courts to-day; Day of all the week the best, Emblem of eternal rest.  2 While we seek supplies of grace   Through the dear Redeemer's name, Show thy reconciling face;   Take away our sin and shame; From our worldly cares set free; May we rest, this day, in thee.  3 May the gospel's joyful sound   Conquer sinners, comfort saints, Make the fruits of grace abound,   Bring relief from all complaints; Thus let all our Sabbaths prove, Till we join the church above.       John Newton, 1779. _a._   49     Lischer. (German.) H.M.  _Rejoicing in the Sabbath._     (98)  Welcome, delightful morn!   Thou day of sacred rest; I hail thy kind return;   Lord, make these moments blest; From the low train of mortal toys I soar to reach immortal joys.  2 Now may the King descend,   And fill his throne of grace; Thy scepter, Lord, extend,   While saints address thy face! Let sinners feel thy quickening word, And learn to know and fear the Lord.  3 Descend, celestial Dove,   With all thy quickening powers; Disclose a Savior's love,   And bless the sacred hours; Then shall my soul new life obtain, Nor Sabbaths be indulged in vain.       Hayward, 1806.   50     Spanish Hymn, 7s, 8.  _The Day of Rest._     (91)  Welcome, sacred day of rest!   Sweet repose from worldly care; Day above all days the best,   When our souls for heav'n prepare; Day, when our Redeemer rose,   Victor o'er the hosts of hell; Thus he vanquished all our foes;   Let our lips his glory tell.  2 Gracious Lord! we love this day,   When we hear thy holy word; When we sing thy praise, and pray,   Earth can no such joys afford; But a better rest remains,   Heav'nly Sabbaths, happier days, Rest from sin, and rest from pains,   Endless joys and endless praise.       William Brown, 1822.   51     Last Hope. 7s.  _Sabbath Evening._     (93)  Softly fades the twilight ray Of the holy Sabbath day; Gently as life's setting sun, When the Christian's course is run.  2 Night her solemn mantle spreads O'er the earth as daylight fades; All things tell of calm repose At the holy Sabbath's close.  3 Peace is on the world abroad; 'Tis the holy peace of God-- Symbol of the peace within, When the spirit rests from sin.  4 Savior, may our Sabbaths be Days of peace and joy in thee, Till in heav'n our souls repose, Where the Sabbath ne'er shall close.       Samuel F. Smith, 1843.   52     Lowry. L.M.  _Morning Praise._  Awake, my soul, and with the sun Thy daily stage of duty run; Shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise To pay thy morning sacrifice.  2 Awake, lift up thyself, my heart, And with the angels bear thy part, Who all night long unwearied sing High praises to th' eternal King.  3 Glory to thee, who safe hast kept, And hast refreshed me when I slept; Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake, I may of endless life partake.  4 Lord, I my vows to thee renew; Scatter my sins as morning dew; Guard my first springs of thought and will, And with thyself my spirit fill.       Bp. Ken, 1709.   53     Vigil. S.M.  _Morning Song._     (1169)  See how the morning sun Pursues his shining way; And wide proclaims his Maker's praise, With ev'ry bright'ning ray.  2 Thus would my rising soul Its heavenly Parent sing, And to its great Original The humble tribute bring.  3 Serene I laid me down, Beneath his guardian care; I slept, and I awoke, and found My kind Preserver near.  4 My life I would anew Devote, O Lord, to thee; And in thy service I would spend A long eternity.       T. Scott.   54     Evening Prayer. 8s & 7s.  _Evening Blessing Desired._     (1171)  Savior, breathe an evening blessing,   E'er repose our spirits seal; Sin and want we come confessing,   Thou canst save and thou canst heal.  2 Though destruction walk around us,   Though the arrows past us fly; Angel guards from thee surround us,   We are safe if thou art nigh.  3 Though the night be dark and dreary,   Darkness cannot hide from thee; Thou art he who, never weary,   Watchest where thy people be.  4 Should swift death this night o'ertake us,   And our couch become our tomb, May the morn in heaven awake us,   Clad in bright and deathless bloom.       James Edmeston, 1820.   55     Hursley. L.M.  _Evening Hymn._     (1165)  Sun of my soul, thou Savior dear,   It is not night if thou be near; Oh, may no earth-born cloud arise   To hide thee from thy servant's eyes.  2 When the soft "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16455"],["title","The Otterbein Hymnal (#4)"],["body","of kindly sleep   My weary eye-lids gently steep, Be my last thought, how sweet to rest   Forever on my Savior's breast.  3 Abide with me from morn till eve,   For without thee I cannot live; Abide with me when night is nigh,   For without thee I dare not die.  4 Come near and bless us when we wake,   Ere thro' the world our way we take, Till in the ocean of thy love   We lose ourselves in heaven above.       Rev. J. Keble, 1827.   56     Eventide. 10s.  _Evening of the Day._  Abide with me: fast falls the eventide; The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide! When other helpers fail, and comforts flee, Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me!  2 Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word, But as thou dwell'st with thy disciples, Lord, Familiar, condescending, patient, free, Come, not to sojourn, but abide with me.  3 I need thy presence every passing hour; What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power? Who like thyself my guide and stay can be? Thro' cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me!  4 Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day; Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away: Change and decay in all around I see; O thou, who changest not, abide with me!       Henry Francis Lyte, 1847.   57     Eventide. 10s.  _Closing Hymn._  Savior, again to thy dear name we raise With one accord our parting hymn of praise; We rise to bless thee ere our worship cease, And now, departing, wait thy word of peace.  2 Grant us thy peace upon our homeward way; With thee begun, with thee shall end the day; Guard thou the lips from sin, the hearts from shame, That in this house have called upon thy name.  3 Grant us thy peace, Lord, through the coming night; Turn thou for us its darkness into light; From harm and danger keep thy children free, For dark and light are both alike to thee.       John Ellerton, 1868.   58     Seymour, 7s.  _Evening Devotion._  Softly now the light of day Fades upon my sight away; Free from care, from labor free, Lord, I would commune with thee.  2 Thou whose all pervading eye Naught escapes without, within, Pardon each infirmity, Open fault, and secret sin.  3 Soon, for me, the light of day Shall forever pass away; Then, from sin and sorrow free, Take me, Lord, to dwell with thee.  4 Thou who, sinless, yet hast known All of man's infirmity; Then from thine eternal throne, Jesus, look with pitying eye.       G.W. Doane, 1824.   59     Stockwell. 8s & 7s.  _Evening Meditations._  Silently the shades of evening Gather round my lowly door; Silently they bring before me Faces I shall see no more.  2 O the lost, the unforgotten, Tho' the world be oft forgot! O the shrouded and the lonely! In our hearts they perish not.  3 Living in the silent hours, Where our spirits only blend-- They, unlinked with earthly trouble; We, still hoping for its end.  4 How such holy memories cluster, Like the stars when storms are past; Pointing up to that far heaven We may hope to gain at last.       C.C. Cox   60     Fading, Still Fading P.M., with Refrain.  _Evening Prayer_.  Fading, still fading, the last beam is shining; Father in heaven, the day is declining; Safety and innocence flee with the light, Temptation and danger walk forth with the night. From the fall of the shade till the morning bells chime, Shield us from danger, keep us from crime.  Ref.--Father, have mercy,       Father, have mercy,       Father, have mercy, thro' Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.  2 Father in heaven, O hear when we call; Hear, for Christ's sake, who is Savior of all. Feeble and fainting, we trust in thy might; In doubting and darkness thy love be our light; Let us sleep on thy breast while the night taper burns, Wake in thine arms when morning returns.       Selina Huntingdon   61     God Be With You. P.M.  _Parting Blessing._  God be with you till we meet again, By his counsels guide, uphold you, With his sheep securely fold you, God be with you till we meet again  Cho.--Till we meet, till we meet,       Till we meet at Jesus' feet;       Till we meet, till we meet,       God be with you till we meet again.  2 God be with you till we meet again, 'Neath his wings securely hide you, Daily manna still provide you, God be with you till we meet again.  3 God be with you till we meet again, When life's perils thick confound you, Put his arms unfailing round you, God be with you till we meet again.  4 God be with you till we meet again, Keep love's banner floating o'er you, Smite death's threat'ning wave before you, God be with you till we meet again.       J.E. Rankin D.D.   62     Wonderful Words. P.M.  _Words of Life._  Sing them over again to me,   Wonderful words of life, Let me more of their beauty see,   Wonderful words of life,     Words of life and beauty,     Teach me faith and duty.  Cho.--Beautiful words, wonderful words,         Wonderful words of life,       Beautiful words, wonderful words,         Wonderful words of life.  2 Christ the blessed One gives to all   Wonderful words of life; Sinner, list to the loving call,   Wonderful words of life;     All so freely given,     Wooing us to heaven.  3 Sweetly echo the gospel call,   Wonderful words of life; Offer pardon and peace to all,   Wonderful words of life;     Jesus, only Savior,     Sanctify forever.       P.P. Bliss.   63     Give Me the Bible. P.M.  _The Bible Desired._  Give me the Bible, star of gladness gleaming, To cheer the wand'rer lone and tempest-tossed; No storm can hide that radiance peaceful beaming, Since Jesus came to seek and save the lost.  Cho.--Give me the Bible! holy message shining,         Thy light shall guide me in the narrow way.       Precept and promise, law and love combining,         Till night shall vanish in eternal day.  2 Give me the Bible, when my heart is broken, When sin and grief have filled my soul with fear; Give me the precious words by Jesus spoken, Hold up faith's lamp to show my Savior near.  3 Give me the Bible, all my steps enlighten, Teach me the danger of these realms below; That lamp of safety, o'er the gloom shall brighten, That light alone the path of peace can show.  4 Give me the Bible, lamp of life immortal, Hold up that splendor by the open grave; Show me the light from heaven's shining portal, Show me the glory gilding Jordan's wave.       Priscilla J. Owens.   64     Shirland. S.M.  _Psalm 119._     (170)  Behold! the morning sun   Begins his glorious way; His beams thro' all the nations run,   And life and light convey.  2 But, where the gospel comes,   It spreads diviner light; It calls dead sinners from the tombs   And gives the blind their sight.  3 How perfect is thy word!   And all thy judgments just; Forever sure thy promise, Lord!   And men securely trust.  4 My gracious God! how plain   Are thy directions given! Oh! may I never read in vain,   But find the path to heaven.       Isaac Watts, 1719.   65     Dallas. 7s.  _Book Divine._  Holy Bible, book divine,   Precious treasure, thou art mine; Mine to tell me whence I came;   Mine to teach me what I am.  2 Mine to chide me when I rove;   Mine to show a Savior's love; Mine thou art to guide and guard;   Mine to punish or reward.  3 Mine to comfort in distress,   Suffering in this wilderness; Mine to show, by living faith,   Man can triumph over death.  4 Mine to tell of joys to come,   And the rebel sinner's doom; O thou holy book divine,   Precious treasure, thou art mine.       John Burton, 1805.   66     Evan. C.M.  _Psalm 119._     (155)  Lord! I have made thy word my choice,   My lasting heritage; There shall my noblest powers rejoice,   My warmest thoughts engage.  2 I'll read the histories of thy love,   And keep thy laws in sight, While through the promises I rove,   With ever fresh delight.  3 'Tis a broad land of wealth unknown   Where springs of life arise; Seeds of immortal bliss are sown,   And hidden, glory lies.  4 The best relief that mourners have--   It makes our sorrows blest; Our fairest hope, beyond the grave,   And our eternal rest.       Isaac Watts, 1719.   67     Evan. C.M.  _The Latter Day._     (1018)  Lord! send thy word, and let it fly,   Armed with thy Spirit's power; Ten thousands shall confess its sway,   And bless the saving hour.  2 Beneath the influence of its grace,   The barren wastes shall rise, With sudden flowers and fruits arrayed,--   A blooming paradise.  3 Peace, with her olives crowned, shall stretch   Her wings from shore to shore; No trump shall rouse the rage of war,   Nor murderous cannon roar.  4 Lord! for these days we wait;--these days   Are in thy word foretold; Fly swifter, sun and stars! and bring   This promised age of gold.  5 Amen!--with joy divine, let earth's   Unnumbered myriads cry; Amen!--with joy divine, let heaven's   Unnumbered choirs reply.       Thomas Gibbons, 1769.   68     Evan. C.M.  _The Incomparable Richness of God's Word._   (150)  Father of mercies, in thy word   What endless glory shines! Forever be thy name adored   For these celestial lines.  2 Here may the wretched sons of want   Exhaustless riches find-- Riches above what earth can grant,   And lasting as the mind.  3 Here the fair tree of knowledge grows,   And yields a free repast; Sublimer sweets than nature knows   Invite the longing taste.  4 Here the Redeemer's welcome voice   Spreads heavenly peace around; And life and everlasting joys   Attend the blissful sound.  5 Oh, may these heavenly pages be   My ever dear delight; And still new beauties may I see   And still increasing light.       Anne Steele, 1760.   69     Devizes. C.M.  _The Bible Our Light._     (149)  How precious is the book divine,   By inspiration given! Bright as a lamp its doctrines shine,   To guide our souls to heaven.  2 Its light, descending from above,   Our gloomy world to cheer, Displays a Savior's boundless love,   And brings his glories near.  3 It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts,   In this dark vale of tears; Life, light, and joy it still imparts,   And quells our rising fears.  4 This lamp, through all the tedious night   Of life, shall"]]]
