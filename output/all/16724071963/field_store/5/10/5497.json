Young men may be lively and handsome, but they are inconstant in their attachments. Look not thou for fidelity from those who, with the eyes of the nightingale, are every instant singing upon a different rose-bush. But old men pass their time in wisdom and good manners, not in the ignorance and frivolity of youth. Seek one better than yourself, and having found him, consider yourself fortunate. With one like yourself you would pass your life without improvement.\" I spoke a great deal after this manner (continued the old man), and thought that I had made a conquest of her heart, when suddenly she heaved a cold sigh from the bottom of her heart, and replied: \"All the fine speeches that you have been uttering have not so much weight in the scale of my reason as one single sentence I have heard from my nurse, that if you plant an arrow in the side of a young woman it is not so painful as the society of an old man.\" In short (continued he), it was impossible to agree, and our differences ended in a separation. After the time prescribed by law, she married a young man of an impetuous temper, ill-natured, and in indigent circumstances, so that she suffered the injuries of violence, with the evils of penury. Nevertheless she returned thanks for her lot, and said: \"God be praised that I escaped from infernal torment, and have obtained this permanent blessing. Amidst all your violence and impetuosity of temper, I will put up with your airs, because you are handsome. It is better to burn with you in hell than to be in paradise with the other. The scent of onions from a beautiful mouth is more fragrant than the odour of the rose from the hand of one who is ugly.\"  It must be allowed that this old man put his own case to his young wife with very considerable address: yet, such is woman-nature, she chose to be \"a young man's slave rather than an old man's darling.\" And, _apropos_, Saádí has another story which may be added to the foregoing: An old man was asked why he did not marry. He answered: \"I should not like an old woman.\" \"Then marry a young one, since you have property.\" Quoth he: \"Since I, who am an old man, should not be pleased with an old woman, how can I expect that a young one would be attached to me?\"  \"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,\" says our great dramatist, in proof of which take this story: A certain king, when arrived at the end of his days, having no heir, directed in his will that the morning after his death the first person who entered the gate of the city they should place on his head the crown of royalty, and commit to his charge the government of the kingdom. It happened that the first to enter the city was a dervish, who all his life had collected victuals from the charitable and sewed patch on patch. The ministers of state and the nobles of the court carried out the king's will, bestowing on him the kingdom and the treasure. For some time the dervish governed the kingdom, until part of the nobility swerved their necks from obedience to him, and all the neighbouring monarchs, engaging in hostile confederacies, attacked him with their armies. In short, the troops and peasantry were thrown into confusion, and he lost the possession of some territories. The dervish was distressed at these events, when an old friend, who had been his companion in the days of poverty, returned from a journey, and, finding him in such an exalted state, said: \"Praised be the God of excellence and glory, that your high fortune has aided you and prosperity been your guide, so that a rose has issued from the brier, and the thorn has been extracted from your foot, and you have arrived at this dignity. Of a truth, joy succeeds sorrow; the bud does sometimes blossom and sometimes wither; the tree is sometimes naked and sometimes clothed.\" He replied: \"O brother, condole with me, for this is not a time for congratulation. When you saw me last, I was only anxious how to obtain bread; but now I have all the cares of the world to encounter. If the times are adverse, I am in pain; and if they are prosperous, I am captivated with worldly enjoyments. There is no calamity greater than worldly affairs, because they distress the heart in prosperity as well as in adversity. If you want riches, seek only for contentment, which is inestimable wealth. If the rich man would throw money into your lap, consider not yourself obliged to him, for I have often heard that the patience of the poor is preferable to the liberality of the rich.\"  Muezzins, who call the faithful to prayer at the prescribed hours from the minarets of the mosques, are generally blind men, as a man with his eyesight might spy into the domestic privacy of the citizens, who sleep on the flat roofs of their houses in the hot season, and are selected for their sweetness of voice. Saádí, however, tells us of a man who performed gratuitously the office of muezzin, and had such a voice as disgusted all who heard it. The intendant of the mosque, a good, humane man, being unwilling to offend him, said one day: \"My friend, this mosque has muezzins of long standing, each of whom has a monthly stipend of ten dínars. Now I will give you ten dínars to go to another place.\" The man agreed to this and went away. Some time after he came to the intendant and said: \"O, my lord, you injured me in sending me away from this station for ten dínars; for where I went they will give me twenty dínars to remove to another place, to which I have not consented.\" The intendant laughed, and said: \"Take care--don't accept of the offer, for they may be willing to give you fifty.\"  To those who have \"music in their souls,\" and are \"moved by concord of sweet sounds,\" the tones of a harsh voice are excruciating; and if among our statesmen and other public speakers \"silver tongues\" are rare, they are much more so among our preachers. The Church of Rome does not admit into the priesthood men who have any bodily shortcoming or defect; it would also be well if all candidates for holy orders in the English and Scottish Churches whose voices are not at least tolerable were rejected, as unfit to preach! Saádí seems to have had a great horror of braying orators, and relates a number of anecdotes about them, such as this: A preacher who had a detestable voice, but thought he had a very sweet one, bawled out to no purpose. You would say the croaking of the crow in the desert was the burden of his song, and that this verse of the Kurán was intended for him, \"Verily the most detestable of sounds is the braying of an ass.\" When this ass of a preacher brayed, it made Persepolis tremble. The people of the town, on account of the respectability of his office, submitted to the calamity, and did not think it advisable to molest him, until one of the neighbouring preachers, who was secretly ill-disposed towards him, came once to see him, and said: \"I have had a dream--may it prove good!\" \"What did you dream?\" \"I thought you had a sweet voice, and that the people were enjoying tranquility from your discourse.\" The preacher, after reflecting a little, replied: \"What a happy dream is this that you have had, which has discovered to me my defect, in that I have an unpleasant voice, and that the people are distressed at my preaching. I am resolved that in future I will read only in a low tone. The company of friends was disadvantageous to me, because they look on my bad manners as excellent: my defects appear to them skill and perfection, and my thorn as the rose and the jasmin.\"  Our author, as we have seen, enlivens his moral discourses occasionally with humorous stories, and one or two more of these may fittingly close the present section: One of the slaves of Amrúlais having run away, a person was sent in pursuit of him and brought him back. The vazír, being inimical to him, commanded him to be put to death in order to deter other slaves from committing the like offence. The slave prostrated himself before Amrúlais and said: \"Whatever may happen to me with your approbation is lawful--what plea can the slave offer against the sentence of his lord? But, seeing that I have been brought up under the bounties of your house, I do not wish that at the resurrection you shall be charged with my blood. If you are resolved to kill your slave, do so comformably to the interpretation of the law, in order that at the resurrection you may not suffer reproach.\" The king asked: \"After what manner shall I expound it?\" The slave replied: \"Give me leave to kill the vazír, and then, in retaliation for him, order me to be put to death, that you may kill me justly.\" The king laughed, and asked the vazír what was his advice in this matter. Quoth the vazír: \"O my lord, as an offering to the tomb of your father, liberate this rogue, in order that I may not also fall into this calamity. The crime is on my side, for not having observed the words of the sages, who say, 'When you combat with one who flings clods of earth, you break your own head by your folly: when you shoot at the face of your enemy, be careful that you sit out of his aim.'\"--And not a little wit, too, did the kází exhibit when detected by the king in an intrigue with a farrier's daughter, and his Majesty gave order that he should be flung from the top of the castle, \"as an example for others\"; to which the kází replied: \"O monarch of the universe, I have been fostered in your family, and am not singular in the commission of such crimes; therefore, I ask you to precipitate some one else, in order that I may benefit by the example.\" The king laughed at his wit, and spared his life.--Nor is this tale without a spice of humour: An astrologer entered his house and finding a stranger in company with his wife abused him, and called him such opprobrious names that a quarrel and strife ensued. A shrewd man, being informed of this, said to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16949"],["title","Flowers from a Persian Garden and Other Papers (#6)"],["body","oger: \"What do you know of the heavenly bodies, when you cannot tell what goes on in your own house?\"[10]--Last, and perhaps best of all, is this one: I was hesitating about concluding a bargain for a house, when a Jew said: \"I am an old householder in that quarter; inquire of me the description of the house, and buy it, for it has no fault.\" I replied: \"Excepting that you are one of the neighbours!\"     [10] There is a similar story to this in one of our old         English jest-books, _Tales and Quicke Answeres_, 1535,         as follows (I have modernised the spelling): As an         astronomer [i.e. an astrologer] sat upon a time in the         market place, and took upon him to divine and to show         what their fortunes and chances should be that came to         him, there came a fellow and told him (as it was indeed)         that thieves had broken into his house, and had borne         away all that he had. These tidings grieved him so sore         that, all heavy and sorrowfully, he rose up and went his         way. When the fellow saw him do so, he said: \"O thou         foolish and mad man! goest thou about to divine other         men's matters, and art ignorant of thine own?\"     III  ANECDOTES AND APHORISMS FROM THE \"GULISTÁN,\" WITH ANALOGUES--CONCLUSION.   Besides the maxims comprised in the concluding chapter of the _Gulistán_, under the heading of \"Rules for the Conduct of Life,\" many others, of great pith and moment, are interspersed with the tales and anecdotes which Saádí recounts in the preceding chapters, a selection of which can hardly fail to prove both instructive and interesting.  It is related that at the court of Núshírván, king of Persia, a number of wise men were discussing a difficult question; and Buzurjmihr (his famous prime minister), being silent, was asked why he did not take part in the debate. He answered: \"Ministers are like physicians, and the physician gives medicine to the sick only. Therefore, when I see your opinions are judicious, it would not be consistent with wisdom for me to obtrude my sentiments. When a matter can be managed without my interference it is not proper for me to speak on the subject. But if I see a blind man in the way of a well, should I keep silence it were a crime.\" On another occasion, when some Indian sages were discoursing on his virtue, they could discover in him only this fault, that he hesitated in his speech, so that his hearers were kept a long time in suspense before he delivered his sentiments. Buzurjmihr overheard their conversation and observed: \"It is better to deliberate before I speak than to repent of what I have said.\"[11]     [11] The sayings of Buzurjmihr, the sagacious prime minister         of King Núshírván, are often cited by Persian writers,         and a curious story of his precocity when a mere youth         is told in the _Latá'yif at-Taw'áyif_, a Persian         collection, made by Al-Káshifí, of which a translation         will be found in my \"Analogues and Variants\" of the         Tales in vol. iii of Sir R. F. Burton's _Supplemental         Arabian Nights_, pp. 567-9--too long for reproduction         here.  A parallel to this last saying of the Persian vazír is found in a \"notable sentence\" of a wise Greek, in this passage from the _Dictes, or Sayings of Philosophers_, printed by Caxton (I have modernised the spelling):  \"There came before a certain king three wise men, a Greek, a Jew, and a Saracen, of whom the said king desired that each of them would utter some good and notable sentence. Then the Greek said: 'I may well correct and amend my thoughts, but not my words.' The Jew said: 'I marvel of them that say things prejudicial, when silence were more profitable.' The Saracen said: 'I am master of my words ere they are pronounced; but when they are spoken I am servant thereto.' And it was asked one of them: 'Who might be called a king?' And he answered: 'He that is not subject to his own will.'\"  The _Dictes, or Sayings of Philosophers_, of which, I believe, but one perfect copy is extant, was translated from the French by Earl Rivers, and printed by Caxton, at Westminister, in the year 1477, as we learn from the colophon. I am not aware that any one has taken the trouble to trace to their sources all the sayings comprised in this collection, but I think the original of the above is to be found in the following, from the preface to the Arabian version (from the Pahlaví, the ancient language of Persia) of the celebrated Fables of Bidpaï, entitled _Kalíla wa Dimna_, made in the year 754:  \"The four kings of China, India, Persia, and Greece, being together, agreed each of them to deliver a saying which might be recorded to their honour in after ages. The king of China said: 'I have more power over that which I have not spoken than I have to recall what has once passed my lips.' The king of India: 'I have been often struck with the risk of speaking; for if a man be heard in his own praise it is unprofitable boasting, and what he says to his own discredit is injurious in its consequences.' The king of Persia: 'I am the slave of what I have spoken, but the master of what I conceal.' The king of Greece: 'I have never regretted the silence which I had imposed upon myself; though I have often repented of the words I have uttered;[12] for silence is attended with advantage, whereas loquacity is often followed by incurable evils.'\"     [12] Simonides used to say that he never regretted having         held his tongue, but very often had he felt sorry for         having spoken.--_Stobæus_: Flor. xxxiii, 12.  The Persian poet Jámí--the last of the brilliant galaxy of genius who enriched the literature of their country, and who flourished two centuries after Saádí had passed to his rest--reproduces these sayings of the four kings in his work entitled _Baháristán_, or Abode of Spring, which is similar in design to the _Gulistán_.  Among the sayings of other wise men (whose names, however, Saádí does not mention) are the following: A devotee, who had quitted his monastery and become a member of a college, being asked what difference there is between a learned man and a religious man to induce him thus to change his associates, answered: \"The devotee saves his own blanket out of the waves, and the learned man endeavours to save others from drowning.\"--A young man complained to his spiritual guide of his studies being frequently interrupted by idle and impudent visitors, and desired to know by what means he might rid himself of the annoyance. The sage replied: \"To such as are poor lend money, and of such as are rich ask money, and, depend upon it, you will never see one of them again.\"  Saádí's own aphorisms are not less striking and instructive. They are indeed calculated to stimulate the faltering to manly exertion, and to counsel the inexperienced. It is to youthful minds, however, that the \"words of the wise\" are more especially addressed; for it is during the spring-time of life that the seeds of good and evil take root; and so we find the sage Hebrew king frequently addressing his maxims to the young: \"My son,\" is his formula, \"my son, attend to my words, and bow thine ear to my understanding; that thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.\" And the \"good and notable sentences\" of Saádí are well worthy of being treasured by the young man on the threshold of life. For example:  \"Life is snow, and the summer advanceth; only a small portion remaineth: art thou still slothful?\"  This warning has been reiterated by moralists in all ages and countries;--the Great Teacher says: \"Work while it is day, for the night cometh when no man can work.\" And Saádí, in one of his sermons (which is found in another of his books), recounts this beautiful fable, in illustration of the fortunes of the slothful and the industrious:  It is related that in a certain garden a Nightingale had built his nest on the bough of a rose-bush. It so happened that a poor little Ant had fixed her dwelling at the root of this same bush, and managed as best she could to store her wretched hut of care with winter provision. Day and night was the Nightingale fluttering round the rose-bower, and tuning the barbut[13] of his soul-deluding melody; indeed, whilst the Ant was night and day industriously occupied, the thousand-songed bird seemed fascinated with his own sweet voice, echoing amidst the trees. The Nightingale was whispering his secret to the Rose,[14] and that, full-blown by the zephyr of the dawn, would ogle him in return. The poor Ant could not help admiring the coquettish airs of the Rose, and the gay blandishments of the Nightingale, and incontinently remarking: \"Time alone can disclose what may be the end of this frivolity and talk!\" After the flowery season of summer was gone, and the black time of winter was come, thorns took the station of the Rose, and the raven the perch of the Nightingale. The storms of autumn raged in fury, and the foliage of the grove was shed upon the ground. The cheek of the leaf was turned yellow, and the breath of the wind was chill and blasting. The gathering cloud poured down hailstones, like pearls, and flakes of snow floated like camphor on the bosom of the air. Suddenly the Nightingale returned into the garden, but he met neither the bloom of the Rose nor fragrance of the spikenard; notwithstanding his thousand-songed tongue, he stood stupified and mute, for he could discover no flower whose form he might admire, nor any verdure whose freshness he might enjoy. The Thorn turned round to him and said: \"How long, silly bird, wouldst thou be courting the society of the Rose? Now is the season that in the absence of thy charmer thou must put up with the heart-rending bramble of separation.\" The Nightingale cast his eye upon the scene around him, but saw nothing fit to eat. Destitute of food, his strength and fortitude failed him, and in his abject helplessness he was unable to earn himself a"]]]
