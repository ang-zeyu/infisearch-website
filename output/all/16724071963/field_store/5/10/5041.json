If the inventors of our modern industrial machinery are to be considered benefactors of humanity to-day, Berlioz deserves to be considered as the true saviour of the musical world; for, thanks to him, musicians can produce surprising effects in music by the varied use of simple mechanical means.... Berlioz lies hopelessly buried beneath the ruins of his own contrivances\" (_Oper und Drama_, 1851).]  [Footnote 71: Letter from Berlioz to Ferrand.]  [Footnote 72: \"The chief characteristics of my music are passionate expression, inward warmth, rhythmic in pulses, and unforeseen effects. When I speak of passionate expression, I mean an expression that desperately strives to reproduce the inward feeling of its subject, even when the theme is contrary to passion, and deals with gentle emotions or the deepest calm. It is this kind of expression that may be found in _L'Enfance du Christ_, and, above all, in the scene of _Le Ciel_ in the _Damnation de Faust_ and in the _Sanctus_ of the _Requiem_\" (_Mémoires_, II, 361).]  Whatever one may think of this volcanic force, of this torrential stream of youth and passion, it is impossible to deny them; one might as well deny the sun.  And I shall not dwell on Berlioz's love of Nature, which, as M. Prudhomme shows us, is the soul of a composition like the _Damnation_ and, one might say, of all great compositions. No musician, with the exception of Beethoven, has loved Nature so profoundly. Wagner himself did not realise the intensity of emotion which she roused in Berlioz,[73] and how this feeling impregnated the music of the _Damnation_, of _Roméo_, and of _Les Troyens_.  [Footnote 73: \"So you are in the midst of melting glaciers in your _Niebelungen_! To be writing in the presence of Nature herself must be splendid. It is an enjoyment which I am denied. Beautiful landscapes, lofty peaks, or great stretches of sea, absorb me instead of evoking ideas in me. I feel, but I cannot express what I feel. I can only paint the moon when I see its reflection in the bottom of a well\" (Berlioz to Wagner, 10 September, 1855).]  But this genius had other characteristics which are less well known, though they are not less unusual. The first is his sense of pure beauty. Berlioz's exterior romanticism must not make us blind to this. He had a Virgilian soul; and if his colouring recalls that of Weber, his design has often an Italian suavity. Wagner never had this love of beauty in the Latin sense of the word. Who has understood the Southern nature, beautiful form, and harmonious movement like Berlioz? Who, since Gluck, has recognised so well the secret of classical beauty? Since _Orfeo_ was composed, no one has carved in music a bas-relief so perfect as the entrance of Andromache in the second act of _Les Troyens à Troie_. In _Les Troyens à Carthage_, the fragrance of the Aeneid is shed over the night of love, and we see the luminous sky and hear the murmur of the sea. Some of his melodies are like statues, or the pure lines of Athenian friezes, or the noble gesture of beautiful Italian girls, or the undulating profile of the Albanian hills filled with divine laughter. He has done more than felt and translated into music the beauty of the Mediterranean--he has created beings worthy of a Greek tragedy. His Cassandre alone would suffice to rank him among the greatest tragic poets that music has ever known. And Cassandre is a worthy sister of Wagner's Brünnhilde; but she has the advantage of coming of a nobler race, and of having a lofty restraint of spirit and action that Sophocles himself would have loved.  Not enough attention has been drawn to the classical nobility from which Berlioz's art so spontaneously springs. It is not fully acknowledged that he was, of all nineteenth-century musicians, the one who had in the highest degree the sense of plastic beauty. Nor do people always recognise that he was a writer of sweet and flowing melodies. Weingartner expressed the surprise he felt when, imbued with current prejudice against Berlioz's lack of melodic invention, he opened, by chance, the score of the overture of _Benvenuto_ and found in that short composition, which barely takes ten minutes to play, not one or two, but four or five melodies of admirable richness and originality:--  \"I began to laugh, both with pleasure at having discovered such a treasure, and with annoyance at finding how narrow human judgment is. Here I counted five themes, all of them plastic and expressive of personality; of admirable workmanship, varied in form, working up by degrees to a climax, and then finishing with strong effect. And this from a composer who was said by critics and the public to be devoid of creative power! From that day on there has been for me another great citizen in the republic of art.\"[74]  [Footnote 74: _Musikführer_, 29 November, 1903.]  Before this, Berlioz had written in 1864:--       \"It is quite easy for others to convince themselves that, without      even limiting me to take a very short melody as the theme of a      composition--as the greatest musicians have often done--I have      always endeavoured to put a wealth of melody into my compositions.      One may, of course, dispute the worth of these melodies, their      distinction, originality, or charm--it is not for me to judge      them--but to deny their existence is either unfair or foolish. They      are often on a large scale; and an immature or short-sighted      musical vision may not clearly distinguish their form; or, again,      they may be accompanied by secondary melodies which, to a limited      vision, may veil the form of the principal ones. Or, lastly,      shallow musicians may find these melodies so unlike the funny      little things that they call melodies, that they cannot bring      themselves to give the same name to both.\"[75]  And what a splendid variety there is in these melodies: there is the song in Gluck's style (Cassandre's airs), the pure German _lied_ (Marguerite's song, \"D'amour l'ardente flamme\"), the Italian melody, after Bellini, in its most limpid and happy form (arietta of Arlequin in _Benvenuto_), the broad Wagnerian phrase (finale of _Roméo_), the folk-song (chorus of shepherds in _L'Enfance du Christ_), and the freest and most modern recitative (the monologues of Faust), which was Berlioz's own invention, with its full development, its pliant outline, and its intricate nuances.[76]  [Footnote 75: _Mémoires_, II, 361.]  [Footnote 76: M. Jean Marnold has remarked this genius for monody in Berlioz in his article on _Hector Berlioz, musicien (Mercure de France_, 15 January, and 1 February, 1905).]  I have said that Berlioz had a matchless gift for expressing tragic melancholy, weariness of life, and the pangs of death. In a general way, one may say that he was a great elegist in music. Ambros, who was a very discerning and unbiassed critic, said: \"Berlioz feels with inward delight and profound emotion what no musician, except Beethoven, has felt before.\" And Heinrich Heine had a keen perception of Berlioz's originality when he called him \"a colossal nightingale, a lark the size of an eagle.\" The simile is not only picturesque, but of remarkable aptness. For Berlioz's colossal force is at the service of a forlorn and tender heart; he has nothing of the heroism of Beethoven, or Händel, or Gluck, or even Schubert. He has all the charm of an Umbrian painter, as is shown in _L'Enfance du Christ_, as well as sweetness and inward sadness, the gift of tears, and an elegiac passion.         *       *       *       *       *  Now I come to Berlioz's great originality, an originality which is rarely spoken of, though it makes him more than a great musician, more than the successor of Beethoven, or, as some call him, the forerunner of Wagner. It is an originality that entitles him to be known, even more fitly than Wagner himself, as the creator of \"an art of the future,\" the apostle of a new music, which even to-day has hardly made itself felt.  Berlioz is original in a double sense. By the extraordinary complexity of his genius he touched the two opposite poles of his art, and showed us two entirely different aspects of music--that of a great popular art, and that of music made free.  We are all enslaved by the musical tradition of the past. For generations we have been so accustomed to carry this yoke that we scarcely notice it. And in consequence of Germany's monopoly of music since the end of the eighteenth century, musical traditions--which had been chiefly Italian in the two preceding centuries--now became almost entirely German. We think in German forms: the plan of phrases, their development, their balance, and all the rhetoric of music and the grammar of composition comes to us from foreign thought, slowly elaborated by German masters. That domination has never been more complete or more heavy since Wagner's victory. Then reigned over the world this great German period--a scaly monster with a thousand arms, whose grasp was so extensive that it included pages, scenes, acts, and whole dramas in its embrace. We cannot say that French writers have ever tried to write in the style of Goethe or Schiller; but French composers have tried and are still trying to write music after the manner of German musicians.  Why be astonished at it? Let us face the matter plainly. In music we have not, so to speak, any masters of French style. All our greatest composers are foreigners. The founder of the first school of French opera, Lulli, was Florentine; the founder of the second school, Gluck, was German; the two founders of the third school were Rossini, an Italian, and Meyerbeer, a German; the creators of _opéra-comique_ were Duni, an Italian, and Gretry, a Belgian; Franck, who revolutionised our modern school of opera, was also Belgian. These men brought with them a style peculiar to their race; or "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],["title","Musicians of To-Day (#8)"],["body","they tried to found, as Gluck did, an \"international\" style,[77] by which they effaced the more individual characteristics of the French spirit. The most French of all these styles is the _opéra-comique_, the work of two foreigners, but owing much more to the _opéra-bouffe_ than is generally admitted, and, in any case, representing France very insufficiently.  [Footnote 77: Gluck himself said this in a letter to the _Mercure de France_, February, 1773.]  Some more rational minds have tried to rid themselves of this Italian and German influence, but have mostly arrived at creating an intermediate Germano-Italian style, of which the operas of Auber and Ambroise Thomas are a type.  Before Berlioz's time there was really only one master of the first rank who made a great effort to liberate French music: it was Rameau; and, despite his genius, he was conquered by Italian art.[78]  By force of circumstance, therefore, French music found itself moulded in foreign musical forms. And in the same way that Germany in the eighteenth century tried to imitate French architecture and literature, so France in the nineteenth century acquired the habit of speaking German in music. As most men speak more than they think, even thought itself became Germanised; and it was difficult then to discover, through this traditional insincerity, the true and spontaneous form of French musical thought.  But Berlioz's genius found it by instinct. From the first he strove to free French music from the oppression of the foreign tradition that was suffocating it.[79]  [Footnote 78: I am not speaking of the Franco-Flemish masters at the end of the sixteenth century: of Jannequin, Costeley, Claude le Jeune, or Mauduit, recently discovered by M. Henry Expert, who are possessed of so original a flavour, and have yet remained almost entirely unknown from their own time to ours. Religious wars bruised France's musical traditions and denied some of the grandeur of her art.]  [Footnote 79: It is amusing to find Wagner comparing Berlioz with Auber, as the type of a true French musician--Auber and his mixed Italian and German opera. That shows how Wagner, like most Germans, was incapable of grasping the real originality of French music, and how he saw only its externals. The best way to find out the musical characteristics of a nation is to study its folk-songs. If only someone would devote himself to the study of French folk-song (and there is no lack of material), people would realise perhaps how much it differs from German folk-song, and how the temperament of the French race shows itself there as being sweeter and freer, more vigorous and more expressive.]  He was fitted in every way for the part, even by his deficiencies and his ignorance. His classical education in music was incomplete. M. Saint-Saëns tells us that \"the past did not exist for him; he did not understand the old composers, as his knowledge of them was limited to what he had read about them.\" He did not know Bach. Happy ignorance! He was able to write oratorios like _L'Enfance du Christ_ without being worried by memories and traditions of the German masters of oratorio. There are men like Brahms who have been, nearly all their life, but reflections of the past. Berlioz never sought to be anything but himself. It was thus that he created that masterpiece, _La Fuite en Égypte_, which sprang from his keen sympathy with the people.  He had one of the most untrammelled spirits that ever breathed. Liberty was for him a desperate necessity. \"Liberty of heart, of mind, of soul--of everything.... Real liberty, absolute and immense!\"[80] And this passionate love of liberty, which was his misfortune in life, since it deprived him of the comfort of any faith, refused him any refuge for his thoughts, robbed him of peace, and even of the soft pillow of scepticism--this \"real liberty\" formed the unique originality and grandeur of his musical conceptions.  [Footnote 80: _Mémoires_, I, 221.]       \"Music,\" wrote Berlioz to C. Lobe, in 1852, \"is the most poetic,      the most powerful, the most living of all arts. She ought to be the      freest, but she is not yet.... Modern music is like the classic      Andromeda, naked and divinely beautiful. She is chained to a rock      on the shores of a vast sea, and awaits the victorious Perseus who      shall loose her bonds and break in pieces the chimera called      Routine.\"  The business was to free music from its limited rhythms and from the traditional forms and rules that enclosed it;[81] and, above all, it needed to be free from the domination of speech, and to be released from its humiliating bondage to poetry. Berlioz wrote to the Princess of Wittgenstein, in 1856:--  [Footnote 81: \"Music to-day, in the vigour of her youth, is emancipated and free and can do what she pleases. Many old rules have no longer any vogue; they were made by unreflecting minds, or by lovers of routine for other lovers of routine. New needs of the mind, of the heart, and of the sense of hearing, make necessary new endeavours and, in some cases, the breaking of ancient laws. Many forms have become too hackneyed to be still adopted. The same thing may be entirely good or entirely bad, according to the use one makes of it, or the reasons one has for making use of it. Sound and sonority are secondary to thought, and thought is secondary to feeling and passion.\" (These opinions were given with reference to Wagner's concerts in Paris, in 1860, and are taken from _A travers chants_, p. 312.)  Compare Beethoven's words: \"There is no rule that one may not break for the advancement of beauty.\"]       \"I am for free music. Yes, I want music to be proudly free, to be      victorious, to be supreme. I want her to take all she can, so that      there may be no more Alps or Pyrenees for her. But she must      achieve her victories by fighting in person, and not rely upon her      lieutenants. I should like her to have, if possible, good verse      drawn up in order of battle; but, like Napoleon, she must face the      fire herself, and, like Alexander, march in the front ranks of the      phalanx. She is so powerful that in some cases she would conquer      unaided; for she has the right to say with Medea: 'I, myself, am      enough.'\"  Berlioz protested vigorously against Gluck's impious theory[82] and Wagner's \"crime\" in making music the slave of speech. Music is the highest poetry and knows no master.[83] It was for Berlioz, therefore, continually to increase the power of expression in pure music.  [Footnote 82: Is it necessary to recall the _épître dédicatoire_ of _Alceste_ in 1769, and Gluck's declaration that he \"sought to bring music to its true function--that of helping poetry to strengthen the expression of the emotions and the interest of a situation ... and to make it what fine colouring and the happy arrangement of light and shade are to a skilful drawing\"?]  [Footnote 83: This revolutionary theory was already Mozart's: \"Music should reign supreme and make one forget everything else.... In an opera it is absolutely necessary that Poetry should be Music's obedient daughter\" (Letter to his father, 13 October, 1781). Despairing probably at being unable to obtain this obedience, Mozart thought seriously of breaking up the form of opera, and of putting in its place, in 1778, a sort of melodrama (of which Rousseau had given an example in 1773), which he called \"duodrama,\" where music and poetry were loosely associated, yet not dependent on each other, but went side by side on two parallel roads (Letter of 12 November, 1778).]  And while Wagner, who was more moderate and a closer follower of tradition, sought to establish a compromise (perhaps an impossible one) between music and speech, and to create the new lyric drama, Berlioz, who was more revolutionary, achieved the dramatic symphony, of which the unequalled model to-day is still _Roméo et Juliette_.  The dramatic symphony naturally fell foul of all formal theories. Two arguments were set up against it: one derived from Bayreuth, and by now an act of faith; the other, current opinion, upheld by the crowd that speaks of music without understanding it.  The first argument, maintained by Wagner, is that music cannot really express action without the help of speech and gesture. It is in the name of this opinion that so many people condemn _a priori_ Berlioz's _Roméo_. They think it childish to try and _translate_ action into music. I suppose they think it less childish to _illustrate_ an action by music. Do they think that gesture associates itself very happily with music? If only they would try to root up this great fiction, which has bothered us for the last three centuries; if only they would open their eyes and see--what great men like Rousseau and Tolstoy saw so clearly--the silliness of opera; if only they would see the anomalies of the Bayreuth show. In the second act of _Tristan_ there is a celebrated passage, where Ysolde, burning with desire, is waiting for Tristan; she sees him come at last, and from afar she waves her scarf to the accompaniment of a phrase repeated several times by the orchestra. I cannot express the effect produced on me by that _imitation_ (for it is nothing else) of a series of sounds by a series of gestures; I can never see it without indignation or without laughing. The curious thing is that when one hears this passage at a concert, one sees the gesture. At the theatre either one does not \"see\" it, or it appears childish. The natural action becomes stiff when clad in musical armour, and the absurdity of trying to make the two agree is forced upon one. In the music of _Rheingold_ one pictures the stature and gait of the giants, and one sees the lightning gleam and the rainbow reflected on the clouds. In the theatre it is like a game of marionettes; and one feels the impassable gulf between music and gesture. Music is a world apart. When music wishes to depict the drama, it is not real action"]]]
