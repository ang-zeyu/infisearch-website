In the city of his home he answered his own \"Cry to Arms\" when the \"festal guns\" roared out their challenge. Had his physique been as strong as his patriotism, his sword might have rivaled his pen in reflecting honor upon his beautiful city. Even then the seeds of consumption had developed, and he was discharged from field service. Still wishing to remain in the service of his country, he tried the work of war correspondent, reaching the front just after the battle of Shiloh. Overcome by the horrors of the retreat, he returned to Charleston, and was soon after appointed assistant editor of the _Daily South Carolinian_, published in Columbia. He removed to the capital, where his prospects became bright enough to permit his marriage to Kate Goodwin, the English girl to whom his Muse pays such glowing tribute.  In May, 1864, Simms was in Columbia, and on his return to \"Woodlands\" wrote to Hayne that Timrod was in better health and spirits than for years, saying: \"He has only to prepare a couple of dwarf essays, making a single column, and the pleasant public is satisfied. These he does so well that they have reason to be so. Briefly, our friend is in a fair way to fatten and be happy.\"  This prosperity came to an end when the capital city fell a victim to the fires of war, and Timrod returned to the city of his birth, where for a time the publication of the _South Carolinian_ was continued, he writing editorials nominally for fifteen dollars a month, practically for exercise in facile expression, as the small stipend promised was never paid. With the paper, he soon returned to Columbia, where after a time he secured work in the office of Governor Orr, writing to Hayne that twice he copied papers from ten o'clock one morning till sunrise of the next.  With the close of the session, his work ended, and in the spring he visited Paul Hayne at Copse Hill. Hayne says: \"He found me with my family established in a crazy wooden shanty, dignified as a cottage, near the track of the main Georgia railroad, about sixteen miles from Augusta.\" To Timrod, that \"crazy wooden shanty,\" set in immemorial pines and made radiant by the presence of his poet friend, was finer than a palace. On that \"windy, frowzy, barren hill,\" as Maurice Thompson called it, the two old friends spent together the spring days of '67--such days as lingered in golden beauty in the memory of one of them and have come down to us in immortal verse.  Again in August of that year he visited Copse Hill, hoping to find health among the pines. Of these last days Paul Hayne wrote years later:      In the latter summer-tide of this same year I again persuaded him     to visit me. Ah! how sacred now, how sad and sweet, are the memories     of that rich, clear, prodigal August of '67!      We would rest on the hillsides, in the swaying golden shadows,     watching together the Titanic masses of snow-white clouds which     floated slowly and vaguely through the sky, suggesting by their     form, whiteness, and serene motion, despite the season, flotillas     of icebergs upon Arctic seas. Like lazzaroni we basked in the     quiet noons, sunk into the depths of reverie, or perhaps of yet     more \"charmed sleep.\" Or we smoked, conversing lazily between the     puffs,        \"Next to some pine whose antique roots just peeped       From out the crumbling bases of the sand.\"      But the evenings, with their gorgeous sunsets, \"rolling down like     a chorus\" and the \"gray-eyed melancholy gloaming,\" were the     favorite hours of the day with him.  One of those pines was especially his own, by his love and his choice of its shade as a resting place. Of it Paul Hayne wrote when his friend had passed from its shadows for the last time:      The same majestic pine is lifted high       Against the twilight sky,     The same low, melancholy music grieves       Amid the topmost leaves,     As when I watched and mused and dreamed with him       Beneath those shadows dim.  Such dreams we can dimly imagine sometimes when we stand beneath a glorious pine and try to translate its whisperings into words, and watch \"the last rays of sunset shimmering down, flashed like a royal crown.\" Sometimes we catch glimpses of such radiant visions when we stand in the pine shadows and think, as Hayne did so often after that beautiful August, \"Of one who comes no more.\" Under that stately tree he      Seemed to drink the sunset like strong wine       Or, hushed in trance divine,     Hailed the first shy and timorous glance from far       Of evening's virgin star.  In all his years after, Paul Hayne held in his heart the picture of his friend with head against that \"mighty trunk\" when      The unquiet passion died from out his eyes,       As lightning from stilled skies.  So through that glowing August on Copse Hill the two Southern poets walked and talked and built their shrine to the shining Olympic goddess to whom their lives were dedicated.  When summer had wrapped about her the purple and crimson glories of her brilliant life and drifted into the tomb of past things, Timrod left the friend of his heart alone with the \"soft wind-angels\" and memories of \"that quiet eve\"        When, deeply, thrillingly,     He spake of lofty hopes which vanquish Death;       And on his mortal breath     A language of immortal meanings hung       That fired his heart and tongue.  [Illustration: HOUSE WHERE TIMROD LIVED DURING HIS LAST YEARS 1108 Henderson Street, Columbia, S.C.]  Impelled by circumstances to leave the pines before their inspiring breath had given him of their life, he had little strength to renew the battle for existence, and of the sacrifice of his possessions to which he had been forced to resort he writes to Hayne: \"We have eaten two silver pitchers, one or two dozen silver forks, several sofas, innumerable chairs, and a huge bedstead.\"  We should like to think of life as flowing on serenely in that pretty cottage on Henderson Street, Columbia, its wide front veranda crowned with a combed roof supported by a row of white columns. In its cool dimness we may in fancy see the nature-loving poet at eventide looking into the greenery of a friendly tree stretching great arms lovingly to the shadowy porch. A taller tree stands sentinel at the gate, as if to guard the poet-soul from the world and close it around with the beauty that it loved.  But life did not bring him any more of joy or success than he had achieved in the long years of toil and sorrow and disappointment, brightened by the flame of his own genius throwing upon the dark wall of existence the pictures that imagination drew with magic hand upon his sympathetic, ever responsive mind. On the sixth of October, after that month of iridescent beauty on Copse Hill, came the days of which he had written long before:      As it purples in the zenith,       As it brightens on the lawn,     There's a hush of death about me,       And a whisper, \"He is gone!\"  On Copse Hill, \"Under the Pine,\" his lifelong friend stood and sorrowfully questioned:      O Tree! have not his poet-touch, his dreams       So full of heavenly gleams,     Wrought through the folded dulness of thy bark,       And all thy nature dark     Stirred to slow throbbings, and the fluttering fire       Of faint, unknown desire?  Near the end of his last visit he had told Paul Hayne that he did not wish to live to be old--\"an octogenarian, far less a centenarian, like old Parr.\" He hoped that he might stay until he was fifty or fifty-five; \"one hates the idea of a mummy, intellectual or physical.\" If those coveted years had been added to his thirty-eight beautiful ones, a brighter radiance might have crowned our literature. Or, would the vision have faded away with youth?  On the seventh of October, 1867, Henry Timrod was laid to rest in Trinity Churchyard, Columbia, beside his little Willie, \"the Christmas gift of God\" that brought such divine light to the home only to leave it in darkness when the gift was recalled before another Christmas morn had gladdened the world. The poet's grave is marked by a shaft erected by loving hands, but a memorial more fitting to one who so loved the beautiful is found in the waving grasses and the fragrant flowers that Nature spreads for her lover, and the winds of heaven that breathe soft dirges over his lowly mound.  In Washington Square, Charleston, stands a monument erected in 1901 by the Timrod Memorial Association of South Carolina to the memory of the most vivid poet the South has given to the world. On the west panel is an inscription which expresses to us the mainspring of his character:      Through clouds and through sunshine, in peace and in war, amid     the stress of poverty and the storms of civil strife, his soul     never faltered and his purpose never failed. To his poetic     mission he was faithful to the end. In life and in death he was     \"not disobedient unto the Heavenly vision.\"  On the panel facing the War Monument are three stanzas from his own beautiful Ode, sung at the decoration of Confederate graves in Magnolia Cemetery in 1867--such a little time before his passing that it seems to have mournful, though unconscious, allusion to his own early fall in the heat of earth's battle:      Sleep sweetly in your humble graves;       Sleep, martyrs of a fallen cause,     Though yet no marble column craves       The pilgrim here to pause.      In seeds of laurel in the earth       The blossom of your fame is blown,     And somewhere, waiting for its birth,       The shaft is in the stone.      Stoop, angels, hither from the skies!       There is no holier spot of ground     Than where defeated valor lies,       By mourning beauty crowned!  The shaft which the prophetic eye of Timrod saw \"in the stone\" was in time revealed, and years later that other shaft, awaiting the hour for doing homage to the poet, found the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16623"],["title","Letters of a Woman Homesteader (#0)"],["body","*       *       *       *       *           LETTERS      OF A WOMAN      HOMESTEADER       BY       _Elinore Pruitt Stewart_       [Illustration]        BOSTON AND NEW YORK      HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY      The Riverside Press Cambridge       1913 AND 1914, BY THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY CO.    1914, BY ELINORE PRUITT STEWART    ALL RIGHTS RESERVED    _Published May 1914_     PUBLISHERS' NOTE   The writer of the following letters is a young woman who lost her husband in a railroad accident and went to Denver to seek support for herself and her two-year-old daughter, Jerrine.

CONEY,--  Are you thinking I am lost, like the Babes in the Wood? Well, I am not and I'm sure the robins would have the time of their lives getting leaves to cover me out here. I am 'way up close to the Forest Reserve of Utah, within half a mile of the line, sixty miles from the railroad. I was twenty-four hours on the train and two days on the stage, and oh, those two days! The snow was just beginning to melt and the mud was about the worst I ever heard of.  The first stage we tackled was just about as rickety as it could very well be and I had to sit with the driver, who was a Mormon and so handsome that I was not a bit offended when he insisted on making love all the way, especially after he told me that he was a widower Mormon. But, of course, as I had no chaperone I looked very fierce (not that that was very difficult with the wind and mud as allies) and told him my actual opinion of Mormons in general and particular.  Meantime my new employer, Mr. Stewart, sat upon a stack of baggage and was dreadfully concerned about something he calls his \"Tookie,\" but I am unable to tell you what that is. The road, being so muddy, was full of ruts and the stage acted as if it had the hiccoughs and made us all talk as though we were affected in the same way. Once Mr. Stewart asked me if I did not think it a \"gey duir trip.\" I told him he could call it gay if he wanted to, but it didn't seem very hilarious to me. Every time the stage struck a rock or a rut Mr. Stewart would \"hoot,\" until I began to wish we would come to a hollow tree or a hole in the ground so he could go in with the rest of the owls.  At last we \"arriv,\" and everything is just lovely for me. I have a very, very comfortable situation and Mr. Stewart is absolutely no trouble, for as soon as he has his meals he retires to his room and plays on his bagpipe, only he calls it his \"bugpeep.\" It is \"The Campbells are Coming,\" without variations, at intervals all day long and from seven till eleven at night. Sometimes I wish they would make haste and get here.  There is a saddle horse especially for me and a little shotgun with which I am to kill sage chickens. We are between two trout streams, so you can think of me as being happy when the snow is through melting and the water gets clear. We have the finest flock of Plymouth Rocks and get so many nice eggs. It sure seems fine to have all the cream I want after my town experiences. Jerrine is making good use of all the good things we are having. She rides the pony to water every day.  I have not filed on my land yet because the snow is fifteen feet deep on it, and I think I would rather see what I am getting, so will wait until summer. They have just three seasons here, winter and July and August. We are to plant our garden the last of May. When it is so I can get around I will see about land and find out all I can and tell you.  I think this letter is about to reach thirty-secondly, so I will send you my sincerest love and quit tiring you. Please write me when you have time.    Sincerely yours,     ELINORE RUPERT.     II  FILING A CLAIM        _May 24, 1909._  DEAR, DEAR MRS. CONEY,--  Well, I have filed on my land and am now a bloated landowner. I waited a long time to even _see_ land in the reserve, and the snow is yet too deep, so I thought that as they have but three months of summer and spring together and as I wanted the land for a ranch anyway, perhaps I had better stay in the valley. So I have filed adjoining Mr. Stewart and I am well pleased. I have a grove of twelve swamp pines on my place, and I am going to build my house there. I thought it would be very romantic to live on the peaks amid the whispering pines, but I reckon it would be powerfully uncomfortable also, and I guess my twelve can whisper enough for me; and a dandy thing is, I have all the nice snow-water I want; a small stream runs right through the center of my land and I am quite near wood.  A neighbor and his daughter were going to Green River, the county-seat, and said I might go along, so I did, as I could file there as well as at the land office; and oh, that trip! I had more fun to the square inch than Mark Twain or Samantha Allen _ever_ provoked. It took us a whole week to go and come. We camped out, of course, for in the whole sixty miles there was but one house, and going in that direction there is not a tree to be seen, nothing but sage, sand, and sheep. About noon the first day out we came near a sheep-wagon, and stalking along ahead of us was a lanky fellow, a herder, going home for dinner. Suddenly it seemed to me I should starve if I had to wait until we got where we had planned to stop for dinner, so I called out to the man, \"Little Bo-Peep, have you anything to eat? If you have, we'd like to find it.\" And he answered, \"As soon as I am able it shall be on the table, if you'll but trouble to get behind it.\" Shades of Shakespeare! Songs of David, the Shepherd Poet! What do you think of us? Well, we got behind it, and a more delicious \"it\" I never tasted. Such coffee! And out of _such_ a pot! I promised Bo-Peep that I would send him a crook with pink ribbons on it, but I suspect he thinks I am a crook without the ribbons.  The sagebrush is so short in some places that it is not large enough to make a fire, so we had to drive until quite late before we camped that night. After driving all day over what seemed a level desert of sand, we came about sundown to a beautiful cañon, down which we had to drive for a couple of miles before we could cross. In the cañon the shadows had already fallen, but when we looked up we could see the last shafts of sunlight on the tops of the great bare buttes. Suddenly a great wolf started from somewhere and galloped along the edge of the cañon, outlined black and clear by the setting sun. His curiosity overcame him at last, so he sat down and waited to see what manner of beast we were. I reckon he was disappointed for he howled most dismally. I thought of Jack London's \"The Wolf.\"  After we quitted the cañon I saw the most beautiful sight. It seemed as if we were driving through a golden haze. The violet shadows were creeping up between the hills, while away back of us the snow-capped peaks were catching the sun's last rays. On every side of us stretched the poor, hopeless desert, the sage, grim and determined to live in spite of starvation, and the great, bare, desolate buttes. The beautiful colors turned to amber and rose, and then to the general tone, dull gray. Then we stopped to camp, and such a scurrying around to gather brush for the fire and to get supper! Everything tasted so good! Jerrine ate like a man. Then we raised the wagon tongue and spread the wagon sheet over it and made a bedroom for us women. We made our beds on the warm, soft sand and went to bed.  It was too beautiful a night to sleep, so I put my head out to look and to think. I saw the moon come up and hang for a while over the mountain as if it"]]]
