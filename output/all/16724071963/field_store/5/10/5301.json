The expression of his face was thoughtful, and the deep, heavily-ringed eyes were like Marzio's, but the forehead was broader, and the breadth ascended higher in the skull, which was clearly defined by the short, closely-cropped hair and the smooth tonsure at the back. The nose was larger and of more noble shape, and Paolo's complexion was less yellow than his brother's; the features were not surrounded by furrows or lines, and the leanness of the priest's face threw them into relief. The clean shaven upper lip showed a kind and quiet mouth, which smiled easily and betrayed a sense of humour, but was entirely free from any suggestion of cruelty. Don Paolo was scrupulous of his appearance, and his cassock and mantle were carefully brushed, and his white collar was immaculately clean. His hands were of the student type--white, square at the tips, lean, and somewhat knotty.  Marzio, in his ill-humour, had no doubt flattered himself that his family would wait for him for supper. But his family had studied him and knew his ways. When he was not punctual, he seldom came at all, and a quarter of an hour was considered sufficient to decide the matter.  \"What are we waiting to do?\" exclaimed Maria Luisa, in the odd Italian idiom. \"Marzio is in his humours--he must have gone to his friends. Ah! those friends of his!\" she sighed. \"Let us sit down to supper,\" she added; and, from her tone, the idea of supper seemed to console her for her husband's absence.  \"Perhaps he guessed that I was coming,\" remarked Don Paolo, with a smile. \"In that case he will be a little nervous with me when he comes back. With your leave, Maria Luisa,\" he added, by way of announcing that he would say grace. He gave the short Latin benediction, during which Gianbattista never looked away from Lucia's face. The boy fancied she was never so beautiful as when she stood with her hands folded and her eyes cast down.  \"Marzio does not know what I have come for,\" began Don Paolo again, as they all sat down to the square table in the little room. \"If he knew, perhaps he might have been here--though perhaps he would not care very much after all. You all ask what it is? Yes; I will tell you. His Eminence has obtained for me the canonry that was vacant at Santa Maria Maggiore--\"  At this announcement everybody sprang up and embraced Don Paolo, and overwhelmed him with congratulations, reproaching him at the same time for having kept the news so long to himself.  \"Of course, I shall continue to work with the Cardinal,\" said the priest, when the family gave him time to speak. \"But it is a great honour. I have other news for Marzio--\"  \"I imagine that you did not count upon the canonry as a means of pleasing him,\" remarked the Signora, Pandolfi, with a smile.  \"No, indeed,\" laughed Lucia. \"Poor papa--he would rather see you sent to be a curate in Cività Lavinia!\"  \"Dear me! I fear so,\" answered Don Paolo, with a shade of sadness. \"But I have a commission for him. The Cardinal has ordered another crucifix, which he desires should be Marzio's masterpiece--silver, of course, and large. It must be altogether the finest thing he has ever made, when it is finished.\"  \"I daresay he will be very much pleased,\" said Maria Luisa, smiling comfortably.  \"I wish he could make the figure solid, cast and chiselled, instead of _repoussé_,\" remarked Gianbattista, whose powerful hands craved heavy work by instinct.  \"It would be a pity to waste so much silver; and besides, the effects are never so light,\" said Lucia, who, like most artists' daughters, knew something of her father's work.  \"What is a little silver, more or less, to the Cardinal?\" asked Gianbattista, with a little scorn; but as he met the priest's eye his expression instantly became grave.  The apprentice was very young; he was not beyond that age at which, to certain natures, it seems a fine thing to be numbered among such men as Marzio's friends. But at the same time he was not old enough, nor independent enough, to exhibit his feelings on all occasions. Don Paolo exercised a dominant influence in the Pandolfi household. He had the advantage of being calm, grave, and thoroughly in earnest, not easily ruffled nor roused to anger, any more than he was easily hurt. By character sensitive, he bore all small attacks upon himself with the equanimity of a man who believes his cause to be above the need of defence against little enemies. The result was that he dominated his brother's family, and even Marzio himself was not free from a certain subjection which he felt, and which was one of the most bitter elements in his existence. Don Paolo imposed respect by his quiet dignity, while Marzio asserted himself by speaking loudly and working himself voluntarily into a state of half-assumed anger. In the contest between quiet force and noisy self-assertion the issue is never doubtful. Marzio lacked real power, and he felt it. He could command attention among the circle of his associates who already sympathised with his views, but in the presence of Paolo he was conscious of struggling against a superior and incomprehensible obstacle, against the cool and unresentful disapprobation of a man stronger than himself. It was many years since he had ventured to talk before his brother as he talked when he was alone with Gianbattista, and the latter saw the change that came over his master's manner before the priest, and guessed that Marzio was morally afraid. The somewhat scornful allusion to the Cardinal's supposed wealth certainly did not constitute an attack upon Don Paolo, but Gianbattista nevertheless felt that he had said something rather foolish, and made haste to ignore his words. The influence could not be escaped.  It was this subtle power that Marzio resented, for he saw that it was exerted continually, both upon himself and the members of his household. The chiseller acknowledged to himself that in a great emergency his wife, his daughter, and even Gianbattista Bordogni, would most likely follow the advice of Don Paolo, in spite of his own protests and arguments to the contrary. He fancied that he himself alone was a free agent. He doubted Gianbattista, and began to think that the boy's character would turn out a failure. This was the reason why he no longer encouraged the idea of a marriage between his daughter and his apprentice, a scheme which, somewhat earlier, had been freely discussed. It had seemed an admirable arrangement. The young man promised to turn out a freethinker after Marzio's own heart, and showed a talent for his profession which left nothing to be desired. Some one must be ready to take Marzio's place in the direction of the establishment, and no one could be better fitted to undertake the task than Gianbattista. Lucia would inherit her father's money as the capital for the business, and her husband should inherit the workshop with all the stock-in-trade. Latterly, however, Marzio had changed his mind, and the idea no longer seemed so satisfactory to him as at first. Gianbattista was evidently falling under the influence of Don Paolo, and that was a sufficient reason for breaking off the match. Marzio hardly realised that as far as his outward deportment in the presence of the priest was concerned, the apprentice was only following his master's example.  Marzio had been looking about him for another husband for his daughter, and he had actually selected one from among his most intimate friends. His choice had fallen upon the thin lawyer--by name Gasparo Carnesecchi--who, according to the chiseller's views, was in all respects a most excellent match. A true freethinker, a practising lawyer with a considerable acquaintance in the world of politics, a discreet man not far from forty years of age, it seemed as though nothing more were required to make a model husband. Marzio knew very well that Lucia's dowry would alone have sufficed to decide the lawyer to marry her, and an interview with Carnesecchi had almost decided the matter. Of course, he had not been able to allude to the affair this evening at the inn, when so many others were present, but the preliminaries were nearly settled, and Marzio had made up his mind to announce his intention to his family at once. He knew well enough what a storm he would raise, and, like many men who are always trying to seem stronger than they really are, he had determined to choose a moment for making the disclosure when he should be in a thoroughly bad humour. As he walked homewards from the old inn he felt that this moment had arrived. The slimy pavement, the moist wind driving through the streets and round every corner, penetrating to the very joints, contributed to make him feel thoroughly vicious and disagreeable; and the tirade in which he had been indulging before his audience of friends had loosed his tongue, until he was conscious of being able to face any domestic disturbance or opposition.  The little party had adjourned from supper, and had been sitting for some time in the small room which served as a place of meeting. Gianbattista was smoking a cigarette, which he judged to be more in keeping with his appearance than a pipe when he was dressed in civilised garments, and he was drawing an elaborate ornament of arabesques upon a broad sheet of paper fixed on a board. Lucia seated at the table was watching the work, while Don Paolo sat in a straight-backed chair, his white hands folded on his knee, from time to time addressing a remark to Maria Luisa. The latter, being too stout to recline in the deep easy-chair near the empty fireplace, sat bolt upright, with her feet upon the edge of a footstool, which was covered by a tapestry of worsted-work, displaying an impossible nosegay upon a vivid green ground.  They had discussed the priest's canonry, and the order for the crucifix. They had talked about the weather. They had made some remarks upon Marzio's probable disposition of mind when he should come home, and the conversation was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16720"],["title","Marzio's Crucifix, and Zoroaster (#6)"],["body","so far as the two older members were concerned. Gianbattista and Lucia conversed in a low tone, in short, enigmatic phrases.  \"Do you know?\" said the apprentice.  \"What?\" inquired Lucia.  \"I have spoken of it to-day.\" Both glanced at the Signora Pandolfi. She was sitting up as straight as ever, but her heavy head was slowly bending forward.  \"Well?\" asked the young girl  \"He was in a diabolical humour. He said I might take you away.\" Gianbattista smiled as he spoke, and looked into Lucia's eyes. She returned his gaze rather sadly, and only shook her head and shrugged her shoulders for a reply.  \"If we took him at his word,\" suggested Gianbattista.  \"Just so--it would be a fine affair!\" exclaimed Lucia ironically.  \"After all, he said so,\" argued the young man. \"What does it matter whether he meant it?\"  \"Things are going badly for us,\" sighed his companion. \"It was different a year ago. You must have done something to displease him, Tista. I wish I knew!\" Her dark eyes suddenly assumed an angry expression, and she drew in her red lips.  \"Wish you knew what?\" inquired the apprentice, in a colder tone.  \"Why he does not think about it as he used to. He never made any objections until lately. It was almost settled.\"  Gianbattista glanced significantly at Don Paolo, shrugged his shoulders, and went on drawing.  \"What has that to do with it?\" asked Lucia impatiently.  \"It is enough for your father that it would please his brother. He would hate a dog that Don Paolo liked.\"  \"What nonsense!\" exclaimed the girl. \"It is something else. Papa sees something--something that I do not see. He knows his own affairs, and perhaps he knows yours too, Tista. I have not forgotten the other evening.\"  \"I!\" ejaculated the young man, looking up angrily.  \"You know very well where I was--at the Circolo Artistico. How do you dare to think--\"  \"Why are you so angry if there is no one else in the case?\" asked Lucia, with a sudden sweetness, which belied the jealous glitter in her eyes.  \"It seems to me that I have a right to be angry. That you should suspect me after all these years! How many times have I sworn to you that I went nowhere else?\"  \"What is the use of your swearing? You do not believe in anything--why should you swear? Why should I believe you?\"  \"Oh--if you talk like that, I have finished!\" answered Gianbattista. \"But there--you are only teasing me. You believe me, just as I believe you. Besides, as for swearing and believing in something besides you--who knows? I love you--is not that enough?\"  Lucia's eyes softened as they rested on the young man's face. She knew he loved her. She only wanted to be told so once more.  \"There is Marzio,\" said Don Paolo, as a key rattled in the latch of the outer door.  \"At this hour!\" exclaimed the Signora Pandolfi, suddenly waking up and rubbing her eyes with her fat fingers.     CHAPTER III   Marzio, having divested himself of his heavy coat and hat, appeared at the door of the sitting-room.  Everybody looked at him, as though to discern the signs of his temper, and no one was perceptibly reassured by the sight of his white face and frowning forehead.  \"Well, most reverend canon,\" he began, addressing Don Paolo, \"I am in time to congratulate you, it seems. It was natural that I should be the last to hear of your advancement, through the papers.\"  \"Thank you,\" answered Don Paolo quietly. \"I came to tell you the news.\"  \"You are very considerate,\" returned Marzio. \"I have news also; for you all.\" He paused a moment, as though to give greater effect to the statement he was about to make. \"I refer,\" he continued very slowly, \"to the question of Lucia's marriage.\"  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed the priest. \"I am glad if it is to be arranged at last.\"  The other persons in the room held their breath. The young girl blushed deeply under her white skin, and Gianbattista grew pale as he laid aside his pencil and shaded his eyes with his hands. The Signora Pandolfi panted with excitement and trembled visibly as she looked at her husband. His dark figure stood out strongly from the background of the shabby blue wall paper, and the petroleum lamp cast deep shadows in the hollows of his face.  \"Yes,\" he continued, \"I talked yesterday with Gasparo Carnesecchi--you know, he is the lawyer I always consult. He is a clever fellow and understands these matters. We talked of the contract; I thought it better to consult him, you see, and he thinks the affair can be arranged in a couple of weeks. He is so intelligent. A marvel of astuteness; we discussed the whole matter, I say, and it is to be concluded as soon as possible. So now, my children--\"  Gianbattista and Lucia, seated side by side at the table, were looking into each other's eyes, and as Marzio fixed his gaze upon them, their hands joined upon the drawing-board, and an expression of happy surprise overspread their faces. Marzio smiled too, as he paused before completing the sentence.  \"So that now, my children,\" he continued, speaking very slowly, \"you may as well leave each other's hands and have done with all this nonsense.\"  The lovers looked up suddenly with a puzzled air, supposing that Marzio was jesting.  \"I am in earnest,\" he went on. \"You see, Tista, that it will not be proper for you to sit and hold Lucia's hand when she is called Signora Carnesecchi, so you may as well get used to it.\"  For a moment there was a dead silence in the room. Then Lucia and Gianbattista both sprang to their feet.  \"What!\" screamed the young girl in an agony of terror. \"Carnesecchi! what do you mean?\"  \"_Infame!_ Wretch!\" shouted Gianbattista, beside himself with rage as he sprang forward to grasp Marzio in his hands.  But the priest had risen too, and placed himself between the young man and Marzio to prevent any struggle. \"No violence!\" he cried in a tone that dominated the angry voices and the hysterical weeping of Maria Luisa, who sat rocking herself in her chair. Gianbattista stepped back and leaned against the wall, choking with anger. Lucia fell back into her seat and covered her face with her hands.  \"Violence? Who wants violence?\" asked Marzio in contemptuous tones. \"Do you suppose I am afraid of Tista? Let him alone, Paolo; let us see whether he will strike me.\"  The priest now turned his back on the apprentice, and confronted Marzio. He was not pale like the rest, for he was not afraid of the chiseller, and the generous flush of a righteous indignation mounted to his calm face.  \"You are mad,\" he said, meeting his brother's gaze fearlessly.  \"Not in the least,\" returned Marzio. \"Lucia shall marry Gasparo Carnesecchi at once, or she shall not marry any one; what am I saying? She shall have no choice. She must and she shall marry the man I have chosen. What have you to do with it? Have you come here to put yourself between me and my family? I advise you to be careful. The law protects me from such interference, and fellows of your cloth are not very popular at present.\"  \"The law,\" answered the priest, controlling his wrath, \"protects children against their parents. The law which you invoke provides that a father shall not force his daughter to marry against her will, and I believe that considerable penalties are incurred in such cases.\"  \"What do you know of law, except how to elude it?\" inquired Marzio defiantly.  Not half an hour had elapsed since he had been haranguing the admiring company of his friends, and his words came easily. Moreover, it was a long time since he had broken through the constraint he felt in Don Paolo's presence, and the opportunity having presented itself was not to be lost.  \"Who are you that should teach me?\" he repeated, raising his voice to a strained key and gesticulating fiercely. \"You, your very existence is a lie, and you are the server of lies, and you and your fellow liars would have created them if they didn't already exist, you love them so. You live by a fraud, and you want to drag everybody into the comedy you play every day in your churches, everybody who is fool enough to drop a coin into your greedy palm! What right have you to talk to men? Do you work? Do you buy? Do you sell? You are worse than those fine gentlemen who do nothing because their fathers stole our money, for you live by stealing it yourselves! And you set yourselves up as judges over an honest man to tell him what he is to do with his daughter? You fool, you thing in petticoats, you deceiver of women, you charlatan, you mountebank, go! Go and perform your antics before your altars, and leave hardworking men like me to manage their families as they can, and to marry their daughters to whom they will!\"  Marzio had rolled off his string of invective in such a tone, and so rapidly, that it had been impossible to interrupt him. The two women were sobbing bitterly. Gianbattista, pale and breathing hard, looked as though he would throttle Marzio if he could reach him, and Don Paolo faced the angry artist, with reddening forehead, folding his arms and straining his muscles to control himself. When Marzio paused for breath, the priest answered him with an effort.  \"You may insult me if it pleases you,\" he said, \"it is nothing to me. I cannot prevent your uttering your senseless blasphemies. I speak to you of the matter in hand. I tell you simply that in treating these two, who love each other, as you are treating them, you are doing a thing unworthy of a man. Moreover, the law protects your daughter, and I will see that the law does its duty.\"  \"Oh, to think that I should have such a monster for a husband,\" groaned the fat Signora Pandolfi, still rocking herself in her chair, and hardly able to speak through her sobs.  \"You will do a bad day's work for yourself and your art when you try to separate us,\" said Gianbattista between his teeth.  Marzio laughed hoarsely, and turned his back on the rest, beginning to fill his pipe at the chimney-piece. Don Paolo heard the apprentice's words, and understood their meaning. He went and laid his hand on the"]]]
