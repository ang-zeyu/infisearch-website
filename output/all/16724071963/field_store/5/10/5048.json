But the sun was low in the west, and its slanting rays brought to light the figure of no child hurrying homeward. The single object that was mistaken for the loved one proved to be a man on horseback, who turned off at the forks and vanished.  \"Nick, go look for your sister,\" said his mother, as she came back from one of these visits to the gate; \"something has happened.\"  The boy was glad of the order, for he was on the point of asking permission to hunt for Nellie.  \"I'll stay till I find out something,\" said Nick, as he donned his hat and took a general look over himself to see that he was in shape, \"so don't worry about _me_.\"  \"But you ought not to be gone so long,\" said the father, whose anxious face showed that he was debating whether he should not join his boy in the search, \"for it won't take long to find out where Nellie is.\"  \"I think she has been taken sick and has stopped with some of the neighbors,\" ventured the mother, \"but it is strange they do not send me word.\"  And it was the very fact that such word was not sent that prevented the husband and son from believing in the theory of the distressed mother.  But Nick did not let the grass grow under his feet. His worriment was as great as that of his parents, and as soon as he was in the road he broke into a trot, which he kept up until beyond sight, both father and mother standing at the gate and watching him until he faded from view in the gathering twilight.  The point where he disappeared was beyond the house of Mr. Marston, so it was safe to conclude he had learned nothing of his sister there, where he was seen to halt.  There is nothing more wearisome than waiting in such suspense as came to the hearts of the father and mother, while they sat watching and listening for the sound of the childish footsteps and voices whose music would have been the sweetest on earth to them.  The supper on the table remained untasted, and the only sounds heard were the solemn ticking of the old clock, the soft rustling of the kettle on the stove, and now and then a long drawn sigh from father or mother, as one strove to utter a comforting word to the other.  All at once the gate was opened and shut hastily. Then a hurried step sounded along the short walk and upon the porch.  \"There they are! there they are!\" exclaimed the mother, starting to her feet, as did the father.  Almost on the same instant the door was thrown open, and, panting and excited, Nick Ribsam entered.  But he was alone, and the expression of his face showed that he had brought bad news.     CHAPTER V.  THE PARTY OF SEARCH.   When Nick Ribsam set out to find his missing sister Nellie, he made the search as thorough as possible.  The first house at which he stopped was that of Mr. Marston, which, it will be remembered, was only a short distance away from his own home. There, to his disappointment, he learned that their little girl had not been at school that day, and consequently they could tell him nothing.  Without waiting longer than to give a few words of explanation he resumed his trot, and soon after turned into the lane leading to the home of Mr. Kilgore. He found that both Bobby and Sallie had been to school, but they had nothing to tell. When we are more than usually anxious to learn something, it seems that every one whom we meet is stupid beyond endurance. If we are in a strange place and apply for information, the ignorance of nearly every person is exasperating.  Bobby and Sallie remembered seeing Nellie in school during the forenoon and afternoon, but, while the boy insisted that she came along the road with them after dismissal, Sallie was just as positive that the missing girl was not with them.  The party of school children which usually went over the highway was so small in number that it is hard to understand how such a mistake could be made, but the difference between Bobby and Sallie was irreconcilable.  \"I _know_ she didn't come home with us,\" said Sallie, stamping her foot to give emphasis to the words.  \"And I _know_ she did,\" declared Bobby, equally emphatically, \"for me and her played tag.\"  \"Why don't you say she and I played tag?\" asked Nick, impatient with both the children.  \"'Cause it was me and her,\" insisted Bobby.  \"What a dunce-head!\" exclaimed his sister; \"that was _last_ night when you played tag, and you tumbled over into the ditch and bellered like the big baby you are.\"  \"I remember that he did that last night,\" said Nick, hoping to help the two to settle the dispute.  \"I know I done that last night, but this afternoon I done it too. I fall into the ditch every night and beller; I do it on purpose to fool them that are chasing me.\"  Nick found he could gain nothing; but he believed the sister was right and the brother wrong, as afterward proved to be the case.  There were no more houses between his own home and the school building, and Nick resumed his dog trot, never halting until he came in front of a little whitewashed cottage just beyond the stone school-house.  The latter stood at the cross roads, and the cottage to the left was where the teacher, Mr. Layton, an old bachelor, lived with his two maiden sisters.  Mr. Layton, although strict to severity in the school-room, was a kind-hearted man and was fond of the Ribsam children, for they were bright, cheerful, and obedient, and never gave him any trouble, as did some of his other pupils. He listened to Nick's story, and his sympathy was aroused at once.  \"I am very sorry,\" said he, \"that your good father and mother, not to mention yourself, should be so sorely troubled; but I hope this is not serious. Nellie came to me about three o'clock and asked whether I would let her go home.\"  \"Was she sick?\" asked the distressed brother.  \"Not at all; but she said you had gone to Dunbarton in your carriage and she wanted to meet you coming back. She knew her lessons perfectly, and Nellie is such a good girl that I felt that I could not refuse so simple a request. So I told her she could go. I saw her start homeward with her lunch-basket in one hand and her two school-books in the other. She stepped off so briskly and was in such cheerful spirits that I stood at the window and watched her until she passed around the bend in the road.\"  Nick felt his heart sink within him, for the words of the teacher had let in a great deal of alarming truth upon him.  Nellie had reached the forks two hours ahead of him, and then, not wishing to sit down and wait, she had started up the road in the direction of Dunbarton to meet him. She must have entered the eight mile stretch of woods from the south about the same time Nick himself drove into it on his return from Dunbarton.  The two should have met near Shark Creek, but neither had seen the other. Nick, as a matter of course, had kept to the road, but what had become of Nellie?  This was the question the lad put to himself, and which caused him to feel so faint that he sank down in a chair unable to speak for a minute or two. Then, when he tried to do so, he had to stop, and was kept busy swallowing the lump that would rise in his throat, until finally the tears suddenly appeared, and, putting his hands to his eyes, he gave way to his grief.  \"There, there,\" said Mr. Layton soothingly, \"don't cry, Nick, for it will do no good. Nellie has strayed off in the woods to gather flowers or perhaps wild grapes and has missed her way.\"  \"She--is--lost--poor--Nellie!\" said the lad as best he could between his sobs; \"we'll never see her again.\"  \"Oh, it isn't as bad as that! I suppose she has grown weary, and, sitting down to rest, has fallen asleep.\"  If the good teacher meant this to soothe the lad, it had the contrary effect, for the picture of his little sister wandering alone in the woods was one of the most dreadful that could be imagined, and it took all the manhood of his nature to keep from breaking down again.  While the interview was under way, Mr. Layton was busy changing his slippers for his boots, his wrapper for his coat, and his hat was donned just as he spoke the last words.  His sympathy did not expend itself in talk, but the instant he saw what the trouble was he was eager to do all he could to help his suffering friends. He even reproached himself for having given Nellie permission to meet her brother, though no matter what harm may have befallen her, no one could blame her instructor therefor.  \"We must hunt for her,\" said Mr. Layton, when he was ready to go out; \"I will tell my sisters they need not be alarmed over my absence, and I guess I will take the lantern with me.\"  Nick passed out to the front gate, where he waited a minute for the teacher, until he should speak with his friends and get the lantern ready. When he came forth, the boy felt much like the patient who sees the surgeon take out his instruments and try their edge to make sure they are in condition before using upon him.  The sight of the lantern in the hand of Mr. Layton gave such emphasis to the danger that it caused another quick throb of Nick's heart, but he forced it down as the two started back over the road, toward the school-house.  \"There is no need of lighting the lantern until we get to the woods,\" said the teacher, \"for we don't need it, and I hope we won't need it after we reach the forest. Poor Nellie! she will feel dreadfully frightened, when she wakes up in the dark forest.\"  He regretted the words, for the two or three sobs that escaped the brother, before he could master himself, showed that his heart"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16472"],["title","Through Forest and Fire (#4)"],["body","swelled nigh to bursting.  The night was mild and pleasant, although a little too chilly for any one to sleep out of doors. The moon was gibbous, and only a few white, feathery clouds now and then drifted across its face. Where there was no shadow, one could see for a hundred yards or so with considerable distinctness--that is, enough to recognize the figure of a man in motion.  Opposite the lane leading to the house of Mr. Kilgore, the teacher stopped.  \"I will go in and get him to join us,\" said Mr. Layton; \"and you had better hurry home for your father. On your way back, stop for Mr. Marston; that will give us a pretty large party. If when you reach the forks you do not find us there, don't wait, but hurry on toward Dunbarton; you will meet us before you reach the bridge over Shark Creek.\"  Nick did as told, and, still on a rapid trot, reached home panting and excited, with the story which the reader has just learned.  Mr. Ribsam threw down his pipe, donned his hat and coat, and started out the door. With his hand on the latch, he paused, and, looking back, commanded his voice so as to say:  \"Katrina, you and Nick needn't wait up for me.\"  \"Oh, father,\" pleaded the lad, moving toward him: \"would you make me stay at home when Nellie is lost?\"  \"No, no--I did not think,\" answered the parent, in a confused way; \"I feel so bad I do not know what I do and say. Katrina, don't feel too bad; we will come back as soon as we can.\"  Again the half distracted father placed his hand on the latch, and he had drawn the door partly open, when his wife, pale and trembling, called out in a voice of touching pathos:  \"Gustav, my heart would break should I try to stay here, when no one but God knows where my darling Nellie is; but, wherever she may be, no sorrow or pain or suffering can come to her that her mother will not share, and may our Heavenly Father let her mother take it all upon her own shoulders!\"  \"Come on, Katrina; come on and bring the lantern with you.\"     CHAPTER VI.  GROPING IN DARKNESS.   When the parents and brother of Nellie Ribsam reached the forks a few minutes later, they saw nothing of the three parties whom they expected to meet there.  \"They have gone on to the woods to look for Nellie,\" said the father.  \"They cannot be far off,\" suggested Nick, turning to the left.  All were too anxious to lose a minute, and they started after their friends on a rapid walk, Nick taking the lead, and now and then dropping into a loping trot, which he would have increased had he been alone.  A chill seemed to settle over all as they reached the deep shadow of the woods, which was one of the largest tracts of forest in that section of the country.  The road which bisected them was fully eight miles in length, as has already been stated, while the forest was much greater in extent in the other direction.  Being of such large area, there were necessarily many portions which rarely if ever were visited by hunters. Years before an occasional deer had been shot, and a few of the old settlers told of the thrilling bear hunts they had enjoyed when they were not so very much younger than now.  Those who were capable of judging were certain that if the gloomy depths were explored these dreaded animals would be met; but if such were the fact, the beasts were so few in number that no one gave them a thought.  It was now four miles to Shark Creek, and, by common consent, it was agreed that the missing Nellie must be found, if found at all, before reaching the stream.  As this creek was deep enough to drown any person who could not swim, not to mention the large pond into which it emptied, every one of the searchers felt a vague, awful dread that poor Nellie had fallen into the water.  No one spoke of it, but the thought was there all the same.  Shortly after entering the wood, Nick called attention to two star-like points of light twinkling ahead of them.  \"They are the lanterns of Mr. Layton and Kilgore,\" said Nick, who immediately added, \"we forgot to stop and get Mr. Marston.\"  \"That is too bad, but it isn't worth while to go back now,\" replied his father, hardly slackening his gait.  As the lantern which Mrs. Ribsam had handed to her husband was lighted before leaving home, the men in advance detected it immediately after they were seen themselves, and the halloo of the teacher was answered by Nick.  \"Have you found anything of Nellie?\" asked the mother, in broken English, as soon as the parties came together.  \"It could scarcely be expected,\" answered the instructor, in a kindly voice; \"we have just got here, and have only looked along the road. I have little doubt that she is soundly sleeping somewhere not far off.\"  While all stood still, the father lifted up his voice, and in clear, penetrating tones called the name of his missing child:  \"Nellie!\"  The ticking of the big watch in the pocket of Nick was plainly heard as the little company awaited the answering call of the child.  But it came not, and three times more was the name of the missing girl repeated by the father, who broke down completely the last time.  Nick now joined his thumb and finger against the end of his tongue, and emitted a blast like that of a steam whistle. It resounded among the trees, and then followed the same oppressive stillness as before.  It was useless to remain where they were any longer, and, without a word, the five moved on. The three lamps were swung above their heads, and they peered into the gloomy depths on the right and left.  Nick, as might have been expected, kept the advance, and his father allowed him to carry the lantern. As the other lights were behind the lad, the latter saw his huge shadow continually dancing in front and taking all manner of grotesque shapes, while, if the others had looked to the rear, they would have seen the same spectacle, as it affected their own figures.  \"Wait!\" suddenly called out the father, who was now obliged to use his broken English, \"mebbe my Nellie she does hears me.\"  Thereupon he called to her as before, Nick ending the appeal with an ear-splitting whistle, which must have been heard several miles on such a still night.  Not the slightest result followed, and with heavy hearts the little company moved on again.  \"I think,\" said Mr. Layton, \"that she has turned aside, where, possibly, some faint path has caught her eye, and it may be that we may discover the spot.\"  \"Let's look here!\"  It was the mother who spoke this time, and, as they turned toward her, she was seen bending over the ground at the side of the highway, where something had arrested her attention.  Instantly all the lanterns were clustered about the spot, and it was seen that the eyes of affection had detected just such a place as that named by the teacher. Persons who walked along the road were accustomed to turn aside into the woods, and the five now did the same, moving slowly, with the lanterns held close to the earth, and then swung aloft, while all eyes were peering into the portions penetrated by the yellow rays.  The path was followed some fifty yards, when, to the disappointment of all, it came back to the road: it was one of those whimsical footways often met in the country, the person who started it having left the highway without any real reason for doing so.  Again the name of the missing Nellie was repeated, and again the woods sent back nothing but the echo.  \"Hark!\"  It was the quick-eared Nick who spoke, just as the hum of conversation began, and all listened.  As they did so the rattle of wheels was heard coming from the direction of Dunbarton. The peculiar noise enabled the friends to recognize it as made by a heavy, lumbering farmer's wagon. The team was proceeding on a walk.  A few minutes later some one shouted:  \"Halloo, there! what's the matter?\"  The voice was recognized as that of Mr. Marston, whom they intended to ask to join them.  Instantly a hope was aroused that he might be able to tell them something of Nellie. Mr. Layton called back, saying they were friends, and asking whether the farmer had seen anything of Nellie Ribsam.  At this Mr. Marston whipped up his horses, which were showing some fear of the twinkling lanterns, and halted when opposite to the party of searchers.  \"My gracious! is she lost?\" asked the good man, forgetting the anguish of his friends in his own curiosity.  \"Yes, she started up this road this afternoon toward Dunbarton to meet her brother, who was returning, but, somehow or other, missed him, and we are all anxious about her.\"  \"My gracious alive! I should think you would be: it would drive my wife and me crazy if our Lizzie should be lost in the woods.\"  \"I suppose, from the way you talk,\" continued the teacher, \"that you have seen nothing of her?\"  \"No, I wish I had, for I tell you these woods are a bad place for a little girl to get lost in. Last March, when we had an inch of snow on the ground, I seen tracks that I knowed was made by a bear, and a mighty big one, too, and--\"  But just then a half-smothered moan from the mother warned the thoughtless neighbor that he was giving anything but comfort to the afflicted parents.  \"I beg pardon,\" he hastened to say, in an awkward attempt to apologize; \"come to think, I am sure that it wasn't a bear, but some big dog; you know a large dog makes tracks which can be mistook very easy for those of a bear. I'll hurry on home and put up my team and git the lantern and come back and help you.\"  And Mr. Marston, who meant well, whipped up his horses, and his wagon rattled down the road as he hastened homeward.     CHAPTER VII.  AN ALARMING DISCOVERY.   By this time the searching party began to realize the difficulties in the path of their success.  If, as was believed, or rather hoped, Nellie had fallen asleep in the woods, they were liable to pass within a dozen feet of where she lay without discovering the fact. Should they call to her, or should Nick emit his resounding signal whistle, she might be awakened, provided only"]]]
