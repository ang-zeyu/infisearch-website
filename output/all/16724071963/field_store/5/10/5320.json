(11)   The subject of Elocution, so far as it is deemed applicable to a work of this kind, will be considered under the following heads, viz:   1. ARTICULATION.           4. READING VERSE. 2. INFLECTION.             5. THE VOICE. 3. ACCENT AND EMPHASIS.    6. GESTURE.    I. ARTICULATION. (11)  Articulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and of their combinations.  As words consist of one or more elementary sounds, the first object of the student should he to acquire the power of uttering those sounds with distinctness, smoothness, and force. This result can be secured only by careful practice, which must be persevered in until the learner has acquired a perfect control of his organs of speech.    ELEMENTARY SOUNDS. (12)  An Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of speech.  The Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals, Subvocals, and Aspirates.    VOCALS. (12)  Vocals are sounds which consist of pure tone only. They are the most prominent elements of all words, and it is proper that they should first receive attention. A vocal may be represented by one letter, as in the word hat, or by two or more letters, as in heat, beauty. A diphthong is a union of two vocals, commencing with one and ending with the other. It is usually represented by two letters, as in the words oil, boy, out, now.  Each of these can he uttered with great force, so as to give a distinct expression of its sound, although the voice be suddenly suspended, the moment the sound is produced. This is done by putting the lips, teeth, tongue, and palate in their proper position, and then expelling each sound from the throat in the same manner that the syllable \"ah!\" is uttered in endeavoring to deter a child from something it is about to do; thus, a'--a'--a'--.  Let the pupil he required to utter every one of the elements in the Table with all possible suddenness and percussive force, until he is able to do it with ease and accuracy. This must not he considered as accomplished until he can give each sound with entire clearness, and with all the suddenness of the crack of a rifle. Care must be taken that the vocal alone be heard; there must be no consonantal sound, and no vocal sound other than the one intended.  At first, the elementary sounds may be repeated by the class in concert; then separately.    TABLE OF VOCALS. (13)  Long Sounds.  Sound   as in  a       hate e       err a       hare i       pine a       pass o       no a       far oo      cool a       fall u       tube e       eve u       burn   Short Sounds.  Sound   as in  a       mat o       hot e       met oo      book i       it u       us   Diphthongs. oi, oy, as in oil, boy. ou, ow, as in out, now.   REMARK I.--In this table, the short sounds are nearly or quite the same, in quantity, as the long sounds. The difference consists chiefly in quality. Let the pupil determine this fact by experiment.  REMARK II.--The vocals are often represented by other letters or combinations of letters than those used in the table: for instance, a is represented by ai as in hail, by ea as in steak, etc.  REMARK III.--As  a general rule, the long vocals and the diphthongs should be articulated with full, clear utterance; but the short vocals have a sharp, distinct, and almost explosive utterance. Weakness of speech follows a failure to observe the first point, while drawling results from carelessness with respect to the second.    SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES (13)  Subvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less obstructed.  Aspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.  Words ending with subvocal sounds may be selected for practice on the subvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds may be used for practice on aspirates. Pronounce these words forcibly and distinctly, several times in succession; then drop the other sounds, and repeat the subvocals and aspirates alone. Let the class repeat the words and elements, at first, in concert; then separately.    TABLE OF SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES. (14)  Subvocals. as in  b          babe d          bad g          nag j          judge v          move th         with z          buzz z          azure (azh-) w          wine  Aspirates. as in  p          rap t          at k          book ch         rich f          life th         smith s          hiss sh         rush wh         what   REMARK.--These eighteen sounds make nine pairs of cognates. In articulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position required in the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the breath is expelled with some force, without the utterance of any vocal sound. The pupil should first verify this by experiment, and then practice on these cognates.  The following subvocals and aspirate have no cognates:  SUBVOCAL  as in  l         mill ng        sing m         rim r         rule n         run y         yet    ASPIRATE.  h, as in hat.    SUBSTITUTES. (14)  Substitutes are characters used to represent sounds ordinarily represented by other characters.  TABLE OF SUBSTITUTES. Sub  for  as in  a    o    what y    i    hymn e    a    there c    s    cite e    a    freight c    k    cap i    e    police ch   sh   machine i    e    sir ch   k    chord o    u    son g    j    cage o    oo   to n    ng   rink o    oo   would s    z    rose o    a    corn s    sh   sugar o    u    worm x    gz   examine u    oo   pull gh   f    laugh u    oo   rude ph   f    sylph y    i    my qu   k    pique qu   kw   quick    FAULTS TO BE REMEDIED. (15)  The most common faults of articulation are dropping an unaccented vowel, sounding incorrectly an unaccented vowel, suppressing final consonants, omitting or mispronouncing syllables, and blending words.   1. Dropping an unaccented vocal.  EXAMPLES.  CORRECT         INCORRECT  gran'a-ry       gran'ry a-ban'don       a-ban-d'n im-mor'tal      im-mor-t'l reg'u-lar       reg'lar in-clem'ent     in-clem'nt par-tic'u-lar   par-tic'lar des'ti-ny       des-t'ny cal-cu-la'tian  cal-cl'a-sh'n un-cer'tain     un-cer-t'n oc-ca'sion      oc-ca-sh'n em'i-nent       em'nent ef'i-gy         ef'gy ag'o-ny         ag'ny man'i-fold      man'fold rev'er-ent      rev'rent cul'ti-vate     cult'vate   2. Sounding incorrectly an unaccented vowel.  EXAMPLES.  CORRECT          INCORRECT  lam-en-ta'-tion  lam-un-ta-tion ter'ri-ble       ter-rub-ble e-ter'nal        e-ter-nul fel'on-y         fel-er-ny ob'sti-nate      ob-stun-it fel'low-ship     fel-ler-ship e-vent'          uv-ent cal'cu-late      cal-ker-late ef'fort          uf-fort reg'u-lar        reg-gy-lur   EXERCISES. (16)  The vocals most likely to be dropped or incorrectly  sounded are italicized.    He attended divine service regularly.   This is my particular request.   She is universally esteemed.   George is sensible of his fault.   This calculation is incorrect.   What a terrible calamity.   His eye through vast immensity can pierce.  Observe these nice dependencies.   He is a formidable adversary.   He is generous to his friends.   A tempest desolated the land.   He preferred death to servitude.   God is the author of all things visible and invisible.   3. Suppressing the final subvocals or aspirates.  EXAMPLE (16)    John an' James are frien's o' my father.   Gi' me some bread.   The want o' men is occasioned by the want o' money.   We seldom fine' men o' principle to ac' thus.   Beas' an' creepin' things were foun' there.   EXERCISES. (17)    He learned to write.   The masts of the ship were cast down.   He entered the lists at the head of his troops.   He is the merriest fellow in existence.   I regard not the world's opinion.   He has three assistants.

His attempts were fruitless.   He chanced to see a bee hovering over a flower.   4. Omitting or mispronouncing whole syllables.  EXAMPLES.  Correct             is improperly pronounced  Lit'er-ar-ry         lit-rer-ry co-tem'po-ra-ry      co-tem-po-ry het-er-o-ge'ne-ous   het-ro-ge-nous in-quis-i-to'ri-al   in-quis-i-to-ral mis'er-a-ble         mis-rer-ble ac-com'pa-ni-ment    ac-comp-ner-ment   EXERCISE    He devoted his attention chiefly to literary pursuits.   He is a miserable creature.   His faults were owing to the degeneracy of the times.   The manuscript was undecipherable.   His spirit was unconquerable.   Great industry was necessary for the performance of the task.   5. Blending the end of one word with the beginning of the next.  EXAMPLES    I court thy gif sno more.   The grove swere God sfir stemples.   My hear twas a mirror, that show' devery treasure.   It reflecte deach beautiful blosso mof pleasure.   Han d'me the slate.   This worl dis all a fleeting show,   For man' sillusion given.   EXERCISES. (18)    The magistrates ought to arrest the rogues speedily.   The whirlwinds sweep the plain.   Linked to thy side, through every chance I go.   But had he seen an actor in our days enacting Shakespeare.   What awful sounds assail my ears?   We caught a glimpse of her.   Old age has on their temples shed her silver frost.   Our eagle shall rise mid the whirlwinds of war,   And dart through the dun cloud of battle his eye.   Then honor shall weave of the laurel a crown,   That beauty shall bind on the brow of the brave.    II. INFLECTION. (18)  Inflection is a bending or sliding of the voice either upward or downward.  The upward or rising inflection is an upward slide of the voice, and is marked by the acute accent, thus, ('); as,     Did you call'? Is he sick'?  The downward or falling inflection is a downward slide of the voice, and is marked by the grave accent, thus, ('); as,     Where is London'? Where have you been'?  Sometimes both the rising and falling inflections are given to the same sound. Such sounds are designated by the circumflex, thus, (v) or thus, (^). The former is called the rising circumflex; the latter, the falling circumflex; as,    But nobody can bear the death of Clodius.  When several successive syllables are uttered without either the upward or downward slide, they are said to be uttered in a monotone, which is marked thus, (--); as,    Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll  EXAMPLES. (19)    Does he read correctly' or incorrectly'?  In reading this sentence, the voice should slide somewhat as represented in the following diagram:    Does he read cor-rectly or incorrect-ly?     If you said vinegar, I said sugar,  To be read thus:    If you said vinegar, I said sugar,     If you said yes, I said no.  To be read thus:    If you said yes, I said no.     What! did he say no?  To be read thus:    What! did he say no?     He did'; he said no',  To be read thus;    He did; he said no.     Did he do it voluntarily', or involuntarily'?  To be read thus:    Did he do it voluntarily, or involuntarily?     He did it voluntarily', not involuntarily',  To be read thus:    He did it voluntarily, not involuntarily.    EXERCISES. (20)  Do they act prudently', or imprudently'?  Are they at home', or abroad'?  Did you say Europe', or Asia'?  Is he rich', or poor'?  He said pain', not pain'.  Are you engaged', or at leisure'?  Shall I say plain', or pain'?  He went home' not abroad'.  Does he say able', or table'?  He said hazy' not lazy'?  Must I say flat', or flat'?  You should say flat' not flat'.  My father', must I stay'?  Oh! but he paused upon the brink.  It shall go hard with me, but I shall use the weapon.  Heard ye those loud contending waves,   That shook Cecropia's pillar'd state'? Saw ye the mighty from their graves   Look up', and tremble at your fate'?  First' Fear', his hand, its skill to try',   Amid the chords bewildered laid'; And back recoiled', he knew not why'   E'en at the sound himself had made'.   Where be your gibes' now? your gambols'? your songs'? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar'?  Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; \"I dwell in the high and holy place.\"    FALLING INFLECTION. (21)  RULE I.--Sentences, and parts of sentences which make complete sense in themselves, require the falling inflection.   EXAMPLES. (21)  1. By virtue we secure happiness'.  2. For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven': I will exalt my throne above the stars of God':  I will sit, also, upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north'.  3. The wind and the rain are over'; calm is the noon of the day\\: the clouds are divided in heaven'; over the green hills flies the inconstant sun'; red through the stormy vale comes down the stream'.  4. This proposition was, however, rejected,' and not merely rejected, but rejected with insult'.  Exception.--Emphasis sometimes reverses this rule, and requires the rising inflection, apparently for the purpose of calling attention to the idea of an unusual manner of expressing it.  EXAMPLES. (21)  1. I should not like to ride in that car'. 2. Look out! A man was drowned there yesterday'. 3. Presumptuous man! the gods' take care of Cato',   RULE II.--The language of emphasis generally requires the falling inflection.  EXAMPLES. (22)  1. Charge', Chester, charge'; on', Stanley, on'.  2. Were I an American, as I am an Englishman, while a single' foreign troop' remained' in my country, I would never' lay down my arms'--never', never', never.'  3. Does anyone suppose that the payment of twenty shillings, would have ruined Mr. Hampden's fortune? No'. But the payment of half twenty shillings, on the principle' it was demanded, would have made him a slave'.  4. I insist' upon this point': I urge' you to it; I press' it, demand' it.  5. All that I have', all that I am', and all that I hope' in this life, I am now ready', here, to stake' upon it.   RULE III.--Interrogative sentences and members of sentences, which can not be answered by yes or no, generally require the falling inflection.  EXAMPLE. (22)  1. How many books did he purchase'?  2. Why reason ye these things in your hearts'?  3. What see' you, that you frown so heavily to-day'?  4. Ah! what is that flame which now bursts on his eye'?  5. Whence this pleasing hope', this fond desire',    This longing after immortality'?   Exception.--When questions usually requiring  the falling inflection are emphatic or repeated, they take the rising inflection.   EXAMPLES. (22)  1. Where did you say he had gone'?  2. To whom did you say the blame was to be imputed'?  3. What is' he? A knave. What' is he? A knave, I say.   RISING INFLECTION. (23)  RULE IV.--The rising inflection is generally used where the sense is dependent or incomplete.  REMARK.--This inflection is generally very slight, requiring an acute and educated ear to discern it, and it is difficult to teach pupils to distinguish it, though they constantly use it. Care should be taken not to exaggerate it.  EXAMPLES. (23)  1. Nature being exhausted', he quietly resigned himself to his fate.  2. A chieftain to the Highlands bound',    Cries', \"Boatman, do not tarry!\"  3. As he spoke without fear of consequences', so his actions were marked with the most unbending resolution,  4. Speaking in the open air', at the top of the voice', is an admirable exercise.  5. If then, his Providence' out of our evil, seek to bring forth good', our labor must be to prevent that end.  6. He', born for the universe', narrowed his mind,    And to party gave up what was meant for mankind.   REMARK.--The names of persons or things addressed, when not used emphatically, are included in this rule.  7. Brother', give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick!,    Let me embrace thee in my weary arms.  8. O Lancaster', I fear thy overthrow.  9. Ye crags' and peaks', I'm with you once again.  Exception 1.--Relative emphasis often reverses this and the first rule, because emphasis is here expressed in part by changing the usual inflections.  EXAMPLES. (23)  1. If you care not for your property', you surely value your life'.  2. If you will not labor for your own' advancement, you should regard that of your children'.  3. It is your place to obey', not to command'.  4. Though by that course he should not destroy his reputation', he will lose all self-respect'.  Exception 2.--The names of persons addressed in a formal speech, or when used emphatically, have the falling inflection.   EXAMPLES. (24)  1. Romans, countrymen, and lovers', hear me for my cause, etc.  2. Gentlemen of the jury', I solicit your attention, etc.  3. O Hubert', Hubert', save me from these men.   RULE V.--Negative sentences and parts of sentences, usually require the rising inflection.   EXAMPLES. (24)  1. It is not by starts of application that eminence can be attained'.  2. It was not an eclipse that caused the darkness at the crucifixion of our Lord'; for the sun and moon were not relatively in a position' to produce an eclipse'.  3. They are not fighting': do not disturb' them: this man is not expiring with agony': that man is not dead': they are only pausing'.  4. My Lord, we could not have had such designs'.  5. You are not left alone to climb the steep ascent': God is with you, who never suffers the spirit that rests on him to fail.   Exception 1.--Emphasis may reverse this rule.   EXAMPLE. (24)  We repeat it, we do not' desire to produce discord; we do not' wish to kindle the flames of a civil war.   Exception 2.--General propositions and commands usually have the falling inflection.   EXAMPLES. (25)  God is not the author of sin'. Thou shalt not kill.  RULE VI.--Interrogative sentences, and members of sentences which can be answered by yes or no generally require the rising inflection.   EXAMPLES. (25)  1.
