Furthermore there are worse wights in the wood than they be-- God save us!--but against them have I a good hauberk, a neck-guard which I will give thee, son, in token that I look to see thee again at the lovely house of Mary our Mother.\"  Ralph had taken the bowl and was drinking, but he looked over the brim, and saw how the monk drew from his frock a pair of beads, as like to Dame Katherine's gift as one pea to another, save that at the end thereof was a little box shapen crosswise.  Ralph emptied the bowl hastily, got out of bed, and sat on the bed naked, save that on his neck was Dame Katherine's gift.  He reached out his hand and took the beads from the monk and reddened therewith, as was his wont when he had to begin a contest in words: but he said:  \"I thank thee, father; yet God wot if these beads will lie sweetly alongside the collar which I bear on my neck as now, which is the gift of a dear friend.\"  The monk made up a solemn countenance and said: \"Thou sayest sooth, my son; it is most like that my chaplet, which hath been blessed time was by the holy Richard, is no meet fellow for the gift of some light love of thine: or even,\" quoth he, noting Ralph's flush deepen, and his brow knit, \"or even if it were the gift of a well-willer, yet belike it is a worldly gift; therefore, since thy journey is with peril, thou wert best do it off and let me keep it for thee till thou comest again.\"  Now as he spake he looked anxiously, nay, it may be said greedily, at the young man.  But Ralph said nought; for in his heart he was determined not to chaffer away his gossip's gift for any shaveling's token.  Yet he knew not how to set his youthful words against the father's wisdom; so he stood up, and got his shirt into his hand, and as he did it over his head he fell to singing to himself a song of eventide of the High House of Upmeads, the words whereof were somewhat like to these:     Art thou man, art thou maid, through the long grass a-going?     For short shirt thou bearest, and no beard I see,   And the last wind ere moonrise about thee is blowing.     Would'st thou meet with thy maiden or look'st thou for me?    Bright shineth the moon now, I see thy gown longer;     And down by the hazels Joan meeteth her lad:   But hard is thy palm, lass, and scarcely were stronger     Wat's grip than thine hand-kiss that maketh me glad.    And now as the candles shine on us and over,     Full shapely thy feet are, but brown on the floor,   As the bare-footed mowers amidst of the clover     When the gowk's note is broken and mid-June is o'er.    O hard are mine hand-palms because on the ridges     I carried the reap-hook and smote for thy sake;   And in the hot noon-tide I beat off the midges     As thou slep'st 'neath the linden o'er-loathe to awake.    And brown are my feet now because the sun burneth     High up on the down-side amidst of the sheep,   And there in the hollow wherefrom the wind turneth,     Thou lay'st in my lap while I sung thee to sleep.    O friend of the earth, O come nigher and nigher,     Thou art sweet with the sun's kiss as meads of the May,   O'er the rocks of the waste, o'er the water and fire,     Will I follow thee, love, till earth waneth away.   The monk hearkened to him with knitted brow, and as one that liketh not the speech of his fellow, though it be not wise to question it: then he went out of the chamber, but left the pair of beads lying in the window.  But Ralph clad himself in haste, and when he was fully clad, went up to the window and took the beads in his hand, and looked into them curiously and turned them over, but left them lying there.  Then he went forth also, and came into the forecourt of the house, and found there a squire of the men-at-arms with his weapons and horse, who helped him to do on his war-gear.  So then, just as he was setting his foot in the stirrup, came the Brother again, with his face once more grown smiling and happy; and in his left hand he held the chaplet, but did not offer it to Ralph again, but nodded his head to him kindly, and said: \"Now, lord, I can see by thy face that thou art set on beholding the fashion of this world, and most like it will give thee the rue.\"  Then came a word into Ralph's mouth, and he said: \"Wilt thou tell me, father, whose work was the world's fashion?\"  The monk reddened, but answered nought, and Ralph spake again:  \"Forsooth, did the craftsman of it fumble over his work?\"  Then the monk scowled, but presently he enforced himself to speak blithely, and said:  \"Such matters are over high for my speech or thine, lord; but I tell thee, who knoweth, that there are men in this House who have tried the world and found it wanting.\"  Ralph smiled, and said stammering:  \"Father, did the world try them, and find them wanting perchance?\"  Then he reddened, and said:  \"Are ye verily all such as this in this House?  Who then is it who hath made so fair a lordship, and so goodly a governance for so many people?  Know ye not at all of the world's ways!\"  \"Fair sir,\" said the monk sternly, \"they that work for us work for the Lord and all his servants.\"  \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"so it is; and will the Lord be content with the service of him whom the devil hath cast out because he hath found him a dastard?\"  The monk frowned, yet smiled somewhat withal, and said: \"Sir, thou art young, but thy wits are over old for me; but there are they in this House who may answer thee featly; men who have read the books of the wise men of the heathen, and the doctors of Holy Church, and are even now making books for the scribes to copy.\"  Then his voice softened, and he said: \"Dear lord, we should be right fain of thee here, but since thou must needs go, go with my blessing, and double blessing shalt thou have when thou comest back to us.\"  Then Ralph remembered his promise to the shepherds and took a gold crown from his pouch, and said: \"Father, I pray thee say a mass for the shepherd downsmen; and this is for the offering.\"  The monk praised the gift and the bidding, and kissed Ralph, who clomb into his saddle; and the brother hospitalier brought him his wallet with good meat and drink therein for the way.  Then Ralph shook his rein, and rode out of the abbey-gate, smiling at the lay-brethren and the men-at-arms who hung about there.  But he sighed for pleasure when he found himself in the street again, and looked on the shops of the chapmen and the booths of the petty craftsmen, as shoe-smiths and glovers, and tinsmiths and coppersmiths, and horners and the like; and the folk that he met as he rode toward the southern gate seemed to him merry and in good case, and goodly to look on.  And he thought it pleasant to gaze on the damsels in the street, who were fair and well clad:  and there were a many of them about his way now, especially as he drew nigh the gate before the streets branched off: for folk were coming in from the countryside with victual and other wares for the town and the Abbey; and surely as he looked on some of the maidens he deemed that Hall-song of Upmeads a good one.    CHAPTER 7  The Maiden of Bourton Abbas   So went he through the gate, and many, both of men and maids gazed at him, for he was fair to look on, but none meddled with him.  There was a goodly fauburg outside the gate, and therein were fair houses, not a few, with gardens and orchards about them; and when these were past he rode through very excellent meadows lying along the water, which he crossed thrice, once by a goodly stone bridge and twice by fords; for the road was straight, and the river wound about much.  After a little while the road led him off the plain meads into a country of little hills and dales, the hill-sides covered with vineyards and orchards, and the dales plenteous of corn-fields; and now amongst these dales Higham was hidden from him.  Through this tillage and vine-land he rode a good while, and thought he had never seen a goodlier land; and as he went he came on husbandmen and women of the country going about their business: yet were they not too busy to gaze on him, and most greeted him; and with some he gave and took a little speech.  These people also he deemed well before the world, for they were well clad and buxom, and made no great haste as they went, but looked about them as though they deemed the world worth looking at, and as if they had no fear either of a blow or a hard word for loitering.  So he rode till it was noon, and he was amidst a little thorp of grey stone houses, trim enough, in a valley wherein there was more of wild-wood trees and less of fruit-bearers than those behind him.  In the thorp was a tavern with the sign of the Nicholas, so Ralph deemed it but right to enter a house which was under the guard of his master and friend; therefore he lighted down and went in.  Therein he found a lad of fifteen winters, and a maiden spinning, they two alone, who hailed him and asked his pleasure, and he bade them bring him meat and drink, and look to his horse, for that he had a mind to rest a while. So they brought him bread and flesh, and good wine of the hill-side, in a little hall well arrayed as of its kind; and he sat down and the damsel served him at table, but the lad, who had gone to see to his horse, did not come back.  So when he had eaten and drunk, and the damsel was still there, he looked on her and saw that she was sad and drooping of aspect; and whereas she was a fair maiden, Ralph, now that he was full, fell to pitying her, and asked her what was amiss.  \"For,\" said he, \"thou art fair and ailest nought; that is clear to see; neither dwellest thou in penury, but by seeming hast enough and to spare.  Or art thou a servant in this house, and hath any one misused thee?\"  She wept at his words, for indeed he spoke softly to her; then she said:  \"Young lord, thou art kind, and it is thy kindness that draweth the tears from me; else "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/169"],["title","The Well at the World's End: A Tale (#8)"],["body","were not well to weep before a young man: therefore I pray thee pardon me.  As for me, I am no servant, nor has any one misused me: the folk round about are good and neighbourly; and this house and the croft, and a vineyard hard by, all that is mine own and my brother's; that is the lad who hath gone to tend thine horse. Yea, and we live in peace here for the most part; for this thorp, which is called Bourton Abbas, is a land of the Abbey of Higham; though it be the outermost of its lands and the Abbot is a good lord and a defence against tyrants.  All is well with me if one thing were not.\"  \"What is thy need then?\" said Ralph, \"if perchance I might amend it.\" And as he looked on her he deemed her yet fairer than he had done at first.  But she stayed her weeping and sobbing and said:  \"Sir, I fear me that I have lost a dear friend.\"  \"How then,\" said he, \"why fearest thou, and knowest not? doth thy friend lie sick between life and death?\" \"O Sir,\" she said, \"it is the Wood which is the evil and disease.\"  \"What wood is that?\" said he.  She said:  \"The Wood Perilous, that lieth betwixt us and the Burg of the Four Friths, and all about the Burg.  And, Sir, if ye be minded to ride to the Burg to-day, do it not, for through the wood must thou wend thereto; and ye are young and lovely.  Therefore take my rede, and abide till the Chapmen wend thither from Higham, who ride many in company.  For, look you, fair lord, ye have asked of my grief, and this it is and nought else; that my very earthly love and speech-friend rode five days ago toward the Burg of the Four Friths all alone through the Wood Perilous, and he has not come back, though we looked to see him in three days' wearing:  but his horse has come back, and the reins and the saddle all bloody.\"  And she fell a-weeping with the telling of the tale.  But Ralph said (for he knew not what to say): \"Keep a good heart, maiden; maybe he is safe and sound; oft are young men fond to wander wide, even as I myself.\"  She looked at him hard and said:  \"If thou hast stolen thyself away from them that love thee, thou hast done amiss.  Though thou art a lord, and so fair as I see thee, yet will I tell thee so much.\"  Ralph reddened and answered nought; but deemed the maiden both fair and sweet.  But she said:  \"Whether thou hast done well or ill, do no worse; but abide till the Chapmen come from Higham, on their way to the Burg of the Four Friths.  Here mayst thou lodge well and safely if thou wilt.  Or if our hall be not dainty enough for thee, then go back to Higham: I warrant me the monks will give thee good guesting as long as thou wilt.\"  \"Thou art kind, maiden,\" said Ralph, \"but why should I tarry for an host? and what should I fear in the Wood, as evil as it may be?  One man journeying with little wealth, and unknown, and he no weakling, but bearing good weapons, hath nought to dread of strong-thieves, who ever rob where it is easiest and gainfullest.  And what worse may I meet than strong-thieves?\"  \"But thou mayest meet worse,\" she said; and therewith fell a-weeping again, and said amidst her tears:  \"O weary on my life!  And why should I heed thee when nought heedeth me, neither the Saints of God's House, nor the Master of it; nor the father and the mother that were once so piteous kind to me?  O if I might but drink a draught from the WELL AT THE WORLD'S END!\"  He turned about on her hastily at that word; for he had risen to depart; being grieved at her grief and wishful to be away from it, since he might not amend it.  But now he said eagerly:  \"Where then is that Well?  Know ye of it in this land?\"  \"At least I know the hearsay thereof,\" she said; \"but as now thou shalt know no more from me thereof; lest thou wander the wider in seeking it. I would not have thy life spilt.\"  Ever as he looked on her he thought her still fairer; and now he looked long on her, saying nought, and she on him in likewise, and the blood rose to her cheeks and her brow, but she would not turn her from his gaze.  At last he said: \"Well then, I must depart, no more learned than I came: but yet am I less hungry and thirsty than I came; and have thou thanks therefor.\"  Therewith he took from his pouch a gold piece of Upmeads, which was good, and of the touch of the Easterlings, and held it out to her.  And she put out her open hand and he put the money in it; but thought it good to hold her hand a while, and she gainsayed him not.  Then he said:  \"Well then, I must needs depart with things left as they are: wilt thou bid thy brother bring hither my horse, for time presses.\"  \"Yea,\" she said (and her hand was still in his), \"Yet do thine utmost, yet shalt thou not get to the Burg before nightfall.  O wilt thou not tarry?\"  \"Nay,\" he said, \"my heart will not suffer it; lest I deem myself a dastard.\"  Then she reddened again, but as if she were wroth; and she drew her hand away from his and smote her palms together thrice and cried out: \"Ho Hugh! bring hither the Knight's horse and be speedy!\"  And she went hither and thither about the hall and into the buttery and back, putting away the victual and vessels from the board and making as if she heeded him not:  and Ralph looked on her, and deemed that each way she moved was better than the last, so shapely of fashion she was; and again he bethought him of the Even-song of the High House at Upmeads, and how it befitted her; for she went barefoot after the manner of maidens who work afield, and her feet were tanned with the sun of hay harvest, but as shapely as might be; but she was clad goodly withal, in a green gown wrought with flowers.  So he watched her going to and fro; and at last he said: \"Maiden, wilt thou come hither a little, before I depart?\"  \"Yea,\" she said; and came and stood before him: and he deemed that she was scarce so sad as she had been; and she stood with her hands joined and her eyes downcast.  Then he said:  \"Now I depart.  Yet I would say this, that I am sorry of thy sorrow: and now since I shall never see thee more, small would be the harm if I were to kiss thy lips and thy face.\"  And therewith he took her hands in his and drew her to him, and put his arms about her and kissed her many times, and she nothing lothe by seeming; and he found her as sweet as May blossom.  Thereafter she smiled on him, yet scarce for gladness, and said: \"It is not all so sure that I shall not see thee again; yet shall I do to thee as thou hast done to me.\"  Therewith she took his face between her hands, and kissed him well-favouredly; so that the hour seemed good to him.  Then she took him by the hand and led him out-a-doors to his horse, whereby the lad had been standing a good while; and he when he saw his sister come out with the fair knight he scowled on them, and handled a knife which hung at his girdle; but Ralph heeded him nought.  As for the damsel, she put her brother aside, and held the stirrup for Ralph; and when he was in the saddle she said to him:  \"All luck go with thee!  Forsooth I deem thee safer in the Wood than my words said.  Verily I deem that if thou wert to meet a company of foemen, thou wouldest compel them to do thy bidding.\"  \"Farewell to thee maiden,\" said Ralph, \"and mayst thou find thy beloved whole and well, and that speedily.  Fare-well!\"  She said no more; so he shook his rein and rode his ways; but looked over his shoulder presently and saw her standing yet barefoot on the dusty highway shading her eyes from the afternoon sun and looking after him, and he waved his hand to her and so went his ways between the houses of the Thorp.    CHAPTER 8  Ralph Cometh to the Wood Perilous.  An Adventure Therein   Now when he was clear of the Thorp the road took him out of the dale; and when he was on the hill's brow he saw that the land was of other fashion from that which lay behind him.  For the road went straight through a rough waste, no pasture, save for mountain sheep or goats, with a few bushes scattered about it; and beyond this the land rose into a long ridge; and on the ridge was a wood thick with trees, and no break in them.  So on he rode, and soon passed that waste, which was dry and parched, and the afternoon sun was hot on it; so he deemed it good to come under the shadow of the thick trees (which at the first were wholly beech trees), for it was now the hottest of the day.  There was still a beaten way between the tree-boles, though not overwide, albeit, a highway, since it pierced the wood.  So thereby he went at a soft pace for the saving of his horse, and thought but little of all he had been told of the perils of the way, and not a little of the fair maid whom he had left behind at the Thorp.  After a while the thick beech-wood gave out, and he came into a place where great oaks grew, fair and stately, as though some lord's wood-reeve had taken care that they should not grow over close together, and betwixt them the greensward was fine, unbroken, and flowery.  Thereby as he rode he beheld deer, both buck and hart and roe, and other wild things, but for a long while no man.  The afternoon wore and still he rode the oak wood, and deemed it a goodly forest for the greatest king on earth.  At last he came to where another road crossed the way he followed, and about the crossway was the ground clearer of trees, while beyond it the trees grew thicker, and there was some underwood of holly and thorn as the ground fell off as towards a little dale.  There Ralph drew rein, because he doubted in his mind which was his right road toward the Burg of the Four Friths; so he got off his horse and abode a little, if perchance any might come by; he looked about him, and noted on the road that crossed his, and the sward about it, the sign of many horses having gone by, and deemed that they had passed but a little while.  So he lay on the ground to rest him and let his horse stray about and bite the grass; for the beast loved him and would come at his call or his whistle.  Ralph was drowsy when he lay down, and "]]]
