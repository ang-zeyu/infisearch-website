I wish, with your leave, to say just a word,--       'Tis a word of advice from a friend.      \"Never part with old shoes till they part from you;       Let your new ones be always well tried;     Old shoes and old friends are far better than new,       And, trust me, more worthy of pride.      \"Our strings and our toes are bad, we must own,       But they can be easily mended.     I have done,\" said the shoe, in a kind, easy tone,       And it gaped as the lecture was ended.      New toes and new heels now the old shoes have got,       New strings, too, their beauty renew;     Frank wears them in peace, and has never forgot       The words of the friendly old shoe.   THE MONKEYS AND THE BEARS.  TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF GELLART.      The monkeys, 'tis said, once asked of the bears,     How it was that their nation so much surpassed theirs,     And begged that the means they would graciously tell     By which the young bears were kept hearty and well.     \"Perhaps it may be,\" said one of the mothers,     Who seemed more considerate and wise than the others,     \"Perhaps,\" said she, trembling at even the thought,     \"We give our dear young ones less food than we ought;     We may be impatient; I have really some fears     That we rock them too little, the poor little dears;     Our milk may cause fever, and their stomachs not suit,     Or perhaps they are weakened and injured by fruit.     Perhaps the whole mischief is caused by the air,     And who 'gainst this evil can ever prepare?     In their earliest years, it may poison instil,     And through their whole lifetime produce every ill.     Perhaps it may be, before we are aware,     They breathe in a pestilence, borne on the air.     Perhaps, for the nerves of us monkeys are weak,     In jumping, or leaping, some bone they may break     In their breasts.\" Here, for weeping, she scarcely could speak,     And she snatched up her little one long to her breast;     With such vehement love the poor victim she pressed,     That all its complainings and troubles were stilled;     Alas the poor mother! her pet she had killed.      Said the bear,--\"No longer I think you need seek     For the cause why your young ones are sickly and weak;     It is not the milk, nor the fruit, nor the air,     Nor fault of the stomach, and 'tis no lack of care.     Your blind fondness it is that cuts short their days.     How is it that we such multitudes raise?     As soon as our young ones are able to run,     We take them out with us to play in the sun.     We take them through floods, through heat, and through cold,     And so they are healthy, and live to be old.\"   THE END.

NOTICES OF THE PRESS.  \"A more interesting and instructive biographical work we have never read. High as was our opinion of Channing,--of his intellectual and moral worth,--the perusal of this work has convinced us that we never duly estimated him.... His letters reveal his character more fully than his sermons and essays. In his letters he lays his heart entirely open; and no man, no matter what his opinions or prejudices, can read them without saying,--'Channing was, indeed, a great and good man,--one who lived for the world!'\"--_Christian Messenger._  \"Only one who was similar in purpose and temper,--who felt like aspirations, hopes, and faith,--could at all do justice to the distinguished subject. The present book must, therefore, we are sure, give us Channing's character in its completeness, and true harmony and proportions of parts.\"--_Salem Observer._  \"These memoirs of a great and good man will, we apprehend, obtain an uncommonly extensive circulation, not only among the denomination of Christians in which he ranked himself, but with all who reverence purity of character, an enlarged philanthropy, and eminent talents, guided by virtue and piety.\"--_Salem Register._  \"If we mistake not, now is the very time in God's providence when the biography of William Ellery Channing could best make its appearance. We have heard that a distinguished divine, of different speculative religious views from Dr. Channing, has recently said,--'Channing is greatly needed among us at this present moment.' Behold him here! We doubt not that the biography thus prepared is to make a great impression on the age that is passing, and that is yet to come.\"--_Christian Register._  SERMONS ON CHRISTIAN COMMUNION.

This work is not confined to the subject of the Lord's Supper, but \"forms a series of practical discourses of the persuasive kind, relating to repentance, or the duty of commencing the Christian course,--to edification, or the encouragements to progressive Christian improvement,--and to the eucharistic service, as affording exercise for all the grateful and devout affections of the heart in every stage of its subjection to Christian discipline.\"--_Preface._  The following is a list of the writers:--  Rev.

We chanced to open at Sermon XVIII., on Christian Education, and were pleased to see the idea of Dr. Bushnell's celebrated book on 'Christian Nurture' illustrated and urged in a sermon by Dr. Putnam, preached two years before Dr. Bushnell's book made its appearance.\"--_Christian Register._  \"The tone of these sermons, their living interest, their unpremeditated variety in unity, fit them well for this purpose,--close personal influence on minds of widely differing views, united in the one great aim of a Christian life. We shall probably take an early opportunity of making some selections.\"--_Christian Inquirer._  \"We think the volume is upon the whole one of the best volumes of discourses ever issued from the American press.\"--_Boston Daily Atlas._  THE GOSPEL NARRATIVES, their Origin, Peculiarities, and Transmission. By Rev. HENRY A. MILES. 16mo. pp. 174. Price, 50 cents.  This work is designed for families and Sunday Schools, and contains a comparison of each Gospel with the education, life, and character of its author, and with the purpose which he had in view in its composition; as also an account of the transmission of the Gospels down to our time, and the evidence of their uncorrupted preservation.  \"This volume by Mr. Miles has substantial value. It is by the circulation and use of such books that Christian knowledge is to be extended, and Christian faith confirmed. By a thorough study even of this small work in childhood, many persons might have the satisfaction of carrying through life a clear and connected idea of the biographies of Jesus, and of the nature of the external evidence in their favor, instead of remaining in vague uncertainty on the whole subject. Bringing into a simple and popular form, and small compass, information not hitherto accessible, except to a limited number of persons, the 'Gospel Narratives' will be interesting to the general reader, whether youthful or adult. It must, without doubt, be introduced in all our Sunday Schools, and will rank among the most important manuals.\"  NAOMI; or Boston Two Hundred Years Ago.

Her style is elevated and earnest. Her sentiments, of the pure and the true. The characters are well conceived, and are presented each in strong individuality, and with such apparent truthfulness as almost to leave us in doubt whether they are 'beings of the mind,' or were real men and women who bore the parts she assigns them in those dark tragedies that stained this 'fair heritage of freedom' in the early days of Massachusetts.\"--_Worcester Palladium._  \"We have been exceedingly interested in this book, and recommend it as a beautiful picture of female piety and quiet heroism, set in a frame of history and tradition, that cannot fail to please every one connected, however remotely, with the land of the Puritans.

Price, 75 cents.  \"The charm of the book lies in the elevated tone of thought and moral sentiment which pervades it. You feel, on closing the volume, as if leaving some ancient cathedral, where your soul had been mingling with ascending anthems and prayers. There is scarcely a page which does not contain some fine strain of thought or sentiment, over which you shut the book that you may pause and meditate.  \"We recommend the volume to our readers, with the assurance that they will find few works in the current literature of the day so well worth perusal.\"--_Christian Register._  \"This is really an original book. We have seen nothing for a long time more fresh or true. The writer has succeeded wonderfully, in taking himself and his readers into the heart of the age he describes. What is more, he has uttered words and thoughts which stir up the deep places of the soul. Let those read who wish to commune with the true and unpretending martyr-spirit, the spread of faith and endurance, courage, self denial, forgiveness, prayer.  \"Of all the treatises we have ever read on marriage, we have seen none so good as one here called a 'Marriage Sermon'; not that we would ask any couple to hear it all on their marriage day, but we commend it to all who are married, or intend to be. The whole book is precious.\"--_Providence Journal._  \"There are few religious books which breathe a finer spirit than this singular volume. The author's mind seems to have meditated deeply on the awful realities of life. In the thoughtful flow of his periods, and the grave, earnest eloquence of particular passages, we are sometimes reminded of the Old English prose writers.

It may be most unreservedly recommended, especially to the young.\"--_Daily Advertiser._  \"Your gift of 'Self-Formation' is truly a welcome one, and I am greatly obliged to you for it. It is a work of quite original character, and I esteem it (in common with all I know of, who have read it) as possessed of very rare merit. I am glad, for the cause of good education and sound principle, that you have republished it, and I wish every young man and woman in the community might be induced to read it carefully.

A London periodical, in reviewing it, says:--\"We will venture to predict that it will soon take its place on the shelves of our religious libraries, beside Ware 'On the Christian Character,' Greenwood's 'Lives of the Apostles,' and other works to which we might refer as standard publications, the value of which is not likely to be diminished by the lapse of time or the caprices of fashion.\"  \"The sense of duty in parents and teachers may be strengthened and elevated by contemplating the high standard which is here held up to them. The style has the great merit of being an earnest one, and there are many passages which rise into genuine eloquence and the glow of poetry.\"--_N.A.

Horace Mann, Secretary of the Board of Education._  DOMESTIC WORSHIP. By WILLIAM H. FURNESS, Pastor of the First Congregational Unitarian Church in Philadelphia. Third Edition. 12mo. pp. 272. Price, 75 cents.  \"We are glad to see this book. It is a work of great and peculiar excellence. It is not a compilation from other books of devotion; nor is it made up of conventional phrases and Scripture quotations, which have been so long employed as the language of prayer, that they are repeated without thought and without feeling. It is admirably adapted to the purpose for which it was written; and it may be read again and again with great interest and profit by any one, who desires to enrich his mind with the purest sentiments of devotion, and with the language in which it finds its best expression. Here we have the genuine utterances of religious sensibility,--fresh, natural, and original, as they come from a mind of singular fertility and beauty, and a heart overflowing with love to God and love to man. They seem not like prayers made with hands, to be printed in a book, but _real praying_, full of spirit and life.... So remarkable is their tone of reality and genuineness, that we cannot bring ourselves to regard them as compositions written for a purpose, but rather as the actual utterances of a pure and elevated soul in reverent and immediate communion with the Infinite Father.\"--_Christian Examiner._  LAYS FOR THE SABBATH.

Many are keenly alive to the harmony of verse and the fresh outbursts of poetic feeling, who would pore with delight over such a volume, and many might thus be won to high thought and serious reflection.\"--_Christian Examiner._  THE YOUNG MAIDEN.
