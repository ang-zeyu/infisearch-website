[Published under the direction of the General Literature Committee.]     PREFACE   It has been decided in publishing this volume to reproduce the illustrations with which the verses originally appeared in _Aunt Judy's Magazine_. In all cases Mrs. Ewing wrote the lines to fit the pictures, and it is worthy of note to observe how closely she has introduced every detail into her words. Most of the woodcuts are by German artists, Oscar Pletsch, Fedor Flinzer, and others; but the frontispiece is from an original sketch by Mr. Gordon Browne. In accordance with his special desire, it has only been used for Mrs. Ewing's poem, as the Convalescent was a little friend of the artist, who did not live to complete his recovery. The poem is the last that Mrs. Ewing wrote for children, and it was penned when she herself was enduring the discomforts of convalescence with all the courage she so warmly advocates.  Mr. Randolph Caldecott's illustrations to \"Mother's Birthday Review\" first appeared in his _Sketch Book_, but the letterpress that accompanied them was very brief, and Mrs. Ewing could not resist asking permission to write some verses to the pictures, and publish them in _Aunt Judy's Magazine_. This favour was kindly granted, and by Mrs. Caldecott's further kindness the sketches are again used here.  The contents of this volume have been arranged chronologically as far as is possible.  \"The Willow Man\" and \"Grandmother's Spring\" were both written to protest against wantonly wasting Dame Nature's gifts, and the Note on page 69 shows that Mrs. Ewing had learnt this lesson herself in childhood. My Father has lately recalled an incident which he believes first roused our Mother to teach the lesson to us. They were driving to Sheffield one day, when on Bolsover Hill they saw a well-known veterinary surgeon of the district, Mr. Peech, who had dismounted from his horse, and was carefully taking up a few roots of white violets from a bank where they grew in some profusion. He showed Mrs. Gatty what he was gathering, but told her he was taking care to _leave a bit behind_. This happened fully forty years ago, long before the Selborne and other Societies for the preservation of rare plants and birds had come into existence, and Mother was much impressed and pleased by Mr. Peech's delicate scrupulousness.  \"A Soldier's Children\" was written in 1879, whilst many friends were fighting in South Africa, and ten years before a story bearing the same name was issued by the writer of _Bootles' Baby_.  The \"Songs for Music\" appeared in 1874 in a volume called _Songs by Four Friends_, except the two last poems, \"Anemones\" and \"Autumn Tints.\" The former was given by Mrs. Ewing to her brother, Mr. Alfred Scott-Gatty, to set to music, and it has recently been published by Messrs. Boosey. \"Autumn Tints\" was found amongst Mrs. Ewing's papers after her death, and is now printed for the first time.  HORATIA K.F. EDEN.  _June 1895._     CONTENTS.   VERSES FOR CHILDREN.

Found in the garden--dead in his beauty.       Ah! that a linnet should die in the spring!     Bury him, comrades, in pitiful duty,       Muffle the dinner-bell, solemnly ring.      Bury him kindly--up in the corner;       Bird, beast, and gold-fish are sepulchred there;     Bid the black kitten march as chief mourner,       Waving her tail like a plume in the air.      Bury him nobly--next to the donkey;       Fetch the old banner, and wave it about:     Bury him deeply--think of the monkey,       Shallow his grave, and the dogs got him out.      Bury him softly--white wool around him,       Kiss his poor feathers,--the first kiss and last;     Tell his poor widow kind friends have found him:       Plant his poor grave with whatever grows fast.      Farewell, sweet singer! dead in thy beauty,       Silent through summer, though other birds sing;     Bury him, comrades, in pitiful duty,       Muffle the dinner-bell, mournfully ring.         [Illustration: MASTER FRITZ.]       Fritz and I are not brother and sister, but we're next-door              neighbours; for we both live next door.     I mean we both live next door to each other; for I live at              number three, and Fritz and Nickel the dog live at number              four.     In summer we climb through the garret windows and sit              together on the leads,     And if the sun is too hot Mother lends us one big kerchief              to put over both our heads.     Sometimes she gives us tea under the myrtle tree in the big              pot that stands in the gutter.     (One slice each, and I always give Fritz the one that has              the most butter.)     In winter we sit on the little stool by the stove at number four;     For when it's cold Fritz doesn't like to go out to come in next door.     It was one day in spring that he said, \"I should like to              have a house to myself with you Grethel, and Nickel.\" And I              said, \"Thank you, Fritz.\"     And he said, \"If you'll come in at tea-time and sit by the stove, I'll              tell you tales that'll frighten you into fits.     About boys who ran away from their homes, and were taken by robbers,              and run after by wolves, and altogether in a dreadful state.     I saw the pictures of it in a book I was looking in, to see where              perhaps I should like to emigrate.     I've not quite settled whether I shall, or be cast away on a desert              island, or settle down nearer home;     But you'd better come in and hear about it, and then, wherever it is,              you'll be sure to be ready to come.\"     So I took my darling Katerina in my arms, and we went in to tea.     I love Katerina, though she lost her head long ago, poor thing; but              Fritz made me put her off my knee,     For he said, \"When you're hushabying that silly old doll I know you're              not attending to me.     Now look here, Grethel, I think I have made up my mind that we won't              go far;     For we can have a house, and I can be master of it just as well where              we are.     Under the stairs would be a good place for a house for us if there's              room.     It's very dirty, but you're the housewife now, and you must sweep it              out well with the broom.     I shall expect you to keep my house very comfortable, and have my meals              ready when there's anything to eat;     And when Nickel and I come back from playing outside, you may peep out              and pretend you're watching for us coming up the street.     You've kept your apple, I see--I've eaten mine--well, it will be              something to make a start,     And I'll put by some of my cake, if you'll keep some of yours, and              remember Nickel must have part.     I call it your cake and your apple, but of course now you're my              housewife everything belongs to me;     But I shall give you the management of it, and you must make it go as              far as you can amongst three.     And if you make nice feasts every day for me and Nickel, and never              keep us waiting for our food,     And always do everything I want, and attend to everything I say, I'm              sure I shall almost always be good.     And if I am naughty now and then, it'll most likely be your fault;              and, if it isn't, you mustn't mind;     For even if I seem to be cross, you ought to know that I mean to be              kind.     And I'm sure you'll like combing Nickel's hair for my sake; it'll be              something for you to do, and it bothers me so!     But it must be done regularly, for if it's not, his curls tangle into              lugs as they grow.     I think that's all, dear Grethel, for I love you so much that I'm sure              to be easy to please.     Only remember--it's a trifle--but when I want you, never keep that              headless doll on your knees.     I'd much rather not have her in my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16686"],["title","Verses for Children, and Songs for Music (#1)"],["body","se--there, don't cry! if you              will have her, I suppose it must be;     Though I can't think what you want with Katerina when you've got              Nickel and me.\"     So I said, \"Thank you, dear Fritz, for letting me bring her, for I've              had her so long I shouldn't like to part with her now;     And I'll try and do everything you want as well as I can, now you've              told me how.\"     But next morning I heard Fritz's garret-window open, and he put out              his head,     And shouted, \"Grethel! Grethel! I want you. Be quick! Haven't you got              out of bed?\"     I ran to the window and said, \"What is it, dear Fritz?\" and he said,              \"I want to tell you that I've changed my mind.     Hans-Wandermann is here, and he says there are real sapphires on the              beach; so I'm off to see what I can find.\"     \"Oh, Fritz!\" I said, \"can't I come too?\" but he said, \"You'd better              not, you'll only be in the way.     You can stop quietly at home with Katerina, and you may have Nickel              too, if he'll stay.\"     But Nickel wouldn't. I give him far more of my cake than Fritz does,              but he likes Fritz better than me.     So dear Katerina and I had breakfast together on the leads under the              old myrtle tree.         THE WILLOW-MAN.       There once was a Willow, and he was very old,     And all his leaves fell off from him, and left him in the cold;     But ere the rude winter could buffet him with snow,     There grew upon his hoary head a crop of Mistletoe.      All wrinkled and furrowed was this old Willow's skin,     His taper fingers trembled, and his arms were very thin;     Two round eyes and hollow, that stared but did not see,     And sprawling feet that never walked, had this most ancient tree.      A Dame who dwelt near was the only one who knew     That every year upon his head the Christmas berries grew;     And when the Dame cut them, she said--it was her whim--     \"A merry Christmas to you, Sir!\" _and left a bit for him_.      \"Oh, Granny dear, tell us,\" the children cried, \"where we     May find the shining Mistletoe that grows upon the tree?\"     At length the Dame told them, but cautioned them to mind     To greet the Willow civilly, _and leave a bit behind_.      \"Who cares,\" said the children, \"for this old Willow-man?     We'll take the Mistletoe, and he may catch us if he can.\"     With rage the ancient Willow shakes in every limb,     For they have taken all, and _have not left a bit for him_!      Then bright gleamed the holly, the Christmas berries shone,     But in the wintry wind without the Willow-man did moan:     \"Ungrateful, and wasteful! the mystic Mistletoe     A hundred years hath grown on me, but never more shall grow.\"      A year soon passed by, and the children came once more,     But not a sprig of Mistletoe the aged Willow bore.     Each slender spray pointed; he mocked them in his glee,     And chuckled in his wooden heart, that ancient Willow-tree.      MORAL.      Oh, children, who gather the spoils of wood and wold,     From selfish greed and wilful waste your little hands withhold.     Though fair things be common, this moral bear in mind,     \"Pick thankfully and modestly, and leave a bit behind.\"         [Illustration]      OUR GARDEN.       The winter is gone; and at first Jack and I were sad,     Because of the snow-man's melting, but now we are glad;     For the spring has come, and it's warm, and we're allowed to garden              in the afternoon;     And summer is coming, and oh, how lovely our flowers will be in June!     We are so fond of flowers, it makes us quite happy to think     Of our beds--all colours--blue, white, yellow, purple, and pink,     Scarlet, lilac, and crimson! And we're fond of sweet scents as well,     And mean to have pinks, roses, sweet peas, mignonette, clove              carnations, musk, and everything good to smell;     Lavender, rosemary, and we should like a lemon-scented verbena, and              a big myrtle tree!     And then if we could get an old \"preserved-ginger\" pot, and some              bay-salt, we could make _pot-pourri_.     Jack and I have a garden, though it's not so large as the big one,              you know;     But whatever can be got to grow in a garden we mean to grow.     We've got Bachelor's Buttons, and London Pride, and Old Man, and              everything that's nice:     And last year Jack sowed green peas for our dolls' dinners, but they              were eaten up by the mice.     And he would plant potatoes in furrows, which made the garden in a              mess,     So this year we mean to have no kitchen-garden but mustard and cress.     One of us plants, and the other waters, but Jack likes the              watering-pot;     And then when my turn comes to water he says it's too hot!     We sometimes quarrel about the garden, and once Jack hit me with              the spade;     So we settled to divide it in two by a path up the middle, and              that's made.     We want some yellow sand now to make the walk pretty, but there's none              about here,     So we mean to get some in the old carpet-bag, if we go to the seaside              this year.     On Monday we went to the wood and got primrose plants and a sucker of              a dog-rose;     It looks like a green stick in the middle of the bed at present; but              wait till it blows!     The primroses were in full flower, and the rose ought to flower soon;     You've no idea how lovely they are in that wood in June!     The primroses look quite withered now, I am sorry to say,     But that is not our fault but Nurse's, and it shows how hard it is to              garden when you can't have your own way.     We planted them carefully, and were just going to water them all in              a lump,     When Nurse fetched us both indoors, and put us to bed for wetting our              pinafores at the pump.     It's very hard, and I'm sure the gardener's plants wouldn't grow any              better than ours,     If Nurse fetched him in and sent him to bed just when he was going to              water his flowers.     We've got Blue Nemophila and Mignonette, and Venus's Looking-glass,              and many other seeds;     The Nemophila comes up spotted, which is how we know it from the weeds.     At least it's sure to come up if the hens haven't scratched it up              first.     But when it is up the cats roll on it, and that is the worst!     I sowed a ring of sweet peas, and the last time I looked they were              coming nicely on,     Just sprouting white, and I put them safely back; but when Jack looked              he found they were gone.     Jack made a great many cuttings, but he has had rather bad luck,     I've looked at them every day myself, and not one of them has struck.     The gardener gave me a fine moss-rose, but Jack took it to his side,     I kept moving it back, but he took it again, and at last it died.     But now we've settled to dig up the path, and have the bed as it was              before,     So everything will belong to us both, and we shan't ever quarrel              any more.     It is such a long time, too, to wait for the sand, and perhaps              sea-sand does best on the shore.     We're going to take everything up, for it can't hurt the plants to              stand on the grass for a minute,     And you really can't possibly rake a bed smooth with so many              things in it.     We shall dig it all over, and get leaf-mould from the wood, and hoe              up the weeds,     And when it's tidy we shall plant, and put labels, and strike cuttings,              and sow seeds.     We are so fond of flowers, Jack and I often dream at night     Of getting up and finding our garden ablaze with all colours, blue,              red, yellow, and white.     And Midsummer's coming, and big brother Tom will sit under the tree     With his book, and Mary will beg sweet nosegays of Jack and me.     The worst is, we often start for the seaside about Midsummer Day,     And no one takes care of our gardens whilst we are away.     But if we sow lots of seeds, and take plenty of cuttings before we              leave home,     When we come back, our flowers will be all in full bloom,     Bright, bright sunshine above, and sweet, sweet flowers below.     Come, oh Midsummer, quickly come! and go quickly, Midsummer, go!      P.S. It is so tiresome! Jack wants to build a green-house now,     He has found some bits of broken glass, and an old window-frame, and              he says he knows how.     I tell him there's not glass enough, but he says there's lots,     And he's taken all the plants that belong to the bed and put              them in pots.         A FRIEND IN THE GARDEN.       He is not John the gardener,       And yet the whole day long     Employs himself most usefully,       The flower-beds among.      He is not Tom the pussy-cat,       And yet the other day,     With stealthy stride and glistening eye,       He crept upon his prey.      He is not Dash the dear old dog,       And yet, perhaps, if you     Took pains with him and petted him,       You'd come to love him too.      He's not a Blackbird, though he chirps,       And though he once was black;     And now he wears a loose grey coat,       All wrinkled on the back.      He's got a very dirty face,       And very shining eyes!     He sometimes comes and sits indoors;       He looks--and p'r'aps is--wise.      But in a sunny flower-bed       He has his fixed abode;     He eats the things that eat my plants--       He is a friendly TOAD.         [Illustration]      THREE LITTLE NEST BIRDS.
