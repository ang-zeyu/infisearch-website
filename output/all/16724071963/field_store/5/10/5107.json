It's surprising how hungry Zeppelin raids make one!  An extract from the account which appeared in _The Daily Chronicle_ the following morning was as follows:--  \"One bomb fell on Notre Dame Cathedral piercing the vault of one of the Chapels on the right transept and wreaking irreparable damage to the beautiful old glass of its gothic windows. This same bomb, which must have been of considerable size, sent débris flying into the courtyard of the Lamarcq Hospital full of Belgian wounded being tended by English Nurses.  \"Altogether these Yeomanry nurses behaved admirably, for all the menfolk with the exception of the doorkeeper\" (and Pierre, please), \"fled for refuge to the cellars, and the women were left. In the neighbourhood one hears nothing but praise of these courageous Englishwomen. Another bomb fell on a railway carriage in which a number of mechanics--refugees from Lille--were sleeping, as they had no homes of their own. The effect of the bomb on these unfortunate men was terrible. They were all more or less mutilated; and heads, hands, and feet were torn off. Then flames broke out on top of this carriage and in a moment the whole was one huge conflagration.  \"As the Zeppelin drew off, its occupants had the sinister satisfaction of leaving behind them a great glare which reddened the sky for a full hour in contrast with the total blackness of the town.\"  Chris took out \"Flossie,\" and was on the scene of this last disaster as soon as she could get into her clothes after being so roughly awakened by the splinters of glass.  When the day staff arrived from the \"Shop-window,\" what a sight met their eyes! The poor old place looked as if it had had a night of it, and as we sat down to breakfast in the kitchen we shivered in the icy blasts that blew in gusts across the room, for of course the weather had made up its mind to be decidedly wintry just to improve matters. It took weeks to get those windows repaired, as there was a run on what glaziers the town possessed. The next night our plight in typhoids was not one to be envied--Army blankets had been stretched inadequately across the windows and the beds pulled out of the way of draughts as much as possible, but do what we could the place was like an icehouse; the snow filtered softly through the flapping blankets, and how we cursed the Hun! At 3 a.m. one of the patients had a relapse and died.     CHAPTER VIII  CONCERNING BATHS, \"JOLIE ANNETTE,\" \"MARIE-MARGOT\" AND \"ST. INGLEVERT.\"   After this event I was sent back for a time to the _blessés graves_ on the surgical side on day duty. All who had been on duty that memorable night had had a pretty considerable shock. It was like leaving one world and stepping into another, so complete was the change from typhoids.  The faithful Jefké was still there stealing jam for the patients, spending a riotous Saturday night _au cinéma_, going to Mass next morning, and then presenting himself in the Ward again looking as if butter would not melt in his mouth!  A new assistant orderly was there as well. A pious looking individual in specs. He worked as if manual labour pained him, and was always studying out of a musty little book. He was desperately keen to learn English and spoke it on every possible occasion; was intensely stupid as an orderly and obstinate as a mule. He was trying in the extreme. One day he told me he was intended for higher things and would soon be a priest in the Church. Sister Lampen, who was so quick and thorough herself, found him particularly tiresome, and used to refer to him as her \"cross\" in life! One day she called him to account, and, in an exasperated voice said, \"What are you supposed to be doing here, Louis, anyway? Are you an orderly or aren't you?\" \"_Mees_,\" he replied piously, rolling his eyes upwards, \"I am learning to be a father!\" I gave a shriek of delight and hastened up to tea in the top room with the news.  We were continually having what was known as _alertes_, that the Germans were advancing on the town. We had boxes ready in all the Wards with a list on the lid indicating what particular dressings, etc., went in each. None of the _alertes_, however, materialized. We heard later it was only due to a Company of the gallant Buffs throwing themselves into the breach that the road to Calais had been saved.  There were several exciting days spent up at our Dressing Station at Hoogstadt, and one day to our delight we heard that three of the F.A.N.Y.'s, who had been in the trenches during a particularly bad bombardment, were to be presented with the Order of Leopold II. A daily paper giving an account of this dressing station headed it, in their enthusiasm, \"Ten days without a change of clothes. Brave Yeomanry Nurses!\"  It was a coveted job to post the letters and then go down to the Quay to watch the packet come in from England. The letters, by the way, were posted in the guard's van of a stationary train where Belgian soldiers sorted and despatched them. I used to wonder vaguely if the train rushed off in the night delivering them.  There was a charm and fascination about meeting that incoming boat; the rattle of chains, the clang as the gangway was fixed, the strange cries of the French sailors, the clicking of the bayonets as the cordon formed round the fussy passport officer, and lastly the excitement of watching to see if there was a spy on board. The _Walmer Castle_ and the _Canterbury_ were the two little packets employed, and they have certainly seen life since the war began. Great was our excitement if we caught sight of Field Marshal French on his way to G.H.Q., or King Albert, his tall form stooping slightly under the cares of State, as he stepped into his waiting car to be whirled northwards to _La Panne_.  The big Englishman (accompanied by a little man disguised in very plain clothes as a private Detective) also scanned every passenger closely as he stepped on French soil, and we turned away disgustedly as each was able to furnish the necessary proof that he was on lawful business. \"Come, Struttie, we must fly,\" and back we hurried over the bridge, past the lighthouse, across the Place d'Armes, up the Rue de la Rivière and so to Hospital once more.  When things became more settled, definite off times were arranged. Up to then sisters and nurses had worked practically all day and every day, so great was the rush. We experienced some difficulty in having baths, as there were none up at the \"Shop.\" Dr. Cools from the Gare Centrale told us some had been fitted in a train down there, and permission was obtained for us to use them. But first we were obliged to present ourselves to the Commandant (for the Railway shed there had been turned into an _Hôpital de Passage_, where the men waited on stretchers till they were collected each morning by ambulances for the different Hospitals), and ask him to be kind enough to furnish a _Bon pour un bain_ (a bath pass)! When I first went to the Bureau at the gare and saw this Commandant in his elegant tight-fitting navy blue uniform, with pointed grey beard and general air of importance, I felt that to ask him for a \"bath ticket\" was quite the last thing on earth! He saw my hesitation, and in the most natural manner in the world said with a bow, \"Mademoiselle has probably come for _un bon_?\" I assented gratefully, was handed the pass and fled. It requires some courage to face four officials in order to have a bath.  Arrived at the said train, one climbed up a step-ladder in to a truck divided into four partitions, and Ziské, a deaf old Flamand, carried buckets of boiling water from the engine and we added what cold we wanted ourselves. You will therefore see that when anyone asked you what you were doing in your free time that day and you said you were \"going to have a bath,\" it was understood that it meant the whole afternoon would be taken up.  At first we noticed the French people seemed a little stiff in their manner and rather on the defensive. We wondered for some time what could be the reason, and chatting one day with Madame at the dug-out I mentioned the fact to her.  \"See you, Mademoiselle, it is like this,\" she explained, \"you others, the English, had this town many years ago, and these unlettered ones, who read never the papers and know nothing, think you will take possession of the town once again.\" Needless to say in time this impression wore off and they became most friendly.  The Place d'Armes was a typical French marketplace and very picturesque. At one corner of the square stood the town hall with a turret and a very pretty Carillon called \"Jolie Annette,\" since smashed by a shell. I asked an old shopkeeper why the Carillon should be called by that name and he told me that in 1600 a well-to-do _commerçant_ of the town had built the turret and promised a Carillon only on the condition that it should be a line from a song sung by a fair lady called \"Jolie Annette,\" performing at a music hall or Café Chantant in the town at that time. The inhabitants protested, but he refused to give the Carillon unless he could have his own way, which he ultimately did. Can't you imagine the outraged feelings of the good burghers? \"_Que voulez-vous, Mademoiselle_,\" the old man continued, shrugging his shoulders, \"_Jolie Annette ne chante pas mal, hein?_\" and I agreed with him.  I thought it was rather a nice story, and I often wondered, when I heard that little song tinkling out, exactly what \"Jolie Annette\" really"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16523"],["title","The Kitáb-i-Aqdas (#0)"],["body","Kitáb-i-Aqdas   by Bahá’u’lláh     Edition 1, (June 21, 2005)                                 BAHA’I TERMS OF USE   You have permission to freely make and use copies of the text and any other information (\"Content\") available on this Site including printing, emailing, posting, distributing, copying, downloading, uploading, transmitting, displaying the Content in whole or in part subject to the following:  1.

The penalties for wounding or striking a person depend upon the    severity of the injury; for each degree the Lord of Judgement hath    prescribed a certain indemnity. # 56    82.
