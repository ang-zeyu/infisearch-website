If you say that matter is unconscious, you stultify my intellect, insult my conscience, and dispute self-evident facts; for nothing can be clearer than the testimony of the five senses.  _Good._ Spirit is the only substance. Spirit is God, and God is good; hence good is the only substance, the only Mind. Mind is not, cannot be, in matter. It sees, hears, feels, tastes, smells as Mind, and not as matter. Matter cannot talk; and hence, whatever it appears to say of itself is a lie. This lie, that Mind can be in matter,--claiming to be something beside God, denying Truth and its demonstration in Christian Science,--this lie I declare an illusion. This denial enlarges the human intellect by removing its evidence from sense to Soul, and from finiteness into infinity. It honors conscious human individuality by showing God as its source.  _Evil._ I am a creator,--but upon a material, not a spiritual basis. I give life, and I can destroy life.  _Good._ Evil is not a creator. God, good, is the only creator. Evil is not conscious or conscientious Mind; it is not individual, not actual. Evil is not spiritual, and therefore has no groundwork in Life, whose only source is Spirit. The elements which belong to the eternal All,--Life, Truth, Love,--evil can never take away.  _Evil._ I am intelligent matter; and matter is egoistic, having its own innate selfhood and the capacity to evolve mind. God is in matter, and matter reproduces God. From Him come my forms, near or remote. This is my honor, that God is my author, authority, governor, disposer. I am proud to be in His outstretched hands, and I shirk all responsibility for myself as evil, and for my varying manifestations.  _Good._ You mistake, O evil! God is not your authority and law. Neither is He the author of the material changes, the _phantasma_, a belief in which leads to such teaching as we find in the hymn-verse so often sung in church:--      Chance and change are busy ever,       Man decays and ages move;     But His mercy waneth never,--       God is wisdom, God is love.  Now if it be true that God's power _never waneth_, how can it be also true that _chance_ and _change_ are universal factors,--that _man decays_? Many ordinary Christians protest against this stanza of Bowring's, and its sentiment is foreign to Christian Science. If God be _changeless goodness_, as sings another line of this hymn, what place has _chance_ in the divine economy? Nay, there is in God naught fantastic. All is real, all is serious. The phantasmagoria is a product of human dreams.     The Ego   From various friends comes inquiry as to the meaning of a word employed in the foregoing colloquy.  There are two English words, often used as if they were synonyms, which really have a shade of difference between them.  An _egotist_ is one who talks much of himself. _Egotism_ implies vanity and self-conceit.  _Egoism_ is a more philosophical word, signifying a passionate love of self, which doubts all existence except its own. An _egoist_, therefore, is one uncertain of everything except his own existence.  Applying these distinctions to evil and God, we shall find that evil is _egotistic_,--boastful, but fleeing like a shadow at daybreak; while God is _egoistic_, knowing only His own all-presence, all-knowledge, all-power.     Soul   We read in the Hebrew Scriptures, \"The soul that sinneth, it shall die.\"  What is Soul? Is it a reality within the mortal body? Who can prove that? Anatomy has not descried nor described Soul. It was never touched by the scalpel nor cut with the dissecting-knife. The five physical senses do not cognize it.  Who, then, dares define Soul as something within man? As well might you declare some old castle to be peopled with demons or angels, though never a light or form was discerned therein, and not a spectre had ever been seen going in or coming out.  The common hypotheses about souls are even more vague than ordinary material conjectures, and have less basis; because material theories are built on the evidence of the material senses.  Soul must be God; since we learn Soul only as we learn God, by spiritualization. As the five senses take no cognizance of Soul, so they take no cognizance of God. Whatever cannot be taken in by mortal mind--by human reflection, reason, or belief--must be the unfathomable Mind, which \"eye hath not seen, nor ear heard.\" Soul stands in this relation to every hypothesis as to its human character.  If Soul sins, it is a sinner, and Jewish law condemned the sinner to death,--as does all criminal law, to a certain extent.  Spirit never sins, because Spirit is God. Hence, as Spirit, Soul is sinless, and is God. Therefore there is, there can be, no spiritual death.  Transcending the evidence of the material senses, Science declares God to be the Soul of all being, the only Mind and intelligence in the universe. There is but one God, one Soul, or Mind, and that one is infinite, supplying all that is absolutely immutable and eternal,--Truth, Life, Love.  Science reveals Soul as that which the senses cannot define from any standpoint of their own. What the physical senses miscall soul, Christian Science defines as material sense; and herein lies the discrepancy between the true Science of Soul and that material sense of a soul which that very sense declares can never be seen or measured or weighed or touched by physicality.  Often we can elucidate the deep meaning of the Scriptures by reading _sense_ instead of _soul_, as in the Forty-second Psalm: \"Why art thou cast down, O my soul [sense]?... Hope thou in God [Soul]: for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God [my Soul, immortality].\"  The Virgin-mother's sense being uplifted to behold Spirit as the sole origin of man, she exclaimed, \"My soul [spiritual sense] doth magnify the Lord.\"  Human language constantly uses the word _soul_ for _sense_. This it does under the delusion that the senses can reverse the spiritual facts of Science, whereas Science reverses the testimony of the material senses.  Soul is Life, and being spiritual Life, never sins. Material sense is the so-called material life. Hence this lower sense sins and suffers, according to material belief, till divine understanding takes away this belief and restores Soul, or spiritual Life. \"He restoreth my soul,\" says David.  In his first epistle to the Corinthians (xv. 45) Paul writes: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\" The apostle refers to the second Adam as the Messiah, our blessed Master, whose interpretation of God and His creation--by restoring the spiritual sense of man as immortal instead of mortal--made humanity victorious over death and the grave.  When I discovered the power of Spirit to break the cords of matter, through a change in the mortal sense of things, then I discerned the last Adam as a quickening Spirit, and understood the meaning of the declaration of Holy Writ, \"The first shall be last,\"--the living Soul shall be found a quickening Spirit; or, rather, shall reflect the Life of the divine Arbiter.     There is no Matter   \"God is a Spirit\" (or, more accurately translated, \"God is Spirit\"), declares the Scripture (John iv. 24), \"and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.\"  If God is Spirit, and God is All, surely there can be no matter; for the divine All must be Spirit.  The tendency of Christianity is to spiritualize thought and action. The demonstrations of Jesus annulled the claims of matter, and overruled laws material as emphatically as they annihilated sin.  According to Christian Science, the _first_ idolatrous claim of sin is, that matter exists; the _second_, that matter is substance; the _third_, that matter has intelligence; and the _fourth_, that matter, being so endowed, produces life and death.  Hence my conscientious position, in the denial of matter, rests on the fact that matter usurps the authority of God, Spirit; and the nature and character of matter, the antipode of Spirit, include all that denies and defies Spirit, in quantity or quality.  This subject can be enlarged. It can be shown, in detail, that evil does not obtain in Spirit, God; and that God, or good, is Spirit alone; whereas, evil _does_, according to belief, obtain in matter; and that evil is a false claim,--false to God, false to Truth and Life. Hence the claim of matter usurps the prerogative of God, saying, \"I am a creator. God made me, and I make man and the material universe.\"  Spirit is the only creator, and man, including the universe, is His spiritual concept. By matter is commonly meant mind,--not the highest Mind, but a false form of mind. This so-called mind and matter cannot be separated in origin and action.  What is this mind? It is not the Mind of Spirit; for spiritualization of thought destroys all sense of matter as substance, Life, or intelligence, and enthrones God in the eternal qualities of His being.  This lower, misnamed mind is a false claim, a suppositional mind, which I prefer to call _mortal mind_. True Mind is immortal. This mortal mind declares itself material, in sin, sickness, and death, virtually saying, \"I am the opposite of Spirit, of holiness, harmony, and Life.\"  To this declaration Christian Science responds, even as did our Master: \"You were a murderer from the beginning. The truth abode not in you. You are a liar, and the father of it.\" Here it appears that a _liar_ was in the neuter gender,--neither masculine nor feminine. Hence it was not man (the image of God) who lied, but the false claim to personality, which I call _mortal mind_; a claim which Christian Science uncovers, in order to demonstrate the falsity of the claim.  There are lesser arguments which prove matter to be identical with mortal mind, and this mind a lie.  The physical senses (matter really having no sense) give the only pretended"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16591"],["title","Unity of Good (#4)"],["body","there can be as to the existence of a substance called _matter_. Now these senses, being material, can only testify from their own evidence, and concerning themselves; yet we have it on divine authority: \"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.\" (John v. 31.)  In other words: matter testifies of itself, \"I am matter;\" but unless matter is mind, it cannot talk or testify; and if it is mind, it is certainly not the Mind of Christ, not the Mind that is identical with Truth.  Brain, thus assuming to testify, is only matter within the skull, and is believed to be mind only through error and delusion. Examine that form of matter called _brains_, and you find no mind therein. Hence the logical sequence, that there is in reality neither matter nor mortal mind, but that the self-testimony of the physical senses is false.  Examine these witnesses for error, or falsity, and observe the foundations of their testimony, and you will find them divided in evidence, mocking the Scripture (Matthew xviii. 16), \"In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.\"   _Sight._ Mortal mind declares that matter sees through the organizations of matter, or that mind sees by means of matter. Disorganize the so-called material structure, and then mortal mind says, \"I cannot see;\" and declares that matter is the master of mind, and that non-intelligence governs. Mortal mind admits that it sees only material images, pictured on the eye's retina.  What then is the line of the syllogism? It must be this: That matter is not seen; that mortal mind cannot see without matter; and therefore that the whole function of material sight is an illusion, a lie.  Here comes in the summary of the whole matter, wherewith we started: that God is All, and God is Spirit; therefore there is nothing but Spirit; and consequently there is no matter.   _Touch_. Take another train of reasoning. Mortal mind says that matter cannot feel matter; yet put your finger on a burning coal, and the nerves, material nerves, _do_ feel matter.  Again I ask: What evidence does mortal mind afford that matter is substantial, is hot or cold? Take away mortal mind, and matter could not feel what it calls _substance_. Take away matter, and mortal mind could not cognize its own so-called substance, and this so-called mind would have no identity. Nothing would remain to be seen or felt.  What is substance? What is the reality of God and the universe? Immortal Mind is the real substance,--Spirit, Life, Truth, and Love.  _Taste._ Mortal mind says, \"I taste; and this is sweet, this is sour.\" Let mortal mind change, and say that sour is sweet, and so it would be. If every mortal mind believed sweet to be sour, it would be so; for the qualities of matter are but qualities of mortal mind. Change the mind, and the quality changes. Destroy the belief, and the quality disappears.  The so-called material senses are found, upon examination, to be mortally mental, instead of material. Reduced to its proper denomination, matter is mortal mind; yet, strictly speaking, there is no mortal mind, for Mind is immortal, and is not matter, but Spirit.  _Force._ What is gravitation? Mortal mind says gravitation is a material power, or force. I ask, Which was first, matter or power? That which was first was God, immortal Mind, the Parent of _all_. But God is Truth, and the forces of Truth are moral and spiritual, not physical. They are not the merciless forces of matter. What then _are_ the so-called forces of matter? They are the phenomena of mortal mind, and matter and mortal mind are one; and this one is a misstatement of Mind, God.  A molecule, as matter, is not formed by Spirit; for Spirit is _spiritual_ consciousness alone. Hence this spiritual consciousness can form nothing unlike itself, Spirit, and Spirit is the only creator. The material atom is an outlined falsity of consciousness, which can gather additional evidence of consciousness and life only as it adds lie to lie. This process it names material attraction, and endows with the double capacity of creator and creation.  From the beginning this lie was the false witness against the fact that Spirit is All, beside which there is no other existence. The use of a lie is that it unwittingly confirms Truth, when handled by Christian Science, which reverses false testimony and gains a knowledge of God from opposite facts, or phenomena.  This whole subject is met and solved by Christian Science according to Scripture. Thus we see that Spirit is Truth and eternal reality; that matter is the opposite of Spirit,--referred to in the New Testament as the flesh at war with Spirit; hence, that matter is erroneous, transitory, unreal.  A further proof of this is the demonstration, according to Christian Science, that by the reduction and the rejection of the claims of matter (instead of acquiescence therein) man is improved physically, mentally, morally, spiritually.  To deny the existence or reality of matter, and yet admit the reality of moral evil, sin, or to say that the divine Mind is conscious of evil, yet is not conscious of matter, is erroneous. This error stultifies the logic of divine Science, and must interfere with its practical demonstration.     Is There no Death?   Jesus not only declared himself \"the way\" and \"the truth,\" but also \"the life.\" God is Life; and as there is but one God, there can be but one Life. Must man die, then, in order to inherit eternal life and enter heaven?  Our Master said, \"The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" Then God and heaven, or Life, are present, and death is not the real stepping-stone to Life and happiness. They are now and here; and a change in human consciousness, from sin to holiness, would reveal this wonder of being. Because God is ever present, no boundary of time can separate us from Him and the heaven of His presence; and because God is Life, all Life is eternal.  Is it unchristian to believe there is no death? Not unless it be a sin to believe that God is Life and All-in-all. Evil and disease do not testify of Life and God.  Human beings are physically mortal, but spiritually immortal. The evil accompanying physical personality is illusive and mortal; but the good attendant upon spiritual individuality is immortal. Existing here and now, this unseen individuality is real and eternal. The so-called material senses, and the mortal mind which is misnamed _man_, take no cognizance of spiritual individuality, which manifests immortality, whose Principle is God.  To God alone belong the indisputable realities of being. Death is a contradiction of Life, or God; therefore it is not in accordance with His law, but antagonistic thereto.  Death, then, is error, opposed to Truth,--even the unreality of mortal mind, not the reality of that Mind which is Life. Error has no life, and is virtually without existence. Life is real; and all is real which proceeds from Life and is inseparable from it.  It is unchristian to believe in the transition called _material death_, since matter has no life, and such misbelief must enthrone another power, an imaginary life, above the living and true God. A material sense of life robs God, by declaring that not He alone is Life, but that something else also is life,--thus affirming the existence and rulership of more gods than one. This idolatrous and false sense of life is all that dies, or appears to die.  The opposite understanding of God brings to light Life and immortality. Death has no quality of Life; and no divine fiat commands us to believe in aught which is unlike God, or to deny that He is Life eternal.  Life as God, moral and spiritual good, is not seen in the mineral, vegetable, or animal kingdoms. Hence the inevitable conclusion that Life is not in these kingdoms, and that the popular views to this effect are not up to the Christian standard of Life, or equal to the reality of being, whose Principle is God.  When \"the Word\" is \"made flesh\" among mortals, the Truth of Life is rendered practical on the body. Eternal Life is partially understood; and sickness, sin, and death yield to holiness, health, and Life,--that is, to God. The lust of the flesh and the pride of physical life must be quenched in the divine essence,--that omnipotent Love which annihilates hate, that Life which knows no death.  \"Who hath believed our report?\" Who understands these sayings? He to whom the arm of the Lord is revealed. He loves them from whom divine Science removes human weakness by divine strength, and who unveil the Messiah, whose name is Wonderful.  Man has no underived power. That selfhood is false which opposes itself to God, claims another father, and denies spiritual sonship; but as many as receive the knowledge of God in Science must reflect, in some degree, the power of Him who gave and giveth man dominion over all the earth.  As soldiers of the cross we must be brave, and let Science declare the immortal status of man, and deny the evidence of the material senses, which testify that man dies.  As the image of God, or Life, man forever reflects and embodies Life, not death. The material senses testify falsely. They presuppose that God is good and that man is evil, that Deity is deathless, but that man dies, losing the divine likeness.  Science and material sense conflict at all points, from the revolution of the earth to the fall of a sparrow. It is mortality only that dies.  To say that you and I, as mortals, will not enter this dark shadow of material sense, called _death_, is to assert what we have not proved; but man in Science never dies. Material sense, or the belief of life in matter, must perish, in order to prove man deathless.  As Truth supersedes error, and bears the fruits of Love, this understanding of Truth subordinates the belief in death, and demonstrates Life as imperative in the divine order of being.  Jesus declares that they who believe his sayings will never die; therefore mortals can no more receive everlasting life by "]]]
