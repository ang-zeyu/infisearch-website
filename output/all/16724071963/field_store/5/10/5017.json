I shall feel quite brave about her being here, when I am safely hidden in the long grass!\"  \"Is there any possible chance that you will get back sooner than you think, Ronnie?\"  \"Hardly. Not before November, anyway. And yesterday my publishers were keen that I should put in a night at Leipzig on my way home, and a night at the Hague; show whatever 'copy' I have to firms there, and make arrangements for German and Dutch translations to appear as soon as possible after the English edition is out. I think I may as well do this, and return by the Hook of Holland. I enjoy the night-crossing, and like reaching London early in the morning. By the way, haven't you a cousin of some sort living at Leipzig?\"  \"Yes; my first cousin, Aubrey Treherne. He is studying music, and working on compositions of his own, I believe. He lives in a flat in the Grassi Strasse.\"  \"All right. Put his address in my pocket-book. I will look him up. My special chum, Dick Cameron, is to be out there in November, investigating one of their queer water-cures. I wish you knew Dick Cameron, Helen. I shall hope to see him, too. Has your cousin a spare room in his flat?\"  \"I do not know. Ronnie, Aubrey Treherne is not a good man. He is not a man you should trust.\"  \"Darling, you don't necessarily trust a fellow because he puts you up for the night. But I daresay Dick will find me a room.\"  \"Aubrey is not a good man,\" repeated Helen firmly.  \"Dear, we are none of us good.\"  \"_You_ are, Ronnie--in the sense I mean, or I should not have married you.\"  \"Oh, then, yes _please_!\" said Ronnie. \"I am very, very good!\"  He laughed up at her, but Helen's face was grave. Then a sudden thought brightened it.  \"If you really go to Leipzig, Ronnie, could you look in at Zimmermann's--a first-rate place for musical instruments of all kinds--and choose me a small organ for the new church? I saw a little beauty the other day at Huntingford; a perfect tone, twelve stops, and quite easy to play. They had had it sent over from Leipzig. It cost only twenty-four pounds. In England, one could hardly have bought so good an instrument for less than forty. If you could choose one with a really sweet tone, and have it shipped over here, I should be grateful.\"  \"With pleasure, darling. I enjoy trying all sorts of instruments. But why economise over the organ? If my wife fancied a hundred guinea organ, I could give it her.\"  \"No, you couldn't, Ronnie. You must not be extravagant.\"  \"I am not extravagant, dear. Buying things one can afford is not extravagance.\"  \"Sometimes it is. Extravagance is not spending money. But it is paying a higher price for a thing than the actual need demands, or than the circumstances justify. I considered you extravagant last winter when you paid five guineas for a box at Olympia, intended to hold eight people, and sat in it, in solitary grandeur, alone with your wife.\"  \"I know you did,\" said Ronnie. \"You left me no possible loop-hole for doubt in the matter. But your quite mistaken view, on that occasion, arose from an incorrect estimate of values. I paid one pound, six shillings and three-pence for the two seats, and three pounds, eighteen and nine-pence for the pleasure of sitting alone with my wife, and thought it cheap at that. It was a far lower price than the actual need demanded; therefore, by your own showing, it was not extravagant.\"  \"Oh, what a boy it is!\" sighed Helen, with a little gesture of despair. \"Then, last Christmas, Ronnie, you insisted upon fêting the old people with all kinds of unnecessary luxuries. They had always been quite content with wholesome bread-and-butter, plum cake, and nice hot tea. They did not require _pâté de foie gras_ and champagne, nor did they understand or really enjoy them. One old lady, in considerable distress, confided to me the fact that the champagne tasted to her 'like physic with a fizzle in it.' It made most of them ill, Ronnie, and cost at least eight times as much as my simple Christmas parties of other years. So don't go and spend an unnecessary sum on an elaborate, and probably less useful, instrument. I will write you full particulars when the time comes. Oh, Ronnie, you will be so nearly home, by then! How shall I wait?\"  \"I shall love to feel I have something to do for you in Leipzig,\" said Ronnie; \"and I enjoy poking about among crowds of queer instruments. I should like to have played in Nebuchadnezzar's band. I should have played the sackbut, because I haven't the faintest notion how you work the thing--whether you blow into it, or pull it in and out, or tread upon it; nor what manner of surprising sound it emits, when you do any or all of these things. I love springing surprises on myself and on other people; and I know I do best the things which, if I considered the matter beforehand, I shouldn't have the veriest ghost of a notion how to set about doing. That, darling, is inspiration! I should have played the sackbut by inspiration; whereupon Nebuchadnezzar would instantly have had me cast into the burning fiery furnace.\"  \"Oh, Ronnie, I wish I could laugh! But to-morrow is so near. What shall I do when there is nobody here to tell me silly stories?\"  \"Ask Mademoiselle Victorine to try her hand at it. Say: 'Chère Mademoiselle, s'il-vous-plait, racontez-moi une extrêmement sotte histoire.'\"  \"Ronnie, do stop chaffing! Go and play me something really beautiful, and sing very softly, as you did the other night; so that I can hear the tones of the piano and your voice vibrating together.\"  \"No,\" said Ronnie, \"I can't. I have a cast-iron lump in my throat just now, and not a note could pass it. Besides, I don't really play the piano.\"  He stretched out his foot, and kicked a log into the fire.  The flame shot up, illumining the room. The log-fire, and the two seated near it, were reflected fitfully in the distant mirror.  \"Helen, there is one instrument, above all others, which I have always longed to play; yet I have never even held one in my hand.\"  \"What instrument is that, darling?\"  \"The violoncello,\" said Ronnie, sitting up and turning towards her as he spoke. \"When I think of a 'cello I seem as if I know exactly how it would feel to hold it between my knees, press my fingers up and down the yielding strings, and draw the bow across them. Helen--if I had a 'cello here to-night, you would listen to sounds of such exquisite throbbing beauty, that you would forget everything in this world, my wife, excepting that I love you.\"  His eyes shone in the firelight. An older look of deeper strength and of fuller manly vigour came into his face. The glow of love transfigured it.  With an uncontrollable sob, Helen stooped and laid her lips on his.  The clock struck midnight.  \"Oh, Ronnie,\" she said; \"oh, Ronnie! It is _to-day_, now! No longer to-morrow--but to-day!\"  He sprang to his feet, took her hand, and drew her to the door.  \"Come, Helen,\" he said.     Part II     CHAPTER V  THE INFANT OF PRAGUE   Two men, in a flat at Leipzig, sat on either side of a tall porcelain stove.  The small door in the stove stood open, letting a ruddy glow shine from within, a poor substitute for the open fires blazing merrily in England on this chill November evening; yet giving visible evidence of the heat contained within those cool-looking blue and white embossed tiles.  The room itself was a curious mixture of the taste of the Leipzig landlady, who owned and had furnished it, and of the Englishman studying music, who was its temporary tenant.  The high-backed sofa, upholstered in red velvet, stood stiffly against the wall, awaiting the \"guest of honour,\" who never arrived. It served, however, as a resting-place for a violin, and a pile of music; while, on the opposite side of the room, partly eclipsing a fancy picture of Goethe, stood a chamber organ, open, and displaying a long row of varied stops.  Books and music were piled upon every available flat space, saving the table; upon which lay the remains of supper.  Of the three easy chairs placed in a semi-circle near the stove, two were occupied; but against the empty chair in the centre, its dark brown polished surface reflecting the glow of the fire, leaned a beautiful old violoncello. The metal point of its foot made a slight dent in the parquet floor.  The younger of the two men sat well forward, elbows on knees, eyes alight with excitement, intently gazing at the 'cello.  The other lay back in his chair, his thin sensitive fingers carefully placed tip to tip, his deep-set eyes scrutinising his companion. When he spoke his voice was calm and deliberate, his manner exceedingly quiet. His method of conversation was of the kind which drew out the full confidence of others, while at the same time carefully insinuating, rather than frankly expressing, ideas of his own.  \"What a rum fellow you must be, West, to pay a hundred and fifty pounds for an instrument you have no notion of playing. Is it destined to be kept under lock and key in a glass case?\"  \"Certainly not,\" said Ronald West. \"I shall be able to play it when I try; and I shall try as soon as I get home.\"  \"Give us a sample here.\"  \"No, not here. I particularly wish to play it first with Helen, in the room where I told her a 'cello was the instrument I had always wanted. Oh, I say, isn't it a beauty! Look at those curves, and that wonderful polish, like the richest brown of the very darkest horse-chestnut you ever saw in a bursting bur! See how the silver strings shine in the firelight, against the black ebony of the finger-board! It was made at Prague, and it is a hundred and fifty years old. I call it the Infant of Prague.\"  \"Why the 'Infant'?\"  \"Because you have to be so careful not to bump its head as you carry it about. Also, isn't there a verse somewhere, about an Infant of Days who was a hundred years old, and young at that? Helen will love the Infant. She will polish it with a silk handkerchief, and make a bed for it on the sofa! I shan't write to her about it. I shall bring it home "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16454"],["title","The Upas Tree: A Christmas Story for all the Year (#5)"],["body","a surprise.\"  He took his eyes from the 'cello and looked across at Helen's cousin; but Aubrey Treherne instantly shifted his gaze to the unconscious Infant.  \"Tell me how you came across it. There is no doubt you have been fortunate enough to pick up an instrument of extraordinary value and beauty.\"  \"Ah, you realise that?\" cried Ronald. \"Good! Well, you shall hear exactly what happened. I arrived here early this morning, put up at a hotel, and sallied out to interview the publishers. I had a mass of 'copy' to show them, because I have been writing incessantly the whole way home. Curiously enough, since I left Africa, I have scarcely needed any sleep. Snatches of half an hour seem all I require. It is convenient when one has a vast amount of work to get through in a short space of time.\"  \"Very convenient. Just the reverse of the sleeping sickness.\"  \"Rather! I was never fitter in my life--as I told Dick Cameron.\"  Aubrey Treherne glanced at the bright burning eyes and flushed face--the feverish blood showing, even through the tan of Africa.  \"Yes, you look jolly fit,\" he said. \"Who is Dick Cameron?\"  \"A great chum of mine. We met, as boys in Edinburgh, and were at school together. He is the son of Colonel Cameron of Transvaal fame, killed while leading a charge. Dick has done awfully well in the medical, passed all necessary exams, and taken every possible degree. He is now looking out for a practice, and meanwhile a big man in London has sent him out to investigate one of these queer water friction cures--professes to cure cataract and cancer and every known disease, by simply sitting you in a tub, and rubbing you down with a dish-cloth. Dick Cameron says--Hullo! Why are we talking of Dick Cameron? I thought I was telling you about the 'cello.\"  \"You are telling me about the 'cello,\" said Aubrey, quietly. \"But in order to arrive at the 'cello we had to hear about your visit to the publishers with your mass of manuscript, which resulted from having acquired in Central Africa the useful habit of not needing more than half an hour of sleep in the twenty-four; which, possibly, Dick Cameron did not consider sufficient. Doctors are apt to be faddy in such matters. Whereupon you, naturally, told him you were perfectly fit.\"  \"Ah, yes, I remember,\" said Ronnie. \"Am I spinning rather a yarn?\"  \"Not at all, my dear fellow. Do not hurry. We have the whole evening before us--night, if necessary. You can put in your half-hour at any time, I suppose; and I can dispense with sleep for once. It is not often one has the chance of spending a night in the company of a noted author, an African traveller straight from the jungle, and the man who has married one's favourite cousin. I am all delighted attention. What did your friend Dick Cameron say?\"  \"Well, I met him as I was hurrying back to the hotel, carrying the Infant, who did not appear to advantage in the exceedingly plain brown canvas bag which was all they could give me at Zimmermann's. When I get home I shall consult Helen, and we shall order the best case procurable.\"  \"Naturally. Probably Helen will advise a bassinet by night, and a perambulator by day.\"  Ronnie looked perplexed. \"Why a bassinet?\" he said.  \"The _Infant_, you know.\"  \"Oh--ah, yes, I see. Well, of course I wanted to introduce the Infant properly to Dick Cameron, but he objected when I began taking it out of its bag in the street. He suggested that it might take cold--it certainly is a dank day. Also that there are so many by-laws and regulations in Leipzig connected with things you may not do in the streets, that probably if you took a 'cello out of its case and stood admiring it in the midst of the crowded thoroughfare, you would get run in by a policeman. Dick said: 'Arrest of the Infant of Prague in the Streets of Leipzig' would make just the kind of sensational headline beloved by newspapers. I realised that he was right. It would have distressed Helen, besides being a most unfortunate way for her to hear first of the Infant. Helen is a great stickler for respectability.\"  Aubrey Treherne's pale countenance turned a shade paler. His thin lips curved into the semblance of a smile.  \"Ah, yes,\" he said, \"of course. Helen is a great stickler for respectability. Well? So you gave up undressing your Infant in the street?\"  Again Ronnie's eager face took on a look of perplexity.  \"I did not propose undressing it,\" he said.  \"I only wanted to take it out of its bag.\"  \"I see. Quite a simple matter. Well? Owing to our absurd police regulations you were prevented from doing this. What happened next?\"  \"Dick suggested that we should go to his rooms. Arrived there he ceased to take any interest in my 'cello, clapped me into a chair, and stuck a beastly thermometer into my mouth.\"  \"Doctors are such enthusiasts,\" murmured Aubrey Treherne. \"They can never let their own particular trade alone. I suppose he also felt your pulse and looked at your tongue.\"  \"Rather! Then he said I had no business to be walking about with a temperature of 103. I was so much annoyed that I promptly smashed the thermometer, and we had a fine chase after the quicksilver. You never saw anything like it! It ran like a rabbit, in and out of the nooks and corners of the chair, until at last it disappeared through a crack in the floor; went to ground, you know. Doesn't Helen look well on horseback?\"  \"Charming. I suppose you easily convinced your friend that his diagnosis was rubbish?\"  \"Of course I did. I told him I had never felt better in my life. But I drank the stuff he gave me, simply to save further bother; also another dose which he brought to the hotel. Then he insisted on leaving a bottle out of which I am to take a dose every three hours on the journey home. I did not know old Dick was such a crank.\"  \"Probably it is the result of sitting in a tub and being scrubbed with a dish-cloth. Did he know you were coming here?\"  \"Yes; he picked up my pocket-book, found your address, and made a note of it. He said he should probably look us up at about ten o'clock this evening. I told him I might be here pretty late. I did not know you were going to be so kind as to fetch my things from the hotel and put me up. You really are most--\"  \"Delighted, my dear fellow. Honoured!\" said Aubrey Treherne. \"Now tell me about the finding of the 'cello.\"  \"I interviewed the publishers, and I hope it is all right. But they seemed rather hurried and vague, and anxious to get me off the premises. No doubt I shall fare better in courteous little Holland. Then I went on to Zimmermann's to choose Helen's organ. I found exactly what she wanted, and at the price she wished. On my way downstairs I found myself in a large room full of violoncellos--dozens of them. They were hanging in glass cases; they were ranged along the top. Then I suddenly felt impelled to look to the top of the highest cabinet, and there I saw the Infant! I knew instantly that that was the 'cello I _must_ have. It seemed mine already. It seemed as if it always had been mine. I asked to be shown some violoncellos. They produced two or three, in which I took no interest. Then I said: 'Get down that dark brown one, third from the end.' They lifted it down, and, from the moment I touched it, I knew it must be mine! They told me it was made at Prague, a hundred and fifty years ago, and its price was three thousand marks. Luckily, I had my cheque-book in my pocket, also my card, Helen's card, my publisher's letter of introduction to the firm here, and my own letter of credit from my bankers. So they expressed themselves willing to take my cheque. I wrote it then and there, and marched out with the Infant. I first called it the Infant on the stairs, as we were leaving Zimmermann's, because I almost bumped its head! Isn't it a beauty?\"  \"Undoubtedly it is.\"  \"They put on a new set of the very best strings,\" continued Ronnie; \"supplied me with a good bow, and threw in a cake of rosin.\"  \"What did you pay for the organ?\" inquired Aubrey Treherne.  \"Twenty-four pounds. Helen would not have a more expensive one. She is always telling me not to be extravagant.\"  \"That, my dear boy, invariably happens to an impecunious fellow who marries a rich wife.\"  Ronnie flushed. \"I am impecunious no longer,\" he said. \"During the past twelve months I have made, by my books, a larger income than my wife's.\"  \"I can well believe it,\" said Aubrey, cordially. \"But I suppose she can never forget the fact that, when you married her, she paid your debts.\"  Ronald West sprang to his feet.  \"Confound you!\" he said, violently. \"What do you mean? Helen never paid my debts! She found them out, I admit; but I paid them every one myself, with the first cheque I received from my publishers. I demand an explanation of your statement.\"  The other two members of the trio round the stove appeared completely unmoved by the fury of the young man who had leapt to his feet. The Infant of Prague leaned calmly against its chair, reflecting the fire in its polished surface, and pressing its one sharp foot into the parquet. Aubrey smiled, deprecatingly, and waved Ronnie back to his seat.  \"My dear fellow, I am sure I beg your pardon. My cousin certainly gave her family to understand that she had paid your debts. No doubt this was not the case. We all know that women are somewhat given to exaggeration and inaccuracy. Think no more of it.\"  Ronnie sat down moodily in his chair.  \"It was unlike Helen,\" he said, \"and it was a lie. I shall find out with whom it originated. But you are a good fellow to take my word about it at once. I am obliged to you, Treherne.\"  \"Don't mention it, West. Men rarely lie to one another. On the other hand women rarely speak the truth. What will my good cousin say to one hundred and fifty pounds being paid for a 'cello?\"  \"It will be no business of hers,\" said Ronnie, angrily. \"I can do as I choose with my own earnings.\"  \"I doubt it,\" smiled Aubrey Treherne.  \"The man who married my cousin Helen, was bound to "]]]
