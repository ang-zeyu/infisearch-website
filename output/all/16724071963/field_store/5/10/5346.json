Wharton stretched out on the deck, falling asleep almost immediately, and Jack thus found himself the only one with his senses at command and with the safety of the others dependent upon him.  He took his place near the cabin, where the women were slumbering, with his breechloader in hand.  He was never more wide awake and was sure he would remain so for hours to come.  Wharton had offered to divide the duty with him in acting as sentinel, but our hero preferred to keep the matter in his own hands.  He was sure his friend did not realize the full peril of their situation.  The stillness was broken only by the peculiar cries in the jungle, which it may be said were never wholly silent.  First on the right, then on the left, then from the front, and again from different points on both sides of the stream he heard the sounds, some faint and far away, with others alarmingly close.  The hoarse snarl of the tiger, the finer cry of the leopard, the squawking of night birds, with other noises that he could not identify, were continually in the air.  Had they been heard for the first time he would have been in a tremor of fear and nervousness; but man soon becomes accustomed to danger, and the nearest must come still nearer to cause his pulse an additional throb.  Jack Everson was sensible that through this medley of strange noises there was one sound that was continuous and never changing.  So faint that at first he and Wharton failed to notice it, it now impressed itself too distinctly upon his consciousness for him to be mistaken. It was a low, steady hum or moaning, such as the traveller hears when miles inland from the ocean.  He could not identify it, though he made several guesses, and was still speculating unsatisfactorily, when he received a startling reminder that there was a new peril at his very feet.  The first notice was a faint purring sound, as if made by a gigantic cat, accompanied by a rustling of the vegetation scarcely a dozen feet away.  He instantly grasped his rifle with both hands and was alert. It was impossible to distinguish ordinary objects in the gloom, but suddenly two small circles glittered with a greenish light and the purring was succeeded by a low, cavernous growl.  Then it all became clear to him: a royal Bengal tiger was stealing upon the boat and was probably gathering himself for a leap at that very moment.  Had all the occupants been asleep the frightful terror would have played sad havoc with them before they could defend themselves.  As it was, it looked as if more than one fatality must follow his attack.  But for that phosphorescent gleam of the brute's eyes Jack Everson would not have been able to locate him, but the glow of the two objects defined the outlines and locality of the horrible thing as unmistakably as if the sun were overhead.  The occasion was one in which everything depended upon promptness.  The tiger was likely to shift his position and turn his head so that the eyes would fail to show.  Jack reflected that there probably were a number of spots in the anatomy of the jungle terror that were more vulnerable than others; that a well-aimed bullet might be instantly fatal in one, while able to inflict only a partial wound in another.  Be that as it may, he was sure that a conical bullet driven between the eyes and through bone, muscle and brain by a rifle that could kill a man at the distance of a mile must do effective work when that brain was not a dozen feet distant from the muzzle of the weapon.  At any rate, there was no time for inquiry and he did not hesitate.  Aiming for a point midway between the gleaming orbs he pressed the trigger.  It takes a well-aimed weapon to kill a royal Bengal tiger, even at a short distance, but Jack's rifle was well aimed.  The tiny sphere of lead darted through the brain and along the spinal marrow as if fired with the vicious energy of a charge of dynamite.  It so happened that the tiger was in the act of making his graceful but fearful leap that was to land him upon the breast of the young man, who had risen to his feet just before firing.  The check at that instant produced a queer result, the like of which is not often seen.  The shock of the bullet crashing into the head of the muscular beast at the instant he was calling into play his prodigious strength intensified that strength to a sudden and astonishing degree.  The consequence was that the tiger, instead of making the leap he intended, made one twice as great and overshot the mark.  From out the gloom the beautiful sinewy body, of which only a glimpse could be caught, emerged as if fired from the throat of a Columbiad and, curving over the shoulders of the man and the boat, dropped into the stream with a splash that sent the water flying in every direction.  Beyond the line of shadow, where the faint moonlight fell upon him, the tiger was seen to be a beast of extraordinary size.  He emitted one rasping snarl while sailing through the air, but was already dead when he fell into the water, where it could not be seen he had made a struggle.  The sinewy body dipped out of sight, bobbed up again and the next minute was swept beyond view by the rapid current.  Rather strangely, not one of the women was awakened by the report of the rifle so near them, and of the men Dr. Marlowe and Anderson were the only ones who rose to a sitting posture and anxiously inquired the cause of the firing.  \"I discovered an animal prowling near the boat,\" replied Jack, who thought it well not to disturb them with the whole truth, \"and I winged him.\"  \"You are sure you killed him?\" asked the doctor; \"most likely it was a tiger.\"  \"I am quite sure of that, and am just as sure that, considered strictly as a tiger, he is of no further account.  I made another bull's-eye in his case.\"  \"How many is that?\" asked the physician, entering into the spirit of the jest.  \"My fifth, counting only those that I am sure of.\"  \"You are doing well; keep it up; let the good work go on,\" replied the elder, again adjusting himself for slumber, quite content to leave the valiant young American in charge of the boat and its occupants.  Jack had it in mind to question him about that distant murmuring sound that puzzled him, but when ready to do so he discovered that the doctor was again asleep and he did not disturb him.  The fact that one denizen of the jungle had paid the boat a visit was ground for looking for a call from another.  Jack remained, therefore, on the alert, and though under ordinary circumstances he would have fallen asleep he kept wide awake until the growing light in the sky told of the coming day.  Before the sun was fairly above the horizon all were astir.  They bathed faces and hands in the roiled water and greeted one another with thankfulness that the night had passed without harm to any member of the little company.  When the three men and their wives fled from Meerut they took with them enough food to last for several days.  There is little excuse for people dying of starvation in any part of India, though sad to say it is only recently that thousands were swept away by famine.  Fruit is abundant and little meat is necessary in hot countries.  Before the morning meal was partaken of Jack Everson asked Dr. Marlowe to explain the cause of the low moaning noise that had been in his ears for moat of the night.  The elder listened for a minute and replied:  \"What I expected!  We are very near the head of navigation; that sound comes from falls or rapids, above which we cannot go with this boat.\"  This announcement precipitated a discussion as to what was the best course to follow.  The physician left no doubt of his sentiments.  \"The devils will be prowling up this stream within a few hours; I should not be surprised if they are near us this moment; the boat is of no further use to us.\"  The three, Anderson, Turner and Wharton, did not agree with him.  The craft had served them so well that they were unwilling to abandon it. They seemed to believe that it offered a much safer means of defense than they could find anywhere on land.  \"But you cannot stay forever on it,\" protested the doctor impatiently.  \"We do not expect to,\" replied Anderson; \"we may decide to descend to the Ganges again, and continue down the river.\"  \"Whither?\"  \"To Cawnpore or some point nearer.\"  The doctor was aghast.  \"You mean to leap straight into the hornet's nest; those are the places, of all others, that must be avoided.\"  \"It may be as you say, but I am hopeful that the English garrisons have been able to hold out against the mutineers.\"  \"It is a woeful mistake, my friend; if you persist in it we must part company.\"     CHAPTER XIV.  THE SOUND OF FIRING.  Jack Everson was hardly less impatient than the doctor over the obstinacy of their lately made friends.  He reminded them that the physician had spent a score of years in that part of the world, with which he was so familiar that his judgment ought to outweigh theirs, but the argument was useless.  They had decided to stick to the boat that had served them so well and could not be dissuaded.  Their plan, as they had intimated, now that they found they could go little further up stream, was to descend to the Ganges, with a view of working their way down to some of the cities, where they hoped to find the English had succeeded in holding out against the mutineers.  Could this be done, and could such a haven be reached, all would be well, but the doctor assured them they were leaning upon a broken reed. When it became evident that all persuasions were useless the parties separated.  A common peril had brought them near to one another and it was impossible that that they should part except as friends.  All felt the solemnity of the hour.  Each wife kissed and embraced Mary Marlowe,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16805"],["title","The Jungle Fugitives: A Tale of Life and Adventure in India (#8)"],["body"," and like her shed tears at what they felt was probably the final parting, so far as this world was concerned.  The men warmly shook hands and there was more than one tremulous voice when the three passed over the side of the boat and said farewell.  The latter walked some distance through the jungle, which was so dense that they were obliged to follow one of the numerous paths made by the animals in going to and coming from the water.  The doctor, by virtue of his superior knowledge, took the lead, with his daughter close behind, and Jack Everson bringing up the rear.  They were silent and thoughtful, for their spirits were oppressed by a deep gloom and the feeling that something dreadful impended.  Not far off the path which they were following expanded into a natural clearing two or three rods in extent.  When they reached the spot the doctor halted and faced his companions.  \"I now know where we are,\" he said in an undertone; \"we have to follow this path a little way back, when we enter a hilly and rough country, where the jungle is more open.  It is cut up by numerous trails like this, most of which have been made by the feet of wild animals, but one of them leads northward and finally enters a highway, which if followed far enough will land us in the Nepaul country.\"  \"I assume from what you have said that it will not be safe to stick to this road?\" said Jack.  \"No; for two or three days while travelling over it we shall be in constant danger; our task will be to make our way over it without attracting the notice of any of our enemies who are scouring the country for us.\"  \"Is the thing possible?\"  \"I should not undertake it did I not think so; the danger will threaten for probably a hundred miles, though growing steadily less as we proceed.\"  \"Will it not be safer to do our travelling by night?\" asked the daughter.  \"That is what I mean to do after reaching the more plainly marked path, which connects with the highway.  I see no risk in pushing through the jungle by day, since the only foes we are likely to encounter are four-footed ones.  If we meet any such we must refrain from firing, since the reports of our guns will be sure to draw attention to us.  I mean, of course,\" explained the doctor, \"that our weapons are not to be appealed to unless there is no escape otherwise, as was the case with the tiger.\"  While he was speaking, Mary gave a faint gasp and caught his arm.  She and Jack were facing the point toward which his back was turned. Seeing that it was something behind him that had startled both, the doctor turned his head.  As if to emphasize the words just spoken, he saw an immense spotted leopard, motionless in the trail not more than fifty feet away.  Evidently he was trotting to the stream, when he caught sight of the three persons, stopped short, raised his head and stared wonderingly at them.  The leopard shares the reputation of the tiger for deadly ferocity and daring.  When more than 20,000 persons are killed in India every year by wild animals and serpents, it will be found that the leopard is one of the most active among these factors of death, and holds his own well up with the tiger.  Like the venomous serpent, the leopard had a terrible beauty all his own.  As he stood with head raised, eyes glaring, mouth slightly parted and his long tail lashing his sides with a force that made the thumping against his glossy ribs plainly audible, his pose was perfect.  What a picture he made!  The question that was to be quickly answered was whether the fearful brute would allow himself to be turned aside from the path and withdraw again into the jungle with his thirst unslaked.  If he did he would not be molested; if he presumed to advance upon the party, whom he evidently held in slight fear, let him be prepared for the consequences!  Jack Everson fumbled his rifle and looked with sparkling eyes at the beast.  \"What a chance for another bull's-eye!\" he said, in a low voice.  \"I would take him right between and above his forelegs, where I should be sure of reaching his heart.\"  \"Don't fire unless he advances to attack us,\" warned the elder.  It would be hard to say what induced the leopard to retreat, for, as has been said, he is one of the most dangerous denizens of the jungle; but, while our friends were expecting a charge from him, he wheeled about and trotted off.  \"It looks as if he had learned something of your skill,\" remarked the doctor with a smile.  Again, while the words were in the mouth of the speaker, he was interrupted, this time in a more terrifying manner than before.  From the direction of the stream which they had left but a short time previous, and undoubtedly from the boat itself, came the reports of firearms.  There were no shouts or outcries, but the firing was rapid and apparently made by gun and pistol.  \"They have been attacked!\" exclaimed Mary; \"we must go to their help!\"  She impulsively started along the path, but her father seized her arm and said sternly:  \"Remain here!  It is no place for you; Jack and I will do what we can.\"  Perhaps in the excitement of the moment the parent did not fully comprehend the danger of leaving his daughter alone in the jungle, even at so slight a distance and for so brief a time as he anticipated, with nothing but a revolver as a means of defence; but he and Jack Everson were eager to rush to the aid of their friends, and they hurried over the trail without even looking back at her.  The young man was slightly behind his companion and both broke into a loping trot.  Each held his rifle in hand, on the alert to use it the instant the opportunity presented itself.  It will be borne in mind that the distance from the slight natural opening to the boat was short, and a few minutes sufficed for the two men to cover it; but a strange thing happened.  The reports of firearms which had broken out with such suddenness ceased with the same abruptness, and the silence because of the contrast was tenfold more oppressive than before.  \"What can that mean?\" asked Jack, as his companion slackened his pace.  \"_It means that they are through_!\" replied the doctor, whose face was of deathly paleness.  \"My God! what have we escaped!\"  \"We shall soon know,\" replied Jack, catching the awful significance of the words; and then he added to himself:  \"We may have escaped it, but for how long?\"  A few rods further and they were at the side of the stream, and the boat loomed to view through the thick undergrowth and vegetation.     CHAPTER XV.  GONE!  Neither Jack Everson nor Dr. Marlowe forgot his own personal danger in hurrying to the help of their imperilled friends.  If the two were too late to be of any assistance they were imminently likely to precipitate themselves into the same whirlpool of woe and death.  They had slowed their gait to a walk as they neared the spot, and when they caught the dim outlines of the boat the two stood still.  So far as they could see there was no change in its surroundings.  It was still moored against the bank, so close that any one could step aboard, but no sign of living person was visible on or about it.  There was something so uncanny in it all that but for their mutual knowledge they would have doubted the evidence of their senses.  \"I don't understand it,\" whispered Jack.  \"Suppose you stay here while I steal nigh enough to learn something that will help clear up the horrible mystery.\"  \"You are running frightful risk,\" said the doctor; \"I cannot advise you to try it.\"  \"All the same, I shall do it.\"  Thus, it will be observed that the three persons composing the little party became separated from one another for greater or less distances. The daughter was waiting, two or three hundred yards away, for the return of her father and lover, while they had just parted company, though they expected to remain in sight of each other.  Dr. Marlowe stood in the path, partly sheltering himself behind a couple of tree trunks, but with his eyes fixed upon his young friend, who walked cautiously but unhesitatingly forward.  Jack held his rifle in a trailing position at his side, his shoulders bent slightly forward, while he stepped lightly, his senses alert, like those of a scout entering the camp of an enemy.  That he was running into great danger was self-evident, but he was determined not to turn back until he learned something of the strange occurrences.  Watching his young friend, the doctor saw him stop when at the side of the motionless boat.  His profile showed first on one side and then, on the other, while he listened for the slightest sound that could give an atom of knowledge.  Apparently the effort was useless, for the next moment he placed his left hand on the gunwale and vaulted lightly upon deck.  He stood a few moments as if transfixed, then turning abruptly about leaped to the ground, and, breaking into a run, hurried back to his friend, who noticed that his face was more ghastly than before, while his eyes stared as if they still looked upon unutterable things.  \"What is it?\" asked the elder in a ghostly whisper.  \"My God! don't ask me to tell!\"  \"You forget that we are both physicians.\"  \"But not that we are human beings; thank Heaven forever that you did not look upon the sight my eyes saw a moment ago.  Let it suffice, doctor, to say that of the three men and women to whom we bade good-bye within the past twenty minutes not one is alive!  The fiends have been there.\"  Not the least singular fact connected with this hideous incident was that the devils who committed the unspeakable crime had vanished, so far as could be seen, as utterly as if the ground had opened beneath their feet and swallowed them.  Two men had come back upon the scene within a few minutes after all this was done, and yet the doers were nowhere in sight.  What was the meaning of their hasty departure?  It was unreasonable to think they had gone far.  They must be in the vicinity.  They must have noticed the absence of the doctor and"]]]
