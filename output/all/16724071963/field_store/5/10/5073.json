I  DEBUSSY AND HIS ART   With the production at Paris in the spring of 1902 of Claude Debussy's _Pelléas et Mélisande_, based on the play of Maeterlinck, the history of music turned a new and surprising page. \"It is necessary,\" declared an acute French critic, M. Jean Marnold, writing shortly after the event, \"to go back perhaps to _Tristan_ to find in the opera house an event so important in certain respects for the evolution of musical art.\" The assertion strikes one to-day, five years after, as, if anything, over-cautious. _Pelléas et Mélisande_ exhibited not simply a new manner of writing opera, but a new kind of music--a new way of evolving and combining tones, a new order of harmonic, melodic and rhythmic structure. The style of it was absolutely new and absolutely distinctive: the thing had never been done before, save, in a lesser degree, by Debussy himself in his then little known earlier work. Prior to the appearance of _Pelléas et Mélisande_, he had put forth, without appreciably disturbing the musical waters, all of the extraordinary and individual music with which his fame is now associated, except the three orchestral \"sketches,\" _La Mer_ (composed in 1903-1905 and published in the latter year), the piano pieces _Estampes_ (1903), and _Images, Masques, l'Île joyeuse_ (1905), and a few songs. Certain audiences in Paris had heard, nine years before, his setting of Rossetti's \"Blessed Damozel\" (_La Demoiselle Élue_), a \"lyric poem\" for two solo voices, female chorus, and orchestra; in the same year (1893) his string quartet was played by Ysaÿe and his associates; in 1894 his _Prélude à l'Après-midi d'un Faune_ was produced at a concert of the National Society of Music; the first two Nocturnes for orchestra, _Nuages_ and _Fêtes_, were played at a Lamoureux concert in 1900; the third, _Sirènes_, was performed with the others in the following year. Yet it was not until _Pelléas et Mélisande_ was produced at the Opéra-Comique in April, 1902, that his work began seriously to be reckoned with outside of the small and inquisitive public, in Paris and elsewhere, that had known and valued--or execrated--it.  In this score Debussy went far beyond the point to which his methods had previously led him. It was, for all who heard it or came to know it, a revelation of the possibilities of tonal effect--this dim and wavering and elusive music, with its infinitely subtle gradations, its gossamer fineness of texture, its delicate sonorities, its strange and echoing dissonances, its singular richness of mood, its shadowy beauty, its exquisite and elaborate art--this music which drifted before the senses like iridescent vapor, suffused with rich lights, pervasive, imponderable, evanescent. It was music at once naïve and complex, innocent and impassioned, fragile and sonorous. It spoke with an accent unmistakably grave and sincere; yet it spoke without emphasis: indirectly, flexibly, with fluid and unpredictable expression. It was eloquent beyond denial, yet its reticence, its economy of gesture, were extreme--were, indeed, the very negation of emphasis. Is it strange that such music--hesitant, evasive, dream-filled, strangely ecstatic, with its wistful and twilight loveliness, its blended subtlety and simplicity--should have been as difficult to trace to any definite source as it was, for the general, immensely astonishing and unexpected? There was nothing like it to be found in Wagner, or in his more conspicuous and triumphant successors--in, so to speak, the direct and royal line. Richard Strauss was, clearly, not writing in that manner; nor were the brother musicians of Debussy in his own France; nor, quite as obviously, were the Russians. The immediate effect of its strangeness and newness was, of course, to direct the attention of the larger world of music, within Paris and without, to the artistic personality and the previous attainments of the man who had surprisingly put forth such incommensurable music.  Achille[1] Claude Debussy was born at St. Germain-en-Laye (Seine-et-Oise), France, August 22, 1862. He was still a youth when he entered the Paris Conservatory, where he studied harmony under Lavignac, composition under Guiraud, and piano playing with Marmontel. He was only fourteen when he won the first medal for _solfège_, and fifteen when he won the second pianoforte prize.  [1] He no longer uses the first of these given names.  In 1884, when he was in his twenty-second year, his cantata, _l'Enfant prodigue_, won for him the _Prix de Rome_ by a majority of twenty-two out of twenty-eight votes--it is said to have been the unanimous opinion of the jury that the score was \"one of the most interesting that had been heard at the _Institut_ for years.\" While at the Villa Médicis he composed, in 1887, his _Printemps_ for chorus and orchestra, and, in the following year, his setting of Rossetti's \"Blessed Damozel,\" of which the authorities at the Conservatory saw fit to disapprove because of certain liberties which Debussy even then was taking with established and revered traditions. He performed his military service upon his return from Rome; and there is a tradition told, as bearing upon his love of recondite sonorities, to the effect that while at Évreux he delighted in the harmonic clash caused by the simultaneous sounding of the trumpet call for the extinguishing of lights and the sustained vibrations of some neighboring convent bells. From this time forward his output was persistent and moderately copious. To the year 1888 belong, in addition to _La Demoiselle Élue_, the remarkably individual \"Ariettes,\"[2] six settings for voice and piano of poems by Verlaine. To 1889-1890 belong the _Fantaisie_ for piano and orchestra and the striking \"Cinq Poèmes de Baudelaire\" (_Le Balcon_, _Harmonie du Soir_, _Le Jet d'Eau_, _Recueillement_, _La Mort des Amants_). In 1891 came some less significant piano pieces; but the following two years were richly productive, for they brought forth the exquisite _Prélude à l'Après-midi d'un Faune_ for orchestra, after the Éclogue of Mallarmé--the first extended and inescapable manifestation of Debussy's singular gifts--and the very personal but less important string quartet. In 1893-1895 he was busied with _Pelléas et Mélisande_,[3] and with the _Proses lyriques_, four songs--not of his best--to words of his own (_De Rêve_, _De Grève_, _De Fleurs_, _De Soir_). The next four years--1896-1899--saw the issue of the extremely characteristic and uncompromising Nocturnes for orchestra (_Nuages_, _Fêtes_, _Sirènes_), and the fascinating and subtle _Chansons de Bilitis_, after Pierre Louys--songs in which, aptly observed his colleague Bruneau, \"he mingled an antique and almost evaporated perfume with penetrating modern odors.\" The collection \"Pour le Piano\" (_Prélude_, _Sarabande_, _Toccata_)--inventions of distinguished and original style--and some less representative songs and piano pieces, completed his achievements before the production of _Pelléas et Mélisande_ brought him fame and a measure of relief from lean and pinching days. He has from time to time made public appearances in Paris as a pianist in concerts of chamber music; and he has even resorted--one wonders how desperately?--to the writing of music criticism for various journals and reviews. \"Artists,\" he has somewhat cynically observed, \"struggle long enough to win their place in the market; once the sale of their productions is assured, they quickly go backward.\" There is as yet no sign that he himself is fulfilling this prediction; for his most recent published performance,[4] the superbly fantastic and imaginative _La Mer_--completed three years after the production of _Pelléas_--is charged to the brim with his peculiar and potent quality.  [2] A revised version of these songs was published fifteen years later, in 1903, dedicated _à Miss Mary Garden, inoubliable Mélisande_.  [3] M. Debussy sends me the information that, although the music of _Pelléas et Mélisande_ was begun as early as September, 1893, he was not finally through with it until nine years later. In the spring of 1901 the last scene of the fourth act (the love-scene at the fountain in the park, with its abrupt and tragic close) was rewritten, and in 1902, after the first rehearsals at the Opéra-Comique, it was found necessary to lengthen the orchestral interludes between the different tableaux in order that the scene-shifters might have sufficient time to change the settings. These extended interludes are included in the edition of the score for piano and voices, with French and English text, published in 1907.  [4] The above is written in July, 1907.  What are the more prominent traits of the music of this man who is the product of no school, who has no essential affinities with his contemporaries, who has been accurately characterized as the \"très exceptionnel, très curieux, très solitaire M. Claude Debussy\"? One is struck, first of all, in savoring his art, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16488"],["title","Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande (#1)"],["body","its extreme fluidity, its vagueness of contour, its lack of obvious and definite outline. It is cloudlike, evanescent, impalpable; it passes before the aural vision (so to speak) like a floating and multicolored mist; it is shifting, fugitive, intangible, atmospheric. Its beauty is not the beauty that issues from clear and transparent designs, from a lucid and outspoken style: it is a remote and inexplicable beauty, a beauty shot through with mystery and strangeness, baffling, incalculable. It is unexpected and subtle in accent, wayward and fantastic in rhythm. Harmonically it obeys no known law--consonances, dissonances, are interfused, blended, re-echoed, juxtaposed, without the smallest regard for the rules of tonal relationship established by long tradition. It recognizes no boundaries whatsoever between the different keys; there is constant flux and change, and the same tonality is seldom maintained beyond a single beat of the measure. There are key-signatures, but they strike one as having been put in place as a mere yielding to what M. Debussy doubtless regards indulgently as an amiable and harmless prejudice. His melodic schemes suggest no known model--they conform to patterns which intertwine and melt and are suddenly and surprisingly transformed; they are without punctuation, uncadenced, irregular, unpredictable, indescribably sensitive and supple. There is a marked indifference to the possibilities of contrapuntal effect, a dependence upon a method fundamentally homophonic rather than polyphonic--this music is a rich and shimmering texture of blended chord-groups, rather than a pattern of interlaced melodic strands. One cannot but note the manner in which it abhors and shuns the easily achieved, the facile, the expected. Its colors and designs are rare and far-sought and most heedfully contrived; its eloquence is never unrestrained; and this hatred of the obvious is as plainly sincere as it is passionate and uncompromising; it is not the fastidiousness of a _précieux_, but of an extravagantly scrupulous and austerely exacting artist.  Here, then, is as anomalous an aesthetic product as one could well imagine. In a day when magnitude of plan and vividness of color, rhetorical emphasis and dynamic brilliancy, are the ideals which preëminently sway our tonal architects, emerges this reticent, half-lit, delicately structured, subtly accented music; which is incorrigibly unrhetorical; which never declaims or insists: an art alembicated, static, severely restrained--for even when it is most harmonically untrammeled, most rhythmically fantastic, one is aware of a quietly inexorable logic, an uncompromising ideal of form, underlying its seemingly unregulated processes. It is the product of a temperament unique in music, though familiar enough in the modern expression of the other arts. Debussy is of that clan who have uncompromisingly \"turned their longing after the wind and wave of the mind.\" He is, as I have elsewhere written, of the order of those poets and dreamers who persistently heed, and seek to continue in their art, not the echoes of passional and adventurous experience, but the vibrations of the spirit beneath. He is of the brotherhood of those mystical explorers, of peculiarly modern temper, who are perhaps most essentially represented in the plays and poetry and philosophies of Mr. Yeats and M. Maeterlinck: those who dwell--it has before been said--\"upon the confines of a crepuscular world whose every phase is full of subtle portent, and who are convinced (in the phrase of M. Maeterlinck himself) 'that there are in man many regions more fertile, more profound, and more interesting than those of his reason or his intelligence.'\" It is an order of temperament for which the things of the marginal world of the mind are of transcendent consequence--that world which is perpetually haunted, for those mystics who are also the slaves of beauty, by remote illusions and disquieting enchantments: where it is not dreams, but the reflections of dreams, that obsess; where passion is less the desire of life than of the shadow of life. It is a world of images and refractions, of visions and presentiments, a world which swims in dim and opalescent mists--where gestures are adored and every footfall is charged with indescribable intimations; where, \"even in the swaying of a hand or the dropping of unbound hair, there is less suggestion of individual action than of a divinity living within, shaping an elaborate beauty in a dream for its own delight.\" It is, for those who inhabit it, a world as exclusively preoccupying and authentic as it is, for those who do not, incredible and inaccessible. The reports of it, intense and gleaming as they may be, which are contained in the art of such of its inhabitants as Debussy, are, admittedly, little likely to conciliate the unbeliever. This is music which it is hopeless to attempt to justify or promote. It persuades, or it does not; one is attuned to it, or one is not. For those who do savor and value it, it is reasonable only to attempt some such notation of its qualities as is offered here.  Debussy's ancestry is not easily traced. Wagner, whom he has amused himself by decrying in the course of his critical excursions, shaped certain aspects of his style. In some of the early songs one realizes quite clearly his indebtedness to the score of _Tristan_; yet in these very songs--say the _Harmonie du Soir_ and _La Mort des Amants_ (composed in 1889-1890)--there are amazingly individual pages: pages which even to-day sound ultra-modern. And when one recalls that at the time these songs were written the score of _Parsifal_ had been off Wagner's desk for only seven years, that Richard Strauss was putting forth such tentative things as his _Don Juan_ and _Tod und Verklärung_, that the \"revolutionary\" Max Reger was a boy of sixteen, and that Debussy himself was not yet thirty, one is in a position forcibly to realize the early growth and the genuineness of his independence. Adolphe Jullien, the veteran French critic, discerns in his earlier writing the influence of such Russians as Borodine, Rimsky-Korsakoff, and Mussorgsky--a discovery which one finds some difficulty in crediting. Later, Debussy was undoubtedly affected, in a slight degree, by César Franck; and there were moments--happily infrequent--during what one may call his middle period, when a whiff of the perfumed sentiment of Massenet blew disturbingly across his usually sincere and poetic pages. But for traces of Liszt, or Berlioz, or Brahms, one will search fruitlessly. That he does not, to-day, touch hands at any point with his brother musicians of the elder school in France--with such, for example, as the excellent and brilliant and superbly unimaginative Saint-Saëns--goes almost without saying. With Vincent d'Indy, a musician of wholly antipodal qualities, he disputes the place of honor among the elect of the \"younger\" school (whose members are not so young as they are painted); and he is the worshiped idol of still younger Frenchmen who envy, depreciate, and industriously imitate his fascinating and dangerously luring art. He has traveled far on the path of his particular destiny; not since Wagner has any modern music-maker perfected a style so saturated with personality--there are far fewer derivations in his art than in the art of Strauss, through whose scores pace the ghosts of certain of the greater dead. All that Wagner could teach him of the potency of dissonance, of structural freedom and elasticity, of harmonic daring, Debussy eagerly learned and applied, as a foundation, to his own intricately reasoned though spontaneous art; yet Wagner would have gasped alike at the novelty and the exquisite art of _Pelléas et Mélisande_, of the _Nocturnes_, even of the comparatively early _Prélude à l'Après-midi d'un Faune_; for this is music of a kind which may, indeed, have been dreamed of, but which certainly had never found its way upon paper, before Debussy quietly recorded it in his scores.  What is the secret principle of his method?--if one can call that a \"method\" which is, in effect, nothing if not airily unmethodical, and that principle \"secret\" which is neither recondite nor perplexing. It is simply that Debussy, instead of depending upon the strictly limited major and minor modes of the modern scale system, employs almost continuously, as the structural basis of his music, the mediaeval church modes, with their far greater latitude, freedom, and variety. It is, to say the least, a novel procedure. Other modern composers before Debussy had, of course, utilized the characteristic plain-song progressions to secure, for special purposes, a particular and definite effect of color; but no one had ever before deliberately adopted the Gregorian chant as a substitute for the modern major and minor scales, with their deep-rooted and ineradicable harmonic tendencies, their perpetual suggestion of traditional cadences and resolutions. To forget the principles underlying three centuries of harmonic practice and revert to the methods of the mediaeval church composers, required an extraordinary degree of imaginative intuition; purposely and consistently to employ those methods as a foundation upon which to erect an harmonic structure most richly and elastically contrived--to vitalize the antique modes with the accumulated product of modern divination and accomplishment--was little less than an inspiration. Debussy must undoubtedly have realized that the familiar scales, which have so long and so faithfully served the expressional needs of the modern composer, tend now to give issue to musical forms that are beginning to seem _clichée_: forms too rigidly patterned, too redolent of outworn formulas--in short, too completely crystallized. Chopin, Liszt, Wagner, and after them the modern Germans and their followers, found in a scale of semitones a limited avenue of escape from the confinement of the modern diatonic modes,"]]]
