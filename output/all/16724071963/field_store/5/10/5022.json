John Fawcett, 1782.   70     Devizes. C.M.  _Psalm 119._     (158)  How shall the young secure their hearts,   And guard their lives from sin? Thy word the choicest rules imparts   To keep the conscience clean.  2 'Tis like the sun, a heavenly light,   That guides us all the day; And, through the dangers of the night,   A lamp to lead our way.  3 Thy precepts make me truly wise;   I hate the sinners' road; I hate my own vain thoughts that rise   But love thy law, my God!  4 Thy word is everlasting truth;   How pure is every page! That holy book shall guide our youth,   And well support our age.       Isaac Watts, 1719.   71     Devizes. C.M.  _Perfection of the Law and Testimony._     (154)  Thy law is perfect, Lord of light;   Thy testimonies sure; The statutes of thy realm are right,   And thy commandments pure.  2 Let these, O God, my soul convert,   And make thy servant wise; Let those be gladness to my ears--   The dayspring to mine eyes.  3 By these may I be warned betimes;   Who knows the guile within? Lord, save me from presumptuous crimes;   Cleanse me from secret sin.  4 So may the words my lips express--   The thoughts that throng my mind-- O Lord, my strength and righteousness,   With thee acceptance find.       C. Wesley.   72     Manoah. C.M.  _Faithfulness._  Begin, my tongue, some heavenly theme,   And speak some boundless thing; The mighty works or mightier name   Of our eternal King.  2 Tell of his wondrous faithfulness,   And sound his power abroad; Sing the sweet promise of his grace,   And the performing God.  3 His very word of grace is strong,   As that which built the skies; The voice that rolls the stars along,   Speaks all the promises.  4 Oh, might I hear thy heavenly tongue   But whisper, \"Thou art mine!\" Those gentle words should raise my song   To notes almost divine.       Isaac Watts.   73     Manoah. C.M.  _Power_.  The Lord, our God, is full of might,   The winds obey his will; He speaks,--and, in his heavenly height,   The rolling sun stands still.  2 Rebel, ye waves, and o'er the land   With threatening aspect roar; The Lord uplifts his awful hand,   And chains you to the shore.  3 Howl, winds of night, your force combine;   Without his high behest, Ye shall not, in the mountain pine,   Disturb the sparrow's nest.  4 His voice sublime is heard afar,   In distant peals it dies; He yokes the whirlwind to his car,   And sweeps the howling skies.  5 Ye nations bend--in reverence bend;   Ye monarchs, wait his nod, And bid the choral song ascend   To celebrate your God.       H. Kirke White.   74     Manoah. C.M.  _Eternity._  Great God! how infinite art thou!   What worthless worms are we! Let the whole race of creatures bow,   And pay their praise to thee.  2 Thy throne eternal ages stood,   Ere seas or stars were made: Thou art the ever-living God,   Were all the nations dead.  3 Eternity, with all its years,   Stands present in thy view; To thee there's nothing old appears--   Great God! there's nothing new.  4 Our lives through various scenes are drawn,   And vexed with trifling cares; While thine eternal thought moves on   Thine undisturbed affairs.  5 Great God! how infinite art thou!   What worthless worms are we! Let the whole race of creatures bow.   And pay their praise to thee.       Isaac Watts.   75     Italy. 6s & 4s.  _The Trinity Adored._     (394)  Come, thou Almighty King! Help us thy name to sing,   Help us to praise; Father all glorious! O'er all victorious, Come and reign over us,   Ancient of days!  2 Come, thou incarnate Word! Gird on thy mighty sword;   Our prayer attend: Come, and thy people bless, And give thy word success; Spirit of holiness,   On us descend.  3 Come, holy Comforter! Thy sacred witness bear   In this glad hour: Thou who almighty art, Now rule in every heart, And ne'er from us depart,   Spirit of power!  4 To the great One in Three, The highest praises be,   Hence, evermore! His sovereign majesty May we in glory see, And to eternity   Love and adore.       Charles Wesley, 1757.   76     All Saints. L.M.  _Praise to the Trinity_     (391)  Blest be the Father and his love,   To whose celestial source we owe Rivers of endless joy above,   And rills of comfort here below.  2 Glory to thee, great Son of God!   From whose dear, wounded body rolls A precious stream of vital blood--   Pardon and life for dying souls  3 We give the sacred Spirit praise,   Who, in our hearts of sin and woe, Makes living springs of grace arise,   And into boundless glory flow.  4 Thus, God, the Father, God, the Son,   And God, the Spirit, we adore; That sea of life and love unknown,   Without a bottom or a shore.       Isaac Watts, 1709.   77     Elizabethtown. C.M.  _God Incomprehensible._     (844)  Thy way, O God! is in the sea,   Thy paths I cannot trace; Nor comprehend the mystery   Of thine unbounded grace.  2 'Tis but in part I know thy will;   I bless thee for the sight; When will thy love the rest reveal,   In glory's clearer light?  3 Here the dark veils of flesh and sense   My captive soul surround; Mysterious deeps of providence   My wondering thoughts confound.  4 As through a glass I dimly see   The wonders of thy love; How little do I know of thee,   Or of the joys above!  5 With rapture I shall soon survey   Thy providence and grace; And spend an everlasting day   In wonder, love, and praise.       John Fawcett, 1782.   78     Elizabethtown. C.M.  _Eternity of God._     (1071)  O God! our help in ages past,   Our hope for years to come; Our shelter from the stormy blast,   And our eternal home.  2 Under the shadow of thy throne,   Still may we dwell secure; Sufficient is thine arm alone,   And our defense is sure.  3 Before the hills in order stood,   Or earth received her frame, From everlasting thou art God,   To endless years the same.  4 A thousand ages in thy sight   Are like an evening gone; Short as the watch that ends the night,   Before the rising sun.  5 The busy tribes of flesh and blood,   With all their cares and fears, Are carried downward by the flood,   And lost in following years.       Isaac Watts, 1719.   79     Elizabethtown. C.M.  _Divine Perfections._     (182)  I sing th' almighty power of God,   That made the mountains rise, That spread the flowing seas abroad,   And built the lofty skies.  2 I sing the wisdom that ordained   The sun to rule the day; The moon shines full at his command,   And all the stars obey.  3 I sing the goodness of the Lord,   That filled the earth with food; He formed the creatures with his word,   And then pronounced them good.  4 Lord! how thy wonders are displayed   Where'er I turn mine eye! If I survey the ground I tread,   Or gaze upon the sky.       Isaac Watts.   80     Dundee. C.M.  _Our Heavenly Father._     (21)  My God how wonderful thou art!   Thy majesty how bright! How beautiful thy mercy seat,   In depths of burning light.  2 How dread are thine eternal years,   Oh, everlasting Lord! By prostrate spirits day and night,   Incessantly adored.  3 Oh, how I fear thee, living God!   With deepest, tenderest fears, And worship thee with trembling hope,   And penitential tears.  4 Yet I may love thee, too, O Lord!   Almighty as thou art, For thou hast stooped to ask of me   The love of this poor heart.  5 No earthly father loves like thee,   No mother, half so mild, Bears and forbears as thou hast done   With me, thy sinful child.  6 Father of Jesus! love's reward!   What rapture will it be, Prostrate before thy throne to lie,   And gaze and gaze on thee.       Frederick Wm. Faber, 1849.   81     Dundee. C.M.  _God's Ways Not Understood._     (848)  God moves in a mysterious way,   His wonders to perform; He plants his footsteps in the sea,   And rides upon the storm.  2 Deep in unfathomable mines   Of never-failing skill, He treasures up his bright designs,   And works his sovereign will.  3 Ye fearful saints! fresh courage take;   The clouds ye so much dread, Are big with mercy, and shall break   In blessings on your head.  4 Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,   But trust him for his grace; Behind a frowning providence,   He hides a smiling face.  5 His purposes will ripen fast,   Unfolding every hour; The bud may have a bitter taste,   But sweet will be the flower.  6 Blind unbelief is sure to err,   And scan his work in vain; God is his own interpreter,   And he will make it plain.       William Cowper, 1772.   82     Dundee. C.M.  _Majesty. Ps. 18._  The Lord descended from above,   And bowed the heavens most high; And underneath his feet he cast   The darkness of the sky.  2 On cherub and on cherubim   Full royally he rode; And on the wings of mighty winds   Came flying all abroad.  3 He sat serene upon the floods,   Their fury to restrain; And he, as sovereign Lord and King,   Forevermore shall reign.       Thomas Sternhold, d. 1549.   83     Triumph. L.M.  _The Goodness of God._     (176)  Yes, God is good; in earth and sky, From ocean depths and spreading wood, Ten thousand voices seem to cry, \"God made us all, and God is good.\"  2 The sun that keeps his trackless way, And downward pours his golden flood, Night's sparkling hosts all seem to sky, In accents clear, that God is good.  3 Yes, God is good, all Nature says, By God's own hand with speech endued; And man, in louder notes of praise, Should sing for joy that God is good.  4 For all thy gifts, we bless thee, Lord; But chiefly for our heavenly food, Thy pardoning grace, thy quickening word; These prompt our song that God is good.       John H. Gurney.   84     Triumph. L.M.  _The Eternity of God._     (179)  Ere mountains reared their forms sublime,   Or heaven and earth in order stood, Before the birth of ancient time,   From everlasting thou art God.  2 A thousand ages in their flight   With thee are as a fleeting day; Past, present, future, to thy sight   At once their various scenes display.  3 But our brief life's a shadowy dream--   A passing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16455"],["title","The Otterbein Hymnal (#6)"],["body",", that soon is o'er; That fades with morning's earliest beam,   And fills the musing mind no more.  4 To us, O Lord, the wisdom give,   Each passing moment so to spend, That we at length with thee may live   Where life and bliss shall never end.       Isaac Watts.   85     Triumph. L.M.  _God Seen in nature._     (178)  There is a God--all nature speaks,   Through earth, and air, and sea, and skies; See, from the clouds his glory breaks,   When earliest beams of morning rise.  2 The rising sun, serenely bright,   Throughout the world's extended frame, Inscribes in characters of light   His mighty Maker's glorious name.  3 Ye curious minds, who roam abroad,   And trace creation's wonders o'er, Confess the footsteps of your God--   Bow down before him and adore.       Anne Steele   86     Triumph. L.M.  _The Lord God Omnipotent._     (14)  The Lord is King; child of the dust! The Judge of all the earth is just; Holy and true are all his ways; Let every creature speak his praise.  2 The Lord is King! lift up thy voice, Oh, earth! and all ye heavens! rejoice; From world to world the joy shall ring-- The Lord omnipotent is King.  3 The Lord is King! who then shall dare Resist his will, distrust his care, Or murmur at his wise decrees, Or doubt his royal promises?  4 Oh, when his wisdom can mistake, His might decay, his love forsake, Then may his children cease to sing-- The Lord omnipotent is King.       Josiah Conder.   87     Faben. 8s & 7s. D.  _God is Love._  God is love; his mercy brightens   All the path in which we rove; Bliss he wakes, and woe he lightens:   God is wisdom, God is love. Chance and change are busy ever;   Man decays and ages move; But his mercy waneth never;   God is wisdom, God is love.  2 E'en the hour the darkest seemeth   Will his changeless goodness prove; From the gloom his brightness streameth:   God is wisdom, God is love. He with earthly cares entwineth   Hope and comfort from above; Everywhere his glory shineth:   God is wisdom, God is love.       Sir John Bowring, 1825.   88     Mannheim. 8s & 7s.  _The Divine Glory._     (56)  Lord! thy glory fills the heaven;   Earth is with its fullness stored; Unto thee be glory given,   Holy, holy, holy Lord.  2 Heaven is still with glory ringing,   Earth takes up the angels' cry-- \"Holy, holy, holy!\" singing,   \"Lord of hosts! the Lord most high!\"  3 Ever thus in God's high praises,   Brethren! let our tongues unite; Chief the heart when duty raises   God-ward at his mystic rite.       Richard Mant, 1828.   89     Azmon. C.M.  _Creating Wisdom._     (184)  Eternal Wisdom! thee we praise,   Thee the creation sings; With thy loved name, rocks, hills, and seas,   And heaven's high palace rings.  2 Thy hand, how wide it spread the sky!   How glorious to behold! Tinged with a blue of heavenly dye,   And starred with sparkling gold.  3 Infinite strength and equal skill   Shine through the worlds abroad; Our souls with vast amazement fill,   And speak the builder--God.  4 But the sweet beauties of thy grace   Our softer passions move; Pity divine, in Jesus' face,   We see, adore, and love.       Isaac Watts, 1705.   90     Azmon. C.M.  _The Trinity._     (388)  Hail! holy, holy, holy, Lord,   Whom One in Three we know; By all thy heavenly host adored,   By all thy Church below.  2 One undivided Trinity   With triumph we proclaim; The universe is full of thee,   And speaks thy glorious name.  3 Thee, holy Father, we confess;   Thee, holy Son, adore; And thee, the Holy Ghost, we bless,   And worship evermore.  4 Hail! holy, holy, holy Lord,   Our heavenly song shall be Supreme, Essential One, adored   In co-eternal Thee!       C. Wesley, 1767.   91     Azmon. C.M.  _God is Love._     (183)  Come, ye that know and fear the Lord,   And lift your souls above; Let every heart and voice accord,   To sing that--God is love.  2 This precious truth his word declares,   And all his mercies prove; Jesus, the Gift of gifts, appears,   To show that--God is love.  3 Behold his patience lengthened out   To those who from him rove, And calls effectual reach their hearts,   To teach them--God is love.  4 The work begun is carried on   By power from heaven above; And every step from first to last,   Declares that--God is love.       George Burder, 1784.   92     Azmon. C.M.  _God's Constant Goodness._     (179)  Jehovah God! thy gracious power   On every hand we see; Oh, may the blessings of each hour   Lead all our thoughts to thee.  2 Thy power is in the ocean deeps,   And reaches to the skies; Thine eye of mercy never sleeps,   Thy goodness never dies.  3 In all the varying scenes of time,   On thee our hopes depend; In every age, in every clime,   Our Father and our Friend.       John Thompson, 1810   93     God is Love. P.M.  _Praise for God's Love._  Come, let us all unite to sing,           God is love; Let heav'n and earth their praises bring,           God is love; Let every soul from sin awake, Each in his heart sweet music make, And sing with us for Jesus' sake,           For God is love.  Ref.--God is love,       God is love.       Come, let us all unite to sing       That God is love.  2 Oh, tell us to earth's remotest bound,           God is love; In Christ we have redemption found,           God is love; His blood has washed our sins away, His Spirit turned our night to day, And now we can rejoice to say           That God is love.  3 How happy is our portion here,           God is love; His promises our spirits cheer,           God is love; He is our sun and shield by day, Our help, our hope, our strength, and stay; He will be with us all the way;           Our God is love.       Anon.   94     Carol. C.M.D.  _The Angels' Song._     (206)  It came upon the midnight clear,   That glorious song of old, From angels bending near the earth,   To touch their harps of gold; \"Peace to the earth, good-will to men,   From heaven's all gracious King:\" The earth in solemn stillness lay,   To hear the angels sing.  2 Still through the cloven skies they come,   With peaceful wings unfurled; And still celestial music floats   O'er all the weary world; Above its sad and lowly plains   They bend on heavenly wing, And ever o'er its Babel sounds,   The blessed angels sing.  3 O ye, beneath life's crushing load,   Whose forms are bending low, Who toil along the climbing way,   With painful steps and slow;-- Look up! for glad and golden hours   Come swiftly on the wing; Oh, rest beside the weary road,   And hear the angels sing!  4 For lo! the days are hastening on,   By prophet-bards foretold, When with the ever-circling years   Comes round the age of gold! When peace shall over all the earth   Its final splendors fling, And the whole world send back the song   Which now the angels sing!       E.H. Sears, 1850.   95     Carol. C.M.D.  _A Light to Lighten the Gentiles._     (203)  The race that long in darkness pine   Have seen a glorious light; The people dwell in day who dwelt   In death's surrounding night. To hail thy rise, thou better Sun,   The gathering nations come, With joy, as when the reapers bear   The harvest treasures home.  2 To us a child of hope is born;   To us a Son is given; And him shall all the earth obey,   And all the hosts of heaven. His name shall be the Prince of Peace,   Forevermore adored, The Wonderful, the Counselor,   The great and mighty Lord.       John Morrison, 1781.   96     Christmas. C.M.  _The Angel's Message_     (208)  While shepherds watched their flocks by night,   All seated on the ground, The angel of the Lord came down,   And glory shone around.  2 \"Fear not,\" said he,--for mighty dread   Had seized their troubled mind,-- \"Glad tidings of great joy I bring   To you and all mankind.  3 \"To you, in David's town, this day,   Is born of David's line, The Savior, who is Christ, the Lord;   And this shall be the sign:  4 \"The heavenly babe you there shall find   To human view displayed, All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,   And in a manger laid.\"  5 Thus spake the seraph; and forthwith   Appeared a shining throng Of angels, praising God, and thus   Addressed their joyful song:  6 \"All glory be to God on high,   And to the earth be peace: Good-will henceforth from heaven to men   Begin and never cease!\"       Nahum Tate, 1696.   97     Zerah. C.M.  _The Chorus of Angels._     (210)  Calm on the listening ear of night   Come heaven's melodious strains, Where wild Judea stretches far   Her silver-mantled plains.  2 Celestial choirs, from courts above,   Shed sacred glories there, And angels, with their sparkling lyres,   Make music on the air.  3 The answering hills of Palestine   Send back the glad reply, And greet, from all their holy heights,   The day-spring from on high.  4 \"Glory to God!\" the sounding skies   Loud with their anthems ring-- \"Peace to the earth, good-will to men,   From heaven's eternal King.\"       Edmund H. Sears, 1835.   98     Antioch. C.M.  _Psalm 98._     (200)  Joy to the world! the Lord is come:   Let earth receive her King; Let every heart prepare him room,   And heaven and nature sing.  2 Joy to the earth! the Savior reigns:   Let men their songs employ; While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains,   Repeat the sounding joy.  3 No more let sins and sorrows grow,   Nor thorns infest the ground; He comes to make his blessings flow,   Far as the curse is found.  4 He rules the world with truth and grace,   And makes the nations prove The glories of his righteousness,   And wonders of his love.       Isaac Watts, 1709.    99     Antioch. C.M.  _Christ's Mission._     (202)  Hark the glad sound! the Savior comes--   The Savior promised long; Let every heart prepare a throne,   And every voice a song.  2 He comes, the prisoners to release,   In Satan's bondage held; The gates of brass before him burst,   The iron fetters yield.  3 He comes, the broken heart to bind,   The bleeding soul to cure; And, with the treasures of his grace,   T' enrich the humble poor.  4 Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,"]]]
