Nancy, child, why art thou so wild and reckless? Thou art the cause of much anxiety.\"  At her mother's reproof, gentle though it was, poor Nancy flopped over on her stomach, and, burying her face in her hands, gave way to tears.  \"It 's all because I am so wicked,\" she moaned. \"My sins are as scarlet! Oh, Mother, dost think God will cause the lightning to strike us dead to punish me?\" She shuddered with fear as a flash shone through the chinks of the logs and for an instant lighted the dim loft.  Her mother put down the wet clothes and, lifting her little daughter tenderly in her arms, laid her on her bed. \"God maketh the rain to fall on both the just and the unjust,\" she said soothingly. \"Rest here while I go down and get supper.\"  She covered her warmly with a homespun blanket, and, accompanied by Dan, made her way down the ladder. She found her husband putting fresh logs on the fire and stirring the coals to a blaze, while the Captain hung his coat on the corner of the mantel-shelf to dry. She went up to him and held out her hand. \"Captain Sanders,\" she said, \"but for thee this might be a desolate household indeed this night.\"  The Captain's red face turned a deeper shade, and he fidgeted with embarrassment, as he took her hand in his great red paw, then dropped it suddenly as if it were hot. \"Oh, stow it, ma'am, stow it,\" he begged. \"That is, I mean to say--why, by jolly, ma'am, a pirate could do no less when he see a fine bit of cargo like that going to the bottom!\"  To the Captain's great relief the lobsters at this moment created a diversion. He had dropped them on the hearth when he came in, and they were now clattering briskly about the room, butting into anything that came in their way in an effort to escape. He made a sudden dash after them and held them out toward Goodwife Pepperell.  \"Here they be, ma'am,\" he said. \"I 'd saved them for my supper, and I 'd take it kindly if ye 'd cook them for me, and help eat them, too. It 's raining cats and dogs, and if I was to start out now, I 'd have a hard time finding the Lucy Ann. Ye can't see a rod ahead of ye in such a downpour.\"  \"We shall be glad to have thee stay as long as thou wilt,\" said the Goodwife heartily. \"Put the lobsters in this while I set the kettle to boil.\" She held out a wooden puncheon as she spoke, and the Captain dropped them in. Then he sat down with Goodman Pepperell on the settle beside the fireplace, and the two men talked of their boyhood in England, while she hung the kettle on the crane over the fire and began to prepare the evening meal.  \"Daniel, sit thee down by the fire and get a good bed of coals ready while I mix the johnny-cake,\" she said as she stepped briskly about the room, and Daniel, nothing loath, drew a stool to the Captain's side and fed the fire with chips and corn-cobs while he listened with all his ears to the talk of the two men.  [Illustration]  \"Well, Thomas, how hast thou prospered since I saw thee last?\" asked Goodman Pepperell.  \"Tolerable, tolerable, Josiah,\" answered the Captain. \"I 've been mining for sea gold.\" Daniel wondered what in the world sea gold might be. \"Ye see,\" he went on, turning to include Daniel in the conversation, \"my father was a sea captain before me, and my gran'ther too. Why, my gran'ther helped send the Spanish Armada to the bottom where it belonged. Many and many 's the time I 've heard him tell about it, and I judge from what he said he must have done most of the job himself, though I reckon old Cap'n Drake may have helped some.\" (Here the Captain chuckled.) \"He never came back from his last voyage,--overhauled by pirates more 'n likely. That was twenty years ago, and I 've been following the sea myself ever since. I was wrecked off the Spanish Main on my first voyage, and I 've run afoul of pirates and come near walking the plank more times than one, I 'm telling ye, but somehow I always had the luck to get away! And here I be, safe and sound.\"  At this point the lobsters made a commotion in the wooden puncheon, and the Captain turned his attention to them. \"Jest spilin' to get out, ain't ye?\" he inquired genially. \"Look here, boy,\" to Daniel, \"that water's bilin'. Heave 'em in.\"  Daniel held his squirming victims over the pot, and not without a qualm of pity dropped them into the boiling water. Then he ventured to ask a question. \"What is sea gold, Captain Sanders?\"  \"Things like them,\" answered the Captain, jerking his thumb at the lobsters, which were already beginning to turn a beautiful red color as they boiled in the pot; \"as good gold as any that was ever dug out of mines ye can get for fish, and there never was such fishing in all the seas as there is along this coast! My! my! I 've seen schools of cod off the Cape making a solid floor of fish on the water so ye could walk on it if ye were so minded, and as for lobsters, I 've caught 'em that measured six and seven feet long! Farther down the coast there are oysters so big one of 'em will make a square meal for four or five people. It 's the truth I 'm telling ye.\"  Goodman Pepperell smiled. \"Thomas,\" he said, \"thou hast not lost thy power of narration!\"  Captain Sanders for an instant looked a bit dashed, then he said, \"Well, believe it or not, Josiah, it 's the truth for all that. Why, talk about the land of Canaan flowin' with milk and honey! This here water 's just alive with money! Any boy could go out and haul up a shilling on his own hook any time he liked.\"  Daniel, his eyes shining and his lips parted, was just making up his mind that he would rather be the captain of a fishing-smack than anything else in the world, since he knew he could n't be a pirate, when his mother came to the fireplace with a layer of corn-meal dough spread on a baking-board. She placed the board in a slanting position against an iron trivet before the glowing bed of coals, and set a pot of beans in the ashes to warm. \"Keep an eye on that johnny-cake,\" she said to Daniel, \"and don't let it burn.\" Then she turned away to set the table.  [Illustration]  This task took but little time, for in those days there were few things to put on it. She spread a snowy cloth of homespun linen on the plank which served as a table, and laid a knife and spoon at each place; there were no forks, and for plates only a square of wood with a shallow depression in the middle. Beside each of these trenchers she placed a napkin and a mug, and at the Captain's place, as a special honor, she set a beautiful tankard of wrought silver. It was one of the few valuable things she had brought with her from her English home, and it was used only on great occasions.  When these preparations were complete, she took the lobsters from the pot, poured the beans into a pewter dish, heaped the golden johnny-cake high upon a trencher, and, sending Dan to fetch Nancy, called the men to supper. The storm was over by this time, the last rays of the setting sun were throwing long shadows over the fields, and the robins were singing their evening song. The Goodwife stepped to the window and threw open the wooden shutters. \"See,\" she said. \"There 's a rainbow.\"  \"The sign of promise,\" murmured Goodman Pepperell, rising and looking over his wife's shoulder.  \"Fine day to-morrow,\" said the Captain. \"Maybe I can plant my lobster-pots after all.\"  Nancy, looking pale and a little subdued, crept down the ladder and took her place with Daniel at the foot of the board. Then they all stood, while Goodman Pepperell asked a blessing on the food, and thanked God for his mercy in delivering them from danger and bringing them together in health and safety to partake of his bounty.  [Illustration]     II  TWO DAYS   The grace finished (it was a very long one and the beans were nearly cold before he said amen), Goodman Pepperell broke open the lobsters and piled the trenchers with johnny-cake and beans, and the whole family fell to with a right good will. All but Nancy. She was still a bit upset and did not feel hungry.  \"Thou hast not told me, Captain, what voyage thou art about to undertake next,\" said the Goodman, sucking a lobster-claw with relish.  The Captain loved to talk quite as well as he loved to eat, but his mouth was full at this moment, and he paused before replying. \"I 'm getting too old for long voyages, Josiah,\" he said at last with a sigh. \"Kind o' losing my taste for adventure. Pirates is pretty plentiful yet, and for all I 'm a sailor I 'd like to die in my bed, so I have settled at Marblehead. They 're partial to fishermen along this coast. The town gives 'em land for drying their fish and exempts 'em from military dooty. But I can't stay ashore a great while before my sea legs begin to hanker for the feel of the deck rolling under 'em, so I 'm doing a coasting trade all up and down the length of Massachusetts Bay. I keep a parcel of lobster-pots going, some here and some Plymouth way, and sell them and fish, besides doing a carrying trade for all the towns along-shore. It 's a tame kind o' life. There, now,\" he finished, \"that 's all there is to say about me, and I 'll just take a turn at these beans and give ye a chance to tell about yourself, Josiah.\"  \"'T is but a short tale,\" answered the Goodman, \"God hath prospered me. I have an hundred acres of good farm land along this river, and I have a cow, and a flock of sheep to keep us in wool for the Good wife to spin. I have set out apple trees, and there is wood for the cutting; the forest furnishes game and the sea is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16644"],["title","The Puritan Twins (#3)"],["body","with food for our use; but the truth is there is more to do than can be compassed with one pair of hands. The neighbors help each other with clearing the land, log-rolling, building walls, and such as that, but if this country is to be developed we must do more than make a living. There are a thousand things calling to be done if there were but the men to do them.\"  The Captain skillfully balanced a mouthful of beans on his knife as he considered the problem. Finally he said, \"Well, here 's Dan'el, and, judging by the way he waded right into the tide after his sister, I calculate he 'd be a smart boy to have round.\"  \"He is,\" said the Goodman, and Daniel blushed to his eyes, for his father seldom praised him, \"but he is not yet equal to a man's work, and moreover I want him to get some schooling. The Reverend John Harvard hath promised his library and quite a sum of money to found a college for the training of ministers right here in Cambridge. The hand of the Lord hath surely guided us to this place, where he may receive an education, and it may even be that Daniel will be a minister, for the Colony sorely needs such.\"  \"There, now,\" said the Captain. \"Farming ain't such plain sailing; is it? Have ye thought of getting an Indian slave to help ye?\"  \"Truly I have thought of that,\" said the Goodman, \"but they are a treacherous lot and passing lazy. There was a parcel of Pequot women and girls brought up from beyond Plymouth way last year after the uprising. The settlers had killed off all the men and sold the boys in the Bermudas. I might have bought one of the women but I need a man, or at least a boy that will grow into one. The Pequots are about all gone now, but the Narragansetts are none too friendly. They helped fight the Pequots because they hate them worse than they hate the English, but they are only biding their time, and some day it 's likely we shall have trouble with them. Nay, I could never trust an Indian slave. Roger Williams saith they are wolves with men's brains, and he speaks the truth.\"  \"Well, then,\" said the Captain, \"why don't ye get a black? They are more docile than Indians, and the woods about are not full of their friends.\"  \"Aye,\" agreed the Goodman, \"the plan is a good one and well thought out, but they are hard to come by. There are only a few, even in Boston.\"  \"There will soon be more, I 'm thinking,\" said the Captain. \"A ship was built in Marblehead last year on purpose for the trade. Captain Pierce is a friend of mine, and he 's due at Providence any time now with a cargo of blacks from Guinea. Ye could sail down the bay with me, and there 's a trail across the neck of the Cape to Providence, where the Desire will come to port. I expect to spend the Sabbath here, but I lift anchor on Monday. Ye can tell Captain Pierce ye 're a friend of mine, and 't will do ye no harm.\"  [Illustration]  \"Oh, Father,\" breathed Dan, \"may I go, too?\"  The Captain chuckled. \"Art struck with the sea fever, son?\" he said, looking down into the boy's eager face. \"Well, there 's room aboard. I might take ye along if so be thy parents are willing and thou art minded to see a bit of the world.\"  Up to this time Goodwife Pepperell had said no word, but now she spoke. \"Are there not dangers enough on land without courting the dangers of the sea?\" she asked.  Her husband looked at her with gentle disapproval. \"Hold thy peace,\" he said. \"What hath a pioneer lad to do with fear? Moreover, if he goes I shall be with him.\"  Nancy leaned forward and gazed imploringly at the Captain. \"Dost thou not need some one to cook on thy boat?\" she gasped. \"I know well how to make johnny-cake and I--\" then, seeing her father's stern look and her mother's distress, she wilted like a flower on its stem and was silent. The Captain smiled at her.  \"Ye 're a fine cook, I make no doubt,\" he said genially, \"but ye would n't go and leave Mother here all alone, now, I 'll be bound!\"  \"Nay,\" said Nancy faintly, looking at her mother.  Then the Goodwife spoke. \"It pains me,\" she said, \"to think of children torn from their parents and sold into slavery, even though they be but Indians or blacks. I doubt not they have souls like ourselves.\"  \"Read thy Bible, Susanna,\" answered her husband. \"Cursed be Canaan. A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren--thus say the Scriptures.\"  \"Well, now,\" broke in the Captain, \"if they have souls, they 've either got to save 'em or lose 'em as I jedge it; and if they never have a chance to hear the Plan of Salvation, they 're bound to be lost anyway. Bringin' 'em over here gives them their only chance to escape damnation, according to my notion.\"  \"Hast thou ever brought over a cargo of slaves thyself?\" asked the Goodwife.  \"Nay,\" admitted the Captain, \"but I sailed once on a slaver, and I own I liked not to see the poor critters when they were lured away. It seemed they could n't rightly sense that 't was for their eternal welfare, and I never felt called to set their feet in the way of Salvation by that means myself. I reckon I 'm not more than chicken-hearted, if ye come to that.\"  The meal was now over, the dusk had deepened as they lingered about the table, and Goodwife Pepperell rose to light a bayberry candle and set it on the chimney-piece.  \"Sit ye down by the fire again, while Nancy and I wash the dishes,\" she said cordially.  \"Thank ye kindly,\" said the Captain, \"but I must budge along. It 's near dark, and Timothy--that 's my mate--will be wondering if I 've been et up by a shark. It 's going to be a clear night after the storm.\"  The children slept so soundly after the adventures of the day that their mother called them three times from the foot of the ladder in the early dawn of the following morning without getting any response. Then she mounted to the loft and shook Daniel gently. \"Wake thee,\" she said. \"'T is long past cock-crow, and Saturday at that.\"  Daniel opened his eyes feebly and was off to sleep again at once. \"Daniel,\" she said, shaking him harder, \"thy father is minded to take thee to Plymouth.\"  Before the words were fairly out of her mouth Daniel had popped out of bed as if he had been shot from a gun. \"Oh, Mother,\" he shouted, \"am I really to go? Shall I go clear to Providence? Doth Captain Sanders know? When do we start?\"  \"Thy father arranged it with the Captain last night,\" answered his mother. \"He will come for thee in the little boat on Monday morning and will row thee and thy father to the sloop, which will sail at high tide. While thy father makes the journey across the Cape thou wilt go on to Provincetown with the Captain, or mayhap, if visitors are now permitted in the Colony, my aunt, the Governor's lady, will keep thee with her until thy father returns. She would like well to see my son, I know, and I trust thou wilt be a good lad and mind thy manners. Come, Nancy, child, I need thy help!\" Then she disappeared down the ladder to stir the hasty pudding, which was already bubbling in the pot.  When she was gone, Nancy flung herself upon the mattress and buried her face in the bed-clothes. \"Oh, Daniel,\" she cried, smothering a sob, \"what if the p-p-pirates should get thee?\"  Daniel was at her side in an instant. \"Give thyself no concern about pirates, sister,\" he said, patting her comfortingly. \"I have thought how to deal with them! I shall stand by the rail with my cutlass in my hand, and when they seek to board her I will bring down my cutlass so,\"--here he made a terrific sweep with his arm,--\"and that will be the end of them.\"  \"Oh,\" breathed Nancy, much impressed, \"how brave thou art!\"  \"Well,\" said Daniel modestly, \"there 'd be the Captain and father to help, of course, and, I suppose, the mate too. There will be four of us men anyway.\"  \"_Nancy!_--_Daniel!_\"--it was their father's voice this time, and the two children jumped guiltily and began to dress as if the house were on fire and they had but two minutes to escape. In a surprisingly short time they were downstairs and attending to their morning tasks. Nancy, looking very solemn, fed the chickens, and Dan brought water from the spring, while their father milked the cow; and by six o'clock their breakfast of hasty pudding and milk had been eaten, prayers were over, and the whole family was ready for the real work of the day. There was a great deal of it to do, for nothing but \"works of necessity and mercy\" could be performed on the Sabbath, the Sabbath began at sundown Saturday afternoon, and the travellers were to make an early start on Monday morning. A fire was built in the brick oven beside the fireplace, and while it was heating the Goodwife made four pies and six loaves of brown-bread, and prepared a pot of pork and beans for baking.  [Illustration]  When the coals had been raked out and the oven filled, she washed clothes for Daniel and his father, while Nancy hurried to finish a pair of stockings she was knitting for her brother. Daniel himself, meanwhile, had gone down to the bay to see if he could find the shovel and the basket. He came home in triumph about noon with both, and with quite a number of clams beside, which the Goodwife cooked for their dinner. When they were seated at the table, and the Goodman had asked the blessing, he leaned back in his chair and surveyed the ceiling of the cabin. From the rafters there hung long festoons of dried pumpkin and golden ears of corn. There were also sausages, hams, and sides of bacon.  \"I doubt not you will fare well while we are gone,\" he said. \"There is plenty of well-cured meat, and meal enough ground to last for some time. The planting is done and the corn well hoed; there is wood cut, and Gran'ther Wattles will call upon you if he knows I am away. I am leaving the fowling-piece for thee, wife. The musket I shall take with me.\"  \"Why must Gran'ther Wattles come?\" interrupted Nancy in alarm. \"I am sure Mother and I do not need him.\"  \"Children should be seen and not heard,\" said her father. \"It is Gran'ther Wattles's duty to"]]]
