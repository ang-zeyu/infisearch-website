But she shall know what once I knew--       Eyes that are glorious to see,     The light of manhood shining through--       Because of me.      He will salute her as they meet,       And stand before her bare of head;     If she be hungry, she may eat       His last remaining bit of bread.     She'll find those splendid arms and strong       Quick to assist her, tenderly,     And they will guard her from all wrong       Because of me.      I miss his thoughtful, loving care;       I miss his smile these dreary days;     But should he meet a mother there,       Helpless and lost in war's grim maze,     She need not fear to take his arm,       As though she'd reared him at her knee;     My son will shield her from all harm       Because of me.             A Father's Tribute       I don't know what they'll put him at, or what          his post may be;     I cannot guess the task that waits for him across          the sea,     But I have known him through the years, and          when there's work to do,     I know he'll meet his duty well, I'll swear that          he'll be true.      I sometimes fear that he may die, but never that          he'll shirk;     If death shall want him death must go and take          him at his work;     This splendid sacrifice he makes is filled with          terrors grim,     And I have many thoughts of fear, but not one          fear of him.      The foe may rob my life of joy, the foe may          take my all,     And desolate my days shall be if he shall have to          fall.     But this I know, whate'er may be the grief that          I must face,     Upon his record there will be no blemish of          disgrace.      His days have all been splendid days, there lies          no broken trust     Along the pathway of his youth to molder in          the dust;     Honor and truth have marked his ways, in him          I can be glad;     He is as fine and true a son as ever a father had.             Runner McGee       (Who had \"Return if Possible\" Orders.)      \"You've heard a good deal of the telephone          wires,\" he said as we sat at our ease,     And talked of the struggle that's taking men's          lives in these terrible days o'er the seas,     \"But I've been through the thick of the thing          and I know when a battle's begun,     It isn't the phone you depend on for help. It's          the legs of a boy who can run.      \"It isn't because of the phone that I'm here.          To-day you are talking to me     Because of the grit and the pluck of a boy. His          title was Runner McGee.     We were up to our dead line an' fighting alone;          some plan had miscarried, I guess,     And the help we were promised had failed to          arrive. We were showing all signs of          distress.      \"Our curtain of fire was ahead of us still, an'          theirs was behind us an' thick,     An' there wasn't a thing we could do for ourselves--the          few of us left had to stick.     You haven't much chance to get central an' talk          on the phone to the music of guns;     Gettin' word to the chief is a matter right then          that is up to the fellow who runs.      \"I'd sent four of 'em back with the R. I. P.          sign, which means to return if you can,     But none of 'em got through the curtain of fire;          my hurry call died with the man.     Then Runner McGee said he'd try to get through.          I hated to order the kid     On his mission of death; thought he'd never get          by, but somehow or other he did.      \"Yes, he's dead. Died an hour after bringing          us word that the chief was aware of our          plight,     An' for us to hang on to the ditch that we held;          the reserves would relieve us at night.     Then we stuck to our trench an' we stuck to our          guns; you know how you'll fight when          you know     That new strength is coming to fill up the gaps.          There's heart in the force of your blow.      \"It wasn't till later I got all the facts. They          wanted McGee to remain.     They begged him to stay. He had cheated death          once an' was foolish to try it again.     'R. I. P. are my orders,' he answered them all,          'an' back to the boys I must go;     Four of us died comin' out with the news. It          will help them to know that you know.'\"             The Girl He Left Behind       We used to think her frivolous--you know how          parents are,     A little quick to see the faults and petty flaws          that mar     The girl their son is fond of and may choose          to make his wife,     A little overjealous of the one who'd share his          life;     But the girl he left behind him when he bravely          marched away     Has blossomed into beauty that we see and need          to-day.      She was with us at the depot, and we turned our          backs a-while,     And her eyes were sad and misty, though she          tried her best to smile.     Then she put her arm round mother, and it          seemed to me as though     They just grew to love each other, for they          shared a common woe.     Now she often comes to see us, and it seems          to me we find     A heap of solid comfort in the girl he left behind.      \"She's so sensible and gentle,\" mother said last          night to me,     \"The kind of girl I've often wished and prayed          his wife would be.     And I like to have her near us, for she understands          my sighs     And I see my brave boy smiling when I look into          her eyes.\"     Now the presence of his sweetheart seems to fill          our home with joy.     She's no longer young and flighty--she's the          girl who loves our boy.             A Patriotic Creed       To serve my country day by day     At any humble post I may;     To honor and respect her Flag,     To live the traits of which I brag;     To be American in deed     As well as in my printed creed.      To stand for truth and honest toil,     To till my little patch of soil     And keep in mind the debt I owe     To them who died that I might know     My country, prosperous and free,     And passed this heritage to me.      I must always in trouble's hour     Be guided by the men in power;     For God and country I must live,     My best for God and country give;     No act of mine that men may scan     Must shame the name American.      To do my best and play my part,     American in mind and heart;     To serve the flag and bravely stand     To guard the glory of my land;     To be American in deed,     God grant me strength to keep this creed.             His Room       His room is as it used to be       Before he went away,     The walls still keep the pennants he       Brought home but yesterday.     The picture of his baseball team       Still holds its favored spot,     And oh, it seems a dreadful dream       This age of shell and shot!      His golf clubs in the corner stand;       His tennis racket, too,     That once the pressure of his hand       In times of laughter knew     Is in the place it long has kept       For us to look upon.     The room is as it was, except       The boy, himself, has gone.      The pictures of his girls are here,       Still smiling as of yore,     And everything that he held dear       Is treasured as before.     Into his room his mother goes       As usual, day by day,     And cares for it, although she knows       Our boy is far away.      We keep it as he left it, when       He bade us all good-bye,     Though I confess that, now and then,       We view it with a sigh.     For never night shall thrill with joy       Nor day be free from gloom     Until once more our soldier boy       Shall occupy his room.             Envy       It's a bigger thing you're doing than the most of us have done;     We have lived the days of pleasure; now the gray days have begun,     And upon your manly shoulders fall the burdens of the strife;     Yours must be the sacrifices of the trial time of life.     Oh, I don't know how to say it, but I'll never think of you     Without wishing I were sharing in the work you have to do.      I have never known a moment that was fraught with real care,     Save the hurts and griefs of sorrow that all mortals have to bear;     With the gay and smiling marchers I have tramped on pleasant ways,     And have paid with feeble service for the gladness of my days.     But to you has come a summons, yours are days of sacrifice,     And for all life has of sweetness you must pay a bitter price.      Men have fought and died before me, men must fight and die to-day,     I have merely taken pleasures for which others had to pay;     I have been a man of laughter, there's no path my feet have made,     I have merely been a marcher in life's gaudy dress parade.     But you wear the garb of service, you have splendid deeds to do,     You shall sound the depths of manhood, and my boy, I envy you.             For Your Boy and Mine       Your dream and my dream is not that we shall rest,     But that our children after us shall know life at its best;     For all we care about ourselves--a crust of bread or two,     A place to sleep and clothes to wear is all that we'd pursue.     We'd tramp the world on sunny days, both light of heart and mind,     And give no thought to days to come or days we leave behind.      Your dream and my dream is not that we shall play,     But that our children after us shall tread a merry way.     We brave the toil of life for them, for them we clamber high,     And if 'twould spare them hurt and pain, for them we'd gladly die.     If we had but ourselves to serve, we'd quit the ways of pride     And with the simplest joys of earth we'd all be satisfied.      The best for them is what we dream. Our little girls and boys     Must know the finest life can give"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16632"],["title","Over Here (#3)"],["body","comforts and of joys.     They must be shielded well from woe and kept secure from care,     And if we could, upon our backs, their burdens we would bear.     And so once more we rise to-day to face the battle zone     That those who follow us may know the Flag that we have known.      Your dream and my dream is not that we shall live;     The greatest joys we hope to claim are those that we shall give.     We face the heat and strife of life, its battle and its toil     That those who follow us may know the best of freedom's soil.     And if we knew that by our death we'd keep that flag on high,     For your boy and my boy, how gladly we would die.             Soldierly       The glory of a soldier--and a soldier's not a saint--     Is the way he does his duty without grumbling or complaint;     His work's not always pleasant, but he does it rain or shine,     And he grabs a bit of glory when he's fighting in the line;     But the lesson that he teaches every day to me an' you     Is the way to do a duty that we do not like to do.      Any sort o' chap can whistle when his work is mostly fun;     A hundred want the pleasant jobs to every sturdy one     That'll grab the dreary duty an' the mean an' lowly task,     Or the drab an' cheerless service that life often has to ask;     But somebody has to do it, an' the test of me an' you     Is the way we face the labor that we do not like to do.      Now, it isn't very pleasant standin' guard out in the rain     But it's in the line o' duty, an' no soldier will complain,     An' there isn't any soldier but what sometimes hates his work     When the dress parade is over, an' perhaps he'd like to shirk,     But he's there to follow orders, not to pick an' choose his post,     An' he sometimes shines the finest at the job he hates the most.      Let's be soldiers in the struggle, let's be loyal through and through;     Life is going to give us duties that perhaps we'll hate to do.     There'll be little sacrifices that we will not like to make,     There'll be many tasks unpleasant that will fall to us to take.     An' although we all would rather do the work that brings applause,     Let's forget our whims and fancies an' just labor for the cause.             The Alarm       Get off your downy cots of ease,       There's work that must be done.     Great danger's riding on the seas.       The storm is coming on.     Don't think that it will quickly pass.       Who smiles at distant fate,     And waits until it strikes, alas!       Has roused himself too late.      Who thinks the fight will end before       The need of him arrives,     Is lengthening this brutal war       And costing many lives.     For over us that storm shall break       Ere many weeks have fled,     And we shall pay for our mistake       In fields of mangled dead.      Be ready when the foe shall near,       Be there to strike him hard;     Let us, though he be miles from here,       Be standing now on guard.     To-morrow's victories won't be won       By pluck that we display     To-morrow when the foe comes on,       But by our work to-day.             The Boy Enlists       His mother's eyes are saddened, and her cheeks          are stained with tears,     And I'm facing now the struggle that I've          dreaded through the years;     For the boy that was our baby has been changed          into a man.     He's enlisted in the army as a true American.      He held her for a moment in his arms before          he spoke,     And I watched him as he kissed her, and it          seemed to me I'd choke,     For I knew just what was coming, and I knew          just what he'd done!     'Another little mother had a soldier for a son.      When we'd pulled ourselves together, and the          first quick tears had dried,     We could see his eyes were blazing with the fire          of manly pride;     We could see his head was higher than it ever          was before,     For we had a man to cherish, and our baby was          no more.      Oh, I don't know how to say it! With the sorrow          comes the joy     That there isn't any coward in the make-up of          our boy.     And with pride our hearts are swelling, though          with grief they're also hit,     For the boy that was our baby has stepped          forth to do his bit,             The Mother Faith       Little mother, life's adventure calls your boy away,     Yet he will return to you on some brighter day;     Dry your tears and cease to sigh, keep your mother smile,     Brave and strong he will come back in a little while.      Little mother, heed them not--they who preach despair--     You shall have your boy again, brave and oh, so fair!     Life has need of him to-day, but with victory won,     Safely life shall bring to you once again your son.      Little mother, keep the faith: not to death he goes;     Share with him the joy of worth that your soldier knows.     He is giving to the Flag all that man can give,     And if you believe he will, surely he will live.      Little mother, through the night of his absence long,     Never cease to think of him--brave and well and strong;     You shall know his kiss again, you shall see his smile,     For your boy shall come to you in a little while.             Thoughts of a Soldier       Since men with life must purchase life       And some must die that more may live,     Unto the Great Cashier of strife       A fine accounting let me give.     Perhaps to-morrow I shall stand       Before his cage, prepared to buy     New splendor for my native land:       Oh, God, then bravely let me die!      If after I shall fall, shall rise       A fairer land than I have known,     I shall not grudge my sacrifice,       Although I pay the price alone.     If still more beautiful to see       The Stars and Stripes o'er men shall wave     And finer shall my country be,       To-morrow let me find my grave.      To-night life seems so fair and sweet,       Yet tyranny is stalking here,     And hate and lust and foul deceit       Hang heavy on the atmosphere.     Injustice seeks to throttle right,       And laughter's stifled to a sigh.     If death can take so great a blight       From human lives, then let me die.      If death must be the cost of life,       And freedom's terms are human souls,     Into the thickest of the strife       Then let me go to pay the tolls.     I would enrich my native land,       New splendor to her flag I'd give,     If where I fall shall freedom stand,       And where I die shall freedom live.      To-morrow death with me may trade;       Let me not quibble o'er the price;     But may I, once the bargain's made,       With courage meet the sacrifice.     If happiness for ages long       My little term of life can buy,     God, for my country make me strong;       To-morrow let me bravely die.             The Flag on the Farm       We've raised a flagpole on the farm       And flung Old Glory to the sky,     And it's another touch of charm       That seems to cheer the passer-by,     But more than that, no matter where       We're laboring in wood and field,     We turn and see it in the air,       Our promise of a greater yield.     It whispers to us all day long     From dawn to dusk: \"Be true, be strong;     Who falters now with plough or hoe     Gives comfort to his country's foe.\"      It seems to me I've never tried       To do so much about the place,     Nor been so slow to come inside,       But since I've got the Flag to face,     Each night when I come home to rest       I feel that I must look up there     And say: \"Old Flag, I've done my best,       To-day I've tried to do my share.\"     And sometimes, just to catch the breeze,     I stop my work, and o'er the trees     Old Glory fairly shouts my way:     \"You're shirking far too much to-day!\"      The help have caught the spirit, too;       The hired man takes off his cap     Before the old red, white and blue,       Then to the horses says: \"Giddap!\"     And starting bravely to the field       He tells the milkmaid by the door:     \"We're going to make these acres yield       More than they've ever done before.\"     She smiles to hear his gallant brag,     Then drops a curtsey to the Flag,     And in her eyes there seems to shine     A patriotism that is fine.      'We've raised a flagpole on the farm       And flung Old Glory to the sky,     We're far removed from war's alarm,       But courage here is running high.     We're doing things we never dreamed       We'd ever find the time to do;     Deeds that impossible once seemed       Each morning now we hurry through.     The Flag now waves above our toil     And sheds its glory on the soil,     And boy and man look up to it     As if to say: \"I'll do my bit!\"             The Mother on the Sidewalk       The mother on the sidewalk as the troops are marching by     Is the mother of Old Glory that is waving in the sky.     Men have fought to keep it splendid, men have died to keep it bright,     But that flag was born of woman and her sufferings day and night;     'Tis her sacrifice has made it, and once more we ought to pray     For the brave and loyal mother of the boy that goes away.      There are days of grief before her, there are hours that she will weep,     There are nights of anxious waiting when her fear will banish sleep;     She has heard her country calling and has risen to the test,     And has placed upon the altar of the nation's need, her best.     And no man shall ever surfer in the turmoil of the fray     The anguish of the mother of the boy who goes away.      You may boast men's deeds of glory, you may tell their courage great,     But to die is easier service than alone to sit and wait,     And I hail the little mother, with the tear-stained face and grave     Who has given the Flag a soldier--she's the bravest of the brave.     And that banner we are proud of, with its red and blue and white     Is a lasting tribute holy to all"]]]
