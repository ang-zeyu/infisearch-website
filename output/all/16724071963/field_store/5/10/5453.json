(#5)"],["body","ate, alack! \"You've been a time, I must say, Ned, In finishing your old war.\" Said    The girl I left behind me.  I flung a song up to the skies.    For battles gods designed me. I think of Fifi's laughing eyes, And Nami, dusk, but sweet and wise, And chortle in my heart to find How very far I've left behind-    The girl I left behind me    HOW HERMAN WON THE CROSS  ONCE in a blue eternity they gave us      dabs of rum To close the seams 'n' keep the flume in      liquor-tight condition; But, soft 'n' sentimental, when the long, cold      evenin's come, I'd dream me nibs was dronking' to the height      of his ambition, With rights of suction over all the breweries      there are, Where barrels squat, like Brahma gods, in      Mother Hardy's bar.  I had me fit of longin' on the night the Ger-      mans came, All breathin' lioke a gas attack. The air      was halcholic. We smelt 'em in the darkness, 'n' our rage      went up in flame. It was envy, squealin' envy, put the ginger      in the frolic. We shot 'em full of spelter, then went over it      to spite The swines what drunk the liquor that was      ours by common right.  \"If this ain't stopped, 'n' quick,\" sez we,      \"there won't be left a drop To celebrate the vict'ry when we capture      their position.\" I'm prowlin' blind, when sharp there comes a      fond, familiar plop- Swung round a post, a German in a pitiful      condition Looms over me. He's sprung a cork, and      shales a flask on high, 'N' sings of beer that touchin' it would make      a butcher cry.  Sez he: \"Berloffed kamarid, you haf some      drinks mit you.\" I meant to spike him where he waved,      but altered me intention. 'N' \"If you put it thus,\" sez I, \"I don't      care if I do.\" We had a drink together. There's a tem-      por'y suspension Of hostilities to sample contraband 'n' other      stuff In the enemy's possession. Which I think      he's had enough.  That Hun had thirty pockets, 'n' he'd stowed      a flask in each, 'N' presently I'm thinkin' I could love him      like a brother. He's talkin' fond 'n' friendly in outlandish      parts of speech. \"You're prisoner of war,\" I sez; 'n' then      we had another. Ten flasks he pours into his hat, 'n' fills it      to the brim, 'N' weeps 'n' sez his frau she will be waitin'      up for him.  We drink each other's health, 'n' know no      henmity nor fear. I see I've got to pinch him, but he's out to      do his div. in, 'N' don't care if he don't go home till day-      light doth appear. Sez he: \"I pud you home to bed upside dot      'ouse you live in.\" He shakes his finger in me eye: \"Mein friendt,      you're preddy trunk!\" Then arm in arm through No Man's land we      does a social bunk.  There's Fear afoot. Comes more than once      the glug of sudden death. We're rockin' fine 'n' careless where the      rifle fire is breakin', 'N' singin' most uproar'ous, in the bomb's      disgustin' breath, Of girls, 'n' drink, 'n' cheerful sprees, 'n'      'Herman thinks he's takin' A cobber home to somewhere in an subbub      damp 'n' dim, Whereas I know fer certain it is me is takin'      him.  Somehow, sometime, I lands him where he's      safely put to bed. I wake nex' day, 'n' holy smoke! I'm pri-      soner with the German. Me mouth is like an ashpan, there's hot fish-      bolts in me head, 'N' through the barb-wire peerin' is me      foreigh cobber 'Erman. \"Ve capdure each lasd nighd,\" sez he \"you      home haf bring me, boss.\" For bravery in takin' me, he got the Iron      Cross!    WHEN TOMMY CAME MARCHING HOME.  DEVINE came back the other day.    We'd planned a great home-comin'. No long trombone we had to play,    No fine, heroic drummin'. With two sticks and a milk-can Borne    Put up a martial clatter, While Carter blew a bullock-horn Says Tom Devine, with healthy scorn;    \"Gorstruth! what is the matter?\"  We set three colored petticoats    From Baker's chimneys blowin' ('Tis not the bravest flag that floats,    Yet 'twas the finest goin'); We cheered our hero all we knew,    No song of praise neglectin', To show our pride as he limped through He merely spat and snorted, \"Who    \"The deuce are yous expectin'?\"  They lured him to my shop somehow,    And sued for news of battle. Says Tom: \"Who rides the mail track now?   Who herdin' Stringer's cattle?\" A dint the Turk put in his head.    He covers with a ringlet. He'd won a medal, so we read. \"I might 'ave 'ad it pinched,\" he said-    \"I've sewn it in my singlet!\"  Says Cole \"But, 'struth, you must 'ave seen    A fearful swag of scrappin'.\" And Tom agrees \"Where men are keen    That's pretty sure to 'appen. One night a little bloke from Hay    Who plugged a Pentridge warder Got such a doin' that at day, Amazed, they ticked him for a stray    Distinguished Service Order.  \"Then Sydney Bob was rather vexed    With Green--who'd pinched his braces, That was 'continued in our next'    In half a score of places. McCubbin threw his grub at Lea    (You know how sticky stew is); They fought till neither man could see. You talk of fight--Gorstrike me, we    Saw stacks of it at Suez!\"    HELLO, SOLDIER!  BACK again 'n' nothin' missin' barrin'    arf a hand, Where an Abdul bit me, chokin' in the Holy    Land. 'Struth, they got some dirty fighters in the    Moslem pack, Bull-nosed slugs their sneakin' snipers spat    ters in yer back Blows a gapin' sort iv pit in What a helephant could sit in. Bounced their bullets, if yeh please, Like the 'oppers in a cheese, Off me rubber pelt in droves, Moppin' up the other coves. So here's me once more at large in Bay-street, Port, a bloomin' Sargin'. \"Cri, it jumbo.\" \"Have a beer.\" \"Wot-o, Anzac; you're a dear.\"  Back once more on Moley's corner, loafin' like    a dook; Back on Bourke, me livin' image, not a    slinkin' spook; Solid ez the day I started, medals on me    chest, Switchin' with me pert melacca, swankin'    with the best Where the little wimmen's flowin', With their veils 'n' ribbons blowin'- See their eyes of bloo 'n' brown Butterflyin' 'bout the town! Back at 'ome-oh, 'struth, it's good! Long, cold lagers from the wood, Ev'ry cobber jumpin' at you, Strangers duckin' in to bat you- \"Good ole Jumbo, how're you?\" \"'Ello, soldier, howja do?\"  Back at Grillo's where the nigger googs his    whitey eyes, Plucks his black ole greasy banjo while the    cod-steak fries; Fish 'n' chips, a pint iv local, and the tidy    girl Dancin' glad attendance on yeh 'zif yeh was    an earl; Trailin' round the blazin' city, Feelin' all content 'n' pretty, Where the smart procession goes, Prinked 'n' polished to the shows, One among the happy drive- 'Sworth the world to be alive! Dames ez smilin' ez a mother, Ev'ry man ver fav'rit brother: \"'Ello, Jumbo, how is it ?\" \"Arr there, soldier! Good 'n' fit?\"  Takin' hozone at St. Kilder's good enough    for me, Seein' Summer and the star-blink simmer in    the sea; Cantin' up me bloomin' cady, toyin' with a    cig., Blowin' out me pout a little, chattin' wide 'n'    big When there's skirt around to skite to. Say, 'oo has a better right to? Done me bit 'n' done it well, Got the tag iv plate to tell; Square Gallipoli surviver, With a touch iv Colonel's guyver. \"Sargin' Jumbo, good ole son!\" \"Soldier, soldier, you're the one!\"  Back again, a wounded hero, moochin' up 'n'    down, Feelin' 'sthough I'd got a fond arf-Nelson on    the town; Never was so gay, so 'elp me, never felt so    kind; Fresh from 'ell a paradise ain't very hard to    find. After filth, 'n' flies, 'n' slaughter Fat brown babies in the water, Singin' people on the sand Makes a boshter Happy Land! War what toughened hone 'n' hide Turned a feller soft inside! Great it is, the 'earty greetin's, Friendly digs, 'n' cheerful meetin's \"'Ello, Jumbo, howja do?\" \"Soldier, soldier, how're you?\"    THE MORALIST.  THREE other soldier blokes 'n' me packed    'ome from foreign lands; Bit into each the God of Battles' everlastin'    brands. They limped in time, 'n' coughed in tune, 'n'    one was short an ear, 'N' one was short a tier of ribs 'n' all was    short of beer.      I speaks up like a temp'rance gent,      But ever since the sky was bent The thirst of man 'as never yet bin squenched    with argument.  Bill's skull was welded all across, Jim 'ad an    eye in soak, Sam 'obbled on a patent leg, 'n' every man    was broke; They sang a song of \"Mother\" with their faces    titled up. Says Bill-o: \"'Ere's yer 'eroes, sling the    bloomin' votive cup!      We got no beer, the soup was bad-      Now oo will stand the soldier lad The swag of honest liquor that for years he    hasn't 'ad?\"  Sez I: \"Respeck yer uniform! Remember    oo you are!\" They'd pinched a wicker barrer, 'arf a pram    'n' 'arf a car. In this ole Bill-o nestled 'neath a blanket, on    his face A someone's darlin' sorter look, a touch iv    boy'ood's grace.      The gentle ladies stopped to 'ear,      'N' dropped a symperthetic tear, A dollar or a deener for the pore haff1ict    dear.  The others trucked the wounded to a hentrance    up a lane. I sez: \"Sich conduck's shameful!\" Bill-o   took to ease his pain One long 'un and another. The conductor    picked his brand; The gripman lent his countenance to wot he    'ad in 'and.      And when they moved their stand 'twas        Sam      Lay pale 'n' peaceful in the pram, 'N' twenty flappers stroked his paw, 'n' said    he was a lamb.  The gathered in the tokens and they blooed    'em as above, While Jim-o done the hinvalid 'oom Sammy    had to shove. Sez I: \"No noble 'eroes what's bin fightin'    for their king Should smirch theirselves by doin' this dis-    'onerable thing.\"      But fine old gents 'n' donahs prim      They stopped 'n' slid the beans to Jim. You betcher life I let 'im hear just what I    though of 'im.  Nine, g.m. at St. Kilder, saw the finish of the    prowl. Each 'ad his full-'n'-plentv, and was blowin'    in the tow'l. As neither bloke cud stand alone, they leaned    'n' argufied Which was the patient sufferer oo's turn it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16904"],["title","'Hello, Soldier!'

Afore a    push the three Got scrappin', vague 'n' foolish, which the    cripple boy should be. Sam slips his scientific leg, 'n' flings it in the    drain- \"I'll auto 'ome,\" he sez, \"or never see me    'ome again.\"      But I am thinkin' 'ard oo he      Tucked 'elpiess in the pram might be. Comes sudden reckerlection. Great Gohan-    ners, it is me!    REPAIRED  HAULED I was from out the tip    Fritz made with his demonstration, All broke up, a fractured hip In me Darby Kell a rip    Settn' up a cool sensation    Like excessive ventilation  One 'and cluttered up a treat-    On me oath you wouldn't know it From a 'andsome plate of meat. They had sorter pied me feet,    And a bullet of the foe hit    Where no decent bloke could show it.  'Arf a year they've botched me now;    Ev'ry scientific schemer In the cor' has faked me prow, Soled 'n' heeled a bloke somehow-    Gawd, the last one was a screamer.    Wirin' up me flamin' femur!  Comes a guy and pipes you square,   Gogglin' at you through his glasses, Swings you in the barber's chair, Tilts you this end up with care,    Lets you have a whiff of gasses    Chattin' off-hand with the lasses.  Then he slices clean 'n' swift,    Like a cobbler cuts his leather, Gives the splintered knob a lift- S'elp me tater, it's a gift    How they glues you all together,    Sayin' it's bin nicer weather!  Surgeon wipes his 'ands, a verse    Chort1e softly as he pitches Probes and sponges to the nurse, Thinks the lunch might have bin worse;    Close your little gap he hitches,    Whistlin' as he jabs the stitches.  I'm caught in with fiddle-strings,    Stuck about with bits 'n' patches, Fixed with ligatures 'n' springs, Lath 'n' plastered, swung in slings    Skewered with little wooden matches,    Hung with hinges, knobs 'n' latches.  Till I lay behind me screen,    Serious 'n' sober one day, Satisfied 'n' all serene, 'Arf a man 'n' 'arf machine    What they winds up ev'ry Monday    'N' it tilts all ways by Sunday.  'Ome again I'll come, a neat,    Semi-autymatic loafer, Number up, 'n' all complete, Creakin' round on Collins Street,    With a licence (which I'll owe for)    My own car and my own shofer!    OUT OF KHAKI.  I SLUNG me khaki suit to-day.    Civilian now front heel to chin    I 'op round on a single shin; At home in peace I'm bound to stay. 'N' so they've took me duds away.    It 'urt like strippin' off me skin!  I put it on three years ago,    The ole brown rig. There wasn't then    A prouder chicken in the pen. Jist twenty turned, me nibs you'd know For how I give me chest a throw,    A man among the best of men.  Me little no the touch I give,    Me chin's ez solid ez a rock,    'N' level with the Town 'All clock, A five-inch grin across me chiv. \"Lor' love us, this is how to live,\"    Sez I, 'n' felt I owned the Block.  Glad eyes was ever on the lurk,    'N' little 'earts was thumpin' warm    For nippers trainin' with the swarm To swat ole Kaiser Bill, or work A toe-hold on the heathen Turk.    Fair dink, I loved the uniform!  I soused mine in the brine that day    When Tophet spilt, 'n' in the roar    Of shells that split the sea 'n' tore Our boats to chips, we broke any Up through the pelt of leaden spray,    'N' got our first real taste of war.  They shot me tunic all to rags;    Then in the perpendic'lar spree    Me trousers wore off to the knee. The right-abouts of many bags Was ground off in the dust 'n' crags    A-sittin' in Gallipoli.  I wore the khaki on the Somme-    Most time 'twas jist a coat of mud;    I once come through the battle scud Stripped mother-naked by a bomb; 'N' once it' took its color from    Me own 'n' one good cobber's blood.  They cheered the khaki through the street    When we come home with pipers gay,    But now I'm jist a bloke in grey. Harf-lost, lob-sided, incomplete, It's nothin' but me spook you'll meet,    Ghost-walkin' in the light o' day.    THE SINGLE-HANDED TEAM  WE'RE more than partners, Ned 'n' me,    Two sections permanently righted. Yiv seen us on the mooch, maybe,    Like remnants lovin'ly united. Ned's only got one stump, the left;    By 'appy chance I've got its brother, Of his two dukes he's been bereft; My left was mauled, 'n' had to go, It fortunitly 'appens though,    I kept the other.  Ned lost one ear, the left, 'n' struth,    He dropped the correspondin' weeper. A Hun he crooled me lovely youth    By bombin' out me right 'and peeper. He done a guy too with me ear, The right, 'n' now I dunno whether 'Twas Fate's intention, butt it's clear When trimmed each as the other's mate 'Twas up to us two, soon or late,    To get together.  'Board ship there's me like arf a peach,    'N' Ned's the other arf, but soon it Strikes' Bill Carkeek that side by each   We makes a satisfact'rv unit. A 'andy cobber on the ship    Fakes up for us a set of clutches That damps us firmly hip to hip. In seven minutes we can peg The mile out on a timber leg    'N' two steel crutches.  We now go halves, like Si'mese twins,    'N' as a team I hold we're bosker-- The blighter on the street that grins    Has got to deal with Edwin-Oscar. At balls we two-step, waltz, 'n' swing,    'N' proppin' walls no one has seen us. When at the bar I never ring The double on ole Ned. For both One hand must serve, 'n', on me oath,  It's fair between us.  We jolt one knife 'n' fork, 'n' find    One horse enough for both to ride on, And neither feller rides behind.   Some sez we put a pile of side on. Well, where's the single-handed brace    Will take us on? We'll put the peg in, Train fine, 'n' jump, or box, or race, Or wrestle them; 'n' more than that To clinch a match, so 'elp me cat,    We'll throw a leg in!  He's five feet eight, I'm little less;    He's Roman, I'm a sort of Proddy; But no sectarian bitterness    Will disunite this sec'lar body-- We're hitched for good, we're two in one.    Our taste's the same, from togs to tipple. But, straight, it makes me sad, ole son, To think if he should croak or me, The pore bloke what is left might be    A bloomin' cripple.    BATTLE PASSES  A QUAINT old gabled cottage sleeps be-      tween the raving hills. To right and left are livid strife, but on the      deep, wide sills The purple pot-flowers swell and glow, and      o'er the walls and eaves Prinked creeper steals caressing hands, the      poplar drips its leaves.        Within the garden hot and sweet        Fair form and woven color meet, While down the clear, cool stones, 'tween      banks with branch and blossom gay, A little, bridged, blind rivulet goes touching      out its way.  Peace lingers hidden from the knife, the tear-      ing blinding shell, Where falls the spattered sunlight on a lichen-      covered well. No voice is here, no fall of feet, no smoke lifts      cool and grey, But on the granite stoop a cat blinks vaguely      at the day.        From hill to hill across the vale        Storms man's terrific iron gale; The cot roof on a brooding dove recks not the      distant gun. A brown hen scolds her chickens chasing      midges in the sun.  Now down the eastward slope they come. No call of life, no beat of drum, But stealthily, and in the green, Low hid, with rifle and machine, Spit hate and death; and red blood flows To shame the whiteness of the rose.  Crack followes crash; the bestial roar Of gastly and insensate war Breaks on the cot. A rending stoke, The red roof springs, and in the smoke And spume of shells the riven walls Pile where the splintered elm-tree spawls.  From westward, streaming down hill, Shot-ravaged, thinned, but urgent still, The brown, fierce, blooded Anzacs sweep, And Hell leaps a up. The lilies weep Strange crimson tears. Tight-lipped and mute, The grim, gaunt soldiers stab and shoot.  It passes. Frantic, fleeing death, Wild-eyed, foam-flecked and every breath A  labored agony, like deer That feel the hounds' keen teeth, appear The Prussian men, and, wild to slay The hunters press upon their prey.  Cries fade and fitful shots die down. The      Tumbled ruin now Smoke faintly in the summer light, and lifts      The trodden bough. A sigh stirs in the trampled green, and held      And tainted red The rill creeps o'er a dead man's face and      steals along its bed.        One deep among the lilacs thrown        Shock all the stillness with a moan. Peace like the snowflake lights again where      utter silence lies, And softly with white finger-tips she seals a      soldier eyes.    THE LETTERS OF THE DEAD.  A LETTER came from Dick to-day;    A greeting glad he sends to me. He tells of one more bloody fray-- Of how with bomb and rifle they    Have put their mark for all to see    Across rock-ribbed Gallipoli.  \"How are you doing? Hope all's well,    I in great nick, and like the work. Though there may be a brimstone smell, And other pungent hints of Hell,    Not Satan's self can make us shirk    Our task of hitting up the Turk.  \"You bet old Slacks is not half bad    He knows his business in a scrim. He gets cold steel, or we are glad To stop him with a bullet, lad.    Or sling a bomb his hair to trim;    But, straight, we throw no mud at him.  \"He fights and falls, and comes again,    And knocks our charging lines about. He's game at heart, and tough in grain, And canters through the leaded rain,    Chock full of mettle--not a doubt    'T will do us proud to put him out.  \"But that's our job; to see it through    We've made our minds up, come what may, This noon we had our work to do. The shells were dropping two by two;    We fairly felt their bullets play    Among our hair for half a day.  \"One clipped my ear, a red-hot kiss,    Another beggar chipped my shin. They pass you with a vicious hiss That makes you duck; but, hit or miss,    It isn't in the Sultan's skin    To shift Australia's cheerful grin.  \"My oath, old man, though "]]]
