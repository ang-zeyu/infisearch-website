On these occasions, the mother was pleased to observe that while the attachment between him and her daughter became more and more marked, the Lieutenant always manifested the most scrupulous respect for the wishes of her parents, and never breathed a word to her that he believed could occasion the slightest objection upon their part.  Besides these visits, the lovers found ready means for exchanging their expressions of affection through the faithful Huron, Oonomoo, who made stated journeys from Captain Prescott's mansion to his post.  On these occasions, he went loaded with missives from one party to another, carrying back as many as he brought.  He was a great favorite with the whites, who appreciated his chivalrous faithfulness and fidelity, and loaded him with many expressions of their esteem.  He had the reputation of being the fleetest runner, the most successful scout and best hunter in the West.  Volumes would be required to record all the exploits told of him--of the marvelous number of scalps which hung in his lodge, and of the many hair-breadth escapes he had had.  It was said he had a wife and child hid somewhere in the recesses of the forest, to whom he made stated visits, and whom his deadly enemies, the Shawnees, had sought in vain for years.  He was now about thirty-five years of age, and had been known as a scout and friend of the whites for full a dozen years.  Somewhat less than two years after the first meeting of Lieutenant Canfield with the daughter of Captain Prescott, the wife and eldest daughter of the latter made a journey of pleasure to a neighboring settlement.  Mary would have accompanied them, had she not received an intimation from Oonomoo that her lover proposed to make her a visit about that time.  She accordingly remained at home with the servants.  Two nights afterwards, when the darkness was almost impenetrable, a large war-party of Shawnees suddenly attacked the place.  The negroes had no time for defense, and only sought their own safety in flight. But one, however, escaped, the rest falling beneath the merciless tomahawk.  Mary Prescott was carried off a prisoner.     CHAPTER III.  OONOMOO AND THE SHAWNEES.     Through forty foes his path he made,   And safely reached the forest-glade.--SCOTT.   After parting from Hans Vanderbum, the Huron sped noiselessly through the woods, taking a direction that would lead him to a point on the river fully three hundred yards below where he had signaled the German. The stream making a bend there, he would thus escape the observation of the Shawnees along the bank, at the point where the fisherman had been engaged in his labors.  So silent, yet rapid, was the motion of Oonomoo, that his figure flitted through the rifts in the wood like a shadow.  His head projected slightly forward, in the attitude of acute attention, and his black, restless eyes constantly flitted from one point to the other, scarcely resting for a second upon any single object.  In his left hand he trailed his long rifle, while his right rested upon the buckhorn handle of the knife in his belt.  He had progressed a considerable distance thus, when the Huron's gait decreased very rapidly.  He was now in the vicinity of the river, where he had left his canoe drawn up on the bank.  It was necessary to reconnoiter thoroughly before venturing to approach it.  Accordingly, he halted.  The movement of the panther in approaching his foe was not more stealthy and cautious than was his.  At length, reaching the shelter of a tree, and cautiously peering around, the Huron caught sight of the stern of his canoe.  One glance and his dark eyes flashed fire!  The Shawnees had been there!  What sign caught the notice of Oonomoo?  What kindled the fire in his dark eye?  What caused one hand to close over his knife, and the other to grasp his rifle?  It was a sign of his enemy.  Too well the sagacious Huron knew that the Shawnee was lying in wait for him.  The canoe, which Oonomoo left behind him, during his interview with Hans Vanderbum, lay precisely as it was first deposited.  Not a surrounding limb, shrub or leaf had, so far as he could see, been disturbed since he left the spot.  And yet the evidence which presented itself to the eyes of the Indian was as palpable and unmistakable as would have been the appearance of enemies themselves.  Oonomoo had carefully drawn his bark canoe up the river-bank and concealed it as well as the circumstances would admit.  He had then deposited his long Indian paddle in it, leaving the blade projecting over the stern.  The paddle _was now several inches further to one side than it had been left by him_!  This was the entire evidence.  It was abundantly sufficient to satisfy the Huron.  He did not doubt for an instant.  His only uncertainty was in regard to the precise location of his foes.  A few minutes' observation satisfied him that they were not between the canoe and the river.  His course of action was accordingly determined.  It would have been the easiest matter in the world for him to have escaped by swimming the river; but as an opportunity for a contest of skill with his enemies was offered, he was too proud not to embrace it at once. Retreating several rods, he continued his way upstream in his usual cautious manner, until he had gone perhaps a furlong above his canoe, when he approached and entered the stream.  The Miami, at this point, was so heavily wooded, that it was impossible to pass close under its shore without entering the water.  Once within this and in a stooping position, a person would be invisible to any one on the same bank, although he could be plainly seen from the opposite shore.  Oonomoo now commenced his descent of the river with the intention of recovering his canoe.  This was necessarily a tedious and prolonged operation, as a single misstep, a slip or splash of the water might betray him to his enemies.  But, he was equal to the task, and never hesitated for a moment except to listen for some sign of his enemies.  The Shawnees, by the merest accident, had discovered the Huron's canoe and examined it.  Satisfied that it belonged to none of their tribe, and most probably had been left there by some hostile scout, they carefully allowed it to remain as they had found it, and endeavored to restore everything around to its natural position, so as not to arouse the suspicion of the owner upon his return.  This done, they withdrew and awaited with loaded rifles for his reappearance.  We have shown how a most trifling error in regard to the paddle placed the Huron on his guard.  It was perhaps a half-hour after Oonomoo had commenced his descent of the river, that the canoe, without any perceptible jar, slid an inch or two down the bank.  So quietly and cautiously was this effected, that, had the Shawnees been looking directly at it, their suspicion would not have been aroused.  Some ten or fifteen minutes later, the boat moved about the same distance further.  The expectant Shawnees, clutching their rifles, were listening anxiously for some sound that might indicate the approach of their foe, and paid little heed to the canoe itself.  Ever and anon, it retreated an inch or two down the bank in the same mysterious manner--going short distances and so very slowly that no one but a thoroughly suspicious Indian would have believed there was any human agency connected with it.  The canoe was fully an hour and a half in moving a single foot, during which time the Huron managed, by the most consummate skill, to sustain it in such a manner that the shrubbery and undergrowth around appeared to occupy relatively the same position that they did before it had been disturbed.  The river shore was only some twenty or thirty feet distant, and from where Oonomoo lay, the way was almost entirely clear to it, so that when he chose to make any sudden dash or movement, no hindering cause could possibly offer itself.  One of the Shawnees chanced to glance at the canoe.  At the same instant, his keen eye detected its changed position, imperceptible almost as it was.  With a guttural exclamation he arose and moved toward it, followed by his two companions.  They had taken scarcely a step, when they saw the boat slide swiftly forward several feet, and then suddenly rising to the perpendicular position, whisk off through the bush at a still more rapid rate.  Two twinkling moccasins, that looked as if they were its support, as they doubled over each other, fully explained to the Shawnees the cause of this singular scene.  With a loud yell, the three dashed forward, while the Huron ran at the top of his speed over the slight distance that lay between him and the river.  Reaching the shore, he changed the canoe from his rear to his front, and holding it like a shield above and before him.  With one foot in the edge of the water, he concentrated all his strength for the effort and leaped far out in the stream--the canoe falling with a loud splash perfectly flat upon the surface.  The impetus thus given caused it to shoot like an arrow for a long distance, when the Huron, inclining his body to the left, careened it so much, that his own person was concealed from any who might be upon the shore, while, by reaching his hand over into the current, he was enabled to use it as a paddle, and continue his onward motion.  Oonomoo was fully aware that the delicate structure of the canoe was no obstruction at all against a rifle-shot.  Accordingly, while descending the river, he had taken precaution to insure his safety, in case of such an occurrence as had now transpired.  A large, rotten limb, hardly the length of his own body, was carried with him.  At the moment of lifting the canoe from the ground, the limb was placed within it, and thus was carried back to the edge of the river.  Lying flat upon his face, this limb was about the thickness of the Huron's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16869"],["title","Oonomoo the Huron (#6)"],["body","st, and by skillfully balancing the boat, it was interposed directly between him and his foes.  The only parts of his person which possibly could be struck were his feet and the arm stretched over the side of the canoe. The former necessarily being in the stern, it was hardly probable that they would be wounded.  There was such risk of the arm that Oonomoo drew it within the boat for a few moments.  He had scarcely done so, when the reports of two rifles, and the peculiar zip of the bullets as they cut through the side of the canoe and buried themselves in the rotten wood, proved how wise was the precaution he had taken.  Quick as thought, the hand of the Huron was in the water again, where, as he vigorously used it, it flashed like some fish at play.  The Shawnees, who plainly discerned the two holes their bullets had made, could scarcely believe their daring foe had escaped injury.  But they were forced to believe he was still living from the fact that the canoe steadily progressed across and was not carried down-stream by the current.  The whoop of the Shawnees had been heard by their comrades further down the bank.  As the canoe reached the middle of the river, they caught a sight of it, and readily conjectured the true state of the case.  In a twinkling, two of their own were launched in pursuit. Discovering this, Oonomoo arose to the upright position, and dipping his paddle deep in the water, sent his boat forward with astonishing swiftness.  As it lightly touched the bank, he leaped ashore and pulled it up after him.  Then uttering a defiant yell, he turned, and to show the scorn in which he held the Shawnees, walked slowly and deliberately into the forest.  Once fairly beyond their sight, however, his pace quickened, and when the sun sunk low in the western horizon, he was many a mile from the Miami.     CHAPTER IV.  THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT AND CATO.     Suddenly rose from the South a light, as in autumn the blood-red   Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and o'er the horizon,   Titan-like, stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow,   Seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together.           --LONGFELLOW.   From a long distance the conflagration had been visible, its light throwing a red glare far up in the sky, and revealing the huge clouds that swept forward like crimson avalanches, while the surrounding trees glowed as if their branches were burning hot.  Those nearest had their bark blistered and their leaves curled and scorched from the intense heat.  A conflagration at night, when viewed from a distance, always seems awful in its sublimity.  There is something calculated to inspire terror in the illuminated dome of the heavens and the onward sweep of this fearful element, when viewed in a civilized country; but it is only in the wilderness, away from the abode of man, that such an exhibition partakes of all the elements of grandeur and terror.  The solitary hunter, as he stood upon the banks of some lonely stream, leaned on his rifle and gazed with a beating heart at the brilliant redness that lit up so much of the sky.  The beasts in their lair turned their glowing eyeballs toward the dreadful illumination, and stood transfixed with fear until its light died away; while the dark face of the vengeful Shawnee grew darker and more terrible as he gazed upon this work of his own hands.  A silence, deep and profound, rested like a pall upon the wilderness and remained there until darkness again held undisputed reign.  Lieutenant Canfield had seen the glowing light from a great distance, when its appearance was much like that of the moon as it comes up in the horizon.  Little did he suspect its true nature.  It was not until the next morning that he encountered Oonomoo, the Huron, who related the particulars of the attack of the Shawnee party upon the house of Captain Prescott and the capture of his daughter.  Had not the impulsive Lieutenant thus learned of his beloved's safety from massacre, had he not received the assurance of an immediate attempt for her recapture, there is no telling to what imprudent lengths he might have gone in his blind devotion to the young captive.  Oonomoo remained with him but a short time, when he departed on his mission to the Shawnee village, and the lover continued on toward the estate of Captain Prescott.  It was nearly noon when Lieutenant Canfield reached the place--now nothing but a mass of charred and blackened ruins.  Leaving his horse in the woods, he dismounted and examined the remains of the mansion and smaller buildings.  The ghastly corpses of the negroes still lay upon the ground, having been undisturbed, and with a feeling of heart-sickness the young soldier passed them by.  In his profession, he had witnessed many revolting sights, but none that affected him more than this.  He shuddered, as he reflected that the very barbarians who had wantonly inflicted his woe were the captors of the adored daughter of Captain Prescott, and that they had inflicted as shocking outrages even upon such defenseless captives as she.  Walking thus moodily forward, he was suddenly brought to a standstill by coming in front of an awkward, odd-looking structure, which excited his wonder in no small degree.  The charred remains of the logs of one of the buildings had been collected together and piled one above the other, so that they bore some resemblance to a rudely-fashioned oven. From the circumstances of the case, these must have been arranged in this manner subsequently to the visit of the Shawnees, and it was this fact which awakened the curiosity of the Lieutenant.  His first supposition was that it was the doings of the Huron.  But what reason could he have had for rearing such a structure?  What possible purpose could it serve him?  All at once it flashed upon the Lieutenant that it was the work of the Shawnees themselves, and he began to view the contrivance with some apprehension.  This feeling was considerably strengthened when he either heard or fancied he heard the movement of some one within it. Prudence dictated that he should place a little more distance between it and himself.  Accordingly he began to retreat, walking backward and keeping his gaze fixed upon it, ready for any demonstration from his concealed enemies.  Suddenly something within the hollow of the structure fell with a dull thump that nearly lifted the Lieutenant from his feet.  At the same moment he heard a suppressed growl, as if made by a caged bear.  He now began to feel more wonder than fear.  \"What in the name of creation is the meaning of that concern, and what sort of animal is caged in it?\" he muttered, staying his retreat.  The Lieutenant debated whether or not to approach and examine the interior of the odd-looking hut.  It seemed hardly possible that any human being could be within, although it was certain there was some living object there.  \"At any rate I'll stir him up,\" he concluded, resolutely approaching. The growls were now redoubled, and he really believed some four-footed animal was the cause of all the uproar.  \"It may be the Shawnees have attempted a little pleasantry after their bloody work, and caged up some poor creature within those logs,\" thought he.  \"I'll let him loose if such be the case.\"  He placed his hand upon the stump of a log nearest to him, when a thunderbolt appeared to have exploded before him.  He started back as though he had received an electric shock.  A perfect battery of howls was leveled against him, and for a moment his ears were stunned with the deafening uproar.  He determined, however, to solve the mystery. Giving the structure a push that brought it tumbling to the ground, he sprung back and held his rifle prepared for any foe, were he a four-footed or a two-footed one.  Instead of either, what was his amazement to see a negro, as black as midnight, emerge from the ruins, and cringe at his feet.  \"Oh, Mr. Injine, please don't shoot! please don't kill me!  Nice, good Mr. Injine, don't hurt me!  Please don't tomahawk poor Cato!  He never hurt an Injine in all his life.  Please don't!  Oh, don't!  don't! don't! boo-hoo! oo!-oo-oo!\"  \"Get up, get up, Cato, and don't make a fool of yourself,\" said the Lieutenant, recognizing in the frightened negro the favorite servant of Captain Prescott's family.  \"Oh, please don't hurt me!  Please don't kill poor Cato!  He never hurt good Injine in all his life!  Please, good, nice Mr. Injine, let me go, and I'll do anyt'ing you wants me to, and lubs you as long as I lib. Please, don't hurt poor nigger Cato,\" repeated the servant, fairly beside himself with terror.  \"If you don't want to be killed, get up,\" said the young officer, sternly enough to bring Cato to his senses; but only after he had been assisted by what he supposed to be a ferocious Indian, ready to brain him, was he enabled to rise and to keep his feet.  [Illustration: \"If you don't want to be killed, get up,\" said the young officer.]  \"Don't you know me, Cato?\" asked the Lieutenant, laughing heartily at the woe-begone appearance of the negro.  \"Hebens, golly! ain't you an Injine, Massa Canfield?\" he asked, his knees still shaking with terror.  \"Do I look like one?\"  \"Guess you isn't, arter all,\" added the negro, with more assurance. \"Hebens, golly!  _I ain't afeard_!\" he suddenly exclaimed, straightening up proudly.  \"Didn't t'ink Cato was afeard, Massa Canfield?\"  \"I must say that the circumstantial evidence of your cowardice is hard to resist.\"  The negro's eyes enlarged as he heard the large words of the soldier, and his looks showed that he had no idea of their meaning.  \"Doesn't t'ink I's _afeard_?\"  \"Why did you build such a looking concern as that?\"  \"Why I build dat?  To keep de rain off of me.\"  \"It hasn't rained at all for several days.\"  \"Know dat, but, den, expect maybe 'twill.  Bes' to be ready for it when _does_ come.\"  \"But, as there were no evidences of a storm coming very soon, why should you get"]]]
