This is the window by which the murderer escaped!” said Rouletabille.  “So they keep on saying, monsieur, so they keep on saying! But if he had gone off that way, we should have been sure to have seen him. We are not blind, neither Monsieur Stangerson nor me, nor the concierges who are in prison. Why have they not put me in prison, too, on account of my revolver?”  Rouletabille had already opened the window and was examining the shutters.  “Were these closed at the time of the crime?”  “And fastened with the iron catch inside,” said Daddy Jacques, “and I am quite sure that the murderer did not get out that way.”  “Are there any blood stains?”  “Yes, on the stones outside; but blood of what?”  “Ah!” said Rouletabille, “there are footmarks visible on the path--the ground was very moist. I will look into that presently.”  “Nonsense!” interrupted Daddy Jacques; “the murderer did not go that way.”  “Which way did he go, then?”  “How do I know?”  Rouletabille looked at everything, smelled everything. He went down on his knees and rapidly examined every one of the paving tiles. Daddy Jacques went on:  “Ah!--you can’t find anything, monsieur. Nothing has been found. And now it is all dirty; too many persons have tramped over it. They wouldn’t let me wash it, but on the day of the crime I had washed the floor thoroughly, and if the murderer had crossed it with his hobnailed boots, I should not have failed to see where he had been; he has left marks enough in Mademoiselle’s chamber.”  Rouletabille rose.  “When was the last time you washed these tiles?” he asked, and he fixed on Daddy Jacques a most searching look.  “Why--as I told you--on the day of the crime, towards half-past five--while Mademoiselle and her father were taking a little walk before dinner, here in this room: they had dined in the laboratory. The next day, the examining magistrate came and saw all the marks there were on the floor as plainly as if they had been made with ink on white paper. Well, neither in the laboratory nor in the vestibule, which were both as clean as a new pin, were there any traces of a man’s footmarks. Since they have been found near this window outside, he must have made his way through the ceiling of “The Yellow Room” into the attic, then cut his way through the roof and dropped to the ground outside the vestibule window. But--there’s no hole, neither in the ceiling of “The Yellow Room” nor in the roof of my attic--that’s absolutely certain! So you see we know nothing--nothing! And nothing will ever be known! It’s a mystery of the Devil’s own making.”  Rouletabille went down upon his knees again almost in front of a small lavatory at the back of the vestibule. In that position he remained for about a minute.  “Well?” I asked him when he got up.  “Oh! nothing very important,--a drop of blood,” he replied, turning towards Daddy Jacques as he spoke. “While you were washing the laboratory and this vestibule, was the vestibule window open?” he asked.  “No, Monsieur, it was closed; but after I had done washing the floor, I lit some charcoal for Monsieur in the laboratory furnace, and, as I lit it with old newspapers, it smoked, so I opened both the windows in the laboratory and this one, to make a current of air; then I shut those in the laboratory and left this one open when I went out. When I returned to the pavilion, this window had been closed and Monsieur and Mademoiselle were already at work in the laboratory.”  “Monsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson had, no doubt, shut it?”  “No doubt.”  “You did not ask them?”  After a close scrutiny of the little lavatory and of the staircase leading up to the attic, Rouletabille--to whom we seemed no longer to exist--entered the laboratory. I followed him. It was, I confess, in a state of great excitement. Robert Darzac lost none of my friend’s movements. As for me, my eyes were drawn at once to the door of “The Yellow Room”. It was closed and, as I immediately saw, partially shattered and out of commission.  My friend, who went about his work methodically, silently studied the room in which we were. It was large and well-lighted. Two big windows--almost bays--were protected by strong iron bars and looked out upon a wide extent of country. Through an opening in the forest, they commanded a wonderful view through the length of the valley and across the plain to the large town which could be clearly seen in fair weather. To-day, however, a mist hung over the ground--and blood in that room!  The whole of one side of the laboratory was taken up with a large chimney, crucibles, ovens, and such implements as are needed for chemical experiments; tables, loaded with phials, papers, reports, an electrical machine,--an apparatus, as Monsieur Darzac informed me, employeeed by Professor Stangerson to demonstrate the Dissociation of Matter under the action of solar light--and other scientific implements.  Along the walls were cabinets, plain or glass-fronted, through which were visible microscopes, special photographic apparatus, and a large quantity of crystals.  Rouletabille, who was ferreting in the chimney, put his fingers into one of the crucibles. Suddenly he drew himself up, and held up a piece of half-consumed paper in his hand. He stepped up to where we were talking by one of the windows.  “Keep that for us, Monsieur Darzac,” he said.  I bent over the piece of scorched paper which Monsieur Darzac took from the hand of Rouletabille, and read distinctly the only words that remained legible:  “Presbytery--lost nothing--charm, nor the gar--its brightness.”  Twice since the morning these same meaningless words had struck me, and, for the second time, I saw that they produced on the Sorbonne professor the same paralysing effect. Monsieur Darzac’s first anxiety showed itself when he turned his eyes in the direction of Daddy Jacques. But, occupied as he was at another window, he had seen nothing. Then tremblingly opening his pocket-book he put the piece of paper into it, sighing: “My God!”  During this time, Rouletabille had mounted into the opening of the fire-grate--that is to say, he had got upon the bricks of a furnace--and was attentively examining the chimney, which grew narrower towards the top, the outlet from it being closed with sheets of iron, fastened into the brickwork, through which passed three small chimneys.  “Impossible to get out that way,” he said, jumping back into the laboratory. “Besides, even if he had tried to do it, he would have brought all that ironwork down to the ground. No, no; it is not on that side we have to search.”  Rouletabille next examined the furniture and opened the doors of the cabinet. Then he came to the windows, through which he declared no one could possibly have passed. At the second window he found Daddy Jacques in contemplation.  “Well, Daddy Jacques,” he said, “what are you looking at?”  “That policeman who is always going round and round the lake. Another of those fellows who think they can see better than anybody else!”  “You don’t know Frederic Larsan, Daddy Jacques, or you wouldn’t speak of him in that way,” said Rouletabille in a melancholy tone. “If there is anyone who will find the murderer, it will be he.” And Rouletabille heaved a deep sigh.  “Before they find him, they will have to learn how they lost him,” said Daddy Jacques, stolidly.  At length we reached the door of “The Yellow Room” itself.  “There is the door behind which some terrible scene took place,” said Rouletabille, with a solemnity which, under any other circumstances, would have been comical.     CHAPTER VII. In Which Rouletabille Sets Out on an Expedition Under the Bed   Rouletabille having pushed open the door of “The Yellow Room” paused on the threshold saying, with an emotion which I only later understood, “Ah, the perfume of the lady in black!”  The chamber was dark. Daddy Jacques was about to open the blinds when Rouletabille stopped him.  “Did not the tragedy take place in complete darkness?” he asked.  “No, young man, I don’t think so. Mademoiselle always had a nightlight on her table, and I lit it every evening before she went to bed. I was a sort of chambermaid, you must understand, when the evening came. The real chambermaid did not come here much before the morning. Mademoiselle worked late--far into the night.”  “Where did the table with the night-light stand,--far from the bed?”  “Some way from the bed.”  “Can you light the burner now?”  “The lamp is broken and the oil that was in it was spilled when the table was upset. All the rest of the things in the room remain just as they were. I have only to open the blinds for you to see.”  “Wait.”  Rouletabille went back into the laboratory, closed the shutters of the two windows and the door of the vestibule.  When we were in complete darkness, he lit a wax vesta, and asked Daddy Jacques to move to the middle of the chamber with it to the place where the night-light was burning that night.  Daddy Jacques who was in his stockings--he usually left his sabots in the vestibule--entered “The Yellow Room” with his bit of a vesta. We vaguely distinguished objects overthrown on the floor, a bed in one corner, and, in front of us, to the left, the gleam of a looking-glass hanging on the wall, near to the bed.  “That will do!--you may now open the blinds,” said Rouletabille.  “Don’t come any further,” Daddy Jacques begged, “you may make marks with your boots, and nothing must be deranged; it’s an idea of the magistrate’s--though he has nothing more to do here.”  And he pushed open the shutter. The pale daylight entered from without, throwing a sinister light on the saffron-coloured walls. The floor--for though the laboratory and the vestibule were tiled, “The Yellow Room” had a flooring of wood--was covered with a single yellow mat which was large enough to cover nearly the whole room, under the bed and under the dressing-table--the only piece of furniture that remained upright.

CHAPTER I.  IN THE MATTO GROSSO.  The blood-red sun was sinking beyond the distant Geral Mountains, when a canoe, containing four white men and three natives, came to a halt a thousand miles from the mighty Amazon, in the upper waters of the Xingu River, near the great table-land of Matto Grosso.  It was hard work, forcing the long shallow boat against the rapid current of the stream, whose unknown source is somewhere among the famous diamond regions of Brazil.  It was plain sailing for three hundred leagues from the Amazon, from whose majestic volume the little party of explorers had turned southward more than a month before.  The broad sail, which was erected in the centre of the craft, swept it smoothly along over the narrowing bosom of the Xingu, between luxuriant forests and past tribes of strange-looking Indians, who stood on the banks staring wonderingly at the extraordinary beings, the like of which many of them had never seen before.  Occasionally the explorers put ashore, and, using only the language of signs, exchanged some of the beads and gaudy trinkets for the curious articles of the savages.  Endless varieties of fruit were so abundant that it was to be had for the simple trouble of plucking; while the timid natives stood in such awe of their visitors, that the thought of harming them never entered their minds.  But ominous changes were gradually noted by our friends, as they steadily ascended the mysterious stream.  At first the natives fled at their approach, and failed to understand the signs of comity, or were so distrustful of the strangers that they refused to meet their advances.  Fleeing into the woods or high hills, they peeped out from their coverts, uttering strange cries and indulging in grotesque gestures, the meaning of which could hardly be mistaken.  Had there been any misapprehension on the part of the visitors, there was none after several scores launched their arrows at the boat, as it glided away from the shore and up stream.  The aim was wild and no one was struck, but when Professor Ernest Grimcke, the sturdy, blue-eyed scientist of the party, picked up one of the missiles and carefully examined it, he made the disturbing announcement that it was tipped with one of the deadliest of known poisons.  The other members of this exploring party were Fred Ashman, a bright, intelligent American, four-and-twenty years of age; Jared Long, an attenuated, muscular New Englander in middle life, and Aaron Johnston, a grim, reserved but powerful sailor from New Bedford, who had spent most of his life on whaling voyages.  Professor Grimcke and Ashman were joint partners in the exploring enterprise, Long and Johnston being their assistants.  In addition, there were three native servants, or helpers, known as Bippo, Pedros and Quincal.  They had been engaged at Macapa, near the mouth of the Amazon.  They were rather small of size, the first-named being the most intelligent, and in that warm, tropical climate wore no clothing except a strip of native cloth around the loins.  Ashman had striven to teach them the use of firearms, but they could never overcome the terror caused by the jet of fire and the thunderous explosion when the things were discharged.  They, therefore, clung to their spears, which, having honest points, cannot be said to have been very formidable weapons in their hands, even though each native was able to throw them with remarkable deftness and accuracy.  The sail that had served the explorers so well, where the Xingu was broader and with a slower current, became useless, or at least proved unequal to the task of overcoming the force of the stream. Consequently they had recourse to the broad-bladed oars, with which they drove the canoe swiftly against the resisting river, cheered by the oft-repeated declaration of the Professor, whose spirits never flagged, that the harder it proved going up stream, the easier must it be in descending, and that the arrangement was much better than if the condition of affairs were reversed.  The most tiresome work came when they reached some place, where the falls or rapids compelled them to land, and, lifting the boat and its contents from the ground, carry it round the obstruction to the more favorable current above.  These portages varied in length from a few rods to a fourth of a mile, and the further the party advanced, the more frequent did they become.  \"We have gone far enough for to-night,\" said the Professor, as the prow of the boat was turned toward the left bank; \"we will go into camp and make ready for to-morrow.\"  A few minutes later, the bow of the canoe gently touched the dark sand of the shore.  Bippo, Pedros and Quincal understood their duty so well that, without suggestion from the others, they leaped into the shallow waters, ran a few steps, and, grasping the front of the craft, drew it so far upon the land that the others stepped out without so much as wetting the soles of their shoes.  This task was no more than finished, when the natives scattered in the forest, which came almost to the edge of the water, in quest of fuel. This of course was so abundant that the work was slight, but since Professor Grimcke and Fred Ashman paid them well for their services they were left to attend to that duty unassisted.  As the surroundings of the party were entirely new and strange, Grimcke proposed that while the evening meal was being prepared, they should find out, if it could be done, whether any unwelcome neighbors were likely to disturb them before morning.  After a brief consultation, it was decided that the Professor and Jared Long should make their way up the river, keeping close to shore, with the purpose of learning the extent of the rapids, while Ashman and the sailor, Johnston, should follow the clearly marked trail which led directly away from the stream and into the forest.  It was more than probable that one of the couples would come upon something worth knowing, and it was not unlikely that both would return with important information.  Twilight is of short duration in the low latitudes, and the wish of the four white men was to be back in camp at the end of an hour, by which time night would be fairly upon them.  But the moon was at its full and would serve them better than the twilight itself.  The German and New Englander, therefore, moved away from camp, following the course of the Xingu, while their two friends quickly vanished in the forest.  Each carried his repeating Winchester and his Smith & Wesson.  Ashman felt some misgiving because of the trail leading into the woods from a point so near the camp.  It seemed likely to have been worn by the inhabitants of some village near at hand, though it was possible that the innumerable feet of wild animals on their way to and from the river may have been the cause.  The upper waters of the Xingu are remarkably clear and pure, a fact which rendered the first theory most probable.  The explorers had landed in a dangerous region, as they were destined to learn very soon, and the experience of the couples who took routes at right angles to each other was of the most thrilling character.  It has been stated that the progress of the canoe had been checked, as was often the case before, by the rapids of the Xingu, which could be passed only by carrying the canoe and luggage to the smoother waters above.  It was apparent that the river frequently overflowed its banks, for immense quantities of driftwood lined both shores, while the vegetation had been swept away to that extent that a space of a dozen feet from the margin of the stream was comparatively free from it. Thus both parties found the travelling easy.  The rapids were a hundred yards wide, more or less, and, with such a steep incline, that the foamy waves dashed hither and thither and against each other with the utmost fury, sending the spray high in air and sweeping forward with such impetuosity that it seemed impossible for the strongest craft under the most skilful guidance to shoot them. The explorers studied them with great interest as they ascended the left bank.  It was inevitable that in a country with such excessive vegetable growth, every part of the Xingu should show much floating timber.  The logs which plunged through the rapids played all manner of antics. Sometimes they leaped high out of the waters, like immense sea monsters, the out-spreading limbs showing a startling resemblance to the arms of a drowning person mutely appealing for help.  Then a heavy trunk would strike a rock just below the surface, and the branches, dripping with spray, swept over in a huge semi-circle.  The roar and swirl suggested the whirlpool below the falls of Niagara, one of the most appalling sights in all nature.     CHAPTER II.  A TRIO OF ENEMIES.  At last, when the full moon was shining, the two men stood at the head of the rapids and surveyed their surroundings before setting out on their return to camp.  Both sides of the Xingu were lined by the dense forest, in which the vegetation is so luxuriant that it must be a source of never ending wonder to those who look upon it for the first time.  The river above made a sharp bend, shutting off the view so fully that from their position, it was impossible to tell how far they would be able to use the canoe without making another portage.  \"We haven't seen a person on our way here,\" remarked the Professor, calmly surveying the river and shores; \"and I hope Ashman will bring back a similar report, for we all need a full night's rest.\"  \"How is _that_?\"  Long touched the arm of his companion, as he asked the question, and pointed down stream in the direction of camp.  To the amazement of the "]]]
