They were as follows:--        RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR ON BOARD THE GERMAN AUXILIARY SHIP      \"HITACHI MARU\" DETAINED ENEMY SUBJECTS (d.e.s.).       1. Everybody on board is under martial law, and any offence      is liable to be punished by same.       2. All orders given by the Commander, First Officer, or any      of the German crew on duty are to be strictly obeyed.       3. After the order \"Schiff abblenden\" every evening at      sunset no lights may be shown on deck or through portholes,      etc., that are visible from outside.       4. The order \"Alle Mann in die Boote\" will be made known by      continuous ringing of the ship's bell and sounding of      gongs. Everybody hurries to his boat with the lifebelt and      leaves the ship. Everybody is allowed to take one small bag      previously packed.       5. Nobody is allowed to go on the boat deck beyond the      smoke-room. All persons living in first-class cabins are to      stay amidships, and are not allowed to go aft without      special permission; all persons living aft are to stay aft.       6. The Japanese crew is kept only for the comfort of the      one-time passengers, and is to be treated considerately, as      they are also d.e.s.       7. The d.e.s. are not allowed to talk with the crew.       At sea, October 6, 1917.                 Kommando S.M.H. _Hitachi Maru_,                                     C. ROSE,                               _Lt. z. See & Kommandant_.   Lieutenant Rose very kindly told me that as I was leaving the East for good and therefore somewhat differently situated from the other passengers, he would allow me to take in the lifeboat, in addition to a handbag, a cabin trunk packed with the articles from Siam I most wanted to save.  It was evident from this that the Germans intended sinking the ship if we came across a British or Allied war vessel. We were of course unarmed, as the Germans had removed the _Hitachi_ gun to the _Wolf_, but the German Captain anticipated no difficulty on this score, and assured me that it was the intention of the Commander of the _Wolf_ that we should be landed in a short time with all our baggage at a neutral port with a stone pier. We took this to mean a port in either Sumatra or Java, and we were buoyed up with this hope for quite a considerable time. But, alas, like many more of the assurances given to us, it was quite untrue.  There were now on board 131 souls, of whom twenty-nine were passengers. On Saturday, October 6th, the seaplane returned in the afternoon and remained about half an hour, when she again flew away. She brought a message of evidently great importance, for whereas it had been the intention of our Captain to sail away on the following afternoon, he weighed anchor the next morning and left the atoll. He had considerable trouble with the anchor before starting, and did not get away till nearly eight o'clock, instead of at daybreak. Evidently something was coming to visit the atoll; though it was certain nothing could be looking for us, as our capture could not then have been known, and there could have been no communication between the Maldives and Ceylon, or the mainland. Before and for some days after we sailed, the ship was cleaned and put in order, the cargo properly stowed, and the bunkers trimmed by the German crew, aided by some neutrals who had been taken prisoner from other ships. Some of the sailors among the prize crew were good enough to give us some pieces of the _Wolf's_ shrapnel found on the _Hitachi_, relics which were eagerly sought after by the passengers.  The passengers were now under armed guards, but were at perfect liberty to do as they pleased, and the relations between them and the German officers and crew were quite friendly. Deck games were indulged in as before our capture, and the German Captain took part in them. Time, nevertheless, hung very heavily on our hands, but many a pleasant hour was spent in the saloon with music and singing. One of the Australian prisoners was a very good singer and pianist, and provided very enjoyable entertainment for us. The Captain, knowing that I had some songs with me, one afternoon asked me to sing. I was not feeling like singing, so I declined. \"Shot at dawn!\" he said. \"Ready now,\" I replied. \"No!\" said he. \"I can't oblige you now. Either at dawn, for disobedience to Captain's orders, or not at all.\" So it was made the latter! On Sunday evenings, after the six o'clock \"supper,\" a small party met in the saloon to sing a few favourite hymns, each one choosing the ones he or she liked best. This little gathering was looked forward to by those who took part in it, as it formed a welcome break in the ordinary monotonous life on board.  The only Japanese left on board were some stewards, cooks, and the stewardess. A German chief mate and chief engineer replaced the Japanese, and other posts previously held by the Japanese were filled by Germans and neutrals. The times of meals were changed, and we no longer enjoyed the good meals we had had before our capture, as most of the good food had been transferred to the _Wolf_. _Chota-hazri_ was done away with, except for the ladies; the meals became much simpler, menus were no longer necessary, and the Japanese cooks took no more trouble with the preparation of the food.  However, on the whole we were not so badly off, though on a few occasions there was really not enough to eat, and some of the meat was tainted, as the freezing apparatus had got out of order soon after the ship was captured.  There was no longer any laundry on board, as the dhobi had been killed. Amateur efforts by some Japanese stewards were not successful, so the passengers had to do their own washing as best they could. They were helped in this by some of the young boys sent on board. The walls of the alley-ways were plastered with handkerchiefs, etc., drying in Chinese fashion, the alley-ways became drying-rooms for other garments hung on the rails, and ironing with electric irons was done on the saloon tables. Some of the men passengers soon became expert ironers.  We steamed gently on a south-westerly course for about five days, and on the succeeding day, October 12th, changed our course many times, going north-east at 6.30 a.m., south-east at 12.30 p.m., north-east again at 4 p.m., and north at 6.30 p.m., evidently waiting for something and killing time, as we were going dead slow all day. The next morning we had stopped entirely; we sighted smoke at 10.20 a.m.--it was, of course, the _Wolf_, met by appointment at that particular time and place. She came abreast of us about 11.20 a.m., and we sailed on parallel courses for the rest of the day. She was unaccompanied by a new prize, and we were glad to think she had been unsuccessful in her hunt for further prey. She remained in company with us all next day, Sunday, and about 5 p.m. moved closer up, and after an exchange of signals we both changed courses and the _Wolf_ sheered off, and to our great relief we saw her no more for several days. There was always the hope that when away from us she would be seen and captured by an Allied cruiser, and always the fear that, failing such happy consummation, when she came back to us we might again be put on board her. The Germans seemed to have a perfect mania for taking photographs--we were, of course, not allowed to take any, and cameras were even taken away from us--and one day Lieutenant Rose showed me photos of various incidents of the _Wolf's_ cruise, including those of the sinkings of various ships. I asked him how he, a sailor, felt when he saw good ships being sent to the bottom. Did he feel no remorse, no regret? He admitted he did, but the Germans, he said, had no choice in the matter. They had no port to which they could take their prizes--this, of course, was the fault of the British! (I saw, too, on this day a photo of the _Hitachi_ flying the German flag, and one showing the damage sustained by her from the _Wolf's_ firing. There were ugly holes in the stern quarters, but all above the water-line.) The German officers would take with them to Germany hundreds of pictures giving a complete photographic record of the _Wolf's_ expedition.  We cruised about again after the _Wolf_ had left us for a couple of days, and on the 17th were stationary all day. Several sharks were seen around the ship, and the German sailors caught two or three fairly large ones during the day and got them on board. One particularly ravenous shark made off with the bait three times, and was dragged halfway up the ship's side on each occasion. So greedy was he that he returned to the charge for the fourth time, seized the bait, and was this time successfully hauled on board. On the 18th the sea was rough, and we were gently steaming to keep the ship's head to the seas, and on the following day we again changed our course many times. Saturday morning, October 20th, again saw the _Wolf_ in sight at 6.30. She was still alone, and we proceeded on parallel courses, passing about midday a few white reefs with breakers sweeping over them. Shortly after, we came in sight of many other reefs, most of which were quite bare, but there were a few trees and a little vegetation on the largest of them, and at 2 p.m. we anchored, and the _Wolf_ tied up alongside us at a snug and sheltered spot. We were almost surrounded by large and small coral reefs, against which we could see and hear the breakers dashing. It was a beautiful anchorage, and the waters were evidently well known to the Germans. Some of the seafaring men amongst us told us we were in the Cargados Carajos Reef, south-east of the Seychelles, and that we were anchored near the Nazareth Bank.     CHAPTER IV  THE GERMANS SINK THEIR PRIZE   So confident did the Germans feel of their security that they stayed in this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16690"],["title","Five Months on a German Raider (#5)"],["body","from October 20th to November 7th, only once--on October 28th--moving a few hundred yards away from their original anchorage, and although a most vigilant lookout was kept from the crow's nest on the _Wolf_, the seaplane was not sent up once to scout during the whole of that time. Coal, cargo, and stores were transferred from the _Hitachi_ to the _Wolf_, and the work went on day and night with just as much prospect of interference as there would have been if the _Wolf_ had been loading cargo from a wharf in Hamburg in peace-time. The coolness and impudence of the whole thing amazed us.  But one day, October 22nd, was observed as a holiday. It was Lieutenant Rose's birthday, and, incidentally, the Kaiserin's also. So no loading or coaling was done, but the band on the _Wolf_--most of the members with the minimum of clothing and nearly all with faces and bodies black with coal-dust--lined up and gave a musical performance of German patriotic airs.  Every day we looked, but in vain, for signs of help in the shape of a friendly cruiser, but the Germans proceeded with their high-seas robbery undisturbed and unalarmed. The _Hitachi_ had a valuable cargo of rubber, silk, tea, tin, copper, antimony, hides, cocoa-nut, and general stores, and it was indeed maddening to see all these cases marked for Liverpool and London being transferred to the capacious maw of the _Wolf_ for the use of our enemies. The silk came in very handy--the Germans used a great deal of it to make new wings for their \"bird.\" The seaplane did not, of course, take off from the _Wolf's_ deck, which was far too crowded. She was lowered over the side by means of the winch, and towed a little distance by the motor launch before rising. On her return she was taken in tow again by the launch and then lifted aboard to her quarters. She made some beautiful flights. The Germans told us that when the _Wolf_ was mine-laying in Australian waters the seaplane made a flight over Sydney. What a commotion there would have been in the southern hemisphere if she had launched some of her bolts from the blue on the beautiful Australian city!  On October 28th a Japanese sailor, wounded at the time of the _Hitachi's_ capture, died on the _Wolf_. This was the last death from wounds inflicted on that day. His body was brought over to the _Hitachi_--once again all the German officers, from the Commander downwards, including the two doctors, appeared in full uniform to attend the funeral service. The Japanese Captain and officers also came over from the _Wolf_, and the body was committed to the sea from the poop of the _Hitachi_.  We had now been prisoners more than a month, and various rumours came into circulation about this time as to what was to happen to us. The most likely thing was, if the _Wolf_ did not secure another prize, that the _Hitachi_ would be sunk and all of us transferred to the _Wolf_ once more. It was certain, however, that the Germans did not want us on the _Wolf_ again, and still more certain that we did not want to go. They regarded us, especially the women, as a nuisance on board their ship, which was already more than comfortably full. In addition, some of the German officers who had before given up their cabins to some of the married couple prisoners naturally did not want to do so again, as it meant that all the officers' quarters became very cramped. The German doctor, too, protested against further crowding of the _Wolf_, but all these protests were overruled.  There was talk of leaving the _Hitachi_ where she was, with some weeks' stores on board, with her coal exhausted and her wireless dismantled, the _Wolf_ to send out a wireless in a few weeks' time as to our condition and whereabouts. If this had happened, there was further talk among us of a boat expedition to the Seychelles to effect an earlier rescue. The expedition would have been in charge of the American Captain, some of whose crew--neutrals--were helping to work the _Hitachi_. There was also mentioned another scheme of taking the _Hitachi_ near Mauritius, sending all her prisoners and German officers and crew off in boats at nightfall to the island, and then blowing up the ship. Lieutenant Rose admitted that if he and his crew were interned in a British possession he knew they would all be well treated. But all these plans came to nothing, and as day by day went by and the _Wolf_, for reasons best known to herself, did not go out after another prize, though the Germans knew and told us what steamers were about--and in more than one case we knew they were correct--it became evident that the _Hitachi_ would have to be destroyed, as she had not enough coal to carry on with, and we should all have to be sent on to the _Wolf_.  But the married men protested vigorously against having their wives put in danger of shell-fire from a British or Allied cruiser, and on October 30th sent the following petition to the Commander of the _Wolf_:--       \"We, the undersigned detained enemy subjects travelling with      our wives, some of whom have already been exposed to      shell-fire, and the remainder to the risk thereof, and have      suffered many weeks' detention on board, respectfully beg      that no women be transferred to the auxiliary cruiser,      thereby exposing them to a repetition of the grave dangers      they have already run. We earnestly trust that some means      may be found by which consideration may be shown to all the      women on board by landing them safely without their      incurring further peril. We take this opportunity of      expressing our gratitude for the treatment we have received      since our capture, and our sincere appreciation of the      courtesy and consideration shown us by every officer and man      from your ship with whom we have been brought in contact.\"  He sent back a verbal message that there was no alternative but to put us all, women included, on the _Wolf_, as the _Hitachi_ had no coal, but that they should be landed at a neutral port from the next boat caught, if she had any coal.  We were still not satisfied with this, and I again protested to our Captain against what was equivalent to putting our women in a German first-line trench to be shot by our own people. He replied that we need have no anxiety on that score. \"We know exactly where all your cruisers are, we pick up all their wireless messages, and we shall never see or go anywhere near one of them.\" Whether the Germans did know this, or hear our ships' wireless I cannot tell, but it is certainly true that we never, between September and February, saw a British or Allied war vessel of any sort or kind, or even the smoke of one (with the single exception to be mentioned later), although during that time we travelled from Ceylon to the Cape, and the whole length of the Atlantic Ocean from below 40° S. to the shores of Iceland, and thence across to the shores of Norway and Denmark. But notwithstanding the Captain's assurance, we still felt it possible that on the _Wolf_ we might be fired on by an Allied cruiser, and some of us set about settling up our affairs, and kept such documents always on our persons, so that if we were killed and our bodies found by a friendly vessel our last wishes concerning our affairs might be made known. I wrote my final directions on the blank sheet of my Letter of Credit on the Hong-Kong and Shanghai Bank, which, after being cancelled, I now keep as a relic of a most anxious time when I was a very unwilling guest of the Kaiser's Navy.  The food on the _Hitachi_ was now getting poorer and poorer. There was no longer any fruit, cheese, vegetables, coffee, or jam. All the eggs were bad, and when opened protested with a lively squeak; only a very little butter remained, the beer was reserved for the ship's officers, iced water and drinks were no longer obtainable, and the meat became more and more unpleasant. One morning at breakfast, the porridge served had evidently made more than a nodding acquaintance with some kerosene, and was consequently quite uneatable. So most of the passengers sent it away in disgust. But one of them, ever anxious to please his captors, \"wolfed\" his allowance notwithstanding. He constantly assured the Germans that the food was always ample and excellent, no matter how little or bad it was. When Lieutenant Rose came down to breakfast that morning, we were all waiting to see what he would do with his kerosene porridge. He took one spoonful and, amid roars of laughter from us all, called for the steward to take it away at once. Our hero looked as if he were sorry he had not done the same! On the _Wolf_ the food was still poorer, and beri-beri broke out on the raider. A case of typhoid also appeared on the _Wolf_, and the German doctors thereupon inoculated every man, woman, and child on both ships against typhoid. We had heard before of German \"inoculations,\" and some of us had nasty forebodings as to the results. But protests were of no avail--every one had to submit. The first inoculation took place on November 1st and the next on November 11th, and some of the people were inoculated a third time. The Senior Doctor of the _Wolf_, on hearing that I had come from Siam, told me that a Siamese Prince had once attended his classes at a German University. He remembered his name, and, strangely enough, this Prince was the Head of the University of Siam with which I had so recently been connected!  One night, while the ships were lashed alongside, a great uproar arose on both ships. The alarm was given, orders were shouted, revolvers and side-arms were hastily assumed, and sailors commenced rushing and shouting from all parts of both ships. Most of us were scared, not knowing what had happened. It appeared that a German sailor had fallen down between the two ships; his cries, of course, added to the tumult, but luckily he was dragged up without being much injured. We could not help wondering, if such a commotion were made at"]]]
