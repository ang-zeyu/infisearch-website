This process may be quickened by placing the paper in cold water.  Chloride of gold with nitrate of silver gives a precipitate of a yellow brown color.  Paper impregnated with the acetate of lead, when washed with perfectly neutral chloride of gold, acquires a brownish-yellow hue.  The first impression of light seems rather to whiten than darken the paper, by discharging the original color, and substituting for it a pale greyish tint, which by slow degrees increases to a dark slate color; but if arrested, while yet, not more than a moderate ash grey, and held in a current of steam, the color of the parts acted upon by light--and of that only--darkens immediately to a deep purple.  Here I must leave the subject of the action of light upon metalic compounds--referring to Mr. Hunts work for any further information the student may desire on the other metals--as I find myself going beyond my limits.  I cannot, however, entirely dismiss the subject without giving a few examples of the action of light on the juices of plants, some of which produce very good photographic effect.  CORCHORUS JAPONICA--The juice of the flowers of this plant impart a fine yellow color to paper, and, so far as ascertained, is the most sensitive of any vegetable preparation; but owing to its continuing to change color even in the dark, photographic images taken on paper prepared with it soon fade out.  WALL FLOWER.--This flower yields a juice, when expressed with alcohol, from which subsides, on standing, a bright yellow finely divided faecula, leaving a greenish-yellow transparent liquid, only slightly colored supernatant.  The faecula spreads well on paper, and is very sensitive to light, but appears at the same time to undergo a sort of chromatic analysis, and to comport itself as if composed of two very distinct coloring principles, very differently affected.  The one on which the intensity and sub-orange tint of the color depends, is speedily destroyed, but the paper is not thereby fully whitened.  A paler yellow remains as a residual tint, and this on continued exposure to the light, slowly darkens to brown.  Exposed to the spectrum, the paper is first reduced nearly to whiteness in the region of the blue and violet rays.  More slowly, an insulated solar image is whitened in the less refrangible portion of the red.  Continue the exposure, and a brown impression begins to be percieved in the midst of the white streak, which darkens slowly over the region between the lower blue and extreme violet rays.  THE RED POPPY yields a very beautiful red color, which is entirely destroyed by light.  When perfectly dried on paper the color becomes blue.  This blue color is speedily discharged by exposure to the sun's rays, and papers prepared with it afford very interesting photographs.--  Future experiments will undoubtedly more fully develope the photogenic properties of flowers, and practically apply them.  Certain precautions are necessary in extracting the coloring matter of flowers.  The petals of fresh flowers, carefully selected, are crushed to a pulp in a mortar, either alone or with the addition of a little alcohol, and the juice expressed by squeezing the pulp in a clean linen or cotton cloth.  It is then to be spread upon paper with a flat brush, and dried in the air.  If alcohol be not added, it must be applied immediately, as the air changes or destroys the color instantly.  Most flowers give out their coloring matter to alcohol or water--but the former is found to weaken, and in some cases to discharge altogether these colors; but they are in most cases restored in drying. Paper tinged with vegetable colors must be kept perfectly dry and in darkness.  To secure an eveness of tint on paper it should be first moistened on the back by sponging, and blotting off with bibulous paper.  It should then be pinned on a board, the moist side downwards, so that two of its edges--the right and lower ones--project a little over those of the board.  Incline the board twenty or thirty degrees to the horizon, and apply the tincture with a brush in strokes from right to left, taking care not to go over the edges which rests on the board, but to pass clearly over those that project; and also observing to carry the tint from below upwards by quick sweeping strokes, leaving no dry spaces between them.  Cross these with other strokes from above downwards, leaving no floating liquid on the paper.  Dry as quickly as possible, avoiding, however, such heat as may injure the tint.    CHAP. IV.  A FEW HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS TO DAGUERREOTYPISTS.   There are very few who may not be capable of practising the Photographic art, either on paper, or metalic plates--but, like all other professions, some are more clever in its various processes than others.  Impatience is a great drawback to perfect success, and combined with laziness is a decided enemy.  Besides this, no one can excel in Photography who does not possess a natural taste for the fine arts, who is not quick in discerning grace and beauty--is regardless of the principles of perspective, foreshortening and other rules of drawing, and who sets about it merely for the sake of gain--without the least ambition to rise to the first rank, both in its practice and theory. There is no profession or trade in which a slovenly manner will not show itself, and none where its effects will be more apparent than this.  In order to be great in any pursuit, we must be ourselves, and keep all things, in order.  In your show and reception rooms, let neatness prevail; have your specimens so placed--leaning slightly forward--as to obtain the strongest light upon them, and at the same time prevent that glassiness of appearance which detracts so materially from the effect they are intended to produce.  If possible, let the light be of a north-western aspect, mellowed by curtains of a semitransparent hue. Your show-cases, at the door, should be kept well cleaned.  I have often been disgusted while attempting to examine portraits in the cases of our artists, at the greasy coating and marks of dirty fingers upon the glass and frame enclosing them.  Believe it, many a good customer is lost for no other reason.  In your operating room, dust should be carefully excluded.  It should be furnished with nothing apt to collect and retain dust; a carpet is therefore not only a useless article, but very improper.  A bare floor is to be prefered; but if you must cover it use matting.  There is no place about your establishment where greater care should be taken to have order and cleanliness; for it will prevent many failures often attributed to other causes.  \"A place for every thing, and every thing in its place,\" should be an absolute maxim with all artists.  Do not oblige the ladies, on going away from your rooms, to say--\"That H. is a slovenly man; see how my dress is ruined by sitting down in a chair that looked as if it had just come out of a porter house kitchen and had not been cleaned for six months.\"  In choosing your operating room, obtain one with a north-western aspect, if possible; and either with, or capable of having attached, a large skylight.  Good pictures may be taken without the sky-light, but not the most pleasing or effective.  A very important point to be observed, is to keep the camera perfectly free from dust.  The operator should be careful to see that the slightest particle be removed, for the act of inserting the plate-holder will set it in motion, if left, and cause those little black spots on the plate, by which an otherwise good picture is spoiled.  The camera should be so placed as to prevent the sun shining into the lenses.  In taking portraits, the conformation of the sitter should be minutely studied to enable you to place her or him in a position the most graceful and easy to be obtained.  The eyes should be fixed on some object a little above the camera, and to one side--but never into, or on the instrument, as some direct; the latter generally gives a fixed, silly, staring, scowling or painful expression to the face.  Care should also be taken, that the hands and feet, in whatever position, are not too forward or back ward from the face when that is in good focus.  If any large surface of white is present, such as the shirt front, or lady's handkerchief, a piece of dark cloth (a temporary bosom of nankeen is best,) may be put over it, but quickly withdrawn when the process is about two thirds finished.  A very pleasing effect is given to portraits, by introducing, behind the sitter, an engraving or other picture--if a painting, avoid those in which warm and glowing tints predominate.  The subject of these pictures may be applicable to the taste or occupation of the person whose portrait you are taking.  This adds much to the interest of the picture, which is otherwise frequently dull, cold and inanimate.  Mr. J. H. Whitehurst of Richmond, Va., has introduced a revolving background, which is set in motion during the operation, and produces a distinctness and boldness in the image not otherwise to be obtained. The effect upon the background of the plate is equally pleasing; it having the appearance of a beautifully clouded sky.  In practising Photographic drawing on paper, the student must bear in mind that it is positively essential, to secure success in the various processes, to use the utmost precaution in spreading the solutions, and washes from the combination of which the sensitive surfaces result. The same brush should always be used for the same solution, and never used for any other, and always washed in clean water after having been employed.  Any"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/168"],["title","The History and Practice of the Art of Photography (#7)"],["body","mounting on the brushes should be avoided, as the metal precipitates the silver from its solution.  The brushes should be made of camels or badger's hair and sufficiently broad and large to cover the paper in two or three sweeps; for if small ones be employed, many strokes must be given, which leave corresponding streaks that will become visible when submitted to light, and spoil the picture.  These few preliminary hints and suggestions, will, I trust, be of some service to all who adopt this pleasing art as a profession; and will, with a due attention to the directions given in the practical working of the Daguerreotype, Calotype, etc., ensure a corresponding measure of success.    CHAP. V.  DAGUERREOTYPE APPARATUS.   The entire Daguerreotype process is comprised in seven distinct operations; viz:  1.--Cleaning and polishing the plate.  2.--Applying the sensitive coating.  3--Submitting the plate to the action of light in the camera.  4.--Bringing out the picture; in other words rendering it visible.  5.--Fixing the image, or making it permanent--so that the light may no longer act upon it.  6.--Gilding:  or covering the picture with a thin film of gold--which not only protects it, but greatly improves its distinctness and tone of color.  7.--Coloring the picture.  For these various operations the following articles--which make up the entire apparatus of a Daguerrean artist--must be procured  1.--THE CAMERA.--(Fig. 5.). The Camera Obscura of the Italian philosophers, although highly appreciated, on account of the magical character of the pictures it produced, remained little other than a scientific toy, until the discovery of M. Daguerre.  The value of this instrument is now great, and the interest of the process which it so essentially aids, universally admitted.  A full description of it will therefore be interesting.  [Illustration: Fig. 5 (hipho_5.gif)]  The camera is a dark box (a), having a tube with lenses (b) placed in one end of it, through which the radiations from external objects pass, and form a diminished picture upon the ground glass (g) placed at the proper distance in the box to receive it; the cap c covering the lenses at b until the plate is ready to receive the image of the object to be copied.  Thus a (fig. 6.) representing the lens, and b the object desired to be represented, the rays (c, c) proceeding from it fall upon the lens, and are transmitted to a point, which varies with the curvature of the glass, where an inverted image (d) of b is very accurately formed.  At this point, termed the focus, the sensitive photographic material is placed for the purpose of obtaining the required picture.  [Illustration: Fig. 5 (hipho_6.gif)]  The great desideratum in a photographic camera is perfect lenses.  They should be achromatic, and the utmost transparency should be obtained; and under the closest inspection of the glass not the slightest wavy appearance, or dark spot should be detected; and a curvature which as much as possible prevents spherical aberration should be secured.  The effect produced by this last defect is a convergence of perpendiculars, as for instance; two towers of any building, would be represented as leaning towards each other; and in a portrait the features would seem contracted, distorted and mingled together, so as to throw the picture out of drawing and make it look more like a caricature than a likeness. If the lens be not achromatic, a chromatic aberration takes place, which produces an indistinct, hazy appearance around the edges of the picture, arising from the blending of the rays.  The diameter and focal length of a lens must depend in a great measure on the distance of the object, and also on the superficies of the plate or paper to be covered.  For portraits one of 1 1/2 inches diameter, and from 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 inches focus may be used; but for distant views, one from 2 inches to 3 inches diameter, and from 8 to 12 inches focal length will answer much better.  For single lenses, the aperture in front should be placed at a distance from it, corresponding to the diameter, and of a size not more than one third of the same.  A variety of movable diaphragms or caps, to cover the aperture in front, are very useful, as the intensity of the light may be modified by them and more or less distinctness and clearness of delineation obtained.  These caps alway come with Voitlander instruments and should be secured by the purchaser.  Though the single acromatic lens answers very well for copying engravings; taking views from nature or art, for portraits the double should always be used.  The extensive manufacture of the most approved cameras, both in Europe and in this country, obviates all necessity for any one attempting to construct one for their own use.  Lenses are now made so perfect by some artisans that, what is called the \"quick working camera\" will take a picture in one second, while the ordinary cameras require from eight to sixty.  The camera in most general use is that manufactured by Voitlander and Son of Germany.  Their small size consists of two seperate acromatic lenses; the first, or external one, has a free aperture of 1 1/2 inches; the second, or internal, 1 5/8 inches; and both have the same focus, viz:  5 3/4 inches.  The larger size differs from the smaller. The inner lens is an achromatic 3 1/4 inches diameter, its focal length being 30 inches.  The outer lens is a meniscus--that is bounded by a concave and convex spherical surface which meet--having a focal length of 18 inches.  For every distant view, the aperture in front is contracted by a diaphram to 1/8 of an inch.  By this means the light is reflected with considerable intensity and the clearness and correctness of the pictures are truly surprising.  THE AMERICA instruments are constructed on the same principle and many of them are equally perfect.  Mr. Edward Anthony of 205 Broadway, New York city, has constructed, and sold cameras fully equal to the German and for which Voitlander instruments have been refused in exchange by the purchaser.  The ordinary camera box (see fig. 5, a) varies in size to suit the tube, and is termed medium, half, or whole.  Within the box is a slide to assist in regulating the focus, and in enlarging or diminishing the picture.  In one end of this slide is a springed groove into which the ground-glass spectrum (g fig. 5) is slid, for the purpose of more conveniently arranging the focus.  After the plate is prepared it is placed in the holder--partly seen at e, fig. 5, and covered with the dark slide f, fig. 5; the spectrum is then withdrawn and the holder takes its place, and the lids d, d, are closed after removing the dark slide f.  The plate is now ready to receive the image, and the cap c may be removed to admit the light into the box.  A camera constructed by Voitlander is thus described by Mr. Fisher. \"It is made entirely of brass, so that variations of climate has no effect upon it.  It is very portable and when packed in its box, with all the necessary apparatus and materials for practising the Daguerreotype art, occupies but very little space.  It is not, however, well adapted for the Calotype process.\"  [Illustration: Fig. 7 (hipho_7.gif)]  \"The brass foot A (fig. 7.), is placed on a table, or other firm support, and the pillar B. screwed into it; the body of the camera, C, C is laid into the double forked bearing D. D. The instrument is now properly adjusted by means of the set screws, e, e, e, in the brass foot, or it may be raised, lowered, or moved, by the telescope stand, and when correct, fixed by the screw b.  The landscape to be delineated is viewed either through the small lens, g, or with the naked eye on the ground glass plate H, the focus being adjusted by the screw I. The optical part of the instrument consist of the small set of achromatic lenses already described.  When the portrait or view is deliniated on the ground glass to the entire satisfaction of the operator, the brass cap L is placed over the lens, and the entire body is removed away into the dark, taking care not to disturb the position of the stand.  The body is now detached at the part H, and the prepared paper or plate enclosed in the brass frame work introduced in its place; the whole is again placed upon the pedestal, the brass cap L is removed, by which the paper or plate is exposed to the full influence of the light, after which the cap is again replaced.  Mr. Woodbridge, of this city, has constructed an instrument for taking full length portraits on plates 10 by 13 inches, which is worthy of some notice.  It is a double camera, consisting of two boxes, placed in a frame, one above the other, and so arranged as to slide easily up and down.  After the focus has been adjusted, on the object, in both cameras, the plate is put into the upper box, in the manner already described, until the superior portion of the figure is complete; it is then placed in the second box and the lower extremities obtained.  The adjustment of the instrument is so complete that a perfect union of the parts is effected in the picture without the least possible line of demarkation being visible.  Fig. 8 gives a front view of this instrument.  [Illustration: Fig. 8 (hipho_8.gif)]  Fig. 9 represents Talbot's Calotype Camera,--a very beautiful instrument.  The copying camera box has an extra slide in the back end, by which it may be considerably lengthened at pleasure.  II.--CAMERA STAND.--The best constructed stands are made of maple or black walnut wood, having a cast iron socket (a, Fig. 12,) through which the sliding rod b passes, and into which the legs c, c, with iron screw ferules are inserted.  The platform d is made of two pieces, hinged together, as at e, and having a thumb screw for the purpose of elevating or depressing the instrument.  [Illustration: Fig. 9 (hipho_9.gif)]  III.
