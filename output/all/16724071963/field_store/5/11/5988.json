(See map facing p. 38.)  The monasteries were educational as well as industrial centers.  The monks spent part of each day in manual toil, for they held that \"to labor is to pray.\"  They cleared the land, drained he bogs, plowed, sowed, and reaped.  Another part of the day they spent in religious exercises, and a third in writing, translating, and teaching.  Each monastery had a school attached to it, and each had, besides, its library of manuscript books and its room for the entertainment of travelers and pilgrims.  In these libraries important charters granted by the King and important laws relating to the kingdom were preserved.  46. Literary Work of the Monks.  It was at the monastery of Jarrow[2] that Bede wrote in rude Latin the Church history of England.  It was at that in Whitby that the poet Caedmon composed his poem on the Creation, in which, a thousand years before Milton, he dealt with Milton's theme in Milton's spirit.  [2] Jarrow, Whitby, etc.; see note 1, above.  It was at the great monasteries of Peterborough and Canterbury that the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" was probably begun (S99).  It was the first history of England written in English, and the one from which we derive very important knowledge of the period extending from the beginning of the Christian era down to a time nearly a hundred years after the Norman conquest of the island.  Furthermore we find that the history of the country was written by the monks in the form of independent narratives, some of which are of very great value as sources of information.[1]  [1] See six extracts from the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,\" in E. K. Kendall's \"Source-Book of English History,\" chaps. ii and iii; also William of Malmesbury's \"Conquered and Conquerors\" (1066) and Matthew Paris's \"England in 1257,\" in the same book, pp. 41 and 78. See also Bogn's \"Six Old English Chronicles.\"  47. Influence of Christianity on Society.  But the power of Christianity for good was not confied to the monasteries; the priests took their part in it.  Unlike the monks, they were not bound by monastic rules, though they were forbidden to marry.  They lived in the world and worked for the world, and had an immense social influence.  The Church, as a rule, in all forms of its activity took the side of the weak, the suffering, and the oppressed. Slavery was then the normal condition of a large class, but when the Church held slaves it protected them from ill usage.  It secured Sunday for them as a day of rest, and it often labored effectually for their emancipation.  48. Political Influence of Christianity, 664.  More than this, Christianity had a powerful political influence.  A great synod or council was held at Whitby, on the coast of Yorkshire, 664, to decide when Easter should be observed.  Delegates to that meeting were sent from different parts of the country.  After a protracted discussion all the churches finally agreed to accept the Roman custom.  This important decision encouraged a spirit of true religious unity.  The bishops, monks, and priests who gathered at Whitby represented Saxon tribes which were often bitterly hostile to each other (S37), but their action on the Easter question united them in a certain way.  It made them feel that they had a common interest, that they were members of the same Church, and that, in that Church, they were laboring for the same object.  The fact that they bowed to one supreme spiritual authority had a political significance.  It suggested that the time might be coming when all the conflicting tribes or petty kingdoms in Britain would acknowledge the authority of one King, and form one English nation.  49. Egbert becomes King of Wessex, and Overlord of the Whole Country, 829.  Somewhat more than a hundred and sixty years later a great step was taken toward the accomplishment of the political union of the different sections of Britain.  By the death of the King of Wessex (S37), Egbert, a descendant of Cerdic, the first chief and King of that country, succeeded to the crown.  He had spent some time in France at the court of Charlemagne and had seen that great ruler make himself master of most of western Europe.  Egbert was not content to remain simply King of Wessex.  He resolved to make himself master of the whole country.  He began a series of wars by which he, at length, compelled all the other Saxon Kings to acknowledge him as their Overlord.  That title marks the beginning, in 829, of a new period in the history of the island.  50. How Britain got the Name of England.  In making himself supreme ruler over the entire English population of Britain, Egbert laid the foundations of what was finally to become the \"Kingdom of England.\"  Several causes contributed to this change of name.  We can trace the process step by step.  First, the people of Kent and the great council held at Whitby (SS42, 48) laid the cornerstone of the National Church; next, the people of Wessex furnished the National Overlord (S49); finally, the preponderance of the people called Angles (S37) furnished the National Name of Angle-Land or England.  It is a fact worthy of notice, in this connection, that from Egbert as a royal source every subsequent English sovereign (except the four Danish Kings, Harold II, and William the Conqueror) has directly or indirectly descended down to the present time.  (See Table of Royal Descent in the Appendix, p. xlii.)  51. Alfred the Great.  Of these sovereigns the most conspicuous during the period of which we are writing was Alfred.  He was a grandson of Egbert (S49).  He was rightly called Alfred the Great, since he was the embodiment of whatever was best and bravest in the English character.  The keynote of his life may be found in the words which he spoke at the close of it, \"So long as I have lived, I have striven to live worthily.\"  52. Danish Invasion.  When Alfred came to the throne (871) the Danes, or Northmen, as they were often called, were sweeping down upon the country.  A few months before he became King, he had aided his brother in a desperate struggle with them.  In the beginning, the object of the Danes was to plunder, later, to possess, and finally, to rule over the country. They had already overrun a large portion of England and had invaded Wessex or the country of the West Saxons.  (See map facing p. 30.) Wherever their raven flag appeared, destruction and slaughter followed.  53. The Danes or Northmen destroy the Monasteries.  These terrible pirates despised Christianity.  They scorned it as the weak religion of a weak people.  They hated the English monasteries most of all and made them the especial objects of their attacks (SS43, 45, 46).  Many of these institutions had accumulated wealth, and some had gradually sunk into habits of laziness, luxury, and other evil courses of life.  The Danes, who were full of the vigorous virtues of heathenism, liked nothing better than to scourge those effeminate vices of the cloisters.  From the thorough way in which they robbed, burned, and murdered, there can be no doubt that they enjoyed their work of destruction.  In their helplessness and terror, the panic-stricken monks added to their usual prayers, this fervent petition: \"From the fury of the Northmen, good Lord deliver us!\"  The power raised up to answer that supplication was Alfred the Great.  54. Alfred's Victories over the Danes: the White Horse.  After repeated defeats Alfred finally drove back these savage hordes, who thought it a shame to earn by sweat what they could win by blood.  In these attacks Alfred led one half the army and his brother Ethelred led the other.  They met the Danes at Ashdown Ridge in Berkshire. (See map facing p. 32.)  While Ethelred stopped to pray for success, Alfred, under the banner of the \"White Horse,\"--the common standard of the English at that time,--began the attack and won the day.  Tradition declares that after the victory he ordered his army to commemorate their triumph by carving that colossal figure of a horse on the side of a neighboring chalk hill, which still remains so conspicuous an object in the landscape.  It was shortly after this that Alfred became \"King of the West Saxons\"; but the war, far from being ended, had in fact but just begun.  55. The Danes compel Alfred to retreat.  The Danes, reenforced by other invaders, overcame Alfred's forces and compelled him to retreat.  He fled to the wilds of Somersetshite, and was glad to take up his abode for a time, so the story runs, in a peasant's hut.  Subsequently he succeeded in rallying part of his people, and built a stronghold on a piece of rising ground, in the midst of an almost impassable morass.  There he remained during the winter.  56. Alfred's Great Victory; Treaty of Wedmore, 878.  In the spring Alfred marched forth and again attacked the Danes.  They were intrenched in a camp at Edington, Wiltshire.  He surrounded them, and starved them into complete submission.  They had to confess that Alfred's muscular Christians were more than a match for the most stalwart heathen.  The Danish leader swore to maintain a peace, called the Peace or Treaty of Wedmore.  (See maps facing p. 32 and p. 38.) More than this, the discomfited warrior sealed the oath with his baptism,--an admission that Alfred had not only beaten him but converted him as well.  By the Treaty of Wedmore, 878, the Danes bound themselves to remain north and east of a line drawn from London to Chester, following the old Roman road called Watling Street.   All south of this line, including a district around London, was recognized as the dominions of Alfred, whose chief city, or capital, was Winchester.  (See map facing p. 32.)  By this treaty the Danes got much the larger part of England (called the Danelaw), but they acknowledged Alfred as their Overlord.  He thus became, in name at least, what his predecessor, Egbert (S49), had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17386"],["title","The Leading Facts of English History (#7)"],["body","to be,--supreme ruler of the whole country, though the highest title he ever assumed was \"King of the Saxons or English.\"  57. Alfred's Laws; his Translations.  Alfred proved himself to be more than mere ruler, for he was also a lawgiver and teacher as well.  Through his efforts a written code was compiled, prefaced by the Ten Commandments and ending with the Golden Rule.  Referring to this introduction, Alfred said, \"He who keeps this shall not need any other law book.\"  Next, that learning might not utterly perish in the ashes of the abbeys and monasteries which the Danes had destroyed (S53), the King, though feeble and suffering, set himself to translate from the Lating the \"Universal History of Orosius,\" and also Bede's valuable \"Church History of England.\"  58. Alfred's Navy.  Alfred, however, still had to fight against fresh invasion by the Danes, who continued to make descents upon the coast, and even sailed up the Thames to take London.  The English King constructed a superior class of fast-sailing war vessels from designs made by himself.  With this fleet, which may be regarded as the beginning of the English navy, he fought the enemy on their own element.  He thus effectually checked a series of invasions which, if they had continued, might have reduced the country to barbarism.  59. Estimate of Alfred's Reign.  Considered as a whole, Alfred's reign (871-901) is hte most noteworthy of any in the annals of the early English sovereigns.  It was marked throughout by intelligence and progress.  His life speaks for itself.  The best commentary on it is the fact that, in 1849, the people of Wantage, his native place, celebrated the thousandth anniversary of his birth,--another proof that \"what is excellent, as God lives, is permanent.\"[1]  [1] R. W. Emerson's \"Poems.\"  60. St. Dunstan's Three Great Reforms (960-988).  Long after Alfred's death, St. Dunstan, then Archbishop of Canterbury and head of the English Church, set out to push forward the work begun by the great King.  He labored to accomplish three things.  First, he sought to establish a higher system of education; secondly, he desired to elevate the general standard of monastic life; finally, he tried to inaugurate a period of national peace and economic progress.  He began his work when he had control of the abbey of Glastonbury, in the southwest of England.  He succeeded in making the school connected with that abbey the most famous one in the whole kingdom (S45).  He not only taught himself, but, by his enthusiasm, he inspired others to teach.  He was determined that from Glastonbury a spirit should go forth which should make the Church of England the real educator of the English people.  Next, he devoted himself to helping the inmates of the monasteries in their efforts to reach a truer and stronger manhood.  That, of course, was the original purpose for which those institutions had been founded (S45), but, in time, many of them had more or less degenerated.  Every athlete and every earnest student knows how hard it is to keep up the course of training he has resolved upon.  The strain sometimes becomes too great for him.  Well, the monk in his cell had found out how difficult it was for him to be always faithful to his religious vows.  St. Dunstan roused these men to begin their work anew.  He re-created monasticism in England, making it stricter in discipline and purer in purpose.  Last of all, the Archbishop endeavored to secure greater freedom from strife.  He saw that the continued wars of the English were killing off their young men--the real hope of the country--and were wasting the best powers of the nation.  His influence with the reigning monarch was very great, and he was successful, for a time, in reconciling the Danes and the English (SS53, 56).  It was said that he established \"peace in the kingdom such as had not been known within the memory of man.\"  At the same time the Archbishop, who was himself a skillful mechanic and worker in metals,[1] endeavored to encourage inventive industry and the exportation of products to the Continent. He did everything in his power to extend foreign trade, and it was largely through his efforts that \"London rose to the commercial greatness it has held ever since.\"[2]  Because of these things, one of the best known English historians,[3] speaking of that period, declares that Dunstan \"stands forth as the leading man in both Church and State.\"  [1] The common people regarded his accomplishments in this direction with superstitious awe.  Many stories of his skill were circulated, and it was even whispered that in a personal contest with the Evil One, it was the foul fiend and not the monk who got the worst of it, and fled from the saint's workshop, howling with dismay. [2] R. Green's \"English People.\" [3] E. A. Freeman's \"Norman Conquest,\" I, 65.  61. New Invasions; Danegeld (992).  With the close of Dunstan's career, a period of decline set in.  The Northmen began to make fresh inroads (S53).  The resistance to them became feeble and faint-hearted.  At last a royal tax, called Danegeld, or Dane money (992), was levied on all landed property in England in order to buy off the invaders.  For a brief period this cowardly concession answered its purpose.  But a time came when the Danes refused to be bribed to keep away.  62. The Northmen invade France.  The Danish invasion of England was really a part of a great European movement.  The same Northmen who had obtained so large a part of the island (S56) had, in the tenth century, established themselves in France.  There they were known as Normans, a softened form of the word \"Northmen,\" and the district where they settled came to be called from them Normandy.  They founded a line of dukes, or princes, who were destined, in the course of the next century, to give a new aspect to the events of English history.  63. Sweyn conquers England; Canute[1] (1017-1035).  Early in the eleventh century Sweyn, the Dane, conquered England (1013), and \"all the people,\" says the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" (S99), \"held him for full king.\"  He was succeeded by his son Canute (1017). He could hardly be called a foreigner, since he spoke a language and set up a government differing but little from that of the English.  [1] \"Cnut,\" a shortened form of Canute.  After his first harsh measures were over he sought the friendship of both Church and people.  He gave the country peace.  Tradition reports that he rebuked the flattery of courtiers by showing them that the inrolling tide is no respecter of persons; he endeavored to rule justly, and his liking for the monks found expression in his song:          \"Merrily sang the monks of Ely          As Cnut the King was passing by.\"  64. Canute's Plan; the Four Earldoms.  Canute's plan was to establish a great northern empire embracing Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and England.  To facilitate the government of so large a realm, he divided England into four districts,--Wessex, Mercia, East Anglia, and Northumbria--which, with their dependencies, embraced the entire country.  (See map facing p. 38.)  Each of these districts was ruled by an earl[1] invested with almost royal power.  For a time the arrangement worked well, but eventually discord sprang up and imperiled the unity of the kingdom.  After Canute's death two of his sons divided England between themselves; both were bad rulers.  [1] Earl (\"chief\" or \"leader\"): a title of honor and of office.  The four earldoms established by Canute remained nearly unchanged until the Norman Conquest, 1066.  65. Restoration of the Saxon or English Kings; Edward the Confessor (1042-1066).  On the occasion of the Danish conqueror Sweyn (S63), Ethelred II, the English King, sent his French wife Emma back to Normandy for safety. She took her son, Prince Edward, then a lad of nine, with her.  He remained at the French court nearly thirty years, and among other friends to whom he became greatly attached was his second cousin, William, Duke of Normandy.  The oppressive acts of Canute's sons (S64) excited insurrection (1042), and both Danes and English joined in the determination to restore the English line.  They invited Prince Edward to accept the crown.  He returned to England, obtained the throne, and pledged himself to restore the rights of which the people had been deprived. By birth King Edward was already half Norman; by education and tastes he was wholly so.  It is very doubtful whether he could speak a word of English, and it is certain that from the beginning he surrounded himself with French favorites, and filled the Church with French priests.  Edward's piety and blameless life gained for him the title of \"the Confessor,\" or, as we should say to-day, \"the Christian.\"  He married the daughter of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, the most powerful noble in England.  Godwin really ruled the country in the King's name until his death (1053), when his son Harold (S67) succeeded him as earl.  66. Edward the Confessor builds Westminster Abbey.  During a large part of his reign the King was engaged in building an abbey or monastery at the west end of London, and hence called the Westminster.[2]  He had just completed and consecrated this great work when he died, and was buried there.  We may still see a part of the original building in the crypt or basement of the abbey, while the King's tomb above is the center of a circle of royal graves.  [2] Minster: a name given originally to a monastery; next, to a church connected with a monastery; but now applied to several large English cathedrals.  Multitudes made pilgrimages to King Edward's tomb, for the Pope had enrolled him among the saints.  Even now a little band of devoted Catholics gather around his shrine every year.  They go there to show their veneration for the virtues and the piety of a ruler who would have adorned a monastery, but had not breadth and vigor to fill a throne.  67. Harold becomes King (1066).
