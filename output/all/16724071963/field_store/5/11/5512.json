The material for his books was drawn from life--from his own and from the lives of those around him--and for this reason all that he wrote will always be of great value, as it gives us a good idea of the Early and Mid Victorian days.  His ambition was to strike a blow for the poor, \"to leave one's hand upon the time, lastingly upon the time, with one tender touch for the mass of toiling people.\"  Who can ever forget in the _Christmas Carol_ the crippled Tiny Tim, \"who behaved as good as gold and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.\"  Other pictures of suffering childhood are 'Little Nell' and 'The Marchioness' in _The Old Curiosity Shop_, 'Jo' and 'Charley' in _Bleak House_, and 'Smike,' the victim of the inhuman schoolmaster 'Squeers.'  The cruelty of the times is shown in the case of an unfortunate sempstress who tried to earn a living by making shirts for three-halfpence each. Once, when she had been robbed of her earnings, she tried to drown herself. The inhuman magistrate before whom she was brought told her that she had \"no hope of mercy in this world.\"  It was after hearing of this from Charles Dickens that Thomas Hood wrote the well-known \"Song of the Shirt\":        Work--work--work!     From weary chime to chime,       Work--work--work     As prisoners work for crime!       Band, and gusset, and seam,       Seam, and gusset, and band,     Till the heart is sick, and the brain benumbed,       As well as the weary hand.  The age might well take to heart the lesson taught by the great-souled writer--that the two chief enemies of the times were Ignorance and Want.  The lot of the unfortunate children in the Union Workhouses was no better. They were treated rather worse than animals, with no sympathy or kindness, owing to the ignorance of those who were set in authority over them. Any one who reads _Oliver Twist_ may learn the nature of the life led by the 'pauper' children in those 'good old days.'  \"The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered--the poor people liked it! It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work. 'Oho!' said the board, looking very knowing, 'we are the fellows to set this to rights; we'll stop it all, in no time.' So, they established the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody, not they) of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it. With this view, they contracted with the waterworks to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and half a roll on Sundays. . . . Relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened people.\"  A movement which helped, possibly far more than any other, to better the lot of the children of the Poor commenced with the foundation of the Ragged School Union, of which the Queen became the patroness.  Out of this sprang a small army of agencies for well-doing. Commencing only with evening schools, which soon proved insufficient, the founders established day schools, with classes for exercise and industrial training: children were sent to our colonies where they would have a better chance of making a fair start in life; training ships, cripples' homes, penny banks, holiday homes followed, and from these again the numerous Homes and Orphanages which entitle us to call the Victorian Age the Age of Kindness to Children.  Charles Dickens took the keenest interest in the work of the Ragged Schools. A letter from Lord Shaftesbury quoted in his Life gives a clear idea of the marvellous work they had accomplished up to the year 1871:  \"After a period of 27 years, from a single school of five small infants, the work has grown into a cluster of some 300 schools, an aggregate of nearly 30,000 children, and a body of 3000 voluntary teachers, most of them the sons and daughters of toil. . . . Of more than 300,000 children, which, on the most moderate calculation, we have a right to conclude have passed through these schools since their commencement, I venture to affirm that more than 100,000 of both sexes have been placed out in various ways--in emigration, in the marine, in trades and in domestic service. For many consecutive years I have contributed prizes to thousands of the scholars; and let no one omit to call to mind what these children were, whence they came, and whither they were going without this merciful intervention. They would have been added to the perilous swarm of the wild, the lawless, the wretched, and the ignorant, instead of being, as by God's blessing they are, decent and comfortable, earning an honest livelihood, and adorning the community to which they belong.\"  Dickens believed, first of all, in teaching children cleanliness and decency before attempting anything in the form of education. \"Give him, and his,\" he said, \"a glimpse of heaven through a little of its light and air; give them water; help them to be clean; lighten the heavy atmosphere in which their spirits flag and which makes them the callous things they are . . . and then, but not before, they will be brought willingly to hear of Him whose thoughts were so much with the wretched, and who had compassion for all human sorrow.\"     CHAPTER VIII: _Ministering Women_      Honour to those whose words or deeds     Thus help us in our daily needs;       And by their overflow       Raise us from what is low!                             LONGFELLOW   No account of the reign of Queen Victoria would be complete without some reference to the achievements of women, more especially when their work has had for its chief end and aim the alleviation of suffering. Woman has taken a leading part in the campaign which has been and is now being ceaselessly carried on against the forces of sin, ignorance, and want.  In the early years of Victoria's reign the art of sick-nursing was scarcely known at all. The worst type of nurse is vividly pictured for us by Charles Dickens in _Martin Chuzzlewit_:  \"She was a fat old woman, this Mrs Gamp, with a husky voice and a moist eye, which she had a remarkable power of turning up, and only showing the white of it. Having very little neck, it cost her some trouble to look over herself, if one may say so, at those to whom she talked. She wore a very rusty black gown, rather the worse for snuff, and a shawl and bonnet to correspond. In these dilapidated articles of dress she had, on principle, arrayed herself, time out of mind on such occasions as the present; . . . The face of Mrs Gamp--the nose in particular--was somewhat red and swollen, and it was difficult to enjoy her society without becoming conscious of a smell of spirits.\"  For a long time, though it had been recognized that the care of the sick was woman's work, no special training was required from those undertaking it. Florence Nightingale did away with all such wrong ideas. In a letter on the subject of training she wrote: \"I would say also to all young ladies who are called to any particular vocation, qualify yourselves for it, as a man does for his work. Don't think you can undertake it otherwise. . . . If you are called to man's work, do not exact a woman's privileges--the privilege of inaccuracy, of weakness, ye muddle-heads. Submit yourselves to the rules of business, as men do, by which alone you can make God's business succeed; for He has never said that He will give His success and His blessing to inefficiency, to sketchy and unfinished work.\"  She prepared herself for her life's work by years of hard study and ten years' training, visiting all the best institutions in Germany, France, and Italy. She gave up a life of ease and comfort in order to develop her natural gift to the utmost.  Her opportunity was not long in coming. In 1854 the Crimean War broke out. Most of the generals in the English army were old men whose experience of actual warfare dated back to the early days of the century. Everything was hopelessly mismanaged from the beginning. In August the English and French allied forces moved against the fortress of Sebastopol, from which Russia was threatening an attack on Constantinople. Troops were landed in a hostile country without the means of moving them away again; there was little or no provision made to transport food, baggage, or medical stores.  After the victory of Alma Lord Raglan marched on to Balaclava, and here the transport utterly broke down. The soldiers, in addition to undertaking hard fighting, were forced to turn themselves into pack-mules and tramp fourteen miles through the mud in the depth of winter in order to obtain food and warm blankets for their comrades and themselves. Their condition rapidly became terrible. Their clothing wore to rags, their boots--mostly of poor quality--gave out entirely. Their food--such as it was--consisted of biscuit, salt beef or pork, and rum.  No vegetables could be obtained, and for want of green food scurvy broke out among the troops. Stores were left decaying in the holds of transports, and the doctors were forced to see men dying before their eyes without the means of helping them. The loss of life from the actual fighting was considerable, but more particularly so from the insanitary condition of the camp and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16979"],["title","The Discipline of War (#0)"],["body","DISCIPLINE OF WAR   _Nine Addresses on the Lessons of the War in Connection with Lent_  FROM ASH WEDNESDAY to EASTER SUNDAY  WITH AN APPENDIX CONTAINING  SUGGESTED SUBJECT FOR MEDITATION, AND SUITABLE PASSAGE OF SCRIPTURE, FOR EACH DAY IN LENT   BY THE REV.

FOREWORD     Kingston House,     Clapham Common.    _January 19th, 1915._  My dear Canon,--  You have invited me to say a few words introductory to the little book you are putting forth, and of which you have sent me the advance proofs.  From the great excellence of that which I have read, I am convinced that your Lenten meditations on the Discipline of War, will be of pre-eminently spiritual value in a time when publications on the subject are multiplied. That the war is to leave us on a higher plane of self-discipline, and with higher ideals of citizen life and responsibility, every Christian must acknowledge. Your little Lenten scheme is just that which is needed to give reality and action to what might otherwise be left in the realm of theory. May the Holy Spirit make use of your work to the benefit of us all and for the Glory of God.    Your sincere friend,    CECIL HOOK,     _Bishop._     CONTENTS     I                                         PAGE    The Discipline of the Will              1    II    The Discipline of the Body              9    III    The Discipline of the Soul             18    IV    The Discipline of the Spirit           27    V    Discipline through Obedience           35    VI    The Discipline of Sorrow               44    VII    Discipline through bereavement         52    VIII    Discipline through Self-sacrifice      62    IX    Discipline through Victory             70           *       *       *       *       *    Appendix                               81       THE DISCIPLINE OF WAR  I  =The Discipline of the Will=  ASH WEDNESDAY  Isaiah lviii. 6    \"Is not this the fast that I have chosen?\"   Discipline is the central idea of the observance of Lent. An opportunity, rich in its splendid possibilities, comes before us this year. Much of the discipline of this Lent is settled for us by those tragic circumstances in which we find ourselves placed.  God seems to be saying to us, in no uncertain tones, \"Is not this the fast that I have chosen?\"  Our amusements are already to a large extent curtailed, maybe by our own individual sorrows or anxieties; maybe by the feeling of the incongruity of enjoying ourselves while anguish and hardship reign supreme around us.  Our self-denials are already in operation, under the stress of straitened means, or the vital necessity of helping others less favoured than ourselves.  Our devotions have already been increased in frequency and in earnestness, for the call upon our prayers has come with an insistence and an imperiousness that brook no denial.  To this extent, and further in many directions, our Lent has been taken out of our own hands; ordered and pre-arranged by that inscrutable, yet loving, Providence which has permitted the War to come about.  Thus, at the very outset, we are brought into harmony with the central idea of discipline--not my will, but God's will.  Broadly, discipline is defined as \"Mental and moral training, under one's own guidance or under that of another\": the two necessarily overlap, and therefore we shall speak of God's discipline, acting upon us from outside, and of our own co-operation with divine purposes, which is our discipline of self from within.  In the forefront of the subject, and including every aspect of it upon which we shall touch, stands that tremendous word--_will_.  Have you ever attempted to gauge the mystery, to sound the depth of meaning implied in the simple sentence \"I will\"?  First of all what is the significance of \"I\"? You are the only one who can say it of yourself. Any other must speak of you as \"he\" or \"she\"; but \"I\" is your own inalienable possession.  This is the mystery of personality. That accumulation of experience, that consciousness of identity which you possess as absolutely, uniquely your own; which none other can share with you in the remotest degree. \"A thing we consider to be unconscious, an animal to be conscious, a person to be self-conscious.\"  This leads on to a further mystery, alike concerned with so apparently simple a matter that its real complexity escapes us.  \"I _will_\": I, the self-conscious person, have made up my mind what I am going to do, and, physical obstacles excepted, I will do it.  The freedom of man's will has been the subject of endless dispute from every point of view, theistic, atheistic, Christian and non-Christian.  Merely as a philosophic controversy it has but little bearing upon daily life. The staunchest necessitarian, who argues _theoretically_ that even when he says \"I will\" he is under the compulsion of external force, yet acts _practically_ in exactly the same fashion as the rest of mankind.  When the freedom of the will is considered in relation to religion, then it bears a totally different aspect. If the will be not free, religion, as a personal matter, falls to the ground, for its very essence is man's voluntary choice of God.  Here too those who deny the freedom of man's will doctrinally yet accept it as a working fact. Calvin, whose theory of Predestination and Irresistible Grace seems to exclude man from any co-operation in his own salvation, yet preached a Gospel not to be distinguished from that of John Wesley!  For us Christians the freedom of the will is absolutely settled by Him Who says, \"Whosoever will let him come.\"  If you are sometimes troubled by certain passages in Scripture which seem to imply that God's predestination overrides man's will, remember, that whenever we are considering any question which concerns both God's nature and man's nature, difficulty must arise, from the very fact that our finite mind can only comprehend, and that but imperfectly, man's side of the transaction. Things which now seem incompatible, such as prayer and law; miracle and, what we are pleased to call, nature; God's foreknowledge and man's free-will in the light of eternity will be seen as only complementary parts of one divine whole.  Remember too that you must take the general bearing of Scripture; not isolated passages in which, for the necessity of the argument, one side is strongly emphasised. The Apostle who, thinking of the boundless power of God's grace, says, \"So then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy\" (Rom. ix. 16) is the one who says \"He willeth that all men should be saved\" (1 Tim. ii. 4).  The love by which the Father gave up His Son; the life and death of that Son; the ministry of God the Holy Ghost; the whole dispensation of the Catholic Church, form one great tender appeal to the free-will of man. Your free-will, my free-will, before which is placed the tremendous responsibility of choosing or rejecting.  And now from the broad thought of will, at its highest point, occupied with eternal choices and spiritual decisions, we turn to will as the governing power in our lives.  It is, to a certain extent, self in action, for before even the slightest movement of any part of the body, there must have gone, automatically and unconsciously, an act of will.  Before every deliberate action there takes place a discussion, which ultimately decides the attitude of the will, that is your final purpose. Put quite simply, the _motives_ determine the _will_, and are themselves decided by the _principles_ at the back of them.  Let us make this plain by an illustration. It is pouring with rain, you are sitting cosily over the fire with an interesting book. The thought comes into your mind, I ought to go and see my sick friend. Then follows the deliberation: the flesh says, \"To-morrow will do just as well.\" The spirit says, \"No, it won't; you may both be dead to-morrow.\" The flesh says, \"Perhaps I shall catch a cold\"; the spirit says, \"That fear wouldn't keep you from going to a Picture Palace.\" The flesh says, \"Perhaps he won't care to see me to-day\"; the spirit replies, \"It's a dull, wet afternoon, and he's very likely to be alone.\"  Now notice that at the back of each set of motives is a vital principle. In the one case the lower self, in the other the higher self, that is to say \"I\" and \"God.\"  The purely natural, human side of even the greatest saint would prefer to sit over the fire; but then our nature is not left unassisted, and even in a simple thing like this God the Holy Ghost comes to our aid with His suggestions of the higher course, and illuminates the path of duty. That is one of the most blessed features of the ministry of the Spirit; He enlightens, He persuades, He never compels: if He did, your will would not be free.  This explains what the discipline of the will really means. It is just the laying of ourselves open to the voice of the living God, speaking within us.  As we do this, day by day, the will itself becomes braced and strengthened, so that the struggle against the"]]]
