Such a system of planes is called an _axial pencil_, and the three assemblages—the point-row, the pencil of rays, and the axial pencil—are called _fundamental forms_. The fact that they may all be set into one-to-one correspondence with each other is expressed by saying that they are of the same order. It is usual also to speak of them as of the first order. We shall see presently that there are other assemblages which cannot be put into this sort of one-to-one correspondence with the points on a line, and that they will very reasonably be said to be of a higher order.     *8. Perspective position.*  We have said that a point-row and a pencil of rays are in perspective position if each ray of the pencil goes through the point of the point-row which corresponds to it. Two pencils of rays are also said to be in perspective position if corresponding rays meet on a straight line which is called the axis of perspectivity. Also, two point-rows are said to be in perspective position if corresponding points lie on straight lines through a point which is called the center of perspectivity. A point-row and an axial pencil are in perspective position if each plane of the pencil goes through the point on the point-row which corresponds to it, and an axial pencil and a pencil of rays are in perspective position if each ray lies in the plane which corresponds to it; and, finally, two axial pencils are perspectively related if corresponding planes meet in a plane.     *9. Projective relation.*  It is easy to imagine a more general correspondence between the points of two point-rows than the one just described. If we take two perspective pencils, _A_ and _S_, then a point-row _a_ perspective to _A_ will be in one-to-one correspondence with a point-row _b_ perspective to _B_, but corresponding points will not, in general, lie on lines which all pass through a point. Two such point-rows are said to be _projectively related_, or simply projective to each other. Similarly, two pencils of rays, or of planes, are projectively related to each other if they are perspective to two perspective point-rows. This idea will be generalized later on. It is important to note that between the elements of two projective fundamental forms there is a one-to-one correspondence, and also that this correspondence is in general _continuous_; that is, by taking two elements of one form sufficiently close to each other, the two corresponding elements in the other form may be made to approach each other arbitrarily close. In the case of point-rows this continuity is subject to exception in the neighborhood of the point \"at infinity.\"     *10. Infinity-to-one correspondence.*  It might be inferred that any infinite assemblage could be put into one-to-one correspondence with any other. Such is not the case, however, if the correspondence is to be continuous, between the points on a line and the points on a plane. Consider two lines which lie in different planes, and take _m_ points on one and _n_ points on the other. The number of lines joining the _m_ points of one to the _n_ points jof the other is clearly _mn_. If we symbolize the totality of points on a line by [infinity], then a reasonable symbol for the totality of lines drawn to cut two lines would be [infinity]2. Clearly, for every point on one line there are [infinity] lines cutting across the other, so that the correspondence might be called [infinity]-to-one. Thus the assemblage of lines cutting across two lines is of higher order than the assemblage of points on a line; and as we have called the point-row an assemblage of the first order, the system of lines cutting across two lines ought to be called of the second order.     *11. Infinitudes of different orders.*  Now it is easy to set up a one-to-one correspondence between the points in a plane and the system of lines cutting across two lines which lie in different planes. In fact, each line of the system of lines meets the plane in one point, and each point in the plane determines one and only one line cutting across the two given lines—namely, the line of intersection of the two planes determined by the given point with each of the given lines. The assemblage of points in the plane is thus of the same order as that of the lines cutting across two lines which lie in different planes, and ought therefore to be spoken of as of the second order. We express all these results as follows:     *12.*  If the infinitude of points on a line is taken as the infinitude of the first order, then the infinitude of lines in a pencil of rays and the infinitude of planes in an axial pencil are also of the first order, while the infinitude of lines cutting across two \"skew\" lines, as well as the infinitude of points in a plane, are of the second order.     *13.*  If we join each of the points of a plane to a point not in that plane, we set up a one-to-one correspondence between the points in a plane and the lines through a point in space. _Thus the infinitude of lines through a point in space is of the second order._     *14.*  If to each line through a point in space we make correspond that plane at right angles to it and passing through the same point, we see that _the infinitude of planes through a point in space is of the second order._     *15.*  If to each plane through a point in space we make correspond the line in which it intersects a given plane, we see that _the infinitude of lines in a plane is of the second order._ This may also be seen by setting up a one-to-one correspondence between the points on a plane and the lines of that plane. Thus, take a point _S_ not in the plane. Join any point _M_ of the plane to _S_. Through _S_ draw a plane at right angles to _MS_. This meets the given plane in a line _m_ which may be taken as corresponding to the point _M_. Another very important method of setting up a one-to-one correspondence between lines and points in a plane will be given later, and many weighty consequences will be derived from it.     *16. Plane system and point system.*  The plane, considered as made up of the points and lines in it, is called a _plane system_  and is a fundamental form of the second order. The point, considered as made up of all the lines and planes passing through it, is called a _point system_ and is also a fundamental form of the second order.     *17.*  If now we take three lines in space all lying in different planes, and select _l_ points on the first, _m_ points on the second, and _n_ points on the third, then the total number of planes passing through one of the selected points on each line will be _lmn_. It is reasonable, therefore, to symbolize the totality of planes that are determined by the [infinity] points on each of the three lines by [infinity]3, and to call it an infinitude of the _third_  order. But it is easily seen that every plane in space is included in this totality, so that _the totality of planes in space is an infinitude of the third order._     *18.*  Consider now the planes perpendicular to these three lines. Every set of three planes so drawn will determine a point in space, and, conversely, through every point in space may be drawn one and only one set of three planes at right angles to the three given lines. It follows, therefore, that _the totality of points in space is an infinitude of the third order._     *19. Space system.*  Space of three dimensions, considered as made up of all its planes and points, is then a fundamental form of the _third_ order, which we shall call a _space system._     *20. Lines in space.*  If we join the twofold infinity of points in one plane with the twofold infinity of points in another plane, we get a totality of lines of space which is of the fourth order of infinity. _The totality of lines in space gives, then, a fundamental form of the fourth order._     *21. Correspondence between points and numbers.*  In the theory of analytic geometry a one-to-one correspondence is assumed to exist between points on a line and numbers. In order to justify this assumption a very extended definition of number must be made use of. A one-to-one correspondence is then set up between points in the plane and pairs of numbers, and also between points in space and sets of three numbers. A single constant will serve to define the position of a point on a line; two, a point in the plane; three, a point in space; etc. In the same theory a one-to-one correspondence is set up between loci in the plane and equations in two variables; between surfaces in space and equations in three variables; etc. The equation of a line in a plane involves two constants, either of which may take an infinite number of values. From this it follows that there is an infinity of lines in the plane which is of the second order if the infinity of points on a line is assumed to be of the first. In the same way a circle is determined by three conditions; a sphere by four; etc. We might then expect to be able to set up a one-to-one correspondence between circles in a plane and points, or planes in space, or between spheres and lines in space. Such, indeed, is the case, and it is often possible to infer theorems concerning spheres from theorems concerning lines, and vice versa. It is possibilities such as these that, give to the theory of one-to-one correspondence its great importance for the mathematician. It must not be forgotten, however, that we are considering only _continuous_  correspondences. It is perfectly possible to set, up a one-to-one correspondence between the points of a line and the points of a plane, or, indeed, between the points of a line and the points of a space of any finite number of dimensions, if the correspondence is not restricted to be continuous.     *22. Elements at infinity.*  A final word is necessary in order to explain a phrase which is in constant use in the study of projective"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17001"],["title","An Elementary Course in Synthetic Projective Geometry (#3)"],["body",". We have spoken of the \"point at infinity\" on a straight line—a fictitious point only used to bridge over the exceptional case when we are setting up a one-to-one correspondence between the points of a line and the lines through a point. We speak of it as \"a point\" and not as \"points,\" because in the geometry studied by Euclid we assume only one line through a point parallel to a given line. In the same sense we speak of all the points at infinity in a plane as lying on a line, \"the line at infinity,\" because the straight line is the simplest locus we can imagine which has only one point in common with any line in the plane. Likewise we speak of the \"plane at infinity,\" because that seems the most convenient way of imagining the points at infinity in space. It must not be inferred that these conceptions have any essential connection with physical facts, or that other means of picturing to ourselves the infinitely distant configurations are not possible. In other branches of mathematics, notably in the theory of functions of a complex variable, quite different assumptions are made and quite different conceptions of the elements at infinity are used. As we can know nothing experimentally about such things, we are at liberty to make any assumptions we please, so long as they are consistent and serve some useful purpose.     PROBLEMS   1. Since there is a threefold infinity of points in space, there must be a sixfold infinity of pairs of points in space. Each pair of points determines a line. Why, then, is there not a sixfold infinity of lines in space?  2. If there is a fourfold infinity of lines in space, why is it that there is not a fourfold infinity of planes through a point, seeing that each line in space determines a plane through that point?  3. Show that there is a fourfold infinity of circles in space that pass through a fixed point. (Set up a one-to-one correspondence between the axes of the circles and lines in space.)  4. Find the order of infinity of all the lines of space that cut across a given line; across two given lines; across three given lines; across four given lines.  5. Find the order of infinity of all the spheres in space that pass through a given point; through two given points; through three given points; through four given points.  6. Find the order of infinity of all the circles on a sphere; of all the circles on a sphere that pass through a fixed point; through two fixed points; through three fixed points; of all the circles in space; of all the circles that cut across a given line.  7. Find the order of infinity of all lines tangent to a sphere; of all planes tangent to a sphere; of lines and planes tangent to a sphere and passing through a fixed point.  8. Set up a one-to-one correspondence between the series of numbers _1_, _2_, _3_, _4_, ... and the series of even numbers _2_, _4_, _6_, _8_ .... Are we justified in saying that there are just as many even numbers as there are numbers altogether?  9. Is the axiom \"The whole is greater than one of its parts\" applicable to infinite assemblages?  10. Make out a classified list of all the infinitudes of the first, second, third, and fourth orders mentioned in this chapter.      CHAPTER II - RELATIONS BETWEEN FUNDAMENTAL FORMS IN ONE-TO-ONE CORRESPONDENCE WITH EACH OTHER     *23. Seven fundamental forms.*  In the preceding chapter we have called attention to seven fundamental forms: the point-row, the pencil of rays, the axial pencil, the plane system, the point system, the space system, and the system of lines in space. These fundamental forms are the material which we intend to use in building up a general theory which will be found to include ordinary geometry as a special case. We shall be concerned, not with measurement of angles and areas or line segments as in the study of Euclid, but in combining and comparing these fundamental forms and in \"generating\" new forms by means of them. In problems of construction we shall make no use of measurement, either of angles or of segments, and except in certain special applications of the general theory we shall not find it necessary to require more of ourselves than the ability to draw the line joining two points, or to find the point of intersections of two lines, or the line of intersection of two planes, or, in general, the common elements of two fundamental forms.     *24. Projective properties.*  Our chief interest in this chapter will be the discovery of relations between the elements of one form which hold between the corresponding elements of any other form in one-to-one correspondence with it. We have already called attention to the danger of assuming that whatever relations hold between the elements of one assemblage must also hold between the corresponding elements of any assemblage in one-to-one correspondence with it. This false assumption is the basis of the so-called \"proof by analogy\" so much in vogue among speculative theorists. When it appears that certain relations existing between the points of a given point-row do not necessitate the same relations between the corresponding elements of another in one-to-one correspondence with it, we should view with suspicion any application of the \"proof by analogy\" in realms of thought where accurate judgments are not so easily made. For example, if in a given point-row _u_ three points, _A_, _B_, and _C_, are taken such that _B_ is the middle point of the segment _AC_, it does not follow that the three points _A’_, _B’_, _C’_ in a point-row perspective to _u_ will be so related. Relations between the elements of any form which do go over unaltered to the corresponding elements of a form projectively related to it are called _projective relations._ Relations involving measurement of lines or of angles are not projective.     *25. Desargues’s theorem.*  We consider first the following beautiful theorem, due to Desargues and called by his name.  _If two triangles, __A__, __B__, __C__ and __A’__, __B’__, __C’__, are so situated that the lines __AA’__, __BB’__, and __CC’__ all meet in a point, then the pairs of sides __AB__ and __A’B’__, __BC__ and __B’C’__, __CA__ and __C’A’__ all meet on a straight line, and conversely._                                  [Figure 3]                                    FIG. 3   Let the lines _AA’_, _BB’_, and _CC’_ meet in the point _M_ (Fig. 3). Conceive of the figure as in space, so that _M_ is the vertex of a trihedral angle of which the given triangles are plane sections. The lines _AB_ and _A’B’_ are in the same plane and must meet when produced, their point of intersection being clearly a point in the plane of each triangle and therefore in the line of intersection of these two planes. Call this point _P_. By similar reasoning the point _Q_ of intersection of the lines _BC_ and _B’C’_ must lie on this same line as well as the point _R_ of intersection of _CA_ and _C’A’_. Therefore the points _P_, _Q_, and _R_ all lie on the same line _m_. If now we consider the figure a plane figure, the points _P_, _Q_, and _R_ still all lie on a straight line, which proves the theorem. The converse is established in the same manner.     *26. Fundamental theorem concerning two complete quadrangles.* This theorem throws into our hands the following fundamental theorem concerning two complete quadrangles, a _complete quadrangle_  being defined as the figure obtained by joining any four given points by straight lines in the six possible ways.  _Given two complete quadrangles, __K__, __L__, __M__, __N__ and __K’__, __L’__, __M’__, __N’__, so related that __KL__, __K’L’__, __MN__, __M’N’__ all meet in a point __A__; __LM__, __L’M’__, __NK__, __N’K’__ all meet in a __ point __Q__; and __LN__, __L’N’__ meet in a point __B__ on the line __AC__; then the lines __KM__ and __K’M’__ also meet in a point __D__ on the line __AC__._                                  [Figure 4]                                    FIG. 4   For, by the converse of the last theorem, _KK’_, _LL’_, and _NN’_ all meet in a point _S_ (Fig. 4). Also _LL’_, _MM’_, and _NN’_ meet in a point, and therefore in the same point _S_. Thus _KK’_, _LL’_, and _MM’_ meet in a point, and so, by Desargues’s theorem itself, _A_, _B_, and _D_ are on a straight line.     *27. Importance of the theorem.*  The importance of this theorem lies in the fact that, _A_, _B_, and _C_ being given, an indefinite number of quadrangles _K’_, _L’_, _M’_, _N’_ my be found such that _K’L’_ and _M’N’_ meet in _A_, _K’N’_ and _L’M’_ in _C_, with _L’N’_ passing through _B_. Indeed, the lines _AK’_ and _AM’_ may be drawn arbitrarily through _A_, and any line through _B_ may be used to determine _L’_ and _N’_. By joining these two points to _C_ the points _K’_ and _M’_ are determined. Then the line joining _K’_ and _M’_, found in this way, must pass through the point _D_ already determined by the quadrangle _K_, _L_, _M_, _N_. _The three points __A__, __B__, __C__, given in order, serve thus to determine a fourth point __D__._     *28.*  In a complete quadrangle the line joining any two points is called the _opposite side_  to the line joining the other two points. The result of the preceding paragraph may then be stated as follows:  Given three points, _A_, _B_, _C_, in a straight line, if a pair of opposite sides of a complete quadrangle pass through _A_, and another pair through _C_, and one of the remaining two sides goes through _B_, then the other of the remaining two sides will go through a fixed point which does not depend on the quadrangle employed.     *29. Four harmonic points.*  Four points, _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_, related as in the preceding theorem are called _four harmonic points_. The point _D_ is called the _fourth harmonic of __B__ with respect to __A__ and __C_. Since _B_ and _D_ play exactly the same rôle in the above construction, _B__ is also the fourth harmonic of __D__ with respect to __A__ and __C_. _B_ and _D_ are called _harmonic conjugates with respect to __A__ and"]]]
