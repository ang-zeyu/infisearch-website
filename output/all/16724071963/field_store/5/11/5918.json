Akem-manô strikes, but Vohu-manô shall strike him in his turn; the lying word shall strike, but the word of truth shall strike him in his turn; Haurvatât and Ameretâfc shall strike down hunger and thirst; Haurvatât and Ameretât shall strike down terrible hunger and terrible thirst.”  Angrô-mainyus himself shall be paralysed with terror, and shall be forced to confess the supremacy of good: he shall withdraw into the depths of hell, whence he shall never again issue forth, and all the reanimated beings devoted to the Mazdean law shall live an eternity of peace and contentment.  Man, therefore, incessantly distracted between the two principles, laid wait for by the Baęvas, defended by the Yazatas, must endeavour to act according to law and justice in the condition in which fate has placed him. He has been raised up here on earth to contribute as far as in him lies to the increase of life and of good, and in proportion as he works for this end or against it, is he the _ashavan_, the pure, the faithful one on earth and the blessed one in heaven, or the _anashavan_, the lawless miscreant who counteracts purity. The highest grade in the hierarchy of men belongs of right to the Mage or the _âthravan_, to the priest whose voice inspires the demons with fear, or the soldier whose club despatches the impious, but a place of honour at their side is assigned to the peasant, who reclaims from the power of Angrô-mainyus the dry and sterile fields. Among the places where the earth thrives most joyously is reckoned that “where a worshipper of Ahura-mazdâ builds a house, with a chaplain, with cattle, with a wife, with sons, with a fair flock; where man grows the most corn, herbage, and fruit trees; where he spreads water on a soil without water, and drains off water where there is too much of it.” He who sows corn, sows good, and promotes the Mazdean faith; “he nourishes the Mazdean religion as fifty men would do rocking a child in the cradle, five hundred women giving it suck from their breasts.* When the corn was created the Daęvas leaped, when it sprouted the Daęvas lost courage, when the stem set the Daęvas wept, when the ear swelled the Daęvas fled. In the house where corn is mouldering the Daęvas lodge, but when the corn sprouts, one might say that a hot iron is being turned round in their mouths.” And the reason of their horror is easily divined: “Whoso eats not, has no power either to accomplish a valiant work of religion, or to labour with valour, or yet to beget children valiantly; it is by eating that the universe lives, and it dies from not eating.” The faithful follower of Zoroaster owes no obligation towards the impious man or towards a stranger,** but is ever bound to render help to his coreligionist.       * The original text says in a more enigmatical fashion, “he      nourishes the religion of Mazdâ as a hundred feet of men and      a thousand breasts of women might do.”       ** Charity is called in Parsee language, _ashô-dâd_ the      _gift to a pious man_, or the _gift of piety_, and the pious      man, the _ashavan_, is by definition the worshipper of      Ahura-mazdâ alone.  He will give a garment to the naked, and by so doing will wound Zemaka, the demon of winter. He will never refuse food to the hungry labourer, under pain of eternal torments, and his charity will extend even to the brute beasts, provided that they belong to the species created by Ahura-mazdâ: he has duties towards them, and their complaints, heard in heaven, shall be fatal to him later on if he has provoked them. Asha-vahista will condemn to hell the cruel man who has ill-treated the ox, or allowed his flocks to suffer; and the killing of a hedgehog is no less severely punished--for does not a hedgehog devour the ants who steal the grain? The dog is in every case an especially sacred animal--the shepherd’s dog, the watchdog, the hunting-dog, even the prowling dog. It is not lawful to give any dog a blow which renders him impotent, or to slit his ears, or to cut his foot, without incurring grave responsibilities in this world and in the next; it is necessary to feed the dog well, and not to throw bones to him which are too hard, nor have his food served hot enough to burn his tongue or his throat. For the rest, the faithful Zoroastrian was bound to believe in his god, to offer to him the orthodox prayers and sacrifices, to be simple in heart, truthful, the slave of his pledged word, loyal in his very smallest acts. If he had once departed from the right way, he could only return to it by repentance and by purification, accompanied by pious deeds: to exterminate noxious animals, the creatures of Angrô-mainyus and the abode of his demons, such as the frog, the scorpion, the serpent or the ant, to clear the sterile tracts, to restore impoverished land, to construct bridges over running water, to distribute implements of husbandry to pions men, or to build them a house, to give a pure and healthy maiden in marriage to a just man,--these were so many means of expiation appointed by the prophet.* Marriage was strictly obligatory,** and seemed more praiseworthy in proportion as the kinship existing between the married pair was the closer: not only was the sister united in marriage to her brother, as in Egypt, but the father to his daughter, and the mother to her son, at least among the Magi.       * A passage in the _Vendidad_ even enumerates how many      noisome beasts must be slain to accomplish one full work of      expiation--“to kill 1000 serpents of those who drag      themselves upon the belly, and 2000 of the other species,      1000 land frogs or 2000 water frogs, 1000 ants who steal the      grain,” and so on.       ** The _Vendidad_ says, “And I tell thee, O Spitama      Zarathustra, the man who has a wife is above him who lives      in continency;” and, as we have seen in the text, one of      these forms of expiation consisted in “marrying to a worthy      man a young girl who has never known a man” (_Vendidad_, 14,      § 15). Herodotus of old remarked that one of the chief      merits in an Iranian was to have many children: the King of      Persia encouraged fecundity in his realm, and awarded a      prize each year to that one of his subjects who could boast      the most numerous progeny.  Polygamy was also encouraged and widely practised: the code imposed no limit on the number of wives and concubines, and custom was in favour of a man’s having as many wives as his fortune permitted him to maintain. On the occasion of a death, it was forbidden to burn the corpse, to bury it, or to cast it into a river, as it would have polluted the fire, the earth, or the water--an unpardonable offence. The corpse could be disposed of in different ways. The Persians were accustomed to cover it with a thick layer of wax, and then to bury it in the ground: the wax coating obviated the pollution which direct contact would have brought upon the soil. The Magi, and probably also strict devotees, following their example, exposed the corpse in the open air, abandoning it to the birds or beasts of prey. It was considered a great misfortune if these respected the body, for it was an almost certain indication of the wrath of Ahura-mazdâ, and it was thought that the defunct had led an evil life. When the bones had been sufficiently stripped of flesh, they were collected together, and deposited either in an earthenware urn or in a stone ossuary with a cover, or in a monumental tomb either hollowed out in the heart of the mountain or in the living rock, or raised up above the level of the ground. Meanwhile the soul remained in the neighbourhood for three days, hovering near the head of the corpse, and by the recitation of prayers it experienced, according to its condition of purity or impurity, as much of joy or sadness as the whole world experiences. When the third night was past, the just soul set forth across luminous plains, refreshed by a perfumed breeze, and its good thoughts and words and deeds took shape before it “under the guise of a young maiden, radiant and strong, with well-developed bust, noble mien, and glorious face, about fifteen years of age, and as beautiful as the most beautiful;” the unrighteous soul, on the contrary, directed its course towards the north, through a tainted land, amid the squalls of a pestilential hurricane, and there encountered its past ill deeds, under the form of an ugly and wicked young woman, the ugliest and most wicked it had ever seen. The genius Rashnu Razishta, the essentially truthful, weighed its virtues or vices in an unerring balance, and acquitted or Condemned it on the impartial testimony of its past life. On issuing from the judgment-hall, the soul arrived at the approach to the bridge Cinvaut, which, thrown across the abyss of hell, led to paradise. The soul, if impious, was unable to cross this bridge, but was hurled down into the abyss, where it became the slave of Angrô-mainyus. If pure, it crossed the bridge without difficulty by the help of the angel Sraôsha, and was welcomed by Vohu-manô, who conducted it before the throne of Ahura-mazdâ, in the same way as he had led Zoroaster, and assigned to it the post which it should occupy until the day of the resurrection of the body.*       * All this picture of the fate of the soul is taken from the      _Vendidad_, where the fate of the just is described, and in      the _Yasht_, where the condition of faithful and impious      souls respectively is set forth on parallel lines. The      classical authors teach us nothing on this subject, and the      little they actually "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17329"],["title","History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 9 (of 12) (#5)"],["body","only proves that the Persians      believed in the immortality of the soul. The main outlines      of the picture here set forth go back to the times of the      Achćmenids and the Medes, except the abstract conception of      the goddess who leads the soul of the dead as an incarnation      of his good or evil deeds.  The religious observances enjoined on the members of the priestly caste were innumerable and minute. Ahura-mazdâ and his colleagues had not, as was the fashion among the Assyrians and Egyptians, either temples or tabernacles, and though they were represented sometimes under human or animal forms, and even in some cases on bas-reliefs, yet no one ever ventured to set up in their sanctuaries those so-called animated or prophetic statues to which the majority of the nations had rendered or were rendering their solicitous homage. Altars, however, were erected on the tops of hills, in palaces, or in the centre of cities, on which fires were kindled in honour of the inferior deities or of the supreme god himself.  [Illustration: 031.jpg THE TWO IRANIAN ALTAKRAT NAKHSH-Î-RUSTEM]       Drawn by Boudier, from a heliogravure in Marcel Dieulafoy.  Two altars were usually set up together, and they are thus found here and there among the ruins, as at Nakhsh-î-Kustem, the necropolis of Persepolis, where a pair of such altars exist; these are cut, each out of a single block, in a rocky mass which rises some thirteen feet above the level of the surrounding plain. They are of cubic form and squat appearance, looking like towers flanked at the four corners by supporting columns which are connected by circular arches; above a narrow moulding rises a crest of somewhat triangular projections; the hearth is hollowed out on the summit of each altar.*       * According to Perrot and Chipiez, “it is not impossible      that these altars were older than the great buildings of      Persepolis, and that they were erected for the old Persian      town which Darius raised to the position of capital.”  At Meshed-î-Murgâb, on the site of the ancient Pasargadas, the altars have disappeared, but the basements on which they were erected are still visible, as also the flight of eight steps by which they were approached. Those altars on which burned, a perpetual fire were not left exposed to the open air: they would have run too great a risk of contracting impurities, such as dust borne by the wind, flights of birds, dew, rain, or snow. They were enclosed in slight structures, well protected by walls, and attaining in some cases considerable dimensions, or in pavilion-shaped edifices of stone adorned with columns.  [Illustration: 032.jpg THE TWO IRANIAN ALTARS OF MURGAB]       Drawn by Boudier, from Plandin and Coste.  The sacrificial rites were of long duration, and frequent, and were rendered very complex by interminable manual acts, ceremonial gestures, and incantations.  [Illustration: 032b.jpg THE OCCUPATIONS OF ANI IN THE ELYSIAN FIELDS]  In cases where the altar was not devoted to maintaining a perpetual fire, it was kindled when necessary with small twigs previously barked and purified, and was subsequently fed with precious woods, preferably cypress or laurel;* care was taken not to quicken the flame by blowing, for the human breath would have desecrated the fire by merely passing over it; death was the punishment for any one who voluntarily committed such a heinous sacrilege. The recognised offering consisted of flowers, bread, fruit, and perfumes, but these were often accompanied, as in all ancient religions, by a bloody sacrifice; the sacrifice of a horse was considered the most efficacious, but an ox, a cow, a sheep, a camel, an ass, or a stag was frequently offered: in certain circumstances, especially when it was desired to conciliate the favour of the god of the underworld, a human victim, probably as a survival of very ancient rites was preferred.**       * Pausanias, who witnessed the cult as practised at      Hierocćsarsea, remarked the curious colour of the ashes      heaped upon the altar.       * Most modern writers deny the authenticity of Herodotus’      account, because a sacrifice of this kind is opposed to the      spirit of the Magian religion, which is undoubtedly the      case, as far as the latest form of the religion is      concerned; but the testimony of Herodotus is so plain that      the fact itself must be considered as indisputable. We may      note that the passage refers to the foundation of a city;      and if we remember how persistent was the custom of human      sacrifice among ancient races at the foundation of      buildings, we shall be led to the conclusion that the      ceremony described by the Greek historian was a survival of      a very ancient usage, which had not yet fallen entirely into      desuetude at the Achćmenian epoch.  [Illustration: 033.jpg THE SACRED FIRE BURNING ON THE ALTAR]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the impression of a Persian      intaglio.  The king, whose royal position made him the representative of Ahura-mazdâ on earth, was, in fact, a high priest, and was himself able to officiate at the altar, but no one else could dispense with the mediation of the Magi. The worshippers proceeded in solemn procession to the spot where the ceremony was to take place, and there the priest, wearing the tiara on his head, recited an invocation in a slow and mysterious voice, and implored the blessings of heaven on the king and nation. He then slaughtered the victim by a blow on the head, and divided it into portions, which he gave back to the offerer without reserving any of them, for Ahura-mazdâ required nothing but the soul; in certain cases, the victim was entirely consumed by fire, but more frequently nothing but a little of the fat and some of the entrails were taken to feed and maintain the flame, and sometimes even this was omitted.* Sacrifices were of frequent occurrence. Without mentioning the extraordinary occasions on which a king would have a thousand bulls slain at one time,** the Achćmenian kings killed each day a thousand bullocks, asses, and stags: sacrifice under such circumstances was another name for butchery, the object of which was to furnish the court with a sufficient supply of pure meat. The ceremonial bore resemblance in many ways to that still employed by the modern Zoroastrians of Persia and India.       * A relic of this custom may be discerned in the expiatory      sacrifice decreed in the _Vendidad_: “He shall sacrifice a      thousand head of small cattle, and he shall place their      entrails devoutly on the fire, with libations.”       ** The number 1000 seems to have had some ritualistic      significance, for it often recurs in the penances imposed on      the faithful as expiation for their sins: thus it was      enjoined to slay 1000 serpents, 1000 frogs, 1000 ants who      steal the grain, 1000 head of small cattle, 1000 swift      horses, 1000 camels, 1000 brown oxen.  The officiating priest covered his mouth with the bands which fell from his mitre, to prevent the god from being polluted by his breath; he held in his hand the baresman, or sacred bunch of tamarisk, and prepared the mysterious liquor from the haoma plant.* He was accustomed each morning to celebrate divine service before the sacred fire, not to speak of the periodic festivals in which he shared the offices with all the members of his tribe, such as the feast of Mithra, the feast of the Fravashis,** the feast commemorating the rout of Angrô-mainyus,*** the feast of the Saksea, during which the slaves were masters of the house.****       * The drink mentioned by the author of the _De Iside_, which      was extracted from the plant Omômi, and which the Magi      offered to the god of the underworld, is certainly the      haoma. The rite mentioned by the Greek author, which appears      to be an incantation against Ahriman, required, it seems, a      potion in which the blood of a wolf was a necessary      ingredient: this questionable draught was then carried to a      place where the sun’s rays never shone, and was there      sprinkled on the ground as a libation.       ** Menander speaks of this festival as conducted in his own      times, and tells us that it was called Eurdigan; modern      authorities usually admit that it goes back to the times of      the Achćmenids or even beyond.       *** Agathias says that every worshipper of Ahura-mazdâ is      enjoined to kill the greatest possible number of animals      created by Angrô-mainyus, and bring to the Magi the fruits      of his hunting. Herodotus had already spoken of this      destruction of life as one of the duties incumbent on every      Persian, and this gives probability to the view of modern      writers that the festival went back to the Achćmenian epoch.       **** The festival of the Sakoa is mentioned by Ctesias. It      was also a Babylonian festival, and most modern authorities      conclude from this double use of the name that the festival      was borrowed from the Babylonians by the Persians, but this      point is not so certain as it is made out to be, and at any      rate the borrowing must have taken place very early, for the      festival was already well established in the Achćmenian      period.  All the Magi were not necessarily devoted to the priesthood; but those only became apt in the execution of their functions who had been dedicated to them from infancy, and who, having received the necessary instruction, were duly consecrated. These adepts were divided into several classes, of which three at least were never confounded in their functions--the sorcerers, the interpreters of dreams, and the most venerated sages--and from these three classes were chosen the ruling body of the order and its supreme head. Their rule of life was strict and austere, and was encumbered with a thousand observances indispensable to the preservation of perfect purity in their persons, their altars,"]]]
