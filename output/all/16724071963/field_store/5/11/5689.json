Thus several weeks had passed, and Ernest no longer exclusively occupied her mind when, one day early in September, while glancing over a magazine, she came upon his name in the table of contents. Once more she saw the boy's wistful face before her, and a trembling something stirred in her heart. Her hand shook as she cut the pages, and a mist of tears clouded her vision as she attempted to read his poem. It was a piece of sombre brilliance. Like black-draped monks half crazed with mystic devotion, the poet's thoughts flitted across the page. It was the wail of a soul that feels reason slipping from it and beholds madness rise over its life like a great pale moon. A strange unrest emanated from it and took possession of her. And again, with an insight that was prophetic, she distinctly recognised behind the vague fear that had haunted the poet the figure of Reginald Clarke.  A half-forgotten dream, struggling to consciousness, staggered her by its vividness. She saw Clarke as she had seen him in days gone by, grotesquely transformed into a slimy sea-thing, whose hungry mouths shut sucking upon her and whose thousand tentacles encircled her form. She closed her eyes in horror at the reminiscence. And in that moment it became clear to her that she must take into her hands the salvation of Ernest Fielding from the clutches of the malign power that had mysteriously enveloped his life.     XIX   The summer was brief, and already by the middle of September many had returned to the pleasures of urban life. Ethel was among the first-comers; for, after her resolve to enter the life of the young poet once more, it would have been impossible for her to stay away from the city much longer. Her plan was all ready. Before attempting to see Ernest she would go to meet Reginald and implore him to free the boy from his hideous spell. An element of curiosity unconsciously entered her determination. When, years ago, she and Clarke had parted, the man had seemed, for once, greatly disturbed and had promised, in his agitation, that some day he would communicate to her what would exonerate him in her eyes. She had answered that all words between them were purposeless, and that she hoped never to see his face again. The experience that the years had brought to her, instead of elucidating the mystery of Reginald's personality, had, on the contrary, made his behaviour appear more and more unaccountable. She had more than once caught herself wishing to meet him again and to analyse dispassionately the puzzling influences he had exerted upon her. And she could at last view him dispassionately; there was triumph in that. She was dimly aware that something had passed from her, something by which he had held her, and without which his magnetism was unable to play upon her.  So when Walkham sent her an invitation to one of his artistic \"at homes\" she accepted, in the hope of meeting Reginald. It was his frequentation of Walkham's house that had for several years effectively barred her foot from crossing the threshold. It was with a very strange feeling she greeted the many familiar faces at Walkham's now; and when, toward ten o'clock, Reginald entered, politely bowing in answer to the welcome from all sides, her heart beat in her like a drum. But she calmed herself, and, catching his eye, so arranged it that early in the evening they met in an alcove of the drawing-room.  \"It was inevitable,\" Reginald said. \"I expected it.\"  \"Yes,\" she replied, \"we were bound to meet.\"  Like a great rush of water, memory came back to her. He was still horribly fascinating as of old--only she was no longer susceptible to his fascination. He had changed somewhat in those years. The lines about his mouth had grown harder and a steel-like look had come into his eyes. Only for a moment, as he looked at her, a flash of tenderness seemed to come back to them. Then he said, with a touch of sadness: \"Why should the first word between us be a lie?\"  Ethel made no answer.  Reginald looked at her half in wonder and said: \"And is your love for the boy so great that it overcame your hate of me?\"  Ah, he knew! She winced.  \"He has told you?\"  \"Not a word.\"  There was something superhuman in his power of penetration. Why should she wear a mask before him, when his eyes, like the eyes of God, pierced to the core of her being?  \"No,\" she replied, \"it is not love, but compassion for him.\"  \"Compassion?\"  \"Yes, compassion for your victim.\"  \"You mean?\"  \"Reginald!\"  \"I am all ear.\"  \"I implore you.\"  \"Speak.\"  \"You have ruined one life.\"  He raised his eyebrows derogatively.  \"Yes,\" she continued fiercely, \"ruined it! Is not that enough?\"  \"I have never wilfully ruined any one's life.\"  \"You have ruined mine.\"  \"Wilfully?\"  \"How else shall I explain your conduct?\"  \"I warned you.\"  \"Warning, indeed! The warning that the snake gives to the sparrow helpless under its gaze.\"  \"Ah, but who tells you that the snake is to blame? Is it not rather the occult power that prescribes with blood on brazen scroll the law of our being?\"  \"This is no solace to the sparrow. But whatever may be said, let us drop the past. Let us consider the present. I beg of you, leave this boy--let him develop without your attempting to stifle the life in him or impressing upon it the stamp of your alien mind.\"  \"Ethel,\" he protested, \"you are unjust. If you knew--\" Then an idea seemed to take hold of him. He looked at her curiously.  \"What if I knew?\" she asked.  \"You shall know,\" he said, simply. \"Are you strong?\"  \"Strong to withstand anything at your hand. There is nothing that you can give me, nothing that you can take away.\"  \"No,\" he remarked, \"nothing. Yes, you have changed. Still, when I look upon you, the ghosts of the past seem to rise like live things.\"  \"We both have changed. We meet now upon equal grounds. You are no longer the idol I made of you.\"  \"Don't you think that to the idol this might be a relief, not a humiliation? It is a terrible torture to sit in state with lips eternally shut. Sometimes there comes over the most reticent of us a desire to break through the eternal loneliness that surrounds the soul. It is this feeling that prompts madmen to tear off their clothes and exhibit their nakedness in the market-place. It's madness on my part, or a whim, or I don't know what; but it pleases me that you should know the truth.\"  \"You promised me long ago that I should.\"  \"To-day I will redeem my promise, and I will tell you another thing that you will find hard to believe.\"  \"And that is?\"  \"That I loved you.\"  Ethel smiled a little sceptically. \"You have loved often.\"  \"No,\" he replied. \"Loved, seriously loved, I have, only once.\"     XX   They were sitting in a little Italian restaurant where they had often, in the old days, lingered late into the night over a glass of Lacrim√¶ Christi. But no pale ghost of the past rose from the wine. Only a wriggling something, with serpent eyes, that sent cold shivers down her spine and held her speechless and entranced.  When their order had been filled and the waiter had posted himself at a respectful distance, Reginald began--at first leisurely, a man of the world. But as he proceeded a strange exultation seemed to possess him and from his eyes leaped the flame of the mystic.  \"You must pardon me,\" he commenced, \"if I monopolise the conversation, but the revelations I have to make are of such a nature that I may well claim your attention. I will start with my earliest childhood. You remember the picture of me that was taken when I was five?\"  She remembered, indeed. Each detail of his life was deeply engraven on her mind.  \"At that time,\" he continued, \"I was not held to be particularly bright. The reason was that my mind, being pre-eminently and extraordinarily receptive, needed a stimulus from without. The moment I was sent to school, however, a curious metamorphosis took place in me. I may say that I became at once the most brilliant boy in my class. You know that to this day I have always been the most striking figure in any circle in which I have ever moved.\"  Ethel nodded assent. Silently watching the speaker, she saw a gleam of the truth from afar, but still very distant and very dim.  Reginald lifted the glass against the light and gulped its contents. Then in a lower voice he recommenced: \"Like the chameleon, I have the power of absorbing the colour of my environment.\"  \"Do you mean that you have the power of absorbing the special virtues of other people?\" she interjected.  \"That is exactly what I mean.\"  \"Oh!\" she cried, for in a heart-beat many things had become clear to her. For the first time she realised, still vaguely but with increasing vividness, the hidden causes of her ruin and, still more plainly, the horrible danger of Ernest Fielding.  He noticed her agitation, and a look of psychological curiosity came into his eyes.  \"Ah, but that is not all,\" he observed, smilingly. \"That is nothing. We all possess that faculty in a degree. The secret of my strength is my ability to reject every element that is harmful or inessential to the completion of my self. This did not come to me easily, nor without a struggle. But now, looking back upon my life, many things become transparent that were obscure even to me at the time. I can now follow the fine-spun threads in the intricate web of my fate, and discover in the wilderness of meshes a design, awful and grandly planned.\"  His voice shook with conviction, as he uttered these words. There was something strangely gruesome in this man. It was thus that she had pictured to herself the high-priest of some terrible and mysterious religion, demanding a human sacrifice to appease the hunger of his god. She was fascinated by the spell of his personality, and listened with a feeling not far removed from awe. But Reginald suddenly changed his tone and proceeded in a more conversational manner.  \"The first friend I ever cared for was a boy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17149"],["title","Creative Chemistry: Descriptive of Recent Achievements in the Chemical (#0)"],["body","(https://www.pgdp.net/)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

Some of the most picturesque features of this awakening reached the great public through the press. Thus, the adventurous trips of the _Deutschland_ with its cargoes of concentrated aniline dyes, valued at millions of dollars, emphasized as no other incident our former dependence upon Germany for these products of her chemical industries.  The public read, too, that her chemists saved Germany from an early disastrous defeat, both in the field of military operations and in the matter of economic supplies: unquestionably, without the tremendous expansion of her plants for the production of nitrates and ammonia from the air by the processes of Haber, Ostwald and others of her great chemists, the war would have ended in 1915, or early in 1916, from exhaustion of Germany's supplies of nitrate explosives, if not indeed from exhaustion of her food supplies as a consequence of the lack of nitrate and ammonia fertilizer for her fields. Inventions of substitutes for cotton, copper, rubber, wool and many other basic needs have been reported.  These feats of chemistry, performed under the stress of dire necessity, have, no doubt, excited the wonder and interest of our public. It is far more important at this time, however, when both for war and for peace needs, the resources of our country are strained to the utmost, that the public should awaken to a clear realization of what this science of chemistry really means for mankind, to the realization that its wizardry permeates the whole life of the nation as a vitalizing, protective and constructive agent very much in the same way as our blood, coursing through our veins and arteries, carries the constructive, defensive and life-bringing materials to every organ in the body.
