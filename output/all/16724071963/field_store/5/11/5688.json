Besides he knew the penalty of all tender entanglements. Women treat love as if it were an extremely tenuous wire that can be drawn out indefinitely. This is a very expensive process. It costs us the most precious, the only irretrievable thing in the universe--time. And to him time was song; for money he did not care. The Lord had hallowed his lips with rhythmic speech; only in the intervals of his singing might he listen to the voice of his heart--strangest of all watches, that tells the time not by minutes and hours, but by the coming and going of love.  The woman beside him seemed to read his thoughts.  \"Child, child,\" she said, \"why will you toy with love? Like Jehovah, he is a jealous god, and nothing but the whole heart can placate him. Woe to the woman who takes a poet for a lover. I admit it is fascinating, but it is playing _va banque_. In fact, it is fatal. Art or love will come to harm. No man can minister equally to both. A genuine poet is incapable of loving a woman.\"  \"Pshaw! You exaggerate. Of course, there is a measure of truth in what you say, but it is only one side of the truth, and the truth, you know, is always Janus-faced. In fact, it often has more than two faces. I can assure you that I have cared deeply for the women to whom my love-poetry was written. And you will not deny that it is genuine.\"  \"God forbid! Only you have been using the wrong preposition. You should have said that it was written at them.\"  Ernest stared at her in child-like wonder.  \"By Jove! you are too devilishly clever!\" he exclaimed.  After a little silence he said not without hesitation: \"And do you apply your theory to all artists, or only to us makers of rhyme?\"  \"To all,\" she replied.  He looked at her questioningly.  \"Yes,\" she said, with a new sadness in her voice, \"I, too, have paid the price.\"  \"You mean?\"  \"I loved.\"  \"And art?\"  \"That was the sacrifice.\"  \"Perhaps you have chosen the better part,\" Ernest said without conviction.  \"No,\" she replied, \"my tribute was brought in vain.\"  This she said calmly, but Ernest knew that her words were of tragic import.  \"You love him still?\" he observed simply.  Ethel made no reply. Sadness clouded her face like a veil or like a grey mist over the face of the waters. Her eyes went out to the sea, following the sombre flight of the sea-mews.  In that moment he could have taken her in his arms and kissed her with infinite tenderness.  But tenderness between man and woman is like a match in a powder-magazine. The least provocation, and an amorous explosion will ensue, tumbling down the card-houses of platonic affection. If he yielded to the impulse of the moment, the wine of the springtide would set their blood afire, and from the flames within us there is no escape.  \"Come, come,\" she said, \"you do not love me.\"  He protested.  \"Ah!\" she cried triumphantly, \"how many sonnets would you give for me? If you were a usurer in gold instead of in rhyme, I would ask how many dollars. But it is unjust to pay in a coin that we value little. To a man starving in gold mines, a piece of bread weighs more than all the treasures of the earth. To you, I warrant your poems are the standard of appreciation. How many would you give for me? One, two, three?\"  \"More.\"  \"Because you think love would repay you with compound interest,\" she observed merrily.  He laughed.  And when love turns to laughter the danger is passed for the moment.     XV   Thus three weeks passed without apparent change in their relations. Ernest possessed a personal magnetism that, always emanating from him, was felt most deeply when withdrawn. He was at all times involuntarily exerting his power, which she ever resisted, always on the alert, always warding off.  When at last pressure of work made his immediate departure for New York imperative, he had not apparently gained the least ground. But Ethel knew in her heart that she was fascinated, if not in love. The personal fascination was supplemented by a motherly feeling toward Ernest that, sensuous in essence, was in itself not far removed from love. She struggled bravely and with external success against her emotions, never losing sight of the fact that twenty and thirty are fifty.  Increasingly aware of her own weakness, she constantly attempted to lead the conversation into impersonal channels, speaking preferably of his work.  \"Tell me,\" she said, negligently fanning herself, \"what new inspiration have you drawn from your stay at the seaside?\"  \"Why,\" he exclaimed enthusiastically, \"volumes and volumes of it. I shall write the great novel of my life after I am once more quietly installed at Riverside Drive.\"  \"The great American novel?\" she rejoined.  \"Perhaps.\"  \"Who will be your hero--Clarke?\"  There was a slight touch of malice in her words, or rather in the pause between the penultimate word and the last. Ernest detected its presence, and knew that her love for Reginald was dead. Stiff and cold it lay in her heart's chamber--beside how many others?--all emboxed in the coffin of memory.  \"No,\" he replied after a while, a little piqued by her suggestion, \"Clarke is not the hero. What makes you think that he casts a spell on everything I do?\"  \"Dear child,\" she replied, \"I know him. He cannot fail to impress his powerful personality upon all with whom he comes in contact, to the injury of their intellectual independence. Moreover, he is so brilliant and says everything so much better than anybody else, that by his very splendor he discourages effort in others. At best his influence will shape your development according to the tenets of his mind--curious, subtle and corrupted. You will become mentally distorted, like one of those hunchback Japanese trees, infinitely wrinkled and infinitely grotesque, whose laws of growth are not determined by nature, but by the diseased imagination of the East.\"  \"I am no weakling,\" Ernest asserted, \"and your picture of Clarke is altogether out of perspective. His splendid successes are to me a source of constant inspiration. We have some things in common, but I realise that it is along entirely different lines that success will come to me. He has never sought to influence me, in fact, I never received the smallest suggestion from him.\" Here the Princess Marigold seemed to peer at him through the veil of the past, but he waved her aside. \"As for my story,\" he continued, \"you need not go so far out of your way to find the leading character?\"  \"Who can it be?\" Ethel remarked, with a merry twinkle, \"You?\"  \"Ethel,\" he said sulkingly, \"be serious. You know that it is you.\"  \"I am immensely flattered,\" she replied. \"Really, nothing pleases me better than to be immortalised in print, since I have little hope nowadays of perpetuating my name by virtue of pencil or brush. I have been put into novels before and am consumed with curiosity to hear the plot of yours.\"  \"If you don't mind, I had rather not tell you just yet,\" Ernest said. \"It's going to be called Leontina--that's you. But all depends on the treatment. You know it doesn't matter much what you say so long as you say it well. That's what counts. At any rate, any indication of the plot at this stage would be decidedly inadequate.\"  \"I think you are right,\" she ventured. \"By all means choose your own time to tell me. Let's talk of something else. Have you written anything since your delightful book of verse last spring? Surely now is your singing season. By the time we are thirty the springs of pure lyric passion are usually exhausted.\"  Ethel's inquiry somehow startled him. In truth, he could find no satisfactory answer. A remark relative to his play--Clarke's play--rose to the threshold of his lips, but he almost bit his tongue as soon as he realised that the strange delusion which had possessed him that night still dominated the undercurrents of his cerebration. No, he had accomplished but little during the last few months--at least, by way of creative literature. So he replied that he had made money. \"That is something,\" he said. \"Besides, who can turn out a masterpiece every week? An artist's brain is not a machine, and in the respite from creative work I have gathered strength for the future. But,\" he added, slightly annoyed, \"you are not listening.\"  His exclamation brought her back from the train of thoughts that his words had suggested. For in his reasoning she had recognised the same arguments that she had hourly repeated to herself in defence of her inactivity when she was living under the baneful influence of Reginald Clarke. Yes, baneful; for the first time she dared to confess it to herself. In a flash the truth dawned upon her that it was not her love alone, but something else, something irresistable and very mysterious, that had dried up the well of creation in her. Could it be that the same power was now exerting its influence upon the struggling soul of this talented boy? Rack her brains as she might, she could not definitely formulate her apprehensions and a troubled look came into her eyes.  \"Ethel,\" the boy repeated, impatiently, \"why are you not listening? Do you realise that I must leave you in half an hour?\"  She looked at him with deep tenderness. Something like a tear lent a soft radiance to her large child-like eyes.  Ernest saw it and was profoundly moved. In that moment he loved her passionately.  \"Foolish boy,\" she said softly; then, lowering her voice to a whisper: \"You may kiss me before you go.\"  His lips gently touched hers, but she took his head between her hands and pressed her mouth upon his in a long kiss.  Ernest drew back a little awkwardly. He had not been kissed like this before.  \"Poet though you are,\" Ethel whispered, \"you have not yet learned to kiss.\"  She was deeply agitated when she noticed that his hand was fumbling for the watch in his vest-pocket. She suddenly released him, and said, a little hurt: \"No, you must not miss your train. Go by all means.\"  Vainly Ernest"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17144"],["title","The House of the Vampire (#7)"],["body","with her.  \"Go to him,\" she said, and again, \"go to him.\"  With a heavy heart the boy obeyed. He waved his hat to her once more from below, and then rapidly disappeared in the crowd. For a moment strange misgivings cramped her heart, and something within her called out to him: \"Do not go! Do not return to that house.\" But no sound issued from her lips. Worldly wisdom had sealed them, had stifled the inner voice. And soon the boy's golden head was swallowed up in the distance.     XVI   While the train sped to New York, Ethel Brandenbourg was the one object engaging Ernest's mind. He still felt the pressure of her lips upon his, and his nostrils dilated at the thought of the fragrance of her hair brushing against his forehead.  But the moment his foot touched the ferry-boat that was to take him to Manhattan, the past three weeks were, for the time being at least, completely obliterated from his memory. All his other interests that he had suppressed in her company because she had no part in them, came rushing back to him. He anticipated with delight his meeting with Reginald Clarke. The personal attractiveness of the man had never seemed so powerful to Ernest as when he had not heard from him for some time. Reginald's letters were always brief. \"Professional writers,\" he was wont to say, \"cannot afford to put fine feeling into their private correspondence. They must turn it into copy.\" He longed to sit with the master in the studio when the last rays of the daylight were tremulously falling through the stained window, and to discuss far into the darkening night philosophies young and old. He longed for Reginald's voice, his little mannerisms, the very perfume of his rooms.  There also was a deluge of letters likely to await him in his apartment. For in his hurried departure he had purposely left his friends in the dark as to his whereabouts. Only to Jack he had dropped a little note the day after his meeting with Ethel.  He earnestly hoped to find Reginald at home, though it was well nigh ten o'clock in the evening, and he cursed the \"rapid transit\" for its inability to annihilate space and time. It is indeed disconcerting to think how many months, if not years, of our earthly sojourn the dwellers in cities spend in transportation conveyances that must be set down as a dead loss in the ledger of life. A nervous impatience against things material overcame Ernest in the subway. It is ever the mere stupid obstacle of matter that weights down the wings of the soul and prevents it from soaring upward to the sun.  When at last he had reached the house, he learned from the hall-boy that Clarke had gone out. Ruffled in temper he entered his rooms and went over his mail. There were letters from editors with commissions that he could not afford to reject. Everywhere newspapers and magazines opened their yawning mouths to swallow up what time he had. He realised at once that he would have to postpone the writing of his novel for several weeks, if not longer.  Among the letters was one from Jack. It bore the postmark of a little place in the Adirondacks where he was staying with his parents. Ernest opened the missive not without hesitation. On reading and rereading it the fine lines on his forehead, that would some day deepen into wrinkles, became quite pronounced and a look of displeasure darkened his face. Something was wrong with Jack, a slight change that defied analysis. Their souls were out of tune. It might only be a passing disturbance; perhaps it was his own fault. It pained him, nevertheless. Somehow it seemed of late that Jack was no longer able to follow the vagaries of his mind. Only one person in the world possessed a similar mental vision, only one seemed to understand what he said and what he left unsaid. Reginald Clarke, being a man and poet, read in his soul as in an open book. Ethel might have understood, had not love, like a cloud, laid itself between her eyes and the page.  It was with exultation that Ernest heard near midnight the click of Reginald's key in the door. He found him unchanged, completely, radiantly himself. Reginald possessed the psychic power of undressing the soul, of seeing it before him in primal nakedness. Although no word was said of Ethel Brandenbourg except the mere mention of her presence in Atlantic City, Ernest intuitively knew that Reginald was aware of the transformation that absence had wrought in him. In the presence of this man he could be absolutely himself, without shame or fear of mis-understanding; and by a strange metamorphosis, all his affection for Ethel and Jack went out for the time being to Reginald Clarke.     XVII   The next day Ernest wrote a letter of more or less superficial tenderness to Ethel. She had wounded his pride by proving victorious in the end over his passion and hers; besides, he was in the throes of work. When after the third day no answer came, he was inclined to feel aggrieved. It was plain now that she had not cared for him in the least, but had simply played with him for lack of another toy. A flush of shame rose to his cheeks at the thought. He began to analyse his own emotions, and stunned, if not stabbed, his passion step by step. Work was calling to him. It was that which gave life its meaning, not the love of a season. How far away, how unreal, she now seemed to him. Yes, she was right, he had not cared deeply; and his novel, too, would be written only _at_ her. It was the heroine of his story that absorbed his interest, not the living prototype.  Once in a conversation with Reginald he touched upon the subject. Reginald held that modern taste no longer permitted even the photographer to portray life as it is, but insisted upon an individual visualisation. \"No man,\" he remarked, \"was ever translated bodily into fiction. In contradiction to life, art is a process of artificial selection.\"  Bearing in mind this motive, Ernest went to work to mould from the material in hand a new Ethel, more real than life. Unfortunately he found little time to devote to his novel. It was only when, after a good day's work, a pile of copy for a magazine lay on his desk, that he could think of concentrating his mind upon \"Leontina.\" The result was that when he went to bed his imagination was busy with the plan of his book, and the creatures of his own brain laid their fingers on his eyelid so that he could not sleep.  When at last sheer weariness overcame him, his mind was still at work, not in orderly sequence but along trails monstrous and grotesque. Hobgoblins seemed to steal through the hall, and leering incubi oppressed his soul with terrible burdens. In the morning he awoke unrested. The tan vanished from his face and little lines appeared in the corners of his mouth. It was as if his nervous vitality were sapped from him in some unaccountable way. He became excited, hysterical. Often at night when he wrote his pot-boilers for the magazines, fear stood behind his seat, and only the buzzing of the elevator outside brought him back to himself.  In one of his morbid moods he wrote a sonnet which he showed to Reginald after the latter's return from a short trip out of town. Reginald read it, looking at the boy with a curious, lurking expression.    _O gentle Sleep, turn not thy face away,       But place thy finger on my brow, and take       All burthens from me and all dreams that ache;    Upon mine eyes a cooling balsam lay,    Seeing I am aweary of the day.       But, lo! thy lips are ashen and they quake.       What spectral vision sees thou that can shake    Thy sweet composure, and thy heart dismay?    Perhaps some murderer's cruel eye agleam    Is fixed upon me, or some monstrous dream      Might bring such fearful guilt upon the head        Of my unvigilant soul as would arouse      The Borgian snake from her envenomed bed,        Or startle Nero in his golden house._  \"Good stuff,\" Reginald remarked, laying down the manuscript; \"when did you write it?\"  \"The night when you were out of town,\" Ernest rejoined.  \"I see,\" Reginald replied.  There was something startling in his intonation that at once aroused Ernest's attention.  \"What do you see?\" he asked quickly.  \"Nothing,\" Reginald replied, with immovable calm, \"only that your state of nerves is still far from satisfactory.\"     XVIII   After Ernest's departure Ethel Brandenbourg's heart was swaying hither and thither in a hurricane of conflicting feelings. Before she had time to gain an emotional equilibrium, his letter had hurled her back into chaos. A false ring somewhere in Ernest's words, reechoing with an ever-increasing volume of sound, stifled the voice of love. His jewelled sentences glittered, but left her cold. They lacked that spontaneity which renders even simple and hackeneyed phrases wonderful and unique. Ethel clearly realised that her hold upon the boy's imagination had been a fleeting midsummer night's charm, and that a word from Reginald's lips had broken the potency of her spell. She almost saw the shadow of Reginald's visage hovering over Ernest's letter and leering at her from between the lines in sinister triumph. Finally reason came and whispered to her that it was extremely unwise to give her heart into the keeping of a boy. His love, she knew, would have been exacting, irritating at times. He would have asked her to sympathise with every phase of his life, and would have expected active interest on her part in much that she had done with long ago. Thus, untruth would have stolen into her life and embittered it. When mates are unequal, Love must paint its cheeks and, in certain moods at least, hide its face under a mask. Its lips may be honeyed, but it brings fret and sorrow in its train.  These things she told herself over and over again while she penned a cool and calculating answer to Ernest's letter. She rewrote it many times, and every time it became more difficult to reply. At last she put her letter aside for a few days, and when it fell again into her"]]]
