Concerning the vertical stirrups to which Mr. Godfrey refers, there is no doubt that they strengthen beams against failure by diagonal tension or, as more commonly known, shear failures. That they are not effective in the beam as built is plain, for, if one considers a vertical plane between the stirrups, the concrete must resist the shear on this plane, unless dependence is placed on that in the longitudinal reinforcement. This, the author states, is often done, but the practice is unknown to the writer, who does not consider it of any value; certainly the stirrups cannot aid.  Suppose, however, that the diagonal tension is above the ultimate stress for the concrete, failure of the concrete will then occur on planes perpendicular to the line of maximum tension, approximately 45° at the end of the beam. If the stirrups are spaced close enough, however, and are of sufficient strength so that these planes of failure all cut enough steel to take as tension the vertical shear on the plane, then these cracks will be very minute and will be distributed, as is the case in the center of the lower part of the beam. These stirrups will then take as tension the vertical shear on any plane, and hold the beam together, so that the friction on these planes will keep up the strength of the concrete in horizontal shear. The concrete at the end of a simple beam is better able to take horizontal shear than vertical, because the compression on a horizontal plane is greater than that on a vertical plane. This idea concerning the action of stirrups falls under the ban of Mr. Godfrey's statement, that any member which \"cannot act until failure has started, is not a proper element of design,\" but this is not necessarily true. For example, Mr. Godfrey says \"the steel in the tension side of the beam should be considered as taking all the tension.\" This is undoubtedly true, but it cannot take place until the concrete has failed in tension at this point. If used, vertical tension members should be considered as taking all the vertical shear, and, as Mr. Godfrey states, they should certainly have their ends anchored so as to develop the strength for which they have been calculated.  The writer considers diagonal reinforcement to be the best for shear, and it should be used, especially in all cases of \"unit\" reinforcement; but, in some cases, stirrups can and do answer in the manner suggested; and, for reasons of practical construction, are sometimes best with \"loose rod\" reinforcement.   J.C. MEEM, M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--The writer believes that there are some very interesting points in the author's somewhat iconoclastic paper which are worthy of careful study, and, if it be shown that he is right in most of, or even in any of, his assumptions, a further expression of approval is due to him. Few engineers have the time to show fully, by a process of _reductio ad absurdum_, that all the author's points are, or are not, well considered or well founded, but the writer desires to say that he has read this paper carefully, and believes that its fundamental principles are well grounded. Further, he believes that intricate mathematical formulas have no place in practice. This is particularly true where these elaborate mathematical calculations are founded on assumptions which are never found in practice or experiment, and which, even in theory, are extremely doubtful, and certainly are not possible within those limits of safety wherein the engineer is compelled to work.  The writer disagrees with the author in one essential point, however, and that is in the wholesale indictment of special reinforcement, such as stirrups, shear rods, etc. In the ordinary way in which these rods are used, they have no practical value, and their theoretical value is found only when the structure is stressed beyond its safe limits; nevertheless, occasions may arise when they have a definite practical value, if properly designed and placed, and, therefore, they should not be discriminated against absolutely.  Quoting the author, that \"destructive criticism is of no value unless it offers something in its place,\" and in connection with the author's tenth point, the writer offers the following formula which he has always used in conjunction with the design of reinforced concrete slabs and beams. It is based on the formula for rectangular wooden beams, and assumes that the beam is designed on the principle that concrete in tension is as strong as that in compression, with the understanding that sufficient steel shall be placed on the tension side to make this true, thus fixing the neutral axis, as the author suggests, in the middle of the depth, that is, _M_ = (1/6)_b d_^{2} _S_, _M_, of course, being the bending moment, and _b_ and _d_, the breadth and depth, in inches. _S_ is usually taken at from 400 to 600 lb., according to the conditions. In order to obtain the steel necessary to give the proper tensile strength to correspond with the compression side, the compression and tension areas of the beam are equated, that is     1        2                _d_  ---- _b_ _d_ _S_ = _a_ × ( ----- - _x_   ) × _S_  ,   12                          2       II        II  where   _a_      = the area of steel per linear foot,  _x_{II}_ = the distance from the center of the steel to the outer             fiber, and  _S_{II}_ = the strength of the steel in tension.  Then for a beam, 12 in. wide,     2                   _d_  _d_ _S_ = _a_ _S_  ( ----- - _x_ ) ,                  II     2       II  or                   2                _d_ _S_  _a_ = --------------------- .                _d_         _S_ ( ----- - _x_ )           II    2       II  Carrying this to its conclusion, we have, for example, in a beam 12 in. deep and 12 in. wide,   _S_      = 500,  _S_{II}_ = 15,000,  _x_{II}_ = 2-1/2 in.  _a_      = 1.37 sq. in. per ft.  The writer has used this formula very extensively, in calculating new work and also in checking other designs built or to be built, and he believes its results are absolutely safe. There is the further fact to its credit, that its simplicity bars very largely the possibility of error from its use. He sees no reason to introduce further complications into such a formula, when actual tests will show results varying more widely than is shown by a comparison between this simple formula and many more complicated ones.   GEORGE H. MYERS, JUN. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--This paper brings out a number of interesting points, but that which strikes the writer most forcibly is the tenth, in regard to elaborate theories and complicated formulas for beams and slabs. The author's stand for simplicity in this regard is well taken. A formula for the design of beams and slabs need not be long or complicated in any respect. It can easily be obtained from the well-known fact that the moment at any point divided by the distance between the center of compression and the center of tension at that point gives the tension (or compression) in the beam.  The writer would place the neutral axis from 0.42 to 0.45 of the effective depth of the beam from the compression side rather than at the center, as Mr. Godfrey suggests. This higher position of the neutral axis is the one more generally shown by tests of beams. It gives the formula _M_ = 0.86 _d_ _As_ _f_, or _M_ = 0.85 _d_ _As_ _f_, which the writer believes is more accurate than _M_ = 5/6 _d_ _As_ _f_, or 0.83-1/3 _d_ _As_ _f_, which would result if the neutral axis were taken at the center of the beam.      _d_  = depth of the beam from the compression side to the center            of the steel;     _As_ = the area of the steel; and _f_  = the allowable stress per square inch in the steel.  The difference, however, is very slight, the results from the two formulas being proportional to the two factors, 83-1/3 and 85 or 86. This formula gives the area of steel required for the moment. The percentage of steel to be used can easily be obtained from the allowable stresses in the concrete and the steel, and the dimensions of the beam can be obtained in the simplest manner. This formula is used with great success by one of the largest firms manufacturing reinforcing materials and designing concrete structures. It is well-known to the Profession, and the reason for using any other method, involving the Greek alphabet and many assumptions, is unknown to the writer. The only thing to assume--if it can be called assuming when there are so many tests to locate it--is the position of the neutral axis. A slight difference in this assumption affects the resulting design very little, and is inappreciable, from a practical point of view. It can be safely said that the neutral axis is at, or a little above, the center of the beam.  Further, it would seem that the criticism to the effect that the initial stress in the concrete is neglected is devoid of weight. As far as the designer is concerned, the initial stress is allowed for. The values for the stresses used in design are obtained from tests on blocks of concrete which have gone through the process of setting. Whatever initial stress exists in concrete due to this process of setting exists also in these blocks when they are tested. The value of the breaking load on concrete given by any outside measuring device used in these tests, is the value of that stress over and above this initial stress. It is this value with which we work. It would seem that, if the initial stress is neglected in arriving at a safe working load, it would be safe to neglect it in the formula for design.   EDWIN THACHER, M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--The writer will discuss this paper under the several \"points\" mentioned by the author.  _First Point._--At the point where the first rod is bent up, the stress in this rod runs out. The other rods are sufficient to take"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17137"],["title","Some Mooted Questions in Reinforced Concrete Design (#8)"],["body","horizontal stress, and the bent-up portion provides only for the vertical and diagonal shearing stresses in the concrete.  _Second Point._--The remarks on the first point are also applicable to the second one. Rod 3 provides for the shear.  _Third Point._--In a beam, the shear rods run through the compression parts of the concrete and have sufficient anchorage. In a counterfort, the inclined rods are sufficient to take the overturning stress. The horizontal rods support the front wall and provide for shrinkage. The vertical rods also provide for shrinkage, and assist the diagonal rods against overturning. The anchorage is sufficient in all cases, and the proposed method is no more effective.  _Fourth Point._--In bridge pins, bending and bearing usually govern, but, in case a wide bar pulled on a pin between the supports close to the bar, as happens in bolsters and post-caps of combination bridges and in other locations, shear would govern. Shear rods in concrete-steel beams are proportioned to take the vertical and diagonal shearing stresses. If proportioned for less stress per square inch than is used in the bottom bars, this cannot be considered dangerous practice.  _Fifth Point._--Vertical stirrups are designed to act like the vertical rods in a Howe truss. Special literature is not required on the subject; it is known that the method used gives good results, and that is sufficient.  _Sixth Point._--The common method is not \"to assume each shear member as taking the horizontal shear occurring in the space from member to member,\" but to take all the shear from the center of the beam up to the bar in question.  Cracks do not necessarily endanger the safety of a beam. Any device that will prevent the cracks from opening wide enough to destroy the beam, is logical. By numerous experiments, Mr. Thaddeus Hyatt found that nuts and washers at the ends of reinforcing bars were worse than useless, and added nothing to the strength of the beams.  _Seventh Point._--Beams can be designed, supported at the ends, fully continuous, or continuous to a greater or less extent, as desired. The common practice is to design slabs to take a negative moment over the supports equal to one-half the positive moment at the center, or to bend up the alternate rods. This is simple and good practice, for no beam can fail as long as a method is provided by which to take care of all the stresses without overstraining any part.  _Eighth Point._--Bars in the bottom of a reinforced concrete beam are often placed too close to one another. The rule of spacing the bars not less than three diameters apart, is believed to be good practice.  _Ninth Point._--To disregard the theory of T-beams, and work by rule-of-thumb, can hardly be considered good engineering.  _Tenth Point._--The author appears to consider theories for reinforced concrete beams and slabs as useless refinements, but as long as theory and experiment agree so wonderfully well, theories will undoubtedly continue to be used.  _Eleventh Point._--Calculations for chimneys are somewhat complex, but are better and safer than rule-of-thumb methods.  _Twelfth Point._--Deflection is not very important.  _Thirteenth Point._--The conclusion of the Austrian Society of Engineers and Architects, after numerous experiments, was that the elastic theory of the arch is the only true theory. No arch designed by the elastic theory was ever known to fail, unless on account of insecure foundations, therefore engineers can continue to use it with confidence and safety.  _Fourteenth Point._--Calculations for temperature stresses, as per theory, are undoubtedly correct for the variations in temperature assumed. Similar calculations can also be made for shrinkage stresses, if desired. This will give a much better idea of the stresses to be provided for, than no calculations at all.  _Fifteenth Point._--Experiments show that slender longitudinal rods, poorly supported, and embedded in a concrete column, add little or nothing to its strength; but stiff steel angles, securely latticed together, and embedded in the concrete column, will greatly increase its strength, and this construction is considered the most desirable when the size of the column has to be reduced to a minimum.  _Sixteenth Point._--The commonly accepted theory of slabs supported on four sides can be correctly applied to reinforced concrete slabs, as it is only a question of providing for certain moments in the slab. This theory shows that unless the slab is square, or nearly so, nothing is to be gained by such construction.   C.A.P. TURNER, M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--Mr. Godfrey has expressed his opinion on many questions in regard to concrete construction, but he has adduced no clean-cut statement of fact or tests, in support of his views, which will give them any weight whatever with the practical matter-of-fact builder.  The usual rules of criticism place the burden of proof on the critic. Mr. Godfrey states that if his personal opinions are in error, it should be easy to prove them to be so, and seems to expect that the busy practical constructor will take sufficient interest in them to spend the time to write a treatise on the subject in order to place him right in the matter.  The writer will confine his discussion to only a few points of the many on which he disagrees with Mr. Godfrey.  First, regarding stirrups: These may be placed in the beam so as to be of little practical value. They were so placed in the majority of the tests made at the University of Illinois. Such stirrups differ widely in value from those used by Hennebique and other first-class constructors.  Mr. Godfrey's idea is that the entire pull of the main reinforcing rod should be taken up apparently at the end. When one frequently sees slabs tested, in which the steel breaks at the center, with no end anchorage whatever for the rods, the soundness of Mr. Godfrey's position may be questioned.  Again, concrete is a material which shows to the best advantage as a monolith, and, as such, the simple beam seems to be decidedly out of date to the experienced constructor.  Mr. Godfrey appears to consider that the hooping and vertical reinforcement of columns is of little value. He, however, presents for consideration nothing but his opinion of the matter, which appears to be based on an almost total lack of familiarity with such construction.  The writer will state a few facts regarding work which he has executed. Among such work have been columns in a number of buildings, with an 18-in. core, and carrying more than 500 tons; also columns in one building, which carry something like 1100 tons on a 27-in. core. In each case there is about 1-1/2 in. of concrete outside the core for a protective coating. The working stress on the core, if it takes the load, is approximately equal to the ultimate strength of the concrete in cubes, to say nothing of the strength of cylinders fifteen times their diameter in height. These values have been used with entire confidence after testing full-sized columns designed with the proper proportions of vertical steel and hooping, and are regarded by the writer as having at least double the factor of safety used in ordinary designs of structural steel.  An advantage which the designer in concrete has over his fellow-engineer in the structural steel line, lies in the fact that, with a given type of reinforcement, his members are similar in form, and when the work is executed with ordinary care, there is less doubt as to the distribution of stress through a concrete column, than there is with the ordinary structural steel column, since the core is solid and the conditions are similar in all cases.  Tests of five columns are submitted herewith. The columns varied little in size, but somewhat in the amount of hooping, with slight differences in the vertical steel. The difference between Columns 1 and 3 is nearly 50%, due principally to the increase in hooping, and to a small addition in the amount of vertical steel. As to the efficiency of hooping and vertical reinforcement, the question may be asked Mr. Godfrey, and those who share his views, whether a column without reinforcement can be cast, which will equal the strength of those, the tests of which are submitted.   TEST NO. 1.[I]  Marks on column--none.  Reinforcement--eight 1-1/8-in. round bars vertically.  Band spacing--- 9 in. vertically.  Hooped with seven 32-in. wire spirals about 2-in. raise.  Outside diameter of hoops--14-1/2 in.  Total load at failure--1,360,000 lb.  Remarks.--Point of failure was about 22 in. from the top. Little indication of failure until ultimate load was reached.  Some slight breaking off of concrete near the top cap, due possibly to the cap not being well seated in the column itself.   TEST NO. 2.  Marks on column--Box 4.  Reinforcement--eight 1-1/8-in. round bars vertically.  Band spacing about 13 in. vertically.  Wire spiral about 3-in. pitch.  Point of failure about 18 in. from top.  Top of cast-iron cap cracked at four corners.  Ultimate load--1,260,000 lb.  Remarks.--Both caps apparently well seated, as was the case with all the subsequent tests.   TEST NO. 3.  Marks on column--4-B.  Reinforcement--eight 7/8-in. round bars vertically.  Hoops--1-3/4 in. × 3/16 in. × 14 in. outside diameter.  Band spacing--13 in. vertically.  Ultimate load--900,000 lb.  Point of failure about 2 ft. from top.  Remarks.--Concrete, at failure, considerably disintegrated, probably due to continuance of movement of machine after failure.   TEST NO. 4.  Marks on column--Box 4.  Reinforcement--eight 1-in. round bars vertically.  Hoops spaced 8 in. vertically.  Wire spirals as on other columns.  Total load at failure--1,260,000 lb.  Remarks.--First indications of failure were nearest the bottom end of the column, but the total failure was, as in all other columns, within 2 ft. of the top. Large cracks in the shell of the column extended from both ends to very near the middle. This"]]]
