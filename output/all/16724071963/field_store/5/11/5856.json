(Full page image)  RETAINING AND FACE WALLS NORTH SIDE]  These box drains occurred so frequently, and decreased the section of the wall so materially, that it was thought desirable to tie the wall to the rock. This was done by drilling into the rock holes from 6 to 15 ft. in depth, and grouting into each hole a 1-1/2-in. rod having a split end and a steel wedge. The outer end of each rod was fitted with a 12 by 12 by 1/2-in. plate and a nut, and extended into the wall, thus tying the concrete securely to the rock. The drains being 6 ft. from center to center, the tie-rods were placed midway between them, and 6 ft., from center to center, vertically and horizontally. Fig. 8 shows the arrangement of these rods and drains. Around the Express Building site, just west of Ninth Avenue, on the south side of the work, the bridge seat was omitted, and the face wall was designed 2 ft. thick from top to bottom. The batter on the 31st Street wall was made variable, the top and bottom being constant distances from the center line and on different grades.  The retaining walls were water-proofed with three layers of felt and coal-tar pitch, which was protected by 4 in. of brick masonry. A 6-in. vitrified drain pipe was laid along the back of the wall, with the joints open on the lower half, and this was covered with 1 ft. of broken stone and sand before any back-fill was placed on it.  The arrangement of the drains was as follows: The 6-in. drain back of the retaining wall was connected with one of the box drains in the rear of the face wall by a cast-iron pipe or wooden box every 24 ft., and this ran through the base of the retaining wall. Midway between these pipes, a connection was made at the bridge seat between the drain in the rear of the face wall and the gutter formed at the rear of the bridge seat to carry off rain-water coming down the face of the wall above. All the box drains, except those connected with the drains back of the retaining wall, were sealed at the elevation of the base of the retaining wall, as noted previously.  The specifications required vitrified pipe to be laid through the retaining wall, but, owing to the difficulty of holding the short lengths of pipe in place during the laying of wet concrete, they were dispensed with, and either iron pipes or wooden boxes were used.  _Tie-Rods._--When the excavation on the sides had been completed, movable drilling platforms were erected, as shown by Fig. 4, Plate L. The holes were drilled on a pitch of 2 in. per ft. with the horizontal. The depths of the holes were decided by the engineer, and were on the basis of a minimum depth of 5 ft. in perfect rock; the character of the rock, therefore, and the presence of seams, determined the depths of the holes. Each hole was partly filled with grout, and the rod, with the steel wedge in the split end, was inserted and driven with a sledge so that the wedge, striking the bottom of the hole first, would cause the split end of the rod to open. Each hole was then entirely filled with neat cement grout.  _Box Drains._--Various methods of forming the box drains were considered, such as using half-tile drains, or a metal form, or a collapsible form which could be withdrawn, but it was finally decided to build boxes in which the side toward the rock was open and the joints in the boxes and against the rock were plastered with cement mortar. These boxes were left in place. Fig. 1, Plate LI, shows the tie-rods and box drains in place, and holes being cut near the bottom of the drains for the pipes leading through the wall.  _Forms._--Fig. 1, Plate LI, shows the form used on the south side of the work. The materials were of good quality, and the form, which was about 50 ft. long, was used to build twelve sections, or about 600 ft. of wall. The form was tied in at the top and bottom by cables attached to rods drilled into the rock, and it was thought that, with the trusses to stiffen the middle section of the form, it would not be necessary to use raker braces against it. This would have been desirable, as the placing of the raker braces took considerable time. It was found, however, that the form was not sufficiently rigid, as it bulged at the middle section and could not be held by the trusses. Two or three sets of raker braces, about 12 ft. apart, were used, and in addition, rods with turnbuckles were placed through the form and fastened to the tie-rods, and thus the form was held in place successfully. On the forms built later, the trusses were omitted, and raker braces, about every 6 ft., were used. The rods which screwed into the turnbuckles were removed before the form was moved. The photograph, Fig. 4, Plate LII, was taken inside the concrete form for the lower face wall on the north side, and shows the drains leading through the wall, the turnbuckles attached to the tie-rods, the cables attached to rods in the rock, and the braces to keep the form from coming in; these braces, of course, were removed as the concrete came up. The form was built low and wedged up into position. After a section of concrete had set sufficiently, the wedges were knocked out, the form was lowered and moved from the wall, and was then moved along the lowest waling piece by block and tackle to its new position.  Fig. 4, Plate L, shows the forms used on the north side of the work.  A section, 1 ft. square, at the top of the bridge seat of the lower face wall, was left out, so that the bottom of the form for the upper face wall could be braced against it. The top of this form was tied by cables attached to rods in the rock and by rods with turnbuckles running from back to front of the form; braces were also put in from the back of the retaining wall form to the walls of buildings along the property lines, when this could be done. The middle section of the form was held by rods with turnbuckles which passed through the form and were fastened to each of the tie-rods drilled into the rock, as was also done in the case of the lower face wall. It was generally possible to hold the form to true position in this manner, but occasionally it had a tendency to bulge; when this occurred, the rods leading through the form and fastened to the tie-rods were tightened up, the placing of the concrete was slowed up, and no serious bulging occurred.  Bulkheads at the ends of the sections were built of rough planking securely braced to the rock, except that a planed board was laid up against the face of the form to make a straight joint. At the end of each section a V was formed, as shown by Fig. 1, Plate LI. At all corners, a \"return,\" or portion of the wall running at right angles, was built, and no section of wall was stopped at a corner.  _Filling Forms of Lower Face Walls._--A temporary trestle was erected above the elevation of the bridge seat, and a track, leading from the mixer to the form to be filled, was laid on it. At the commencement of each section a layer of mortar (1 part of cement to 2-1/2 parts of sand) was deposited on the bottom. A 1:3:6 mixture of concrete was used; it was run from the mixer into dump-cars and deposited in the form through chutes, three of which were provided for each 50-ft. section, the average length. The concrete was mixed wet, and was not rammed; the stone was spaded back from the face, and no facing mixture or facing diaphragms were used. Work on each section was continued day and night without any intermission from the time of commencement to the time of completion. At frequent intervals the box drains were washed out thoroughly with a hose, in order to prevent them from clogging up with grout.  [Illustration: PLATE LI, FIG. 1.--TW 66, P.N.Y. & L.I.R.R.

View across North River on line of Tunnels, looking from New York to New Jersey. Feb. 9, 07.]  In the first few sections of wall, the form was filled to within 1 in. of the top of the bridge seat and allowed to set for about 2 hours; it was then finished to the proper elevation with a plaster of 1 part of cement to 1 part of sand. This did not prove satisfactory, as there were indications of checking and cracking, and, later, the form was filled to the required elevation and the surface floated. The form was allowed to remain in place for from 18 to 24 hours, depending on the weather. In most cases, immediately after the form had been moved, a scaffold was erected against the face of the wall, and the face was wet and thoroughly rubbed, first with a wooden float and then with a cement brick, until the surface was smooth and uniform.  The section 1 ft. square at the top of the bridge seat, which was left out in order to brace the bottom of the form for the upper face wall, was filled in after the walls had been completed. The old concrete was very thoroughly cleaned before the new concrete was placed on it, and a gutter was formed at the rear connecting with the box drains back of the wall to carry off rain-water coming down the face of the upper walls.  In hot weather the walls were thoroughly wetted down several times a day for several days after the form had been removed.  _Upper Face and Retaining Wall._--In cases where the top of the retaining wall was at a higher elevation than the mixer, it was necessary to raise the concrete in a bucket with a derrick, and dump it into cars on the trestle above the top of the coping. Concrete was deposited through chutes, as in the lower face wall, continuously from the bottom of the face wall to the top of the retaining wall. At the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17302"],["title","Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, vol. LXVIII, Sept. 1910 (#6)"],["body","of each section of the retaining wall a layer of mortar was put on the rock. A 1:2:3 mixture of concrete was used in the face wall, and a 1:3:6 mixture in the retaining wall.  As the face walls were so thin, the number of batches of concrete per hour was reduced, for the form filled so rapidly that the concrete, before it set, exerted an excessive pressure against the form, and this tended to make it bulge. The proper rate at which to place the concrete behind a form 50 ft. long, with a wall 2 ft. thick, was found to be about fifteen 1/2-yd. batches per hour.  _Cracks in Walls and Longitudinal Reinforcement._--Before the concrete walls were started, the contractor suggested using forms 100 ft. long and building the walls in sections of that length; it was decided, however, to limit the length to 50 ft.  The south walls, in sections approximately 50 ft. long, were built first, starting at Tenth Avenue and extending for about 500 ft. Soon after the forms were removed, irregular cracks appeared in the walls between the joints in practically every section. It was thought that these cracks might be due to the wall being very thin and being held at the back by the tie-rods; there was also quite a material change in the section of the wall at each drainage box. Although it was admitted that these cracks would have no effect on the stability of the wall, it was thought that, for appearance sake, it would be desirable to prevent or control them, if possible. The first method suggested was to shorten the sections to 25 ft., which would give an expansion and contraction joint every 25 ft., it being thought that sections of this length would not crack between the joints. This, however, was not considered desirable. An effort was then made to prevent cracks in a section of wall, about 46 ft. long, on the south side, by using longitudinal reinforcement. In the lower and upper face walls, 3/4-in. square twisted steel rods were placed longitudinally about 4 in. in from the face and about 1 ft. 4 in. apart vertically. The sections of these walls were finished on April 10th, and May 5th, 1909, respectively. At present there are no indications of cracks in these sections, and they are practically the only ones in the south walls which do not show irregular cracks.  It was decided, however, that, inasmuch as the cracks did not affect the stability of the walls, the increased cost of thus reinforcing the remaining walls was not warranted. An effort to control the cracks was made by placing corrugated-iron diaphragms in the form, dividing each 50-ft. section into three parts. The diaphragms were 1 ft. wide, and were placed with the outer edge 1 in. in from the face of the wall, but in the copings they were omitted. The purpose of these diaphragms was to provide weak sections in the walls, so that if there was any tendency to crack it would occur along the line of the diaphragms. Corrugated iron was used for the diaphragms instead of sheet iron as it was more easily maintained in a vertical position. The general arrangement of the diaphragms is shown on Fig. 4, Plate LII. The results obtained by using diaphragms have been quite satisfactory, and cracks approximately straight and vertical have usually appeared opposite the diaphragms soon after the forms were removed. Diaphragms were used on all the remaining walls, with the exception of those between Stations 187 + 07 and 188 + 83 on the north side, where the rock was of poor character and bad slides had occurred. Between these points, in order to strengthen the wall, twisted steel rods, 1 in. square, were placed longitudinally, 6 in. in from the face of the wall and 2 ft. apart vertically, between Elevations 295 and 335.

The stone selected came from the Millstone Granite Company's Quarries, Millstone Point, Conn., and is a close-grained granite. Fig. 2, Plate LI, shows the completed portal.  Practically all the stone cutting was done at the quarry, but certain stones in each course were sent long and were cut on the ground, in order to make proper closures. Drains were left behind the portal around the back of each arch, leading down to the bottom, and through the concrete base at each side of the portal and in the central core-wall; all these drains have been discharging water.  _Power-House._--The old church at No. 236 West 34th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, was turned over to the New York Contracting Company-Pennsylvania Terminal for a power-house to supply compressed air for use on the Terminal Station work between Seventh and Ninth Avenues and the work below sub-grade as well as that on the Terminal Station-West. Four straight-line compressors and one cross-compound Corliss compressor were installed, the steam being supplied by three Stirling boilers. Three electrically-driven air compressors, using current at 6,600 volts, were also installed, and the total capacity of the power-house was about 19,000 cu. ft. of free air per minute compressed to 90 lb. per sq. in.  _Disposal Pier._--The disposal pier (old No. 62 and new No. 72), at the foot of West 32d Street, North River, was leased by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. The entire pier, with the exception of the piles, was taken down, and the piles which would be in the path of the proposed tunnel were withdrawn prior to the building of the tunnels and the construction of the pier for disposal purposes. Subsequent to the driving of the tunnels there was a considerable settlement in the pier, especially noticeable at the telphers, and finally these had to be abandoned on this account. Fig. 3, Plate LI, shows the chutes through which the earth was dumped on the decks of the scows to form a padding on which to dump the heavier rock. Fig. 4, Plate LI, shows the derricks at the end of the pier. These were used, not only for loading heavy stones and skips, but also with a clam-shell bucket for bringing in broken stone and sand for use in the work. Large quantities of pipe, conduits, brick, etc., were also brought to this pier for use on the work.  [Illustration: FIG. 9. (Full page image)  PORTAL, RETAINING AND FACE WALLS, TENTH AVENUE]   ORGANIZATION OF ENGINEERING FORCE IN FIELD.  The design and execution of the work were under the direction of Charles M. Jacobs, M. Am. Soc. C.E., Chief Engineer, and James Forgie, M. Am. Soc. C.E., Chief Assistant Engineer. The writer acted as Resident Engineer.  [Illustration: Fig. 10.]  The general organization of the engineering force in the field is shown by the diagram, Fig. 10.  The position of Assistant Engineer, in responsible charge of Construction and Records, has been filled in turn by Messrs. A.W. Gill, N.C. McNeil, Jun. Am. Soc. C.E., and W.S. Greene, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C.E.  Messrs. A.P. Combes and T.B. Brogan have acted as Chief Inspector and Night Inspector, respectively, in charge of outside work during the entire carrying out of the contract.  Base lines had been established on Ninth and Tenth Avenues for the Terminal work east of Ninth Avenue and for the Tunnel work west of Tenth Avenue, and these lines, together with bench-marks similarly established, were used in laying out the Terminal Station-West work.  Prior to the commencement of the work, elevations were taken on the surface at 10-ft. intervals, and elevations of the rock surface were taken on these points as the rock was uncovered. Cross-sections were made and used in computing the progress and final estimates.  Very careful records were kept of labor, materials, derrick performances, steam-shovel performances, quantity of dynamite used, etc., and, in addition, a diary was kept giving a description of the work and materials used each day; various tables and diagrams were also prepared.  A daily report was sent to the Chief Office showing the quantities of excavation removed and concrete built, the force in the field, the plant at work, etc., during the previous day. At the end of each month a description of the work done during that month, with quantities, force of men employed, percentages of work done, etc., was sent to the Chief Office. Two diagrams, showing cross-sections and contours of the excavation done and the progress of the concrete walls, were also sent.   COST ACCOUNT.  From the records of labor and material obtained in the field, and from estimated charges for administration and power, an estimate was made of the cost to the contractor for doing various classes of work. It was necessary to estimate the administration and power charges, as the contractor's organization and power-house were also controlling and supplying power to the Terminal Station work east of Ninth Avenue and also the work below sub-grade. The labor and material charges in the field were placed directly against the class of work on which they were used and the administration and general charges (which included superintendence, lighting, etc.) were apportioned to the various classes of work in proportion to the value of the labor done.   STATISTICS.  The total weight of the structural steel used during the underpinning of Ninth Avenue was 1,475,000 lb.  The total weight supported during the work under Ninth"]]]
