The flying of a kite on a windy Toronto Hallowe'en day and the suspension of worry for a shiny moment.  And sail surface isn't even a problemette when it comes to my parents' home -- the thing is a three-storey bat whose narrow wings contain the trolleycar-shaped bedrooms and storages. Mum and Dad built it themselves while I tottered in the driveway, sucking a filthy shred of blanket, and as I contemplate it today with hands on hips from the front yard, I am there on that day:  Dad is nailgunning strips of plywood into a frame, Mum stands where I am now, hands on her hips (and I take my hands from my hips hastily, shove them deep in pockets). She squints and shouts directions. Then they both grab rolls of scrim and stapleguns and stretch it loosely across the frames, and fast-bond pipes and prefab fixtures into place. Mum harnesses up the big tanks of foam and aims the blower at the scrim, giving it five fat coats, then she drops the blower and she and Dad grab spatulas and tease zillions of curlicues and baroque stuccoes from the surface, painting it with catsup, chutney, good whiskey and bad wine, a massive canvas covered by centimetres until they declare it ready and Mum switches tanks, loads up with fix-bath and mists it with the salty spray. Ten minutes later, and the house is hard and they get to work unloading the U-Haul in the drive.  And now I'm twenty-two again, and I will untether that house and fly it in the stiff breeze that ruffles my hair affectionately.  #  Firstly and most foremost, I need to wait for the man. I hate to wait. But today it's waiting and harsh and dull, dull, dull.  So I wait for the man, Stude the Dude and the gentle clip-clop of Tilly's hooves on the traction-nubbed foam of my Chestnut Ave.  My nose is pressed against the window in the bat's crotch, fingers dug into the hump of fatty foam that runs around its perimeter, fog patches covering the rime of ground-in filth that I've allowed to accumulate on my parents' spotless windows.  Where the frick is Stude?  #  The man has cometh. Clop-clip, clip-clop, Stude the Dude, as long as a dangling booger, and his clapped-out nag Tilly, and the big foam cart with its stacks of crates and barrels and boxes, ready to do the deal.  \"Maxes!\" he says, and I *know* I'm getting taken today -- he looks genuinely glad to see me.  \"Stude, nice day, how's it?\" I say, as cas and cool as I can, which isn't, very.  \"Fine day! Straight up fine day to be alive and awaiting judgment!\" He power-chugs from the perpetual coffee thermos at his side.  \"Fine day,\" I echo.  \"Fine, fine day.\" Like he's not in any hurry to get down to the deal, and I know it's a contest, and the first one to wheel gets taken.  I snort and go \"Yuh-huh.\" It's almost cheating, since I should've had something else nice to say, but Stude gives me a conversational Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free.  \"Good night to tricky treat.\"  I concede defeat. \"I need some stuff, Stude.\"  Give it to him, he doesn't gloat. Just hauls again from Mr Coffee and pooches his lips and nods.  \"Need, uh, spool of monofilament, three klicks, safety insulated. Four litres of fix bath. Litre, litre and a half of solvent.\"  \"Yeah, okay. Got a permit for the solvent?\"  \"If I had a permit, Stude, I'd go and buy it at the fricken store. Don't pull my dick.\"  \"Just askin'. Whyfor the solvent? Anything illegal?\"  \"Just a project, Stude. Nothing to worry.\"  \"What kinda project?\"  \"Art project. Fun-fricken-tastic. You'll love it.\"  \"'Cause you know, they tag the shit with buckyballs now, one molecule in a million with a serial number and a checksum. You do something stupid, I get chopped.\"  I hadn't known. Didn't matter, my parents' house was legally mine, while they were up confabbing with their alien buds on the mothaship. \"No worries.\"  \"That'll be, uh, sixty-eight cents.\"  \"Thirty.\"  \"Sixty, firm.\"  \"Fifty-four.\"  \"Fifty-eight.\"  \"Take it in trade?\"  \"Fricken Maxes! Tradesies? You're wastin' my time, lookin' for bootleg solvent, looking for trade and no cash? Get fucked, Maxes.\"  He starts to haw-up Tilly and I go, \"Wait-wait-wait, I got some good stuff. Everything must go, moving sale, you know?\"  He looks really pissed and I know it hard now, I'm gonna get *taken*. I hand him up my bag, and he does a fast-paw through the junk. \"What's this?\" he asks.  \"Old video game. Atari. Shoot up the space aliens. Really, really antisocial. Needs a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17029"],["title","Shadow of the Mothaship (#2)"],["body","splay, but I don't got it anymore.\" I'd sold it the month before on a bored day, and used the eight cents to buy good seats behind home plate at the Skydome and thus killed an entire afternoon before Judgment Day.  There are some of the artyfarty \"freestyle\" kitchen utensils Mum used to sell for real cash until Dad founded his Process for Lasting Happiness and she found herself able to pursue \"real art.\" There are paper books and pictures and assorted other crap.  Stude clucks and shakes his head. \"If I just gave you the monofil and the fix-bath for this shit, it'd be a favour. Look, I can *get* real money for solvent. I *pay* real money for solvent. This just don't cut it.\"  \"I'll get more, just hang a sec.\"  He haws-up Tilly but reigns her in slow, and I dash back to my place and fill a duffel with anything I lay hands to, and run out, dragging it behind me, catching the cart before it turns the corner. \"Here, here, take this too.\"  Stude dumps it out in front of him and kicks at the pile. \"This is just crap, Maxes. There's lots of it, sure, but it's still crap.\"  \"I need it, Stude, I really need some solvent. You already *got* all my good stuff.\"  He shakes his head, sad, and says, \"Go ask Tilly.\"  \"Ask?\"  \"Tilly. Ask her.\"  Stude likes to humiliate you a little before he does you a favour. The word is *capricious*, he told me once.  So I go to his smelly old horse and whisper in her hairy ear and hold my breath as I put my ear next to the rotten jumbo-chiclets she uses for teeth. \"She says you should do it,\" I say. \"And she says you're an asshole for making me ask her. She says horses can't talk.\"  \"Yeah, okay,\" and he tosses me the goods.  #  With stage one blessedly behind me, I'm ready for stage two. I take the nozzle of the solvent aerosol and run a drizzle along the fatty roll of the windowsills and then pop them out as the fix bath runs away and the windows fly free and shatter on the street below.  Then it's time to lighten the ballast. With kicks and grunts and a mantra of \"Out, out, out,\" I toss everything in the house out, savouring each crash, taking care to leave a clear path between the house and the street.  On the third floor, I find Dad's cardigan, the one Mum gave him one anniversary, and put it on. She carved it herself from foam and fixed it with some flexible, dirt-shedding bath, so by the time I'm done with the third floor, my arms and chest are black with dust, and the sweater is still glowing with eerie cleanliness.  I know Dad wouldn't want me to wear his sweater now. They say that on the mothaship, the bugouts have ways to watch each and every one of us, and maybe Mum and Dad are there, watching me, and so I wipe my nose on the sleeve.  #  When the ballast is done, phase three begins. I go to work outside of the house, spritzing a line of solvent at the point where the foam meets the ground, until it's all disconnected.  And then I got to kick myself for an asshole. A strand of armoured fibre-optic, a steel water pipe, and the ceramic gas line hold it all down, totally impervious to solvent.  Somewhere, in a toolbox that I ditched out the second floor window, is a big old steel meat-cleaver, and now I hunt for it, prying apart the piles of crap with a broomstick, feeling every inch the post-apocalyptic scrounger.  I finally locate it, hanging out of arm's reach from my neighbour Linus's rose trellis. I shake the trellis until it falls, missing my foot, which I jerk away and swear at.  #  The fibre cleaves with a single stroke. The gas line takes twenty or more, each stroke clanging off the ceramic and sending the blade back alarmingly at my face. Finally it gives, and the sides splinter and a great jet of gas whooshes out, then stops.  I could kick myself for an asshole. Praise the bugouts for civil engineers who made self-sealing pipes. I eye the water line warily and flip open my comm, dial into the city, and touch-tone my way through a near-sexy woman reading menus until I find out that the water, too, self-seals.  Whang, whang, whang, and I'm soaked and blinded by the water that bursts free, and *I could kick myself for an asshole!*  The house, now truly untethered, catches a gust of wind and lifts itself a few metres off the ground, body-checking me on my ass. I do a basketball jump and catch the solvent-melted corner, drag it down to earth, long-arm for the fix bath and slop it where the corner meets the driveway, bonding it there until phase four is ready.  #  I bond one end of monofilament to the front right corner of the house, then let it unwind, covered in eraser-pink safety goop, until I'm standing in my deserted Chestnut Ave. I spray a dent in the middle of the road with my solvent, plunk the reel into it, bond it, then rush back to the house and unbond that last one corner.  I hit the suck button on the reel and the house slowly drags its way to the street, leaving a gap like a broken tooth in the carefully groomed smile of my Chestnut Ave.  The wind fluffs at the house, making it settle/unsettle like a nervous hen and so I give it line by teasing the spit button on the reel until it's a hundred metres away. Then I reel it in and out, timing it with the gusts until, in a sudden magnificent second, it catches and sails up-and-up-and-up and I'm a fricken genius.  #  It's nearly four and my beautiful kite is a dancing bird in the sky before the good little kiddies of my Chestnut Ave start to trickle home from their days of denial, playing at normalcy in the face of Judgment.  Linus is the first one home, and he nearly decapitates himself on the taut line as he cruises past on his bicycle. He slews to a stop and stares unbelieving at me, at the airborne house, at the gap where he had a neighbour.  \"Maxes Fuentes Shumacher! What is this?\"  \"Flying a kite, Linus. Just flyin' a kite. Nice day for it, yeah?\"  \"This,\" he says, then sputters. Linus is a big devotee of Dad's Process for Lasting Happiness, and I can actually watch him try to come up with some scripture to cover the situation while he gulps back mouthsful of bile. \"This is an Irresponsible Wrong, Maxes. You are being a Feckless Filthy. This is an abuse of property, a Lashing Out at a Figure in Absentia. You are endangering others, endangering aircraft and people and property below that. I insist that you Right-Make this now, this instant.\"  \"Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.\" And I squint up at my kite, the sun coming down behind it now, and it's just a dot in the big orange fire. The wind's more biting than friendly. I pull the foam sweater a little closer, and do up one of the buttons in the middle.  \"Maxes!\" Linus shouts, his happiness dissipating. \"You have thirty seconds to get that down here, or I will Right-Make it myself.\"  I didn't live with my dad for twenty years without picking up some Process-speak. \"You seem to be Ego-Squeezing here, Lin. This Blame-Saying is a Barrier to Joy, bud, and the mark of a Weekend Happyman. Why don't you go watch some TV or something?\"  He ignores me and makes a big show of flipping open his comm and starting a timer running on it.  Man, my kite is a work of art. Megafun.  \"Time's up, Feckless Filthy,\" Linus says, and snakes out and punches the suck button on my monofilament reel. It whizzes and line starts disappearing into its guts.  \"You can't bring down a kite *that* way, frickface. It'll crash.\" Which it does, losing all its airworthiness in one hot second and plummeting like a house.  It tears up some trees down Chestnut, and I hear a Rice Crispies bowl of snap-crackle-pops from further away. I use a shear to clip the line and it zaps away, like a hyperactive snake.  \"Moron,\" I say to Linus. The good kiddies of Chestnut Ave are now trickling home in twos and threes and looking at the gap in the smile with looks of such bovine stupidity that I stalk away in disgust, leaving the reel bonded to the middle of the road forever.  I build a little fort out of a couch and some cushions, slop fix bath over the joints so they're permanent, and hide in it, shivering.  #  Tricky-treaters didn't come knocking on my pillow-fort last night. That's fine by me. I slept well.  I rise with the sun and the dew and the aches of a cold night on a mattress of clothes and towels.  I flip open my comm, and there's a half-doz clippings my agent's found in the night. Five are about the bugouts; I ignore those. One is about the kite.  It crashed around Highway 7 and the 400 in Vaughan, bouncing and skidding. Traffic was light, and though there were a few fender-benders, nothing serious went down. The city dispatched a couple-three guys to go out with solvent and melt the thing, but by the time they arrived, an errant breeze had lofted it again, and it flew another seventy kay, until it crossed the antidebris field at Jean Paul Aristide International in Barrie.  I'm hungry. I'm cold. My teeth are beshitted with scum. Linus comes tripping Noel Coward out of his front door and I feel like kicking his ass. He sees me staring at him.  \"Did you have a good night, Maxes?\"  \"Spiff, strictly nift. Eat shit and die.\"  He tsks and shakes his head and gets on his bicycle. He works down at Yonge and Bloor, in the big Process HQ. His dad was my dad's lieutenant, and since they both went to the confab on the mothaship (along with all the other grownups on my Chestnut Ave), he's sort of in charge. Shit-eating prick. He lisps a little when he talks, and he's soft and pudgy, not like Dad, who could orate like a Roman tyrant and had a washboard for a gut.  I hope he gets hit by a semi.  #  I pass the morning with my comm, till I come to the pict of Mum and Dad and their Process buds on the jetway to the shuttle at Aristide, ascending to the heavens as humanity's reps. They're both naked and arm-in-arm and as chaste as John and Yoko, and my eyes fill up with tears. I crawl back into my fort and sleep and dream about buzzing Chestnut Ave in a shuttle with a payload of solvent, melting down all the houses into trickles that"]]]
