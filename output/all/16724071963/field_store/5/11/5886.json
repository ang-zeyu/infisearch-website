When the names of Teti or Snofrûi, following the group [----] which respectively express sovereignty over the two halves of Egypt, the South and the North, the whole expression describing exactly the visible person of Pharaoh during his abode among mortals. But this first name chosen for the child did not include the whole man; it left without appropriate designation the double of Horus, which was revealed in the prince at the moment of accession. The double therefore received a special title, which is always constructed on a uniform plan: first the picture [--] hawk-god, who desired to leave to his descendants a portion of his soul, then a simple or compound epithet, specifying that virtue of Horus which the Pharaoh wished particularly to possess--“Horû nîb-mâîfc,” Horus master of Truth; “Horû miri-toûi,” Horus friend of both lands; “Horû nîbkhâùû,” Horus master of the risings; “Horu mazîti,”  Horus who crushes his enemies.  [Illustration: 024.jpg THE ADULT KING ADVANCING, FOLLOWED BY HIS DOUBLE]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an illustration in Arundale-      Bonomi-Birch’s _Gallery of Antiquities from the British      Museum,_ pl. 31. The king thus represented is Thutmosis II.      of the XVIIIth dynasty; the spear, surmounted by a man’s      head, which the double holds in his hand, probably recalls      the human victims formerly sacrificed at the burial of a      chief.  The variable part of these terms is usually written in an oblong rectangle, terminated at the lower end by a number of lines portraying in a summary way the façade of a monument, in the centre of which a bolted door may sometimes be distinguished: this is the representation of the chapel where the double will one day rest, and the closed door is the portal of the tomb.* The stereotyped part of the names and titles, which is represented by the figure of the god, is placed outside the rectangle, sometimes by the side of it, sometimes upon its top: the hawk is, in fact, free by nature, and could nowhere remain imprisoned against his will.       * This is what is usually known as the “Banner Name;”       indeed, it was for some time believed that this sign      represented a piece of stuff, ornamented at the bottom by      embroidery or fringe, and bearing on the upper part the      title of a king. Wilkinson thought that this “square title,”       as he called it, represented a house. The real meaning of      the expression was determined by Professor Flinders Petrie      and by myself.  This artless preamble was not enough to satisfy the love of precision which is the essential characteristic of the Egyptians. When they wished to represent the double in his sepulchral chamber, they left out of consideration the period in his existence during which he had presided over the earthly destinies of the sovereign, in order to render them similar to those of Horus, from whom the double proceeded.  [Illustration: 026.jpg Page Image]  They, therefore, withdrew him from the tomb which should have been his lot, and there was substituted for the ordinary sparrow-hawk one of those groups which symbolize sovereignty over the two countries of the Nile--the coiled urasus of the North, and the vulture of the South, [--]; there was then finally added a second sparrow-hawk, the golden sparrow-hawk, [--], the triumphant sparrow-hawk which had delivered Egypt from Typhon. The soul of Snofrai, which is called, as a surviving double, [--], “Horus master of Truth,” is, as a living double, entitled “[--]” “[--]” the Lord of the Vulture and of the “Urous,” master of Truth, and Horus triumphant.*       * The Ka, or double name, represented in this illustration      is that of the Pharaoh Khephren, the builder of the second      of the great pyramids at Gîzeh; it reads “Horu usir-Hâîti,”       Horus powerful of heart.  On the other hand, the royal prince, when he put on the diadem, received, from the moment of his advancement to the highest rank, such an increase of dignity, that his birth-name--even when framed in a cartouche and enhanced with brilliant epithets--was no longer able to fully represent him. This exaltation of his person was therefore marked by a new designation. As he was the living flesh of the sun, so his surname always makes allusion to some point in his relations with his father, and proclaims the love which he felt for the latter, “Mirirî,”  or that the latter experienced for him, “Mirnirî,” or else it indicates the stability of the doubles of Râ, “Tatkerî,” their goodness, “Nofirkerî,” or some other of their sovereign virtues. Several Pharaohs of the IVth dynasty had already dignified themselves by these surnames; those of the VIth were the first to incorporate them regularly into the royal preamble.  [Illustration: 027.jpg PAGE IMAGE]  There was some hesitation at first as to the position the surname ought to occupy, and it was sometimes placed after the birth-name, as in “Papi Nofirkerî,” sometimes before it, as in [--] “Nofirkerî Papî.” It was finally decided to place it at the beginning, preceded by the group [--] “King of Upper and Lower Egypt,” which expresses in its fullest extent the power granted by the gods to the Pharaoh alone; the other, or birth-name, came after it, accompanied by the words [--]. “Son of the Sun.” There were inscribed, either before or above these two solar names --which are exclusively applied to the visible and living body of the master--the two names of the sparrow-hawk, which belonged especially to the soul; first, that of the double in the tomb, and then that of the double while still incarnate. Four terms seemed thus necessary to the Egyptians in order to define accurately the Pharaoh, both in time and in eternity.  Long centuries were needed before this subtle analysis of the royal person, and the learned graduation of the formulas which corresponded to it, could transform the Nome chief, become by conquest suzerain over all other chiefs and king of all Egypt, into a living god here below, the all-powerful son and successor of the gods; but the divine concept of royalty, once implanted in the mind, quickly produced its inevitable consequences. From the moment that the Pharaoh became god upon earth, the gods of heaven, his fathers or his brothers, and the goddesses recognized him as their son, and, according to the ceremonial imposed by custom in such cases, consecrated his adoption by offering him the breast to suck, as they would have done to their own child.  [Illustration: 028.jpg THE GODDESS ADOPTS THE KING BY SUCKLING HIM]       Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Insinger. The      original is in the great speos of Silsilis. The king here      represented is Harmhabît of the XVIIIth dynasty; cf.      Champollion, _Monuments de l’Egypt et de la Nubie,_ pl.      cix., No. 3; Rosellini, _Monumenti Storici,_ pl. xliv. 5;      Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 121 b.  Ordinary mortals spoke of him only in symbolic words, designating him by some periphrasis: Pharaoh, “Pirûi-Aûi,” the Double Palace, “Prûîti,” the Sublime Porte, His Majesty,* the Sun of the two lands, Horus master of the palace, or, less ceremoniously, by the indeterminate pronoun “One.”       * The title “Honûf” is translated by the same authors,      sometimes as “His Majesty,” sometimes as “His Holiness.” The      reasons for translating it “His Majesty,” as was originally      proposed by Champollion, and afterwards generally adopted,      have been given last of all by E. de Rougé.  The greater number of these terms is always accompanied by a wish addressed to the sovereign for his “life,” “health,” and “strength,” the initial signs of which are written after all his titles. He accepts all this graciously, and even on his own initiative, swears by his own life, or by the favour of Râ, but he forbids his subjects to imitate him: for them it is a sin, punishable in this world and in the next, to adjure the person of the sovereign, except in the case in which a magistrate requires from them a judicial oath.  [Illustration: 029.jpg THE CUCUPHA-HEADED SCEPTRE.]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the engraving in Prisse      d’Avennes, _Recherches sur les légendes royales et l’époque      du règne de Schai ou Scheraï,_ in the _Revue Archéologique_,      1st series, vol. ii. p. 467. The original is now preserved      in the Bibliothèque Nationale, to which it was presented by      Prisse d’Avennes. It is of glazed earthenware, of very      delicate and careful workmanship.  He is approached, moreover, as a god is approached, with downcast eyes, and head or back bent; they “sniff the earth” before him, they veil their faces with both hands to shut out the splendour of his appearance; they chant a devout form of adoration before submitting to him a petition. No one is free from this obligation: his ministers themselves, and the great ones of his kingdom, cannot deliberate with him on matters of state, without inaugurating the proceeding by a sort of solemn service in his honour, and reciting to him at length a eulogy of his divinity. They did not, indeed, openly exalt him above the other gods, but these were rather too numerous to share heaven among them, whilst he alone rules over the “Entire Circuit of the Sun,” and the whole earth, its mountains and plains, are in subjection under his sandalled feet. People, no doubt, might be met with who did not obey him, but these were rebels, adherents of Sît, “Children of Euin,” who, sooner or later, would be overtaken by punishment.

The viper or uraeus, in metal or gilded wood, which rose from his forehead, was imbued with a mysterious life, which made it a means of executing his vengeance and accomplishing his secret purposes. It was supposed to vomit flames and to destroy those who should dare to attack its master in battle. The supernatural virtues which it communicated to the crown, made it an enchanted thing which no one could resist. Lastly, Pharaoh had his temples where his enthroned statue, animated by one of his doubles, received worship, prophesied, and fulfilled all the functions of a Divine Being, both during his life, and after he had rejoined in the tomb his ancestors the gods, who existed before him and who now reposed impassively within the depths of their pyramids.**       * This identification, suggested by Champollion, is, from      force of custom, still adhered to, in nearly all works on      Egyptology. But we know from ancient evidence that the      cucupha was a bird, perhaps a hoopoe; the sceptre of the      gods, moreover, is really surmounted by the head of a      quadruped having a pointed snout and long retreating ears,      and belonging to the greyhound, jackal, or jerboa species.       ** This method of distinguishing deceased kings is met with      as far back as the “Song of the Harpist,” which the      Egyptians of the Ramesside period attributed to the founder      of the XIth dynasty. The first known instance of a temple      raised by an Egyptian king to his double is that of      Amenôthes III.  Man, as far as his body was concerned, and god in virtue of his soul and its attributes, the Pharaoh, in right of this double nature, acted as a constant mediator between heaven and earth. He alone was fit to transmit the prayers of men to his fathers and his brethren the gods. Just as the head of a family was in his household the priest _par excellence_ of the gods of that family,--just as the chief of a nome was in his nome the priest _par excellence_ in regard to the gods of the nome,--so was Pharaoh the priest _par excellence_ of the gods of all Egypt, who were his special deities. He accompanied their images in solemn processions; he poured out before them the wine and mystic milk, recited the formulas in their hearing, seized the bull who was the victim with a lasso and slaughtered it according to the rite consecrated by ancient tradition. Private individuals had recourse to his intercession, when they asked some favour from on high; as, however, it was impossible for every sacrifice to pass actually through his hands, the celebrating priest proclaimed at the beginning of each ceremony that it was the king who made the offering--_Sûtni di hotpu_--he and none other, to Osiris, Phtah, and Ka-Harmakhis, so that they might grant to the faithful who implored the object of their desires, and, the declaration being accepted in lieu of the act, the king was thus regarded as really officiating on every occasion for his subjects.*       *I do not agree with Prof. Ed. Meyer, or with Prof. Erman,      who imagine that this was the first instance of the      practice, and that it had been introduced into Nubia before      its adoption on Egyptian soil. Under the Ancient Empire we      meet with more than one functionary who styles himself, in      some cases during his master’s lifetime, in others shortly      after his death, “Prophet of Horus who lives in the palace,”       or “Prophet of Kheops,” “Prophet of Sondi,” “Prophet of      Kheops, of Mykerinos, of Usirkaf,” or “of other sovereigns.”  He thus maintained daily intercourse with the gods, and they, on their part, did not neglect any occasion of communicating with him. They appeared to him in dreams to foretell his future, to command him to restore a monument which was threatened with ruin, to advise him to set out to war, to forbid him risking his life in the thick of the fight.*       * Among other examples, the texts mention the dream in which      Thûtmosis IV., while still a royal prince, received from      Phrâ-Harmakhis orders to unearth the Great Sphinx, the dream      in which Phtah forbids Minephtah to take part in the battle      against the peoples of the sea, that by which Tonûatamon,      King of Napata, is persuaded to undertake the conquest of      Egypt. Herodotus had already made us familiar with the      dreams of Sabaco and of the high priest Sethos.  Communication by prophetic dreams was not, however, the method usually selected by the gods: they employed as interpreters of their wishes the priests and the statues in the temples. The king entered the chapel where the statue was kept, and performed in its presence the invocatory rites, and questioned it upon the subject which occupied his mind. The priest replied under direct inspiration from on high, and the dialogue thus entered upon might last a long time. Interminable discourses, whose records cover the walls of the Theban temples, inform us what the Pharaoh said on such occasions, and in what emphatic tones the gods replied. Sometimes the animated statues raised their voices in the darkness of the sanctuary and themselves announced their will; more frequently they were content to indicate it by a gesture. When they were consulted on some particular subject and returned no sign, it was their way of signifying their disapprobation. If, on the other hand, they significantly bowed their head, once or twice, the subject was an acceptable one, and they approved it. No state affair was settled without asking their advice, and without their giving it in one way or another.  The monuments, which throw full light on the supernatural character of the Pharaohs in general, tell us but little of the individual disposition of any king in particular, or of their everyday life. When by chance we come into closer intimacy for a moment with the sovereign, he is revealed to us as being less divine and majestic than we might have been led to believe, had we judged him only by his impassive expression and by the pomp with which he was surrounded in public. Not that he ever quite laid aside his grandeur; even in his home life, in his chamber or his garden, during those hours when he felt himself withdrawn from public gaze, those highest in rank might never forget when they approached him that he was a god. He showed himself to be a kind father, a good-natured husband,* ready to dally with his wives and caress them on the cheek as they offered him a flower, or moved a piece upon the draught-board.       * As a literary example of what the conduct of a king was      like in his family circle, we may quote the description of      King Minîbphtah, in the story of Satni-Khâmoîs. The pictures      of the tombs at Tel-el-Amarna show us the intimate terms on      which King Khuniaton lived with his wife and daughters, both      big and little.  He took an interest in those who waited on him, allowed them certain breaches of etiquette when he was pleased with them, and was indulgent to their little failings. If they had just returned from foreign lands, a little countrified after a lengthy exile from the court, he would break out into pleasantries over their embarrassment and their unfashionable costume,--kingly pleasantries which excited the forced mirth of the bystanders, but which soon fell flat and had no meaning for those outside the palace. The Pharaoh was fond of laughing and drinking; indeed, if we may believe evil tongues, he took so much at times as to incapacitate him for business. The chase was not always a pleasure to him, hunting in the desert, at least, where the lions evinced a provoking tendency to show as little respect for the divinity of the prince as for his mortal subjects; but, like the chiefs of old, he felt it a duty to his people to destroy wild beasts, and he ended by counting the slain in hundreds, however short his reign might be.*       *Amenôthes III. had killed as many as a hundred and two      lions during the first ten years of his reign.  A considerable part of his time was taken up in war--in the east, against the Libyans in the regions of the Oasis; in the Nile Valley to the south of Aswan against the Nubians; on the Isthmus of Suez and in the Sinaitic Peninsula against the Bedouin; frequently also in a civil war against some ambitious noble or some turbulent member of his own family. He travelled frequently from south to north, and from north to south, leaving in every possible place marked traces of his visits--on the rocks of Elephantine and of the first cataract, on those of Silsilis or of El-Kab, and he appeared to his vassals as Tûmû himself arisen among them to repress injustice and disorder. He restored or enlarged the monuments, regulated equitably the assessment of taxes and charges, settled or dismissed the lawsuits between one town and another concerning the appropriation of the water, or the possession of certain territories, distributed fiefs which had fallen vacant, among his faithful servants, and granted pensions to be paid out of the royal revenues.*       * These details are not found on the historical monuments,      but are furnished to us by the description given in “The      Book of Knowledge of what there is in the other world” of      the course of the sun across the domain of the hours of      night; the god is there described as a Pharaoh passing      through his kingdom, and all that he does for his vassals,      the dead, is identical with what Pharaoh was accustomed to      do for his subjects,"]]]
