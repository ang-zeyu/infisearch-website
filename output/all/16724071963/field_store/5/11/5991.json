Marvell's Cambridge days were over.  The vacations, no inconsiderable part of the year, were probably spent by Marvell under his father's roof at Hull, where his two elder sisters were married and settled. It is not to be wondered at that Andrew Marvell should, for so many years, have represented Hull in the House of Commons, for both he and his family were well known in the town. The elder Marvell added to his reputation as a teacher and preacher the character of a devoted servant of his flock in the hour of danger. The plague twice visited Hull during the time of the elder Marvell, first in 1635 and again in 1638. In those days men might well pray to be delivered from \"plague, pestilence, and famine.\" Hull suffered terribly on both occasions. We have seen, in comparatively recent times, the effect of the cholera upon large towns, and the plague was worse than the cholera many times over. The Hull preacher, despite the stigma of _facetiousness_, which still clings to him, stuck to his post, visiting the sick, burying the dead, and even, which seems a little superfluous, preaching and afterwards printing \"by request\" their funeral sermons. A brave man, indeed, and one reserved for a tragic end.  In April 1638 the poet's mother died. In the following November the elder Marvell married a widow lady, but his own end was close upon him. The earliest consecutive account of this strange event is in Gent's _History of Hull_ (1735):--\"This year, 1640, the Rev. Mr. Andrew Marvell, Lecturer of Hull, sailing over the Humber in company with Madame Skinner of Thornton College and a young beautiful couple who were going to be wedded; a speedy Fate prevented the designed happy union thro' a violent storm which overset the boat and put a period to all their lives, nor were there any remains of them or the vessel ever after found, tho' earnestly sought for on distant shores.\"  Thus died by drowning a brave man, a good Christian, and an excellent clergyman of the Reformed Church of England. The plain narrative just quoted has been embroidered by many long-subsequent writers in the interests of those who love presentiments and ghostly intimations of impending events, and in one of these versions it is recorded, that though the morning was clear, the breeze fair, and the company gay, yet when stepping into the boat \"the reverend man exclaimed, 'Ho for Heaven,' and threw his staff ashore and left it to Providence to fulfil its awful warning.\"  So melancholy an occurrence naturally excited great attention, and long lingered in local memories. Everybody in Hull knew who was their member's father.  There is an obstinate tradition quite unverifiable that Mrs. Skinner, the mother of the beautiful young lady who was drowned with the elder Marvell, adopted the young Marvell as a son, sending to Cambridge for him after his father's death, and providing him with the means of travel, and that afterwards she bequeathed him her estate. Whether there is any truth in this story cannot now be ascertained. The Skinners were a well-known Hull family, one of them, a brother of that Cyriac Skinner who was urged by Milton in immortal verse to enjoy himself whilst the mood was on him, having been Mayor of Hull. The lady, doubtless, had money, and Andrew Marvell was in need of money, and appears to have been supplied with it. It is quite possible the tradition is true.

CHAPTER II  \"THE HAPPY GARDEN-STATE\"   The seventeenth century was the century of travel for educated Englishmen--of long, leisurely travel. Milton's famous Italian tour lasted fifteen months. John Evelyn's _Wander-Jahre_ occupied four years. Andrew Marvell lived abroad in France, Spain, Holland, and Italy from 1642 to 1646, and we have Milton's word for it that when the traveller returned he was well acquainted with the French, Dutch, Spanish, and Italian languages. Andrew Marvell was a highly cultivated man, living in a highly cultivated age, in daily converse with scholars, poets, philosophers, and men of very considerable scientific attainments. In reading Clarendon and Burnet, and whilst turning over Aubrey's delightful gossip, it is impossible not to be struck with the width and variety of the learning as well as with the wit of the period. Intellectually it was a great age.  No record remains of Marvell's travels during these years. Up and down his writings the careful reader will come across pleasant references to foreign manners and customs, betokening the keen humorous observer, and the possession of that wide-eyed faculty that takes a pleasure, half contemplative, half the result of animal spirits, in watching the way of the world wherever you may chance to be. Of another and an earlier traveller, Sir Henry Wotton, we read in \"Walton's _Life_.\"     \"And whereas he was noted in his youth to have a sharp wit and apt to    jest, _that_ by time, travel, and conversation was so polished and    made useful, that his company seemed to be one of the delights of    mankind.\"  In all Marvell's work, as poet, as Parliamentarian, as controversialist, we shall see the travelled man. Certainly no one ever more fully grasped the sense of the famous sentence given by Wotton to Milton, when the latter was starting on his travels: \"_I pensieri stretti ed il viso sciolto._\"  Marvell was in Rome about 1645. I can give no other date during the whole four years. This, our only date, rests upon an assumption. In Marvell's earliest satirical poem he gives an account of a visit he paid in Rome to the unlucky poetaster Flecknoe, who was not in Rome until 1645. If, therefore, the poem records an actual visit, it follows that the author of the poem was in Rome at the same time. It is not very near, but it is as near as we can get.  Richard Flecknoe was an Irish priest of blameless life, with a passion for scribbling and for printing. His exquisite reason for both these superfluous acts is worth quoting:--     \"I write chiefly to avoid idleness, and print to avoid the imputation    (of idleness), and as others do it to live after they are dead, I do    it only not to be thought dead whilst I am alive.\"[20:1]  Such frankness should have disarmed ridicule, but somehow or another this amiable man came to be regarded as the type of a dull author, and his name passed into a proverb for stupidity, so much so that when Dryden in 1682 was casting about how best to give pain to Shadwell, he devised the plan of his famous satire, \"MacFlecknoe,\" where in biting verse he describes Flecknoe (who was happily dead) as an aged Prince--                         \"Who like Augustus young     Was called to empire and had governed long;     In prose and verse was owned, without dispute,     Through all the realms of nonsense absolute.\"  Dryden goes on to picture the aged Flecknoe,        \"pondering which of all his sons was fit     To reign and wage immortal war with Wit,\"  and fixing on Shadwell.      \"Shadwell alone my perfect image bears,     Mature in dulness from his tender years;     Shadwell alone, of all my sons, is he     Who stands confirmed in full stupidity:     The rest to some faint meaning make pretence,     But Shadwell never deviates into sense.\"  Thus has it come about that Flecknoe, the Irish priest, whom Marvell visited in his Roman garret in 1645, bears a name ever memorable in literature.  Marvell's own poem, though eclipsed by the splendour of Glorious John's resounding lines, has an interest of its own as being, in its roughly humorous way, a forerunner of the \"Dunciad\" and \"Grub Street\" literature, by which in sundry moods 'tis \"pleasure to be bound.\" It describes seeking out the poetaster in his lodging \"three staircases high,\" at the sign of the Pelican, in a room so small that it seemed \"a coffin set in the stair's head.\" No sooner was the rhymer unearthed than straightway he began to recite his poetry in dismal tones, much to his visitor's dismay:--      \"But I who now imagin'd myself brought     To my last trial, in a serious thought     Calm'd the disorders of my youthful breast     And to my martyrdom preparèd rest.     Only this frail ambition did remain,     The last distemper of the sober brain,     That there had been some present to assure     The future ages how I did endure.\"  To stop the cataract of \"hideous verse,\" Marvell invited the scarecrow to dinner, and waits while he dresses. As they turn to leave, for the room is so small that the man who comes in last must be the first to go out, they meet a friend of the poet on the stairs, who makes a third at dinner. After dinner Flecknoe produces ten quires of paper, from which the friend proceeds to read, but so infamously as to excite their author's rage:--      \"But all his praises could not now appease     The provok't Author, whom it did displease     To hear his verses by so just a curse     That were ill made, condemned to be read worse:     And how (impossible!) he made yet more     Absurdities in them than were before:     For his untun'd voice did fall or raise     As a deaf man upon the Viol plays,     Making the half-points and the periods run     Confus'der than the atoms in the sun:     Thereat the poet swell'd with anger full,\"  and after violent"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17388"],["title","Andrew Marvell (#4)"],["body","retires in dudgeon back to his room. The faithful friend is in despair. What is he to do to make peace? \"Who would commend his mistress now?\" Marvell                  \"counselled him to go in time     Ere the fierce poet's anger turned to rhyme.\"  The advice was taken, and Marvell, finding himself at last free from boredom, went off to St. Peter's to return thanks.  This poem is but an unsatisfactory _souvenir de voyage_, but it is all there is.  What Marvell was doing during the stirring years 1646-1650 is not known. Even in the most troubled times men go about their business, and our poet was always a man of affairs. As for his opinions during these years, we can only guess at them from those to which he afterwards gave expression. Marvell was neither a Republican nor a Puritan. Like his father before him, he was a Protestant and a member of the Reformed Church of England. He stood for both King and Parliament. Archbishop Laud he distrusted, and it may well be detested, but good churchmen have often distrusted and even detested their archbishops. Mr. Gladstone had no great regard for Archbishop Tait. Before the Act of Uniformity and the repressive legislation that followed upon its heels had driven English dissent into its final moulds, it was not doctrine but ceremonies that disturbed men's minds; and Marvell belonged to that school of English churchmen, by no means the least distinguished school, which was not disposed to quarrel with their fellow-Christians over white surplices, the ring in matrimony, or the attitude during Holy Communion. He shared the belief of a contemporary that no system is bad enough to destroy a good man, or good enough to save a bad one.  The Civil War was to Marvell what it was to most wise men not devoured by faction--a deplorable event. Twenty years after he wrote in the _Rehearsal Transprosed_:--     \"Whether it be a war of religion or of liberty it is not worth the    labour to inquire. Whichsoever was at the top, the other was at the    bottom; but upon considering all, I think the cause was too good to    have been fought for. Men ought to have trusted God--they ought to    have trusted the King with that whole matter. The arms of the Church    are prayers and tears, the arms of the subject are patience and    petitions. The King himself being of so accurate and piercing a    judgment would soon have felt it where it stuck. For men may spare    their pains when Nature is at work, and the world will not go the    faster for our driving. Even as his present Majesty's happy    Restoration did itself, so all things else happen in their best and    proper time, without any heed of our officiousness.\"[24:1]  In the face of this passage and many another of the like spirit, it is puzzling to find such a man, for example, as Thomas Baker, the ejected non-juring Fellow and historian of St. John's College, Cambridge (1656-1740), writing of Marvell as \"that bitter republican\"; and Dryden, who probably knew Marvell, comparing his controversial pamphlets with those of Martin Marprelate, or at all events speaking of Martin Marprelate as \"the Marvell of those times.\"[24:2] A somewhat anti-prelatical note runs through Marvell's writings, but it is a familiar enough note in the works of the English laity, and by no means dissevers its possessor from the Anglican Church. But there are some heated expressions in the satires which probably gave rise to the belief that Marvell was a Republican.[24:3]  During the Commonwealth Marvell was content to be a civil servant. He entertained for the Lord-Protector the same kind of admiration that such a loyalist as Chateaubriand could not help feeling for Napoleon. Even Clarendon's pedantic soul occasionally vibrates as he writes of Oliver, and compares his reputation in foreign courts with that of his own royal master. When the Restoration came Marvell rejoiced. Two old-established things had been destroyed by Cromwell--Kings and Parliaments, and Marvell was glad to see them both back again in England.  Some verses of Marvell's attributable to this period (1646-1650) show him keeping what may be called Royalist company. With a dozen other friends of Richard Lovelace, the Cavalier poet and the author of two of the most famous stanzas in English verse, Marvell contributed some commendatory lines addressed to his \"noble friend, Mr. Richard Lovelace, upon his Poems,\" which appeared with the poems themselves in that year of fate, 1649. \"After the murder of the King,\" says Anthony Wood, \"Lovelace was set at liberty, and having by that time consumed all his estate, grew very melancholy, became very poor in body and purse, was the object of charity, went in ragged clothes (whereas when he was in glory he wore cloth of gold and silver), and mostly lodged in obscure and dirty places, more befitting the worst of beggars and poorest of servants.\"  Then it was that _Lucasta_ made its first appearance. When the fortunes of the gallant poet were at their lowest and never to revive, Marvell seizes the occasion to deplore the degeneracy of the times, a familiar theme with poets:--      \"Our civil wars have lost the civic crown,     He highest builds who with most art destroys,     And against others' fame his own employs.\"  He then glances scornfully at the new Presbyterian censorship of the press:--      \"The barbèd censurers begin to look     Like the grim consistory on thy book,     And on each line cast a reforming eye,\"  and suggests that _Lucasta_ is in danger because in 1642 its author had been imprisoned by order of the House of Commons for presenting a petition from Kent which prayed for the restoration of the Book of Common Prayer. This danger is, however, overcome by the ladies, who rise in arms to defend their favourite poet.      \"But when the beauteous Ladies came to know     That their dear Lovelace was endangered so,     Lovelace that thaw'd the most congealèd breast,     He who lov'd best and them defended best,     They all in mutiny, though yet undrest,     Sally'd.\"  One of them challenged Marvell as to whether he had not been of the poet's traducers, but he answered No!      \"O No, mistake not, I reply'd, for I     In your defence or in his cause would die.     But he, secure of glory and of time,     Above their envy or my aid doth climb.     Him, bravest men and fairest nymphs approve,     His book in them finds Judgment, with you, Love.\"  Lovelace did not live to see the Restoration, but died in a mean lodging near Shoe Lane in April 1658, and was buried in St. Bridget's Church. Let us indulge the hope that the friends who occupied so many of the introductory pages of Lovelace's _Lucasta_ occasionally enlivened the solitude and relieved the distress of the poet whose praises they had once sung with so much vigour. As Marvell was undoubtedly a friendly man, and one who loved to be alone with his friends, and had never any house of his own to keep up, living for the most part in hired lodgings, it would be unkind to doubt that he at least did not forget Lovelace in his poverty and depression of spirit.  In 1649 thirty-three poets combined to weep over the early grave of the Lord Henry Hastings, the eldest son of the sixth Earl of Huntingdon, who died of the smallpox in the twentieth year of his age. Not even this plentiful discharge of poets' tears should rob the young nobleman of his claim to be regarded as a fine example of the great learning, accomplishments, and high spirits of the age. We can still produce the thirty-three poets, but what young nobleman is there who can boast such erudition as had rewarded the scorned delights and the laborious days of this Lord Hastings? We have at least the satisfaction of knowing that did such a one exist he probably would not die of the smallpox. Among the poets who wept on this occasion were Herrick, Sir John Denham, Andrew Marvell, and John Dryden, then a Westminster schoolboy, whose description of the smallpox is as bad as the disease.  Marvell's verses begin very prettily and soon introduce a characteristic touch:--      \"Go, stand betwixt the Morning and the Flowers,     And ere they fall arrest the early showers,     Hastings is dead; and we disconsolate     With early tears must mourn his early fate.\"  In 1650 Marvell, then in his twenty-ninth year, went to live with Lord Fairfax at Nunappleton House in Yorkshire, as tutor to the only child and daughter of the house, Mary Fairfax, aged twelve years (born 30th July 1638). This proved to be a great event in Marvell's life as a poet, and it happened at an epoch in the distinguished career of the famous Parliamentarian general      \"Whose name in arms through Europe rings.\"  Lord Fairfax, though he had countenanced, if not approved, the trial and deposition of the king, had resolutely held himself aloof from the proceedings which, beginning on Saturday the 20th of January 1649, terminated so dismally on Tuesday the 30th. The strange part played by Lady Fairfax on the first day of the so-called trial (though it was no greater a travesty of justice than many a real trial both before and after) is one of the best-known stories in English history. There are several versions of it. Having provided herself with a seat in a small gallery in Westminster Hall, just above the heads of the judges, when her husband's name was called out as one of the commissioners, the intrepid lady (no Cavalier's dame, be it remembered, but a true blue Presbyterian), a brave soldier's daughter, cried out, \"Lord Fairfax is not here; he will never sit among you. You do wrong to name him as a sitting Commissioner.\" This is Rushworth's version, and he was present. Clarendon, who was not present, being abroad at the time, reports the words as, \"He has more wit than to be here.\"  Later on in the day, when the President Bradshaw interrupted the king and peremptorily bade him to answer the charges exhibited against him \"in the name of the Commons of England assembled, and of"]]]
