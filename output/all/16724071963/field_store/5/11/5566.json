Blavatsky (#4)"],["body","pass through the narrow gates of Occultism because they carry no personal luggage of human transitory sentiments along with them. They have got rid of the feeling of the lower personality, paralysed thereby the \"astral\" animal, and the golden, but narrow gate is thrown open before them. Not so with those who have to carry yet for several incarnations the burden of sins committed in previous lives, and even in their present existence. For such, unless they proceed with great caution, the golden gate of Wisdom may get transformed into the wide gate and the broad way \"that leadeth unto destruction,\" and therefore \"many be they that enter in thereby.\" This is the Gate of the Occult arts, practised for selfish motives and in the absence of the restraining and beneficent influence of Âtma-Vidyâ. We are in the Kali Yuga and its fatal influence is a thousand-fold more powerful in the West than it is in the East; hence the easy preys made by the Powers of the Age of Darkness in this cyclic struggle, and the many delusions under which the world is now laboring. One of these is the relative facility with which men fancy they can get at the \"Gate\" and cross the threshold of Occultism without any great sacrifice. It is the dream of most Theosophists, one inspired by desire for Power and personal selfishness, and it is not such feelings that can ever lead them to the coveted goal. For, as well said by one believed to have sacrificed himself for Humanity--\"Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life\" eternal, and therefore \"few there be that find it.\" (_Matt._ vii, 14) So strait indeed, that at the bare mention of some of the preliminary difficulties the affrighted Western candidates turn back and retreat with a shudder....  Let them stop here and attempt no more in their great weakness. For if, while turning their backs on the narrow gate, they are dragged by their desire for the Occult one step in the direction of the broad and more inviting gates of that golden mystery which glitters in the light of illusion, woe to them! It can lead only to Dugpa-ship, and they will be sure to find themselves very soon landed on that _Via Fatale_ of the _Inferno_, over whose portal Dante read the words:--      _Per me si va nella citta dolente_     _Per me si va nell' eterno dolore_     _Per me si va tra la perduta gente...._     THE BLESSINGS OF PUBLICITY   A well-known public lecturer, a distinguished Egyptologist, said, in one of his lectures against the teachings of Theosophy, a few suggestive words, which are now quoted and must be answered:--       It is a delusion to suppose there is anything in the experience or      wisdom of the past, the ascertained results of which can only be      communicated from beneath the cloak and mask of mystery....      Explanation is the Soul of Science. They will tell you _we cannot      have their knowledge without living their life_.... Public      experimental research, the printing press, and a free-thought      platform, have abolished the need of mystery. It is no longer      necessary for science to take the veil, as she was forced to do for      security in times past....  This is a very mistaken view in one aspect. \"Secrets of the purer and profounder life\" not only _may_ but _must_ be made universally known. But _there are secrets that kill_ in the arcana of Occultism, and unless a man _lives the life_ he cannot be entrusted with them.  The late Professor Faraday had very serious doubts whether it was quite wise and reasonable to give out to the public at large certain discoveries of modern science. Chemistry had led to the invention of too terrible means of destruction in our century to allow it to fall into the hands of the profane. What man of sense--in the face of such fiendish applications of dynamite and other explosive substances as are made by those incarnations of the Destroying Power, who glory in calling themselves Anarchists and Socialists--would not agree with us in saying:--Far better for mankind that it should never have blasted a rock by modern perfected means, than that it should have shattered the limbs of one per cent even of those who have been thus destroyed by the pitiless hand of Russian Nihilists, Irish Fenians, and Anarchists. That such discoveries, and chiefly their murderous application, ought to have been withheld from public knowledge may be shown on the authority of statistics and commissions appointed to investigate and record the result of the evil done. The following information gathered from public papers will give an insight into what may be in store for wretched mankind.  England alone--the center of civilization--has 21,268 firms fabricating and selling explosive substances.[E] But the centers of the dynamite trade, of infernal machines, and other such results of modern civilization, are chiefly at Philadelphia and New York. It is in the former city of \"Brotherly Love\" that the now most famous manufacturer of explosives flourishes. It is one of the well-known respectable citizens--the inventor and manufacturer of the most murderous \"dynamite toys\"--who, called before the Senate of the United States anxious to adopt means for the repression of a _too free trade_ in such implements, found an argument that ought to become immortalized for its cynical sophistry--\"My _machines_,\" that expert is reported to have said--\"are quite _harmless to look at_; as they may be manufactured in the shape of oranges, hats, boats, and anything one likes.... Criminal is he who murders people by means of such machines, not he who manufactures them. The firm refuses to admit that were there no supply there would be no incentive for demand on the market; but insists that every demand should be satisfied by a supply ready at hand.\"  That \"supply\" is the fruit of civilization and of the publicity given to the discovery of every murderous property in matter. What is it? As found in the Report of the Commission appointed to investigate the variety and character of the so-called \"infernal machines,\" so far the following implements of instantaneous human destruction are already on hand. The most fashionable of all among the many varieties fabricated by Mr. Holgate are the \"Ticker,\" the \"Eight Day Machine,\" the \"Little Exterminator,\" and the \"Bottle Machines.\" The \"Ticker\" is in appearance like a piece of lead, a foot long and four inches thick. It contains an iron or steel tube full of a kind of gunpowder invented by Holgate himself. That gunpowder, in appearance like any other common stuff of that name, has, however, an explosive power two hundred times stronger than common gunpowder; the \"Ticker\" containing thus a powder which equals in force two hundred pounds of the common gunpowder. At one end of the machine is fastened an invisible clock-work meant to regulate the time of the explosion, which time may be fixed from one minute to thirty-six hours. The spark is produced by means of a steel needle which gives a spark at the touch-hole, and communicates thereby the fire to the whole machine.  The \"Eight Day Machine\" is considered the most powerful, but at the same time the most complicated, of all those invented. One must be familiar with handling it before a full success can be secured. It is owing to this difficulty that the terrible fate intended for London Bridge and its neighborhood was turned aside by the instantaneous killing instead of the two Fenian criminals. The size and appearance of that machine changes, Proteus-like, according to the necessity of smuggling it in, in one or another way, unperceived by the victims. It may be concealed in bread, in a basket of oranges, in a liquid, and so on. The Commission of Experts is said to have declared that its explosive power is such as to reduce to atoms instantly the largest edifice in the world.  The \"Little Exterminator\" is an innocent-looking plain utensil having the shape of a modest jug. It contains neither dynamite nor powder, but secretes, nevertheless, a deadly gas, and has a hardly perceptible clock-work attached to its edge, the needle of which points to the time when that gas will effect its escape. In a shut-up room this new \"vril\" of lethal kind will _smother to death, nearly instantaneously_, every living being within a distance of a hundred feet radius of the murderous jug. With these three \"latest novelties\" in the high season of Christian civilization, the catalog of the dynamiters is closed; all the rest belongs to the old \"fashion\" of the past years. It consists of hats, _porte cigars_, bottles of ordinary kind, and even _ladies' smelling bottles_, filled with dynamite, nitro-glycerin, etc., etc.--weapons, some of which, following unconsciously Karmic law, killed many of the dynamiters in the last Chicago _revolution_. Add to this the forthcoming long-promised Keeley's vibratory force, capable of reducing in a few seconds a dead bullock to a heap of ashes, and then ask yourself if the _Inferno_ of Dante as a locality can ever rival earth in the production of more hellish engines of destruction?  Thus, if purely material implements are capable of blowing up, from a few corners, the greatest cities of the globe, provided the murderous weapons are guided by expert hands--what terrible dangers might not arise from magical _occult_ secrets being revealed, and allowed to fall into the possession of ill-meaning persons! A thousand times more dangerous and lethal are these, because neither the criminal hand, nor the _immaterial_ invisible weapon used, can ever be detected.  The congenital _black_ magicians--those who, to an innate propensity towards evil, unite highly-developed mediumistic natures--are but too numerous in our age. It is nigh time then that the psychologists and believers, at least, should cease advocating the beauties of publicity and claiming knowledge of the secrets of nature for all. It is not in our age of \"suggestion\" and \"explosives\" that Occultism can open wide the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17009"],["title","Studies in Occultism; A Series of Reprints from the Writings of H.

FOOTNOTES:  [A] So holy is the connexion thus formed deemed in the Greek Church, that a marriage between god-parents of the same child is regarded as the worst kind of incest, is considered illegal, and is dissolved by law; and this absolute prohibition extends even to the children of one of the sponsors as regards those of the other.  [B] Be it remembered that _all_ \"Chelas,\" even lay disciples, are called Upâsaka until after their first initiation, when they become Lanoo-Upâsaka. To that day, even those who belong to Lamaseries and are _set apart_, are considered as \"laymen.\"  [C] \"The _Yajña_,\" say the Brâhmans, \"exists from eternity, for it proceeded forth from the Supreme One ... in whom it lay dormant from '_no_ beginning.' It is the key to the Traividya, the thrice sacred science contained in the Rig verses, which teaches the Yajus or sacrificial mysteries. 'The Yajña' exists as an invisible thing at all times; it is like the latent power of electricity in an electrifying machine, requiring only the operation of a suitable apparatus in order to be elicited. It is supposed to extend from the _Ahavaniya_ or sacrificial fire to the heavens, forming a bridge or ladder by means of which the sacrificer can communicate with the world of gods and spirits, and even ascend when alive to their abodes.\"--Martin Haug's _Aitareya Brâhmana_.  \"This _Yajña_ is again one of the forms of the _Âkâsa_; and the mystic word calling it into existence and pronounced mentally by the initiated Priest is the Lost Word receiving impulse through WILL POWER.\"--_Isis Unveiled_, Vol. I. Introduction. See _Aitareya Brâhmana_, Haug.  [D] Those who would feel inclined to see three _Egos_ in one man will show themselves unable to perceive the metaphysical meaning. Man is a trinity composed of Body, Soul and Spirit; but _man_ is nevertheless _one_ and is surely not his body. It is the latter which is the property, the transitory clothing of the man. The three \"Egos\" are MAN in his three aspects on the astral, intellectual or psychic, and the Spiritual planes, or states.  [E] Nitro-glycerin has found its way even into medical compounds. Physicians and druggists are vying with the Anarchists in their endeavors to destroy the surplus of mankind. The famous chocolate tablets against dyspepsia are said to contain nitro-glycerin! They may save, but they can kill still more easily.     _There is No Religion Higher than Truth_  The Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society  _Established for the benefit of the people of the earth & all creatures_         *       *       *       *       *  OBJECTS  This BROTHERHOOD is part of a great and universal movement which has been active in all ages.  This Organization declares that Brotherhood is a fact in Nature. Its principal purpose is to teach Brotherhood, demonstrate that it is a fact in nature and make it a living power in the life of humanity.  Its subsidiary purpose is to study ancient and modern religions, science, philosophy and art; to investigate the laws of nature and the divine powers in man.         *       *       *       *       *  The Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society, founded by H.P. Blavatsky at New York, 1875, continued after her death under the leadership of the co-founder, William Q. Judge, and now under the leadership of their successor, Katherine Tingley, has its Headquarters at the International Theosophical Center, Point Loma, California.  This Organization is not in any way connected with nor does it endorse any other societies using the name of Theosophy.  The Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society welcomes to membership all who truly love their fellow men and desire the eradication of the evils caused by the barriers of race, creed, caste or color, which have so long impeded human progress; to all sincere lovers of truth and to all who aspire to higher and better things than the mere pleasures and interests of a worldly life, and are prepared to do all in their power to make Brotherhood a living energy in the life of humanity, its various departments offer unlimited opportunities.  The whole work of the Organization is under the direction of the Leader and Official Head, Katherine Tingley, as outlined in the Constitution.         *       *       *       *       *  Do not fail to profit by the following:       It is a regrettable fact that many people use the name of Theosophy      and of our Organization for self-interest, as also that of H.P.      Blavatsky, the Foundress, to attract attention to themselves and to      gain public support. This they do in private and public speech and      in publications, also by lecturing throughout the country. Without      being in any way connected with the Universal Brotherhood and      Theosophical Society, in many cases they permit it to be      inferred that they are, thus misleading the public, and many honest      inquirers are hence led away from the truths of Theosophy as      presented by H.P. Blavatsky and her successors, William Q. Judge      and Katherine Tingley, and practically exemplified in their      Theosophical work for the uplifting of humanity.     The International Brotherhood League  Founded in 1897 by Katherine Tingley   ITS OBJECTS ARE:  1. To help men and women to realize the nobility of their calling and their true position in life.  2. To educate children of all nations on the broadest lines of Universal Brotherhood, and to prepare destitute and homeless children to become workers for humanity.  3. To ameliorate the condition of unfortunate women, and assist them to a higher life.  4. To assist those who are, or have been, in prisons, to establish themselves in honorable positions in life.  5. To abolish capital punishment.  6. To bring about a better understanding between so-called savage and civilized races, by promoting a closer and more sympathetic relationship between them.  7. To relieve human suffering resulting from flood, famine, war, and other calamities; and, generally, to extend aid, help and comfort to suffering humanity throughout the world.
