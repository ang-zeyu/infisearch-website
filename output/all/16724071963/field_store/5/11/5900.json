He would have desired nothing better than to exhibit such liberality, had not the repeated calls on his purse at last constrained him to parsimony; he would have been ruined, and Egypt with him, had he given all that was expected of him. Except in a few extraordinary cases, the gifts sent never realised the expectations of the recipients; for instance, when twenty or thirty pounds of precious metal were looked for, the amount despatched would be merely two or three. The indignation of these disappointed beggars and their recriminations were then most amusing: From the time when my father and thine entered into friendly relations, they loaded each other with presents, and never waited to be asked to exchange amenities;* and now my brother sends me two minas of gold as a gift! Send me abundance of gold, as much as thy father sent, and even, for so it must be, more than thy father. ** Pretexts were never wanting to give reasonable weight to such demands: one correspondent had begun to build a temple or a palace in one of his capitals,*** another was reserving his fairest daughter for the Pharaoh, and he gave him to understand that anything he might receive would help to complete the brides trousseau.****       * Burnaburiash complains that the kings messengers had only      brought him on one occasion two minas of gold, on another      occasion twenty minas; moreover, that the quality of the      metal was so bad that hardly five minas of pure gold could      be extracted from it.       ** Literally, and they would never make each other a fair      request. The meaning I propose is doubtful, but it appears      to be required by the context. The letter from which this      passage was taken is from Burnaburiash, King of Babylon, to      Amenôthes IV.       *** This is the pretext advanced by Burnaburiash in the      letter just cited.       **** This seems to have been the motive in a somewhat      embarrassing letter which Dushratta, King of Mitanni, wrote      to the Pharaoh Amenôthes III. on the occasion of his fixing      the dowry of his daughter.  The princesses thus sent from Babylon or Mitanni to the court of Thebes enjoyed on their arrival a more honourable welcome, and were assigned a more exalted rank than those who came from Kharû and Phoenicia. As a matter of fact, they were not hostages given over to the conqueror to be disposed of at will, but queens who were united in legal marriage to an ally.* Once admitted to the Pharaohs court, they retained their full rights as his wife, as well as their own fortune and mode of life. Some would bring to their betrothed chests of jewels, utensils, and stuffs, the enumeration of which would cover both sides of a large tablet; others would arrive escorted by several hundred slaves or matrons as personal attendants.** A few of them preserved their original name,*** many assumed an Egyptian designation,**** and so far adapted themselves to the costumes, manners, and language of their adopted country, that they dropped all intercourse with their native land, and became regular Egyptians.       * The daughter of the King of the Khâti, wife of Ramses IL,      was treated, as we see from the monuments, with as much      honour as would have been accorded to Egyptian princesses of      pure blood.       ** Gilukhipa, who was sent to Egypt to become the wife of      Amenôthes III., took with her a company of three hundred and      seventy women for her service. She was a daughter of      Sutarna, King of Mitanni, and is mentioned several times in      the Tel el-Amarna correspondence.       *** For example, Gilukhipa, whose name is transcribed      Kilagîpa in Egyptian, and another princess of Mitanni, niece      of Gilukhipa, called Tadu-khîpa, daughter of Dushratta and      wife of Amenôthes IV.       **** The prince of the Khâtis daughter who married Ramses      II. is an example; we know her only by her Egyptian name      Mâîtnofîrûrî. The wife of Ramses III. added to the Egyptian      name of Isis her original name, Humazarati.  When, after several years, an ambassador arrived with greetings from their father or brother, he would be puzzled by the changed appearance of these ladies, and would almost doubt their identity: indeed, those only who had been about them in childhood were in such cases able to recognise them.* These princesses all adopted the gods of their husbands,** though without necessarily renouncing their own. From time to time their parents would send them, with much pomp, a statue of one of their national divinities--Ishtar, for example--which, accompanied by native priests, would remain for some months at the court.***       * This was the case with the daughter of Kallimmasin, King      of Babylon, married to Amenôthes III.; her fathers      ambassador did not recognise her.       ** The daughter of the King of the Khâti, wife of Ramses      II., is represented in an attitude of worship before her      deified husband and two Egyptian gods.       *** Dushratta of Mitanni, sending a statue of Ishtar to his      daughter, wife of Amenôthes III., reminds her that the same      statue had already made the voyage to Egypt in the time of      his father Sutarna.  The children of these queens ranked next in order to those whose mothers belonged to the solar race, but nothing prevented them marrying their brothers or sisters of pure descent, and being eventually raised to the throne. The members of their families who remained in Asia were naturally proud of these bonds of close affinity with the Pharaoh, and they rarely missed an opportunity of reminding him in their letters that they stood to him in the relationship of brother-in-law, or one of his fathers-in-law; their vanity stood them in good stead, since it afforded them another claim on the favours which they were perpetually asking of him.*       * Dushratta of Mitanni never loses an opportunity of calling      Aoienôthes III., husband of his sister Gilukhîpa, and of one      of his daughters, akhiya, my brother, and khatani-ya, my      son-in-law.  These foreign wives had often to interfere in some of the contentions which were bound to arise between two States whose subjects were in constant intercourse with one another. Invasions or provincial wars may have affected or even temporarily suspended the passage to and from of caravans between the countries of the Tigris and those of the Nile; but as soon as peace was re-established, even though it were the insecure peace of those distant ages, the desert traffic was again resumed and carried on with renewed vigour. The Egyptian traders who penetrated into regions beyond the Euphrates, carried with them, and almost unconsciously disseminated along the whole extent of their route, the numberless products of Egyptian industry, hitherto but little known outside their own country, and rendered expensive owing to the difficulty of transmission or the greed of the merchants. The Syrians now saw for the first time in great quantities, objects which had been known to them hitherto merely through the few rare specimens which made their way across the frontier: arms, stuffs, metal implements, household utensils--in fine, all the objects which ministered to daily needs or to luxury. These were now offered to them at reasonable prices, either by the hawkers who accompanied the army or by the soldiers themselves, always ready, as soldiers are, to part with their possessions in order to procure a few extra pleasures in the intervals of fighting.

The scene      here reproduced occurs in most of the Theban tombs of the      XVIIII. dynasty.  On the other hand, whole convoys of spoil were despatched to Egypt after every successful campaign, and their contents were distributed in varying proportions among all classes of society, from the militiaman belonging to some feudal contingent, who received, as a reward of his valour, some half-dozen necklaces or bracelets, to the great lord of ancient family or the Crown Prince, who carried off waggon-loads of booty in their train. These distributions must have stimulated a passion for all Syrian goods, and as the spoil was insufficient to satisfy the increasing demands of the consumer, the waning commerce which had been carried on from early times was once more revived and extended, till every route, whether by land or water, between Thebes, Memphis, and the Asiatic cities, was thronged by those engaged in its pursuit. It would take too long to enumerate the various objects of merchandise brought in almost daily to the marts on the Nile by Phoenician vessels or the owners of caravans. They comprised slaves destined for the workshop or the harem,* Hittite bulls and stallions, horses from Singar, oxen from Alasia, rare and curious animals such as elephants from Nîi, and brown bears from the Lebanon,** smoked and salted fish, live birds of many-coloured plumage, goldsmithswork*** and precious stones, of which lapis-lazuli was the chief.       * Syrian slaves are mentioned along with Ethiopian in the      _Anastasi Papyrus_, No. 1, and there is mention in the Tel      el-Amarna correspondence of Hittite slaves whom Dushratta of      Mitanni brought to Amenôthes III., and of other presents of      the same kind made by the King of Alasia as a testimony of      his grateful homage.       ** The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17325"],["title","History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 5 (of 12) (#5)"],["body","and the bear are represented on the tomb of      liakhmirî among the articles of tribute brought into Egypt.       *** The _Annals of Thutmosis III_. make a record in each      campaign of the importation of gold and silver vases,      objects in lapis-lazuli and crystal, or of blocks of the      same materials; the Theban tombs of this period afford      examples of the vases and blocks brought by the Syrians. The      Tel el-Amarna letters also mention vessels of gold or blocks      of precious stone sent as presents or as objects of exchange      to the Pharaoh by the King of Babylon, by the King of      Mitanni, by the King of the Hittites, and by other princes.      The lapis-lazuli of Babylon, which probably came from      Persia, was that which was most prized by the Egyptians on      account of the golden sparks in it, which enhanced the blue      colour; this is, perhaps, the Uknu of the cuneiform      inscriptions, which has been read for a long time as      crystal.  [Illustration: 032b.jpg PAINTED TABLETS IN THE HALL OF HARPS]  Wood for building or for ornamental work--pine,cypress, yew, cedar, and oak,* musical instruments,** helmets, leathern jerkins covered with metal scales, weapons of bronze and iron,*** chariots,**** dyed and embroidered stuffs,^ perfumes,^^ dried cakes, oil, wines of Kharû, liqueurs from Alasia, Khâti, Singar, Naharaim, Amurru, and beer from Qodi.^^^       * Building and ornamental woods are often mentioned in the      inscriptions of Thûtmosis III. A scene at Karnak represents      Seti I. causing building-wood to be cut in the region of the      Lebanon. A letter of the King of Alasia speaks of      contributions of wood which several of his subjects had to      make to the King of Egypt.       ** Some stringed instruments of music, and two or three      kinds of flutes and flageolets, are designated in Egyptian      by names borrowed from some Semitic tongue--a fact which      proves that they were imported; the wooden framework of the      harp, decorated with sculptured heads of Astartô, figures      among the objects coming from Syria in the temple of the      Theban Anion.       *** Several names of arms borrowed from some Semitic dialect      have been noticed in the texts of this period. The objects      as well as the words must have been imported into Egypt,      e.g. the quiver, the sword and javelins used by the      charioteers. Cuirasses and leathern jerkins are mentioned in      the inscriptions of Thûtmosis III.       **** Chariots plated with gold and silver figure frequently      among the spoils of Thûtmosis III.: the Anastasi Papyrus,      No. 1, contains a detailed description of Syrian chariots--      Markabûti--with a reference to the localities whore certain      parts of them were made;--the country of the Amurru, that of      Aûpa, the town of Pahira. The Tel el-Amarna correspondence      mentions very frequently chariots sent to the Pharaoh by the      King of Babylon, either as presents or to be sold in Egypt;      others sent by the King of Alasia and by the King of      Mitanni.       ^ Some linen, cotton, or woollen stuffs are mentioned in the      _Anastasi Papyrus_, No. 4, and elsewhere as coming from      Syria. The Egyptian love of white linen always prevented      their estimating highly the coloured and brocaded stuffs of      Asia; and one sees nowhere, in the representations, any      examples of stuffs of such origin, except on furniture or in      ships equipped with something of the kind in the form of      sails.       ^^ The perfumed oils of Syria are mentioned in a general way      in the _Anastasi Papyrus_, No. 1; the King of Alasia speaks      of essences which he is sending to Amenôthes III.; the King      of Mitanni refers to bottles of oil which he is forwarding      to Gilukhîpa and to Tii.       ^^^ A list of cakes of Syrian origin is found in the      _Anastasi Papyrus_, No. 1; also a reference to balsamic oils      from Naharaim, and to various oils which had arrived in the      ports of the Delta, to the wines of Syria, to palm wine and      various liqueurs manufactured in Alasia, in Singar, among      the Khâti, Amorites, and the people of. Tikhisa; finally, to      the beer of Qodi.  [Illustration: 034.jpg. THE BEAR AND ELEPHANT BROUGHT AS TRIBUTE IN THE TOMB OF RAKHMIRI]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph of Prisse      dAvennes sketch.  On arriving at the frontier, whether by sea or by land, the majority of these objects had to pay the custom dues which were rigorously collected by the officers of the Pharaoh. This, no doubt, was a reprisal tariff, since independent sovereigns, such as those of Mitanni, Assyria, and Babylon, were accustomed to impose a similar duty on all the products of Egypt. The latter, indeed, supplied more than she received, for many articles which reached her in their raw condition were, by means of native industry, worked up and exported as ornaments, vases, and highly decorated weapons, which, in the course of international traffic, were dispersed to all four corners of the earth. The merchants of Babylon and Assyria had little to fear as long as they kept within the domains of their own sovereign or in those of the Pharaoh; but no sooner did they venture within the borders of those turbulent states which separated the two great powers, than they were exposed to dangers at every turn. Safe-conducts were of little use if they had not taken the additional precaution of providing a strong escort and carefully guarding their caravan, for the Shaûsû concealed in the depths of the Lebanon or the needy sheikhs of Kharû could never resist the temptation to rob the passing traveller.*       * The scribe who in the reign of Ramses II. composed the      _Travels of an Egyptian_, speaks in several places of      marauding tribes and robbers, who infested the roads      followed by the hero. The Tel el-Amarna correspondence      contains a letter from the King of Alasia, who exculpates      himself from being implicated in the harsh treatment certain      Egyptians had received in passing through his territory; and      another letter in which the King of Babylon complains that      Chaldoan merchants had been robbed at Khinnatun, in Galilee,      by the Prince of Akku (Acre) and his accomplices: one of      them had his feet cut off, and the other was still a      prisoner in Akku, and Burnaburiash demands from Amenôthes      IV. the death of the guilty persons.  The victims complained to their king, who felt no hesitation in passing on their woes to the sovereign under whose rule the pillagers were supposed to live. He demanded their punishment, but his request was not always granted, owing to the difficulties of finding out and seizing the offenders. An indemnity, however, could be obtained which would nearly compensate the merchants for the loss sustained. In many cases justice had but little to do with the negotiations, in which self-interest was the chief motive; but repeated refusals would have discouraged traders, and by lessening the facilities of transit, have diminished the revenue which the state drew from its foreign commerce.  The question became a more delicate one when it concerned the rights of subjects residing out of their native country. Foreigners, as a rule, were well received in Egypt; the whole country was open to them; they could marry, they could acquire houses and lands, they enjoyed permission to follow their own religion unhindered, they were eligible for public honours, and more than one of the officers of the crown whose tombs we see at Thebes were themselves Syrians, or born of Syrian parents on the banks of the Nile.*       * In a letter from the King of Alasia, there is question of      a merchant who had died in Egypt. Among other monuments      proving the presence of Syrians about the Pharaoh, is the      stele of Ben-Azana, of the town of Zairabizana, surnamed      Ramses-Empirî: he was surrounded with Semites like himself.  Hence, those who settled in Egypt without any intention of returning to their own country enjoyed all the advantages possessed by the natives, whereas those who took up a merely temporary abode there were more limited in their privileges. They were granted the permission to hold property in the country, and also the right to buy and sell there, but they were not allowed to transmit their possessions at will, and if by chance they died on Egyptian soil, their goods lapsed as a forfeit to the crown. The heirs remaining in the native country of the dead man, who were ruined by this confiscation, sometimes petitioned the king to interfere in their favour with a view of obtaining restitution. If the Pharaoh consented to waive his right of forfeiture, and made over the confiscated objects or their equivalent to the relatives of the deceased, it was solely by an act of mercy, and as an example to foreign governments to treat Egyptians with a like clemency should they chance to proffer a similar request.*       * All this seems to result from a letter in which the King      of Alasia demands from Amenôthes III. the restitution of the      goods of one of his subjects who had died in Egypt; the tone      of the letter is that of one asking a favour, and on the      supposition that the King of Egypt had a right to keep the      property of a foreigner dying on his territory.  It is also not improbable that the sovereigns themselves had a personal interest in more than one commercial undertaking, and that they were the partners, or, at any rate, interested in the enterprises, of many of their subjects, so that any loss sustained by one of the latter would eventually fall upon themselves. They had, in fact, reserved to themselves the privilege of carrying on several lucrative industries, and of disposing of the products to foreign buyers, either to those who purchased them out and out, or else through the medium of agents, to whom "]]]
