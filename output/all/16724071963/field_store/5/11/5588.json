[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17026"],["title","Craphound (#5)"],["body"," to have some competition tonight, I think,\" I said, and nodded at Scott/Billy. \"I think he's Billy; the one whose mother sold us -- you -- the cowboy trunk.\"  \"Really?\" Craphound said, and it felt like we were partners again, scoping out the competition. Suddenly I felt a knife of shame, like I was betraying Scott/Billy somehow. I took a step back.  \"Jerry, I am very sorry that we argued.\"  I sighed out a breath I hadn't known I was holding in. \"Me, too.\"  \"They're starting the bidding. May I sit with you?\"  And so the three of us sat together, and Craphound shook Scott/Billy's hand and the auctioneer started into his harangue.  It was a night for unusual occurrences. I bid on a piece, something I told myself I'd never do. It was a set of four matched Li'l Orphan Annie Ovaltine glasses, like Grandma's had been, and seeing them in the auctioneer's hand took me right back to her kitchen, and endless afternoons passed with my colouring books and weird old-lady hard candies and Liberace albums playing in the living room.  \"Ten,\" I said, opening the bidding.  \"I got ten, ten,ten, I got ten, who'll say twenty, who'll say twenty, twenty for the four.\"  Craphound waved his bidding card, and I jumped as if I'd been stung.  \"I got twenty from the space cowboy, I got twenty, sir will you say thirty?\"  I waved my card.  \"That's thirty to you sir.\"  \"Forty,\" Craphound said.  \"Fifty,\" I said even before the auctioneer could point back to me. An old pro, he settled back and let us do the work.  \"One hundred,\" Craphound said.  \"One fifty,\" I said.  The room was perfectly silent. I thought about my overextended MasterCard, and wondered if Scott/Billy would give me a loan.  \"Two hundred,\" Craphound said.  Fine, I thought. Pay two hundred for those. I can get a set on Queen Street for thirty bucks.  The auctioneer turned to me. \"The bidding stands at two. Will you say two-ten, sir?\"  I shook my head. The auctioneer paused a long moment, letting me sweat over the decision to bow out.  \"I have two -- do I have any other bids from the floor? Any other bids? Sold, $200, to number 57.\" An attendant brought Craphound the glasses. He took them and tucked them under his seat.  #  I was fuming when we left. Craphound was at my elbow. I wanted to punch him -- I'd never punched anyone in my life, but I wanted to punch him.  We entered the cool night air and I sucked in several lungfuls before lighting a cigarette.  \"Jerry,\" Craphound said.  I stopped, but didn't look at him. I watched the taxis pull in and out of the garage next door instead.  \"Jerry, my friend,\" Craphound said.  \"_What_?\" I said, loud enough to startle myself. Scott, beside me, jerked as well.  \"We're going. I wanted to say goodbye, and to give you some things that I won't be taking with me.\"  \"What?\" I said again, Scott just a beat behind me.  \"My people -- we're going. It has been decided. We've gotten what we came for.\"  Without another word, he set off towards his van. We followed along behind, shell-shocked.  Craphound's exoskeleton executed another macro and slid the panel-door aside, revealing the cowboy trunk.  \"I wanted to give you this. I will keep the glasses.\"  \"I don't understand,\" I said.  \"You're all leaving?\" Scott asked, with a note of urgency.  \"It has been decided. We'll go over the next twenty-four hours.\"  \"But _why_?\" Scott said, sounding almost petulant.  \"It's not something that I can easily explain. As you must know, the things we gave you were trinkets to us -- almost worthless. We traded them for something that was almost worthless to you -- a fair trade, you'll agree -- but it's time to move on.\"  Craphound handed me the cowboy trunk. Holding it, I smelled the lubricant from his exoskeleton and the smell of the attic it had been mummified in before making its way into his hands. I felt like I almost understood.  \"This is for me,\" I said slowly, and Craphound nodded encouragingly. \"This is for me, and you're keeping the glasses. And I'll look at this and feel. . .\"  \"You understand,\" Craphound said, looking somehow relieved.  And I _did_. I understood that an alien wearing a cowboy hat and sixguns and giving them away was a poem and a story, and a thirtyish bachelor trying to spend half a month's rent on four glasses so that he could remember his Grandma's kitchen was a story and a poem, and that the disused fairground outside Calgary was a story and a poem, too.  \"You're craphounds!\" I said. \"All of you!\"  Craphound smiled so I could see his gums and I put down the cowboy trunk and clapped my hands.  #  Scott recovered from his shock by spending the night at his office, crunching numbers talking on the phone, and generally getting while the getting was good. He had an edge -- no one else knew that they were going.  He went pro later that week, opened a chi-chi boutique on Queen Street, and hired me on as chief picker and factum factotum.  Scott was not Billy the Kid. Just another Bay Street shyster with a cowboy jones. From the way they come down and spend, there must be a million of them.  Our draw in the window is a beautiful mannequin I found, straight out of the Fifties, a little boy we call The Beaver. He dresses in chaps and a Sheriff's badge and sixguns and a miniature Stetson and cowboy boots with worn spurs, and rests one foot on a beautiful miniature steamer trunk whose leather is worked with cowboy motifs.  He's not for sale at any price.  --  <rdf:RDF xmlns=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/\"     xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"     xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"> <Work rdf:about=\"http://craphound.com/place/Cory_Doctorow_-_Craphound.txt\">    <dc:title>Craphound</dc:title>    <dc:date>1998-3-1</dc:date>    <dc:description>A science&#45;fiction short story by Cory Doctorow about    alien thrift&#45;store enthusiasts, from the short story collection \"A Place    So Foreign and Eight More,\" published by Four Walls Eight Windows press in    September, 2003 (ISBN: 1568582862)</dc:description>    <dc:creator><Agent>       <dc:title>Cory Doctorow</dc:title>    </Agent></dc:creator>    <dc:rights><Agent>       <dc:title>Cory Doctorow</dc:title>    </Agent></dc:rights>    <dc:type rdf:resource=\"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text\" /> <license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/\" /> </Work>  <License rdf:about=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/\">    <permits rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Reproduction\" />    <permits rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Distribution\" />    <requires rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Notice\" />    <requires rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Attribution\" />    <prohibits rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/CommercialUse\" /> </License>  </rdf:RDF>"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17027"],["title","Return to Pleasure Island (#0)"],["body","(C) 1999 by Cory Doctorow     Return to Pleasure Island  Cory Doctorow  From \"A Place So Foreign and Eight More,\" a short story collection published in September, 2003 by Four Walls Eight Windows Press (ISBN 1568582862).

Originally Published in Realms of Fantasy August 1999  \"By design or default, something about this story (and I can't describe exactly what because I don't know) disturbed me a great deal, though it's a well-written and unique take on an old tale. Others may find it more palatable. If Doctorow's intent was to unsettle, he succeeded...\"   - J. G. Stinson,    Tangent Online    http://www.tangentonline.com/reviews/magazine.php3?review=153  --  Blurbs and quotes:  * Cory Doctorow straps on his miner's helmet and takes you deep into the   caverns and underground rivers of Pop Culture, here filtered through SF-coloured   glasses. Enjoy.   - Neil Gaiman    Author of American Gods and Sandman   * Few writers boggle my sense of reality as much as Cory Doctorow.  His vision   is so far out there, you'll need your GPS to find your way back.   - David Marusek    Winner of the Theodore Sturgeon Award, Nebula Award nominee  * Cory Doctorow is one of our best new writers: smart, daring, savvy,   entertaining, ambitious, plugged-in, and as good a guide to the wired world of   the twenty-first century that stretches out before us as you're going to find.   - Gardner Dozois    Editor, Asimov's SF  * He sparkles!  He fizzes!  He does backflips and breaks the furniture! Science   fiction needs Cory Doctorow!   - Bruce Sterling    Author of The Hacker Crackdown and Distraction  * Cory Doctorow strafes the senses with a geekspeedfreak explosion of gomi kings   with heart, weirdass shapeshifters from Pleasure Island and jumping automotive   jazz joints.  If this is Canadian science fiction, give me more.   - Nalo Hopkinson    Author of Midnight Robber and Brown Girl in the Ring  * Cory Doctorow is the future of science fiction.  An nth-generation hybrid of   the best of Greg Bear, Rudy Rucker, Bruce Sterling and Groucho Marx, Doctorow   composes stories that are as BPM-stuffed as techno music, as idea-rich as the   latest issue of NEW SCIENTIST, and as funny as humanity's efforts to improve   itself.  Utopian, insightful, somehow simultaneously ironic and heartfelt, these   nine tales will upgrade your basal metabolism, overwrite your cortex with new   and efficient subroutines and generally improve your life to the point where   you'll wonder how you ever got along with them.  Really, you should need a   prescription to ingest this book.  Out of all the glittering crap life and our   society hands us, craphound supreme Doctorow has managed to fashion some   industrial-grade art.\"   - Paul Di Filippo    Author of The Steampunk Trilogy  * As scary as the future, and twice as funny. In this eclectic and electric   collection Doctorow strikes sparks off today to illuminate tomorrow, which is   what SF is supposed to do. And nobody does it better.   - Terry Bisson    Author of Bears Discover Fire  --  A note about this story  This story is from my collection, \"A Place So Foreign and Eight More,\" published by Four Walls Eight Windows Press in September, 2003, ISBN 1568582862. I've released this story, along with five others, under the terms of a Creative Commons license that gives you, the reader, a bunch of rights that copyright normally reserves for me, the creator.  I recently did the same thing with the entire text of my novel, \"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\" (http://craphound.com/down), and it was an unmitigated success. Hundreds of thousands of people downloaded the book -- good news -- and thousands of people bought the book -- also good news. It turns out that, as near as anyone can tell, distributing free electronic versions of books is a great way to sell more of the paper editions, while simultaneously getting the book into the hands of readers who would otherwise not be exposed to my work.  I still don't know how it is artists will earn a living in the age of the Internet, but I remain convinced that the way to find out is to do basic science: that is, to do stuff and observe the outcome. That's what I'm doing here. The thing to remember is that the very *worst* thing you can do to me as an artist is to not read my work -- to let it languish in obscurity and disappear from posterity. Most of the fiction I grew up on is out-of-print, and this is doubly true for the short stories. Losing a couple bucks to people who would have bought the book save for the availability of the free electronic text is no big deal, at least when compared to the horror that is being irrelevant and unread. And luckily for me, it appears that giving away the text for free gets me more paying customers than it loses me.
