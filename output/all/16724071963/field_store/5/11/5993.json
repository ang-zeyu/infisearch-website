When in the east the morning ray     Hangs out the colours of the day,     The bee through these known alleys hums,     Beating the dian with its drums.     Then flowers their drowsy eyelids raise,     Their silken ensigns each displays,     And dries its pan, yet dank with dew,     And fills its flask with odours new.     These as their Governor goes by     In fragrant volleys they let fly,     And to salute their Governess     Again as great a charge they press:     None for the virgin nymph; for she     Seems with the flowers a flower to be.     And think so still! though not compare     With breath so sweet, or cheek so fair!     Well shot, ye firemen! Oh, how sweet     And round your equal fires do meet,     Whose shrill report no ear can tell,     But echoes to the eye and smell!     See how the flowers, as at parade,     Under their colours stand displayed;     Each regiment in order grows,     That of the tulip, pink and rose.     But when the vigilant patrol     Of stars walk round about the pole,     Their leaves, which to the stalks are curled,     Seem to their staves the ensigns furled.     Then in some flower's belovèd hut,     Each bee, as sentinel, is shut,     And sleeps so too, but, if once stirred,     She runs you through, nor asks the word.      Oh, thou, that dear and happy isle,     The garden of the world erewhile,     Thou Paradise of the four seas,     Which heaven planted us to please,     But, to exclude the world, did guard     With watery, if not flaming sword,--     What luckless apple did we taste,     To make us mortal, and thee waste?     Unhappy! shall we never more     That sweet militia restore,     When gardens only had their towers     And all the garrisons were flowers,     When roses only arms might bear,     And men did rosy garlands wear?     Tulips, in several colours barred,     Were then the Switzers of our guard;     The gardener had the soldier's place,     And his more gentle forts did trace;     The nursery of all things green     Was then the only magazine;     The winter quarters were the stoves,     Where he the tender plants removes.     But war all this doth overgrow:     We ordnance plant, and powder sow.      The arching boughs unite between     The columns of the temple green,     And underneath the wingèd quires     Echo about their tunèd fires.     The nightingale does here make choice     To sing the trials of her voice;     Low shrubs she sits in, and adorns     With music high the squatted thorns;     But highest oaks stoop down to hear,     And listening elders prick the ear;     The thorn, lest it should hurt her, draws     Within the skin its shrunken claws.     But I have for my music found     A sadder, yet more pleasing sound;     The stock-doves, whose fair necks are graced     With nuptial rings, their ensigns chaste,     Yet always, for some cause unknown,     Sad pair, unto the elms they moan.     O why should such a couple mourn,     That in so equal flames do burn!     Then as I careless on the bed     Of gelid strawberries do tread,     And through the hazels thick espy     The hatching throstle's shining eye,     The heron, from the ash's top,     The eldest of its young lets drop,     As if it stork-like did pretend     That tribute to its lord to send.      Thus I, easy philosopher,     Among the birds and trees confer;     And little now to make me, wants,     Or of the fowls, or of the plants;     Give me but wings as they, and I     Straight floating on the air shall fly;     Or turn me but, and you shall see     I was but an inverted tree.     Already I begin to call     In their most learn'd original,     And where I language want, my signs     The bird upon the bough divines,     And more attentive there doth sit     Than if she were with lime-twigs knit,     No leaf does tremble in the wind,     Which I returning cannot find.     One of these scattered Sibyls' leaves     Strange prophecies my fancy weaves,     And in one history consumes,     Like Mexique paintings, all the plumes;     What Rome, Greece, Palestine e'er said,     I in this light mosaic read.     Thrice happy he, who, not mistook,     Hath read in Nature's mystic book!     And see how chance's better wit     Could with a mask my studies hit!     The oak-leaves me embroider all,     Between which caterpillars crawl;     And ivy, with familiar trails,     Me licks and clasps, and curls and hales.     Under this Attic cope I move,     Like some great prelate of the grove;     Then, languishing with ease, I toss     On pallets swoln of velvet moss,     While the wind, cooling through the boughs,     Flatters with air my panting brows.     Thanks for your rest, ye mossy banks,     And unto you, cool zephyrs, thanks,     Who, as my hair, my thoughts too shed,     And winnow from the chaff my head!      How safe, methinks, and strong behind     These trees, have I encamped my mind,     Where beauty, aiming at the heart,     Bends in some tree its useless dart,     And where the world no certain shot     Can make, or me it toucheth not,     But I on it securely play     And gall its horsemen all the day.     Bind me, ye woodbines, in your twines     Curl me about, ye gadding vines,     And oh so close your circles lace,     That I may never leave this place!     But, lest your fetters prove too weak,     Ere I your silken bondage break,     Do you, O brambles, chain me too,     And, courteous briars, nail me through!      Oh what a pleasure 'tis to hedge     My temples here with heavy sedge,     Abandoning my lazy side,     Stretched as a bank unto the tide,     Or to suspend my sliding foot     On the osier's underminèd root,     And in its branches tough to hang,     While at my lines the fishes twang?     But now away, my hooks, my quills,     And angles, idle utensils!     The young MARIA walks to-night;      'Tis she that to these gardens gave     That wondrous beauty which they have;     She straightness on the woods bestows;     To her the meadow sweetness owes;     Nothing could make the river be     So crystal pure, but only she,     She yet more pure, sweet, straight, and fair     Than gardens, woods, meads, rivers are.      This 'tis to have been from the first     In a domestic heaven nursed,     Under the discipline severe     Of FAIRFAX, and the starry VERE;     Where not one object can come nigh     But pure, and spotless as the eye,     And goodness doth itself entail     On females, if there want a male.\"  This poem, having a biographical value, I have quoted at, perhaps, too great length. Other poems of this garden-period of Marvell's life are better known. His own English version of his Latin poem _Hortus_ contains lovely stanzas:--      \"How vainly men themselves amaze     To win the palm, the oak, or bays;     And their uncessant labours see     Crowned from some single herb or tree,     Whose short and narrow-vergèd shade     Does prudently their toils upbraid;     While all the flowers and trees do close,     To weave the garlands of Repose!      Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,     And Innocence, thy sister dear?     Mistaken long, I sought you then     In busy companies of men.     Your sacred plants, if here below,     Only among the plants will grow;     Society is all but rude     To this delicious solitude.      No white nor red was ever seen     So amorous as this lovely green.      What wond'rous life is this I lead!     Ripe apples drop about my head;     The luscious clusters of the vine     Upon my mouth do crush their wine;     The nectarine, and curious peach,     Into my hands themselves do reach;     Stumbling on melons, as I pass,     Insnared with flowers, I fall on grass.      Meanwhile the mind, from pleasure less,     Withdraws into its happiness;--     The mind, that ocean where each kind     Does straight its own resemblance find;--     Yet it creates, transcending these,     Far other worlds, and other seas,     Annihilating all that's made     To a green thought in a green shade.\"[46:1]  Well known as are Marvell's lines to his Coy Mistress, I have not the heart to omit them, so eminently characteristic are they of his style and humour:--      \"Had we but world enough and time,     This coyness, lady, were no crime.     We would sit down and think which way     To walk, and pass our long love's day.     Thou by the Indian Ganges' side     Should'st rubies find: I by the tide     Of Humber would complain. I would     Love you ten years before the Flood,     And you should, if you please, refuse     Till the conversion of the Jews.     My vegetable love should grow     Vaster than empires and more slow.     An hundred years should go to praise     Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze;     Two hundred to adore each breast,     But thirty thousand to the rest;     An age at least to every part,     And the last age should show your heart.     For, lady, you deserve this state,     Nor would I love at lower rate.       But at my back I always hear     Time's wingèd chariot hurrying near,     And yonder all before us lie     Deserts of vast eternity.     Thy beauty shall no more be found,     Nor in thy marble vault shall sound     My echoing song; then worms shall try     That long-preserved virginity,     And your quaint honour turn to dust,     And into ashes all my lust.     The grave's a fine and private place,     But none, I think, do there embrace.       Now, therefore, while the youthful hue     Sits on thy skin like morning dew,     And while thy willing soul transpires     At every pore with instant fires,     Now, let us sport us while we may;     And now, like amorous birds of prey,     Rather at once our time devour,     Than languish in his slow-chapt power!     Let us roll all our strength, and all     Our sweetness up"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17388"],["title","Andrew Marvell (#8)"],["body"," one ball;     And tear our pleasures with rough strife,     Through the iron gates of life!

Poetry is a personal matter. The very canons of criticism are themselves literature. If we like the _Ars Poetica_, it is because we enjoy reading Horace.

CHAPTER III  A CIVIL SERVANT IN THE TIME OF THE COMMONWEALTH   When Andrew Marvell first made John Milton's acquaintance is not known. They must both have had common friends at or belonging to Cambridge. Fairfax may have made the two men known to each other, although it is just as likely that Milton introduced Marvell to Fairfax. All we know is that when the engagement at Nunappleton House came to an end, Marvell, being then minded to serve the State in some civil capacity, applied to the Secretary for Foreign Tongues for what would now be called a testimonial, which he was fortunate enough to obtain in the form of a letter to the Lord-President of the Council, John Bradshaw. Milton seems always to have liked Bradshaw, who was not generally popular even on his own side, and in the _Defensio Secunda pro populo Anglicano_ extols his character and attainments in sonorous latinity. Bradshaw had become in February 1649 the first President of the new Council of State, which, after the disappearance of the king and the abolition of the House of Lords, took over the burden of the executive, and claimed the right to scrape men's consciences by administering to anybody it chose an oath requiring them to approve of what the House of Commons had done against the king, and of their abolition of kingly government and of the House of Peers, and that the legislative and supreme power was wholly in the House of Commons.  Before the creation of this Council the duties of Latin Secretary to the Parliament had been discharged by Georg Rudolph Weckherlin, a German diplomat who had married an Englishwoman. He retired in bad health at this time, and Milton was appointed to his place in 1649. When, later on, the sight of the most illustrious of all our civil servants failed him, Weckherlin returned to the office as Milton's assistant. In December 1652 ill-health again compelled Weckherlin's retirement.[49:1]  Milton's letter to Bradshaw, who had made his home at Eton, is dated February 21, 1653, and is as follows:--     \"MY LORD,--But that it would be an interruption to the    public wherein your studies are perpetually employed, I should now    and then venture to supply thus my enforced absence with a line or    two, though it were onely my business, and that would be no slight    one, to make my due acknowledgments of your many favours; which I    both do at this time and ever shall; and have this farther, which I    thought my part to let you know of, that there will be with you    to-morrow upon some occasion of business a gentleman whose name is    Mr. Marvile, a man whom both by report and the converse I have had    with him of singular desert for the State to make use of, who also    offers himself, if there be any employment for him. His father was    the Minister of Hull, and he hath spent four years abroad in Holland,    France, Italy, and Spain to very good purpose, as I believe, and the    gaining of these four languages, besides he is a scholer and    well-read in the Latin and Greek authors, and no doubt of an approved    conversation, for he now comes lately out of the house of the Lord    Fairfax, who was Generall, where he was intrusted to give some    instructions in the languages to the Lady, his daughter. If upon the    death of Mr. Weckerlyn the Councell shall think that I shall need any    assistance in the performance of my place (though for my part I find    no encumbrance of that which belongs to me, except it be in point of    attendance at Conferences with Ambassadors, which I must confess in    my condition I am not fit for) it would be hard for them to find a    man so fit every way for that purpose as this gentleman: one who, I    believe, in a short time would be able to do them as much service as    Mr. Ascan. This, my Lord, I write sincerely without any other end    than to perform my duty to the publick in helping them to an humble    servant; laying aside those jealousies and that emulation which mine    own condition might suggest to me by bringing in such a coadjutor;    and remain, my Lord, your most obliged and faithful servant,                                                           JOHN MILTON.     \"_Feb. 21, 1652_ (O.S.).\"     Addressed: \"For the Honourable the Lord Bradshawe.\"  No handsomer testimonial than this was ever penned. It was unsuccessful. When Milton wrote to Bradshaw, Weckherlin was in fact dead, and on his retirement in the previous December, John Thurloe, the very handy Secretary of the Council, had for the time assumed Weckherlin's duties, and obtained on that score an addition to his salary. No actual vacancy, therefore, occurred on Weckherlin's death. None the less, shortly afterwards, Philip Meadows, also a Cambridge man, was appointed Milton's assistant, and Marvell had to wait four years longer for his place.  When Marvell's connection with Eton first began is not to be ascertained. His friend, John Oxenbridge, who had been driven from his tutorship at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, by Laud in 1634 to      \"Where the remote Bermudas ride,\"  but had returned home, became in 1652 a Fellow of Eton College. Oliver St. John, who at this time was Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, and had married Oxenbridge's sister, was known to Marvell, and may have introduced him to his brother-in-law. At all events Marvell frequently visited Eton, where, however, he had the good sense to frequent not merely the cloisters, but the poor lodgings where the \"ever memorable\" John Hales, ejected from his fellowship, spent the last years of his life.     \"I account it no small honour to have grown up into some part of his    acquaintance and conversed awhile with the living remains of one of    the clearest heads and best prepared breasts in Christendom.\"[51:1]  Hales died in 1656, and his _Golden Remains_ were first published three years later. Marvell's words of panegyric are singularly well chosen. It is a curious commentary upon the confused times of the Civil War and Restoration that perhaps never before, and seldom, if ever, since, has England contained so many clear heads and well-prepared breasts as it did then. Small indeed is the influence of men of thought upon their immediate surroundings.  The Lord Bradshaw, we know, had a home in Eton, and on the occasion of one of Marvell's evidently frequent visits to the Oxenbridges, Milton entrusted him with a letter to Bradshaw and a presentation copy of the _Secunda defensio_. Marvell delivered both letter and book, and seems at once to have informed the distinguished author that he had done so. But alas for the vanity of the writing man! The sublime poet, who in his early manhood had composed _Lycidas_, and was in his old age to write _Paradise Lost_, demanded further and better particulars as to the precise manner in which the chief of his office received, not only the book, but the letter which accompanied it. Nobody is now left to think much of Bradshaw, but in 1654 he was an excellent representative of the class Carlyle was fond of describing as the _alors célèbre_. Prompted by this desire, Milton must have written to Marvell hinting, as he well knew how to do, his surprise at the curtness of his friend's former communication, and Marvell's reply to this letter has come down to us. It is Marvell's glory that long before _Paradise Lost_ he recognised the essential greatness of the blind secretary, and his letter is a fine example of the mode of humouring a great man. Be it remembered, as we read, that this letter was not addressed to one of the greatest names in literature, but to a petulant and often peevish scholar, living of necessity in great retirement, whose name is never once mentioned by Clarendon, and about whom the voluminous Thurloe, who must have seen him hundreds of times, has nothing to say except that he was \"a blind man who wrote Latin letters.\" Odder still, perhaps, Richard Baxter, whose history of his own life and times is one of the most informing books in the world, never so much as mentions the one and only man whose name can, without any violent sense of unfitness, be given to the age about which Baxter was writing so laboriously.     \"HONOURED SIR,--I did not satisfie my self in the account I    gave you of presentinge your Book to my Lord, although it seemed to    me that I writ to you all"]]]
