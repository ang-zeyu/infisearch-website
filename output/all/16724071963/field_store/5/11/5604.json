Feel the edge.”  I have seldom seen a more indignant face than the one which my new acquaintance bent over the weapon, as he held it to the light, and ran his finger along the blade. He could have not frowned more heavily if he had recognized the knife.  “The villains!” he muttered. “The damned villains!”  “Villains?” I queried. “Did you see more than one of them, then?”  “Didn't you?” he asked quickly. “Yes, yes, to be sure! There was at least one other beggar skulking down below.” He stood looking at me, the knife in his hand, though mine was held out for it. “Don't you think, Mr. Cole, that it's our duty to hand this over to the police? I--I've heard of other cases about these Inns of Court. There's evidently a gang of them, and this knife might convict the lot; there's no saying; anyway I think the police should have it. If you like I'll take it to Scotland Yard myself, and hand it over without mentioning your name.”  “Oh, if you keep my name out of it,” said I, “and say nothing about it here in the hotel, you may do what you like, and welcome! It's the proper course, no doubt; only I've had publicity enough, and would sooner have felt that blade in my body than set my name going again in the newspapers.”  “I understand,” he said, with his well-bred sympathy, which never went a shade too far; and he dropped the weapon into a drawer, as the boots entered with the tray. In a minute he had brewed two steaming jorums of spirits-and-water; as he handed me one, I feared he was going to drink my health, or toast my luck; but no, he was the one man I had met who seemed, as he said, to “understand.” Nevertheless, he had his toast.  “Here's confusion to the criminal classes in general,” he cried; “but death and damnation to the owners of that knife!”  And we clinked tumblers across the little oval table in the middle of the room. It was more of a sitting-room than mine; a bright fire was burning in the grate, and my companion insisted on my sitting over it in the arm-chair, while for himself he fetched the one from his bedside, and drew up the table so that our glasses should be handy. He then produced a handsome cigar-case admirably stocked, and we smoked and sipped in the cosiest fashion, though without exchanging many words.  You may imagine my pleasure in the society of a youth, equally charming in looks, manners and address, who had not one word to say to me about the _Lady Jermyn_ or my hen-coop. It was unique. Yet such, I suppose, was my native contrariety, that I felt I could have spoken of the catastrophe to this very boy with less reluctance than to any other creature whom I had encountered since my deliverance. He seemed so full of silent sympathy: his consideration for my feelings was so marked and yet so unobtrusive. I have called him a boy. I am apt to write as the old man I have grown, though I do believe I felt older then than now. In any case my young friend was some years my junior. I afterwards found out that he was six-and-twenty.  I have also called him handsome. He was the handsomest man that I have ever met, had the frankest face, the finest eyes, the brightest smile. Yet his bronzed forehead was low, and his mouth rather impudent and bold than truly strong. And there was a touch of foppery about him, in the enormous white tie and the much-cherished whiskers of the fifties, which was only redeemed by that other touch of devilry that he had shown me in the corridor. By the rich brown of his complexion, as well as by a certain sort of swagger in his walk, I should have said that he was a naval officer ashore, had he not told me who he was of his own accord.  “By the way,” he said, “I ought to give you my name. It's Rattray, of one of the many Kirby Halls in this country. My one's down in Lancashire.”  “I suppose there's no need to tell my name?” said I, less sadly, I daresay, than I had ever yet alluded to the tragedy which I alone survived. It was an unnecessary allusion, too, as a reference to the foregoing conversation will show.  “Well, no!” said he, in his frank fashion; “I can't honestly say there is.”  We took a few puffs, he watching the fire, and I his firelit face.  “It must seem strange to you to be sitting with the only man who lived to tell the tale!”  The egotism of this speech was not wholly gratuitous. I thought it did seem strange to him: that a needless constraint was put upon him by excessive consideration for my feelings. I desired to set him at his ease as he had set me at mine. On the contrary, he seemed quite startled by my remark.  “It is strange,” he said, with a shudder, followed by the biggest sip of brandy-and-water he had taken yet. “It must have been horrible--horrible!” he added to himself, his dark eyes staring into the fire.  “Ah!” said I, “it was even more horrible than you suppose or can ever imagine.”  I was not thinking of myself, nor of my love, nor of any particular incident of the fire that still went on burning in my brain. My tone was doubtless confidential, but I was meditating no special confidence when my companion drew one with his next words. These, however, came after a pause, in which my eyes had fallen from his face, but in which I heard him emptying his glass.  “What do you mean?” he whispered. “That there were other circumstances--things which haven't got into the papers?”  “God knows there were,” I answered, my face in my hands; and, my grief brought home to me, there I sat with it in the presence of that stranger, without compunction and without shame.  He sprang up and paced the room. His tact made me realize my weakness, and I was struggling to overcome it when he surprised me by suddenly stopping and laying a rather tremulous hand upon my shoulder.  “You--It wouldn't do you any good to speak of those circumstances, I suppose?” he faltered.  “No: not now: no good at all.”  “Forgive me,” he said, resuming his walk. “I had no business--I felt so sorry--I cannot tell you how I sympathize! And yet--I wonder if you will always feel so?”  “No saying how I shall feel when I am a man again,” said I. “You see what I am at present.” And, pulling myself together, I rose to find my new friend quite agitated in his turn.  “I wish we had some more brandy,” he sighed. “I'm afraid it's too late to get any now.”  “And I'm glad of it,” said I. “A man in my state ought not to look at spirits, or he may never look past them again. Thank goodness, there are other medicines. Only this morning I consulted the best man on nerves in London. I wish I'd gone to him long ago.”  “Harley Street, was it?”  “Yes.”  “Saw you on his doorstep, by Jove!” cried Rattray at once. “I was driving over to Hampstead, and I thought it was you. Well, what's the prescription?”  In my satisfaction at finding that he had not been dogging me intentionally (though I had forgotten the incident till he reminded me of it), I answered his question with unusual fulness.  “I should go abroad,” said Rattray. “But then, I always am abroad; it's only the other day I got back from South America, and I shall up anchor again before this filthy English winter sets in.”  Was he a sailor after all, or only a well-to-do wanderer on the face of the earth? He now mentioned that he was only in England for a few weeks, to have a look at his estate, and so forth; after which he plunged into more or less enthusiastic advocacy of this or that foreign resort, as opposed to the English cottage upon which I told him I had set my heart.  He was now, however, less spontaneous, I thought, than earlier in the night. His voice had lost its hearty ring, and he seemed preoccupied, as if talking of one matter while he thought upon another. Yet he would not let me go; and presently he confirmed my suspicion, no less than my first impression of his delightful frankness and cordiality, by candidly telling me what was on his mind.  “If you really want a cottage in the country,” said he, “and the most absolute peace and quiet to be got in this world, I know of the very thing on my land in Lancashire. It would drive me mad in a week; but if you really care for that sort of thing--”  “An occupied cottage?” I interrupted.  “Yes; a couple rent it from me, very decent people of the name of Braithwaite. The man is out all day, and won't bother you when he's in; he's not like other people, poor chap. But the woman 's all there, and would do her best for you in a humble, simple, wholesome sort of way.”  “You think they would take me in?”  “They have taken other men--artists as a rule.”  “Then it's a picturesque country?”  “Oh, it's that if it's nothing else; but not a town for miles, mind you, and hardly a village worthy the name.”  “Any fishing?”  “Yes--trout--small but plenty of 'em--in a beck running close behind the cottage.”  “Come,” cried I, “this sounds delightful! Shall you be up there?”  “Only for a day or two,” was the reply. “I shan't trouble you, Mr. Cole.”  “My dear sir, that wasn't my meaning at all. I'm only sorry I shall not see something of you on your own heath. I can't thank you enough for your kind suggestion. When do you suppose the Braithwaites could do with me?”  His charming smile rebuked my impatience.  “We must first see whether they can do with you at all,” said he. “I sincerely hope they can; but this is their time of year for tourists, though perhaps a little late. I'll tell you what I'll do. As a matter of fact, I'm going down there to-morrow, and I've got to telegraph to my place in any case to tell them when to meet me. I'll send the telegram first thing, and I'll make them send one back to say whether there's room in the cottage or not.”  I thanked him warmly, but asked"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17030"],["title","Super Man and the Bug Out (#0)"],["body","(C) 2001 Cory Doctorow     The Super Man and the Bugout  Cory Doctorow  From \"A Place So Foreign and Eight More,\" a short story collection published in September, 2003 by Four Walls Eight Windows Press (ISBN 1568582862). See http://craphound.com/place for more.  Originally published in On Spec, Fall 2001  \"It is certainly worth noting that the story in this issue which flagrantly violates the length limit, Cory Doctorow's 'The Super Man and the Bugout,' at close to 10,000 words, is also by far the best story... The story is both very funny, and a portrayal of a quite believable non-human human being.\"   - Rich Horton,    Tangent Online    http://www.tangentonline.com/reviews/magazine.php3?review=463  --  Blurbs and quotes:  * Cory Doctorow straps on his miner's helmet and takes you deep into the   caverns and underground rivers of Pop Culture, here filtered through SF-coloured   glasses. Enjoy.   - Neil Gaiman    Author of American Gods and Sandman   * Few writers boggle my sense of reality as much as Cory Doctorow.  His vision   is so far out there, you'll need your GPS to find your way back.   - David Marusek    Winner of the Theodore Sturgeon Award, Nebula Award nominee  * Cory Doctorow is one of our best new writers: smart, daring, savvy,   entertaining, ambitious, plugged-in, and as good a guide to the wired world of   the twenty-first century that stretches out before us as you're going to find.   - Gardner Dozois    Editor, Asimov's SF  * He sparkles!  He fizzes!  He does backflips and breaks the furniture!

If this is Canadian science fiction, give me more.   - Nalo Hopkinson    Author of Midnight Robber and Brown Girl in the Ring  * Cory Doctorow is the future of science fiction.  An nth-generation hybrid of   the best of Greg Bear, Rudy Rucker, Bruce Sterling and Groucho Marx, Doctorow   composes stories that are as BPM-stuffed as techno music, as idea-rich as the   latest issue of NEW SCIENTIST, and as funny as humanity's efforts to improve   itself.  Utopian, insightful, somehow simultaneously ironic and heartfelt, these   nine tales will upgrade your basal metabolism, overwrite your cortex with new   and efficient subroutines and generally improve your life to the point where   you'll wonder how you ever got along with them.  Really, you should need a   prescription to ingest this book.  Out of all the glittering crap life and our   society hands us, craphound supreme Doctorow has managed to fashion some   industrial-grade art.\"   - Paul Di Filippo    Author of The Steampunk Trilogy  * As scary as the future, and twice as funny. In this eclectic and electric   collection Doctorow strikes sparks off today to illuminate tomorrow, which is   what SF is supposed to do. And nobody does it better.   - Terry Bisson    Author of Bears Discover Fire  --  A note about this story  This story is from my collection, \"A Place So Foreign and Eight More,\" published by Four Walls Eight Windows Press in September, 2003, ISBN 1568582862. I've released this story, along with five others, under the terms of a Creative Commons license that gives you, the reader, a bunch of rights that copyright normally reserves for me, the creator.  I recently did the same thing with the entire text of my novel, \"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\" (http://craphound.com/down), and it was an unmitigated success. Hundreds of thousands of people downloaded the book -- good news -- and thousands of people bought the book -- also good news. It turns out that, as near as anyone can tell, distributing free electronic versions of books is a great way to sell more of the paper editions, while simultaneously getting the book into the hands of readers who would otherwise not be exposed to my work.  I still don't know how it is artists will earn a living in the age of the Internet, but I remain convinced that the way to find out is to do basic science: that is, to do stuff and observe the outcome. That's what I'm doing here. The thing to remember is that the very *worst* thing you can do to me as an artist is to not read my work -- to let it languish in obscurity and disappear from posterity. Most of the fiction I grew up on is out-of-print, and this is doubly true for the short stories. Losing a couple bucks to people who would have bought the book save for the availability of the free electronic text is no big deal, at least when compared to the horror that is being irrelevant and unread. And luckily for me, it appears that giving away the text for free gets me more paying customers than it loses me.
