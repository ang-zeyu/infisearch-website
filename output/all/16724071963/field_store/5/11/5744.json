Some of my mad friends might worm it out of you, and I don't want them coming down and bothering me.  I am going to be very busy with literature.  I'll walk the rest of the way.\"  Edwards saluted with a grin--he worshipped the original young heiress--and returned to his wheel.  \"There's one thing I want you to do for me,\" said Titania.  \"Call up my father and tell him I'm on the job.\"  \"Yes, miss,\" said Edwards, who would have run the limousine into a government motor truck if she had ordered it.  Miss Chapman's small gloved hand descended into an interesting purse that was cuffed to her wrist with a bright little chain.  She drew out a nickel--it was characteristic of her that it was a very bright and engaging looking nickel--and handed it gravely to her charioteer. Equally gravely he saluted, and the car, after moving through certain dignified arcs, swam swiftly away down Thackeray Boulevard.  Titania, after making sure that Edwards was out of sight, turned up Gissing Street with a fluent pace and an observant eye.  A small boy cried, \"Carry your bag, lady?\" and she was about to agree, but then remembered that she was now engaged at ten dollars a week and waved him away.  Our readers would feel a justifiable grudge if we did not attempt a description of the young lady, and we will employ the few blocks of her course along Gissing Street for this purpose.  Walking behind her, the observer, by the time she had reached Clemens Place, would have seen that she was faultlessly tailored in genial tweeds; that her small brown boots were sheltered by spats of that pale tan complexion exhibited by Pullman porters on the Pennsylvania Railroad; that her person was both slender and vigorous; that her shoulders were carrying a sumptuous fur of the colour described by the trade as nutria, or possibly opal smoke.  The word chinchilla would have occurred irresistibly to this observer from behind; he might also, if he were the father of a family, have had a fleeting vision of many autographed stubs in a check book.  The general impression that he would have retained, had he turned aside at Clemens Place, would be \"expensive, but worth the expense.\"  It is more likely, however, that the student of phenomena would have continued along Gissing Street to the next corner, being that of Hazlitt Street.  Taking advantage of opportunity, he would overtake the lady on the pavement, with a secret, sidelong glance.  If he were wise, he would pass her on the right side where her tilted bonnet permitted a wider angle of vision.  He would catch a glimpse of cheek and chin belonging to the category known (and rightly) as adorable; hair that held sunlight through the dullest day; even a small platinum wrist watch that might pardonably be excused, in its exhilarating career, for beating a trifle fast.  Among the greyish furs he would note a bunch of such violets as never bloom in the crude springtime, but reserve themselves for November and the plate glass windows of Fifth Avenue.  It is probable that whatever the errand of this spectator he would have continued along Gissing Street a few paces farther.  Then, with calculated innocence, he would have halted halfway up the block that leads to the Wordsworth Avenue \"L,\" and looked backward with carefully simulated irresolution, as though considering some forgotten matter. With apparently unseeing eyes he would have scanned the bright pedestrian, and caught the full impact of her rich blue gaze.  He would have seen a small resolute face rather vivacious in effect, yet with a quaint pathos of youth and eagerness.  He would have noted the cheeks lit with excitement and rapid movement in the bracing air.  He would certainly have noted the delicate contrast of the fur of the wild nutria with the soft V of her bare throat.  Then, to his surprise, he would have seen this attractive person stop, examine her surroundings, and run down some steps into a rather dingy-looking second-hand bookshop.  He would have gone about his affairs with a new and surprised conviction that the Almighty had the borough of Brooklyn under His especial care.  Roger, who had conceived a notion of some rather peevish foundling of the Ritz-Carlton lobbies and Central Park riding academies, was agreeably amazed by the sweet simplicity of the young lady.  \"Is this Mr. Mifflin?\" she said, as he advanced all agog from his smoky corner.  \"Miss Chapman?\" he replied, taking her bag.  \"Helen!\" he called.  \"Miss Titania is here.\"  She looked about the sombre alcoves of the shop.  \"I do think it's adorable of you to take me in,\" she said.  \"Dad has told me so much about you.  He says I'm impossible.  I suppose this is the literature he talks about.  I want to know all about it.\"  \"And here's Bock!\" she cried.  \"Dad says he's the greatest dog in the world, named after Botticelli or somebody.  I've brought him a present. It's in my bag.  Nice old Bocky!\"  Bock, who was unaccustomed to spats, was examining them after his own fashion.  \"Well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Mifflin.  \"We are delighted to see you.  I hope you'll be happy with us, but I rather doubt it.  Mr. Mifflin is a hard man to get along with.\"  \"Oh, I'm sure of it!\" cried Titania.  \"I mean, I'm sure I shall be happy!  You mustn't believe a word of what Dad says about me.  I'm crazy about books.  I don't see how you can bear to sell them.  I brought these violets for you, Mrs. Mifflin.\"  \"How perfectly sweet of you,\" said Helen, captivated already.  \"Come along, we'll put them right in water.  I'll show you your room.\"  Roger heard them moving about overhead.  It suddenly occurred to him that the shop was rather a dingy place for a young girl.  \"I wish I had thought to get in a cash register,\" he mused.  \"She'll think I'm terribly unbusiness-like.\"  \"Now,\" said Mrs. Mifflin, as she and Titania came downstairs again, \"I'm making some pastry, so I'm going to turn you over to your employer.  He can show you round the shop and tell you where all the books are.\"  \"Before we begin,\" said Titania, \"just let me give Bock his present.\" She showed a large package of tissue paper and, unwinding innumerable layers, finally disclosed a stalwart bone.  \"I was lunching at Sherry's, and I made the head waiter give me this.  He was awfully amused.\"  \"Come along into the kitchen and give it to him,\" said Helen.  \"He'll be your friend for life.\"  \"What an adorable kennel!\" cried Titania, when she saw the remodelled packing-case that served Bock as a retreat.  The bookseller's ingenious carpentry had built it into the similitude of a Carnegie library, with the sign READING-ROOM over the door; and he had painted imitation book-shelves along the interior.  \"You'll get used to Mr. Mifflin after a while,\" said Helen amusedly. \"He spent all one winter getting that kennel fixed to his liking.  You might have thought he was going to live in it instead of Bock.  All the titles that he painted in there are books that have dogs in them, and a lot of them he made up.\"  Titania insisted on getting down to peer inside.  Bock was much flattered at this attention from the new planet that had swum into his kennel.  \"Gracious!\" she said, \"here's 'The Rubaiyat of Omar Canine.' I do think that's clever!\"  \"Oh, there are a lot more,\" said Helen.  \"The works of Bonar Law, and Bohn's 'Classics,' and 'Catechisms on Dogma' and goodness knows what. If Roger paid half as much attention to business as he does to jokes of that sort, we'd be rich.  Now, you run along and have a look at the shop.\"  Titania found the bookseller at his desk.  \"Here I am, Mr. Mifflin,\" she said.  \"See, I brought a nice sharp pencil along with me to make out sales slips.  I've been practicing sticking it in my hair.  I can do it quite nicely now.  I hope you have some of those big red books with all the carbon paper in them and everything.  I've been watching the girls up at Lord and Taylor's make them out, and I think they're fascinating.  And you must teach me to run the elevator.  I'm awfully keen about elevators.\"  \"Bless me,\" said Roger, \"You'll find this very different from Lord and Taylor's!  We haven't any elevators, or any sales slips, or even a cash register.  We don't wait on customers unless they ask us to.  They come in and browse round, and if they find anything they want they come back here to my desk and ask about it.  The price is marked in every book in red pencil.  The cash-box is here on this shelf.  This is the key hanging on this little hook.  I enter each sale in this ledger.  When you sell a book you must write it down here, and the price paid for it.\"  \"But suppose it's charged?\" said Titania.  \"No charge accounts.  Everything is cash.  If someone comes in to sell books, you must refer him to me.  You mustn't be surprised to see people drop in here and spend several hours reading.  Lots of them look on this as a kind of club.  I hope you don't mind the smell of tobacco, for almost all the men that come here smoke in the shop.  You see, I put ash trays around for them.\"  \"I love tobacco smell,\" said Titania.  \"Daddy's library at home smells something like this, but not quite so strong.  And I want to see the worms, bookworms you know.  Daddy said you had lots of them.\"  \"You'll see them, all right,\" said Roger, chuckling.  \"They come in and out.  To-morrow I'll show you how my stock is arranged.  It'll take you quite a while to get familiar with it.  Until then I just want you to poke around and see what there is, until you know the shelves so well you could put your hand on any given book in the dark.  That's a game my wife and I used to play.  We would turn off all the lights at night, and I would call out the title of a book and see how near she could come to finding it.  Then I would take a turn.  When we came more than six inches away from it we would have to pay a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17203"],["title","Witchcraft and Devil Lore in the Channel Islands (#0)"],["body","AND  DEVIL LORE  IN THE  CHANNEL ISLANDS   TRANSCRIPTS FROM THE OFFICIAL RECORDS OF THE GUERNSEY ROYAL COURT, WITH AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION AND HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

The Witchcraft superstitions of the Channel Islands, sad as they were in their characteristics and results--as is abundantly evidenced by our judicial records--were but a part and parcel of that vast wave of unreasoning credulity which swept across the civilised world during the Middle Ages, and more or less affected every class of society, and all sorts and conditions of men. From the lists given in the following pages (pp. 28-32), it will be seen that in about seventy-one years, during the reigns of Elizabeth, James I. and Charles I., no fewer than seventy-eight persons--fifty-eight of them being women, and twenty of them men--were brought to trial for Sorcery in Guernsey alone. Out of these unfortunate victims, three women and one man appear to have been burnt alive; twenty-four women and four men were hanged first and burnt afterwards; one woman was hanged for returning to the island after being banished; three women and one man were whipped and had each an ear cut off; twenty-two women and five men were banished from the island; while five women and three men had the good fortune to be acquitted. Most of these accused persons were natives of Guernsey, but mention is made of one woman from Jersey, of three men and a woman from Sark, and of a man from Alderney.  With regard to the gatherings at the so-called Witches' Sabbaths, there can be no doubt that--quite apart from the question of any diabolic presence at such meetings--very questionable assemblies of people did take place at intervals among the inhabitants of many countries. Probably these gatherings first had their rise in the old pagan times, and were subsequently continued from force of habit, long after their real origin and significance had been forgotten. Now, it would be very easy for these orgies to become associated--particularly in the then superstitious condition of the popular mind--with the actual bodily presence of the Devil as one of the participants; while it is also not improbable that, in some cases at least, heartless and evil-minded persons worked upon the prevailing credulity to further their own nefarious purposes. Our esteemed Bailiff has offered a suggestion or two of considerable value on this point with regard to certain Guernsey phases of the superstition. He thinks it highly probable that some of these deluded women were actually the dupes of unprincipled and designing men, who arrayed themselves in various disguises and then met their unfortunate victims by appointment. This idea is, indeed, borne out to a great extent by some of the particulars stated in the following confessions. For instance, some of the women assert that when they met the Devil he was in the form of a dog, _but rather larger_; he always stood upon his hind legs--probably the man's feet; and, when he shook hands with them, his paw _felt like a hand_--doubtless it _was_ a hand. Another suggestion of the Bailiff's is also worth notice. It is that the black ointment so often mentioned as being rubbed on the bodies of the so-called witches, had a real existence, and may have been so compounded as to act as a narcotic or intoxicant, and produce a kind of extatic condition, just as the injection of certain drugs beneath the skin is known to do now. These suggestions are certainly worth consideration as offering reasonable solutions of at least two difficulties connected with those strange and lamentable superstitions. In one way or other there must have been some physical basis for beliefs so widely extended and so terribly real. Imagination, of course, possesses a marvellous power of modification and exaggeration, but still it requires some germs of fact around which to crystallise. And it is to the discovery of the nature of such germs that a careful and conscientious observer will naturally turn his attention.         *       *       *       *       *  While speaking of the burning of Witches in Guernsey, I may also refer for a moment to the three women who, in Queen Mary's reign suffered death by fire, for heresy, because the reason of their condemnation and punishment has caused some controversy, and is often associated in the popular mind with a charge of sorcery. Dr. Heylin in his _Survey_ (page 323), says:--       Katherine Gowches, a poor woman of St. Peter-Port, in      Guernsey, was noted to be much absent from church, and her      two daughters guilty of the same neglect. Upon this they      were presented before James Amy, then dean of the island,      who, finding in them that they held opinions contrary to      those then allowed about the sacrament of the altar,      pronounced them heretics, and condemned them to the fire.      The poor women, on the other side, pleaded for themselves,      that that doctrine had been taught them in the time of King      Edward; but if the queen was otherwise disposed, they were      content to be of her religion. This was fair but it would      not serve; for by the dean they were delivered unto Helier      Gosselin, then bailiff, and by him unto the fire, July 18,      1556. One of these daughters, Perotine Massey, she was      called, was at that time great with child; her husband, who      was a minister, having in those dangerous times fled the      island; in the middle of the flames and anguish of her      torments, her belly broke in sunder, and her child, a goodly      boy, fell down into the fire, but was presently snatched up      by "]]]
