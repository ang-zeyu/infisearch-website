A girl was standing in the doorway of one of the cabins, timidly watching the noisy herd.  \"Come, give the cows their salt,\" laughingly shouted Hansine to her.  \"And get hooked all to pieces? Not much.\"  \"You little coward. What good would you be on a _saeter_? What do you think, Hr. Bogstad?\"  As the girl caught sight of the new arrival she started and the color came to her face. He went up to her. \"How are you, Signe?\" he said. \"How do you like life on a _saeter_?\"  \"Well, I hardly know,\" she said, seemingly quite embarrassed.  \"Oh, I'll tell you,\" broke in the busy Hansine, as she came with a pail full of salt. \"She just goes around and looks at and talks about what she calls the beauties of nature. That she likes; but as for milking, or churning, or making cheese, well--\"  Then they all laughed good naturedly.  Hansine was a large, strong girl, with round, pleasant features. She and the cows were good friends. At the sound of the _lur_ every afternoon the cows turned their grazing heads towards home, and, on their arrival, each was given a pat and a handful of salt. Then they went quietly into their stalls.  It was quite late that evening before the milk had been strained into the wooden platters and placed in rows on the shelves in the milk house. Hr. Bogstad and Signe had proffered their help, but they had been ordered into the house and Signe was told to prepare the evening meal. When Hansine came in, she found the table set with the cheese, milk, butter, and black bread, while Signe and Hr. Bogstad sat by the large fireplace watching a pot of boiling cream mush.  The object of Hr. Bogstad's visit was plain enough. He had been devoting his attentions to Signe Dahl for some time, and now that he was home from college on a vacation, it was natural that he should follow her from the village up to the mountains.  Hr. Bogstad, though young, was one of the rich men of Nordal. He had lately fallen heir to a large estate. In fact, Signe's parents, with a great many more, were but tenants of young Hr. Henrik Bogstad; and although it was considered a great honor to have the attentions of such a promising young man--for, in fact, Henrik was quite exemplary in all things, and had a good name in the neighborhood--still Signe Dahl did not care for him, and was uneasy in his company. She would rather sail with some of the fisher boys on the lake than be the object of envy by her companions. But Signe's slim, graceful form, large blue eyes, clear, dimpled face, light silken hair, combined with a native grace and beauty, attracted not only the fisher boys but the \"fine\" Hr. Bogstad also. She was now spending a few days with her cousin Hansine in the mountains. Her limited knowledge of _saeter_ life was fast being augmented under her cousin's supervision, notwithstanding Hansine's remarks about her inabilities.  The cabin wherein the three were seated was of the rudest kind, but everything was scrupulously clean. The blazing pine log cast a red light over them as they sat at the table.  \"So you see nothing grand in your surroundings?\" asked Hr. Bogstad of Hansine.  \"How can I? I have never been far from home. Mountains and forests and lakes are all I know.\"  \"True,\" said he, \"and we can see grandeur and beauty by contrast only.\"  \"But here is Signe,\" remarked Hansine; \"she has never seen much of the world, yet you should hear her. I can never get her interested in my cows. Her mind must have been far away when she dished up the mush, for she has forgotten something.\"  \"Oh, I beg pardon,\" exclaimed the forgetful girl. \"Let me attend to it.\"  She went to the cupboard and brought out the sugar and a paper of ground cinnamon, and sprinkled a layer of each over the plates of mush. Then she pressed into the middle of each a lump of butter which soon melted into a tiny yellow pond.  \"I should like to hear some of these ideas of yours,\" remarked the visitor to Signe, who had so far forgotten her manners as to be blowing her spoonful of mush before dipping it into the butter.  \"I wish I were an artist,\" said she, without seeming to notice his remarks. \"Ah, what pictures I would paint! I would make them so natural that you could see the pine tops wave, and smell the breath of the woods as you looked at them.\"  \"You would put me in, standing on The Look-out blowing my _lur_, wouldn't you?\"  \"Certainly.\"  \"And I have no doubt that we could hear the echoes ringing over the hills,\" continued Hansine, soberly.  \"Never mind, you needn't make fun. Yes, Hr. Bogstad, I think we have some grand natural scenes. I often climb up on the hills, and sit and look over the pines and the shining lake down towards home. Then, sometimes, I can see the ocean like a silver ribbon, lying on the horizon. I sit up there and gaze and think, as Hansine says, nearly all night. I seem to be under a spell. You know it doesn't get dark all night now, and the air is so delicious. My thoughts go out 'Over the high mountains,' as Bjornson says, and I want to be away to hear and see what the world is and has to tell me. A kind of sweet loneliness comes over me which I cannot explain.\"  Hr. Bogstad had finished his dish. He, too, was under a spell--the spell of a soft, musical voice.  \"Then the light in the summer,\" she continued. \"How I have wished to go north where the sun shines the whole twenty-four hours. Have you ever seen the Midnight Sun, Hr. Bogstad?\"  \"No; but I have been thinking of taking a trip up there this summer, if I can get some good company to go with me. Wouldn't you--\"  It was then that Signe hurriedly pushed her chair away and said: \"Thanks for the food.\"  Next morning Signe was very busy. She washed the wooden milk basins, scalded them with juniper tea, and then scoured them with sand. She churned the butter and wanted to help with the cheese, but Hansine thought that she was not paying enough attention to their visitor, so she ordered her off to her lookout on the mountain. Hr. Bogstad would help her up the steep places; besides, he could tell her the names of the ferns and flowers, and answer the thousand and one questions which she was always asking. So, of course, they had to go.  But Signe was very quiet, and Henrik said but little. He had come to the conclusion that he truly loved this girl whose parents were among the poorest of his tenants. None other of his acquaintances, even among the higher class, charmed him as did Signe. He was old enough to marry, and she was not too young. He knew full well that if he did marry her, many of his friends would criticise; but Henrik had some of the Norseman spirit of liberty, and he did not think that a girl's humble position barred her from him. True, he had received very little encouragement from her, though her parents had looked with favor upon him. And now he was thinking of her cold indifference.  They sat down on a rocky bank, carpeted with gray reindeer moss.  They had been talking of his experiences at school. He knew her desire to finish the college education cut short by a lack of means.  \"Signe, I wish you would let me do you a favor.\"  She thought for a moment before she asked what it was.  \"Let me help you attend college. You know I am able to, besides--besides, some day you may learn to think as much of me as I do of you, and then, dear Signe--\"  Signe arose. \"Hr. Bogstad,\" she said, \"I wish you would not talk like that. If you do, I shall go back to Hansine.\"  \"Why, Signe, don't be offended. I am not jesting.\" He stood before her in the path, and would have taken her hand, but she drew back.  \"Signe, I have thought a great deal of you for a long time. You know we have been boy and girl together. My absence at school has made no difference in me. I wish you could think a little of me, Signe.\"  \"Hr. Bogstad, I don't believe in deceiving anyone. I am sorry that you have been thinking like that about me, because I cannot think of you other than as a friend. Let us not talk about it.\"  If Henrik could not talk about that nearest his heart, he would remain silent, which he did.  Signe was gathering some rare ferns and mosses when Hansine's _lur_ sounded through the hills. That was the signal for them, as well as the cows, to come home.  Early the next morning Hansine's brother came up to the _saeter_ to take home the week's accumulation of butter and cheese. Signe, perched on the top of the two-wheeled cart, was also going home. Hr. Bogstad, mounted on his horse, accompanied them a short distance, then rode off in another direction.     V.    \"Can two walk together, except they be agreed?\"--_Amos 3:3_   It was nearly noon when Signe Dahl sprang from the cart, and with her bundle under her arm, ran down the hillside into the woods, following a well-beaten trail. That was the short cut home. Hans had found her poor company during the ride, and even now, alone in the woods, the serious countenance was loth to relax. A ten minutes' walk brought her to the brow of a hill, and she sauntered down its sloping side. Signe had nearly reached home, and being doubtful of her reception there, she lingered. Then, too, she could usually amuse herself alone, for she always found some new wonder in the exhaustless beauty of her surroundings.  She threw herself on a green bank, and this is the picture which she saw: Just before her, the greensward extended down to a lake, whose waters lost themselves behind cliffs and islands and pine-clad hills. Here and there in the distance towards the north, there could be seen shining spots of water; but towards the south the hills closed in precipitously, and left room only for the outlet of the lake to pour over its rocky bed into another valley below. On the farther shore, five miles distant, a few red farm houses stood out from the plats of green--all the rest was forest and rock. The sky was filled with soft, fleecy clouds, and not a breath stirred the surface of the lake. Signe gazed towards a rocky island before her. Only the roof of the house"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17249"],["title","Added Upon (#8)"],["body","it could be seen, but from its chimney arose no smoke. That was where Signe had been born, and had lived most of the eighteen years of her life. The girl walked down the hillside to the lake and again seated herself, this time on a rock near the edge of the water. She took a book from her bundle and began to read; but the text was soon embellished with marginal sketches of rocks and bits of scenery, and then both reading and drawing had to give place to the consideration of the pictures that came thronging into her mind.  Hr. Bogstad had actually proposed to her--the rich and handsome Hr. Bogstad; and she, the insignificant farmer girl, had refused him, had run away from him. Signe Dahl, she ruminated, aren't you the most foolish child in the world? He is the owner of miles and miles of the land about here. The hills with their rich harvest of timber, the rivers with their fish, and even the island in the lake, are his. To be mistress over it all--ah, what a temptation. If she had only loved Hr. Bogstad, if she had only liked him; but she did neither. She could not explain the reason, but she knew that she could not be his wife.  How could such a man love her, anyway? Was she really so very good looking? Signe looked down into the still, deep water and saw her own reflection asking the question over again. There! her face, at least, was but a little, ordinary pink and white one. Her eyes were of the common blue color. Her hair--well, it was a trifle wavy and more glossy than that of other girls, but--gluck! a stone broke her mirror into a hundred circling waves. Signe looked up with a start. There was Hagbert standing half concealed behind a bush.  \"Oh, I see you,\" she shouted.  He came down to the water, grinning good-naturedly.  \"Well,\" said he, \"I didn't think you were so vain as all that.\"  \"Can't a person look at the pebbles and fish at at the bottom of the lake without being vain?\" and she laughed her confusion away. \"Say, Hagbert, is your boat close by?\"  \"Yes, just down by the north landing.\"  \"Oh, that's good. I thought I would have to wait until father came this evening to get home. You'll row me across, won't you?\"  \"Why, certainly; but I thought you had gone to the _saeter_ to stay, at least a week.\"  \"Yes, but--but, I've come home again, you see.\"  \"Yes, I see,\" and he looked oddly at her. He had also seen Hr. Bogstad set out for the mountains two days before, and now he wondered.  Hagbert fetched the boat, took in his passenger, and his strong arms soon sent the light craft to the other bank.  \"A thousand thanks, Hagbert,\" she said, as she sprang out, and then climbed up the steep path, and watched him pull back. He was a strong, handsome fellow, too, a poor fisherman, yet somehow, she felt easier in his company than in Hr. Bogstad's.  Signe found no one at home. Her mother and the children had, no doubt, gone to the mainland to pick blueberries; so she went out into the garden to finish her book. She became so absorbed in her reading that she did not see her mother's start of surprise when they came home with their baskets full of berries.  \"Well, well, Signe, is that you? What's the matter?\" exclaimed her mother.  \"Nothing, mother; only I couldn't stay up there any longer.\" And that was all the explanation her mother could get until the father came home that evening. He was tired and a little cross. From Hans he had heard a bit of gossip that irritated him, and Signe saw that her secret was not wholly her own. She feared her father.  \"Signe,\" said he, after supper, \"I can guess pretty well why you came home so soon. I had a talk with Hr. Bogstad before he went to the _saeter_.\"  The girl's heart beat rapidly, but she said nothing.  \"Did he speak to you about--why did you run away from him, girl?\"  \"Father, you know I don't like Hr. Bogstad. I don't know why; he is nice and all that, but I don't like him anyway.\"  \"You have such nonsensical ideas!\" exclaimed the father, and he paused before her in his impatient pacing back and forth. \"He, the gentleman, the possessor of thousands. Girl, do you know what you are doing when you act like this? Can't you see that we are poor; that your father is worked to death to provide for you all? That if you would treat him as you should, we would be lifted out of this, and could get away from this rock-ribbed island on to some land with soil on? Our future would be secure. Can't you see it, girl? O, you little fool, for running away from such a man. Don't you know he owns us all, as it were?\"  \"No, father, he does not.\"  \"The very bread you eat and the water you drink come from his possessions.\"  \"Still, he does not own us all. He does not own me, nor shall he as long as I feel as I do now, and as long as there is other land and other water and other air to which he can lay no claim.\"  It was a bold speech, but something prompted her to say it. She was aroused. The mother came to intercede, for she knew both father and daughter well.  \"I tell you, girl, there shall be no more foolishness. You shall do as I want you, do you hear!\"  Signe arose to go, but her father caught her forcibly by the arm.  \"Sit down and listen to me,\" he said.  The girl began to cry, and the mother interposed: \"Never mind, father; you know it's useless to talk to her now. Let her go and milk the cow. It's getting late.\"  So Signe escaped with her pail into the little stable where the cow had been awaiting her for over an hour. But she was a long time milking, that evening.     VI.    \"Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy   father's house, into a land that I will show thee.\"--_Gen. 12:1_.   Signe Dahl sat in the little coupe of the railroad train which was carrying her to Christiania. She was the sole occupant of the compartment, her big valise resting on the opposite seat. Out through the lowered window she looked at the flying landscape, a mingling of pine hills, waters, and green meadows. An hour ago she had boarded the train at Holmen, the nearest station to Nordal. Early that morning she had tearfully kissed them all good-by and had begun her journey to that haven of rest from old country oppressions--America. She and her mother had planned it, and the father had at last given his consent. It was all the outcome of Hr. Bogstad's persistent devotions to the family on the island in the lake.  Tiring of the scenery, Signe took from a bundle a letter. It had been handed her by the postmaster at Nordal that morning as she drove past, and was from Hr. Bogstad, who was in the North with a party of tourists. She opened it and read:  \"I wrote you a letter about a week ago, describing our trip up to that time. I hope you have received it. You know I have no eye for the beautiful, but I did the best I could. You should have been along and seen it all yourself.  \"And now I write you again, because, dear friend, I have heard a rumor from home that you are going to America. It is news to me if it is true. Dear Signe, don't. Wait, at least, until I can see you again, because I have something to tell you whether you go or stay. I am coming home as fast as steam can carry me. Please, don't run off like that. Why should you? I ask myself. But there, it's only rumor. You're not going, and I'll see you again in a few days, when I shall tell you all about the rest of the trip.\"  A smile played on Signe's face, but it soon changed to a more sober expression. What was she to cause such a commotion in the life of a man like Hr. Bogstad? That he was in earnest she knew. And here she was running away from him. He would never see her again. How disappointed he would be! She could see him driving from the station, alighting at the ferry, springing into a boat, and skimming over to the island. Up the steep bank he climbs, and little Hakon runs down to meet him, for which he receives his usual bag of candy. Perhaps he gets to the house before he finds out. Then--?  Surely the smile has changed to a tear, for Signe has wiped one away from her cheek.  To Signe, the journey that day was made up of strange thoughts and experiences. The landscape, the stopping at the stations, the coming and going of people, Hr. Bogstad's letter, the folks at home, the uncertain future,--all seemed to mingle and to form one chain of thought, which ended only when the train rolled into the glass-covered station at Christiania.  With a firm grasp on her valise, she picked her way through the crowd with its noise and bustle, and placed herself safely in the care of a hackman, who soon set her down at her lodgings.  At the steamship office she learned that the steamer was not to sail for three days. So Signe meant to see what she could of the city. It was her first visit to the capital, and perhaps her last. She would make the best of her time. She had no friends in the city, but that did not hinder her from walking out alone. In the afternoon of the second day, Signe went to the art gallery, and that was the end of her sightseeing to other parts. She lingered among the paintings of the masters and the beautiful chiseled marble--the first she had seen--until the attendant reminded her that it was time to close.  That evening the landlady informed her that a visitor had been inquiring for her during the day, a gentleman. Who could it be? He was described, and then Signe knew that it was Hr. Bogstad. He had said that he could call again in the evening.  Signe was troubled. What should she do? He was following her, but they must not meet. It would do no good. The steamer was to sail tomorrow, and she would go on board that night. She called a carriage and was driven to the wharf. Yes, it was all right, said the steward, and she was made comfortable for the night.  Among the crowd of people that came to see the steamer sail, Signe thought she caught sight of Hr. Bogstad elbowing through the throng to get to the ship. But he was too late. The third bell had rung, the gangplank was being withdrawn, and the vessel "]]]
