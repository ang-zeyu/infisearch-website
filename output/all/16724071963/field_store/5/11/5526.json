That all nations should become one in faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity of religion should cease, and differences of race be annulled—what harm is there in this?... Yet so it shall be; these fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the ‘Most Great Peace’ shall come.... Yet do We see your kings and rulers lavishing their treasures more freely on means for the destruction of the human race than on that which would conduce to the happiness of mankind.... These strifes and this bloodshed and discord must cease, and all men be as one kindred and one family.... Let not a man glory in this, that he loves his country; let him rather glory in this, that he loves his kind...._  One hundred years ago, Bahá’u’lláh, Founder of the Bahá’í Faith, proclaimed in clear and unmistakable language, to the kings and rulers of the world, to its religious leaders, and to mankind in general that the long-promised age of world peace and brotherhood had at last dawned and that He Himself was the Bearer of the new message and power from God which would transform the prevailing system of antagonism and enmity between men and create the spirit and form of the destined world order.  At that time the splendour and panoply of the monarchs reflected the vast power which they exercised, autocratically for the most part, over the greater portion of the earth. Bahá’u’lláh, an exile from His native Persia for His religious teaching, was the prisoner of the tyrannical, all-powerful Sulṭán of the Ottoman Empire. In such circumstances He addressed the rulers of the world. His Tablets to particular kings and to the Pope, although delivered, were either ignored or rejected, their wise counsels and dire warnings went unheeded, and in one instance the bearer was cruelly tortured and killed.  Bahá’u’lláh, viewing that old world and seeing it ‘at the mercy of rulers so drunk with pride that they cannot discern clearly their own best advantage’ declared that ‘...the strife that divides and afflicts the human race is daily increasing. The signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order appears to be lamentably defective.’ Although painting in sombre tones the ‘divine chastisement’ which would assail most of those rulers and engulf in ruin the peoples of the world, He nevertheless left no doubt about the outcome. ‘Soon’, He declared, ‘will the present day order be rolled up and a new one spread out in its stead.’ Since the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh in 1892, in the Holy Land, the rolling up of the old order has become the daily experience of mankind and no abatement of this process is discernible. The essence of Bahá’u’lláh’s World Order is the unity of the human race. ‘O ye children of men’, He writes, ‘the fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race...’ And He warns, ‘The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established.’ The achievement of this unity is Bahá’u’lláh’s declared mission and the aim of all Bahá’í activity. Its outline and structure are indicated in the following passage from the writings of Shoghi Effendi, great-grandson of Bahá’u’lláh and Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith:       The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bahá’u’lláh, implies     the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations,     races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and     in which the autonomy of its state members and personal freedom     and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely     and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we     can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members     will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control     the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact     such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the     needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. A     world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out     the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this     world legislature, and will safeguard the organic unity of the     whole commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver     its compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may     arise between the various elements constituting this universal     system. A mechanism of world inter-communication will be devised,     embracing the whole planet, freed from national hinderances and     restrictions, and functioning with marvellous swiftness and     perfect regularity. A world metropolis will act as the nerve     centre of a world civilization, the focus towards which the     unifying forces of life will converge and from which its     energizing influences will radiate. A"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16985"],["title","The Proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh (#1)"],["body","language will either     be invented or chosen from among the existing languages and will     be taught in the schools of all the federated nations as an     auxiliary to their mother tongue. A world script, a world     literature, a uniform and universal system of currency, of weights     and measures, will simplify and facilitate intercourse and     understanding among the nations and races of mankind. In such a     world society, science and religion, the two most potent forces in     human life, will be reconciled, will co-operate, and will     harmoniously develop. The press will, under such a system, while     giving full scope to the expression of the diversified views and     convictions of mankind, cease to be mischievously manipulated by     vested interests, whether private or public, and will be liberated     from the influence of contending governments and peoples. The     economic resources of the world will be organized, its sources of     raw materials will be tapped and fully utilized, its markets will     be co-ordinated and developed, and the distribution of its     products will be equitably regulated.      National rivalries, hatreds and intrigues will cease, and racial     animosity and prejudice will be replaced by racial amity,     understanding and co-operation. The causes of religious strife     will be permanently removed, economic barriers and restrictions     will be completely abolished, and the inordinate distinction     between classes will be obliterated. Destitution on the one hand,     and gross accumulation of ownership on the other, will disappear.     The enormous energy dissipated and wasted on war, whether economic     or political, will be consecrated to such ends as will extend the     range of human inventions and technical development, to the     increase of the productivity of mankind, to the extermination of     disease, to the extension of scientific research, to the raising     of the standard of physical health, to the sharpening and     refinement of the human brain, to the exploitation of the unused     and unsuspected resources of the planet, to the prolongation of     human life, and to the furtherance of any other agency that can     stimulate the intellectual, the moral, and spiritual life of the     entire human race.      A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and exercising     unchallengeable authority over its unimaginably vast resources,     blending and embodying the ideals of both the East and the West,     liberated from the curse of war and its miseries, and bent on the     exploitation of all the available sources of energy on the surface     of the planet, a system in which Force is made the servant of     Justice, whose life is sustained by its universal recognition of     one God and by its allegiance to one common Revelation—such is the     goal towards which humanity, impelled by the unifying forces of     life, is moving.   Bahá’u’lláh’s message is one of hope, of love, of practical reconstruction. Today we reap the appalling results of our forebears’ rejection of His divine call; but today there are new rulers, new people, who perchance may hear and avoid or mitigate the severity of impending catastrophe. It is with this hope and believing it to be its sacred duty, that the Universal House of Justice, the international governing body of the Bahá’í Faith, proclaims again, through publication of these selected passages, the essence of that mighty call of a century ago. In the same hope and belief the Bahá’ís throughout the world will do their utmost during this centenary period to bring to the attention of their fellow-men the redeeming fact of this new outpouring of divine guidance and love. We believe they will not labour in vain.  Haifa, 1967      SUMMONS TO THE KINGS AND RULERS OF THE WORLD COLLECTIVELY     “O KINGS of the earth! He Who is the sovereign...”   O KINGS of the earth! He Who is the sovereign Lord of all is come. The Kingdom is God’s, the omnipotent Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Worship none but God, and, with radiant hearts, lift up your faces unto your Lord, the Lord of all names. This is a Revelation to which whatever ye possess can never be compared, could ye but know it. We see you rejoicing in that which ye have amassed for others, and shutting out yourselves from the worlds which naught except My Guarded Tablet can reckon. The treasures ye have laid up have drawn you far away from your ultimate objective. This ill beseemeth you, could ye but understand it. Wash your hearts from all earthly defilements, and hasten to enter the Kingdom of your Lord, the Creator of earth and heaven, Who caused the world to tremble, and all its peoples to wail, except them that have renounced all things and clung to that which the Hidden Tablet hath ordained....  O Kings of the earth! The Most Great Law hath been revealed in this Spot, this Scene of transcendent splendour. Every hidden thing hath been brought to light, by virtue of the Will of the Supreme Ordainer, He Who hath ushered in the Last Hour, through Whom the Moon hath been cleft, and every irrevocable decree expounded.  Ye are but vassals, O Kings of the earth! He Who is the King of kings hath appeared, arrayed in His most wondrous glory, and is summoning you unto Himself, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Take heed lest pride deter you from recognizing the Source of Revelation; lest the things of this world shut you out as by a veil from Him Who is the Creator of heaven. Arise, and serve Him Who is the Desire of all nations, Who hath created you through a word from Him, and ordained you to be, for all time, the emblems of His sovereignty.  By the righteousness of God! It is not Our wish to lay hands on your kingdoms. Our mission is to seize and possess the hearts of men. Upon them the eyes of Bahá are fastened. To this testifieth the Kingdom of Names, could ye but comprehend it. Whoso followeth his Lord, will renounce the world and all that is therein; how much greater, then, must be the detachment of Him Who holdeth so august a station! Forsake your palaces, and haste ye to gain admittance into His Kingdom. This, indeed, will profit you both in this world and in the next. To this testifieth the Lord of the realm on high, did ye but know it.  How great is the blessedness that awaiteth the king who will arise to aid My Cause in My Kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but Me! Such a king is numbered with the companions of the Crimson Ark, the Ark which God hath prepared for the people of Bahá. All must glorify his name, must reverence his station, and aid him to unlock the cities with the keys of My Name, the omnipotent Protector of all that inhabit the visible and invisible kingdoms. Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous ornament on the brow of creation, the fountainhead of blessings unto the whole world. Offer up, O people of Bahá, your substance, nay your very lives, for his assistance.  We have asked nothing from you. For the sake of God We, verily, exhort you, and will be patient as We have been patient in that which hath befallen Us at your hands, O concourse of kings!     “O KINGS of the earth! Give ear unto the Voice of God,...”   O KINGS of the earth! Give ear unto the Voice of God, calling from this sublime, this fruit-laden Tree, that hath sprung out of the Crimson Hill, upon the holy Plain, intoning the words: ‘There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.’... Fear God, O concourse of kings, and suffer not yourselves to be deprived of this most sublime grace. Fling away, then, the things ye possess, and take fast hold on the Handle of God, the Exalted, the Great. Set your hearts towards the Face of God, and abandon that which your desires have bidden you to follow, and be not of those who perish. Relate unto them, O Servant, the story of ‘Alí (the Báb), when He came unto them with truth, bearing His glorious and weighty Book, and holding in His hands a testimony and proof from God, and holy and blessed tokens from Him. Ye, however, O Kings, have failed to heed the Remembrance of God in His days and to be guided by the lights which arose and shone forth above the horizon of a resplendent Heaven. Ye examined not His Cause when so to do would have been better for you than all that the sun shineth upon, could ye but perceive it. Ye remained careless until the divines of Persia—those cruel ones—pronounced judgment against Him, and unjustly slew Him. His spirit ascended unto God, and the eyes of the inmates of Paradise and the angels that are nigh unto Him wept sore by reason of this cruelty. Beware that ye be not careless henceforth as ye have been careless aforetime. Return, then, unto God, your Maker, and be not of the heedless.... My face hath come forth from the veils, and shed its radiance upon all that is in heaven and on earth; and yet, ye turned not towards Him, notwithstanding that ye were created for Him, O concourse of kings! Follow, therefore, that which I speak unto you, and hearken unto it with your hearts, and be not of such as have turned aside. For your glory consisteth not in your sovereignty, but rather in your nearness unto God and your observance of His command as sent down in His holy and preserved Tablets. Should any one of you rule over the whole earth, and over all that lieth within it and upon it, its seas, its lands, its mountains, and its plains, and yet be not remembered by God, all these would profit him not, could ye but know it.... Arise, then, and make steadfast your feet, and make ye amends for that which hath escaped you, and set then yourselves towards His holy Court, on the shore of His mighty Ocean, so that the pearls of knowledge and wisdom, which God hath stored up within the shell of His radiant heart, may be revealed unto you.... Beware lest ye hinder the breeze of God from blowing over your hearts, the breeze through which the hearts of such as have"]]]
