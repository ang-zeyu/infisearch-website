You're men here--or supposed to be--not a pack of weak-kneed women!... Afraid to go out and see what those lights are, are you? Well, I'm not. Look here. I'll have a bet with you boys. Fifty pounds that I get back safely, and dispel the morbid fancies from your kindergarten brains by tellin' you that the things are glow-worms, or some fool out for a practical joke on the neighbourhood--which has fallen for it like this sort of one-horse hole-in-the-corner place would! Fifty pounds? What say you?\"  He glowered round upon each of them in turn, his sneering lips showing the pointed dogs' teeth behind them, his whole arrogant personality brutally awake. \"Who'll take it on? You Merriton? Fifty pounds, man, that I don't get back safely and report to you chaps at twelve o'clock to-night.\"  Merriton's flushed face went a shade or two redder, and he took an involuntary step forward. It was only the doctor's fingers upon his coat-sleeve that restrained him. Then, too, he felt some anxiety that this drunken fool should attempt to do the very thing which another drunken fool had attempted three months back. He couldn't bet on another man's chance of life, like he would on a race-horse!  \"You'll be a fool if you go, Wynne,\" he said, as quietly as his excitement would permit. \"As my guest I ask you not to. The thing may be all rubbish--possibly is--but I'd rather you took no chances. Who it is that hides out there and kills his victims or smuggles them away I don't know, but I'd rather you didn't, old chap. And I'm not betting on a fellow's life. Have another drink man, and forget all about it.\"  Wynne took this creditable effort at reconciliation with a harsh guffaw. He crossed to Nigel and put his big, heavy hands upon the slim shoulders, bending his flushed face down so that the eyes of both were almost upon a level.  \"You little, white-livered sneak,\" he said in a deep rumbling voice that was like thunder in the still room. \"Pull yourself together and try to be a man. Take on the bet or not, whichever you like. You're savin' up for the housekeepin' I suppose. Well, take it or leave it--fifty pounds that I get back safe in this house to-night. Are you on?\"  Merriton's teeth bit into his lips until the blood came in the effort at repression. He shook Wynne's hands off his shoulders and laughed straight into the other man's sneering face.  \"Well then go--and be damned to you!\" he said fiercely. \"And blame your drunken wits if you come to grief. I've done my best to dissuade you. If you were less drunk I'd square the thing up and fight you. But I'm on, all right. Fifty pounds that you don't get back here--though I'm decent enough to hope I'll have to pay it. That satisfy you?\"  \"All right.\" Wynne straightened himself, took an unsteady step forward toward the door, and it was then that they all realized how exceedingly drunk the man was. He had come to the dinner in a state of partial intoxication, which merely made him bad-tempered, but now the spirits that he had partaken of so plentifully was burning itself into his very brain.  Doctor Bartholomew took a step toward him.  \"Dash it all!\" he said under his breath and addressing no one in particular, \"he can't go like that. Can't some of us stop him?\"  \"Try,\" put in Lester Stark sententiously, having had previous experiences of Wynne's mood, so Doctor Bartholomew did try, and got cursed for his pains. Wynne was struggling into his great, picturesque cloak, a sinister figure of unsteady gait and blood-shot eye. As he went to the hall and swung open the front door, Merriton made one last effort to stop him.  \"Don't be a fool, Wynne,\" he said anxiously. \"The game's not worth the candle. Stay where you are and I'll put you up for the night, but in Heaven's name don't venture out across the Fens now.\"  Wynne turned and showed him a reddened, congested face from which the eyes gleamed evilly. Merriton never forgot that picture of him, or the sudden tightening of the heart-strings that he experienced, the sudden sensation of foreboding that swept over him.  \"Oh--go to hell!\" Wynne said thickly. And plunged out into the darkness.     CHAPTER VI  A SHOT IN THE DARK   The church clock, some distance over Herne's Hill which lies at the back of Merriton Towers, broke the half silence that had fallen upon the little group of men in the warm smoking room with twelve sonorous, deep-throated notes. At sound of them Merriton got to his feet and stretched his hands above his head. A damper had fallen over the spirits of his guests after Wynne had gone out into the night on his foolish errand, and the fury against him that had stirred Nigel's soul was gradually wearing off.  \"Well, Wynne said twelve, didn't he?\" he remarked, with a sort of half-laugh as he surveyed the grave faces of the men who were seated in a semi-circle about him, \"and twelve it is. We'll wait another half hour, and then if he doesn't come we'll make a move for bed. He'll be playing some beastly trick upon us, you may be sure of that. What a horrible temperament the man has! He was supposed to be putting up with the Brelliers to-night--old man Brellier was decent enough to ask him--and possibly he'll simply turn in there and laugh to himself at the picture of us chaps sitting here in the mornin' and waitin' for his return!\"  Doctor Bartholomew shook his white head with a good deal of obstinacy.  \"I think you're wrong there Nigel. Wynne is a man of his word, drunk or sober. He'll come back, no doubt. Unless something has happened to him.\"  \"And this from our sceptical disbeliever, boys!\" struck in Tony West, raising his hands in mock horror. \"Nigel, m'lad, you've made an early conversion. The good doctor has a sneaking belief in the story. How now, son? What's your plan of action?\"  \"Half an hour's wait more, and then to bed,\" said Merriton, tossing back his head and setting his jaw. \"I offered Wynne a bed in the first place, but he saw fit to refuse me. If he hasn't made use of this opportunity to turn in at the Brelliers' place, I'll eat my hat. What about a round of cards, boys, till the time is up?\"  So the cards were produced, and the game began. But it was a half-hearted attempt at best, for everyone's ear was strained for the front-door bell, and everyone had an eye half-cocked toward the window. Before the half hour was up the game had fizzled out. And still Dacre Wynne did not put in an appearance.  Borkins, having been summoned, brought in some whisky and Merriton remarked casually:  \"Mr. Wynne has ventured out to try and discover the meaning of the Frozen Flames, Borkins. He'll be back some time this evening--or rather morning, I should say, for it's after midnight--and the other gentlemen and myself are going to make a move for bed. Keep your ears peeled in case you hear him. I sleep like the very old devil himself, when once I do get off.\"  Borkins, on hearing this, turned suddenly gray, and the perspiration broke out on his forehead.  \"Gone, sir? Mr. Wynne--gone--out _there_?\" he said in a stifled voice. \"Oh my Gawd, sir. It's--it's suicide, that's what it is! And Mr. Wynne's--gone!... 'E'll never come back, I swear.\"  Merriton laughed easily.  \"Well, keep your swearing to yourself, Borkins,\" he returned, \"and see that the gentlemen's rooms are ready for 'em. Doctor Bartholomew has the one next to mine, and Mr. West's is on the other side. I gave Mrs. Dredge full instructions this morning.... Good-night, Borkins, and pleasant dreams.\"  Borkins left. But his face was a dull drab shade and he was trembling like a man who has received a terrible shock.  \"There's a case of genuine scare for you,\" remarked Doctor Bartholomew quietly, drawing on his pipe. \"That man's nerves are like unstrung wires. Hardly ever seen a chap so frightened in all the course of my medical career. He's either had experience of the thing, or he knows something about it. Whichever way it is, he's the most terrified object I've ever laid eyes on!\"  Merriton broke into a laugh. But there was not much merriment in it, rather a note of uneasiness which made Tony West glance up at him sharply.  \"Best place for _you_, old chap, is your bed,\" he said, getting to his feet and laying an arm across Nigel's shoulders. \"Livin' down here does seem to play the old Harry with one's nerves. I'm as jumpy as a kitten myself. Take it from me, Wynne will return, Nigel, and when he does he'll see to it that we all hear him. He'll probably break every pane of glass in the place with a stone, and play a devil's dance upon the knocker. That's his usual way of expressin' his pleasure, I believe. Here, here's health to you, old boy, and happiness, and the best of luck.\"  That little ceremony being over, they turned in, Doctor Bartholomew, his arm linked in Nigel's going with him to his bedroom, and, in the half-dusk of the spluttering candles, they stood together at the uncurtained window and looked out in silence upon the flames, the Frozen Flames that Wynne had gone out to investigate. For quite ten minutes they stood still. Then the doctor stirred himself and broke into a little laugh.  \"Well, well,\" he said comfortably, \"whatever our friend Wynne is going to do, I don't really think we need put any credence in the story that he won't return, Nigel. So you can go to bed in comfort on that, can't you?\"  Merriton nodded. Then he yawned and shut his eyes.  \"What's that? Credence in the story? Of course not, Doctor. I'm not such a fool as I may look. Wynne's playing a game on us, and at this moment he is probably seated in Brellier's study having a laugh at the rest of us, waitin' up for him anxiously, like a lot of scared old women. Heigho! I'm tired.... You're interested in firearms, Doctor. Here's my little pet, my sleepin' companion, you understand, that has been with me through many a hot campaign.\" He leaned over and took a little revolver out of the drawer of the little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17180"],["title","The Riddle of the Frozen Flame (#7)"],["body","that stood by the bedside. The doctor, who had a remarkably fine collection of firearms, handled it with practised hands, remarked upon its good points, cocked the tiny thing, and then lifting his head looked Nigel straight in the eyes.  \"I see you keep it loaded, my boy,\" he said quietly.  Merriton laughed.  \"Yes. Habit, I suppose. One needed a loaded revolver in the jungle where every black man's hand was against you. Nice little toy, isn't it?\"  \"Yes. Looks very business-like, too.\"  \"It is. Twice now it has saved my life. I owe it a good turn.... Well,\" laying the thing down upon the top of the cabinet and turning to the doctor with a smile. \"I suppose you'll be turning in now. Pleasant dreams, old chap, and plenty of 'em. If you hear anything of Wynne--\"  \"I'll let you know,\" broke in the doctor, returning the smile affectionately. \"Good-night.\"  He turned and went out through the door to his own room, the next one along the hall.  Nigel, after hesitating a moment, strode over to the window. It was still as black as a pocket outside, for dawn was not due for some hours yet, and against the darkness the flames still danced their nightly revel. He shook his fist at them and then broke into a harsh laugh as the thought of Dacre Wynne came to him again. Dash the fellow! He was always, in some way or another, intruding upon his privacy, whether it was mental or otherwise. Then, as he looked, it seemed as though a fresh flame suddenly flashed out in the velvet darkness to the left of the others. To his excited fancy it looked bigger, brighter, _newer_! But that was impossible! The Fens were uninhabited.  He watched the light for a moment or two, and then suddenly, obsessed with a strange fear, strode across the room and picked up the tiny revolver.  \"Damn it! I'm going silly!\" he exclaimed angrily, and throwing the window open took aim, his brain on fire with the champagne and the excitement of the evening. \"Now let's see if you'll go, you infernal little devil!\"  His finger touched the trigger, the thing spoke softly--that was one of its chief attractions for Nigel--and spat forth a little jet of flame. And as it did so, his brain cleared like magic. He laughed and shook himself as though out of a trance into which he had fallen. The light was still there. What a fool he was, potting at glow-worms like a madman! He shut the window with a bang and started to undress, and then went over to the door as he heard the doctor's voice outside.  \"Thought I heard a shot, Nigel, what--?\"  \"You did. I'm a silly ass and have been potting at those beastly flames,\" returned Merriton, shamefacedly. \"For Heaven's sake, don't tell the other fellows. They'll think I've gone loony. And for a moment I believe I had. But there's no harm done.\"  \"Potting at those flames!\" The doctor's voice was almost concerned. Then he shrugged his shoulders. \"Oh, well, there's nothing in it! I must say I've taken a chance shot now and again at a bird myself from my bedroom before now. Still, get to bed, Nigel, like a good fellow, and have some sleep. Here, give me the pistol. You'll be potting at me before I know where I am. I'll take it into my room, thank you!\"  \"Right you are!\" Merriton's laugh rang more normally and the doctor nodded with pleasure. \"Good-night, Doctor.\"  \"Good-night.\"  Then the door closed again, and the house dropped once more into stillness. In ten minutes Merriton tumbled into bed. He slept like a log.... He hadn't seen the doctor drop that sleeping draught into that last whisky while Tony West kept him talking. That was why he slept.  Later on, however, his shame at his own foolishness in firing his pistol at mere flames of the night was the cause of grave difficulty. For when he related the story of the whole affair to Cleek's master mind he _left that out_! And very nearly was it his own undoing, for strange was to be the outcome of that shot in the night.     CHAPTER VII  THE WATCHER IN THE SHADOW   But if Merriton slept, the others of the little party did not. After his door had closed upon him they appeared from their rooms, and met by arrangement once more in the study. Doctor Bartholomew--a little late at having waited and listened for the outward result of his drug in Nigel's comforting snore--joined the group with an anxious face. There was no laughter now in the pleasant, heated smoking room. Every face there wore a look that bordered closely upon fear.  \"Well, Doctor,\" said Tony West, as he entered the room, \"what's the plan? I don't like Wynne's absence, I swear I don't. It--it looks fishy, somehow. And he was in no mood to play boyish pranks on us by turnin' in at the Brelliers' place. There's somethin' else afoot. What's your idea, now?\"  The doctor considered a moment.  \"Better be getting out and form a search party,\" he said quietly. \"If nothing turns up--well, Nigel needn't know we've been out. But--there's more in this than meets the eye, boys. Frankly, I don't like it. Wynne's a brute, but he never liked practical joking. It's my private opinion that he would have returned by now--if something hadn't happened to him. We'll wait till dawn, and then we'll go. Nigel is good for some hours yet. Wynne always had a bad effect on him. Ever noticed it, West? Or you, Stark?\"  The two men nodded.  \"Yes,\" said Tony, \"I have. Many times. Nigel's never the same fellow when that man's about. He's--he's got some sort of devilish influence over him, I believe. And how he hates Nigel! See his eyes to-night? He could have killed him, I believe--specially as Nigel's taken his girl.\"  \"Yes.\" The doctor's voice was rather grave. \"Wynne's a queer chap and a revengeful one. And he was as drunk as a beast to-night.... Well, boys we'll sit down and wait awhile.\"  Pipes were got out and cigarettes lighted. For an hour in the hot smoking-room the men sat, talking in undertones and smoking, or dropping off into long silences. Finally the doctor drew out his watch. He sighed as he looked at it.  \"Three o'clock, and no sign of Wynne yet. We'll be getting our things on, boys.\"  Instantly every man rose to his feet. The tension slackened with movement. In comparative silence they stole out into the hall, threw on their coats and hats, and then Tony West nervously slid the bolts of the big front door. It creaked once or twice, but no sound from the still house answered it. West swung it open, and on the whitened step they quietly put on their shoes.  The doctor switched on an electric torch and threw a blob of light upon the gravelled pathway for them to see the descent. Then one by one they went quietly down the steps, and West shut the door behind them.  \"Excellent! Excellent!\" exclaimed Doctor Bartholomew, as the gate was reached with no untoward happenings. \"Not a soul knows we're gone, boys. That's pretty certain. Now, then, out of the gate and turn to the right up that lane. It'll take us to the very edge of the Fens, I believe, and then our search will commence.\"  He spoke with assurance, and they followed him instinctively. Unconsciously they had made him captain of the expedition. But--no one had heard them, he had said? If he had looked back once when the big gate shut, he might have changed his mind upon that score. With white face pressed close against the glass of the smoking-room window, which looked directly out upon the front path, stood Borkins, watching them as though he were watching a line of ghosts on their nightly prowl.  \"Good Gawd!\" he ejaculated, as he discerned their dark figures and the light of the doctor's torch. \"Every one of 'em gone--_every one_!\" And then, trembling, he went back to bed.  But the doctor did not look back, and so the little party proceeded upon its way in comparative silence until the edge of the Fens was reached. Here, with one accord, they stopped for further instructions. Three torches made the spot upon which they stood like daylight. The doctor bent his eyes downward.  \"Now, boys,\" he said briskly. \"Keep your eyes sharp for footprints. Wynne must have struck off here into the Fens, it's the most direct course. He wouldn't have been such a duffer as to walk too far out of his way--if he was bent upon going there at all.... Hello! Here's the squelchy mark of a man's boot, and here's another!\"  They followed the track onward, with perfect ease, for the marshy ground was sodden and took every footprint deeply. That some man had crossed this way, and recently, too, was perfectly plain. The footprints wavered a little that was all, showing that the man who made them was uncertain upon his feet. And Wynne had left the house by no means sober!  \"It looks as though he had come here after all!\" broke out Tony West, excitedly. \"Why the track's as plain as the nose on your face.\"  They zig-zagged their tedious way out across the marshy grassland, their thin shoes squelching in the bogs, their trousers unmercifully spattered with the thick, treacley mud. They spoke little, their eyes bent upon the ground, their foreheads wrinkled. On and on and on they went, while the sky above them lightened and grew murky with the soft cloudiness of breaking dawn. The flames in the distance began to pale, and the vast stretch of Fen district before them was shrouded in a light fog, misty, unutterably ghostlike and with the chill lonesomeness of death.  \"Whew! Eeriest task I've ever come across!\" ejaculated Stark with a grimace as he looked up for a moment into the dull mist ahead. \"If we're not all down with pneumonia to-morrow, it won't be our own faults!... Some distance, isn't it, Doctor?\"  \"It is,\" returned the doctor grimly. \"What a fool the man was to attempt it!... Here's a footprint, and another.\"  Yes, and many another after that. They staggered on, wet, cold, uncomfortable, anxious. The doctor was a little ahead of the rest of them, Tony West came second, the others straggled a pace or two behind. Suddenly the doctor stopped and gave a hasty exclamation:  \"Good Heavens above!\"  They ran up to him "]]]
