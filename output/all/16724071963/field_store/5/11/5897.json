Umliyash lay between the Uknu and the      Tigris.  [Illustration: 050.jpg Page Image]  The language is not represented by any idioms now spoken, and its affinities with the Sumerian which some writers have attempted to establish, are too uncertain to make it safe to base any theory upon them.*       * A great part of the Susian inscriptions have been      collected by Fr. Lenormant. An attempt has been made to      identify the language in which they are written with the      Sumero-accadian, and authorities now generally agree in      considering the Arcæmenian inscriptions of the second type      as representative of its modern form. Hommel connects it      with Georgian, and includes it in a great linguistic family,      which comprises, besides these two idioms, the Hittite, the      Cappadocian, the Armenian of the Van inscriptions, and the      Cosstean. Oppert claims to have discovered on a tablet in      the British Museum a list of words belonging to one of the      idioms (probably Semitic) of Susiana, which differs alike      from the Suso-Medic and the Assyrian.  The little that we know of Elamite religion reveals to us a mysterious world, full of strange names and vague forms. Over their hierarchy there presided a deity who was called Shushinak (the Susian), Dimesh or Samesh, Dagbag, As-siga, Adaene, and possibly Khumba and Æmmân, whom the Chaldæns identified with their god Ninip; his statue was concealed in a sanctuary inaccessible to the profane, but it was dragged from thence by Assurbanipal of Nineveh in the VIIth century B.C.* This deity was associated with six others of the first rank, who were divided into two triads--Shumudu, Lagamaru, Partikira; Ammankasibar, Uduran, and Sapak: of these names, the least repellent, Ammankasibar, may possibly be the Memnon of the Greeks. The dwelling of these divinities was near Susa, in the depths of a sacred forest to which the priests and kings alone had access: their images were brought out on certain days to receive solemn homage, and were afterwards carried back to their shrine accompanied by a devout and reverent multitude. These deities received a tenth of the spoil after any successful campaign--the offerings comprising statues of the enemies gods, valuable vases, ingots of gold and silver, furniture, and stuffs. The Elamite armies were well organized, and under a skilful general became irresistible. In other respects the Elamites closely resembled the Chaldæans, pursuing the same industries and having the same agricultural and commercial instincts. In the absence of any bas-reliefs and inscriptions peculiar to this people, we may glean from the monuments of Lagash and Babylon a fair idea of the extent of their civilization in its earliest stages.       * _Shushinak_ is an adjective derived from the name of the      town of Susa. The real name of the god was probably kept      secret and rarely uttered. The names which appear by the      side of Shushinak in the text published by H. Rawlinson, as      equivalents of the Babylonian Ninip, perhaps represent      different deities; we may well ask whether the deity may not      be the Khumba, Umma, Ummân, who recurs so frequently in the      names of men and places, and who has hitherto never been met      with alone in any formula or dedicatory tablet.  The cities of the Euphrates, therefore, could have been sensible of but little change, when the chances of war transferred them from the rule of their native princes to that of an Elamite. The struggle once over, and the resulting evils repaired as far as practicable, the people of these towns resumed their usual ways, hardly conscious of the presence of their foreign ruler. The victors, for their part, became assimilated so rapidly with the vanquished, that at the close of a generation or so the conquering dynasty was regarded legitimate and national one, loyally attached to the traditions and religion of its adopted country. In the year 2285 B.C., towards the close of the reign of Nurrammân, or in the earlier part of that of Siniddinam, a King of Elam, by name Kudur-nakhunta, triumphantly marched through Chaldæa from end to end, devastating the country and sparing neither town nor temple: Uruk lost its statue of Nana, which was carried off as a trophy and placed in the sanctuary of Susa. The inhabitants long mourned the detention of their goddess, and a hymn of lamentation, probably composed for the occasion by one of their priests, kept the remembrance of the disaster fresh in their memories. Until when, oh lady, shall the impious enemy ravage the country!--In thy queen-city, Uruk, the destruction is accomplished,--in Eulbar, the temple of thy oracle, blood has flowed like water,--upon the whole of thy lands has he poured out flame, and it is spread abroad like smoke.--Oh, lady, verily it is hard for me to bend under the yoke of misfortune!--? Oh, lady, thou hast wrapped me about, thou hast plunged me, in sorrow!--The impious mighty one has broken me in pieces like a reèd,--and I know not what to resolve, I trust not in myself,--like a bed of reeds I sigh day and night!--I, thy servant, I bow myself before thee! It would appear that the whole of Chaldæa, including Babylon itself, was forced to acknowledge the supremacy of the invader;* a Susian empire thus absorbed Chaldæa, reducing its states to feudal provinces, and its princes to humble vassals. Kudur-nakhunta having departed, the people of Larsa exerted themselves to the utmost to repair the harm that he had done, and they succeeded but too well, since their very prosperity was the cause only a short time after of the outburst of another storm. Siniddinam, perhaps, desired to shake off the Elamite yoke. Simtishilkhak, one of the successors of Kudur-nakhunta, had conceded the principality of Yamutbal as a fief to Kudur-mabug, one of his sons. Kudur-mabug appears to have been a conqueror of no mean ability, for he claims, in his inscriptions, the possession of the whole of Syria.**       * The submission of Babylon is evident from the title Adda      Martu, sovereign of the West, assumed by several of the      Elamite princes (of. p. 65 of the present work): in order to      extend his authority beyond the Euphrates, it was necessary      for the King of Elam to be first of all master of Babylon.      In the early days of Assyriology it was supposed that this      period of Elamite supremacy coincided with the Median      dynasty of Berosus.       ** His preamble contains the titles _adda Martu,_ prince of      Syria; _adda lamutbal_, prince of Yamutbal. The word      _adda_ seems properly to mean lather, and the literal      translation of the full title would probably be father of      Syria, _father_ of Yamutbal, whence the secondary      meanings master, lord, prince, which have been      provisionally accepted by most Assyriologists. Tiele, and      Winckler after him, have suggested that Martu is here      equivalent to Yamutbal, and that it was merely used to      indicate the western part of Elam; Winckler afterwards      rejected this hypothesis, and has come round to the general      opinion.  He obtained a victory over Siniddinam, and having dethroned him, placed the administration of the kingdom in the hands of his own son Eimsin. This prince, who was at first a feudatory, afterwards associated in the government with his father, and finally sole monarch after the latters death, married a princess of Chaldæan blood, and by this means legitimatized his usurpation in the eyes of his subjects. His domain, which lay on both sides of the Tigris and of the Euphrates, comprised, besides the principality of Yamutbal, all the towns dependent on Sumer and Accad--Uru, Larsa, Uruk, and Nippur, He acquitted himself as a good sovereign in the sight of gods and men: he repaired the brickwork in the temple of Nannar at Uru; he embellished the temple of Shamash at Larsa, and caused two statues of copper to be cast in honour of the god; he also rebuilt Lagash and Grirsu. The city of Uruk had been left a heap of ruins after the withdrawal of Kudur-nakhunta: he set about the work of restoration, constructed a sanctuary to Papsukal, raised the ziggurât of Nana, and consecrated to the goddess an entire set of temple furniture to replace that carried off by the Elamites. He won the adhesion of the priests by piously augmenting their revenues, and throughout his reign displayed remarkable energy. Documents exist which attribute to him the reduction of Durilu, on the borders of Elam and the Chaldæan states; others contain discreet allusions to a perverse enemy who disturbed his peace in the north, and whom he successfully repulsed. He drove Sinmuballit out of Ishin, and this victory so forcibly impressed his contemporaries, that they made it the starting-point of a new semi-official era; twenty-eight years after the event, private contracts still continued to be dated by reference to the taking of Ishin. Sinmuballits son, Khammurabi, was more fortunate. Eimsin vainly appealed for help against him to his relative and suzerain Kudur-lagamar, who had succeeded Simtishilkhak at Susa. Eimsin was defeated, and disappeared from the scene of action, leaving no trace behind him, though we may infer that he took refuge in his fief of Yamutbal. The conquest by Khammurabi was by no means achieved at one blow, the enemy offering an obstinate resistance. He was forced to destroy several fortresses, the inhabitants of which had either risen against him or had refused to do him homage, among them being those of Meîr* and Malgu. When the last revolt had been put down, all the countries speaking the language of Chaldæa and sharing its civilization were finally united into a single kingdom, of which Khammurabi proclaimed himself the head. Other princes who had preceded him had enjoyed the same opportunities, but their efforts had never been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17324"],["title","History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12) (#8)"],["body","in establishing an empire of any duration; the various elements had been bound together for a moment, merely to be dispersed again after a short interval. The work of Khammurabi, on the contrary, was placed on a solid foundation, and remained unimpaired under his successors. Not only did he hold sway without a rival in the south as in the north, but the titles indicating the rights he had acquired over Sumer and Accad were inserted in his Protocol after those denoting his hereditary possessions,--the city of Bel and the four houses of the world. Khammurabis victory marks the close of those long centuries of gradual evolution during which the peoples of the Lower Euphrates passed from division to unity. Before his reign there had been as many states as cities, and as many dynasties as there were states; after him there was but one kingdom under one line of kings.       * Maîru, Meîr, has been identified with Shurippak; but it      is, rather, the town of Mar, now Tell-Id. A and Lagamal, the      Elamite Lagamar, were worshipped there. It was the seat of a      linen manufacture, and possessed large shipping.  Khammurabis long reign of fifty-five years has hitherto yielded us but a small number of monuments--seals, heads of sceptres, alabaster vases, and pompous inscriptions, scarcely any of them being of historical interest. He was famous for the number of his campaigns, no details of which, however, have come to light, but the dedication of one of his statues celebrates his good fortune on the battlefield. Bel has lent thee sovereign majesty: thou, what awaitest thou?--Sin has lent thee royalty: thou, what awaitest thou?--Ninip has lent thee his supreme weapon: thou, what awaitest thou?--The goddess of light, Ishtar, has lent thee the shock of arms and the fray: thou, what awaitest thou?--Shamash and Bamman are thy varlets: thou, what awaitest thou?--It is Khammurabi, the king, the powerful chieftain--who cuts the enemies in pieces,--the whirlwind of battle--who overthrows the country of the rebels--who stays combats, who crushes rebellions,--who destroys the stubborn like images of clay,--who overcomes the obstacles of inaccessible mountains. The majority of these expeditions were, no doubt, consequent on the victory which destroyed the power of Kimsin. It would not have sufficed merely to drive back the Elamites beyond the Tigris; it was necessary to strike a blow within their own territory to avoid a recurrence of hostilities, which might have endangered the still recent work of conquest. Here, again, Khammurabi seems to have met with his habitual success.  [Illustration: 057.jpg HEAD OF A SCEPTRE IN COPPER, BEARING THE NAME OF KHAM-MURABI]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a rapid sketch made at the      British Museum.  Ashnunak was a border district, and shared the fate of all the provinces on the eastern bank of the Tigris, being held sometimes by Elam and sometimes by Chaldæa; properly speaking, it was a country of Semitic speech, and was governed by viceroys owning allegiance, now to Babylon, now to Susa.* Khammurabi seized this province, and permanently secured its frontier by building along the river a line of fortresses surrounded by earthworks. Following the example of his predecessors, he set himself to restore and enrich the temples.       * Pognon discovered inscriptions of four of the vicegerents      of Ashnunak, which he assigns, with some hesitation, to the      time of Khammurabi, rather than to that of the kings of      Telloh. Three of these names are Semitic, the fourth      Sumerian; the language of the inscriptions bears a      resemblance to the Semitic dialect of Chaldæa.  The house of Zamama and Ninni, at Kish, was out of repair, and the ziggurât threatened to fall; he pulled it down and rebuilt it, carrying it to such a height that its summit reached the heavens. Merodach had delegated to him the government of the faithful, and had raised him to the rank of supreme ruler over the whole of Chaldæa. At Babylon, close to the great lake which served as a reservoir for the overflow of the Euphrates, the king restored the sanctuary of Esagilla, the dimensions of which did not appear to him to be proportionate to the growing importance of the city. He completed this divine dwelling with great joy and delight, he raised the summit to the firmament, and then enthroned Merodach and his spouse, Zarpanit, within it, amid great festivities. He provided for the ever-recurring requirements of the national religion by frequent gifts; the tradition has come down to us of the granary for wheat which he built at Babylon, the sight of which alone rejoiced the heart of the god. While surrounding Sippar with a great wall and a fosse, to protect its earthly inhabitants, he did not forget Shamash and Malkatu, the celestial patrons of the town. He enlarged in their honour the mysterious Ebarra, the sacred seat of their worship, and that which no king from the earliest times had known how to build for his divine master, that did he generously for Shamash his master. He restored Ezida, the eternal dwelling of Merodach, at Borsippa; Eturka-lamma, the temple of Anu, Ninni, and Nana, the suzerains of Kish; and also Ezikalamma, the house of the goddess Ninna, in the village of Zarilab. In the southern provinces, but recently added to the crown,--at Larsa, Uruk, and Uru,--he displayed similar activity.  [Illustration: 059.jpg Page Image]  He had, doubtless, a political as well as a religious motive in all he did; for if he succeeded in winning the allegiance of the priests by the prodigality of his pious gifts, he could count on their gratitude in securing for him the peoples obedience, and thus prevent the outbreak of a revolt. He had, indeed, before him a difficult task in attempting to allay the ills which had been growing during centuries of civil discord and foreign conquest. The irrigation of the country demanded constant attention, and from earliest times its sovereigns had directed the work with real solicitude; but owing to the breaking up of the country into small states, their respective resources could not be combined in such general operations as were needed for controlling the inundations and effectually remedying the excess or the scarcity of water. Khammurabi witnessed the damage done to the whole province of Umliyash by one of those terrible floods which still sometimes ravage the regions of the Lower Tigris,* and possibly it may have been to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster that he undertook the work of canalization.       * Contracts dated the year of an inundation which laid waste      Umliyash; cf. in our own time, the inundation of April 10,      1831, which in a single night destroyed half the city of      Bagdad, and in which fifteen thousand persons lost their      lives either by drowning or by the collapse of their houses.  He was the first that we know of who attempted to organize and reduce to a single system the complicated network of ditches and channels which intersected the territory belonging to the great cities between Babylon and the sea. Already, more than half a century previously, Siniddinam had enlarged the canal on which Larsa was situated, while Bimsin had provided an outlet for the River of the Gods into the Persian Gulf:* by the junction of the two a navigable channel was formed between the Euphrates and the marshes, and an outlet was thus made for the surplus waters of the inundation. Khammurabi informs us how Anu and Bel, having confided to him the government of Sumer and Accad, and having placed in his hands the reins of power, he dug the Nâr-Khammurabi, the source of wealth to the people, which brings abundance of water to the country of Sumir and Accad. I turned both its banks into cultivated ground, I heaped up mounds of grain and I furnished perpetual water for the people of Sumir and Accad. The country of Sumer and Accad, I gathered together its nations who were scattered, I gave them pasture and drink, I ruled over them in riches and abundance, I caused them to inhabit a peaceful dwelling-place. Then it was that Khammurabi, the powerful king, the favourite of the great gods, I myself, according to the prodigious strength with which Merodach had endued me, I constructed a high fortress, upon mounds of earth; its summit rises to the height of the mountains, at the head of the Nâr-Khammurabi, the source of wealth to the people. This fortress I called Dur-Sinmuballit-abim-uâlidiya, the Fortress of Sinmuballit, the father who begat me, so that the name of Sinmuballit, the father who begat me, may endure in the habitations of the world.       * Contract dated the year the Tigris, river of the gods,      was canalized down to the sea; i.e. as far as the point to      which the sea then penetrated in the environs of Kornah.  This canal of Khammurabi ran from a little south of Babylon, joining those of Siniddinam and Rimsin, and probably cutting the alluvial plain in its entire length.* It drained the stagnant marshes on either side along its course, and by its fertilising effects, the dwellers on its banks were enabled to reap full harvests from the lands which previously had been useless for purposes of cultivation. A ditch of minor importance pierced the isthmus which separates the Tigris and the Euphrates in the neighbourhood of Sippar.** Khammurabi did not rest contented with these; a system of secondary canals doubtless completed the whole scheme of irrigation which he had planned after the achievement of his conquest, and his successors had merely to keep up his work in order to ensure an unrivalled prosperity to the empire.       * Delattre is of opinion that the canal dug by Khammurabi is      the Arakhtu of later epochs which began at Babylon and      extended as far as the Larsa canal. It must therefore be      approximately identified with the Shatt-en-Nil of the      present day, which joins Shatt-el-Kaher, the canal of"]]]
