It was the most noted body of troops in the Roman army, and was called the \"Victorious Legion.\"  It remained there for upwards of three centuries.  There, too, the governor resided and administered justice.  For these reasons York got the name of \"another Rome.\"  The city had numerous temples and public buildings, such as befitted the Roman capital of Britain.  There an event occurred in the fourth century which made an indelible mark on the history of mankind. Constantine, the subsequent founder of Constantinople, was proclaimed Emperor at York, and through his influence Christianity became the established religion of the entire Roman Empire.[1]  [1] Constantine was the first Christian Emperor of Rome.  The preceding emperors had generally persecuted the Christians.  28. Roman System of Government; Roads.  During the Roman possession of Britain the country was differently governed at different periods, but eventually it was divided into five provinces.  These were intersected by a magnificent system of paved roads running in direct lines from city to city, and having London as a common center.  (See map facing p. 14.)  Over these road bodies of troops could march rapidly to any required point.  By them, and by similar roads, leading through France, Spain, and Italy, officers of state, mounted on relays of fleet horses, could pass from one end of the Empire to the other in a few days' time. (See map below, and that facing p. 14.)  So skillfully and substantially were these highways constructed, that modern engineers have been glad to adopt them as a basis for their work.  The four chief Roman roads[1] continue to be the foundation, not only of numerous turnpikes in different parts of England, but also of several of the great railway lines, especially those from London to Chester and from London to York.  [1] The four chief roads were: (1) Watling Street; (2) Icknield Street; (3) Irmin Street; and (4) The Fosse Way.  (See map facing p. 14.)  29. Roman Forts and Walls Defenses against Saxon Pirates.  Next in importance to the roads were the fortifications.  In addition to those which Agricola had built (S26), either Hadrian or Severus constructed a wall of solid masonry across the country from the shore of the North Sea to the Irish Sea.  This wall, which was about seventy-five miles south of Agricola's work, was strengthened by a deep ditch and a rampart of earth.  (See map facing p. 14.)  It was furthur defended by square stone castles built at regular intervals of one mile.  Between them were stone watchtowers, used as sentry boxes; while at every fourth mile there was a stone fort, covering several acres and occupied by a large body of troops.  But the northern tribes were not the only ones to be guarded against; bands of pirates prowled along the east and south coasts, burning, plundering, and kidnaping.  These marauders came from Denmark and the adjacent countries (S37).  The Britons and Romans called them Saxons, a most significant name if it refers to the stout sharp knives which made them a terror to every land on which they set foot.  To repel them, the Romans built a strong chain of forts along the coast, extending from the Wash on the North Sea to the Isle of Wight on the south.  (See map facing p. 14.)  The greater part of these Roman walls, fortifications, and cities have perished.  But those which remain justify the statement that \"outside of England no such monuments exist of the power and military genius of Rome.\"  30. Wherein Roman Civilization fell Short.  But this splendid fabric of Roman power signally failed to win the support of the majority of the Britons.  Civilization, like truth, cannot be forced on minds unwilling or unable to receive it.  Least of all can it be forced by the sword's point and the taskmaster's lash.  In order to render his victories on the Continent (S17) secure, Caesar butchered thousands of prisoners of war, or cut off the right hands of the entire population of large settlements to prevent them from rising in revolt.  The policy pursued in Britain, though very different, was equally heartless and equally fatal.  There were rulers who endeavored to act justly, but such cases were rare.  One of the leaders of the North Britons said, \"The Romans give the lying name of Empire to robbery and slaughter; they make a desert and call it peace.\"  31. The Mass of the Native Population Slaves; Roman Villas.  It is true that the chief cities of Britain were exempt from oppression.  They elected their own magistrates and made their own laws.  But they enjoyed this liberty because their inhabitants were either Roman soldiers or their allies, or Romanized Britons.  Outside these cities the great mass of the native Britons were bound to the soil and could not leave it, while a large proportion were absolute slaves.  Their work was in the brickyards, the quarries, the mines, or in the fields or forests.  The Roman masters of these people lived in stately villas adorned with pavements of different-colored marbles and beautifully painted walls. These country houses, often as large as palaces, were warmed in winter, like our modern dwellings, with currents of heated air.  In summer they opened on terraces ornamented with vases and statuary, and on spacious gardens of fruits and flowers.[1]  On the other hand, the laborers on these great estates lived in wretched cabins plastered with mud and thatched with straw.  [1] More than a hundred of these villas or country houses, chiefly in the south and southwest of England, have been exhumed.  Some of them cover several acres.  32. Roman Taxation and Cruelty.  But if the condition of the British servile classes was hard, many who were free were but little better off, for nearly all that they could earn was swallowed up in taxes.  The standing army of Britain, which the people of the country had to support, rarely numbered less than forty thousand.  Great numbers of Britons were forced into the ranks, but most of them appear to have been sent away to serve abroad.  Their life was one of perpetual exile.  In order to meet the civil and military expenses entailed upon him, every farmer had to pay a third of all that his farm could produce, in taxes.  Furthermore, he had to pay duty on every article that he sold, last of all, he was obliged to pay a duty or poll tax on his own head.  On the Continent there was a saying that it was better for a property owner to fall into the hands of savages than into those of the Roman assessors.  When they went round, they counted not only every ox and sheep, but every plant, and registered them as well as the owners. \"One heard nothing,\" says a writer of that time, speaking of the days when revenue was collected, \"but the sound of flogging and all kinds of torture.  The son was compelled to inform against the father, men were forced to give evidence against themselves, and were assessed according to the confession they made to escape torment.\"[1]  [1] Lactantius, cited in Elton's \"Origins of English History,\" p. 334.  It should be noted, however, that Professor C. Oman in his \"England before the Norman Conquest,\" pp. 175-176, takes a moer favorable view of the condition of Britain under the Romans than that which most authorities maintain.  So great was the misery of the land that sometimes parents destroyed their children, rather than let them grow up to a life of suffering. This vast system of organized oppression, like all tyranny, \"was not so much an institution as a destitution,\" undermining and impoverishing the country.  It lasted until time brought its revenge, and Rome, which had crushed so many nations of barbarians, was in her turn threatened with a like fate, by bands of northern barbarians stronger than herself.  33. The Romans compelled to abandon Britain, 410.  When Caesar returned from his victorious campaigns in Gaul in the first century B.C., Cicero exultantly exclaimed, \"Now let the Alps sink! the gods raised them to shelter Italy from the barbarians; they are no longer needed.\"  For nearly five centuries that continued true; then the tribes of northern Europe could no longer be held back.  When the Roman emperors saw that the crisis had arrived, they recalled their troops from Britain in 410  The rest of the Roman colonists soon followed.  At this time we find this brief but expressive entry in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" (SS46, 99): \"After this the Romans never ruled in Britain.\"  A few years later this entry occurs: \"418.  This year the Romans collected all the treasures in Britain; some they hid in the earth, so that no one since has been able to find them, and some they carried with them into Gaul.\"  34. Remains of Roman Civilization.  In the course of the next three generations the political and social elements of Roman civilization in Britain seem to have disappeared.  A few words, such as \"port\" and \"street,\" which may or may not have been derived from the Latin, have come down to us.  But there was nothing left, of which we can speak with absolute certainty, save the material shell,--the walls, roads, forts, villas, arches, gateways, altars, and tombs, whose ruins are still seen scattered throughout the land.  The soil, also, is full of relics of the same kind.  Twenty feet below the surface of the London of to-day lie the remains of the London of the Romans.  In digging in the \"City,\"[1] the laborer's shovel every now and then brings to light pieces of carved stone with Latin inscriptions, bits of rusted armor, broken swords, fragments of statuary, and gold and silver ornaments.  [1] The \"City\": This is the name given to that part of central London, about a mile square, which was formerly enclosed by Roman walls.  It contains the Bank of England, the Royal Exchange, and other very important business buildings.  Its limit on the west is the site of Temple Bar; on the east, the Tower of London.  So, likewise, several towns, long buried in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17386"],["title","The Leading Facts of English History (#5)"],["body","arth, and the foundations of upwards of a hundred country houses have been discovered; but these seem to be about all.  If Rome left any traces of her literature, law, and methods of government, they are  [TWO PAGES MISSING (21-22)]   FOURTH PERIOD[1]  \"The happy ages of history are never the productive ones.\" -- Hegel  THE COMING OF THE SAXONS, OR ENGLISH 449(?) A.D.  THE BATTLES OF THE TRIBES--BRITAIN BECOMES ENGLAND  36. The Britons beg for Help; Coming of the Jutes, 449 (?).  The Britons were in perilous condition after the Romans had left the island (S33).  They had lost their old spirit (SS2, 18).[2]  They were no longer brave in war or faithful in peace.  The Picts and Scots[3] attacked them on the northwest, and the Saxon pirates (S29) assailed them on the southeast.  These terrible foes cut down the Britons, says an old writer, as \"reapers cut down grain ready for the harvest.\"  [1] Reference Books on this Period will be found in the Classified List of Books in the Appendix.  The pronunciation of names will be found in the Index.  The Leading Dates stand unenclosed; all others are in parentheses. [2] Gildas, in Bohn's \"Six Old English Chronicles\"; but compare Professor C. Oman's \"England before the Norman Conquest,\" pp. 175-176. [3] The Picts and Scots were ancient savage tribes of Scotland.  At length the chief men wrote to the Roman consul, begging him to help them.  They entitled their piteous and pusillanimous appeal, \"The Groans of the Britons.\"  They said, \"The savages drive us to the sea, the sea casts us back upon the savages; between them we are either slaughtered or drowned.\"  But the consul was busy fighting enemies at home, and he left the groaning Britons to shift for themselves.  Finally, the courage of despair forced them to act.  They seemed to have resolved to fight fire with fire.  Acting on this resolution, they accordingly invited a band of sea rovers to come and help them against the Picts and Scots.  The chiefs of these Jutes[1] or Saxon pirates did not wait for a second invitation.  Seizing their \"rough-handled spears and bronze swords,\" they set sail for the shining chalk cliffs of Britain, 449(?).  They put an end to the ravages of the Picts and Scots.  Then instead of going back to their own country, they took possession of the best lands of Kent and refused to give them up.  (See map opposite.)  [1] The Jutes, Saxons, and Angles appear to have belonged to the same Teutonic or German race.  They inhabited the seacoast and vicinity, from the mouth of the Elbe, northward along the coast of Denmark or Jutland.  These tribes which conquered England, and settled there, remained for a long time hostile to each other, but eventually, they united and came to be known as Anglo-Saxons or English.  (See map opposite.)  37. The Saxons and Angles conquer Britain.  The success of the first band of sea robbers in Britain (S36) stimulated other bands to invade the island (477-541).  They slaughtered multitudes of Britons and made slaves of many more.  The conquerors named the parts of the country which they settled, from themselves.  Each independent settlement was hostile to every other. Thus Sussex was the home of the South Saxons, Wessex of the West Saxons, Essex of the East Saxons.  (See map opposite.)  Finally, a band of Angles came from a little corner, south of the peninsula of Denmark, which still bears the name of Angeln.  They took possession of all of eastern Britain not already appropriated.  Eventually, they came to control the greater part of the land, and from them, all the other tribes, when fused together, got the name of Angles or English (S50).  (See map opposite.)  38. Resistance made by the Britons; King Arthur.  Meanwhile the Britons had plucked up courage and made the best fight they could.  They were naturally a brave people (SS2, 18).  The fact that it took the Saxons more than a hundred years to get a firm grip on the island shows that fact.  The legend of King Arthur's exploits also illustrates the valor of the race to which he belonged. According to tradtion this British Prince, who had become a convert to Christianity (S25), met and checked the invaders in their isolent march of triumph.  The battle, it is said, was fought at Mount Badon or Badbury in Dorsetshire.  There, with his irresistable sword, \"Excalibur,\" and his stanch British spearmen, Arthur compelled his foes to acknowledge that he was not a myth but a man[1] able \"to break the heathen and uphold the Christ.\"  [1] See \"Arthur\" in the \"Dictionary of National British Biography\"; and Professor Rowley in Low and Pulling's \"Dictionary of English History,\" p. 434.  See also Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"History of the Britons\" and Tennyson's \"Idylls of the King.\"  39. The Saxons or English force the Britons to retreat.  But though King Arthur may have checked the pagan Saxon invaders, he could not drive them out of the country.  They had come to stay.  On the other hand, many Britons were forced to take refuge among the hills of Wales.  There they continued to abide.  That ancient stock never lost its love of liberty.  More than eleven centuries later their spirit helped to shape the destinies of the New World.  Thomas Jefferson andseveral of the other signers of the Declaration of American Independence were either of Welsh birth or of direct Welsh descent.  40. Gregory and the English Slaves.  The next period, of nearly eighty years, is a dreary record of constant battles and bloodshed.  Out of this very barbarism a regenerating influence finally arose.  In their greed for grain, some of the English tribes did not hesitate to sell their own children into bondage.  A number of these slaves, exposed in the market place in Rome, attracted the attention of a monk named Gregory.  Struck with the beauty of their clear, ruddy complexions and fair hair, he inquired from what country they came.  \"They are Angles\" (S37), was the dealer's answer.  \"No, not Angles, but angels,\" answered the monk; and he resolved that, when he could, he would send missionaries to convert a race of so much promise.[2]  [2] Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History.\"  41. Coming of Saint Augustine, 597.  When Gregory (S40) became Pope he fulfilled his resolution, and sent Augustine with a band of forty monks to Britain.  In 597 they landed on the very spot where the first Saxon war band had set foot on English soil nearly one hundred and fifty years before.  Like Caesar and his legions, Augustine and his monks brought with them the power of Rome.  But this time that power did not come armed with the sword to force men to submit or die, but inspired with a persuasive voice to cheer them with new hope.  41. Augustine converts the King of Kent and his People (597).  The English at that time were wholly pagan, and had, in all probability, destroyed every vesetige of the faith for which the British martyrs gave their lives (S25).  But the King of Kent had married a French princess who was a devout Christian.  Through the Queen's influence, the King was induced to receive Augustine.  He was afraid, however, of some magical practice, so he insisted that their meeting should take place in the open air and on the island of Thanet.  (See map facing p. 32.)  The historian Bede tells us that the monks, holding a tall silver cross and a picture of Christ in their hands, advanced and saluted the King.  Augustine delivered his message, was well received, and invited to Canterbury, the capital of Kent.  There the King became a convert to his preaching, and before the year had passed ten thousand of his subjects had received baptism; for to gain the King was to gain his tribe as well.  43. Augustine builds the First Monastery.  At Canterbury Augustine became the first archbishop over the first cathedral.  There, too, he established the first monastery in which to train missionaries to carry on the work which he had begun (S45). Part of the original monastery of St. Augustine is now used as a Church of England missionary college, and it continues to bear the name of the man who brought Christianity to that part of Britain.  The example of the ruler of Kent was not without its effect on others.  44. Conversion of the North.  The north of England, however, owed its conversion chiefly to the Irish monks of an earlier age.  They had planted monasteries in Ireland and Scotland from which colonies went forth, one of which settled in Durham.  Cuthbert, a Saxon monk of that monastery in the seventh century, traveled as a missionary throughout Northumbria, and was afterward recognized as the saint of the North.  Through his influence that kingdom was induced to accept Christianity.  Other missionaries went to other districts to carry the \"good tidings of great joy.\"  In one case an aged chief arose in an assembly of warriors and said: \"O king, as a bird flies through this hall in the winter night, coming out of the darkness and vanishing into it again, even such is our life.  If these strangers can tell us aught of what is beyond, let us give heed to them.\"  But, as Bede informs us in his history of the English CHurch (S99), some of the converts were too cautious to commit themselves entirely to the new religion.  One king, who had set up a large altar devoted to the worship of Christ, set up a smaller one at the other end of the hall to the old heathen deities, in order that he might make sure of the favor of both.  45. Christianity organized; Labors of the Monks.  Gradually, however, the pagan faith was dropped.  Christianity was largely organized by bands of monks and nuns, who had renounced the world in order to lead lives of self-sacrifice and service.  They bound themselves by the three vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity, and the monastic law forbade them to marry.  Monasteries existed or were now established in a number of places in England.[1]  [1] For instance, at Lindisfarne, or Holy Island, off the coast of Northumberland (see Scott's \"Marmion,\" Canto II, 9-10), "]]]
