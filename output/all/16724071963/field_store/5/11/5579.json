The channel or river, marked between Java and Australia, is evidently a concession due to the fact that a passage was known to exist. This channel, which is left white in the chart I am describing, is painted over in the specimen dated 1550 [see map pp. 68-69], as though it were blocked, and two men are represented with pick and shovel as in the act of cutting it open.  Curiously enough, in both maps, the upper silhouette of the landscape in this part defines the real south shore of Java.  On the continental part, the Australian Alps, the range of hills on the western and north-western coast, and the great sandy interior of Australia, are also roughly sketched in. Was it all guess-work?  PLACE-NAMES.  It will not be necessary, I think, to give an elaborate description of the place-names that occur on this map; those who wish to know more about them may consult my larger work on \"The Discovery of Australia.\"  We need not dwell either on those that are inscribed along the northern shores of Java, well-known to the Portuguese twenty years at least before these maps were made.  The southern shores of Java are joined to Australia, or, at least, only separated from it by a fictitious river named Rio Grande, the Great River, which follows the sleek curve of the \"pig's back\" described by D. do Couto, the Portuguese historian.  In the Portuguese sphere some of the more salient features of the coast lines bear the following names:--  _Terre ennegade._ Ennegade has no possible meaning in French.  It is a corruption of Terra Anegada which means submerged land, or land over which the high tides flow considerably. It refers to a long stretch of shore at the entrance to King Sounds, where the tides cover immense tracts of country, and which has, in consequence, been called Shoal Bay.  _Baye Bresille;_ Brazil Bay, corresponds with King Sound.  The islands on the western coast, known as Houtman's Abrolhos,* and those near Sharks' Bay, are all charted with the reefs that surround them, although they bear no names on this map.  [* _Abrolhos_ is a Portuguese word applied to reefs; literally, it means \"open your eyes.\"]  Lower down, there is a strange name, that has led to some stranger mistakes; it is LAMA, or LAME DE SYLLA, written HAME DE SILLE on another of these maps. It is a curious jumble that I have not been able to decipher; it occurs close to the mouth of the Swan River of modern charts.  Later French and Dutch map-makers took it for the name of an island in that locality.  Now, in those days, navigators and geographers were constantly in search of certain more or less fictitious islands, among which, the \"Island of Men\" and the \"Island of Women,\" had been sought for in vain.  Could this be one of the lost islands? The old-fashioned letter s, resembling an f, made _Hame de sille_ look like _Hame de fille_, and a French geographer jumped at the conclusion that the word was _fille_, and that he had found the long lost island.  He called it accordingly _I. des Filles_,* Island of Girls. The Dutch translated the name on their charts where a _Meisje Eylandt_ may be seen; but, instead of the girls that they expected to see the island peopled with, they found it overrun by beautiful creatures, it is true, but, alas! of the small wallaby kind, peculiar to the outlying islands of Western Australia.  [* See Vangondy's map of Australia (1756).]  It goes without saying that they did not know of the term _wallaby_, and taking those pretty creatures for overgrown rats, they called the island Rat Island or Rat's Nest, and Rottnest is the Dutch form thereof, preserved to this day.  Let us now turn to the eastern shores of Australia, for we need not trouble about the southern shores as they are connected with the Antarctic continent.  We notice first, _Simbana_, one of the original names of the island of Sumbawa.  You will remember that there are several islands left out in Ribero's map [see pp. 28-29]. Now the principal one between Java and Timor is Sumbawa, and, strangely enough, we find that island grafted on here, and thus forming the northernmost part of York Peninsula, with Timor to the east of it in its actual position with reference to Sumbawa and smaller islands around, although out of place with reference to Australia. We next come to _Coste Dangereuse_, Dangerous Coast. It is situated in the locality of the Great Barrier Reef, not far from the spot where, nearly three hundred years later, Lieutenant Cook, in the _Endeavour_, was almost wrecked. The name speaks for itself; it appears along a coast lined with reefs, clearly shown on this map. _Baye Perdue_, Lost Bay, a broad bay with an island in mid-channel, the modern Broad Sound and Long Island. This name suggests a double voyage, a bay that was once discovered and could not be found again.*  [* Many years ago an old cannon, supposed to be of Spanish origin, was dug out of the sand a little to the south of Broad Sound, and near Port Curtis. It may be connected with this Lost Bay.]  _R. de beaucoup d'isles_; the letter R, in Spanish, meant either river or coast. This appellation refers to the locality of the Burnett river, where the coast is lined with numerous islands. The term may, therefore, mean either \"coast of many islands,\" or \"river of many islands.\" _Coste des Herbaiges_, Coast of Pastures; it has been suggested that this name gave rise to the term Botany Bay, chosen by Sir Joseph Banks,* instead of Stingeray Bay, given by Cook. The locality, however, corresponds to a stretch of coast further north than Botany Bay.  [* It will be remembered that this chart once belonged to Sir Joseph Banks. See above.]    CHAPTER VII.  PIERRE DESCELIERS' MAP.  This is a map of the same type as the one I have just described. It forms part of another large manuscript planisphere, draughted and illuminated by Pierre Desceliers, a priest of Argues near Hâvres, and it bears in bold characters an inscription to that effect with the date 1550.  At first sight the most, remarkable feature of this map is the display of descriptive matter contained in cartouches spread here and there between the illuminations. These, however, do not refer to Australia but are descriptive of such countries as Java, Sumatra, Pegu, Malacca, Ceylon, the Andaman Islands, etc.  The only illustrations which might be supposed to appertain to Australia are those _not alluded to in the French text_, a fact which suggests that the other, extraneous matter, has been interpolated.  The illustrations, not alluded to in the French text, may, therefore, have belonged to the prototypic map, such are the representations of trees, rough guniah-looking dwellings, guanacos, and those strange, huts on the western coast, which may have been inspired by some freak of nature as seen by Dampier on the same coast some hundred and thirty odd years after these charts were painted. Dampier says: \"There were several things like haycocks standing in the Savannah, which at a distance we thought were houses, looking just like the Hottentots' houses at the Cape of Good Hope; but we found them to be so many rocks.\"  Dampier and his companions may have mistaken some anthills for rocks. Péron the French explorer describes some huge dome-shaped ant-hills seen on this coast, and Captain Pelsart, wrecked in 1629, also describes some ant-hills seen by him and his companions when in search of water on this same coast in latitude 22 degrees south.  In 1818, Allan Cunningham, when on the west coast of Australia, at the Bay of Rest, took occasion to measure one of these gigantic ant-hills of that coast. He found it to be eight feet in height, and twenty-six in girth.  Pelsart's account runs thus: \"On the 16th of June, in the morning, they returned on shore in hopes of getting more water, but were disappointed; and having no time to observe the country it gave them no great hopes of better success, even if they had travelled further within land, which appeared a thirsty, barren plain, covered with ant-hills, so high that they looked afar off like the huts of negroes...\"  Dampier in his second voyage to this coast in the year 1699, but more than one-hundred miles further south, describes again some of these evidently very remarkable features of the western coast of Australia. He says: \"Here are a great many rocks in the large savannah we were in, which are five or six feet high and round at the top like a haycock, very remarkable; some red and some white.\" But Flinders, when on this coast, actually came across native huts similar to those depicted on P. Desceliers' chart of Australia.    CHAPTER VIII.  DESLIENS' MAP.  His is another planisphere, of the same school of map-makers.  I give it here in its entirety, in order to show how the Australian portion stands, in all these maps, with reference to other countries.  It will be observed that, for accuracy, Australia compares favorably with, for instance, North America, named on this map, La Nouvelle France.  Besides its beautiful execution there is nothing to call for special notice unless it be that three Portuguese flags are shown as flying over Australian shores, a sure sign of annexation. The map-maker's name, _Nicolas Desliens_, date 1566, and Dieppe, the place where the map was made, are marked on a scroll right across the fictitious portion of Java-la-Grande.  In this short chapter, before leaving the subject of the old manuscript maps of Australia, and devoting the remaining pages of my book to actual voyages of discovery, I shall refer once more to the importance"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17022"],["title","The First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea (#6)"],["body"," the Lusitano-Spanish planispheres of the Dieppese school of cartography* because most of those documents, becoming the property of French map-makers, were used in various endeavours which were made to induce European sovereigns to colonize the Great South Land.  [*Most of these maps were made at Dieppe; all of them were made in the north of France.]  In the preceding pages I have only described the most important of these manuscript charts. The following is the list in chronological order of all the specimens known to exist:--   1. The Dauphin Chart         1530-36 2. N. Valiard's (so-called)  1539-49 3.

MENDANA AND SARMIENTO DISCOVER THE SOLOMONS.  With the hope of making fresh discoveries and in pursuance of their object to establish a trade between the Spice Islands and their newly acquired colonies on the western shores of America, the Spaniards continued to send out expeditions whenever an opportunity offered.  Ever widening their sphere of action, they now looked forward to the southern regions of the Pacific Ocean as the land of promise, the _El Dorado_ of their dreams; Saavedra's _Isla de Oro_ and Retez's and Gaspar Rico's discoveries were not to be forgotten either.  It is in those regions that the legends and traditions of the times placed the islands from which King Solomon derived the gold and other treasures that served for the decoration of the temple of Jerusalem.  These legends, founded partly on historical events, and partly coupled with traditions handed down in the Royal Incarial families of Peru, seem to have given a powerful stimulus to Spanish enterprise in the South Pacific Ocean.  The hopes they gave rise to were, in addition, strengthened by the desire to discover the Great Southern Continent in a more effectual way than had hitherto been done: these prospects originated all the expeditions which, leaving the shores of South America, followed one after another in the same wake.  The Spaniards were now firmly established in Peru and it came to pass that a certain Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, a Spanish officer of unusual erudition in maritime and other matters, having collected and translated many historical documents, or _guipus_,* relating to the Incas, became aware that one of them, their wisest and greatest monarch, named Tupac Yupanqui, had made an extensive voyage by sea towards the setting sun, which lasted over twelve months, bringing back much treasure from the countries he had visited. During the course of this voyage Tupac had discovered two large islands, named _Nina-Chumpi_ and _Hahua-Chumpi_, or _Fire-Island_ and _Outer-Island_.  * The ancient Peruvians had a curious method of keeping tally of events. They had no alphabet, and instead of writing they made use of strings of various make, colour, and length, and, with the addition of knots, more or less complicated, were able to place on record any important event.  Sarmiento believed that he had obtained valuable information from the Incas and their _guipus_ relative to these islands, which were also believed to be the outposts of a southern continent, and he thought that he could fix their position approximately.  In consequence, in the year 1567, he made a proposal for the re-discovery by the Spaniards of these distant lands. In one of his memorials to Philip II, he represented that he knew of many islands in the South Sea which were undiscovered by Europeans until his time, offering to undertake an expedition for their re-discovery with the approval of the Governor of Peru, who was then Lope Garcia de Castro.  Garcia de Castro willingly accepted Sarmiento's offer, and not only helped him in every way that lay in his power, but also offered him the sole command of the fleet. But, Sarmiento insisted that it should be entrusted to Alvaro de Mendana, a young nephew of Garcia de Castro.  This was probably a mistake on the part of Sarmiento, and was, no doubt, the cause of the failure of the expedition, and we may also attribute to his refusal of the sole command, the fact that his name has hitherto remained ignored not only in connection with this initiatory voyage, but also in connection with the further voyages of Mendana, Queiroz and Torres.  Sarmiento, however, stipulated that he should have the conduct of the discovery and navigation, and that no course should be altered without his consent.  The two ships of the expedition sailed from Callao, the port of Lima, in Peru, on the day of the feast of Santa Ysabel, the 19th of November, 1567, and Santa Ysabel became the patroness saint of the expedition.  Sarmiento intended to steer W.S.W. until he reached the tropic of Capricorn,* and this direction was kept until the 28th of November.  [* Sarmiento, and after him Torres, both endeavoured to keep in the latitude of the tropic of Capricorn. In the charts of the period a port or bay was marked on the coast of Java-Major in that latitude. See \"Baye Perdue,\" in the Lusitano-Spanish charts.]  On that day the chief pilot, Hernando Gallego, altered the course without Sarmiento's permission, and in defiance of the instructions, being supported by Mendana in so doing.  So it happened that, notwithstanding Sarmiento's protests and constant remonstrances, Gallego and Mendana, persisted in this more northerly course for forty days, evidently with the intention of making for the better known seas that surround the Caroline and Philippine Islands.  Sarmiento constantly urged that the islands and continent that he was in search of were more to the south.  However, no land being sighted after many days, Mendana became alarmed and requested Sarmiento to resume charge of the navigation.  He did so, and ordered the course to be shaped W.S.W., announcing at the same time that land would be sighted on the next day, and this proved correct.  An island was discovered which received the name of _Nombre-de-Jesus_. It has been identified with Nukufetau, in the Ellice group.  They had been sixty-two days at sea and were sadly in want of a change of diet. Seventeen days later, they sighted the small islands and rocks which they called _Baixos de la Candelaria_, Candlemas Reefs; these have been identified with Lord Howe Islands, lately ceded to England by Germany.  On the 7th of February, they reached at last a large island called Atoglu by the natives. The Spaniards gave to it the name of the patroness saint of the voyage, Santa Ysabel.  Natives came off in crescent-shaped canoes to meet them.  They found a bay on the northern coast, and having noticed the planet Venus at 10 o'clock in the morning, they called this bay the _Baya de la Estrella_, the Bay of the Star, a name which has been restored to it in recent years.  They began at once to build a brigantine which had been taken out in pieces; in fifty-four days it was put together with the help of fresh timber obtained on the island.  Sarmiento then conducted a reconnoitering expedition inland, but met with hostility from the natives.  In the meanwhile, Gallego and Ortega, the camp-master, examined the coast on board the brigantine and discovered several other islands.*  [* Very little gold, if any, was found in the Solomon group.]  An expedition in search of the Great Southern Continent, or _Java Maior_, was also projected with the brigantine, but soon abandoned, as they found the little ship unsuitable for open sea work.  All the islands discovered were supposed to belong to the outlying islands situated to the east of New Guinea, and the inference, as we know, was not, far from the truth; it led, however, to a curious mistake, which I shall explain when describing the earliest map of the Solomon Islands, towards the end of next chapter.  In May, the expedition left _Santa Ysabel_, and after sighting many more islands of the group, they cast anchor off the coast of a large island which Gallego named _Guadalcanal_, after his own native place near Seville.  On the 19th and 22nd, Sarmiento and Mendana, accompanied by Ortega, made excursions into the interior, ascending a high mountain and enjoying a magnificent panorama. Afterwards a boat's crew was massacred by the natives, and Sarmiento was obliged to make severe reprisals.  In August, the expedition removed to another island which was named _San Christobal_, where they remained for forty days, refitting and taking in supplies, and here the brigantine, which had done such good service in exploring the shallow coasts, was abandoned.  Sarmiento now desired to return by way of the islands discovered by the Inca Tupac Yupanqui, and submitted a report to that effect on September the 4th, 1568.  But Mendana insisted upon steering east, and notwithstanding the remonstrances of many, he shaped a course for New Spain.  On the 23rd of January, 1569, they reached the port of Santiago de Colima, refitted at Realejo, and returned to Callao on September 2, after an absence of 19 months.  During the voyage there had been many disagreements, and Mendana intended to bring charges against Sarmiento when he arrived at Lima.  As little justice could be expected from the uncle in adjudicating on his nephew's conduct, Sarmiento considered it to be the wisest course to leave the ship at Realejo, and wait at Guatemala until Lope Garcia de Castro should be relieved of his command.    CHAPTER X.  MENDANA IN SEARCH OF THE SOLOMON ISLANDS.  Twenty-six years had elapsed since the Sarmiento-Mendana voyage, and now Mendana was sent out again with instructions to found a colony at the island of _San Christobal_, in the Solomon Group; and from thence to make another attempt to discover the Great Southern Continent, the Java Maior, that formed such a conspicuous feature on the maps of the period, and was beginning to attract the attention of other countries besides Spain.  Mendana's fleet was composed"]]]
