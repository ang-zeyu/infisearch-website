CANON FOR EASTER DAY                                    BY                           ST. JOHN OF DAMASCUS                               ST. JOHN OF DAMASCUS   John of Damascus is by far the most prominent and most poetical of all the Greek Christian poets. He dwelt for many years in his native city of Damascus, a valiant champion of orthodoxy against all comers. His influence on Greek hymnody was immense, and he is held in high esteem by the Greek Church for his work in that department, and as a theologian. The _Octoechos_, which contains the Ferial Office, was, it is said, arranged by John of Damascus. There his Canons are found, which are perhaps his greatest work in hymnody. John retired eventually to the monastery of Mar Saba, where he spent a life of devotion, and sang those Christian hymns which have cheered and inspired so many generations of Christians in the East. There he penned the 'Golden Canon' for Easter Day, which breathes the glorious hopes of the Resurrection.                                     {Ôdê A'}                   {anastaseôs hêmera lamprynthômen laoi;}                                 {ho Heirmos}      Hail the Resurrection day!       Let the people shout for gladness;     'Tis a passover of joy,--       Let us banish every sadness;     For, from death to endless life,       Christ our God His people bringeth;     As from earth to heaven we rise,       Each his song of triumph singeth.                                 {troparion}      From our eyes the veil remove,       That we may, in light transcending,     See the risen Lord of Life,       Life to all in grace extending.     Let our ears His voice perceive;       To His accents kind attending,     We would hear 'All hail!' and sing,       Every voice in triumph blending.      Let the heavens above rejoice,       Let the earth take up the measure;     All the world, and all therein,       Join the festival of pleasure;     All things visible unite       With invisible in singing;     For the Christ is risen indeed,       Everlasting gladness bringing.                                     {Ôdê G'}                         {Deute poma piômen kainon}                                 {ho Heirmos}      Come, let us drink the water new,       Not from the rock divinely springing,     But from that pure immortal stream       That from His tomb our Lord is bringing.                                 {troparion}      All things in earth and heaven above       Are filled with light that shines supernal;     So all creation keeps this feast,       For He hath risen, the King eternal.      With Thee, O Christ, I lay entombed,       Ere light upon this day was falling;     With Thee I leave death's dark abode,       For Thou hast risen, and Thou art calling.      With Thee upon the Cross I hung       When Thou wast faint, and weak, and sighing;     Lord, with Thyself Thy servant bless,       In Thy bright realm through years undying.                                     {Ôdê D'}                          {epi tês theias phylakês}                                 {ho Heirmos}      [1]Prophet of the Lord, beside us,       Now upon the watch-tower stand;     Let us see the light-clad angel       Earthward come at God's command,     Telling of His power to save,     Who hath risen from the grave.                                 {troparion}      He was born of Virgin Mother,       Lamb of God on whom we feed;     Free from every spot, and blameless,       Yea, a Passover indeed:     Very God His wondrous claim,     And Perfection is His name.      As a yearling lamb He suffered,       He, our Blessed, saving Crown;     That He might from vileness cleanse us,       Freely was His life laid down;     Now, with beauty in our eyes,     See the glorious Sun arise.      As the ark was borne in triumph,       David leaped with gladness then;     Now before the Type's fulfilment       We should joy as holier men;     For, omnipotent to save,     Christ hath left the dismal grave.   ----------  [1]Habakkuk ii. 1.                                     {Ôdê E'}                        {orthrisômen orthroi batheos}                                 {ho Heirmos}      Ere the morn in beauty wake,       Let us seek the Saviour's tomb,--       Not with ointment and perfume,     But with songs the silence break;       We shall see the Christ appear,       Sun of Righteousness to cheer.                                 {troparion}      They who dwell in death's abode,       Bound with fetters dark and cold,       Shall the Saviour's love behold;     They shall hail the light of day,       And their gladsome foot employ       In this festival of joy.      Go ye forth amid the gloom,       And with torches burning bright       Cheer the darkness of the night,     Meet the Bridegroom at the tomb;       Greet with songs of festal glee       Him who sets His people free.                                     {Ôdê ST'}                       {katêlthes en tois katôtatois}                                 {ho Heirmos}      To depths of earth Thou didst descend,       O Christ, to break the chain     That held the sons of men enslaved,       And lead them forth again;     As Jonah left the living grave,     So cam'st Thou forth, O Christ, to save.                                 {troparion}      Unbroken were the seals when Thou       Didst leave the dismal tomb,     Even as the virgin bars remained       When Thou didst leave the womb;     And Thou hast ope'd the gates of heaven,     And entrance free to all is given.      O Thou, my Saviour and my God,       Who camest from above,     And gav'st Thyself for sinful men       An offering of love!     Now, rising from the grave, we see     Our human race arise with Thee.                                     {Ôdê Z'}                      {ho paidas ek kaminou rhysamenos}                                 {ho Heirmos}      He who in the fiery furnace       Kept from harm the faithful three,     Suffering in our mortal nature,       Decks with life mortality,--     Him, our fathers' God, we praise,     Blest and glorious always.                                 {troparion}      Holy women bearing ointments,       Sought the mortal, bathed in tears;     But their sorrow changed to gladness,       For the Living God appears;     And they tell the news abroad     Of the risen Son of God.      Now we celebrate the triumph,       Death and Hades overthrown,     Earnest of a life unending;       All the glory is Thine own;     God, our fathers' God, we praise,     Blest and glorious always.      Hallowed feast of holy gladness!       Night that waits salvation's birth,     Till the Resurrection morning       Breaks with splendour on the earth,     And eternal light is poured     By the Christ from death restored.                                     {Ôdê Ê'}                      {hautê hê klêtê kai hagia hêmera}                "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27848"],["title","Hymns of the Greek Church (#5)"],["body","                 {ho Heirmos}      This is the chosen day of God,       The brightest and the fairest,     The Lady thou of all the feasts,       The Queen of all, and rarest;     Now let our songs of blessing soar     To Thee, O Christ, for evermore.                                 {troparion}      O glorious Resurrection day!

O Christ, our sacred Paschal feast,       The Word, the might of God,--     His wisdom most ineffable       By Thee is shed abroad;     O may we feast on Thee for aye     In Thy blest realm of endless day.                                    _COLLECTS_                  THE ECTENE AND THE LITANY OF THE DEACON   These Collects hold a most important place in the services of the Eastern Church. There are few offices in which they are not found imbedded. Their catholicity is most remarkable. The suffrages are peculiar to no church service, but common to all liturgies. The people share in them by responding 'Lord have mercy' at the end of each petition, and 'Amen' at the close.                                     {EKTENÊ}                                    OR                               GREAT COLLECT    {Hyper tês anôthen eirênês, kai tês sôtêrias tôn psychôn hêmôn, tou                             Kyriou deêthômen}                                       I      Lord, to our humble prayers attend,     Let Thou Thy peace from heaven descend,     And to our souls salvation send.

METHODIUS   Methodius, a prominent name in Ecclesiastical history, and a Father of the Church, was born about the middle of the third century. He was first of all Bishop of Olympus in Lycia, and, according to Jerome, became ultimately Bishop of Tyre. He combated certain views of Origen, but would seem to have been influenced not a little by the teaching of that great theologian.  In his principal work, _The Banquet of the Ten Virgins_, the hymn is found from which the following is a cento. It contains twenty-four strophes, each beginning with a letter of the Greek alphabet in alphabetical order, and ending with the same refrain.  Methodius is said to have suffered martyrdom under Diocletian about 311 A.D.                   {anôthen, parthenoi, boês egersinekros êchos}                                       I      Behold the Bridegroom!

In holy garb, with lamp aglow,         To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.                                    ST. GREGORY                                    ST. GREGORY   Gregory of Nazianzus, son of Gregory, Bishop of Nazianzus, and life-long friend of Basil, Bishop of Caesarea, was born at Nazianzus, 325 A.D. He took up the priestly office at the earnest request of his father, and for some time was helpful to the aged bishop.  The times in which Gregory lived were trying times. The orthodox Christians clung to the creed of Nicea, and their champions did valiant battle with the Arians. As an advocate and exponent of evangelical truth, Gregory was summoned to Constantinople in 379, and as bishop of that See adorned the high position with gifts and graces as brilliant as they were rare. But he was not the man for such a position at such a time. Hilary, the 'Hammer of the Arians,' could keep the heretics at bay, and do in the Latin Church what Gregory could not do in the Greek Church--maintain his position and his cause against all comers. For one thing, the retiring disposition of Gregory inclined him to shrink from the din of conflict, and his high ideals weakened his hopefulness. The result was that he abandoned his position and retired to Nazianzus in 381. Deprived by death of his life-long friend, and of his brother Caesarius, to whom he was bound by more than brotherly love, he retired from the world and penned those poems, some of which are among the treasures of the Church Catholic. He died in 390.  The hymns of Gregory are found in the second volume of the Benedictine Edition of his works which was published in Paris in 1842. A selection can be seen in Daniel's _Thesaurus_, and in the _Anthologica Graeca, Carminum Christianorum_.                             {ater archês, aperanton}                   Cento from {se ton aphthiton monarchên}                            "]]]
