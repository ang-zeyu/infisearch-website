Bid me not think of aught beyond these prison-walls, which so grimly confine me; let me again love, or, at least, submit to my slavery and my obscurity.”  “Monseigneur, monseigneur; if you again utter these desperate words--if, after having received proof of your high birth, you still remain poor-spirited in body and soul, I will comply with your desire, I will depart, and renounce forever the service of a master, to whom so eagerly I came to devote my assistance and my life!”  “Monsieur,” cried the prince, “would it not have been better for you to have reflected, before telling me all that you have done, that you have broken my heart forever?”  “And so I desire to do, monseigneur.”  “To talk to me about power, grandeur, eye, and to prate of thrones! Is a prison the fit place? You wish to make me believe in splendor, and we are lying lost in night; you boast of glory, and we are smothering our words in the curtains of this miserable bed; you give me glimpses of power absolute whilst I hear the footsteps of the every-watchful jailer in the corridor--that step which, after all, makes you tremble more than it does me. To render me somewhat less incredulous, free me from the Bastile; let me breathe the fresh air; give me my spurs and trusty sword, then we shall begin to understand each other.”  “It is precisely my intention to give you all this, monseigneur, and more; only, do you desire it?”  “A word more,” said the prince. “I know there are guards in every gallery, bolts to every door, cannon and soldiery at every barrier. How will you overcome the sentries--spike the guns? How will you break through the bolts and bars?”  “Monseigneur,--how did you get the note which announced my arrival to you?”  “You can bribe a jailer for such a thing as a note.”  “If we can corrupt one turnkey, we can corrupt ten.”  “Well; I admit that it may be possible to release a poor captive from the Bastile; possible so to conceal him that the king’s people shall not again ensnare him; possible, in some unknown retreat, to sustain the unhappy wretch in some suitable manner.”  “Monseigneur!” said Aramis, smiling.  “I admit that, whoever would do this much for me, would seem more than mortal in my eyes; but as you tell me I am a prince, brother of the king, how can you restore me the rank and power which my mother and my brother have deprived me of? And as, to effect this, I must pass a life of war and hatred, how can you cause me to prevail in those combats--render me invulnerable by my enemies? Ah! monsieur, reflect on all this; place me, to-morrow, in some dark cavern at a mountain’s base; yield me the delight of hearing in freedom sounds of the river, plain and valley, of beholding in freedom the sun of the blue heavens, or the stormy sky, and it is enough. Promise me no more than this, for, indeed, more you cannot give, and it would be a crime to deceive me, since you call yourself my friend.”  Aramis waited in silence. “Monseigneur,” he resumed, after a moment’s reflection, “I admire the firm, sound sense which dictates your words; I am happy to have discovered my monarch’s mind.”  “Again, again! oh, God! for mercy’s sake,” cried the prince, pressing his icy hands upon his clammy brow, “do not play with me! I have no need to be a king to be the happiest of men.”  “But I, monseigneur, wish you to be a king for the good of humanity.”  “Ah!” said the prince, with fresh distrust inspired by the word; “ah! with what, then, has humanity to reproach my brother?”  “I forgot to say, monseigneur, that if you would allow me to guide you, and if you consent to become the most powerful monarch in Christendom, you will have promoted the interests of all the friends whom I devote to the success of your cause, and these friends are numerous.”  “Numerous?”  “Less numerous than powerful, monseigneur.”  “Explain yourself.”  “It is impossible; I will explain, I swear before Heaven, on that day that I see you sitting on the throne of France.”  “But my brother?”  “You shall decree his fate. Do you pity him?”  “Him, who leaves me to perish in a dungeon? No, no. For him I have no pity!”  “So much the better.”  “He might have himself come to this prison, have taken me by the hand, and have said, ‘My brother, Heaven created us to love, not to contend with one another. I come to you. A barbarous prejudice has condemned you to pass your days in obscurity, far from mankind, deprived of every joy. I will make you sit down beside me; I will buckle round your waist our father’s sword. Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put down or restrain me? Will you employ that sword to spill my blood?’ ‘Oh! never,’ I would have replied to him, ‘I look on you as my preserver, I will respect you as my master. You give me far more than Heaven bestowed; for through you I possess liberty and the privilege of loving and being loved in this world.’”  “And you would have kept your word, monseigneur?”  “On my life! While now--now that I have guilty ones to punish--”  “In what manner, monseigneur?”  “What do you say as to the resemblance that Heaven has given me to my brother?”  “I say that there was in that likeness a providential instruction which the king ought to have heeded; I say that your mother committed a crime in rendering those different in happiness and fortune whom nature created so startlingly alike, of her own flesh, and I conclude that the object of punishment should be only to restore the equilibrium.”  “By which you mean--”  “That if I restore you to your place on your brother’s throne, he shall take yours in prison.”  “Alas! there’s such infinity of suffering in prison, especially it would be so for one who has drunk so deeply of the cup of enjoyment.”  “Your royal highness will always be free to act as you may desire; and if it seems good to you, after punishment, you will have it in your power to pardon.”  “Good. And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?”  “Tell me, my prince.”  “It is that I will hear nothing further from you till I am clear of the Bastile.”  “I was going to say to your highness that I should only have the pleasure of seeing you once again.”  “And when?”  “The day when my prince leaves these gloomy walls.”  “Heavens! how will you give me notice of it?”  “By myself coming to fetch you.”  “Yourself?”  “My prince, do not leave this chamber save with me, or if in my absence you are compelled to do so, remember that I am not concerned in it.”  “And so I am not to speak a word of this to any one whatever, save to you?”  “Save only to me.” Aramis bowed very low. The prince offered his hand.  “Monsieur,” he said, in a tone that issued from his heart, “one word more, my last. If you have sought me for my destruction; if you are only a tool in the hands of my enemies; if from our conference, in which you have sounded the depths of my mind, anything worse than captivity result, that is to say, if death befall me, still receive my blessing, for you will have ended my troubles and given me repose from the tormenting fever that has preyed on me for eight long, weary years.”  “Monseigneur, wait the results ere you judge me,” said Aramis.  “I say that, in such a case, I bless and forgive you. If, on the other hand, you are come to restore me to that position in the sunshine of fortune and glory to which I was destined by Heaven; if by your means I am enabled to live in the memory of man, and confer luster on my race by deeds of valor, or by solid benefits bestowed upon my people; if, from my present depths of sorrow, aided by your generous hand, I raise myself to the very height of honor, then to you, whom I thank with blessings, to you will I offer half my power and my glory: though you would still be but partly recompensed, and your share must always remain incomplete, since I could not divide with you the happiness received at your hands.”  “Monseigneur,” replied Aramis, moved by the pallor and excitement of the young man, “the nobleness of your heart fills me with joy and admiration. It is not you who will have to thank me, but rather the nation whom you will render happy, the posterity whose name you will make glorious. Yes; I shall indeed have bestowed upon you more than life, I shall have given you immortality.”  The prince offered his hand to Aramis, who sank upon his knee and kissed it.  “It is the first act of homage paid to our future king,” said he. “When I see you again, I shall say, ‘Good day, sire.’”  “Till then,” said the young man, pressing his wan and wasted fingers over his heart,--“till then, no more dreams, no more strain on my life--my heart would break! Oh, monsieur, how small is my prison--how low the window--how narrow are the doors! To think that so much pride, splendor, and happiness, should be able to enter in and to remain here!”  “Your royal highness makes me proud,” said Aramis, “since you infer it is I who brought all this.” And he rapped immediately on the door. The jailer came to open it with Baisemeaux, who, devoured by fear and uneasiness, was beginning, in spite of himself, to listen at the door. Happily, neither of the speakers had forgotten to smother his voice, even in the most passionate outbreaks.  “What a confessor!” said the governor, forcing a laugh; “who would believe that a compulsory recluse, a man as though in the very jaws of death, could have committed crimes so numerous, and so long to tell of?”  Aramis made no reply. He was eager to leave the Bastile, where the secret which overwhelmed him seemed to double the weight of the walls. As soon as they reached Baisemeaux’s quarters, “Let us proceed to business, my dear governor,” said Aramis.  “Alas!” replied Baisemeaux.  “You have to ask me for my receipt for one hundred and fifty thousand livres,” said the bishop.  “And to pay over the first third of the sum,” added the poor governor, with a sigh, taking three steps towards his iron strong-box.  “Here is the receipt,” said Aramis.  “And here is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759"],["title","The Man in the Iron Mask (#7)"],["body"," money,” returned Baisemeaux, with a threefold sigh.  “The order instructed me only to give a receipt; it said nothing about receiving the money,” rejoined Aramis. “Adieu, monsieur le governeur!”  And he departed, leaving Baisemeaux almost more than stifled with joy and surprise at this regal present so liberally bestowed by the confessor extraordinary to the Bastile.    Chapter II. How Mouston Had Become Fatter without Giving Porthos Notice Thereof, and of the Troubles Which Consequently Befell that Worthy Gentleman.  Since the departure of Athos for Blois, Porthos and D’Artagnan were seldom together. One was occupied with harassing duties for the king, the other had been making many purchases of furniture which he intended to forward to his estate, and by aid of which he hoped to establish in his various residences something of the courtly luxury he had witnessed in all its dazzling brightness in his majesty’s society. D’Artagnan, ever faithful, one morning during an interval of service thought about Porthos, and being uneasy at not having heard anything of him for a fortnight, directed his steps towards his hotel, and pounced upon him just as he was getting up. The worthy baron had a pensive--nay, more than pensive--melancholy air. He was sitting on his bed, only half-dressed, and with legs dangling over the edge, contemplating a host of garments, which with their fringes, lace, embroidery, and slashes of ill-assorted hues, were strewed all over the floor. Porthos, sad and reflective as La Fontaine’s hare, did not observe D’Artagnan’s entrance, which was, moreover, screened at this moment by M. Mouston, whose personal corpulency, quite enough at any time to hide one man from another, was effectually doubled by a scarlet coat which the intendant was holding up for his master’s inspection, by the sleeves, that he might the better see it all over. D’Artagnan stopped at the threshold and looked in at the pensive Porthos and then, as the sight of the innumerable garments strewing the floor caused mighty sighs to heave the bosom of that excellent gentleman, D’Artagnan thought it time to put an end to these dismal reflections, and coughed by way of announcing himself.  “Ah!” exclaimed Porthos, whose countenance brightened with joy; “ah! ah! Here is D’Artagnan. I shall then get hold of an idea!”  At these words Mouston, doubting what was going on behind him, got out of the way, smiling kindly at the friend of his master, who thus found himself freed from the material obstacle which had prevented his reaching D’Artagnan. Porthos made his sturdy knees crack again in rising, and crossing the room in two strides, found himself face to face with his friend, whom he folded to his breast with a force of affection that seemed to increase with every day. “Ah!” he repeated, “you are always welcome, dear friend; but just now you are more welcome than ever.”  “But you seem to have the megrims here!” exclaimed D’Artagnan.  Porthos replied by a look expressive of dejection. “Well, then, tell me all about it, Porthos, my friend, unless it is a secret.”  “In the first place,” returned Porthos, “you know I have no secrets from you. This, then, is what saddens me.”  “Wait a minute, Porthos; let me first get rid of all this litter of satin and velvet!”  “Oh, never mind,” said Porthos, contemptuously; “it is all trash.”  “Trash, Porthos! Cloth at twenty-five livres an ell! gorgeous satin! regal velvet!”  “Then you think these clothes are--”  “Splendid, Porthos, splendid! I’ll wager that you alone in France have so many; and suppose you never had any more made, and were to live to be a hundred years of age, which wouldn’t astonish me in the very least, you could still wear a new dress the day of your death, without being obliged to see the nose of a single tailor from now till then.”  Porthos shook his head.  “Come, my friend,” said D’Artagnan, “this unnatural melancholy in you frightens me. My dear Porthos, pray get it out, then. And the sooner the better.”  “Yes, my friend, so I will: if, indeed, it is possible.”  “Perhaps you have received bad news from Bracieux?”  “No: they have felled the wood, and it has yielded a third more than the estimate.”  “Then there has been a falling-off in the pools of Pierrefonds?”  “No, my friend: they have been fished, and there is enough left to stock all the pools in the neighborhood.”  “Perhaps your estate at Vallon has been destroyed by an earthquake?”  “No, my friend; on the contrary, the ground was struck with lightning a hundred paces from the chateau, and a fountain sprung up in a place entirely destitute of water.”  “What in the world _is_ the matter, then?”  “The fact is, I have received an invitation for the _fete_ at Vaux,”  said Porthos, with a lugubrious expression.  “Well! do you complain of that? The king has caused a hundred mortal heart-burnings among the courtiers by refusing invitations. And so, my dear friend, you are really going to Vaux?”  “Indeed I am!”  “You will see a magnificent sight.”  “Alas! I doubt it, though.”  “Everything that is grand in France will be brought together there!”  “Ah!” cried Porthos, tearing out a lock of hair in his despair.  “Eh! good heavens, are you ill?” cried D’Artagnan.  “I am as firm as the Pont-Neuf! It isn’t that.”  “But what is it, then?”  “‘Tis that I have no clothes!”  D’Artagnan stood petrified. “No clothes! Porthos, no clothes!” he cried, “when I see at least fifty suits on the floor.”  “Fifty, truly; but not one which fits me!”  “What? not one that fits you? But are you not measured, then, when you give an order?”  “To be sure he is,” answered Mouston; “but unfortunately _I_ have gotten stouter!”  “What! _you_ stouter!”  “So much so that I am now bigger than the baron. Would you believe it, monsieur?”  “_Parbleu!_ it seems to me that is quite evident.”  “Do you see, stupid?” said Porthos, “that is quite evident!”  “Be still, my dear Porthos,” resumed D’Artagnan, becoming slightly impatient, “I don’t understand why your clothes should not fit you, because Mouston has grown stouter.”  “I am going to explain it,” said Porthos. “You remember having related to me the story of the Roman general Antony, who had always seven wild boars kept roasting, each cooked up to a different point; so that he might be able to have his dinner at any time of the day he chose to ask for it. Well, then, I resolved, as at any time I might be invited to court to spend a week, I resolved to have always seven suits ready for the occasion.”  “Capitally reasoned, Porthos--only a man must have a fortune like yours to gratify such whims. Without counting the time lost in being measured, the fashions are always changing.”  “That is exactly the point,” said Porthos, “in regard to which I flattered myself I had hit on a very ingenious device.”  “Tell me what it is; for I don’t doubt your genius.”  “You remember what Mouston once was, then?”  “Yes; when he used to call himself Mousqueton.”  “And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?”  “No, not exactly. I beg your pardon, my good Mouston.”  “Oh! you are not in fault, monsieur,” said Mouston, graciously. “You were in Paris, and as for us, we were at Pierrefonds.”  “Well, well, my dear Porthos; there was a time when Mouston began to grow fat. Is that what you wished to say?”  “Yes, my friend; and I greatly rejoice over the period.”  “Indeed, I believe you do,” exclaimed D’Artagnan.  “You understand,” continued Porthos, “what a world of trouble it spared for me.”  “No, I don’t--by any means.”  “Look here, my friend. In the first place, as you have said, to be measured is a loss of time, even though it occur only once a fortnight. And then, one may be travelling; and then you wish to have seven suits always with you. In short, I have a horror of letting any one take my measure. Confound it! either one is a nobleman or not. To be scrutinized and scanned by a fellow who completely analyzes you, by inch and line--‘tis degrading! Here, they find you too hollow; there, too prominent. They recognize your strong and weak points. See, now, when we leave the measurer’s hands, we are like those strongholds whose angles and different thicknesses have been ascertained by a spy.”  “In truth, my dear Porthos, you possess ideas entirely original.”  “Ah! you see when a man is an engineer--”  “And has fortified Belle-Isle--‘tis natural, my friend.”  “Well, I had an idea, which would doubtless have proved a good one, but for Mouston’s carelessness.”  D’Artagnan glanced at Mouston, who replied by a slight movement of his body, as if to say, “You will see whether I am at all to blame in all this.”  “I congratulated myself, then,” resumed Porthos, “at seeing Mouston get fat; and I did all I could, by means of substantial feeding, to make him stout--always in the hope that he would come to equal myself in girth, and could then be measured in my stead.”  “Ah!” cried D’Artagnan. “I see--that spared you both time and humiliation.”  “Consider my joy when, after a year and a half’s judicious feeding--for I used to feed him up myself--the fellow--”  “Oh! I lent a good hand myself, monsieur,” said Mouston, humbly.  “That’s true. Consider my joy when, one morning, I perceived Mouston was obliged to squeeze in, as I once did myself, to get through the little secret door that those fools of architects had made in the chamber of the late Madame du Vallon, in the chateau of Pierrefonds. And, by the way, about that door, my friend, I should like to ask you, who know everything, why these wretches of architects, who ought to have the compasses run into them, just to remind them, came to make doorways through which nobody but thin people can pass?”  “Oh, those doors,” answered D’Artagnan, “were meant for gallants, and they have generally slight and slender figures.”  “Madame du Vallon had no gallant!” answered Porthos, majestically.  “Perfectly true, my friend,” resumed D’Artagnan; “but the architects were probably making their"]]]
