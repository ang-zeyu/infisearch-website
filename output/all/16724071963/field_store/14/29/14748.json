The horse was Arend's, but there was not the slightest trace of the rider.  Whatever had been his fate, there was no sign of his having been killed along with his horse.  There was still a hope that he had made his escape, though the finding of the horse only added to their apprehensions.  \"Let us find out,\" counselled Hendrik, \"whether the horse was killed where it is now lying, or whether it has been dragged hither by the lion.\"  After examining the ground, Congo declared that the horse had been killed upon the spot, and by the lion.  This was strange enough.  On a further examination of the sign, it was found that one of the horse's legs was entangled in the rein of the bridle.  This explained the circumstance to some extent, otherwise it would have been difficult to understand how so swift an animal as a horse should have allowed itself to be overtaken upon an open plain.  \"So much the better,\" said Groot Willem.  \"Arend never reached this place along with his horse.\"  \"That's true,\" answered Hendrik, \"and our next move will be to find out where he parted from his saddle.\"  \"Let us go back,\" said Willem, \"and more carefully examine the tracks.\"  During this conversation, the hunters had reloaded their rifles, and now remounted for the purpose of riding back.  \"Baas Willem,\" suggested Congo, \"let Spoor'em try 'bout here little more.\"  This suggestion was adopted, and Congo, setting on the hound, proceeded to describe a larger circle around the spot.  After reaching a part of the plain where they had not yet been, the Kaffir called out to them to come to him.  They rode up, and were again shown the spoor of Arend's horse leading away from where its carcass was now lying, and in the opposite direction from the camp.  It was evident that the horse had been farther off than the spot where its remains now rested.  It had probably lost its rider beyond, and was on its return to the camp when killed by the lion.  Once more Spoor'em started along the track, Congo keeping close to his tail, the two horsemen riding anxiously after.  But we must return to the camp, and follow the trail of the lost hunter by a means more sure than even the keen scent of Spoor'em.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  THE LOST HUNTER.  As Arend came up to the horse that had wandered from the camp, the animal had arrived at the edge of an extensive thicket, and was apparently determined upon straying still farther.  To avoid being caught or driven back, it rushed in among trees, taking a path or trace made by wild animals.  Arend followed.  The path was too narrow to allow of his heading the stray; and, apprehensive of losing it altogether, the youth followed on in hopes of coming to a wider track, where he might have a chance of passing the runaway and turning it towards the camp.  This hope seemed about to be realised, as the truant emerged from the thicket and entered upon an open plain clothed with low heath,--the _Erica vestila_, loaded with white blossoms.  The hunter was no longer obliged to follow upon the heels of the runaway,--the horse; and spurring his own steed, he made an attempt to get past it.  But the horse, perhaps inspired by a recollection of the pack-saddle and its heavy load, broke off into a gallop.  Arend followed, increasing his own speed in like proportion.  When nearly across the plain, the runaway suddenly stopped and then bolted off at right angles to the course it had been hitherto pursuing.  Arend was astonished, but soon discovered the cause of this eccentric action, in the presence of a huge black rhinoceros,--the borele--which was making a straight course across the plain, as if on its way to the river.  The runaway horse had shied out of its way; and it would have been well for the horseman if he had shown himself equally discreet.  But Arend Von Wyk was a hunter,--and an officer of the Cape Militia,--and as the borele passed by him, presenting a fine opportunity for a shot, he could not resist the temptation to give it one.  Pulling up his horse, or rather trying to do so, for the animal was restive in the presence of such danger, he fired.  The shot produced a result that was neither expected nor desired.  With a roar like the bellowing of an angry bull, the monster turned and charged straight towards the horseman.  Arend was obliged to seek safety in flight, while the borele pursued in a manner that told of its being wounded, but not incapacitated from seeking revenge.  At the commencement of the chase, there was but a very short distance between pursuer and pursued; and in place of suddenly turning out of the track, and allowing the monster to pass by him,--which he should have done, knowing the defect of vision natural to the rhinoceros,--the young hunter continued on in a straight line, all the while employed in reloading his rifle.  His mistake did not originate in any want of knowledge, or presence of mind, but rather from carelessness and an unworthy estimate of the abilities of the borele to overtake him.  He had long been a successful hunter, and success too often begets that over-confidence which leads to many a mischance, that the more cautious sportsman will avoid.  Suddenly he found his flight arrested by the thick scrub of thorny bushes, known in South Africa as the \"wait a bits\", and the horse he was riding did wait a bit,--and so long that the borele was soon close upon his heels.  There was now neither time nor room to turn either to the right or left.  The rifle was at length loaded, but there would have been but little chance of killing the rhinoceros by a single shot, especially with such uncertain aim as could have been taken from the back of a frightened horse.  Arend, therefore, threw himself from the saddle.  He had a twofold purpose in doing so.  His aim would be more correct, and there was the chance of the borele keeping on after the horse, and leaving him an undisturbed spectator of the chase.  The field of view embraced by the eyes of a rhinoceros is not large; but, unfortunately for the hunter, as the frightened horse fled from his side, it was he himself that came within the circumscribed circle of the borele's vision.  Hastily raising the rifle to his shoulder he fired at the advancing enemy, and then fled towards a clump of trees that chanced to be near by.  He could hear the heavy tread of the rhinoceros as it followed close upon his heels.  It seemed to shake the earth.  Closer and closer he heard it, so near that he dared not stop to look around.  He fancied he could feel the breath of the monster blowing upon his back.  His only chance was to make a sudden deviation from his course, and leave the borele to pass on in its impetuous charge.  This he did, turning sharply to the right, when he saw that he had just escaped being elevated upon the creature's horn.  This manoeuvre enabled him to gain some distance as he started off in the new direction.  But it was not long maintained; for the borele was again in hot pursuit, without any show of fatigue; while the tremendous exertions he had himself been making rendered him incapable of continuing his flight much longer.  He had just sufficient strength left to avoid an immediate encounter by taking one more turn, when, fortunately, he saw before him the trunk of a large baobab-tree lying prostrate along the ground.  It had been blown down by some mighty storm, and lay resting upon its roots at one end, and its shivered branches at the other, so as to leave a space of about two feet between its trunk and the ground.  Suddenly throwing himself down, Arend glided under the tree, just in time to escape the long horn, whose point had again come in close proximity with his posterior.  The hunter had now time to recover his breath, and, to some extent, his confidence.  He saw that the fallen tree would protect him.  Even should the rhinoceros come round to the other side, he would only have to roll back again to place himself beyond the reach of its terrible horn.  The space below was ample enough to enable him to pass through, but too small for the body of a borele.  By creeping back and forward he could always place himself in safety.  And this was just what he had to do; for the enraged monster, on seeing him on the other side, immediately ran round the roots, and renewed the attack.  This course of action was several times repeated before the young hunter was allowed much time for reflection.  He was in hopes that the brute would get tired of the useless charges it was making and either go away itself, or give him the opportunity.  In this hope he was doomed to disappointment.  The animal, exasperated with the wounds it had received, appeared implacable; and for more than an hour it kept running around the tree in vain attempts to get at him. As he had very little trouble in avoiding it, there was plenty of opportunity for reflection; and he passed the time in devising some plan to settle the misunderstanding between the borele and himself.  The first he thought of was to make use of his rifle.  The weapon was within his reach where he had dropped it when diving under the tree; but when about to reload it, he discovered that the ramrod was missing!  So sudden had been the charge of the borele, at the time the rifle was last loaded, that the ramrod had not been returned to its proper place, but left behind upon the plain.  This was an unlucky circumstance; and for a time the young hunter could not think of anything better than to keep turning from side to side, to avoid the presence of the besieger.  The borele at last seemed to show signs of exhaustion, or, at all events, began to perceive the unprofitable nature of the tactics it had been pursuing.  But the spirit of revenge was not the least weakened within it, for it made no move toward taking its departure from the spot.  On the contrary, it lay down by the baobab in a position to command a view on both sides of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27911"],["title","The Giraffe Hunters (#5)"],["body"," trunk, evidently determined to stay there and await the chance of getting within reach of its victim.  Thus silently beleaguered, the young hunter set about considering in what manner he might accomplish the raising of the siege.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  RESCUED.  The sun went down, the moon ascended above the tops of the surrounding trees, yet the borele seemed no less inspired by the spirit of revenge than on first receiving the injuries it was wishing to resent.  For many hours the young hunter waited patiently for it to move away in search of food or any other object except that of revenge; but in this hope he was disappointed.  The pain inflicted by the shots would not allow either hunger or thirst to interfere with the desire for retaliation, and it continued to maintain a watch so vigilant that Arend dared not leave his retreat for an instant.  Whenever he made a movement, the enemy did the same.  It was a long time before he could think of any plan that would give him a chance of getting away.  One at length occurred to him.  Although unable to reload the rifle with a bullet, the thought came into his mind, that the borele might be blinded by a heavy charge of powder, or so confused by it as to give him an opportunity of stealing away. This seemed an excellent plan, yet so simple that Arend was somewhat surprised he had not thought of it before.  Without difficulty he succeeded in pouring a double quantity of powder into the barrel; and, in order to keep it there until he had an opportunity for a close shot, some dry grass was forced into the muzzle. The chance soon offered; and, taking a deliberate aim at one of the borele's eyes with the muzzle of the gun not more than two feet from its head, he pulled trigger.  With a loud moan of mingled rage and agony, the rhinoceros rushed towards him, and frantically, but vainly exerted all its strength in an endeavour to overturn the baobab.  \"One more shot at the other eye,\" thought Arend, \"and I shall be free.\"  He immediately proceeded to pour another dose of powder into the rifle, but while thus engaged a new danger suddenly presented itself.  The dry grass projected from the gun had ignited and set fire to the dead leaves that were strewed plentifully over the ground.  In an instant these were ablaze, the flame spreading rapidly on all sides, and moving towards him.  The trunk of the baobab could no longer afford protection.  In another minute it, too, would be enveloped in the red fire, and to stay by its side would be to perish in the flames.  There was no alternative but to get to his feet and run for his life.  Not a moment was to be lost, and, slipping from under the tree, he started off at the top of his speed.  The chances were in his favour for escaping unobserved by the rhinoceros.  But fortune seemed decidedly against him.  Before getting twenty paces from the tree, he saw that he was pursued.  Guided either by one eye or its keen sense of hearing, the monster was following him at a pace so rapid that, if long enough continued, it must certainly overtake him.  Once more the young hunter began to feel something like despair.  Death seemed hard upon his heels.  A few seconds more, and he might be impaled on that terrible horn.  But for that instinctive love of life which all feel, he might have surrendered himself to fate; but urged by this, he kept on.  He was upon the eve of falling to the earth through sheer exhaustion, when his ears were saluted by the deep-toned bay of a hound, and close after it a voice exclaiming--  \"Look out, Baas Willem!  Somebody come yonder!\"  Two seconds more and Arend was safe from further pursuit.  The hound Spoor'em was dancing about the borele's head, by his loud, angry yelps diverting its attention from everything but himself.  Two seconds more and Groot Willem and Hendrik came riding up; and, in less than half a minute after, the monster, having received a shot from the heavy roer, slowly settled down in its tracks--a dead rhinoceros.  Willem and Hendrik leaped from their horses and shook hands with Arend in a manner as cordial as if they were just meeting him after an absence of many years.  \"What does it mean, Arend?\" jocosely inquired Hendrik.  \"Has this brute been pursuing you for the last twelve hours?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And how much longer do you think the chase would have continued?\"  \"About ten seconds,\" replied Arend, speaking in a very positive tone.  \"Very well,\" said Hendrik, who was so rejoiced at the deliverance of his friend that he felt inclined to be witty.  \"We know now how long you are capable of running.  You can lead a borele a chase of just twelve hours and ten seconds.\"  Groot Willem was for some time unspeakably happy, and said not a word until they had returned to the place where the lion had been killed. Here they stopped for the purpose of recovering the saddle and bridle from the carcass of the horse.  Groot Willem proposed they should remain there till the morning; his reason being that, in returning through the narrow path that led out to the open plain, they might be in danger of meeting buffaloes, rhinoceroses, or elephants, and be trampled to death in the darkness.  \"That's true,\" replied Arend; \"and it might be better to stay here until daylight, but for two reasons.  One is, that I am dying of hunger, and should like a roast rib of that antelope I shot in the morning.\"  \"And so should I,\" said Hendrik, \"but the jackals have saved us the trouble of eating that.\"  Arend was now informed of the events that had occurred to his absence, and was highly amused at Hendrik's account of the misfortune that had befallen Swartboy and Congo.  \"We are making a very fair commencement in the way of adventures,\" said he, after relating his own experiences of the day, \"but so far our expedition has been anything but profitable.\"  \"We must go farther down the river,\" said Willem.  \"We have not yet seen the spoor of either hippopotamus or giraffe.  We must keep moving until we come upon them.  I never want to see another lion, borele, or elephant.\"  \"But what is your other reason for going back to camp?\" asked Hendrik, addressing himself to Arend.  \"What would it be?\" replied Arend.  \"Do you suppose that our dear friend Hans has no feelings?\"  \"O, that's what you mean, is it?\"  \"Of course it is.  Surely Hans will by this time be half dead with anxiety on our account.\"  All agreed that it would be best to go on to the camp; and, after transferring the saddle and bridle from the carcass of the horse to the shoulders of Congo, they proceeded onward, arriving in camp at a very late hour, and finding Hans, as Arend had conjectured, overwhelmed with apprehension at their long absence.    CHAPTER NINE.  AN INCIDENT OF THE ROAD.  Next morning, they broke up their camp and moved down the river, extending their march into the second day.  After passing the drift where the Limpopo had been first crossed, Groot Willem, accompanied by Congo, was riding nearly a mile in advance of his companions.  His object in leading the way so far ahead was to bag any game worthy of his notice, before it should be frightened by the others.  Occasionally, a small herd of some of the many varieties of antelopes in which South Africa abounds fled before him; but these the great hunter scarce deigned to notice.  His thief object was to find a country frequented by hippopotami and giraffes.  On his way he passed many of the lofty pandanus or screw pine-trees. Some of these were covered from top to bottom with parasitic plants, giving them the appearance of tall towers or obelisks.  Underneath one of these trees, near the river, and about three hundred yards from where he was riding, he saw a buffalo cow with her calf.  The sun was low down; and the time had therefore arrived when some buffalo veal would be acceptable both to the men and dogs of the expedition.  Telling Congo to stay where he was, the hunter rode to the leeward of the buffalo cow, and, under cover of some bushes, commenced making approach.  Knowing that a buffalo cow is easily alarmed, more especially when accompanied by her calf, he made his advances with the greatest caution.  Knowing, also, that no animal shows more fierceness and contempt for danger, while protecting its young, he was anxious to get a dead shot, so as to avoid the risk of a conflict with the cow, should she be only wounded.  When he had got as close as the cover would allow him, he took aim at the cow's heart and fired.  Contrary to his expectation, the animal neither fell nor fled, but merely turned an inquiring glance in the direction from whence the report had proceeded.  This was a mystery the hunter could not explain.  Why did the cow keep to the same spot?  If not disabled by the bullet, why had she not gone off, taking her young one along with her?  \"I might as well have been stalking a tree as this buffalo,\" thought Willem, \"for one seems as little inclined to move as the other.\"  Hastily reloading his roer, he rode fearlessly forward, now quite confident that the cow could not escape him.  She seemed not to care about retreating, and he had got close up to the spot where she stood, when all at once the buffalo charged furiously towards him, and was only stopped by receiving a second bullet from the roer that hit right in the centre of the forehead.  One more plunge forward and the animal dropped on her knees, and died after the manner of buffaloes, with legs spread and back uppermost, instead of falling over on its side.  Another shot finished the calf, which was crying pitifully by the side of its mother.  Congo now came up, and, while examining the calf, discovered that one of its legs had been already broken.  This accounted for the cow not having attempted to save herself by flight.  She knew that her offspring was disabled, and stayed by it from an instinct of maternal solicitude.  While Willem was engaged reloading his gun, he heard a loud rustling among the parasitical plants that loaded"]]]
