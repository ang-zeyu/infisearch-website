On New Zealand mammals it is not necessary to quote any book; for when the English came, it is said, New Zealand contained no mammal larger than a rat.  Captain Cook turned two pigs loose; but it is stated on authority, that these pigs left no descendants. One was ridden to death by Maori boys, and the other was killed for sacrilege: he rooted in a tapu burial-place.  Nevertheless, the settlers still call any wild-pig, especially if lean and bony, a \"Captain Cook.\"  For the scientific nomenclature of Australian Botany the <i>Census of Australian Plants</i> by the Baron von Mueller (1889) is indispensable.  It has been strictly followed.  For fishes reliance has been placed upon Tenison Woods' <i>Fishes and Fisheries of New South Wales</i> (1882), on W. Macleay's <i>Descriptive Catalogue of Australian Fishes</i> (Proceedings of the Linnaean Society of New South Wales, vols. v. and vi.), and on Dr. Guenther's <i>Study of Fishes</i>.  For the scientific nomenclature of Animal Life, the standard of reference has been the <i>Tabular List of all the Australian Birds</i> by E. P. Ramsay of the Australian Museum, Sydney (1888); <i>Catalogue of Australian Mammals</i> by J. O. Ogilby of the Australian Museum, Sydney (1892); <i>Catalogue of Marsupials and Monotremes</i>, British Museum (1888); <i>Prodromus to the Natural History of Victoria</i> by Sir F. McCoy.  Constant reference has also been made to Proceedings of the Linnaean Society of New South Wales, Proceedings and Transactions of the Royal Societies of Victoria and Tasmania, and to the journal of the Field Naturalist Club of Victoria.  The birds both in Australia and New Zealand have been handsomely treated by the scientific illustrators.  Gould's <i>Birds of Australia</i> and Buller's <i>Birds of New Zealand</i> are indeed monumental works.  Neither Gould nor Sir Walter Buller scorns vernacular names.  But since the days of the former the number of named species of Australian birds has largely increased, and in January 1895, at the Brisbane Meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, a Committee was appointed to draw up a list of vernacular bird-names.  By the kindness of a member of this Committee (Mr. A. J. Campbell of Melbourne) I was allowed the use of a list of such vernacular names drawn up by him and Col. Legge for submission to the Committee.    VIII.  SCIENTIFIC WORDS.   The example of <i>The Century</i> has been followed in the inclusion of sundry scientific names, especially those of genera or Natural Orders of purely Australasian objects. Although it is quite true that these can hardly be described as Australasian <i>English</i>, it is believed that the course adopted will be for the general convenience of those who consult this Dictionary.  Some of these \"Neo-Latin\" and \"Neo-Greek\" words are extraordinary in themselves and obscure in their origin, though not through antiquity.  In his <i>Student's Pastime</i>, at p. 293, Dr. Skeat says \"Nowhere can more ignorant etymologies be found than in works on Botany and `scientific' subjects. Too often, all the science is reserved for the subject, so that there is none to spare for explaining the names.\"  A generous latitude has also been taken in including some words undoubtedly English, but not exclusively Australasian, such as <i>Anabranch</i>, and <i>Antipodes</i>, and some mining and other terms that are also used in the United States. Convenience of readers is the excuse.  <i>Anabranch</i> is more frequently used of Australian rivers than of any others, but perhaps a little pride in tracking the origin of the word has had something to do with its inclusion.  Some words have been inserted for purposes of explanation, e.g. <i>Snook</i>, in Australasia called <i>Barracouta</i>, which latter is itself an old name applied in Australasia to a different fish; and <i>Cavally</i>, which is needed to explain <i>Trevally</i>.    IX. ASSISTANCE RECEIVED.   There remains the pleasant duty of acknowledging help.  Many persons have given me help, whose names can hardly be listed here.  A friend, an acquaintance, or sometimes even a stranger, has often sent a single quotation of value, or an explanation of a single word.  The Editors of many newspapers have helped not a little by the insertion of a letter or a circular.  To all these helpers, and I reckon their number at nearly 200, I tender my hearty thanks.  Various officers of the Melbourne Public Library, and my friend Mr. Edward H. Bromby, the Librarian of this University, have rendered me much assistance.  I have often been fortunate enough to obtain information from the greatest living authority on a particular subject: from the Baron von Mueller, from Sir Frederick M'Coy, or from Mr. A. W. Howitt.  [Alas! since I penned this sentence, the kind and helpful Baron has been taken from us, and is no longer the greatest living authority on Australian Botany.]  My friend and colleague, Professor Baldwin Spencer, a most earnest worker in the field of Australian science, gave many hours of valuable time to set these pages right in the details of scientific explanations. Mr. J. G. Luehmann of Melbourne has kindly answered various questions about Botany, and Mr. A. J. North, of Sydney, in regard to certain birds.  Mr. T. S. Hall, of the Biological Department of this University, and Mr. J. J. Fletcher, of Sydney, the Secretary of the Linnaean Society of New South Wales, have rendered me much help.  The Rev. John Mathew, of Coburg, near Melbourne, has thrown much light on aboriginal words.  The Rev. E. H. Sugden, Master of Queen's College in this University, has furnished a large number of useful quotations.  His name is similarly mentioned, <i>honoris causa</i>, in Dr. Murray's Preface to Part I. of the `O. E. D.' Mr. R. T. Elliott of Worcester College, Oxford, has given similar help.  The Master himself,--the Master of all who engage in Dictionary work,--Dr. Murray, of Oxford, has kindly forwarded to me a few pithy and valuable comments on my proof-streets.  He also made me a strong appeal never to pass on information from any source without acknowledgment.  This, the only honest course, I have striven scrupulously to follow; but it is not always easy to trace the sources whence information has been derived.  When gaps in the sequence of quotations were especially apparent on the proofs, Mr. W. Ellis Bird, of Richmond, Victoria, found me many illustrative passages.  For New Zealand words a goodly supply of quotations was contributed by Miss Mary Colborne-Veel of Christchurch, author of a volume of poetry called <i>The Fairest of the Angels</i>, by her sister, Miss Gertrude Colborne-Veel, and by Mr. W. H. S. Roberts of Oamaru, author of a little book called <i>Southland in</i> 1856.  In the matter of explanation of the origin and meaning of New Zealand terms, Dr. Hocken of Dunedin, Mr. F. R. Chapman of the same city, and Mr. Edward Tregear of Wellington, author of the <i>Maori Polynesian Dictionary</i>, and Secretary of the Polynesian Society, have rendered valuable and material assistance.  Dr. Holden of Bellerive, near Hobart, was perhaps my most valued correspondent.  After I had failed in one or two quarters to enlist Tasmanian sympathy, he came to the rescue, and gave me much help on Tasmanian words, especially on the Flora and the birds; also on Queensland Flora and on the whole subject of Fishes.  Dr. Holden also enlisted later the help of Mr. J. B. Walker, of Hobart, who contributed much to enrich my proofs.  But the friend who has given me most help of all has been Mr. J. Lake of St. John's College, Cambridge.  When the Dictionary was being prepared for press, he worked with me for some months, very loyally putting my materials into shape. Birds, Animals, and Botany he sub-edited for me, and much of the value of this part of the Book, which is almost an Encyclopaedia rather than a Dictionary, is due to his ready knowledge, his varied attainments, and his willingness to undertake research.  To all who have thus rendered me assistance I tender hearty thanks.  It is not their fault if, as is sure to be the case, defects and mistakes are found in this Dictionarv.  But should the Book be received with public favour, these shall be corrected in a later edition.  EDWARD E. MORRIS.

The word has disappeared with the need for it.  1837.  Jas. Mudie, `Felonry of New South Wales,' p. vii.:  \"The ludicrous and affected philanthropy of the present Governor of the Colony, in advertising runaway convicts under the soft and gentle name of <i>absentees</i>, is really unaccountable, unless we suppose it possible that his Excellency as a native of Ireland, and as having a well-grounded Hibernian antipathy to his absentee countrymen, uses the term as one expressive both of the criminality of the absentee and of his own abhorrence of the crime.\"  <hw>Acacia</hw>, <i>n</i>. and <i>adj</i>. a genus of shrubs or trees, <i>N.O. Leguminosae</i>.  The Australian species often form thickets or scrubs, and are much used for hedges.  The species are very numerous, and are called provincially by various names, e.g.  \"Wattle,\" \"Mulga,\" \"Giddea,\" and \"Sally,\" an Anglicized form of the aboriginal name <i>Sallee</i> (q.v.). The tree peculiar to Tasmania, <i>Acacia riceana</i>, Hensl., (i>N.O. Leguminosae</i>, is there called the <i>Drooping Acacia</i>.  1827.  P. Cunningham, `Two Years in New South Wales,' vol. i. p. 202:  \"We possess above a hundred and thirty species of the acacia.\"  1839.  Dr. J. Shotsky, quoted in `Sydney Morning Herald,' Aug. 5, p. 5, col. 2:  \"Yet, Australian sky and nature awaits and merits real artists to portray it.  Its gigantic gum and acacia trees, 40 ft. in girth, some of them covered with a most smooth bark, externally as white as chalk. .. .\"  1844.  L. Leichhardt, Letter in `Cooksland,' by J. D. Lang, p. 91:  \"Rosewood Acacia, the wood of which has a very agreeable violet scent like the Myal Acacia (<i>A. pendula</i>) in Liverpool Plains.\"  1846.  C. P. Hodgson, `Reminiscences of Australia,' p. 149:  \"The Acacias are innumerable, all yielding a famous bark for tanning, and a clean and excellent gum.\"  1869.  Mrs. Meredith, `A Tasmanian Memory,' p. 8:  \"Acacias fringed with gold.\"  1877.  F. v. Mueller, `Botanic Teachings,' p. 24:  \"The name Acacia, derived from the Greek, and indicative of a thorny plant, was already bestowed by the ancient naturalist and physician Dioscorides on a Gum-Arabic yielding North-African Acacia not dissimilar to some Australian species. This generic name is so familiarly known, that the appellation `Wattle' might well be dispensed with.  Indeed the name Acacia is in full use in works on travels and in many popular writings for the numerous Australian species . . .  Few of any genera of plants contain more species than Acacia, and in Australia it is the richest of all; about 300 species, as occurring in our continent, have been clearly defined.\"  <hw>Acrobates</hw>, <i>n</i>. the scientific name of the Australian genus of <i>Pigmy Flying-Phalangers</i>, or, as they are locally called, <i>Opossum-Mice</i>.  See <i>Opossum-Mouse, Flying-Mouse, Flying-Phalanger</i>, and <i>Phalanger</i>.  The genus was founded by Desmarest in 1817. (Grk. <i>'akrobataes</i>, walking on tiptoe.)  <hw>AEpyprymnus</hw>, <i>n</i>.  the scientific name of the genus of the <i>Rufous Kangaroo-Rat</i>.  It is the tallest and largest of the Kangaroo-Rats (q.v.).  (Grk. <i>'aipus</i>, high, and <i>prumnon</i>, the hinder part.)  <hw>Ailuroedus</hw>, <i>n</i>. scientific name for the genus of Australian birds called <i>Cat-birds</i> (q.v.).  From Grk. <i>'ailouros</i>, a cat, and <i>'eidos</i>, species.  <hw>Ake</hw>, <i>n</i>. originally Akeake, Maori name for either of two small trees, (1) <i>Dodonaea viscosa</i>, Linn., in New Zealand; (2) <i>Olearia traversii</i>, F. v. M., in the Chatham Islands.  Ake is originally a Maori <i>adv</i>.  meaning \"onwards, in time.\"  Archdeacon Williams, in his `Dictionary of New Zealand Language,' says <i>Ake</i>, <i>Ake</i>, <i>Ake</i>, means \" for ever and ever.\" (Edition 182.)  1820.  `Grammar and Vocabulary of Language of New Zealand' (Church Missionary Society), p.133:  \"Akeake, <i>paulo post futurum</i>\"  1835.  W. Yale, `Some Account of New Zealand,' p. 47:  \"Aki, called the <i>Lignum vitae</i> of New Zealand.\"  1851.  Mrs. Wilson, `New Zealand,' p. 43:  \"The ake and towai . . . are almost equal, in point of colour, to rosewood.\"  1883.  J. Hector, `Handbook to New Zealand,' p. 131:  \"Ake, a small tree, 6 to 12 feet high.  Wood very hard, variegated, black and white; used for Maori clubs; abundant in dry woods and forests.\"  <hw>Alarm-bird</hw>, <i>n</i>.  a bird-name no longer used in Australia.  There is an African Alarm-bird.  1848.  J. Gould, `Birds of Australia,' vol. vi. pl. 9:  \"<i>Lobivanellus lobatus</i> (Lath.), Wattled Pewit, Alarm Bird of the Colonists.\"  <hw>Alectryon</hw>, <i>n</i>. a New Zealand tree and flower, <i>Alectryon excelsum</i>, De C., Maori name <i>Titoki</i> (q.v.); called also the <i>New Zealand Oak</i>, from the resemblance of its leaves to those of an oak.  Named by botanists from Grk. <i>'alektruown</i>, a cock.  1872.  A. Domett, `Ranolf,' I. 7, p. 16:  \"The early season could not yet Have ripened the alectryon's beads of jet, Each on its scarlet strawberry set.\"  <hw>Alexandra Palm</hw>, <i>n</i>. a Queensland tree, <i>Ptychosperma alexandrae</i>, F. v. M.  A beautifully marked wood much used for making walking sticks.  It grows 70 or 80 feet high.  <hw>Alluvial</hw>, <i>n</i>. the common term in Australia and New Zealand for gold-bearing alluvial soil.  The word is also used adjectivally as in England.  1889.  Rolf Boldrewood, `Robbery under Arms,' p. 403:  \"The whole of the alluvial will be taken up, and the Terrible Hollow will re-echo with the sound of pick and shovel.\"  <hw>Ambrite</hw> (generally called <B>ambrit</B>), <i>n</i>. Mineral [from amber + ite, mineral formative, `O.E.D.'], a fossil resin found in masses amidst lignite coals in various parts of New Zealand.  Some identify it with the resin of <i>Dammara australis</i>, generally called <i>Kauri gum</i> (q.v.).  1867.  F. von Hochstetter, `New Zealand,' p. 79:  \"Although originating probably from a coniferous tree related to the Kauri pine, it nevertheless has been erroneously taken for Kauri gum.\"--[Footnote]: \"It is sufficiently characterised to deserve a special name ; but it comes so near to real <i>amber</i> that it deserves the name of <i>Ambrite</i>.\"  [This is the earliest use of the word.]  <hw>Anabranch</hw>, <i>n</i>. a branch of a river which leaves it and enters it again. The word is not Australian, though it is generally so reckoned.  It is not given in the `Century,' nor in the `Imperial,' nor in `Webster,' nor in the `Standard.' The `O.E.D.' treats <i>Ana</i> as an independent word, rightly explaining it as <i>anastomosing</i>, but its quotation from the `Athenaeum' (1871), on which it relies,is a misprint.  For the origin and coinage of the word, see quotation 1834.  See the aboriginal name <i>Billabong</i>.  1834.  Col.Jackson, `Journal of Royal Geographical Society,' p. 79:  \"Such branches of a river as after separation re-unite, I would term <i>anastomosing-branches</i>; or, if a word might be coined, <i>ana-branches</i>, and the islands they form, <i>branch-islands</i>.  Thus, if we would say, `the river in this part of its course divides into several <i>ana-branches</i>,' we should immediately understand the subsequent re-union of the branches to the main trunk.\"  Col. Jackson was for a while Secretary and Editor of the Society's Journal.  In Feb. 1847 he resigned that position, and in the journal of that year there is the following amusing ignorance of his proposed word--  1847.  `Condensed Account of Sturt's Exploration in the Interior of Australia--Journal of the Royal Geographical Society,' p. 87:  \"Captain Sturt"]]]
