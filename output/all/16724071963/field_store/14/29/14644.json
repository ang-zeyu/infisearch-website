LONDON:                           PRIVATELY PRINTED.                                 1869.    PREFACE.   The reproductive powers of Nature were regarded by the nations of remote antiquity with an awe and reverence so great, as to form an object of worship, under a symbol, of all others the most significant,--the _Phallus_; and thus was founded a religion, of which the traces exist to this day, not in Asia only, but even in Europe itself.  That scarcely any notices of this worship should appear in modern works, except in the erudite pages of a few antiquarians may be accounted for by considering the difference of opinion between the ancients and the moderns as to what constitutes--modesty; the former being unable to see any moral turpitude in actions they regarded was the designs of nature, while the latter, by their over-strained notions of delicacy, render themselves, in some degree at least, obnoxious to the charge that, in proportion as manners becomes corrupt, language becomes more guarded,--modesty, when banished from the heart, taking refuge on the lips.  To supply, to some extent, this lacuna in our popular literature has been the object of the present work, in which, it is hoped, may be found much curious and interesting physiological information, interspersed with _recherché_ and festivous anecdotes.  The text is illustrated by a few plates, drawn from antiquarian sources.  J. D.     LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS.

AND Pompeian House--sign.]     ESSAY I.  REMARKS UPON THE SYMBOLS OF THE REPRODUCTIVE POWERS.   From the investigations and researches of the learned, there appears to be no doubt but that the most ancient of all superstitions was that in which Nature was contemplated chiefly under the attribute or property of fecundity; the symbols of the reproductive power being those under which its prolific potencies were exhibited. It is not because modern fastidiousness affects to consider those symbols as indecent, and even obscene, that we should therefore suppose them to have been so regarded by the ancients: on the contrary, the view of them awakened no impure ideas in the minds of the latter, being regarded by them as the most sacred objects of worship. The ancients, indeed, did not look upon the pleasures of love with the same eye as the moderns do; the tender union of the sexes excited their veneration, because religion appeared to consecrate it, inasmuch as their mythology presented to them all Olympus as more occupied with amatory delights than with the government of the universe.  The reflecting men of those times, more simple, but, it must be confessed, more profound, than those of our own day, could not see any moral turpitude in actions regarded by them as the design of nature, and as the acme of felicity. For this reason it is that we find not only ancient writers expressing themselves freely upon subjects regarded by us as indecent, but even sculptors and painters equally unrestrained in this particular.  The statesman took advantage of these religious impressions: whatever tended to increase population being held in honour. Those images and Priapi so frequently found in the temples of the ancients, and even in their houses, and which we consider as objects of indecent lewdness, were, in their eyes, but so many sacred motives exciting them to propagate their species.  In order to represent by a physical object the reproductive power of the sun in spring-time, as well as the action of that power on all sentient beings, the ancients adopted that symbol of the male gender which the Greeks, who derive it from the Egyptians, called--Phallus.[1] This worship was so general as to have spread itself over a large portion of the habitable globe, for it flourished for many ages in Egypt and Syria, Persia, Asia Minor, Greece and Italy: it was, and still is, in vigour in India and many parts of Africa, and was even found in America on its discovery by the Spaniards. Thus Garcilaso de la Vega informs us[2] that, in the public squares of Panuco (a Mexican town), _bas-reliefs_ were found which, like those of India, represented, in various ways the sexual union; while at Tlascala, another town of that country, the reproductive act was worshipped under the joint symbol of the generative organs, male and female.  A more surprising fact is, that this worship has, as will be shewn hereafter, been perpetuated to a very late date, among the Christians of Europe.  In its origin, the Phallus or emblem of the generative and procreative powers of nature appears to have been of a very simple and inoffensive character--although it was afterwards made subservient to the grossest and most superstitious purposes.  In India this worship is everywhere to be found accompanying the triune God, called by the Hindoos, _Trimourti_ or _Trinity_, and the significant form of the single obelisk or pillar called the _Linga_ or _Lingham_;[3] and it should be observed, in justice to the Hindoos that it is some comparative and negative praise to them, that this emblem, under which they express the éléments and operations of nature is not externally indecorous. Unlike the abominable realities of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, we see this Indian phallic emblem in the Hindoo religious exhibitions, without offence, nor know, until information be extorted, that we are contemplating a symbol whose prototype is obscene.[4]  [Illustration: PLATE II., Fig 1. Lingham, Fig 2. Pan's head.]  Besides the Lingham, the equally significant _Yoni_ or _Cteis_ is to be seen, being the female organ of generation. It is sometimes single, often in conjunction, for the Indians, believing that the emblem of fecundity might be rendered more energetic by combining the organs of both sexes, did so unite them, giving to this double symbol the name of _Pulleiar_, confounded by some writers with the Lingham itself. This pulleiar is highly venerated by the sectarian worshippers of Siva (the third god of the Trimourti), who hang it round their neck, as a charm or amulet, or enclosing it in a small box, fasten it upon their arm. The Indians have also a little jewel called _taly_, worn, in like manner, by females round their necks as a charm. It is presented to them on their wedding day by their husbands, who receive it from the hands of the Brahmins. Upon these jewels is engraved the representation, either of the Lingham or of the Pulleiar. The following anecdote connected with this custom is given by M. Sonnerat.[5]    \"A Capuchin missionary had a serious dispute with the   Jesuits residing at Pondicherry, which was referred for   decision to the judicial courts. The disciples of Loyola,   who can be toleration itself when toleration furthers their   crafty and ambitious views, had declined all interference   with the above custom. M. Tournon, the Pope's legate   apostolic, who regarded the matter as one not to be trifled   with, and with whom, moreover, the Jesuits were no   favourites, strictly prohibited the _taly_, enjoining all   female converts to substitute in its place either a cross or   a medal of the Virgin. The Indian women, strongly attached   to their ancient customs, refused obedience. The   missionaries, apprehensive of losing the fruits of their   zealous labours, and seeing the number of their neophytes   daily diminishing, entered into a compromise by adopting a   _mezzo-termine_ with the females in question, and it was   agreed that a Cross should be engraved upon the _taly_, an   arrangement by which the symbol of Christian salvation was   coupled with that of the male and female _pudenda_.\"  The deep and enthusiastic veneration felt by the Hindoos for this worship is naturally explained by their"]]]
