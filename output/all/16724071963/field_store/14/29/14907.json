In the introductions to the various cantos of _Marmion_ he has given us a delightful picture of Ashestiel and its surroundings--the swift Glenkinnon dashing through the estate in a deep ravine, on its way to join the Tweed; behind the house the rising hills beyond which lay the lovely scenery of the Yarrow. The eight years (1804-1812) at Ashestiel were the serenest, and probably the happiest, of Scott's life. Here he wrote his two greatest poems, _Marmion_ and _The Lady of the Lake_. His mornings he spent at his desk, always with a faithful hound at his feet watching the tireless hand as it threw off sheet after sheet of manuscript to make up the day's stint. By one o'clock he was, as he said, \"his own man,\" free to spend the remaining hours of light with his children, his horses, and his dogs, or to indulge himself in his life-long passion for tree-planting. His robust and healthy nature made him excessively fond of all out-of-door sports, especially riding, in which he was daring to foolhardiness. It is a curious fact, noted by Lockhart, that many of Scott's senses were blunt; he could scarcely, for instance, tell one wine from another by the taste, and once sat quite unconscious at his table while his guests were manifesting extreme uneasiness over the approach of a too-long-kept haunch of venison, but his sight was unusually keen, as his hunting exploits proved. His little son once explained his father's popularity by saying that \"it was him that commonly saw the hare sitting.\" What with hunting, fishing, salmon-spearing by torchlight, gallops over the hills into the Yarrow country, planting and transplanting of his beloved trees, Scott's life at Ashestiel, during the hours when he was \"his own man,\" was a very full and happy one.  Unfortunately, he had already embarked in an enterprise which was destined to overthrow his fortunes just when they seemed fairest. While at school in Kelso he had become intimate with a school fellow named James Ballantyne, and later, when Ballantyne set up a small printing house in Kelso, he had given him his earliest poems to print. After the issue of the _Border Minstrelsy_, the typographical excellence of which attracted attention even in London, he set Ballantyne up in business in Edinburgh, secretly entering the firm himself as silent partner. The good sale of the _Lay_ had given the firm an excellent start; but more matter was presently needed to feed the press. To supply it, Scott undertook and completed at Ashestiel four enormous tasks of editing--the complete works of Dryden and of Swift, the Somers' Tracts, and the Sadler State Papers. The success of these editions, and the subsequent enormous sale of Scott's poems and novels, would have kept the concern solvent in spite of Ballantyne's complete incapacity for business, but in 1809 Scott plunged recklessly into another and more serious venture. A dispute with Constable, the veteran publisher and bookseller, aggravated by the harsh criticism delivered upon _Marmion_ by Francis Jeffrey, editor of the _Edinburgh Review_, Constable's magazine, determined Scott to set up in connection with the Ballantyne press a rival bookselling concern, and a rival magazine, to be called the _Quarterly Review_. The project was a daring one, in view of Constable's great ability and resources; to make it foolhardy to madness Scott selected to manage the new business a brother of James Ballantyne, a dissipated little buffoon, with about as much business ability and general caliber of character as is connoted by the name which Scott coined for him, \"Rigdumfunnidos.\" The selection of such a man for such a place betrays in Scott's eminently sane and balanced mind a curious strain of impracticality, to say the least; indeed, we are almost constrained to feel with his harsher critics that it betrays something worse than defective judgment--defective character. His greatest failing, if failing it can be called, was pride. He could not endure even the mild dictations of a competent publisher, as is shown by his answer to a letter written by one of them proposing some salaried work; he replied curtly that he was a \"black Hussar\" of literature, and not to be put to such tame service. Probably this haughty dislike of dictation, this imperious desire to patronize rather than be patronized, led him to choose inferior men with whom to enter into business relations. If so, he paid for the fault so dearly that it is hard for a biographer to press the issue against him.  For the present, however, the wind of fortune was blowing fair, and all the storm clouds were below the horizon. In 1808 _Marmion_ appeared, and was greeted with an enthusiasm which made the unprecedented reception of the _Lay_ seem lukewarm in comparison. _Marmion_ contains nothing which was not plainly foreshadowed in the _Lay_, but the hand of the poet has grown more sure, his descriptive effects are less crude and amateurish, the narrative proceeds with a steadier march, the music has gained in volume and in martial vigor. An anecdote is told by Mr. Hutton which will serve as a type of a hundred others illustrative of the extraordinary hold which this poetry took upon the minds of ordinary men. \"I have heard,\" he says, \"of two old men--complete strangers--passing each other on a dark London night, when one of them happened to be repeating to himself, just as Campbell did to the hackney coachman of the North Bridge of Edinburgh, the last lines of the account of Flodden Field in _Marmion_, 'Charge, Chester, charge,' when suddenly a reply came out of the darkness, 'On, Stanley, on,' whereupon they finished the death of _Marmion_ between them, took off their hats to each other, and parted, laughing.\" _The Lady of the Lake_, which followed in little more than a year, was received with the same popular delight, and with even greater respect on the part of the critics. Even the formidable Jeffrey, who was supposed to dine off slaughtered authors as the Giant in \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" dined off young Englishmen, keyed his voice to unwonted praise. The influx of tourists into the Trossachs, where the scene of the poem was laid, was so great as seriously to embarrass the mail coaches, until at last the posting charges had to be raised in order to diminish the traffic. Far away in Spain, at a trying moment of the Peninsular campaign, Sir Adam Ferguson, posted on a point of ground exposed to the enemy's fire, read to his men as they lay prostrate on the ground the passage from _The Lady of the Lake_ describing the combat between Roderick Dhu's Highlanders and the forces of the Earl of Mar; and \"the listening soldiers only interrupted him by a joyous huzza when the French shot struck the bank close above them.\" Such tributes--and they were legion--to the power of his poetry to move adventurous and hardy men, must have been intoxicating to Scott; there is small wonder that the success of his poems gave him, as he says, \"such a _heeze_ as almost lifted him off his feet.\"   III  Scott's modesty was not in danger, but so far as his prudence was concerned, his success did really lift him off his feet. In 1812, still more encouraged thereto by entering upon the emoluments of the office of Clerk of Sessions, the duties of which he had performed for six years without pay, he purchased Abbotsford, an estate on the Tweed, adjoining that of the Duke of Buccleugh, his kinsman, and near the beautiful ruins of Melrose Abbey. Here he began to carry out the dream of his life, to found a territorial family which should augment the power and fame of his clan. Beginning with a modest farm house and a farm of a hundred acres, he gradually bought, planted, and built, until the farm became a manorial domain and the farm house a castle. He had not gone far in this work before he began to realize that the returns from his poetry would never suffice to meet such demands as would thus be made upon his purse. Byron's star was in the ascendant, and before its baleful magnificence Scott's milder and more genial light visibly paled. He was himself the first to declare, with characteristic generosity, that the younger poet had \"bet\"[3] him at his own craft. As Carlyle says, \"he had held the sovereignty for some half-score of years, a comparatively long lease of it, and now the time seemed come for dethronement, for abdication. An unpleasant business; which, however, he held himself ready, as a brave man will, to transact with composure and in silence.\"  [Footnote 3: Bested, got the better of.]  But, as it proved, there was no need for resignation. The reign of metrical romance, brilliant but brief, was past, or nearly so. But what of prose romance, which long ago, in picking out _Don Quixote_ from the puzzling Spanish, he had promised himself he would one day attempt? With some such questioning of the Fates, Scott drew from his desk the sheets of a story begun seven years before, and abandoned because of the success of _The Lay of the Last Minstrel_. This story he now completed, and published as _Waverley_ in the spring of 1814--an event \"memorable in the annals of British literature; in the annals of British bookselling thrice and four times memorable.\" The popularity of the metrical romances dwindled to insignificance before the enthusiasm with which this prose romance was received. A moment before quietly resolved to give up his place in the world's eye, and to live the life of an obscure country gentleman, Scott found himself launched once more on the tide of brave fortunes.

At Abbotsford, buying, planting, and building began on a greater scale than had ever been planned in its owner's most sanguine moments.  The history of the next eleven years in Scott's life is the history, on the one hand, of the rapidly-appearing novels, of a fame gradually spreading outward from Great Britain until it covered the civilized world--a fame increased rather than diminished by the _incognito_ which the \"author of _Waverley_\" took great pains to preserve even after the secret had become an open one; on the other hand, of the large-hearted, hospitable life at Abbotsford, where, in spite of the importunities of curious and ill-bred tourists, bent on getting a glimpse of the \"Wizard of the North,\" and in spite of the enormous mass of work, literary and official, which Scott took upon himself to perform, the atmosphere of country leisure and merriment was somehow miraculously preserved. This life of the hearty prosperous country laird was the one toward the realization of which all Scott's efforts were directed; it is worth while, therefore, to see as vividly as may be, what kind of life that was, that we may the better understand what kind of man he was who cared for it. The following extract from Lockhart's _Life of Scott_ gives us at least one very characteristic aspect of the Abbotsford world:       \"It was a clear, bright September morning, with a sharpness in the      air that doubled the animating influence of the sunshine; and all      was in readiness for a grand coursing-match on Newark Hill. The      only guest who had chalked out other sport for himself was the      staunchest of anglers, Mr. Rose; but he, too, was there on his      _shelty_, armed with his salmon-rod and landing-net.... This little      group of Waltonians, bound for Lord Somerville's preserve, remained      lounging about, to witness the start of the main cavalcade. Sir      Walter, mounted on Sibyl, was marshalling the order of procession      with a huge hunting-whip; and among a dozen frolicsome youths and      maidens, who seemed disposed to laugh at all discipline, appeared,      each on horseback, each as eager as the youngest sportsman in the      troop, Sir Humphrey Davy, Dr. Wollaston, and the patriarch of      Scottish belles-lettres, Henry Mackenzie.... Laidlow (the steward      of Abbotsford) on a strong-tailed wiry Highlander, yclept Hoddin      Grey, which carried him nimbly and stoutly, although his feet      almost touched the ground, was the adjutant. But the most      picturesque figure was the illustrious inventor of the safety-lamp      (Sir Humphrey Davy) ... a brown hat with flexible brim, surrounded      with line upon line of catgut, and innumerable fly-hooks; jackboots      worthy of a Dutch smuggler, and a fustian surtout dabbled with the      blood of salmon, made a fine contrast with the smart jacket,      white-cord breeches, and well-polished jockey-boots of the less      distinguished cavaliers about him. Dr. Wollaston was in black; and      with his noble serene dignity of countenance might have passed for      a sporting archbishop. Mr. Mackenzie, at this time in the      seventy-sixth year of his age, with a hat turned up with green,      green spectacles, green jacket, and long brown leathern gaiters      buttoned upon his nether anatomy, wore a dog-whistle round his      neck.... Tom Purdie (one of Scott's servants) and his subalterns      had preceded us by a few hours with all the grey-hounds that could      be collected at Abbotsford, Darnick, and Melrose; but the giant      Maida had remained as his master's orderly, and now gamboled about      Sibyl Grey barking for mere joy like a spaniel puppy.       \"The order of march had all been settled, when Scott's daughter      Anne broke from the line, screaming with laughter, and exclaimed,      'Papa, papa, I knew you could never think of going without your      pet!' Scott looked round, and I rather think there was a blush as      well as a smile upon his face, when he perceived a little black pig      frisking about his pony, evidently a self-elected addition to the      party of the day. He tried to look stern, and cracked his whip at      the creature, but was in a moment obliged to join in the general      cheers. Poor piggy soon found a strap round its neck, and was      dragged into the background; Scott, watching the retreat, repeated      with mock pathos, the first verse of an old pastoral song--         What will I do gin my hoggie die?        My joy, my pride, my hoggie!        My only beast, I had na mae,        And wow, but I was vogie!       --the cheers were redoubled--and the squadron moved on.\"  Let us supplement this with one more picture, from the same hand, showing Scott in a little more intimate light. The passage was written in 1821, after Lockhart had married Scott's eldest daughter, and gone to spend the summer at Chiefswood, a cottage on the Abbotsford estate:       \"We were near enough Abbotsford to partake as often as we liked of      its brilliant and constantly varying society; yet could do so      without being exposed to the worry and exhaustion of spirit which      the daily reception of new-comers entailed upon all the family,      except Scott himself. But in truth, even he was not always proof      against the annoyances connected with such a style of open      house-keeping.... When sore beset at home in this way, he would      every now and then discover that he had some very particular      business to attend to on an outlying part of his estate, and      craving the indulgence of his guests overnight, appear at the cabin      in the glen before its inhabitants were astir in the morning. The      clatter of Sibyl Grey's hoofs, the yelping of Mustard and Spice,      and his own joyous shout of _réveillée_ under our windows, were the      signal that he had burst his toils, and meant for that day to 'take      his ease in his inn.' On descending, he was found to be seated with      all his dogs and ours about him, under a spreading ash that      overshadowed half the bank between the cottage and the brook,      pointing the edge of his woodman's axe, and listening to Tom      Purdie's lecture touching the plantation that most needed thinning.      After breakfast he would take possession of a dressing-room      upstairs, and write a chapter of _The Pirate_; and then, having      made up and despatched his packet for Mr. Ballantyne, away to join      Purdie wherever the foresters were at work ... until it was time to      rejoin his own party at Abbotsford or the quiet circle of the      cottage. When his guests were few and friendly, he often made them      come over and meet him at Chiefswood in a body towards evening....      He was ready with all sorts of devices to supply the wants of a      narrow establishment; he used to delight particularly in sinking      the wine in a well under the _brae_ ere he went out, and hauling up      the basket just before dinner was announced,--this primitive device      being, he said, what he had always practised when a young      housekeeper, and in his opinion far superior in its results to any      application of ice; and in the same spirit, whenever the weather      was sufficiently genial, he voted for dining out of doors      altogether.\"  Few events of importance except the successive appearances of \"our buiks\" as Tom Purdie called his master's novels, and an occasional visit to London or the continent, intervened to break the busy monotony of this Abbotsford life. On one of these visits to London, Scott was invited to dine with the Prince Regent, and when the prince became King George IV, in 1820, almost the first act of his reign was to create Scott a baronet. Scott accepted the honor gratefully, as coming, he said, \"from the original source of all honor.\" There can well be two opinions as to whether this least admirable of English kings constituted a very prime fountain of honor, judged by democratic standards; but to Scott's mind, such an imputation would have been next to sacrilege. The feudal bias of his mind, strong to start with, had been strengthened by his long sojourn among the visions of a feudal past; the ideals of feudalism were living realities to him; and he accepted knighthood from his king's hand in exactly the same spirit which determined his attitude of humility towards his \"chief,\" the Duke of Buccleugh, and which impelled him to exhaust his genius in the effort to build up a great family estate.  There were already signs that the enormous burden of work under which he seemed to move so lightly, was telling on him. _The Bride of Lammermoor_, _The Legend of Montrose_, and _Ivanhoe_, had all of them been dictated between screams of pain, wrung from his lips by a chronic cramp of the stomach. By the time he reached _Redgauntlet_ and _St. Ronan's Well_, there began to be heard faint murmurings of discontent from his public, hints that he was writing too fast, and that the noble wine he had poured them for so long was growing at last a trifle watery. To add to these causes of uneasiness, the commercial ventures in which he was interested drifted again into a precarious state. He had himself fallen into the bad habit of forestalling the gains from his novels by heavy drafts on his publishers, and the example thus set was followed faithfully by John Ballantyne. Scott's good humor and his partner's bad judgment saddled the concern with a lot of unsalable books. In 1818 the affairs of the book-selling business had to be closed up, Constable taking over the unsalable stock and assuming the outstanding liabilities in return for copyright privileges covering some of Scott's novels. This so burdened the veteran publisher that when, in 1825, a large London firm failed, it carried him down also--and with him James Ballantyne, with whom he had "]]]
