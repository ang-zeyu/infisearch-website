LABORATORY REGULATIONS.   The following regulations are laid down for observance in the Bacteriological Laboratories under the direction of the author. Similar regulations should be enforced in all laboratories where pathogenic bacteria are studied.       _Guy's Hospital._        ~BACTERIOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT.~       HANDLING OF INFECTIVE MATERIALS.       The following Regulations have been drawn up in the interest      of those working in the Laboratory as well as the public at      large, and will be strictly enforced.       Their object is to avoid the dangers of infection which may      arise from neglect of necessary precautions or from      carelessness.       Everyone must note that by neglecting the general rules laid      down he not only runs grave risk himself, but is a danger to      others.       REGULATIONS.       1. Each worker must wear a gown or overall, provided at his      own expense, which must be kept in the Laboratory.       2. The hands must be disinfected with lysol 2 per cent.      solution, carbolic acid 5 per cent. solution, or corrosive      sublimate 1 per mille solution, after dealing with      infectious material, and ~before using towels~.       3. On no account must Laboratory towels or dusters be used      for wiping up infectious material, and if such towels or      dusters do become soiled, they must be immediately      sterilised by boiling.       4. Special pails containing disinfectant are provided to      receive any waste material, and nothing must be thrown on      the floor.       5. All instruments must be flamed, boiled, or otherwise      disinfected immediately after use.       6. Labels must be moistened with water, and not by the      mouth.       7. All disused cover-glasses, slides, and pipettes after use      in handling infectious material, etc., must be placed in 2      per cent. lysol solution. A vessel is supplied on each bench      for this purpose.       8. All plate and tube cultures of pathogenic organisms when      done with, must be placed for immediate disinfection in the      boxes provided for the purpose.       9. No fluids are to be discharged into sinks or drains      unless previously disinfected.       10. Animals are to be dissected only after being nailed out      on the wooden boards, and their skin thoroughly washed with      disinfectant solution.       11. Immediately after the post-mortem examination is      completed each cadaver must be placed in the zinc      animal-box--_without removing the carcase from the      post-mortem board_--and the cover of the box replaced, ready      for carriage to the destructor.       12. Dead animals, when done with, are cremated in the      destructor, and the laboratory attendant must be notified      when the bodies are ready for cremation.       13. None of the workers in the laboratory are allowed to      enter the animal houses unless accompanied by the special      attendant in charge, who must scrupulously observe the same      directions regarding personal disinfection as the workers in      the laboratories.       14. No cultures are to be taken out of the laboratory      without the permission of the head of the Department.       15. All accidents, such as spilling infected material,      cutting or pricking the fingers, must be at once reported to      the bacteriologist in charge.     II. GLASS APPARATUS IN COMMON USE.   The equipment of the bacteriological laboratory, so far as the glass apparatus is concerned, differs but little from that of a chemical laboratory, and the cleanliness of the apparatus is equally important. The glassware comprised in the following list, in addition to being clean, must be stored in a sterile or germ-free condition.  ~Test-tubes.~--It is convenient to keep several sizes of test-tubes in stock, to meet special requirements, viz.:  1. ~18 × 1.5~ cm., to contain media for ordinary tube cultivations.  2. ~18 × 1.3~ cm., to contain media used for pouring plate cultivations, and also for holding sterile \"swabs.\"  3. ~18 × 2~ cm., to contain wedges of potato, beetroot, or other vegetable media.  4. ~13 × 1.5~ cm., to contain inspissated blood-serum.  The tubes should be made from the best German potash glass, \"blue-lined,\" stout and heavy, with the edge of the mouth of the tube _slightly_ turned over, but not to such an extent as to form a definite rim. (Cost about $1.50, or 6 shillings per gross.) Such tubes are expensive it is true, but they are sufficiently stout to resist rough handling, do not usually break if accidentally allowed to drop (a point of some moment when dealing with cultures of pathogenic bacteria), can be cleaned, sterilised, and used over and over again, and by their length of life fully justify their initial expense.  A point be noted is that the manufacturers rarely turn out such tubes as these absolutely uniform in calibre, and a batch of 18 by 1.5 cm. tubes usually contains such extreme sizes as 18 by 2 cm. and 18 by 1.3 cm. Consequently, if a set of standard tubes is kept for comparison or callipers are used each new supply of so-called 18 by 1.5 cm. tubes may be easily sorted out into these three sizes, and so simplify ordering.  5. ~5 × 0.7~ cm., for use in the inverted position inside the tubes containing carbohydrate media, as gas-collecting tubes.  These tubes, \"unrimmed,\" may be of common thin glass as less than two per cent. are fit for use a second time.  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Bohemian flask.]  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Pear-shaped flask.]  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Erlenmeyer flask (narrow neck).]  ~Bohemian Flasks~ (Fig. 1).--These are the ordinary flasks of the chemical laboratory. A good variety, ranging in capacity from 250 to 3000 c.c., should be kept on hand. A modified form, known as the \"pear-shaped\" (Fig. 2), is preferable for the smaller sizes--i. e., 250 and 500 c.c.  ~Erlenmeyer's Flasks~ (Fig. 3).--Erlenmeyer's flasks of 75, 100, and 250 c.c. capacity are extremely useful. For use as culture flasks care should be taken to select only such as have a narrow neck of about 2 cm. in length.  ~Kolle's Culture Flasks~ (Fig. 4).--These thin, flat flasks (to contain agar or gelatine, which is allowed to solidify in a layer on one side) are extremely useful on account of the large nutrient surface available for growth. A surface cultivation in one of these will yield as much growth as ten or twelve \"oblique\" tube cultures. The wide mouth, however, is a disadvantage, and for many purposes thin, flat culture bottles known as ~Roux's bottles~ (Fig. 5) are to be preferred.  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Kolle's culture flask.]  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Roux's culture bottle.]  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Guy's culture bottle.]  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Filter flask.]  An even more convenient pattern is that used in the author's laboratory (Fig. 6), as owing to the greater depth of medium which it is possible to obtain in these flasks an exceedingly luxuriant growth is possible; the narrow neck reduces the chance of accidental contamination to a minimum and the general shape permits the flasks to be stacked one upon the other.  ~Filter Flasks or Kitasato's Serum Flasks~ (Fig. 7).--Various sizes, from 250 to 2000 c.c. capacity. These must be of stout glass, to resist the pressure to which they are subjected, but at the same time must be thoroughly well annealed, in order to withstand the temperature necessary for sterilisation.  All flasks should be either of Jena glass or the almost equally well-known Resistance or R glass, the extra initial expense being justified by the comparative immunity of the glass from breakage.  ~Petri's Dishes or \"Plates\"~ (Fig. 8, a).--These have now completely replaced the rectangular sheets of glass introduced by Koch for the plate method of cultivation. Each \"plate\" consists of a pair of circular discs of glass with sharply upturned edges, thus forming shallow dishes, one of slightly greater diameter than the other, and so, when inverted, forming a cover or cap for the smaller. Plates having an outside diameter of 10 cm. and a height of 1.5 cm. are the most generally useful. A batch of eighteen such plates is sterilised and stored in a cylindrical copper box (30 cm. high by 12 cm. diameter) provided with a \"pull-off\" lid. Inside each box is a copper stirrup with a circular bottom, upon which the plates rest, and by means of which each can be raised in turn to the mouth of the box (Fig. 9) for removal.  ~Capsules~ (Fig. 8, b and c).--These are Petri's dishes of smaller diameter but greater depth than those termed plates. Two sizes will be found especially useful--viz., 4 cm. diameter by 2 cm. high, capacity about 14 c.c.; and 5 cm. diameter by 2 cm. high, capacity about 25 c.c. These are stored in copper cylinders of similar construction to those used for plates, but measuring 20 by 6 cm. and 20 by 7 cm., respectively.  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Petri dish (a), and capsules (b, c).]  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Plate box with stirrup.]  ~Graduated Pipettes.~--Several varieties of these are required, viz.:  1. Pipettes of 1 c.c. capacity graduated in 0.1 c.c.  2. Pipettes of 1 c.c. capacity graduated in 0.01 c.c. (Fig. 10, a).  3. Pipettes of 10 c.c. capacity graduated in 0.1 c.c. (Fig. 10, b).  These should be about 30 cm. in length (1 and 2 of fairly narrow bore), graduated to the extreme point, and having at least a 10 cm. length of clear space between the first graduation and the upper end; the open mouth should be plugged with cotton-wool. Each variety should be sterilised and stored in a separate cylindrical copper case some 36 by 6 cm., with \"pull-off\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],["title","The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#2)"],["body",", upon which is stamped, in plain figures, the capacity of the contained pipettes.  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Measuring pipettes, a and b.]  The laboratory should also be provided with a complete set of \"Standard\" graduated pipettes, each pipette in the set being stamped and authenticated by a certificate from one of the recognised Physical Measurement Laboratories, such as Charlottenburg. These instruments are expensive and should be reserved solely for standardising the pipettes in ordinary use, and for calibrating small pipettes manufactured in the laboratory. Such a set should comprise, at least, pipettes delivering 10 c.c., 5 c.c., 2.5 c.c., 2 c.c., 1 c.c., 0.5 c.c., 0.25 c.c., 0.2 c.c., 0.1 c.c., 0.05 c.c., and 0.01 c.c., respectively.  In the immediately following sections are described small pieces of glass apparatus which should be prepared in the laboratory from glass tubing of various sizes. In their preparation three articles are essential; first a three-square hard-steel file or preferably a glass-worker's knife of hard Thuringian steel for cutting glass tubes etc.; next a blowpipe flame, for although much can be done with the ordinary Bunsen burner, a blowpipe flame makes for rapid work; and lastly a bat's-wing burner.  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Glass-cutting knife. a. handle. b. double edged blade. c. shaft. d. locking nut. e. spanner for nut.]  1. The glass-cutting knife. This article is sold in two forms, a bench knife (Fig. 11) and a pocket knife. The former is provided with a blade some 8 cm. in length and having two cutting edges. The cutting edge when examined in a strong light is seen to be composed of small closely set teeth, similar to those in a saw. The knife should be kept sharp by frequent stroppings on a sandstone hone. The pocket form, about 6-cm. long over all, consists of a small spring blade with one cutting edge mounted in scales like an ordinary pocket knife.  2. For real convenience of work the blowpipe should be mounted on a special table connected up with cylindrical bellows operated by a pedal. That figured (Fig. 12) is made by mounting a teak top 60 cm. square upon the uprights of an enclosed double-action concertina bellows (Enfer's) and provided with a Fletcher's Universal gas blowpipe.  3. An ordinary bat's-wing gas-burner mounted at the far corner of the table top is invaluable in the preparation of tubular apparatus with sharp curves, and for coating newly-made glass apparatus with a layer of soot to prevent too rapid cooling, and its usually associated result--cracking.  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Glass blower's table with Enfer's foot bellows.]  6. ~Sedimentation tubes 5×0.5~ cm., for sedimentation reactions, etc., and for containing small quantities of fluid to be centrifugalised in the hæmatocrit. These are made by taking 14-cm. lengths of stout glass tubing of the requisite diameter and heating the centre in the Bunsen or blowpipe flame. When the central portion is quite soft draw the ends quickly apart and then round off the pointed ends of the two test-tubes thus formed. With the glass-cutting knife cut off whatever may be necessary from the open ends to make the tubes the required length.  A rectangular block of \"plasticine\" (modelling clay) into which the conical ends can be thrust makes a very convenient stand for these small tubes.  ~Capillary Pipettes or Pasteur's Pipettes~ (Fig. 13 a).--These little instruments are invaluable, and a goodly supply should be kept on hand. They are prepared from soft-glass tubing of various-sized calibre (the most generally useful size being 8 mm. diameter) in the following manner: Hold a 10 cm. length of glass tube by each end, and whilst rotating it heat the central portion in the Bunsen flame or the blowpipe blast-flame until the glass is red hot and soft. Now remove it from the flame and steadily pull the ends apart, so drawing the heated portion out into a roomy capillary tube; break the capillary portion at its centre, seal the broken ends in the flame, and round off the edges of the open end of each pipette. A loose plug of cotton-wool in the open mouth completes the capillary pipette. After a number have been prepared, they are sterilised and stored in batches, either in metal cases similar to those used for the graduated pipettes or in large-sized test-tubes--sealed ends downward and plugged ends toward the mouth of the case.  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Capillary pipettes. a, b, c.]  The filling and emptying of the capillary pipette is most satisfactorily accomplished by slipping a small rubber teat (similar to that on a baby's feeding bottle but _not perforated_) on the upper end, after cutting or snapping off the sealed point of the capillary portion. If pressure is now exerted upon the elastic bulb by a finger and thumb whilst the capillary end is below the surface of the fluid to be taken up, some of the contained air will be driven out, and subsequent relaxation of that pressure (resulting in the formation of a partial vacuum) will cause the fluid to ascend the capillary tube. Subsequent compression of the bulb will naturally result in the complete expulsion of the fluid from the pipette (Fig. 14).  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Filling the capillary teat-pipette.]  A modification of this pipette, in which a constriction or short length of capillary tube is introduced just below the plugged mouth (Fig. 13, b), will also be found extremely useful in the collection and storage of morbid exudations.  A third form, where the capillary portion is about 4 or 5 cm. long and only forms a small fraction of the entire length of the pipette (Fig. 13, c), will also be found useful.  ~\"Blood\" Pipettes~ (Fig 15).--Special pipettes for the collection of fairly large quantities of blood (as suggested by Pakes) should also be prepared. These are made from _soft_ glass tubing of 1 cm. bore, in a similar manner to the Pasteur pipettes, except that the point of the blowpipe flame must be used in order to obtain the sharp shoulder at either end of the central bulb. The terminal tubes must retain a diameter of at least 1 mm., in order to avoid capillary action during the collection of the fluid.  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Blood pipettes and hair-lip pin in a test-tube.]  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Blood-pipette in metal thermometer case.]  For sterilisation and storage each pipette is placed inside a test-tube, resting on a wad of cotton-wool, and the tube plugged in the ordinary manner. As these tubes are used almost exclusively for blood work, it is usual to place a lance-headed hare-lip pin or a No. 9 flat Hagedorn needle inside the tube so that the entire outfit may be sterilised at one time.  For the collection of small quantities of blood for agglutination reactions and the like, many prefer a short straight piece of narrow glass tubing drawn out at either extremity to almost capillary dimensions. Such pipettes, about 8 cm. in length over all, are most conveniently sterilized in ordinary metal thermometer cases (Fig. 16).  ~Graduated Capillary Pipettes~ (Fig. 17).--These should also be made in the laboratory--from manometer tubing--of simple, convenient shape, and graduated by the aid of \"standard\" pipettes (in hundredths) to contain such quantities as 10, 50, and 90 c. mm., and carefully marked with a writing diamond. These, previously sterilised in large test-tubes, will be found extremely useful in preparing accurate percentage solutions, when only minute quantities of fluid are available.  [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Capillary graduated pipettes.]  ~Automatic (\"Throttle\") Pipettes.~--These ingenious pipettes, introduced by Wright, can easily be calibrated in the laboratory and are exceedingly useful for graduating small pipettes, for measuring small quantities of fluids, in preparing dilutions of serum for agglutination reactions, etc. They are usually made from the Capillary Pasteur pipettes (Fig. 13, a). The following description of the manufacture of a 5 c. mm. pipette will serve to show how the small automatic pipettes are calibrated.  1. Select a pipette the capillary portion of which is fairly roomy in bore and possesses regular even walls, and remove the cotton-wool plug from the open end.  2. Heat the capillary portion near the free extremity in the by-pass flame of the bunsen burner and draw it out into a very fine hair-like tube and break this across. This hair-like extremity will permit the passage of air but is too fine for metallic mercury to pass.  3. From a standard graduated pipette deliver 5 c. mm. clean mercury into the upper wide portion of the pipette.  4. Adjust a rubber teat to the pipette and by pressure on the bulb gradually drive the mercury in an unbroken column down the capillary tube until it is stopped by the filiform extremity.  5. Cut off the capillary tube exactly at the upper level of the column of mercury, invert it and allow the mercury to run out.  6. Snap off the remainder of the capillary tube from the broad upper portion of the pipette which is now destined to form the covering tube or air chamber, or what we may term the \"barrel.\" This barrel now has the lower end in the form of a truncated cone, the upper end being cut square. Remove the teat.  7. Introduce the capillary tube into this barrel with the filiform extremity uppermost, and the square cut end projecting about 0.5 cm. beyond the tapering end of the barrel.  [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Throttle pipette--small capacity.]  8. Drop a small pellet of sealing wax into the barrel by the side of the capillary tube and then warm the tube at the gas flame until the wax becomes softened and makes an air-tight joint between the capillary tube and the end of the barrel.  9. Fit a rubber teat to the open end of the barrel, and so complete a pipette which can be depended upon to always aspirate and deliver exactly 5 cm. of fluid.  Slight modification of this procedure is necessary in making tubes to measure larger volumes than say 75 c. mm. Thus to make "]]]
