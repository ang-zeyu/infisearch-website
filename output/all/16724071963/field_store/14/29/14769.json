[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27977"],["title","Austral English (#1)"],["body","so many new names were needed, and that there never will be such an occasion again, for never did settlers come, nor can they ever again come, upon Flora and Fauna so completely different from anything seen by them before.  When the offshoots of our race first began to settle in America, they found much that was new, but they were still in the same North Temperate zone.  Though there is now a considerable divergence between the American and the English vocabulary, especially in technical terms, it is not largely due to great differences in natural history.  An oak in America is still a <i>Quercus</i>, not as in Australia a <i>Casuarina</i>.  But with the whole tropical region intervening it was to be expected that in the South Temperate Zone many things would be different, and such expectation was amply fulfilled.  In early descriptions of Australia it is a sort of commonplace to dwell on this complete variety, to harp on the trees that shed bark not leaves, and the cherries with the stones outside.  Since the days when \"Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field\" never were so many new names called for.  Unfortunately, names were not given by the best educated in the community, but often by those least qualified to invent satisfactory names: not by a linguist, a botanist, an ornithologist, an ichthyologist, but by the ordinary settler. Even in countries of old civilisation names are frequently conferred or new words invented, at times with good and at times with unsatisfactory results, by the average man, whom it is the modern fashion to call \"the man in the street.\"  Much of Australasian nomenclature is due to \"the man in the bush\" --more precise address not recorded.  Givers of new names may be benefactors to their language or violators of its purity and simplicity, but in either case they are nearly always, like the burial-place of Moses, unknown.    III.  SOURCES OF NEW WORDS.   Of Australasian additions to the English language there are two main sources, which correspond to the twofold division of them into new words and new uses of old words.  1.  Altered English.  The commoner origin of Australasian English words is the turning and twisting of an already existing English name.  The settler saw a fruit somewhat like a cherry.  Though he knew well that it was not a cherry, he christened it the \"native cherry.\"  It may here be remarked that the prefix native is not a satisfactory distinguishing adjective.  Native bear, native cherry, may teach the young Australian that the bear and the cherry so named are not as the bear of the Arctic Regions or the cherry of Europe.  But in the British Museum the label does not help much.  The settler heard a bird laugh in what he thought an extremely ridiculous manner, its opening notes suggesting a donkey's bray--he called it the \"laughing jackass.\"  His descendants have dropped the adjective, and it has come to pass that the word \"jackass\" denotes to an Australian something quite different from its meaning to other speakers of our English tongue.  The settler must have had an imagination.  Whip-bird, or Coach-whip, from the sound of the note, Lyre-bird from the appearance of the outspread tail, are admirable names.  Another class of name brought the Australian word nearer to its English use.  \"Robin\" for instance is applied to birds of various species not known in Europe.  Bird-names, fish-names, plant-names, are sometimes transferred to new species, sometimes to a new genus, sometimes to an entirely different Natural Order, bearing a resemblance to the original, either real or fancied, as for instance \"Magpie.\"  It is hardly necessary to dwell longer on this point, for almost every page of the Dictionary bears witness to it.  2. Words new to the Language.  (a) Aboriginal Australian.  Many of the new Australasian words are taken from the languages of the aborigines, often with considerable alteration due to misunderstanding.  Such words are either Australian or Maori. Whilst in New Zealand careful attention has been paid by competent scholars to the musical Maori language, it can hardly be claimed that the Australian family of languages has ever been scientifically studied, though there is a heap of printed material--small grammars and lists of words--<i>rudis indigestaque moles</i>.  There is no doubt that the vocabularies used in different parts of Australia and Tasmania varied greatly, and equally little doubt that the languages, in structure and perhaps originally in vocabulary, were more or less connected.  About the year 1883, Professor Sayce, of Oxford, wrote a letter, which was published in <i>The Argus</i>, pointing out the obligation that lay upon the Australian colonies to make a scientific study of a vanishing speech.  The duty would be stronger were it not for the distressing lack of pence that now is vexing public men. Probably a sum of L300 a year would suffice for an educated inquirer, but his full time for several years would be needed. Such an one should be trained at the University as a linguist and an observer, paying especial attention to logic and to Comparative Philology.  Whilst the colonies neglect their opportunities, and Sibylla year by year withdraws her offer, perhaps \"the inevitable German\" will intervene, and in a well-arranged book bring order out of the chaos of vocabularies and small pamphlets on the subject, all that we have to trust to now.  The need of scientific accuracy is strong.  For the purposes of this Dictionary I have been investigating the origin of words, more or less naturalised as English, that come from aboriginal Australian, in number between seventy and a hundred.  I have received a great deal of kind assistance, many people taking much trouble to inform me.  But there is a manifest lack of knowledge.  Many supplied me with the meanings of the words as used in English, but though my appeal was scattered far and wide over Australia (chiefly through the kindness of the newspapers), few could really give the origin of the words. Two amongst the best informed went so far as to say that Australian words have no derivation.  That doctrine is hard to accept.  A word of three syllables does not spring complete from the brain of an aboriginal as Athene rose fully armed from the head of Zeus.  It is beyond all doubt that the vocabularies of the Aborigines differed widely in different parts.  Frequently, the English have carried a word known in one district to a district where it was not known, the aboriginals regarding the word as pure English.  In several books statements will be found that such and such a word is not Aboriginal, when it really has an aboriginal source but in a different part of the Continent. Mr. Threlkeld, in his <i>Australian Grammar</i>, which is especially concerned with the language of the Hunter River, gives a list of \"barbarisms,\" words that he considers do not belong to the aboriginal tongue.  He says with perfect truth-\"Barbarisms have crept into use, introduced by sailors, stockmen, and others, in the use of which both blacks and whites labour under the mistaken idea, that each one is conversing in the other's language.\"  And yet with him a \"barbarism\" has to be qualified as meaning \"not belonging to the Hunter District.\"  But Mr. Threlkeld is not the only writer who will not acknowledge as aboriginal sundry words with an undoubted Australian pedigree.  (b) Maori.  The Maori language, the Italian of the South, has received very different treatment from that meted out by fate and indifference to the aboriginal tongues of Australia.  It has been studied by competent scholars, and its grammar has been comprehensively arranged and stated.  A Maori Dictionary, compiled more than fifty years ago by a missionary, afterwards a bishop, has been issued in a fourth edition by his son, who is now a bishop.  Yet, of Maori also, the same thing is said with respect to etymology.  A Maori scholar told me that, when he began the study many years ago, he was warned by a very distinguished scholar not to seek for derivations, as the search was full of pitfalls.  It was not maintained that words sprang up without an origin, but that the true origin of most of the words was now lost.  In spite of this double warning, it may be maintained that some of the origins both of Maori and of Australian words have been found and are in this book recorded.  The pronunciation of Maori words differs so widely from that of Australian aboriginal names that it seems advisable to insert a note on the subject.  Australian aboriginal words have been written down on no system, and very much at hap-hazard.  English people have attempted to express the native sounds phonetically according to English pronunciation.  No definite rule has been observed, different persons giving totally different values to represent the consonant and vowel sounds.  In a language with a spelling so unphonetic as the English, in which the vowels especially have such uncertain and variable values, the results of this want of system have necessarily been very unsatisfactory and often grotesque.  Maori words, on the other hand, have been written down on a simple and consistent system, adopted by the missionaries for the purpose of the translation of the Bible. This system consists in giving the Italian sound to the vowels, every letter--vowel and consonant--having a fixed and invariable value.  Maori words are often very melodious.  In pronunciation the best rule is to pronounce each syllable with a nearly equal accent.  Care has been taken to remember that this is an Australasian <i>English</i> and not a Maori Dictionary; therefore to exclude words that have not passed into the speech of the settlers. But in New Zealand Maori is much more widely used in the matter of vocabulary than the speech of the aborigines is in Australia, or at any rate in the more settled parts of Australia; and the Maori is in a purer form."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27977"],["title","Austral English (#2)"],["body","  Though some words and names have been ridiculously corrupted, the language of those who dwell in the bush in New Zealand can hardly be called <i>Pigeon English</i>, and that is the right name for the \"lingo\" used in Queensland and Western Australia, which, only partly represented in this book, is indeed a falling away from the language of Bacon and Shakspeare.    IV.  LAW OF HOBSON-JOBSON.   In many places in the Dictionary, I find I have used the expression \"the law of Hobson-Jobson.\"  The name is an adaptation from the expression used by Col. Yule and Mr. Burnell as a name for their interesting Dictionary of Anglo-Indian words.  The law is well recognised, though it has lacked the name, such as I now venture to give it.  When a word comes from a foreign language, those who use it, not understanding it properly, give a twist to the word or to some part of it from the hospitable desire to make the word at home in its new quarters, no regard, however, being paid to the sense.  The most familiar instance in English is <i>crayfish</i> from the French <i>ecrevisse</i>, though it is well known that a crayfish is not a fish at all.  Amongst the Mohammedans in India there is a festival at which the names of \"Hassan\" and \"Hosein\" are frequently called out by devotees. Tommy Atkins, to whom the names were naught, converted them into \"Hobson, Jobson.\"  That the practice of so altering words is not limited to the English is shown by two perhaps not very familiar instances in French, where \"Aunt Sally\" has become <i>ane sale</i>, \"a dirty donkey,\" and \"bowsprit\" has become <i>beau pre</i>, though quite unconnected with \"a beautiful meadow.\"  The name \"Pigeon English\" is itself a good example. It has no connection with pigeon, the bird, but is an Oriental's attempt to pronounce the word \"business.\"  It hardly, however, seems necessary to alter the spelling to \"pidjin.\"  It may be thought by some precisians that all Australasian English is a corruption of the language.  So too is Anglo-Indian, and, <i>pace</i> Mr. Brander Matthews, there are such things as Americanisms, which were not part of the Elizabethan heritage, though it is perfectly true that many of the American phrases most railed at are pure old English, preserved in the States, though obsolete in Modern England; for the Americans, as Lowell says, \"could not take with them any better language than that of Shakspeare.\"  When we hear railing at slang phrases, at Americanisms, some of which are admirably expressive, at various flowers of colonial speech, and at words woven into the texture of our speech by those who live far away from London and from Oxford, and who on the outskirts of the British Empire are brought into contact with new natural objects that need new names, we may think for our comfort on the undoubted fact that the noble and dignified language of the poets, authors and preachers, grouped around Lewis XIV., sprang from debased Latin.  For it was not the classical Latin that is the origin of French, but the language of the soldiers and the camp-followers who talked slang and picked words up from every quarter.  English has certainly a richer vocabulary, a finer variety of words to express delicate distinctions of meaning, than any language that is or that ever was spoken: and this is because it has always been hospitable in the reception of new words.  It is too late a day to close the doors against new words.  This <i>Austral English Dictionary</i> merely catalogues and records those which at certain doors have already come in.    V.  CLASSIFICATION OF THE WORDS.   The Dictionary thus includes the following classes of Words, Phrases and Usages; viz.--  (1) Old English names of Natural Objects--Birds, Fishes, Animals, Trees, Plants, etc.--applied (in the first instance by the early settlers) either to new Australian species of such objects, or to new objects bearing a real or fancied resemblance to them--as <i>Robin, Magpie, Herring, Cod, Cat, Bear, Oak, Beech, Pine, Cedar, Cherry, Spinach, Hops, Pea, Rose</i>.  (2) English names of objects applied in Australia to others quite different-as <i>Wattle</i>, a hurdle, applied as the name of the tree <i>Wattle</i>, from whose twigs the hurdle was most readily made; <i>Jackass</i>, an animal, used as the name for the bird <i>Jackass</i>; <i>Cockatoo</i>, a birdname, applied to a small farmer.  (3) Aboriginal Australian and Maori words which have been incorporated unchanged in the language, and which still denote the original object--as <i>Kangaroo, Wombat, Boomerang, Whare, Pa, Kauri</i>.  (4) Aboriginal Australian and Maori words which have been similarly adopted, and which have also had their original meaning extended and applied to other things--as <i>Bunyip, Corrobbery, Warrigal</i>.  (5) Anglicised corruptions of such words--as <i>Copper-Maori, Go-ashore, Cock-a-bully, Paddy-melon, Pudding-ball, Tooky-took</i>.  (6) Fanciful, picturesque, or humorous names given to new Australasian Natural Objects--as <i>Forty-spot, Lyre-bird, Parson-bird, and Coach-whip</i> (birds); <i>Wait-a-while</i> (a tangled thicket); <i>Thousand-jacket, Jimmy Low, Jimmy Donnelly, and Roger Gough</i> (trees); <i>Axe-breaker, Cheese-wood, and Raspberry Jam</i> (timbers); <i>Trumpeter, Schnapper and Sergeant Baker</i> (fishes); <i>Umbrella-grass</i> and <i>Spaniard</i> (native plants), and so on.  (7) Words and phrases of quite new coinage, or arising from quite new objects or orders of things--as <i>Larrikin, Swagman, Billy, Free-selector, Boundary-rider, Black-tracker, Back-blocks, Clear-skin, Dummyism, Bushed.</i>  (8) Scientific names arising exclusively from Australasian necessities, chiefly to denote or describe new Natural Orders, Genera, or Species confined or chiefly appertaining to Australia--as <i>Monotreme, Petrogale, Clianthus, Ephthianura, Dinornis, Eucalypt, Boronia, Ornithorhynchus, Banksia</i>.  (9) Slang (of which the element is comparatively small)-- as <i>Deepsinker, Duck-shoving, Hoot, Slushy, Boss-cockie, On-the-Wallaby</i>.    VI. QUOTATIONS.  With certain exceptions, this Dictionary is built up, as a Dictionary should be, on quotations, and these are very copious.  It may even be thought that their number is too large.  It is certainly larger, and in some places the quotations themselves are much longer, than could ever be expected in a general Dictionary of the English Language.  This copiousness is, however, the advantage of a special Dictionary. The intention of the quotations is to furnish evidence that a word is used as an English word; and many times the quotation itself furnishes a satisfactory explanation of the meaning.  I hope, however, I shall not be held responsible for all the statements in the quotations, even where attention is not drawn to their incorrectness.  Sundry Australasian uses of words are given in other dictionaries, as, for instance, in the parts already issued of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> and in <i>The Century</i>, but the space that can be allotted to them in such works is of necessity too small for full explanation. Efforts have been made to select such quotations as should in themselves be interesting, picturesque, and illustrative.  In a few cases they may even be humorous.  Moreover, the endeavour has been constant to obtain quotations from all parts of the Australasian Colonies--from books that describe different parts of Australasia, and from newspapers published far and wide.  I am conscious that in the latter division Melbourne papers predominate, but this has been due to the accident that living in Melbourne I see more of the Melbourne papers, whilst my friends have sent me more quotations from books and fewer from newspapers.  The quotations, however, are not all explanatory.  Many times a quotation is given merely to mark the use of a word at a particular epoch.  Quotations are all carefully dated and arranged in their historical order, and thus the exact chronological development of a word has been indicated.  The practice of the `O.E.D.' has been followed in this respect and in the matter of quotations generally, though as a rule the titles of books quoted have been more fully expressed here than in that Dictionary.  Early quotations have been sought with care, and a very respectable antiquity, about a century, has been thus found for some Australasian words.  As far as possible, the spelling, the stops, the capitals, and the italics of the original have been preserved.  The result is often a rich variety of spelling the same word in consecutive extracts.  The last decade has been a very active time in Australian science.  A great deal of system has been brought into its study, and much rearrangement of classification has followed as the result.  Both among birds and plants new species have been distinguished and named: and there has been not a little change in nomenclature.  This Dictionary, it must be remembered, is chiefly concerned with vernacular names, but for proper identification, wherever possible, the scientific name is added.  In some cases, where there has been a recent change in the latter, both the new and the older names are recorded.    VII.  AUTHORITIES.   The less-known birds, fishes, plants, and trees are in many cases not illustrated by quotations, but have moved to their places in the Dictionary from lists of repute.  Many books have been written on the Natural History of Australia and New Zealand, and these have been placed under contribution.  Under the head of Botany no book has been of greater service than Maiden's <i>Useful Native Plants</i>.  Unfortunately many scientific men scorn vernacular names, but Mr. Maiden has taken the utmost pains with them, and has thereby largely increased the utility of his volume.  For Tasmania there is Mr. Spicer's <i>Handbook of Tasmanian Plants</i>; for New Zealand, Kirk's <i>Forest Flora</i> and Hooker's <i>Botany</i>.  For Australian animals Lydekker's <i>Marsupials and Monotremes</i> is"]]]
