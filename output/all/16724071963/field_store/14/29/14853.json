In these series, the Museum publishes original articles and monographs dealing with the collections and work of its constituent museums--The Museum of Natural History and the Museum of History and Technology--setting forth newly acquired facts in the fields of anthropology, biology, history, geology, and technology. Copies of each publication are distributed to libraries, to cultural and scientific organizations, and to specialists and others interested in the different subjects.  The _Proceedings_, begun in 1878, are intended for the publication, in separate form, of shorter papers from the Museum of Natural History. These are gathered in volumes, octavo in size, with the publication date of each paper recorded in the table of contents of the volume.  In the _Bulletin_ series, the first of which was issued in 1875, appear longer, separate publications consisting of monographs (occasionally in several parts) and volumes in which are collected works on related subjects. _Bulletins_ are either octavo or quarto in size, depending on the needs of the presentation. Since 1902 papers relating to the botanical collections of the Museum of Natural History have been published in the _Bulletin_ series under the heading _Contributions from the United States National Herbarium_, and since 1959, in _Bulletins_ titled \"Contributions from the Museum of History and Technology,\" have been gathered shorter papers relating to the collections and research of that Museum.

White_   The \"PIONEER\": LIGHT PASSENGER LOCOMOTIVE of 1851  _In the Museum of History and Technology_       _In the mid-nineteenth century there was a renewed interest in     the light, single-axle locomotives which were proving so very     successful for passenger traffic. These engines were built in     limited number by nearly every well-known maker, and among the     few remaining is the 6-wheel \"Pioneer,\" on display in the Museum     of History and Technology, Smithsonian Institution. This     locomotive is a true representation of a light passenger     locomotive of 1851 and a historic relic of the mid-nineteenth     century._      THE AUTHOR: _John H. White is associate curator of     transportation in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of     History and Technology._   The \"PIONEER\" is an unusual locomotive and on first inspection would seem to be imperfect for service on an American railroad of the 1850's. This locomotive has only one pair of driving wheels and no truck, an arrangement which marks it as very different from the highly successful standard 8-wheel engine of this period. All six wheels of the _Pioneer_ are rigidly attached to the frame. It is only half the size of an 8-wheel engine of 1851 and about the same size of the 4--2--0 so common in this country some 20 years earlier. Its general arrangement is that of the rigid English locomotive which had, years earlier, proven unsuitable for use on U.S. railroads.  These objections are more apparent than real, for the _Pioneer_, and other engines of the same design, proved eminently successful when used in the service for which they were built, that of light passenger traffic. The _Pioneer's_ rigid wheelbase is no problem, for when it is compared to that of an 8-wheel engine it is found to be about four feet less; and its small size is no problem when we realize it was not intended for heavy service. Figure 2, a diagram, is a comparison of the _Pioneer_ and a standard 8-wheel locomotive.  Since the service life of the _Pioneer_ was spent on the Cumberland Valley Railroad, a brief account of that line is necessary to an understanding of the service history of this locomotive.      _Exhibits of the \"Pioneer\"_      The _Pioneer_ has been a historic relic since 1901. In the fall     of that year minor repairs were made to the locomotive so that     it might be used in the sesquicentennial celebration at     Carlisle, Pennsylvania. On October 22, 1901, the engine was     ready for service, but as it neared Carlisle a copper flue     burst. The fire was extinguished and the _Pioneer_ was pushed     into town by another engine. In the twentieth century, the     _Pioneer_ was displayed at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition,     St. Louis, Missouri, in 1904, and at the Wheeling, West     Virginia, semicentennial in 1913. In 1927 it joined many other     historic locomotives at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's \"Fair     of the Iron Horse\" which commemorated the first one hundred     years of that company. From about 1913 to 1925 the _Pioneer_     also appeared a number of times at the Apple-blossom Festival     at Winchester, Virginia. In 1933-1934 it was displayed at the     World's Fair in Chicago, and in 1948 at the Railroad Fair in the     same city. Between 1934 and March 1947 it was exhibited at the     Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.   The Cumberland Valley Railroad  The Cumberland Valley Railroad (C.V.R.R.) was chartered on April 2, 1831, to connect the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers by a railroad through the Cumberland Valley in south-central Pennsylvania. The Cumberland Valley, with its rich farmland and iron-ore deposits, was a natural north-south route long used as a portage between these two rivers. Construction began in 1836, and because of the level valley some 52 miles of line was completed between Harrisburg and Chambersburg by November 16, 1837. In 1860, by way of the Franklin Railroad, the line extended to Hagerstown, Maryland. It was not until 1871 that the Cumberland Valley Railroad reached its projected southern terminus, the Potomac River, by extending to Powells Bend, Maryland. Winchester, Virginia, was entered in 1890 giving the Cumberland Valley Railroad about 165 miles of line. The railroad which had become associated with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1859, was merged with that company in 1919.  By 1849 the Cumberland Valley Railroad was in poor condition; the strap-rail track was worn out and new locomotives were needed. Captain Daniel Tyler was hired to supervise rebuilding the line with T-rail, and easy grades and curves. Tyler recommended that a young friend of his, Alba F. Smith, be put in charge of modernizing and acquiring new equipment. Smith recommended to the railroad's Board of Managers on June 25, 1851, that \"much lighter engines than those now in use may be substituted for the passenger transportation and thereby effect a great saving both in point of fuel and road repairs....\"[1] Smith may well have gone on to explain that the road was operating 3- and 4-car passenger trains with a locomotive weighing about 20 tons; the total weight was about 75 tons, equalling the uneconomical deadweight of 1200 pounds per passenger. Since speed was not an important consideration (30 mph being a good average), the use of lighter engines would improve the deadweight-to-passenger ratio and would not result in a slower schedule.  The Board of Managers agreed with Smith's recommendations and instructed him \"... to examine the two locomotives lately built by Mr. Wilmarth and now in the [protection?] of Captain Tyler at Norwich and if in his judgment they are adequate to our wants ... have them forwarded to the road.\"[2] Smith inspected the locomotives not long after this resolution was passed, for they were on the road by the time he made the following report[3] to the Board on September 24, 1851:      In accordance with a resolution passed at the last meeting of     your body relative to the small engines built by Mr. Wilmarth I     proceeded to Norwich to make trial of their capacity--fitness or     suitability to the Passenger transportation of our Road--and     after as thorough a trial as circumstances would admit (being on     another Road than our own) I became satisfied that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28160"],["title","The 'Pioneer': Light Passenger Locomotive of 1851 (#1)"],["body","some     necessary improvements which would not be expensive (and are now     being made at our shop) the engines would do the business of     our Road not only in a manner satisfactory in point of speed and     certainty but with greater ultimate economy in Expenses than has     before been practised in this Country.  [Illustration: Figure 2.--DIAGRAM COMPARING the _Pioneer_ (shaded drawing) with the _Columbia_, a standard 8-wheel engine of 1851. (Drawing by J. H. White.)]      _Columbia_      Hudson River Railroad     Lowell Machine Shop, 1852     Wt. 27-1/2 tons (engine only)     Cyl. 16-1/2 x 22 inches     Wheel diam. 84 inches      _Pioneer_      Cumberland Valley Railroad     Seth Wilmarth, 1851     12-1/2 tons     8-1/2 x 14 inches     54 inches      After making the above trial of the Engines--I stated to your     Hon. President the result of the trial--with my opinion of their     Capacity to carry our passenger trains at the speed required     which was decidedly in favor of the ability of the Engines. He     accordingly agreed that the Engines should at once be forwarded     to the Road in compliance with the Resolution of your Board. I     immediately ordered the Engines shipped at the most favorable     rates. They came to our Road safely in the Condition in which     they were shipped. One of the Engines has been placed on the     Road and I believe performed in such a manner as to convince all     who are able to judge of this ability to perform--although the     maximum duty of the Engines was not performed on account of some     original defects which are now being remedied as I before     stated.      Within ten days the Engine will be able to run regularly with a     train on the Road where in shall be enabled to judge correctly     of their merits.      An accident occurred during the trial of the Small Engine at     Norwich which caused a damage of about $300 in which condition     the Engine came here and is now being repaired--the cost of     which will be presented to your Board hereafter. As to the     fault or blame of parties connected with the accident as also     the question of responsibility for Repairs are questions for     your disposal. I therefore leave the matter until further called     upon.      The Expenses necessarily incurred by the trial of the Engines     and also the Expenses of transporting the same are not included     in the Statement herewith presented, the whole amount of which     will not probably exceed $400.00.  These two locomotives became the Cumberland Valley Railroad's _Pioneer_ (number 13) and _Jenny Lind_ (number 14). While Smith notes that one of the engines was damaged during the inspection trials, Joseph Winters, an employee of the Cumberland Valley who claimed he was accompanying the engine enroute to Chambersburg at the time of their delivery, later recalled that both engines were damaged in transit.[4] According to Winters a train ran into the rear of the _Jenny Lind_, damaging both it and the _Pioneer_, the accident occurring near Middletown, Pennsylvania. The _Jenny Lind_ was repaired at Harrisburg but the _Pioneer_, less seriously damaged, was taken for repairs to the main shops of the Cumberland Valley road at Chambersburg.  [Illustration: Figure 3.--\"PIONEER,\" ABOUT 1901, showing the sandbox and large headlamp. Note the lamp on the cab roof, now used as the headlight. (Smithsonian photo 49272.)]  While there seems little question that these locomotives were not built as a direct order for the Cumberland Valley Railroad, an article[5] appearing in the _Railroad Advocate_ in 1855 credits their design to Smith. The article speaks of a 2--2--4 built for the Macon and Western Railroad and says in part:      This engine is designed and built very generally upon the ideas,     embodied in some small tank engines designed by A. F. Smith,     Esq., for the Cumberland Valley road. Mr. Smith is a strong     advocate of light engines, and his novel style and proportions     of engines, as built for him a few years since, by Seth     Wilmarth, at Boston, are known to some of our readers. Without     knowing all the circumstances under which these engines are     worked on the Cumberland Valley road, we should not venture to     repeat all that we have heard of their performances, it is     enough to say that they are said to do more, in proportion to     their weight, than any other engines now in use.  The author believes that the _Railroad Advocate's_ claim of Smith's design of the _Pioneer_ has been confused with his design of the _Utility_ (figs. 6, 7). Smith designed this compensating-lever engine to haul trains over the C.V.R.R. bridge at Harrisburg. It was built by Wilmarth in 1854.  [Illustration: Figure 4.--MAP OF THE CUMBERLAND VALLEY Railroad as it appeared in 1919.]  According to statements of Smith and the Board of Managers quoted on page 244, the _Pioneer_ and the _Jenny Lind_ were not new when purchased from their maker, Seth Wilmarth. Although of recent manufacture, previous to June 1851, they were apparently doing service on a road in Norwich, Connecticut. It should be mentioned that both Smith and Tyler were formerly associated with the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and they probably learned of these two engines through this former association. It is possible that the engines were purchased from Wilmarth by the Cumberland Valley road, which had bought several other locomotives from Wilmarth in previous years. It was the practice of at least one other New England engine builder, the Taunton Locomotive Works, to manufacture engines on the speculation that a buyer would be found; if no immediate buyers appeared the engine was leased to a local road until a sale was made.[6]  [Illustration: Figure 5.--AN EARLY BROADSIDE of the Cumberland Valley Railroad.]  Regarding the _Jenny Lind_ and _Pioneer_, Smith reported[7] to the Board of Managers at their meeting of March 17, 1852:      The small tank engines which were purchased last year ... and     which I spoke in a former report as undergoing at that time some     necessary improvements have since that time been fairly tested     as to their capacity to run our passenger trains and proved to     be equal to the duty.      The improvements proposed to be made have been completed only on     one engine [_Jenny Lind_] which is now running regularly with     passenger trains--the cost of repairs and improvements on this     engine (this being the one accidentally broken on the trial)     amounted to $476.51. The other engine is now in the shop, not     yet ready for service but will be at an early day.  [Illustration: Figure 6.--THE \"UTILITY\" AS REBUILT TO AN 8-WHEEL ENGINE, about 1863 or 1864. It was purchased by the Carlisle Manufacturing Co. in 1882 and was last used in 1896. (Smithsonian photo 36716F.)]  [Illustration: Figure 7.--THE \"UTILITY,\" DESIGNED BY SMITH A. F. and constructed by Seth Wilmarth in 1854, was built to haul trains across the bridge at Harrisburg, Pa.]  [Illustration: Figure 8.--THE EARLIEST KNOWN ILLUSTRATION of the _Pioneer_, drawn by A. S. Hull, master mechanic of the Cumberland Valley Railroad in 1876. It depicts the engine as it appeared in 1871. (_Courtesy of Paul Westhaeffer._)]  The _Pioneer_ and _Jenny Lind_ achieved such success in action that the president of the road, Frederick Watts, commented on their performance in the annual report of the Cumberland Valley Railroad for 1851. Watts stated that since their passenger trains were rarely more than a baggage car and two coaches, the light locomotives \"... have been found to be admirably adapted to our business.\" The Cumberland Valley Railroad, therefore, added two more locomotives of similar design in the next few years. These engines were the _Boston_ and the _Enterprise_, also built by Wilmarth in 1854-1855.  Watts reported the _Pioneer_ and _Jenny Lind_ cost $7,642. A standard 8-wheel engine cost about $6,500 to $8,000 each during this period. In recent years, the Pennsylvania Railroad has stated the _Pioneer_ cost $6,200 in gold, but is unable to give the source for this information. The author can discount this statement for it does not seem reasonable that a light, cheap engine of the pattern of the _Pioneer_ could cost as much as a machine nearly twice its size.  [Illustration: Figure 9.--ANNUAL PASS of the Cumberland Valley Railroad issued in 1863.]  [Illustration: Figure 10.--TIMETABLE OF THE Cumberland Valley Railroad for 1878.]   Service History of the _Pioneer_  After being put in service, the _Pioneer_ continued to perform well and was credited as able to move a 4-car passenger train along smartly at 40 mph.[8] This tranquility was shattered in October 1862 by a raiding party led by Confederate General J. E. B. Stuart which burned the Chambersburg shops of the Cumberland Valley Railroad. The _Pioneer_, _Jenny Lind_, and _Utility_ were partially destroyed. The Cumberland Valley Railroad in its report for 1862 stated:      The Wood-shop, Machine-shop, Black-smith-shop, Engine-house,     Wood-sheds, and Passenger Depot were totally consumed, and with     the Engine-house three second-class Engines were much injured by     the fire, but not so destroyed but that they may be restored to     usefulness.  However, no record can be found of the extent or exact nature of the damage. The shops and a number of cars were burned so it is reasonable to assume that the cab and other wooden parts of the locomotive were damaged. One unverified report in the files of the Pennsylvania Railroad states that part of the roof and brick wall fell on the _Pioneer_ during the fire causing considerable damage. In June 1864 the Chambersburg shops were again burned by the Confederates, but on this occasion the railroad managed to remove all its locomotives before the raid. During the Civil War, the Cumberland Valley Railroad was obliged to operate longer passenger trains to satisfy the enlarged traffic. The _Pioneer_ and "]]]
