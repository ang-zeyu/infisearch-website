The injustice of the abuse heaped upon it would become apparent to its harshest critics from a few of its maxims and rules of conduct, such as the following: Be of them that are persecuted, not of the persecutors.--Be the cursed, not he that curses.--They that are persecuted, and do not persecute, that are vilified and do not retort, that act in love, and are cheerful even in suffering, they are the lovers of God.--Bless God for the good as well as the evil. When thou hearest of a death, say, \"Blessed be the righteous Judge.\"--Life is like unto a fleeting shadow. Is it the shadow of a tower or of a bird? It is the shadow of a bird in its flight. Away flies the bird, and neither bird nor shadow remains behind.--Repentance and good works are the aim of all earthly wisdom.--Even the just will not have so high a place in heaven as the truly repentant.--He whose learning surpasses his good works is like a tree with many branches and few roots, which a wind-storm uproots and casts to the ground. But he whose good works surpass his learning is like a tree with few branches and many roots; all the winds of heaven cannot move it from its place.--There are three crowns: the crown of the Law, the crown of the priesthood, the crown of kingship. But greater than all is the crown of a good name.--Four there are that cannot enter Paradise: the scoffer, the liar, the hypocrite, and the backbiter.--Beat the gods, and the priests will tremble.--Contrition is better than many flagellations.--When the pitcher falls upon the stone, woe unto the pitcher; when the stone falls upon the pitcher, woe unto the pitcher; whatever betides, woe unto the pitcher.--The place does not honor the man, the man honors the place.--He who humbles himself will be exalted; he who exalts himself will be humbled,--Whosoever pursues greatness, from him will greatness flee; whosoever flees from greatness, him will greatness pursue.--Charity is as important as all other virtues combined.--Be tender and yielding like a reed, not hard and proud like a cedar.--The hypocrite will not see God.--It is not sufficient to be innocent before God; we must show our innocence to the world.--The works encouraged by a good man are better than those he executes.--Woe unto him that practices usury, he shall not live; whithersoever he goes, he carries injustice and death.  The same Talmud that fills chapter after chapter with minute legal details and hairsplitting debates outlines with a few strokes the most ideal conception of life, worth more than theories and systems of religious philosophy. A Haggada passage says: Six hundred and thirteen injunctions were given by Moses to the people of Israel. David reduced them to eleven; the prophet Isaiah classified these under six heads; Micah enumerated only three: \"What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.\" Another prophet limited them to two: \"Keep ye judgment, and do righteousness.\" Amos put all the commandments under one: \"Seek ye me, and ye shall live\"; and Habakkuk said: \"The just shall live by his faith.\"--This is the ethics of the Talmud.  Another characteristic manifestation of the idealism of the Talmud is its delicate feeling for women and children. Almost extravagant affection is displayed for the little ones. All the verses of Scripture that speak of flowers and gardens are applied in the Talmud to children and schools. Their breath sustains the moral order of the universe: \"Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings has God founded His might.\" They are called flowers, stars, the anointed of God. When God was about to give the Law, He demanded of the Israelites pledges to assure Him that they would keep His commandments holy. They offered the patriarchs, but each one of them had committed some sin. They named Moses as their surety; not even he was guiltless. Then they said: \"Let our children be our hostages.\" The Lord accepted them.  Similarly, there are many expressions to show that woman was held in high esteem by the rabbis of the Talmud: Love thy wife as thyself; honor her more than thyself.--In choosing a wife, descend a step.--If thy wife is small, bend and whisper into her ear.--God's altar weeps for him that forsakes the love of his youth.--He who sees his wife die before him has, as it were, been present at the destruction of the sanctuary itself; around him the world grows dark.--It is woman alone through whom God's blessings are vouchsafed to a house.--The children of him that marries for money shall be a curse unto him,--a warning singularly applicable to the circumstances of our own times.  The peculiar charm of the Haggada is best revealed in its legends and tales, its fables and myths, its apologues and allegories, its riddles and songs. The starting-point of the Haggada usually is some memory of the great past. It entwines and enmeshes in a magic network the lives of the patriarchs, prophets, and martyrs, and clothes with fresh, luxuriant green the old ideals and figures, giving them new life for a remote generation. The teachers of the Haggada allow no opportunity, sad or merry, to pass without utilizing it in the guise of an apologue or parable. Alike for wedding-feasts and funerals, for banquets and days of fasting, the garden of the Haggada is rifled of its fragrant blossoms and luscious fruits. Simplicity, grace, and childlike merriment pervade its fables, yet they are profound, even sublime, in their truth. \"Their chief and enduring charm is their fathomless depth, their unassuming loveliness.\" Poems constructed with great artistic skill do not occur. Here and there a modest bud of lyric poesy shyly raises its head, like the following couplet, describing a celebrated but ill-favored rabbi:      \"Without charm of form and face.     But a mind of rarest grace.\"  Over the grave of the same teacher the Talmud wails:      \"The Holy Land did beautify what womb of Shinar gave;     And now Tiberias' tear-filled eye weeps o'er her treasure's grave.\"  On seeing the dead body of the Patriarch Yehuda, a rabbi laments:      \"Angels strove to win the testimony's ark.     Men they overcame; lo! vanished is the ark!\"  Another threnody over some prince in the realm of the intellect:      \"The cedar hath by flames been seized;     Can hyssop then be saved?     Leviathan with hook was caught;     Alas! ye little fish!     The deep and mighty stream ran dry,     Ah woe! ye shallow brooks!\"  Nor is humor lacking. \"Ah, hamper great, with books well-filled, thou'rt gone!\" is a bookworm's eulogy.  Poets naturally have not been slow to avail themselves of the material stored in the Haggada. Many of its treasures, tricked out in modern verse, have been given to the world. The following are samples:[16]      BIRTH AND DEATH      \"His hands fast clenched, his fingers firmly clasped,     So man this life begins.     He claims earth's wealth, and constitutes himself     The heir of all her gifts.     He thinks his hand may snatch and hold     Whatever life doth yield.      But when at last the end has come,     His hands are open wide,     No longer closed. He knoweth now full well,     That vain were all his hopes.     He humbly says, 'I go, and nothing take     Of all my hands have wrought.'\"  The next, \"Interest and Usury,\" may serve to give the pertinacious opponent of the Talmud a better opinion of its position on financial subjects:      \"Behold! created things of every kind       Lend each to each. The day from night doth take,       And night from day; nor do they quarrel make     Like men, who doubting one another's mind,     E'en while they utter friendly words, think ill.       The moon delighted helps the starry host,       And each returns her gift without a boast.     'Tis only when the Lord supreme doth will     That earth in gloom shall be enwrapped,       He tells the moon: 'Refrain, keep back thy light!'       And quenches, too, the myriad lamps of night.     From wisdom's fount hath knowledge ofttimes lapped,     While wisdom humbly doth from knowledge learn.       The skies drop blessings on the grateful earth,       And she--of precious store there is no dearth--     Exhales and sends aloft a fair return.     Stern law with mercy tempers its decree,       And mercy acts with strength by justice lent.       Good deeds are based on creed from heaven sent,     In which, in turn, the sap of deeds must be.       Each creature borrows, lends, and gives with love,       Nor e'er disputes, to honor God above.      When man, howe'er, his fellowman hath fed,       Then 'spite the law forbidding interest,       He thinketh naught but cursèd gain to wrest.     Who taketh usury methinks hath said:     'O Lord, in beauty has Thy earth been wrought!       But why should men for naught enjoy its plains?       Ask usance, since 'tis Thou that sendest rains.     Have they the trees, their fruits, and blossoms bought?     For all they here enjoy, Thy int'rest claim:       For heaven's orbs that shine by day and night,       Th' immortal soul enkindled by Thy light,     And for the wondrous structure of their frame.'     But God replies: 'Now come, and see! I give       With open, bounteous hand, yet nothing take;       The earth yields wealth, nor must return ye make.     But know, O men, that only while ye live,     You may enjoy these gifts of my award.       The capital's mine, and surely I'll demand       The spirit in you planted by my hand,     And also earth will claim her due reward.'       Man's dust to dust is gathered in the grave,       His soul returns to God who gracious gave.\"  R. Yehuda ben Zakkaï answers his pupils who ask:      \"Why doth the Law with them more harshly deal       That filch a lamb from fold away,     Than with the highwaymen who shameless steal       Thy purse by force in open day?\"      \"Because in like esteem"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27902"],["title","A Bird-Lover in the West (#0)"],["body","the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net            A BIRD-LOVER IN THE WEST    BY   OLIVE THORNE MILLER      BOSTON AND NEW YORK  HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN AND COMPANY  The Riverside Press, Cambridge  1900      Copyright, 1894,  BY H.

Trust me, 't is something to be cast  Face to face with one's self at last,  To be taken out of the fuss and strife,  The endless clatter of plate and knife,    The bore of books, and the bores of the street,  From the singular mess we agree to call Life.          *       *       *       *       *     And to be set down on one's own two feet  So nigh to the great warm heart of God,    You almost seem to feel it beat  Down from the sunshine and up from the sod;    To be compelled, as it were, to notice  All the beautiful changes and chances  Through which the landscape flits and glances,      And to see how the face of common day      Is written all over with tender histories.   JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.     A BIRD-LOVER IN THE WEST.     I.  CAMPING IN COLORADO.   This chronicle of happy summer days with the birds and the flowers, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, begins in the month of May, in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-two.  As my train rolled quietly out of Jersey City late at night, I uttered a sigh of gratitude that I was really off; that at last I could rest. Up to the final moment I had been hurried and worried, but the instant I was alone, with my \"section\" to myself, I \"took myself in hand,\" as is my custom.  At the risk of seeming to stray very far from my subject, I want at this point to say something about rest, the greatly desired state that all busy workers are seeking, with such varying success.  A really re-creative recreation I sought for years, and   \"I've found some wisdom in my quest  That's richly worth retailing,\"  and that cannot be too often repeated, or too urgently insisted upon. What is imperatively needed, the sole and simple secret of rest, is this: To go to our blessed mother Nature, and to go with the whole being, mind and heart as well as body. To deposit one's physical frame in the most secret and sacred \"garden of delights,\" and at the same time allow the mind to be filled, and the thoughts to be occupied, with the concerns of the world we live in year after year, is utterly useless; for it is not the external, but the internal man that needs recreation; it is not the body, but the spirit that demands refreshment and relief from the wearing cares of our high-pressure lives. \"It is of no use,\" says a thoughtful writer, \"to carry my body to the woods, unless I get there myself.\"  Let us consult the poets, our inspired teachers, on this subject. Says Lowell,--   \"In June 't is good to lie beneath a tree  While the blithe season comforts every sense,  Steeps all the brain in rest, and heals the heart,  Brimming it o'er with sweetness unawares,  Fragrant and silent as that rosy snow  Wherewith the pitying apple-tree fills up  And tenderly lines some last-year's robin's nest.\"  And our wise Emerson, in his strong and wholesome, if sometimes rugged way,--   \"Quit thy friends as the dead in doom,  And build to them a final tomb.          *       *       *       *       *   Behind thee leave thy merchandise,  Thy churches and thy charities.          *       *       *       *       *   Enough for thee the primal mind  That flows in streams--that breathes in wind.\"  Even the gentle Wordsworth, too; read his exquisite sonnet, beginning,--   \"The world is too much with us; late and soon,  Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers.\"  All recognize that it is a mental and spiritual change that is needed.  With the earnest desire of suggesting to tired souls a practicable way of resting, I will even give a bit of personal history; I will tell the way in which I have learned to find recreation in nature.  When I turn my back upon my home, I make a serious and determined effort to leave behind me all cares and worries. As my train, on that beautiful May evening, passed beyond the brick and stone walls, and sped into the open country, and I found myself alone with night, I shook off, as well as I was able, all my affairs, all my interests, all my responsibilities, leaving them in that busy city behind me, where a few burdens more or less would not matter to anybody. With my trunks checked, and my face turned toward the far-off Rocky Mountains, I left the whole work-a-day world behind me, departing--so far as possible--a liberated soul, with no duties excepting to rejoice and to recruit. This is not an easy thing to do; it is like tearing apart one's very life; but it can be done by earnest endeavor, it has been done, and it is a charm more potent than magic to bring restoration and recreation to the brain and nerve-weary worker.  To insure any measure of success I always go alone; one familiar face would make the effort of no avail; and I seek a place where I am a stranger, so that my ordinary life cannot be recalled to me. When I reach my temporary home I forget, or at least ignore, my notions as to what I shall eat or drink, or how I shall sleep. I take the goods the gods provide, and adjust myself to them. Even these little things help one out of his old ways of thought and life. To still further banish home concerns, I mark upon my calendar one week before the day I shall start for home, and sternly resolve that not until I reach that day will I give one thought to my"]]]
