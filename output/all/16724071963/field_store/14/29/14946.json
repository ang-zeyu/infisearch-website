I only meant that it’s rather better the announcement should come from you than from me.”  “I quite agree with you; it’s much more proper!” And on this the aunt and the niece went to breakfast, where Mrs. Touchett, as good as her word, made no allusion to Gilbert Osmond. After an interval of silence, however, she asked her companion from whom she had received a visit an hour before.  “From an old friend--an American gentleman,” Isabel said with a colour in her cheek.  “An American gentleman of course. It’s only an American gentleman who calls at ten o’clock in the morning.”  “It was half-past ten; he was in a great hurry; he goes away this evening.”  “Couldn’t he have come yesterday, at the usual time?”  “He only arrived last night.”  “He spends but twenty-four hours in Florence?” Mrs. Touchett cried. “He’s an American gentleman truly.”  “He is indeed,” said Isabel, thinking with perverse admiration of what Caspar Goodwood had done for her.  Two days afterward Ralph arrived; but though Isabel was sure that Mrs. Touchett had lost no time in imparting to him the great fact, he showed at first no open knowledge of it. Their prompted talk was naturally of his health; Isabel had many questions to ask about Corfu. She had been shocked by his appearance when he came into the room; she had forgotten how ill he looked. In spite of Corfu he looked very ill to-day, and she wondered if he were really worse or if she were simply disaccustomed to living with an invalid. Poor Ralph made no nearer approach to conventional beauty as he advanced in life, and the now apparently complete loss of his health had done little to mitigate the natural oddity of his person. Blighted and battered, but still responsive and still ironic, his face was like a lighted lantern patched with paper and unsteadily held; his thin whisker languished upon a lean cheek; the exorbitant curve of his nose defined itself more sharply. Lean he was altogether, lean and long and loose-jointed; an accidental cohesion of relaxed angles. His brown velvet jacket had become perennial; his hands had fixed themselves in his pockets; he shambled and stumbled and shuffled in a manner that denoted great physical helplessness. It was perhaps this whimsical gait that helped to mark his character more than ever as that of the humorous invalid--the invalid for whom even his own disabilities are part of the general joke. They might well indeed with Ralph have been the chief cause of the want of seriousness marking his view of a world in which the reason for his own continued presence was past finding out. Isabel had grown fond of his ugliness; his awkwardness had become dear to her. They had been sweetened by association; they struck her as the very terms on which it had been given him to be charming. He was so charming that her sense of his being ill had hitherto had a sort of comfort in it; the state of his health had seemed not a limitation, but a kind of intellectual advantage; it absolved him from all professional and official emotions and left him the luxury of being exclusively personal. The personality so resulting was delightful; he had remained proof against the staleness of disease; he had had to consent to be deplorably ill, yet had somehow escaped being formally sick. Such had been the girl’s impression of her cousin; and when she had pitied him it was only on reflection. As she reflected a good deal she had allowed him a certain amount of compassion; but she always had a dread of wasting that essence--a precious article, worth more to the giver than to any one else. Now, however, it took no great sensibility to feel that poor Ralph’s tenure of life was less elastic than it should be. He was a bright, free, generous spirit, he had all the illumination of wisdom and none of its pedantry, and yet he was distressfully dying.  Isabel noted afresh that life was certainly hard for some people, and she felt a delicate glow of shame as she thought how easy it now promised to become for herself. She was prepared to learn that Ralph was not pleased with her engagement; but she was not prepared, in spite of her affection for him, to let this fact spoil the situation. She was not even prepared, or so she thought, to resent his want of sympathy; for it would be his privilege--it would be indeed his natural line--to find fault with any step she might take toward marriage. One’s cousin always pretended to hate one’s husband; that was traditional, classical; it was a part of one’s cousin’s always pretending to adore one. Ralph was nothing if not critical; and though she would certainly, other things being equal, have been as glad to marry to please him as to please any one, it would be absurd to regard as important that her choice should square with his views. What were his views after all? He had pretended to believe she had better have married Lord Warburton; but this was only because she had refused that excellent man. If she had accepted him Ralph would certainly have taken another tone; he always took the opposite. You could criticise any marriage; it was the essence of a marriage to be open to criticism. How well she herself, should she only give her mind to it, might criticise this union of her own! She had other employment, however, and Ralph was welcome to relieve her of the care. Isabel was prepared to be most patient and most indulgent. He must have seen that, and this made it the more odd he should say nothing. After three days had elapsed without his speaking our young woman wearied of waiting; dislike it as he would, he might at least go through the form. We, who know more about poor Ralph than his cousin, may easily believe that during the hours that followed his arrival at Palazzo Crescentini he had privately gone through many forms. His mother had literally greeted him with the great news, which had been even more sensibly chilling than Mrs. Touchett’s maternal kiss. Ralph was shocked and humiliated; his calculations had been false and the person in the world in whom he was most interested was lost. He drifted about the house like a rudderless vessel in a rocky stream, or sat in the garden of the palace on a great cane chair, his long legs extended, his head thrown back and his hat pulled over his eyes. He felt cold about the heart; he had never liked anything less. What could he do, what could he say? If the girl were irreclaimable could he pretend to like it? To attempt to reclaim her was permissible only if the attempt should succeed. To try to persuade her of anything sordid or sinister in the man to whose deep art she had succumbed would be decently discreet only in the event of her being persuaded. Otherwise he should simply have damned himself. It cost him an equal effort to speak his thought and to dissemble; he could neither assent with sincerity nor protest with hope. Meanwhile he knew--or rather he supposed--that the affianced pair were daily renewing their mutual vows. Osmond at this moment showed himself little at Palazzo Crescentini; but Isabel met him every day elsewhere, as she was free to do after their engagement had been made public. She had taken a carriage by the month, so as not to be indebted to her aunt for the means of pursuing a course of which Mrs. Touchett disapproved, and she drove in the morning to the Cascine. This suburban wilderness, during the early hours, was void of all intruders, and our young lady, joined by her lover in its quietest part, strolled with him a while through the grey Italian shade and listened to the nightingales.    CHAPTER XXXIV  One morning, on her return from her drive, some half-hour before luncheon, she quitted her vehicle in the court of the palace and, instead of ascending the great staircase, crossed the court, passed beneath another archway and entered the garden. A sweeter spot at this moment could not have been imagined. The stillness of noontide hung over it, and the warm shade, enclosed and still, made bowers like spacious caves. Ralph was sitting there in the clear gloom, at the base of a statue of Terpsichore--a dancing nymph with taper fingers and inflated draperies in the manner of Bernini; the extreme relaxation of his attitude suggested at first to Isabel that he was asleep. Her light footstep on the grass had not roused him, and before turning away she stood for a moment looking at him. During this instant he opened his eyes; upon which she sat down on a rustic chair that matched with his own. Though in her irritation she had accused him of indifference she was not blind to the fact that he had visibly had something to brood over. But she had explained his air of absence partly by the languor of his increased weakness, partly by worries connected with the property inherited from his father--the fruit of eccentric arrangements of which Mrs. Touchett disapproved and which, as she had told Isabel, now encountered opposition from the other partners in the bank. He ought to have gone to England, his mother said, instead of coming to Florence; he had not been there for months, and took no more interest in the bank than in the state of Patagonia.  “I’m sorry I waked you,” Isabel said; “you look too tired.”  “I feel too tired. But I was not asleep. I was thinking of you.”  “Are you tired of that?”  “Very much so. It leads to nothing. The road’s long and I never arrive.”  “What do you wish to arrive at?” she put to him, closing her parasol.  “At the point of expressing to myself properly what I think of your engagement.”  “Don’t think too much of it,” she lightly returned.  “Do you mean that it’s none of my business?”  “Beyond a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],["title","Deathworld (#0)"],["body","the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net          [Illustration]   DEATHWORLD  BY HARRY HARRISON  Illustrated by van Dongen       _Some planet in the galaxy must--by definition--be the toughest,     meanest, nastiest of all. If Pyrrus wasn't it ... it was an awfully     good approximation!_   Jason dinAlt sprawled in soft luxury on the couch, a large frosty stein held limply in one hand. His other hand rested casually on a pillow. The gun behind the pillow was within easy reach of his fingers. In his line of work he never took chances.  It was all highly suspicious. Jason didn't know a soul on this planet. Yet the card sent by service tube from the hotel desk had read: _Kerk Pyrrus would like to see Jason dinAlt_. Blunt and to the point. He signaled the desk to send the man up, then lowered his fingers a bit until they brushed the gun butt. The door slid open and his visitor stepped through.  _A retired wrestler._ That was Jason's first thought. Kerk Pyrrus was a gray-haired rock of a man. His body seemingly chiseled out of flat slabs of muscle. Then Jason saw the gun strapped to the inside of the other man's forearm, and he let his fingers drop casually behind the pillow.  \"I'd appreciate it,\" Jason said, \"if you'd take off your gun while you're in here.\" The other man stopped and scowled down at the gun as if he was seeing it for the first time.  \"No, I never take it off.\" He seemed mildly annoyed by the suggestion.  Jason had his fingers on his own gun when he said, \"I'm afraid I'll have to insist. I always feel a little uncomfortable around people who wear guns.\" He kept talking to distract attention while he pulled out his gun. Fast and smooth.  He could have been moving in slow motion for all the difference it made. Kerk Pyrrus stood rock still while the gun came out, while it swung in his direction. Not until the very last instant did he act. When he did, the motion wasn't visible. First his gun was in the arm holster--then it was aimed between Jason's eyes. It was an ugly, heavy weapon with a pitted front orifice that showed plenty of use.  And Jason knew if he swung his own weapon up a fraction of an inch more he would be dead. He dropped his arm carefully and Kerk flipped his own gun back in the holster with the same ease he had drawn it.  \"Now,\" the stranger said, \"if we're through playing, let's get down to business. I have a proposition for you.\"  Jason downed a large mouthful from the mug and bridled his temper. He was fast with a gun--his life had depended on it more than once--and this was the first time he had been outdrawn. It was the offhand, unimportant manner it had been done that irritated him.  \"I'm not prepared to do business,\" he said acidly. \"I've come to Cassylia for a vacation, get away from work.\"  \"Let's not fool each other, dinAlt,\" Kerk said impatiently. \"You've never worked at an honest job in your entire life. You're a professional gambler and that's why I'm here to see you.\"  Jason forced down his anger and threw the gun to the other end of the couch so he wouldn't be tempted to commit suicide. He _had_ hoped no one knew him on Cassylia and was looking forward to a big kill at the Casino. He would worry about that later. This weight-lifter type seemed to know all the answers. Let him plot the course for a while and see where it led.  \"All right, what do you want?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Kerk dropped into a chair that creaked ominously under his weight, and dug an envelope out of one pocket. He flipped through it quickly and dropped a handful of gleaming Galactic Exchange notes onto the table. Jason glanced at them--then sat up suddenly.  \"What are they--forgeries?\" he asked, holding one up to the light.  \"They're real enough,\" Kerk told him, \"I picked them up at the bank. Exactly twenty-seven bills--or twenty-seven million credits. I want you to use them as a bankroll when you go to the Casino tonight. Gamble with them and win.\"  They looked real enough--and they could be checked. Jason fingered them thoughtfully while he examined the other man.  \"I don't know what you have in mind,\" he said. \"But you realize I can't make any guarantees. I gamble--but I don't always win ...\"  \"You gamble--and you win when you want to,\" Kerk said grimly. \"We looked into that quite carefully before I came to you.\"  \"If you mean to say that I cheat--\" Carefully, Jason grabbed his temper again and held it down. There was no future in getting annoyed.  Kerk continued in the same level voice, ignoring Jason's growing anger. \"Maybe you don't call it cheating, frankly I don't care. As far as I'm concerned you could have your suit lined with aces and electromagnets in your boots. As long as you _won_. I'm not here to discuss moral points with you. I said I had a proposition.  \"We have worked hard for that money--but it still isn't enough. To be precise, we need three billion credits. The only way to get that sum is by gambling--with these twenty-seven million as bankroll.\"  \"And what do I get out of it?\" Jason asked the question coolly, as if any bit of the fantastic proposition made sense.  \"Everything above the three billion you can keep, that should be fair enough. You're not risking your own money, but you stand to make enough to keep you for life if you win.\"  \"And if I lose--?\"  Kerk thought for a moment, not liking the taste of the idea. \"Yes--there is the chance you might lose, I hadn't thought about that.\"  He reached a decision. \"If you lose--well I suppose that is just a risk we will have to take. Though I think I would kill you then. The ones who died to get the twenty-seven million deserve at least that.\" He said it quietly, without malice, and it was more of a promise than a threat.  Stamping to his feet Jason refilled his stein and offered one to Kerk who took it with a nod of thanks. He paced back and forth, unable to sit. The whole proposition made him angry--yet at the same time had a fatal fascination. He was a gambler and this talk was like the taste of drugs to an addict.  Stopping suddenly, he realized that his mind had been made up for some time. Win or lose--live or die--how could he say no to the chance to gamble with money like that! He turned suddenly and jabbed his finger at the big man in the chair.  \"I'll do it--you probably knew I would from the time you came in here. There are some terms of my own, though. I want to know who you are, and who _they_ are you keep talking about. And where did the money come from. Is it stolen?\"  Kerk drained his own stein and pushed it away from him.  \"Stolen money? No, quite the opposite. Two years' work mining and refining ore to get it. It was mined on Pyrrus and sold here on Cassylia. You can check on that very easily. I sold it. I'm the Pyrric ambassador to this planet.\" He smiled at the thought. \"Not that that means much, I'm ambassador to at least six other planets as well. Comes in handy when you want to do business.\"  Jason looked at the muscular man with his gray hair and worn, military-cut clothes, and decided not to laugh. You heard of strange things out in the frontier planets and every word could be true. He had never heard of Pyrrus either, though that didn't mean anything. There were over thirty-thousand known planets in the inhabited universe.  \"I'll check on what you have told me,\" Jason said. \"If it's true, we can do business. Call me tomorrow--\"  \"No,\" Kerk said. \"The money has to be won tonight. I've already issued a check for this twenty-seven million, it will bounce as high as the Pleiades unless we deposit the money in the morning, so that's our time limit.\"  With each moment the whole affair became more fantastic--and more intriguing for Jason. He looked at his watch. There was still enough time to find out if Kerk was lying or not.  \"All right, we'll do it tonight,\" he said. \"Only I'll have to have one of those bills to check.\"  Kerk stood up to go. \"Take them all, I won't be seeing you again until after you've won. I'll be at the Casino of course, but don't recognize me. It would be much better if they didn't know where your money was coming from or how much you had.\"  Then he was gone, after a bone-crushing handclasp that closed on Jason's hand like vise jaws. Jason was alone with the money. Fanning the bills out like a hand of cards he stared at their sepia and gold faces, trying to get the reality through his head. Twenty-seven million credits. What was to stop him from just walking out the door with them and vanishing. Nothing really, except his own sense of honor.  Kerk Pyrrus, the man with the same last name as the planet he came from, was the universe's biggest fool. Or he knew just what he was doing. From the way the interview had gone the latter seemed the better bet.  \"He _knows_ I would much rather gamble with the money than steal it,\" he said wryly.  Slipping a small gun into his waistband holster and pocketing the money he went out.     II.   The robot teller at the bank just pinged with electronic shock when he presented one of the bills and flashed a panel that directed him to see Vice President Wain. Wain was a smooth customer who bugged his eyes and lost some of his tan when he saw the sheaf of bills.  \"You ... wish to deposit these with us?\" he asked while his fingers unconsciously stroked them.  \"Not today,\" Jason said. \"They were paid to me as a debt. Would you please check that they are authentic and change them? I'd like five hundred thousand credit notes.\"  Both of his inner chest pockets were packed tight when he left the bank. The bills were good and he felt like a walking mint. This was the first time in his entire life that carrying a large sum of money made him uncomfortable. Waving to a passing helicab he went directly to the Casino, where he knew he would be safe--for a while.  Cassylia Casino was the playspot of the nearby cluster of star systems. It was the first time Jason had seen it, though he knew its type well. He had spent"]]]
