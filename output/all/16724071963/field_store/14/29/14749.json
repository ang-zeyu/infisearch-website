Some large body was stirring among the branches.  What could it be?  \"Stand clear,\" shouted Willem, as he swerved off from the tree, at the same time setting the cap upon his gun.  At the distance of ten or twelve paces he faced round, and stood ready to meet the moving object, whatever it might be.  Just then he saw standing before him a tall man who had dropped down from among the leaves, while Willem's back had been turned towards the tree.  The dress and general appearance of this individual proclaimed him to be a native African, but not one of those inferior varieties of the human race which that country produces.  He was a man of about forty years of age, tall and muscular, with features well formed, and that expressed both intelligence and courage.  His complexion was tawny brown, not black; and his hair was more like that of a European than an African.  These observations were made by the young hunter in six seconds; for the person who had thus suddenly appeared before him allowed no more time to elapse before setting off from the spot, and in such haste that the hunter thought he must be retreating in affright.  And yet there was no sign of fear accompanying the act.  Some other motive must have urged him to that precipitate departure.  There was; and Congo was the first to discover it.  The man had gone in the direction of the river.  \"Water, water!\" exclaimed the Kaffir; \"he want water.\"  The truth of this remark was soon made evident; for, on following the stranger with their eyes, they saw him rush into the stream, plunge his head under water and commence filling himself in the same manner as he would have done, had his body been a bottle!  Hendrik and Arend, having heard the reports of the roer, feared that something might have gone wrong, and galloped forward, leaving Hans and Swartboy to bring up the pack-horses.  They reached the scene just as the African, after having quenched his thirst, had returned to the tree where the young hunter and Congo had remained.  Without taking the slightest notice of either of the others, the man walked up to Groot Willem, and, with an air of dignity, natural to most semi-barbarous people, began making a speech.  Grateful for having been relieved from his imprisonment, he evidently believed that duty required him to say something, whether it might be understood or not.  \"Can _you_ understand him, Congo?\" asked Willem.  \"Yaas, a little I can,\" answered the Kaffir; and in his own peculiar manner he interpreted what the African had to say.  It was simply that he owed his life to Groot Willem, and that the latter had only to ask for whatever he required, and it should be given him.  \"That is certainly promising a good deal,\" said the sarcastic Hendrik, \"and I hope that Willem will not be too greedy in his request, but will leave something for the rest of mankind.\"  Hans and Swartboy at this moment came up with the pack-horses; and, selecting a spot near the place where the cow had been killed, the party encamped for the night.  For some time, all hands were busy in gathering firewood and making other preparations for their bivouac,--among which were the skinning and cooking of the buffalo calf, duties that were assigned to the Bushman. During his performance of them, the others, assisted by Congo as interpreter, were extracting from the tall stranger a full account of the adventure to which they were indebted for his presence in the camp; and a strange story it was.    CHAPTER TEN.  MACORA.  In the manner of the African there was a certain hauteur which had not escaped the observation of his hearers.  This was explained on their learning who and what he was; for his story began by his giving a true and particular account of himself.  His name was Macora, and his rank that of a chief.  His tribe belonged to the great nation of the Makololo, though living apart, in a \"kraal\" by themselves.  The village, so-called, was at no great distance from the spot where the hunters were now encamped.  The day before, he had come up the river in a canoe, accompanied by three of his subjects.  Their object was to procure a plant which grew in that place,--from which the poison for arrows and spears is obtained. In passing a shallow place in the river, they had attempted to kill a hippopotamus which they saw walking about on the bottom of the stream, like a buffalo browsing upon a plain.  Rising suddenly to the surface, the monster had capsized the canoe, and Macora was compelled to swim ashore with the loss of a gun which once cost him eight elephant's tusks.  He had seen nothing of his three companions, since parting with them in the water.  On reaching the shore, and a few yards from the bank, he encountered a herd of buffaloes, cows and young calves, on their way to the river. These turned suddenly to avoid him, when a calf was knocked down by one of the old ones, and so severely injured that it could not accompany the rest in their flight.  The mother, seeing her offspring left behind, turned back and selected Macora as the object of her resentment.  The chief retreated towards the nearest tree, hotly pursued by the animal eager to revenge the injury done to her young.  He was just in time to ascend among the branches as the cow came up. The calf, with much difficulty, succeeded in reaching the tree.  Once there, it could not move away, and the mother would not leave it.  This accounted for Macora's having been found among the branches of the pandanus.  He went on to say, that, during the time he had been detained in the tree, he had made several attempts to get down and steal off, but on each occasion had found the buffalo waiting to receive him upon her horns.  He was suffering terribly with thirst when he heard the first shot fired by Groot Willem, and perceived that assistance was near.  The chief concluded his narrative by inviting the hunters to accompany him the next morning to his kraal; where he promised to show them such hospitality as was in his power.  On learning that his home was down the river, and at no great distance from it, the invitation was at once accepted.  \"One thing this man has told us,\" remarked Willem, \"which pleases me very much.  We have learnt that there is or has been a hippopotamus near our camping-ground, and perhaps we shall not have far to travel before commencing our premeditated war against them.\"  \"Question him about sea-cows, Cong,\" said Hendrik.  \"Ascertain if there are many of them about here.\"  In answer to the Kaffir's inquiries, the chief stated that hippopotami were not often seen in that part of the river; but that, a day's journey farther down, there was a large lagoon, through which the stream ran; there, sea-cows were as plentiful as the stars in the sky.  \"That is just the place we have been looking for,\" said Willem; \"and now, Congo, question him about camelopards.\"  Macora could hold out but little hopes of their meeting giraffes anywhere on that part of the Limpopo.  He had heard of one or two having been occasionally seen; but it was not a giraffe country, and they were stray animals.  \"Ask him if he knows where there is such a country,\" demanded Willem, who seemed more interested in learning something about giraffes than either of his companions.  Macora could not or would not answer this question without taking his own time and way of doing it.  He stated that the native country of himself and his tribe was far to the north and west; that they had been driven from their home by the tyranny of the great Zooloo King, Moselekatse, who claimed the land and levied tribute upon all the petty chiefs around him.  Macora further stated that, having in some mysterious manner lost the good opinion of Sekeletu and other great chiefs of the Makololo,--his own people,--they would no longer protect him, and that he and his tribe were compelled to leave their homes, and migrate to the place where he was now about to conduct his new acquaintances.  \"But that is not what I wish to know,\" said Groot Willem, who never troubled himself with the political affairs of his own country, and therefore cared little about those of an African petty chief.  On being brought back to the question, Macora stated that he was only giving them positive proof of his familiarity with the camelopards, since nowhere were these more abundant than in the country from which he had been expatriated by the tyranny of the Zooloo chief.  It was his native land, where he had hunted the giraffe from childhood.  Swartboy here interrupted the conversation by announcing that he had enough meat cooked for them to begin their meal with; and about ten pounds' weight of buffalo veal cutlets were placed before the hunters and their guest.  Macora, who, to all appearance, had been waiting very patiently while the cutlets were being broiled, commenced the repast with some show of self-restraint.  This, however, wholly forsook him before it was finished.  He ate voraciously, consuming more than the four young hunters together.  This, however, he did not do without making an apology for his apparent greed; stating that he had been nearly two days without having tasted food.  The supper having at length come to an end, all stretched themselves around the fire and went to sleep.  The night passed without their being disturbed; and soon after sunrise they arose,--not all at the same time,--for one of the party had risen and taken his departure an hour earlier than the rest.  It was Macora, whom they had entertained the evening before.  \"Here, you Swart and Cong!\" exclaimed Arend, when he discovered that the chief was no longer in the camp, \"see if any of the horses are missing. It is just possible we have been tricked by a false tale and robbed into the bargain.\"  \"By whom?\" asked Groot Willem.  \"By your friend, the chief.  He has stolen himself away, if nothing else.\"  \"I'll bet my life,\" exclaimed Willem, in a more positive"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27911"],["title","The Giraffe Hunters (#7)"],["body","than the others had ever yet heard him use, \"that that man is an honest fellow, and that all he has told us is true, though I can't account for his absence.  He is a chief, and has the air of one.\"  \"Yes, he is a chief, no doubt,\" said Hendrik, sneeringly.  \"Every African in this part of the world is a chief, if he only has a family. Whether his story be true or not, it looks ugly, his leaving us in this clandestine manner.\"  Hans, as usual, had nothing to say upon a subject of which he knew nothing; and Swartboy, after making sure that no horses, guns, or other property were missing, expressed the opinion that he was never so mystified in his life.  Nothing was gone from the camp; and yet he was quite certain that any one speaking a native African language understood by Congo, could not be capable of acting honestly if an opportunity was allowed him for the opposite.  Having allowed their horses an hour to graze, while they themselves breakfasted upon buffalo veal, our adventurers broke up their bivouac, and continued their march down the bank of the river.    CHAPTER ELEVEN.  MACORA'S KRAAL.  After journeying about three hours, the young hunters came to a place that gave unmistakable evidence of having been often visited by human beings.  Small palm-trees had been cut down, the trunks taken away, and the tops left on the ground.  Elephants, giraffes, or other animals that feed on foliage would have taken the tops of the trees, and, moreover, would not have cut them down with hatchets, the marks of which were visible in the stumps left standing.  Half a mile farther on, and fields could be seen in cultivation.  They were evidently approaching a place inhabited by a people possessing some intelligence.  \"See!\" exclaimed Arend, as they rode on, \"there's a large body of men coming towards us.\"  All turned to the direction in which Arend was gazing.  They saw about fifty people coming along the crest of a ridge, that trended toward the north.  \"Perhaps they mean mischief,\" said Hans.  \"What shall we do?\"  \"Ride on and meet them,\" exclaimed Hendrik.  \"If they are enemies it is not our fault.  We have not molested them.\"  As the strangers came near, the hunters recognised their late guest, who was now mounted on an ox and riding in advance of his party.  His greeting, addressed to Groot Willem, was interpreted by Congo.  \"I have invited you to come to my kraal,\" said he, \"and to bring your friends along with you.  I left you early this morning, and have been to my home to see that preparations should be made worthy of those who have befriended Macora.  Some of my people, the bravest and best amongst them, are here to bid you welcome.\"  A procession was then formed, and all proceeded on to the African village, which was but a short distance from the spot.  On entering it, a group of about a hundred and fifty women received them with a chant, expressed in low murmuring tones, not unlike the lullaby with which a mother sings her child to sleep.  The houses of the kraal were constructed stockade fashion, in rows of upright poles, interlaced with reeds or long grass, and then covered with a plaster of mud.  Through these the hunters were conducted to a long shed in the centre of the village, where the saddles were taken from their horses, which were afterwards led off to the grazing ground.  Although Macora's subjects had been allowed but three hours' notice, they had prepared a splendid feast for his visitors.  The young hunters sat down to a dinner of roast antelope, _biltongue_, stews of hippopotamus and buffalo flesh, baked fish, ears of green maize roasted, with wild honey, stewed pumpkin, melons, and plenty of good milk.  The young hunters and all their following were waited on with the greatest courtesy.  Even their dogs were feasted, while Swartboy and Congo had never in all their lives been treated with so much consideration.  In the afternoon, Macora informed his guests that he should give them an entertainment; and, in order that they should enjoy the spectacle intended for them, he informed them, by way of prologue, of the circumstances under which it was to be enacted.  His statement was to the effect that his companions in the canoe, at the time it was capsized by the hippopotamus, had reached home, bringing with them the story of their mishap; that the tribe had afterwards made a search for their chief, but not finding him, had come to the conclusion that he had been either drowned or killed by the sea-cow. They had given him up for lost; and another important member of the community, named Sindo, had proclaimed himself chief of the tribe.  When Macora reached home that morning, Sindo had not yet come forth from his house; and, before he was aware of the chief's reappearance, the house had been surrounded and the usurper made prisoner.  Sindo, fast bound and guarded, was now awaiting execution; and this was the spectacle which the hunters were to be treated to.  It was a scene that none of the young hunters had any desire to be present at; but, yielding to the importunities of their host, they accompanied him to the spot where the execution was to take place.  This was in the suburbs of the village, where they found the prisoner fast tied to a tree.  Nearly all the inhabitants of the community had assembled to see the usurper shot,--this being the manner of death that had been awarded to him.  The prisoner was rather a good-looking man, apparently about thirty-five years of age.  No evil propensity was expressed in his features; and our heroes could not help thinking that he had been guilty of no greater crime than a too hasty ambition.  \"Can we not save him from this cruel fate?\" asked Hans, speaking to Groot Willem.  \"I think you have some influence with the chief.\"  \"There can be no harm in trying,\" answered Willem.  \"I'll see what I can do.\"  Sindo was to be shot with his own musket.  The executioner had been already appointed, and all other arrangements made for carrying out the decree, when Willem, advancing towards Macora, commenced interceding for his life.  His argument was, that the prisoner had not committed any great crime; that had he conspired against his chief for the purpose of placing himself in authority, it would have been a different affair.  Then he would have deserved death.  Willem further urged, that had he, Macora, really been lost, some one of the tribe would have become chief, and that Sindo was not to blame for aspiring to resemble one who had ruled to the evident satisfaction of all.  Macora was then entreated to spare the prisoner's life, and the entreaty was backed by the promise of a gun to replace the one lost in the river, on condition that Sindo should be allowed to live.  For a time Macora remained silent, but at length made reply, by saying that he should never feel safe if the usurper were allowed to remain in the community.  Groot Willem urged that he could be banished from the kraal, and forbidden to return to it on penalty of death.  Macora hesitated a little longer; but remembering that he had promised to grant any favour to the one who had released him from imprisonment in the tree, he yielded.  Sindo's life should be spared on condition of his expatriating himself at once and forever from the kraal of Macora.  On granting this pardon, the chief wished all distinctly to understand that it was done out of gratitude to his friend, the big white hunter. He did not wish it to be supposed that the prisoner's life had been purchased with a gun.  All Macora's subjects, including the condemned man himself, appeared greatly astonished at the decision, so contrary to all precedent among his fellow-countrymen.  The exhibition of mercy, along with the refusal of the bribe, proved to the young hunters, that Macora had within him the elements of a noble nature.  Sindo, accompanied by his family, immediately made departure from the place, going off to seek a home among kindred tribes, where his ambition would, no doubt, be exercised with greater caution.  During the evening, Macora provided a varied entertainment for his guests.  It included a grand feast, with songs and dancing, the latter done to the sounds of the tom-tom drum, and one-stringed African fiddle.  All retired for the night with the understanding that the hunters should the next day be conducted to a place where hippopotami were plentiful.    CHAPTER TWELVE.  SPYING OUT THE LAND.  Early next morning, after the hunters had reciprocated Macora's hospitality by giving him the best breakfast they were capable of cooking, they started off on their search for sea-cows.  Macora, accompanied by four attendants, acted as guide, while fifty others were to follow, to assist in the chase.  The pack-horses and all other property were taken along, as they did not intend to return to the kraal, although the chief earnestly requested them to remain and make his village their home so long as they remained in the neighbourhood.  For more than a mile their way led through small plantations of maize, owned by Macora's subjects, and cultivated by the women and younger people of the tribe.  Our adventurers had seen many kraals of Bushmen, also of Bechuana and Kaffir tribes, and were surprised to observe such evidences of civilisation so far removed from the teachings and example of the Cape Colonists.  On their way down the river, buffaloes were observed in small droves, as also herds of koodoos and zebras.  They had reached a land that gave good promise of the very adventures they were in search of.  About five miles from the village they came upon a small open space thickly covered with grass.  Here Macora suggested that they should make their hunting camp, as the thick growth of timber seen farther down the river was the resort of every species of game to be found for many miles around.  Macora's suggestion was adopted; and his followers soon constructed a stockade enclosure or kraal, to protect the camp.  While this was being "]]]
