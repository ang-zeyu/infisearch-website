And they marvelled all. 64 And     his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue _loosed_, and he     spake, blessing God. 65 And fear came on all that dwelt round     about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout     all the hill country of Judæa. 66 And all that heard them laid     them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For     the hand of the Lord was with him.       67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and     prophesied, saying,      68 Blessed _be_ the Lord, the God of Israel;       For he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,     69 And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us       In the house of his servant David     70 (As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been                 from of old),     71 Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate                 us;     72 To show mercy towards our fathers,       And to remember his holy covenant;     73 The oath which he sware unto Abraham our father,     74 To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our                 enemies       Should serve him without fear,     75 In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.     76 Yea and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most                 High:       For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his                   ways;     77 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people       In the remission of their sins,     78 Because of the tender mercy of our God,       Whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us,     79 To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of                 death;       To guide our feet into the way of peace.       80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the     deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.   When the aged priest, Zacharias, had received from an angel the promise that he was to be given a son who would be called John and who would be the herald of Christ, and when he had asked for a sign to attest the truth of the prediction, he was smitten with dumbness as a rebuke for his unbelief and as a stimulus for his faith. Even when at last the promise was fulfilled, the sign was not removed and he was not able to speak until he had given a written expression of his confidence in God. This interesting incident occurred on the eighth day after the birth of John, when in the presence of their rejoicing friends the parents were about to name the child. Many supposed that the name of the father would be selected. The mother, however, intimated that the name might be “John.” When Zacharias, the father, was consulted, “he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, ... His name is John.” There was no hesitation, no uncertainty, no question in his mind, for this name had been predicted by the angel, and Zacharias showed by his decision and firmness that he believed absolutely in the fulfillment of all that the angel had promised concerning the career of the son who was to be regarded by his fellow men as a gift of divine grace and a prophet of divine appointment. It usually happens that a public confession of faith results in new joy and in wider testimony. It was surely so in the case of Zacharias: “His mouth was opened immediately, ... and he spake, blessing God.” His thanksgiving was voiced in a hymn which, for hundreds of years, has been sung daily in Christian worship. It is indeed a Christian hymn and a hymn of the nativity; for while its occasion was the birth of John, only one stanza refers to that event; the whole burden of the thanksgiving refers to the approaching birth of Jesus and to the salvation which he is to bring.  This hymn is named the Benedictus from the first word in the Latin version. It is an ecstatic expression of gratitude to God for his boundless goodness. The poem possibly may be divided into five stanzas of four lines each; but there is a definite pause after the third of these stanzas when the thought turns from the work of Christ to the specific mission of John.  The first strophe, vs. 68, 69, speaks of the redemption of Israel as already accomplished in the gift of the Christ who is about to be born and who is described as “a horn of salvation,” that is, a manifestation of saving power. He is to appear as a son and heir of David the king.  The second stanza, or strophe, vs. 70-72, indicates that the salvation from all enemies is in fulfillment of the promises made through the prophets and cherished by the ancient fathers and embodied in the holy covenant made with Israel of old.  The third stanza, vs. 73-75, describes the nature of this salvation which was assured by the oath to Abraham; it is to be such a deliverance from political oppression as to make possible for Israel a true, priestly service of God, as a nation holy and righteous before him.  In the fourth stanza, vs. 76, 77, the singer turns to address his own son whose birth has given occasion to the song. He declares that John is to be recognized as a prophet of God whose divine mission will be to announce and to define the promised salvation as in its essence not a political but a spiritual redemption consisting in the remission of sin. John was not to be a revolutionist but a reformer. He was to call a nation to repentance that those who obeyed his message might be ready to receive the salvation of Christ.  This mission of John is linked with that of Christ as the description of the latter reaches its climax in the closing strophe. Vs. 78, 79. The source of all the blessings Christ will bring is found in “the tender mercy of our God;” the essence is a visitation of “the dayspring from on high,” when the Sun of righteousness arises upon the helpless, terrified wanderers of the night who are seated “in darkness and the shadow of death;” the result will be “to guide our feet into the way of peace.”  Such is the hymn of Zacharias, a hymn of faith, of hope, of gratitude, a song of the salvation provided by the love of God in Jesus Christ our Lord.     E. The Birth of Jesus. Ch. 2:1-20       1 Now it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from     Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled. 2 This was     the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3     And all went to enrol themselves, every one to his own city. 4 And     Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,     into Judæa, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,     because he was of the house and family of David; 5 to enrol     himself with Mary, who was betrothed to him, being great with     child. 6 And it came to pass, while they were there, the days were     fulfilled that she should be delivered. 7 And she brought forth     her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and     laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the     inn.       8 And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the     field, and keeping watch by night over their flock. 9 And an angel     of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round     about them: and they were sore afraid. 10 And the angel said unto     them, Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great     joy which shall be to all the people: 11 for there is born to you     this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.     12 And this is the sign unto you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in     swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger. 13 And suddenly there     was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God,     and saying,      14 Glory to God in the highest,       And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased.       15 And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into     heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto     Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord     hath made known unto us. 16 And they came with haste, and found     both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger. 17 And     when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was     spoken to them about this child. 18 And all that heard it wondered     at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds. 19 But     Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart. 20 And     the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the     things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto     them.   The story of the birth of Jesus as related by Matthew is in striking contrast with that of Luke. Matthew depicts Jesus as a King and at his birth the reigning Herod trembles on his throne and the Magi adore him, offering regal gifts. Luke represents Jesus as the ideal Man, and the story is full of human interest. It describes two obscure peasants journeying from their northern home in Nazareth to Bethlehem and there, excluded from the inn, placing in a manger their newborn babe, while the first to visit them are humble shepherds from the neighboring plain. Human interests, however, are not merely earthly interests; the story is vocal with heavenly melodies and inwoven with messages of divine meaning and grace.  Only the most recent scholarship has"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26881"],["title","The Gospel of Luke, An Exposition (#5)"],["body","the historic accuracy of Luke in connecting the event with the decree of Augustus and with the enrollment under Quirinius. However, these facts are mentioned by Luke not so much to fix the date of the birth of Christ as to explain how this occurred in Bethlehem when the home of his parents was in Nazareth. Only a legal necessity would have made them willing to take such a journey at such a time, but thus it appears that the emperor of the world was concerned unconsciously in the fulfillment of divine prophecy concerning the Saviour of the world. According to the imperial decree, Joseph left Nazareth and with Mary, to whom according to Matthew he was not only “betrothed” but married, journeyed to Bethlehem, five miles south of Jerusalem, to be enrolled in his ancestral city. There is born their promised Son. Their exclusion from the inn was not due to any lack of hospitality; much less did it express hostility to Jesus; it was due simply to the crowded condition of the town. However, it is suggestive of the obscurity and discomfort and poverty of Joseph and Mary.  In view of his evident appreciation of the supreme importance of the birth of Jesus, the account of Luke is almost startling in its brevity and simplicity. However, with consummate art, after his own short statement of fact, he allows divine messengers to give the interpretation and to express the significance of the event. These messengers were angels. They appeared to a group of shepherds who were “abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.” Out of a blaze of heavenly glory came the tidings of great joy to Israel, “There is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.” The angel did not then disclose the larger truth, that this Christ was to be the redeemer of all men or that he was a divine Lord. However, a sign was given whereby the shepherds might be able to distinguish the child and to be assured that he was the Christ: “Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.” A strange sign it was; yet for us it has become a symbol full of meaning; a Redeemer who was cradled in a manger has known what it is to endure poverty and suffering and neglect, and now he can sympathize with the lowly and distressed even as he is abundantly able to save.  When the good news had been given, there suddenly swelled forth an angel chorus, singing that great hymn of the nativity which, as subsequently expanded by Christian worshipers, is named from its Latin version, the Gloria in Excelsis. As sung by the angels it is composed of two verses, each containing three corresponding notes, “glory” and “peace,” “in the highest” (heaven) and “on earth,” “God,” and “men.” This is a hymn of praise to God who in the gift of a Saviour manifests in heaven his excellence and on earth reveals his grace to men, the recipients of his favor. The result of this, however, is declared to be “peace;” in Christ alone can peace be secured—peace with God, peace for the human heart, peace between men, peace for the world.  The astonished shepherds hastened to verify the good news and they became in a real sense the first witnesses for Christ as “they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child.” It is not strange that all who heard wondered, or that Mary treasured in her heart the heavenly messages, or that the shepherds returned to their tasks with gratitude and praise, for there lingered in their memories a song which expresses still the hope of all mankind.     F. The Presentation of Jesus, and the “Nunc Dimittis.” Ch. 2:21-40       21 And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his     name was called JESUS, who was so called by the angel before he     was conceived in the womb.       22 And when the days of their purification according to the law of     Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present     him to the Lord 23 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every     male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord), 24     and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the     law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. 25     And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon;     and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation     of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him. 26 And it had been     revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see     death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. 27 And he came in the     Spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child     Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the     law, 28 then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and     said,      29 Now lettest thou thy servant depart, O Lord,       According to thy word, in peace;     30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,     31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;     32 A light for revelation to the Gentiles,       And the glory of thy people Israel.       33 And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things     which were spoken concerning him; 34 and Simeon blessed them, and     said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this _child_ is set for the     falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is     spoken against; 35 yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own     soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed. 36 And     there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the     tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a     husband seven years from her virginity, 37 and she had been a     widow even unto fourscore and four years), who departed not from     the temple, worshipping with fastings and supplications night and     day. 38 And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto God,     and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption     of Jerusalem. 39 And when they had accomplished all things that     were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee,     to their own city Nazareth.       40 And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and     the grace of God was upon him.   The incidents of the infancy of Jesus recorded by Luke not only add human interest to the story but they interpret the future career and the saving work of our Lord. Thus when on the eighth day he was named “Jesus,” a name often given to Jewish boys, it was because he was destined to fulfill all that the name implies, for he was to be the “Salvation of the Lord.”  So, too, when five weeks later he was presented in the Temple, when his mother offered for herself a sacrifice which indicated lack of wealth but not abject poverty, the real significance of the scene is set forth in the prophetic utterances of the saintly Simeon and Anna. The first of these utterances was the song of Simeon, called from the Latin form of its opening words the Nunc Dimittis (“Now Lettest Thou Depart”). To this devout soul it had been revealed that he should not die until he had seen the Messiah, “the Lord’s Christ.” Led by the Spirit to the Temple while the parents of Jesus are there presenting their Son before the Lord, he took the little babe in his arms and sang the sweetest and most solemn song of the nativity, which, unlike the Magnificat or the Benedictus, promises redemption not only to Israel but to all the world.  “Now lettest thou thy servant depart ... in peace;” the figure of speech is full of beauty; it is the word of a faithful watchman who welcomes with joy the hour of his dismissal, for he has caught the vision of the coming One; now he is about to be sent away in the peace of an accomplished task, in the peace of fulfilled hope; for his eyes have seen the Saviour according to the promise of the Lord. The redemption which the Messiah brings, as the song continues to declare, is for all peoples; it is a light to reveal the way of salvation to the Gentiles; it is to be the true glory of the favored people, Israel.  While this salvation is provided for all, it will not be accepted by all. To the wondering mother, Simeon uttered a dark word of prophecy. The ministry of Jesus will be the occasion for the fall and the rise of many. Their attitude toward him will be a revelation of character; some will reject him and thus condemn themselves; some will speak against him, even though he is the very token and instrument of divine salvation; this opposition will reach its climax at the cross, when bitter anguish like a sword will pierce the soul of Mary. Jesus is to be the touchstone of character; wherever he is known, by accepting or by rejecting him, men will disclose their true nature; “the thoughts out of many hearts” will be “revealed.”  While Mary and Joseph were still wondering at these sublime words there appeared an aged prophetess whose long years of widowhood had been spent in continual worship; she, too, praised God for the salvation to be accomplished by the Child of Mary and she went forth to speak of him to all who like her “were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.”  Mary and Joseph, however, returned to their home in Nazareth where Jesus was to spend his infancy and early childhood. During those years of obscurity his development was normal, but unique in its symmetry and its perfection; he “grew, and waxed strong” in body, but there was just as true a growth in mind and spirit; he was “filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.” The Saviour of the world was to be the ideal Man.     G. The Boy Jesus At Jerusalem. Ch. 2:41-52       41 And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of     the passover. 42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up     after the custom of the feast; 43 and when they had fulfilled the     days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in     Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not; 44 but supposing him to be     in the"]]]
