Once, indeed, a secret attempt was made to utilize the horses and mules which were running in the back pasture; but a premature discovery of the matter ended in such disaster to all concerned that the plan was abandoned, and the boys had to content themselves with their wooden steeds.  The day that the final orders came for their father and uncle to go to Richmond,--from which point they were ordered to \"the Peninsula,\"--the boys could not understand why every one was suddenly plunged into such distress. Then, next morning, when the soldiers left, the boys could not altogether comprehend it. They thought it was a very fine thing to be allowed to ride Frank and Hun, the two war-horses, with their new, deep army saddles and long bits. They cried when their father and uncle said good-bye, and went away; but it was because their mother looked so pale and ill, and not because they did not think it was all grand. They had no doubt that all would come back soon, for old Uncle Billy, the \"head-man,\" who had been born down in \"Little York,\" where Cornwallis surrendered, had expressed the sentiment of the whole plantation when he declared, as he sat in the back yard surrounded by an admiring throng and surveyed the two glittering sabres which he had no one but himself to polish, that \"Ef them Britishers jest sees dese swodes dee'll run!\" The boys tried to explain to him that these were not British, but Yankees,--but he was hard to convince. Even Lucy Ann, who was incurably afraid of everything like a gun or fire-arm, partook of the general fervor, and boasted effusively that she had actually \"tetched Marse John's big pistils.\"  Hugh, who was fifteen, and was permitted to accompany his father to Richmond, was regarded by the boys with a feeling of mingled envy and veneration, which he accepted with dignified complacency.  Frank and Willy soon found that war brought some immunities. The house filled up so with the families of cousins and friends who were refugees that the boys were obliged to sleep in the Office, and thus they felt that, at a bound, they were almost as old as Hugh.  There were the cousins from Gloucester, from the Valley, and families of relatives from Baltimore and New York, who had come south on the declaration of war. Their favorite was their Cousin Belle, whose beauty at once captivated both boys. This was the first time that the boys knew anything of girls, except their own sister, Evelyn; and after a brief period, during which the novelty gave them pleasure, the inability of the girls to hunt, climb trees, or play knucks, etc., and the additional restraint which their presence imposed, caused them to hold the opinion that \"girls were no good.\"     CHAPTER III.   In course of time they saw a great deal of \"the army,\"--which meant the Confederates. The idea that the Yankees could ever get to Oakland never entered any one's head. It was understood that the army lay between Oakland and them, and surely they could never get by the innumerable soldiers who were always passing up one road or the other, and who, day after day and night after night, were coming to be fed, and were rapidly eating up everything that had been left on the place. By the end of the first year they had been coming so long that they made scarcely any difference; but the first time a regiment camped in the neighborhood it created great excitement.  It became known one night that a cavalry regiment, in which were several of their cousins, was encamped at Honeyman's Bridge, and the boys' mother determined to send a supply of provisions for the camp next morning; so several sheep were killed, the smoke-house was opened, and all night long the great fires in the kitchen and wash-house glowed; and even then there was not room, so that a big fire was kindled in the back yard, beside which saddles of mutton were roasted in the tin kitchens. Everybody was \"rushing.\"  The boys were told that they might go to see the soldiers, and as they had to get off long before daylight, they went to bed early, and left all \"the other boys\"--that is, Peter and Cole and other colored children--squatting about the fires and trying to help the cooks to pile on wood.  It was hard to leave the exciting scene.  They were very sleepy the next morning; indeed, they seemed scarcely to have fallen asleep when Lucy Ann shook them; but they jumped up without the usual application of cold water in their faces, which Lucy Ann so delighted to make; and in a little while they were out in the yard, where Balla was standing holding three horses,--their mother's riding-horse; another with a side-saddle for their Cousin Belle, whose brother was in the regiment; and one for himself,--and Peter and Cole were holding the carriage-horses for the boys, and several other men were holding mules.  Great hampers covered with white napkins were on the porch, and the savory smell decided the boys not to eat their breakfast, but to wait and take their share with the soldiers.  The roads were so bad that the carriage could not go; and as the boys' mother wished to get the provisions to the soldiers before they broke camp, they had to set out at once. In a few minutes they were all in the saddle, the boys and their mother and Cousin Belle in front, and Balla and the other servants following close behind, each holding before him a hamper, which looked queer and shadowy as they rode on in the darkness.  The sky, which was filled with stars when they set out, grew white as they splashed along mile after mile through the mud. Then the road became clearer; they could see into the woods, and the sky changed to a rich pink, like the color of peach-blossoms. Their horses were covered with mud up to the saddle-skirts. They turned into a lane only half a mile from the bridge, and, suddenly, a bugle rang out down in the wooded bottom below them, and the boys hardly could be kept from putting their horses to a run, so fearful were they that the soldiers were leaving, and that they should not see them. Their mother, however, told them that this was probably the reveille, or \"rising-bell,\" of the soldiers. She rode on at a good sharp canter, and the boys were diverting themselves over a discussion as to who would act the part of Lucy Ann in waking the regiment of soldiers, when they turned a curve, and at the end of the road, a few hundred yards ahead, stood several horsemen.  \"There they are,\" exclaimed both boys.  \"No, that is a picket,\" said their mother; \"gallop on, Frank, and tell them we are bringing breakfast for the regiment.\"  Frank dashed ahead, and soon they saw a soldier ride forward to meet him, and, after a few words, return with him to his comrades. Then, while they were still a hundred yards distant, they saw Frank, who had received some directions, start off again toward the bridge, at a hard gallop. The picket had told him to go straight on down the hill, and he would find the camp just the other side of the bridge. He accordingly rode on, feeling very important at being allowed to go alone to the camp on such a mission.  As he reached a turn in the road, just above the river, the whole regiment lay swarming below him among the large trees on the bank of the little stream. The horses were picketed to bushes and stakes, in long rows, the saddles lying on the ground, not far off; and hundreds of men were moving about, some in full uniform and others without coat or vest. A half-dozen wagons with sheets on them stood on one side among the trees, near which several fires were smoking, with men around them.  As Frank clattered up to the bridge, a soldier with a gun on his arm, who had been standing by the railing, walked out to the middle of the bridge.  \"Halt! Where are you going in such a hurry, my young man?\" he said.  \"I wish to see the colonel,\" said Frank, repeating as nearly as he could the words the picket had told him.  \"What do you want with him?\"  Frank was tempted not to tell him; but he was so impatient to deliver his message before the others should arrive, that he told him what he had come for.  \"There he is,\" said the sentinel, pointing to a place among the trees where stood at least five hundred men.  Frank looked, expecting to recognize the colonel by his noble bearing, or splendid uniform, or some striking marks.  \"Where?\" he asked, in doubt; for while a number of the men were in uniform, he knew these to be privates.  \"There,\" said the sentry, pointing; \"by that stump, near the yellow horse-blanket.\"  Frank looked again. The only man he could fix upon by the description was a young fellow, washing his face in a tin basin, and he felt that this could not be the colonel; but he did not like to appear dull, so he thanked the man and rode on, thinking he would go to the point indicated, and ask some one else to show him the officer.  He felt quite grand as he rode in among the men, who, he thought, would recognize his importance and treat him accordingly; but, as he passed on, instead of paying him the respect he had expected, they began to guy him with all sorts of questions.  \"Hullo, bud, going to jine the cavalry?\" asked one. \"Which is oldest; you or your horse?\" inquired another.  \"How's pa--and ma?\" \"Does your mother know you're out?\" asked others. One soldier walked up, and putting his hand on the bridle, proceeded affably to ask him after his health, and that of every member of his family. At first Frank did not understand that they were making fun of him, but it dawned on him when the man asked him solemnly:  \"Are there any Yankees around, that you were running away so fast just now?\"  \"No; if there were I'd never have found _you_ here,\" said Frank, shortly, in reply; which at once turned the tide in his favor and diverted the ridicule from himself to his teaser, who was seized by some of his comrades and carried off with much laughter and slapping on the back.  \"I wish to see Colonel"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26725"],["title","Two Little Confederates (#2)"],["body","hall,\" said Frank, pushing his way through the group that surrounded him, and riding up to the man who was still occupied at the basin on the stump.  \"All right, sir, I'm the man,\" said the individual, cheerily looking up with his face dripping and rosy from its recent scrubbing.  \"You the colonel!\" exclaimed Frank, suspicious that he was again being ridiculed, and thinking it impossible that this slim, rosy-faced youngster, who was scarcely stouter than Hugh, and who was washing in a tin basin, could be the commander of all these soldierly-looking men, many of whom were old enough to be his father.  \"Yes, I'm the lieutenant-colonel. I'm in command,\" said the gentleman, smiling at him over the towel.  Something made Frank understand that this was really the officer, and he gave his message, which was received with many expressions of thanks.  \"Won't you get down? Here, Campbell, take this horse, will you?\" he called to a soldier, as Frank sprang from his horse. The orderly stepped forward and took the bridle.  \"Now, come with me,\" said the colonel, leading the way. \"We must get ready to receive your mother. There are some ladies coming--and breakfast,\" he called to a group who were engaged in the same occupation he had just ended, and whom Frank knew by instinct to be officers.  The information seemed to electrify the little knot addressed; for they began to rush around, and in a few moments they all were in their uniforms, and surrounding the colonel, who, having brushed his hair with the aid of a little glass hung on a bush, had hurried into his coat and was buckling on his sword and giving orders in a way which at once satisfied Frank that he was every inch a colonel.  \"Now let us go and receive your mother,\" said he to the boy. As he strode through the camp with his coat tightly buttoned, his soft hat set jauntily on the side of his head, his plumes sweeping over its side, and his sword clattering at his spurred heel, he presented a very different appearance from that which he had made a little before, with his head in a tin basin, and his face covered with lather. In fact, Colonel Marshall was already a noted officer, and before the end of the war he attained still higher rank and reputation.  The colonel met the rest of the party at the bridge, and introduced himself and several officers who soon joined him. The negroes were directed to take the provisions over to the other side of the stream into the camp, and in a little while the whole regiment were enjoying the breakfast. The boys and their mother had at the colonel's request joined his mess, in which was one of their cousins, the brother of their cousin Belle.  The gentlemen could eat scarcely anything, they were so busy attending to the wants of the ladies. The colonel, particularly, waited on their cousin Belle all the time.  As soon as they had finished the colonel left them, and a bugle blew. In a minute all was bustle. Officers were giving orders; horses were saddled and brought out; and by what seemed magic to the boys, the men, who just before were scattered about among the trees laughing and eating, were standing by their horses all in proper order. The colonel and the officers came and said good-bye.  Again the bugle blew. Every man was in his saddle. A few words by the colonel, followed by other words from the captains, and the column started, turning across the bridge, the feet of the horses thundering on the planks. Then the regiment wound up the hill at a walk, the men singing snatches of a dozen songs of which \"The Bonnie Blue Flag,\" \"Lorena,\" and \"Carry Me Back to Old Virginia Shore,\" were the chief ones.  It seemed to the boys that to be a soldier was the noblest thing on earth; and that this regiment could do anything.     CHAPTER IV.   After this it became a common thing for passing regiments to camp near Oakland, and the fire blazed many a night, cooking for the soldiers, till the chickens were crowing in the morning. The negroes all had hen-houses and raised their own chickens, and when a camp was near them they used to drive a thriving trade on their own account, selling eggs and chickens to the privates while the officers were entertained in the \"gret house.\"  It was thought an honor to furnish food to the soldiers. Every soldier was to the boys a hero, and each young officer might rival Ivanhoe or Coeur de Lion.  It was not a great while, however, before they learned that all soldiers were not like their favorite knights. At any rate, thefts were frequent. The absence of men from the plantations, and the constant passing of strangers made stealing easy; hen-roots were robbed time after time, and even pigs and sheep were taken without any trace of the thieves. The boys' hen-house, however, which was in the yard, had never been troubled. It was about their only possession, and they took great pride in it.  One night the boys were fast asleep in their room in the office, with old Bruno and Nick curled up on their sheep-skins on the floor. Hugh was away, so the boys were the only \"men\" on the place, and felt that they were the protectors of the plantation. The frequent thefts had made every one very suspicious, and the boys had made up their minds to be on the watch, and, if possible, to catch the thief.  The negroes said that the deserters did the stealing.  On the night in question, the boys were sound asleep when old Bruno gave a low growl, and then began walking and sniffing up and down the room. Soon Nick gave a sharp, quick bark.  Frank waked first. He was not startled, for the dogs were in the habit of barking whenever they wished to go out-of-doors. Now, however, they kept it up, and it was in a strain somewhat different from their usual signal.  \"What's the matter with you? Go and lie down, Bruno,\" called Frank. \"Hush up, Nick!\" But Bruno would not lie down, and Nick would not keep quiet, though at the sound of Frank's voice they felt less responsibility, and contented themselves with a low growling.  After a little while Frank was on the point of dropping off to sleep again, when he heard a sound out in the yard, which at once thoroughly awakened him. He nudged Willy in the side.  \"Willy--Willy, wake up; there's some one moving around outdoors.\"  \"Umm-mm,\" groaned Willy, turning over and settling himself for another nap.  The sound of a chicken chirping out in fright reached Frank's ear.  \"Wake up, Willy!\" he called, pinching him hard. \"There's some one at the hen-house.\"  Willy was awake in a second. The boys consulted as to what should be done. Willy was sceptical. He thought Frank had been dreaming, or that it was only Uncle Balla, or \"some one\" moving about the yard. But a second cackle of warning reached them, and in a minute both boys were out of bed pulling on their clothes with trembling impatience.  \"Let's go and wake Uncle Balla,\" proposed Willy, getting himself all tangled in the legs of his trousers.  \"No; I'll tell you what, let's catch him ourselves,\" suggested Frank.  \"All right,\" assented Willy. \"We'll catch him and lock him up; suppose he's got a pistol? your gun maybe won't go off; it doesn't always burst the cap.\"  \"Well, your old musket is loaded, and you can hold him, while I snap the cap at him, and get it ready.\"  \"All right--I can't find my jacket--I'll hold him.\"  \"Where in the world is my hat?\" whispered Frank. \"Never mind, it must be in the house. Let's go out the back way. We can get out without his hearing us.\"  \"What shall we do with the dogs? Let's shut them up.\"  \"No, let's take 'em with us. We can keep them quiet and hold 'em in, and they can track him if he gets away.\"  \"All right;\" and the boys slowly opened the door, and crept stealthily out, Frank clutching his double-barrelled gun, and Willy hugging a heavy musket which he had found and claimed as one of the prizes of war. It was almost pitch-dark.  They decided that one should take one side of the hen-house, and one the other side (in such a way that if they had to shoot, they would almost certainly shoot one another!) but before they had separated both dogs jerked loose from their hands and dashed away in the darkness, barking furiously.  \"There he goes round the garden,\" shouted Willy, as the sound of footsteps like those of a man running with all his might came from the direction which the dogs had taken.  \"Come on,\" and both started; but, after taking a few steps, they stopped to listen so that they might trace the fugitive.  A faint noise behind them arrested their attention, and Frank tiptoed back toward the hen-house. It was too dark to see much, but he heard the hen-house door creak, and was conscious even in the darkness that it was being pushed slowly open.  \"Here's one, Willy,\" he shouted, at the same time putting his gun to his shoulder and pulling the trigger. The hammer fell with a sharp \"click\" just as the door was snatched to with a bang. The cap had failed to explode, or the chicken-eating days of the individual in the hen-house would have ended then and there.  The boys stood for some moments with their guns pointed at the door of the hen-house expecting the person within to attempt to burst out; but the click of the hammer and their hurried conference without, in which it was promptly agreed to let him have both barrels if he appeared, reconciled him to remaining within.  After some time it was decided to go and wake Uncle Balla, and confer with him as to the proper disposition of their captive. Accordingly, Frank went off to obtain help, while Willy remained to watch the hen-house. As Frank left he called back:  \"Willy, you take good aim at him, and if he pokes his head out--let him have it!\"  This Willy solemnly promised to do.  Frank was hardly out of hearing before Willy was surprised to hear the prisoner call him by name in the most friendly and familiar manner, although the voice was a strange one.  \"Willy, is that you?\" called the person inside.  \"Yes.\"  \"Where's Frank?\"  \"Gone to get Uncle Balla.\"  \"Did"]]]
