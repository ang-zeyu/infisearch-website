When we further take into consideration that only in the reign of Hezekiah was the brazen serpent, preserved in the temple and believed to be the work of Moses, destroyed, and the practice of offering incense to it, that is, worshipping it, abolished--that Jeroboam could set up \"calves of gold\" for Israel to worship, with apparently none but a political object, and certainly with no notion of creating a schism among the worshippers of Jahveh, or of repelling the men of Judah from his standard--it seems obvious, either that the Israelites of the tenth and eleventh centuries B.C. knew not the second commandment, or that they construed it merely as part of the prohibition to worship any supreme god other than Jahveh, which precedes it.  In seeking for information about the teraphim, I lighted upon the following passage in the valuable article on that subject by Archdeacon Farrar, in Ritto's \"Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature,\" which is so much to the purpose of my argument, that I venture to quote it in full:--     The main and certain results of this review are that the    teraphim were rude human images; that the use of them was an    antique Aramaic custom; that there is reason to suppose them to    have been images of deceased ancestors; that they were consulted    oracularly; that they were not confined to Jews; that their use    continued down to the latest period of Jewish history;    and lastly, that although the enlightened prophets and strictest    later kings regarded them as idolatrous, the priests were much    less averse to such images, and their cult was not considered in    any way repugnant to the pious worship of Elohim, nay, even to    the worship of him \"under the awful title of Jehovah.\" In fact,    they involved _a monotheistic idolatry very different indeed    from polytheism;_ and the tolerance of them by priests, as    compared with the denunciation of them by the prophets, offers a    close analogy to the views of the Roman Catholics respecting    pictures and images as compared with the views of Protestants.    It was against this use of idolatrous symbols and emblems in a    monotheistic worship that the _second_ commandment was    directed, whereas the first is aimed against the graver sin of    direct polytheism. But the whole history of Israel shows how    utterly and how early the law must have fallen into desuetude.    The worship of the golden calf and of the calves at Dan and    Bethel, against which, so far as we know, neither Elijah nor    Elisha said a single word; the tolerance of high places,    teraphim and betylia; the offering of incense for centuries to    the brazen serpent destroyed by Hezekiah; the occasional    glimpses of the most startling irregularities sanctioned    apparently even in the temple worship itself, prove most    decisively that a pure monotheism and an independence of symbols    was the result of a slow and painful course of God's disciplinal    dealings among the noblest thinkers of a single nation, and not,    as is so constantly and erroneously urged, the instinct of the    whole Semitic race; in other words, one single branch of the    Semites was under God's providence _educated_ into pure    monotheism only by centuries of misfortune and series of    inspired men (vol. iii. p. 986).  It appears to me that the researches of the anthropologist lead him to conclusions identical in substance, if not in terms, with those here enunciated as the result of a careful study of the same subject from a totally different point of view.  There is abundant evidence in the books of Samuel and elsewhere that an article of dress termed an _ephod_ was supposed to have a peculiar efficacy in enabling the wearer to exercise divination by means of Jahveh-Elohim. Great and long continued have been the disputes as to the exact nature of the ephod--whether it always means something to wear, or whether it sometimes means an image. But the probabilities are that it usually signifies a kind of waistcoat or broad zone, with shoulder-straps, which the person who \"inquired of Jahveh\" put on. In 1 Samuel xxiii. 2 David appears to have inquired without an ephod, for Abiathar the priest is said to have \"come down with an ephod in his hand\" only subsequently. And then David asks for it before inquiring of Jahveh whether the men of Keilah would betray him or not. David's action is obviously divination pure and simple; and it is curious that he seems to have worn the ephod himself and not to have employed Abiathar as a medium. How the answer was given is not clear though the probability is that it was obtained by casting lots. The _Urim_ and _Thummim_ seem to have been two such lots of a peculiarly sacred character, which were carried in the pocket of the high priest's \"breastplate.\" This last was worn along with the ephod.  With the exception of one passage (1 Sam. xiv. 18) the ark is ignored in the history of Saul. But in this place the Septuagint reads \"ephod\" for ark, while in 1 Chronicles xiii. 3 David says that \"we sought not unto it [the ark] in the days of Saul.\" Nor does Samuel seem to have paid any regard to the ark after its return from Philistia; though, in his childhood, he is said to have slept in \"the temple of Jahveh, where the ark of Elohim was\" (1 Sam. iii. 3), at Shiloh and there to have been the seer of the earliest apparitions vouchsafed to him by Jahveh. The space between the cherubim or winged images on the canopy or cover (_Kapporeth_) of this holy chest was held to be the special seat of Jahveh--the place selected for a temporary residence of the Supreme Elohim who had, after Aaron and Phineas, Eli and his sons for priests and seers. And, when the ark was carried to the camp at Eben-ezer, there can be no doubt that the Israelites, no less than the Philistines, held that \"Elohim is come into the camp\" (iv. 7), and that the one, as much as the other, conceived that the Israelites had summoned to their aid a powerful ally in \"these (or this) mighty Elohim\"--elsewhere called Jahve-Sabaoth, the Jahveh of Hosts. If the \"temple\" at Shiloh was the pentateuchal tabernacle, as is suggested by the name of \"tent of meeting\" given to it in 1 Samuel ii. 22, it was essentially a large tent, though constituted of very expensive and ornate materials; if, on the other hand, it was a different edifice, there can be little doubt that this \"house of Jahveh\" was built on the model of an ordinary house of the time. But there is not the slightest evidence that, during the reign of Saul, any greater importance attached to this seat of the cult of Jahveh than to others. Sanctuaries, and \"high places\" for sacrifice, were scattered all over the country from Dan to Beersheba. And, as Samuel is said to have gone up to one of these high places to bless the sacrifice, it may be taken for tolerably certain that he knew nothing of the Levitical laws which severely condemn the high places and those who sacrifice away from the sanctuary hallowed by the presence of the ark.  There is no evidence that, during the time of the Judges and of Samuel, any one occupied the position of the high priest of later days. And persons who were neither priests nor Levites sacrificed and divined or \"inquired of Jahveh,\" when they pleased and where they pleased, without the least indication that they, or any one else in Israel at that time, knew they were doing wrong. There is no allusion to any special observance of the Sabbath; and the references to circumcision are indirect.  Such are the chief articles of the theological creed of the old Israelites, which are made known to us by the direct evidence of the ancient record to which we have had recourse, and they are as remarkable for that which they contain as for that which is absent from them. They reveal a firm conviction that, when death takes place, a something termed a soul or spirit leaves the body and continues to exist in Sheol for a period of indefinite duration, even though there is no proof of any belief in absolute immortality; that such spirits can return to earth to possess and inspire the living; that they are, in appearance and in disposition, likenesses of the men to whom they belonged, but that, as spirits, they have larger powers and are freer from physical limitations; that they thus form a group among a number of kinds of spiritual existences known as Elohim, of whom Jahveh, the national God of Israel, is one; that, consistently with this view, Jahveh was conceived as a sort of spirit, human in aspect and in senses, and with many human passions, but with immensely greater intelligence and power than any other Elohim, whether human or divine. Further, the evidence proves that this belief was the basis of the Jahveh-worship to which Samuel and his followers were devoted; that there is strong reason for believing, and none for doubting, that idolatry, in the shape of the worship of the family gods or teraphim, was practised by sincere and devout Jahveh-worshippers; that the ark, with its protective tent or tabernacle, was regarded as a specially, but by no means exclusively, favoured sanctuary of Jahveh; that the ephod appears to have had a particular value for those who desired to divine by the help of Jahveh; and that divination by lots was practised before Jahveh. On the other hand, there is not the slightest evidence of any belief in retribution after death, but the contrary; ritual obligations have at least as strong sanction as moral; there are clear indications that some of the most stringent of the Levitical laws were unknown even to Samuel; priests often appear to be superseded by laymen, even in the performance of sacrifices and divination; and no line of demarcation can be drawn between necromancer, wizard,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2634"],["title","The Evolution of Theology: an Anthropological Study (#4)"],["body","er, prophet, and priest, each of whom is regarded, like all the rest, as a medium of communication between the world of Elohim and that of living men.  The theological system thus defined offers to the anthropologist no feature which is devoid of a parallel in the known theologies of other races of mankind, even of those who inhabit parts of the world most remote from Palestine. And the foundation of the whole, the ghost theory, is exactly that theological speculation which is the most widely spread of all, and the most deeply rooted among uncivilised men. I am able to base this statement, to some extent, on facts within my own knowledge. In December 1848, H.M.S. _Rattlesnake,_ the ship to which I then belonged, was anchored off Mount Ernest, an island in Torres Straits. The people were few and well disposed; and, when a friend of mine (whom I will call B.) and I went ashore, we made acquaintance with an old native, Paouda by name. In course of time we became quite intimate with the old gentleman, partly by the rendering of mutual good offices, but chiefly because Paouda believed he had discovered that B. was his father-in-law. And his grounds for this singular conviction were very remarkable. We had made a long stay at Cape York hard by; and, in accordance with a theory which is widely spread among the Australians, that white men are the reincarnated spirits of black men, B. was held to be the ghost, or _narki,_ of a certain Mount Ernest native, one Antarki, who had lately died, on the ground of some real or fancied resemblance to the latter. Now Paouda had taken to wife a daughter of Antarki's, named Domani, and as soon as B. informed him that he was the ghost of Antarki, Paouda at once admitted the relationship and acted upon it. For, as all the women on the island had hidden away in fear of the ship, and we were anxious to see what they were like, B. pleaded pathetically with Paouda that it would be very unkind not to let him see his daughter and grandchildren. After a good deal of hesitation and the exaction of pledges of deep secrecy, Paouda consented to take B., and myself as B.'s friend, to see Domani and the three daughters, by whom B. was received quite as one of the family, while I was courteously welcomed on his account.  This scene made an impression upon me which is not yet effaced. It left no question on my mind of the sincerity of the strange ghost theory of these savages, and of the influence which their belief has on their practical life. I had it in my mind, as well as many a like result of subsequent anthropological studies, when, in 1869, [14] I wrote as follows:--     There are savages without God in any proper sense of the word,    but none without ghosts. And the Fetishism, Ancestor-worship,    Hero-worship, and Demonology of primitive savages are all, I    believe, different manners of expression of their belief in    ghosts, and of the anthropomorphic interpretation of out-of-the-    way events which is its concomitant. Witchcraft and sorcery are    the practical expressions of these beliefs; and they stand in    the same relation to religious worship as the simple    anthropomorphism of children or savages does to theology.  I do not quote myself with any intention of making a claim to originality in putting forth this view; for I have since discovered that the same conception is virtually contained in the great \"Discours sur l'Histoire Universelle\" of Bossuet, now more than two centuries old: [15]--     Le culte des hommes morta faisoit presque tout le fond de    l'idolatrie; presque tous les hommes sacrificient aux manes,    c'est-a-dire aux ames des morts. De si anciennes erreurs nous    font voir a la verite combien etoit ancienne la croyance de    l'immortalite de l'ame, et nous montrent qu'elle doit etre    rangee parmi les premieres traditions du genre humain.    Mais l'homme, qui gatoit tout, en avoit etrangement abuse,    puisqu'elle le portoit a sacrificer aux morts. On alloit meme    jusqu'a cet exces, de leur sacrifier des hommes vivans; ou tuoit    leurs esclaves, et meme leurs femmes, pour les aller servir dans    l'autre monde.  Among more modern writers J. G. Muller, in his excellent \"Geschichte der amerikanischen Urreligionen\" (1855), clearly recognises \"gespensterhafter Geisterglaube\" as the foundation of all savage and semi-civilised theology, and I need do no more than mention the important developments of the same view which are to be found in Mr. Tylor's \"Primitive Culture,\" and in the writings of Mr. Herbert Spencer, especially his recently-published \"Ecclesiastical Institutions.\" [16]  It is a matter of fact that, whether we direct our attention to the older conditions of civilised societies, in Japan, in China, in Hindostan, in Greece, or in Rome, [17] we find, underlying all other theological notions, the belief in ghosts, with its inevitable concomitant sorcery; and a primitive cult, in the shape of a worship of ancestors, which is essentially an attempt to please, or appease their ghosts. The same thing is true of old Mexico and Peru, and of all the semi-civilised or savage peoples who have developed a definite cult; and in those who, like the natives of Australia, have not even a cult, the belief in, and fear of, ghosts is as strong as anywhere else. The most clearly demonstrable article of the theology of the Israelites in the eleventh and twelfth centuries B.C. is therefore simply the article which is to be found in all primitive theologies, namely, the belief that a man has a soul which continues to exist after death for a longer or shorter time, and may return, as a ghost, with a divine, or at least demonic, character, to influence for good or evil (and usually for evil) the affairs of the living. But the correspondence between the old Israelitic and other archaic forms of theology extends to details. If, in order to avoid all chance of direct communication, we direct our attention to the theology of semi-civilised people, such as the Polynesian Islanders, separated by the greatest possible distance, and by every conceivable physical barrier, from the inhabitants of Palestine, we shall find not merely that all the features of old Israelitic theology, which are revealed in the records cited, are found among them; but that extant information as to the inner mind of these people tends to remove many of the difficulties which those who have not studied anthropology find in the Hebrew narrative.  One of the best sources, if not the best source, of information on these topics is Mariner's _Tonga Islands,_ which tells us of the condition of Cook's \"Friendly Islanders\" eighty years ago, before European influence was sensibly felt among them. Mariner, a youth of fair education and of no inconsiderable natural ability (as the work which was drawn up from the materials he furnished shows), was about fifteen years of age when his ship was attacked and plundered by the Tongans: he remained four years in the islands, familiarised himself with the language, lived the life of the people, became intimate with many of them, and had every opportunity of acquainting himself with their opinions, as well as with their habits and customs. He seems to have been devoid of prejudices, theological or other, and the impression of strict accuracy which his statements convey has been justified by all the knowledge of Polynesian life which has been subsequently acquired.  It is desirable, therefore, to pay close attention to that which Mariner tells us about the theological views of these people: [18]--     The human soul, after its separation from the body, is    termed a _hotooa_ (a god or spirit), and is believed to    exist in the shape of the body; to have the same propensities as    during life, but to be corrected by a more enlightened    understanding, by which it readily distinguishes good from evil,    truth from falsehood, right from wrong; having the same    attributes as the original gods, but in a minor degree, and    having its dwelling for ever in the happy regions of Bolotoo,    holding the same rank in regard to other souls as during this    life; it has, however, the power of returning to Tonga to    inspire priests, relations, or others, or to appear in dreams to    those it wishes to admonish; and sometimes to the external eye    in the form of a ghost or apparition; but this power of    reappearance at Tonga particularly belongs to the souls of    chiefs rather than of matabooles. (vol. ii. p. 130).  The word \"hotooa\" is the same as that which is usually spelt \"atua\" by Polynesian philologues, and it will be convenient to adopt this spelling. Now under this head of \"_Atuas_ or supernatural intelligent beings\" the Tongans include:--  \"1. The original gods. 2. The souls of nobles that have all attributes in common with the first but inferior in degree. 3. The souls of matabooles [19] that are still inferior, and have not the power as the two first have of coming back to Tonga to inspire the priest, though they are supposed to have the power of appearing to their relatives. 4. The original attendants or servants, as it were, of the gods, who, although they had their origin and have ever since existed in Bolotoo, are still inferior to the third class. 5. The _Atua pow_ or mischievous gods. 6. _Mooi,_ or the god that supports the earth and does not belong to Bolotoo (vol. ii. pp. 103, 104).\"  From this it appears that the \"Atuas\" of the Polynesian are exactly equivalent to the \"Elohim\" of the old Israelite. [20] They comprise everything spiritual, from a ghost to a god, and from \"the merely tutelar gods to particular private families\" (vol, ii. p. 104), to Ta-li-y-Tooboo, who was the national god of Tonga. The Tongans had no doubt that these Atuas daily and hourly influenced their destinies and could, conversely, be influenced by them. Hence their \"piety,\" the incessant acts of sacrificial worship which occupied their lives, and their belief in omens and charms."]]]
