SPEED. SPRINGFIELD, May 18, 1843.  DEAR SPEED:--Yours of the 9th instant is duly received, which I do not meet as a \"bore,\" but as a most welcome visitor. I will answer the business part of it first.  In relation to our Congress matter here, you were right in supposing I would support the nominee. Neither Baker nor I, however, is the man, but Hardin, so far as I can judge from present appearances. We shall have no split or trouble about the matter; all will be harmony. In relation to the \"coming events\" about which Butler wrote you, I had not heard one word before I got your letter; but I have so much confidence in the judgment of Butler on such a subject that I incline to think there may be some reality in it. What day does Butler appoint? By the way, how do \"events\" of the same sort come on in your family? Are you possessing houses and lands, and oxen and asses, and men-servants and maid-servants, and begetting sons and daughters? We are not keeping house, but boarding at the Globe Tavern, which is very well kept now by a widow lady of the name of Beck. Our room (the same that Dr. Wallace occupied there) and boarding only costs us four dollars a week. Ann Todd was married something more than a year since to a fellow by the name of Campbell, and who, Mary says, is pretty much of a \"dunce,\" though he has a little money and property. They live in Boonville, Missouri, and have not been heard from lately enough for me to say anything about her health. I reckon it will scarcely be in our power to visit Kentucky this year. Besides poverty and the necessity of attending to business, those \"coming events,\" I suspect, would be somewhat in the way. I most heartily wish you and your Fanny would not fail to come. Just let us know the time, and we will have a room provided for you at our house, and all be merry together for a while. Be sure to give my respects to your mother and family; assure her that if ever I come near her, I will not fail to call and see her. Mary joins in sending love to your Fanny and you.  Yours as ever,  A. LINCOLN.     1844     TO Gen. J. J. HARDIN.  SPRINGFIELD, May 21, 1844.  DEAR HARDIN: Knowing that you have correspondents enough, I have forborne to trouble you heretofore; and I now only do so to get you to set a matter right which has got wrong with one of our best friends. It is old Uncle Thomas Campbell of Spring Creek--(Berlin P.O.). He has received several documents from you, and he says they are old newspapers and documents, having no sort of interest in them. He is, therefore, getting a strong impression that you treat him with disrespect. This, I know, is a mistaken impression; and you must correct it. The way, I leave to yourself. Rob't W. Canfield says he would like to have a document or two from you.  The Locos (Democrats) here are in considerable trouble about Van Buren's letter on Texas, and the Virginia electors. They are growing sick of the Tariff question; and consequently are much confounded at V.B.'s cutting them off from the new Texas question. Nearly half the leaders swear they won't stand it. Of those are Ford, T. Campbell, Ewing, Calhoun and others. They don't exactly say they won't vote for V.B., but they say he will not be the candidate, and that they are for Texas anyhow.  As ever yours,  A. LINCOLN.     1845     SELECTION OF CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES  TO Gen. J. J. HARDIN, SPRINGFIELD, Jany. 19, 1845.  DEAR GENERAL:  I do not wish to join in your proposal of a new plan for the selection of a Whig candidate for Congress because:  1st. I am entirely satisfied with the old system under which you and Baker were successively nominated and elected to Congress; and because the Whigs of the district are well acquainted with the system, and, so far as I know or believe, are well satisfied with it. If the old system be thought to be vague, as to all the delegates of the county voting the same way, or as to instructions to them as to whom they are to vote for, or as to filling vacancies, I am willing to join in a provision to make these matters certain.  2d. As to your proposals that a poll shall be opened in every precinct, and that the whole shall take place on the same day, I do not personally object. They seem to me to be not unfair; and I forbear to join in proposing them only because I choose to leave the decision in each county to the Whigs of the county, to be made as their own judgment and convenience may dictate.  3d. As to your proposed stipulation that all the candidates shall remain in their own counties, and restrain their friends in the same it seems to me that on reflection you will see the fact of your having been in Congress has, in various ways, so spread your name in the district as to give you a decided advantage in such a stipulation. I appreciate your desire to keep down excitement; and I promise you to \"keep cool\" under all circumstances.  4th. I have already said I am satisfied with the old system under which such good men have triumphed and that I desire no departure from its principles. But if there must be a departure from it, I shall insist upon a more accurate and just apportionment of delegates, or representative votes, to the constituent body, than exists by the old, and which you propose to retain in your new plan. If we take the entire population of the counties as shown by the late census, we shall see by the old plan, and by your proposed new plan,     Morgan County, with a population 16,541, has but ....... 8 votes    While Sangamon with 18,697--2156 greater has but ....... 8  \"    So Scott with 6553 has ................................. 4  \"    While Tazewell with 7615 1062 greater has but .......... 4  \"    So Mason with 3135 has ................................. 1 vote    While Logan with 3907, 772 greater, has but ............ 1  \"  And so on in a less degree the matter runs through all the counties, being not only wrong in principle, but the advantage of it being all manifestly in your favor with one slight exception, in the comparison of two counties not here mentioned.  Again, if we take the Whig votes of the counties as shown by the late Presidential election as a basis, the thing is still worse.  It seems to me most obvious that the old system needs adjustment in nothing so much as in this; and still, by your proposal, no notice is taken of it. I have always been in the habit of acceding to almost any proposal that a friend would make and I am truly sorry that I cannot in this. I perhaps ought to mention that some friends at different places are endeavoring to secure the honor of the sitting of the convention at their towns respectively, and I fear that they would not feel much complimented if we shall make a bargain that it should sit nowhere.  Yours as ever,  A. LINCOLN.     TO ------ WILLIAMS,  SPRINGFIELD, March 1, 1845.  FRIEND WILLIAMS:  The Supreme Court adjourned this morning for the term. Your cases of Reinhardt vs. Schuyler, Bunce vs. Schuyler, Dickhut vs. Dunell, and Sullivan vs. Andrews are continued. Hinman vs. Pope I wrote you concerning some time ago. McNutt et al. vs. Bean and Thompson is reversed and remanded.  Fitzpatrick vs. Brady et al. is reversed and remanded with leave to complainant to amend his bill so as to show the real consideration given for the land.  Bunce against Graves the court confirmed, wherefore, in accordance with your directions, I moved to have the case remanded to enable you to take a new trial in the court below. The court allowed the motion; of which I am glad, and I guess you are.  This, I believe, is all as to court business. The canal men have got their measure through the Legislature pretty much or quite in the shape they desired. Nothing else now.  Yours as ever,  A. LINCOLN.     ABOLITION MOVEMENT  TO WILLIAMSON DURLEY.  SPRINGFIELD, October 3, 1845  When I saw you at home, it was agreed that I should write to you and your brother Madison. Until I then saw you I was not aware of your being what is generally called an abolitionist, or, as you call yourself, a Liberty man, though I well knew there were many such in your country.  I was glad to hear that you intended to attempt to bring about, at the next election in Putnam, a Union of the Whigs proper and such of the Liberty men as are Whigs in principle on all questions save only that of slavery. So far as I can perceive, by such union neither party need yield anything on the point in difference between them. If the Whig abolitionists of New York had voted with us last fall, Mr. Clay would now be President, Whig principles in the ascendant, and Texas not annexed; whereas, by the division, all that either had at stake in the contest was lost. And, indeed, it was extremely probable, beforehand, that such would be the result. As I always understood, the Liberty men deprecated the annexation of Texas extremely; and this being so, why they should refuse to cast their votes [so] as to prevent it, even to me seemed wonderful. What was their process of reasoning, I can only judge from what a single one of them told me. It was this: \"We are not to do evil that good may come.\" This general proposition is doubtless correct; but did it apply? If by your votes you could have prevented the extension, etc., of slavery would it not have been good, and not evil, so to have used your votes, even though it involved the casting of them for a slaveholder? By the fruit the tree is to be known. An evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit. If the fruit of electing Mr. Clay would have been to prevent the extension of slavery, could the act of electing have been evil?  But I will not argue further. I perhaps ought to say that individually I never was much interested in the Texas question. I never could see much good to come of annexation, inasmuch as they were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2654"],["title","The Papers and Writings of Abraham Lincoln — Volume 2: 1843-1858 (#1)"],["body"," a free republican people on our own model. On the other hand, I never could very clearly see how the annexation would augment the evil of slavery. It always seemed to me that slaves would be taken there in about equal numbers, with or without annexation. And if more were taken because of annexation, still there would be just so many the fewer left where they were taken from. It is possibly true, to some extent, that, with annexation, some slaves may be sent to Texas and continued in slavery that otherwise might have been liberated. To whatever extent this may be true, I think annexation an evil. I hold it to be a paramount duty of us in the free States, due to the Union of the States, and perhaps to liberty itself (paradox though it may seem), to let the slavery of the other States alone; while, on the other hand, I hold it to be equally clear that we should never knowingly lend ourselves, directly or indirectly, to prevent that slavery from dying a natural death--to find new places for it to live in when it can no longer exist in the old. Of course I am not now considering what would be our duty in cases of insurrection among the slaves. To recur to the Texas question, I understand the Liberty men to have viewed annexation as a much greater evil than ever I did; and I would like to convince you, if I could, that they could have prevented it, if they had chosen. I intend this letter for you and Madison together; and if you and he or either shall think fit to drop me a line, I shall be pleased.  Yours with respect,  A. LINCOLN.     1846     REQUEST FOR POLITICAL SUPPORT  TO Dr. ROBERT BOAL. SPRINGFIELD, January 7, 1846.  Dr. ROBERT BOAL, Lacon, Ill.  DEAR DOCTOR:--Since I saw you last fall, I have often thought of writing to you, as it was then understood I would, but, on reflection, I have always found that I had nothing new to tell you. All has happened as I then told you I expected it would--Baker's declining, Hardin's taking the track, and so on.  If Hardin and I stood precisely equal, if neither of us had been to Congress, or if we both had, it would only accord with what I have always done, for the sake of peace, to give way to him; and I expect I should do it. That I can voluntarily postpone my pretensions, when they are no more than equal to those to which they are postponed, you have yourself seen. But to yield to Hardin under present circumstances seems to me as nothing else than yielding to one who would gladly sacrifice me altogether. This I would rather not submit to. That Hardin is talented, energetic, usually generous and magnanimous, I have before this affirmed to you and do not deny. You know that my only argument is that \"turn about is fair play.\" This he, practically at least, denies.  If it would not be taxing you too much, I wish you would write me, telling the aspect of things in your country, or rather your district; and also, send the names of some of your Whig neighbors, to whom I might, with propriety, write. Unless I can get some one to do this, Hardin, with his old franking list, will have the advantage of me. My reliance for a fair shake (and I want nothing more) in your country is chiefly on you, because of your position and standing, and because I am acquainted with so few others. Let me hear from you soon.  Yours truly,  A. LINCOLN.     TO JOHN BENNETT.  SPRINGFIELD, Jan. 15, 1846.  JOHN BENNETT.  FRIEND JOHN:  Nathan Dresser is here, and speaks as though the contest between Hardin and me is to be doubtful in Menard County. I know he is candid and this alarms me some. I asked him to tell me the names of the men that were going strong for Hardin, he said Morris was about as strong as any-now tell me, is Morris going it openly? You remember you wrote me that he would be neutral. Nathan also said that some man, whom he could not remember, had said lately that Menard County was going to decide the contest and that made the contest very doubtful. Do you know who that was? Don't fail to write me instantly on receiving this, telling me all--particularly the names of those who are going strong against me.  Yours as ever,  A. LINCOLN.     TO N. J. ROCKWELL.  SPRINGFIELD, January 21, 1846.  DEAR SIR:--You perhaps know that General Hardin and I have a contest for the Whig nomination for Congress for this district.  He has had a turn and my argument is \"turn about is fair play.\"  I shall be pleased if this strikes you as a sufficient argument.  Yours truly,  A. LINCOLN.     TO JAMES BERDAN.  SPRINGFIELD, April 26, 1846.  DEAR SIR:--I thank you for the promptness with which you answered my letter from Bloomington. I also thank you for the frankness with which you comment upon a certain part of my letter; because that comment affords me an opportunity of trying to express myself better than I did before, seeing, as I do, that in that part of my letter, you have not understood me as I intended to be understood.  In speaking of the \"dissatisfaction\" of men who yet mean to do no wrong, etc., I mean no special application of what I said to the Whigs of Morgan, or of Morgan & Scott. I only had in my mind the fact that previous to General Hardin's withdrawal some of his friends and some of mine had become a little warm; and I felt, and meant to say, that for them now to meet face to face and converse together was the best way to efface any remnant of unpleasant feeling, if any such existed.  I did not suppose that General Hardin's friends were in any greater need of having their feelings corrected than mine were. Since I saw you at Jacksonville, I have had no more suspicion of the Whigs of Morgan than of those of any other part of the district. I write this only to try to remove any impression that I distrust you and the other Whigs of your country.  Yours truly,  A. LINCOLN.     TO JAMES BERDAN.  SPRINGFIELD, May 7, 1866.  DEAR SIR:--It is a matter of high moral obligation, if not of necessity, for me to attend the Coles and Edwards courts. I have some cases in both of them, in which the parties have my promise, and are depending upon me. The court commences in Coles on the second Monday, and in Edgar on the third. Your court in Morgan commences on the fourth Monday; and it is my purpose to be with you then, and make a speech. I mention the Coles and Edgar courts in order that if I should not reach Jacksonville at the time named you may understand the reason why. I do not, however, think there is much danger of my being detained; as I shall go with a purpose not to be, and consequently shall engage in no new cases that might delay me.  Yours truly,  A. LINCOLN.     VERSES WRITTEN BY LINCOLN AFTER A VISIT TO HIS OLD HOME IN INDIANA  (A FRAGMENT).  [In December, 1847, when Lincoln was stumping for Clay, he crossed into Indiana and revisited his old home. He writes: \"That part of the country is within itself as unpoetical as any spot on earth; but still seeing it and its objects and inhabitants aroused feelings in me which were certainly poetry; though whether my expression of these feelings is poetry, is quite another question.\"]     Near twenty years have passed away    Since here I bid farewell    To woods and fields, and scenes of play,    And playmates loved so well.     Where many were, but few remain    Of old familiar things;    But seeing them to mind again    The lost and absent brings.     The friends I left that parting day,    How changed, as time has sped!    Young childhood grown, strong manhood gray,    And half of all are dead.     I hear the loved survivors tell    How naught from death could save,    Till every sound appears a knell,    And every spot a grave.     I range the fields with pensive tread,    And pace the hollow rooms,    And feel (companion of the dead)    I 'm living in the tombs.     VERSES WRITTEN BY LINCOLN CONCERNING A SCHOOL-FELLOW    WHO BECAME INSANE--(A FRAGMENT).     And when at length the drear and long    Time soothed thy fiercer woes,    How plaintively thy mournful song    Upon the still night rose     I've heard it oft as if I dreamed,    Far distant, sweet and lone;    The funeral dirge it ever seemed    Of reason dead and gone.     Air held her breath; trees with the spell    Seemed sorrowing angels round,    Whose swelling tears in dewdrops fell    Upon the listening ground.     But this is past, and naught remains    That raised thee o'er the brute;    Thy piercing shrieks and soothing strains    Are like, forever mute.     Now fare thee well! More thou the cause    Than subject now of woe.    All mental pangs by time's kind laws    Hast lost the power to know.     O Death! thou awe-inspiring prince    That keepst the world in fear,    Why dost thou tear more blest ones hence,    And leave him lingering here?     SECOND CHILD  TO JOSHUA P. SPEED  SPRINGFIELD, October 22, 1846.  DEAR SPEED:--You, no doubt, assign the suspension of our correspondence to the true philosophic cause; though it must be confessed by both of us that this is rather a cold reason for allowing a friendship such as ours to die out by degrees. I propose now that, upon receipt of this, you shall be considered in my debt, and under obligations to pay soon, and that neither shall remain long in arrears hereafter. Are you agreed?  Being elected to Congress, though I am very grateful to our friends for having done it, has not pleased me as much as I expected.  We have another boy, born the 10th of March. He is very much such a child as Bob was at his age, rather of a longer order. Bob is \"short and low,\" and I expect always will be. He talks very plainly,--almost as plainly as anybody. He is quite smart enough. I sometimes fear that he is one of the little rare-ripe sort that are smarter at about five than ever after. He has a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the offspring of such animal spirits. Since I began this letter, a messenger came to tell me Bob was lost; but by the time I reached the house his mother had found him and had him whipped, and by now, very likely,"]]]
