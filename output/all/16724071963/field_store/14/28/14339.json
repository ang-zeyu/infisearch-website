The word \"thing\" where secondly used in this section includes only things _ejusdem generis_ with instrument and capable of being used to produce miscarriage (_R._ v. _Austin_ [1905] 24 N.Z.L.R. 893).  _Therapeutic Abortion._--In New Zealand, as in Great Britain and other countries, the medical profession has always held that when the mother's life is seriously endangered by a continuation of the pregnancy the termination of the pregnancy is justifiable and right.  This the law allows, not specifically but by inference.  It is probably a correct statement of the position to say that, with advances in medical knowledge and thought, even the most conservative medical opinion, apart from that which is influenced by certain religious views, holds that the indications for the termination of pregnancy have been extended somewhat to include not only cases in which the mother's life is immediately jeopardized, but also certain cases in which her life is more remotely endangered.  This view is supported by the social thought of to-day.  This is not to say that the occasions for this operation are frequent; they are, indeed, infrequent.  The general standards which guide the medical profession in this matter are very strict, and are conscientiously conformed to by the majority of its members.  It is also a well-recognized rule of the profession that such operations should only be performed after consultation between two medical practitioners.  With this change in medical outlook, however, there has been no corresponding alteration in the law, which, as it stands, is as uncompromising as ever, and allows of no interference except to save the _life_ of the mother.  It is a fact that the law is _interpreted_ liberally, and no doctor who has acted honestly in the belief that the mother's health was seriously endangered has ever been challenged.  Nevertheless, it has been urged by a large body of the medical profession, especially of those most intimately affected by the question, that there are possible dangers in the situation, and that the law should be altered to indicate more specifically the rightful position of the doctor in this matter; in other words, it is advocated that the present interpretation of the law should be incorporated in the law itself.  Much is made of the fact that an honourable practitioner occasionally finds himself in the unsatisfactory position of having actually to break the letter of the law in doing what according to accepted medical standards is in the best interests of the patient.  As safeguards against the possible dangers of a widening of the law, it has been suggested that new regulations should be introduced governing the practice of therapeutic abortion.  It has been recommended that operations should only be performed after adequate consultation, and that written certificates should be given by both parties to the consultation; that in certain cases the consultant should be a specialist; that all operations should be performed in public or licensed hospitals; that every therapeutic abortion should be notified to the Medical Officer of Health, to whom also the two certificates should be forwarded; and that every operation not performed under these conditions should be subject to strict investigation.  It has also been recommended by some that there should be a general notification of all abortions.  Those who are opposed to any alteration of the present state argue that any specific legalization of therapeutic abortion to save the serious impairment of health as well as to save life might lead to abuses of this sanction. They point out that even at the present time doctors differ considerably in their views and in their practice, and they fear that such divergences in thought and practice might be seriously exaggerated.  As to the suggested safeguarding regulations, there is by no means general agreement in the medical profession concerning their advisability or their value.  The Committee, having investigated the matter very fully, is satisfied that any disability under which the doctor rests in terminating a pregnancy for genuine, accepted therapeutic reasons is only theoretical.  No actual instance was brought before the Committee in which a doctor had been penalized or even subject to question when acting in good faith, nor was any evidence presented to show that any patient had suffered by reason of a doctor refraining from operating through fear of possible legal consequences.  Both medical and legal witnesses competent to speak on these medico-legal aspects were definite in their assurance that, under the existing law, no doctor acting in accordance with the accepted standards of the profession was in any danger.  The only person who need have any fear was one who ignored guidance of the existing standards of his profession, and to this extent the law was, at least in part, a deterrent against laxity of practice.  The Committee considers that, as it stands, the law has shown itself adaptable in practice to all reasonable changes in medical thought.  Further, the Committee was impressed by the possible dangers which might be associated with any alteration in the existing law.  While it is undoubtedly true that the majority of doctors are straightforward and honest in their interpretation of the indications for therapeutic abortion, it was made clear that even at the present time there are some who are inclined to terminate pregnancy for reasons which would not be accepted by most.  It would be quite impossible to lay down a hard-and-fast list of indications.  There are definite grounds for fearing that any alteration in the law would lead, in certain quarters, to a widening of the interpretations far beyond the intention of the alteration.  Under any alteration it would be exceedingly difficult to control the merging of the therapeutic into the social and economic reasons.  For these reasons, then, the Committee is not prepared to suggest any alteration in the law regarding therapeutic abortion; the Committee believes, however, that some benefit might accrue from the compulsory notification of all abortions to the Medical Officer of Health.  _Abortion for Social and Economic Reasons._--Having received certain representations in favour of this practice, and having examined a large mass of evidence on this subject, the Committee is utterly opposed to any consideration of the legalization of abortion for social and economic reasons.  The Committee does not hesitate to state its first objection on moral grounds.  That the deliberate destruction of embryo human lives should be allowed for all the varying and indeterminate reasons suggested by different advocates would lead the way to intolerable license.  We would draw your attention and that of the public to the extreme views which are held by some of the most active advocates of legalized abortion.  In its most blatant form this advocacy is based on the argument of woman's right to determine for herself whether a pregnancy shall continue or not.      \"The right to abortion should be taken quite away from legal     technicality and legal controversy. Up to the viability of her     child it is as much a woman's right as the removal of a dangerously     diseased appendix.\"  This is the view of Miss Stella Browne in her essay on \"The Right to Abortion\"[2] and of others who hold similar opinions.        [2] \"Abortion Spontaneous and Induced.\" Taussig.  Is any comment necessary?  The representative of one of the largest women's organizations in New Zealand who gave evidence before the Committee advocated the introduction of legislation permitting abortion under certain circumstances after a woman had had two children, subsequently qualifying the suggestion by the words \"if contraceptives fail.\"  In the case of such ill-considered opinions, the Committee believes that it would be impossible to limit the practice if the law were in any way relaxed.  Of course there are others who confine their advocacy of legalized abortion to cases in which there are elements of real tragedy and which appeal to public sympathy, but, granting that there are many cases in which social and economic conditions create situations of great hardship, nevertheless the Committee is fairly convinced that abortion is not justifiable; the remedies lie in the removal of the causes and the alleviation of these difficult situations by social legislation and other measures, and in the education of the public conscience.  The Committee is also opposed to the legalization of abortion for social reasons on account of the very considerable risks to health which are associated with the practice.  Medical witnesses were agreed that, while the immediate risk to life in surgically performed termination of pregnancy was slight, there were very definite possibilities of more remote disabilities, and that such sequel√¶ occurred in a considerable proportion of cases.  In the case of a genuine therapeutic abortion these risks are outweighed by the dangers of the condition calling for the termination of pregnancy, but were the operation to be performed freely for social reasons the effect in the community might be very serious.  World-wide interest has been aroused in the matter through the experience on Soviet Russia, where, for a number of years, abortion for social and economic reasons was legalized and extensively practised.  The operations were performed in special hospitals and by skilled operators.  At first it was claimed that when the operation was done openly and carefully the risk to life was exceedingly small. It was stated, for instance, that in 1926 artificial abortion was carried out on 29,306 women in Moscow with no mortality, and that in a total of 175,000 operations in Moscow there were only nine deaths.  But now come most significant reports of the after-effects to these operations, which state that 43 per cent. of these"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27070"],["title","Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Various Aspects of the Problem of (#8)"],["body","suffered from some definite illness as a result of the operation, and that \"the most enthusiastic Russian advocates of legalized abortion are appalled at the growing evidence of serious pelvic disturbances, endocrine dysfunctions, sterility, ectopic pregnancy, and other complications following in the wake of artificial abortions.\"[3]        [3] \"Abortion Spontaneous and Induced.\" Taussig.  A recognition of these remoter dangers has undoubtedly been an important factor in bringing about the complete reversal of the previous policy in Russia, where abortion for social and economic reasons is now illegal.  The opinion of A. M. Ludovici, admittedly an extreme exponent, may well be considered when, in \"The Case against Legalized Abortion\"[4] he writes:--      \"If only the disingenuous propaganda in favour of legalized     abortion would cease, and if only those who carried it on refrained     from dinning into the ears of an uninformed gallery of women the     alleged safety and harmlessness of abortion carried out under the     best hospital conditions, there would be less eagerness to face the     ordeal of criminal abortion.      \"So long as ignorant women are led to believe that abortion, when     skilfully performed, is as easy and harmless as having a corn     extracted, they will naturally infer that it can be done just as     harmlessly in secret as in public, especially if they are assured     that the surreptitious abortionist is skilled, as presumably they     always are, and are, moreover, kept in total darkness concerning     the kind of operation that is necessary for the interruption of     pregnancy.      \"If, however, they knew the truth, which is that artificial     abortion, even under the best hospital conditions, is a precarious     undertaking, so frequently leading to invalidism as never to be     'safe'; if, moreover, we spread the truth about Russia's legalized     abortions, and put a stop to the false reports circulated by     ill-informed enthusiasts regarding the ease and safety of skilled     induced abortion, we should be going a long way towards reducing     criminal or surreptitious abortion to vanishing-point.\"        [4] \"Abortion,\" by Stella Browne. Ludovici and Roberts.  _Sterilization._--Brief mention must be made of _sterilization_--an operation whereby further pregnancy is prevented--which has been put forward by certain witnesses as a method of preventing abortion.  Just as therapeutic abortion is, in certain cases, legitimately performed by medical practitioners, so has the operation of sterilization a recognized place in medical treatment of exceptional cases in which a woman's life is likely to be endangered or her health gravely impaired by further pregnancy.  It can, indeed, be reasonably argued that in such cases sterilization is very definitely to be preferred to the very unsatisfactory alternative of repeated therapeutic abortion.  Nevertheless, any general extension of this practice would, in the opinion of the Committee, be open to serious abuse.  The Committee sees a tendency in some quarters to extend the indications for this operation far beyond the bounds of generally accepted medical opinion.  The attitude of the Committee towards this matter is therefore the same as towards more specific legalization of therapeutic abortion.  _The Prosecution of the Criminal Abortionist._--A very disquieting aspect of this problem is the relative immunity of the criminal abortionist from punishment. Conviction for the crime is rare, even in cases where guilt appears to be proved beyond all reasonable doubt.  The Committee has sought to discover the reasons for the failure to obtain conviction.  It is apparent that the police authorities are faced with many difficulties. In the first instance conviction is largely dependent on the evidence of a woman who, in the eyes of the law, is an accomplice to the offence, and corroboration of her evidence may be demanded.  It has been suggested by certain witnesses that, if the woman were legally exempt from penalty, there would be less reticence about giving evidence and a greater fear on the part of the abortionist.  On the other hand, it has been stated to the Committee that where such an indemnity is actually given, this very fact operates against conviction.  The Commissioner of Police gave information that--      \"Juries are loth to convict in such cases and appear to be     impressed by the argument usually advanced by counsel for the     defence that, as it was at the solicitation of the woman that the     offence was convicted, she is the principal offender, and they     adopt the view that unless she also is charged it would be unfair     to convict the abortionist. The fact that if the woman was charged     she could not be called as a witness, and that, without her     evidence, there would be no case, does not appear to weigh with     them.\"  It would therefore appear that legalized exemption of the woman would not be a remedy.  The very serious statement has been made that--      \"In many cases professional abortionists have the assistance of one     particular doctor who attends their patients when medical skill     becomes necessary. The doctor either treats the patient     successfully or sends her to hospital on his own personal note, and     in neither case does the identity of the abortionist come to light.     There is reason to believe that in many such cases the assistance     of the doctor is given knowingly and in collaboration with the     abortionist contrary to the rule laid down in Sydney Smith's     'Forensic Medicine,' 3rd edition, page 362, that 'It is no part of     a doctor's duty to act as a detective, but it is equally certain     that it is no part of his duty to act as a screen for the     professional abortionist.'\"  The Committee would earnestly draw the attention of the responsible medical authorities to the suggestion that there are even a few members of the profession who are prepared to \"cover\" the abortionist when difficulties arise.  It is quite well realized that there are many occasions on which the general practitioner quite innocently comes in contact with these cases: that is an entirely different matter.  It is a further complaint of the police that they are hampered by the fact that rarely are they notified of a case of criminal abortion until the woman's condition is so critical that it is impossible to obtain a statement from her, and if she dies the evidence she might have given is lost. Without such evidence there is little chance of successfully prosecuting the abortionist.  To overcome this difficulty it has been advocated that, where a patient is admitted to hospital and is suspected to be suffering from the effects of criminal abortion, it should be the duty of the responsible medical officer of the hospital to notify the police forthwith and supply all the information in his possession.  This suggestion, however, involving as it does the confidential relationship between doctor and patient, is open to serious objections.  It is proposed to consider the position of the medical practitioner in relation to criminal abortion more fully in a subsequent section.  Finally, it is evident that the general public as represented by some members of juries do not regard this crime with the same seriousness as does the law.  A heavy responsibility rests on the public in allowing the present position to continue.  The Committee cannot but take a serious view of the repeatedly demonstrated difficulties in securing convictions, even in the face of apparently conclusive evidence, of persons charged with inducing abortion, and consider that the time has arrived when careful consideration should be given to the condition of the law relating to such crimes and to what steps are necessary to discourage effectively their practice. With that object in view the Committee respectfully and earnestly directs the attention of the Government to the position that has arisen, and the serious social, physical, and moral consequences which are likely to follow if effective steps are not taken to enforce the clear intention of the law.  _The Position of the Medical Practitioner in Relation to Criminal Abortion._--The duties and responsibilities of medical practitioners in connection with cases in which the performance of an illegal operation is suspected or known to have occurred are of great public importance.  Two main questions arise--(1) The duty of a doctor before the death of a patient or in a case where a fatal result is not expected, and (2) his duty in a case where the patient has died.  Concerning the first issue there are very conflicting opinions.  As already pointed out, it has been urged by the Police Department that in every case where a patient is admitted to a hospital and is suspected to be suffering from the effects of induced abortion or attempted abortion it should be the duty of the Medical Superintendent or Senior Medical Officer of the hospital to notify the police forthwith, and supply all information in his possession which would assist in establishing the identity of the offender and bringing him to justice.  The widely accepted view of the medical profession, supported by high legal authority, is that the bond of professional secrecy as between doctor and patient is so important that it would be entirely wrong for a doctor, without the patient's consent, to give information to the police before her death.  It has been insisted that, were it to be compulsory for the doctor to notify the police on the strength of information obtained in his professional capacity, patients would refrain from obtaining the necessary medical help under these circumstances, thus accentuating the problem of deaths from abortion rather than limiting it.  It has been stated that already in one centre a disinclination to enter hospital has been expressed by patients because they feared that the police"]]]
