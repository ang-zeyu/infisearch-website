As to the good man, Malicorne--we speak of the syndic of Orleans--he did not see more clearly into the present than others did into the future; and had no suspicion as he walked, every day, between three and five o’clock, after his dinner, upon the Place Sainte-Catherine, in his gray coat, cut after the fashion of Louis XIII. and his cloth shoes with great knots of ribbon, that it was he who was paying for all those bursts of laughter, all those stolen kisses, all those whisperings, all those little keepsakes, and all those bubble projects which formed a chain of forty-five leagues in length, from the palais of Blois to the Palais Royal.    Chapter V: Manicamp and Malicorne.  Malicorne, then, left Blois, as we have said, and went to find his friend, Manicamp, then in temporary retreat in the city of Orleans. It was just at the moment when that young nobleman was employed in selling the last decent clothing he had left. He had, a fortnight before, extorted from the Comte de Guiche a hundred pistoles, all he had, to assist in equipping him properly to go and meet Madame, on her arrival at Le Havre. He had drawn from Malicorne, three days before, fifty pistoles, the price of the _brevet_ obtained for Montalais. He had then no expectation of anything else, having exhausted all his resources, with the exception of selling a handsome suit of cloth and satin, embroidered and laced with gold, which had been the admiration of the court. But to be able to sell this suit, the last he had left,--as we have been forced to confess to the reader--Manicamp had been obliged to take to his bed. No more fire, no more pocket-money, no more walking-money, nothing but sleep to take the place of repasts, companies and balls. It has been said--“He who sleeps, dines;” but it has never been affirmed--He who sleeps, plays--or, He who sleeps, dances. Manicamp, reduced to this extremity of neither playing nor dancing, for a week at least, was, consequently, very sad; he was expecting a usurer, and saw Malicorne enter. A cry of distress escaped him.  “Eh! what!” said he, in a tone which nothing can describe, “is that you again, dear friend?”  “Humph! you are very polite!” said Malicorne.  “Ay, but look you, I was expecting money, and, instead of money, I see _you_.”  “And suppose I brought you some money?”  “Oh! that would be quite another thing. You are very welcome, my dear friend!”  And he held out his hand, not for the hand of Malicorne, but for the purse. Malicorne pretended to be mistaken, and gave him his hand.  “And the money?” said Manicamp.  “My dear friend, if you wish to have it, earn it.”  “What must be done for it?”  “Earn it, _parbleu!_”  “And after what fashion?”  “Oh! that is rather trying, I warn you.”  “The devil!”  “You must get out of bed, and go immediately to M. le Comte de Guiche.”  “I get up!” said Manicamp, stretching himself in his bed, complacently, “oh, no, thank you!”  “You have sold all your clothes?”  “No, I have one suit left, the handsomest even, but I expect a purchaser.”  “And the _chausses?_”  “Well, if you look, you will see them on that chair.”  “Very well! since you have some _chausses_ and a _pourpoint_ left, put your legs into the first and your back into the other; have a horse saddled, and set off.”  “Not I.”  “And why not?”  “_Morbleu!_ don’t you know, then, that M. de Guiche is at Etampes?”  “No, I thought he was at Paris. You will then only have fifteen leagues to go, instead of thirty.”  “You are a wonderfully clever fellow! If I were to ride fifteen leagues in these clothes, they would never be fit to put on again; and, instead of selling them for thirty pistoles, I should be obliged to take fifteen.”  “Sell them for whatever you like, but I must have a second commission of maid of honor.”  “Good! for whom? Is Montalais doubled, then?”  “Vile fellow!--It is you who are doubled. You swallow up two fortunes--mine, and that of M. le Comte de Guiche.”  “You should say, that of M. le Comte de Guiche and yours.”  “That is true; honor where it is due; but I return to my _brevet_.”  “And you are wrong.”  “Prove me that.”  “My friend, there will only be twelve maids of honor for madame; I have already obtained for you what twelve hundred women are trying for, and for that I was forced to employ all my diplomacy.”  “Oh! yes, I know you have been quite heroic, my dear friend.”  “We know what we are about,” said Manicamp.  “To whom do you tell that? When I am king, I promise you one thing.”  “What? To call yourself Malicorne the First?”  “No; to make you superintendent of my finances; but that is not the question now.”  “Unfortunately.”  “The present affair is to procure for me a second place of maid of honor.”  “My friend, if you were to promise me the price of heaven, I would decline to disturb myself at this moment.”  Malicorne chinked the money in his pocket.  “There are twenty pistoles here,” said Malicorne.  “And what would you do with twenty pistoles, _mon Dieu!_”  “Well!” said Malicorne, a little angry, “suppose I were to add them to the five hundred you already owe me?”  “You are right,” replied Manicamp, stretching out his hand again, “and from that point of view I can accept them. Give them to me.”  “An instant, what the devil! it is not only holding out your hand that will do; if I give you the twenty pistoles, shall I have my _brevet?_”  “To be sure you shall.”  “Soon?”  “To-day.”  “Oh! take care! Monsieur de Manicamp; you undertake much, and I do not ask that. Thirty leagues in a day is too much, you would kill yourself.”  “I think nothing impossible when obliging a friend.”  “You are quite heroic.”  “Where are the twenty pistoles?”  “Here they are,” said Malicorne, showing them.  “That’s well.”  “Yes, but my dear M. Manicamp, you would consume them in post-horses alone!”  “No, no, make yourself easy on that score.”  “Pardon me. Why, it is fifteen leagues from this place to Etampes?”  “Fourteen.”  “Well! fourteen be it; fourteen leagues makes seven posts; at twenty _sous_ the post, seven _livres_; seven _livres_ the courier, fourteen; as many for coming back, twenty-eight! as much for bed and supper, that makes sixty _livres_ this complaisance would cost.”  Manicamp stretched himself like a serpent in his bed, and fixing his two great eyes upon Malicorne, “You are right,” said he; “I could not return before to-morrow;” and he took the twenty pistoles.  “Now, then, be off!”  “Well, as I cannot be back before to-morrow, we have time.”  “Time for what?”  “Time to play.”  “What do you wish to play with?”  “Your twenty pistoles, _pardieu!_”  “No; you always win.”  “I will wager them, then.”  “Against what?”  “Against twenty others.”  “And what shall be the object of the wager?”  “This. We have said it was fourteen leagues to Etampes.”  “Yes.”  “And fourteen leagues back?”  “Doubtless.”  “Well; for these twenty-eight leagues you cannot allow less than fourteen hours?”  “That is agreed.”  “One hour to find the Comte de Guiche.”  “Go on.”  “And an hour to persuade him to write a letter to Monsieur.”  “Just so.”  “Sixteen hours in all?”  “You reckon as well as M. Colbert.”  “It is now twelve o’clock.”  “Half-past.”  “_Hein!_--you have a handsome watch!”  “What were you saying?” said Malicorne, putting his watch quickly back into his fob.  “Ah! true; I was offering to lay you twenty pistoles against these you have lent me, that you will have the Comte de Guiche’s letter in--”  “How soon?”  “In eight hours.”  “Have you a winged horse, then?”  “That is no matter. Will you bet?”  “I shall have the comte’s letter in eight hours?”  “Yes.”  “In hand?”  “In hand.”  “Well, be it so; I lay,” said Malicorne, curious enough to know how this seller of clothes would get through.  “Is it agreed?”  “It is.”  “Pass me the pen, ink, and paper.”  “Here they are.”  “Thank you.”  Manicamp raised himself with a sigh, and leaning on his left elbow, in his best hand, traced the following lines:--  “Good for an order for a place of maid of honor to Madame, which M. le Comte de Guiche will take upon him to obtain at sight. DE MANICAMP.”  This painful task accomplished, he laid himself down in bed again.  “Well!” asked Malicorne, “what does this mean?”  “That means that if you are in a hurry to have the letter from the Comte de Guiche for Monsieur, I have won my wager.”  “How the devil is that?”  “That is transparent enough, I think; you take that paper.”  “Well?”  “And you set out instead of me.”  “Ah!”  “You put your horses to their best speed.”  “Good!”  “In six hours you will be at Etampes; in seven hours you have the letter from the comte, and I shall have won my wager without stirring from my bed, which suits me and you too, at the same time, I am very sure.”  “Decidedly, Manicamp, you are a great man.”  “_Hein!_ I know that.”  “I am to start then for Etampes?”  “Directly.”  “I am to go to the Comte de Guiche with this order?”  “He will give you a similar one for Monsieur.”  “Monsieur will approve?”  “Instantly.”  “And I shall have my _brevet?_”  “You will.”  “Ah!”  “Well, I hope I behave genteely?”  “Adorably.”  “Thank you.”  “You do as you please, then, with the Comte de Guiche, Manicamp?”  “Except making money of him--everything?”  “_Diable!_ the exception is annoying; but then, if instead of asking him for money, you were to ask--”  “What?”  “Something important.”  “What do you call important?”  “Well! suppose one of your friends asked you to render him a service?”  “I would not render it to him.”  “Selfish fellow!”  “Or at least I would ask him what service he would render me in exchange.”  “Ah! that, perhaps, is fair. Well, that friend speaks to you.”  “What, you, Malicorne?”  “Yes; I.”  “Ah! ah! you are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681"],["title","Ten Years Later (#7)"],["body","h, then?”  “I have still fifty pistoles left.”  “Exactly the sum I want. Where are those fifty pistoles?”  “Here,” said Malicorne, slapping his pocket.  “Then speak, my friend; what do you want?”  Malicorne took up the pen, ink, and paper again, and presented them all to Manicamp. “Write!” said he.  “Dictate!”  “An order for a place in the household of Monsieur.”  “Oh!” said Manicamp, laying down the pen, “a place in the household of Monsieur for fifty pistoles?”  “You mistook me, my friend; you did not hear plainly.”  “What did you say, then?”  “I said five hundred.”  “And the five hundred?”  “Here they are.”  Manicamp devoured the rouleau with his eyes; but this time Malicorne held it at a distance.  “Eh! what do you say to that? Five hundred pistoles.”  “I say it is for nothing, my friend,” said Manicamp, taking up the pen again, “and you exhaust my credit. Dictate.”  Malicorne continued:  “Which my friend the Comte de Guiche will obtain for my friend Malicorne.”  “That’s it,” said Manicamp.  “Pardon me, you have forgotten to sign.”  “Ah! that is true. The five hundred pistoles?”  “Here are two hundred and fifty of them.”  “And the other two hundred and fifty?”  “When I am in possession of my place.”  Manicamp made a face.  “In that case give me the recommendation back again.”  “What to do?”  “To add two words to it.”  “Two words?”  “Yes; two words only.”  “What are they?”  “In haste.”  Malicorne returned the recommendation; Manicamp added the words.  “Good,” said Malicorne, taking back the paper.  Manicamp began to count out the pistoles.  “There want twenty,” said he.  “How so?”  “The twenty I have won.”  “In what way?”  “By laying that you would have the letter from the Comte de Guiche in eight hours.”  “Ah! that’s fair,” and he gave him the twenty pistoles.  Manicamp began to scoop up his gold by handfuls, and pour it in cascades upon his bed.  “This second place,” murmured Malicorne, whilst drying his paper, “which, at first glance appears to cost me more than the first, but--”  He stopped, took up the pen in his turn, and wrote to Montalais:--  “MADEMOISELLE,--Announce to your friend that her commission will not be long before it arrives; I am setting out to get it signed: that will be twenty-eight leagues I shall have gone for the love of you.”  Then with his sardonic smile, taking up the interrupted sentence:--“This place,” said he, “at first glance, appears to have cost more than the first; but--the benefit will be, I hope, in proportion with the expense, and Mademoiselle de la Valliere will bring me back more than Mademoiselle de Montalais, or else,--or else my name is not Malicorne. Farewell, Manicamp,” and he left the room.    Chapter VI. The Courtyard of the Hotel Grammont.  On Malicorne’s arrival at Orleans, he was informed that the Comte de Guiche had just set out for Paris. Malicorne rested himself for a couple of hours, and then prepared to continue his journey. He reached Paris during the night, and alighted at a small hotel, where, in his previous journeys to the capital, he had been accustomed to put up, and at eight o’clock the next morning presented himself at the Hotel Grammont. Malicorne arrived just in time, for the Comte de Guiche was on the point of taking leave of Monsieur before setting out for Le Havre, where the principal members of the French nobility had gone to await Madame’s arrival from England. Malicorne pronounced the name of Manicamp, and was immediately admitted. He found the Comte de Guiche in the courtyard of the Hotel Grammont, inspecting his horses, which his trainers and equerries were passing in review before him. The count, in the presence of his tradespeople and of his servants, was engaged in praising or blaming, as the case seemed to deserve, the appointments, horses, and harness that were being submitted to him; when, in the midst of this important occupation, the name of Manicamp was announced.  “Manicamp!” he exclaimed; “let him enter by all means.” And he advanced a few steps toward the door.  Malicorne slipped through the half-open door, and looking at the Comte de Guiche, who was surprised to see a face he did not recognize, instead of the one he expected, said: “Forgive me, monsieur le comte, but I believe a mistake has been made. M. Manicamp himself was announced to you, instead of which it is only an envoy from him.”  “Ah!” exclaimed De Guiche, coldly; “and what do you bring me?”  “A letter, monsieur le comte.” Malicorne handed him the first document, and narrowly watched the count’s face, who, as he read it, began to laugh.  “What!” he exclaimed, “another maid of honor? Are all the maids of honor in France, then, under his protection?”  Malicorne bowed.  “Why does he not come himself?” he inquired.  “He is confined to his bed.”  “The deuce! he has no money then, I suppose,” said De Guiche, shrugging his shoulders. “What does he do with his money?”  Malicorne made a movement, to indicate that upon this subject he was as ignorant as the count himself. “Why does he not make use of his credit, then?” continued De Guiche.  “With regard to that, I think--”  “What?”  “That Manicamp has credit with no one but yourself, monsieur le comte!”  “He will not be at Le Havre, then?” Whereupon Malicorne made another movement.  “But every one will be there.”  “I trust, monsieur le comte, that he will not neglect so excellent an opportunity.”  “He should be at Paris by this time.”  “He will take the direct road perhaps to make up for lost time.”  “Where is he now?”  “At Orleans.”  “Monsieur,” said De Guiche, “you seem to me a man of very good taste.”  Malicorne was wearing some of Manicamp’s old-new clothes. He bowed in return, saying, “You do me a very great honor, monsieur le comte.”  “Whom have I the pleasure of addressing?”  “My name is Malicorne, monsieur.”  “M. de Malicorne, what do you think of these pistol-holsters?”  Malicorne was a man of great readiness and immediately understood the position of affairs. Besides, the “de” which had been prefixed to his name, raised him to the rank of the person with whom he was conversing. He looked at the holsters with the air of a connoisseur and said, without hesitation: “Somewhat heavy, monsieur.”  “You see,” said De Guiche to the saddler, “this gentleman, who understands these matters well, thinks the holsters heavy, a complaint I had already made.” The saddler was full of excuses.  “What do you think,” asked De Guiche, “of this horse, which I have just purchased?”  “To look at it, it seems perfect, monsieur le comte; but I must mount it before I give you my opinion.”  “Do so, M. de Malicorne, and ride him round the court two or three times.”  The courtyard of the hotel was so arranged, that whenever there was any occasion for it, it could be used as a riding-school. Malicorne, with perfect ease, arranged the bridle and snaffle-reins, placed his left hand on the horse’s mane, and, with his foot in the stirrup, raised himself and seated himself in the saddle. At first, he made the horse walk the whole circuit of the court-yard at a foot-pace; next at a trot; lastly at a gallop. He then drew up close to the count, dismounted, and threw the bridle to a groom standing by. “Well,” said the count, “what do you think of it, M. de Malicorne?”  “This horse, monsieur le comte, is of the Mecklenburg breed. In looking whether the bit suited his mouth, I saw that he was rising seven, the very age when the training of a horse intended for a charger should commence. The forehand is light. A horse which holds its head high, it is said, never tires his rider’s hand. The withers are rather low. The drooping of the hind-quarters would almost make me doubt the purity of its German breed, and I think there is English blood in him. He stands well on his legs, but he trots high, and may cut himself, which requires attention to be paid to his shoeing. He is tractable; and as I made him turn round and change his feet, I found him quick and ready in doing so.”  “Well said, M. de Malicorne,” exclaimed the comte; “you are a judge of horses, I perceive;” then, turning towards him again, he continued, “you are most becomingly dressed, M. de Malicorne. That is not a provincial cut, I presume. Such a style of dress is not to be met with at Tours or Orleans.”  “No, monsieur le comte; my clothes were made at Paris.”  “There is no doubt about that. But let us resume our own affair. Manicamp wishes for the appointment of a second maid of honor.”  “You perceive what he has written, monsieur le comte.”  “For whom was the first appointment?”  Malicorne felt the color rise in his face as he answered hurriedly.  “A charming maid of honor, Mademoiselle de Montalais.”  “Ah, ah! you are acquainted with her?”  “We are affianced, or nearly so.”  “That is quite another thing, then; a thousand compliments,” exclaimed De Guiche, upon whose lips a courtier’s jest was already fitting, but to whom the word “affianced,” addressed by Malicorne with respect to Mademoiselle de Montalais, recalled the respect due to women.  “And for whom is the second appointment destined?” asked De Guiche; “is it for anyone to whom Manicamp may happen to be affianced? In that case I pity her, poor girl! for she will have a sad fellow for a husband.”  “No, monsieur le comte; the second appointment is for Mademoiselle de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere.”  “Unknown,” said De Guiche.  “Unknown? yes, monsieur,” said Malicorne, smiling in his turn.  “Very good. I will speak to Monsieur about it. By the by, she is of gentle birth?”  “She belongs to a very good family and is maid of honor to Madame.”  “That’s well. Will you accompany me to Monsieur?”  “Most certainly, if I may be permitted the honor.”  “Have you your carriage?”  “No; I came here on horseback.”  “Dressed as you are?”  “No, monsieur; I posted from Orleans, and I changed my traveling suit for the one I have on, in order to present myself to you.”  “True, you already told me you had come from Orleans;” saying which he crumpled"]]]
