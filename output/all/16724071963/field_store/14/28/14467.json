What is now known as the Procter Tomb on the north side of Lowell Street at the southeastern corner of the Downing Farm is of modern origin. We cannot believe that John Procter's family would have deposited his body in ground to which they then had no title except as tenants. At the time of the imprisonment of John Procter and his wife Elizabeth the family was no doubt broken up and the house stripped of everything that could be taken away to pay the fees of arrest and imprisonment. The great farm was no longer their home and they were not again in a position to return to and occupy it as their own until nearly a decade had passed, when, through the efforts of Thorndike, one of the sons of John Procter, the Downing Farm in its entirety was purchased from Charles, the grandson of Emanuel Downing and son of Sir George Downing, then deceased.  At the time of his death in 1692 John Procter owned, except what land in Ipswich he may have inherited from his father, only the fifteen acres with a house upon it, which, as I have said, was just west of the Downing Farm on the north side of Lowell Street. This fact alone would render it entirely probable that when the body was removed, in 1692, it would be carried to this place. In fact, in view of the peculiar circumstances of the necessity of secrecy and the otherwise homeless condition of the family, no other place would have been chosen.  And now that direct tradition of the descendants, independently of any knowledge that John Procter owned this land, confirms this view by so remarkably agreeing with long forgotten records as to the locality, it may be said confidently that we know with reasonable certainty the spot where these revered and honored relics were laid so long ago. The \"bars as you go into the Philip H. Saunders place\" are still there, and the way through is still used and marks the place where in 1708 John Higginson 3d and Hannah wife, in conveying to Daniel and Lawrence Southwick the nine acre lot next east of Procter's lot, reserved the liberty of a \"highway of one pole wide at the western end of said land to be for ye use of Anthony Needham Sen,\" \"they to maintain a pair of sufficient bars next ye common highway so long as they use the same.\"  Anthony Needham, Sen., at that time owned what has recently been known as the Philip H. Saunders place, and this right of way was for the benefit of that place. Mr. Dennis now lives at the westerly end of the nine acre lot conveyed by Higginson, as above mentioned, which was long known as the \"Flint Pasture.\" The bars and the way are now on the west side of the wall dividing the Dennis land from the Procter lot instead of being on the east side; indicating that the dividing line was at some time changed. This change may have been made without any evidence of it appearing on record, by Zachariah King, who owned both lots from 1811 till 1818; and this would account for the apparent change in size of the two lots as described in the deeds, the westerly (or Procter) lot increasing while the easterly lot decreased.  On the north side of Lowell Street, about half way between these bars and the John G. Walcott, Jun., house, is a well on the edge of the road against a steep rocky hill rising back of it. This, I understand, has sometimes been called the \"Procter well.\" There seems to be no room for a house close by it on that side of the road, but it is possible that the road may anciently have turned more to the south at this point, though I have not found any evidence in the records to that effect.  The history of the John Procter house and fifteen acres of land, as derived from the records, may be briefly stated as follows:--  Before we can understand the meaning of the deeds of the Procter lot we must know something of the history of the Downing Farm and particularly of the nine acre lot known formerly as the Flint Pasture, which is the large area of cleared land on the north side of Lowell Street, on the west end of which is at present the house of Mr. Dennis. That this may be better understood at a glance I have marked on my sketch, by a broken line, the bounds of the Downing Farm, which included the \"Flint Pasture.\"  It seems that about two hundred and seventy years ago Roger Morey, a companion and it is thought a relative or connection of Roger Williams, had a grant of forty or fifty acres, which was located to the west or southwest of a large tract granted to Robert Cole and sold to Emanuel Downing before 1638. The Roger Morey grant was on both sides of what is now Lowell Street, that part on the northerly side being the same nine or ten acres above mentioned as afterwards known by the name of the Flint Pasture.  In a deposition by Nathaniel Felton Sept. 18, 1700, he being then 85 years of age, he says: \"Soon after Roger Morrey removed from Salem, which was before 1644, I, this deponent, heard that said Morrey had sold his land in the woods to Emanuel Downing and I do further testify [as to?] a parcel of swamp or upland & meadow being a part and belonging to ye said Morrey, and [it] lyeth at the westerly end of Mr. Downing's farm\"--deponent \"has lived about 55 years a near neighbor to said farm and never heard that said Morrey's land was claimed by anybody but the tenants living on Mr. Downing's farm.\" [Reg'y of Deeds, Salem, B. 15, Fol. 5.] Fortunately for the identification of this land, a most remarkable bound often referred to in the ancient deeds is still to be seen marking the exact northeasterly corner of the Morey grant. It is a high and precipitous rock about twenty rods northerly from Lowell street just opposite the house on the south side which was formerly the house of Nathaniel Flint, and a few rods westerly from the easterly way leading southerly to the Wyman Farm. It forms the northeasterly corner bound of the \"Flint Pasture,\" and is marked on my sketch \"Morey's Bound,\" that being the name given to it in the numerous ancient deeds and depositions.  The return of the settlement of the northwesterly bounds of the Downing Farm in 1681, recorded in Salem town records, gives the line from the extreme northwestern corner by Putnam's land as running \"strait on to a white oak called Morey's Bound.\"  In a controversy which seems to have existed in 1685 and in 1690 between Anthony Needham and the owners of land adjoining his, presumably the owners of the Downing Farm, Nathaniel Felton testifies that \"about 30 years since\" (that is about 1660) \"Mr. Thomas Gardner and Jeffry Massey (who by virtue of a grant of 200 acres due unto Mr. Bacon[A]) when they went to lay out the said 200 acres I this deponent went with them, where cominge upon the land neere adjoyning to the farm called Mr. Downings farme, the first bound they made of the said two hundred acres was upon a hill being as I conceive about 20 rods on the north side of the highway[B] leading up to Joseph Pope's farme, and was a white oak sufficiently marked, ye which white oak the surveyors affirmed was the northeast corner bounds of [Moreys][C] farm, from thence they went upon a straight line westward to another white oak which was marked also upon four sides, and stood neer about 20 rods to the northward of ye said highway which the said surveyors affirmed to be the northwest corner bounds of the said [Morey's] farme, and it also was the northeast corner bounds of John Marsh his farme, which did joyne to ye [Morey] farme; and I doe further testifie that John Marsh shewed me the said white oake and affirmed it to be the northeast corner bound of his land and the northwest corner bound of [Morey's] land.\"  [Footnote A: There are depositions recorded in Essex Reg'y, B. 11, Fol. 186-9, by which it appears that Rebecca, wife of William Bacon, was a daughter of Thomas Potter, Esq., and that her brother, Humphrey Potter, was the father of Ann Potter, afterwards the wife of Anthony Needham.]  [Footnote B: Now Lowell Street.]  [Footnote C: In the record it is Massey, evidently a mistake, as shown by Marsh's deposition, next given.]  In 1685 Zachariah Marsh testifies that \"about 25 years since my father John Marsh, desirous I should know the bounds of his farme took me along with him, and he then shewed me all the four corner bounds belonging to his farme, and this I doe testifie that he shewed me a white oake sufficiently marked standing about 20 rods northward of the highway leading up to Joseph Pope's by a little swamp the which oake my father affirmed was the northeast corner bounds of his farme, and that it was also the northwest corner bounds of Roger More's farme; and further I doe testifie that when we run the line Anthony Needham being present owned the said white oake to be the corner bounds of my father's farme, and this is the bounds in controversy and ye same that Nath. Felton attested unto, and hath ever been reputed so to be, no man that ever I know having questioned it, till of late Anthony Needham.\" This deposition was again sworn to in 1690. See Reg'y of Deeds at Salem, Book 8, F. 181.  This controversy was probably between Anthony Needham and John Procter as tenant of the Downing Farm, as appears by an action at the Salem Court, Nov., 1685, for damage done to John Procter in claiming \"land belonging to the plaintiff as being in possession of, and hiring the said land of the Worshipful Symon Bradstreet Esq.,\" said land being part of a farm \"formerly belonging to Mr. Emanuel Downing\"--Bradstreet married the daughter of Downing.  The bounds described in these depositions are those of the \"Flint pasture\" and have remained substantially unchanged to the present day, as is evident to the eye, for, in passing along Lowell Street one can see plainly the old and venerable"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27386"],["title","House of John Procter, Witchcraft Martyr, 1692 (#2)"],["body","stone wall beginning at \"Morey's Bound\" on the top of the high rock and running along in a westerly direction at about twenty rods distance northerly from the street. In the deed of the Downing Farm to Thorndike Procter 13 Sept., 1700, the two bounds testified to by Felton and by Marsh are mentioned as follows:--the line of the Downing Farm running from the northwest corner bound \"southwestward unto a white oak tree standing on the Rocks, and from thence northwestward unto a swamp white oak stump standing about 20 poles on the northerly side of the way leading to Anthony Needhams\" etc. In the deed by Thorndike Procter to his brother Benjamin, in 1701, of that portion of the Downing Farm now owned by Daniel Brown, the Morey bound is described as \"a dead white oak Bound Tree standing on the Rocks.\"  The portion of the Downing Farm marked on my sketch as the Flint Pasture, being about nine or ten acres, was conveyed with other portions by Thorndike Procter to Samuel Marble, in 1701, the two bounds above mentioned being described in the same words. Samuel Marble the next year conveyed the same to Samuel Gardner. Hannah, the wife of John Higginson 3d, mentioned above as conveying this lot to the Southwicks in 1708, was a daughter of Samuel Gardner. Daniel Southwick, Jr., conveyed the same to Jonathan Flint in 1729 and he conveyed it to John Jacobs in 1738. John Jacobs left it by will to his son Daniel, who conveyed it to Zachariah King in 1775. By him it was divided between his daughters Desire Procter and Mary Upton, in 1818, and its history is thus brought within the knowledge of those now living.  West of this Flint Pasture was the Procter fifteen acre lot, the description of which in the deeds and depositions we can now understand. How John Procter became owner of this fifteen acre lot does not appear upon record, but as John Marsh appears, by the depositions of Nathaniel Felton and Zachariah Marsh given above, to have been the owner there originally, we may conjecture that the title came from him by some unrecorded deed or otherwise.  The following deed, dated 5 Nov., 1681, and recorded Book 6, Fol. 48, may throw some light on this question, as it apparently conveys the eight acre lot which, as above mentioned, was conveyed by Anthony Needham to his son-in-law Thomas Gould, in 1705, where John G. Walcott, Jun., now lives.  Joseph Procter of Ipswich conveys to Anthony Needham of Salem \"a certain tract of land being the third part of twenty three acres of land (formerly the land of John Herod) lying and being in ye towne of Salem aforesaid, the said twenty three acres of land being bounded on ye northerly side with ye land of ye said Needham, on ye south with ye highway, on ye west with ye land of ye said Anthony Needham, and on ye east with ye land now in ye occupation of John Procter.\"  Supposing this third part of the twenty-three acres to have been the eight acre lot referred to above, being the only locality that would agree with the description, the land in the \"occupation of John Procter\" on the east side of the whole \"twenty three acres\" would be the \"Flint Pasture,\" part of the Downing Farm, which was then, in 1681, in the occupation of John Procter, as tenant. It is therefore quite probable that the \"fifteen acre\" lot which John Procter owned was the other two thirds part of the \"twenty three acres,\" and that he became possessed of it in the same way that his brother, Joseph Procter, became possessed of the third part, perhaps in the division of an estate. What the estate was may be ascertained by future investigation.  The first we know positively of the lot in question as being John Procter's is through the record of an action which he brought at the County Court, in 1685, against Steven Fish for nine pounds ten shillings due for rent. Procter was nonsuited. Fish at the same time sued Procter for non delivery of land hired of him by lease March 1st, 1681, (1681-2). The jury found for a delivery of the land according to the lease.  In 1689 John Procter \"for my love and parental affection unto my beloved wife Elizabeth Procter and all her children\" conveys to certain trustees for their benefit \"all my estate for their supply and maintenance and make over and give to them my house and land lying in Salem bounds containing fifteen acres, more or less, bounded with ye land of Anthony Needham northwest and east southerly[D] and south and west with ye common road or highway in part and partly alsoe with land of John Marsh and some land of Thomas Gardner Sen. that comes within the highway.\" The last words in this description are puzzling and perhaps indicate that the road at the westerly end of the lot ran further to the south than it does to-day.  [Footnote D: This probably refers to the way which Needham had to his land over the western end of the lot lying next east of the Procter lot.]  The next information is obtained from a deposition by Anthony Needham, Thomas Gould and Isaac Needham, in 1730, taken \"in perpetuam rei memoriam\" and recorded in the Registry, Book 54, Leaf 246, as follows:--They testify that \"they very well knew that Mr. John Procter late of Salem, deceased, possessed in his own right for several years before and untill ninety two[E] a certain tract of land situate in Salem aforesaid containing about 15 acres, butting easterly on land now in ye possession of Jonathan Flint, southerly and southwesterly on the highway leading to Joseph Popes,[F] northwesterly and northerly on land of the deponent Thomas Gould and northeasterly on land of Thomas Needham. That the said John Procter had a house upon the abovesaid land which he leased to one Stephen Fish[G] since let to one Lincoln and to one Bates, who improved it under and in right of the said John Procter. That Benjamin Procter son of the said John Procter possessed and improved ye above described parcel of land from the year 1692 untill his decease which happened about fourteen years since. That Mary the widow of said Benjamin Procter and her son John Procter have possessed and improved the same right from the time of his decease untill this day.\" The deposition is dated Jan. 7, 1730. The name of \"Bates pasture\" applied to the Philip H. Saunders place in the deed from Marsh, in 1863, suggests the thought that it may have been derived from the Bates mentioned in the deposition as one of the tenants of the John Procter house.  [Footnote E: 1692.]  [Footnote F: Now Lowell Street.]  [Footnote G: See above, the suit against Fish for rent.]  It only remains to trace the title of the John Procter lot to the present time. It appears from various deeds and other records that the title descended from John Procter to his son Benjamin, and then to his son John, the grandson of the first named John Procter. From him it passed to his son Benjamin, and then to this Benjamin's sons, James and Francis Procter. Francis gave a deed of it to James April 19, 1802. Desire Procter, widow and administratrix of James Procter, conveyed it to Zachariah King Aug. 9, 1811, describing it as \"a certain piece of land called the upper pasture situate in said Danvers containing sixteen acres, be the same more or less, and is bounded as follows, viz.--southerly on the highway, northwesterly and northerly on land of John Gardner, Jr., northeasterly on land of Ezekiel Marsh, and southeasterly on land of the said Zachariah King to the bound first mentioned.\" Zachariah King conveyed the same to his daughter, Desire Procter of Danvers, widow, Feb. 18, 1818.  From Desire Procter the title descended to Rebecca P. Osborne, her granddaughter, and others who, in 1889, conveyed the lot to Harriet A. Walcott, wife of John G. Walcott, the description being as follows:--\"a parcel of land in that part of Peabody called West Peabody, containing about seventeen acres and two fourths and formerly called the Upper Pasture, bounded southwesterly by Lowell Street about ninety two rods and eleven links, northwesterly by land of Walcott, formerly of John Gardner, about thirty eight rods, northeasterly by land of Walcott, formerly of Gardner, and by land of Philip Marsh, formerly of Ezekiel Marsh, about seventy six rods and nineteen links, southeasterly by other land of the grantors, formerly of Zachariah King, about seventeen rods and fourteen links.\"  John G. Walcott and Harriet A. Walcott, wife, conveyed the same to Mary E. Collins, wife of William F. M. Collins, by deed dated June 27, 1898.     INDEX.
