Possibly they will run themselves while the driver sits back     with an old-fashioned in his hands. Perhaps they will carry folks     down the highways at ninety miles an hour in perfect safety. But     picking up a hitch-hiker will still be as dangerous as it is today._   HARD  GUY   By H. B. CARLETON   He was standing at the side of the glassite super-highway, his arm half-raised, thumb pointed in the same direction as that of the approaching rocket car. Ordinarily Frederick Marden would have passed a hitch-hiker without stopping, but there was something in the bearing and appearance of this one that caused him to apply his brakes.  Marden opened the door next to the vacant seat beside him.  \"Going my way?\" he asked.  A pair of steady, unsmiling blue eyes looked him over. \"Yeah.\"  \"All right, then. Hop in.\"  The hitch-hiker took his time. He slid into the seat with casual deliberateness and slammed the car door shut. The rocket car got under way once more.  They rode in silence for half a mile or so. Finally Marden glanced questioningly at his companion's expressionless profile.  \"Where are you headed for?\" he asked.  \"Dentonville.\" He spoke from the corner of his mouth, without turning his head.  \"Oh, yes. That's the next town, isn't it?\"  \"Yeah.\"  Not very communicative, reflected Marden, noticing the rather ragged condition of the other's celo-lex clothing.  \"Have much trouble getting rides?\"  The passenger turned his head, his blue eyes without emotion.  \"Yeah. Most guys are leery about pickin' up hitch-hikers. Scared they'll get robbed.\"  Marden pursed his lips, nodded.  \"Something to that, all right. I'm usually pretty careful myself; but I figured you looked okay.\"  \"Can't always tell by looks,\" was the calm reply. \"'Course us guys mostly pick out some guy with a swell atomic-mobile if we're goin' to pull a stick-up. When we see a old heap like this one there's usually not enough dough to make it pay.\"  Marden felt his jaw drop.  \"Say, you sound, like you go in for that sort of thing! I'm telling you right now, I haven't enough cash on me to make it worth your while. I'm just a salesman, trying to get along.\"  \"You got nothin' to worry about,\" his passenger assured him. \"Stick-ups ain't my racket.\"  An audible sigh of relief escaped Marden.  \"I'm certainly glad to hear that! What is your--er--racket, anyway?\"  The blue eyes frosted over.  \"Look, chum, sometimes it ain't exactly healthy to ask questions like that.\"  \"Pardon me,\" Marden said hastily. \"I didn't mean anything. It's none of my business, of course.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The calm eyes flicked over his contrite expression.  \"Skip it, pal. You look like a right guy. I'll put you next to somethin'. Only keep your lip buttoned, see?\"  \"Oh, absolutely.\"  \"I'm Mike Eagen--head of the Strato Rovers.\"  \"No!\" Marden was plainly awed. \"The Strato Rovers, eh? I've heard of them, all right.\"  The other nodded complacently.  \"Yeah. We're about the toughest mob this side of Mars. We don't bother honest people, though. We get ours from the crooks and racketeers. They can't squeal to the Interplanetary Police.\"  \"There's a lot in what you say,\" agreed Marden. \"And of course that puts your ... mob in the Robin Hood class.\"  \"Robin Hood--nuts! That guy was a dope! Runnin' around with bows and arrows. Why, we got a mystery ray that paralyzes anybody that starts up with us. They're all right when it wears off, but by that time we get away.\"  Marden was properly impressed.  \"A mystery ray! With a weapon like that, you should be able to walk into a bank and clean it out without any trouble.\"  His passenger's lips curled.  \"I told you, we don't bother honest people. We even help the S.P. sometimes. Right now we're workin' with the Earth-Mars G-men in roundin' up a gang of fifth-columnists that are plannin' on takin' over the gov'ment. They're led by the Black Hornet. This Black Hornet goes around pretendin' like he's a big business man, but he's really a internatural spy.\"  \"A--what?\"  \"A internatural spy,\" repeated Marden's companion, shortly. \"The E-M G-men say he's the most dangerous man in the country. But he won't last long with the Strato Rovers on his trail.\"  Marden nodded.  \"I can believe that. Tell me, Eagen, what are you doing out here around a small Earth town like Dentonville?\"  \"The gov'ment's buildin' some kind of a ammunition place near here, and I understand the Black Hornet's figurin' on wreckin' everything. 'Course he won't get away with it.\"  Scattered plasticade houses on either side of the road indicated they had reached the outskirts of Dentonville. Mike Eagen pointed ahead to a small white house set back among a cluster of trees.  \"There's where I'm holed up. Drop me off in front.\"  A young woman in a faded blue satin-glass house-dress was standing at the gate of the white picket fence. She watched in silence as the passenger stepped from the rocket car and lifted his hand to the driver in careless farewell.  \"Thanks for the lift, chum,\" said Mike Eagen.  \"Not at all,\" replied Marden. \"Glad to have been of service to Mike Eagen.\"  The woman smiled to him.  \"He's told you his name, I see.\"  Marden lifted his hat.  \"Indeed he has.\"  \"Michael is all right,\" she said. \"I do think, though, that he reads too many Buck Gordon Interplanetary comic books for a boy of eleven.\"   THE END     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ April 1956 and was     first published in _Amazing Stories_ November 1942.

Put a grain of wheat on the     first square--two on the second--four on the third. Keep doubling in     this manner and you will find there isn't enough wheat in the world     to fill the sixty-fourth square. It can be the same with compound     interest._   On the 201st day of the year 3221 A.D., the professor of history at the University of Terra seated himself in front of the Visaphone and prepared to deliver the daily lecture to his class, the members of which resided in different portions of the earth.  The instrument before which he seated himself was very like a great window sash, on account of the fact that there were three or four hundred frosted glass squares visible. In a space at the center, not occupied by any of these glass squares, was a dark oblong area and a ledge holding a piece of chalk. And above the area was a huge brass cylinder; toward this brass cylinder the professor would soon direct his subsequent remarks.  In order to assure himself that it was time to press the button which would notify the members of the class in history to approach their local Visaphones, the professor withdrew from his vest pocket a small contrivance which he held to his ear. Upon moving a tiny switch attached to the instrument, a metallic voice, seeming to come from somewhere in space, repeated mechanically: \"Fifteen o'clock and one minute--fifteen o'clock and one minute--fifteen o'clock and one min--\" Quickly, the professor replaced the instrument in his vest pocket and pressed a button at the side of the Visaphone.  As though in answer to the summons, the frosted squares began, one by one, to show the faces and shoulders of a peculiar type of young men; young men with great bulging foreheads, bald, toothless, and wearing immense horn spectacles. One square, however, still remained empty. On noticing this, a look of irritation passed over the professor's countenance.  But, seeing that every other glass square but this one was filled up, he commenced to talk.  \"I am pleased, gentlemen, to see you all posted at your local Visaphones this afternoon. I have prepared my lecture today upon a subject which is, perhaps, of more economic interest than historical. Unlike the previous lectures, my talk will not confine itself to the happenings of a few years, but will gradually embrace the course of ten centuries, the ten centuries, in fact, which terminated three hundred years before the present date. My lecture will be an exposition of the effects of the John Jones Dollar, originally deposited in the dawn of civilization, or to be more precise, in the year of 1921--just thirteen hundred years ago. This John Jon--\"  At this point in the professor's lecture, the frosted glass square which hitherto had shown no image, now filled up. Sternly he gazed at the head and shoulders that had just appeared.  \"B262H72476Male, you are late to class again. What excuse have you to offer today?\"  From the hollow cylinder emanated a shrill voice, while the lips of the picture on the glass square moved in unison with the words:  \"Professor, you will perceive by consulting your class book, that I have recently taken up my residence near the North Pole. For some reason, wireless communication between the Central Energy Station and all points north of 89 degrees was cut off a while ago, on account of which fact I could not appear in the Visaphone. Hence--\"  \"Enough, sir,\" roared the professor. \"Always ready with an excuse, B262H72476Male. I shall immediately investigate your tale.\"  From his coat pocket, the professor withdrew an instrument which, although supplied with an earpiece and a mouthpiece, had no wires whatever attached. Raising it to his lips, he spoke:  \"Hello. Central Energy Station, please.\" A pause ensued. \"Central Energy Station? This is the professor of history at the University of Terra, speaking. One of my students informs me that the North Pole region was out of communication with the Visaphone System this morning. Is that statement true? I would--\"  A voice, apparently from nowhere, spoke into the professor's ear. \"Quite true, Professor. A train of our ether waves accidently fell into parallelism with a train of waves from the Venus Substation. By the most peculiar mischance, the two trains happened to be displaced, with reference to each other, one half of a wave length, with the unfortunate result that the negative points of one coincided with the positive points of maximum amplitude of the other. Hence the two wave trains nullified each other and communication ceased for one hundred and eighty-five seconds--until the earth had revolved far enough to throw them out of parallelism.\"  \"Ah! Thank you,\" replied the professor. He dropped his instrument into his coat pocket and gazed in the direction of the glass square whose image had so aroused his ire. \"I apologize, B262H72476Male, for my suspicions as to your veracity--but I had in mind several former experiences.\" He shook a warning forefinger. \"I will now resume my talk.\"  \"A moment ago, gentlemen, I mentioned the John Jones Dollar. Some of you who have just enrolled with the class will undoubtedly say to yourselves: 'What is a John Jones? What is a Dollar?'  \"In the early days, before the present scientific registration of human beings was instituted by the National Eugenics Society, man went around under a crude multi-reduplicative system of nomenclature. Under this system there were actually more John Joneses than there are calories in a British Thermal Unit. But there was one John Jones, in particular, living in the twentieth century, to whom I shall refer in my lecture. Not much is known of his personal life except that he was an ardent socialist--a bitter enemy, in fact, of the private ownership of wealth.  \"Now as to the Dollar. At this day, when the Psycho-Erg, a combination of the Psych, the unit of esthetic satisfaction, and the Erg, the unit of mechanical energy, is recognized as the true unit of value, it seems difficult to believe that in the twentieth century and for more than ten centuries thereafter, the Dollar, a metallic circular disk, was being passed from hand to hand in exchange for the essentials of life.  \"But nevertheless, such was the case. Man exchanged his mental or physical energy for these Dollars. He then re-exchanged the Dollars for sustenance, raiment, pleasure, and operations for the removal of the vermiform appendix.  \"A great many individuals, however, deposited their Dollars in a stronghold called a bank. These banks invested the Dollars in loans and commercial enterprises, with the result that, every time the earth traversed the solar ecliptic, the banks compelled each borrower to repay, or to acknowledge as due, the original loan, plus six one-hundredths of that loan. And to the depositor, the banks paid three one-hundredths of the deposited Dollars for the use of the disks. This was known as three percent, or bank interest.  \"Now, the safety of Dollars, when deposited in banks, was not absolutely assured to the depositor. At times, the custodians of these Dollars were wont to appropriate them and proceed to portions of the earth, sparsely inhabited and accessible with difficulty. And at other times, nomadic groups known as 'yeggmen' visited the banks, opened the vaults by force, and departed, carrying with them the contents.  \"But to return to our subject. In the year 1921, one of these numerous John Joneses performed an apparently inconsequential action which caused the name of John Jones to go down in history. What did he do?  \"He proceeded to one of these banks, known at that time as 'The First National Bank of Chicago,' and deposited there, one of these disks--a silver Dollar--to the credit of a certain individual. And this individual to whose credit the Dollar was deposited was no other person than the fortieth descendant of John Jones who stipulated in paper which was placed in the files of the bank, that the descendancy was to take place along the oldest child of each of the generations which would constitute his posterity.  \"The bank accepted the Dollar under that understanding, together with another condition imposed by this John Jones, namely, that the interest was to be compounded annually. That meant that at the close of each year, the bank was to credit the account of John Jones's fortieth descendant with three one-hundredths of the account as it stood at the beginning of the year.  \"History tells us little more concerning this John Jones--only that he died in the year 1931, or ten years afterward, leaving several children.  \"Now you gentlemen who are taking mathematics under Professor L127M72421Male, of the University of Mars, will remember that where any number such as X, in passing through a progressive cycle of change, grows at the end of that cycle by a proportion p, then the value of the original X, after n cycles, becomes X(1 + p)^n.  \"Obviously, in this case, X equalled one Dollar; p equalled three one-hundredths; and n will depend upon any number of years which we care to consider, following the date of deposit. By a simple calculation, those of you who are today mentally alert can check up the results that I shall set forth in my lecture.  \"At the time that John Jones died, the amount in the First National Bank of Chicago to the credit of John Jones the fortieth, was as follows.\"  The professor seized the chalk and wrote rapidly upon the oblong space:      1931   10 years elapsed   $1.34  \"The peculiar sinuous hieroglyphic,\" he explained, \"is an ideograph representing the Dollar.  \"Well, gentlemen, time went on as time will, until a hundred years had passed by. The First National Bank still existed, and the locality, Chicago, had become the largest center of population upon the earth. Through the investments which had taken place, and the yearly compounding of interest, the status of John Jones's"]]]
