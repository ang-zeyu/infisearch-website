Those     which I took away amounted to the number of three     hundred and thirty-seven, all of them at present     uncapable of being opened. These are all written in     Greek characters. While I was busy in this work I     observed a large bundle, which, from the size, I     imagined must contain more than a single volume. I tried     with the utmost care to get it out, but could not, from     the damp and weight of it. However I perceived that it     consisted of about 18 volumes, each of which was in     length a palm and three Neapolitan inches, being the     largest hitherto discovered. They were wrapped about     with the bark of a tree and covered at each end with a     piece of wood. All these were written in Latin, as     appears by a few words which broke off from them. I was     in hopes to have got something out of them, but they are     in a worse condition than the Greek[55]....                     _From Sir J. Gray, Bart._                                           _29 October, 1754._      ... They have lately met with more rolls of Papyri of     different lengths and sizes, some with the _Umbilicus_     remaining in them: the greater part are Greek in small     capitals.... The Epicurean Philosophy is the subject of     another fragment.      A small bust of Epicurus, with his name in Greek     characters, was found in the same room, and was possibly     the ornament of that part of the library where the     writings in favour of his principles were kept; and it     may also be supposed that some other heads of     philosophers found in the same room were placed with the     same taste and propriety[56].  Between 1758 and 1763, the place was visited by Winckelmann, who wrote long letters in Italian, describing what he saw, to Consigliere Bianconi, Physician to the King of Saxony. One of these, dated 1762, gives the following account of the library:      Ii luogo in cui per la prima volta caddero sott' occhio,     fu una piccola stanza nella villa d'Ercolano di cui     parlammo sopra, la cui lunghezza due uomini colle     braccia distese potevano misurare. Tutto all' intorno     del muro vi erano degli scaffali quali si vedono     ordinariamente negli archivi ad altezza d' uomo, e nel     mezzo della stanza v' era un altro scaffale simile o     tavola per tenervi scritture, e tale da potervi girare     intorno. Il legno di questa tavola era ridotto a     carboni, e cadde, come è facile ad imaginarselo, tutta     in pezzi quando si toccò. Alcuni di questi rotoli di     papiri si trovarono involti insieme con carta più     grossolana, di quella qualità che gli antichi chiamavano     _emporetica_, e questi probabilmente formavano le parti     ed i libri d' un' opera intiera[57]....      The place in which they [the rolls] were first seen was     a small room in the villa at Herculaneum of which we     spoke above, the length of which could be covered by two     men with their arms extended. All round the wall there     were book-cases such as are commonly seen in     record-rooms, of a man's height, and in the middle of     the room there was another similar book-case or table to     hold writings, of such a size that one could go round     it. The wood of this table was reduced to charcoal, and,     as may easily be imagined, fell all to pieces when it     was touched. Some of these papyrus rolls were found     fastened together with paper of coarser texture, of that     quality which the ancients called _emporetica_, and     these probably formed the parts and books of an entire     work.  The information which these observers have given us amounts to this: the room was about 12 feet long, with a floor of mosaic. Against the walls stood presses, of a man's height, inlaid with different sorts of wood, disposed in rows, with cornices at the top; and there was also a table, or press, in the centre of the room. Most of the rolls were separate, but a bundle of eighteen was found \"wrapped about with the bark of a tree, and covered at each end with a piece of wood.\" A room so small as this could hardly have been intended for study. It must rather have been the place where the books were put away after they had been read elsewhere.  Before I quit this part of my subject, I should like to mention one other building, as its arrangements throw light on the question of fitting up libraries and record-offices. I allude to the structure built by Vespasian, A.D. 78, to contain the documents relating to his restoration of the city of Rome. It stood at the south-west corner of the Forum of Peace, and what now exists of it is known as the Church of SS. Cosma e Damiano.  The general arrangement and relation to adjoining structures will be understood from the plan (fig. 7). The room was about 125 feet long by 65 feet broad, with two entrances, one on the north-west, from the _Forum Pacis_, through a hexastyle portico (fig. 7. 2), the other on the north-east, through a square-headed doorway of travertine which still exists (_ibid._ 1) together with a considerable portion of a massive wall of Vespasian's time. After a restoration by Caracalla the building came to be called _Templum Sacræ Urbis_. It was first consecrated as a church by pope Felix IV. (526-530), but he did little more than connect it with the _Heroon Romuli_ (_ibid._ 5), and build the apse (_ibid._ 4).  [Illustration: Fig. 7. Plan of the Record-House of Vespasian, with the adjoining structures.]  [Illustration: Fig. 8. Part of the internal wall of the Record-House of Vespasian.  Reduced from a sketch taken in the 16th century by Pirro Ligorio.]  The whole building was mercilessly mutilated by pope Urban VIII. in 1632; but fortunately a drawing of the interior had been made by Pirro Ligorio in the second half of the sixteenth century, when the original treatment of the walls was practically intact. I give a reduced copy of a small portion of this drawing (fig. 8). As Lanciani says:      The walls were divided into three horizontal bands by     finely cut cornices. The upper band was occupied by the     windows; the lower was simply lined with marble slabs     covered by the bookcases ... which contained the ...     records ...; the middle one was incrusted with     tarsia-work of the rarest kinds of marble with panels     representing panoplies, the wolf with the infant     founders of Rome, and other allegorical scenes[58].  I explained at the beginning of this chapter that my subject is the care of books, not books themselves; but, at the point which we have now reached in regard to Roman libraries, it is necessary to make a few remarks about their contents. It must be remembered, in the first place, that those who fitted them up had to deal with rolls (_volumina_), probably of papyrus, but possibly of parchment; and that a book, as we understand the word, the Latin equivalent for which was _codex_, did not come into general use until long after the Christian era. Some points about these rolls require notice.  The length and the width of the roll depended on the taste or convenience of the writer[59]. The contents were written in columns, the lines of which ran parallel to the long dimension[60], and the reader, holding the roll in both hands, rolled up the part he had finished with his left hand, and unrolled the unread portion with his right. This way of dealing with the roll is well shewn in the accompanying illustration (fig. 9) reduced from a fresco at Pompeii[61]. In most examples the two halves of the roll are turned inwards, as for instance in the well-known statue of Demosthenes in the Vatican[62]. The end of the roll was fastened to a stick (usually referred to as _umbilicus_ or _umbilici_). It is obvious that this word ought properly to denote the ends of the stick only, but it was constantly applied to the whole stick, and not to a part of it, as for instance in the following lines:      ... deus nam me vetat   Inceptos olim promissum carmen iambos     Ad umbilicum adducere[63].      ... for heaven forbids me to cover the scroll down to     the stick with the iambic lines I had begun a song     promised long ago to the world.  [Illustration: Fig. 9. A reader with a roll: from a fresco at Pompeii.]  These sticks were sometimes painted or gilt, and furnished with projecting knobs (_cornua_) similarly decorated, intended to serve both as an ornament, and as a contrivance to keep the ends of the roll even, while it was being rolled up. The sides of the long dimension of the roll (_frontes_) were carefully cut, so as to be perfectly symmetrical, and afterwards smoothed with pumice-stone and coloured. A ticket (_index_ or _titulus_, in Greek [Greek: sillubos] or [Greek: sittubos]), made of a piece of papyrus or parchment, was fastened to the edge of the roll in such a way that it hung out over one or other of the ends. As Ovid says:    Cetera turba palam titulos ostendet apertos     Et sua detecta nomina fronte geret[64].      The others will flaunt their titles openly, and carry     their names on an uncovered edge.  The roll was kept closed by strings or straps (_lora_), usually of some bright colour[65]; and if it was specially precious, an envelope which the Greeks called a jacket ([Greek: diphthera][66]), made of parchment or some other substance, was provided. Says Martial:    Perfer Atestinæ nondum vulgata Sabinæ     Carmina, purpurea sed modo culta toga[67].      Convey to Sabina at Ateste these verses. They have not     yet been published, and have been but lately dressed in     a purple garment.  Martial has combined in a single epigram most of the ornaments with which rolls could be decorated. This I will quote next, premising that the oil of cedar, or _arbor-vitæ_, mentioned in the second line not only imparted an agreeable yellow colour, but was held to be an antiseptic[68]. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26378"],["title","The Care of Books (#8)"],["body","   Faustini fugis in sinum? sapisti.   Cedro nunc licet ambules perunctus   Et frontis gemino decens honore   Pictis luxurieris umbilicis,   Et te purpura delicata velet,   Et cocco rubeat superbus index[69].  His book had selected the bibliomaniac Faustinus as a patron. Now, says the poet, you shall be anointed with oil of cedar; you shall revel in the decoration of both your sets of edges; your sticks shall be painted; your covering shall be purple, and your ticket scarlet.  When a number of rolls had to be carried from one place to another, they were put into a box (_scrinium_ or _capsa_). This receptacle was cylindrical in shape, not unlike a modern hat-box[70]. It was carried by a flexible handle, attached to a ring on each side; and the lid was held down by what looks very like a modern lock. The eighteen rolls, found in a bundle at Herculaneum, had doubtless been kept in a similar receptacle.  My illustration (fig. 10) is from a fresco at Herculaneum. It will be noticed that each roll is furnished with a ticket (_titulus_). At the feet of the statue of Demosthenes already referred to, and of that of Sophocles, are _capsæ_, both of which show the flexible handles.  [Illustration: Fig. 10. Book-box or capsa.]  I will next collect the information available respecting the fittings used in Roman libraries. I admit that it is scattered and imperfect; but legitimate deductions may, I think, be arrived at from it, which will give us tolerably certain ideas of the appearance of one of those collections.  The words used to designate such fittings are: _nidus_; _forulus_, or more usually _foruli_; _loculamenta_; _pluteus_; _pegmata_.  _Nidus_ needs no explanation. It can only mean a pigeon-hole. Martial uses it of a bookseller, at whose shop his own poems may be bought.    De primo dabit alterove _nido_   Rasum pumice purpuraque cultum   Denaris tibi quinque Martialem[71].      Out of his first or second pigeon-hole, polished with     pumice stone, and smart with a purple covering, for five     denarii he will give you Martial.  In a subsequent epigram the word occurs with reference to a private library, to which the poet is sending a copy of his works.    Ruris bibliotheca delicati,   Vicinam videt unde lector urbem,   Inter carmina sanctiora si quis   Lascivæ fuerit locus Thaliæ,   Hos _nido_ licet inseras vel imo   Septem quos tibi misimus libellos[72].      O library of that well-appointed villa whence a reader     can see the City near at hand--if among more serious     poems there be any room for the wanton Muse of Comedy,     you may place these seven little books I send you even     in your lowest pigeon-hole.  _Forulus_ or _foruli_ occurs in the following passages. Suetonius, after describing the building of the temple of the Palatine Apollo by Augustus, adds, \"he placed the Sibylline books in two gilt receptacles (_forulis_) under the base of the statue of Palatine Apollo\"[73]; and Juvenal, enumerating the gifts that a rich man is sure to receive if burnt out of house and home, says,    Hic libros dabit, et _forulos_, mediamque Minervam[74].  The word is of uncertain derivation, but _forus_, of which it is clearly the diminutive, is used by Virgil for the cells of bees:    Complebuntque _foros_ et floribus horrea texent[75].  The above-quoted passage of Juvenal may therefore be rendered: \"Another will give books, and cells to put them in, and a statue of Minerva for the middle of the room.\"  The word _loculamentum_ is explained in a passage of Columella, in which he gives directions for the making of dovecotes:      Let small stakes be placed close together, with planks     laid across them to carry cells (_loculamenta_) for the     birds to build their nests in, or sets of pigeon-holes     made of earthenware[76].  In a second passage he uses the same word for a beehive[77]; Vegetius, a writer on veterinary surgery, uses it for the socket of a horse's tooth[78]; and Vitruvius, in a more general way, for a case to contain a small piece of machinery[79]. Generally, the word may be taken to signify a long narrow box, open at one end, and, like _nidus_ and _forulus_, may be translated \"pigeon-hole.\" Seneca, again, applies the word to books in the passage I have already translated, and in a singularly instructive manner. \"You will find,\" he says, \"in the libraries of the most arrant idlers all that orators or historians have written--bookcases (_loculamenta_) built up as high as the ceiling[80].\"  _Pegmata_, for the word generally occurs in the plural, are, as the name implies, things fixed together, usually planks of wood framed into a platform, and used in theatres to carry pieces of scenery or performers up and down. As applied to books \"shelves\" are probably meant: an interpretation borne out by the _Digest_, in which it is stated that \"window-frames and _pegmata_ are included in the purchase of a house[81].\" They were therefore what we should call \"fixtures.\"  A _pluteus_ was a machine used by infantry for protection in the field: and hence the word is applied to any fence, or boarding to form the limit or edge of anything, as a table or a bed. _Plutei_ were not attached so closely to the walls as _pegmata_, for in the _Digest_ they are classed with nets to keep out birds, mats, awnings, and the like, and are not to be regarded as part and parcel of a house[82]. Juvenal uses the word for a shelf in his second Satire, where he is denouncing pretenders to knowledge:     Indocti primum, quamquam plena omnia gypso   Chrysippi invenias, nam perfectissimus horum est   Si quis Aristotelem similem vel Pittacon emit   Et iubet archetypos pluteum servare Cleanthas[83].      In the first place they are dunces, though you find     their houses full of plaster figures of Chrysippus: for     a man of this sort is not fully equipped until he buys a     likeness of Aristotle or Pittacus, and bids a shelf take     care of original portraits of Cleanthes.  This investigation has shewn that three of the words applied to the preservation of books, namely, _nidus_, _forulus_, and _loculamentum_, may be rendered by the English \"pigeon-hole\"; and that _pegma_ and _pluteus_ mean contrivances of wood which may be rendered by the English \"shelving.\" It is quite clear that _pegmata_ could be run up with great rapidity, from a very graphic account in Cicero's letters of the rearrangement of his library. He begins by writing to his friend Atticus as follows:      I wish you would send me any two fellows out of your     library, for Tyrannio to make use of as pasters, and     assistants in other matters. Remind them to bring some     vellum with them to make those titles (_indices_) which     you Greeks, I believe, call [Greek: silluboi]. You are     not to do this if it is inconvenient to you[84]....  In the next letter he says:      Your men have made my library gay with their     carpentry-work and their titles (_constructione et     sillybis_). I wish you would commend them[85].  When all is completed he writes:      Now that Tyrannio has arranged my books, a new spirit     has been infused into my house. In this matter the help     of your men Dionysius and Menophilus has been     invaluable. Nothing could look neater than those shelves     of yours (_illa tua pegmata_), since they smartened up     my books with their titles[86].  No other words than those I have been discussing are, so far as I know, applied by the best writers to the storage of books; and, after a careful study of the passages in which they occur, I conclude that, so long as rolls only had to be accommodated, private libraries in Rome were fitted with rows of shelves standing against the walls (_plutei_), or fixed to them (_pegmata_). The space between these horizontal shelves was subdivided by vertical divisions into pigeon-holes (_nidi_, _foruli_, _loculamenta_), and it may be conjectured that the width of these pigeon-holes would vary in accordance with the number of rolls included in a single work. That such receptacles were the common furniture of a library is proved, I think, by such evidence as the epigram of Martial quoted above, in which he tells his friend that if he will accept his poems, he may \"put them even in the lowest pigeon-hole (_nido vel imo_),\" as we should say, \"on the bottom shelf\"; and by the language of Seneca when he sneers at the \"pigeon-holes (_loculamenta_) carried up to the ceiling.\"  The height of the woodwork varied, of course, with individual taste. In the library on the Esquiline the height was only three feet six inches; at Herculaneum about six feet.  I can find no hint of any doors, or curtains, in front of the pigeon-holes. That the ends of the rolls (_frontes_) were visible, is, I think, quite clear from what Cicero says of his own library after the construction of his shelves (_pegmata_); and the various devices for making rolls attractive seem to me to prove that they were intended to be seen.  A representation of rolls arranged on the system which I have attempted to describe, occurs on a piece of sculpture (fig. 11) found at Neumagen near Trèves in the seventeenth century, among the ruins of a fortified camp attributed to Constantine the Great[87]. Two divisions, full of rolls, are shewn, from which a man, presumably the librarian, is selecting one. The ends of the rolls are furnished with tickets.  [Illustration: Fig. 11. A Roman taking down a roll from its place in a library.]  The system of pigeon-holes terminated, in all probability, in a cornice. The explorers of Herculaneum depose to the discovery of such an ornament there.  The wall-space above the book-cases was decorated with the likenesses of celebrated authors--either philosophers, if the owner of the library wished to bring into prominence his adhesion to one of the fashionable systems--or authors, dead and living, or personal friends. This obvious form of decoration was, in all probability, used at Pergamon[88]; Pollio, as we have seen, introduced it"]]]
