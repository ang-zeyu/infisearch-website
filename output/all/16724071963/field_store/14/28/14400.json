Yes, there is Jamie on the gate watching for us; now you'll see the Clan gather; they are always swarming about together.”  The instant Jamie saw the approaching guests he gave a shrill whistle, which was answered by echoes from meadow, house and barn, as the cousins came running from all directions, shouting, “Hooray for Uncle Alec!”  They went at the carriage like highwaymen, robbed it of every parcel, took the occupants prisoners, and marched them into the house with great exultation.  “Little Mum! little Mum! here they are with lots of goodies! Come down and see the fun right away! Quick!” bawled Will and Geordie amidst a general ripping off of papers and a reckless cutting of strings that soon turned the tidy room into a chaos.  Down came Aunt Jessie with her pretty cap half on, but such a beaming face below it that one rather thought the fly-away head-gear an improvement than otherwise. She had hardly time to greet Rose and the doctor before the boys were about her, each clamouring for her to see his gift and rejoice over it with him, for “little Mum” went halves in everything. The great horns skirmished about her as if to toss her to the ceiling; the war clubs hurtled over her head as if to annihilate her; an amazing medley from the four quarters of the globe filled her lap, and seven excited boys all talked to her at once.  But she liked it; oh dear, yes! and sat smiling, admiring, and explaining, quite untroubled by the din, which made Rose cover up her ears and Dr. Alec threaten instant flight if the riot was not quelled. That threat produced a lull, and while the uncle received thanks in one corner, the aunt had some little confidences made to her in the other.  “Well, dear, and how are things going with you now? Better, I hope, than they were a week ago.”  “Aunt Jessie, I think I'm going to be very happy, now uncle has come. He does the queerest things, but he is so good to me I can't help loving him”; and, nestling closer to little Mum, Rose told all that had happened, ending with a rapturous account of the splendid box.  “I am very glad, dear. But, Rose, I must warn you of one thing; don't let uncle spoil you.”  “But I like to be spoilt, auntie.”  “I don't doubt it; but if you turn out badly when the year is over he will be blamed, and his experiment prove a failure. That would be a pity, wouldn't it? when he wants to do so much for you, and can do it if his kind heart does not get in the way of his good judgment.”  “I never thought of that, and I'll try not to be spoilt. But how can I help it?” asked Rose anxiously.  “By not complaining of the wholesome things he wants you to do; by giving him cheerful obedience as well as love; and even making some small sacrifices for his sake.”  “I will, I truly will! and when I get in a worry about things may I come to you? Uncle told me to, and I feel as if I shouldn't be afraid.”  “You may, darling; this is the place where little troubles are best cured, and this is what mothers are for, I fancy”; and Aunt Jessie drew the curly head to her shoulder with a tender look that proved how well she knew what medicine the child most needed.  It was so sweet and comfortable that Rose sat still enjoying it till a little voice said,  “Mamma, don't you think Pokey would like some of my shells? Rose gave Phebe some of her nice things, and it was very good of her. Can I?”  “Who is Pokey?” asked Rose, popping up her head, attracted by the odd name.  “My dolly; do you want to see her?” asked Jamie, who had been much impressed by the tale of adoption he had overheard.  “Yes; I'm fond of dollies, only don't tell the boys, or they will laugh at me.”  “They don't laugh at me, and they play with my dolly a great deal; but she likes me best”; and Jamie ran away to produce his pet.  “I brought my old doll, but I keep her hidden because I am too big to play with her, and yet I can't bear to throw her away, I'm so fond of her,” said Rose, continuing her confidences in a whisper.  “You can come and play with Jamie's whenever you like, for we believe in dollies up here,” began Aunt Jessie, smiling to herself as if something amused her.  Just then Jamie came back, and Rose understood the smile, for his dolly proved to be a pretty four-year-old little girl, who trotted in as fast as her fat legs would carry her, and making straight for the shells, scrambled up an armful, saying, with a laugh that showed her little white teeth,  “All for Dimmy and me, for Dimmy and me!”  “That's my dolly; isn't she a nice one?” asked Jamie, proudly surveying his pet with his hands behind him and his short legs rather far apart a manly attitude copied from his brothers.  “She is a dear dolly. But why call her Pokey?” asked Rose, charmed with the new plaything.  “She is such an inquisitive little body she is always poking that mite of a nose into everything; and as Paul Pry did not suit, the boys fell to calling her Pokey. Not a pretty name, but very expressive.”  It certainly was, for, having examined the shells, the busy tot laid hold of everything she could find, and continued her researches till Archie caught her sucking his carved ivory chessmen to see if they were not barley sugar. Rice paper pictures were also discovered crumpled up in her tiny pocket, and she nearly smashed Will's ostrich egg by trying to sit upon it.  “Here, Jim, take her away; she's worse than the puppies, and we can't have her round,” commanded the elder brother, picking her up and handing her over to the little fellow, who received her with open arms and the warning remark,  “You'd better mind what you do, for I'm going to 'dopt Pokey like Rose did Phebe, and then you'll have to be very good to her, you big fellows.”  “'Dopt away, baby, and I'll give you a cage to keep her in, or you won't have her long, for she is getting worse than a monkey”; and Archie went back to his mates, while Aunt Jessie, foreseeing a crisis, proposed that Jamie should take his dolly home, as she was borrowed, and it was time her visit ended.  “My dolly is better than yours, isn't she? 'cause she can walk and talk and sing and dance, and yours can't do anything, can she?” asked Jamie with pride, as he regarded his Pokey, who just then had been moved to execute a funny little jig and warble the well-known couplet,      “'Puss-tat, puss-tat, where you been?'      'I been Lunnin, to saw a Tween.”'  After which superb display she retired, escorted by Jamie, both making a fearful din blowing on conch shells.  “We must tear ourselves away, Rose, because I want to get you home before sunset. Will you come for a drive, Jessie?” said Dr. Alec, as the music died away in the distance.  “No, thank you; but I see the boys want a scamper, so, if you don't mind, they may escort you home, but not go in. That is only allowed on holidays.”  The words were hardly out of Aunt Jessie's mouth when Archie said, in a tone of command,  “Pass the word, lads. Boot and saddle, and be quick about it.”  “All right!” And in a moment not a vestige of boy remained but the litter on the floor.  The cavalcade went down the hill at a pace that made Rose cling to her uncle's arm, for the fat old horses got excited by the antics of the ponies careering all about them, and went as fast as they could pelt, with the gay dog-cart rattling in front, for Archie and Charlie scorned shelties since this magnificent equipage had been set up. Ben enjoyed the fun, and the lads cut up capers till Rose declared that “circus” was the proper name for them after all.  When they reached the house they dismounted, and stood, three on each side the steps, in martial attitudes, while her ladyship was handed out with great elegance by Uncle Alec. Then the Clan saluted, mounted at word of command, and with a wild whoop tore down the avenue in what they considered the true Arab style.  “That was splendid, now it is safely ended,” said Rose, skipping up the steps with her head over her shoulder to watch the dear tassels bob about.  “I shall get you a pony as soon as you are a little stronger,” said Dr. Alec, watching her with a smile.  “Oh, I couldn't ride one of those horrid, frisky little beasts! They roll their eyes and bounce about so, I should die of fright,” cried Rose, clasping her hands tragically.  “Are you a coward?”  “About horses I am.”  “Never mind, then; come and see my new room”; and he led the way upstairs without another word.  As Rose followed she remembered her promise to Aunt Jessie, and was sorry she had objected so decidedly. She was a great deal more sorry five minutes later, and well she might be.  “Now, take a good look, and tell me what you think of it,” said Dr. Alec, opening the door and letting her enter before him, while Phebe was seen whisking down the backstairs with a dust-pan.  Rose walked to the middle of the room, stood still, and gazed about her with eyes that brightened as they looked, for all was changed.  This chamber had been built out over the library to suit some fancy, and had been unused for years, except at Christmas times, when the old house overflowed. It had three windows one to the east, that overlooked the bay; one to the south, where the horse-chestnuts waved their green fans; and one to the west, towards the hill and the evening sky. A ruddy sunset burned there now, filling the room with an enchanted glow; the soft murmur of the sea was heard, and a robin chirped “Good-night!”  among the budding trees.  Rose saw and heard these things first, and felt their beauty with a child's quick instinct; then her eye took in the altered aspect of the room, once so shrouded, still and solitary, now so full of light and warmth and simple luxury.  India matting covered the floor, with a gay rug here and there; the antique andirons shone on the wide hearth, where a cheery blaze"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2727"],["title","Allan's Wife (#0)"],["body","Allan’s Wife  by H.

FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER     DEDICATION       My Dear Macumazahn,     It was your native name which I borrowed at the christening of that     Allan who has become as well known to me as any other friend I     have. It is therefore fitting that I should dedicate to you this,     his last tale—the story of his wife, and the history of some     further adventures which befell him. They will remind you of many     an African yarn—that with the baboons may recall an experience of     your own which I did not share. And perhaps they will do more than     this. Perhaps they will bring back to you some of the long past     romance of days that are lost to us. The country of which Allan     Quatermain tells his tale is now, for the most part, as well known     and explored as are the fields of Norfolk. Where we shot and     trekked and galloped, scarcely seeing the face of civilized man,     there the gold-seeker builds his cities. The shadow of the flag of     Britain has, for a while, ceased to fall on the Transvaal plains;     the game has gone; the misty charm of the morning has become the     glare of day. All is changed. The blue gums that we planted in the     garden of the “Palatial” must be large trees by now, and the     “Palatial” itself has passed from us. Jess sat in it waiting for     her love after we were gone. There she nursed him back to life. But     Jess is dead, and strangers own it, or perhaps it is a ruin.     For us too, Macumazahn, as for the land we loved, the mystery and     promise of the morning are outworn; the mid-day sun burns overhead,     and at times the way is weary. Few of those we knew are left. Some     are victims to battle and murder, their bones strew the veldt;     death has taken some in a more gentle fashion; others are hidden     from us, we know not where. We might well fear to return to that     land lest we also should see ghosts. But though we walk apart     to-day, the past yet looks upon us with its unalterable eyes. Still     we can remember many a boyish enterprise and adventure, lightly     undertaken, which now would strike us as hazardous indeed. Still we     can recall the long familiar line of the Pretoria Horse, the face     of war and panic, the weariness of midnight patrols; aye, and hear     the roar of guns echoed from the Shameful Hill.     To you then, Macumazahn, in perpetual memory of those eventful     years of youth which we passed together in the African towns and on     the African veldt, I dedicate these pages, subscribing myself now     as always,     Your sincere friend,     Indanda.     To Arthur H. D. Cochrane, Esq.     ALLAN’S WIFE     CHAPTER I. EARLY DAYS   It may be remembered that in the last pages of his diary, written just before his death, Allan Quatermain makes allusion to his long dead wife, stating that he has written of her fully elsewhere.  When his death was known, his papers were handed to myself as his literary executor. Among them I found two manuscripts, of which the following is one. The other is simply a record of events wherein Mr. Quatermain was not personally concerned—a Zulu novel, the story of which was told to him by the hero many years after the tragedy had occurred. But with this we have nothing to do at present.  I have often thought (Mr. Quatermain’s manuscript begins) that I would set down on paper the events connected with my marriage, and the loss of my most dear wife. Many years have now passed since that event, and to some extent time has softened the old grief, though Heaven knows it is still keen enough. On two or three occasions I have even begun the record. Once I gave it up because the writing of it depressed me beyond bearing, once because I was suddenly called away upon a journey, and the third time because a Kaffir boy found my manuscript convenient for lighting the kitchen fire.  But now that I am at leisure here in England, I will make a fourth attempt. If I succeed, the story may serve to interest some one in after years when I am dead and gone; before that I should not wish it to be published. It is a wild tale enough, and suggests some curious reflections.  I am the son of a missionary. My father was originally curate in charge of a small parish in Oxfordshire. He had already been some ten years married to my dear mother when he went there, and he had four children, of whom I was the youngest. I remember faintly the place where we lived. It was an ancient long grey house, facing the road. There was a very large tree of some sort in the garden. It was hollow, and we children used to play about inside of it, and knock knots of wood from the rough bark. We all slept in a kind of attic, and my mother always came and kissed us when we were in bed. I used to wake up and see her bending over me, a candle in her hand. There was a curious kind of pole projecting from the wall over my bed. Once I was dreadfully frightened because my eldest brother made me hang to it by my hands. That is all I remember about our old home. It has been pulled down long ago, or I would journey there to see it.  A little further down the road was a large house with big iron gates to it, and on the top of the gate pillars sat two stone lions, which were so hideous that I was afraid of them. Perhaps this sentiment was prophetic. One could see the house by peeping through the bars of the gates. It was a gloomy-looking place, with a tall yew hedge round it; but in the summer-time some flowers grew about the sun-dial in the grass plat. This house was called the Hall, and Squire Carson lived there. One Christmas—it must have been the Christmas before my father emigrated, or I should not remember it—we children went to a Christmas-tree festivity at the Hall. There was a great party there, and footmen wearing red waistcoats stood at the door. In the dining-room, which was panelled with black oak, was the Christmas-tree. Squire Carson stood in front of it. He was a tall, dark man, very quiet in his manners, and he wore a bunch of seals on his waistcoat. We used to think him old, but as a matter of fact he was then not more than forty. He had been, as I afterwards learned, a great traveller in his youth, and some six or seven years before this date he married a lady who was half a Spaniard—a papist, my father called her. I can remember her well. She was small and very pretty, with a rounded figure, large black eyes, and glittering teeth. She spoke English with a curious accent. I suppose that I must have been a funny child to look at, and I know that my hair stood up on my head then as it does now, for I still have a sketch of myself that my mother made of me, in which this peculiarity is strongly marked. On this occasion of the Christmas-tree I remember that Mrs. Carson turned to a tall, foreign-looking gentleman who stood beside her, and, tapping him affectionately on the shoulder with her gold eye-glasses, said—  “Look, cousin—look at that droll little boy with the big brown eyes; his hair is like a—what you call him?—scrubbing-brush. Oh, what a droll little boy!”  The tall gentleman pulled at his moustache, and, taking Mrs. Carson’s hand in his, began to smooth my hair down with it till I heard her whisper—  “Leave go my hand, cousin. Thomas is looking like—like the thunderstorm.”  Thomas was the name of Mr. Carson, her husband.  After that I hid myself as well as I could behind a chair, for I was shy, and watched little Stella Carson, who was the squire’s only child, giving the children presents off the tree. She was dressed as Father Christmas, with some soft white stuff round her lovely little face, and she had large dark eyes, which I thought more beautiful than anything I had ever seen. At last it came to my turn to receive a present—oddly enough, considered in the light of future events, it was a large monkey. Stella reached it down from one of the lower boughs of the tree and handed it to me, saying—  “Dat is my Christmas present to you, little Allan Quatermain.”  As she did so her sleeve, which was covered with cotton wool, spangled over with something that shone, touched one of the tapers and caught fire—how I do not know—and the flame ran up her arm towards her throat. She stood quite still. I suppose that she was paralysed with fear; and the ladies who were near screamed very loud, but did nothing. Then some impulse seized me—perhaps instinct would be a better word to use, considering my age. I threw myself upon the child, and, beating at the fire with my hands, mercifully succeeded in extinguishing it before it really got hold. My wrists were so badly scorched that they had to be wrapped up in wool for a long time afterwards, but with the exception of a single burn upon her throat, little Stella Carson was not much hurt.  This is all that I remember about the Christmas-tree at the Hall. What happened afterwards is lost to me, but to this day in my sleep I sometimes see little Stella’s sweet face and the stare of terror in her dark eyes as the fire ran up her arm. This, however, is not wonderful, for I had, humanly speaking, saved the life of her who was destined to be my wife.  The next event which I can recall clearly is that my mother and three brothers all fell ill of fever, owing, as I afterwards learned, to the poisoning of our well by some evil-minded person, who threw a dead sheep into it.  It must have been while they were ill that Squire Carson came one day to the vicarage. The weather was still cold, for there was a fire in the study, and I sat before the fire writing letters"]]]
