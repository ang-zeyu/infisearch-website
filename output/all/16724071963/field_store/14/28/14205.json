But please don't try to get your own back on me.\"  As a precautionary measure Dudley beat the side of the bath with the towel.  It might have been efficacious if the subaltern had been engaging in apiarian operations, but as far as present events went it was a \"frost.\"  \"Tilt it, old man,\" suggested Laxdale.  Wilmshurst carried out this suggestion only too well.  The bath, slipping from its supporting fixtures, clattered noisily to the floor, its edge descending heavily upon Dudley's foot.  Again a momentary vision of the leaping rodent, then, crash!  With a mighty sweep of the tower-roller Laxdale demolished the electric-light globe into a thousand fragments.  \"Getting on,\" he remarked cheerfully.  \"There'll be a big bill for 'barrack damages' eh, what?  Where's the brute?\"  The rat, terrified by the din, had retired to a recess formed by the bulkhead of the cabin and the fixed wash-basin and was acting strictly on the defensive.  \"Aha!\" exclaimed Laxdale.  \"Now you're cornered.  No use yelling 'Mercy, kamerad.'\"  Levelling the roller like a billiard cue the subaltern prepared to make a thrust and administer the _coup de gr√¢ce_, but he had forgotten that he had not yet found his sea-legs.  A roll of the ship made him lose his balance, and he pitched head foremost into the rodent's retreat. Like a flash the rat leapt, scampered over Laxdale's helmet, down his back and took refuge in the breast-pocket of Wilmshurst's tunic.  Dudley beat all records in slipping off his Sam Browne and discarding the tunic, for by the time his companion had regained his feet the garment lay on the floor.  \"Stamp on it!\" yelled the now thoroughly excited and exasperated subaltern.  \"It's my tunic, remember,\" protested Dudley firmly as he pushed his brother-officer aside.  Just then the door opened, and Spofforth, another member of the \"Lone Star Crush\" appeared, enquiring, \"What's all the row about, you fellows?  Scrapping?\"  \"Shut that door!\" exclaimed Laxdale hurriedly.  \"Either in or out, old man.\"  The hunters suspended operations to wipe the streams of perspiration from their faces and to explain matters.  \"Ratting, eh?\" queried Spofforth.  \"You fellows look like a pair of Little Willies looting a French chateau.\"  \"Hullo!  More of 'em,\" murmured Laxdale as the door was unceremoniously pushed open and another of the \"One Pip\" officers made his appearance. \"Look alive, Danvers, and don't stand there looking in the air.  Walk in and take a pew, if you can find one.\"  \"I've come to borrow a glass,\" remarked the latest arrival.  \"Mine's smashed and my batman hasn't unpacked my aluminium traps.  Judging by appearances, by Jove!  I've drawn a blank.  What's up--a toppin' rag, or have the water pipes burst?\"  Wilmshurst and Laxdale sat on the upper bunk, Spofforth on the closed lid of the wash-basin stand, and Danvers found a temporary resting-place on the none too rigid top of a cabin trunk.  Each man kept his feet carefully clear of the floor, while four pairs of eyes were fixed upon Dudley's tunic, the folds of which were pulsating under the violent lung-movements of the sheltering rodent.  \"Why not shake the brute out?\" suggested Danvers.  \"You try it,\" suggested Laxdale, whose enthusiasm was decidedly on the wane.  \"Wilmshurst here has turned mouldy.  He refuses point blank to let me use his raiment of neutral colour as a door-mat.  I might add that if you've ever had the experience of a particularly active member of the rodent family scampering down your back you wouldn't be quite so keen.\"  \"How about turning out the machine-gun section?\" asked Spofforth. \"Look here, if you fellows want to be ready for tiffen you'd better get a move on.  Suppose----\"  \"Still they come!\" exclaimed Laxdale, as a knock sounded on the jalousie of the cabin door.  \"Come in.\"  It was Tari Barl in search of his master.  \"Tarry Barrel, you old sinner,\" said Wilmshurst, \"can you catch a rat?\"  \"Me lib for find Mutton Chop, sah,\" replied the Haussa saluting.  \"Find him one time and come quick.\"  Dudley looked enquiringly at his cabin-mate, knowing that Mutton Chop was Laxdale's servant.  \"Oh, so that rascal's the culprit,\" declared Laxdale.  \"Didn't I say I thought so?\"  \"Bring Mutton Chop here,\" ordered Wilmshurst, addressing the broadly smiling Tari Barl.  The Haussa vanished, presently to reappear with almost an exact counterpart of himself.  It would be a difficult matter for a stranger to tell the difference between the two natives.  \"What d'ye mean, you black scoundrel, by putting a rat into my traps?\" demanded Laxdale.  \"No did put, sah; him lib for come one time,\" expostulated Laxdale's servant.  \"Me play, 'Come to cook-house door,' den him catchee.\"  Producing a small native flute Mutton Chop began to play a soft air. For perhaps thirty seconds every one and everything else was still in the desolated cabin; then slowly but without any signs of furtiveness the rat pushed his head between the folds of Wilmshurst's tunic, sniffed, and finally emerged, sat up on his hind legs, his long whiskers quivering with evident delight.  Then, with a deft movement, Mutton Chop's fingers closed gently round the little animal, and to the astonishment of the four officers the Haussa placed the rodent in his breast pocket.  \"Me hab mascot same as officers, sahs!\" he explained.  \"No put him here, sah; me make tidy.\"  \"And there's the officers' call!\" exclaimed Dudley as a bugle rang out. \"Dash it all, how's a fellow to put on the thing?\"  And he indicated the crumpled tunic.     CHAPTER III  THE RAIDER  Accompanied by five other transports and escorted by the light cruiser _Tompion_, the _Zungeru_ ploughed her way at a modest fifteen knots through the tropical waters of the Atlantic.  Although there was little to fear from the attacks of U-boats, for up to the present these craft had not appeared south of the Equator, mines had been laid by disguised German ships right in the area where numerous trade routes converge in the neighbourhood of the Cape of Good Hope, while there were rumours, hitherto unconfirmed, that an armed raider was at large in the South Atlantic.  Provided the convoy kept together there was little danger in daytime in that direction, but the possibilities of the raider making a sudden dash during the hours of darkness and using gun and torpedo with disastrous results could not be overlooked.  The issue of lifebelts to the native troops puzzled them greatly.  They could not understand the precaution, for they were ignorant of the danger of making voyages in war-time.  Their faith in the \"big canoes\" of King George was so firm that, sea-sickness notwithstanding, they had no doubts or fears concerning their safe arrival in the land where Briton, Boer, Indian and African were doing their level best to stamp out the blight of German kultur.  At four bells (2 a.m.) on the fifth day of the voyage Wilmshurst was roused from his sleep by a commotion on deck.  Men were running hither and thither carrying out a series of orders shouted in stentorian tones.  The _Zungeru_ was altering course without slackening speed, listing noticeably to starboard as the helm was put hard over.  Almost at the same time Laxdale awoke.  \"What's up?\" he enquired drowsily.  \"I don't know,\" replied his companion.  \"I can hear Spofforth and Danvers going on deck.  Let's see what's doing.\"  Acting upon this suggestion the two officers hastily donned their great coats over their pyjamas, slipped their feet into their canvas slices and went on deck.  It was a calm night.  The crescent moon was low down in the western sky, but its brilliance was sufficient to enable objects to be seen distinctly.  Silhouetted against the slanting beams was the escorting cruiser, which was pelting along at full speed and overhauling the _Zungeru_ hand over fist.  Although the cruiser and her convoy were without steaming lights the former's yard-arm lamp was blinking out a message in Morse.  The transports were in \"double column line ahead,\" steaming due west instead of following the course that would bring them within sight of Table Bay.  Less than a cable's length on the starboard column's beam was the cruiser.  She had already overtaken two of the transports, and was now lapping the _Zungeru's_ quarter.  The object of this nocturnal display of activity was now apparent. Less than a mile away was a large steamer, which had just steadied on her helm and was now on a parallel course to that of the convoy.  \"Anything startling?\" enquired a major of one of the _Zungeru's_ officers who was passing.  \"Oh, no,\" was the reply.  \"A tramp was trying to cut across our bows. The _Tompion_ has signalled to know what's her little game.  She's just replied that she's the steamship _Ponto_, and wants to know whether there have been any signs of a supposed raider.\"  The ship's officer continued on his way.  The two subalterns, in no hurry to return to their bunks, for the night air was warm and fragrant, remained on deck, watching the manoeuvres of the cruiser and the _Ponto_.  The exchange of signals continued for about ten minutes, then the _Tompion_ resumed her station at the head of the convoy, while the _Ponto_ took up her position on the beam of the starboard line. Presently in obedience to a signal the ships altered helm and settled down on their former course, the large steamer following suit, although dropping steadily astern, for her speed was considerably less than that of the transports.  Presently the ship's officer returned.  As he passed Wilmshurst stopped him, enquiring whether anything had developed.  \"The _Ponto_ has cold feet,\" explained the _Zungeru's_ officer.  \"Her Old Man seems to be under the impression that there is a Hun scuttling around, so he's signalled for permission"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26642"],["title","Wilmshurst of the Frontier Force (#3)"],["body"," tail on to us.  The cruiser offered no objection, provided the speed of the convoy is unaffected, so by daylight the tramp will be hull-down, I expect.\"  \"Much ado about nothing,\" remarked Laxdale.  \"I say, old man, let's turn in again.  What's the matter with you?\"  He grasped Wilmshurst by the arm.  The subaltern, apparently heedless of the touch, was gazing fixedly at the tramp.  The mercantile officer and Laxdale both followed the direction of his look, the former giving vent to a low whistle.  From above the gunwale of a boat stowed amidships on the _Ponto_ a feeble light glimmered.  \"Help--German raider,\" it signalled.  \"You read it?\" enquired the sailor hurriedly, as if to confirm the evidence of his own eyes.  \"Yes,\" replied Wilmshurst, and repeated the signal.  Without another word the _Zungeru's_ officer turned and raced to the bridge.  In a few moments the signal was passed on to the _Tompion_ by means of a flashlamp, the rays of which were invisible save from the direction of the receiver.  \"Very good,\" was the cruiser's reply.  \"Carry on.\"  A little later the general order was flashed in to the convoy. \"Increase speed to seventeen knots.\"  The instructions were promptly carried out as far as the transports were concerned, but from the _Ponto_ came a signal: \"Am doing my maximum speed.  Must drop astern if speed of convoy is not reduced.\"  \"The blighter has got hold of the code all right,\" remarked Laxdale. \"We'll wait and see the fun.  Wonder why we are whacking up speed?\"  \"The cruiser wants to get the transports out of harm's way, I should imagine,\" replied Wilmshurst.  \"By Jove, it's rummy how news spreads. The whole mess is coming on deck.\"  The arrival of the colonel and almost all the other officers in various \"fancy rig\" proved the truth of Dudley's remark.  Armed with field glasses, marine-glasses, and telescopes the officers gathered aft, dividing their attention between the labouring _Ponto_ and the greyhound _Tompion_.  In about an hour the tramp had dropped astern to the distance of a little over five miles, but was still maintaining a course parallel to that of the convoy, while the escorting cruiser was still zig-zagging across the bows of the leading transports.  Presently the _Tompion_ turned sharply to starboard, steering westward for quite two miles before she shaped a course exactly opposite to that of the convoy, signalling the while to the _Ponto_, asking various, almost commonplace questions regarding her speed and coal-consumption.  It was merely a ruse to lull suspicion.  With every gun manned and torpedoes launched home the cruiser flung about until she was bows on to the stern of the tramp.  Then came the decided mandate: \"Heave-to and send a boat.\"  Unable to bring more than three guns to bear astern the Hun raider--for such the so-called _Ponto_ was--ported helm, her speed increasing rapidly.  Almost at the same time a six-inch gun sent a shell perilously close to the weather side of the cruiser's fore-bridge.  Before the raider could fire a second time three shells struck her close to the stern-post, literally pulverising the whole of the poop. The after six-inch gun, which had been concealed under a dummy deck-house, was blown from its mountings, the heavy weapon crashing through the shattered decks to the accompaniment of a shower of splinters and a dense pall of flame-tinged smoke.  It was more than the Huns bargained for.  Knowing that the British cruiser was already aware of the presence of a number of prisoners on board the raider counted on the _Tompion_ withholding her fire.  The _Ponto_ would then \"crack on speed,\" for in spite of her alleged maximum of eleven knots she was capable of working up to twenty-eight, or a knot more than the speed of the cruiser under forced draught. These hopes were nipped in the bud by the _Tompion_ blowing away the _Ponto's_ stern and putting both propellers out of action.  Of subsequent events immediately following the brief action Wilmshurst and his brother officers saw little.  Their whole attention was directed towards their men, for the Haussas, on hearing the gun-fire, impetuously made a rush on deck--not by reason of panic but out of the deep curiosity that is ever to the fore in the minds of West African natives to a far greater extent than in the case of Europeans.  Next morning the _Ponto_ was nowhere to be seen.  She had foundered within two hours of the engagement, while two hundred of her officers and crew were prisoners of war on board the _Tompion_, and a hundred and twenty British subjects, mostly the crews of vessels taken and sunk by the raider, found themselves once more under the banner of liberty--the White Ensign.  During the course of the day Wilmshurst heard the salient facts in connection with the raider's career.  She was the Hamburg-Amerika intermediate liner _Porfurst_, who, after being armed and camouflaged, had contrived to escape the cordon of patrol-boats in the North Atlantic.  For three months she had followed her piratical occupation, re-provisioning and re-coaling from the vessels she captured.  Whenever her prisoners grew in number sufficiently to cause inconvenience the _Porfurst_ spared one of her prizes for the purpose of landing the captives in some remote port.  It was by a pure fluke that the raider ran almost blindly under the guns of the _Tompion_.  Under the impression that the convoy consisted of unescorted merchantmen the _Porfurst_ steamed athwart their track, and slowing down to eleven or twelve knots, awaited the arrival of a likely prey.  Finding too late that the convoy was not so impotent as at first appearance the kapitan of the _Porfurst_ attempted a daring ruse.  Upon being challenged by the cruiser he gave the vessel's name as _Ponto_, the real craft having been sunk by the raider only two days previously. The Hun stood a chance of dropping astern and slipping away but for the furtive and timely warning signalled by a young apprentice, who, contriving to creep unobserved into one of the boats, made good use of a small electric torch which he had managed to retain.  Enquiries of the released prisoners resulted in the information that they had been treated by their captors in a far better manner than the Huns generally deal with those unfortunate individuals who fall into their hands.  The kapitan of the _Porfurst_ was no exception to the usual run of Germans.  It was the possibility of capture--which had developed into a certainty--that had influenced him in his treatment of the crews of the sunk ships.  Only the fear of just reprisals kept him within the bounds of civilized warfare, and having behaved in an ostentatiously proper manner towards the prisoners he received in return honourable treatment on board the _Tompion_.  When the convoy was within two days' sail of Table Bay another convoy was sighted steering north, while wireless orders were received for the _Tompion_ to escort the homeward bound ships and let the transports \"carry on\" under the protection of two destroyers sent from Simon's Town.  Upon receipt of these orders the captain of the cruiser signalled the _Zungeru_, asking her to receive on board the released crews of the sunk ships and to land them at Table Bay.  Although wondering why the men should be set ashore at the Cape instead of being taken back to England the master of the transport offered no objection, and preparations were made to tranship the ex-prisoners.  Knowing several officers of the mercantile marine, Wilmshurst strolled into the _Zungeru's_ ship's office and asked the purser's clerk to let him have a look at the list of supernumeraries.  There was a chance that some of his acquaintances might be amongst the released prisoners now on board the transport.  As far as the officers' names were concerned Dudley \"drew blank.\"  He was on the point of handing the type-written list back to the purser's clerk when he noticed a few names written in red ink--three civilians who had been taking passages in ships that had fallen victims to the raider _Porfurst_.  \"MacGregor--Robert; of Umfuli, Rhodesia--that's remarkable,\" thought Wilmshurst.  \"That's the name of Rupert's chum.  Wonder if it's the same man?  There may be dozens of MacGregors in Rhodesia; I'll see if I can get in touch with this MacGregor.\"  That same afternoon the Rhodesian was pointed out to Dudley by the third mate as he strolled into the smoking-room.  Robert MacGregor was a man of about thirty-eight or forty, tall, raw-boned and with curling hair that had a decided auburn hue.  In the absence of any description of Rupert's chum, Dudley had no idea of what he was like, and until he approached this MacGregor his curiosity was not likely to be satisfied.  \"Excuse me,\" began Wilmshurst.  \"I believe your name is Robert MacGregor?\"  The Rhodesian, without showing any surprise at the subaltern's question, merely nodded.  A man who has lived practically alone for years in the wilds is not usually ready with his tongue.  \"Did you ever run across a man called Wilmshurst--Rupert Wilmshurst?\" continued Dudley.  \"He's my brother, you know,\" he added by way of explanation.  \"Yes,\" replied MacGregor slowly.  \"He was a chum of mine.\"     CHAPTER IV  SPOFFORTH, MACGREGOR, AND THE LIONESS  Robert MacGregor pulled a pipe from his pocket and leisurely filled it with Boer tobacco.  His slow, deliberate way contrasted forcibly with Wilmshurst's quick, incisive manner; his slow dialect would have irritated the subaltern beyond measure but for the fact that he guessed the Rhodesian to be of Scots descent.  Dudley noticed particularly that MacGregor had referred to his brother in the past tense.  It sounded ominous.  \"Was a chum?\" he repeated with an accent on the first word.  \"In a sense, yes,\" replied MacGregor.  \"We went for a couple of trips into German East.  The last time was just before the war.  You know why we went?\"  \"It was in connection with a hidden store of ammunition, I believe,\""]]]
