Mr. and Mrs. Perkins did not perhaps wish to be seen in this room, which was for the present only lighted by a couple of candles; but HE was not at all abashed by the circumstance, and grasping them both warmly by the hands, he instantly made himself at home. \"As friends of my dear and talented friend Mick,\" so he is pleased to call me, \"I'm deloighted, madam, to be made known to ye. Don't consider me in the light of a mere acquaintance! As for you, my dear madam, you put me so much in moind of my own blessed mother, now resoiding at Ballymulligan Castle, that I begin to love ye at first soight.\" At which speech Mr. Perkins getting rather alarmed, asked the Mulligan whether he would take some wine, or go up stairs.  \"Faix,\" says Mulligan \"it's never too soon for good dhrink.\" And (although he smelt very much of whiskey already) he drank a tumbler of wine \"to the improvement of an acqueentence which comminces in a manner so deloightful.\"  \"Let's go up stairs, Mulligan,\" says I, and led the noble Irishman to the upper apartments, which were in a profound gloom, the candles not being yet illuminated, and where we surprised Miss Fanny, seated in the twilight at the piano, timidly trying the tunes of the polka which she danced so exquisitely that evening. She did not perceive the stranger at first; but how she started when the Mulligan loomed upon her.  \"Heavenlee enchanthress!\" says Mulligan, \"don't floy at the approach of the humblest of your sleeves! Reshewm your pleece at that insthrument, which weeps harmonious, or smoils melojious, as you charrum it! Are you acqueented with the Oirish Melodies? Can ye play, 'Who fears to talk of Nointy-eight?' the 'Shan Van Voght?' or the 'Dirge of Ollam Fodhlah?'\"  \"Who's this mad chap that Titmarsh has brought?\" I heard Master Bacon exclaim to Master Perkins. \"Look! how frightened Fanny looks!\"  \"O poo! gals are ALWAYS frightened,\" Fanny's brother replied; but Giles Bacon, more violent, said, \"I'll tell you what, Tom: if this goes on, we must pitch into him.\" And so I have no doubt they would, when another thundering knock coming, Gregory rushed into the room and began lighting all the candles, so as to produce an amazing brilliancy, Miss Fanny sprang up and ran to her mamma, and the young gentlemen slid down the banisters to receive the company in the hall.   EVERYBODY BEGINS TO COME, BUT ESPECIALLY MR. MINCHIN.   \"It's only me and my sisters,\" Master Bacon said; though \"only\" meant eight in this instance. All the young ladies had fresh cheeks and purple elbows; all had white frocks, with hair more or less auburn: and so a party was already made of this blooming and numerous family, before the rest of the company began to arrive. The three Miss Meggots next came in their fly: Mr. Blades and his niece from 19 in the square: Captain and Mrs. Struther, and Miss Struther: Doctor Toddy's two daughters and their mamma: but where were the gentlemen? The Mulligan, great and active as he was, could not suffice among so many beauties. At last came a brisk neat little knock, and looking into the hall, I saw a gentleman taking off his clogs there, whilst Sir Giles Bacon's big footman was looking on with rather a contemptuous air.  \"What name shall I enounce?\" says he, with a wink at Gregory on the stair.  The gentleman in clogs said, with quiet dignity,--   MR. FREDERICK MINCHIN.   \"Pump Court, Temple,\" is printed on his cards in very small type: and he is a rising barrister of the Western Circuit. He is to be found at home of mornings: afterwards \"at Westminster,\" as you read on his back door. \"Binks and Minchin's Reports\" are probably known to my legal friends: this is the Minchin in question.  He is decidedly genteel, and is rather in request at the balls of the Judges' and Serjeants' ladies: for he dances irreproachably, and goes out to dinner as much as ever he can.  He mostly dines at the Oxford and Cambridge Club, of which you can easily see by his appearance that he is a member; he takes the joint and his half-pint of wine, for Minchin does everything like a gentleman. He is rather of a literary turn; still makes Latin verses with some neatness; and before he was called, was remarkably fond of the flute.  When Mr. Minchin goes out in the evening, his clerk brings his bag to the Club, to dress; and if it is at all muddy, he turns up his trousers, so that he may come in without a speck. For such a party as this, he will have new gloves; otherwise Frederick, his clerk, is chiefly employed in cleaning them with India-rubber.  He has a number of pleasant stories about the Circuit and the University, which he tells with a simper to his neighbor at dinner; and has always the last joke of Mr. Baron Maule. He has a private fortune of five thousand pounds; he is a dutiful son; he has a sister married, in Harley Street; and Lady Jane Ranville has the best opinion of him, and says he is a most excellent and highly principled young man.  Her ladyship and daughter arrived just as Mr. Minchin had popped his clogs into the umbrella-stand; and the rank of that respected person, and the dignified manner in which he led her up stairs, caused all sneering on the part of the domestics to disappear.   THE BALL-ROOM DOOR.   A hundred of knocks follow Frederick Minchin's: in half an hour Messrs. Spoff, Pinch, and Clapperton have begun their music, and Mulligan, with one of the Miss Bacons, is dancing majestically in the first quadrille. My young friends Giles and Tom prefer the landing-place to the drawing-rooms, where they stop all night, robbing the refreshment-trays as they come up or down. Giles has eaten fourteen ices: he will have a dreadful stomach-ache to-morrow. Tom has eaten twelve, but he has had four more glasses of negus than Giles. Grundsell, the occasional waiter, from whom Master Tom buys quantities of ginger-beer, can of course deny him nothing. That is Grundsell, in the tights, with the tray. Meanwhile direct your attention to the three gentlemen at the door: they are conversing.  1st Gent.--Who's the man of the house--the bald man?  2nd Gent.--Of course. The man of the house is always bald. He's a stockbroker, I believe. Snooks brought me.  1st Gent.--Have you been to the tea-room? There's a pretty girl in the tea-room; blue eyes, pink ribbons, that kind of thing.  2nd Gent.--Who the deuce is that girl with those tremendous shoulders? Gad! I do wish somebody would smack 'em.  3rd Gent.--Sir--that young lady is my niece, sir,--my niece--my name is Blades, sir.  2nd Gent.--Well, Blades! smack your niece's shoulders: she deserves it, begad! she does. Come in, Jinks, present me to the Perkinses.--Hullo! here's an old country acquaintance--Lady Bacon, as I live! with all the piglings; she never goes out without the whole litter. (Exeunt 1st and 2nd Gents.)   LADY BACON, THE MISS BACONS, MR. FLAM.   Lady B.--Leonora! Maria! Amelia! here is the gentleman we met at Sir John Porkington's.  [The MISSES BACON, expecting to be asked to dance, smile simultaneously, and begin to smooth their tuckers.]  Mr. Flam.--Lady Bacon! I couldn't be mistaken in YOU! Won't you dance, Lady Bacon?  Lady B.--Go away, you droll creature!  Mr. Flam.--And these are your ladyship's seven lovely sisters, to judge from their likenesses to the charming Lady Bacon?  Lady B.--My sisters, he! he! my DAUGHTERS, Mr. Flam, and THEY dance, don't you, girls?  The Misses Bacon.--O yes!  Mr. Flam.--Gad! how I wish I was a dancing man!  [Exit FLAM.   MR. LARKINS.   I have not been able to do justice (only a Lawrence could do that) to my respected friend Mrs. Perkins, in this picture; but Larkins's portrait is considered very like. Adolphus Larkins has been long connected with Mr. Perkins's City establishment, and is asked to dine twice or thrice per annum. Evening-parties are the great enjoyment of this simple youth, who, after he has walked from Kentish Town to Thames Street, and passed twelve hours in severe labor there, and walked back again to Kentish Town, finds no greater pleasure than to attire his lean person in that elegant evening costume which you see, to walk into town again, and to dance at anybody's house who will invite him. Islington, Pentonville, Somers Town, are the scenes of many of his exploits; and I have seen this good-natured fellow performing figure-dances at Notting-hill, at a house where I am ashamed to say there was no supper, no negus even to speak of, nothing but the bare merits of the polka in which Adolphus revels. To describe this gentleman's infatuation for dancing, let me say, in a word, that he will even frequent boarding-house hops, rather than not go.  He has clogs, too, like Minchin: but nobody laughs at HIM. He gives himself no airs; but walks into a house with a knock and a demeanor so tremulous and humble, that the servants rather patronize him. He does not speak, or have any particular opinions, but when the time comes, begins to dance. He bleats out a word or two to his partner during this operation, seems very weak and sad during the whole performance, and, of course, is set to dance with the ugliest women everywhere.  The gentle, kind spirit! when I think of him night after night, hopping and jigging, and trudging off to Kentish Town, so gently, through the fogs, and mud, and darkness: I do not know whether I ought to admire him, because his enjoyments are so simple, and his dispositions so kindly; or laugh at him, because he draws his life so exquisitely mild. Well, well, we can't be all roaring lions in this world; there must be SOME lambs, and harmless, kindly, gregarious creatures for eating and shearing. See! even good-natured Mrs. Perkins is leading up the trembling Larkins to the tremendous Miss Bunion! "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2731"],["title","The Christmas Books of Mr. M.A. Titmarsh (#2)"],["body","  MISS BUNION.   The Poetess, author of \"Heartstrings,\" \"The Deadly Nightshade,\" \"Passion Flowers,\" &c. Though her poems breathe only of love, Miss B. has never been married. She is nearly six feet high; she loves waltzing beyond even poesy; and I think lobster-salad as much as either. She confesses to twenty-eight; in which case her first volume, \"The Orphan of Gozo,\" (cut up by Mr. Rigby, in the Quarterly, with his usual kindness,) must have been published when she was three years old.  For a woman all soul, she certainly eats as much as any woman I ever saw. The sufferings she has had to endure, are, she says, beyond compare; the poems which she writes breathe a withering passion, a smouldering despair, an agony of spirit that would melt the soul of a drayman, were he to read them. Well, it is a comfort to see that she can dance of nights, and to know (for the habits of illustrious literary persons are always worth knowing) that she eats a hot mutton-chop for breakfast every morning of her blighted existence.  She lives in a boardinghouse at Brompton, and comes to the party in a fly.   MR. HICKS.   It is worth twopence to see Miss Bunion and Poseidon Hicks, the great poet, conversing with one another, and to talk of one to the other afterwards. How they hate each other! I (in my wicked way) have sent Hicks almost raving mad, by praising Bunion to him in confidence; and you can drive Bunion out of the room by a few judicious panegyrics of Hicks.  Hicks first burst upon the astonished world with poems, in the Byronic manner: \"The Death-Shriek,\" \"The Bastard of Lara,\" \"The Atabal,\" \"The Fire-Ship of Botzaris,\" and other works. His \"Love Lays,\" in Mr. Moore's early style, were pronounced to be wonderfully precocious for a young gentleman then only thirteen, and in a commercial academy, at Tooting.  Subsequently, this great bard became less passionate and more thoughtful; and, at the age of twenty, wrote \"Idiosyncracy\" (in forty books, 4to.): \"Ararat,\" \"a stupendous epic,\" as the reviews said; and \"The Megatheria,\" \"a magnificent contribution to our pre-Adamite literature,\" according to the same authorities. Not having read these works, it would ill become me to judge them; but I know that poor Jingle, the publisher, always attributed his insolvency to the latter epic, which was magnificently printed in elephant folio.  Hicks has now taken a classical turn, and has brought out \"Poseidon,\" \"Iacchus,\" \"Hephaestus,\" and I dare say is going through the mythology. But I should not like to try him at a passage of the Greek Delectus, any more than twenty thousand others of us who have had a \"classical education.\"  Hicks was taken in an inspired attitude regarding the chandelier, and pretending he didn't know that Miss Pettifer was looking at him.  Her name is Anna Maria (daughter of Higgs and Pettifer, solicitors, Bedford Row); but Hicks calls her \"Ianthe\" in his album verses, and is himself an eminent drysalter in the city.   MISS MEGGOT.   Poor Miss Meggot is not so lucky as Miss Bunion. Nobody comes to dance with HER, though she has a new frock on, as she calls it, and rather a pretty foot, which she always manages to stick out.  She is forty-seven, the youngest of three sisters, who live a mouldy old house, near Middlesex Hospital, where they have lived for I don't know how many score of years; but this is certain: the eldest Miss Meggot saw the Gordon Riots out of that same parlor window, and tells the story how her father (physician to George III.) was robbed of his queue in the streets on that occasion. The two old ladies have taken the brevet rank, and are addressed as Mrs. Jane and Mrs. Betsy: one of them is at whist in the back drawing-room. But the youngest is still called Miss Nancy, and is considered quite a baby by her sisters.  She was going to be married once to a brave young officer, Ensign Angus Macquirk, of the Whistlebinkie Fencibles; but he fell at Quatre Bras, by the side of the gallant Snuffmull, his commander. Deeply, deeply did Miss Nancy deplore him.  But time has cicatrized the wounded heart. She is gay now, and would sing or dance, ay, or marry if anybody asked her.  Do go, my dear friend--I don't mean to ask her to marry, but to ask her to dance.--Never mind the looks of the thing. It will make her happy; and what does it cost you? Ah, my dear fellow! take this counsel: always dance with the old ladies--always dance with the governesses. It is a comfort to the poor things when they get up in their garret that somebody has had mercy on them. And such a handsome fellow as YOU too!   MISS RANVILLE, REV. MR. TOOP, MISS MULLINS, MR. WINTER.   Mr. W. Miss Mullins, look at Miss Ranville: what a picture of good humor.  Miss M.--Oh, you satirical creature!  Mr. W.--Do you know why she is so angry? she expected to dance with Captain Grig, and by some mistake, the Cambridge Professor got hold of her: isn't he a handsome man?  Miss M.--Oh, you droll wretch!  Mr. W.--Yes, he's a fellow of college--fellows mayn't marry, Miss Mullins--poor fellows, ay, Miss Mullins?  Miss M.--La!  Mr. W.--And Professor of Phlebotomy in the University. He flatters himself he is a man of the world, Miss Mullins, and always dances in the long vacation.  Miss M.--You malicious, wicked monster!  Mr. W.--Do you know Lady Jane Ranville? Miss Ranville's mamma. A ball once a year; footmen in canary-colored livery: Baker Street; six dinners in the season; starves all the year round; pride and poverty, you know; I've been to her ball ONCE. Ranville Ranville's her brother, and between you and me--but this, dear Miss Mullins, is a profound secret,--I think he's a greater fool than his sister.  Miss M.--Oh, you satirical, droll, malicious, wicked thing you!  Mr. W.--You do me injustice, Miss Mullins, indeed you do.  [Chaine Anglaise.]   MISS JOY, MR. AND MRS. JOY, MR. BOTTER.   Mr. B.--What spirits that girl has, Mrs. Joy!  Mr. J.--She's a sunshine in a house, Botter, a regular sunshine. When Mrs. J. here's in a bad humor, I . . .  Mrs. J.--Don't talk nonsense, Mr. Joy.  Mrs. B.--There's a hop, skip, and jump for you! Why, it beats Ellsler! Upon my conscience it does! It's her fourteenth quadrille too. There she goes! She's a jewel of a girl, though I say it that shouldn't.  Mrs. J. (laughing).--Why don't you marry her, Botter? Shall I speak to her? I dare say she'd have you. You're not so VERY old.  Mr. B.--Don't aggravate me, Mrs. J. You know when I lost my heart in the year 1817, at the opening of Waterloo Bridge, to a young lady who wouldn't have me, and left me to die in despair, and married Joy, of the Stock Exchange.  Mrs. J. Get away, you foolish old creature.  [MR. JOY looks on in ecstasies at Miss Joy's agility. LADY JANE RANVILLE, of Baker Street, pronounces her to be an exceedingly forward person. CAPTAIN DOBBS likes a girl who has plenty of go in her; and as for FRED SPARKS, he is over head and ears in love with her.]   MR. RANVILLE RANVILLE AND JACK HUBBARD.   This is Miss Ranville Ranville's brother, Mr. Ranville Ranville, of the Foreign Office, faithfully designed as he was playing at whist in the card-room. Talleyrand used to play at whist at the \"Travellers',\" that is why Ranville Ranville indulges in that diplomatic recreation. It is not his fault if he be not the greatest man in the room.  If you speak to him, he smiles sternly, and answers in monosyllables he would rather die than commit himself. He never has committed himself in his life. He was the first at school, and distinguished at Oxford. He is growing prematurely bald now, like Canning, and is quite proud of it. He rides in St. James's Park of a morning before breakfast. He dockets his tailor's bills, and nicks off his dinner-notes in diplomatic paragraphs, and keeps precis of them all. If he ever makes a joke, it is a quotation from Horace, like Sir Robert Peel. The only relaxation he permits himself, is to read Thucydides in the holidays.  Everybody asks him out to dinner, on account of his brass-buttons with the Queen's cipher, and to have the air of being well with the Foreign Office. \"Where I dine,\" he says solemnly, \"I think it is my duty to go to evening-parties.\" That is why he is here. He never dances, never sups, never drinks. He has gruel when he goes home to bed. I think it is in his brains.  He is such an ass and so respectable, that one wonders he has not succeeded in the world; and yet somehow they laugh at him; and you and I shall be Ministers as soon as he will.  Yonder, making believe to look over the print-books, is that merry rogue, Jack Hubbard.  See how jovial he looks! He is the life and soul of every party, and his impromptu singing after supper will make you die of laughing. He is meditating an impromptu now, and at the same time thinking about a bill that is coming due next Thursday. Happy dog!   MRS. TROTTER, MISS TROTTER, MISS TOADY, LORD METHUSELAH.   Dear Emma Trotter has been silent and rather ill-humored all the evening until now her pretty face lights up with smiles. Cannot you guess why? Pity the simple and affectionate creature! Lord Methuselah has not arrived until this moment: and see how the artless girl steps forward to greet him!  In the midst of all the selfishness and turmoil of the world, how charming it is to find virgin hearts quite unsullied, and to look on at little romantic pictures of mutual love! Lord Methuselah, though you know his age by the peerage--though he is old, wigged, gouty, rouged, wicked, has lighted up a pure flame in that gentle bosom. There was a talk about Tom Willoughby last year; and then, for a time, young Hawbuck (Sir John Hawbuck's youngest son) seemed the favored man; but Emma never knew her mind until she met the dear creature before you in a Rhine steamboat. \"Why are you so late, Edward?\" says she. Dear artless child!  Her mother looks on with tender satisfaction. One can appreciate the joys of such an admirable parent!  \"Look at them!\" says Miss Toady. \"I vow and protest they're"]]]
