I read more in those comanalyses than you did. I even know who you are!\"  Zarwell's eyebrows raised.  \"Who am I?\" he asked, very interested now. Without attention he put his pistol away in a trouser pocket.  Bergstrom brushed the question aside with one hand. \"Your name makes little difference. You've used many. But you are an idealist. Your killings were necessary to bring justice to the places you visited. By now you're almost a legend among the human worlds. I'd like to talk more with you on that later.\"  While Zarwell considered, Bergstrom pressed his advantage. \"One more scene might do it,\" he said. \"Should we try again--if you trust me, that is?\"  Zarwell made his decision quickly. \"Go ahead,\" he answered.   All Zarwell's attention seemed on the cigar he lit as he rode down the escalator, but he surveyed the terminal carefully over the rim of his hand. He spied no suspicious loungers.  Behind the escalator he groped along the floor beneath the lockers until he found his key. The briefcase was under his arm a minute later.  In the basement lave he put a coin in the pay slot of a private compartment and went in.  As he zipped open the briefcase he surveyed his features in the mirror. A small muscle at the corner of one eye twitched spasmodically. One cheek wore a frozen quarter smile. Thirty-six hours under the paralysis was longer than advisable. The muscles should be rested at least every twenty hours.  Fortunately his natural features would serve as an adequate disguise now.  He adjusted the ring setting on the pistol-shaped instrument that he took from his case, and carefully rayed several small areas of his face, loosening muscles that had been tight too long. He sighed gratefully when he finished, massaging his cheeks and forehead with considerable pleasure. Another glance in the mirror satisfied him with the changes that had been made. He turned to his briefcase again and exchanged the gun for a small syringe, which he pushed into a trouser pocket, and a single-edged razor blade.  Removing his fiber-cloth jacket he slashed it into strips with the razor blade and flushed it down the disposal bowl. With the sleeves of his blouse rolled up he had the appearance of a typical workman as he strolled from the compartment.  Back at the locker he replaced the briefcase and, with a wad of gum, glued the key to the bottom of the locker frame.  One step more. Taking the syringe from his pocket, he plunged the needle into his forearm and tossed the instrument down a waste chute. He took three more steps and paused uncertainly.  When he looked about him it was with the expression of a man waking from a vivid dream.   \"Quite ingenious,\" Graves murmured admiringly. \"You had your mind already preconditioned for the shot. But why would you deliberately give yourself amnesia?\"  \"What better disguise than to believe the part you're playing?\"  \"A good man must have done that job on your mind,\" Bergstrom commented. \"I'd have hesitated to try it myself. It must have taken a lot of trust on your part.\"  \"Trust and money,\" Zarwell said drily.  \"Your memory's back then?\"  Zarwell nodded.  \"I'm glad to hear that,\" Bergstrom assured him. \"Now that you're well again I'd like to introduce you to a man named Vernon Johnson. This world ...\"  Zarwell stopped him with an upraised hand. \"Good God, man, can't you see the reason for all this? I'm tired. I'm trying to quit.\"  \"Quit?\" Bergstrom did not quite follow him.  \"It started on my home colony,\" Zarwell explained listlessly. \"A gang of hoods had taken over the government. I helped organize a movement to get them out. There was some bloodshed, but it went quite well. Several months later an unofficial envoy from another world asked several of us to give them a hand on the same kind of job. The political conditions there were rotten. We went with him. Again we were successful. It seems I have a kind of genius for that sort of thing.\"  He stretched out his legs and regarded them thoughtfully. \"I learned then the truth of Russell's saying: 'When the oppressed win their freedom they are as oppressive as their former masters.' When they went bad, I opposed them. This time I failed. But I escaped again. I have quite a talent for that also.  \"I'm not a professional do-gooder.\" Zarwell's tone appealed to Bergstrom for understanding. \"I have only a normal man's indignation at injustice. And now I've done my share. Yet, wherever I go, the word eventually gets out, and I'm right back in a fight again. It's like the proverbial monkey on my back. I can't get rid of it.\"  He rose. \"That disguise and memory planting were supposed to get me out of it. I should have known it wouldn't work. But this time I'm not going to be drawn back in! You and your Vernon Johnson can do your own revolting. I'm through!\"  Bergstrom did not argue as he left.   Restlessness drove Zarwell from his flat the next day--a legal holiday on St. Martin's. At a railed-off lot he stopped and loitered in the shadow of an adjacent building watching workmen drilling an excavation for a new structure.  When a man strolled to his side and stood watching the workmen, he was not surprised. He waited for the other to speak.  \"I'd like to talk to you, if you can spare a few minutes,\" the stranger said.  Zarwell turned and studied the man without answering. He was medium tall, with the body of an athlete, though perhaps ten years beyond the age of sports. He had a manner of contained energy. \"You're Johnson?\" he asked.  The man nodded.  Zarwell tried to feel the anger he wanted to feel, but somehow it would not come. \"We have nothing to talk about,\" was the best he could manage.  \"Then will you just listen? After, I'll leave--if you tell me to.\"  Against his will he found himself liking the man, and wanting at least to be courteous. He inclined his head toward a curb wastebox with a flat top. \"Should we sit?\"  Johnson smiled agreeably and they walked over to the box and sat down.  \"When this colony was first founded,\" Johnson began without preamble, \"the administrative body was a governor, and a council of twelve. Their successors were to be elected biennially. At first they were. Then things changed. We haven't had an election now in the last twenty-three years. St. Martin's is beginning to prosper. Yet the only ones receiving the benefits are the rulers. The citizens work twelve hours a day. They are poorly housed, poorly fed, poorly clothed. They ...\"  Zarwell found himself not listening as Johnson's voice went on. The story was always the same. But why did they always try to drag him into their troubles?  Why hadn't he chosen some other world on which to hide?  The last question prompted a new thought. Just why had he chosen St. Martin's? Was it only a coincidence? Or had he, subconsciously at least, picked this particular world? He had always considered himself the unwilling subject of glib persuaders ... but mightn't some inner compulsion of his own have put the monkey on his back?  \"... and we need your help.\" Johnson had finished his speech.  Zarwell gazed up at the bright sky. He pulled in a long breath, and let it out in a sigh.  \"What are your plans so far?\" he asked wearily.     --CHARLES V.

SPRINGFIELD, June 19, 1858.  SYDNEY SPRING, Esq.  MY DEAR SIR:--Your letter introducing Mr. Faree was duly received. There was no opening to nominate him for Superintendent of Public Instruction, but through him Egypt made a most valuable contribution to the convention. I think it may be fairly said that he came off the lion of the day--or rather of the night. Can you not elect him to the Legislature? It seems to me he would be hard to beat. What objection could be made to him? What is your Senator Martin saying and doing? What is Webb about?  Please write me. Yours truly,  A. LINCOLN.     TO H. C. WHITNEY.  SPRINGFIELD, June 24, 1858  H. C. WHITNEY, ESQ.  DEAR SIR:--Your letter enclosing the attack of the Times upon me was received this morning. Give yourself no concern about my voting against the supplies. Unless you are without faith that a lie can be successfully contradicted, there is not a word of truth in the charge, and I am just considering a little as to the best shape to put a contradiction in. Show this to whomever you please, but do not publish it in the paper.  Your friend as ever,  A. LINCOLN.     TO J. W. SOMERS.  SPRINGFIELD, June 25, 1858.  JAMES W. SOMERS, Esq.  MY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 22nd, inclosing a draft of two hundred dollars, was duly received. I have paid it on the judgment, and herewith you have the receipt. I do not wish to say anything as to who shall be the Republican candidate for the Legislature in your district, further than that I have full confidence in Dr. Hull. Have you ever got in the way of consulting with McKinley in political matters? He is true as steel, and his judgment is very good. The last I heard from him, he rather thought Weldon, of De Witt, was our best timber for representative, all things considered. But you there must settle it among yourselves. It may well puzzle older heads than yours to understand how, as the Dred Scott decision holds, Congress can authorize a Territorial Legislature to do everything else, and cannot authorize them to prohibit slavery. That is one of the things the court can decide, but can never give an intelligible reason for.  Yours very truly,  A. LINCOLN.     TO A. CAMPBELL.  SPRINGFIELD, June 28, 1858.  A. CAMPBELL, Esq.  MY DEAR SIR:--In 1856 you gave me authority to draw on you for any sum not exceeding five hundred dollars. I see clearly that such a privilege would be more available now than it was then. I am aware that times are tighter now than they were then. Please write me at all events, and whether you can now do anything or not I shall continue grateful for the past.  Yours very truly,   A. LINCOLN.     TO J. GILLESPIE.  SPRINGFIELD, July 16, 1858.  HON. JOSEPH GILLESPIE.  MY DEAR SIR:--I write this to say that from the specimens of Douglas Democracy we occasionally see here from Madison, we learn that they are making very confident calculation of beating you and your friends for the lower house, in that county. They offer to bet upon it. Billings and Job, respectively, have been up here, and were each as I learn, talking largely about it. If they do so, it can only be done by carrying the Fillmore men of 1856 very differently from what they seem to [be] going in the other party. Below is the vote of 1856, in your district:  Counties.       Counties.  Buchanan.   Fremont.   Fillmore.    Bond............ 607      153      659    Madison......... 1451     1111     1658    Montgomery...... 992      162      686                      ----     ----     ----                      3050     1426     3003  By this you will see, if you go through the calculation, that if they get one quarter of the Fillmore votes, and you three quarters, they will beat you 125 votes. If they get one fifth, and you four fifths, you beat them 179. In Madison, alone, if our friends get 1000 of the Fillmore votes, and their opponents the remainder, 658, we win by just two votes.  This shows the whole field, on the basis of the election of 1856.  Whether, since then, any Buchanan, or Fremonters, have shifted ground, and how the majority of new votes will go, you can judge better than I.  Of course you, on the ground, can better determine your line of tactics than any one off the ground; but it behooves you to be wide awake and actively working.  Don't neglect it; and write me at your first leisure. Yours as ever,   A. LINCOLN.     TO JOHN MATHERS, JACKSONVILLE, ILL.  SPRINGFIELD, JULY 20, 1858.  JNO. MATHERS, Esq.  MY DEAR SIR:--Your kind and interesting letter of the 19th was duly received. Your suggestions as to placing one's self on the offensive rather than the defensive are certainly correct. That is a point which I shall not disregard. I spoke here on Saturday night. The speech, not very well reported, appears in the State journal of this morning. You doubtless will see it; and I hope that you will perceive in it that I am already improving. I would mail you a copy now, but have not one [at] hand. I thank you for your letter and shall be pleased to hear from you again.  Yours very truly,   A. LINCOLN.     TO JOSEPH GILLESPIE.  SPRINGFIELD, JULY 25, 1858.  HON. J. GILLESPIE.  MY DEAR SIR:--Your doleful letter of the 8th was received on my return from Chicago last night. I do hope you are worse scared than hurt, though you ought to know best. We must not lose the district. We must make a job of it, and save it. Lay hold of the proper agencies, and secure all the Americans you can, at once. I do hope, on closer inspection, you will find they are not half gone. Make a little test. Run down one of the poll-books of the Edwardsville precinct, and take the first hundred known American names. Then quietly ascertain how many of them are actually going for Douglas. I think you will find less than fifty. But even if you find fifty, make sure of the other fifty, that is, make sure of all you can, at all events. We will set other agencies to work which shall compensate for the loss of a good many Americans. Don't fail to check the stampede at once. Trumbull, I think, will be with you before long.  There is much he cannot do, and some he can. I have reason to hope there will be other help of an appropriate kind. Write me again.  Yours as ever,   A. LINCOLN.     TO B. C. COOK.  SPRINGFIELD, Aug. 2, 1858.  Hon. B. C. COOK.  MY DEAR SIR:--I have a letter from a very true and intelligent man insisting that there is a plan on foot in La Salle and Bureau to run Douglas Republicans for Congress and for the Legislature in those counties, if they can only get the encouragement of our folks nominating pretty extreme abolitionists.  It is thought they will do nothing if our folks nominate men who are not very obnoxious to the charge of abolitionism. Please have your eye upon this. Signs are looking pretty fair.  Yours very truly,   A. LINCOLN.     TO HON. J. M. PALMER.  SPRINGFIELD, Aug. 5, 1858.  HON. J. M. PALMER.  DEAR SIR:--Since we parted last evening no new thought has occurred to [me] on the subject of which we talked most yesterday.  I have concluded, however, to speak at your town on Tuesday, August 31st, and have promised to have it so appear in the papers of to-morrow. Judge Trumbull has not yet reached here.  Yours as ever,   A. LINCOLN.     TO ALEXANDER SYMPSON.  SPRINGFIELD, Aug. 11, 1858.  ALEXANDER SYMPSON, Esq.  DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 6th received. If life and health continue I shall pretty likely be at Augusta on the 25th.  Things look reasonably well. Will tell you more fully when I see you.  Yours truly,   A. LINCOLN.     TO J. O. CUNNINGHAM.  OTTAWA, August 22, 1858.  J. O. CUNNINGHAM, Esq.  MY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 18th, signed as secretary of the Republican club, is received. In the matter of making speeches I am a good deal pressed by invitations from almost all quarters, and while I hope to be at Urbana some time during the canvass, I cannot yet say when. Can you not see me at Monticello on the 6th of September?  Douglas and I, for the first time this canvass, crossed swords here yesterday; the fire flew some, and I am glad to know I am yet alive. There was a vast concourse of people--more than could get near enough to hear.  Yours as ever,   A. LINCOLN.     ON SLAVERY IN A DEMOCRACY.  August??, 1858  As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy.   A. LINCOLN.     TO B. C. COOK.  SPRINGFIELD, August 2, 1858  HON. B. C. COOK.  MY DEAR SIR:--I have a letter from a very true friend, and intelligent man, writing that there is a plan on foot in La Salle and Bureau, to run Douglas Republican for Congress and for the Legislature in those counties, if they can only get the encouragement of our folks nominating pretty extreme abolitionists. It is thought they will do nothing if our folks nominate men who are not very [undecipherable word looks like \"obnoxious\"] to the charge of abolitionism. Please have your eye upon this. Signs are looking pretty fair.  Yours very truly,   A. LINCOLN.     TO DR. WILLIAM FITHIAN, DANVILLE, ILL.  BLOOMINGTON, Sept. 3, 1858  DEAR DOCTOR:--Yours of the 1st was received this morning, as also one from Mr. Harmon, and one from Hiram Beckwith on the same subject. You will see by the Journal that I have been appointed to speak at Danville on the 22d of Sept.,--the day after Douglas speaks there. My recent experience shows that speaking at the same place the next day after D. is the very thing,--it is, in fact, a concluding speech on him. Please show this to Messrs. Harmon and Beckwith; and tell them they must excuse me from writing separate letters to them.  Yours as ever,   A. LINCOLN  P. S.--Give full notice to all surrounding country. A.L.
