In 1828 he had contemplated writing an article on music for the _London Review_, along with one on poetry. The latter, in the event, alone saw the day; the former \"seems to have remained an idea only.\"[40] He is apologetic in the _Idea of a University_, when about to descant so eloquently upon music: \"If I may speak,\" he says, \"of matters which seem to lie beyond my own province;\"[41] but in very early Oratory days at Edgbaston, he essayed some lectures on music to some of the community in the practice-room. And at the opening of the new organ there in August, 1877, he \"preached a most beautiful discourse [taken down at the time], upon the event of the day; and on music, first as a great natural gift, then as an instrument in the hands of the Church; its special prominence in the history of St. Philip and the Oratory; the part played by music in the history of God's dealings with man from first to last, from the thunders of Mount Sinai to the trumpets of the Judgment; the mysterious and intimate connection with the unseen world established by music, as it were the unknown language of another state. Its quasi-sacramental efficacy, _e.g._, in driving away the evil spirit in Saul and in bringing upon Eliseus the spirit of prophecy; the grand pre-eminence of the organ in that it gave the nearest representation of the voice of God, while the sound of strings might be taken as more fitted to express the varying emotions of man's state here on earth.\"[42]  [Footnote 40: _Essays_, i. Fifth Edit. 1881; Mozley, _Corr._ i. 194.]  [Footnote 41: _Idea_, dis. iv. 80.]  [Footnote 42: _Tablet_, 25 Aug. 1877.]  At Oxford, in his time, he said, there were none of the facilities for music that now form part of the institutions of the place; there was little to encourage individual musical talent. At St. Clement's we only learn, \"I had a dispute with my singers in May, which ended in their leaving the church, and we now sing _en masse_,\"[43] and in June still, \"My singers are quite mute.\"[44] At St. Mary's, Mr. Bennett, who was killed on his way to Worcester Festival by the upsetting of a coach,[45] and after him Mr. Elvey, elder brother of Sir George Elvey, sometime organist at St. George's Chapel, Windsor, were Mr. Newman's organists. \"I shall never forget,\" writes a hearer, \"the charm it was to hear Elvey play the organ for the hymn at Newman's afternoon parochial service at St. Mary's on a Sunday. The method was to play the tune completely through on the organ before the voices took it up, and the way he did it was simply perfect.\"  [Footnote 43: Mozley, _Corr._ i. 97.]  [Footnote 44: _Ibid._]  [Footnote 45: \"There is a chant of his composing,\" writes a friend, \"which was reckoned at the time a stroke of genius--quite a new idea. I have it in a Collection made by his father, who was organist of Chichester Cathedral,\" and Bennett's elder brother \"was my master at Chichester in 1842. He used to speak of his brother's genius, and what a loss he was to music.\"]  Still the Anglican service, taken as a whole, was scarcely then calculated to stir artistic fervour, and this listener, so delighted with Elvey at St. Mary's, went home to his village parish church only to hear the hymn murdered, or if it were Advent, Christmas, or Easter, a tradesman shout from the gallery, \"We will now sing to the praise and glory of God a _h_anthem!\" when a motet would be sacrificed to incompetency with every circumstance of barbarity attending the execution. Mr. Newman in language of appalling force, written a year after his conversion, has described the Anglican service as \"a ritual dashed upon the ground, trodden on, and broken piecemeal; prayers clipped, pieced, torn, shuffled about at pleasure, until the meaning of the composition perished, and offices which had been poetry were no longer even good prose; antiphons, hymns, benedictions, invocations, shovelled away; Scripture lessons turned into chapters; heaviness, feebleness, unwieldiness, where the Catholic rites had had the lightness and airiness of a spirit; vestments chucked off, lights quenched, jewels stolen, the pomp and circumstances of worship annihilated; a dreariness which could be felt, and which seemed the token of an incipient Socinianism, forcing itself upon the eye, the ear, the nostrils of the worshipper; a smell of dust and damp, not of incense; a sound of ministers preaching Catholic prayers, and parish clerks droning out Catholic canticles; the royal arms for the crucifix; huge ugly boxes of wood, sacred to preachers, frowning on the congregation in the place of the mysterious altar; and long cathedral aisles unused, railed off, like the tombs (as they were) of what had been and was not; and for orthodoxy, a frigid, unelastic, inconsistent, dull, helpless dogmatic, which could give no just account of itself, yet was intolerant of all teaching which contained a doctrine more or a doctrine less, and resented every attempt to give it a meaning.\"[46] The Catholic Church's ritual he found very different.  [Footnote 46: _Essays_, ii. pp. 443, 444.]  \"What are her ordinances and practices,\" he asks, \"but the regulated expression of keen, or deep, or turbid feeling, and thus a 'cleansing' as Aristotle would word it, of the sick soul? She is the poet of her children; full of music to soothe the sad, and control the wayward--wonderful in story for the imagination of the romantic; rich in symbol and imagery, so that gentle and delicate feelings, which will not bear words, may in silence intimate their presence, or commune with themselves. Her very being is poetry; every psalm, every petition, every collect, every versicle, the cross, the mitre, the thurible, is a fulfillment of some dream of childhood, or aspiration of youth. Such poets as are born under her shadow, she takes into her service, she sets them to write hymns, or to compose chants, or to embellish shrines, or to determine ceremonies, or to marshal processions; nay, she can even make schoolmen of them, as she made St. Thomas, till logic becomes poetical.\"[47]  [Footnote 47: _Ibid._ 442, 443.]  And, of course, as the Catholic poet that he now was, he duly set about to \"write hymns\" and \"to compose chants.\" Since 1834, it will be found, his original muse, amid the \"encircling gloom,\" had been entirely silent, but once emerging into the light of the true faith, it struck the lyre again with those most lovely notes of \"Candlemas\"--       The Angel-lights of Christmas-morn,      Which shot across the sky,      Away they pass at Candlemas,      They sparkle and they die.[48]  [Footnote 48: _Verses on Various Occasions_, p. 279, Edit. 1888. The well-known tune to this was adapted by him, for the Birmingham Oratory Congregation, from Reinagle's hymn tunes, brought out by subscription at Oxford, and to which he subscribed.]  In 1849 appeared his most original and pathetic \"Pilgrim Queen,\" or No. 38, _Regina Apostolorum_, in the Hymn Book, the sweet music thereto being his own composition, (or in part adaptation?)  [Music:       There sat a Lady all on the ground,      Rays of the morning circled her round;      Save thee, and hail to thee, gracious and fair,      In the chill twilight what wouldst thou there?]  In 1850 came two more exquisite hymns in honour of the Mother of God, _i.e._, the \"Month of Mary,\" and the \"Queen of Seasons,\" both headed _Rosa Mystica_ in the hymn-book. The hymns and tunes of two others, of No. 51. \"Regulars and St. Philip,\" (an expressive melody),  [Music:       The holy monks conceal'd from men      In midnight choir or studious cell,      In sultry field or wintry glen,      The holy monks, I love them well,      In sultry field or wintry glen,      The holy monks, I love them well.]  and No. 81, \"Night\" (\"The red sun is gone,\" from the Breviary),  [Music:       The red sun is gone,      Thou light of the heart,      Blessed Three Holy One,      To Thy servants a sun      Everlasting impart.]  are also by him; and there may be others. And though this tune to No. 81 has been irreverently referred to as being \"just like an old sailor's song,\" the same critic has extolled its effect, and told us how he loved to sing its long note at eventide. No. 61, \"Conversion,\" is Father Faber's hymn, \"I was wandering and weary\" (No. 66 in the London Oratory Hymn Book[49]), but the original air in both Oratory books is the same, and the composition of Cardinal Newman.  [Footnote 49: _Oratory Hymn Tunes._ Arranged by W. Pitts. London: Novello.]  [Music:       I was wandering and weary,      When my Saviour came unto me,      For the ways of sin grew dreary,      And the world had ceas'd to woo me;      And I thought I heard Him say,      As He came along His way, &c.]  Its peculiar merits grow upon familiar acquaintance, and a devoted lover of plain chant, rather to our surprise, once expressed his affection for it. It has been termed \"briny,\" like No. 81. Its expressiveness and \"go\" are unquestionable,[50] and it is becoming popular without the public in general knowing who the composer is. The study of the application of music to words was interesting enough, as the Cardinal remarked in April, 1886. Sometimes the music could not quite fit in with the words,[51] and one or other had to give way, and on our referring to this music to Father Faber's hymn \"Conversion,\" he said he had an idea that the words had been somewhat altered to suit his tune. The reverse would appear to be the case. At least the refrain, \"O silly souls,\" &c., is not identical in the Birmingham and London books.  [Footnote 50: Father Lockhart's solitary original tune, harmonized by Mr. A.H. Prendergast, and set to Father Faber's Hymn to St. Joseph, \"There are many saints above,\" is another example of tender sentiment by an amateur that outweighs any technical defect as to settled rhythm.]  [Footnote 51: In"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26427"],["title","Cardinal Newman as a Musician (#5)"],["body","34, when Keble wrote an Ode on the Duke of Wellington's installation as Chancellor at Oxford, Dr. Crotch was employed to write the music, and Mr. Newman wrote to his friend: \"I hope Dr. Crotch will do your ode justice.\" And on difficulties arising with the composer, he wrote again to Keble: \"I like your ode uncommonly. I would not budge one step for Dr. Crotch. His letter is most amusing, and your counter-suggestions are amusing too.... I would go so far for Dr. C. as to offer him your _frigate_, which certainly does better for music than the long ode.\" Later on he inquires: \"How do you and Dr. Crotch get on?\" and Keble replies: \"Crotch has swallowed the _frigate_ whole.\" (Mozley, _Corr._ ii. 29.)]  [Music: _Birmingham._       O silly souls come near me,      My sheep should never fear me,      I am the Shepherd true,      I am the Shepherd true.  _London._       O silly souls come near me,      My sheep should never fear me,      I am the Shepherd true,      I am the Shepherd true.]  Mr. W. Pitts, the compiler of the latter, sends us word that \"the melody _only_ came into my hands, and it stands in the London book exactly as I received it. I think it was sent by one of the Birmingham Fathers, or by Mr. Edward Plater.\" This is satisfactory, and points to a smoother and far more effective version of the refrain by the composer himself.[52]  [Footnote 52: Mr. Pitts' chords are generally good, but might be considerably improved (more especially at the words \"I am the Shepherd true\"), by some contrary motion in the harmony.]  Altogether we have ever felt that there is an indescribable brightness, a radiant cheerfulness, which might have pleased St. Philip, about the Birmingham selection of hymns and tunes, with Beethoven, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Pleyell, Crookall, Webbe, Moorat, and others laid under contribution. In the Saint's time, we know, \"there were sung at the Oratory many _Laudi_, motets, madrigals, and sacred songs in the vulgar tongue, and these gave scope for composers to essay a simpler, and more popular and stirring style of music.\"[53] Take up then the Father's book, hear the people at the May devotions sing such winning songs as the \"Pilgrim Queen\" (No. 38, _Regina Apostolorum_), and the \"Month of Mary\" (No. 32, _Rosa Mystica_), or listen during St. Philip's Novena, to \"St. Philip in his School\" (No. 49), \"in his Mission\" (No. 50), \"in Himself\" (No. 51, \"Regulars and St. Philip\"), and \"in his Disciples\" (No. 54, \"Philip and the Poor\"), and we conclude that, as with the Saint, so with his distinguished son, it has been his \"aim to make sacred music popular;\"[54] and may we not further say that the Cardinal, without any parade whatever, but in the simplest fashion, has somehow succeeded at Birmingham in his aim?  [Footnote 53: Pope, _Capecelatro_, ii. 88. Father Gigli to Tarugi at Naples, about the Roman Oratory, 1587: \"Our feast passed off most joyously, and with admirable music.... We had three choirs--two in the galleries, besides one in its accustomed place.\" (_Ibid._ ii. 103.)]  [Footnote 54: _Ibid._ 99.]  The Birmingham Oratory Book, with the tunes, only privately printed for local use, came, nevertheless, as a surprise to Messrs. Burns and Westlake, who made merry over the occasional simplicity, not to say meagreness of the harmonies. A quick movement, too, from a Beethoven Rasoumousky quartet, is rather awkward, albeit taken slow, for No. 74, \"Death,\" and Leporello's song for Nos. 22 and 23, is possibly not over suitable, however intrinsically appropriate, looking to the associations it might arouse, not so much, however, among the poor, who cannot afford to patronize opera, as among the rich. \"Just look at the harmony,\" says one of No. 51; and of the famous No. 61, \"there is a strange want of unity, the first part has no second harmony.\" A noble lord, too, disapproved of No. 51, the notes being, said he, all over the key-board, but such are the strains of some of the best music in the world, and the notice to this anonymous collection is almost an answer to particular criticism, as Burns felt at once, _i.e._: \"Neither the following tunes themselves, nor the hymns to which they belong, have been brought together on any one principle of selection, or to fulfil any ideal of what such composition ought to be. Many of them have grown into use insensibly, without any one being directly responsible for them; the rest have been adapted as the most appropriate, under circumstances, to complete the set, and to answer the needs of our people.\"[55]  [Footnote 55: An examination of the book of words published by Pickering, and which originally numbered eighty-two hymns, since increased from time to time up to one hundred and forty-nine (1888), shows forty-one hymns (original or translated) by Father Caswall, Nos. 5, 8-11, 13, 15-17, 19, 21-28, 33-36, 40, 42, 43, 47, 48, 62, 64, 79, 80, 116, 118, 121, 134, 143-145, 147, 148, 149; thirty by Father Faber, 1, 3, 4, 12, 14, 29, 30, 37, 44, 45, 52, 53, 55, 57, 61, 65, 73, 85, 115, 119, 120, 124, 125, 127-129, 133, 137, 138, 141; thirteen by Father Newman, 31, 32, 38, 41, 49, 50, 51, 54, 63, 67, 76, 78, 81; two by Father Stanfield, 123, 126; one by Father Bittleston, 39 (the familiar \"Daily, daily,\" from St. Anselm, _Sancti Anselmi Mariale_, p. 15, _Omni die_, &c., the second part, No. 40, by Father Caswall); one by Father Christie, S.J., 122 (\"To Jesus' Heart all burning\"); one by Father Vaughan, C.SS.R., 130 (\"God of mercy and compassion\"); one by Bishop Chadwick, 131 (\"Jesus, my God, behold at length the time\"); one by Dr. Lingard, 20 (\"Hail, Queen of Heaven\"). Bishop Heber also contributes, but the remaining Nos. 2, 6, 7, 18, 41, 46, 56, 58, 59, 60, 66, 68, 69, 70, 72, 74, 75, 77, 78, 82, 84, 86, 117, 129, 135, 136, 139, 140, 142, 146, have not yet been identified by the present writer. (See _Lyra Catholica_, 1849, by Father Caswall, &c.) How beautifully, by the by, has not the late Father Bittleston rendered St. Anselm's hymn. For example:               _Hæc Regina,              Nos divinâ,              Illustravit gratiâ._      She the Queen who decks her subjects,      With the light of God's own grace.]  Like St. Philip, too, \"he took the word music in its widest sense, and made use of both vocal and instrumental music, and of their blended harmony.\"[56] While we believe that he would have been the first to admit the beauty of large portions of the old chant, its incomparable hymns in the liturgy, the familiar _accentus_ dear to every Catholic ear, for the Preface, the _Pater noster_, &c., the modes for Holy week, the tones for the Psalms of the Divine Office, &c., we question whether he could have made much of a mass of antiphons that seem to illustrate the sacred text, \"All we like sheep have gone astray.\" \"In Gregorian music,\" said a writer in 1890, speaking more positively than we are able to do, \"Newman could see no beauty whatever--none, at any rate, in the usual antiphons and 'tones.' An exception must be made in favour of those familiar chants occurring in the Mass.... I recollect his telling me, after we had heard one of Cherubini's Masses admirably performed at a Birmingham Festival, that the music, though so beautiful, needed the interspersing of those quaint old chants to make it really devotional,\" but \"I believe,\" writes a friend, \"it is very difficult for one who has heard only Mozart and Beethoven, &c., in all his early years ever to get a liking for Gregorian tones. It used to drive Canon Oakeley wild when he heard his nephew, the present Sir H. Oakeley, play a fugue of Bach's even on the organ. The Cardinal, however, liked the _modus peregrinus_ to the _In exitu Israel_ (that was only natural), and I remember once he seemed quite put out because once we followed the Rubrics in Easter week (when the _In exitu_ is used) by having all the Psalms to one tone. For a moment it seemed as if he would contradict himself in his strict rule of going by authority against what he liked, and would change the tones so as to have the _peregrinus_.\" He somewhere, however, calls Gregorian an \"inchoate science.\" Could mediæval work, largely out of touch with the times, claim for itself a monopoly of existence to the exclusion of the modern? So loyal a son of Holy Church as Dr. Ward had let fall that a plain chant _Gloria_ reminded him of \"original sin.\" \"And, if sometimes,\" writes a friend of old Oratory days, \"we were so unfortunate as to have on some week-day festival of our Lady, only the Gregorian Mass, Father Darnell used to say we were 'burying our Lady,' and though he would make no remark, I have little doubt the Father thought so too.\" Perhaps, then, Cardinal Newman's love for vocal and instrumental ecclesiastical music in combination (especially at Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost) was a true instinct recognizing the undoubted needs of another day, and is best labelled for a motto with some verses of the 149th and 150th Psalms, which we recommend to the attention of a few purists in case they may have forgotten them? Thus, acknowledging in January, 1859, the Gothic to be \"the most beautiful of architectural styles,\" he \"cannot approve of the intolerance of some of its admirers,\" and he would \"claim the liberty of preferring, for the purposes of worship and devotion, a description of building which, though not so beautiful in outline, is more in accordance with the ritual of the present day, which is more cheerful in its exterior, and which admits more naturally of rich materials, of large pictures or mosaics, and of mural decorations.\"[57]  [Footnote 56: Pope, _Capecelatro_, ii. 82.]  [Footnote 57: _Merry England_, No. 30, p. 380. Mon Reale, in Sicily, we think, was his ideal in the Italian style of architecture.]  \"My quarrel with Gothic and Gregorian when coupled together,\" says Campbell, in _Loss and Gain_, \"is that they are two ideas not one. Have figured music in Gothic churches, keep your Gregorian for Basilicas.\" Bateman: \"... You seem"]]]
