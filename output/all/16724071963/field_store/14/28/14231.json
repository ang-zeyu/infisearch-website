Nous nous étions si souvent arrêtés que j'avais eu le temps de tout examiner. Mon flegmatique Allemand ne comprenait rien à mon émotion, et j'aurais pu la lui expliquer dans sa langue maternelle qu'il ne l'aurait pas mieux comprise. Combien de gens, d'ailleurs, ne s'entendent pas toujours en parlant la même langue! Nous poussâmes sur la place, devant l'auberge, que je reconnus tout de suite. C'était celle où le bon capitaine m'avait reçue.  --Permettez-moi, dis-je à mon compagnon de voyage, de vous offrir à déjeuner dans cette maison. Je fis la même proposition à notre conducteur. (Un seul verre de schenaps suffit pour décider un cocher allemand à attendre sans contestation.) Les mêmes hôtes n'y étaient plus; mais les nouveaux se rappelèrent fort bien cette circonstance. Elle n'était pas de celles qu'on oublie. Je fis la conversation avec eux par l'entremise de mon interprète, qui commençait cependant à comprendre que cette ville pouvait avoir quelque intérêt pour moi. Le pont par lequel j'étais entrée était tout près de là; je voulus y aller seule, pour n'être pas distraite dans les sensations que j'éprouvais.  Ah! si l'on pouvait toujours écrire sous le charme des impressions, on dirait bien mieux! L'âme se ressouvient, la mémoire se rappelle, a dit un homme d'esprit. Combien j'aurais désiré avoir un croquis de cet endroit charmant pour mon album de voyage! Que ne suis-je maîtresse de rester ici tout un jour, me disais-je, pour recueillir à loisir mes souvenirs de cette époque! Ce cabaret même où j'avais passé une si cruelle nuit, je l'aurais revu avec intérêt.  Je me serais informée de la petite servante, qui avait, ainsi que moi, vingt ans de plus; je l'aurais récompensée de son humanité. Il y a des momens dans la vie où l'on désire plus vivement la fortune. Combien le calme qui m'environnait faisait contraste avec le tumulte de l'époque où j'avais traversé ce pays!...  Les mêmes lieux nous reportent aux mêmes temps; il semble qu'ils fassent disparaître l'intervalle qui nous en sépare. Je remerciai le ciel du secours qu'il m'avait alors envoyé, et bientôt tout ce voyage entrepris dans le beau pays de l'imagination disparut comme une fantasmagorie...

CHAPTER I.   The \"Two Little Confederates\" lived at Oakland. It was not a handsome place, as modern ideas go, but down in Old Virginia, where the standard was different from the later one, it passed in old times as one of the best plantations in all that region. The boys thought it the greatest place in the world, of course excepting Richmond, where they had been one year to the fair, and had seen a man pull fire out of his mouth, and do other wonderful things. It was quite secluded. It lay, it is true, right between two of the county roads, the Court-house Road being on one side, and on the other the great \"Mountain Road,\" down which the large covered wagons with six horses and jingling bells used to go; but the lodge lay this side of the one, and \"the big woods,\" where the boys shot squirrels, and hunted 'possums and coons, and which reached to the edge of \"Holetown,\" stretched between the house and the other, so that the big gate-post where the semi-weekly mail was left by the mail-rider each Tuesday and Friday afternoon was a long walk, even by the near cut through the woods. The railroad was ten miles away by the road. There was a nearer way, only about half the distance, by which the negroes used to walk and which during the war, after all the horses were gone, the boys, too, learned to travel; but before that, the road by Trinity Church and Honeyman's Bridge was the only route, and the other was simply a dim bridle-path, and the \"horseshoe-ford\" was known to the initiated alone.  The mansion itself was known on the plantation as \"the great-house,\" to distinguish it from all the other houses on the place, of which there were many. It had as many wings as the angels in the vision of Ezekiel.  These additions had been made, some in one generation, some in another, as the size of the family required; and finally, when there was no side of the original structure to which another wing could be joined, a separate building had been erected on the edge of the yard which was called \"The Office,\" and was used as such, as well as for a lodging-place by the young men of the family. The privilege of sleeping in the Office was highly esteemed, for, like the _toga virilis_, it marked the entrance upon manhood of the youths who were fortunate enough to enjoy it. There smoking was admissible, there the guns were kept in the corner, and there the dogs were allowed to sleep at the feet of their young masters, or in bed with them, if they preferred it.  In one of the rooms in this building the boys went to school whilst small, and another they looked forward to having as their own when they should be old enough to be elevated to the coveted dignity of sleeping in the Office. Hugh already slept there, and gave himself airs in proportion; but Hugh they regarded as a very aged person; not as old, it was true, as their cousins who came down from college at Christmas, and who, at the first outbreak of war, all rushed into the army; but each of these was in the boys' eyes a Methuselah. Hugh had his own horse and the double-barrelled gun, and when a fellow got those there was little material difference between him and other men, even if he did have to go to the academy,--which was really something like going to school.  The boys were Frank and Willy; Frank being the eldest. They went by several names on the place. Their mother called them her \"little men,\" with much pride; Uncle Balla spoke of them as \"them chillern,\" which generally implied something of reproach; and Lucy Ann, who had been taken into the house to \"run after\" them when they were little boys, always coupled their names as \"Frank 'n' Willy.\" Peter and Cole did the same when their mistress was not by.  When there first began to be talk at Oakland about the war, the boys thought it would be a dreadful thing; their principal ideas about war being formed from an intimate acquaintance with the Bible and its accounts of the wars of the Children of Israel, in which men, women and children were invariably put to the sword. This gave a vivid conception of its horrors.  One evening, in the midst of a discussion about the approaching crisis, Willy astonished the company, who were discussing the merits of probable leaders of the Union armies, by suddenly announcing that he'd \"bet they didn't have any general who could beat Joab.\"  Up to the time of the war, the boys had led a very uneventful, but a very pleasant life. They used to go hunting with Hugh, their older brother, when he would let them go, and after the cows with Peter and Cole. Old Balla, the driver, was their boon comrade and adviser, and taught them to make whips, and traps for hares and birds, as he had taught them to ride and to cobble shoes.  He lived alone (for his wife had been set free years before, and lived in Philadelphia). His room over \"the old kitchen\" was the boys' play-room when he would permit them to come in. There were so many odds and ends in it that it was a delightful place.  Then the boys played blindman's-buff in the house, or hide-and-seek about the yard or garden, or upstairs in their den, a narrow alcove at the top of the house.  The little willow-shadowed creek, that ran through the meadow behind the barn, was one of their haunts. They fished in it for minnows and little perch; they made dams and bathed in it; and sometimes they played pirates upon its waters.  Once they made an extended search up and down its banks for any fragments of Pharaoh's chariots which might have been washed up so high; but that was when they were younger and did not have much sense.     CHAPTER II.   There was great excitement at Oakland during the John Brown raid, and the boys' grandmother used to pray for him and Cook, whose pictures were in the papers.  The boys became soldiers, and drilled punctiliously with guns which they got Uncle Balla to make for them. Frank was the captain, Willy the first lieutenant, and a dozen or more little negroes composed the rank and file, Peter and Cole being trusted file-closers.  A little later they found their sympathies all on the side of peace and the preservation of the Union. Their uncle was for keeping the Union unbroken, and ran for the Convention against Colonel Richards, who was the chief officer of the militia in the county, and was as blood-thirsty as Tamerlane, who reared the pyramid of skulls, and as hungry for military renown as the great Napoleon, about whom the boys had read.  There was immense excitement in the county over the election. Though the boys' mother had made them add to their prayers a petition that their Uncle William might win, and that he might secure the blessings of peace; and, though at family prayers, night and morning, the same petition was presented, the boys' uncle was beaten at the polls by a large majority. And then they knew there was bound to be war, and that it must be very wicked. They almost felt the \"invader's heel,\" and the invaders were invariably spoken of as \"cruel,\" and the heel was described as of \"iron,\" and was always mentioned as engaged in the act of crushing. They would have been terribly alarmed at this cruel invasion had they not been reassured by the general belief of the community that one Southerner could whip ten Yankees, and that, collectively, the South could drive back the North with pop-guns. When the war actually broke out, the boys were the most enthusiastic of rebels, and the troops in Camp Lee did not drill more continuously nor industriously.  Their father, who had been a Whig and opposed secession until the very last, on Virginia's seceding, finally cast his lot with his people, and joined an infantry company; and Uncle William raised and equipped an artillery company, of which he was chosen captain; but the infantry was too tame and the artillery too ponderous to suit the boys.  They were taken to see the drill of the county troop of cavalry, with its prancing horses and clanging sabres. It was commanded by a cousin; and from that moment they were cavalrymen to the core. They flung away their stick-guns in disgust; and Uncle Balla spent two grumbling days fashioning"]]]
