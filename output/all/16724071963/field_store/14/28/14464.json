But there's no readiness to enlist, Jefson, not on your life. I'm sorry to say the physically worst are offering themselves for their country's service, and only ten per cent. of those offering are accepted; and though they advertise 'bowling alleys,' 'free trips round the world,' and other stunts as inducements, the response is so flat that when I passed through Chicago last August to come here, the recruiting stations had a notice up 'colored men wanted for infantry!' You know there's a sure prejudice against the nigger, we grudge giving him a vote, but when it comes to fighting for the country, well, he's as welcome as the 'flowers that bloom in the spring, tra-la.' I guess you Australians lick us right there.\"  [Illustration: \"Information had been received of a new type of Zeppelin.\"--Chapter VIII.]     CHAPTER VIII.  A Prisoner in Cologne.   A military operation order is crystallised commonsense. It is a wonderfully concise bunch of phraseology.  Our squadron commander read the latest by lamplight over a spread map of the theatre of war.  The general situation of the campaign explained that a Zeppelin raid on the east coast of England had been made on the 19th of January, thirteen days before.  Information had been received that a new type of Zeppelin had been constructed, a \"mother\" type, capable of carrying a number of aeroplanes.  The intention of the operation order was to destroy all known Zeppelin sheds; each air squadron supplying special officers for the purpose.  I well remember the particulars of that order. They printed their details upon my memory because I had been selected to destroy the sheds at Saarbruck. I was to leave three hours before the following dawn.  I remember Nap's disappointment that I was to go alone. He helped my machine out without a word. He may have had a premonition that I was not to return as I watched him silently fixing the compass and map-roller, testing the spring catch and guide of the bomb-dropper and packing into it its heavy load of \"cough-drops.\" Then he stood like a dumb figure waiting for my starting signal.  \"Buck up, Nap,\" I ventured, climbing into the seat. \"One would think this was a funeral. I must get a hustle on as I've got to do 120 miles before I can get to business, so if everything's right, I'll swoop up.\"  Nap looked up.  \"Fly high, and good luck,\" was all he said as he gripped my hand. Then I pressed the starter, the propeller hummed and pulled me into the star-specked sky.  I steered easterly, leaving on my left the red fire-glow of Rheims and passing over the sleepy lights of Valny. Within an hour I was over the great black stretch of the Argonne Forest, and crossing the Meuse, a long line of fog with Verdun 7000 feet below. The engine was working well, throwing back the miles at about 60 per hour. A glow of lights to the right showed Metz next to a streak of grey, the Moselle River; and as the dawn-light came into the sky, the Saar River came under me, covered by a fog with a fringe that flapped over its right bank and covered Saarbruck.  According to the sketch-map the Zeppelin sheds were near the railway station. So I flew low into the mist to get their correct position. The noise of my engine brought a shot from an aerial gun, but the fog saved me. A bunch of lights brought the station into view with the unmistakable long hangar of the Zeppelin adjacent to it.  I turned to get the sheds beneath me, and three foot-treads sent as many bombs chasing each other earthwards.  The first hit the ground near the shed, exploding without doing any damage. The second crashed through the roof of the hangar, its explosion being almost coincident with a fearful crash; the resulting air-rush almost overturning my 'plane. The third bomb fell into the back end of the shed, but I guessed it was not required.  My job was done, so I rose high above the fog line to get a straight run for home. Three Taubes were patrolling high, evidently on the look out.  I saw they would have the drop on me, so I sank back into the fog and under its cover swooped across the river for home. I was over the enemy's country where I guessed I was being searched for, so taking advantage of the fog I maintained a 1000 feet level and made a bee-line for Epernay.  [Illustration: THE ZEPPELIN SHED, AT SAARBRUCK.  Chapter VIII.]  My job was done, and I remember I was particularly elated.  I got a surprise near the Argonne Forest, striking a breeze that suddenly came up from the south, lifting the fog curtain and showing me dangerously close to the earth.  I swiftly jerked the elevator for a swoop up as a rifle cracked. I was spotted!  A volley of shots followed and--I was winged.  I remember, like a hideous dream, a long, evil-smelling shed in which I lay, a stiffly stretched and bandaged figure on a straw-strewn floor.  I was afterwards told it was Mezieres Railway Station, and that I was one of many hundred wounded being taken from the field hospitals to the base.  I need not detail my experiences for the next six months. I was taken from the hospital at Aix-la-Chapelle to Cologne to be attached to a gang of prisoners for street cleaning.  I remember our daily march across the Great Rhine Bridge with its wonderful arches at its entrance, and the great bronze horses on its flanks. I had occasion to remember that bridge, for there, some time later, the sunshine was to come into my life.  For six months I had not heard much of the war. My hospital friends had been wounded about the same time as I. My street-gang mates, a Belgian and a Frenchman, knew little except that up till June the Ostend-Nancy fighting line was still held by both armies. The lack of news did not worry me during my days of pain, but as the strength came back to me it brought a craving for news of the Great Game. Where were the Allies? What of the North Sea Fleet? How was Australia taking it? What was Nap doing? were questions that chased each other through my mind. Five Taubes had flown over us the day before, going south, but--what was doing?  It was on the Cologne Bridge a week later that a rather pretty girl, with an unmistakable English face, stopped to converse with one of my guard. At the same time she pointed to me: at which the guard looked round, frowned and spat with contempt.  \"Are you English?\" she queried.  \"Yes,\" I replied, \"I'm from Australia.\"  I had touched a sympathetic chord and she \"sparked\" up.  \"Australia! Do you know Sydney?\" she asked.  \"I'm from Manly,\" was all I replied.  Then she did what I thought was a foolish thing--she came over and nearly shook my arm off!  The officer of the guard resented it, but she jabbered at him and explained to me that Australian prisoners were to have special treatment, then glancing at my number she stepped out across the bridge.  I found she was correct. When my gang returned to the barracks my number was called and I was questioned by the officer in charge. I was informed that Germany had no quarrel with Australia, hence I was only to be a prisoner on parole, to report myself twice a day and come and go as I pleased.  That is how I came to win great facts regarding Germany and her ideals. That is how I found out how it was that with Austria, Germany for nine months could hold at bay the mighty armies of the world's three greatest Empires, British, French and Russian, as well as the fighting cocks of Belgium; and at the same time endeavor to knock into some sort of fighting shape the crooked army of the Turks; how three nations of 109,000,000 people could defy for nine months the six greatest nations in the world with a joint population of 622,200,000!  The facts are of striking import to-day and should be understood by every man who is fighting for the Allies on and in the land, sea and air.  [Illustration: \"On the bridge across the Rhine, at Cologne.\"--Chapter VIII.]     CHAPTER IX.  Some Surprises in Cologne.   My unexpected freedom in Cologne was but one of many surprise.  There was the surprise of meeting an Australian friend in such unexpected quarters. I ascertained her name was Miss Goche. Her father was a well-known merchant of Melbourne, but was now living in Sydney. He had sent his daughter to the Leipsic Conservatorium to receive the technical polish every aspiring Australian musician seems to consider the \"hall mark of excellence.\"  But the war closed the Conservatorium as it did most other concerns, by drawing out the younger professors to the firing line and the older men to the Landstrum, a body of spectacled elderly men in uniform, who felt the spirit wake in their feeble blood and prided themselves as \"bloodthirsty dogs,\" as they watched railway lines, reservoirs, power stations, and did other unexciting small jobs.  Miss Goche was staying with her aunt and grandfather in Cologne. At their home I was made welcome.  Little restriction was placed on my movements, than the twice daily reporting at the Barracks.  I wondered at this freedom.  \"It is easily explained,\" said old Goche, who could speak English. \"The Fatherland knows no enmity with Australia. We have sympathy for the Indians, Canadians and other races of your Empire, who have been whipped into this war against their own free will.\"  \"But,\" I interrupted, \"there has been no whipping.\"  \"Tut, tut,\" he continued. \"We of the Fatherland know. Have we not proof? Our \"Berliner Tageblatt\" tells us so. We have no quarrel with the colonial people. Our hate is for England alone; and when this war is over and we have England at our feet, we shall be welcomed by Australia and the colonies, and we shall let them share with us the freedom and the light and the wisdom of our great Destiny.\"  There was no convincing the old man to the contrary, and his granddaughter informed me that the same opinion was universal in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27382"],["title","The Sequel (#5)"],["body","rmany.  \"The best proof that it is so is the freedom you enjoy,\" she said.  \"And yet there are times,\" she continued, \"that I feel there is a subtle reason for this apparent kindliness for the colonies of the British Empire. You know Germany cannot successfully develop her own colonies. She has not that spirit of initiative that the Britisher has in attacking the various vicissitudes that every pioneer meets with in the development of a new land. That is why she let her colonies be snapped up by Australia without a pang; that is why as you say, she let her people hand over Rabaul and New Guinea to your Colonel Holmes without a battle. She fancies that when she wins this war as she has convinced herself she will, it will be a simple matter to step into the occupation of ready made colonies of such wonderful wealth and development.\"  The chief surprise of my freedom, however, was my changed opinion regarding the way Germany was taking the war.  I, like the average Britisher, had believed that in checking the German rush on Paris and driving it to the Aisne, we had whipped Germany to a standstill.  We had pictured her checked on the east with her Austrian ally on the verge of pleading for peace; her fleet cowering in the Kiel Canal like a frightened hen beneath a barn.  I, like every other Britisher, had fancied that Germany was undergoing an awful process of slow death; that she was faced with economic ruin; that her trade and manufacture had been smashed, causing untold ruination and forcing famine into every home; that the German populace were being crushed under the terrors of defeat, were cursing \"the Kaiser and his tyrannical militarism,\" and waiting for the inevitable uprising with revolution and general social smash up.  And I knew such was the belief of the Allies and the world generally.  Never was a more mistaken notion spread!  Germany, notwithstanding what blunders and miscalculations she was accused of making, believed she would win.  This belief obsessed her.  Every movement, whether it achieves its direct object or not was made to nail that belief more secure.  A great philosopher wrote many years ago the following maxims:--  \"To the persevering--everything is possible.\"  \"They will conquer who believe they can.\"  Germany believed she would conquer, and for forty years she had been building up that belief.  [Illustration: \"German aeroplanes were built from English types.\"  Chapter X.]     CHAPTER X.  \"Made in Germany.\"   Grandpa Goche told the story of Germany's development with mingled pride, yet with a tinge of regret.  We sat before his wide fireplace where a great fire crackled.  Puffing at his long pipe Grandpa Goche peered into the fire for a space before answering my query as to Germany's destiny.  \"The destiny of the Deutschland?\" he finally exclaimed. \"Ah! It will be great and wonderful. But where it will end--who knows! Will it be like the Tower of Babel, great in conception, great in execution, but overreaching in its greatness? Will our destiny be like the snowball, accumulating as it rolls till it becomes immovable in its immensity? Then--stagnation! And yet the start of that snowball was but 50 years ago.  \"I remember as a boy when Bismarck was Prime Minister of Prussia, and he forced through the Reichstag his great army re-organisation scheme. In '64 he attacked Denmark and took Schleswig-Holstein. That is how we got Kiel. Two years after he crushed the Austrians in six weeks, and took Hanover, Hesse, and Nassau; and four years after that he smashed the French and took Alsace-Lorraine.  \"Flushed with victory, proud Deutschland, with Denmark, Austria and France humbled in the dust, wiped her sword and peered at the Dawn. But she did not sheath that sword. No! In the ecstasy of triumph she was trying to formulate a policy of carving a destiny great and glorious. She looked first to peaceful development by legislation; and then, in that passing period of uncertainty, Bismarck threw out his famous declaration that the destiny of Deutschland was to be won, not by votes and speeches, but by Blood and Iron.  \"It was what you call a 'happy hit.'  \"It appealed to the animal strength of the German race. Bismarck knew that beneath the surface most of the men of Germany were of a wild nature; he knew that in less than a century they rose from the degradation of conquered barbarians to the heights of victors of three nations, and the 'blood and iron' policy ran through Germany as a new inspiration.  \"Bismarck floated the great new Ship of State, and stood at the wheel peering keenly into the troublous waters of the future. There was one great rock of which he wished to steer clear, so on the Ship of Destiny he placed a maxim. It was: 'War not with England.'  \"There were other simple rules of navigation that irritated a new young officer on the bridge, who felt that the Bismarckian policy, though perhaps sure, was not speedy enough for his vaulting ambition.  \"I remember well this young Kaiser, a man of wonderful vitality, who revelled in the strength of developing manhood, and who early began to assert himself. Those who tried to curb his youthful impetuosity went down before him till there was but one great personality left who could talk to him as a father would to his wayward son. It was Bismarck, he who dragged Prussia from the depths and gave her the ideal for a world power. The cool calculating wiseacre said, 'Steady, lad,' so--he had to go.  \"Then the Kaiser took the wheel.  \"He found Germany a comparatively small country, with a great and prolific population of sixty-six millions. He found the German woman not the mild and simple 'hausfrau' of folk lore, but a virile woman with a creed that the production of children was her first duty, not only to her husband and herself, but to her country. He knew that in Germany illegitimacy was no disgrace, and he saw Germany's population increase ten millions in the course of ten years.  \"He looked at his restricted boundaries and saw his people being bottled up. That's why he gave the declaration that 'Germany's destiny is upon the water'.  \"We needed colonies, but all the colonies worth having were taken by--whom? Your England!  \"We were hungry for trade and influence in distant waters, but your England held the gateways to the world's trade channels.  \"The road to Asia and Australia was lined with England's forts, and Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said and Aden watched the way like frowning sentinels.  \"It was then that we prepared for 'The Day.'  \"Our Kaiser gave the call 'Deutschland Uber Alles' (Germany over all). It was a new creed, and it soon gained the strength of a religion.  \"I know you English ridicule the idea of the Kaiser and his Divine Right--but do not forget an English King claimed the same thing.\"  [Illustration: \"DROPPING THE PILOT.\"  Tenniel's Cartoon in \"Punch,\" showing the reckless irresponsibility of the Kaiser began early.]  \"Yes,\" I interrupted, \"and we chopped off his head.\"  He went on, ignoring my interruption--  \"You English speak of God as the God of Hosts and the God of Battles, but you only mouth it. We Germans believe in it, and we work for it. It permeates our life like a divine call. It makes every man feel he is a part of a great whole, a working unit in an immense machine, whether it be in the field of battle or in the field of industry. We feel we are doing a divine duty.  \"And this divine spirit is in our work.  \"We associate all our tasks with a sense of service to our fellow citizens. We make trade and civic education compulsory to all boys from 14 to 18 years of age and to all girls from 11 to 16 years of age. Your England has only 26 per cent. of children at school between those ages.  \"We train our children and people to discharge specialised functions. We associate practice with theory. We amalgamate science with manufacture.  \"Your England at one time was the chief glass manufacturing country, but thirty years ago a professor of mathematics at Jena joined a glass maker, and to-day we lead in the world's glass manufacture.  \"In 1910, your England exported one and a half million pounds worth of glass, and Germany exported five million pounds worth.  \"In 1880, your England led the world in the output of pig iron, producing nearly eight million tons to four million tons produced by the United States.  \"In 1910, the United States produced twenty-seven million tons, Germany fifteen million tons, and Great Britain ten million tons.  \"In 1856 an Englishman named Perkins first produced a coal tar dye.  \"In 1910, Germany exported nine and a half million pounds worth, while Great Britain exported only £336,000 worth.  \"So you see Germany has beaten England in peace as you will see we shall beat her in war.\"  Then he spat into the fire, put his pipe away, and as he was going out to bed flung this final shot:  \"And there again we differ from you English. That is why we go into this divine struggle as a grim and serious business. One great united army with a hymn to God, and one great battle cry, 'Deutschland Uber Alles.' You English take it as what you call 'a jolly sport,' with your battle cry, 'Are we down-hearted?' and your battle hymn, 'It's a long long way to Tipperary,' ah-ha-ho\"--and he laughed his way up to his bedroom.  I sat looking into the dying flames, dwelling upon all his jibes.  I thought how each German felt he was a cog in the immense national machine, and had his work systematised. I could then understand how that killed initiative in the individual, and why Germany had not made any great discoveries in science or manufacture, but had simply stolen ideas of other countries and adapted them to her own ends.  Grandpa Goche had spoken of coal tar dye, then I recalled how Germany had also taken Marconi's wireless invention and Germanised it; how it had taken the French and the English ideas in airship and aeroplane construction and worked upon them; how even the English town planning movement was"]]]
