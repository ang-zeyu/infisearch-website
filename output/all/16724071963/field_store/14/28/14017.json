We want you to take charge of the house, and see to it that the boat is kept shipshape.\"  \"Where is the house?\" queried the astonished boatman.  \"This is it,\" said Sir Walter.  \"This is the house, and the boat too.  In fact, it is a house-boat.\"  \"Then it isn't a new-fangled scheme to drive me out of business?\" said Charon, warily.  \"Not at all,\" returned Sir Walter.  \"It's a new-fangled scheme to set you up in business.  We'll pay you a large salary, and there won't be much to do.  You are the best man for the place, because, while you don't know much about houses, you do know a great deal about boats, and the boat part is the most important part of a house-boat.  If the boat sinks, you can't save the house; but if the house burns, you may be able to save the boat.  See?\"  \"I think I do, sir,\" said Charon.  \"Another reason why we want to employ you for Janitor,\" said Confucius, \"is that our club wants to be in direct communication with both sides of the Styx; and we think you as Janitor would be able to make better arrangements for transportation with yourself as boatman, than some other man as Janitor could make with you.\"  \"Spoken like a sage,\" said Demosthenes.  \"Furthermore,\" said Cassius, \"occasionally we shall want to have this boat towed up or down the river, according to the house committee's pleasure, and we think it would be well to have a Janitor who has some influence with the towing company which you represent.\"  \"Can't this boat be moved without towing?\" asked Charon.  \"No,\" said Cassius.  \"And I'm the only man who can tow it, eh?\"  \"You are,\" said Blackstone.  \"Worse luck.\"  \"And you want me to be Janitor on a salary of what?\"  \"A hundred oboli a month,\" said Sir Walter, uneasily.  \"Very well, gentlemen,\" said Charon.  \"I'll accept the office on a salary of two hundred oboli a month, with Saturdays off.\"  The committee went into executive session for five minutes, and on their return informed Charon that in behalf of the Associated Shades they accepted his offer.  \"In behalf of what?\" the old man asked.  \"The Associated Shades,\" said Sir Walter.  \"The swellest organization in Hades, whose new house-boat you are now on board of.  When shall you be ready to begin work?\"  \"Right away,\" said Charon, noting by the clock that it was the hour of midnight.  \"I'll start in right away, and as it is now Saturday morning, I'll begin by taking my day off.\"     CHAPTER II: A DISPUTED AUTHORSHIP   \"How are you, Charon?\" said Shakespeare, as the Janitor assisted him on board.  \"Any one here to-night?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Charon.  \"Lord Bacon is up in the library, and Doctor Johnson is down in the billiard-room, playing pool with Nero.\"  \"Ha-ha!\" laughed Shakespeare.  \"Pool, eh?  Does Nero play pool?\"  \"Not as well as he does the fiddle, sir,\" said the Janitor, with a twinkle in his eye.  Shakespeare entered the house and tossed up an obolus.  \"Heads--Bacon; tails--pool with Nero and Johnson,\" he said.  The coin came down with heads up, and Shakespeare went into the pool-room, just to show the Fates that he didn't care a tuppence for their verdict as registered through the obolus.  It was a peculiar custom of Shakespeare's to toss up a coin to decide questions of little consequence, and then do the thing the coin decided he should not do.  It showed, in Shakespeare's estimation, his entire independence of those dull persons who supposed that in them was centred the destiny of all mankind.  The Fates, however, only smiled at these little acts of rebellion, and it was common gossip in Erebus that one of the trio had told the Furies that they had observed Shakespeare's tendency to kick over the traces, and always acted accordingly.  They never let the coin fall so as to decide a question the way they wanted it, so that unwittingly the great dramatist did their will after all.  It was a part of their plan that upon this occasion Shakespeare should play pool with Doctor Johnson and the Emperor Nero, and hence it was that the coin bade him repair to the library and chat with Lord Bacon.  \"Hullo, William,\" said the Doctor, pocketing three balls on the break. \"How's our little Swanlet of Avon this afternoon?\"  \"Worn out,\" Shakespeare replied.  \"I've been hard at work on a play this morning, and I'm tired.\"  \"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,\" said Nero, grinning broadly.  \"You are a bright spirit,\" said Shakespeare, with a sigh.  \"I wish I had thought to work you up into a tragedy.\"  \"I've often wondered why you didn't,\" said Doctor Johnson.  \"He'd have made a superb tragedy, Nero would.  I don't believe there was any kind of a crime he left uncommitted.  Was there, Emperor?\"  \"Yes.  I never wrote an English dictionary,\" returned the Emperor, dryly. \"I've murdered everything but English, though.\"  \"I could have made a fine tragedy out of you,\" said Shakespeare.  \"Just think what a dreadful climax for a tragedy it would be, Johnson, to have Nero, as the curtain fell, playing a violin solo.\"  \"Pretty good,\" returned the Doctor.  \"But what's the use of killing off your audience that way?  It's better business to let 'em live, I say. Suppose Nero gave a London audience that little musicale he provided at Queen Elizabeth's Wednesday night.  How many purely mortal beings, do you think, would have come out alive?\"  \"Not one,\" said Shakespeare.  \"I was mighty glad that night that we were an immortal band.  If it had been possible to kill us we'd have died then and there.\"  \"That's all right,\" said Nero, with a significant shake of his head.  \"As my friend Bacon makes Ingo say, 'Beware, my lord, of jealousy.'  You never could play a garden hose, much less a fiddle.\"  \"What do you mean my attributing those words to Bacon?\" demanded Shakespeare, getting red in the face.  \"Oh, come now, William,\" remonstrated Nero.  \"It's all right to pull the wool over the eyes of the mortals.  That's what they're there for; but as for us--we're all in the secret here.  What's the use of putting on nonsense with us?\"  \"We'll see in a minute what the use is,\" retorted the Avonian.  \"We'll have Bacon down here.\"  Here he touched an electric button, and Charon came in answer.  \"Charon, bring Doctor Johnson the usual glass of ale.  Get some ice for the Emperor, and ask Lord Bacon to step down here a minute.\"  \"I don't want any ice,\" said Nero.  \"Not now,\" retorted Shakespeare, \"but you will in a few minutes.  When we have finished with you, you'll want an iceberg.  I'm getting tired of this idiotic talk about not having written my own works.  There's one thing about Nero's music that I've never said, because I haven't wanted to hurt his feelings, but since he has chosen to cast aspersions upon my honesty I haven't any hesitation in saying it now.  I believe it was one of his fiddlings that sent Nature into convulsions and caused the destruction of Pompeii--so there!  Put that on your music rack and fiddle it, my little Emperor.\"  Nero's face grew purple with anger, and if Shakespeare had been anything but a shade he would have fared ill, for the enraged Roman, poising his cue on high as though it were a lance, hurled it at the impertinent dramatist with all his strength, and with such accuracy of aim withal that it pierced the spot beneath which in life the heart of Shakespeare used to beat.  \"Good shot,\" said Doctor Johnson, nonchalantly.  \"If you had been a mortal, William, it would have been the end of you.\"  \"You can't kill me,\" said Shakespeare, shrugging his shoulders.  \"I know seven dozen actors in the United States who are trying to do it, but they can't.  I wish they'd try to kill a critic once in a while instead of me, though,\" he added.  \"I went over to Boston one night last week, and, unknown to anybody, I waylaid a fellow who was to play Hamlet that night. I drugged him, and went to the theatre and played the part myself.  It was the coldest house you ever saw in your life.  When the audience did applaud, it sounded like an ice-man chopping up ice with a small pick. Several times I looked up at the galleries to see if there were not icicles growing on them, it was so cold.  Well, I did the best could with the part, and next morning watched curiously for the criticisms.\"  \"Favorable?\" asked the Doctor.  \"They all dismissed me with a line,\" said the dramatist.  \"Said my conception of the part was not Shakespearian.  And that's criticism!\"  \"No,\" said the shade of Emerson, which had strolled in while Shakespeare was talking, \"that isn't criticism; that's Boston.\"  \"Who discovered Boston, anyhow?\" asked Doctor Johnson.  \"It wasn't Columbus, was it?\"  \"Oh no,\" said Emerson.  \"Old Governor Winthrop is to blame for that.  When he settled at Charlestown he saw the old Indian town of Shawmut across the Charles.\"  \"And Shawmut was the Boston microbe, was it?\" asked Johnson.  \"Yes,\" said Emerson.  \"Spelt with a P, I suppose?\" said Shakespeare.  \"P-S-H-A-W, Pshaw, M-U-T, mut, Pshawmut, so called because the inhabitants are always muttering pshaw.  Eh?\"  \"Pretty good,\" said Johnson.  \"I wish I'd said that.\"  \"Well, tell Boswell,\" said Shakespeare.  \"He'll make you say it, and it'll be all the same in a hundred years.\"  Lord Bacon, accompanied by Charon and the ice for Nero and the ale for Doctor Johnson, appeared as Shakespeare spoke.  The philosopher bowed stiffly at Doctor Johnson, as though he hardly approved of him, extended his left hand to Shakespeare, and stared coldly at Nero.  \"Did you send for me, William?\" he asked, languidly.  \"I did,\" said Shakespeare.  \"I sent for you because this imperial violinist here says that you wrote _Othello_.\"  \"What nonsense,\" said Bacon.  \"The only plays of yours I wrote were _Ham_--\"  \"Sh!\" said Shakespeare, shaking his head madly.  \"Hush.  Nobody's said anything about that.  This is purely a discussion of _Othello_.\"  \"The fiddling ex-Emperor Nero,\" said Bacon, loudly enough to be heard all about the room, \"is mistaken when he attributes "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2618"],["title","A House-Boat on the Styx (#2)"],["body","to me.\"  \"Aha, Master Nero!\" cried Shakespeare triumphantly.  \"What did I tell you?\"  \"Then I erred, that is all,\" said Nero.  \"And I apologize.  But really, my Lord,\" he added, addressing Bacon, \"I fancied I detected your fine Italian hand in that.\"  \"No.  I had nothing to do with the _Othello_,\" said Bacon.  \"I never really knew who wrote it.\"  \"Never mind about that,\" whispered Shakespeare.  \"You've said enough.\"  \"That's good too,\" said Nero, with a chuckle.  \"Shakespeare here claims it as his own.\"  Bacon smiled and nodded approvingly at the blushing Avonian.  \"Will always was having his little joke,\" he said.  \"Eh, Will?  How we fooled 'em on _Hamlet_, eh, my boy?  Ha-ha-ha!  It was the greatest joke of the century.\"  \"Well, the laugh is on you,\" said Doctor Johnson.  \"If you wrote _Hamlet_ and didn't have the sense to acknowledge it, you present to my mind a closer resemblance to Simple Simon than to Socrates.  For my part, I don't believe you did write it, and I do believe that Shakespeare did.  I can tell that by the spelling in the original edition.\"  \"Shakespeare was my stenographer, gentlemen,\" said Lord Bacon.  \"If you want to know the whole truth, he did write _Hamlet_, literally.  But it was at my dictation.\"  \"I deny it,\" said Shakespeare.  \"I admit you gave me a suggestion now and then so as to keep it dull and heavy in spots, so that it would seem more like a real tragedy than a comedy punctuated with deaths, but beyond that you had nothing to do with it.\"  \"I side with Shakespeare,\" put in Emerson.  \"I've seen his autographs, and no sane person would employ a man who wrote such a villanously bad hand as an amanuensis.  It's no use, Bacon, we know a thing or two.  I'm a New-Englander, I am.\"  \"Well,\" said Bacon, shrugging his shoulders as though the results of the controversy were immaterial to him, \"have it so if you please.  There isn't any money in Shakespeare these days, so what's the use of quarrelling?  I wrote _Hamlet_, and Shakespeare knows it.  Others know it.  Ah, here comes Sir Walter Raleigh.  We'll leave it to him.  He was cognizant of the whole affair.\"  \"I leave it to nobody,\" said Shakespeare, sulkily.  \"What's the trouble?\" asked Raleigh, sauntering up and taking a chair under the cue-rack.  \"Talking politics?\"  \"Not we,\" said Bacon.  \"It's the old question about the authorship of _Hamlet_.  Will, as usual, claims it for himself.  He'll be saying he wrote Genesis next.\"  \"Well, what if he does?\" laughed Raleigh.  \"We all know Will and his droll ways.\"  \"No doubt,\" put in Nero.  \"But the question of _Hamlet_ always excites him so that we'd like to have it settled once and for all as to who wrote it.  Bacon says you know.\"  \"I do,\" said Raleigh.  \"Then settle it once and for all,\" said Bacon.  \"I'm rather tired of the discussion myself.\"  \"Shall I tell 'em, Shakespeare?\" asked Raleigh.  \"It's immaterial to me,\" said Shakespeare, airily.  \"If you wish--only tell the truth.\"  \"Very well,\" said Raleigh, lighting a cigar.  \"I'm not ashamed of it.  I wrote the thing myself.\"  There was a roar of laughter which, when it subsided, found Shakespeare rapidly disappearing through the door, while all the others in the room ordered various beverages at the expense of Lord Bacon.     CHAPTER III: WASHINGTON GIVES A DINNER   It was Washington's Birthday, and the gentleman who had the pleasure of being Father of his Country decided to celebrate it at the Associated Shades' floating palace on the Styx, as the Elysium _Weekly Gossip_, \"a Journal of Society,\" called it, by giving a dinner to a select number of friends.  Among the invited guests were Baron Munchausen, Doctor Johnson, Confucius, Napoleon Bonaparte, Diogenes, and Ptolemy.  Boswell was also present, but not as a guest.  He had a table off to one side all to himself, and upon it there were no china plates, silver spoons, knives, forks, and dishes of fruit, but pads, pens, and ink in great quantity.  It was evident that Boswell's reportorial duties did not end with his labors in the mundane sphere.  The dinner was set down to begin at seven o'clock, so that the guests, as was proper, sauntered slowly in between that hour and eight.  The menu was particularly choice, the shades of countless canvas-back ducks, terrapin, and sheep having been called into requisition, and cooked by no less a person than Brillat-Savarin, in the hottest oven he could find in the famous cooking establishment superintended by the government. Washington was on hand early, sampling the olives and the celery and the wines, and giving to Charon final instructions as to the manner in which he wished things served.  The first guest to arrive was Confucius, and after him came Diogenes, the latter in great excitement over having discovered a comparatively honest man, whose name, however, he had not been able to ascertain, though he was under the impression that it was something like Burpin, or Turpin, he said.  At eight the brilliant company was arranged comfortably about the board. An orchestra of five, under the leadership of Mozart, discoursed sweet music behind a screen, and the feast of reason and flow of soul began.  \"This is a great day,\" said Doctor Johnson, assisting himself copiously to the olives.  \"Yes,\" said Columbus, who was also a guest--\"yes, it is a great day, but it isn't a marker to a little day in October I wot of.\"  \"Still sore on that point?\" queried Confucius, trying the edge of his knife on the shade of a salted almond.  \"Oh no,\" said Columbus, calmly.  \"I don't feel jealous of Washington.  He is the Father of his Country and I am not.  I only discovered the orphan. I knew the country before it had a father or a mother.  There wasn't anybody who was willing to be even a sister to it when I knew it.  But G. W. here took it in hand, groomed it down, spanked it when it needed it, and started it off on the career which has made it worth while for me to let my name be known in connection with it.  Why should I be jealous of him?\"  \"I am sure I don't know why anybody anywhere should be jealous of anybody else anyhow,\" said Diogenes.  \"I never was and I never expect to be. Jealousy is a quality that is utterly foreign to the nature of an honest man.  Take my own case, for instance.  When I was what they call alive, how did I live?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Doctor Johnson, turning his head as he spoke so that Boswell could not fail to hear.  \"I wasn't there.\"  Boswell nodded approvingly, chuckled slightly, and put the Doctor's remark down for publication in _The Gossip_.  \"You're doubtless right, there,\" retorted Diogenes.  \"What you don't know would fill a circulating library.  Well--I lived in a tub.  Now, if I believed in envy, I suppose you think I'd be envious of people who live in brownstone fronts with back yards and mortgages, eh?\"  \"I'd rather live under a mortgage than in a tub,\" said Bonaparte, contemptuously.  \"I know you would,\" said Diogenes.  \"Mortgages never bothered you--but I wouldn't.  In the first place, my tub was warm.  I never saw a house with a brownstone front that was, except in summer, and then the owner cursed it because it was so.  My tub had no plumbing in it to get out of order. It hadn't any flights of stairs in it that had to be climbed after dinner, or late at night when I came home from the club.  It had no front door with a wandering key-hole calculated to elude the key ninety-nine times out of every hundred efforts to bring the two together and reconcile their differences, in order that their owner may get into his own house late at night.  It wasn't chained down to any particular neighborhood, as are most brownstone fronts.  If the neighborhood ran down, I could move my tub off into a better neighborhood, and it never lost value through the deterioration of its location.  I never had to pay taxes on it, and no burglar was ever so hard up that he thought of breaking into my habitation to rob me.  So why should I be jealous of the brownstone-house dwellers?  I am a philosopher, gentlemen.  I tell you, philosophy is the thief of jealousy, and I had the good-luck to find it out early in life.\"  \"There is much in what you say,\" said Confucius.  \"But there's another side to the matter.  If a man is an aristocrat by nature, as I was, his neighborhood never could run down.  Wherever he lived would be the swell section, so that really your last argument isn't worth a stewed icicle.\"  \"Stewed icicles are pretty good, though,\" said Baron Munchausen, with an ecstatic smack of his lips.  \"I've eaten them many a time in the polar regions.\"  \"I have no doubt of it,\" put in Doctor Johnson.  \"You've eaten fried pyramids in Africa, too, haven't you?\"  \"Only once,\" said the Baron, calmly.  \"And I can't say I enjoyed them. They are rather heavy for the digestion.\"  \"That's so,\" said Ptolemy.  \"I've had experience with pyramids myself.\"  \"You never ate one, did you, Ptolemy?\" queried Bonaparte.  \"Not raw,\" said Ptolemy, with a chuckle.  \"Though I've been tempted many a time to call for a second joint of the Sphinx.\"  There was a laugh at this, in which all but Baron Munchausen joined.  \"I think it is too bad,\" said the Baron, as the laughter subsided--\"I think it is very much too bad that you shades have brought mundane prejudice with you into this sphere.  Just because some people with finite minds profess to disbelieve my stories, you think it well to be sceptical yourselves.  I don't care, however, whether you believe me or not.  The fact remains that I have eaten one fried pyramid and countless stewed icicles, and the stewed icicles were finer than any diamond-back rat Confucius ever had served at a state banquet.\"  \"Where's Shakespeare to-night?\" asked Confucius, seeing that the Baron was beginning to lose his temper, and wishing to avoid trouble by changing the subject.  \"Wasn't he invited, General?\"  \"Yes,\" said Washington, \"he was invited, but he couldn't come.  He had to go over the river to consult with an autograph "]]]
