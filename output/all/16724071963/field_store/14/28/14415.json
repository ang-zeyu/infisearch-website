Still, both Catherine and Belle persistently hardened their hearts against their gentle little cousin in the unkindest way; they would scarcely speak to her, and chose to make a grievance out of the fact that one or other of them was obliged, by their mother's strict orders, to be constantly in attendance upon her, in order to pick up and bring Mrs. Hoyle all the jewels that Priscilla scattered in profusion wherever she went.  'If you would only carry a plate about with you, Priscilla,' complained Belle one day, 'you could catch the jewels in that.'  'But I don't _want_ to catch the jewels, dear Belle,' said Priscilla, with a playful but very sweet smile; 'if other people prize such things, that is not my fault, is it? _Jewels_ do not make people any happier, Belle!'  'I should think not!' exclaimed Belle. 'I'm sure my back perfectly aches with stooping, and so does Cathie's. There! that big topaz has just gone and rolled under the sideboard, and mother will be so angry if I don't get it out! It is too bad of you, Priscilla! _I_ believe you do it on purpose!'  'Ah, you will know me better some day, dear, was the gentle response.  'Well, at all events, I think you might be naughty just now and then, Prissie, and give Cathie and me a half-holiday.'  'I would do anything else to please you, dear, but not that; you must not ask me to do what is impossible.'  Alas! not even this angelic behaviour, not even the loving admonitions, the tender rebukes, the shocked reproaches that fell, accompanied by perfect cascades of jewels, from the lips of our pattern little Priscilla, succeeded in removing the utterly unfounded prejudices of her cousins, though it was some consolation to feel that she was gradually acquiring a most beneficial influence over her aunt, who called Priscilla 'her little conscience.' For, you see, Priscilla's conscience had so little to do on her own account that it was always at the service of other people, and indeed quite enjoyed being useful, as was only natural to a conscientious conscience which felt that it could never have been created to be idle.  Very soon another responsibility was added to little Priscilla's burdens. Her cousin Dick, the worldly one with the yellow boots, came home after his annual holiday, which, as he was the junior clerk in a large bank, he was obliged to take rather late in the year. She had looked forward to his return with some excitement. Dick, she knew, was frivolous and reckless in his habits--he went to the theatre occasionally and frequently spent an evening in playing billiards and smoking cigars at a friend's house. There would be real credit in reforming poor cousin Dick.  He was not long, of course, in hearing of Priscilla's marvellous endowment, and upon the first occasion they were alone together treated her with a respect and admiration which he had very certainly never shown her before.  'You're wonderful, Prissie!' he said; 'I'd no idea you had it in you!'  'Nor had I, Dick; but it shows that even a little girl can do something.'  'I should rather think so! and--and the way you look--as grave as a judge all the time! Prissie, I wish you'd tell me how you manage it, I wouldn't tell a soul.'  'But I don't know, Dick. I only talk and the jewels come--that is all.'  'You artful little girl! you can keep a secret, I see, but so can I. And you might tell me how you do the trick. What put you up to the dodge? I'm to be trusted, I assure you.'  'Dick, you can't--you mustn't--think there is any trickery about it! How can you believe I could be such a wicked little girl as to play tricks? It was an old fairy that gave me the gift. I'm sure I don't know why--unless she thought that I was a good child and deserved to be encouraged.'  'By Jove!' cried Dick, 'I never knew you were half such fun!'  'I am not fun, Dick. I think fun is generally so very vulgar, and oh, I wish you wouldn't say \"by Jove!\" Surely you know he was a heathen god!'  'I seem to have heard of him in some such capacity,' said Dick. 'I say, Prissie, what a ripping big ruby!'  'Ah, Dick, Dick, you are like the others! I'm afraid you think more of the jewels than of any words I may say--and yet _jewels_ are common enough!'  'They seem to be with you. Pearls, too, and such fine ones! Here, Priscilla, take them; they're your property.'  Priscilla put her hands behind her: 'No, indeed, Dick, they are of no use to me. Keep them, please; they may help to remind you of what I have said.'  'It's awfully kind of you,' said Dick, looking really touched. 'Then--since you put it in that way--thanks, I will, Priscilla. I'll have them made into a horse-shoe pin.'  'You mustn't let it make you too fond of dress, then,' said Priscilla; 'but I'm afraid you're that already, Dick.'  'A diamond!' he cried; 'go on, Priscilla, I'm listening--pitch into me, it will do me a _lot_ of good!'  But Priscilla thought it wisest to say no more just then.  That night, after Priscilla and Cathie and Belle had gone to bed, Dick and his mother sat up talking until a late hour.  'Is dear little cousin Priscilla to be a permanency in this establishment?' began her cousin, stifling a yawn, for there had been a rather copious flow of precious stones during the evening.  'Well, I shall keep her with us as long as I can,' said Mrs. Hoyle, 'she's such a darling, and they don't seem to want her at home. I'm sure, limited as my means are, I'm most happy to have such a visitor.'  'She seems to pay her way--only her way is a trifle trying at times, isn't it? She lectured me for half an hour on end without a single check!'  'Are you sure you picked them all up, dear boy?'  'Got a few of the best in my waistcoat-pocket now. I'm afraid I scrunched a pearl or two, though: they were all over the place, you know. I suppose you've been collecting too, mater?'  'I picked up one or two,' said his mother; 'I should think I must have nearly enough now to fill a bandbox. And that brings me to what I wanted to consult you about, Richard. How are we to dispose of them? She has given them all to me.'  'You haven't done anything with them yet, then?'  'How could I? I have been obliged to stay at home: I've been so afraid of letting that precious child go out of my sight for a single hour, for fear some unscrupulous persons might get hold of her. I thought that perhaps, when you came home, you would dispose of the jewels for me.'  'But, mater,' protested Dick, 'I can't go about asking who'll buy a whole bandbox full of jewels!'  'Oh, very well, then; I suppose we must go on living this hugger-mugger life when we have the means of being as rich as princes, just because you are too lazy and selfish to take a little trouble!'  'I know something about these things,' said Dick. 'I know a fellow who's a diamond merchant, and it's not so easy to sell a lot of valuable stones as you seem to imagine, mother. And then Priscilla really overdoes it, you know--why, if she goes on like this, she'll make diamonds as cheap as currants!'  '_I_ should have thought that was a reason for selling them as soon as possible; but I'm only a woman, and of course _my_ opinion is worth nothing! Still, you might take some of the biggest to your friend, and accept whatever he'll give you for them--there are plenty more, you needn't haggle over the price.'  'He'd want to know all about them, and what should I say? I can't tell him a cousin of mine produces them whenever she feels disposed.'  'You could say they have been in the family for some time, and you are obliged to part with them; I don't ask you to tell a falsehood, Richard.'  'Well, to tell you the honest truth,' said Dick, 'I'd rather have nothing to do with it. I'm not proud, but I shouldn't like it to get about among our fellows at the bank that I went about hawking diamonds.'  'But, you stupid, undutiful boy, don't you see that you could leave the bank--you need never do anything any more--we should all live rich and happy somewhere in the country, if we could only sell those jewels! And you won't do that one little thing!'  'Well,' said Dick, 'I'll think over it. I'll see what I can do.'  And his mother knew that it was perfectly useless to urge him any further: for, in some things, Dick was as obstinate as a mule, and, in others, far too easy-going and careless ever to succeed in life. He had promised to think over it, however, and she had to be contented with that.  On the evening following this conversation cousin Dick entered the sitting-room the moment after his return from the City, and found his mother to all appearances alone.  'What a dear sweet little guileless angel cousin Priscilla is, to be sure!' was his first remark.  'Then you _have_ sold some of the stones!' cried Aunt Margarine. 'Sit down, like a good boy, and tell me all about it.'  'Well,' said Dick, 'I took the finest diamonds and rubies and pearls that escaped from that saintlike child last night in the course of some extremely disparaging comments on my character and pursuits--I took those jewels to Faycett and Rosewater's in New Bond Street--you know the shop, on the right-hand side as you go up----'  'Oh, go on, Dick; go on--never mind _where_ it is--how much did you get for them?'  'I'm coming to that; keep cool, dear mamma. Well, I went in, and I saw the manager, and I said: \"I want you to make these up into a horse-shoe scarf-pin for me.\"'  'You said that! You never tried to sell one? Oh, Dick, you are too provoking!'  'Hold on, mater; I haven't done yet. So the manager--a very gentlemanly person, rather thin on the top of the head--not that that affects his business capacities; for, after all----'  'Dick, do you want to drive me frantic!'  'I can't conceive any domestic occurrence which would be more distressing or generally inconvenient, mother dear.

Well, the manager said, \"We shall be very happy to have the stones made in any design you may select\"--jewellery, by the way, seems to exercise a most refining influence upon the manners: this man had the deportment of a duke--\"you may select,\" he said; \"but of course I need not tell you that none of these stones are genuine.\"'  'Not genuine!' cried Aunt Margarine excitedly. 'They must be--he was lying!'  'West-end jewellers never lie,' said Dick; 'but naturally, when he said that, I told him I should like to have some proof of his assertion. \"Will you take the risk of testing?\" said he. \"Test away, my dear man!\" said I. So he brought a little wheel near the emerald--\"whizz!\" and away went the emerald! Then he let a drop of something fall on the ruby--and it fizzled up for all the world like pink champagne. \"Go on, don't mind _me_!\" I told him, so he touched the diamond with an electric wire--\"phit!\" and there was only something that looked like the ash of a shocking bad cigar. Then the pearls--and they popped like so many air-balloons. \"Are you satisfied?\" he asked.  '\"Oh, perfectly,\"' said I, \"you needn't trouble about the horse-shoe pin now. Good evening,\" and so I came away, after thanking him for his very amusing scientific experiments.'  'And do you believe that the jewels are all shams, Dick?--do you really?'  'I think it so probable that nothing on earth will induce me to offer a single one for sale. I should never hear the last of it at the bank. No, mater, dear little Priscilla's sparkling conversation may be unspeakably precious from a moral point of view, but it has no commercial value. Those jewels are bogus--shams every stone of them!'  Now, all this time our heroine had been sitting unperceived in a corner behind a window-curtain, reading 'The Wide, Wide World,' a work which she was never weary of perusing. Some children would have come forward earlier, but Priscilla was never a forward child, and she remained as quiet as a little mouse up to the moment when she could control her feelings no longer.  'It isn't true!' she cried passionately, bursting out of her retreat and confronting her cousin; 'it's cruel and unkind to say my jewels are shams! They are real--they are, they _are_!'  'Hullo, Prissie!' said her abandoned cousin; 'so you combine jewel-dropping with eaves-dropping, eh?'  'How dare you!' cried Aunt Margarine, almost beside herself, 'you odious little prying minx, setting up to teach your elders and your betters with your cut and dried priggish maxims! When I think how I have petted and indulged you all this time, and borne with the abominable litter you left in every room you entered--and now to find you are only a little, conceited, hypocritical impostor--oh, _why_ haven't I words to express my contempt for such conduct--why am I dumb at such a moment as this?'  'Come, mother,' said her son soothingly, 'that's not such a bad beginning; I should call it fairly fluent and expressive, myself.'  'Be quiet, Dick! I'm speaking to this wicked child, who has obtained our love and sympathy and attention on false pretences, for which she ought to be put in prison--yes, in _prison_, for such a heartless trick on relatives who can ill afford to be so cruelly disappointed!'  'But, aunt!' expostulated poor Priscilla, 'you always said you only kept the jewels as souvenirs, and that it did you so much good to hear me talk!'  'Don't argue with _me_, miss! If I had known the stones were wretched tawdry imitations, do you imagine for an instant----?'  'Now, mother,' said Dick, 'be fair--they were uncommonly good imitations, you must admit that!'  'Indeed, indeed I thought they were real, the fairy never told me!'  'After all,' said Dick, 'it's not Priscilla's fault. She can't help it if the stones aren't real, and she made up for quality by quantity anyhow; didn't you, Prissie?'  'Hold your tongue, Richard; she _could_ help it, she knew it all the time, and she's a hateful, sanctimonious little stuck-up viper, and so I tell her to her face!'  Priscilla could scarcely believe that kind, indulgent, smooth-spoken Aunt Margarine could be addressing such words to her; it frightened her so much that she did not dare to answer, and just then Cathie and Belle came into the room.  'Oh, mother,' they began penitently, 'we're _so_ sorry, but we couldn't find dear Prissie anywhere, so we haven't picked up anything the whole afternoon!'  'Ah, my poor darlings, you shall never be your cousin's slaves any more. Don't go near her, she's a naughty, deceitful wretch; her jewels are false, my sweet loves, false! She has imposed upon us all, she does not deserve to associate with you!'  'I always said Prissie's jewels looked like the things you get on crackers!' said Belle, tossing her head.  'Now we shall have a little rest, I hope,' chimed in Cathie.  'I shall send her home to her parents this very night,' declared Aunt Margarine; 'she shall not stay here to pervert our happy household with her miserable _gewgaws_!'  Here Priscilla found her tongue. 'Do you think I _want_ to stay?' she said proudly; 'I see now that you only wanted to have me here because--because of the horrid jewels, and I never knew they were false, and I let you have them all, every one, you know I did; and I wanted you to mind what I said and not trouble about picking them up, but you _would_ do it! And now you all turn round upon me like this! What have I done to be treated so? What have I done?'  'Bravo, Prissie!' cried Dick. 'Mother, if you ask me, I think it serves us all jolly well right, and it's a downright shame to bullyrag poor Prissie in this way!'  'I _don't_ ask you,' retorted his mother, sharply; 'so you will kindly keep your opinions to yourself.'  'Tra-la-la!' sang rude Dick, 'we are a united family--we are, we are, we _are_!'--a vulgar refrain he had picked up at one of the burlesque theatres he was only too fond of frequenting.  But Priscilla came to him and held out her hand quite gratefully and humbly. 'Thank you, Dick,' she said; '_you_ are kind, at all events. And I am sorry you couldn't have your horse-shoe pin!'  'Oh, _hang_ the horse-shoe pin!' exclaimed Dick, and poor Priscilla was so thoroughly cast down that she quite forgot to reprove him.  She was not sent home that night after all, for Dick protested against it in such strong terms that even Aunt Margarine saw that she must give way; but early on the following morning Priscilla quitted her aunt's house, leaving her belongings to be sent on after her.  She had not far to walk, and it so happened that her way led through the identical lane in which she had met the fairy. Wonderful to relate, there, on the very same stone and in precisely the same attitude, sat the old lady, peering out from under her poke-bonnet, and resting her knotty old hands on her crutch-handled stick!  Priscilla walked past with her head in the air, pretending not to notice her, for she considered that the fairy had played her a most malicious and ill-natured trick.  'Heyday!' said the old lady (it is only fairies who can permit themselves such old-fashioned expressions nowadays). 'Heyday, why, here's my good little girl again! Isn't she going to speak to me?'  'No, she's not,' said Priscilla--but she found herself compelled to stop, notwithstanding.  'Why, what's all this about? You're not going to sulk with me, my dear, are you?'  'I think you're a very cruel, bad, unkind old woman for deceiving me like this!'  'Goodness me! Why, didn't the jewels come, after all?'  'Yes--they came, only they were all horrid artificial ones--and it is a shame, it _is_!' cried poor Priscilla from her bursting heart.  'Artificial, were they? that really is very odd! Can you account for that at all, now?'  'Of course I can't! You told me that they would drop out whenever I said anything to improve people--and I was _always_ saying _something_ improving! Aunt had a bandbox in her room quite full of them.'  'Ah, you've been very industrious, evidently; it's unfortunate your jewels should all have been artificial--most unfortunate. I don't know how to explain it, unless'--(and here the old lady looked up queerly from under her white eyelashes), 'unless your goodness was artificial too?'  'How do you mean?' asked Priscilla, feeling strangely uncomfortable. 'I'm sure I've never done anything the least bit naughty--how can my goodness possibly be artificial?'  'Ah, that I can't explain; but I know this--that people who are really good are generally the last persons to suspect it, and the moment they become aware of it and begin to think how good they are, and how bad everybody else is, why, somehow or other, their goodness crumbles away and leaves only a sort of outside shell behind it. And--I'm very old, and of course I may be mistaken--but I think (I only say I _think_, mind) that a little girl so young as you must have some faults hidden about her somewhere, and that perhaps on the whole she would be better employed in trying to find them out and cure them before she attempted to correct those of other people. And I'm sure it can't be good for any child to be always seeing herself in a little picture, just as she likes to fancy other people see her. Very many pretty books are written about good little girls, and it is quite true that children may exercise a great influence for good--more than they can ever tell, perhaps--but only just so long as they remain natural and unconscious, and not unwholesome little pragmatical prigesses; for then they make themselves and other people worse than they might have been. But of course, my dear, you never made such a mistake as that!'  Priscilla turned very red, and began to scrape one of her feet against the other; she was thinking, and her thoughts were not at all pleasant ones.  'Oh, fairy,' she said at last, 'I'm afraid that's just what I _did_ do. I was always thinking how good I was and putting everybody--p"]]]
