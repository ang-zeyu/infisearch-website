He smiled abashedly:  \"I think,\" he said humbly, \"that I speak of the high destiny of mankind. But the part that applies at the moment is that Sergeant Bellews must not be interfered with.\"  He turned and ardently assisted Sergeant Bellews in making room for the just-brought devices. Sergeant Bellews led flexible cables from them to Betsy. He inserted their leads in her training-terminals. He made adjustments within.  It became notable that Betsy's standby light took up new tempos in its wavering. There were elaborate interweavings of rate and degree of brightening among the lights of all three instruments. There was no possible way to explain the fact, but a feeling of pleasure, of zestful stirring, was somehow expressed by the three machines which had been linked together into a cooperating group.  Sergeant Bellews eased himself into a chair.  \"Now everything's set,\" he observed contentedly. \"Remember, I ain't seen any of these broadcasts unscrambled. I don't know what it's all about. But we got three Mahon machines set up now to work on the next crazy broadcast that comes in. There's Betsy and these two others. And all machines work accordin' to the Golden Rule, but Mahon machines--they are honey-babes! They'll bust themselves tryin' to do what you ask 'em. And I asked these babies for plenty--only not enough to hurt 'em. Let's see what they turn out.\"  He pulled a pipe and tobacco from his pocket. He filled the pipe. He squeezed the side of the bowl and puffed as the tobacco glowed. He relaxed, underneath the wall-sign which sternly forbade smoking by all military personnel within these premises.  It was nearly three hours--but it could have been hundreds--before Betsy's screen lighted abruptly.         *       *       *       *       *  The broadcast came in; a new transmission. The picture-pattern on Betsy's screen was obviously not the same as other broadcasts from nowhere. The chirps and peepings and the rumbling deep sounds were not repetitions of earlier noise-sequences. It should have taken many days of finicky work by technicians at the Pentagon before the originally broadcast picture could be seen and the sound interpreted. But a play-back recorder named Al, and a picture-unscrambler named Gus were in closed-circuit relationship with Betsy. She received the broadcast and they unscrambled the sound and vision parts of it immediately.  The translated broadcast, as Gus and Al presented it, was calculated to put the high brass of the defense forces into a frenzied tizzy. The anguished consternation of previous occasions would seem like very calm contemplation by comparison. The high brass of the armed forces should grow dizzy. Top-echelon civilian officials should tend to talk incoherently to themselves, and scientific consultants--biologists in particular--ought to feel their heads spinning like tops.  The point was that the broadcast had to be taken seriously because it came from nowhere. There was no faintest indication of any signal outside of Betsy's sedately gray-painted case. But Betsy was not making it up. She couldn't. There was a technology involved which required the most earnest consideration of the message carried by it.  And this broadcast explained the danger from which the alleged future wished to rescue its alleged past. A brisk, completely deracialized broadcaster appeared on Gus's screen.  In clipped, oddly stressed, but completely intelligible phrases, he explained that he recognized the paradox his communication represented. Even before 1972, he observed, there had been argument about what would happen if a man could travel in time and happened to go back to an earlier age and kill his grandfather. This communication was an inversion of that paradox. The world of 2180 wished to communicate back in time and save the lives of its great-great-great-grandparents so that it--the world of 2180--would be born.  Without this warning and the information to be given, at least half the human race of 1972 was doomed.  In late 1971 there had been a mutation of a minor strain of _staphylococcus_ somewhere in the Andes. The new mutation thrived and flourished. With the swift transportation of the period, it had spread practically all over the world unnoticed, because it produced no symptoms of disease.  Half the members of the human race were carriers of the harmless mutated _staphylococcus_ now, but it was about to mutate again in accordance with Gordon's Law (the reference had no meaning in 1972) and the new mutation would be lethal. In effect, one human being in two carried in his body a semi-virus organization which he continually spread, and which very shortly would become deadly. Half the human race was bound to die unless it was instructed as to how to cope with it. Unless--         *       *       *       *       *  Unless the world of 2180 told its ancestors what to do about it. That was the proposal. Two-way communication was necessary for the purpose, because there would be questions to be answered, obscure points to be clarified, numerical values to be checked to the highest possible degree of accuracy.  Therefore, here were diagrams of the transmitter needed to communicate with future time. Here were enlarged diagrams of individual parts. The enigmatic parts of the drawing produced a wave-type unknown in 1972. But a special type of wave was needed to travel beyond the three dimensions of ordinary space, into the fourth dimension which was time. This wave-type produced unpredictable surges of power in the transmitter, wherefore at least six transmitters should be built and linked together so that if one ceased operation another would instantly take up the task.         *       *       *       *       *  The broadcast ended abruptly. Betsy's screen went blank. The colonel was notified. A courier took tapes to Washington by high-speed jet. Life in Research Establishment 83 went on sedately. The barracks and the married quarters and the residences of the officers were equipped with Mahon-modified machines which laundered diapers perfectly, and with dial telephones which always rang right numbers, and there were police-up machines which took perfect care of lawns, and television receivers tuned themselves to the customary channels for different hours with astonishing ease. Even jet-planes equipped with Mahon units almost landed themselves, and almost flew themselves about the sky in simulated combat with something very close to zest.  But the atmosphere in the room in Communications was tense.  \"I think,\" said Howell, with his lips compressed, \"that this answers all your objections, Graves. Motive--\"  \"No,\" said Lecky painfully. \"It does not answer mine. My objection is that I do not believe it.\"  \"Huh!\" said Sergeant Bellews scornfully. \"O' course, you don't believe it! It's phoney clear through!\"  Lecky looked at him hopefully.  \"You noticed something that we missed, Sergeant?\"  \"Hell, yes!\" said Sergeant Bellews. \"That transmitter diagram don't have a Mahon unit in it!\"  \"Is that remarkable?\" demanded Howell.  \"Remarkable dumb,\" said the sergeant. \"They'd ought to know--\"  The tall young lieutenant who earlier had fetched Sergeant Bellews to Communications now appeared again. He gracefully entered the room where Betsy waited for more broadcast matter. Her standby light flickered with something close to animation, and the similar yellow bulbs on Al and Gus responded in kind. The tall young lieutenant said politely:  \"I am sorry, but pending orders from the Pentagon the colonel has ordered this room vacated. Only automatic recorders will be allowed here, and all records they produce will be sent to Washington without examination. It seems that no one on this post has the necessary clearance for this type of material.\"  Lecky blinked. Graves sputtered:  \"But--dammit, do you mean we can work out a way to receive a broadcast and not be qualified to see it?\"  \"There's a common-sense view,\" said Sergeant Bellews oracularly, \"and a crazy view, and there's what the Pentagon says, which ain't either.\" He stood up. \"I see where I go back to my shop and finish rehabilitatin' the colonel's vacuum cleaner. You gentlemen care to join me?\"  Howell said indignantly:  \"This is ridiculous! This is absurd!\"  \"Uh-uh,\" said Sergeant Bellews benignly. \"This is the armed forces. There'll be an order makin' some sort of sense come along later. Meanwhile, I can brief you guys on Mahon machines so you'll be ready to start up again with better information when a clearance order does come through. And I got some beer in my quarters behind the Rehab Shop. Come along with me!\"  He led the way out of the room. The young lieutenant paused to close the door firmly behind him and to lock it. A bored private, with side-arms, took post before it. The lieutenant was a very conscientious young man.  But he did not interfere with the parade to Sergeant Bellews' quarters. The young lieutenant was very military, and the ways of civilians were not his concern. If eminent scientists chose to go to Sergeant Bellews' quarters instead of the Officers Club, to which their assimilated rank entitled them, it was strictly their affair.         *       *       *       *       *  They reached the Rehab Shop, and Sergeant Bellews went firmly to a standby-light-equipped refrigerator in his quarters. He brought out beer and deftly popped off the tops. The icebox door closed quietly.  \"Here's to crime,\" said Sergeant Bellews amiably.  He drank. Howell sipped gloomily. Graves drank thoughtfully. Lecky looked anticipative.  \"Sergeant,\" he said, \"did I see a gleam in your eye just now?\"  Sergeant Bellews reflected, gently shaking his opened beer-can with a rotary motion, for no reason whatever.  \"Uh-uh,\" he rumbled. \"I wouldn't say a gleam. But you mighta seen a glint. I got some ideas from what I seen during that broadcast. I wanna get to work on 'em. Here's the place to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26174"],["title","The Machine That Saved The World (#5)"],["body"," the work. We got facilities here.\"  Howell said with precise hot anger:  \"This is the most idiotic situation I have ever seen even in government service!\"  \"You ain't been around much,\" the sergeant told him kindly. \"It happens everywhere. All the time. It ain't even a exclusive feature of the armed forces.\" He put down his beer-can and patted his stomach. \"There's guys who sit up nights workin' out standard operational procedures just to make things like this happen, everywhere. The colonel hadda do what he did. He's got orders, too. But he felt bad. So he sent the lieutenant to tell us. He does the colonel's dirty jobs--and he loves his work.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He moved grandly toward the Rehab Shop proper, which opened off the quarters he lived in--very much as a doctor's office is apt to open off his living quarters.  \"We follow?\" asked Lecky zestfully. \"You plan something?\"  \"Natural!\" said Sergeant Bellews largely.  He led the way into the Rehab Shop, which was dark and shadowy, and only very dimly lighted by flickering, wavering lights of many machines waiting as if hopefully to be called on for action. There were the shelves of machines not yet activated. Sergeant Bellews led the way toward his desk. There was a vacuum cleaner on it, on standby. He put it down on the floor.  Lecky watched him with some eagerness. The others came in, Howell dourly and Graves wiping his moustache.  The sergeant considered his domain.  \"We'll be happy to help you,\" said Lecky.  \"Thanks,\" said the sergeant. \"I'm under orders to help you, too, y'know. Just supposing you asked me to whip up something to analyze what Betsy receives, so it can be checked on that it is a new wave-type.\"  \"Can you do that?\" demanded Graves. \"We were supposed to work on that--but so far we've absolutely nothing to go on!\"  The sergeant waved his hand negligently.  \"You got something now. Betsy's a Mahon-modified device. Every receiver that picked up one of those crazy broadcasts broke down before it was through. She takes 'em in her stride--especial with Al and Gus to help her. Wouldn't it be reasonable to guess that Mahon machines are--uh--especial adapted to handle intertemporal communication?\"  \"Very reasonable!\" said Howell dourly. \"Very! The broadcast said that the wave-type produced unpredictable surges of current. Ordinary machines do find it difficult to work with whatever type of radiation that can be.\"  \"Betsy chokes off those surges,\" observed the sergeant. \"With Gus and Al to help, she don't have no trouble. We hadn't ought to need to make any six transmitters if we put Mahon-unit machines together for the job!\"  \"Quite right,\" agreed Lecky, mildly. \"And it is odd--\"  \"Yeah,\" said the sergeant. \"It's plenty odd my great-great-great-grandkids haven't got sense enough to do it themselves!\"         *       *       *       *       *  He went to a shelf and brought down a boxed machine,--straight from the top-secret manufactory of Mahon units. It had never been activated. Its standby light did not glow. Sergeant Bellews ripped off the carton and said reflectively:  \"You hate to turn off a machine that's got its own ways of working. But a machine that ain't been activated has not got any personality. So you don't mind starting it up to turn it off later.\"  He opened the adjustment-cover and turned something on. The standby light glowed. Closely observed, it was not a completely steady glow. There were the faintest possible variations of brightness. But there was no impression of life.  Graves said:  \"Why doesn't it flicker like the others?\"  \"No habits,\" said the sergeant. \"No experience. It's like a newborn baby. It'll get to have personality after it's worked a while. But not now.\"  He went across the shop again. He moved out a heavy case, and twisted the release, and eased out a communicator of the same type--Mark IV--as Betsy back in the Communications room. Howell went to help him. Graves tried to assist. Lecky moved other things out of the way. They were highly eminent scientists, and Metech Sergeant Bellews was merely a non-commissioned officer in the armed forces. But he happened to have specialized information they had not. Quite without condescension they accepted his authority in his own field, and therefore his equality. As civilians they had no rank to maintain, and they disagreed with each other--and would disagree with the sergeant--only when they knew why. Which was one of the reasons why they were eminent scientists.  Sergeant Bellews brought out yet another box. He unrolled cables. He selected machines whose flickering lights seemed to bespeak eagerness to be of use. He coupled them to the newly unboxed machines, whose lights were vaguely steady.  \"Training cables,\" he said over his shoulder. \"You get one machine working right, and you hook it with another, and the new machine kinda learns from the old one. Kinda! But it ain't as good as real experience. Not at first.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Presently the lights of the newly energized machines began to waver in somewhat the manner of the ready-for-operation ones. But they did not give so clear an impression of personality.  \"Look!\" said Sergeant Bellews abruptly. \"I got to check with you. The more I think, the more worried I get.\"  \"You begin to believe the broadcasts come from the future?\" demanded Graves. \"And it worries you? But they do not speak of Mahon units--\"  \"I don't care where they come from,\" said the sergeant. \"I'm worryin' about what they are! The guy in the broadcast--not knowing Mahon units--said we'd have to make half a dozen transmitters so they'd take over one after another as they blew out. You see what that means?\"  Lecky said crisply:  \"You pointed it out before. There is something in the wave-type which--you would say this, Sergeant!--which machines do not like. Is that the reasoning?\"  \"Uh-uh!\" The sergeant scowled. \"Machines work by the golden rule. They try to do unto you what they want you to do unto them. Likes an' dislikes don't matter. I mean that there's something about that wave-type that machines _can't_ take! It busts them. If it sort of explodes surges of current in 'em--Look! Any running machine is a dynamic system in a object. A jet-plane operating is that. So's a water-spout. So's a communicator. But if you explode surges of heavy current in a dynamic system in a operating machine--things get messed up. The operating habit is busted to hell. I'm saying that if this wave-type makes crazy surges of current start up--why--if the surges are strong enough they'll bust not only a communicator but a jet-plane. Or a water-spout. Anything! See?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lecky blinked and suddenly went pale.  \"But,\" said Howell reasonably, \"you said that Betsy handled it. Especially well when linked with other Mahon machines.\"  \"Yeah,\" said the sergeant.  \"I think,\" observed Graves jerkily, \"that you are preparing new machines, without developed--personalities, because you think that if they make this special-type wave they'll be broken.\"  \"Yeah,\" said the sergeant, again. \"The signal Betsy was amplifyin' coulda been as little as a micro-micro-watt. At its frequency an' type, she'd choke it down if it was more. But even a micro-micro-watt bothered Betsy until she got Al and Gus to help. She was fair screamin' for somebody to come help her hold it. But the three of them done all right.\"  Howell conceded the point.  \"That seems sound reasoning.\"  \"But you don't broadcast with a micro-micro-watt. You use a hell of a lot more power than that! The transmitter the guy in the screen said to make was a twenty-kilowatt job. Not too much for a broadcast of sine waves, but a hell of a lot to be turned loose, in waves that have Betsy hollerin' at the power she was handlin'!\"  \"It might break even the Mahon machines in this installation?\" demanded Howell.  \"You're gettin' warm,\" said the sergeant.  Graves said:  \"You mean it might break all operating communicators in a very large area?\"  \"You're gettin' hot,\" said the sergeant grimly.  Lecky wetted his lips.  \"I think,\" he said very carefully, \"that you suspect it is a wave-type which will break any dynamic system, in any sort of object a dynamic system can exist in.\"  \"Yeah,\" said the sergeant. He waited, looking at Lecky.  \"And,\" said Lecky, \"not only operating machines are dynamic systems. Living plants and animals are, too. So are men.\"  \"That's what I'm drivin' at,\" said Sergeant Bellews.  \"So you believe,\" said Lecky, very pale indeed, \"that we have been given the circuit-diagram of a transmitter which will broadcast a wave-type which destroys dynamic systems--life as well as the operation of machines. Persons--in the future or an alien creature in a space-ship, or perhaps even the Compubs--are furnishing us with designs for transmitters of death, to be linked together so that if one fails the others will carry on. And they lure us to destroy ourselves by lying about who they are and what they propose.\"  \"They're lyin',\" said the sergeant. \"They say they're in the future and they don't know a thing about Mahon units. Else they'd use 'em.\"  Lecky wetted his lips again.  \"And--if they are not in the future, they are trying to get us to destroy ourselves because that would be safer and surer than trying to destroy us by--say--transmitters of death dropped upon us by parachute. Yet if we do not destroy ourselves, they will surely do that.\"  \"If we don't bump ourselves off, it'll be because we got wise,\" acknowledged the sergeant. \"If we get wise, we could bump them off by parachute-transmitter. So they'll beat us to it. They'll have to!\"  \"Yes,\" said Lecky. \"They'll have to. It has always been said that a death-ray was impossible. This would be a death-broadcast. If we do not broadcast, they will--whoever they are. It is--\" He smiled mirthlessly at the magnitude of his understatement. \"It is urgent that we do something. What shall we do,"]]]
