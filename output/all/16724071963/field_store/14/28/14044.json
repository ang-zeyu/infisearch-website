The Rand-McNally Press Chicago       _To    ALL WHO LOVE THE BIRDS FOR THEIR   OWN SAKES,    who desire to cultivate comradeship with them in books   and in the field, and who will study them   with the glass and without the gun._     BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION   To know the birds intimately, to interpret their lives in all their varied conditions, one must get close to them.  For the purpose of accomplishing this object the author of this volume has gone to their haunts day after day and watched them persistently at not a little cost of time, effort, and money.  While the limits of a single volume do not permit him to present all of his observations, it is hoped that those here offered will be satisfactory as far as they go, and that the reader will be able to glean from these pages some new as well as interesting facts relative to bird life.  The writer has had another purpose in view in preparing this book: He wishes to inspire others, especially the young, to use their eyes and ears in the study of the enchanting volume of Nature.  This object, he believes, will be best accomplished by furnishing concrete examples of what may be achieved by earnest research.  For purposes of stimulus an ounce of example is worth a pound of precept.  If another sees you and me doing a thing joyfully, earnestly, we need scarcely say to him, \"Go thou and do likewise.\"  There is not much in the book that is technical, yet it aims at scientific accuracy in all of its statements, no bird being described whose status in the avian system has not been determined.  If strange exploits are sometimes recited, the author has simply to say that he has been veracious in all of his statements, and that all the stories are \"true bird stories.\"  The author modestly believes that it will not be found uninteresting to nature lovers in general.  Much of the material included in this volume has previously appeared in various periodicals, to the publishers of which the writer would hereby make grateful acknowledgment for their courtesy in waiving their copyright privileges.  A number of the journals are given due credit elsewhere in the book.

Almost all persons become interested in some special study, recreation, or pastime, and their choice is not always as profitable as the selection of a specific branch of nature lore would be.  The writer confesses that he would rather pursue a bright, lilting bird or butterfly than a bounding tennis-ball or football, and he finds the chase every whit as exciting and the knowledge gained of more permanent value; and he says this without in anywise intending to discountenance healthful games and athletic exercises, but simply to express a preference.  What could be more fascinating, for instance, than for a young person--or an older person, either, for that matter--to spend his leisure in trying to identify every bird in his neighborhood?  As a result of such an attempt he would doubtless become so interested in the study of his bird neighbors that he would resolve to learn all he could about their charming habits.  How may one study the birds intelligently?  That is a question every beginner will want to have answered.  When I began my bird studies I spent much valuable time in simply trying to learn the _modus operandi_, and while I do not consider the time thus spent entirely wasted, still I am anxious to save my readers as much needless effort as possible.  This I shall do by showing them how they may begin at once to form an acquaintance with the various families and species of birds.  It goes without saying that, to become a successful nature student, one must have good eyes, strong limbs, nimble feet, and, above all, an alert mind.  People who lack these qualities, especially the last, will not be likely to pursue the noble science of ornithology.  The stupid sort will prefer to drowse in the shade, and the light-minded will care only for the gay round of social pleasures.  Any bright and earnest person, however, can in good time become an expert student of the feathered creation, provided only that he feels a genuine interest in such pursuit.  No one, let it be repeated, can study nature successfully in a dull, perfunctory spirit.  Here, as in religion, one must have the baptism of fire, the temper of devotion.  In the study of birds it must be admitted that men and boys have some advantage over their cousins of the gentler sex.  Men folk may ramble pretty much where they please without danger, whereas the freedom of women folk in this respect is somewhat restricted.  However, the engaging works of Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller, of Mrs. Florence M. Bailey, and of many others prove that women are not debarred from outdoor studies, and that in some ways they may even have an advantage over men; they are not so ambitious to cover a wide territory, to penetrate to out-of-the-way haunts, or to roll up a long \"list,\" and they are therefore apt to make more intimate studies of the common species, thus getting into the very heart of the bird's life.  A man's observations may embrace a wider range, and he may add more species to the science of ornithology than his sister, but she will be likely to discover facts about the commonest fowl that he will overlook.  The study of birds, therefore, offers a fascinating field for girls and women as well as for their brothers.  What tools are needed for acquiring bird lore?  To begin at the beginning, let me ask: Who would expect to study the plants and flowers without a botany? or the rocks and fossils and the general structure of the earth without a reliable work on geology? or the planets and stars without a treatise on astronomy?  So, if you desire a knowledge of ornithology, you will need what is known as a bird \"key,\" or \"manual,\" or \"handbook\"--that is, a scientific work that shows how the birds have been classified, with accurate descriptions of all the families, genera, species, subspecies, and varieties, together with the common and scientific names of all the species and brief accounts of their ranges and general habits.  When you have found a plant or a flower that is new to you, what is your first task?  To \"run it down\" in a botanical key.  Just so, having found a feathered stranger, you should note its markings, shape, size, etc., and then \"run it down\" with the aid of a bird manual.  It is much better to run a bird down in this way than to shoot it down.  It is pertinent to say at this time that no one should disparage scientific treatises, or the learned and painstaking people who gather the material for them and prepare them.  It is quite the fashion nowadays, when a \"popular\" book on birds appears, for some reviewers to compare it with the so-called \"dry\" scientific works of the specialists, to the disparagement of the latter.  This is as wrong as it is gratuitous.  The \"popular\" book, delightful as it may be, could not have been written, or, if written, would have had little real value, had it not been for the help obtained from the systematists, who, with almost infinite toil, have made possible the scientific classification of the numerous members of the bird tribe.  Pioneer work in ornithology, as elsewhere, may not be very enchanting to most people, but it is necessary.  The scientific spirit should be honored, not disdained, for without it accuracy would be impossible.  On the other hand, the man who plods with scientific details should not look with contempt upon the man who popularizes the results of technical study by giving it an attractive literary setting.  In short, the scientific writer and the \"popular\" writer are alike worthy of \"honorable mention,\" for both of them are needful factors in the dissemination of knowledge.  You will want to know where a first-rate bird manual can be obtained. It affords me sincere pleasure to recommend two works of the kind that cover the entire avian field for residents of the United States.  They are new, up-to-date, and convenient.  To those who live east of the Mississippi River I would commend Mr. Frank M. Chapman's \"Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America.\"  The best praise I can bestow upon this book is to assure you that it will give entire satisfaction as a handbook.  Happily another manual (Mrs. Florence M. Bailey's \"Handbook of Birds of the Western United States\") was recently issued, treating the avifauna west of the Mississippi just as thoroughly as Mr. Chapman's work deals with that of the eastern part of our country. Both books contain lavish illustrations by expert and accurate bird"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26346"],["title","Our Bird Comrades (#1)"],["body","tists--a feature that is invaluable in the work of identification. They possess a further advantage in not being too large to be carried with you in your excursions afield, enabling you to name each feathered stranger on the spot.  Should you desire a single volume that will help you to identify any bird you may meet on our continent, I would urge you to secure the latest revised edition of Dr. Elliott Coues's \"Key to North American Birds.\"  It is fully illustrated, thoroughly scientific and up-to-date in the matter of classification, and yet not too technical for practical use.  This book is too bulky to be carried with you to the haunts of the birds, but it may be used in this way: Note carefully the markings and other peculiarities of each new bird you meet; then, as soon as you return home, while all the circumstances are fresh in your memory, consult your \"key\" and make sure, if possible, of the identity of all your \"finds.\"  Mr. Robert Ridgway, one of the foremost ornithologists of our country, is now preparing a great work which is worthy of the highest praise. It is entitled \"The Birds of North and Middle America,\" and is the most comprehensive work yet undertaken relative to the avifauna of the entire North American Continent, giving a large amount of scientific data respecting all the species.  After its completion it will enable the student to identify every bird known to science from the Isthmus of Panama to the far North and from the Atlantic to the Pacific.  At this writing two volumes have been issued.  They are published under government auspices by the United States National Museum at Washington, D. C., and may be procured perhaps without cost by writing to the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.  Of this the writer cannot be absolutely sure, as the supply of printed copies may be limited.  Nothing more need be said about bird manuals, save to warn you against spending your money for books which describe only a part of the avifauna of a given region and yet are advertised as serviceable for the identification of all birds.  Unless you have plenty of money to spend, when you buy a manual buy one that is scientifically accurate and complete.  Nothing is more trying to the student of birds, whether tyro or expert, than to encounter a new bird and then fail to find it described or even mentioned in the book that has been foisted upon him as a manual.  In saying this I do not mean to discourage the purchase of the charming popular books written in a literary vein and describing personal observations on bird life, such as the works of John Burroughs, Bradford Torrey, Olive Thorne Miller, and many others. These books, however, are not advertised as handbooks, and thus no one is deceived in buying them.  Even with the best manual in hand, you must not expect to be able to identify every new bird at the first attempt, for some species are either exceedingly shy or obscurely marked, or probably both, while quite a number are so much alike in markings and habits that it is hard to distinguish them from one another.  A few birds remained enigmas to me for a number of years, in spite of the help of the field glass.  At intervals for several months you will often catch provoking glimpses of some nymph-like bird before you succeed in determining its true place in the avian system.  But patience and persistence will some day overcome the most stubborn difficulties.  Since the foregoing references to leading bird manuals were written, a new work, which is unique in plan, has been published.  I refer to the book entitled \"Color Key to North American Birds\"; text by Frank M. Chapman, pictures by Chester A. Reed.  The range of the volume is from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean and from the southern boundary of the United States to the far north.  It contains a brief description of every species and sub-species within the limits named; a key to all the Orders and Families, with the common and scientific names of all the birds; an introduction to every chief division; and last, and highly important, colored pictures of all the species and many of the geographical varieties.  What more can the bird student desire for purposes of identification?  While the other manuals give fuller descriptions of habits, songs, etc., and need not, therefore, be superseded by this volume, yet frankness forces us to say that if the student, and especially the beginner, cannot afford to buy more than one bird book, the Chapman-Reed \"Color Key\" is the one to get.  It is of a convenient size for carrying afield, so that a feathered stranger can be identified on the spot.  It can be used anywhere in the United States, in British America, and Alaska.  Think of that, fellow bird-lovers!  A good field glass is indispensable to successful bird study, especially if you desire to name all the birds without killing any, as I hope you do.  Perhaps the older ornithologists, like Audubon and Wilson, did not use helps of this kind, but they used guns, and consequently had to study dead birds, while you and I want to study living ones.  Their killing of birds was, indeed, necessary, for purposes of scientific classification; but now that such classifying has, for the most part, been attained, the gun has largely gone out of vogue, and the glass has taken its place.  Let your alliterative motto be: _With the glass, not the gun_.  I would advise you not to buy a flashily colored glass, for it will dazzle your eyes on sunshiny days.  Be sure to get one that is easily focused, as you must be quick in studying such shy creatures as the birds.  At first the glass may strain and tire your eyes, but that difficulty will pass in a short time.  Expertness will soon be won in the use of a binocular, so that you will be able, almost instantly, to get the desired object within its field, even though the object be quite tiny.  An opera glass is a great deal better than no glass at all; a field glass is better still, and a Bausch & Lomb binocular of six to eight magnifying power is the best of all; being almost equal to having the bird in hand.  The observer must lose as little time as possible in sighting a shy bird, or it may escape him altogether.  A book-bag or haversack, strapped around your shoulders, will also be a convenience.  In it you can stow your bird manual, and a luncheon in case you expect to spend the whole day in the open, for a hungry rambler is not likely to be an acute observer.  A notebook and a lead pencil, carried in handy pockets, should not be forgotten.  Donning an old suit of clothes, you can roam where you will, threading your way through brier and bush, wading the bog or the shallow stream, dropping upon your knees, even flinging yourself upon the ground, to spy upon a wary bird flitting about in the copse.  In almost all kinds of weather I wear rubber boots in my excursions to the haunts of the birds.  The observer can never tell when he may have to wade a stream or tramp through a boggy marsh.  In wet and cold weather the need of rubber boots can be seen readily, but even in dry and warm weather they have one decided advantage--they do not become slippery on the soles as one tramps through the leaf-strewn woods or the grassy fields.  Every pedestrian knows that sole-leather is apt to become as smooth as glass, making it difficult to retain one's footing. On the other hand, rubber seems to cling to the ground, no matter how much it is worn.  The only objection to rubbers is that they are uncomfortably warm in hot weather; but that difficulty can be overcome by frequently plunging into a cool stream and standing there for several minutes.  Let me caution you, however, not to purchase a _heavy_ pair of rubber boots.  Insist on having a light pair or none at all.  A good pair of rubber boots are a real luxury, for with them you may tramp about in all kinds of damp and boggy places without fear of wetting your feet, though it goes without saying that you must be careful not to wade in over the tops of your footgear.  Of great assistance to the pedestrian is a light cane.  In climbing Pikes Peak one evening after dark, I doubt whether I should have been able to gain the summit had it not been for my tough little wild-cherry cane, upon which I could lean when almost exhausted, which supported my faltering steps, and which happily never grew weary.  Two years later it helped me to scale a number of snow-capped mountains, among them Grays Peak and Peak Number Eight of the Ten Mile Range.  Indeed, my little cane was of so much service to me that I came to look upon it as a personal friend that cared almost as much for me as I did for it.  It pushed aside thorny bushes and nettlesome weeds when I was looking for nests, thus saving my hands many a painful wound.  And more than one serpent, including the rattlesnake, has had his head crushed or his spine broken by sturdy blows from my little wild-cherry cane.  I should add that it had a hooked handle, so that I could hang it on the strap of my haversack when I needed both hands.  In the beginning of your observations you will find the work of identifying the birds a rare and exciting pleasure; then, after you have named all the species in your neighborhood, it will be no less delightful to study their interesting ways, or to extend your researches to other fields.  And if at any time you observe some odd bits of bird behavior which you think will be news to the many bird lovers the world over, why should you not report them to one of the bird magazines, so that others may share the pleasures of your discoveries?  An admirer of feathered folk should not be selfish; indeed, I do not see how he can be.  It simply remains to be said that this volume is an illustration of the method of bird study just indicated.  In the first place, I shall show, in a few chapters, how the student goes about his work of identifying species and making new bird friends; then will follow a number of monographs"]]]
