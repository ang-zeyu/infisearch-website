A moment before there had been several cabs discharging their loads at the steps; now the last had rolled away empty.  \"You might find one inside the station by the arrival platform,\" he suggested; \"but there'll be sure to be one comin' up here in another minute, sir, if you like to wait.\"  Paul thought the other course might be the longer one, and decided to stay where he was. So he walked into the lofty hall in which the booking offices are placed and waited there by the huge fire that blazed in the stove until he should hear the cab arrive which could take him back to Westbourne Terrace.  One or two trains were about to start, and the place was full. There were several Cambridge men \"going up\" after the Christmas vacation, in every variety of ulster; some tugging at refractory white terriers, one or two entrusting bicycles to dubious porters with many cautions and directions. There were burly old farmers going back to their quiet countryside, flushed with the prestige of a successful stand under cross-examination in some witness-box at the Law Courts; to tell and retell the story over hill and dale, in the market-place and bar-parlour, every week for the rest of their honest lives. There was the usual pantomime \"rally\" on a mild scale, with real frantic passengers, and porters, and trucks, and trays of lighted lamps.  Presently, out of the crowd and confusion, a small boy in a thick pilot jacket and an immensely tall hat, whom Paul had observed looking at him intently for some time, walked up to the stove and greeted him familiarly.  \"Hallo, Bultitude!\" he said, \"I thought it was you. Here we are again, eh? Ugh!\" and he giggled dismally.  He was a pale-faced boy with freckles, very light green eyes, long, rather ragged black hair, a slouching walk, and a smile half-simpering, half-impudent.  Mr. Bultitude was greatly staggered by the presumption of so small a boy venturing to address him in this way. He could only stare haughtily.  \"You might find a word to say to a fellow!\" said the boy in an aggrieved tone. \"Look here; come and get your luggage labelled.\"  \"I don't want it labelled,\" said Paul stiffly, feeling bound to say something. \"I'm waiting for a cab to take me home again.\"  The other gave a loud whistle. \"That'll make it rather a short term, won't it, if you're going home for the holidays already? You're a cool chap, Bultitude! If I were to go back to my governor now, he wouldn't see it. It would put him in no end of a bait. But you're chaffing----\"  Paul walked away from him with marked coolness. He was not going to trouble himself to talk to his son's schoolfellows.  \"Aren't you well?\" said the boy, not at all discouraged by his reception, following him and taking his arm. \"Down in the mouth? It is beastly, isn't it, having to go back to old Grimstone's! The snow gave us an extra week, though--we've that much to be thankful for. I wish it was the first day of the holidays again, don't you? What's the matter with you? What have I done to put you in a wax?\"  \"Nothing at present,\" said Paul. \"I don't speak to you merely because I don't happen to have the--ah--pleasure of your acquaintance.\"  \"Oh, very well, then; I daresay you know best,\" said the other huffily. \"Only I thought--considering we came the same half, and have been chums, and always sat next one another ever since--you might perhaps just recollect having met me before, you know.\"  \"Well, I don't,\" said Mr. Bultitude. \"I tell you I haven't the least idea what your name is. The fact is there has been a slight mistake, which I can't stop to talk about now. There's a cab just driven up outside now. You must excuse me, really, my boy, I want to go.\"  He tried to work his arm free from the close and affectionate grip of his unwelcome companion, who was regarding him with a sort of admiring leer.  \"What a fellow you are, Bultitude!\" he said; \"always up to something or other. You know me well enough. What is the use of keeping it up any longer? Let's talk, and stop humbugging. How much grub have you brought back this time?\"  To be advised to stop humbugging, and be persecuted with such idle questions as these, maddened the poor gentleman. A hansom really had rolled up to the steps outside. He must put an end to this waste of precious time, and escape from this highly inconvenient small boy.  He forced his way to the door, the boy still keeping fast hold of his arm. Fortunately the cab was still there, and its late occupant, a tall, broad man, was standing with his back to them paying the driver. Paul was only just in time.  \"Porter!\" he cried. \"Where's that porter? I want my box put on that cab. No, I don't care about the luggage; engage the cab. Now, you little ruffian, are you going to let me go? Can't you see I'm anxious to get away?\"  Jolland giggled more impishly than ever. \"Well, you _have_ got cheek!\" he said. \"Go on, I wish you may get that cab, I'm sure!\"  Paul, thus released, was just hurrying towards the cab, when the stranger who had got out of it settled the fare with satisfaction to himself and turned sharply round.  The gas-light fell full on his face, and Mr. Bultitude recognised that the form and features were those of no stranger--he had stumbled upon the very last person he had expected or desired to meet just then--his flight was intercepted by his son's schoolmaster, Dr. Grimstone himself!  The suddenness of the shock threw him completely off his balance. In an ordinary way the encounter would not of course have discomposed him, but now he would have given worlds for presence of mind enough either to rush past to the cab and secure his only chance of freedom before the Doctor had fully realised his intention, or else greet him affably and calmly, and, taking him quietly aside, explain his awkward position with an easy man-of-the-world air, which would ensure instant conviction.  But both courses were equally impossible. He stood there, right in Dr. Grimstone's path, with terrified starting eyes and quivering limbs, more like an unhappy guinea-pig expecting the advances of a boa, than a British merchant in the presence of his son's schoolmaster! He was sick and faint with alarm, and the consciousness that appearances were all against him.  There was nothing in the least extraordinary in the fact of the Doctor's presence at the station. Mr. Bultitude might easily have taken this into account as a very likely contingency and have provided accordingly, had he troubled to think, for it was Dr. Grimstone's custom, upon the first day of the term, to come up to town and meet as many of his pupils upon the platform as intended to return by a train previously specified at the foot of the school-bills; and Paul had even expressly insisted upon Dick's travelling under surveillance in this manner, thinking it necessary to keep him out of premature mischief.  It makes a calamity doubly hard to bear when one looks back and sees by what a trivial chance it has come upon us, and how slight an effort would have averted it altogether; and Mr. Bultitude cursed his own stupidity as he stood there, rooted to the ground, and saw the hansom (a \"patent safety\" to him in sober earnest) drive off and abandon him to his fate.  Dr. Grimstone bore down heavily upon him and Jolland, who had by this time come up. He was a tall and imposing personage, with a strong black beard and small angry grey eyes, slightly blood-tinged; he wore garments of a semi-clerical cut and colour, though he was not in orders. He held out a hand to each with elaborate geniality.  \"Ha, Bultitude, my boy, how are you? How are you, Jolland? Come back braced in body and mind by your vacation, eh? That's as it should be. Have you tickets? No? follow me then. You're both over age, I believe. There you are; take care of them.\"  And before Paul could protest, he had purchased tickets for all three, after which he laid an authoritative hand upon Mr. Bultitude's shoulder and walked him out through the booking hall upon the platform.  \"This is awful,\" thought Paul, shrinking involuntarily; \"simply awful. He evidently has no idea who I really am. Unless I'm very careful I shall be dragged off to Crichton House before I can put him right. If I could only get him away alone somewhere.\"  As if in answer to the wish, the Doctor guided him by a slight pressure straight along by the end of the station, saying to Jolland as he did so, \"I wish to have a little serious conversation with Richard in private. Suppose you go to the bookstall and see if you can find out any of our young friends. Tell them to wait for me there.\"  When they were alone the Doctor paced solemnly along in silence for some moments, while Paul, who had always been used to consider himself a fairly prominent object, whatever might be his surroundings, began to feel an altogether novel sensation of utter insignificance upon that immense brown plain of platform and under the huge span of the arches whose girders were lost in wreaths of mingled fog and smoke.  Still he had some hope. Was it not possible, after all, that the Doctor had divined his secret and was searching for words delicate enough to convey his condolences?  \"I wished to tell you, Bultitude,\" said the Doctor presently, and his first words dashed all Paul's rising hopes, \"that I hope you are returning this term with the resolve to do better things. You have caused your excellent father much pain in the past. You little know the grief a wilful boy can inflict on his parent.\"  \"I think I have a very fair idea of it,\" thought Paul, but he said nothing.  \"I hope you left him in good health? Such a devoted parent, Richard--such a noble heart!\"  At any other time Mr. Bultitude might have felt gratified by these eulogies, but just then he was conscious that he could lay no claim to them. It was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26853"],["title","Vice Versa; or, A Lesson to Fathers (#8)"],["body","who had the noble heart now, and he himself felt even less of a devoted parent than he looked.  \"I had a letter from him during the vacation,\" continued Dr. Grimstone, \"a sweet letter, Richard, breathing in every line a father's anxiety and concern for your welfare.\"  Paul was a little staggered. He remembered having written, but he would scarcely perhaps have described his letter as \"sweet,\" as he had not done much more than enclose a cheque for his son's account and object to the items for pew-rent and scientific lectures with the diorama as excessive.  \"But--and this is what I wanted to say to you, Bultitude--his is no blind doting affection. He has implored me, for your own sake, if I see you diverging ever so slightly from the path of duty, not to stay my hand. And I shall not forget his injunctions.\"  A few minutes ago, and it would have seemed to Paul so simple and easy a matter to point out to the Doctor the very excusable error into which he had fallen. It was no more than he would have to do repeatedly upon his return, and here was an excellent opportunity for an explanation.  But, somehow the words would not come. The schoolmaster's form seemed so tremendous and towering, and he so feeble and powerless before him, that he soon persuaded himself that a public place, like a station platform, was no scene for domestic revelations of so painful a character.  He gave up all idea of resistance at present. \"Perhaps I had better leave him in his error till we get into the train,\" he thought; \"then we will get rid of that other boy, and I can break it to him gradually in the railway carriage as I get more accustomed to him.\"  But in spite of his determination to unbosom himself without further delay, he knew that a kind of fascinated resignation was growing upon him and gaining firmer hold each minute.  Something must be done to break the spell and burst the toils which were being woven round him before all effort became impossible.  \"And now,\" said the Doctor, glancing up at the great clock-face on which a reflector cast a patch of dim yellow light, \"we must be thinking of starting. But don't forget what I have said.\"  And they walked back towards the book-stalls with their cheery warmth of colour, past the glittering buffet, and on up the platform, to a part where six boys of various sizes were standing huddled forlornly together under a gaslight.  \"Aha!\" said Dr. Grimstone, with a slight touch of the ogre in his tone, \"more of my fellows, eh? We shall be quite a party. How do you do, boys? Welcome back to your studies.\"  And the six boys came forward, all evidently in the lowest spirits, and raised their tall hats with a studied politeness.  \"Some old friends here, Bultitude,\" said the Doctor, impelling the unwilling Paul towards the group. \"You know Tipping, of course; Coker, too, you've met before--and Coggs. How are you, Siggers? You're looking well. Ah, by the way, I see a new face--Kiffin, I think? Kiffin, this is Bultitude, who will make himself your mentor, I hope, and initiate you into our various manners and customs.\"  And, with a horrible dream-like sense of unreality, Mr. Bultitude found himself being greeted by several entire strangers with a degree of warmth embarrassing in the extreme.  He would have liked to protest and declare himself there and then in his true colours, but if this had been difficult alone with the Doctor under the clock, it was impossible now, and he submitted ruefully enough to their unwelcome advances.  Tipping, a tall, red-haired, raw-boned boy, with sleeves and trousers he had outgrown, and immense boots, wrung Paul's hand with misdirected energy, saying \"how-de-do?\" with a gruff superiority, mercifully tempered by a touch of sheepishness.  Coggs and Coker welcomed him with open arms as an equal, while Siggers, a short, slight, sharp-featured boy, with a very fashionable hat and shirt-collars, and a horse-shoe pin, drawled, \"How are you, old boy?\" with the languor of a confirmed man about town.  The other two were Biddlecomb, a boy with a blooming complexion and a singularly sweet voice, and the new-comer, Kiffin, who did not seem much more at home in the society of other boys than Mr. Bultitude himself, for he kept nervously away from them, shivering with the piteous self-abandonment of an Italian greyhound.  Paul was now convinced that unless he exerted himself considerably, his identity with his son would never even be questioned, and the danger roused him to a sudden determination.  However his face and figure might belie him, nothing in his speech or conduct should encourage the mistake. Whatever it might cost him to overcome his fear of the Doctor, he would force himself to act and talk ostentatiously, as much like his own ordinary self as possible, during the journey down to Market Rodwell, so as to prepare the Doctor's mind for the disclosures he meant to make at the earliest opportunity. He was beginning to see that the railway carriage, with all those boys sitting by and staring, would be an inconvenient place for so delicate and difficult a confession.  The guard having warned intending passengers to take their seats, and Jolland, who had been unaccountably missing all this time, having appeared from the direction of the refreshment buffet, furtively brushing away some suspicious-looking flakes and crumbs from his coat, and contrived to join the party unperceived, they all got into a first-class compartment--Paul with the rest.  He longed for moral courage to stand out boldly and refuse to leave town, but, as we have seen, it was beyond his powers, and he temporised. Very soon the whistle had sounded and the train had begun to glide slowly out beyond the platform and arch, past the signal boxes and long low sheds and offices which are the suburbs of a large terminus--and then it was too late.     4. _A Minnow amongst Tritons_       \"Boys are capital fellows in their own way among their mates; but      they are unwholesome companions for grown people.\"--_Essays of      Elia._   For some time after they were fairly started the Doctor read his evening paper with an air of impartial but severe criticism, and Mr. Bultitude as he sat opposite him next to the window, found himself overwhelmed with a new and very unpleasant timidity.  He knew that, if he would free himself, this utterly unreasonable feeling must be wrestled with and overcome; that now, if ever, was the time to assert himself, and prove that he was anything but the raw youth he was conscious of appearing. He had merely to speak and act, too, in his ordinary everyday manner; to forget as far as possible the change that had affected his outer man, which was not so very difficult to do after all--and yet his heart sank lower and lower as each fresh telegraph post flitted past.  \"I will let him speak first,\" he thought; \"then I shall be able to feel my way.\" But there was more fear than caution in the resolve.  At last, however, the Doctor laid down his paper, and, looking round with the glance of proprietorship on his pupils, who had relapsed into a decorous and gloomy silence, observed: \"Well, boys, you have had an unusually protracted vacation this time--owing to the unprecedented severity of the weather. We must try to make up for it by the zest and ardour with which we pursue our studies during the term. I intend to reduce the Easter holidays by a week by way of compensation.\"  This announcement (which by no means relieved the general depression--the boys receiving it with a sickly interest) was good news to Paul, and even had the effect of making him forget his position for the time.  \"I'm uncommonly glad to hear it, Dr. Grimstone,\" he said heartily, \"an excellent arrangement. Boys have too many holidays as it is. There's no reason, to my mind, why parents should be the sufferers by every snowstorm. It's no joke, I can assure you, to have a great idle boy hanging about the place eating his empty head off!\"  A burglar enlarging upon the sanctity of the law of property, or a sheep exposing the fallacies of vegetarianism, could hardly have produced a greater sensation.  Every boy was roused from his languor to stare and wonder at these traitorous sentiments, which, from the mouth of any but a known and tried companion, would have roused bitter hostility and contempt. As it was, their wonder became a rapturous admiration, and they waited for the situation to develop with a fearful and secret joy.  It was some time before the Doctor quite recovered himself; then he said with a grim smile, \"This is indeed finding Saul amongst the prophets; your sentiments, if sincere, Bultitude--I repeat, if sincere--are very creditable. But I am obliged to look upon them with suspicion!\" Then, as if to dismiss a doubtful subject, he inquired generally, \"And how have you all been spending your holidays, eh!\"  There was no attempt to answer this question, it being felt probably that it was, like the conventional \"How do you do?\" one to which an answer is neither desired nor expected, especially as he continued almost immediately, \"I took my boy Tom up to town the week before Christmas to see the representation of the 'Agamemnon' at St. George's Hall. The 'Agamemnon,' as most of you are doubtless aware, is a drama by Æschylus, a Greek poet of established reputation. I was much pleased by the intelligent appreciation Tom showed during the performance. He distinctly recognised several words from his Greek Grammar in the course of the dialogue.\"  No one seemed capable of responding except Mr. Bultitude, who dashed into the breach with an almost pathetic effort to maintain his accustomed stiffness.  \"I may be old-fashioned,\" he said, \"very likely I am; but I--ah--decidedly disapprove of taking children to dramatic exhibitions of any kind. It unsettles them, sir--unsettles them!\"  Dr. Grimstone made no answer, but he put a hand on each knee, and glared with pursed lips and a leonine bristle of the beard at his youthful"]]]
