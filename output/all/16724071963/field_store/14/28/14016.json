They tried frantically to resume the communication that had been broken off. Suspecting that Sergeant Bellews had shifted controls, they essayed to shift them back. The communicator which was Betsy's factory twin went into sine-wave standby-modulation, and suddenly smoked all over and was wrecked. The wave-generator went into hysterics and produced nothing whatever. Then there was nothing to do but pull Sergeant Bellews out of the clink and order him to do the whole business all over again.  \"I can't,\" said Sergeant Bellews indignantly. \"It can't be done. Those guys are busy buildin' a transmitter according to the diagram Doc Graves gave them. They won't pay no attention to anything until they'd tried to chat with their great-great-great-grand-children in 3020. They were phonys, anyhow! Pretendin' to be in 2180 and not knowin' what Mahon units could do!\"  Lecky and Graves and Howell were even less satisfactory. They couldn't pretend even to try what the questioning-teams from the Pentagon wanted them to do. And Betsy remained silent, receiving nothing, and Gus and Al waited meditatively for something to unscramble, and nothing turned up.  And then, at 3:00 P.M. Greenwich mean time, on August 9, 1972, nearly every operating communicator in the fringe of free nations around the territory of the Union of Communist Republics--all communicators blew out.  There were only four men in the world who really knew why--Sergeant Bellews and Lecky and Graves and Howell. They knew that somewhere behind the Iron Curtain a twenty-kilowatt transmitter had been turned on. It produced a wave of the type and with the characteristics that would have been produced by a transmitter built from the diagram sent through Betsy and Al and Gus for people in the United States to build. Obviously, it had been built from Graves' diagram broadcast to somewhere else and it broadcast what the United States had been urged to broadcast.         *       *       *       *       *  It blew itself out instantly, of course. The wave it produced would stop any dynamic system at once, including its own. But it hit Stockholm and traffic jammed as the dynamic systems of cars in operation were destroyed. In Gibraltar, the signal-systems of the Rock went dead. All around the fringe of the armed Communist republics machines stopped and communications ended and very many persons with heart conditions died very quietly. Because their dynamic systems were least stable. But healthy people--like Mahon-modified machines--had great resistance ... outside the Iron Curtain.  There was, though, almost a vacuum of news and mechanical operations at the rim of a nearly perfect circle some four thousand miles in diameter, whose center was in a Compub research installation.  It was very bad. Such a panic as had never been known before swept the free world. Some mysterious weapon, it was felt, had been used to cripple those who would resist invasion, and the Compub armed forces would shortly be on the march, and Armageddon was at hand. The free world prepared to die fighting.  But war did not come. Nothing happened at all. In three days there were sketchy communications almost everywhere outside that monstrous circle of silence. But nothing came out of that circle. Nothing.  In two weeks, exploring parties cautiously crossed the barbed-wire frontier fences to find out what had happened. Those who went farthest came back shaken and sick. There were survivors in the Compubs, of course. Especially near the fringes of the circle. There were some millions of survivors. But there was no longer a nation to be called the Union of Communist Republics. There were only frightened, starving people trudging blindly away from cities that were charnel-houses and machines that would not run and trees and crops and grasses that were stark dead where they stood. It would be a long time before anybody would want to cross those lifeless plains and enter the places which once had been swarming hives of homes and people.         *       *       *       *       *  And presently, of course, Sergeant Bellews was let out of the guardhouse. He could not be charged with any crime. Nor could Graves nor Lecky nor Howell. They were asked, confidentially, to keep their mouths shut. Which they would have done anyhow. And Sergeant Bellews was asked with reluctant respectfulness, just what he thought had really happened.  \"Some guys got too smart,\" he said, fuming. \"A guy that'll broadcast a wave that'll wreck machines ... I haven't got any kinda use for him! Dammit, when a machine treats you accordin' to the golden rule, you oughta treat it the same way!\"  There were other, also-respectful questions.  \"How the hell would I know?\" demanded Sergeant Bellews wrathfully. \"It coulda been that we did make contact with 2180, and they were smart an' told the Compubs to try out what we told 'em. But I don't believe it. It coulda been a kinda monster from some other planet wanting us wiped out. But he learned him a lesson, if he did! And o' course, it coulda been the Compubs themselves, trying to fool us into committing suicide so they'd--uh--inherit the earth. I wouldn't know! But I bet there ain't any more broadcasts from nowhere!\"  He was allowed to return to the Rehab Shop, and the flickering standby lights of many Mahon-modified machines seemed to glow more warmly as he moved among them.  And he was right about there not being any more broadcasts from nowhere.  There weren't.  Not ever."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2618"],["title","A House-Boat on the Styx (#0)"],["body","from the 1902 Harper and Brothers edition by David Price, email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk      A HOUSE-BOAT ON THE STYX by John Kendrick Bangs   CHAPTER I: CHARON MAKES A DISCOVERY   Charon, the Ferryman of renown, was cruising slowly along the Styx one pleasant Friday morning not long ago, and as he paddled idly on he chuckled mildly to himself as he thought of the monopoly in ferriage which in the course of years he had managed to build up.  \"It's a great thing,\" he said, with a smirk of satisfaction--\"it's a great thing to be the go-between between two states of being; to have the exclusive franchise to export and import shades from one state to the other, and withal to have had as clean a record as mine has been. Valuable as is my franchise, I never corrupted a public official in my life, and--\"  Here Charon stopped his soliloquy and his boat simultaneously.  As he rounded one of the many turns in the river a singular object met his gaze, and one, too, that filled him with misgiving.  It was another craft, and that was a thing not to be tolerated.  Had he, Charon, owned the exclusive right of way on the Styx all these years to have it disputed here in the closing decade of the Nineteenth Century?  Had not he dealt satisfactorily with all, whether it was in the line of ferriage or in the providing of boats for pleasure-trips up the river?  Had he not received expressions of satisfaction, indeed, from the most exclusive families of Hades with the very select series of picnics he had given at Charon's Glen Island?  No wonder, then, that the queer-looking boat that met his gaze, moored in a shady nook on the dark side of the river, filled him with dismay.  \"Blow me for a landlubber if I like that!\" he said, in a hardly audible whisper.  \"And shiver my timbers if I don't find out what she's there for.  If anybody thinks he can run an opposition line to mine on this river he's mightily mistaken.  If it comes to competition, I can carry shades for nothing and still quaff the B. & G. yellow-label benzine three times a day without experiencing a financial panic.  I'll show 'em a thing or two if they attempt to rival me.  And what a boat!  It looks for all the world like a Florentine barn on a canal-boat.\"  Charon paddled up to the side of the craft, and, standing up in the middle of his boat, cried out,  \"Ship ahoy!\"  There was no answer, and the Ferryman hailed her again.  Receiving no response to his second call, he resolved to investigate for himself; so, fastening his own boat to the stern-post of the stranger, he clambered on board.  If he was astonished as he sat in his ferry-boat, he was paralyzed when he cast his eye over the unwelcome vessel he had boarded. He stood for at least two minutes rooted to the spot.  His eye swept over a long, broad deck, the polish of which resembled that of a ball-room floor.  Amidships, running from three-quarters aft to three-quarters forward, stood a structure that in its lines resembled, as Charon had intimated, a barn, designed by an architect enamoured of Florentine simplicity; but in its construction the richest of woods had been used, and in its interior arrangement and adornment nothing more palatial could be conceived.  \"What's the blooming thing for?\" said Charon, more dismayed than ever. \"If they start another line with a craft like this, I'm very much afraid I'm done for after all.  I wouldn't take a boat like mine myself if there was a floating palace like this going the same way.  I'll have to see the Commissioners about this, and find out what it all means.  I suppose it'll cost me a pretty penny, too, confound them!\"  A prey to these unhappy reflections, Charon investigated further, and the more he saw the less he liked it.  He was about to encounter opposition, and an opposition which was apparently backed by persons of great wealth--perhaps the Commissioners themselves.  It was a consoling thought that he had saved enough money in the course of his career to enable him to live in comfort all his days, but this was not really what Charon was after.  He wished to acquire enough to retire and become one of the smart set.  It had been done in that section of the universe which lay on the bright side of the Styx, why not, therefore, on the other, he asked.  \"I'm pretty well connected even if I am a boatman,\" he had been known to say.  \"With Chaos for a grandfather, and Erebus and Nox for parents, I've just as good blood in my veins as anybody in Hades.  The Noxes are a mighty fine family, not as bright as the Days, but older; and we're poor--that's it, poor--and it's money makes caste these days.  If I had millions, and owned a railroad, they'd call me a yacht-owner.  As I haven't, I'm only a boatman.  Bah!  Wait and see!  I'll be giving swell functions myself some day, and these upstarts will be on their knees before me begging to be asked.  Then I'll get up a little aristocracy of my own, and I won't let a soul into it whose name isn't mentioned in the Grecian mythologies.  Mention in Burke's peerage and the Elite directories of America won't admit anybody to Commodore Charon's house unless there's some other mighty good reason for it.\"  Foreseeing an unhappy ending to all his hopes, the old man clambered sadly back into his ancient vessel and paddled off into the darkness. Some hours later, returning with a large company of new arrivals, while counting up the profits of the day Charon again caught sight of the new craft, and saw that it was brilliantly lighted and thronged with the most famous citizens of the Erebean country.  Up in the bow was a spirit band discoursing music of the sweetest sort.  Merry peals of laughter rang out over the dark waters of the Styx.  The clink of glasses and the popping of corks punctuated the music with a frequency which would have delighted the soul of the most ardent lover of commas, all of which so overpowered the grand master boatman of the Stygian Ferry Company that he dropped three oboli and an American dime, which he carried as a pocket-piece, overboard.  This, of course, added to his woe; but it was forgotten in an instant, for some one on the new boat had turned a search-light directly upon Charon himself, and simultaneously hailed the master of the ferry- boat.  \"Charon!\" cried the shade in charge of the light.  \"Charon, ahoy!\"  \"Ahoy yourself!\" returned the old man, paddling his craft close up to the stranger.  \"What do you want?\"  \"You,\" said the shade.  \"The house committee want to see you right away.\"  \"What for?\" asked Charon, cautiously.  \"I'm sure I don't know.  I'm only a member of the club, and house committees never let mere members know anything about their plans.  All I know is that you are wanted,\" said the other.  \"Who are the house committee?\" queried the Ferryman.  \"Sir Walter Raleigh, Cassius, Demosthenes, Blackstone, Doctor Johnson, and Confucius,\" replied the shade.  \"Tell 'em I'll be back in an hour,\" said Charon, pushing off.  \"I've got a cargo of shades on board consigned to various places up the river.  I've promised to get 'em all through to-night, but I'll put on a couple of extra paddles--two of the new arrivals are working their passage this trip--and it won't take as long as usual.  What boat is this, anyhow?\"  \"The _Nancy Nox_, of Erebus.\"  \"Thunder!\" cried Charon, as he pushed off and proceeded on his way up the river.  \"Named after my mother!  Perhaps it'll come out all right yet.\"  More hopeful of mood, Charon, aided by the two dead-head passengers, soon got through with his evening's work, and in less than an hour was back seeking admittance, as requested, to the company of Sir Walter Raleigh and his fellow-members on the house committee.  He was received by these worthies with considerable effusiveness, considering his position in society, and it warmed the cockles of his aged heart to note that Sir Walter, who had always been rather distant to him since he had carelessly upset that worthy and Queen Elizabeth in the middle of the Styx far back in the last century, permitted him to shake three fingers of his left hand when he entered the committee-room.  \"How do you do, Charon?\" said Sir Walter, affably.  \"We are very glad to see you.\"  \"Thank you, kindly, Sir Walter,\" said the boatman.  \"I'm glad to hear those words, your honor, for I've been feeling very bad since I had the misfortune to drop your Excellency and her Majesty overboard.  I never knew how it happened, sir, but happen it did, and but for her Majesty's kind assistance it might have been the worse for us.  Eh, Sir Walter?\"  The knight shook his head menacingly at Charon.  Hitherto he had managed to keep it a secret that the Queen had rescued him from drowning upon that occasion by swimming ashore herself first and throwing Sir Walter her ruff as soon as she landed, which he had used as a life-preserver.  \"'Sh!\" he said, _sotto voce_.  \"Don't say anything about that, my man.\"  \"Very well, Sir Walter, I won't,\" said the boatman; but he made a mental note of the knight's agitation, and perceived a means by which that illustrious courtier could be made useful to him in his scheming for social advancement.  \"I understood you had something to say to me,\" said Charon, after he had greeted the others.  \"We have,\" said Sir Walter.  \"We want you to assume command of this boat.\"  The old fellow's eyes lighted up with pleasure.  \"You want a captain, eh?\" he said.  \"No,\" said Confucius, tapping the table with a diamond-studded chop-stick.  \"No.  We want a--er--what the deuce is it they call the functionary, Cassius?\"  \"Senator, I think,\" said Cassius.  Demosthenes gave a loud laugh.  \"Your mind is still running on Senatorships, my dear Cassius.  That is quite evident,\" he said.  \"This is not one of them, however.  The title we wish Charon to assume is neither Captain nor Senator; it is Janitor.\"  \"What's that?\" asked Charon, a little disappointed.  \"What does a Janitor have to do?\"  \"He has to look after things in the house,\" "]]]
