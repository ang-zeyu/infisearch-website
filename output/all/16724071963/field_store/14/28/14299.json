Davy, however, whose important discoveries have opened such improved views in chemistry, has suggested an hypothesis which may throw great light upon that science. He supposes that there are two kinds of electricity, with one or other of which all bodies are united. These we distinguish by the names of _positive_ and _negative_ electricity; those bodies are disposed to combine, which possess opposite electricities, as they are brought together by the attraction which these electricities have for each other. But, whether this hypothesis be altogether founded on truth or not, it is impossible to question the great influence of electricity in chemical combinations.  EMILY.  So, that we must suppose that the two electricities always attract each other, and thus compel the bodies in which they exist to combine?  CAROLINE.  And may not this be also the cause of the attraction of cohesion?  MRS. B.  No, for in particles of the same nature the same electricities must prevail, and it is only the different or opposite electric fluids that attract each other.  CAROLINE.  These electricities seem to me to be a kind of chemical spirit, which animates the particles of bodies, and draws them together.  EMILY.  If it is known, then, with which of the electricities bodies are united, it can be inferred which will, and which will not, combine together?  MRS. B.  Certainly. --I should not omit to mention, that some doubts have been entertained whether electricity be really a material agent, or whether it might not be a power inherent in bodies, similar to, or, perhaps identical with, attraction.  EMILY.  But what then would be the electric spark which is visible, and must therefore be really material?  MRS. B.  What we call the electric spark, may, Sir H. Davy says, be merely the heat and light, or fire produced by the chemical combinations with which these phenomena are always connected. We will not, however, enter more fully on this important subject at present, but reserve the principal facts which relate to it to a future conversation.  Before we part, however, I must recommend you to fix in your memory the names of the simple bodies, against our next interview.     CONVERSATION II.  ON LIGHT AND HEAT OR CALORIC.   CAROLINE.  We have learned by heart the names of all the simple bodies which you have enumerated, and we are now ready to enter on the examination of each of them successively. You will begin, I suppose, with LIGHT?  MRS. B.  Respecting the nature of light we have little more than conjectures. It is considered by most philosophers as a real substance, immediately emanating from the sun, and from all luminous bodies, from which it is projected in right lines with prodigious velocity. Light, however, being imponderable, it cannot be confined and examined by itself; and therefore it is to the effects it produces on other bodies, rather than to its immediate nature, that we must direct our attention.  The connection between light and heat is very obvious; indeed, it is such, that it is extremely difficult to examine the one independently of the other.  EMILY.  But, is it possible to separate light from heat; I thought they were only different degrees of the same thing, fire?  MRS. B.  I told you that fire was not now considered as a simple element. Whether light and heat be altogether different agents, or not, I cannot pretend to decide; but, in many cases, light may be separated from heat. The first discovery of this was made by a celebrated Swedish chemist, Scheele. Another very striking illustration of the separation of heat and light was long after pointed out by Dr. Herschell. This philosopher discovered that these two agents were emitted in the rays of the sun, and that heat was less refrangible than light; for, in separating the different coloured rays of light by a prism (as we did some time ago), he found that the greatest heat was beyond the spectrum, at a little distance from the red rays, which, you may recollect, are the least refrangible.  EMILY.  I should like to try that experiment.  MRS. B.  It is by no means an easy one: the heat of a ray of light, refracted by a prism, is so small, that it requires a very delicate thermometer to distinguish the difference of the degree of heat within and without the spectrum. For in this experiment the heat is not totally separated from the light, each coloured ray retaining a certain portion of it, though the greatest part is not sufficiently refracted to fall within the spectrum.  EMILY.  I suppose, then, that those coloured rays which are the least refrangible, retain the greatest quantity of heat?  MRS. B.  They do so.  EMILY.  Though I no longer doubt that light and heat can be separated, Dr. Herschell’s experiment does not appear to me to afford sufficient proof that they are essentially different; for light, which you call a simple body, may likewise be divided into the various coloured rays.  MRS. B.  No doubt there must be some difference in the various coloured rays. Even their chemical powers are different. The blue rays, for instance, have the greatest effect in separating oxygen from bodies, as was found by Scheele; and there exist also, as Dr. Wollaston has shown, rays more refrangible than the blue, which produce the same chemical effect, and, what is very remarkable, are invisible.  EMILY.  Do you think it possible that heat may be merely a modification of light?  MRS. B.  That is a supposition which, in the present state of natural philosophy, can neither be positively affirmed nor denied. Let us, therefore, instead of discussing theoretical points, be contented with examining what is known respecting the chemical effects of light.  Light is capable of entering into a kind of transitory union with certain substances, and this is what has been called phosphorescence. Bodies that are possessed of this property, after being exposed to the sun’s rays, appear luminous in the dark. The shells of fish, the bones of land animals, marble, limestone, and a variety of combinations of earths, are more or less powerfully phosphorescent.  CAROLINE.  I remember being much surprised last summer with the phosphorescent appearance of some pieces of rotten wood, which had just been dug out of the ground; they shone so bright that I at first supposed them to be glow-worms.  EMILY.  And is not the light of a glow-worm of a phosphorescent nature?  MRS. B.  It is a very remarkable instance of phosphorescence in living animals; this property, however, is not exclusively possessed by the glow-worm. The insect called the lanthorn-fly, which is peculiar to warm climates, emits light as it flies, producing in the dark a remarkably sparkling appearance. But it is more common to see animal matter in a dead state possessed of a phosphorescent quality; sea fish is often eminently so.  EMILY.  I have heard that the sea has sometimes had the appearance of being illuminated, and that the light is supposed to proceed from the spawn of fishes floating on its surface.  MRS. B.  This light is probably owing to that or some other animal matter. Sea water has been observed to become luminous from the substance of a fresh herring having been immersed in it; and certain insects, of the Medusa kind, are known to produce similar effects.  But the strongest phosphorescence is produced by chemical compositions prepared for the purpose, the most common of which consists of oyster shells and sulphur, and is known by the name of Canton’s Phosphorus.  EMILY.  I am rather surprised, Mrs. B., that you should have said so much of the light emitted by phosphorescent bodies without taking any notice of that which is produced by burning bodies.  MRS. B.  The light emitted by the latter is so intimately connected with the chemical history of combustion, that I must defer all explanation of it till we come to the examination of that process, which is one of the most interesting in chemical science.  Light is an agent capable of producing various chemical changes. It is essential to the welfare both of the animal and vegetable kingdoms; for men and plants grow pale and sickly if deprived of its salutary influence. It is likewise remarkable for its property of destroying colour, which renders it of great consequence in the process of bleaching.  EMILY.  Is it not singular that light, which in studying optics we were taught to consider as the source and origin of colours, should have also the power of destroying them?  CAROLINE.  It is a fact, however, that we every day experience; you know how it fades the colours of linens and silks.  EMILY.  Certainly. And I recollect that endive is made to grow white instead of green, by being covered up so as to exclude the light. But by what means does light produce these effects?  MRS. B.  This I cannot attempt to explain to you until you have obtained a further knowledge of chemistry. As the chemical properties of light can be accounted for only in their reference to compound bodies, it would be useless to detain you any longer on this subject; we may therefore pass on to the examination of heat, or caloric, with which we are somewhat better acquainted.  HEAT and LIGHT may be always distinguished by the different sensations they produce, _Light_ affects the sense of sight; _Caloric_ that of feeling; the one produces _Vision_, the other the sensation of _Heat_.  Caloric is found to exist in a variety of forms or modifications, and I think it will be best to consider it under the two following heads, viz.  1. FREE OR RADIANT CALORIC.  2. COMBINED CALORIC.  The first, FREE or RADIANT CALORIC, is also called HEAT OF TEMPERATURE; it comprehends all heat which is perceptible to the senses, and affects the thermometer.  EMILY.  You mean such as the heat of the sun, of fire, of candles, of stoves; in short, of every thing that burns?  MRS. B.  And likewise of things that do not burn, as, for instance, the warmth of the body; in a word,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26908"],["title","Conversations on Chemistry, V. 1-2 (#6)"],["body"," heat that is _sensible_, whatever may be its degree, or the source from which it is derived.  CAROLINE.  What then are the other modifications of caloric? It must be a strange kind of heat that cannot be perceived by our senses.  MRS. B.  None of the modifications of caloric should properly be called _heat_; for heat, strictly speaking, is the sensation produced by caloric, on animated bodies; this word, therefore, in the accurate language of science, should be confined to express the sensation. But custom has adapted it likewise to inanimate matter, and we say _the heat of an oven_, _the heat of the sun_, without any reference to the sensation which they are capable of exciting.  It was in order to avoid the confusion which arose from thus confounding the cause and effect, that modern chemists adopted the new word _caloric_, to denote the principle which produces heat; yet they do not always, in compliance with their own language, limit the word _heat_ to the expression of the sensation, since they still frequently employ it in reference to the other modifications of caloric which are quite independent of sensation.  CAROLINE.  But you have not yet explained to us what these other modifications of caloric are.  MRS. B.  Because you are not acquainted with the properties of free caloric, and you know that we have agreed to proceed with regularity.  One of the most remarkable properties of free caloric is its power of _dilating_ bodies. This fluid is so extremely subtle, that it enters and pervades all bodies whatever, forces itself between their particles, and not only separates them, but frequently drives them asunder to a considerable distance from each other. It is thus that caloric dilates or expands a body so as to make it occupy a greater space than it did before.  EMILY.  The effect it has on bodies, therefore, is directly contrary to that of the attraction of cohesion; the one draws the particles together, the other drives them asunder.  MRS. B.  Precisely. There is a continual struggle between the attraction of aggregation, and the expansive power of caloric; and from the action of these two opposite forces, result all the various forms of matter, or degrees of consistence, from the solid, to the liquid and aëriform state. And accordingly we find that most bodies are capable of passing from one of these forms to the other, merely in consequence of their receiving different quantities of caloric.  CAROLINE.  That is very curious; but I think I understand the reason of it. If a great quantity of caloric is added to a solid body, it introduces itself between the particles in such a manner as to overcome, in a considerable degree, the attraction of cohesion; and the body, from a solid, is then converted into a fluid.  MRS. B.  This is the case whenever a body is fused or melted; but if you add caloric to a liquid, can you tell me what is the consequence?  CAROLINE.  The caloric forces itself in greater abundance between the particles of the fluid, and drives them to such a distance from each other, that their attraction of aggregation is wholly destroyed: the liquid is then transformed into vapour.  MRS. B.  Very well; and this is precisely the case with boiling water, when it is converted into steam or vapour, and with all bodies that assume an aëriform state.  EMILY.  I do not well understand the word aëriform?  MRS. B.  Any elastic fluid whatever, whether it be merely vapour or permanent air, is called aëriform.  But each of these various states, solid, liquid, and aëriform, admit of many different degrees of density, or consistence, still arising (chiefly at least) from the different quantities of caloric the bodies contain. Solids are of various degrees of density, from that of gold, to that of a thin jelly. Liquids, from the consistence of melted glue, or melted metals, to that of ether, which is the lightest of all liquids. The different elastic fluids (with which you are not yet acquainted) are susceptible of no less variety in their degrees of density.  EMILY.  But does not every individual body also admit of different degrees of consistence, without changing its state?  MRS. B.  Undoubtedly; and this I can immediately show you by a very simple experiment. This piece of iron now exactly fits the frame, or ring, made to receive it; but if heated red hot, it will no longer do so, for its dimensions will be so much increased by the caloric that has penetrated into it, that it will be much too large for the frame.  The iron is now red hot; by applying it to the frame, we shall see how much it is dilated.  EMILY.  Considerably so indeed! I knew that heat had this effect on bodies, but I did not imagine that it could be made so conspicuous.  MRS. B.  By means of this instrument (called a Pyrometer) we may estimate, in the most exact manner, the various dilatations of any solid body by heat. The body we are now going to submit to trial is this small iron bar; I fix it to this apparatus, (PLATE I. Fig. 1.) and then heat it by lighting the three lamps beneath it: when the bar expands, it increases in length as well as thickness; and, as one end communicates with this wheel-work, whilst the other end is fixed and immoveable, no sooner does it begin to dilate than it presses against the wheel-work, and sets in motion the index, which points out the degrees of dilatation on the dial-plate.    [Illustration: Plate I. Vol. I. p. 38.    Fig. 1. Pyrometer.   A.A Bar of Metal.   1.2.3 Lamps burning.   B.B Wheel work.   C Index.    Fig. 2   A.A Glass tubes with bulbs.   B.B Glasses of water in which they are immersed.]  EMILY.  This is, indeed, a very curious instrument; but I do not understand the use of the wheels: would it not be more simple, and answer the purpose equally well, if the bar, in dilating, pressed against the index, and put it in motion without the intervention of the wheels?  MRS. B.  The use of the wheels is merely to multiply the motion, and therefore render the effect of the caloric more obvious; for if the index moved no more than the bar increased in length, its motion would scarcely be perceptible; but by means of the wheels it moves in a much greater proportion, which therefore renders the variations far more conspicuous.  By submitting different bodies to the test of the pyrometer, it is found that they are far from dilating in the same proportion. Different metals expand in different degrees, and other kinds of solid bodies vary still more in this respect. But this different susceptibility of dilatation is still more remarkable in fluids than in solid bodies, as I shall show you. I have here two glass tubes, terminated at one end by large bulbs. We shall fill the bulbs, the one with spirit of wine, the other with water. I have coloured both liquids, in order that the effect may be more conspicuous. The spirit of wine, you see, dilates by the warmth of my hand as I hold the bulb.  EMILY.  It certainly does, for I see it is rising into the tube. But water, it seems, is not so easily affected by heat; for scarcely any change is produced on it by the warmth of the hand.  MRS. B.  True; we shall now plunge the bulbs into hot water, (PLATE I. Fig. 2.) and you will see both liquids rise in the tubes; but the spirit of wine will ascend highest.  CAROLINE.  How rapidly it expands! Now it has nearly reached the top of the tube, though the water has hardly begun to rise.  EMILY.  The water now begins to dilate. Are not these glass tubes, with liquids rising within them, very like thermometers?  MRS. B.  A thermometer is constructed exactly on the same principle, and these tubes require only a scale to answer the purpose of thermometers: but they would be rather awkward in their dimensions. The tubes and bulbs of thermometers, though of various sizes, are in general much smaller than these; the tube too is hermetically closed, and the air excluded from it. The fluid most generally used in thermometers is mercury, commonly called quicksilver, the dilatations and contractions of which correspond more exactly to the additions, and subtractions, of caloric, than those of any other fluid.  CAROLINE.  Yet I have often seen coloured spirit of wine used in thermometers.  MRS. B.  The expansions and contractions of that liquid are not quite so uniform as those of mercury; but in cases in which it is not requisite to ascertain the temperature with great precision, spirit of wine will answer the purpose equally well, and indeed in some respects better, as the expansion of the latter is greater, and therefore more conspicuous. This fluid is used likewise in situations and experiments in which mercury would be frozen; for mercury becomes a solid body, like a piece of lead or any other metal, at a certain degree of cold: but no degree of cold has ever been known to freeze spirit of wine.  A thermometer, therefore, consists of a tube with a bulb, such as you see here, containing a fluid whose degrees of dilatation and contraction are indicated by a scale to which the tube is fixed. The degree which indicates the boiling point, simply means that, when the fluid is sufficiently dilated to rise to this point, the heat is such that water exposed to the same temperature will boil. When, on the other hand, the fluid is so much condensed as to sink to the freezing point, we know that water will freeze at that temperature. The extreme points of the scales are not the same in all thermometers, nor are the degrees always divided in the same manner. In different countries philosophers have chosen to adopt different scales and divisions. The two thermometers most used are those of Fahrenheit, and of Reaumur; the first is generally preferred by the English, the latter by the French.  EMILY.  The variety of scale must be very inconvenient, and I should think liable to occasion confusion, when French and English experiments are compared.  MRS. B.  The inconvenience is but very trifling, because the different gradations of the "]]]
