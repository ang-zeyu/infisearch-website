A temple, whose high dome       Rose from a water-cup;     And from its altar to Thy throne       May we press on and up!      And she--last at the cross,       First at the tomb, who waits--     Woman--will watch to cleanse from dross       The cause she elevates.      Sons of the old Bay State,       Work for our glorious cause!     And be your waiting hearts elate,       Since temperance makes your laws.      \"Temples of Honor,\" all,       \"Social,\" or grand, or great,     This blazoned, brilliant temperance hall       To Thee we dedicate.      \"Good Templars\" one and all,     Good \"Sons,\" and daughters, too,     We dedicate this temperance hall     To God, to Truth, and you!      Lynn, Mass., _August 4, 1866_.     _LINES_      Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer.--_Moore._      Was that fold for the lambkin soft virtue's repose,     Where the weary and earth-stricken lay down their woes,--     When the fountain and leaflet are frozen and sere,     And the mountains more friendless,--their home is not here?      When the herd had forsaken, and left them to stray     From the green sunny slopes of the woodland away;     Where the music of waters had fled to the sea,     And this life but one given to suffer and be?      Was it then thou didst call them to banish all pain,     And the harpstring, just breaking, reecho again     To a strain of enchantment that flowed as the wave,     Where they waited to welcome the murmur it gave?      Oh, there's never a shadow where sunshine is not,     And never the sunshine without a dark spot;     Yet there's one will be victor, for glory and fame,     Without heart to define them, were only a name!      Lynn, Mass., _February 19, 1868_.     _TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN_  _Who sent me the picture depictive of Isaiah xi._       Jesus loves you! so does mother:       Glad thy Eastertide:     Loving God and one another,       You in Him abide.     Ours through Him who gave you to us,--       Gentle as the dove,     Fondling e'en the lion furious,       Leading kine with love.      Father, in Thy great heart hold them       Ever thus as Thine!     Shield and guide and guard them; and, when       At some siren shrine     They would lay their pure hearts' off'ring,       Light with wisdom's ray--     Beacon beams--athwart the weakly,       Rough or treacherous way.      Temper every trembling footfall,       Till they gain at last--     Safe in Science, bright with glory--       Just the way Thou hast:     Then, O tender Love and wisdom,       Crown the lives thus blest     With the guerdon of Thy bosom,       Whereon they may rest!      Pleasant View, Concord, N. H., _April 3, 1899_.     _HOPE_       Tis borne on the zephyr at eventide's hour;     It falls on the heart like the dew on the flower,--     An infinite essence from tropic to pole,     The promise, the home, and the heaven of Soul.      Hope happifies life, at the altar or bower,     And loosens the fetters of pride and of power;     It comes through our tears, as the soft summer rain,     To beautify, bless, and make joyful again.      The harp of the minstrel, the treasure of time;     A rainbow of rapture, o'erarching, divine;     The God-given mandate that speaks from above,--     No place for earth's idols, but hope thou, and love.     _TO ETTA_       Fair girl, thy rosebud heart rests warm       Within life's summer bowers!     Nor blasts of winter's angry storm,       Nor April's changeful showers,      Its leaves have shed or bowed the stem;       But gracefully it stands--     A gem in beauty's diadem,       Unplucked by ruthless hands.      Thus may it ripen into bloom,       Fresh as the fragrant sod,     And yield its beauty and perfume       An offering pure to God.      Sweet as the poetry of heaven,       Bright as her evening star,     Be all thy life in music given,       While beauty fills each bar.      Lynn, Mass., _December 8, 1866_.     _NEVERMORE_       Are the dear days ever coming again,       As sweetly they came of yore,     Singing the olden and dainty refrain,       Oh, ever and nevermore?      Ever to gladness and never to tears,       Ever the gross world above;     Never to toiling and never to fears,       Ever to Truth and to Love?      Can the forever of happiness be       Outside this ever of pain?     Will the hereafter from suffering free       The weary of body and brain?      Weary of sobbing, like some tired child       Over the tears it has shed;     Weary of sowing the wayside and wild,       Watching the husbandman fled;      Nevermore reaping the harvest we deem,       Evermore gathering in woe--     Say, are the sheaves and the gladness a dream,       Or to the patient who sow?      Lynn, Mass., _September 3, 1871_.     _MEETING OF MY DEPARTED MOTHER AND HUSBAND_       Joy for thee, happy friend! thy bark is past     The dangerous sea, and safely moored at last--                     Beyond rough foam.     Soft gales celestial, in sweet music bore--     Spirit emancipate for this far shore--                     Thee to thy home.      \"You've traveled long, and far from mortal joys,     To Soul's diviner sense, that spurns such toys,                     Brave wrestler, lone.     Now see thy ever-self; Life never fled;     Man is not mortal, never of the dead:                     The dark unknown.      \"When hope soared high, and joy was eagle-plumed,     Thy pinions drooped; the flesh was weak, and doomed                     To pass away.     But faith triumphant round thy death-couch shed     Majestic forms; and radiant glory sped                     The dawning day.      \"Intensely grand and glorious life's sphere,--     Beyond the shadow, infinite appear                     Life, Love divine,--     Where mortal yearnings come not, sighs are stilled,     And home and peace and hearts are found and filled,                     Thine, ever thine.      \"Bearest thou no tidings from our loved on earth,     The toiler tireless for Truth's new birth                     All-unbeguiled?     Our joy is gathered from her parting sigh:     This hour looks on her heart with pitying eye,--                     What of my child?\"      \"When, severed by death's dream, I woke to Life,     She deemed I died, and could not know the strife                     At first to fill     That waking with a love that steady turns     To God; a hope that ever upward yearns,                     Bowed to His will.      \"Years had passed o'er thy broken household band,     When angels beckoned me to this bright land,                     With thee to meet.     She that has wept o'er thee, kissed my cold brow,     Rears the sad marble to our memory now,                     In lone retreat.      \"By the remembrance of her loyal life,     And parting prayer, I only know my wife,                     Thy child, shall come--     Where farewells cloud not o'er our ransomed rest--     Hither to reap, with all the crowned and blest,                     Of bliss the sum.      \"When Love's rapt sense the heartstrings gently sweep     With joy divinely fair, the high and deep,                     To call her home,     She shall mount upward unto purer skies;     We shall be waiting, in what glad surprise,                     Our spirits' own!\"     _ISLE OF WIGHT_      On receiving a painting of the Isle.       Isle of beauty, thou art singing       To my sense a sweet refrain;     To my busy mem'ry bringing       Scenes that I would see again.      Chief, the charm of thy reflecting,       Is the moral that it brings;     Nature, with the mind connecting,       Gives the artist's fancy wings.      Soul, sublime 'mid human _d√©bris_,       Paints the limner's work, I ween,     Art and Science, all unweary,       Lighting up this mortal dream.      Work ill-done within the misty       Mine of human thoughts, we see     Soon abandoned when the Master       Crowns life's Cliff for such as we.      Students wise, he maketh now thus       Those who fish in waters deep,     When the buried Master hails us       From the shores afar, complete.      Art hath bathed this isthmus-lordling       In a beauty strong and meek     As the rock, whose upward tending       Points the plane of power to seek.      Isle of beauty, thou art teaching       Lessons long and grand, tonight,     To my heart that would be bleaching       To thy whiteness, Cliff of Wight.     _SPRING_       Come to thy bowers, sweet spring,       And paint the gray, stark trees,     The bud, the leaf and wing--       Bring with thee brush and breeze.      And soft thy shading lay       On vale and woodland deep;     With sunshine's lovely ray       Light o'er the rugged steep.      More softly warm and weave       The patient, timid grass,     Till heard at silvery eve       Poor robin's lonely mass.      Bid faithful swallows come       And build their cozy nests,     Where wind nor storm can numb       Their downy little breasts.      Come at the sad heart's call,       To empty summer bowers,     Where still and dead are all       The vernal songs and flowers.      It may be months or years       Since joyous spring was there.     O come to clouds and tears       With light and song and prayer!     _JUNE_       Whence are thy wooings, gentle June?       Thou hast a naiad's charm;     Thy breezes scent the rose's breath;       Old Time gives thee her palm.     The lark's shrill song doth wake the dawn:       The eve-bird's forest flute     Gives back some maiden melody,       Too pure for aught so mute.

When sunshine beautifies the shower,       As smiles through teardrops seen,     Ask of its June, the long-hushed heart,       What hath the record been?     And thou wilt find that harmonies,       In which the Soul hath part,     Ne'er perish young, like things of earth,       In records of the heart.     _RONDELET_           The flowers of June     The gates of memory unbar:         The flowers of June         Such old-time harmonies retune,     I fain would keep the gates ajar,--     So full of sweet enchantment are         The flowers of June.      --_James T. White._      Who loves not June     Is out of tune     With love and God;     The rose his rival reigns,     The stars reject his pains,     His home the clod!      And yet I trow,     When sweet _rondeau_     Doth play a part,     The curtain drops on June;     Veiled is the modest moon--     Hushed is the heart.     _AUTUMN_       Quickly earth's jewels disappear;       The turf, whereon I tread,     Ere autumn blanch another year,       May rest above my head.      Touched by the finger of decay       Is every earthly love;     For joy, to shun my weary way,       Is registered above.      The languid brooklets yield their sighs,       A requiem o'er the tomb     Of sunny days and cloudless skies,       Enhancing autumn's gloom.      The wild winds mutter, howl, and moan,       To scare my woodland walk,     And frightened fancy flees, to roam       Where ghosts and goblins stalk.      The cricket's sharp, discordant scream       Fills mortal sense with dread;     More sorrowful it scarce could seem;       It voices beauty fled.      Yet here, upon this faded sod,--       O happy hours and fleet,--     When songsters' matin hymns to God       Are poured in strains so sweet,      My heart unbidden joins rehearse,       I hope it's better made,     When mingling with the universe,       Beneath the maple's shade.      Written in girlhood, in a maple grove.     _ALPHABET AND BAYONET_       If fancy plumes aerial flight,       Go fix thy restless mind     On learning's lore and wisdom's might,       And live to bless mankind.     The sword is sheathed, 'tis freedom's hour,       No despot bears misrule,     Where knowledge plants the foot of power       In our God-blessed free school.      Forth from this fount the streamlets flow,       That widen in their course.     Hero and sage arise to show       Science the mighty source,     And laud the land whose talents rock       The cradle of her power,     And wreaths are twined round Plymouth Rock,       From erudition's bower.      Farther than feet of chamois fall,       Free as the generous air,     Strains nobler far than clarion call       Wake freedom's welcome, where     Minerva's silver sandals still       Are loosed, and not effete;     Where echoes still my day-dreams thrill,       Woke by her fancied feet.     _THE COUNTRY-SEAT_       Wild spirit of song,--midst the zephyrs at play     In bowers of beauty,--I bend to thy lay,     And woo, while I worship in deep sylvan spot,     The Muses' soft echoes to kindle the grot.     Wake chords of my lyre, with musical kiss,     To vibrate and tremble with accents of bliss.      Here morning peers out, from her crimson repose,     On proud Prairie Queen and the modest Moss-rose;     And vesper reclines--when the dewdrop is shed     On the heart of the pink--in its odorous bed;     But Flora has stolen the rainbow and sky,     To sprinkle the flowers with exquisite dye.      Here fame-honored hickory rears his bold form,     And bares a brave breast to the lightning and storm,     While palm, bay, and laurel, in classical glee,     Chase tulip, magnolia, and fragrant fringe-tree;     And sturdy horse-chestnut for centuries hath given     Its feathery blossom and branches to heaven.      Here is life! Here is youth! Here the poet's world-wish,--     Cool waters at play with the gold-gleaming fish;     While cactus a mellower glory receives     From light colored softly by blossom and leaves;     And nestling alder is whispering low,     In lap of the pear-tree, with musical flow.[1]      Dark sentinel hedgerow is guarding repose,     Midst grotto and songlet and streamlet that flows     Where beauty and perfume from buds burst away,     And ope their closed cells to the bright, laughing day;     Yet, dwellers in Eden, earth yields you her tear,--     Oft plucked for the banquet, but laid on the bier.      Earth's beauty and glory delude as the shrine     Or fount of real joy and of visions divine;     But hope, as the eaglet that spurneth the sod,     May soar above matter, to fasten on God,     And freely adore all His spirit hath made,     Where rapture and radiance and glory ne'er fade.      Oh, give me the spot where affection may dwell     In sacred communion with home's magic spell!     Where flowers of feeling are fragrant and fair,     And those we most love find a happiness rare;     But clouds are a presage,--they darken my lay:     This life is a shadow, and hastens away.      [1] An alder growing from the bent branch of a pear-tree.     _TO ELLEN._ \"_SING ME THAT SONG!_\"       Sing me that song! My spirit is sad,       Life's pulses move fitful and slow;     A meeting with loved ones in dreams I have had,       Whose robes were as spotless as snow:     A phantom of joy, it fled with the light,       And left but a parting in air.     My soul is enchained to life's dreary night,       O sing me \"Sweet hour of prayer\"!      Ah, sleep, twin sister of death and of night!       My thoughts 'neath thy drap'ry still lie.     Alas! that from dreams so boundless and bright       We waken to life's dreary sigh.     Those moments most sweet are fleetest alway,       For love claspeth earth's raptures not long,     Till darkness and death like mist melt away,       To rise to a seraph's new song.      O'er ocean or Alps, the stranger who roams       But gathers a wreath for his bier;     For life hath its music in low minor tones,       And _man_ is the cause of its tear.     But drops of pure nectar our brimming cup fill,       When we walk by that murmuring stream;     Or when, like the thrill of that mountain rill,       Your songs float in memory's dream.      Sweet spirit of love, at soft eventide       Wake gently the chords of her lyre,     And whisper of one who sat by her side       To join with the neighboring choir;     And tell how that heart is silent and sad,       No melody sweeps o'er its strings!     'Tis breaking alone, but a young heart and glad--       Might cheer it, perchance, when she sings.      Lynn, Mass., _August 25, 1866_.     _LINES, ON VISITING PINE GROVE CEMETERY_       Ah, why should the brief bliss of life's little day     Grow cold in this spot as the spiritless clay,     And thought be at work with the long-buried hours,     And tears be bedewing these fresh-smiling flowers!      Ah, wherefore the memory of dear ones deemed dead     Should bow thee, as winds bow the tall willow's head!     Beside you they walk while you weep, and but pass     From your sight as the shade o'er the dark wavy grass.      The cypress may mourn with her evergreen tears,     And, like the blue hyacinth, change not with years;     Yea, flowers of feeling may blossom above,     To yield earth the fragrance of goodness and love;      So one heart is left me--she breathes in my ear,     \"I'm living to bless thee; for this are we here.\"     And when this sweet pledge to my lone heart was given,     Earth held but this joy, or this happiness heaven!      Here the rock and the sea and the tall waving pine     Enchant deep the senses,--subduing, sublime;     Yet stronger than these is the spell that hath power     To sweep o'er the heartstrings in memory's hour.      Of the past 'tis the talisman, when _we three met_,     When the star of our friendship arose not to set;     And pure as its rising, and bright as the star,     Be its course through our heavens, whether near or afar.      Lynn, Mass., _August 24, 1865_.     _A VERSE_   _Mother's New Year Gift to the Little Children_      Father-Mother God,         Loving me,--     Guard me when I sleep;     Guide my little feet         Up to Thee.   _To the Big Children_      Father-Mother good, lovingly         Thee I seek,--         Patient, meek,     In the way Thou hast,--     Be it slow or fast,         Up to Thee.     _TRUTH_         Beyond the clouds, away       In the dim distance, lay       A bright and golden shower       At sunset's radiant hour,--     Like to the soul's glad immortality,       Making this life divine,       Making its waters wine,     Giving the glory that eye cannot see.        In God there is no night,--       Truth is eternal light,       A help forever near;       For sinless sense is here     In Truth, the Life, the Principle of man.       Away, then, mortal sense!       Then, error, get thee hence,     Thy discord ne'er in harmony began!        Immortal Truth,--since heaven rang,       The while the glad stars sang       To hail creation's glorious morn--       As when this babe was born,     A painless heraldry of Soul, not sense,--       Shine on our 'wildered way,       Give God's idea sway,     And sickness, sin, and death are banished hence.      Lynn, Mass., _April, 1871_.     \"_THE LIBERTY BELLS_\"       This is the hour they then foretold--       When earth, inebriate with crime,     Laughed right to scorn, and guilt, grown bold,       Knelt worshiping at mammon's shrine.      This is the hour! Corruption's band       Is driven back; and periled right,     Rescued by the \"fanatic\" hand,       Spans our broad heaven of light.      Righteousness ne'er--awestruck or dumb--       Feared for an hour the tyrant's heel!     Injustice to the combat sprang;  "]]]
