I knows every foot o' groun' this-a-way, an' ef they was any deserters roun' here I'd be mighty apt to know it.\"  This announcement was an extinguisher to the boys' hopes. Clearly, they were going in the wrong direction.  \"We are just going to eat our lunch,\" said Frank; \"won't you join us?\"  Willy added his invitation to his brother's, and their friend politely accepted, suggesting that they should walk back a little way and find a log. This all three did; and in a few minutes they were enjoying the lunch which the boys' mother had provided, while the stranger was telling the boys his views about deserters, which, to say the least, were very original.  \"I seen the conscrip'-guard jes' this mornin', ridin' 'round whar they knowd they warn' no deserters, but ole womens and children,\" he said with his mouth full. \"Whyn't they go whar they knows deserters _is_?\" he asked.  \"Where are they? We heard they had a cave down on the river, and we were going there,\" declared the boys.  \"Down on the river?--a cave? Ain' no cave down thar, without it's below Rockett's mill; fur I've hunted and fished ev'y foot o' that river up an' down both sides, an' 'tain' a hole thar, big enough to hide a' ole hyah, I ain' know.\"  This proof was too conclusive to admit of further argument.  \"Why don't _you_ go in the army?\" asked Willy, after a brief reflection.  \"What? Why don't _I_ go in the army?\" repeated the hunter. \"Why, I's _in_ the army! You didn' think I warn't in the army, did you?\"  The hunter's tone and the expression of his face were so full of surprise that Willy felt deeply mortified at his rudeness, and began at once to stammer something to explain himself.  \"I b'longs to Colonel Marshall's regiment,\" continued the man, \"an' I's been home sick on leave o' absence. Got wounded in the leg, an' I's jes' gettin' well. I ain' rightly well enough to go back now, but I's anxious to git back; I'm gwine to-morrow mornin' ef I don' go this evenin'. You see I kin hardly walk now!\" and to demonstrate his lameness, he got up and limped a few yards. \"I ain' well yit,\" he pursued, returning and dropping into his seat on the log, with his face drawn up by the pain the exertion had brought on.  \"Let me see your wound. Is it sore now?\" asked Willy, moving nearer to the man with a look expressive of mingled curiosity and sympathy.  \"You can't see it; it's up heah,\" said the soldier, touching the upper part of his hip; \"an' I got another one heah,\" he added, placing his hand very gently to his side. \"This one's whar a Yankee run me through with his sword. Now, that one was where a piece of shell hit me,--I don't keer nothin' 'bout that,\" and he opened his shirt and showed a triangular, purple scar on his shoulder.  \"You certainly must be a brave soldier,\" exclaimed both boys, impressed at sight of the scar, their voices softened by fervent admiration.  \"Yes, I kep' up with the bes' of 'em,\" he said, with a pleased smile.  Suddenly a horn began to blow, \"toot--toot--toot,\" as if all the \"Millindys\" in the world were being summoned. It was so near the boys that it quite startled them.  \"That's for the deserters, now,\" they both exclaimed.  Their friend looked calmly up and down the road, both ways.  \"Them rascally conscrip'-guard been tellin' you all that, to gi' 'em some excuse for keepin' out o' th' army theyselves--that's all. Th' ain' gwine ketch no deserters any whar in all these parts, an' you kin tell 'em so. I'm gwine down thar an' see what that horn's a-blowin' fur; hit's somebody's dinner horn, or somp'n',\" he added, rising and taking up his game-bag.  \"Can't we go with you?\" asked the boys.  \"Well, nor, I reckon you better not,\" he drawled; \"thar's some right bad dogs down thar in the pines,--mons'us bad; an' I's gwine cut through the woods an' see ef I can't pick up a squ'rr'l, gwine 'long, for the ole 'ooman's supper, as I got to go 'way to-night or to-morrow; she's mighty poorly.\"  \"Is she poorly much?\" asked Willy, greatly concerned. \"We'll get mamma to come and see her to-morrow, and bring her some bread.\"  \"Nor, she ain' so sick; that is to say, she jis' poorly and 'sturbed in her mind. She gittin' sort o' old. Here, y' all take these squ'rr'ls,\" he said, taking the squirrels from his old game-bag and tossing them at Willy's feet. Both boys protested, but he insisted. \"Oh, yes; I kin get some mo' fur her.  \"Y' all better go home. Well, good-bye, much obliged to you,\" and he strolled off with his gun in the bend of his arm, leaving the boys to admire and talk over his courage.  They turned back, and had gone about a quarter of a mile, when they heard a great trampling of horses behind them. They stopped to listen, and in a little while a squadron of cavalry came in sight. The boys stepped to one side of the road to wait for them, eager to tell the important information they had received from their friend, that there were no deserters in that section. In a hurried consultation they agreed not to tell that they had been hunting deserters themselves, as they knew the soldiers would only have a laugh at their expense.  \"Hello, boys, what luck?\" called the officer in the lead, in a friendly manner.  They told him they had not shot anything; that the squirrels had been given to them; and then both boys inquired:  \"You all hunting for deserters?\"  \"You seen any?\" asked the leader, carelessly, while one or two men pressed their horses forward eagerly.  \"No, th' ain't any deserters in this direction at all,\" said the boys, with conviction in their manner.  \"How do you know?\" asked the officer.  \"'Cause a gentleman told us so.\"  \"Who? When? What gentleman?\"  \"A gentleman who met us a little while ago.\"  \"How long ago? Who was he?\"  \"Don't know who he was,\" said Frank.  \"When we were eating our snack,\" put in Willy, not to be left out.  \"How was he dressed? Where was it? What sort of man was he?\" eagerly inquired the leading trooper.  The boys proceeded to describe their friend, impressed by the intense interest accorded them by the listeners.  \"He was a sort of man with red hair, and wore a pair of gray breeches and an old pair of shoes, and was in his shirt-sleeves.\" Frank was the spokesman.  \"And he had a gun--a long squirrel-gun,\" added Willy, \"and he said he belonged to Colonel Marshall's regiment.\"  \"Why, that's Tim Mills. He's a deserter himself,\" exclaimed the captain.  \"No, he ain't--_he_ ain't any deserter,\" protested both at once. \"He is a mighty brave soldier, and he's been home on a furlough to get well of a wound on his leg where he was shot.\"  \"Yes, and it ain't well yet, but he's going back to his command to-night or to-morrow morning; and he's got another wound in his side where a Yankee ran him through with his sword. We know _he_ ain't any deserter.\"  \"How do you know all this?\" asked the officer.  \"He told us so himself, just now--a little while ago, that is,\" said the boys.  The man laughed.  \"Why, he's fooled you to death. That's Tim himself, that's been doing all the devilment about here. He is the worst deserter in the whole gang.\"  \"We saw the wound on his shoulder,\" declared the boys, still doubting.  \"I know it; he's got one there,--that's what I know him by. Which way did he go,--and how long has it been?\"  \"He went that way, down in the woods; and it's been some time. He's got away now.\"  The lads by this time were almost convinced of their mistake; but they could not prevent their sympathy from being on the side of their late agreeable companion.  \"We'll catch the rascal,\" declared the leader, very fiercely. \"Come on, men,--he can't have gone far;\" and he wheeled his horse about and dashed back up the road at a great pace, followed by his men. The boys were half inclined to follow and aid in the capture; but Frank, after a moment's thought, said solemnly:  \"No, Willy; an Arab never betrays a man who has eaten his salt. This man has broken bread with us; we cannot give him up. I don't think we ought to have told about him as much as we did.\"  This was an argument not to be despised.  A little later, as the boys trudged home, they heard the horns blowing again a regular \"toot-toot\" for \"Millindy.\" It struck them that supper followed dinner very quickly in Holetown.  When the troop passed by in the evening the men were in very bad humor. They had had a fruitless addition to their ride, and some of them were inclined to say that the boys had never seen any man at all, which the boys thought was pretty silly, as the man had eaten at least two-thirds of their lunch.  Somehow the story got out, and Hugh was very scornful because the boys had given their lunch to a deserter.     CHAPTER VIII.   As time went by the condition of things at Oakland changed--as it did everywhere else. The boys' mother, like all the other ladies of the country, was so devoted to the cause that she gave to the soldiers until there was nothing left. After that there was a failure of the crops, and the immediate necessities of the family and the hands on the place were great.  There was no sugar nor coffee nor tea. These luxuries had been given up long before. An attempt was made to manufacture sugar out of the sorghum, or sugar-cane, which was now being cultivated as an experiment; but it proved unsuccessful, and molasses made from the cane was the only sweetening. The boys, however, never liked anything sweetened with molasses, so they gave up everything that had molasses in it. Sassafras tea was tried as a substitute for tea, and a drink made out of parched corn and wheat, of burnt sweet potato and other things, in the place of coffee; but none of them were fit to drink--at least so the boys thought. The wheat crop proved a failure; but"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26725"],["title","Two Little Confederates (#6)"],["body","corn turned out very fine, and the boys learned to live on corn bread, as there was no wheat bread.  The soldiers still came by, and the house was often full of young officers who came to see the boys' cousins. The boys used to ride the horses to and from the stables, and, being perfectly fearless, became very fine riders.  Several times, among the visitors, came the young colonel who had commanded the regiment that had camped at the bridge the first year of the war. It did not seem to the boys that Cousin Belle liked him, for she took much longer to dress when he came; and if there were other officers present she would take very little notice of the colonel.  Both boys were in love with her, and after considerable hesitation had written her a joint letter to tell her so, at which she laughed heartily and kissed them both and called them her sweethearts. But, though they were jealous of several young officers who came from time to time, they felt sorry for the colonel,--their cousin was so mean to him. They were on the best terms with him, and had announced their intention of going into his regiment if only the war should last long enough. When he came there was always a scramble to get his horse; though of all who came to Oakland he rode the wildest horses, as both boys knew by practical experience.  At length the soldiers moved off too far to permit them to come on visits, and things were very dull. So it was for a long while.  But one evening in May, about sunset, as the boys were playing in the yard, a man came riding through the place on the way to Richmond. His horse showed that he had been riding hard. He asked the nearest way to \"Ground-Squirrel Bridge.\" The Yankees, he said, were coming. It was a raid. He had ridden ahead of them, and had left them about Greenbay depot, which they had set on fire. He was in too great a hurry to stop and get something to eat, and he rode off, leaving much excitement behind him; for Greenbay was only eight miles away, and Oakland lay right between two roads to Richmond, down one or the other of which the party of raiders must certainly pass.  It was the first time the boys ever saw their mother exhibit so much emotion as she then did. She came to the door and called:  \"Balla, come here.\" Her voice sounded to the boys a little strained and troubled, and they ran up the steps and stood by her. Balla came to the portico, and looked up with an air of inquiry. He, too, showed excitement.  \"Balla, I want you to know that if you wish to go, you can do so.\"  \"Hi, Mistis----\" began Balla, with an air of reproach; but she cut him short and kept on.  \"I want you all to know it.\" She was speaking now so as to be heard by the cook and the maids who were standing about the yard listening to her. \"I want you all to know it--every one on the place! You can go if you wish; but, if you go, you can never come back!\"  \"Hi, Mistis,\" broke in Uncle Balla, \"whar is I got to go? I wuz born on dis place an' I 'spec' to die here, an' be buried right _yonder_;\" and he turned and pointed up to the dark clumps of trees that marked the graveyard on the hill, a half mile away, where the colored people were buried. \"Dat I does,\" he affirmed positively. \"Y' all sticks by us, and we'll stick by you.\"  \"I know I ain't gwine nowhar wid no Yankees or nothin',\" said Lucy Ann, in an undertone.  \"Dee tell me dee got hoofs and horns,\" laughed one of the women in the yard.  The boys' mother started to say something further to Balla, but though she opened her lips, she did not speak; she turned suddenly and walked into the house and into her chamber, where she shut the door behind her. The boys thought she was angry, but when they softly followed her a few minutes afterward, she got up hastily from where she had been kneeling beside the bed, and they saw that she had been crying. A murmur under the window called them back to the portico. It had begun to grow dark; but a bright spot was glowing on the horizon, and on this every one's gaze was fixed.  \"Where is it, Balla? What is it?\" asked the boys' mother, her voice no longer strained and harsh, but even softer than usual.  \"It's the depot, madam. They's burnin' it. That man told me they was burnin' ev'ywhar they went.\"  \"Will they be here to-night?\" asked his mistress.  \"No, marm; I don' hardly think they will. That man said they couldn't travel more than thirty miles a day; but they'll be plenty of 'em here to-morrow--to breakfast.\" He gave a nervous sort of laugh.  \"Here,--you all come here,\" said their mistress to the servants. She went to the smoke-house and unlocked it. \"Go in there and get down the bacon--take a piece, each of you.\" A great deal was still left. \"Balla, step here.\" She called him aside and spoke earnestly in an undertone.  \"Yes'm, that's so; that's jes' what I wuz gwine do,\" the boys heard him say.  Their mother sent the boys out. She went and locked herself in her room, but they heard her footsteps as she turned about within, and now and then they heard her opening and shutting drawers and moving chairs.  In a little while she came out.  \"Frank, you and Willy go and tell Balla to come to the chamber door. He may be out in the stable.\"  They dashed out, proud to bear so important a message. They could not find him, but an hour later they heard him, coming from the stable. He at once went into the house. They rushed into the chamber, where they found the door of the closet open.  \"Balla, come in here,\" called their mother from within. \"Have you got them safe?\" she asked.  \"Yes'm; jes' as safe as they kin be. I want to be 'bout here when they come, or I'd go down an' stay whar they is.\"  \"What is it?\" asked the boys.  \"Where is the best place to put that?\" she said, pointing to a large, strong box in which, they knew, the finest silver was kept; indeed, all excepting what was used every day on the table.  \"Well, I declar', Mistis, that's hard to tell,\" said the old driver, \"without it's in the stable.\"  \"They may burn that down.\"  \"That's so; you might bury it under the floor of the smoke-house?\"  \"I have heard that they always look for silver there,\" said the boys' mother. \"How would it do to bury it in the garden?\"  \"That's the very place I was gwine name,\" said Balla, with flattering approval. \"They can't burn _that_ down, and if they gwine dig for it then they'll have to dig a long time before they git over that big garden.\" He stooped and lifted up one end of the box to test its weight.  \"I thought of the other end of the flower-bed, between the big rose-bush and the lilac.\"  \"That's the very place I had in my mind,\" declared the old man. \"They won' never fine it dyah!\"  \"We know a good place,\" said the boys both together; \"it's a heap better than that. It's where we bury our treasures when we play 'Black-beard the Pirate.'\"  \"Very well,\" said their mother; \"I don't care to know where it is until after to-morrow, anyhow. I know I can trust you,\" she added, addressing Balla.  \"Yes'm, you know dat,\" said he, simply. \"I'll jes' go an' git my hoe.\"  \"The garden hasn't got a roof to it, has it, Unc' Balla?\" asked Willy, quietly.  \"Go 'way from here, boy,\" said the old man, making a sweep at him with his hand. \"That boy ain' never done talkin' 'bout that thing yit,\" he added, with a pleased laugh, to his mistress.  \"And you ain't ever given me all those chickens either,\" responded Willy, forgetting his grammar.  \"Oh, well, I'm _gwi'_ do it; ain't you hear me say I'm gwine do it?\" he laughed as he went out.  The boys were too excited to get sleepy before the silver was hidden. Their mother told them they might go down into the garden and help Balla, on condition that they would not talk.  \"That's the way we always do when we bury the treasure. Ain't it, Willy?\" asked Frank.  \"If a man speaks, it's death!\" declared Willy, slapping his hand on his side as if to draw a sword, striking a theatrical attitude and speaking in a deep voice.  \"Give the 'galleon' to us,\" said Frank.  \"No; be off with you,\" said their mother.  \"That ain't the way,\" said Frank. \"A pirate never digs the hole until he has his treasure at hand. To do so would prove him but a novice; wouldn't it, Willy?\"  \"Well, I leave it all to you, my little Buccaneers,\" said their mother, laughing. \"I'll take care of the spoons and forks we use every day. I'll just hide them away in a hole somewhere.\"  The boys started off after Balla with a shout, but remembered their errand and suddenly hushed down to a little squeal of delight at being actually engaged in burying treasure--real silver. It seemed too good to be true, and withal there was a real excitement about it, for how could they know but that some one might watch them from some hiding-place, or might even fire into them as they worked?  They met the old fellow as he was coming from the carriage-house with a hoe and a spade in his hands. He was on his way to the garden in a very straightforward manner, but the boys made him understand that to bury treasure it was necessary to be particularly secret, and after some little grumbling, Balla humored them.  The difficulty of getting the box of silver out of the house secretly, whilst all the family were up, and the servants were moving about, was so great that this part of the affair had to be carried on in a manner different from the usual programme of pirates of the first water. Even the boys had to admit this; and they yielded to old Balla's advice on this point, but made up for it by additional formality, ceremony, and secrecy in pointing out the spot where the box was to be hid.  Old Balla was quite accustomed to their games and fun--their \"pranks,\" as he called them. He accordingly yielded willingly when they marched him to a point at the lower end of the yard, on the opposite side from the garden, and left him. But he was inclined to give trouble when they both reappeared with a gun, and in a whisper announced that they must march first up the ditch which ran by the spring"]]]
