It     left its camp of instruction (a country town in southern Illinois)     about the last of February, 1862. We were sent to Benton Barracks,     near St. Louis, and remained there drilling (when the weather would     permit) until March 25th. We left on that day for the front. It was     a cloudy, drizzly, and most gloomy day, as we marched through the     streets of St. Louis down to the levee, to embark on a transport     that was to take us to our destination. The city was enveloped in     that pall of coal smoke for which St. Louis is celebrated. It hung     heavy and low and set us all to coughing. I think the colonel must     have marched us down some by-street. It was narrow and dirty, with     high buildings on either side. The line officers took the     sidewalks, while the regiment, marching by the flank, tramped in     silence down the middle of the street, slumping through the nasty,     slimy mud. There was one thing very noticeable on this march     through St. Louis, and that was the utter lack of interest taken in     us by the inhabitants. From pictures I had seen in books at home,     my idea was that when soldiers departed for war, beautiful ladies     stood on balconies and waved snowy-white handkerchiefs at the     troops, while the men stood on the sidewalks and corners and swung     their hats and cheered.      There may have been regiments so favored, but ours was not one of     them. Occasionally a fat, chunky-looking fellow, of a German cast     of countenance, with a big pipe in his mouth, would stick his head     out of a door or window, look at us a few seconds, and then     disappear. No handkerchiefs nor hats were waved, we heard no     cheers. My thoughts at the time were that the Union people there     had all gone to war, or else the colonel was marching us through a     \"Secesh\" part of town.      We marched to the levee and from there on board the big sidewheel     steamer, Empress. The next evening she unfastened her moorings,     swung her head out into the river, turned down stream, and we were     off for the \"seat of war.\" We arrived at Pittsburg Landing on March     31st. Pittsburg Landing, as its name indicates, was simply a     landing place for steamboats. It is on the west bank of the     Tennessee river, in a thickly wooded region about twenty miles     northeast of Corinth. There was no town there then, nothing but     \"the log house on the hill\" that the survivors of the battle of     Shiloh will all remember. The banks of the Tennessee on the     Pittsburg Landing side are steep and bluffy, rising about 100 feet     above the level of the river. Shiloh church, that gave the battle     its name, was a Methodist meeting house. It was a small, hewed log     building with a clapboard roof, about two miles out from the     landing on the main Corinth road. On our arrival we were assigned     to the division of General B. M. Prentiss, and we at once marched     out and went into camp. About half a mile from the landing the road     forks, the main Corinth road goes to the right, past Shiloh church,     the other goes to the left. These two roads come together again     some miles out. General Prentiss' division was camped on this     left-hand road at right angles to it. Our regiment went into camp     almost on the extreme left of Prentiss' line. There was a brigade     of Sherman's division under General Stuart still further to the     left, about a mile, I think, in camp near a ford of Lick Creek,     where the Hamburg and Purdy road crosses the creek; and between the     left of Prentiss' and General Stuart's camp there were no troops. I     know that, for during the few days intervening between our arrival     and the battle I roamed all through those woods on our left,     between us and Stuart, hunting for wild onions and \"turkey peas.\"      The camp of our regiment was about two miles from the landing. The     tents were pitched in the woods, and there was a little field of     about twenty acres in our front. The camp faced nearly west, or     possibly southwest.      I shall never forget how glad I was to get off that old steamboat     and be on solid ground once more, in camp out in those old woods.     My company had made the trip from St. Louis to Pittsburg Landing on     the hurricane deck of the steamboat, and our fare on the route had     been hardtack and raw fat meat, washed down with river water, as we     had no chance to cook anything, and we had not then learned the     trick of catching the surplus hot water ejected from the boilers     and making coffee with it. But once on solid ground, with plenty of     wood to make fires, that bill of fare was changed. I shall never     again eat meat that will taste as good as the fried \"sowbelly\" did     then, accompanied by \"flapjacks\" and plenty of good, strong coffee.     We had not yet got settled down to the regular drills, guard duty     was light, and things generally seemed to run \"kind of loose.\" And     then the climate was delightful. We had just left the bleak, frozen     north, where all was cold and cheerless, and we found ourselves in     a clime where the air was as soft and warm as it was in Illinois in     the latter part of May. The green grass was springing from the     ground, the \"Johnny-jump-ups\" were in blossom, the trees were     bursting into leaf, and the woods were full of feathered songsters.     There was a redbird that would come every morning about sunup and     perch himself in the tall black-oak tree in our company street, and     for perhaps an hour he would practice on his impatient, querulous     note, that said, as plain as a bird could say, \"Boys, boys! get up!     get up! get up!\" It became a standing remark among the boys that he     was a Union redbird and had enlisted in our regiment to sound the     reveille.      So the time passed pleasantly away until that eventful Sunday     morning, April 6, 1862. According to the Tribune Almanac for that     year, the sun rose that morning in Tennessee at 38 minutes past     five o'clock. I had no watch, but I have always been of the opinion     that the sun was fully an hour and a half high before the fighting     began on our part of the line. We had \"turned out\" about sunup,     answered to roll-call, and had cooked and eaten our breakfast. We     had then gone to work, preparing for the regular Sunday morning     inspection, which would take place at nine o'clock. The boys were     scattered around the company streets and in front of the company     parade grounds, engaged in polishing and brightening their muskets,     and brushing up and cleaning their shoes, jackets, trousers, and     clothing generally. It was a most beautiful morning. The sun was     shining brightly through the trees, and there was not a cloud in     the sky. It really seemed like Sunday in the country at home.     During week days there was a continual stream of army wagons going     to and from the landing, and the clucking of their wheels, the     yells and oaths of the drivers, the cracking of whips, mingled with     the braying of mules, the neighing of the horses, the commands of     the officers engaged in drilling the men, the incessant hum and     buzz of the camps, the blare of bugles, and the roll of drums,--all     these made up a prodigious volume of sound that lasted from the     coming-up to the going-down of the sun. But this morning was     strangely still. The wagons were silent, the mules were peacefully     munching their hay, and the army teamsters were giving us a rest. I     listened with delight to the plaintive, mournful tones of a     turtle-dove in the woods close by, while on the dead limb of a tall     tree right in the camp a woodpecker was sounding his \"long roll\"     just as I had heard it beaten by his Northern brothers a thousand     times on the trees in the Otter Creek bottom at home.      Suddenly, away off on the right, in the direction of Shiloh church,     came a dull, heavy \"Pum!\" then another, and still another. Every     man sprung to his feet as if struck by an electric shock, and we     looked inquiringly into one another's faces. \"What is that?\" asked     every one, but no one answered. Those heavy booms then came thicker     and faster, and just a few seconds after we heard that first dull,     ominous growl off to the southwest, came a low, sullen, continuous     roar. There was no mistaking that sound. That was not a squad of     pickets emptying their guns on being relieved from duty; it was the     continuous roll of thousands of muskets, and told us that a battle     was on.      What I have been describing just now occurred during a few seconds     only, and with the roar of musketry the long roll began to beat in     our camp. Then ensued a scene of desperate haste, the like of which     I certainly had never seen before, nor ever saw again. I remember     that in the midst of this terrible uproar and confusion, while the     boys were buckling on their cartridge boxes, and before even the     companies had been formed, a mounted staff officer came galloping     wildly down the line from the right. He checked and whirled his     horse sharply around right in our company street, the iron-bound     hoofs of his steed crashing among the tin plates lying in a little     pile where my mess had eaten its breakfast that morning. The horse     was flecked with foam and its eyes and nostrils were red as blood.     The officer cast one hurried glance around him, and exclaimed: \"My     God! this regiment not in line yet! They have been fighting on the     right over an hour!\" And wheeling his horse, he disappeared in the     direction of the colonel's tent.      I know now that history says the battle began about 4:30 that     morning; that it was brought on by a reconnoitering party sent out     early that morning by General Prentiss; that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26561"],["title","The Story of a Common Soldier of Army Life in the Civil War, 1861-1865 (#8)"],["body","Sherman's     division on the right was early advised of the approach of the     Rebel army, and got ready to meet them in ample time. I have read     these things in books and am not disputing them, but am simply     telling the story of an enlisted man on the left of Prentiss' line     as to what he saw and knew of the condition of things at about     seven o'clock that morning.      Well, the companies were formed, we marched out on the regimental     parade ground, and the regiment was formed in line. The command was     given: \"Load at will; load!\" We had anticipated this, however, as     the most of us had instinctively loaded our guns before we had     formed company. All this time the roar on the right was getting     nearer and louder. Our old colonel rode up close to us, opposite     the center of the regimental line, and called out, \"Attention,     battalion!\" We fixed our eyes on him to hear what was coming. It     turned out to be the old man's battle harangue.      \"Gentlemen,\" said he, in a voice that every man in the regiment     heard, \"remember your State, and do your duty today like brave     men.\"      That was all. A year later in the war the old man doubtless would     have addressed us as \"soldiers,\" and not as \"gentlemen,\" and he     would have omitted his allusion to the \"State,\" which smacked a     little of Confederate notions. However, he was a Douglas Democrat,     and his mind was probably running on Buena Vista, in the Mexican     war, where, it is said, a Western regiment acted badly, and threw a     cloud over the reputation for courage of the men of that State     which required the thunders of the Civil War to disperse.     Immediately after the colonel had given us his brief exhortation,     the regiment was marched across the little field I have before     mentioned, and we took our place in line of battle, the woods in     front of us, and the open field in our rear. We \"dressed on\" the     colors, ordered arms, and stood awaiting the attack. By this time     the roar on the right had become terrific. The Rebel army was     unfolding its front, and the battle was steadily advancing in our     direction. We could begin to see the blue rings of smoke curling     upward among the trees off to the right, and the pungent smell of     burning gun-powder filled the air. As the roar came travelling down     the line from the right it reminded me (only it was a million times     louder) of the sweep of a thunder-shower in summer-time over the     hard ground of a stubble-field.      And there we stood, in the edge of the woods, so still, waiting for     the storm to break on us. I know mighty well what I was thinking     about then. My mind's eye was fixed on a little log cabin, far away     to the north, in the backwoods of western Illinois. I could see my     father sitting on the porch, reading the little local newspaper     brought from the post-office the evening before. There was my     mother getting my little brothers ready for Sunday-school; the old     dog lying asleep in the sun; the hens cackling about the barn; all     these things and a hundred other tender recollections rushed into     my mind. I am not ashamed to say now that I would willingly have     given a general quit-claim deed for every jot and tittle of     military glory falling to me, past, present, and to come, if I only     could have been miraculously and instantaneously set down in the     yard of that peaceful little home, a thousand miles away from the     haunts of fighting men.      The time we thus stood, waiting the attack, could not have exceeded     five minutes. Suddenly, obliquely to our right, there was a long,     wavy flash of bright light, then another, and another! It was the     sunlight shining on gun barrels and bayonets--and--there they were     at last! A long brown line, with muskets at a right shoulder shift,     in excellent order, right through the woods they came.      We began firing at once. From one end of the regiment to the other     leaped a sheet of red flame, and the roar that went up from the     edge of that old field doubtless advised General Prentiss of the     fact that the Rebels had at last struck the extreme left of his     line. We had fired but two or three rounds when, for some     reason,--I never knew what,--we were ordered to fall back across     the field, and did so. The whole line, so far as I could see to the     right, went back. We halted on the other side of the field, in the     edge of the woods, in front of our tents, and again began firing.     The Rebels, of course, had moved up and occupied the line we had     just abandoned. And here we did our first hard fighting during the     day. Our officers said, after the battle was over, that we held     this line an hour and ten minutes. How long it was I do not know. I     \"took no note of time.\"      We retreated from this position as our officers afterward said,     because the troops on our right had given way, and we were flanked.     Possibly those boys on our right would give the same excuse for     their leaving, and probably truly, too. Still, I think we did not     fall back a minute too soon. As I rose from the comfortable log     from behind which a bunch of us had been firing, I saw men in gray     and brown clothes, with trailed muskets, running through the camp     on our right, and I saw something else, too, that sent a chill all     through me. It was a kind of flag I had never seen before. It was a     gaudy sort of thing, with red bars. It flashed over me in a second     that that thing was a Rebel flag. It was not more than sixty yards     to the right. The smoke around it was low and dense and kept me     from seeing the man who was carrying it, but I plainly saw the     banner. It was going fast, with a jerky motion, which told me that     the bearer was on a double-quick. About that time we left. We     observed no kind of order in leaving; the main thing was to get out     of there as quick as we could. I ran down our company street, and     in passing the big Sibley tent of our mess I thought of my knapsack     with all my traps and belongings, including that precious little     packet of letters from home. I said to myself, \"I will save my     knapsack, anyhow;\" but one quick backward glance over my left     shoulder made me change my mind, and I went on. I never saw my     knapsack or any of its contents afterwards.      Our broken forces halted and re-formed about half a mile to the     rear of our camp on the summit of a gentle ridge, covered with     thick brush. I recognized our regiment by the little gray pony the     old colonel rode, and hurried to my place in the ranks. Standing     there with our faces once more to the front, I saw a seemingly     endless column of men in blue, marching by the flank, who were     filing off to the right through the woods, and I heard our old     German adjutant, Cramer, say to the colonel, \"Dose are de troops of     Sheneral Hurlbut. He is forming a new line dere in de bush.\" I     exclaimed to myself from the bottom of my heart, \"Bully for General     Hurlbut and the new line in the bush! Maybe we'll whip 'em yet.\" I     shall never forget my feelings about this time. I was astonished at     our first retreat in the morning across the field back to our camp,     but it occurred to me that maybe that was only \"strategy\" and all     done on purpose; but when we had to give up our camp, and actually     turn our backs and run half a mile, it seemed to me that we were     forever disgraced, and I kept thinking to myself: \"What will they     say about this at home?\"      I was very dry for a drink, and as we were doing nothing just then,     I slipped out of ranks and ran down to the little hollow in our     rear, in search of water. Finding a little pool, I threw myself on     the ground and took a copious draught. As I rose to my feet, I     observed an officer about a rod above me also quenching his thirst,     holding his horse meanwhile by the bridle. As he rose I saw it was     our old adjutant. At no other time would I have dared accost him     unless in the line of duty, but the situation made me bold.     \"Adjutant,\" I said, \"What does this mean--our having to run this     way? Ain't we whipped?\" He blew the water from his mustache, and     quickly answered in a careless way: \"Oh, no; dat is all ride. We     yoost fall back to form on the reserve. Sheneral Buell vas now     crossing der river mit 50,000 men, and vill be here pooty quick;     and Sheneral Lew Vallace is coming from Crump's Landing mit 15,000     more. Ve vips 'em; ve vips 'em. Go to your gompany.\" Back I went on     the run, with a heart as light as a feather. As I took my place in     the ranks beside my chum, Jack Medford, I said to him: \"Jack, I've     just had a talk with the old adjutant, down at the branch where     I've been to get a drink. He says Buell is crossing the river with     75,000 men and a whole world of cannon, and that some other general     is coming up from Crump's Landing with 25,000 more men. He says we     fell back here on purpose, and that we're going to whip the Secesh,     just sure. Ain't that just perfectly bully?\" I had improved some on     the adjutant's figures, as the news was so glorious I thought a     little variance of 25,000 or 30,000 men would make no difference in     the end. But as the long hours wore on that day, and still Buell     and Wallace did not come, my faith in the adjutant's veracity     became considerably shaken.      It was at this point that my regiment was detached from Prentiss'     division and served with it no more that day. We were sent some     distance to the right to support a battery, the name of which I     never learned.[1] It was occupying the summit of a slope, and was     actively engaged when we reached it. We were put in position about     twenty rods in the rear of the"]]]
