You can't say anyone would ever know, to look at us.\"  And then he threw himself panting into a chair, and began to laugh excitedly at the success of his unprincipled manoeuvres.  As for Paul, he was perfectly furious at having been so outwitted and overreached. It was a long time before he could command his voice sufficiently to say, savagely: \"Well, you've had your way, and a pretty mess you've made of it. We're both of us in false positions now. I hope you're satisfied, I'm sure. Do you think you'll care about going back to Crichton House in that state?\"  \"No,\" said Dick, very decidedly: \"I'm quite sure I shouldn't.\"  \"Well, I can't help it. You've brought it on yourself; and, provided the Doctor sees no objection to take you back as you are and receive you as one of his pupils, I shall most certainly send you there.\"  Paul did not really mean this, he only meant to frighten him; for he still trusted that, by letting Boaler into the secret, the charm might be set in motion once more, and the difficulty comfortably overcome. But his threat had a most unfortunate effect upon Dick; it hardened him to take a course he might otherwise have shrunk from.  \"Oh,\" he said, \"you're going to do that? But doesn't it strike you that things are rather altered with us now?\"  \"They are, to a certain extent, of course,\" said Paul, \"through my folly and your wicked cunning; but a word or two of explanation from me----\"  \"You'll find it will take more explanation than you think,\" said Dick; \"but, of course, you can try, if you think it worth while--when you get to Grimstone's.\"  \"When I,--I don't understand. When I,--what did you say?\" gasped Paul.  \"Why, you see,\" exclaimed Dick, \"it would never have done for us both to go back; the chaps would have humbugged us so, and as I hate the place and you seem so fond of being a boy and going back to school and that, I thought perhaps it would be best for you to go and see how you liked it!\"  \"I never will! I'll not stir from this room! I dare you to try to move me!\" cried Paul. And just then there was the sound of wheels outside once more. They stopped before the house, the bell rang sharply--the long-expected cab had come at last.  \"You've no time to lose,\" said Dick, \"get your coat on.\"  Mr. Bultitude tried to treat the affair as a joke. He laughed a ghastly little laugh.  \"Ha! ha! you've fairly caught your poor father this time; you've proved him in the wrong. I admit I said more than I exactly meant. But that's enough. Don't drive a good joke too far; shake hands, and let us see if we can't find a way out of this!\"  But Dick only warmed his coat tails at the fire as he said, with a very ungenerous reminiscence of his father's manner: \"You are going back to an excellent establishment, where you will enjoy all the comforts of home--I can specially recommend the stickjaw; look out for it on Tuesdays and Fridays. You will once more take part in the games and lessons of happy boyhood. (Did you ever play 'chevy' when you were a boy before? You'll enjoy chevy.) And you will find your companions easy enough to get on with, if you don't go giving yourself airs; they won't stand airs. Now good-bye, my boy, and bless you!\"  Paul stood staring stupidly at this outrageous assumption; he could scarcely believe yet that it was meant in cruel earnest. Before he could answer, the door opened and Boaler appeared.  \"Had a deal of trouble to find a keb, sir, on a night like this,\" he said to the false Dick, \"but the luggage is all on top, and the man says there's plenty of time still.\"  \"Good-bye then, my boy,\" said Dick, with well-assumed tenderness, but a rather dangerous light in his eye. \"My compliments to the Doctor, remember.\"  Paul turned indignantly from him to the butler; he, at least, would stand by him. Boaler would not see a master who had always been fair, if not indulgent, to him driven from his home in this cold-blooded manner!  He made two or three attempts to speak, for his brain whirled so with scathing, burning things to say. He would expose the fraud then and there, and defy the impudent usurper; he would warn every one against this spurious pinchbeck imitation of himself. The whole household should be summoned and called upon to judge between the two!  No doubt, if he had had enough self-command to do all this effectually, while Dick had as yet not had the time thoroughly to adapt himself to his altered circumstances, he might have turned the situation at the outset, and spared himself some very painful experiences.  But it is very often precisely those words which are the most vitally important to be said that refuse to pass our lips on a sudden emergency. We feel all the necessity of saying something at once, but the necessary words unaccountably desert us at the critical moment.  Mr. Bultitude felt himself in this unfortunate position. He made more wild efforts to explain, but the sense of his danger only petrified his mind instead of stimulating it. Then he was spared further conflict. A dark mist rose before his eyes; the walls of the room receded into infinite space; and, with a loud singing in his ears, he fell, and seemed to himself to be sinking down, down, through the earth to the very crust of the antipodes. Then the blackness closed over him--and he knew no more.     3. _In the Toils_       \"I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him      lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a body with      so old a head.\"--_Merchant of Venice_, Act iv.   When Mr. Bultitude recovered his senses, which was not for a considerable time, he found that he was being jolted along through a broad well-lit thoroughfare, in a musty four-wheeler.  His head was by no means clear yet, and for some minutes he could hardly be said to think at all; he merely lay back dreamily listening to the hard grinding jar of the cab windows vibrating in their grooves.  His first distinct sensation was a vague wonder what Barbara might be intending to give him for dinner, for, oddly enough, he felt far from hungry, and was conscious that his palate would require the adroitest witching.  With the thought of dinner his dining-room was almost inseparably associated, and then, with an instant rush of recollection, the whole scene there with the Garud√¢ Stone surged into his brain. He shuddered as he did so; it had all been so real, so hideously vivid and coherent throughout. But all unpleasant impressions soon yielded to the delicious luxury of his present security.  As his last conscious moment had been passed in his own dining-room, the fact that he opened his eyes in a cab, instead of confirming his worst fears, actually helped to restore the unfortunate gentleman's serenity; for he frequently drove home from the city in this manner, and believed himself now, instead of being, as was actually the case, in that marvellous region of cheap photography, rocking-horses, mild stone lions, and wheels and ladders--the Euston Road--to be bowling along Holborn.  Now that he was thoroughly awake he found positive amusement in going over each successive incident of his nightmare experience with the talisman, and smiling at the tricks his imagination had played him.  \"I wonder now how the dickens I came to dream such outrageous nonsense!\" he said to himself, for even his dreams were, as a rule, within the bounds of probability. But he was not long in tracing it to the devilled kidneys he had had at the club for lunch, and some curious old brown sherry Robinson had given him afterwards at his office.  \"Gad, what a shock the thing has given me!\" he thought. \"I can hardly shake off the feeling even now.\"  As a rule, after waking up on the verge of a fearful crisis, the effect of the horror fades swiftly away, as one detail after another evades a memory which is never too anxious to retain them, and each moment brings a deeper sense of relief and self-congratulation.  But in Paul's case, curiously enough, as he could not help thinking, the more completely roused he became, the greater grew his uneasiness.  Perhaps the first indication of the truth was suggested to him by a lurking suspicion--which he tried to dismiss as mere fancy--that he filled rather less of the cab than he had always been accustomed to do.  To reassure himself he set his thoughts to review all the proceedings of that day, feeling that if he could satisfactorily account for the time up to his taking the cab, that would be conclusive as to the unreality of any thing that appeared to have happened later in his own house. He got on well enough till he came to the hour at which he had left the office, and then, search his memory as he would, he could not remember hailing any cab!  Could it be another delusion, too, or was it the fact that he had found himself much pressed for time and had come home by the Underground to Praed Street? It must have been the day before, but that was Sunday. Saturday, then? But the recollection seemed too recent and fresh; and besides, on Saturday, he had left at two, and had taken Barbara to see Messrs. Maskelyne and Cooke's performance.  Slowly, insidiously, but with irresistible force, the conviction crept upon him that he had dined, and dined well.  \"If I have dined already,\" he told himself, \"I can't be going home to dinner; and if I am not going home to dinner, what--what am I doing in this cab?\"  The bare idea that something might be wrong with him after all made him impatient to put an end to all suspense. He must knock this scotched nightmare once for all on the head by a deliberate appeal to his senses.  The cab had passed the lighted shops now, and was driving between squares and private houses, so that Mr. Bultitude had to wait until the sickly rays of a street lamp glanced into the cab for a moment, and, as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26853"],["title","Vice Versa; or, A Lesson to Fathers (#6)"],["body","did so, he put his feet up on the opposite seat and examined his boots and trousers with breathless eagerness.  It was not to be denied; they were not his ordinary boots, nor did he ever wear such trousers as he saw above them! Always a careful and punctiliously neat person, he was more than commonly exacting concerning the make and polish of his boots and the set of his trousers.  These boots were clumsy, square-toed, and thick-soled; one was even patched on the side. The trousers were heavy and rough, of the kind advertised as \"wear-resisting fabrics, suitable for youths at school,\" frayed at the ends, and shiny--shamefully shiny--about the knees!  In hot despair he rapidly passed his hands over his body. It felt unusually small and slim, Mr. Bultitude being endowed with what is euphemistically termed a \"presence,\" and it was with an agony rarely felt at such a discovery that he realised that, for the first time for more than twenty years, he actually had a waist.  Then, as a last resource, he took off his hat and felt for the broad, smooth, egg-like surface, garnished by scanty side patches of thin hair, which he knew he ought to find.  It was gone--hidden under a crop of thick close curling locks!  This last disappointment completely overcame him; he had a kind of short fit in the cab as the bitter truth was brought home to him unmistakably.  Yes, this was no dream of a distempered digestion, but sober reality. The whole of that horrible scene in the dining-room had really taken place; and now he, Paul Bultitude, the widely-respected merchant of Mincing Lane, a man of means and position, was being ignominiously packed off to school as if he were actually the schoolboy some hideous juggle had made him appear!  It was only with a violent effort that he could succeed in commanding his thoughts sufficiently to decide on some immediate action. \"I must be cool,\" he kept muttering to himself, with shaking lips, \"quite cool and collected. Everything will depend on that now!\"  It was some comfort to him in this extremity to recognise on the box the well-known broad back of Clegg, a cabman who stabled his two horses in some mews near Praed Street, and whom he had been accustomed to patronise in bad weather for several years.  Clegg would know him, in spite of his ridiculous transformation.  His idea was to stop the cab, and turn round and drive home again, when they would find that he was not to be got rid of again quite so easily. If Dick imagined he meant to put up tamely with this kind of treatment, he was vastly mistaken; he would return home boldly and claim his rights!  No reasonable person could be perverse enough to doubt his identity when once matters came to the proof; though at first, of course, he might find a difficulty in establishing it. His children, his clerks, and his servants would soon get used to his appearance, and would learn to look below the mere surface, and then there was always the possibility of putting everything right by means of the magic stone.  \"I won't lose a minute!\" he said aloud; and letting down the window, leaned out and shouted \"Stop!\" till he was hoarse.  But Clegg either could not or would not hear; he drove on at full speed, a faster rate of progress than that adopted by most drivers of four-wheeled cabs being one of his chief recommendations.  They were now passing Euston. It was a muggy, slushy night, with a thin brown fog wreathing the houses and fading away above their tops into a dull, slate-blue sky. The wet street looked like a black canal; the blurred forms, less like vehicles than nondescript boats, moving over its inky surface, were indistinctly reflected therein; the gas-lights flared redly through the murky haze. It was not a pleasant evening in which to be out-of-doors.  Paul would have opened the cab-door and jumped out had he dared, but his nerve failed him, and, indeed, considering the speed of the cab, the leap would have been dangerous to a far more active person. So he was forced to wait resignedly until the station should be reached, when he determined to make Clegg understand his purpose with as little loss of time as possible.  \"I must pay him something extra,\" he thought; \"I'll give him a sovereign to take me back.\" And he searched his pockets for the loose coin he usually carried about with him in such abundance; there was no gold in any of them.  He found, however, a variety of minor and less negotiable articles, which he fished out one by one from unknown depths--a curious collection. There was a stumpy German-silver pencil case, a broken prism from a crystal chandelier, a gilded Jew's harp, a little book in which the leaves on being turned briskly, gave a semblance of motion to the sails of a black windmill drawn therein, a broken tin soldier, some Hong-Kong coppers with holes in them, and a quantity of little cogged wheels from the inside of a watch; while a further search was rewarded by an irregular lump of toffee imperfectly enfolded in sticky brown paper.  He threw the whole of these treasures out of the window with indescribable disgust, and, feeling something like a purse in a side pocket, opened it eagerly.  It held five shillings exactly, the coins corresponding to those he had pushed across to his son such a little while ago! It did not seem to him quite such a magnificent sum now as it had done then; he had shifted his point of view.  It was too clear that the stone must have carried out his thoughtless wish with scrupulous and conscientious exactness in every detail. He had wanted, or said he wanted, to be a boy again like Dick, and accordingly he had become a perfect duplicate, even to the contents of the pockets. Evidently nothing on the face of things showed the slightest difference. Yet--and here lay the sting of the metamorphosis--he was conscious under it all of being his old original self, in utter discordance with the youthful form in which he was an unwilling prisoner.  By this time the cab had driven up the sharp incline, and under the high pointed archway of St. Pancras terminus, and now drew up with a jerk against the steps leading to the booking office.  Paul sprang out at once in a violent passion. \"Here, you, Clegg!\" he said, \"why the devil didn't you pull up when I told you? eh?\"  Clegg was a burly, red-faced man, with a husky voice and a general manner which conveyed the impression that he regarded teetotalism, as a principle, with something more than disapproval.  \"Why didn't I pull up?\" he said, bending stiffly down from his box. \"'Cause I didn't want to lose a good customer, that's why I didn't pull up!\"  \"Do you mean to say you don't know me?\"  \"Know yer?\" said Clegg, with an approach to sentiment: \"I've knowed yer when you was a babby in frocks. I've knowed yer fust nuss (and a fine young woman she were till she took to drinking, as has been the ruin of many). I've knowed yer in Infancy's hour and in yer byhood's bloom! I've druv yer to this 'ere werry station twice afore. Know yer!\"  Paul saw the uselessness of arguing with him. \"Then, ah--drive me back at once. Let those boxes alone. I--I've important business at home which I'd forgotten.\"  Clegg gave a vinous wink. \"Lor, yer at it agin,\" he said with admiration. \"What a artful young limb it is! But it ain't what yer may call good enough, so to speak, it ain't. Clegg don't do that no more!\"  \"Don't do what?\" asked Paul.  \"Don't drive no young gents as is a-bein' sent to school back agin into their family's bosims,\" said Clegg sententiously. \"You was took ill sudden in my cab the larst time. Offal bad you was, to be sure--to hear ye, and I druv' yer back; and I never got no return fare, I didn't, and yer par he made hisself downright nasty over it, said as if it occurred agin he shouldn't employ me no more. I durstn't go and offend yer par; he's a good customer to me, he is.\"  \"I'll give you a sovereign to do it,\" said Paul.  \"If yer wouldn't tell no tales, I might put yer down at the corner p'raps,\" said Clegg, hesitating, to Paul's joy; \"not as it ain't cheap at that, but let's see yer suffering fust. Why,\" he cried with lofty contempt as he saw from Paul's face that the coin was not producible, \"y'ain't got no suffering! Garn away, and don't try to tempt a pore cabby as has his livin' to make. What d'ye think of this, porter, now? 'Ere's a young gent a tryin' to back out o' going to school when he ought to be glad and thankful as he's receivin' the blessin's of a good eddication. Look at me. I'm a 'ard-workin' man. I am. I ain't 'ad no eddication. The kids, they're a learnin' French, and free'and drorin, and the bones on a skellington at the Board School, and I pays my coppers down every week cheerful. And why, porter? Why, young master? 'Cause I knows the vally on it! But when I sees a real young gent a despisin' of the oppertoonities as a bountiful Providence and a excellent par has 'eaped on his 'ed, it--it makes me sick, it inspires Clegg with a pity and a contemp' for such ingratitood, which he cares not for to 'ide from public voo!\"  Clegg delivered this harangue with much gesture and in a loud tone, which greatly edified the porters and disgusted Mr. Bultitude.  \"Go away,\" said the latter, \"that's enough. You're drunk!\"  \"Drunk!\" bellowed the outraged Clegg, rising on the box in his wrath. \"'Ear that. 'Ark at this 'ere young cock sparrer as tells a fam'ly man like Clegg as he's drunk! Drunk, after drivin' his par in this 'ere werry cab through frost and fine fifteen year and more! I wonder yer don't say the old 'orse is drunk; you'll be sayin' that next! Drunk! oh, cert'nly, by all means. Never you darken my cab doors no more. I shall take and tell your par, I shall. Drunk, indeed! A ill-conditioned young wiper as ever I see. Drunk! yah!\"  And with much cursing and growling, Clegg gathered up his reins and drove off into the fog, Boaler having apparently pre-paid the fare.  \"Where for, sir, please?\" said a porter, who had been putting the playbox "]]]
