The answer to the first is to be found in the record of the expedition. Dr. Jameson reached Krügersdorp at three o'clock on Wednesday, January 1st. A few hours before a cyclist had brought him congratulatory messages from the Reform leaders. The goal was almost within sight. What prevented Sir John Willoughby from taking his little force safely over the remaining twenty miles from Krügersdorp to Johannesburg was the merest accident: the few hours' delay caused, naturally enough, by Dr. Jameson's desire that his force should be met and escorted by a small body of volunteers from the Rand. He did not want, as he said, to go to Johannesburg as \"a pirate.\" Sir John Willoughby's evidence is perfectly definite and conclusive on the point. If the force had pushed on by road from Krügersdorp to Johannesburg on Wednesday evening--had not, in Willoughby's words, \"messed about\" at Krügersdorp in expectation of the welcoming escort--Johannesburg would have been reached in safety on Thursday morning. With Dr. Jameson in Johannesburg and Lord Rosmead speeding northwards in his special train, the way would have been prepared for that decisive and successful action on the part of the Imperial Government which Rhodes had desired to bring about.  [Sidenote: Why the raid failed.]  But, unsuccessful as was the actual expedition, the decision to \"ride in\" had secured the intervention of the Imperial Government. If intervention could have done what Rhodes expected of it, Dr. Jameson's decision to \"ride in\" would have gained, at the cost of few lives and no increase of the national debt, what the war gained four years later at the cost of twenty thousand lives and £220,000,000. As it was, it failed to win the franchise for the Uitlanders. Why did not Lord Rosmead, with so strong a Colonial Secretary as Mr. Chamberlain at his back, brush the Raid aside, and address himself to the removal of the greater wrong that gave it birth? If Lord Rosmead had acted in the spirit of Mr. Chamberlain's despatches; if he had reminded the Government of the Republic from the first \"that the danger from which they had just escaped was real, and one which, if the causes which led up to it were not removed, might recur, although in a different form\"; if he had used \"plain language\" to President Krüger; and if, above all, he had remembered--as Mr. Chamberlain reminded him--that \"the people of Johannesburg had surrendered in the belief that reasonable concessions would have been arranged through his intervention, and until these were granted, or were definitely promised to him by the President, the root-causes of the recent troubles would remain,\"--might he not yet have saved South Africa for the empire without subjecting her to the dread arbitrament of the sword?  [Sidenote: Mr. Chamberlain.]  It is in the answer to this question that we find the actual cause of the utter failure of Rhodes's plan. The truth is that success in any real sense--that is to say, success which would have strengthened British supremacy and promoted the union of European South Africa--was impossible. The sole response which Lord Rosmead returned to Mr. Chamberlain's counsels was the weary confession: \"The question of concessions to Uitlanders has never been discussed between President Krüger and myself.\" The methods employed by Rhodes were so questionable that no High Commissioner could have allowed the Imperial Government to have derived any advantage from them. To have gained the franchise for the Uitlanders as the result of violent and unscrupulous action, would have inflicted an enduring injury upon the British cause in South Africa for which the enfranchisement itself would have been small compensation. The disclosure of these methods and, with them, of the hollowness of Rhodes's alliance with the Afrikander Bond, alarmed and incensed the whole Dutch population of South Africa. What this meant Lord Rosmead knew, and Mr. Chamberlain did not know. The ten years' truce between the forces of the Afrikander nationalists and the paramount Power was at an end. To combat these forces something better than the methods of the Raid was required. _Non tali auxilio, nec defensoribus istis!_ No modern race have excelled the Dutch in courage and endurance. In Europe they had successfully defended their independence against the flower of the armies of Spain, Austria, and France. The South African Dutch were not inferior in these qualities to the people of the parent stock. If such a race, embarked upon what it conceived to be a struggle for national existence, was to be overcome, the hands of the conqueror must be clean as well as strong. None the less the active sympathy with the Uitlanders exhibited in Mr. Chamberlain's despatches was welcomed by the British as evidence that the new Colonial Secretary was more alert and determined than his predecessors. For the first time in the history of British administration in South Africa, Downing Street had shown itself more zealous than Capetown. It was the solitary ray of light that broke the universal gloom in which South Africa was enshrouded by the catastrophe of the Raid.     CHAPTER II  THE CREED OF THE AFRIKANDER NATIONALISTS[16]           [Footnote 16: \"This is our Afrikander character. The          descendants of Hollanders, Germans and Frenchmen          inter-married, and are only known at present by their          surnames. They form the Afrikander nationality, and call          themselves Afrikanders. The Afrikanders are no more          Hollanders than Englishmen, Frenchmen, or Germans. They have          their own language, own morals and customs; they are just as          much a nation as any other.\"--_De Patriot_, in the course of          an article headed \"A Common but Dangerous Error\"--the error          in question being the assertion that \"the Cape Colony is an          English colony\" (translated and reproduced in _The Cape          Times_, September 3th, 1884).]   In the face of the colossal resistance offered to the British arms by the Boers and their colonial kinsmen in the South African War, it may seem unnecessary to produce any evidence in support of the contention that the military strength then displayed by the Dutch in South Africa was the result of long and careful preparation. But the same inability to grasp the facts of the South African situation which kept the Army Corps in England three months after it should have been sent to the Cape, is still to be met with. This attitude of mind--whether it be a consciousness of moral rectitude, or a mere insular disdain of looking at things from any but a British point of view--is still to be observed in the statements of those politicians who will even now deny that any trace of a definite plan of action, or of a concerted purpose, which could properly be described as a \"conspiracy\" against British supremacy was to be found among the Dutch population of South Africa as a whole, prior to the outbreak of the war. It is for the benefit of such politicians in part, and still more with a view of bringing the mind of the reader into something approaching a direct contact with the actual working of the Afrikander mind, that I transcribe a statement of the pure doctrine of the Bond, as it was expounded by the German, Borckenhagen, and his followers in the Free State. It will, however, be convenient to preface the quotation with a word of explanation in respect both of the text and the personality of Borckenhagen.  [Sidenote: Carl Borckenhagen.]  The passage, which is taken _verbatim_ from a work entitled, \"The Origin of the Anglo-Boer War Revealed,\" is a collection of sentences gathered from Dutch pamphlets and articles \"emanating from Holland,\" and translated literally into the somewhat uncouth English of the text. The author of the work, Mr. C. H. Thomas, was for many years a burgher of the Free State, where he shared the opinions of President Brand, and subsequently supported Mr. J. G. Fraser in opposing the policy of \"closer union\" with the South African Republic, advocated by Brand's successor, Mr. F. W. Reitz. The point of view from which the Dutch of Holland regarded the nationalist movement in South Africa was succinctly stated in an article published by the Amsterdam _Handelsblad_ in 1881.       \"The future of England lies in India, and the future of Holland      in South Africa.... When our capitalists vigorously develop this      trade, and, for example, form a syndicate to buy Delagoa Bay from      Portugal, then a railway from Capetown to Bloemfontein,      Potchefstroom, Pretoria, Delagoa Bay will be a lucrative      investment. And when, in course of time, the Dutch language shall      universally prevail in South Africa, this most extensive      territory will become a North America for Holland, and enable us      to balance the Anglo-Saxon race.\"[17]           [Footnote 17: Quoted by Du Toit in _De Patriot_: translation          from the English reprint of _De Transvaalse Oorlog_.]  Carl Borckenhagen, who, with Mr. Reitz,[18] advocated the establishment of the Bond in 1881, was a German republican. His name has been associated with Mr. Thomas's summary of the Bond propaganda in the Free State, because, as editor of _The Bloemfontein Express_ up to the time of his death, early in 1898, he was probably the most consistent of all the South African exponents of the nationalist creed. Certainly it is no exaggeration to say that he converted the Free State of Brand into the Free State of Steyn.

The whole of South Africa      belongs by just"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26490"],["title","Lord Milner's Work in South Africa (#8)"],["body","to the Afrikander nation. It is the      privilege and duty of every Afrikander to contribute all in his      power towards the expulsion of the English usurper. The States of      South Africa to be federated in one independent Republic.       The Afrikander Bond prepares for this consummation.       Argument in justification:--       (_a_) The transfer of the Cape Colony to the British Government      took place by circumstances of _force majeure_ and without the      consent of the Dutch nation, who renounced all claim in favour of      the Afrikander or Boer nation.       (_b_) Natal is territory which accrued to a contingent of the      Boer nation by purchase from the Zulu king, who received the      consideration agreed for.       (_c_) The British authorities expelled the rightful owners from      Natal by force of arms without just cause.       The task of the Afrikander Bond consists in:       (_a_) Procuring the staunch adhesion and co-operation of every      Afrikander and other real friend of the cause.       (_b_) To obtain the sympathy, the moral and effective aid, of one      or more of the world's Powers.       The means to accomplish those tasks are:       Personal persuasion, Press propaganda, legislation and diplomacy.       The direction of the application of these means is entrusted to a      select body of members eligible for their loyalty to the cause      and their abilities and position. That body will conduct such      measures as need the observance of special secrecy. Upon the rest      of the members will devolve activities of a general character      under the direction of the selected chiefs.       One of the indispensable requisites is the proper organisation of      an effective fund, which is to be regularly sustained. Bond      members will aid each other in all relations of public life in      preference to non-members.       In the efforts of gaining adherence to the cause it is of      importance to distinguish three categories of persons:       (1) The class of Afrikanders who are to some extent deteriorated      by assimilative influences with the English race, whose      restoration to patriotism will need great efforts, discretion,      and patience.       (2) The apparently unthinking and apathetic class who prefer to      relegate all initiative to leaders whom they will loyally follow.      This class is the most numerous by far.       (3) The warmly patriotic class, including men gifted with      intelligence, energy, and speech, qualified as leaders, and apt      to exercise influence over the rest.              *       *       *       *       *       Among these three classes many exist whose views and religious      scruples need to be corrected. Scripture abounds in proofs and      salient analogies applying to the situation and justifying our      cause. In this, as well as in other directions, the members who      work in circulating written propaganda will supply the correct      and conclusive arguments accessible to all.       Upon the basis of our just rights the British Government, if not      the entire nation, is the usurping enemy of the Boer nation.       In dealing with an enemy it is justifiable to employ, besides      force, also means of a less open character, such as diplomacy and      stratagem.  [Sidenote: Anti-british methods.]       The greatest danger to Afrikanderdom is the English policy of      Anglicising the Boer nation--to submerge it by the process of      assimilation.       A distinct attitude of holding aloof from English influences is      the only remedy against that peril and for thwarting that      insidious policy.       It is only such an attitude that will preserve the nation in its      simple faith and habits of morality, and provide safety against      the dangers of contamination and pernicious examples, with all      their fateful consequences to body and soul.       Let the Dutch language have the place of honour in schools and      homes.       Let alliances of marriage with the English be stamped as      unpatriotic.       Let every Afrikander see that he is at all times well armed with      the best possible weapons, and maintains the expert use of the      rifle among young and old, so as to be ready when duty calls, and      the time is ripe for asserting the nation's rights and being rid      of English thraldom.       Employ teachers only who are animated with truly patriotic      sentiments.       Let it be well understood that English domination will also bring      English intolerance and servitude, for it is only a very frail      link which separates the English State Church from actual      Romanism, and its proselytism _en bloc_ is only a matter of short      time.       Equally repugnant and dangerous is England's policy towards the      coloured races, whom she aims, for the sake of industrial profit,      at elevating to equal rank with whites, in direct conflict with      spiritual authority--a policy which incites coloured people to      rivalry with their superiors, and can only end in common      disaster.       Whilst remaining absolutely independent, the ties of blood,      relationship, and language point to Holland for a domestic base.       As to commerce, Germany, America, and other industrial nations      could more than fill the gap left by England, and such      connections should be cultivated as a potent means towards      obtaining foreign support to our cause and identification with      it.       If the mineral wealth of the Transvaal and Orange Free State      becomes established--as appears certain from discoveries already      made--England will not rest until these are also hers.       The leopard will retain its spots. The independence of both      Republics is at stake on that account alone, with the risk that      the rightful owners of the land will become the hewers of wood      and drawers of water for the usurpers.       There is no alternative hope for the peace and progress of South      Africa except by the total excision of the British ulcer.       Reliable signs are not wanting to show that our nation is      designed by Providence as the instrument for the recovery of its      rights, and for the chastisement of proud, perfidious      Albion.\"[19]           [Footnote 19: P. 64 _et seq._ of _The Origin of the          Anglo-Boer War Revealed_ (Hodder & Stoughton).]  These brief and disjointed sentences present in their shortest form arguments and exhortations with which the Dutch population of the Free State, the Transvaal, and the Cape Colony, were familiarised through the Press, the pulpit, the platform, and through individual intercourse and advocacy, from the time of the Retrocession in 1881 onwards. It is in effect the scheme of a Bond \"worked out more in detail by some friends at Bloemfontein,\" as published by Borckenhagen in his paper, _The Bloemfontein Express_, on April 7th, 1881, to which Du Toit, the founder of the Bond in the Cape Colony, referred in the pamphlet, _De Transvaalse Oorlog_ (The Transvaal War), which he issued from his press at the Paarl later on in the same year. The nationalist creed, as thus formulated, was preached consistently in the Free State; but in the Cape Colony it was modified by Hofmeyr to meet the exigencies of Colonial politics.  None the less it was in the Cape Colony that the Bond, as a political organisation, was destined to find its chief sphere of action. In the Free State it was discouraged by President Brand, and in point of fact the British population was too insignificant a factor in the politics of the central republic to make it necessary to maintain a distinct organisation for the promotion of nationalist sentiment. In the Transvaal, again, the Bond maintained no regular organisation. And this for two reasons. Every burgher of the northern Republic was sufficiently animated by the anti-British sentiments which it was intended to promote; and the only \"constitution\" which the Transvaal Dutch would accept was one which embodied principles so flagrantly inconsistent with submission to British authority that it could not be adopted by the branches of the Bond in the Cape Colony without exposing its members to immediate prosecution for high treason.[20]           [Footnote 20: Under the changed conditions of to-day the Boer          population is organised in the Transvaal into _Het Volk_, and          in the Orange River Colony into the _Oranjie Unie_; both          practically identical with the Bond in the Cape Colony.]  [Sidenote: The origin of the Bond.]  In the politics of the Cape Colony, however, the Bond became the predominant force; and any picture, however briefly sketched, of South Africa as it was when Lord Milner's administration commenced, must include some account of the origin and methods of this remarkable organisation.  The origin of the Afrikander Bond is to be found in the articles written by the Rev. S. J. du Toit, a Dutch predikant, in _De Patriot_, a newspaper published at the Paarl, of which he was the editor. Mr. du Toit's political standpoint is sufficiently revealed by the fact that in 1881 he claimed that _De Patriot_ had done more than any other single agency to secure the successful revolt of the Boers from British authority accomplished in that year. The inspiration which drove his pen to advocate the founding of a political organisation, that should serve to prepare the way for a more general and complete \"war of independence,\" was the defeat of the British troops by the Transvaal burghers.       \"This is now our time,\" he wrote, in the same year, \"to establish      the Bond, while a national consciousness has been awakened      through the Transvaal War. And the Bond must be our preparation      for the future confederation of all the States and Colonies of      South Africa.
