Sometimes particles of metal collect between the teeth of a file and make deep scratches as the file is passed across the work. When this occurs, the teeth should be cleaned by using a wire brush or a file card, which is drawn across the file in the direction of the teeth. This forming of tiny particles between the teeth is known as \"pinning\" and it can sometimes be avoided by rubbing chalk on the file. Filing is not only done to obtain a smooth finish, but also to reduce the work to an exact diameter, as a very slight reduction can be made in this way.  [Illustration: Fig. 12. Two Methods of Aligning Centers for Cylindrical Turning]  If a polish is desired, this can be obtained by holding a piece of emery cloth tightly around the work as it revolves. The coarseness of emery cloth is indicated by letters and numbers corresponding to the grain number of loose emery. The letters and numbers for grits ranging from fine to coarse are as follows: _FF_, _F_, 120, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 54, 46, 40. For large work roughly filed, use coarse cloth such as Nos. 46 or 54, and then finer grades to obtain the required polish. If the work has been carefully filed, a good polish can be obtained with Nos. 60 and 90 cloth, and a brilliant polish by finishing with No. 120 and flour-emery.  Most cylindrical parts can be finished more quickly and accurately in the grinder than in the lathe, and many classes of work are, at the present time, simply rough-turned in the lathe and then ground to size in a cylindrical grinding machine.  =Aligning Centers for Cylindrical Turning.=--When a rod or shaft must be turned cylindrical or to the same diameter throughout its entire length, it is good practice to test the alignment of the centers, before inserting the work. The position of the tailstock center for cylindrical turning may be indicated by the coincidence of graduation marks on the base, but if accuracy is necessary, the relative position of the two centers should be determined in a more positive way. A very simple and convenient method of testing the alignment is shown at _A_ in Fig. 12. The work is first turned for a short distance, near the dogged end, as shown, and the tool is left as set for this cut; then the tailstock center is withdrawn and the work is moved sufficiently to permit running the tool back to the tailstock end without changing its original setting. A short cut is then taken at this end and the diameters _d_ and _d_{1}_ are carefully compared. In case there is any variation, the tailstock center is adjusted laterally, other trial cuts are taken, and the test repeated.  Another method is illustrated at _B_, which requires the use of a test-bar _t_. This bar should have accurately made centers and the ends finished to exactly the same diameter. The lathe centers are aligned by placing the bar between them and then testing the position of the ends. This can be done by comparing each end with a tool held in the toolpost and moved from one to the other by shifting the carriage, but a better method is to clamp a test indicator _i_ in the toolpost and bring it in contact with first one end of the bar and then the other. If the dial does not register the same at each end, it shows that the lathe centers are not in line. Even when centers are correctly set, lathes that have been in use a long time do not always turn cylindrical or straight, because if the ways that guide the carriage are worn unevenly, the tool as it moves along does not remain in the same plane and this causes a variation in the diameter of the part being turned.  =Application of Drivers or Dogs.=--Work that is turned between centers is sometimes driven by a dog which is so short for the faceplate that the bent driving end bears against the bottom _a_ of the faceplate slot, as shown at _A_, Fig. 13. If the dog is nearly the right length, it may allow the headstock center to enter the center in the work part way, with the result that the turned surface is not true with the centers. When a driving dog of this type is used, care should be taken to see that it moves freely in the faceplate slot and does not bind against the bottom. By using a straight dog (_B_), which is driven by a pin _b_ bolted to the faceplate, all danger from this source is eliminated. The straight dog, however, is used more particularly to do away with the leverage _l_ of a bent dog, as this leverage tends to spring a flexible part when a cut is being taken.  [Illustration: Fig. 13. (A) Dog that is too Short for Faceplate. (B) Straight Driving Dog]  Straight dogs are also made with two driving ends which engage pins on opposite sides of the faceplate. This type is preferable because it applies the power required for turning, evenly to the work, which still further reduces the tendency to spring it out of shape. The principal objection to the double-ended type lies in the difficulty of adjusting the driving pins so that each bears with equal pressure against the dog. The double-ended driver is often used for large work especially if deep roughing cuts are necessary.  =Lathe Arbors or Mandrels.=--When it is necessary to turn the outside of a part having a hole through it, centers cannot, of course, be drilled in the ends and other means must be resorted to. We shall assume that the bushing _B_, Fig. 14, has a finished hole through the center, and it is desired to turn the outside cylindrical and concentric with the hole. This could be done by forcing a tightly-fitted arbor _M_, having accurately-centered ends, into the bushing and inserting the mandrel and work between the lathe centers _h_ and _h_{1}_ as shown. Evidently, if the arbor runs true on its centers, the hole in the bushing will also run true and the outside can be turned the same as though the arbor and bushing were a solid piece. From this it will be seen that an arbor simply forms a temporary support for parts that are bored and therefore cannot be centered.  [Illustration: Fig. 14. Bushing mounted on Arbor for Turning]  Another example of work that would be turned on an arbor is shown in Fig. 15. This is a small cast-iron wheel having a finished hole through the hub, and the outer surface and sides of the rim are to be turned true with this hole. In this case, the casting would also be held by pressing a mandrel through the hub; as shown. This method, however, would only apply to comparatively small wheels because it would be difficult, if not impossible, to prevent a large wheel from turning on the arbor when taking a cut, and even if it could be driven, large work could be done to better advantage on another type of machine. (The vertical boring mill is used extensively for turning large wheels, as explained in Chapter VI.) When turning the outside of the rim, a tool similar to that shown at _t_ should be used, but for facing or turning the sides, it might be better, if not necessary, to use tools having bent ends as shown by the dotted lines; in fact, turning tools of various kinds are made with the ends bent to the right or left, as this enables them to be used on surfaces that could not be reached very well with a straight tool. If a comparatively large pulley is mounted near the end of the arbor, it can be driven directly by pins attached to the faceplate and engaging the pulley arms. This method of driving is often employed when the diameter to be turned is large and the hole for the arbor is so small that there will not be sufficient friction for driving.  [Illustration: Fig. 15. Turning Pulley Held on an Arbor]  =Different Types of Lathe Arbors.=--Three different types of lathe arbors are shown in Fig. 16. The kind shown at _A_ is usually made of tool steel and the body is finished to a standard size. The ends are somewhat reduced and flat spots are milled, as shown, to give the clamping screw of the dog a good grip. The body of the arbor is usually tapered about 0.006 inch per foot. This taper makes it easier to insert the arbor in a close-fitting hole, and it also permits slight variations in the diameter of different holes. As to hardening, the practice at the present time among manufacturers is to harden arbors all over, but for extremely accurate work, an arbor having hardened ends and a soft body is generally considered superior, as there is less tendency of distortion from internal stresses. Hardened arbors are \"seasoned\" before finish-grinding to relieve these internal stresses.  The solid type _A_, Fig. 16, is used very extensively, but in shops where a great variety of work is being done and there are many odd-sized holes, some form of expanding arbor _B_ can be used to advantage. This type, instead of being solid, consists of a tapering inner arbor _M_ on which is placed a split bushing that can be expanded, within certain limits, by driving in the tapering member. The advantage of this type is that a comparatively small stock of arbors is required, as different-sized bushings can be used. This type can also be fitted to holes of odd sizes, whereas a solid arbor must be provided for each different size hole, unless the variation is very slight. The latter are, however, more accurate than the expanding type.  [Illustration: Fig. 16. Different Types of Lathe Arbors]  Another form of expanding arbor is shown at _C_. This type has a straight body _N_ in which four tapering grooves are cut lengthwise, as shown, and there is a sleeve _S_, containing four slots that are located to correspond with the tapering grooves. Strips s are fitted into these slots, and as the part _N_ is driven in, the strips are moved outward as they ascend the tapering grooves. By having different sets of these strips of various heights, one arbor of this type can be made to cover quite a range of sizes. It is not suited, however, to thin work, as the pressure, being concentrated in four places, would spring a flexible part out of shape.  The cone arbor or mandrel"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34030"],["title","Turning and Boring (#4)"],["body","at _A_, in Fig. 17, is convenient for holding parts having comparatively large holes, as it can be adjusted for quite a range of diameters. The work is gripped between the two cones _c_ and _c_{1}_ which are forced together by nut _n_. The cones are prevented from turning upon the arbor by keys. This style of arbor should not be used for accurate work. The threaded arbor _B_ is used for facing the sides of nuts square with the tapped hole. When a nut is first put upon the arbor, the rough side comes against an equalizing washer _w_. This washer rests against a spherical seat so that it can shift to provide a uniform bearing for the rough side of the nut, even though it is not square with the tapped hole. This feature prevents the nut from being canted on the arbor and insures an accurately faced nut. The revolving conical center shown at _C_ is often used for holding a pipe or tube while turning the outside. The cone is adjusted to fit into the hole of the pipe, by means of the tailstock spindle, and the opposite end is usually held in a chuck.  [Illustration: Fig. 17. (A) Cone Arbor. (B) Nut Arbor. (C) Pipe Center]  Particular care should be taken to preserve the accuracy of the centers of lathe arbors by keeping them clean and well-oiled while in use.  =Mandrel or Arbor Press.=--The best method of inserting an arbor of the solid type in a hole is by using a press, Fig. 18, designed for that purpose, but if such a press is not available and it is necessary to drive the mandrel in, a \"soft\" hammer, made of copper, lead or other soft material, should be used to protect the centered end of the arbor. In either case, the arbor should not be forced in too tightly, for if it fits properly, this will not be necessary in order to hold the work securely. On the other hand, the work might easily be broken by attempting to force the arbor in as far and as tightly as possible. In using the arbor press, the work is placed on the base _B_ with the hole in a vertical position, and the arbor (which should be oiled slightly) is forced down into it by ram _R_, operated by lever _L_. Slots are provided in the base, as shown, so that the end of the arbor can come through at the bottom of the hole. The lever of this particular press is counter-weighted so that it rises to a vertical position when released. The ram can then be adjusted quickly to any required height by the handwheel seen at the left.  [Illustration: Fig. 18. Press for Forcing Arbors into Work]  Some shops are equipped with power-driven mandrel or arbor presses. This type is particularly desirable for large work, owing to the greater pressure required for inserting mandrels that are comparatively large in diameter. One well-known type of power press is driven by a belt, and the downward pressure of the ram is controlled by a handwheel. The ram is raised or lowered by turning this handwheel in one direction or the other, and a gage shows how much pressure is being applied. This type of press can also be used for other purposes, such as forcing bushings or pins into or out of holes, bending or straightening parts, or for similar work.  [Illustration: Fig. 19. Steadyrest and Follow-rest for Supporting Flexible Parts]  =Steadyrest for Supporting Flexible Parts.=--Occasionally long slender shafts, rods, etc., which have to be turned, are so flexible that it is necessary to support them at some point between the lathe centers. An attachment for the lathe known as a steadyrest is often used for this purpose. A steadyrest is composed of a frame containing three jaws _J_ (Fig. 19), that can be adjusted in or out radially by turning screws _S_. The frame is hinged at _h_, thus allowing the upper half to be swung back (as shown by the dotted lines) for inserting or removing the work. The bolt-clamp _c_ holds the hinged part in the closed position. The base of the frame has V-grooves in it that fit the ways of the lathe bed. When the steadyrest is in use, it is secured to the bed by clamp _C_, and the jaws _J_ are set in against the work, thus supporting or steadying it during the turning operation. The steadyrest must, of course, be located at a point where it will not interfere with the turning tool.  [Illustration: Fig. 20. Application of Steadyrest to a Flexible Rod]  Fig. 20 shows the application of the steadyrest to a long forged rod, having one small end, which makes it too flexible to be turned without support. As this forging is rough, a true surface _n_ a little wider than the jaws _J_ (Fig. 19) is first turned as a bearing for the jaws. This should be done very carefully to prevent the work from mounting the tool. A sharp pointed tool should be used and very light cuts taken. The steadyrest is next clamped to the lathe bed opposite the turned surface, and the jaws are adjusted in against this surface, thus forming a bearing. Care should be taken not to set up the jaws too tightly, as the work should turn freely but without play. The large part of the rod and central collar are then turned to size, this half being machined while the small part is in the rough and as stiff as possible. The rod is then reversed and the steadyrest is applied to the part just finished, as shown at _B_, thus supporting the work while the small end is being turned. That part against which the jaws bear should be kept well oiled, and if the surface is finished it should be protected by placing a strip of emery cloth beneath the jaws with the emery side out; a strip of belt leather is also used for this purpose, the object in each case being to prevent the jaws from scratching and marring the finished surface, as they tend to do, especially if at all rough.  If the work were too flexible to permit turning a spot at _n_, this could be done by first \"spotting\" it at some point _o_, and placing the steadyrest at that point while turning another spot at _n_.  Sometimes it is desirable to apply a steadyrest to a surface that does not run true and one which is not to be turned; in such a case a device called a \"cat-head\" is used. This is simply a sleeve _S_ (Fig. 21) which is placed over the untrue surface to serve as a bearing for the steadyrest. The sleeve is made to run true by adjusting the four set-screws at each end, and the jaws of the steadyrest are set against it, thus supporting the work.  [Illustration: Fig. 21. Cat-head which is sometimes used as Bearing for Steadyrest]  =Application of Steadyrest when Boring.=--Another example illustrating the use of the steadyrest is shown in Fig. 22. The rod _R_ is turned on the outside and a hole is to be bored in the end (as shown by dotted lines) true with the outer surface. If the centers used for turning the rod are still in the ends, as they would be ordinarily, this work could be done very accurately by the following method: The rod is first placed between the centers as for turning, with a driving dog _D_ attached, and the steadyrest jaws _J_ are set against it near the outer end, as shown.  Before any machine work is done, means must be provided for holding the rod back against the headstock center _h_, because, for an operation of this kind, the outer end cannot be supported by the tailstock center; consequently the work tends to shift to the right. One method of accomplishing this is shown in the illustration. A hardwood piece _w_, having a hole somewhat larger than the work, is clamped against the dog, in a crosswise position, by the swinging bolts and thumb-screws shown. If the dog is not square with the work, the wood piece should be canted so that the bearing will not be all on one side. For large heavy parts a similar \"bridle\" or \"hold-back\"--as this is commonly called--is made by using steel instead of wood for the part _w_. Another very common method which requires no special equipment is illustrated in Fig. 23. An ordinary leather belt lacing _L_ is attached to the work and faceplate while the latter is screwed off a few turns as shown. Then the lacing is drawn up by hand and tied, and the faceplate is screwed onto the spindle, thus tightening the lacing and drawing the work against the headstock center. The method of applying the lacing is quite clearly indicated in the illustration. If a small driving faceplate is used, it may be necessary to drill holes for the belt lacing, as shown.  [Illustration: Fig. 22. Shaft supported by Steadyrest for Drilling and Boring End]  A hole is next drilled in the end of the rod by using a twist drill in the tailstock. If the hole is finished by boring, a depth mark should be made on the tool shank that will warn the workman of the cutting end's approach to the bottom. A chuck can also be used in connection with a steadyrest for doing work of this kind, as shown in Fig. 24, the end of the rod being held and driven by the chuck _C_. If the piece is centered, it can be held on these centers while setting the steadyrest and adjusting the chuck, but if the ends are without centers, a very good way is to make light centers in the ends with a punch; after these are properly located they are used for holding the work until the steadyrest and chuck jaws have been adjusted. In case it is necessary to have the end hole very accurate with the outside of the finished rod, a test indicator _I_ should be applied to the shaft as shown. This is an instrument which shows with great accuracy whether a rotating part runs true and it is also used for many other purposes in machine shops. The indicator is held in the lathe toolpost and the contact point beneath the dial is brought against the work. If the latter does not run true, the hand of the indicator vibrates and the graduations on the dial show how much the work is out in thousandths of an inch.  [Illustration: Fig. 23. Hold-back used when Outer End of Work is held in Steadyrest]  =The Follow-rest.=--When turning long slender parts, such as shafts, etc., a follow-rest is often used for supporting the work.
