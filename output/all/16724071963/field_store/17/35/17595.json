After boiling until the steam comes through, the mass is grained with salt as before and allowed to settle one and one-half to three hours. These lyes, known as _strengthening lyes_ are run to storage to be used subsequently with fresh fat to take up the caustic soda contained therein.  The soap is now ready for finishing and is first boiled through and tried for strength. A drop of phenolphthalein (1 per cent. phenolphthalein in 98 per cent. alcohol) is allowed to drop on the molten soap taken up on a trowel. The red color should be instantly produced and develop to a full deep crimson in a few seconds, or more lye must be added until this condition is realized. Should it flash a deep crimson immediately it is on the strong side. This cannot be conveniently remedied; it can only serve as a guide for the next boil, but in any case it is not of any serious consequence, unless it is too strong.  With the steam on, the soap is now examined with a trowel which must be thoroughly heated by working it about under the surface of the hot soap. The appearance of the soap as it runs from the face of the trowel indicates its condition. It is not possible to absolutely describe the effect, which can only be properly judged by practice, yet the following points may serve as a guide. The indications to be noticed are the shape and size of the flakes of soap as the sample on the trowel breaks up and runs from the hot iron surface, when the latter is turned in a vertical position, as well as the condition of the iron surface from which the soap flakes have fallen. A closed soap will run slowly into a homogeneous sheet, leaving the trowel's surface covered with a thin layer of transparent soap; a grained mass will run rapidly down in tiny grains, about one-half an inch in diameter or less, leaving the hot trowel absolutely dry. The object of the finish is to separate the soaps of the lower fatty acids from those of the higher, and both from excess of liquid. A point midway between \"open\" and \"closed\" is required to arrive at this point.  Having arrived at the above condition, the soap is allowed to settle anywhere from one to three days and then run off through the skimmer pipes to the nigre and framed or pumped to the tank feeding the drying machine.  The stock thus obtained should be fairly white, depending upon the grade of tallow used and slightly alkaline to an alcoholic phenolphthalein solution. If removed at exactly the neutral point or with a content of free fat the soap will sooner or later develop rancidity. The soap thus obtained is an ordinary tallow base, and the one by far greatest used in the manufacture of toilet soaps. The percentage of cocoanut oil indicated is not fixed and may readily be varied, while in fine toilet soap the rosin is usually eliminated.  In the manufacture of full boiled soda soaps in which no glycerine is obtained as a by-product, it being retained in the soap itself, the soap formed is known as a \"run\" soap. The process is used most extensively in the manufacture of marine soaps by which the method may be best illustrated. This soap is known as marine soap because of its property of readily forming a lather with salt water and is mostly consumed aboard vessels.  Marine soaps are manufactured by first placing in the kettle a calculated amount of lye of 25 deg. to 35 deg. B., depending upon the amount of moisture desired in the finished soaps, plus a slight excess required to saponify a known weight of cocoanut oil. With open steam on, the cocoanut oil is then gradually added, care being taken that the soap does not froth over. Saponification takes place readily and when the oil is entirely saponified the finished soap is put through the process known as running. This consists in constantly pumping the mass from the skimmer pipe back into the top of the kettle, the object being to prevent any settling of the nigre or lye from the soap, as well as producing a homogeneous mass. It is customary to begin the saponification in the morning, which should be completed by noon. The soap is then run for about three hours and framed the next morning. After having remained in the frame the time required to solidify and cool, the soap is slabbed and cut into cakes. This process is difficult to carry out properly, and one not greatly employed, although large quantities of marine soap are purchased by the government for use in the navy and must fulfill certain specifications required by the purchasing department.  In making potash soaps it is practically impossible to obtain any glycerine directly because of the pasty consistency of the soap, and no graining is possible because the addition of salt to a soft soap, as already explained, would form a soda soap. Large quantities of soft soaps are required for the textile industries who desire mostly a strong potash soap, and the large number of automobiles in use at the present time has opened a field for the use of a soft soap for washing these. A soap for this purpose must be neutral so as not to affect the varnish or paint of automobiles.  A suitable soap for textile purposes may be made as follows:      Red oil                         80     parts     House grease                    20     parts     Caustic soda lye, 36 degs. B.    3     parts     Carbonate of potash              5-1/2 parts     Caustic potash                  23-1/4 parts  Olive oil, corn oil, soya bean oil, olive oil foots or cottonseed oil may replace any of the above oils. A large quantity of cottonseed oil will cause the soap to fig.  To carry out the process, the caustic potash and carbonate of potash are dissolved and placed in the kettle together with the soda lye, and the oils added. This is most satisfactorily accomplished by being finished the day before the boiling is begun. The next day the boiling is begun and water added to bring the soap up to the desired percentage of fatty acid, due allowance being made for the water formed by the condensation of the open steam in boiling. Care must be taken that the soap in the kettle does not swell and run over during the saponification. A good procedure is to use open steam for a period of about two hours, then close the valve and allow the saponification to continue without boiling, and repeat this until it is entirely saponified. After the saponification has been completed the soap is briskly boiled all day and the proper corrections made; that is, if too alkaline, more oil is added, and if free fat is present, more potash. About 2 per cent. carbonate of potash is the proper amount for a soap containing 50 per cent. fatty acid. The soap is sampled by allowing it to drop on a clean, cold glass surface. In so doing, the soap should not slide or slip over the glass surface when pressed thereon, but should adhere to the glass, or it is too alkaline. A sample worked between the fingers showing too much stringiness should have more strong potash and oil added. A sample taken out in a pail and allowed to cool over night will serve as a guide as to the body of the soap in the kettle. When the soap has thus been properly finished it is run into barrels.  For an automobile soap the following is a good working formula:      Corn oil                       1,000 parts     Potash lye, 31-1/2 degs. B.      697 parts  Proceed as in the directions just given for textile soap in placing charge in the kettle. When the kettle is boiling up well, shut off the steam and the saponification will complete itself. The soap may be run into the barrels the next day.  A heavy soap with a smaller percentage of fat may be made as follows:      Corn oil                       1,000 parts     Potash lye, 24-1/2 degs. B.      900 parts  Boil until the soap bunches, and shovel the finished soap into barrels. Upon standing it will clear up. By the addition of more water the yield of soap per pound of oil may be run up to 300 per cent.  After soft soaps have been allowed to stand for some time the phenomenon known as \"figging\" often occurs. This term is applied to a crystalline-like formation, causing spots of a star-like shape throughout the soap. This is undoubtedly due to the stearine content of the soap crystallizing out as it cools, and forming these peculiarly-shaped spots. It more generally occurs in the winter and may be produced artificially by adding a small quantity of soda to the potash lye before saponification.  The oils usually employed in the manufacture of potash soaps are cottonseed oil, corn oil, soya bean oil, olive oil foots, red oil, cocoanut oil, grease and the various train oils. The usual percentage yield is from 225 per cent. to 300 per cent., based upon the weight of oil used. In calculating the weight of a soft soap it is to be remembered that since potassium has a higher molecular weight (56) than sodium (40), the corresponding soap formed is that much greater in weight when compared with a sodium soap. Rosin may be added to soft soaps as a cheapening agent.   COLD PROCESS.  The cold process for manufacturing soap is the simplest method of soap making, and the equipment required is small when compared to the other methods. All the more expensive equipment that is necessary is a crutcher, a tank to hold the lye, frames, a slabber or cutting table, and a press. Yet, in spite of the simplicity of thus making soap, the disadvantages are numerous for the production of a good piece of soap. The greatest difficulty is to obtain a thorough combination of oil or fat and lye so that there will not be an excess of one or the other in the finished soap. At its best there is either a considerable excess of free fat which later exhibits itself in producing rancidity or uncombined caustic, which produces an unpleasant effect on the skin when the soap is consumed for washing. The latter objection, of course, can only be applied to toilet soaps.  Cocoanut oil is used very "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34171"],["title","Toppleton's Client; Or, A Spirit in Exile (#0)"],["body","TOPPLETON'S CLIENT  OR  _A SPIRIT IN EXILE_  BY JOHN KENDRICK BANGS            NEW YORK           CHARLES L.

HOPKINS TOPPLETON.   MR. HOPKINS TOPPLETON, Barrister of London and New York, was considered by his intimates a most fortunate young man. He was accounted the happy possessor of an income of something over fifty thousand dollars a year, derived from investments which time had shown to be as far removed from instability, and as little influenced by the fluctuations of the stock market, as the pyramids of Egypt themselves. Better than this, however, better even than personal beauty, with which he was plentifully endowed, Mr. Hopkins Toppleton was blessed with a great name, which he had received ready-made from his illustrious father, late head of the legal firm of Toppleton, Morley, Harkins, Perkins, Mawson, Bronson, Smithers and Hicks. The value of the name to Hopkins was unquestionable, since it enabled him, at his father's death, to enter that famous aggregation of legal talent as a special partner, although his knowledge of law was scant, receiving a share of the profits of the concern for the use of his patronymic, which, owing to his father's pre-eminent success at the Bar, Messrs. Morley, Harkins, _et al._, were anxious to retain. This desire of Mr. Toppleton's late associates was most natural, for such was the tremendous force exerted by the name he bore, that plaintiffs when they perceived it arrayed in opposition to their claims, not infrequently withdrew their suits, or offered terms upon which any defendant of sense might be induced to compromise. On the other hand, when a defendant found himself confronted with the fact that Hopkins Toppleton, Sen., had joined forces with the plaintiff, he usually either settled the claim against him in full or placed himself beyond the jurisdiction of the courts.  When Toppleton, Sen., died, it was very generally believed that the firm, whose name has already been mentioned at some length, lost not only its head, but also a very large proportion of its brains,--a situation quite as logical as it was unfortunate for the gentlemen with whom Mr. Toppleton had been associated. Nor was this feeling, that with the departure of Toppleton, the illustrious, for other worlds the firm was deprived of a most considerable portion of its claims to high standing, confined to cavilling outsiders. No one recognized the unhappy state of affairs at the busy office on Broadway more quickly than did Messrs. Morley, Harkins, Perkins, Mawson, Bronson, Smithers, and Hicks themselves, and at the first meeting of the firm, after the funeral of their dead partner, these gentlemen unanimously resolved that something must be done.  It was at this meeting that Mr. Hicks suggested that the only course left for the bereaved firm to pursue, if it desired to remain an aggressive force in its chosen profession, was to retain the name of Toppleton at the mast-head, and, as Mr. Mawson put it, \"to bluff it out.\" Mr. Perkins agreed with Mr. Hicks, and suggested that the only honest way to do this was to induce Mr. Toppleton's only son, known to all--even to the clerks in the office--as Hoppy, to enter the firm as a full partner.  \"I do not think,\" Mr. Perkins said, \"that it is quite proper for us to assume a virtue that we do not possess, and while Hoppy--I should say Hopkins--has never studied law, I think he could be induced to do so, in which event he could be taken in here, and we should have a perfectly equitable claim to all the business which the name of Toppleton would certainly bring to us.\"  \"I am afraid,\" Mr. Bronson put in at this point, \"I am very much afraid that such a course would require the entire reorganization of the firm's machinery. It would never do for the member whose name stands at the head of our partnership designation, to be on such terms of intimacy with the office boys, for instance, as to permit of his being addressed by them as Hoppy; nor would it conduce toward good discipline, I am convinced, for the nominal head of the concern to be engaged in making pools on baseball games with our book-keepers and clerks, which, during his lamented father's life, I understand was one of the lad's most cherished customs. Now, while I agree with my friend Perkins that it is desirable that the firm should have an unassailable basis for its retention of the name of Toppleton, I do not agree with him that young Hopkins should be taken in here if we are to retain our present highly efficient force of subordinates. They would be utterly demoralized in less than a month.\"  \"But what do you suggest as an alternative?\" inquired Mr. Morley.  \"I believe that we should make Hopkins a special partner in the firm, and have him travel abroad for his health,\" returned Mr. Bronson after a moment's reflection.  \"I regret to say,\" objected Mr. Hicks, \"that Hoppy's health is distressingly good. Your point in regard to the probable demoralization of our office force, however, is well taken. Hopkins must go abroad if he becomes one of us; but I suggest that instead of sending him for his health, we establish a London branch office, and put him in charge on a salary of, say, 10,000 dollars. We have no business interests outside of this country, so that such a course, in view of his absolute ignorance of law, would be perfectly safe, and we could give Hoppy to understand in the event of his acceptance of our proposition that he shall be free to take a vacation whenever he pleases, for as long a period of time as he pleases, and the oftener the better.\"  \"That's the best plan, I think,\" said Mr. Mawson. \"In fact, if Hoppy declines that responsible office, I wouldn't mind taking it myself.\"  And so it happened. The proposition was made to Hopkins, and he accepted it with alacrity. He did not care for the practice of the law, but he had no objection to receiving an extra ten thousand dollars a year as a silent partner in a flourishing concern with headquarters in London, particularly when his sole duties were to remain away from the office on a perpetual vacation.  \"I was born with a love of rest,\" Hoppy once said in talking over his prospects with his friends some time before the proposition of his father's partners had been submitted to him. \"Even as a baby I was fond of it. I remember my mother saying that I slept for nearly the whole of my first year of existence, and when I came to my school days my reputation with my teachers was, that in the enjoyment of recess and in assiduous devotion to all that pertained to a life of elegant leisure, there was not a boy in school who could approach me.\"  The young man never railed at fate for compelling him to lead a life which would have filled others of robuster ideas with ennui, but he did on occasions find fault with the powers for having condemned him to birth in a country like the United States, where the man of leisure is regarded with less of reverence than of derision.  \"It is a no harder fate for the soul of an artist to dwell in the body of a pork-packer,\" he had said only the night before the plan outlined by Mr. Hicks was brought to his attention, \"than for a man of my restful tendencies to be at home in a land where the hustler alone inspires respect. What the fates should have done in my case was clearly to have had me born a rich duke or a prince, whose chief duty it would be to lead the fashionable world and to set styles of dress for others to follow. I'd have made a magnificent member of the House of Lords, or proprietor of a rich estate somewhere in England, with nothing to do but to spend my income and open horse shows; but in New York there is no leisure class of recognized standing, excepting, of course, the messenger-boys and the plumbers, and even they do not command the respect which foreign do-nothings inspire. It's hard luck. The only redeeming feature of the case is that owing to a high tariff I can spend my money with less effort here than I could abroad.\"  Then came the proposition from the firm, and in it Hoppy recognized the ingredients of the ideal life--a life of rest in a country capable of understanding the value to society of the drones, a life free from"]]]
