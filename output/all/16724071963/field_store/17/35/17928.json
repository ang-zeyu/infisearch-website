To-day we clothe our thoughts of death with flowers laid upon the bier, and in our cemeteries with amaranth blossoms, evergreen leaves, fragrant recesses, cool grottos, smiling fountains, and white monuments. The dismal gray stones of church-yards have crumbled into decay, as our ideas of Life have grown more spiritual; and in place of \"bat and owl on the bending stones, are wreaths of immortelles, and white fingers pointing upward.\" Thus it is that our ideas of divinity form our models of humanity. O Christian Scientist, thou of the church of the new-born; awake to a higher and holier love for God and man; put on the whole armor of Truth; rejoice in hope; be patient in tribulation,--that ye may go to the bed of anguish, and look upon this dream of life in matter, girt with a higher sense of omnipotence; and behold once again the power of divine Life and Love to heal and reinstate man in God's own image and likeness, having \"one Lord, one faith, one baptism.\"     The University Press, Cambridge, U.S.A."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35097"],["title","Edvard Grieg : The Story of the Boy Who Made Music in the Land of the Midnight (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net                                      CHILD'S OWN BOOK                           _of Great Musicians_                                  GRIEG                               [Illustration]                                    _By_                              THOMAS TAPPER                            THEODORE PRESSER CO.                           1712 CHESTNUT STREET                              ｷPHILADELPHIAｷ                                  [Illustration]                           Directions for Binding   Enclosed in this envelope is the cord and the needle with which to bind this book.

THEO. PRESSER CO., Pub's., Phila., Pa.                               HOW TO USE THIS BOOK   This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN BOOK OF GREAT MUSICIANS, written by Thomas Tapper, author of \"Pictures from the Lives of the Great Composers for Children,\" \"Music Talks with Children,\" \"First Studies in Music Biography,\" and others.  The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut apart by the child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its proper place throughout the book, pasted in the space containing the same number as will be found under each picture on the sheet. It is not necessary to cover the entire back of a picture with paste. Put it only on the corners and place neatly within the lines you will find printed around each space. Use photographic paste, if possible.  After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous pages.  The book is then to be sewed by the child through the center with the cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book thus becomes the child's own book.  This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth while.                     *       *       *       *       *  This series of the Child's Own Book of Great Musicians includes at present a book on each of the following:      Bach                    Grieg                   Mozart     Beethoven               Handel                  Nevin     Brahms                  Haydn                   Schubert     Chopin                  Liszt                   Schumann     Dvor疚                  MacDowell               Tschaikowsky     Foster                  Mendelssohn             Verdi                                                     Wagner                              [Illustration: No. 1]                           [Illustration: No. 7]                           [Illustration: No. 18]                           [Illustration: No. 22]                           [Illustration: No. 11]                           [Illustration: No. 5]                           [Illustration: No. 17]                           [Illustration: No. 21]                           [Illustration: No. 3]                           [Illustration: No. 13]                           [Illustration: No. 14]                           [Illustration: No. 15]                           [Illustration: No. 6]                           [Illustration: No. 19]                           [Illustration: No. 20]                           [Illustration: No. 12]                           [Illustration: No. 8]                           [Illustration: No. 9]                           [Illustration: No. 4]                           [Illustration: No. 16]                           [Illustration: No. 2]                           [Illustration: No. 10]                                   EDVARD GRIEG                          The Story of the Boy Who                          Made Music in the Land                           of the Midnight Sun                            This Book was made by                      ..................................

The Story of the Boy Who Made Music                     in the Land of the Midnight Sun   This is the picture of a boy who was born in the north of the world. He loved his mother country and the music which the people sang.  But he had music, all his own, that sang and sang in his heart. It was happy music and sad; solemn and joyous. You will hear it some day and love it all.  Even when this little boy was in the primary school the music knocked at his heart's door as if it would say:  \"Let me out into the world so that people may hear me.\"                    [Illustration: No. 2 GRIEG AS A BOY]  When he was twelve years old he started out one morning as usual, but instead of taking his school books he took with him his music writing book which contained what he termed \"Variation on a German Melody Op. 1.\"         [Illustration: No. 3 FROM THE NORWEGIAN BRIDAL PROCESSION]  Can you not imagine how proud he must have been of his Op. 1?                  [Illustration: No. 4 GRIEG'S SIGNATURE]  His schoolmates were very proud to see the music of their companion Edvard. But alas! While they were looking at it and talking about it, whom do you think came creeping up behind them?  Why, the schoolmaster, to be sure.  He gave little Edvard a rough shaking up and told him how severely he would be punished if ever again he brought such nonsense to school.  Poor old schoolmaster! He did not know what Edvard Grieg would one day mean to the land and people of Norway. For Edvard loved not only the music that kept singing in him, but he loved Norway and all its people. Do you think any one could help loving such mountains as these?               [Illustration: No. 5 NORWEGIAN MOUNTAIN SCENE]  But all the grown up folks of Edvard's world did not call his music rubbish. His mother loved music and played beautifully. It was from her that Edvard had his first lessons, just as Mendelssohn was first taught by his mother.  Then one day something wonderful happened. A great violinist, Ole Bull by name, visited the Grieg family in the country. He was so kind to the little composer that the boy just loved him.                       [Illustration: No. 6 OLE BULL]  Ole Bull had traveled the world over playing the violin. He looked over Edvard's compositions and made the boy play them to him. You can see him nodding his head in pleasure as he listens. His fine eyes are lighted up. He tells the boy composer that his music is quite good, but that there is a lot for him to learn yet. So he must study earnestly and make many sacrifices.  Then Ole Bull sits down and talks with Father and Mother Grieg. It is a serious talk, as one can see. Finally, when the talk is finished, Ole Bull takes the wondering boy by the hand and says to him:  \"You are going to Leipzig to study and become a fine musician.\"  So Edvard Grieg left his home city, Bergen, its mountains, its fjords, its people, his father and mother, and traveled south through Norway, across the water and into Germany. No doubt he was a lonesome boy. Life had become serious all at once and there was much to be done.                     [Illustration: No. 7 BERGEN FJORD]  It was all strange and new. Instead of hills and the waters of the fjords, there were tall, dark houses, gloomy streets, and such a lot of hurrying people.                       [Illustration: No. 8 SCENE IN LEIPZIG]  But he soon grew used to it all and was busy as could be with lessons in piano and harmony. Just as in the earlier days in school, so in Leipzig, Edvard wrote music as it sounded in his heart. In the harmony lessons he could not make himself write plain chords to the bass which was given him as an exercise. He wrote the light, airy, lovely, fanciful tunes and rhythms that were singing within him. And just like the schoolmaster at home, the harmony teacher shouted at him, saying:  \"No, that is all wrong!\"  His harmony teacher was E. F. Richter.                       [Illustration: No. 9 E. F. RICHTER]  But you remember that Ole Bull understood the boy's music. While here in Leipzig there were many who understood it too.  Bit by bit Edvard made friends who loved to listen to his pieces. One of them was Niels Gade, a fine musician in Denmark, who was a friend of Schumann's, who one time, wrote a Northern Song on the letters on Gade's name. It begins like this:                 [Illustration: No. 10 GADE'S MUSICAL NAME]  And Edvard too once wrote a fugue on the letters G-A-D-E.  So inspiring was his music study that Edvard worked very hard. He composed a great deal of music which slowly made friends for him. Robert Schumann was one who spoke kindly of the young Norwegian and his music. And so he grew and improved. Because he was true to his talent, he made many friends not"]]]
