They had suffered greatly from sickness, and had seen much sorrow and affliction.  Heber's generous heart and that of his noble wife were touched with sympathy and compassion for their situation. Says he: \"To them my heart was united, because a principle had existed in my breast from earliest childhood, to plead the cause of suffering innocence, to go on the side of the oppressed at all times; neither do I remember to have ever varied from this fixed principle at any time in my life; I have many times turned aside from the company of those who were highly esteemed in the world, and sought the society of the poor and humble, those who loved the ways of the Lord better than the praise of the world.\"  He found in these families, which were related, congenial associates, for they too were seekers after truth, and truth they were all destined, ere many days, to find.  Sometime in the fall or winter of 1831, about three weeks after Heber and his wife had joined the Baptist church, five Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came from Pennsylvania to Victor, five miles from Mendon, and tarried at the house of Phineas H. Young. They were Eleazer Miller, Elial Strong, Alpheus Gifford, Enos Curtis and Daniel Bowen. Hearing of these men, Heber was prompted by curiosity to visit them, \"when,\" says he, \"for the first time I heard the fullness of the everlasting gospel.\"  The glorious news of a restored gospel and a living priesthood, commissioned of and communicating with the heavens; the promise of the Holy Ghost with signs following the believer, as in days of old; the wondrous declaration of angels revisiting the earth, breaking the silence of ages, bringing messages from another world;--all this fell upon the heart of this God-fearing man, and on the hearts of his friends and companions, like dew upon thirsty ground. As the voice of a familiar spirit, it seemed an echo from the far past--something they had known before.  To hear, with Heber, was to believe. He was convinced that they taught the truth, and was constrained to receive their testimony. He saw, more clearly than ever, that he had embraced but a portion of the truth in the Baptist faith; that the creeds of Christendom, the religions of the world, were but remnants of the everlasting gospel, broken off fragments of that grand Rock of Ages, the same in all generations; mixtures of truth and error; lesser lights at best in the broad firmament of human faith; and that now, when the Sun had once more arisen, the stars that lit the night must pale away.  Both Heber and Brigham received the word gladly, and were impelled to testify of its divinity. Then the power of God fell upon them.  \"On one occasion,\" says Heber, \"Father John Young, Brigham Young, Joseph Young and myself had come together to get up some wood for Phineas H. Young. While we were thus engaged we were pondering upon those things which had been told us by the Elders, and upon the saints gathering to Zion, when the glory of God shone upon us, and we saw the gathering of the saints to Zion, and the glory that would rest upon them; and many more things connected with that great event, such as the sufferings and persecutions that would come upon the people of God, and the calamities and judgments that would come upon the world.  \"These things caused such great joy to spring up in our bosoms that we were hardly able to contain ourselves, and we did shout aloud 'Hosannah to God and the Lamb.'\"  This heavenly vision, vouchsafed as the reward of faith and pure desires, only made them eager to know more of the \"marvelous work and wonder\" which the God of Israel had set His hand to perform, in fulfillment of the words of His ancient prophets. The Holy Ghost had fallen upon them, as on Cornelius of old, before baptism. They had plucked from the Tree of Life, from branches overhanging the wall, luscious fruit, whose sweetness and flavor made them long to enter the garden and more fully satisfy the desire of their souls.  Heber, accordingly, proposed a journey to Pennsylvania, the state from whence the Elders came, where several branches of the Church were established. It was winter; January, 1832. Putting his horses to the sleigh, he and his companions set off upon the journey, a distance of one hundred and twenty-five miles. The party consisted of Heber C. Kimball, Brigham Young, Phineas Young and the wives of the two latter. The branch they visited was in Columbia, Bradford County; that from which the Elders came, in Rutland, Tioga County.  They tarried about six days, attending the meetings of the Church, witnessing the manifestations of the gifts of the spirit, such as speaking in tongues, interpretations and prophecy, and learning more of the nature and mission of the great latter-day work. They returned home rejoicing, praising God, and bearing testimony by the way.     CHAPTER IV.  HEBER EMBRACES MORMONISM--A BAPTISM OF FIRE--DEATH OF MIRIAM YOUNG--VILATE KIMBALL A MOTHER TO THE ORPHANS--HEBER ORDAINED AN ELDER--RESOLVES TO VISIT KIRTLAND.   Heber, be it remembered, was a potter, and, though fairly well-to-do in the world, continued to labor at his trade for a livelihood.  One day in April, of the spring following his visit to Pennsylvania, as he was working in his shop, in the act of forming a vessel on the wheel, Alpheus Gifford entered. This Elder was then on his second mission to those parts, in company with others of his brethren. The conversation turning on the subject of the gospel, Heber said: \"Brother Alpheus, I am ready to go forward and be baptized.\"  What followed is thus graphically told. Says Heber: \"I arose, pulled off my apron, washed my hands and started with him, with my sleeves rolled up to my shoulders, and went a distance of one mile, where he baptized me in a small stream in the woods. After I was baptized I kneeled down and he laid his hands upon my head and confirmed me a member of the Church of Jesus Christ, and said unto me, 'In the name of Jesus Christ, and by the authority of the holy Priesthood, receive ye the Holy Ghost;' and before I got up off my knees he wanted to ordain me an Elder; but I plead with him not to do it, for I felt myself unworthy of such a calling, and such an office.\"  This event, so important to Heber C. Kimball and his posterity, took place on Monday, the fifteenth of April, 1832. Brigham Young had been baptized the day before, by Elder Eleazer Miller. Two weeks later, Heber's wife, Vilate, was baptized by Joseph Young.  A branch was raised up in Mendon numbering over thirty souls; its members were as follows:  John Young, sen., and Mary his wife, Brigham Young and Miriam his wife, Phineas H. Young and Clarissa his wife, Joseph Young, Lorenzo D. Young and Persis his wife, John P. Greene and Rhoda his wife and their children, Joel Sanford and Louisa his wife, William Stillson and Susan his wife, Fanny Young, Isaac Flummerfelt, wife and children, Ira Bond and his wife Charlotte, Heber C. Kimball and Vilate his wife, Rufus Parks, John Morton and Betsey his wife, Nathan Tomlinson and his wife, Israel Barlow with his mother, brothers and sisters.  The reception of the Holy Ghost was to Heber a veritable \"baptism of fire.\" He thus describes his remarkable experience:  \"Under the ordinances of baptism and the laying on of hands, I received the Holy Ghost, as the disciples did in ancient days, which was like a consuming fire. I felt as though I sat at the feet of Jesus, and was clothed in my right mind, although the people called me crazy.  \"I continued in this way for many months, and it seemed as though my body would consume away; at the same time the scriptures were unfolded to my mind in such a wonderful manner that it appeared to me, at times, as if I had formerly been familiar with them.\"  Thus did the Comforter, the spirit of truth, bringing things past to remembrance and showing things to come, move upon the heart of this \"mighty man of valor,\" whom the Lord was raising up for a marvelous future work. One of the weak things of earth, through whom the Omnipotent would yet thresh the nations by the power of His Spirit.  The branch in Mendon began to nourish, and the gifts of the spirit were poured out upon its members. This branch is reputed to have been the second in the Church to receive the gift of tongues; one of the branches in Pennsylvania being the first in which that gift was manifested.  Such a pentecostal renewal could scarcely take place without a corresponding movement of opposition on the part of the powers of darkness. The inevitable was at hand. Satan commenced to rage, and the Saints were annoyed and persecuted. Heber's former friends turned against him. His creditors combined to push him to the wall. During one week five or six executions were taken out against him. His brother Solomon was the only one outside the Church, willing to lend him a helping hand in his financial troubles, resulting from the inimical actions of his neighbors and old-time associates. His brother Charles, who had formerly befriended him, was dead. But the Lord opened his way, much to the chagrin of his persecutors, and he obtained money to meet his liabilities, so that none of his property was sold at auction.  In September following the organization of the branch in Mendon, Brigham Young's wife, Miriam, died. She had been feeble for months, but in her expiring moments, filled with a supernatural vitality, she clapped her hands and praised God, calling upon all around to join her in so doing. She continued in this happy state until she breathed her last, moving her lips in prayer when her voice could no longer be heard. Heber remarks that the death-bed scene of this zealous and devoted Saint was to him another testimony of the truth and power of the everlasting gospel. Vilate Kimball took charge of Miriam's two little daughters, and, thenceforth, until after they removed from Mendon, the families of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35333"],["title","Life of Heber C. Kimball, an Apostle (#6)"],["body","and Heber were as one.  In the meantime, the latter had been ordained an Elder, under the hands of Joseph Young, and labored with him and Brigham in the ministry. They visited Genesee, Avon and Lyonstown, baptizing many and building up branches of the Church. The following incident, related by Heber, shows how powerfully the Holy Ghost wrought through him in his ministrations:  \"Brother Ezra Landon preached in Avon and Genesee, baptized eighteen or twenty, and being afraid to confirm them and promise the Holy Ghost, he requested me to confirm them, which I did according to the best of my knowledge, pronouncing but a few words on the head of each one, and invariably saying, 'receive ye the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus Christ.' Immediately the Holy Ghost fell upon them, and several commenced speaking in tongues before they arose from their knees, and we had a joyful time. Some ten or twelve spoke in tongues, neither of whom had ever heard any person speak in tongues before, they being the first baptized in that place.\"  The region in which he was laboring is thus interestingly described:  \"From the time Father Bosley located near Avon, he found and plowed up axes and irons, and had sufficient to make his mill irons, and had always abundance of iron on hand without purchasing.  \"In the towns of Bloomfield, Victor, Manchester, and in the regions round about, there were hills upon the tops of which were entrenchments and fortifications, and in them were human bones, axes, tomahawks, points of arrows, beads and pipes, which were frequently found; and it was a common occurrence in the country to plow up axes, which I have done many times myself.  \"I have visited the fortifications on the tops of those hills frequently, and the one near Bloomfield I have crossed hundreds of times, which is on the bluff of Honeyoye River, at the outlet of Honeyoye Lake.  \"In that region there are many small deep lakes, and in some of them the bottom has never been found. Fish abound in them.  \"The hill Cumorah is a high hill for that country, and had the appearance of a fortification or entrenchment around it. In the State of New York, probably there are hundreds of these fortifications which are now visible, and I have seen them in many other parts of the United States.\"  Readers of the Book of Mormon will remember that in this very region, according to that sacred record, the final battles were fought between the Nephites and Lamanites. At the hill Cumorah, the Nephites made their last stand prior to their utter extermination, A. D., 385.  Thus was Heber preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles, above the graves of the ancients of Israel, whose records with the fullness of that Gospel, and the relics of their prowess and civilization, were now \"whispering from the dust.\"  But another scene was about to shift in his life's drama. He had planned to visit Kirtland, the bosom of the Church, and home of Joseph the Prophet.     CHAPTER V.  THE LAND OF SHINEHAH--ARRIVAL OF HEBER AND BRIGHAM IN KIRTLAND--THEIR FIRST MEETING WITH THE PROPHET--THE KIMBALLS AND YOUNGS REMOVE TO OHIO--VEXATIOUS SUITS AND MOB VIOLENCE--FALLEN ON PERILOUS TIMES.   Kirtland, at the time arrived at in our narrative, was the head-quarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The home of the Prophet of God and many of the leading Elders of Israel, it was also the spot designated by revelation where the first temple was to be built in this dispensation.  The Church, organized at Fayette, Seneca County, New York, on the 6th of April, 1830, had entered on the third year of its existence, and the Saints throughout the eastern parts had been commanded to gather westward. Kirtland and its vicinity, or \"the land of Shinehah,\" as it is named in revelation, had been settled as a stake of Zion since early in 1831, and from there, in the summer of the same year, had gone forth a colony of Saints to purchase and occupy \"the land of Zion,\" in the western confines of Missouri. That region was then the nation's frontier, bordering on a wilderness inhabited by wild beasts and savages, and but sparsely peopled itself by whites scarcely less ignorant and cruel.  The Gospel, preached by the first missionaries sent westward from New York, in October, 1830, had taken a firm hold among the honest-in-heart of Northern Ohio. Among those who had embraced the new faith--new, indeed, and wonderful to that generation--were Sidney Rigdon, Edward Partridge and Newel K. Whitney. The Pratts, the Whitmers, and other noted families were already numbered among the followers of the \"Mormon\" Prophet, and it was Parley P. Pratt, Oliver Cowdery and other Elders who had first brought the Gospel to Kirtland.  The new branch throve so rapidly as to soon eclipse in importance all others; an event no doubt divinely ordered, as the Saints at large, in December, 1830, were commanded to \"assemble together at the Ohio.\"  Late in October, or early in November, 1832, Heber C. Kimball, in company with Brigham and Joseph Young, arrived in Kirtland. They had traveled by team a distance of three hundred miles. Their first meeting with the Prophet, whom they had come so far to see, was on the 8th day of November. Joseph was felling trees in the forest when the party approached. It is related that, on seeing Brigham, he said: \"There is a man who will yet preside over this Church.\"  As to Heber, the heart of Joseph was at once knit with his, in friendship like unto that of David and Jonathan; and this feeling of brotherly love, like a golden chain, uniting these two noble souls, was destined to endure unbroken through time and eternity.  Says Heber: \"We saw brother Joseph Smith and had a glorious time; during which Brother Brigham spoke in tongues before Joseph, this being the first time he had heard anyone speak in tongues. He rose up and testified that the gift was from God, and then the gift fell upon him and he spoke in tongues himself. He afterwards declared it was the pure, or Adamic language that he spoke. Soon after this the gift of tongues commenced in the Church at Kirtland generally. We had a precious season and returned with a blessing in our souls.\"  In the fall of 1833, Elder Kimball disposed of his possessions in Mendon, and settled his affairs preparatory to gathering to the bosom of the Church. He had borne faithful testimony to the inhabitants of the place which had been his home for so many years, but, with few exceptions, they had turned a deaf ear to his warning words. Heber was the only one of his father's household to embrace the Gospel. His brother Solomon, though friendly, and at one time, like Agrippa, \"almost persuaded,\" did not come within the fold.  No sooner was Heber ready to start Zionward, than he was again beset by petty persecutions. This time they were not only malicious, but of an out and out dishonest character. Notwithstanding he had settled all his accounts, and paid every penny that he owed--\"unless it was two cents to one man, in a case where change could not be procured\"--and left debts owing to him, uncollected, to the amount of \"some hundred dollars,\" attachments were issued at the instance of some of his neighbors, and his goods seized by officers of the law.  Rather than be delayed by a law-suit, in which, owing to religious prejudice, he had little hope of receiving fair treatment, he settled the unjust claims and departed.  His family at this time consisted of himself and wife, and their two children, William Henry and Helen Mar. Judith Marvin, an elder daughter, and Roswell Heber, a younger son--the first and latest born of the household--had died. Brigham Young and his two little daughters went in the same wagon with the Kimball family to Kirtland. They reached their destination about the last of October, or early in November. They first occupied a house belonging to Elijah Smith, uncle to the wife of Bishop N. K. Whitney; but Heber soon had a home of his own, which he continued to share with his friend and brother Brigham, until the latter procured a separate domicile.  It is an interesting fact that Brigham was the builder of Heber's house in Kirtland, he being a carpenter and joiner, as well as a painter and glazier.  \"When I got to Kirtland,\" says Elder Kimball, \"the brethren were engaged in building the House of the Lord. The commandment to build the House and also the pattern of it, were given in a revelation to Joseph Smith, jun., Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, and it was to be erected by a stated time. The Church was in a state of poverty and distress, in consequence of which it appeared almost impossible that the commandment could be fulfilled. Soon after our arrival, there was a contribution called for to finish the school-house and printing office; I contributed the glass for the house, and I gave Brother Hyrum Smith two hundred dollars for the building of the temple.\"  The newly arrived pilgrims had fallen on perilous times. Mobocracy was rife and rampant; persecution was raging against the Church, both in Ohio and in Missouri. The infernal regions seemed stirred to their depths at the prospect of a temple, whose walls, now climbing heavenward, gave promise of salvation and deliverance for the living and the dead; the unlocking of prison doors, the bursting of spirit dungeons, the smiting off of fetters from the limbs of the slave of sin, and the ushering forth of the penitent captive into the life and light of gospel liberty. Keys were about to be restored whereby the heavens would be brought nearer to the earth, the prophets of the past would minister in holy places to the prophets of the present, and the cause of human redemption receive such an impetus as would shake the throne of Satan to its foundations. No wonder the dominions of Sheol were agitated.  \"Our enemies,\" says Heber, \"were raging and threatening destruction upon us. We had to guard night after night, and for weeks were not permitted to take off our clothes, and"]]]
