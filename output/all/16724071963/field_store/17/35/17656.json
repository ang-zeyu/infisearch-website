Among the stars, there are some which are called double stars, and which consist of two stars so near to each other that the telescope alone can separate them to the eye. In 1803, after twenty years of observation, William Herschel discovered that some of these couples were revolving around each other with various angular velocities. The son of William Herschel continued this work, and many years later, he discovered that the laws of motion of these double stars are the same as those that prevail in the the solar system.[A] This result indicated not only the universality of the law of gravitation, but also the probability that all heavenly bodies are in motion.  [Footnote A: History of the Inductive Sciences, Whewell, 3rd ed. Vol. I, pp. 467-469.]  [Sidenote: The invention of the spectroscope laid the foundation of the new astronomy.]  Then, early in the nineteenth century, a new method of research began to be developed, which was destined to form a new science of astronomy. It had long been known that white light when passed through a glass prism is broken into a colored spectrum, with colors similar to those observed in the rainbow. Now it was discovered that when white light passes through vapors of certain composition, dark lines appear in the spectrum, and that the position of the lines varies with the chemical composition of the vapors. By the application of these principles, it was shown, towards the middle of the last century, that the chemical composition of the heavenly bodies may be determined. Later,it was discovered that by noting the positions of the dark lines in the spectrum, it could be known when a star or any heavenly body is moving, as also the direction and amount of its motion. These unexpected discoveries led to a study of the heavens from the spectroscopic point of view, which has resulted in a marvelous advance in the science of astronomy.  [Sidenote: All heavenly bodies are in motion.]  It has been determined that all heavenly bodies are in motion, and that their velocities are great compared with our ordinary conceptions of motion. Most of the stars move at the rate of about seven miles per second, though some have a velocity of forty-five miles, or more, per second. Many stars, formerly thought to be single, have been resolved into two or more components. The rings of Saturn have been proved to consist of small bodies revolving about the planet in obedience to Kepler's law.[A] Clusters of stars have been found that move through space as one body, as possible counterparts of the planetary system.[B] It has been demonstrated, further, that the sun itself, with its planets, is moving through space at a very rapid rate. Professor Simon Newcomb, perhaps the greatest astronomer of the day, says, \"The sun, and the whole solar system with it, have been speeding their way toward the star of which I speak (Alpha Lyrae) on a journey of which we know neither the beginning nor the end. During every clock-beat through which humanity has existed, it has moved on this journey by an amount which we cannot specify more exactly than to say that it is probably between five and nine miles per second. The conclusion seems unavoidable that a number of stars are moving with a speed such that the attraction of all the bodies of the universe could never stop them.\"[C] In brief, the new astronomy holds that all heavenly bodies are in motion, and that the planetary system is but a small cluster of stars among the host of heaven. Further, it has weighed the stars, measured the intensity of their light, and determined their chemical composition, and it affirms that there are suns in the heavens, far excelling our sun in size and lustre, though built of approximately the same elements.  [Footnote A: See C. G. Abbott, Report of Smithsonian Institution, for 1901, pp. 153-155.]  [Footnote B: Light Science for Leisure Hours, Proctor, pp. 42-52.]  [Footnote C: The Problems of Astronomy, S. Newcomb, Science, May 21, 1897.]  [Sidenote: The solar system is only one of many.]  Sir Robert Ball expresses his views as follows: \"The group to which our sun belongs is a limited one. This must be so, even though the group included all the stars in the milky way. This unnumbered host is still only a cluster, occupying, comparatively speaking, an expressibly small extent in the ocean of infinite space. The imagination will carry us further still--it will show us that our star cluster may be but a unit in a cluster of an order still higher, so that a yet higher possibility of movement is suggested for our astonishment.\"[A]  [Footnote A: The Story of the Sun, R. S. Ball, pp. 360, 361.]  Another eminent astronomer expresses the same idea briefly but eloquently: \"It is true that from the highest point of view the sun is only one of a multitude--a single star among millions--thousands of which, most likely, exceed him in brightness, magnitude and power. He is only a private in the host of heaven.\"[A]  [Footnote A: The Sun, C. A. Young, p. 11.]  And still another student of the stars propounds the following questions: \"Does there exist a central sun of the universe? Do the worlds of Infinitude gravitate as a hierarchy round a divine focus? Some day the astronomers of the planets which gravitate in the light of Hercules (towards which constellation the solar system is moving) will see a little star appear in their sky. This will be our sun, carrying us along in its rays; perhaps at this very moment we are visible dust of a sidereal hurricane, in a milky way, the transformer of our destinies. We are mere playthings in the immensity of Infinitude.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Popular Astronomy, C. Flammarion, p. 309.]  [Sidenote: Scientists believe that heavenly bodies are inhabited by living, thinking beings.]  It is not strange that men who have learned to look at the universe in this lofty manner should go a step farther, beyond the actually known, and suggest that some of these countless heavenly bodies must be inhabited by living, thinking beings. Sober, thoughtful truthseekers, who never advance needlessly a new theory, have suggested, in all seriousness, that other worlds than ours are peopled. For instance, \"What sort of life, spiritual and intellectual, exists in distant worlds? We can not for a moment suppose that our little planet is the only one throughout the whole universe on which may be found the fruits of civilization, warm firesides, friendship, the desire to penetrate the mysteries of creation.\"[A]  [Footnote A: The Problems of Astronomy, S. Newcomb.]  Such, then, is in very general terms the view of modern astronomy with reference to the constitution of the universe. Most of the information upon which this view rests has been gathered during the last fifty years.  [Sidenote: Joseph Smith taught that all heavenly bodies are in motion.]  Joseph Smith was doubtlessly impressed with the beauty of the starry heavens, and, in common with all men of poetical nature, allowed his thoughts to wander into the immensity of space. However, he had no known opportunity of studying the principles of astronomy, or of becoming familiar with the astronomical questions that were agitating the thinkers of his day. Naturally, very little is said in his writings that bears upon the planetary and stellar constitution of the universe; yet enough to prove that he was in perfect harmony with the astronomical views developed since his day.  First, he believed that stellar bodies are distributed throughout space. \"And worlds without number have I created.\"[A] \"And there are many kingdoms; for there is no space in which there is no kingdom.\"[B] He is further in harmony with modern views in that he claims that stars may be destroyed, and new ones formed. \"For, behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power.\"[C] \"And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof, even so shall another come.\"[D]  [Footnote A: Book of Moses, 1:33.]  [Footnote B: Doctrine and Covenants, 88:37.]  [Footnote C: Book of Moses, 1:35.]  [Footnote D: Doctrine and Covenants, 1:38.]  At the time that Joseph Smith wrote, there was considerable discussion as to whether the laws of the solar system were effective with the stars. The Prophet had no doubts on that score, for he wrote, \"And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Doctrine and Covenants, 88:38.]  Likewise, his opinions concerning the motions of celestial objects were very definite and clear. \"He hath given a law unto all things by which they move in their times and seasons; and their courses are fixed; even the courses of the heavens and the earth, which comprehend the earth and all the planets. The earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her light by night, and the stars also giveth their light, as they roll upon their wings in glory, in the midst of the power of God.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Doctrine and Covenants, 88:43, 45.]  In another place the same thought is expressed. \"The sun, moon or stars; all the times of their revolutions; all the appointed days, months, and years, and all the days of their days, months, and years, and all their glories, laws, and set times, shall be revealed.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Doctrine and Covenants, 121:30, 31.]  The two revelations from which these quotations are made, were given to the Prophet in 1832 and 1839 respectively, many years before the fact that all celestial bodies are in motion was understood and accepted by the world of science.  [Sidenote: Joseph Smith taught that the solar system is only one of many--in advance of the astronomers of his day.]  The accepted conception that groups or clusters of stars form systems which revolve around some one point or powerful star, was also clearly understood by Joseph Smith, for he speaks of stars of different orders with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34362"],["title","Joseph Smith as Scientist: A Contribution to Mormon Philosophy (#7)"],["body","stars for each order. \"And I saw the stars that they were very great, and that one of them was nearest unto the throne of God; and there were many great ones which were near unto it: and the Lord said unto me: These are the governing ones; and the name of the great one is Kolob because it is near unto me--I have set this one to govern all those which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest.\"[A] That the governing star, Kolob, is not the sun is evident, since the statement is made later in the chapter that the Lord showed Abraham \"Shinehah, which is the sun.\" Kolob, therefore, must be a mighty star governing more than the solar system; and is possibly the central sun around which the sun with its attendant planets is revolving. The other great stars near Kolob are also governing stars, two of which are mentioned by name Oliblish and Enish-go-ondosh, though nothing is said of the order or stars that they control. The reading of the third chapter of the _Book of Abraham_ leaves complete conviction that Joseph Smith taught that the celestial bodies are in great groups, controlled (under gravitational influence) by large suns. In this doctrine, he anticipated the world of science by many years.  [Footnote A: Book of Abraham, chapter 3.]  [Sidenote: Joseph Smith taught that other worlds are inhabited.]  It is perhaps less surprising to find that Joseph Smith believed that there are other peopled worlds than ours. For instance, \"The reckoning of God's time, angel's time, prophet's time, and man's time, is according to the planet on which they reside,\"[A] which distinctly implies that other planets are inhabited. Another passage reads, \"The angels do not reside on a planet like this earth, but they reside in the presence of God, on a globe like a sea of glass and fire.\"[B]  [Footnote A: Doctrine and Covenants, 130:4.]  [Footnote B: Loc. cit., verses 6 and 7. See also 88:61.]  While the idea that the planets and stars may be inhabited is not at all new, yet it is interesting to note that Joseph Smith taught as an absolute truth that such is the case. Probably no other philosopher has gone quite that far.  These brief quotations go to show that the doctrines of the Prophet of the Latter-day Saints are in full accord with the views that distinguish the new astronomy. It is also to be noted that in advancing the theories of universal motion among the stars, and of great stars or suns governing groups of stars, he anticipated by many years the corresponding theories of professional astronomers.  In various sermons the Prophet dealt more fully with the doctrines here set forth and showed more strongly than is done in his doctrinal writings, that he understood perfectly the far reaching nature of his astronomical teachings.  Did Joseph Smith teach these truths by chance? or, did he receive inspiration from a higher power?     Chapter VII.  GEOLOGICAL TIME.   [Sidenote: The history of the world written in the rocks.]  God speaks in various ways to men. The stars, the clouds, the mountains, the grass and the soil, are all, to him who reads aright, forms of divine revelation. Many of the noblest attributes of God may be learned by a study of the laws according to which Omnipotent Will directs the universe.  Nowhere is this principle more beautifuly illustrated and confirmed than in the rocks that constitute the crust of the earth. On them is written in simple plainness the history of the earth almost from that beginning, when the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. Yet, for centuries, men saw the rocks, their forms and their adaptations to each other, without understanding the message written in them. Only, as the wonderful nineteenth century approached, did the vision open, and the interpretation of the story of the rocks become apparent.  [Sidenote: Water and heat among the shaping forces of the earth.]  How the earth first came into being has not yet been clearly revealed. From the first, however, the mighty forces which act today, have shaped and fashioned the earth and prepared it for man's habitation. Water, entering the tiny cracks of the rocks, and expanding as, in winter, it changed to ice, crumbled the mighty mountans; water, falling as rain from the clouds, washed the rock fragments into the low-lying places to form soil; the water in mighty rivers chiseled the earth with irresistible force, as shown by the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. The internal heat of the earth, aided by the translocation of material by water, produced large cracks in the earth's crust, through which oceans of molten matter flowed and spread themselves over the land; the same heat appeared in volcanoes, through which were spurted liquid earth, cinders and foul gases; as the earth heat was lost, the crust cooled, contracted and great folds appeared, recognized as mountains, and as time went on, many of the mountains were caused to sink and the ocean beds were brought up in their stead. Wonderful and mighty have been the changes on the earth's surface since the Lord began its preparation for the race of men.  [Sidenote: The geological history of the earth is in many chapters.]  In the beginning, it appears that water covered the whole earth. In that day, the living creatures of earth dwelt in the water, and it was the great age of fishes and other aquatic animals. Soon the first land lifted itself timidly above the surface of the ocean, and formed inviting places for land animals and plants. Upon the land came, first, according to the story of the rocks, a class of animals known as amphibians, like frogs, that could live both in water and on land. Associated with these creatures were vast forests of low orders of plants, that cleared the atmosphere of noxious gases, and made it fit for higher forms of life. Then followed an age in which the predominating animals were gigantic reptiles, a step higher than the amphibians, but a step lower than the class of Mammals to which man belongs. During the age of these prehistoric monsters, the earth was yet more fully prepared for higher life. Following the age of reptiles, came the age of mammals, which still persists, though, since the coming of man upon the earth, the geological age has been known as the age of man.  This rapid sketch of the geological history of the earth does very poor justice to one of the most complete, wonderful and beautiful stories brought to the knowledge of man. The purpose of this chapter is not, however, to discuss the past ages of the earth.  It is, of course, readily understood that such mighty changes as those just described, and the succession of different kinds of organic life, could not have taken place in a few years. Vast periods of time must of necessity have been required for the initiation, rise, domination and final extinction of each class of animals. A year is too small a unit of measurement in geological time; a thousand years or, better, a million years, would more nearly answer the requirements.  [Sidenote: The earth is probably millions of years old.]  It is possible in various ways to arrive at a conception of the age of the earth since organic life came upon it. For instance, the gorge of the Niagara Falls was begun in comparatively recent days, yet, judging by the rate at which the falls are now receding, it must have been at least 31,000 years since the making of the gorge was first begun, and it may have been nearly 400,000 years.[A] Lord Kelvin, on almost purely physical grounds, has estimated that the earth cannot be more than 100,000,000 years old, but that it may be near that age.[B] It need not be said, probably, that all such calculations are very uncertain, when the actual number of years are considered; but, all human knowledge, based upon the present appearance of the earth and the laws that control known phenomena, agree in indicating that the age of the earth is very great, running in all probability into millions of years. It must have been hundreds of thousands of years since the first life was placed upon earth.  [Footnote A: Dana's New Text Book of Geology, p. 375.]  [Footnote B: Lectures and Addresses, vol. 2, p. 10.]  [Sidenote: The war concerning the earth's age has helped theology and science.]  When these immense periods of time were first suggested by students of science, a great shout of opposition arose from the camp of the theologians. The Bible story of creation had been taken literally, that in six days did the Lord create the heavens and the earth; and it was held to be blasphemy to believe anything else. The new revelation, given by God in the message of the rocks, was received as a man-made theory, that must be crushed to earth. It must be confessed likewise that many of the men of science, exulting in the new light, ridiculed the story told by Moses, and claimed that it was an evidence that the writings of Moses were not inspired, but merely man-made fables.  The war between the Mosaic and the geological record of creation became very bitter and lasted long, and it led to a merciless dissection and scrutiny of the first chapter of Genesis, as well as of the evidence upon which rests the geological theory of the age of the earth. When at last the din of the battle grew faint, and the smoke cleared away, it was quickly perceived by the unbiased on-lookers, that the Bible and science had both gained by the conflict. Geology had firmly established its claim, that the earth was not made in six days of twenty-four hours each; and the first chapter of Genesis had been shown to be a marvelously truthful record of the great events of creation.  [Sidenote: The word day in Genesis refers to indefinite time periods.]  Moses, in the first chapter of Genesis, enumerates the order of the events of creation. First, light was brought to the earth and was divided from darkness, \"and the evening and the morning were the first day.\" Then the firmament was established in the midst of the waters, \"and the "]]]
