Tordoff   Kansas was one of the first states for which a detailed book on birds was published (N. S. Goss, \"History of the Birds of Kansas,\" Topeka, Kansas, 1891). Ornithological progress in Kansas in recent years, however, has not kept pace with work in many other states. As a result, knowledge of the birds of Kansas today is not sufficiently detailed to make possible a modern, definitive report. One purpose of this check-list is to show gaps in our information on birds of the state. Each student of birds can contribute importantly by keeping accurate records of nesting, distribution, and migration of any species in Kansas and by making these records available through publication in appropriate journals. The Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas solicits records and specimens which contribute to our knowledge of birds in Kansas. Files and collections at the Museum are available to any qualified person for study.  The last state-wide list of birds was prepared by W. S. Long (Trans. Kansas Acad. Sci., 43, 1940:433-456). This list and the unpublished thesis from which the list was abstracted have been of great value in preparing the present report. Many other persons have contributed and among these the names of the following must be mentioned because of the value of their contributions: Ivan L. Boyd, L. B. Carson, Arthur L. Goodrich, Jr., Richard Graber, Jean Graber, Harold C. Hedges, R. F. Miller, John M. Porter, and Marvin D. Schwilling.  Full standing in this check-list has been given only to species for which at least one specimen from Kansas has been examined by some qualified student. Exceptions to this admittedly arbitrary rule have been made in three cases, Trumpeter Swan, Turkey, and Carolina Paroquet, because there is no reason to doubt that each of these three species once occurred in Kansas and because opportunity for obtaining specimens from Kansas has been lost through disappearance of the species from the state. Other species reported from the state but not authenticated by specimens have been relegated to the Hypothetical List and their names and my remarks concerning these birds are enclosed in brackets. This procedure is intended to encourage collection of such species; it is not intended necessarily to indicate doubt of a record. In the case of a carefully identified but uncollected accidental, opportunity for obtaining a specimen may not exist again for a long period. This is unfortunate but emphasizes the need for judicious collecting.  A total of 375 species (or 459 species and subspecies), of which four are introduced, is included in this check-list. Additionally, 15 species are discussed in the Hypothetical List. An asterisk (*) preceding an account indicates positive evidence of breeding in Kansas of the species so marked. The total of species known to have bred at least once in the state is 173. Nomenclature in this list follows the American Ornithologists' Union \"Check-List of North American Birds\" (1931, 4th edition) and its supplements. Species on the Hypothetical List are included in their current taxonomic position in the main list.   _Gavia immer_ (Brünnich). Common Loon. Uncommon transient throughout state.      No subspecies recognized.   _Gavia stellata_ (Pontoppidan). Red-throated Loon. Rare transient. One specimen: female (Univ. Michigan Mus.

Two definite nesting records: nest with 4 newly hatched"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34429"],["title","Check-list of the Birds of Kansas (#1)"],["body","(male collected, KU 30468), 1/2 mile east and 2 miles south of Welda, Anderson County, June 9, 1951, Maurice F. Baker; nest with eggs, 6 miles north and 3-1/2 miles west of Kalvesta, Finney County, summer, 1952, Raymond Erkic (_fide_ Marvin D. Schwilling).      No subspecies recognized.   * _Ixobrychus exilis._ Least Bittern. Transient and irregular summer resident. Two nests found at Lake Quivira, Johnson County, June 3, 1949, Harold C. Hedges; on June 28, one of the nests contained 4 eggs, on July 10 this nest was empty. No other definite nesting records.      Subspecies in Kansas: _I. e. exilis_ (Gmelin).    _Mycteria americana_ Linnaeus. Wood Ibis. Accidental. Several sight records and one specimen: male (KU 9489), 5 miles north-*east of Goodland, Sherman County, October 4, 1913, Willis Feaster.      No subspecies recognized.   * _Plegadis mexicana_ (Gmelin). White-faced Glossy Ibis. Irregular transient and summer visitant; more common in west. One definite nesting record: photograph of downy young (\"Kansas Fish and Game,\" vol. 9, no. 3, Jan. 1952, p. 7) taken at Cheyenne Bottoms, Barton County, presumably in summer of 1951, by L. O. Nossaman. Frank Robl has seen individuals in summer in Cheyenne Bottoms on many occasions. Reports of Eastern Glossy Ibis (_Plegadis falcinellus_) in Kansas probably are based on dark-faced immatures of the present species, although the eastern species has been taken in Oklahoma.      No subspecies recognized.   _Ajaia ajaja_ (Linnaeus). Roseate Spoonbill. Accidental. One authentic specimen (present location not known): male, near Douglass, on Four-Mile Creek, Butler County, March 20, 1899, taken by Dr. R. Matthews, identification verified by Jerold Volk and Wilfred Goodman.      No subspecies recognized.   _Phoenicopterus ruber_ Linnaeus. Flamingo. Accidental. Two birds seen in autumn, 1928, at Little Salt Marsh, Stafford County, one of which was killed on opening day of duck season and now (1955) is mounted at Kansas Forestry, Fish, and Game Commission headquarters at Pratt.      No subspecies recognized.   _Olor columbianus_ (Ord). Whistling Swan. Transient and winter resident, formerly common, now rare. Many specimens are on record; at least four were taken in winter.      No subspecies recognized.   _Olor buccinator_ (Richardson). Trumpeter Swan. Formerly occasional migrant, no longer occurs in Kansas. All specimens from Kansas alleged to be of this species are actually Whistling Swans. The early sight records seem valid, however, and the species should remain on the state list.      No subspecies recognized.   * _Branta canadensis._ Canada Goose. Common transient; some winter in suitable places. This species was found nesting along the Missouri River near Atchison by early explorers. Modern breeding records probably pertain to captives or their descendants.      Subspecies in Kansas: _B. c. moffitti_ Aldrich, _B. c.     leucopareia_ (Brandt), _B. c. minima_ Ridgway, and _B. c.     hutchinsi_ (Richardson) have been collected in Kansas.     Additionally, subspecies _interior_ Todd and _parvipes_ (Cassin)     probably pass through the state but no specimens have been saved.     Canada Geese of widely varying size are regularly seen in     migration.   _Branta bernicla._ Brant. Accidental. Several sight records and one specimen: unsexed bird (KU 7490), Leavenworth County, November 15, 1879, A. Lange. Some hunters refer to immature Blue Geese as \"brant.\" Orville O. Rice saw 4 brant 2 miles north of Burlington, near the Neosho River, Coffey County, March 24, 1955, that appeared to be Black Brant, _Branta nigricans_ (Lawrence).      Subspecies in Kansas: _B. b. hrota_ (Müller).   _Anser albifrons._ White-fronted Goose. Regular transient throughout state, more common in central and western parts.      Subspecies in Kansas: _A. a. frontalis_ Baird.   _Chen hyperborea._ Snow Goose. Common transient throughout state.      Subspecies in Kansas: _C. h. hyperborea_ (Pallas).   _Chen caerulescens_ (Linnaeus). Blue Goose. Common transient in east, less common in central and western parts of state. In east, this species predominates in early spring migration whereas the Snow Goose is most numerous later. Hybrids between the two are regularly seen.      No subspecies recognized.   [_Chen rossii_ (Cassin). Ross Goose. One reported at Wyandotte County Lake, November 22, 1951, by John Bishop. Placed in Hypothetical List in absence of a specimen.]   _Dendrocygna bicolor._ Fulvous Tree-duck. Accidental. Frank Robl carefully examined and identified three specimens killed in 1929 or 1930, in Cheyenne Bottoms, Barton County. None saved. Specimens collected also in nearby areas of Missouri.      Subspecies in Kansas: _D. b. helva_ Wetmore and Peters, on     geographical grounds.   * _Anas platyrhynchos._ Mallard. Abundant transient, regular winter resident, irregular and local summer resident. Modern breeding distribution poorly known but several nests found in widely scattered areas in past years. Nests regularly in Kearny, Finney, and Barton counties.      Subspecies in Kansas: _A. p. platyrhynchos_ Linnaeus.   _Anas rubripes_ Brewster. Black Duck. Regular but rare or uncommon transient and winter resident in east and central (Cheyenne Bottoms, Barton County) sections.      No subspecies recognized.   _Anas fulvigula._ Mottled Duck. Accidental. Four specimens allegedly of this species have been reported. Of these, two are actually Mallards, one is a Gadwall, and one, female, Neosho Falls, Woodson County, March 11, 1876, Goss, is a Mottled Duck.      Subspecies in Kansas: _A. f. maculosa_ Sennett.   _Anas strepera_ Linnaeus. Gadwall. Transient and occasional winter resident throughout state. Rare summer resident but no satisfactory nesting record reported.      No subspecies recognized.   * _Anas acuta_ Linnaeus. Pintail. Abundant transient throughout state, irregular winter resident, local summer resident nesting in recent years in Barton, Finney, Meade, and Leavenworth counties, but summer distribution poorly known.      No subspecies recognized.   _Anas carolinensis_ Gmelin. Green-winged Teal. Common transient, rare winter resident (records from Meade County and Kansas City).      No subspecies recognized.   * _Anas discors_ Linnaeus. Blue-winged Teal. Common transient, locally common summer resident.      No subspecies recognized.   _Anas cyanoptera._ Cinnamon Teal. Rare transient in east, uncommon or fairly common transient in west.      Subspecies in Kansas: _A. c. septentrionalis_ Snyder and Lumsden.   * _Spatula clypeata_ (Linnaeus). Shoveller. Common transient throughout state. Frank Robl found a female with young in Cheyenne Bottoms, Barton County, in approximately 1930. Nest with eggs found 1-1/2 miles south of Friend, Finney County, in spring, 1952, Marvin D. Schwilling.      No subspecies recognized.   [_Mareca penelope_ (Linnaeus). European Widgeon. Carl and David Holmes reported a pair at Lake Shawnee, Shawnee County, April 16, 1954. Placed on Hypothetical List until a specimen is taken.]   _Mareca americana_ (Gmelin). Baldpate. Common transient throughout state, rare winter resident.      No subspecies recognized.   * _Aix sponsa_ (Linnaeus). Wood Duck. Transient, rare in west to locally common in extreme east. Summer resident in eastern part of state; breeding distribution poorly known.      No subspecies recognized.   * _Aythya americana_ (Eyton). Redhead. Fairly common transient and occasional winter resident throughout state. Frank Robl found a nesting pair in Cheyenne Bottoms, Barton County, in 1928 (approximate). The adults were neither captives nor cripples.      No subspecies recognized.   _Aythya collaris_ (Donovan). Ring-necked Duck. Fairly common transient throughout state, rare winter resident.      No subspecies recognized.   _Aythya valisineria_ (Wilson). Canvas-back. Fairly common transient and occasional winter resident throughout state.      No subspecies recognized.   _Aythya marila._ Greater Scaup Duck. Rare transient, status poorly known. Several sight records, one in winter. Floyd T. Amsden, a competent sportsman and amateur ornithologist of Wichita, identified 3 male specimens killed 3 miles north and 1 mile east of Sharon, Barber County, on October 27 (2) and November 3 (1), 1951. Frank Robl has seen specimens killed in Cheyenne Bottoms, Barton County. Every effort should be made to preserve specimens from Kansas.      Subspecies in Kansas: _A. m. nearctica_ Stejneger, on geographical     grounds.   _Aythya affinis_ (Eyton). Lesser Scaup Duck. Common transient throughout state. A few records of wintering and summering (non-*breeding) individuals.      No subspecies recognized.   _Bucephala clangula._ Golden-eye. Uncommon transient and winter resident.
