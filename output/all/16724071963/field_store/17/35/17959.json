Besides, you need to pull yourself together.\"  \"That's true,\" he agreed, and glanced at his trembling hands.  \"Take my advice,\" I went on earnestly, \"and Mr. Royce's advice. Leave Elizabeth for a little while. There isn't much chance of my finding Miss Lawrence for a day or two. You must get your calmness and self-possession back, for you'll need them.\"  \"Yes,\" he said hoarsely; \"yes, I'll need them. Very well, I'll do as you say, Mr. Lester. Only it's deuced selfish of me to throw my troubles on your shoulders this way.\"  \"Selfish nothing!\" cried our junior. \"Where will you go?\"  \"I don't know,\" answered Curtiss helplessly.  \"Go to one of the beaches near New York. The sea-air and surf will do you good. Let us know where you are; then, if we want you, we won't have any trouble finding you, and you can get back here in an hour or two.\"  \"There's one thing Mr. Curtiss can do,\" I said. \"A photograph of Miss Lawrence might prove a great help.\"  \"Why, of course,\" he assented, and thrust his hand into an inner pocket. But, after an instant's hesitation, he drew it out empty. \"I can't give you that one,\" he said; \"I must keep that one. I'll send you another. You're at the Sheridan?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I'll leave it there for you. But please don't use it unless you absolutely have to.\"  \"I won't use it at all, if I can avoid it,\" I assured him. \"I promise you that it won't go out of my hands.\"  \"Thank you,\" he said. \"I knew you'd understand. As soon as you have any news you'll wire me?\"  \"The very moment. I want you to rely on us.\"  \"I will.\"  \"And not worry.\"  \"I'll try not to,\" and he was gone.  As the door closed behind him, Mr. Royce looked at me with a somewhat guilty countenance.  \"You see, I've got you into it again, Lester,\" he began. \"I hope you don't mind.\"  \"I don't. Rather the contrary.\"  \"It's a little out of our line,\" he added. \"But for a friend--and I certainly pity the poor fellow--we lawyers have to do peculiar things sometimes.\"  \"I've done more peculiar ones than this,\" I said. \"This is, at bottom, merely a matter of finding an important witness who is missing.\"  \"Thank you, Lester,\" he said, and held out his hand. \"I didn't want to seem to be imposing on you.\"  \"You're not,\" I assured him again, and rose. \"Now I think I'd better be getting to work.\"  \"Can I be of any help?\" he asked, rising too. \"If not, I'll take the four-ten back to New York. I think Curtiss needs a little looking after. I'll hunt him up and take him with me. Besides, my wife is so wrought-up over this affair that she wants to get home.\"  \"Very well,\" I assented. \"Curtiss will need some one to protect him from the reporters. It's a wonder they haven't treed him before this.\"  \"They tried to,\" said Mr. Royce, smiling grimly. \"I succeeded in keeping them off. He was too preoccupied to notice. There's nothing else I can do?\"  \"No, I think not. If I need you, I'll wire.\"  \"You won't need me,\" and he smiled again. \"You know I'm no good at this kind of work.\"  \"I know you'll be working harder than I will, keeping up with things at the office.\"  \"Don't worry about that. You intend to stay here?\"  \"Yes; but only for a day or two, I trust. I can't think it a very difficult task to find a young woman who has run away in broad daylight in her wedding finery. Somebody must have seen her--that is, if she ran away at all.\"  \"No doubt,\" he agreed. \"Of course you'll find her--it's not about that I'm worrying so much; it's about her motive for doing such a thing. It seems preposterous to suppose that any woman in her right mind would run away half an hour before her wedding. Curtiss saw her at ten o'clock and found her happy, yet an hour later she had taken this desperate step. I wonder, Lester, if you realise just how desperate it was?\"  \"Yes,\" I said; \"I think I do.\"  \"Well, I'm free to confess I didn't until I saw its effect on my wife. Why, Lester, it was suicidal--it means social ostracism--no less. Even if it doesn't altogether ruin her life, it will always shadow it. It's something she can never outlive.\"  \"Yes,\" I said again; \"it's all that.\"  \"And yet she was a thoughtful, self-controlled, well-balanced woman, who would foresee all this--who would realise the consequences more clearly than we can do. Lester--what was it drove her to it?\"  \"Ah, if I only knew! But I'm going to find out!\"  \"I hope you will--and yet I fear it, too. I'm afraid to think of it--I'm afraid to try to guess the secret--I'm afraid I'll unearth some grisly, loathsome skeleton, which should never have seen the light! But I'm sure of one thing,\" he added, his face hardening. \"I think you suspected, too.\"  \"What was that?\"  \"Whatever the secret is, Mrs. Lawrence knows it.\"  \"Yes,\" I agreed, \"I believe she does.\"  \"And had a hand in her daughter's disappearance.\"  \"Yes,\" I said again, \"I think that very likely.\"  He stood for a moment longer, looking at me as though half-inclined to say something more; then he shook hands abruptly and left the room.  As I turned to sit down again, I noticed, in the chair from which I had arisen, something white crushed into one corner of the seat. I picked it up. It was a handkerchief of dainty lace and it was damp--with tears?     CHAPTER VI  An Astonishing Request   I sat down again and examined my find more closely. I am no connoisseur of lace, yet even I could appreciate the handkerchief's exquisite beauty. But how came it here, crushed into a corner of this chair? Whose was it? Some instinct--or was it merely a delusive hope?--told me that it belonged to Marcia Lawrence--that it was she who had left it here--that the tears which dampened it were her tears, tears of bitter, bitter sorrow for dead hopes and a future which had changed from gold to grey. She had stolen into the library for a moment's peace, that she might face her sorrow and decide what she must do. She had left it----  But I shook myself together impatiently. All this was merely theorising; I must lay my foundation first, get my facts; then perhaps it might be possible to build a theory which would prove the right one. Thus far in the investigation, I felt that I had been met with evasion rather than with frankness; I suspected that an attempt was being made to puzzle and bewilder me; I could see that my presence in the house was unwelcome to Mrs. Lawrence. Well, my stay would be a short one; I dropped the handkerchief into my pocket, opened the door, and stepped out into the hall.  The front door was open and two men were tugging an immense palm through it. Another was engaged in taking down the wreaths of smilax. By the tenderness with which he handled them I recognised the decorator. He stopped and looked at me inquiringly as I went toward him.  \"I've come down from New York,\" I explained, \"at the request of Mr. Curtiss to assist him in finding Miss Lawrence. You, I believe, are the last person who is known to have seen her. I'd like to ask you a few questions.\"  \"Go ahead,\" he said, beaming with self-importance. \"I'll be glad to tell you anything I know, sir.\"  \"Do you remember what time it was when you called Miss Lawrence down to have a last look at the decorations?\"  \"It must have been nearly half-past eleven, sir. I remember hearing a clock strike eleven and thinking it'd take me about half an hour to get through.\"  \"Did you notice anything peculiar in her behaviour?\"  \"Peculiar? No, sir. She was very kind and said some nice things about my work.\"  \"She did not seem sad nor depressed?\"  \"Oh, no, sir; quite the contrary.\"  \"When she left you, did she return upstairs?\"  \"I think so, sir. At least, she started for the stairs. I stepped into the dining-room for a moment to make sure everything was all right, and when I came out again she was gone.\"  \"Was there any one else in the hall?\"  \"No, sir; I think not; not just at that moment, though of course people were passing back and forth through it all the time.\"  \"Did you notice a man loitering about--a stranger--middle-aged, dark-complexioned, with a dark beard or moustache--rather striking in appearance--perhaps a little dissolute?\"  \"No, sir,\" he answered, with a stare of surprise. \"I didn't see any stranger about the whole morning--nobody I didn't know.\"  I confess I was rather disappointed; I had hoped that my shot would tell.  \"And you heard no unusual noise--no scream, nor anything of that sort.\"  \"No, sir; though I was so busy and worried I dare say I wouldn't have heard a cannon-shot.\"  \"When did you learn that something was wrong?\"  \"I heard Mrs. Lawrence asking if any one had seen her daughter. Then she sent some of the servants to look for her.\"  \"What time was that?\"  \"About ten minutes after I had spoken to her.\"  \"Yes--what then?\"  \"Well, I didn't pay much attention, at first; but when the bridesmaids came, they raised such a hullabaloo that I couldn't help but take notice.\"  \"What did Mrs. Lawrence do?\"  \"Why, she tried to quiet them--I must say she was the coolest one in the house--except one.\"  \"Who was that?\"  \"Miss Lawrence's maid. She just sat there on the stairs and glowered and grinned and chewed her nails and never said a word. She gave me the creeps. I could swear she knew all about it and was glad of it.\"  I repressed a chuckle of satisfaction. Here was better luck than I had expected.  \"How was Miss Lawrence dressed when you saw her?\" I asked.  \"All in rustly white. I judged it was her wedding-dress.\"  \"And you say she seemed quite as usual?\"  \"Yes, sir; only, of course, excited, as any woman would be--though calm, too, and with a sort of deep glow in her eyes when she looked at you. I can't describe it, sir; but I remember thinking that the man who was to get her was a mighty lucky fellow. Did you know her, sir?\"  \"No,\" I said; \"I've never seen her.\"  \"Ah,\" he added, closing his eyes for an instant, \"if you'd seen her then, you'd never forget it. I never will. I never saw another woman to touch her!\" and he turned away to his work, with the vision he had conjured up"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35247"],["title","That Affair at Elizabeth (#6)"],["body"," still before him.  As I started along the hall, I saw through the open front door a mail-carrier coming up the walk. I hastened to meet him--this was another fortunate chance.  \"How many deliveries do you make a day out here?\" I asked, as he came up the steps with a bundle of letters in his hand--I could guess the belated congratulations which were among them!  \"Only two--morning and afternoon,\" he answered.  \"What time in the morning?\"  \"About nine o'clock, usually.\"  \"It was about that time this morning?\"  \"Yes, sir; maybe ten minutes after nine.\"  \"Who took the mail?\"  \"I put it in the box here in the vestibule, as I always do,\" he said, and suited the action to the word.  I watched him as he walked away. So it had not been a letter which had caused Miss Lawrence's sudden panic. That reduced the possibilities to two. Either she had received a visitor or a telegram. I must endeavour to----  A voice at my elbow aroused me.  \"Mrs. Lawrence wishes to see you, sir,\" it said.  I turned, to find standing beside me the woman who had brought the note to Mrs. Lawrence in the library--the woman whose attitude of malignant triumph had so startled me. I blessed the chance which made it possible for me to question her alone.  \"Very well,\" I said. \"Are you Mrs. Lawrence's maid?\"  \"No, sir; I'm Miss Marcia's maid.\"  \"Ah!\" I said, and permitted myself to look at her more closely. She was a woman apparently somewhat over thirty. She had very black hair and eyes, and her face, while not actually repellent, had in it a certain fierceness and hardness far from attractive. A fiery and emotional nature was evident in every line of it--a sinister nature, too, it seemed to me--and I remembered her as I had seen her standing in the library door, exulting in another's misery. I pictured her as the decorator had described her, sitting on the stair, grinning and biting her nails in a kind of infernal triumph. Why should Miss Lawrence have chosen such a woman to attend her? As I looked at her, I saw the folly of attempting to win her confidence--the whip was the only weapon that could touch her--and it must be wielded mercilessly.  \"Mrs. Lawrence wishes to see you,\" she said again, and I fancied there was defiance in the eyes she turned upon me for the merest instant.  \"In a moment. Was it you who found the note your mistress left for Mr. Curtiss?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" and she glanced at me again, this time with a quick suspicion.  \"It was on her dressing-table, I believe?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"How did you happen to find it?\"  \"I just happened to see it, sir.\"  \"It was lying in plain sight?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Not concealed in any way--nothing lying over it?\"  She hesitated an instant, and shot me another quick glance before she answered.  \"I believe not, sir,\" she said at last.  \"Of course it wouldn't be concealed,\" I said reassuringly. \"Miss Lawrence probably left it where she thought it would be most quickly seen, don't you think so?\"  \"Yes, sir; I suppose so.\"  \"And her dressing-table was a very conspicuous place?\"  \"Yes, sir; very conspicuous.\"  \"In that case,\" I said slowly, \"it seems most peculiar that the letter wasn't discovered at once.\"  She flushed hotly under my gaze and opened her lips to reply, but thought better of it and started hastily up the stair. I followed her in silence; but I had much to think about. What connection had she with Miss Lawrence's disappearance? What connection could she have? Miss Lawrence would scarcely make a confidante of her maid, more especially of such a maid as this! At the stairhead I held her back for a final question.  \"When did you see your mistress last?\"  \"When she left her room to go downstairs to look at the decorations,\" she answered, so docilely that I was inclined to believe her former defiance wholly my imagination.  \"You remained behind in the room?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And she did not return?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Then how do you explain the presence of the letter on the dresser?\"  She flushed again, more hotly than before; she realised that I had caught her in a lie.  \"I--I can't explain it, sir,\" she stammered. \"I didn't consider it any of my business,\" she added fiercely.  \"I think you'll find it difficult to explain,\" I said, with irony; \"even more difficult than how it came to lie there unperceived for nearly three hours. You'll pardon me if I find the story hard to believe.\"  \"It's nothing to me whether or not you believe it!\" she retorted and made a motion to go on again.  \"No,\" I said; \"wait a moment. Which is her room?\"  \"This one here,\" and she pointed to a half-open door just beside us.  Ignoring her gesture of protest, I pushed the door back and stepped inside.  The room was a large and pleasant one, well lighted and looking out upon the grove at the east side of the house. There was some little disorder apparent, and over a chair at the farther side of the room I saw a veil lying--no doubt the bridal veil. For the moment I did not seek to see more, but turned back into the hall.  \"Nothing there,\" I said, as though my inspection of the room was ended. \"I suppose you helped Miss Lawrence to dress?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And she had on her wedding-gown when she went downstairs?\"  \"Yes, sir, all but the veil.\"  \"What was the colour of the gown?\"  \"White, sir,\" she answered, with evident contempt. \"White satin made very plain.\"  \"With a train?\"  \"Yes, sir, with a train.\"  \"Thank you,\" I said. Plainly, a woman garbed in that fashion must be a marked object, wherever she went. Then, seeing that the maid waited for further questions, I added, \"That is all, I believe.\"  She opened a door just across the hall and motioned me to precede her. I found myself in a pleasant sitting-room, and looked about for Mrs. Lawrence, but she was not there. The maid went to an inner door which stood half-open, and knocked.  \"In a moment,\" called a low voice, and I heard a rustle of draperies. Instinctively I knew that Mrs. Lawrence had been upon her knees.  But I was not prepared for the deep distress which I saw in her countenance the instant she appeared upon the threshold. So worn and drawn was it, so changed even in the brief time since I had seen her last, that I scarcely knew her. What had happened? Was her self-control giving way under the strain, or had there been some new shock, some more poignant blow which she had been unable to withstand?  She came straight to me where I stood staring, perhaps a little brutally, and lifted tear-dimmed eyes to mine.  \"Mr. Lester,\" she said, in a choked voice, \"I must ask that this search for Marcia cease.\"     CHAPTER VII  Tangled Threads   I stared at her a moment without replying--so she _was_ guilty! So she _did_ know! I heard the opening of the door as the maid left the room, and the sound somehow restored me a portion of my self-control.  \"Cease? But why?\" I asked. \"Surely----\"  \"Marcia has said that the marriage is impossible,\" she interrupted. \"Is not that enough?\"  \"Mr. Curtiss does not think so. And if it is impossible, he, at least, has a right to know why.\"  \"Marcia has decided not; she has no wish to bring reproach to the memory of a respected man, who----\"  She checked herself--but she had already said too much.  \"Then you know why your daughter left so suddenly?\" I questioned. \"But an hour ago, you said you didn't know.\"  \"I did not then,\" she murmured.  \"I have no wish to know,\" I went on rapidly, noting her sudden pallor. \"I have no right to know. But I'm here to find Miss Lawrence so that Mr. Curtiss can, at least, have a last talk with her. That seems a reasonable demand. Do you know where she is?\"  \"No!\" she answered explosively.  \"She is not in this house?\"  \"Assuredly not; I have already told you she is not here.\"  \"I fancied perhaps she had returned.\"  \"Such a suspicion is absurd.\"  \"You've had no word from her?\"  \"Not a single word.\"  \"Then it wasn't she who told you the cause of her disappearance?\"  \"She told me nothing.\"  I had no need to ask who it was; some instinct told me it was the maid.  \"And you saw her last----\"  \"When she left me to dress, as I've already told you. I've been speaking the truth, Mr. Lester.\"  \"Pardon me,\" I said; \"I hadn't the least doubt of it; but I'm sure you can appreciate my position, can look at it from Mr. Curtiss's side. Perhaps you suspect where Miss Lawrence is, without being absolutely certain. If you would tell me----\"  She stopped me with a sudden gesture; I saw that I had touched the truth.  \"Or, at least,\" I persisted, pressing my advantage, \"if you know why your daughter fled, you might yourself tell Mr. Curtiss----\"  Again she stopped me.  \"The secret is not mine,\" she said hoarsely.  \"Whose is it? Who has the right to tell?\"  \"No one!\"  \"And you will let it wreck two lives?\"  I saw the spasm of pain which crossed her face. She must yield; a moment more, and I should know the secret!  \"To-morrow--give me till to-morrow!\" she cried. \"Perhaps you're right--I must think--I cannot decide now--instantly. There are so many things to consider--the dead as well as the living.\"  \"Very well,\" I agreed. \"I will call to-morrow morning----\"  \"At eleven--not before.\"  \"To-morrow at eleven, then. And I hope you'll decide, Mrs. Lawrence, to help me all you can. The living come before the dead.\"  She bowed without replying, and seeing how deadly white she was, I checked the words which rose to my lips and let myself out into the hall.  The maid was standing just outside the door. I wondered how much she had heard of what had passed within.  \"One moment,\" I said, as she started for the stairway, and I stepped again into Miss Lawrence's room.  It had grown too dark there to see anything distinctly, for this room was not flooded, as her mother's had been, by the last rays of the sun, but in a moment I switched on the light. The maid stared from the threshold, her face dark with anger, but not daring to interfere.  \"This is the dressing-table, isn't it?\" I asked, walking toward it.  \"Yes, sir,\" she answered sullenly.  \"It was here you"]]]
