The oxidising point of a pointed flame may be used for both kinds of glass. The flame will be coloured yellow by soda glass at the moment of melting. This indication of the condition of soda glass should be noted, for it serves as a criterion of the condition of the glass. The ends of soda glass tubes may also be rounded in the flame of a common Bunsen's burner.  When the end of a tube is to be closed with a cork or stopper, its mouth should be expanded a little, or =bordered=. To do this, heat the end of the tube by rotating it in the flame till it softens, then remove it from the flame, at once introduce the charcoal cone (Fig. 5, p. 11), and rotate it with gentle pressure against the softened glass till the desired effect is produced. In doing this it is very important that the end of the tube shall be uniformly heated, in order that the enlargement shall be of regular form. If the tube cannot be sufficiently expanded at one operation, it should be re-heated and the process repeated.  Borders, such as are seen on test-tubes, are made by pressing the softened edge of the tube against a small iron rod. The end of the rod should project over the softened edge of the tube at a slight angle, and be pressed against it, passing the rod round the tube, or rotating the tube under the rod.  =Sealing=, that is closing the ends of tubes, or other openings, in glass apparatus.  In performing this and all the other operations of glass blowing, the following points must be constantly kept in mind:--  (_a._) That it is rarely safe to blow glass whilst it is still in the flame, except in certain special cases that will be mentioned subsequently. Therefore always remove apparatus from the flame before blowing.  (_b._) That when heating glass tubes, unless it is specially desired to heat one portion only, the tube must be constantly rotated in the flame to ensure that it shall be uniformly heated, and to prevent the tube or mass of glass from assuming an irregular form.  (_c._) Always blow gently at first, and slowly increase the force applied till you feel or see the glass giving way. It is a good plan to force the air forward in successive short blasts rather than in one continued stream.  (_d._) When it is necessary to force air into tubes of fine bore, such as thermometer tubes, the mouth must not be used, for moisture is thereby introduced into the tube, which it is very difficult to remove again in many cases. All tubes of very small bore should be blown with the aid of an india-rubber blowing-bottle, such as are used for spray-producers, Galton's whistles, etc. The tube to be blown must be securely fixed to the neck of the bottle, which is then held in one hand, and air is forced from it into the tube as it is required. These bottles are frequently of service to the glass-blower--_e.g._, when tubes of very fine bore have to be united, it is necessary to maintain an internal pressure slightly exceeding that of the air throughout the operation, in order to prevent the viscous glass from running together and closing the tube. An india-rubber blowing-ball is very convenient for this purpose.  To seal the end of a glass tube (Fig. 8), adjust the flame so that it will heat a zone of glass about as broad as the diameter of the tube to be sealed (see _A_, Fig. 8). Hold the tube on each side of the point where it is to be sealed in the manner described in the description of bending glass tubes (p. 28). Bring the tube gradually into the flame, and heat it with constant rotation, till the glass softens (for lead glass the oxidising flame must be used, as has been already explained).[6] When the glass begins to thicken, gently pull asunder the two ends, taking care not to pull out the softened glass too much, but to allow the sides to fall together, as shown at _A_. When this has occurred, heat the glass at the narrow part till it melts, and pull asunder the two ends. The closed end should present the appearance shown at _D_. If the glass be drawn out too quickly its thickness will be unduly reduced, and it will present the appearance shown at _B_. In that case apply a pointed flame at _b_, and repeat the previous operation so as to contract the tube as at _c_, taking care not to allow the glass to become much increased nor decreased in thickness.  [6] Remember that when the lead glass is heated to the proper temperature it will present an appearance which may be described as a greenish phosphorescence. At higher temperatures it assumes an orange-red appearance. If it loses its transparency and assumes a dull appearance, it must be moved further into the oxidising parts of the flame.  If a considerable mass of glass be left at _d_, it may be removed by heating it to redness, touching it with the pointed end of a cold glass tube, to which it will adhere, and by which it may be pulled away.  [Illustration: FIG. 8.]  When the end of the tube presents the appearance shown in the diagram _D_, and the mass of glass at _d_ is small, the small lump that remains must be removed by heating it till it softens, and _gently_ blowing with the mouth, so as to round the end and distribute the glass more regularly, as shown in _E_. The whole end, from the dotted line _e_, must then be heated with constant rotation in the flame. If this final heating of the end _e_ be done skilfully, the glass will probably collapse and flatten, as at _F_. The end must then be gently blown into the form shown at _G_.  If a flat end to the tube be desired, the tube may be left in the condition shown by _F_, or a thin rounded end may be flattened by pressure on a plate of iron.  If a concave end be wished for, it is only necessary to gently suck air from the tube before the flattened end has become solid.  In each case, _immediately_ after the tube is completed, it must be closely wrapped in cotton wool and left to cool. With good lead glass this last process, though advantageous, is not absolutely necessary; and as glass cools slowly when enveloped in cotton wool, this precaution may frequently be neglected in the case of apparatus made from lead glass.  [Illustration: FIG. 9.]  In order to draw out tubes for sealing, close to one end, and thus to avoid waste of material, it is a good plan to heat simultaneously the end of the glass tube _A_ which is to be sealed, and one end of a piece of waste tube _E_ of about the same diameter, and when they are fused to bring them together as at _DD_ (Fig. 9). _E_ will then serve as a handle in the subsequent operations on _A_. Such a rough joint as that at _D_ must not be allowed to cool too much during the work in hand, or _E_ and _A_ may separate at an inconvenient moment. Or the glass at the end of the tube may be pressed together to close the tube, and the mass of glass may be seized with a pair of tongs and drawn away.   =Choking, or Contracting the Bore of a Glass Tube.=--If it be not desired to maintain the uniformity of external dimensions of the tube whilst decreasing the diameter of the bore, the tube may be heated and drawn out as described in the description of sealing tubes on pp. 32-35. This may be done as shown at _A_ or _B_ in Fig. 8, according to the use to which the contracted tube is to be put.  [Illustration: FIG. 10.]  Greater strength and elegance will be secured by preserving the external diameter of the tube unchanged throughout, as shown in Fig. 10. For this purpose heat the tube with the pointed flame, if it be small, or in the brush flame if it be of large size, constantly rotating it till the glass softens and the sides show an inclination to fall together, when this occurs, push the two ends gently towards _A_. If the tube should become too much thickened at _A_, the fault may be corrected by removing it from the flame and gently pulling the two ends apart till it is of the proper size. If the bore at the contracted part of the tube should become too much reduced, it may be enlarged by closing one end of the tube with a small cork, and blowing gently into the open end after sufficiently heating the contracted part. The tube should be rotated during blowing or the enlargement produced may be irregular.  When the external diameter of the tube is to be increased as well as its bore diminished, press together the ends of a tube heated at the part to be contracted, as already described, and regulate the size of the bore by blowing into the tube if at any time it threatens to become too much contracted.   =Widening Tubes.=--Tubes may be moderately expanded at their extremities by means of the charcoal cone (see Bordering, p. 31). They may be slightly expanded at any other part by closing one end and gently blowing into the open end of the tube, after softening the glass at the part to be widened before the blow-pipe. But the best method of obtaining a wide tube with narrow extremities (Fig. 11) is to join pieces of narrow tube _AA_ to the ends of a piece of wider tube _B_ of the desired dimensions. The method of performing this operation is described under welding, on pp. 39-47.  [Illustration: FIG. 11.]  [Illustration: FIG. 12.]   =Piercing Tubes.=--The glass-blower very frequently requires to make a large or small opening in some part of a tube or other piece of apparatus. This is known as piercing. Suppose it is desired to make a small hole at the point _a_ in _A_ (Fig. 12). When the tube has been brought to the flame with the usual precautions, allow the end of the pointed flame to touch it at _a_ till an area corresponding to the desired size of the opening is thoroughly softened. Then expand the softened glass by blowing to the form shown at _B_. Re-heat _a_, blow a small globe as at _C_, and carefully break the thin glass, then smooth the rough edges by rotating them in the flame till they form a mouth like that of _D_. Instead of leaving the bulb to be broken at the third stage _C_, it is a good plan to blow"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33941"],["title","The Methods of Glass Blowing and of Working Silica in the Oxy-Gas Flame (#7)"],["body","strongly, so that the bulb becomes very thin and bursts, the removal of the thin glass is then accompanied by less risk of producing a crack in the thicker parts of the glass. Openings may be made in a similar manner in the sides of tubes or in globes, in fact, in almost any position on glass apparatus. If another tube is to be attached at the opening, it is a good plan to proceed to this operation before the tube has cooled down.  [Illustration: FIG. 13.]  The openings obtained by the method above described are too large when platinum wires are to be sealed into them. Suppose that it is necessary to pierce the tube _A_ of Fig. 13 in order to insert a platinum wire at _a_; direct the smallest pointed flame that will heat a spot of glass to redness on the point _a_. When the glass is viscous, touch it with the end of a platinum wire _w_, to which the glass will adhere; withdraw the wire and the viscous glass will be drawn out into a small tube, as shown at _B_; by breaking the end of this tube a small opening will be made. Introduce a platinum wire into the opening, and again allow the flame to play on the glass at that point; it will melt and close round the wire. Before the hot glass has time to cool, blow gently into the mouth of the tube to produce a slightly curved surface, then heat the neighbouring parts of the tube till the glass is about to soften, and let it cool in cotton wool. Unless this is done, I find that glass tubes into which platinum wires have been sealed are very apt to break during or after cooling.  To ensure that the tube shall be perfectly air-tight, a small piece of white enamel should be attached to the glass at _a_ before sealing in the wire.   =Uniting Pieces of Glass to Each Other, known as Welding, or Soldering.=--The larger and more complicated pieces of glass apparatus are usually made in separate sections, and completed by joining together the several parts. This is therefore a very important operation, and should be thoroughly mastered before proceeding to further work.  In order to produce secure joints, the use of tubes made of different kinds of glass must be avoided. Soda glass may be joined securely to soda glass, especially if the tubes belong to the same batch, and lead glass to lead glass. But, though by special care a joint between lead glass and soda glass, if well made, will often hold together, yet it is never certain that it will do so.  _To join two Tubes of Equal Diameters._--Close one end of one of the tubes with a small cork. Heat the open end of the closed tube, and either end of the other tube in a small flame until they are almost melted, taking care that only the ends of the tubes are heated, and not to let the glass be thickened; bring the two ends together with sufficient pressure to make them adhere, but not sufficient to compress the glass to a thickened ring. Before the joint has time to cool too much, adjust your blow-pipe for a pointed flame, if you are not already working with that kind of flame, and allow the point of the flame to play on any spot on the joint till it is heated to redness; rotate the tube a little so as to heat the glass adjacent to that which is already red-hot, and repeat this till the whole circumference of the rough joint has been heated.[7] Repeat the operation last described, but, when each spot is red-hot, blow gently into the open end of the tube so as to slightly expand the viscous glass. Finally, rotate the whole joint in the flame till the glass is softened, and blow gently as before into the open end of the tube, still rotating it, in order that the joint may be as symmetrical as possible. If in the last operation the diameter of the joint becomes greater than that of the rest of the tube, it may be cautiously re-heated and reduced by pulling it out, or this may be secured by gently pulling apart the two ends, whilst the operator blows it into its final shape.  [7] Some glass-blowers at once work on the glass as next described, without this preliminary treatment. I find that some glass, usually soda glass, will not always bear the necessary movements without breaking unless first heated all round.  [Illustration: FIG. 14.]  When small tubes, or tubes of fine bore, are to be joined, in order to prevent the fused glass from running together and closing the tube, it is a good plan to border and enlarge the ends that are to be united, as at _A_ (Fig. 14). Some glass-blowers prefer to border all tubes before uniting them.  When a narrow tube is to be joined to one that is only slightly wider, expand the end of the narrow tube till it corresponds in size to the larger tube. If the tube be too narrow to be enlarged by inserting a charcoal cone, seal one end and pierce it as directed (on p. 37).  For joining small thin-walled tubes Mr. Crookes recommends the use of a small Bunsen flame.  In welding pieces of lead glass tube, take care that the heated glass is perfectly free from reduced lead at the moment when the two ends of viscous glass are brought into contact.  [Illustration: FIG. 15.]  _To join Tubes of Unequal Sizes End to End_ (Fig. 15).--Draw out the larger tube and cut off the drawn-out end at the part where its diameter is equal to that of the smaller tube, then seal the smaller tube to the contracted end of the larger according to the directions given for joining tubes of equal size. When a good joint has been made, the tube presents the appearance of _A_, Fig. 15, the union being at about _bb_. Next heat the whole tube between the dotted lines _aa_, and blow it into the shape of _B_ in which the dotted line _dd_ should correspond to the actual line of junction of the two tubes.  In making all joints it is important to leave no thick masses of glass about them. If the glass be fairly thin and uniformly distributed, it is less likely to break during or after annealing under any circumstances, and especially if it has to bear alternations of temperature.  _Joining a Tube to the Side of another Tube_ (Fig. 16).--One of the tubes must be pierced as at _A_ in Fig. 16 (for the method, see p. 37), and its two ends closed with small pieces of cork. The edges of the opening, and one end of the other tube, must then be heated till they melt, and united by pressing them together. The joint may then be finished as before.  [Illustration: FIG. 16.]  A properly blown joint will not present the appearance of _B_ (Fig. 16), but rather that of _C_. This is secured by directing the pointed flame upon the glass at _aa_ (_B_) spot by spot, and blowing out each spot when it is sufficiently softened. If the tubes are large, the whole joint should subsequently be heated and blown, but in the case of small tubes this is of less importance. Finally it is to be wrapped whilst hot in cotton wool for the annealing process.  If a second tube has to be joined near to the first one, say at _b_, it is well to proceed with it before the joint first made cools down, and the joint first made, especially if soda glass be used, must be held in the flame from time to time during the process of making the second joint to keep it hot; if this be not done the first joint is very likely to break. A joint previously made may, however, be re-heated, if well made and well annealed.  A three-way tube, like that in Fig. 17, is made by bending _A_ (Fig. 16) to an angle, and joining _B_ to an opening blown on the convex side of the angle; or, _A_ of Fig. 16 may be bent as desired after attaching _B_ in the ordinary way.  [Illustration: FIG. 17.]  Tubes may also be joined to openings made in the sides of globes or flasks; great care must be taken, however, especially if the walls of the globe be thin, to secure that the tube is well attached to the mouth of the opening when the melted ends are first brought into contact, for, with thin glass, any hole that may be left will probably increase whilst the joint is being blown into shape, owing to cohesion causing the glass to gather in a thickened ring round an enlargement of the original opening.[8]  [8] If such an opening be observed, it may usually be closed by touching its edges with a fused point of glass at the end of a drawn out tube.  In order to unite a tube of soda glass to a tube of lead glass, the end of the soda glass tube must be carefully covered with a layer of soft arsenic glass.[9] This must be done so perfectly that when the ends to be united are brought together the lead and soda glass are separated by the enamel at every point.  [9] This can be obtained from Messrs. Powells, Whitefriars Glassworks.  _To Seal a Tube inside a Larger Tube or Bulb._--Suppose that an air-trap (3 of Fig. 18) is to be constructed from a small bulb (_A_) blown on a glass tube (1).  [Illustration: FIG. 18]  Either cut off the tube close to the bulb at _B_, or better, remove the end by melting the glass and pulling it away from _B_, and then pierce _A_ at _B_, No. 2, by heating the glass there and blowing out a small bulb as described under Piercing.  Prepare a tube (4) drawn out at _E_ with a bulb blown at _D_. Insert _E_ into the opening _B_, press _D_ well against the mouth _B_ and slowly rotate before the blow-pipe till _D_ adheres to _B_. Then heat and blow the joint spot by spot as in other cases, taking care that the glass is blown out on each side of the joint; lastly, heat the whole joint between _aa_, and blow it into its final shape.  These joints are very apt to break after a few minutes or hours if the glass of _D_ be much thicker than that of the bulb _A_. They should be wrapped in cotton wool for annealing as soon as possible, as the rate at which the tube _E_ cools is likely to be less rapid than that of the parts of the apparatus which are more freely exposed to the air; therefore all such internal joints require very careful annealing, and they should always be made as thin as is consistent with the use to which they are to be put.  Tubes may also be sealed into the ends or sides of larger tubes by"]]]
