There was great confusion.  \"Lie down!\" cried some of the officers.  \"Fall in!\" shouted others.  Each did, for the moment, what seemed best. Some of the soldiers fired at random, in the direction of the unseen enemy. Some crouched behind the cars; others gained the shelter of the woods, where a line was formed.  \"Why don't you fall into line?\" was the sharp command of an officer to a soldier standing beside a tree.  \"I would, sir, if I could,\" was the reply, and the soldier exhibited his arm, torn by a cannon shot.  They gathered up the wounded, carried them to the rear in blankets, began their homeward march, while the Rebels, eleven hundred strong, up to this moment sheltered behind a woodpile, rushed out, destroyed the cars, and retreated to Fairfax.  When the news reached Alexandria, a portion of the troops there were hastily sent forward; they had a weary march. Morning brought no breakfast, noon no dinner. A Secessionist had fled from his home, leaving his flocks and herds behind. The Connecticut boys appropriated one of the cows. They had no camp utensils, and were forced to broil their steaks upon the coals. It was my first dinner in the field. Salt was lacking, but hunger gave the meat an excellent seasoning. For table and furniture we had the head of a barrel, a jack-knife, and a chop-stick cut from a hazel-bush.  Congress assembled on the 4th of July, and the members availed themselves of the opportunity to visit the troops. Vallandigham of Ohio, who by word and act had manifested his sympathy for the Rebels, visited the Second Ohio, commanded by Colonel McCook, afterwards Major-General. I witnessed the reception given him by the boys of the Buckeye State. The officers treated him courteously, but not cordially. Not so the men.  \"There is that d--d traitor in camp,\" said one, with flashing eyes.  \"He is no better than a Rebel,\" said another.  \"He helped slaughter our boys at Vienna the other day,\" said a third.  \"Let us hustle him out of camp,\" remarked a fourth.  \"Don't do anything rash. Let us inform him that his presence is not desired,\" said one.  A committee was chosen to wait upon Vallandigham. They performed their duty respectfully. He heard them, and became red in the face.  \"Do you think that I am to be intimidated by a pack of blackguards from northern Ohio?\" he said. \"I shall come to this camp as often as I please,--every day if I choose,--and I give you notice that I will have you taken care of. I shall report your insolence. I will see if a pass from General Scott is not to be respected.\"  Turning to the officers, he began to inquire the names of the soldiers. The news that Vallandigham was there had spread throughout the camp, and a crowd was gathering. The soldiers were sore over the slaughter at Vienna, and began to manifest their hatred and contempt by groans and hisses.  \"If you expect to frighten me, you have mistaken your man. I am ashamed of you. I am sorry for the honor of the State that you have seen fit to insult me,\" he said.  \"Who has the most reason to be ashamed, you of us, or we of you?\" said one of the soldiers. \"We are here fighting for our country, which you are trying to destroy. What is your shame worth? You fired at us the other day. You helped kill our comrades. There isn't a loyal man in the country whose cheek does not redden with shame whenever your name is mentioned,\" was the indignant reply.  Vallandigham walked into the officers' quarters. The soldiers soon had an effigy, labelled \"Vallandigham the traitor,\" hanging by the neck from a tree. They riddled it with bullets, then took it down and rode it on a rail, the fifers playing the \"Rogues' March.\" When Vallandigham left the camp, they gave him a farewell salute of groans and hisses. A few of the soldiers threw onions and old boots at him, but his person was uninjured. He did not repeat his visit. He was so cross-grained by nature, so thorough a traitor, that through the session of Congress and through the war he lost no opportunity to manifest his hatred of the soldiers.         *       *       *       *       *  [Sidenote: July, 1861.]  It was past sunset on the 9th of July, when, accompanied by a friend, I left Alexandria for Washington in an open carriage. Nearing the Long Bridge, an officer on horseback, in a red-flannel blouse, dashed down upon us, saying: \"I am an officer of the Garibaldi Guard; my regiment has mutinied, and the men are on their way to Washington! I want you to hurry past them, give notice to the guard at the Long Bridge, and have the draw taken up.\" We promised to do so if possible, and soon came upon the mutineers, who were hastening towards the bridge. They were greatly excited. They were talking loud and boisterously in German. Their guns were loaded. There were seven nations represented in the regiment. Few of them could understand English. We knew that if we could get in advance of them, the two six-pounders looking down the Long Bridge, with grape and canister rammed home, would quell the mutiny. We passed those in the rear, had almost reached the head of the column, when out sprang a dozen in front of us and levelled their guns. Click--click--click went the locks.  \"You no goes to Vashington in ze advance!\" said one.  \"You falls in ze rear!\" said another.  \"What does this mean?\" said my friend, who was an officer. \"Where is your captain?\" he asked.  The captain came up.  \"What right have your men to stop us, sir? Who gave them authority? We have passes, sir; explain this matter.\"  The captain, a stout, thick-set German, was evidently completely taken aback by these questions, but, after a moment's hesitation, replied,--  \"No, zur, they no stops you; it was von mistake, zur. They will do zo no more.\" Then approaching close to the carriage, he lowered his voice, and in a confidential tone, as if we were his best friends, asked, \"Please, zur, vill you be zo kind as to tell me vat is the passvord?\"  \"It's not nine o'clock yet. The sentinels are not posted. You need none.\"  A tall, big-whiskered soldier had been listening. He could speak English quite well, and, evidently desiring to apologize for the rudeness of his comrades, approached and said, \"You see we Garibaldians are having a time of it, and--\"  Here the captain gave him a vigorous push, with a \"Hush!\" long drawn, which had a great deal of meaning in it.  \"I begs your pardons for ze interruption,\" said the captain, extending his hand and bowing politely.  Once more we moved on, but again the excited leaders, more furious than before, thrust their bayonets in our faces, again saying, \"You no goes to Vashington in ze advance.\" One of them took deliberate aim at my breast, his eyes glaring fiercely.  It would have been the height of madness to disregard their demonstration. They had reached the guard at the Virginia end of the bridge, who, at a loss to know what it meant, allowed them to pass unchallenged.  [Illustration: Guarding long bridge.]  Now that we were compelled to follow, there was time to think of contingencies. What if our horses had started? or what if in the darkness a soldier, grieving over his imaginary wrong, and reckless of life, had misunderstood us? or what if the loyal officers of the regiment remaining at Alexandria had given notice by telegraph of what had happened, and those two cannon at the Washington end of the bridge had poured their iron hail and leaden rain along the causeway? It was not pleasant to think of these possibilities, but we were in for whatever might happen; and, remembering that God's providence is always good and never evil, we followed our escort over the bridge. They halted on the avenue, while we rode with all speed to General Mansfield's quarters.  \"I'll have every one of the rascals shot!\" said the gray-haired veteran commanding the forces in Washington. An hour later the Garibaldians found themselves surrounded by five thousand infantry. They laid down their arms when they saw it was no use to resist, were marched back to Alexandria, and put to the hard drudgery of camp life.         *       *       *       *       *  The soldiers had an amusing story to tell of one of their number who went into the lager-beer business, the sale of beer being then allowed. A sutler put a barrel on tap, and soon had a crowd of thirsty customers. But the head of the barrel was exposed in the rear. A soldier spying it, soon had that end on tap, and was doing a thriving business, selling at five cents a glass from his end of the barrel. He had a constant run of custom. When the crowd had satisfied their thirst, one of the soldiers approached the sutler.  \"What do you charge for a glass?\" he asked.  \"Ten cents.\"  \"Ten cents! Why, I can get just as much as I want for five.\"  \"Not in this camp.\"  \"Yes, sir, in this camp.\"  \"Where, I should like to know?\"  \"Right round here.\"  The sutler crawled out from his tent to see about it, and stood transfixed with astonishment when he beheld the operation at the other end of his barrel. He was received with a hearty laugh, while the ingenious Yankee who was drawing the lager had the impudence to ask him if he wouldn't take a drink!  Virginia was pre-eminently the land of a feudal aristocracy, which prided itself on name and blood,--an aristocracy delighting to trace its lineage back to the cavaliers of Old England, and which looked down with haughty contempt upon the man who earned his bread by the sweat of his brow. The original \"gentleman\" of Virginia possessed great estates, which were not acquired by thrift and industry, but received as grants through kingly favor. But a thriftless system of agriculture, pursued unvaryingly through two centuries, had greatly reduced the patrimony of many sons and daughters of the cavaliers, who looked out of broken windows and rickety dwellings upon exhausted lands, overgrown with small oaks and diminutive pines. Yet they clung"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34843"],["title","The Boys of '61 (#6)"],["body","tenacity to their pride.  \"The Yankees are nothing but old scrubs,\" said a little Virginia girl of only ten years to me.  A young lady was brought to General Tyler's head-quarters at Falls Church to answer a charge of having given information to the enemy. Her dress was worn and faded, her shoes were down at the heel and out at the toes. There was nothing left of the estate of her fathers except a mean old house and one aged negro slave. She was reduced to absolute poverty, yet was too proud to work, and was waited upon by the superannuated negro.  \"You are accused, madam, of having given information to the enemy,\" said General Tyler.  The lady bowed haughtily.  \"You live in this old house down here?\"  \"I would have you understand, sir, that my name is Delaney. I did not expect to be insulted!\" she exclaimed, indignantly. Words cannot describe her proud bearing. It was a manifestation of her regard for blood, gentility, name, and her hatred of labor. The history of the Rebellion was in that reply.  Virginia was also the land of sirens. A captain in a Connecticut regiment, lured by the sweet voice of a young lady, went outside of the pickets to spend a pleasant hour; but suddenly the Philistines were upon him, and he was a captive. Delilah mocked him as he was led away. Walking along the picket line on the 12th of July, I found a half-dozen Connecticut boys under a fence, keeping close watch of Delilah's mansion.  \"There is a girl over there,\" said one of them, \"who enticed our captain up to the house yesterday, when he was captured. Last night she came out and sung a song, and asked a lieutenant to go in and see her piano and take tea; but he smelt a rat, and was shy. To-night there are four of us going to creep up close to the house, and he is going in to see the piano.\"  The trap was set, but the Rebels did not fall into it.  The pickets brought in a negro, one of the first contrabands who came into the lines of the army of the Potomac. He was middle-aged, tall, black, and wore a checked cotton shirt and slouched hat. His boots were as sorry specimens of old leather as ever were worn by human beings. He came up timidly to head-quarters, guarded by two soldiers. He made a low bow to the General, not only with his head, but with his whole body and legs, ending the _salaam_ with a scrape of his left foot, rolling his eyes and grinning from ear to ear.  \"What is your name?\" asked the General.  \"Sam Allston, sah.\"  \"Who do you belong to?\"  \"I belongs to Massa Allston, sah, from Souf Carolina.\"  \"Where is your master?\"  \"He be at Fairfax; he belong to Souf Carolina regiment, sah.\"  \"How came you here?\"  \"Why, ye see, General, massa told me to go out and buy some chickens, and I come right straight down here, sah.\"  \"You didn't expect to buy them here, did you?\"  \"No, sah; but I thought I would like to see de Yankees.\"  \"I reckon I shall have to send you back, Sam.\"  This was said not seriously, but to test Sam's sincerity.  \"I don't want to go back, sah. Wouldn't go back no how if I could help it; rather go a thousand miles away up Norf than go down Souf, sah. They knock me about down there. Massa whipped me last week, for talking with de other niggers about de war. O massa, don't send me back again! I'll do anything for you, massa.\"  He was the picture of anguish, and stood wringing his hands while the tears rolled down his cheeks. Freedom, with all its imagined blessings, was before him; slavery, with all its certain horrors, behind him.  The General questioned him about the Rebels.  \"They say they will whip you Yankees. Dere's right smart chance of 'em at Fairfax, General Bonham in command. Souf Carolina is kinder mad at you Yankees. But now dey is kinder waiting for you to come, though they be packing up their trunks, as if getting ready to move.\"  All of his stories corroborated previous intelligence, and his information was of value.  \"Well, Sam, I won't send you back,\" said the General. \"You may go where you please about the camp.\"  \"De Lord God Almighty bless you, sah!\" was the joyful exclamation. There was no happier man in the world than Sam Allston that night. He had found that which his soul most longed for,--Freedom!  [Illustration: Aid Society's store-room.]  [Illustration: The ideal freedman.]     CHAPTER II.  BULL RUN.   [Sidenote: July, 1861.]  At noon, on the 17th of July, the troops under General McDowell took up their line of march toward Fairfax, without baggage, carrying three days' rations in their haversacks. One division, under General Tyler, which had been encamped at Falls Church, marched to Vienna, while the other divisions, moving from Alexandria, advanced upon Fairfax Court-House.  It was a grand pageant, the long column of bayonets and high-waving flags. Union men whose homes were at Fairfax accompanied the march. \"It does my eyes good to see the troops in motion at last,\" said one. \"I have been exiled seven weeks. I know nothing about my family, although I have been within a dozen miles of them all the time. I came from the North three years ago. The Secessionists hated me, they threatened to hang me, and I had to leave mighty sudden.\"  The head of General Tyler's column reached Vienna at sunset. The infantry turned into the fields, while the artillery took positions on the hills. Near the railroad was a large woodpile, behind which the South Carolinians took shelter, when they fired upon the Ohio boys on the cars. It was convenient for bivouac fires, and the men helped themselves willingly. There I received instructions from Captain Alexander, of the engineers, an old campaigner in Mexico, which, during the four years of the war, I have never forgotten.  \"Always sleep on the lee side of your bivouac fire,\" he said. \"The fire dries the ground, the heat envelopes you like a blanket; it will keep off fever and ague. Better endure the discomfort of the smoke, better look like a Cincinnati ham, than to feel an ache in every bone in the morning, which you will be likely to feel if you spread your blankets on the windward side, for then you have little benefit of the heat, but receive the full rush of the air, which chills you on one side, while you are roasting on the other.\" It was wise counsel, and by heeding it I have saved my bones from many an ache.  It was at this place that a very laughable incident occurred. One of the citizens of Vienna had a bee-house well stocked with hives. A soldier espied them. He seized a hive and ran. Out came the bees, buzzing about his ears. Another soldier, thinking to do better, upset his hive, and seized the comb, dripping with honey. Being also hotly besieged, he dropped it, ran his hands through his hair, slapped his face, swung his arms, and fought manfully. Other soldiers seeing what was going on, and anxious to secure a portion of the coveted sweets, came up, and over went the half-dozen hives. The air was full of enraged insects, which stung men and horses indiscriminately, and which finally put a whole regiment to flight.  The Southern newspapers at this time were \"firing the Southern heart,\" as they phrased it, by picturing the vandalism of the North. Beauregard, on the 5th of June, at Manassas, issued a manifesto addressed \"to the people of the counties of Loudon, Fairfax, and Prince William.\" Thus it read:--       \"A reckless and unprincipled tyrant has invaded your soil.      Abraham Lincoln, regardless of all moral, legal, and      constitutional restraints, has thrown his abolition hosts among      you, who are murdering and imprisoning your citizens,      confiscating and destroying your property, and committing other      acts of violence and outrage too shocking and revolting to      humanity to be enumerated.       \"All rules of civilized warfare are abandoned, and they proclaim      by their acts, if not on their banners, that their war cry is      'Beauty and Booty.' All that is dear to man,--your honor, and      that of your wives and daughters,--your fortunes and your lives,      are involved in this momentous conflict.\"  In contrast to this fulmination of falsehoods, General McDowell had issued an order on the 2d of June, three days previous, directing officers to transmit statements on the following points:--       \"_First._ The quantity of land taken possession of for the      several field-works, and the kind and value of the crops growing      thereon, if any. _Second._ The quantity of land used for the      several encampments, and the kind and value of the growing      crops, if any. _Third._ The number, size, and character of the      buildings appropriated to public purposes. _Fourth._ The quantity      and value of trees cut down. _Fifth._ The kind and extent of      fencing destroyed. These statements will, as far as possible,      give the value of the property taken, or of the damage sustained,      and the name or names of the owners.\"[1]           [Footnote 1: McDowell's Order.]  A portion of the troops bivouacked in an oat-field, where the grain was standing in shocks, and some of the artillerymen appropriated the convenient forage.  The owner was complaining bitterly of the devastations. \"They have taken my grain, and I want my pay for it,\" he said to me.  \"Are you a Union man?\" I asked.  \"I was for the Union till Virginia seceded, and of course had to go with her; but whether I am a Union man or not, the government is bound to respect private property,\" he replied.  At that moment General Tyler rode past.  \"Say, General, ain't you going to pay me for my property which your soldiers destroyed?\"  \"There is my quartermaster; he will settle it with you.\"  The man received a voucher for whatever had been taken. The column took up its line of march, passed through a narrow belt of woods, and reached a hill from which Fairfax Court-House was in full view. A Rebel flag was waving over the town. There were two pieces of Rebel artillery in a field, a dozen wagons in park, squads of soldiers in sight, horsemen"]]]
