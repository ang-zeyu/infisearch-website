For what says Paul? \"As often as ye eat         this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's 31:24   death till he come.\"                              Painful prospect          Referring to the materiality of the age, Jesus said:         \"The hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor- 31:27   shippers shall worship the Father in spirit         and in truth.\" Again, foreseeing the perse-         cution which would attend the Science of Spirit, Jesus 31:30   said: \"They shall put you out of the synagogues; yea,         the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think         that he doeth God service; and these things will they 32:1    do unto you, because they have not known the Father         nor me.\"                              Sacred sacrament  32:3    In ancient Rome a soldier was required to swear         allegiance to his general. The Latin word for this oath         was /sacramentum/, and our English word 32:6    /sacrament/ is derived from it. Among the         Jews it was an ancient custom for the master of a         feast to pass each guest a cup of wine. But the 32:9    Eucharist does not commemorate a Roman soldier's         oath, nor was the wine, used on convivial occasions and         in Jewish rites, the cup of our Lord. The cup shows 32:12   forth his bitter experience, - the cup which he prayed         might pass from him, though he bowed in holy submis-         sion to the divine decree.  32:15   \"As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed         it and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said,         Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and 32:18   gave thanks, and gave it to them saying, Drink ye all         of it.\"                            Spiritual refreshment          The true sense is spiritually lost, if the sacrament is 32:21   confined to the use of bread and wine. The disciples         had eaten, yet Jesus prayed and gave them         bread. This would have been foolish in a 32:24   literal sense; but in its spiritual signification, it was nat-         ural and beautiful. Jesus prayed; he withdrew from the         material senses to refresh his heart with brighter, with 32:27   spiritual views.                              Jesus' sad repast          The Passover, which Jesus ate with his disciples in         the month Nisan on the night before his crucifixion, 32:30   was a mournful occasion, a sad supper taken         at the close of day, in the twilight of a         glorious career with shadows fast falling around; and 33:1    this supper closed forever Jesus' ritualism or concessions         to matter.                              Heavenly supplies  33:3    His followers, sorrowful and silent, anticipating the hour         of their Master's betrayal, partook of the heavenly manna,         which of old had fed in the wilderness the 33:6    persecuted followers of Truth. Their bread         indeed came down from heaven. It was the great truth         of spiritual being, healing the sick and casting out error. 33:9    Their Master had explained it all before, and now this         bread was feeding and sustaining them. They had borne         this bread from house to house, /breaking/ (explaining) it to 33:12   others, and now it comforted themselves.          For this truth of spiritual being, their Master was about         to suffer violence and drain to the dregs his cup of sorrow. 33:15   He must leave them. With the great glory of an everlast-         ing victory overshadowing him, he gave thanks and said,         \"Drink ye all of it.\"                              The holy struggle  33:18   When the human element in him struggled with the         divine, our great Teacher said: \"Not my will, but         Thine, be done!\"- that is, Let not the flesh, 33:21   but the Spirit, be represented in me. This         is the new understanding of spiritual Love. It gives all         for Christ, or Truth. It blesses its enemies, heals the 33:24   sick, casts out error, raises the dead from trespasses         and sins, and preaches the gospel to the poor, the meek         in heart.                             Incisive questions  33:27   Christians, are you drinking his cup? Have you         shared the blood of the New Covenant, the persecutions         which attend a new and higher understand- 33:30   ing of God? If not, can you then say that         you have commemorated Jesus in his cup? Are all         who eat bread and drink wine in memory of Jesus willing 34:1    truly to drink his cup, take his cross, and leave all for         the Christ-principle? Then why ascribe this inspira- 34:3    tion to a dead rite, instead of showing, by casting out         error and making the body \"holy, acceptable unto God,\"         that Truth has come to the understanding? If Christ, 34:6    Truth, has come to us in demonstration, no other com-         memoration is requisite, for demonstration is Immanuel,         or /God with us/; and if a friend be with us, why need we 34:9    memorials of that friend?                              Millennial glory          If all who ever partook of the sacrament had really         commemorated the sufferings of Jesus and drunk of 34:12   his cup, they would have revolutionized the         world. If all who seek his commemoration         through material symbols will take up the cross, heal 34:15   the sick, cast out evils, and preach Christ, or Truth,         to the poor, - the receptive thought, - they will bring         in the millennium.                           Fellowship with Christ  34:18   Through all the disciples experienced, they became more         spiritual and understood better what the Master had         taught. His resurrection was also their resur- 34:21   rection. It helped them to raise themselves and         others from spiritual dulness and blind belief in God into         the perception of infinite possibilities. They needed this 34:24   quickening, for soon their dear Master would rise again         in the spiritual realm of reality, and ascend far above         their apprehension. As the reward for his faithfulness, 34:27   he would disappear to material sense in that change which         has since been called the ascension.                             The last breakfast          What a contrast between our Lord's last supper and 34:30   his last spiritual breakfast with his disciples         in the bright morning hours at the joyful         meeting on the shore of the Galilean Sea! His gloom 35:1    had passed into glory, and His disciples' grief into repent-         ance, - hearts chastened and pride rebuked. Convinced 35:3    of the fruitlessness of their toil in the dark and wakened         by their Master's voice, they changed their methods, turned         away from material things, and cast their net on the right 35:6    side. Discerning Christ, Truth, anew on the shore of         time, they were enabled to rise somewhat from mortal         sensuousness, or the burial of mind in matter, into new- 35:9    ness of life as Spirit.          This spiritual meeting with our Lord in the dawn of a         new light is the morning meal which Christian Scientists 35:12   commemorate. They bow before Christ, Truth, to re-         ceive more of his reappearing and silently to commune         with the divine Principle, Love. They celebrate their 35:15   Lord's victory over death, his probation in the flesh         after death, its exemplification of human probation, and         his spiritual and final ascension above matter, or the flesh, 35:18   when he rose out of material sight.                             Spiritual Eucharist          Our baptism is a purification from all error. Our         church is built on the divine Principle, Love. We can 35:21   unite with this church only as we are new-         born of Spirit, as we reach the Life which         is Truth and the Truth which is Life by bringing forth 35:24   the fruits of Love, - casting out error and healing the         sick. Our Eucharist is spiritual communion with the one         God. Our bread, \"which cometh down from heaven,\" 35:27   is Truth. Our cup is the cross. Our wine the inspira-         tion of Love, the draught our Master drank and com-         mended to his followers.                                Final purpose  35:30   The design of Love is to reform the sinner. If the         sinner's punishment here has been insufficient to re-         form him, the good man's heaven would be a hell to 36:1    the sinner. They, who know not purity and affection by         experience, can never find bliss in the blessed company of 36:3    Truth and Love simply through translation         into another sphere. Divine Science reveals         the necessity of sufficient suffering, either before or after 36:6    death, to quench the love of sin. To remit the penalty         due for sin, would be for Truth to pardon error. Escape         from punishment is not in accordance with God's govern- 36:9    ment, since justice is the handmaid of mercy.          Jesus endured the shame, that he might pour his         dear-bought bounty into barren lives. What was his 36:12   earthly reward? He was forsaken by all save John,         the beloved disciple, and a few women who bowed in         silent woe beneath the shadow of his cross. The earthly 36:15   price of spirituality in a material age and the great moral         distance between Christianity and sensualism preclude         Christian Science from finding favor with the worldly- 36:18   minded.                            Righteous retribution          A selfish and limited mind may be unjust, but the un-         limited and divine Mind is the immortal law of justice as 36:21   well as of mercy. It is quite as impossible for         sinners to receive their full punishment this         side of the grave as for this world to bestow on the right- 36:24   eous their full"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3458"],["title","Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures (#8)"],["body","ard. It is useless to suppose that the         wicked can gloat over their offences to the last moment         and then be suddenly pardoned and pushed into heaven, 36:27   or that the hand of Love is satisfied with giving us only         toil, sacrifice, cross-bearing, multiplied trials, and mock-         ery of our motives in return for our efforts at well doing.                             Vicarious suffering  36:30   Religious history repeats itself in the suf-         fering of the just for the unjust. Can God         therefore overlook the law of righteousness which de- 37:1    stroys the belief called sin? Does not Science show that         sin brings suffering as much to-day as yesterday? They 37:3    who sin must suffer. \"With what measure ye mete, it         shall be measured to you again.\"                             Martyrs inevitable          History is full of records of suffering. \"The blood of 37:6    the martyrs is the seed of the Church.\" Mortals try in         vain to slay Truth with the steel or the stake,         but error falls only before the sword of Spirit. 37:9    Martyrs are the human links which connect one stage with         another in the history of religion. They are earth's lumi-         naries, which serve to cleanse and rarefy the atmosphere of 37:12   material sense and to permeate humanity with purer ideals.         Consciousness of right-doing brings its own reward; but         not amid the smoke of battle is merit seen and appreciated 37:15   by lookers-on.                             Complete emulation          When will Jesus' professed followers learn to emulate         him in /all/ his ways and to imitate his mighty works? 37:18   Those who procured the martyrdom of that         righteous man would gladly have turned his         sacred career into a mutilated doctrinal platform. May 37:21   the Christians of to-day take up the more practical im-         port of that career! It is possible, - yea, it is the duty         and privilege of every child, man, and woman, - to follow 37:24   in some degree the example of the Master by the demon-         stration of Truth and Life, of health and holiness. Chris-         tians claim to be his followers, but do they follow him in 37:27   the way that he commanded? Hear these imperative com-         mands: \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father         which is in heaven is perfect!\" \"Go ye into all the world, 37:30   and preach the gospel to every creature!\" \"/Heal the         sick/!\"                          Jesus' teaching belittled          Why has this Christian demand so little inspiration 38:1    to stir mankind to Christian effort? Because men are         assured that this command was intended only for a par- 38:3    ticular period and for a select number of fol-         lowers. This teaching is even more pernicious         than the old doctrine of foreordination, - the election of a 38:6    few to be saved, while the rest are damned; and so it will         be considered, when the lethargy of mortals, produced         by man-made doctrines, is broken by the demands of 38:9    divine Science.          Jesus said: \"These signs shall follow them that be-         lieve; . . . they shall lay hands on the sick, and they 38:12   shall recover.\" Who believes him? He was addressing         his disciples, yet he did not say, \" These signs shall follow         /you/,\" but /them/- \"them that believe\" in all time to come. 38:15   Here the word /hands/ is used metaphorically, as in the text,         \"The right hand of the Lord is exalted.\" It expresses         spiritual power; otherwise the healing could not have 38:18   been done spiritually. At another time Jesus prayed, not         for the twelve only, but for as many as should believe         \"through their word.\"                             Material pleasures  38:21   Jesus experienced few of the pleasures of the physical         senses, but his sufferings were the fruits of other peo-         ple's sins, not of his own. The eternal Christ, 38:24   his spiritual selfhood, never suffered. Jesus         mapped out the path for others. He unveiled the Christ,         the spiritual idea of divine Love. To those buried in the 38:27   belief of sin and self, living only for pleasure or the grati-         fication of the senses, he said in substance: Having eyes         ye see not, and having ears ye hear not; lest ye should un- 38:30   derstand and be converted, and I might heal you. He         taught that the material senses shut out Truth and its         healing power.                              Mockery of truth  39:1    Meekly our Master met the mockery of his unrecog-         nized grandeur. Such indignities as he received, his fol- 39:3    lowers will endure until Christianity's last         triumph. He won eternal honors. He over-         came the world, the flesh, and all error, thus proving 39:6    their nothingness. He wrought a full salvation from sin,         sickness, and death. We need \"Christ, and him cruci-         fied.\" We must have trials and self-denials, as well as 39:9    joys and victories, until all error is destroyed.                              A belief suicidal          The educated belief that Soul is in the body causes         mortals to regard death as a friend, as a stepping-stone 39:12   out of mortality into immortality and bliss.         The Bible calls death an enemy, and Jesus         overcame death and the grave instead of yielding to them. 39:15   He was \"the way.\" To him, therefore, death was not         the threshold over which he must pass into living         glory.                              Present salvation  39:18   \"/Now/,\" cried the apostle, \"is the accepted time; be-         hold, /now/ is the day of salvation,\" - meaning, not that         now men must prepare for a future-world salva- 39:21   tion, or safety, but that now is the time in which         to experience that salvation in spirit and in life. Now is         the time for so-called material pains and material pleas- 39:24   ures to pass away, for both are unreal, because impossible         in Science. To break this earthly spell, mortals must get         the true idea and divine Principle of all that really exists 39:27   and governs the universe harmoniously. This thought is         apprehended slowly, and the interval before its attain-         ment is attended with doubts and defeats as well as 39:30   triumphs.                               Sin and penalty          Who will stop the practice of sin so long as he believes         in the pleasures of sin? When mortals once admit that 40:1    evil confers no pleasure, they turn from it. Remove error         from thought, and it will not appear in effect. The ad- 40:3    vanced thinker and devout Christian, perceiv-         ing the scope and tendency of Christian healing         and its Science, will support them. Another will say: 40:6    \"Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient         season I will call for thee.\"          Divine Science adjusts the balance as Jesus adjusted 40:9    it. Science removes the penalty only by first removing         the sin which incurs the penalty. This is my sense of         divine pardon, which I understand to mean God's method 40:12   of destroying sin. If the saying is true, \"While there's         life there's hope,\" its opposite is also true, While there's         sin there's doom. Another's suffering cannot lessen our 40:15   own liability. Did the martyrdom of Savonarola make         the crimes of his implacable enemies less criminal?                            Suffering inevitable          Was it just for Jesus to suffer? No; but it was 40:18   inevitable, for not otherwise could he show us the way         and the power of Truth. If a career so great         and good as that of Jesus could not avert a 40:21   felon's fate, lesser apostles of Truth may endure human         brutality without murmuring, rejoicing to enter into         fellowship with him through the triumphal arch of 40:24   Truth and Love.                             Service and worship          Our heavenly Father, divine Love, demands that all         men should follow the example of our Master and his 40:27   apostles and not merely worship his personal-         ity. It is sad that the phrase /divine service/         has come so generally to mean public worship instead of 40:30   daily deeds.                               Within the veil          The nature of Christianity is peaceful and blessed,         but in order to enter into the kingdom, the anchor of 41:1    hope must be cast beyond the veil of matter into the         Shekinah into which Jesus has passed before us; and 41:3    this advance beyond matter must come         through the joys and triumphs of the right-         eous as well as through their sorrows and afflictions. 41:6    Like our Master, we must depart from material sense         into the spiritual sense of being.                           The thorns and flowers          The God-inspired walk calmly on though it be with 41:9    bleeding footprints, and in the hereafter they will reap         what they now sow. The pampered hypo-         crite may have a flowery pathway here, but 41:12   he cannot forever break the Golden Rule and escape the         penalty due.                             Healing early lost          The proofs of Truth, Life, and Love, which Jesus gave 41:15   by casting out error and healing the sick, completed his         earthly mission; but in the Christian Church         this demonstration of healing was early lost, 41:18   about three centuries after the crucifixion. No ancient         school of philosophy, /materia medica/, or scholastic theol-         ogy ever taught or demonstrated the divine healing of 41:21   absolute Science.                              Immortal achieval          Jesus foresaw the reception Christian Science would have         before"]]]
