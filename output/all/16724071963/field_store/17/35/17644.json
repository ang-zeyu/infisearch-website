In large size of tympanic bullae and wider basisphenoid the specimen agrees with _acutus_, but otherwise is nearly as small as _jaliscensis_ to which it is here referred. Actually the specimen could, with almost equal propriety, be referred to either subspecies.      _Measurements._--The measurements of two males, Nos. 100184,     100182, and average and extreme measurements of five females,     are, respectively, as follows: Total length, 257, 267, 244     (230-251); length of tail, 130, 128, 122 (105-129); length of     hind foot, 32, 31, 31 (30-33); length of ear from notch, 16, 17,     15.3 (13.0-19); weight in grams, 71.5, 65.1, 50.8 (44.8-61.8);     greatest length of skull, 35.2, 34.9, 33.6 (32.7-34.2);     zygomatic breadth, 17.7, 17.5, 16.5 (16.1-17.1); interorbital     breadth, 8.4, 8.1, 7.8 (7.5-8.0); length of nasals, 15.1, 14.9,     14.0 (13.3-14.5); width of braincase, 15.9, 15.1, 15.0     (14.7-15.1); alveolar length of upper molariform tooth-row, 6.0,     6.0, 5.6 (5.5-5.9). The measurements were taken according to the     method of Goldman (N. Amer. Fauna, 34:10, 1911). Each of the     specimens of which measurements are given above is adult; the     transverse enamel fold has been obliterated in M1, is     represented by only an isolated lake in M2 (except in one female     where all trace of the fold has worn away) and is present in M3.      _Specimens examined._--Total, 16, all from Michoacán, Mexico,     and unless otherwise indicated in the University of California     Museum of Vertebrate Zoölogy, as follows: 3 mi. NW Pátzcuaro,     6700 ft., 1; 2 mi. W Pátzcuaro, 7700 ft., 5; 2 mi. W Pátzcuaro,     6700 ft., 2; Pátzcuaro, 1 (U. S. Nat. Mus.); 5 mi.

RAYMOND HALL   In preparing a list of kinds of mammals of which specimens have been saved from the M憖ican state of Michoac嫕, two heretofore unrecognized subspecies of the M憖ican meadow mouse, _Microtus mexicanus_, have been found. Names for these and descriptions are given below.                #Microtus mexicanus fundatus# new subspecies      _Type._--Male, adult, skin and skull; No. 100637, Univ.     California Mus. Vert. Zool.; 3-1/2 mi. S P嫢zcuaro, 7,900 ft.,     Michoac嫕, M憖ico; March 9, 1943; obtained by E. R. Hall,     original no. 5882.      _Range._--Known only from the vicinity of the type locality.      _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements); color brown     overlain with cinnamon; nasals expanded distally with     premaxillary borders concave laterally; posterior border of     orbit inclined posterolaterally; preorbital region and     interparietal region depressed; incisive foramina narrow;     zygomatic arches parallel; tympanic bullae much inflated.      _Comparisons._--Among named subspecies of _Microtus mexicanus_,     _M. m. fundatus_ most closely resembles _M. m. mexicanus_ but     differs as follows: Larger in all parts measured; pelage with     slightly less buffy color and with the buffy color that is     present of a slightly lighter tint; posterior two-thirds of     premaxillary border of each nasal concave rather than straight;     posterior border of orbit forming more acute angle with sagittal     plane of posterior part of skull; superior outline of nasals     straight rather than depressed in posterior part; tympanic     bullae more inflated both in vertical and horizontal planes.      From _M. c. salvus_, the subspecies next to the westward,     _fundatus_ differs as follows: Averaging larger in all parts     measured; less reddish on upper parts; underparts with more     reddish color but the reddish of lighter tint; perineal region     buffy instead of plumbeous; nasals with premaxillary borders     laterally concave rather than straight; superior outline of     skull with nasal segment sloping anteroventrally and     interparietal segment sloping posteroventrally rather than     straight; posterior margin of orbit inclined posterolaterally     thus forming an acute angle, instead of a right angle, with     sagittal plane of braincase; zygomatic arches parallel rather     than bowed outward; incisive foramina narrower; tympanic bullae     more inflated in vertical plane.      Relying on Bailey's (N. Amer. Fauna, 17:55, 1900) description of     _Microtus fulviventer_, _fundatus_ differs in much larger     tympanic bullae.  _Remarks._--The series of 59 specimens includes individuals of several ages of both sexes. This has been a great advantage in making comparisons with individuals of geographically adjoining subspecies since individuals of the same age and sex could be compared. When the skulls are laid top-side down on a flat surface the occiput is much higher than in _salvus_.  Our specimens, taken in the dry season, were trapped mostly in runways beneath a dense growth of grass underneath a rail fence.      _Specimens examined._--Total, 59, distributed, with respect to     the town of P嫢zcuaro, as follows: 3-1/2 mi. S, 7,900 ft., 9;     4 mi. S, 7,800 ft., 16; 5 mi. S, 7,800 ft., 26; 9 mi. SE, 8,000     ft., 8.      [Illustration: FIGS. 1-6.

FIGS. 1-3. _Microtus mexicanus fundatus._       FIGS. 4-6. _Microtus mexicanus salvus._]   #Microtus mexicanus salvus# new subspecies      _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 52099, Chicago     Natural History Museum; Mount Tancitaro, 11,400 ft., Michoac嫕,     M憖ico; July 19, 1941; obtained by F. C. Wonder, original No.     1163.      _Range._--Known only from Mount Tancitaro at elevations of 7,800     to 11,400 feet.      _Diagnosis._--Size medium (see measurements); color brown     overlain with cinnamon; premaxillary borders of nasals straight;     superior outline of skull nearly straight; posterior margin of     orbit at right angle with long axis of skull; zygomatic arches     bowed outward; incisive foramina wide; tympanic bullae small.      _Comparisons._--From topotypes of its nearest relative,     _Microtus mexicanus phaeus_ Merriam, _salvus_ differs as     follows: Tail shorter; pelage with slightly more buffy (reddish)     pigment which, nevertheless, is of a lighter tint; premaxillary     borders of nasals straight rather than concave; superior outline     of skull more nearly straight (less convex); inferior border of     rostrum more nearly straight (less concave distally); palatal     fossae uniformly shallower.      Comparison with _M. m. fundatus_ is made in the account of that     subspecies.  _Remarks._--The degree of difference between _M. m. salvus_ and _M. m. fundatus_ exceeds that between _M. m. salvus_ and _M. m. phaeus_ or that between _M. m. fundatus_ and _M. m. mexicanus_.      _Specimens examined._--Total, 14, from Mount Tancitaro,     Michoac嫕, distributed, according to elevation above sea level,     as follows: 11,400 feet, 8; 11,000 ft., 2; 7,800 ft., 1; no     elevation recorded, 8.      _Measurements of the two subspecies._--Average and extreme     measurements of ten adult males of _M. m. fundatus_ and eight     adult males of _M. m. salvus_, are, respectively, as follows:     Total length, 147 (135-158), 141 (134-146); length of tail, 33.4     (30-39), 29.6 (25-32); length of hind foot, 21.1 (20-22), 20.0     (18-21); condylobasal length, 27.7 (27.0-29.0), 25.9     (25.5-26.2); occipitonasal length, 27.5 (26.8-28.5), 25.7     (25.3-26.0); length of nasals, 8.0 (7.7-8.4), 7.5 (6.9-8.1);     zygomatic breadth, 16.4 (15.9-17.2), 15.0 (14.6-15.3);     interorbital breadth, 3.7 (3.5-3.9), 3.5 (3.3-3.6); mastoid     breadth, 12.7 (12.2-13.2), 11.7 (11.7-11.7); alveolar length of     upper molar series, 7.0 (6.8-7.3), 6.7 (6.5-6.9); width of     rostrum, 5.7 (5.1-5.9), 5.3 (5.3-5.3); palatilar length, 13.3     (12.7-14.3), 12.6 (11.9-12.9). Of _M. m. salvus_ only two     specimens yield data for the first, second, sixth and eighth     cranial measurements named above.  For the loan of comparative material I am grateful to Dr. Hartley H. T. Jackson and Mr. Stanley P. Young of the Biological Surveys Collection in the United States National Museum, Messrs. Karl P. Schmidt and Collin C.
