In this investigation _Rubus_ seeds (blackberries or raspberries) are always reckoned as cultivated fruit, though probably most often wild. Besides fruit, a few seeds and rose haws were found, which with a little rubbish complete the vegetable food (40.41 per cent).  Following is a list of fruits, seeds, etc., identified and the number of stomachs in which found:     Yew berries (_Taxus minor_)                   1   False Solomon's seal (_Smilacina racemosa_)   1   Bayberries (_Myrica carolinensis_)            1   Mulberries (_Morus_ sp.)                     10   Spiceberries (_Benzoin æstivale_)             5   Currants (_Ribes_ sp.)                        1   Mountain ash (_Pyrus americanus_)             2   Service berries (_Amelanchier canadensis_)    2   Blackberries or raspberries (_Rubus_ sp.)    17   Rose haws (_Rosa_ sp.)                        1   Wild black cherries (_Prunus serotina_)       1   Chokecherries (_Prunus virginiana_)           7   Domestic cherries (_Prunus cerasus_)          4   Croton (_Croton_ sp.)                         1   American holly (_Ilex opaca_)                 2   Woodbine berries (_Psedera quinquefolia_)     1   Frost grapes (_Vitis cordifolia_)             4   Wild sarsaparilla (_Aralia nudicaulis_)       1   Flowering dogwood (_Cornus florida_)          3   Rough-leaved cornel (_Cornus asperifolia_)    4   Dogwood (_Cornus_ sp.)                        1   Black gum (_Nyssa sylvatica_)                 1   Huckleberries (_Gaylussacia_ sp.)             1   Blueberries (_Vaccinium_ sp.)                 6   French mulberry (_Callicarpa americana_)      1   Black elderberries (_Sambucus canadensis_)    1   Other elderberries (_Sambucus_ sp.)           3   Fruit pulp not further identified            12   Of the two stomachs not included in the foregoing discussion, the one taken in Florida in January contained 93 per cent of wild fruit and 7 per cent of weevils, wasps, and spiders; the one collected in Alabama in February was entirely filled with animal food, of which 88 per cent was caterpillars, 5 per cent May beetles, 6 per cent bugs, and 1 per cent spiders.  _Summary._--The animal food of the wood thrush includes remarkably few useful insects and contains some very harmful ones, as the Colorado potato beetle and many of the Scarabæidæ, the larval forms of which are the well-known white grubs which are a pest to agriculture in preying upon roots of plants. The vegetable portion of the food contains a small quantity of cultivated fruit, but observation shows that the thrush is in the habit of picking up fallen fruit instead of taking it fresh from the tree. The eating of wild fruit has no economic interest except that it serves to distribute the seeds of many shrubs and trees. There is no occasion to discriminate against this bird in any way. It should be rigidly protected.     VEERY AND WILLOW THRUSH.  (_Hylocichla fuscescens fuscescens_ and _Hylocichla fuscescens salicicola_.)   The veery is distributed over the eastern portion of the United States during migration and breeds in the Northern States as far south as Pennsylvania, and in New England and Canada. In winter it disappears almost entirely from the country, only a few remaining in Florida and perhaps in other Southern States. Its western representative is the willow thrush. Like other thrushes, birds of this species are shy and retiring in disposition, keeping for the most part in the shade of woods or bushy swamps, or building nests in a damp ravine with a brook gurgling past. They have been known, however, to visit orchards and sometimes gardens which are not kept too trim. It is thus evident that the food has little direct economic interest, as this bird does not come in contact with the farmer's crops.  For investigating the food of the species 176 stomachs were available. They were collected during the seven months from April to October, and represent 18 States, the District of Columbia, and Canada. The food separates into 57.27 per cent of animal matter and 42.73 per cent of vegetable. The former consists mostly of remains of insects, and the latter of fruit.  _Animal food._--Predacious ground beetles (Carabidæ) amount to 0.82 per cent. They are evidently not a preferred food. Beetles in general comprise 14.67 per cent of the food, but no family or other group appears to be distinguished except the Carabidæ, which are conspicuous by their absence. Weevils, or snout beetles, amount to 2.49 per cent, and one stomach contained a specimen of the notorious plum curculio (_Conotrachelus nenuphar_). A number of other harmful beetles were noted, but none are so well known as the plum destroyer. Ants make up 10.35 per cent and are eaten with great regularity. Hymenoptera other than ants amount to only 3.26 per cent, but are eaten regularly throughout the season. Hemiptera (bugs) were eaten to a small extent (1.30 per cent) in the first four months, but they are not seen after July. Exactly the same may be said of Diptera, which total only 0.85 per cent.  Lepidoptera (caterpillars) are, next to Hymenoptera, the favorite insect food. They were eaten in goodly quantities in every month except October. The average for the season is 11.91 per cent. Grasshoppers appear to some extent in every month except April, the greatest consumption taking place in October (24 per cent), but as only small numbers are eaten in the earlier months the aggregate for the year is only 4.91 per cent. A few other insects of various orders amount to 0.98 per cent. Spiders (6.34 per cent) are eaten regularly and constantly through the season, except that none were taken in October. A few sowbugs, snails, etc. (2.70 per cent), complete the quota of animal food. Following is a list of insects identified and the number of stomachs in which found:     HYMENOPTERA.    _Tiphia inornata_                 1    COLEOPTERA    _Elaphrus ruscarius_              1   _Anisodactylus harrisi_           1   _Anisodactylus_ sp                1   _Pterostichus lucublandus_        1   _Hydrobius fuscipes_              1   _Ips fasciata_                    1   _Byrrhus murinus_                 1   _Dolopius lateralis_              2   _Limonius æger_                   1   _Corymbites cylindriformis_       1   _Corymbites spinosus_             1   _Corymbites tarsalis_             1   _Corymbites hieroglyphicus_       1   _Podabrus flavicollis_            1   _Telephorus bilineatus_           2   _Telephorus_ sp                   1   _Onthophagus_ sp                  2   _Atænius cognatus_                1   _Aphodius_ sp                     3   _Dichelonycha_ sp                 2   _Serica sericea_                  1   _Lachnosterna hirticula_          1   _Lachnosterna_ sp                13   _Chrysomela pulchra_              3   _Chlamys plicata_                 1   _Typophorus canellus_             1   _Graphops simplex_                1   _Graphops_ sp                     1   _Calligrapha philadelphica_       1   _Œdionychis quercata_             1   _Microrhopala vittata_            1   _Hormorus undulatus_              1   _Phyxelis rigidus_                1   _Otiorhynchus ovatus_             1   _Neoptochus adspersus_            1   _Cercopeus chrysorrhœus_          2   _Barypithes pellucidus_           2   _Sitones_ sp                      2   _Phytonomus nigrirostris_         2   _Conotrachelus nenuphar_          1   _Conotrachelus posticatus_        1   _Tyloderma_ sp                    1   _Monarthrum mali_                 1   _Xyloteres politus_               1    DIPTERA.    _Bibio_ sp                        1   _Vegetable food._--The vegetable portion of the food of the species is made up of fruit, with a few seeds and a little miscellaneous matter more or less accidental. Fruit collectively amounts to 35.30 per cent, of which 12.14 per cent was thought to be of cultivated varieties and so recorded, while the remainder, 23.16 per cent, was quite certainly of wild species. This percentage of cultivated fruit is more than three times the record of the wood thrush, while the wild fruit eaten is correspondingly less, as the sum total of the fruit consumed is very nearly the same with both birds. From this percentage of domestic fruit one might infer that the veery was, or might be, a serious menace to fruit growing, but no such complaints have been heard, and it is probable that the species is not numerous enough to damage cultivated crops. A close inspection, however, of the fruit eating of the veery removes all doubts. The cultivated fruit, so called, was in every case either strawberries or _Rubus_ fruits, i. e., blackberries or raspberries, and as both of these grow wild and in abundance wherever the veery spends its summer, it is probable that all of the fruit eaten was taken from wild plants, though 12.14 per cent has been conventionally recorded as cultivated.  Besides fruit, the veery eats a few seeds of grasses and weeds and a few of sumac, but none of the poisonous species were found in the stomachs. These seeds (7.25 per cent of the food) were eaten so irregularly as to suggest that they are merely a makeshift taken for want of something better. Rubbish (0.18 per cent), consisting of decayed wood, bits of leaves, plant stems, etc., completes the vegetable food.  Following is a list of the items of vegetable food and the number of stomachs in which found:     Yew berries (_Taxus minor_)                        1   Pigeon grass seed (_Chætochloa_ sp.)               1   Rush grass seed (_Sporobolus minor_)               1   False Solomon's seal (_Smilacina_ sp.)             1   Greenbrier berries (_Smilax_ sp.)                  2   Hackberries (_Celtis occidentalis_)                1   Poke berries (_Phytolacca decandra_)               3   Spice berries (_Benzoin æstivale_)                 2   Service berries (_Amelanchier canadensis_)         3   June berries (_Amelanchier_ sp.)

The animal food includes less than 1 per cent of useful beetles, and the remainder is either harmful or neutral. In the matter of vegetable food there seems to be no chance for criticism, as nature evidently supplies all it needs. The bird has never been harmed, but has been held in high esteem for sentimental reasons; let it also be valued and protected for its economic worth.     GRAY-CHEEKED AND BICKNELL'S THRUSHES.  (_Hylocichla aliciæ aliciæ_ and _Hylocichla aliciæ bicknelli_.)   The gray-cheeked thrush (_H. a. aliciæ_) is found in migration over all the Eastern States, but breeds farther north, beyond our limits. Bicknell's thrush (_H. a. bicknelli_), a closely related form, while having somewhat the same general range, breeds farther south and nests in the mountains of northern New York and New England. Both subspecies have the same general habits as other forms of the genus so far as haunts and choice of residence are concerned, but their far-northern range excludes them from coming into contact with cultivated crops. The species does not seem to be very abundant anywhere, and consequently only a few stomachs have been received for examination. In all they number but 111 and are very irregularly distributed in time. None were taken in August and only one in July and two in June. From so scanty and unevenly distributed material it is impossible to draw final conclusions, but we can get some idea as to the nature of the bird's food and its economic importance.  The first analysis of the food gives 74.86 per cent of animal matter to 25.14 per cent of vegetable. This is the most animal food found in the stomachs of any bird of the genus _Hylocichla_ and the largest but two of any of the thrushes.  _Animal food._--Beetles collectively amount to about one-third of all the food (33.32 per cent). Of these, 2.83 per cent are the useful Carabidæ. The rest belong to harmful families, such as the Scarabæidæ, Elateridæ, and the weevils, or snout beetles. Ants amount to 16.34 per cent and are eaten very regularly--the most in the early part of the season. Hymenoptera other than ants, as wasps and bees, were eaten to the extent of 5.60 per cent, and with the ants make 21.94 per cent, placing this food next in rank to beetles. As in the case of ants, most of the bees and wasps were eaten in the first three months of the season. No honey bees were found. Lepidoptera (caterpillars) were third in order of abundance (8.81 per cent). No special pest was discovered, but all caterpillars may be considered as harmful. A few grasshoppers were found in the stomachs taken in April and May, and more in those collected in September and October. They do not appear to be a favorite food and amount to only 1.72 per cent. Other insects, as flies, bugs, and a few others, collectively amount to 2.89 per cent. Among these, it is of interest to note in one stomach the remains of the famous seventeen-year locust (_Tibicen septemdecem_), rather large game for so small a bird. Spiders are freely eaten by the gray-cheeked thrush in spring, and sparingly in fall. For the season they constitute 5.77 per cent of the food. A few other animals, as crawfish, sowbugs, and angleworms (0.41 per cent), complete the animal food.  Following is a list of the insects identified and the number of stomachs in which found:     HYMENOPTERA.    _Lophyrus_ sp                     1   _Aphænogaster tennesseense_       1    COLEOPTERA.    _Cychrus andrewsi_                2   _Cychrus_ sp                      2   _Dyschirius hispidus_             1   _Hister sedecimstriatus_          1   _Phelister vernus_                1   _Epuræa rufa_                     3   _Stelidota 8-maculata_            1   _Byrrhus murinus_                 1   _Eucinetus morio_                 1   _Monocrepidius vespertinus_       1   _Agriotes limosus_                1   _Corymbites signaticollis_        1   _Podabrus flavicollis_            1   _Telephorus bilineatus_           1   _Onthophagus_ sp                  1   _Atænius strigatus_               1   _Atænius ovatulus_                1   _Atænius_ sp                      3   _Aphodius ruricola_               1   _Aphodius inquinatus_             3   _Aphodius_ sp                     1   _Serica_ sp                       1   _Lachnosterna_ sp                10   _Anomala_ sp                      1   _Leptura sphæricollis_            1   _Leptura mutabilis_               1   _Chrysomela pulchra_              4   _Blapstinus metallicus_           1   _Helops micans_                   1   _Hormorus undulatus_              1   _Otiorhynchus ovatus_             1   _Cercopeus chrysorrhœus_          2   _Pandeletejus hilaris_            1   _Sitones_ sp                      1   _Hylobius pales_                  1   _Desmoris constrictus_            1   _Bagous sellatus_                 1   _Anthonomus sycophanta_           1   _Conotrachelus posticatus_        2   _Acalles clavatus_                1   _Acalles_ sp                      1   _Cryptorhynchus ferratus_         1   _Sphenophorus melanocephalus_     1    HEMIPTERA.    _Tibicen septendecem_             1   _Nezara hilaris_                  1   _Vegetable food._--A few _Rubus_ seeds were recorded as cultivated fruit, but they were found in only two stomachs and probably were wild, as the gray-cheeked thrush does not live where it is likely to come in contact with cultivated blackberries or raspberries. In any case they amount to only 0.15 per cent. Wild fruits of 18 different species (23.98 per cent) make up nearly one-fourth of the whole food--in fact, the vegetable food, other than wild fruit, is insignificant. Wild berries supplement the regular food, which consists of insects and spiders.  The following list shows the fruits and seeds identified and the number of stomachs in which found:     False spikenard (_Smilacina racemosa_)         1   Greenbrier berries (_Smilax_ sp.)              2   Bayberries (_Myrica carolinensis_)             1   Poke berries (_Phytolacca decandra_)           2   Crab apples (_Pyrus_ sp.)                      1   Wild black cherries (_Prunus serotina_)        5   Blackberries or raspberries (_Rubus_ sp.)      2   Sumac berries (_Rhus_ sp.)                     1   Black-alder berries (_Ilex verticillata_)      1   Wild grapes (_Vitis_ sp.)                      5   Wild sarsaparilla (_Aralia_ sp.)               1   Flowering dogwood (_Cornus florida_)           5   Rough-leaved dogwood (_Cornus asperifolia_)    2   White cornel (_Cornus candidissima_)           1   Dogwood (_Cornus_ sp.)                         1   Sour gum (_Nyssa sylvatica_)                   2   Black nightshade (_Solanum nigrum_)            1   Dockmackie (_Viburnum acerifolium_)            1   Arrowwood (_Viburnum_ sp.)                     1   Elderberries (_Sambucus canadensis_)           3   Fruit not further identified                   6   _Summary._--In the food of the gray-cheeked thrush the only useful element is a small percentage (2.83) of useful beetles. The remainder of the animal food is composed of either harmful or neutral elements. The vegetable food, drawn entirely from nature's great storehouse, contains no product of human industry, either of grain or fruit. Whatever the sentimental reasons for protecting this bird, the economic ones are equally valid.     OLIVE-BACKED AND RUSSET-BACKED THRUSHES.  (_Hylocichla ustulata swainsoni_ and _Hylocichla ustulata ustulata_.)   The olive-backed thrush and its relative, the russet-backed, occupy the whole of the United States at some time during the year. The olive-back breeds north of our northern border, except in the higher mountains, and the russet-back on the Pacific coast nests as far south as southern California. The habits of birds of this species resemble those of others of the genus in living in swamps and woodlands rather than in gardens and orchards. The russet-back on the Pacific coast, however, seems to have become quite domestic, and wherever a stream runs through or past an orchard or garden, or the orchard is near thick chaparral, this bird is sure to be found taking its toll of the fruit and rearing its young in the thicket beside the stream. During the cherry season it takes a liberal share of the fruit, but its young, then in the nest, are fed almost entirely on insects. The eastern subspecies, on the contrary, does not come in contact with domestic fruit or any other product of husbandry. A great "]]]
