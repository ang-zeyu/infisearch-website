By  _E. G. Thomssen, Ph. D._  ILLUSTRATED   NEW YORK  D. VAN NOSTRAND COMPANY  EIGHT WARREN STREET  1922  COPYRIGHT 1922  BY  D. VAN NOSTRAND COMPANY  Printed in the United States of America         *       *       *       *       *  Transcriber's note:  This is a series of articles collected into a book. There are differences in spelling and punctuation in the different chapters (e.g. cocoanut in one chapter and coconut in another). These differences were left in the text as they appeared.  For Text: A word surrounded by a tilde such as ~this~ signifies that the word is bolded in the text. A word surrounded by underscores like _this_ signifies the word is italics in the text.  For numbers and equations: Parentheses have been added to clarify fractions. Underscores before bracketed numbers in equations denote a subscript.  Minor typos have been corrected and footnotes moved to the end of the chapters.         *       *       *       *       *   PREFATORY NOTE.   The material contained in this work appeared several years ago in serial form in the American Perfumer and Essential Oil Review. Owing to the numerous requests received, it has been decided to now place before those interested, these articles in book form. While it is true that the works pertaining to the soapmaking industry are reasonably plentiful, books are quite rare, however, which, in a brief volume, will clearly outline the processes employed together with the necessary methods of analyses from a purely practical standpoint. In the work presented the author has attempted to briefly, clearly, and fully explain the manufacture of soap in such language that it might be understood by all those interested in this industry. In many cases the smaller plants find it necessary to dispense with the services of a chemist, so that it is necessary for the soapmaker to make his own tests. The tests outlined, therefore, are given as simple as possible to meet this condition. The formulae submitted are authentic, and in many cases are now being used in soapmaking.  In taking up the industry for survey it has been thought desirable to first mention and describe the raw materials used; second, to outline the processes of manufacture; third, to classify the methods and illustrate by formulae the composition of various soaps together with their mode of manufacture; fourth, to enumerate the various methods of glycerine recovery, including the processes of saponification, and, fifth, to give the most important analytical methods which are of value to control the process of manufacture and to determine the purity and fitness of the raw material entering into it.  It is not the intention of the author to go into great detail in this work, nor to outline to any great extent the theoretical side of the subject, but rather to make the work as brief as possible, keeping the practical side of the subject before him and not going into concise descriptions of machinery as is very usual in works on this subject. Illustrations are merely added to show typical kinds of machinery used.  The author wishes to take this opportunity of thanking Messrs. L. S. Levy and E. W. Drew for the reading of proof, and Mr. C. W. Aiken of the Houchin-Aiken Co., for his aid in making the illustrations a success, as well as others who have contributed in the compiling of the formulae for various soaps. He trusts that this work may prove of value to those engaged in soap manufacture.  E. G. T.  January, 1922     TABLE OF CONTENTS.   CHAPTER I.

Soap is ordinarily thought of as the common cleansing agent well known to everyone. In a general and strictly chemical sense this term is applied to the salts of the non-volatile fatty acids. These salts are not only those formed by the alkali metals, sodium and potassium, but also those formed by the heavy metals and alkaline earths. Thus we have the insoluble soaps of lime and magnesia formed when we attempt to wash in \"hard water\"; again aluminum soaps are used extensively in polishing materials and to thicken lubricating oils; ammonia or \"benzine\" soaps are employed among the dry cleaners. Commonly, however, when we speak of soap we limit it to the sodium or potassium salt of a higher fatty acid.  It is very generally known that soap is made by combining a fat or oil with a water solution of sodium hydroxide (caustic soda lye), or potassium hydroxide (caustic potash). Sodium soaps are always harder than potassium soaps, provided the same fat or oil is used in both cases.  The detergent properties of soap are due to the fact that it acts as an alkali regulator, that is, when water comes into contact with soap, it undergoes what is called hydrolytic dissociation. This means that it is broken down by water into other substances. Just what these substances are is subject to controversy, though it is presumed caustic alkali and the acid alkali salt of the fatty acids are formed.   OILS AND FATS.  There is no sharp distinction between fat and oil. By \"oil\" the layman has the impression of a liquid which at warm temperature will flow as a slippery, lubricating, viscous fluid; by \"fat\" he understands a greasy, solid substance unctuous to the touch. It thus becomes necessary to differentiate the oils and fats used in the manufacture of soap.  Inasmuch as a soap is the alkali salt of a fatty acid, the oil or fat from which soap is made must have as a constituent part, these fatty acids. Hydrocarbon oils or paraffines, included in the term \"oil,\" are thus useless in the process of soap-making, as far as entering into chemical combination with the caustic alkalis is concerned. The oils and fats which form soap are those which are a combination of fatty acids and glycerine, the glycerine being obtained as a by-product to the soap-making industry.   NATURE OF A FAT OR OIL USED IN SOAP MANUFACTURE.  Glycerine, being a trihydric alcohol, has three atoms of hydrogen which are replaceable by three univalent radicals of the higher members of the fatty acids, _e. g._,                  OH                       OR     C_{3} H_{5} OH + 3 ROH = C_{3} H_{5} OR + 3 H_{2}O                 OH                       OR  Glycerine plus 3 Fatty Alcohols equals Fat or Oil plus 3 Water.  Thus three fatty acid radicals combine with one glycerine to form a true neutral oil or fat which are called triglycerides. The fatty acids which most commonly enter into combination of fats and oils are lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic and oleic acids and form the neutral oils or triglycerides derived from these, _e. g._, stearin, palmatin, olein. Mono and diglycerides are also present in fats.   SAPONIFICATION DEFINED.  When a fat or oil enters into chemical combination with one of the caustic hydrates in the presence of water, the process is called \"saponification\" and the new compounds formed are soap and glycerine, thus:                 OR                       OH     C_{3}H_{5} OR + 3 NaOH = C_{3}H_{5} OH + 3 NaOR                OR                       OH  Fat or Oil plus 3 Sodium Hydrate equals Glycerine plus 3 Soap.  It is by this reaction almost all of the soap used today is made.  There are also other means of saponification, as, the hydrolysis of an oil or fat by the action of hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, by autoclave and by ferments or enzymes. By these latter processes the fatty acids and glycerine are obtained directly, no soap being formed.   FATS AND OILS USED IN SOAP MANUFACTURE.  The various and most important oils and fats used in the manufacture of soap are, tallow, cocoanut oil, palm oil, olive oil, poppy oil, sesame oil, soya bean oil, cotton-seed oil, corn oil and the various greases. Besides these the fatty acids, stearic, red oil (oleic acid) are more or less extensively used. These oils, fats and fatty acids, while they vary from time to time and to some extent as to their color, odor and consistency, can readily be distinguished by various physical and chemical constants.  Much can be learned by one, who through continued acquaintance with these oils has thoroughly familiarized himself with the indications of a good or bad oil, by taste, smell, feel and appearance. It is, however, not well for the manufacturer in purchasing to depend entirely upon these simpler tests. Since he is interested in the yield of glycerine, the largest possible yield of soap per pound of soap stock and the general body and appearance of the finished product, the chemical tests upon which these depend should be made. Those especially important are the acid value, percentage unsaponifiable matter and titer test.  A short description of the various oils and fats mentioned is sufficient for their use in the soap industry.  _Tallow_ is the name given to the fat extracted from the solid fat or \"suet\" of cattle, sheep or horses. The quality varies greatly, depending upon the seasons of the year, the food and age of the animal and the method of rendering. It comes to the market under the distinction of edible and inedible, a further distinction being made in commerce as beef tallow, mutton tallow or horse tallow. The better quality is white and bleaches whiter upon exposure to air and light, though it usually has a yellowish tint, a well defined grain and a clean odor. It consists chiefly of stearin, palmitin and"]]]
