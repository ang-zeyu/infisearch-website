The consequence of universal perfect business? Occupation of children?]  14. Persons who are engaged in manual labor in the open air obtain all the exercise necessary for bodily health in their regular business: their need is more likely to be a discipline or exercise of the mind. A perfect business of life, therefore, would be one which would combine both physical and mental labor in their proper proportions. If such a business were possible for all the human race, life would thereby be vastly prolonged. Such is, in fact, to a large extent, the occupation pertaining to one period of life--childhood. A part of the time is spent by the child in improving his mind by study, and another part of the time he has physical exercise in his games and sports.  [Sidenote: 15 In what does exercise consist? Effects of it?]  15. THE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE.--Exercise consists in a well-regulated use of the voluntary muscular system. The effects, however, are not limited to the parts used. Other organs, which are not under the control of the will, are indirectly influenced by it. For instance, the heart beats more rapidly, the skin acts more freely, and {31} becomes hotter, as well as the parts beneath it, and the appetite and power of digestion are increased. An increased exhalation from the lungs and skin purifies the current of the circulation, and the body as a whole thrives under its influence.  [Sidenote: 16. General effect upon the muscles? Special effect? Effects of inaction? Of excessive exercise?]  16. The immediate effect of exercise, however, is upon the muscles themselves; for by use they become firm and large, and increase in power. If we examine a muscle thus improved by exercise, we find that its fibres have become larger and more closely blended together, that its color is of a darker red, and that the supply of blood-vessels has increased. Without exercise the muscle appears thin, flabby, and pale. On the other hand, excessive exercise, without sufficient relaxation, produces in the muscle a condition not very different from that which follows disuse. The muscle is worn out faster than nature builds it up, and it becomes flabby, pale, and weak.  [Sidenote: 17. Of violent and spasmodic efforts? Strength, how attained? Give the particulars.]  17. Violent exercise is not beneficial; and spasmodic efforts to increase the muscular strength are not calculated to secure such a result. Strength is the result of a gradual growth, and is most surely acquired if the exercise be carried to a point short of fatigue, and after an adequate interval of rest. To gain the most beneficial results, the exercise should be at regular hours, and during a regular period. The activity of the exercise, and the time devoted to it must vary, of course, with the strength of the individual, and should be carefully measured by it.  [Sidenote: 18. What may walking be called? What further is said of walking?]  18. DIFFERENT MODES OF EXERCISE.--There are very few who have not the power to walk. There is required for it no expensive apparatus, nor does it demand a period of preliminary training. _Walking may be called the universal exercise._ With certain foreign nations, the English {32} especially, it is a very popular exercise, and is practised habitually by almost every class of society; by the wealthy as well as by those who have no carriages; by women as well as by men.  [Sidenote: 19. What is said of running, and other like movements? What, as related to childhood? What instances are alluded to? Example?]  19. Running, leaping, and certain other more rapid and violent movements, are the forms of exercise that are most enjoyed in childhood. For the child, they are not too severe, but they may be so prolonged as to become injurious. Instances have been recorded where sudden death has resulted after violent playing, from overtaxing the heart: for example, we have the case of a young girl who, while skipping the rope, and endeavoring to excel her playmates by jumping the greatest number of times, fell dead from rupture of the heart.  [Sidenote: 20. Carriage-riding? Horseback-riding?]  20. Carriage-riding, as a means of passive exercise, is particularly well suited to invalids, and persons advanced in life. Horseback exercise brings into use a greater number of muscles than any other one exercise, and with it there is an exhilaration of feeling which refreshes the mind at the same time. It is one of the manliest of exercises, but not less suitable for women than for men. To be skilful in riding, it is best to begin its practice in youth; but there are very few kinds of exercise of which the same is not equally true.  [Sidenote: 21. Boating, swimming, and skating?]  21. For those who live near streams or bodies of water, there are the delightful recreations of boating, swimming, and skating. Certain of these exercises have a practical importance aside from and above their use in increasing the physical vigor. This is especially true of boating and swimming, since they are often the means of saving life. Practice in these exercises also teaches self-reliance, courage, and presence of mind. Persons who have become proficient in these vigorous exercises are generally the ones, {33} who, in times of danger, are the quickest to act and the most certain to do so with judgment.  [Sidenote: 22. What kind of exercise yields the best results? What advice is given?]  22. PHYSICAL CULTURE.--That form of exercise which interests and excites the mind, will yield the best results; but to some persons no kind of exertion whatever is, at first, agreeable. They should, nevertheless, make a trial of some exercise, in the expectation that, as they become proficient in it, it will become more pleasant. In exercise, as many sets of muscles should be employed as possible, open-air exercise being the best. Parlor gymnastics, and the discipline of the gymnasium are desirable, but they should not be the sole reliance for physical culture. No in-door exercise, however excellent in itself, can fill the place of hearty and vigorous activity in the open air.  [Sidenote: 23. Physical culture among the ancients? In Greece? In schools and colleges at the present time? Result to the body and mind?]  23. GYMNASTIC EXERCISES FOR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES.--In the system of education among the ancients, physical culture predominated. In ancient Greece, physical exercises in schools were prescribed and regulated by law, and hence these schools were called _gymnasia_. At the present time, on the contrary, this culture is almost wholly unknown, as a part of the course of education, in our schools and colleges. In a few of our institutions of learning, however, physical exercises have been introduced, with manifest advantage to the students, and they form a part of the regular curriculum of exercises,--as much so as the recitations in geography, grammar, or Greek. The good effect of the experiments, as shown in improved scholarship as well as increased bodily vigor, in the institutions where the plan has been tried, will, it is hoped, lead to its universal adoption. We should then hear less frequently of parents being obliged to withdraw their children from school, because they become exhausted {34} or, perchance, have lost their health from intense and protracted mental application.  [Sidenote: 24. The result of gymnastics in our colleges and other institutions of learning?]  24. Were gymnastics more common in our educational institutions we should not so often witness the sad spectacle of young men and women leaving our colleges and seminaries, with finished educations it may be, but with constitutions so impaired, that the life which should be devoted to the accomplishment of noble purposes must be spent in search of health. Spinal curvatures, which, according to the experience of physicians, are now extremely frequent, especially among ladies, would give place to the steady gait and erect carriage which God designed his human creatures should maintain.  25. All the exercises necessary for the proper development of the body may be obtained from the use of a few simple contrivances that every one can have at home, at little cost--less by far than is spent for useless toys. Many of these may be made available in the parlor or chamber, though all exercises are far more useful in the open air. A small portion of the day thus spent will afford agreeable recreation as well as useful exercise. The Indian club, the wand, the ring, and the dumb-bells answer ordinary purposes very well. Illustrations are here introduced of a few simple contrivances that may be useful for general exercises, and are specially suitable for persons with _weak spines_, or with spines that are the subject of lateral curvature.  26. One of the simplest appliances for strengthening the muscles of the spine, designed chiefly to exercise the muscles on either side of the spine, consists of two wooden handles attached to india-rubber cords, one of which is attached to a hook made fast in the ceiling, or in the top of the door-case; and the other to another hook fastened in the wall, door-post, or window-casing, about the height {35} of the shoulder. When traction is made with the left hand, it exercises the muscles on the left side of the spine, while those on the opposite side are left almost at rest, owing to the oblique direction given to the shoulders when the right hand grasps the horizontal cord. (This appliance will be understood by referring to Fig. 13.)  [Illustration: FIG. 11.]  [Illustration: FIG. 12.]  {36}  27. Fig. 11 shows an appliance consisting of two strong elastic cords, with handles, secured to a hook in the floor, so arranged that the patient has to stoop forward to reach them. On raising the body the spinal muscles are powerfully exercised. Fig. 12 shows other modes of using the elastic cords for strengthening the spine and chest.  [Illustration: FIG. 13.]  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],["title","A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#5)"],["body","28. These various appliances have been combined so as to form a system of gymnastics suitable for parlor use; other appliances have been added by which the muscles of {37} the legs may be called into action as well as those of the spine and upper part of the body (Fig. 13). Combinations of cords suitable for particular cases may also be made, and by using one or several cords on the same hook, their power may be adapted to the strength of the most robust as well as to that of the invalid, or of the most delicate child. The entire apparatus is quite simple in its construction and inexpensive, requiring but little space, and at the same time affording a great variety of exercises.  EXERCISES THAT MAY BE PRACTISED ON THIS APPARATUS.      EXERCISE I. (Fig. 13).--Stand erect under the cords and place the heels     together. Grasp the handles firmly, keeping the knees and elbows stiff,     and pull downward and forward until the fingers nearly touch the toes.     Return slowly to the erect position. Repeat.      EXERCISE II. (Fig. 13).--Stand erect, and having grasped the handles     overhead firmly, separate them and bring them down slowly until they     touch the sides: then return them slowly to the original position.     Repeat.      EXERCISE III. (Fig. 13).--Stand erect, heels together, grasp the     handles overhead, and charge forward with the right foot. Return to     first position, and then charge with the left. Repeat, using the right     and left foot alternately.      EXERCISE IV. (Fig. 13).--Stand erect, heels together. Grasp the handle     overhead, and charge forward with the right foot, knee bent. Remain in     this position and bring the arms down to the sides so that the arm and     fore-arm may form a right angle. Still holding the handles, thrust     forward, first the right hand and then the left, until the arm is     straight. Repeat. Return to first position, then charge forward with     the left foot, performing the same movements as before.      EXERCISE V. (Fig. 13).--In this exercise we change to the pulleys     leading from the side posts, which can be used in several different     ways. 1st. Stand erect, heels together, facing one of the posts, grasp     the handle with the right hand, the arm being extended, then flex the     fore-arm on the arm. Repeat. Perform the same movements with the left     hand. 2d. Stand with back to the post; grasp the pulley behind with the     right hand, then gradually bring the hand forward until it is extended     in a straight line in front. Repeat. Perform the same exercise with the     left hand.      {38} EXERCISE VI. (Fig. 13).--This exercise is especially adapted to     the legs. Stirrups are so arranged that they can be attached to the     pulleys overhead, and can hang down to within three or four feet of the     floor. Place the foot in the stirrup, and then press down until it     touches the floor. Repeat. Exercise the left foot in the same way.      EXERCISE VII. (Fig. 13.)--This exercise requires a little attention in     the adjustment of the apparatus. Under the pulleys in the floor are     passed ropes which can be attached to the snap-hooks that hold the     handles overhead. Stoop forward with the knees stiff, and take hold of     the handles, and then raise the body to the erect position. Repeat.      EXERCISE VIII. (Fig. 13).--Sit on the floor or on a seat three or four     inches high; bend forward, take hold of the handles, and perform the     same movements that you would in rowing a boat.      EXERCISE IX. (Fig. 13).--The trapeze can now be let down; take hold of     it with both hands, sustaining the weight of the body with the arms,     then rotate the body first from right to left, then from left to right     alternately. This exercise is especially suitable for females.      EXERCISE X. (Fig. 13).--Grasp the trapeze as before, bearing all the     weight with the arms: then draw the body up slowly until you can place     the chin over the bars. This requires strength of muscle, and might     strain if done too violently; if slowly performed there is no danger.      These are but a few of the exercises that can be practised with this     apparatus. As these become familiar they can easily be modified, and     new ones can be arranged to meet the requirements of particular cases.     Most of the exercises described can be practised with one hand so as to     strengthen the muscles on one side.  [Sidenote: 29. Need of repose? How do we obtain rest? Alfred the Great? The eight-hour division of time?]  29. REST.--We cannot always be active: repose must succeed labor. We obtain this rest partly by suspending all exertion, as in sleep, and partly by a change of employment. It is said that Alfred the Great recommended that each day should be divided in the following manner: \"Eight hours for work, eight hours for recreation, and eight hours for sleep.\" This division of time is as good as any that could now be made, if it be borne in mind that, when the work is physical, the time of recreation should {39} be devoted to the improvement of the mind; and when mental, we should then recreate by means of physical exercise.  [Sidenote: 30. Cessation of voluntary activity? Temperature of the body? Consequence? Body and mind during sleep? Nutrition? Describe it. Consequences of insufficient sleep?]  30. During sleep, all voluntary activity ceases, the rapidity of the circulation and breathing diminishes, and the temperature of the body falls one or two degrees. In consequence, the body needs warmer coverings than during the hours of wakefulness. During sleep, the body seems wholly at rest, and the mind is also inactive, if we except those involuntary mental wanderings which we call dreams. Nevertheless a very active and important physical process is going on. Nutrition, or the nourishing of the tissues, now takes place. While the body is in action, the process of pulling down predominates, but in sleep, that of building up takes place more actively. In this way we are refreshed each night, and prepared for the work and pleasures of another day. If sleep is insufficient, the effects are seen in the lassitude and weakness which follow. Wakefulness is very frequently the forerunner of insanity, especially among those who perform excessive mental labor.  [Sidenote: 31. Amount of sleep in different persons? Cases? Frederick the Great? Bonaparte? Instances of long deprivation of sleep?]  31. All persons do not require the same amount of sleep, but the average of men need from seven to nine hours. There are well-authenticated cases where individuals have remained without sleep for many days without apparent injury. Frederick the Great required only five hours of sleep daily. Bonaparte could pass days with only a few hours of rest. But this long continued absence of sleep is attended with danger. After loss of sleep for a long period, in some instances, stupor has come on so profoundly, that there has been no awaking.  [Sidenote: 32. Instances of sailors? French soldiers? During torture?]  32. There are instances related of sailors falling asleep {40} on the gun-decks of their ships while in action. On the retreat from Moscow, the French soldiers would fall asleep on the march, and could only be aroused by the cry, \"The Cossacks are coming!\" Tortured persons are said to have slept upon the rack in the intervals of their torture. In early life, while engaged in a laborious country practice, the writer not unfrequently slept soundly on horseback. These instances, and others, show the imperative demand which nature makes for rest in sleep.  QUESTIONS FOR TOPICAL REVIEW.
