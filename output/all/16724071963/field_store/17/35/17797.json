There was conversation in the carriage and I learned certain details. One said that there would be an accident some day, and so forth. In a flash--as by an inspiration--I saw how the circumstance might be turned to account. A bad accident and the shares would certainly fall and my position would be retrieved. I think Mr Carrados has somehow learned the rest.\"  \"Max,\" said Mr Carlyle, with emotion, \"is there any reason why you should not send your man for a police officer and have this monster arrested on his own confession without further delay?\"  \"Pray do so, Mr Carrados,\" acquiesced Drishna. \"I shall certainly be hanged, but the speech I shall prepare will ring from one end of India to the other; my memory will be venerated as that of a martyr; and the emancipation of my motherland will be hastened by my sacrifice.\"  \"In other words,\" commented Carrados, \"there will be disturbances at half-a-dozen disaffected places, a few unfortunate police will be clubbed to death, and possibly worse things may happen. That does not suit us, Mr Drishna.\"  \"And how do you propose to prevent it?\" asked Drishna, with cool assurance.  \"It is very unpleasant being hanged on a dark winter morning; very cold, very friendless, very inhuman. The long trial, the solitude and the confinement, the thoughts of the long sleepless night before, the hangman and the pinioning and the noosing of the rope, are apt to prey on the imagination. Only a very stupid man can take hanging easily.\"  \"What do you want me to do instead, Mr Carrados?\" asked Drishna shrewdly.  Carrados's hand closed on the weapon that still lay on the table between them. Without a word he pushed it across.  \"I see,\" commented Drishna, with a short laugh and a gleaming eye. \"Shoot myself and hush it up to suit your purpose. Withhold my message to save the exposures of a trial, and keep the flame from the torch of insurrectionary freedom.\"  \"Also,\" interposed Carrados mildly, \"to save your worthy people a good deal of shame, and to save the lady who is nameless the unpleasant necessity of relinquishing the house and the income which you have just settled on her. She certainly would not then venerate your memory.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"The transaction which you carried through was based on a felony and could not be upheld. The firm you dealt with will go to the courts, and the money, being directly traceable, will be held forfeit as no good consideration passed.\"  \"Max!\" cried Mr Carlyle hotly, \"you are not going to let this scoundrel cheat the gallows after all?\"  \"The best use you can make of the gallows is to cheat it, Louis,\" replied Carrados. \"Have you ever reflected what human beings will think of us a hundred years hence?\"  \"Oh, of course I'm not really in favour of hanging,\" admitted Mr Carlyle.  \"Nobody really is. But we go on hanging. Mr Drishna is a dangerous animal who for the sake of pacific animals must cease to exist. Let his barbarous exploit pass into oblivion with him. The disadvantages of spreading it broadcast immeasurably outweigh the benefits.\"  \"I have considered,\" announced Drishna. \"I will do as you wish.\"  \"Very well,\" said Carrados. \"Here is some plain notepaper. You had better write a letter to someone saying that the financial difficulties in which you are involved make life unbearable.\"  \"But there are no financial difficulties--now.\"  \"That does not matter in the least. It will be put down to an hallucination and taken as showing the state of your mind.\"  \"But what guarantee have we that he will not escape?\" whispered Mr Carlyle.  \"He cannot escape,\" replied Carrados tranquilly. \"His identity is too clear.\"  \"I have no intention of trying to escape,\" put in Drishna, as he wrote. \"You hardly imagine that I have not considered this eventuality, do you?\"  \"All the same,\" murmured the ex-lawyer, \"I should like to have a jury behind me. It is one thing to execute a man morally; it is another to do it almost literally.\"  \"Is that all right?\" asked Drishna, passing across the letter he had written.  Carrados smiled at this tribute to his perception.  \"Quite excellent,\" he replied courteously. \"There is a train at nine-forty. Will that suit you?\"  Drishna nodded and stood up. Mr Carlyle had a very uneasy feeling that he ought to do something but could not suggest to himself what.  The next moment he heard his friend heartily thanking the visitor for the assistance he had been in the matter of the Indo-Scythian inscription, as they walked across the hall together. Then a door closed.  \"I believe that there is something positively uncanny about Max at times,\" murmured the perturbed gentleman to himself.     THE TRAGEDY AT BROOKBEND COTTAGE   \"Max,\" said Mr Carlyle, when Parkinson had closed the door behind him, \"this is Lieutenant Hollyer, whom you consented to see.\"  \"To hear,\" corrected Carrados, smiling straight into the healthy and rather embarrassed face of the stranger before him. \"Mr Hollyer knows of my disability?\"  \"Mr Carlyle told me,\" said the young man, \"but, as a matter of fact, I had heard of you before, Mr Carrados, from one of our men. It was in connexion with the foundering of the _Ivan Saratov_.\"  Carrados wagged his head in good-humoured resignation.  \"And the owners were sworn to inviolable secrecy!\" he exclaimed. \"Well, it is inevitable, I suppose. Not another scuttling case, Mr Hollyer?\"  \"No, mine is quite a private matter,\" replied the lieutenant. \"My sister, Mrs Creake--but Mr Carlyle would tell you better than I can. He knows all about it.\"  \"No, no; Carlyle is a professional. Let me have it in the rough, Mr Hollyer. My ears are my eyes, you know.\"  \"Very well, sir. I can tell you what there is to tell, right enough, but I feel that when all's said and done it must sound very little to another, although it seems important enough to me.\"  \"We have occasionally found trifles of significance ourselves,\" said Carrados encouragingly. \"Don't let that deter you.\"  This was the essence of Lieutenant Hollyer's narrative:  \"I have a sister, Millicent, who is married to a man called Creake. She is about twenty-eight now and he is at least fifteen years older. Neither my mother (who has since died), nor I, cared very much about Creake. We had nothing particular against him, except, perhaps, the moderate disparity of age, but none of us appeared to have anything in common. He was a dark, taciturn man, and his moody silence froze up conversation. As a result, of course, we didn't see much of each other.\"  \"This, you must understand, was four or five years ago, Max,\" interposed Mr Carlyle officiously.  Carrados maintained an uncompromising silence. Mr Carlyle blew his nose and contrived to impart a hurt significance into the operation. Then Lieutenant Hollyer continued:  \"Millicent married Creake after a very short engagement. It was a frightfully subdued wedding--more like a funeral to me. The man professed to have no relations and apparently he had scarcely any friends or business acquaintances. He was an agent for something or other and had an office off Holborn. I suppose he made a living out of it then, although we knew practically nothing of his private affairs, but I gather that it has been going down since, and I suspect that for the past few years they have been getting along almost entirely on Millicent's little income. You would like the particulars of that?\"  \"Please,\" assented Carrados.  \"When our father died about seven years ago, he left three thousand pounds. It was invested in Canadian stock and brought in a little over a hundred a year. By his will my mother was to have the income of that for life and on her death it was to pass to Millicent, subject to the payment of a lump sum of five hundred pounds to me. But my father privately suggested to me that if I should have no particular use for the money at the time, he would propose my letting Millicent have the income of it until I did want it, as she would not be particularly well off. You see, Mr Carrados, a great deal more had been spent on my education and advancement than on her; I had my pay, and, of course, I could look out for myself better than a girl could.\"  \"Quite so,\" agreed Carrados.  \"Therefore I did nothing about that,\" continued the lieutenant. \"Three years ago I was over again but I did not see much of them. They were living in lodgings. That was the only time since the marriage that I have seen them until last week. In the meanwhile our mother had died and Millicent had been receiving her income. She wrote me several letters at the time. Otherwise we did not correspond much, but about a year ago she sent me their new address--Brookbend Cottage, Mulling Common--a house that they had taken. When I got two months' leave I invited myself there as a matter of course, fully expecting to stay most of my time with them, but I made an excuse to get away after a week. The place was dismal and unendurable, the whole life and atmosphere indescribably depressing.\" He looked round with an instinct of caution, leaned forward earnestly, and dropped his voice. \"Mr Carrados, it is my absolute conviction that Creake is only waiting for a favourable opportunity to murder Millicent.\"  \"Go on,\" said Carrados quietly. \"A week of the depressing surroundings of Brookbend Cottage would not alone convince you of that, Mr Hollyer.\"  \"I am not so sure,\" declared Hollyer doubtfully. \"There was a feeling of suspicion and--before me--polite hatred that would have gone a good way towards it. All the same there _was_ something more definite. Millicent told me this the day after I went there. There is no doubt that a few months ago Creake deliberately planned to poison her with some weed-killer. She told me the circumstances in a rather distressed moment, but afterwards she refused to speak of it again--even weakly denied it--and, as a matter of fact, it was with the greatest difficulty that I could get her at any time to talk about her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34733"],["title","Hymni ecclesiae (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images generously made available by The Internet Archive/Canadian Libraries)                                        HYMNI ECCLESIAE                                     _PARS I_                          E BREVIARIO PARISIENSI                                     _PARS II_                               E BREVIARIIS                     ROMANO, SARISBURIENSI, EBORACENSI                                ET ALIUNDE                                    Londini                                   APUD                           ALEXANDRUM MACMILLAN                                   1865                                   OXONII                                EXCUDEBANT           T.

PARS I.                          E BREVIARIO PARISIENSI.                                     PREFACE.   Of the three kinds of poetical composition which, in accordance with the Apostle's direction, have ever been in use in the Church, \"Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual Songs,\" two are supplied by inspiration. We have no need, through God's bounty, to turn our thoughts to the composition of Psalms or Songs; and, to judge from the attempts which have been made, doubtless we are unequal to it. And the unapproachable excellence of the two which have been supplied serves to suggest the difficulties which beset the composition of the third which has not been supplied. Indeed, it is hardly too strong to say that to write Hymns is as much beyond us as to originate Psalmody. The peculiarity of the Psalms is their coming nearer than any other kind of devotion to a converse with the powers of the unseen world. They are longer and freer than Prayers; and, as being so, are less a direct address to the Throne of Grace than a sort of intercourse, first with oneself, then with one's brethren, then with Saints and Angels, nay, even the world and all creatures. They consist mainly of the praises of God; and the very nature of praise involves a certain abstinence from intimate approaches to Him, and the introduction of other beings into our thoughts, through whom our offering may come round to Him. For as He, and He only, is the direct object of prayer, so it is more becoming not to regard Him as directly addressed in praise, which would imply passing a judgment on Him who is above all scrutiny and all standards. The Seraphim cried _one to another_, \"Holy, Holy, Holy,\" veiling their faces, neither looking nor speaking to Him. The Psalms, then, as being praises and thanksgivings, are the language, the ordinary converse, as it may be called, of Saints and Angels in heaven; and, being such, could not be written except by men who had heard the \"unspeakable things\" which there are uttered. In this light they are more difficult than Prayers. Beggars can express their wants to a prince; they cannot converse like his courtiers.  Much the same remark may be made about the Songs or Canticles of the Church, which are also inspired, and are a kind of Psalms written for particular occasions, chiefly occasions of thanksgiving. Such are the two Songs of Moses, the Song of Hannah, those in Isaiah, the Song of Hezekiah, of Habakkuk, of the Three Children, of Zacharias, of the Blessed Virgin, and of Simeon, most of which are in the Breviary, and the last four are retained in our own Reformed Prayer Book.  Yet though Hymns, as being of a measured length, and restrained metrically, are so far safer to attempt than Psalms or Songs, they have their own peculiar difficulties. They are direct addresses to Almighty God, which ever must be most difficult to the serious mind, whatever be the difficulty of other devotions. This, in the instance of Prayers, has led to the use of Sentences, such as occur in our own Services; which, besides the advantage of extreme brevity, for the most part admit of being taken from Scripture. It has led also to the repetition of the Lord's Prayer, and of the _Kyrie Eleison_; and, again, to the use of Collects, which lessen the difficulty of addressing God by subjecting it to fixed rules. Hence our best Family Prayers are what may be called a succession of Sentences strung together, the simple and concise expression of our humiliation, fear, hope, and desire, for ourselves and others. Long Public Prayers, to make a general assertion which of course admits of exceptions, are arrogant and irreverent; hence the Pharisees made them.  Hence, too, the unchastised effusions which abound in the present day among those who have left the Church or lost her spirit. The great Eucharistic Prayer is nearly the only long prayer in the Catholic Church; and there is every reason to suppose that in its substance it proceeds from inspired authorities. In our own Service it has been separated by our Reformers into three distinct portions.  Hymns, however, being of the nature of praises, cannot be altogether brought down to that grave and severe character which, as being direct addresses to God, they seem to require; and this is their peculiar difficulty. To praise God specially for Redemption, to contemplate the mysteries of the Divine Nature, to enlarge upon the details of the Economy of Grace and yet not to offend, to invoke with awe, to express affection with a pure heart, to be subdued and sober while we rejoice, and to make professions without display, and all this not under the veil of figurative language, as in the Psalms, but plainly, and (as it were) abruptly, surely requires to have had one's lips touched with a \"coal from the Altar,\" to have caught from heaven that \"new song\" \"which no man could learn, but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth\"--the virgin followers of the Lamb.  Our Church, with the remarkable caution which she displays so often, has not attempted it. She has received the Psalms and Songs from Scripture; and, rejecting the Roman Hymns, has substituted in their stead, not others, but a metrical version of the Psalms. This abstinence has led on the one hand to some of her members on their own responsibility supplying the deficiency, and has incurred the complaint of others, who argued that she ought to have taken on herself what, being right in itself, will certainly be done by private hands, if not by the fitting authority. But, in truth, when it was necessary for her to abandon those she had received, nothing was left to her but to wait till she should receive others, as in the course of ages she had already received, by little and little.  The Roman Hymns, whether good or bad, were the work of no one generation, much less the outpourings of one mind. They were not the contents of one collection, published all new in a day according to the will of man. They were the gradual accumulations of centuries, bearing in old and new upon one treasure-house. When there was a call to reject them, there was nothing to be done but begin again. We could not be young and old at once. It was a stern necessity alone which could compel us to change from what we were; but being changed, so far we were not what we were, and must be what the primitive Church was in these respects, poor and ill-furnished. We began the world again. This is the proper answer to inconsiderate complaints and impatient interference. There have before now been divines who could write a Liturgy in thirty-six hours. Such is not our Church's way. She is not the empiric to make things to order, and to profess to anticipate the course of nature, which, under grace, as under Providence, is slow. She waits for that majestic course to perfect in its own good time, what she cannot extort from it; for the gradual drifting of precious things upon her shore, now one and now another, out of which she may complete her rosary and enrich her beads,--beads and rosary more pure and true than those which at the command of duty she flung away.  As far as we know, the public Hymns of the early Church were not much more than the following. First, starting from Scripture, she adopted the repetition of the _Hallelujah_, which is described by St. John, in the Revelations, to be the chant of the blessed inhabitants of heaven. Next may be mentioned the _Gloria Patri_, pretty much as we now use it. Thirdly, the _Trisagion_, or \"Holy, Holy, Holy,\" from Isaiah vi.; or, as it was also used, and now is, in the Roman Church, \"Sanctus Deus, Sanctus Fortis, Sanctus Immortalis.\" Besides these, there was the Morning or Angelic Hymn, beginning with the words used by the Angels at the nativity; and for the evening the Hymn beginning \"Hail gladdening Light,\" preserved by St. Basil. These are not metrical, as they were afterwards; nor are two others of a later date, which we still retain, the _Te Deum_ and the _Athanasian Creed_. They are both of Gallican origin, though the former has been ascribed to St. Ambrose. Others, however, now extant, are certainly his; others are the compositions of St. Hilary, Prudentius, St. Gregory, and later saints. It is not too much to say then that, judging by what we know of the Hymns of the primitive Church, we should not be dissatisfied with the paucity of those which custom has, with a sort of tacit authority, introduced among us in the course of several centuries.  More, doubtless, might be selected from the writings of our sacred Poets; but since, from unhappy circumstances, such a work does not seem likely at the present day, thoughtful minds naturally revert to the discarded collections of the ante-reform era, discarded because of associations with which they were then viewed, and of the interpolations by which they were disfigured; but which, when purified from these, are far more profitable to the Christian than the light and wanton effusions which are their present substitute among us. Nay, even"]]]
