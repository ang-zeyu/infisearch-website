If he lost an ounce, gravity wouldn't have no effect on him.\"  \"You don't have to bulge out to be a man,\" says the Missus. \"He's smart and he's rich and he's a swell dresser and I don't think we could find a better match for Bess.\"  \"Match just describes him,\" says I.  \"You're too cute to live,\" says the Wife. \"But no matter what you say, him and Bess is goin' to hit it off. They're just suited to each other. They're a ideal pair.\"  \"You win that argument,\" I says. \"They're a pair all right, and they'd make a great hand if you was playin' deuces wild.\"  Well, we walked round till our feet was froze and then we went home, and Bishop says he would have to go, but the Missus ast him to stay to supper, and when he made the remark about havin' to go, he was referrin' to one o'clock the next mornin'. And right after supper I was gave the choice o' takin' another walk or hittin' the hay.  \"Why don't we play cards?\" I says.  \"It's Sunday,\" says the Missus.  \"Has the mayor stopped that, too?\" I says.  But she winked at me again, the old flirt, so I stuck round the kitchen till it was pretty near time to wipe the dishes, and then I went to bed.  Monday noon I chased over to the Auditorium and they was only about eighty in line ahead o' me, and I was hopin' the house would be sold out for a week before I got up to the window. While I was markin' time I looked at the pitchers o' the different actors, hung up on the posts to advertise some kind o' hair tonic. I wisht I had Bishop along to tell me what the different names meant in English. I suppose most o' them meant Goatee or Spinach or Brush or Hedge or Thicket or somethin'. Then they was the girls' pitchers, too; Genevieve Farr'r that died in the Stockyards scene in _Carmen_, and Fanny Alda that took the part o' the Michaels girl from Janesville, and Mary Gardner, and Louise Edviney that was goin' to warble for us, and a lot more of all ages and one size.  Finally I got up to the ticket agent's cage and then I didn't only have to wait till the three women behind me done their shoppin', and then I hauled out my two tickets and ast the agent what would he give me for them.  \"Do you want to exchange them?\" he says.  \"I did,\" says I, \"but I heard you was sold out for to-morrow night.\"  \"Oh, no,\" he says \"we got plenty o' seats.\"  \"But nothin' down-stairs, is they?\" I says.  \"Yes,\" he says \"anywheres you want.\"  \"Well,\" I says, \"if you're sure you can spare them I want four in the place o' these two.\"  \"Here's four nice ones in the seventh row,\" says he. \"It'll be ten dollars more.\"  \"I ain't partic'lar to have them nice,\" I says.  \"It don't make no difference,\" says he. \"The whole down-stairs is five a wallop.\"  \"Yes,\" I says, \"but one o' the four that's goin' is a little skinny fella and another's a refuge from Wabash.\"  \"I don't care if they're all escapades from Milford Junction,\" he says. \"We ain't runnin' no Hoosier Welfare League.\"  \"You're smart, ain't you?\" I says.  \"I got to be,\" says the agent.  \"But if you was a little smarter you'd be this side o' the cage instead o' that side,\" says I.  \"Do you want these tickets or don't you?\" he says.  So I seen he didn't care for no more verbal collisions with me, so I give him the two tickets and a bonus o' ten bucks and he give me back four pasteboards and throwed in a envelope free for nothin'.  I passed up lunch Tuesday because I wanted to get home early and have plenty o' time to dress. That was the idear and it worked out every bit as successful as the Peace Ship. In the first place, I couldn't get in my room because that's where the Missus and Bess was makin' up. In the second place, I didn't need to of allowed any time for supper because there wasn't none. The Wife said her and Bessie'd been so busy with their clo'es that they'd forgot a little thing like supper.  \"But I didn't have no lunch,\" I says.  \"That ain't my fault,\" says the Missus. \"Besides, we can all go somewheres and eat after the show.\"  \"On who?\" I says.  \"You're givin' the party,\" says she.  \"The invitations didn't contain no clause about the inner man,\" says I. \"Furthermore, if I had the ten dollars back that I spent to-day for tickets, I'd have eleven dollars altogether.\"  \"Well,\" says the Missus, \"maybe Mr. Bishop will have the hunch.\"  \"He will if his hearin' 's good,\" says I.  Bishop showed up at six-thirty, lookin' mighty cute in his waiter uniform. After he'd came, it didn't take Bess long to finish her toilet. I'd like to fell over when I seen her. Some doll she was, too, in a fifty-meg evenin' dress marked down to thirty-seven. I know, because I had helped pick it out for the Missus.  \"My, you look sweet!\" says Bishop. \"That's a beautiful gown.\"  \"It's my favoright,\" says Bessie.  \"It don't take a person long to get attached to a pretty dress,\" I says.  The Missus hollered for me to come in and help her.  \"I don't need no help,\" she says, \"but I didn't want you givin' no secrets away.\"  \"What are you goin' to wear?\" says I.  \"Bess had one that just fits me,\" she says. \"She's loanin' it to me.\"  \"Her middle name's Generous,\" I says.  \"Don't be sarcastical,\" says the Missus. \"I want sis to look her best this oncet.\"  \"And I suppose it don't make no difference how you look,\" says I, \"as long as you only got me to please. If Bishop's friends sees him with Bessie they'll say: 'My! he's copped out a big-leaguer.' But if I run into any o' my pals they'll think I married the hired girl.\"  \"You should worry,\" says the Missus.  \"And besides that,\" I says, \"if you succeed in tyin' Bishop up to a long-term lease he's bound to see that there dress on you some time and then what'll he think?\"  \"Bess can keep the gown,\" says the Missus. \"I'll make her give me one of her'n for it.\"  \"With your tradin' ability,\" I says, \"you'd ought to be the Cincinnati Reds' manager. But if you do give the dress to her,\" I says, \"warn her not to wear it in Wabash--except when the marshal's over on the other street.\"  Well, we was ready in a few minutes, because I'm gettin' used to the soup and fish, and everything went on easy owin' to my vacuum, and I was too weak to shave; and the Missus didn't have no trouble with Bessie's creation, which was built like the Cottage Grove cars, enter at front.  \"I don't think I'm so bad,\" says the Missus, lookin' in the glass.  \"You'd be just right,\" I says, \"if we was goin' to the annual meetin' o' the Woman's Guild.\"  I and Bishop had a race gettin' on the street-car. I was first and he won.  \"I just got paid to-day,\" he says, \"and I didn't have time to get change.\"  They wasn't only one seat. Bess took it first and then offered it to the Missus.  \"I'll be mad at you if you don't take it,\" says Bess.  But the wife remained standin' and Bessie by a great effort kept her temper.  Goin' into the theayter we passed a fella that was sellin' liberettos.  \"I bet this guy's got lots o' change,\" I says.  \"Them things is for people that ain't never saw no op'ra,\" says Bishop.  \"I'm goin' to have one,\" I says.  \"Don't buy none for me,\" says Bishop.  \"You just spoke in time,\" I says.  I laid down a quarter and grabbed one o' the books.  \"It's thirty-five cents,\" says the guy.  \"_Carmen_ wasn't only a quarter,\" I says. \"Is this show better'n _Carmen_?\"  \"This is a new one,\" the guy says.  \"This fella,\" I says, pointin' to Bishop, \"seen it a year ago.\"  \"He must have a good imagination,\" says the guy.  \"No,\" I says, \"he writes movin'-pitcher plays.\"  I give up a extra dime, because they didn't seem to be nothin' else to do. Then I handed over my tickets to the fella at the door and we was took right down amongst the high polloi. Say, I thought the dress Bess was wearin' was low; ought to been, seein' it was cut down from fifty bucks to thirty-seven. But the rest o' the gowns round us must of been sixty per cent. off.  I says to the Missus:  \"I bet you wisht now you hadn't swapped costumes.\"  \"Oh, I don't know,\" she says. \"It's chilly in here.\"  Well, it may of been chilly then, but not after the op'ra got goin' good. Carmen was a human refrigerator compared to the leadin' lady in this show. Set through two acts and you couldn't hardly believe it was December.  But the curtain was supposed to go up at eight-ten, and it wasn't only about that time when we got there, so they was over half a hour to kill before the show begin. I looked in my program and seen the real translation o' the title. _The Love o' Three Kings_, it says, and no \"of God\" to it. I'd of knew anyway, when I'd read the plot, that He didn't have nothin' to do with it.  I listened a w'ile to Bishop and Bess.  \"And you've saw all the op'ras?\" she ast him.  \"Most o' them,\" he says.  \"How grand!\" says Bessie. \"I wisht I could see a lot o' them.\"  \"Well,\" he says, \"you're goin' to be here for some time.\"  \"Oh, Mr. Bishop, I don't want you throwin' all your money away on me,\" she says.  \"I don't call it throwin' money away,\" says Bishop.  \"I wouldn't neither,\" I says. \"I'd say Bishop was muscle-bound.\"  They didn't pay no attention to me.  \"What ones would you like to see?\" he ast her.  \"What are your favorights?\" says Bess.  \"Oh,\" says Bishop, \"I've saw them all so many times that it don't really make no difference to me. Sometimes they give two the same night, two short ones, and then you ain't so liable to get bored.\"  Saturday nights is when they usually give the two, and Saturday nights they cut the prices. This here Bishop wasn't no boob.  \"One good combination,\" he says, \"is _Polly Archer_ and _Cavalier Rusticana_. They're both awful pretty.\"  \"Oh, I'd love to see them,\" says Bessie. \"What are they like?\"  So he says Polly Archer was a leadin'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35162"],["title","Gullible's Travels, Etc. (#6)"],["body"," lady in a stock company and the leadin' man and another fella was both stuck on her and she loved one o' them--I forget which one; whichever wasn't her husbun'--and they was a place in one o' their shows where the one that was her husbun' was supposed to get jealous and stab she and her lover, just actin', but, instead o' just pretendin', this one night he played a joke on them and done the stabbin' in earnest, and they was both killed. Well, that'd be a good one to see if you happened to be there the night he really kills them; otherwise, it sounds pretty tame. And Bishop also told her about _Cavalier Rusticana_ that means Rural Free Delivery in English, and I didn't get the plot only that the mail carrier flirts with one o' the farmers' wives and o' course the rube spears him with a pitchfork. The state's attorneys must of been on the jump all the w'ile in them days.  Finally the orchestra was all in their places and an old guy with a beard come out in front o' them.  \"That's the conductor,\" says Bishop.  \"He looks like he'd been a long time with the road,\" I says.  Then up went the curtain and the thermometer.         *       *       *       *       *  The scene's laid in Little Italy, but you can't see nothin' when it starts off because it's supposed to be just before mornin'. Pretty soon one o' the three kings comes in with a grouch. He's old and blind as a bat and he ain't slept good and he's sore at the conductor on account o' the train bein' a half-hour late, and the conductor's jealous of him because his beard's longer, and Archibald, that's the old king's name, won't sing what the orchestra's playin', but just snarls and growls, and the orchestra can't locate what key he's snarlin' in, so they don't get along at all, and finally Flamingo, that's the old king's chauffeur, steers him off'n the stage.  Acrost on the other side o' the stage from where they go off they's a bungalow, and out of it comes Flora and another o' the kings, a young fella with a tenor voice named Veto. They sing about what a fine mornin' it is in Wop and she tells him he'd better fly his kite before Archibald catches him.  It seems like she's married to Archibald's son, Fred, but o' course she likes Veto better or it wouldn't be no op'ra. Her and Veto was raised in the same ward and they was oncet engaged to be married, but Archibald's gang trimmed Veto's in a big roughhouse one night and Flora was part o' the spoils. When Archibald seen how good she could fix spaghett' he was bound she'd stick in the family, so he give her the choice o' bein' killed or marryin' his boy, so she took Fred but didn't really mean it in earnest. So Veto hangs round the house a lot, because old Archibald's blind and Fred's generally always on the road with the Erie section gang.  But old Archibald's eyes bein' no good, his ears is so much the better, even if he don't sometimes keep with the orchestra, so he comes back on the stage just after Veto's went and he hears Flora tryin' to snoop back in her bungalow.  \"Who was you talkin' to?\" he says.  \"Myself,\" says Flora.  \"Great stuff!\" says Archibald. \"Up and outdoors at five A.M. to talk to yourself! Feed that to the goldfish!\"  So she ain't got him fooled for a minute, but w'ile they're arguin' Fred blows in. So Archibald don't say nothin' about his superstition because he ain't sure, so Fred and his Missus goes in the bungalow to have breakfast and Archibald stays on the stage quarrelin' with the conductor.  If Fred was eatin' all through the intermission, he must of been as hungry as me, because it was plain forty minutes before the second act begin. Him and Flora comes out o' their house and Fred says he's got to go right away again because they's a bad wash-out this side o' Huntington. He ain't no sooner gone than Veto's back on the job, but Flora's kind o' sorry for her husbun', and Veto don't get the reception that a star ought to expect.  \"Why don't you smile at me?\" he says.  So she says:  \"It don't seem proper, dearie, with a husbun' on the Erie.\"  But before long she can't resist his high notes and the next five or ten minutes is a love scene between the two, and they was a couple o' times when I thought the management would ring down the asbestos curtain. Finally old Archibald snoops back on the stage with Flamingo, and Veto runs, but Archie hears him and it's good night. The old boy gives Flora the third degree and she owns up, and then Flamingo says that Fred's comin' back to get his dinner pail. So Archibald insists on knowin' the fella's name that he heard him runnin' away, but Flora's either forgot it or else she's stubborn, so Archie looses his temper and wrings her neck. So when Fred arrives he gets the su'prise of his life and finds out he's a widow.  \"I slayed her,\" says Archibald. \"She wasn't no good.\"  \"She was the best cook we ever had,\" says Fred. \"What was the matter with her?\"  \"She had a gentleman friend,\" says his old man.  Well, so far, they's only one dead and nothin' original about how it was pulled. You can go over to the Victoria and see any number o' throttlin's at fifty cents for the best seats. So it was up to the management to get a wallop into the last act. It took them pretty near forty minutes to think of it, but it was good when it come.  The scene is Colosimo's undertakin' rooms and Flora's ruins is laid out on the counter. All the Wops from her ward stand round singin' gospel hymns.  When they've beat it Veto approaches the bier bar and wastes some pretty fair singin' on the late Flora. Then all of a sudden he leans over and gives her a kiss. That's all for Veto. You see, Old Fox Archibald had figured that the bird that loved her would pull somethin' like this and he'd doped out a way to learn who he was and make him regret it at the same time, besides springin' some bran'-new stuff in the killin' line. So he's mixed up some rat poison and garlic and spread it on the lips of his fair daughter-in-law.  W'ile Veto's dyin' Fred comes in and finds him.  \"So it was you, was it?\" he says.  \"I'm the guy,\" says Veto.  \"Well,\" says Fred, \"this'll learn you a lesson, you old masher, you!\"  \"I'll mash you in a minute,\" says Veto, but the way he was now, he couldn't of mashed turnips.  \"I kissed her last, anyway,\" says Veto.  \"You think you did!\" says Fred, and helps himself to the garlic.  So Veto's dead and Fred's leanin' over the counter, dyin', when Archibald wabbles in. He finds his way up to Fred and grabs a hold of him, thinkin' it's the stranger.  \"Lay off'n me, pa,\" says Fred. \"This ain't the other bird. He's dead and it's got me, too.\"  \"Well,\" says the old man, \"that'd ought to satisfy them. But it's pretty tough on the Erie.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"How grand!\" says Bess when it was over.  \"But it leaves you with a bad taste,\" says Bishop.  \"And a big appetite,\" I says.  \"Did that old man kill them all?\" ast the Missus.  \"All but hisself and Flamingo,\" says I.  \"What was he mad at?\" says she.  \"He was drove crazy by hunger,\" I says. \"His wife and his sister-in-law and her fella was starvin' him to death.\"  \"Bein' blind, he prob'ly spilled things at table,\" says the Missus. \"Blind men sometimes has trouble gettin' their food.\"  \"The trouble ain't confined to the blind,\" says I.  When we got outside I left Bess and Bishop lead the way, hopin' they'd head to'rds a steak garage.  \"No hurry about gettin' home,\" I hollered to them. \"The night's still young yet.\"  Bishop turned round.  \"Is they any good eatin' places out by your place?\" he says.  I thought I had him.  \"Not as good as down-town,\" says I, and I named the Loop restaurants.  \"How's the car service after midnight?\" he says.  \"Grand!\" says I. \"All night long.\"  I wondered where he would take us. Him and Bess crossed the avenue and stopped where the crowd was waitin' for south-bound cars.  \"He's got some favorite place a ways south,\" says the Missus.  A car come and I and her clumb aboard. We looked back just in time to see Bessie and Bishop wavin' us farewell.  \"They missed the car,\" says the Missus.  \"Yes,\" I says, \"and they was just as anxious to catch it as if it'd been the leprosy.\"  \"Never mind,\" says the Missus. \"If he wants to be alone with her it's a good sign.\"  \"I can't eat a sign,\" says I.  \"We'll stop at The Ideal and have a little supper of our own,\" she says.  \"We won't,\" says I.  \"Why not?\" says the Missus.  \"Because,\" I says, \"they's exactly thirty-five cents in my pocket. And offerin' my stomach seventeen and a half cents' worth o' food now would be just about like sendin' one blank cartridge to the Russian army.\"  \"I think they's some crackers in the house,\" she says.  \"Prob'ly,\" says I. \"We're usually that way--overstocked. You don't seem to realize that our household goods is only insured for a thousand.\"         *       *       *       *       *  About one o'clock I went to sleep from sheer weakness. About one-thirty the Missus shook me and woke me up.  \"We win, Joe!\" she says, all excited. \"I think Bishop and Bess is engaged!\"  \"Win!\" says I. \"Say, if you was a Frenchman you'd have a big celebration every anniversary o' the Battle o' Waterloo.\"  \"I was goin' out in the kitchen to get a drink,\" she says. \"Bess was home, but I didn't know it. And when I was comin' back from the kitchen I happened to glance in the livin'-room. And I seen Bishop kiss her! Isn't it great!\"  \"Yes,\" I says. \"But I wisht she'd of had Archibald fix up her lips.\"     GULLIBLE'S TRAVELS   I  I promised the Wife that if anybody ast me what kind of a time did I have at Palm Beach I'd say I had a swell time.
