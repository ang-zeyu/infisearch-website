Then Mosey returned.  \"Grass up over yer boots, an' the carrion goin' into it lemons,\" he remarked. \"I do like to give this Runnymede the benefit o' the act. 'On't ole Martin be ropeable when he sees that fence!  Magomery's as hard as nails, his own self; but he ain't the class o' feller that watches from behine a tree--keeps curs like Martin to do his dirty work. But he'd like to nip every divil of us if he got half a slant.  I notice, the more swellisher a man is, the more miserabler he is about a bite o' grass for a team, or a feed for a traveller.  Magomery's got an edge on you, Thompson--you an' Cunningham--for workin' on Nosey Alf's horse-paddick, an' for leavin' some gates open.  Moriarty, the storekeeper, he told me about it.\"  \"Well, we did n't work on Alf's horse-paddock, and we did n't leave any gates open,\" replied Thompson.  \"We lost the steers from the ram-paddock, here, and we found them away in the Sedan paddock.  Certainly, we camped them all night in the Connelly paddock, but we never touched Alf's grass, and we left no gates open.\"  \"Chorus, boys!\"  said Mosey flippantly.  \"O, what a (adj.) lie!\" echoed Dixon, Bum, and the precentor himself. Thompson sighed; Cooper growled; and Willoughby coughed deprecatingly.  \"I don't blame ole Martin to have a bit of a nose on me,\" continued Mosey laughingly.  \"Lord! didn't I git the loan of him cheap las' summer! Me an' the ole man was comin' down from Karowra with the last o' the clip; an' these paddicks was as bare as the palm o' your hand; so we goes on past here, an' camps half-ways between the fur corner o' the ram-paddick an' the station gate; an' looses out about an hour after sundown. It was sort o' cloudy moonlight that night; an' I takes the carrion straight on, an' shoves 'em in the horse-paddick, an' shuts the gate. Then I fetches 'em into a sort of a holler, where the best grass was, an' I takes the saddle an' bridle off o' the horse, an' lays down, an' watches the carrion wirin' in.  Well, you know, ole Martin, the head boundary man, he's about as nice a varmin as Warrigal Alf; an' the young fellers at the barracks they 'on't corroborate with him, no road; an' he thinks his self a cut above the hut, so he lives with Daddy Montague, in Latham's ole place, down at the fur corner o' the horse-paddick.  Well, this ole beggar he's buckin' up to Miss King, the governess, an' Moriarty, the storekeeper, he's buckin' up to her too\"----  \"Clever feller, that Moriarty,\" interposed Price, in pathetic sycophancy. \"Rummest young (fellow) goin', when he likes to come out.  Ain't he, Mosey?\"  He paused and laughed heartily.  \"Las' time I unloaded at Runnymede--an' it was on'y one ton lebm; for we was goin' out emp'y for wool, on account o' them two Vic. chaps snappin' our loads. I disremember if I tole you the yarn when I pulled you at the Willandra. Anyhow it was raining like (incongruous comparison) when I drawed up at the store; an' Moriarty he fetches me inter the office, an' gives me a stiffener o' brandy.  Or whisky?  Now, (hair-raising imprecation) if I don't disremember which.  But I think it was brandy.  Yes, it was brandy.\"  \"Well?\" interrogated Mosey, after a pause.  \"On'y jist showin' how one idear sort o' fetches up another,\" replied the old man, with simulated ease of manner.  \"Well, you are a (adj.) fool.  But as I was telling you chaps: About eleven o'clock, who should come dodgin' down the paddick but ole Martin. Bin pokin' roun' after Miss King, I s'pose.  He walks right bang through the carrion, thinkin' they was the station bullicks; an' me layin' there, laughin' in to myself.  By-'n'-by he stops an' consithers, an' then he goes roun' examinin' them, an' smellin' about, an' then he has a long squint at Valiparaiser; an' in the heel o' the hunt he rounds up the lot, an' sails off to the yard with 'em; an' me follerin' ready to collar 'em when the coast was clear.  By-'n'-by I sees him leavin' the yard, an' I goes to it, an' lo an' behold you! there was a padlock on the gate as big as a sardine-box.\"  \" Well, we had a bunch o' keys at the camp.  I had snavelled 'em at the railway station, las' time we was at Deniliquin, thinkin' they might come in useful.  So I heads for the camp at the rate o' knots. Collars the keys, an' gits a drink o' tea, an' takes a bit o' brownie in my fist, an' back I goes, doin' the trip in about an hour.  Providential, one o' the keys fits the lock, so I whips out the carrion, an' shoves 'em down to where the ole sinner took 'em from.  Well, there was two station teams in the paddick--I s'pose they wanted 'em very early for somethin'-- so I saddles Valiparaiser an' scoots across to where I seen these bullicks when I was goin' for the keys; an' I shoves 'em into the yard; an' I rakes up a ole grey horse, lame o' four legs, an' shoves him in along o' the carrion, an' locks the gate, an' goes back to our lot, an' keeps an eye on 'em till they laid down, fit to bust.  Lord! how I laughed that night! I seen Martin watchin us nex' mornin', after we started. He's got a set on me for that, among other things.\"  \"Hasn't Warrigal Alf got a set on you too?\" asked Thompson coldly. \"Strikes me, you're not the safest man in the world to travel with.\"  \"Yes, Alf gives me the prayers o' the Church now an' agen,\" replied Mosey complacently.  \"It was this way:  The winter afore last, we got a leader in a swap at Deniliquin.  Same time I made the keys.  Yaller, hoop-horned bullick--I dunno if you seen him with us?  Well, this Pilot, you could n't pack him\"--Here Cooper slowly rose, and walked across to his wagon--\"Lazy mountain o' mullick, that.\"  \"Burden to his own self,\" assented Price obsequiously.  \"Thick-headed galoot, appearingly,\" suggested Bum.  \"Ought to be hunted back to the Sydney side,\" contributed Dixon.  ----\"You could n't pack him for a near side leader,\" resumed Mosey; \"but there was nothin' for it but shepherd all night.  You might bet yer soul agen five bob, Pilot was off.  Whenever he seen a fence, he'd go through it, an' whenever he seen a river, he'd swim it; an' the whole fraternity stringin' after, thinkin' he was on for somethin' worth while.  Grand leader, but a beggar to clear.  Well, las' year, when we went up emp'y to Bargoona-- same trip the ole man got that wonderful drink off Moriarty--who should we fine there but this Alf, waitin' for wool, an' due for the fust load. No fear o' him goin' up emp'y nyther.  He'd manage to collar six ton\"----  \"Don't mention that name if you can help it, Mosey,\" interrupted Cooper, as he returned to the group, carrying a blanket and the little bag of dead grass which he used as a pillow.  \"I'm a good-tempered man,\" he continued, in sullen apology; \"but it gives me the wilds and the melancholies, does that name.\"  \"Which?--Bargoona?\"  \"No; the other name.  You've got Nosey Alf, an' Warrigal Alf, an' (sheol) knows how many other Alfs.  I got reason to hate that name.\"  \"Well,\" resumed Mosey, after a pause, \"as I was tellin' you, this cove he was there; an' it so happened his near side leader had got bit with a snake, an' died; an' as luck would have it, he'd sold the pick of his bullicks to a tank-sinker, an' bought steers in theyre place; an' he had n't another bullick fit to shove in the near side lead to tackle sich a road as he'd got in front of him.  Well, this cove he makes fistfuls o' money, but he's always dog-poor, so he\"----  \"Which cove makes fistfuls o' money?\" demanded Price, roused from a reverie by the magic dissyllable.  \"Fine out, you (adj.) ole fool.  So he was flyblowed as usual in regard o' cash; an' he was badly in want of a near side leader; an' I kep' showin' off this Pilot, shifting wagons from the door o' the shed, an' tinkerin' about; an' he offered us two good bullicks for the counterfit; an' me an' the ole man we hum'd and ha'd, an' let on we did n't want to part with him; an' me as thin as a whippin'-post with watchin' the yaller-hided dodger every night, to keep him from goin' overland to the bounds o' creation.  Well, at long an' at last we swapped level for Valiparaiser.  I seen the workin' o' Providence in it from fust to last. The horse he's worth twenty notes, all out; an' Pilot he was dear at a gift. I say, Tom; that's a grand horse you got off o' the Far-downer. Goes like a greyhound.  Gosh, you had that bloke to rights. He's whippin' the cat now like fury.  I was chiackin' him about the deal, when he told me you swapped level; an' he wanted to change the subject. 'I'm frightened you'll be short o' grass to-night,' says he. 'Where you goin' to camp?' says he.  The (adj.) fool!\"  \"What did you tell him?\" asked Thompson.  \"Ram-paddick, of course.  You don't ketch me tellin' the truth about where I'm goin' to camp.  But you got a rakin' horse, Tom; an' I give you credit for gittin' at the blind side o' the turf-cutter.\"  \"He'll do me well enough for poking about,\" I replied modestly. \"But how did the other fellow get on with Pilot?\"  \"It was the fun o' the world,\" resumed Mosey.  \"The other feller he left the shed three days ahead of us; an' when we drawed out, an' camped at the Four-mile Tank, this feller's wagon was standin' there yet; an' no sign o' him nor his carrion.  I was thinkin' he'd have some fun with Pilot, 'specially on account of havin' to do his bullick-huntin' on foot; for he could n't afford to git another horse till he delivered. Well, I never seen him agen till to-day when we stopped for dinner; but the feller at the Bilby Well he told me about it when we was goin' back to Bargoona, nex' trip.\"  \"Seems, the other feller he goes out in the mornin' on foot, thinkin' to fine his carrion among that mulgar in the corner to yer left; an' when he got to the corner, there was a hole in the fence, an' the tracks through.  Course, he runs the tracks; he runs 'em all day, an' at night he lays down, an' I s'pose he swears his self to sleep. Nex' mornin', off he scoots agen, an'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3470"],["title","Such Is Life (#5)"],["body","before sundown he hears the bells, an' he pipes the tail end o' the string ahead; an' the front end was jist at the Bilby Well--sixty good mile, if it's an inch, an' scrub all the road.  Pilot he had n't thought worth while to go roun' by the Boundary Tank, to git on the wool track; he jist went ahead like a surveyor, an' the fences was like spiders' webs to him. It was blazing hot weather; and the other fellow he never seen tucker nor water all the trip, for he wouldn't leave the track.  Laugh? Lord!  I thought I'd 'a' busted when the bloke at the well told me. I noticed the other feller was a bit narked when he seen me on the horse to-day.  He's got red o' Pilot.\"  \"Look here, Mosey,\" said Thompson slowly:  \"I'd rather--so help me God-- I'd rather cut my own throat than do a trick like that. Are n't you frightened of bringing a curse on yourself?\"  \"I ain't (adj.) fool enough to believe in curses,\" replied Mosey-- his altered tone nevertheless belying his bravado.  \"Simply because you don't keep your eyes open,\" retorted Thompson. \"Is n't it well known that a grog-seller's money never gets to his children? Is n't it well known that if you mislead a woman, a curse'll follow you like your shadow?  Isn't it well known that if you're disobedient to your parents, something'll happen to you?  Is n't it well known that Sabbath-breaking brings a curse on a man that he can't shake off till he reforms?  Now you stole that horse in the dirtiest way; and stealing--well, anything except grass or water--brings as heavy a curse as anything you can do.  Mark my words.\"  \"The Jackdaw of Rheims is a case in point,\" remarked Willoughby aside to me.  \"Well,\" said Price emphatically, and qualifying every word that would bear qualification, \"so fur as workin' on Sundays goes, I'm well sure I allus worked on Sundays, an' I'm well sure I allus will; an' I'm well sure 'ere ain't no cuss on me.  Why, I dunno what the (complicated expletive) a cuss is! I'll get a blanket fer to lay on,\" he added; \"this ground's sorter damp.\" And he went across to his wagon.  \"He's got a curse on him as big as Mount Macedon, and he does n't know it,\" muttered Thompson.  \"Bearing out the prophecy,\" said I aside to Willoughby, \"that the sinner, being a hundred years old, shall be accursed.\"  \"You ought to show him a bit more respect, Mosey,\" remarked Cooper gravely.  \"Well, to tell you the truth,\" replied Mosey frankly, \"I got no patience with the ole bunyip.  Can't suffer fools, no road.\"  \"Well, I don't want to be shovin' in my jor, but I'd take him to be more rogue than fool,\" suggested Bum.  \"Time he was thinkin' about repentin', anyhow,\" observed Dixon.  \"Now, really Thompson--do you believe in these special malisons?\" asked Willoughby, as Price rejoined the company.  \"Are you so superstitious? I should n't have thought it.\"  \"I've good reason to believe in them,\" replied Thompson.  \"You asked me this morning why I did n't have two teams.  Now I'll tell you the reason. It's because I'm not allowed to keep two teams.  I've got a curse on me. Many a long year ago, when I finished my second season, I found myself at Moama, with a hundred and ten notes to the good, and the prospect of going straight ahead, like the cube root--or the square of the hypotenuse, is it?  I forget the exact term, but no matter.  Well, the curse came on me in this way:  Charley Webber, the young fellow I was travelling with, got a letter from some relations in New Zealand, advising him to settle there; so he offered me his plant for two-thirds of its value--fifty notes down and fifty more when he would send for it.  Sheer good-nature of him, for he knew he could have the lot if he liked.  But there's not many fellows of Charley's stamp.  So I paid him the fifty notes and we parted. He was to send me his address as soon as he reached New Zealand; but he never got there.  The vessel was wrecked on some place they call the North Spit; and Charley was one of the missing.  Never heard of him from that day to this.\"  \"Good (ensanguined) shot!\" remarked Mosey.  \"I wish that same specie of a curse would come on me.\"  \"My (ensanguined) colonial!\" assented Dixon and Bum, with one accord.  \"Well, nobody knows anything about the geography of New Zealand,\" continued Thompson, \"and I purposely forgot the address of Charley's people. Any honest man would have hunted them up, but that was n't my style; I was n't a wheat-sample; I was a tare.  Compromised with my conscience. Thought there was no time to lose in making an independence--making haste to be rich, and considering not that's there's many a slip between the cup and the lip, as Solomon puts it.  I said to myself, 'That's all right; I'll pay it some time.' Now see the consequence----\"  \"Just two years after I bid the poor fellow good-bye-two years to the very day, and not very lucky years neither--I found myself in the middle of the Death Track, with flour for Wilcannia; one wagon left behind, and the bullocks dropping off like fish out of water; bullocks worth ten notes going as if they were n't worth half-a-crown.  It was like the retreat from Moscow.  Finally, I lost fourteen on the trip--exactly the number I had got dishonestly.  As for the second wagon, I gave it to Baxter for fetching the load the last fifty mile.  I thought this might clear away the curse, so I didn't fret over it.  I felt as if Charley had got satisfaction.  But I wasn't going to get off so cheap. Two years afterward--you remember, Dixon?--I bought that thin team and the Melbourne wagon from Pribble, the contractor.  Dixon, here, was driving for Pribble at that very time, and he can tell you how Dick the Devil cleaned me out of my fine old picked team and the new wagon, leaving me to begin afresh with the remains of Pribble's skeletons and my own old wagon.  Then a year or two afterward, I went in debt to buy that plant of Mulligan's--him that was killed off the colt at Mossgiel-- and that same winter the pleuro broke out in my lot, and they went like rotten sheep till fourteen were gone; and then, of course, the plague was stopped.  Not having any use for Mulligan's wagon, I swapped her for a new thirty-by-twenty-four wool-rag, and a Wagga pot, good for eight or ten mile on a still night; and, within a month, Ramsay's punt went down with my wagon; she's in the bottom of the Murrumbidgee now, with eight ton of bricks to steady her, and the tarpaulin and bell to keep her company.  She'll be fetching the most critical planks out of a steamer some of these times, and I'll get seven years for leaving her there.  Afterward, when I was hauling logs for pontooning, on the Goulburn, I kept buying up steers and breaking them in, till I had two twelves; and one day I left sixteen of them standing in yoke while I went looking round for a good log; and suddenly I heard a crash that rattled back and forward across the river for a quarter of an hour.  I had a presentiment that Providence was on the job again, and I wasn't disappointed. One of the fallers had left a tree nearly through when he went to dinner; and a gust of wind sent it over, and it carried a couple of other trees before it, right on the spot where my team was folded up in the shade. Eight of them went that trip, between killed and crippled, leaving me with sixteen.  My next piece of luck was to lose that new Yankee wagon in the Eight-mile Mallee, on Birrawong. Then I could see plain enough that Providence had taken up Charley's case, and was prepared to block me of keeping two teams; so I determined to have one good one.  Now, I've always stood pretty well with the agents and squatters, and I know my way round Riverina, so I can turn over as much money as any single-team man on the track, bar Warrigal Alf (I beg your pardon, Cooper; I forgot)--but what's the use of money to me? Only vanity and vexation of spirit, as Shakespear says.  I get up to a certain point, and then I'm knocked stiff.  Mind, I've only given you a small, insignificant sample of the misfortunes I've had since I cheated that dead man; but if they don't prove there's a curse on me, then there's no such thing as proof in this world.\"  Price cleared his throat.  \"Them misforcunes was invidiously owin' to yer own (adj.) misjudgment,\" he said dogmatically.  \"Serve you right for not havin' better luck,\" added Dixon.  \"Learn you sense, anyhow,\" remarked Mosey.  \"Misforcunes does some people good,\" hazarded Bum.  \"Yes,\" replied Thompson gently.  \"I've had my turn.  I hope I take it like a man.  Your turns will come sooner or later, as sure as you've got heads on your bodies--perhaps next year; perhaps next week; perhaps to-morrow. Let's see how you'll take it.  Mind, there's a curse on every one of us. And look here--we had no business to travel to-day; there was a bite of feed in the Patagonia Swamp, if it came to the worst.  Now we're in for it. I've got a presentiment that something'll happen before to-morrow night. Just mark my words.\"  A constrained silence fell on the grown-up children, till Willoughby politely sought to restore ease by contributing his quota to the evening's feast of reason--  \"There occurs to my mind a capital thing,\" he said; \"a capital thing, indeed, though apropos of nothing in particular.  A student, returning from a stroll, encountered a countryman, carrying a hare in his hand.  'Friend,' said the student quietly, 'is that thine own hare or a wig?'  The joke, of course, lies in the play on the word 'hare'.\"  Willoughby's courteous effort was worse than wasted, for the general depression deepened.  \"You're right, Thompson,\" said Cooper, at length.  \"Mostly everybody's got a curse on them.  I got a curse on me.  I got it through swearin' and Sabbath-breakin'.  I've tried to knock off swearin' fifty dozen times, but I might as well try to fly.  Last time I tried to knock it off was when I left Nyngan for Kenilworth, four months ago; but there happened to be a two-hundredweight bag o' rice in the bottom o' the load;"]]]
