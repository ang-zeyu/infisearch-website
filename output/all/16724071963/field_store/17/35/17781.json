But the groundlessness of the supposition referred to is sufficiently shown by the fact that, in the passages above cited, and in many others, the several designations, Adonai, Adon, Jehovah, and Elohim, are employed conjointly in the same sentences, with reference to the same Person, and as of equivalent import as Divine designations.  The same Divine Person, the Messiah, the Administrator and Revealer, manifested himself to the inspired writers in various ways, and in different aspects of his person and relations: to their faith as the self-existent, omnipresent Jehovah; to their senses in his complex, official person, and delegated, covenant relations, the Messenger, visible in the likeness of man, Adonai, the Adon.  Thus Daniel, chap. x. 16, 17: \"One like the similitude of the sons of men _touched my lips_; then I opened my mouth and spake, and said unto him that _stood before me_, O Adonai!... how can the servant of this Adonai talk with this Adonai?\" And Amos, chap. vii., relates that he _saw the Adonai_ standing on a wall, with a plumb-line in his hand, and that the Adonai spoke to and was answered by him. The context shows that, though appearing visibly as a man, he exercised Divine prerogatives. Again, chap. ix. 1: \"I saw the Adonai _standing_ upon the altar.\" Afterwards he speaks as Jehovah, and, verse 16, utters the prediction, quoted Acts xv. 16, that, after the Gentile dispensation, \"I will return and will build again the tabernacle of David which is fallen down, ... and I will set it up.\"  In the first chapter of Zechariah the following Divine designations occur: Jehovah, Jehovah Zebaoth, Adonai, _the_ Melach, and Melach Jehovah. The Person locally present and visible, who in the 9th verse is called Adonai and _the_ Melach, in the 11th and 12th verses Melach Jehovah, and in the 13th, 14th, and 19th verses _the_ Melach, is in the 8th and 10th verses called a _man_. I saw by night and behold, a man ... among the myrtle trees, v. 8. And the _man_ that stood among the myrtle trees answered, v. 9. And they answered the Melach Jehovah that stood among the myrtle trees, v. 11.  But the prophet on seeing the man, v. 8, addresses him as Adonai. \"Then said I, O Adonai! what are these?\" And _the_ Melach answered, &c. v. 9. In the progress of the ensuing colloquy, the visible Person, in the form of man, _the_ Melach, the Melach who is Jehovah, speaks to and of Jehovah and Jehovah Zebaoth, as the Messiah did when visibly present incarnate in man's nature on earth; and an audible response was in like manner given. See v. 10, 12, 13.  Illustrations of the same usage might be adduced from almost every part of the Old Testament, where the Messiah, as announced by designations peculiar to his complex official Person and character, and as visibly present, speaks to and of himself and also to and of the Father, under designations which refer only to the Divine Nature. The same is customary likewise with the prophets. Thus David, Ps. cx.: \"Jehovah (the Father) saith to _Adonai_, (the Messiah, as is declared in the New Testament,) Sit thou at my right hand,\" &c. And Ps. ii.: Why do the heathen rage?... and the rulers take counsel against Jehovah and against the Anointed, or Messiah, v. 1, 2. The Adonai shall have them in derision, v. 4. I (the Messiah) will declare the decree: Jehovah hath said onto me, Thou art my Son, &c., v. 7.  The exceeding confusion which obscures our common version of Zechariah, and especially of the first chapter, implies that the translators did not understand the designations above quoted, a _man_, _the Melach_, _Melach Jehovah_, and _Adonai_, as referring to one and the same person, nor all or any of them as referring to the official Person, Messiah.  In chapter ii., _the_ Melach is the Divine speaker throughout: \"And behold _the_ Melach that talked with me (see i. 9) went forth, and another angel (a messenger) went out to meet him; and HE (_the_ Melach) said unto him, (_i. e._, to the messenger,) Run,\" &c. v. 3, 4. Here, according to our version, the other angel is made to direct the Melach who is Jehovah (see i. 9, 11, 12) to run, &c., by the omission of the relative HE, as printed in capitals above; which, it is obvious from the original, and also from the ensuing context, ought to be retained. For after directing the approaching messenger to run, &c., he proceeds: \"For I, saith Jehovah, will be unto her, Jerusalem, a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her:\" the reference of which is further evidence that the speaker is the Messiah, here designated _the Melach_ and _Jehovah_. The same speaker, continuing to the end of the chapter, treats of the dispersion, preservation, and subsequent restoration of the Israelites, and reÃ«stablishment of Jerusalem as his dwelling-place.  Throughout the remainder of the book, the Divine Person speaking to the prophet is the same as the man, the Melach, the Adonai, the Melach Jehovah, of the first chapter. He announces what is said by Jehovah, and Jehovah Zebaoth; his rebuke of Satan, iii. 2; his promise of THE BRANCH, referring to the Messiah as he was to be manifested incarnate, iii. 8, and vi. 12. In various places the prophet designates _the_ Melach, and Jehovah as his Adonai, and as the Adon of the whole earth, iv. 4, 5, 13, 14; vi. 4, 5; ix. 4. Adonai Jehovah, ix. 14, and Jehovah their Elohe, ix. 16, x. 6, declares that the _man_ whose name is THE BRANCH shall build the temple of Jehovah, and shall sit and rule upon his throne, and shall be a Priest upon his throne, &c., vi. 12, 13. That it was Jehovah who was prized at thirty pieces of silver, _i. e._, Jehovah says of himself, as Messiah, that he was so prized, xi. 13. Represents Elohim and Melach Jehovah as equivalent, identifies Jehovah Zebaoth with the SHEPHERD, the _man_ that is his fellow, xiii. 7. Jehovah whose _feet_ shall stand upon the mount of Olives which is before Jerusalem, xiv. 4. Jehovah who shall be King over all the earth, xiv. 9. The King Jehovah Zebaoth, whom all nations shall worship.  The term _Zebaoth_, Hosts, coupled with the Divine designations, points to the official Person, the Messiah, evidently in many, and probably in all instances. Thus He who, in Isaiah vi., is called Adonai, the King, Jehovah Zebaoth, is by the apostle John referred to as the Messiah. He who wrestled with Jacob as a _man_, Gen. xxxii., is called by Hosea (chap. xii.) the Messenger, and Jehovah Elohe Zebaoth. It was the Messiah who, with Moses, was with the church in the wilderness. (Acts vii. 38.) The Melach, or Messenger, who dwelt in the cloud and between the cherubim, (Exod. xiv. 19,) over the ark of Adonai (who is) Jehovah. (Isa. iii. 15.) The ark of _the_ Elohim (who is) Jehovah that dwelleth between the cherubim. (1 Chron. xiii. 6.) The ark of _the_ Elohim, whose name is Jehovah Zebaoth. (2 Samuel vi. 2.) _The_ Adon (who is) Jehovah Zebaoth. (Isa. iii. 1.) The Adon (who is) Adonai Zebaoth. (Isa. x. 16.) The Adonai (who is) Jehovah Zebaoth. (Isa. x. 23, 24.)  This term is coupled with these designations more than three hundred times, chiefly in the prophets after the defection of the tribes to the worship of Baal as the Lord of the hosts of heaven, in opposition to Jehovah Zebaoth.  A personal reference to the Messiah is evidently intended in numerous instances by the term rendered in our version HOLY ONE; as is often manifest from its connection with other designations, and from the personal acts or relations mentioned. Thus Isaiah xliii.: \"I am Jehovah, thy Elohe, the _Holy One_ of Israel, thy _Saviour_: I gave Egypt for thy ransom. Fear not, for I am with thee. (v. 3.) Thus saith Jehovah, your _Redeemer_, [Goel,] the _Holy One_ of Israel, (v. 14,) I am Jehovah, your _Holy One_, the Creator of Israel, your _King_,\" (15.) Chap. xli. 14: \"I will help thee, saith Jehovah, thy _Redeemer_, [Goel,] the _Holy One_ of Israel.\" v. 20: \"The hand of Jehovah hath done this, and the _Holy One_ of Israel hath created it.\" xlvii. 4: \"As for our _Redeemer_, [Goel,] Jehovah Zebaoth is his name, the _Holy One_ of Israel.\" xlviii. 17: \"Thus saith Jehovah, thy _Redeemer_, [Goel,] the _Holy One_ of Israel, I am Jehovah thy Elohe, which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.\" xlix. 7: \"Thus saith Jehovah, the _Redeemer_ [Goel] of Israel, his _Holy One_.\" liv. 5: \"Thy Maker is thy husband, Jehovah Zebaoth is his name, and thy _Redeemer_, [Goel,] the _Holy One_ of Israel; the Elohe of the whole earth shall he be called.\" lx. 14: \"They shall call thee, The city of Jehovah, The Zion of the _Holy One_ of Israel.\" 2 Kings xix.: \"Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the _Holy One_ of Israel. By thy messengers thou hast reproached Adonai.\" Ezek. xxxix. 7: \"The heathen shall know that I am Jehovah, the _Holy One_ in Israel.\" Ps. lxxxix. 18, 19: \"Jehovah is our defence, and the _Holy One_ of Israel is our King. Then thou spakest in vision to thy _Holy One_.\"  That \"The Holy One,\" \"Jehovah,\" and \"The Messiah,\" are the same, is taught in various other passages. Thus in the first instance in which the title occurs, Deut. xxxiii. 8, constituting in part the blessing on the sacerdotal tribe, and containing a reference to other passages: \"And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy HOLY ONE, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah.\" But He whom they proved at Massah, and with whom they strove at Meribah, was Jehovah. \"And Moses called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us or not?\" Exod. xvii. 7. \"Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your Elohe, as ye tempted him in Massah.\" Deut. vi. 16. \"This is the water of Meribah, because the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34680"],["title","The Messiah in Moses and the Prophets (#4)"],["body","of Israel strove with Jehovah.\" Numb. xx. 13. \"At ... Massah ... ye provoked Jehovah to wrath.\" Deut. ix. 22. Now, we learn from 1 Cor. x. and Heb. iii., compared with Ps. lxxviii., xcv., and cvi., that it was the Messiah whom they tempted: \"Neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted.\" ... \"Harden not your hearts as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness, where your fathers tempted me;\" that is, Christ, as the context shows.  \"Thou wilt not suffer thine _Holy One_ to see corruption,\" Ps. xvi. 10; quoted with the context, Acts ii., as designating Christ: \"For David speaketh concerning Him,\" Jesus of Nazareth, \"I foresaw the Lord always before my face.... Neither wilt thou suffer thine _Holy One_ to see corruption.\" Again, Acts xiii., in proof of the resurrection of Christ as predicted: \"Wherefore he saith also in another Psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine _Holy One_ to see corruption.\" So the Christ is recognized in various other passages as the _Holy One_. \"I know thee who thou art, the _Holy One_ of God.\" Mark i. 24, Luke iv. 34. \"But ye denied the _Holy One_ and the Just, ... and killed the Prince of Life.\" Acts iii. 14.  Of the passages, besides those above cited, in which he is identified with Jehovah, the Creator, the Redeemer, Saviour, and King, a few are subjoined. The remnant of Israel \"shall stay upon Jehovah, the _Holy One_ of Israel.\" Isaiah x. 20. \"At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the _Holy One_ of Israel.\" Ibid. 17. \"Thus saith the _Holy One_ of Israel.... Thus saith Jehovah Elohim, the _Holy One_ of Israel.\" Ibid. 30. \"The hand of Jehovah hath done this, and the _Holy One_ of Israel hath created it.\" Ibid. 41. \"Thus saith Jehovah, the _Holy One_ of Israel, and his Maker.\" Ibid. 45.  It is thus evident that the appellations, Jehovah, Elohim, Elohe, Jehovah Zebaoth, Redeemer, Saviour, King, Creator, Maker, the Holy One, and the Christ, are indifferently applied to designate one and the same Person. The term Messiah, the Anointed, though familiar to the Jews of ancient and modern times, occurs but a few times in the Hebrew Scriptures as a designation of him. The appropriation of the term seems to have arisen from the custom of anointing the Levitical priests to a ministry typical of the sacerdotal ministry of Christ, and that of anointing their kings to their office as typical of his regal office. With reference to those priests and kings it is therefore often used; but as a designation of the Christ not perhaps more than five or six times: as in 1 Sam. ii. 10, 35; Ps. ii. 2, lxxxiv. 9; Dan, ix. 25, 26. The import of the phrase \"Holy One\" is so nearly similar, as very probably to have been employed in place of this. This designation occurs in about thirty instances in the prophecies of Isaiah, and frequently elsewhere. Like several other appellations, it is employed exclusively as a designation of the Christ, and is not, like \"Messiah,\" applied to those who are anointed and consecrated to typify his offices.  El-Shadai, Almighty, in like manner designates the Messiah. The Messenger Jehovah who appeared to Moses in the bush, and who speaking to him afterwards is called Jehovah and Elohim, said, Exod. vi. 3: \"I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name El-Shadai.\" \"Jacob said unto Joseph, El-Shadai appeared unto me at Luz, ... and blessed me.\" Gen. xlviii. 3. But when he was first at Luz, Jehovah _visibly_ appeared to him in the vision of a ladder. Gen. xxviii. It was an appearance doubtless of the Messenger Jehovah. And in a subsequent instance, Gen. xxxv., the Elohim _appeared_ to him, blessed him, and changed his name to Israel. \"And the Elohim said unto him, I am El-Shadai.... And the Elohim went up from him in the place where he talked with him.\" This, therefore, was a local personal appearance of the Messenger of the Covenant. _Shadai_ was a familiar designation in the patriarchal period. It occurs frequently in Job. In the New Testament it is applied to Christ. \"I am Alpha and Omega, ... saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.\" Rev. i. 8, iv. 8, and xi. 17.  A similar illustration is furnished by the designations, Mighty God, Living God, God of Israel, High God, Most High God, God of heaven, Lord God, and other formulas of frequent occurrence.  There are a considerable number of instances in which the Personal Word appears to be designated by the phrase _Dabar_ Jehovah, translated the _Word_ of the Lord. The \"_Dabar_ Jehovah _came_ unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, _I am thy shield_, &c. And Abram said, Adonai Jehovah, what will thou give me?... And behold Dabar Jehovah (came) unto him, saying.\" (The word CAME in this clause is not in the original. \"Dabar Jehovah said unto him,\" would perhaps be more correct.) \"And he [Dabar Jehovah] brought, him forth abroad and said, Look now towards heaven.... And he believed in Jehovah,\" (in the Word Jehovah, _Chaldee Par._) Gen. xv. Here personal acts appear to be ascribed to _Dabar_--the Word. It was a person who conversed with Abram and brought him forth abroad; as is observed on a subsequent occasion.  \"_Dabar_ Jehovah came to Jacob, saying, Israel shall be thy name.\" 1 Kings xviii. 31. But in Gen. xxxii. we read that \"there wrestled a man with Jacob, and he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel.\" Here, then, the visible person who, in the form of man, wrestled with Jacob, and who is, by Hosea, chap. xii., denominated the Messenger and the Jehovah Zebaoth, is called _Dabar_ Jehovah, the Personal Word.  \"Now Dabar Jehovah came unto Jonah, ... saying, [or, and said,] Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it, for their wickedness is come up before me. But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from _the presence of_ Jehovah, and he found a ship and went down into it to go unto Tarshish _from the presence of_ Jehovah.\" Chap. i. \"And Dabar Jehovah came unto Jonah the second time, saying, Arise, go unto Nineveh.\" iii. 1, 2. These passages indicate a personal and visible presence. How else could Jonah attempt to conceal himself by flight? In the context the Personal Word who thus came is identified with Jehovah, who speaks and is addressed as one locally and visibly present.  \"Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was _Dabar_ Jehovah yet revealed unto him.\" 1 Sam. iii. 7. No manifestation of the Personal Word had been made to him. \"And Jehovah _appeared_ again in Shiloh: for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by _Dabar_ Jehovah.\" Ibid. v. 21. \"Then came _Dabar_ Jehovah to Samuel, saying, It repenteth me, &c.\" Ibid. xv. 10. \"It was charged me by _Dabar_ Jehovah.... It was said to me by _Dabar_ Jehovah.\" 1 Kings xiii. 9, 17. \"And Elijah came to a cave and lodged there; and behold, _Dabar_ Jehovah came to him, and _he_ said unto him, What dost thou here, Elijah?... And _he_ said, Go forth and stand upon the mount _before_ Jehovah. And behold, Jehovah _passed_ by.\" 1 Kings xix. 9, 11. \"_Dabar_ Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying, Before I formed thee, I knew thee.... Then said I, Ah, Adonai Jehovah! behold I cannot speak.... Then Jehovah put forth _his hand_ and touched my mouth.... Moreover, _Dabar_ Jehovah _came_ unto me, saying, [or, and said,] What seest thou?... And _Dabar_ Jehovah came unto me the second time,\" &c. Jer. i.  Such are some of the instances in which this term appears to be employed as a personal designation. The meaning and reference of such use of it appear to have been familiar both to the earlier and later Jews. See the chapters relating to the Chaldee Paraphrases.     CHAPTER III.      Reasons for rendering the formula, \"Melach Jehovah,\" the     Messenger (who is) Jehovah; and not _the_ Angel, or _an_ Angel     _of_ the Lord.   An examination of the numerous passages in which the denominative _Melach_ is coupled with the name Jehovah, or Elohim, or used interchangeably with those names, renders it conclusively manifest that in each and every instance the reference is to one and the same official Person. This, however, is not entirely obvious from our common version, owing to the circumstance that the translators rendered the formula, Melach Jehovah, _the_ angel, or sometimes _an_ angel _of_ the Lord. The word Jehovah, in the original, never has the article; nor the word Melach, when coupled with Jehovah, though when employed alone to designate the same official Person, the article is sometimes prefixed, as in Gen. xlviii. 16: \"_The_ Melach, which redeemed me.\" The word Elohim often has the article, and retains it in most of the instances in which the formula Melach Elohim occurs, requiring it to be read, Melach _the_, or who is _the_, Elohim. See some twelve instances in the book of Ezra, and more than twenty in Nehemiah, where there was a special occasion to distinguish the true from the false God. In the formula, Melach Jehovah, there is nothing in the original to forbid the two words being considered as in apposition, and the rendering consequently _the Messenger Jehovah_, or the Messenger who is Jehovah. And that such should be the rendering, instead of the angel or messenger _of_ Jehovah, is apparent from the following considerations:  1st. That the Person identified by this name of office is Jehovah, as is shown by the use, in numerous passages, of the two names interchangeably. The word Melach, it may be observed, is, when coupled with the name Jehovah, and when used separately or interchangeably, with the same personal reference, always in the singular number; and, when coupled with that name, generally precedes it; by which circumstances, and the relations in which it occurs separately, all confusion as to its reference is precluded.  2d. From the consideration that this rendering corresponds with the official character of the Person designated. His office is that of a messenger, sent of the Father--the Mediator, the Christ. The"]]]
