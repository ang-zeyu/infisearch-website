I find it well developed and identical, with a double articulation and free ends, in all the Bombycillids. There is no significant variability in the family, and this is more evidence of close taxonomic relationship between the members of the family.  The size of the crania is somewhat variable, although the differences seem to be primarily those of proportion. Ptilogonatinae have long crania, whereas the crania of the Bombycillinae and Dulinae are shorter but deeper. I regard the longer cranium as primitive, and it is longest in _Phainoptila_. In order of decreasing relative length of the cranium, _Phainoptila_ is followed by _Ptilogonys caudatus_, _P. cinereus_, and _Phainopepla_. _Bombycilla garrula_ has the deepest cranium in the family.  The measurements of the lengths and widths of the skulls are given in Table 9. The relative length of the bill and relative width of the skull are given in Table 10. These relative measurements are calculated by using the actual measurements in Table 9 as numerators, the length of the skull from the lacrimal bone to the posteriormost end of the skull being used as the denominator. The data indicate that _Phainoptila_ has a slightly narrower cranium.   _Humerus._--Certain families of passerine birds have a noticeable variation in the characteristics of the humerus; the bone varies in length, in diameter, and in the complexity of the processes at either end. In the Bombycillids, however, the amount of variation is relatively small, and the diaphysis of the bone is somewhat twisted, especially so in _Dulus_. The deltoid tuberosity is variable, being shorter but more elevated in _Bombycilla_ than it is in the Ptilogonatinae and in the Dulinae. The tendon from the pectoralis major muscle, which inserts on this process, probably finds better insertion on a higher process than on a lower but longer one.     [Illustration: Figs. 22-28.

The external condyle, however, is significantly variable in the family. This condyle is longest and most pronounced in birds in which the humerus is short in relation to the trunk, as for example in _Tachycineta_. In the Bombycillidae the condyle is smallest in _Phainoptila_, where it is a mere suggestion of a process. In the remainder of the Ptilogonatinae, the condyle is larger but rounded, and shows a double process in _Ptilogonys caudatus_, and a slightly pointed process in _P. cinereus_. The external condyle in _Dulus_ is not specialized, being low and rounded, but in _Bombycilla_, it is noticeably elongated, indicating a better attachment distally for the deltoid muscle. (No measurements are tabulated for this condyle, as the percentage of error in measuring this small structure is great.) Table 1 gives lengths of humeri, and Table 2 gives lengths of the humeri expressed as percentages of the length of the trunk, a standard measurement.  The area of insertion of the deltoid muscle is elongated in those birds with shortened humeri; these birds have also greater flight power than do birds with longer humeri and therefore a shorter external condyle.

It reflects, of course, the character of the caudal muscles and their size, as well as the length of the rectrices and the corresponding force necessary to hold these feathers upright and in a useful position. Firm attachment is important even in flight, because the tail is used as a rudder, and in the Ptilogonatinae as a brake. The pygostyle is most modified in this subfamily.  In lateral aspect, the pygostyles of the species of the Ptilogonatinae are similar. The crest of the bone is flattened dorsally, and has a broad anterior surface that is thin and bladelike. This is widest in _Ptilogonys caudatus_, and narrowest in _Phainoptila_, in which genus, however, the entire bone is of small size. The centrum is widest in _Ptilogonys caudatus_, and is progressively narrower in _P. cinereus_, _Phainopepla_, and _Phainoptila_. Greater width provides a larger area of attachment for the larger rectrices and also more area for insertion of the lateralis caudae muscle, the size of which varies more than that of the other caudal muscles in the different species of the Bombycillidae.

The dorsal spinous portion is acutely pointed instead of flattened as in the Ptilogonatinae. In _Dulus_, the spinous portion is extremely thin, and shows a decided curve dorsad from the centrum, and there is no flattened area anterior to the spinous portion as is seen in _Ptilogonys_.  The centrum in cross section varies considerably. In _Bombycilla_ the walls are indented, with definite terminal knobs; both knobs and indentations are more pronounced in _B. garrula_ than in _cedrorum_, however. The spinous portion is enlarged in both species, and the rest of the neck region is constricted (Figs. 29-35).  The centrum of _Dulus_ in posterior aspect presents the appearance of a simple shield; little of the indentation seen in _Bombycilla_ is present. The spinous portion is plain, with no constriction nor terminal enlargement in the neck. The centrum in _Phainopepla_ is similar to that in _Dulus_, but has a small expansion at the base of the spine, the entire centrum being wider in proportion to its over-all size than in any of the other species mentioned previously. The centrum in _Ptilogonys_ shows great width, and the spine is in a large expanded tip as in _Bombycilla_. The lateral edges of the centrum in _P. cinereus_ are \"winged\" and in two separate halves; whereas the centrum "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34556"],["title","Phylogeny of the Waxwings and Allied Birds (#7)"],["body","_P. caudatus_ is fairly plain, its specialization being reflected primarily in breadth and flatness. In cross section of the centrum, _Phainoptila_ is similar to _Phainopepla_, although, in the former, the bone is smaller in proportion to the size of the animal, and the lateral wings are more angular than in _Phainopepla_.

The most generalized pygostyle is in _Phainoptila_, and that of _Dulus_ differs only slightly. In _Bombycilla_ the pygostyle is proportionately small, but is complex in shape; there is seemingly not the need for greatly expanded areas since the caudal muscles are less specialized in this genus.   _Sternum._--The sternum in Bombycillids is typically passerine in general shape and in having a long and deep carina or sternal crest. The caudal process of the bone is broad, with the terminal ends flattened, forming dorsally a graceful V-shaped outline, whereas the outline of the posterior end of the sternum is broad and convex.  In lateral aspect, the carina is deeper in _Bombycilla_ than in other genera of the family, and is deepest in _B. garrula_. In this species, the manubrium is more extended and comparatively larger than in the other species of the family. The anterior edge of the keel forms the sharpest angle in _B. cedrorum_. In _Dulus_, the keel is moderately deep, the manubrium short, and there is a distinct indented curve between the manubrium and the anterior angle of the keel.  In ventral aspect the lateral processes of the sternum tend to flare outwards in adult Ptilogonatines on almost the same plane as the rest of the bone, whereas in _Bombycilla_ and _Dulus_ the same process is closer to the body of the sternum. In _Bombycilla_ the xiphoid process is more dorsal in position than in other species in the family, and in _Dulus_ an upward curve is very noticeable. The process in these two genera is narrower than in the Ptilogonatinae, and lacks the heavy distal terminal enlargement which is apparent in _Ptilogonys_.   _Relative Lengths of Bones._--In instances where the animals being compared are obviously different in over-all size, it is useful to express the size of a given part in relation to some other part of the same individual organism if the aim is to obtain clues as to differences in functions of the parts being compared. Differences in actual lengths of corresponding bones in two kinds of animals often, of course, reflect only the difference in over-all size of the animals. Consequently, the relative size of the part is expressed as a percentage in this paper. In computing a percentage it is well, of course, to select some relatively stable part of the animal to use as a denominator in the mathematical expression that yields the percentage. The thoracic region of the vertebral column is thought to be such a part. For example, the length of the humerus divided by the length of the thoracic region yields, in _Phainopepla_ and _Ptilogonys_, respective percentages of .84 and .85. These are roughly the same, whereas the actual lengths of the humeri are 2.21 and 2.39 cm.     Table 4.
