Assuming that the primary divisions of the American colubrids into subfamilies based on the nature of the sulcus spermaticus and the presence or absence of hypapophyses on the posterior vertebrae have some reality, _Tantalophis_ must be placed in the subfamily Xenodontinae comprising genera chiefly South American in their distribution, but with several genera in Middle America and a few in North America and the West Indies. In order to limit the number of genera to be compared with _Tantalophis_, only those xenodontines having apical pits and bifurcate hemipenis are considered. These include _Cyclagras_, _Drepanoides_, _Hypsirhynchus_, _Ialtris_, _Leimadophis_, _Pseudablabes_, _Siphlophis_, _Tachymenis_, _Tomodon_, and _Trypanurgos_. Aside from differences in scutellation, _Leimadophis_, _Siphlophis_, and _Trypanurgos_ have the heads of the hemipenes terminating in a disc, and _Ialtris_ has a plicate hemipenis. _Tomodon_ has basal spines on the hemipenis. The hemipenes of the other genera have proximal folds, distal spines, and distal calyces, not greatly unlike the condition found in _Tantalophis_. Of these, _Cyclagras_, _Hypsirhynchus_, and _Pseudablabes_ have round pupils and certain differences in scutellation. _Drepanoides_ and _Tachymenis_ have elliptical pupils like those of _Tantalophis_, but _Tachymenis_ has only one apical pit, and _Drepanoides_ has one apical pit or none. In the above characters no especially close relationship between _Tantalophis_ and any one of these genera is apparent.  If the characteristics usually employed in distinguishing and relating genera are ignored and other more subjective criteria are used, the relationships of _Tantalophis_ still remain obscure. Of the xenodontine genera _Tantalophis_ approaches _Leimadophis_ in general physiognomy; perhaps it represents an early divergent stock of _Leimadophis_ that has undergone radical changes in the hemipenis and other characters. On the other hand, if the nature of the hemipenis is of no importance in defining supergeneric groups of colubrid snakes, _Tantalophis_ may have its relationships with _Leptodeira_ and _Hypsiglena_. Although herpetologists have been working intensively on American colubrids for many decades, the relationships of the majority of the groups are not well understood. Until the hemipenes and skulls of all of the forms have been studied and compared, and the evolutionary significance has been determined for the characters of the hemipenes, dentition, and apical pits, our knowledge of the relationships of these snakes will be incomplete.  _Remarks._--The individual on which this paper is based is the only specimen of the species with definite locality data. It is from a locality six miles southeast of Tamazulápam in northwestern Oaxaca. This town lies at an elevation of about 6500 feet in the upper reaches of the Balsas Basin, an arid interior valley that expands in its upper end to form a broad basin of rolling and dissected terrain ranging from about 4000 to 6800 feet in elevation. The countryside around Tamazulápam is arid and supports plants of the genera _Prosopis_, _Acacia_, _Ipomoea_, and _Cassia_, and also columnar cacti. Oaks and pines grow on the limestone hills rising above the rolling valley. _Tantalophis_ may be endemic to the Balsas Basin, as are many other species of reptiles. However, if the snake has its relatives to the south in lower Central America and South America, such a distribution seems unlikely, even for an apparent relict.  _Acknowledgments._--For permission to study and report on this specimen I am indebted to Dr. E. Raymond Hall and Mr. John M. Legler. I am grateful to Dr. Laurence C. Stuart for many helpful suggestions and to Dr. Norman E.

THE JAPANESE TWINS  THE JAPANESE TWINS AND BOT'CHAN   Away, away, ever so far away, near the western shores of the Ocean of Peace, lie the Happy Islands, the Paradise of Children.  Some people call this ocean the \"Pacific\" and they call the Happy Islands \"Japan,\" but the meaning is just the same. Those are only their grown-up names, that you find them by on the map, in the geography.  They are truly Happy Islands, for the sun shines there so brightly that all the people go about with pleasant, smiling faces, and the children play out of doors the whole year through without ever quarreling. And they are never, never spanked! Of course, the reason for that is that they are so good they never, never need it! Or maybe their fathers and mothers do not believe in spanking.  I have even been told--though I don't know whether to think it's true or not--that Japanese parents believe more in sugar-plums than in punishments to make children good!  Anyway, the children there are very good indeed.  In a little town near a large city on one of the Happy Islands, there is a garden. In the garden stands a house, and in that House there live Taro, who is a boy, and Take (Pronounce Tah'-kay), who is a girl.  They are twins. They are Japanese Twins and they are just five years old, both of them.  Of course, Taro and Take do not live alone in the house in the garden. Their Father and Mother live there too, and their Grandmother, who is very old, and the Baby, who is very young.  Taro and Take cannot remember when Grandmother and Father and Mother happened, because they were all there when the Twins came; and the Twins could not possibly imagine the world without Father and Mother and Grandmother.  But with the Baby it was different. One day there wasn't any Baby at all, and the next day after that, there he was, looking very new but quite at home already in the little house in the garden, where Taro and Take lived.  \"Taro\" means eldest son, and the Baby might have been called \"Jiro,\" because \"Jiro\" means \"second,\" and he was the second boy in the family; but from the day he came they called him just \"Bot'Chan.\" That is what they call boy babies in Japan.  \"Take\" means \"bamboo,\" and the Twins' Father and Mother named their little daughter \"Take\" because they hoped she would grow up to be tall and slender and strong and graceful like the bamboo tree.  Now, can you think of anything nicer in this world than being Twins, and living with a Mother and Father and Grandmother and a Baby Brother, in a dear little house, in a dear little garden, in a dear little, queer little town in the middle of the Happy Islands that lie in the Ocean of Peace?  Taro and Take thought it was the nicest thing that could possibly have happened; though, as they hadn't ever lived anywhere else, or been anybody but themselves for a single minute, I don't see how they could be quite so sure about it.  This book is all about Taro and Take and the Baby, and what a nice time they had living. And if you want to know some of the things that happened on the very first day that the Twins and Bot'Chan ever saw each other you can turn over to the next page and read about the day the Baby came. That tells all about it, just exactly as it was.     THE DAY THE BABY CAME  THE DAY THE BABY CAME   Taro and Take were standing right beside their Father early one morning when the nurse came into the room with a bundle in her arms.  It was a queer-looking, knobby kind of a bundle, and there was something in it that squirmed!  The nurse looked so happy and smiling that the twins knew at once there must be something very nice in the bundle, but what it was they could not guess. Taro thought, \"Maybe it's a puppy.\" He had wanted a puppy for a long time. And Take thought, \"Perhaps it's a kitten! But it looks pretty large for a kitten, and it doesn't mew. Kittens always mew.\" And they both thought, \"Anyway, it's alive.\"  The nurse carried the bundle across the room. She knelt down on the floor before the Twins' Father and laid it at his feet.  The Twins' Father looked very much surprised, and as for Taro and Take, they felt just exactly the way you feel when you look at your stocking on Christmas morning.  They dropped down on their knees beside the bundle, one on each side of their Father. They wanted dreadfully to open it. They wanted so dreadfully to open it that they had to hold their hands hard to keep from touching it, but they never even laid a finger on it, because the nurse had given it to their Father!  Taro just said aloud: \"Is it a puppy?\"  At the very same moment Take said: \"Is it a kitten?\"  And then their Father said: \"I haven't opened the bundle yet, so how can I tell? We must ask the nurse. What is it, Natsu?\"  And Natsu, the nurse, put her two hands together on the matting in front of her, bobbed her head down nearly to the floor, and said: \"It is a little son, Master. Will you accept him?\"  Then the Father sat right down on the floor, too, between Taro and Take. He took the little squirming bundle in his arms, and turned back the covers--and there was a beautiful baby boy, with long, narrow eyes and a lock of hair that stood straight up on the top of his head!  \"Oh! oh! Is he truly ours--a real live baby, for us to keep?\" cried Take.  \"Would you like to keep him?\" her Father asked.  Take clapped her hands for joy. \"Oh, yes, yes!\" she said. \"For then I can have a little brother of my own to carry on my back, just the way O Kiku San carries hers! I've never had a thing but borrowed babies before! And O Kiku San is not polite about lending hers at all! Please, please let me hold him!\"  She held up her arms, and the Father laid the little baby in them very, very gently.  Taro was so surprised to see a baby in the bundle that he had not said a word. He just sat still and looked astonished.  \"Well, Taro, how is it with you?\" said his Father. \"Would you like to keep the Baby, too?\"  \"I'd even rather have him than a puppy!\" said Taro very solemnly. And that was a great deal for Taro to say, for he had wanted a puppy for ever so many weeks.  \"So would I rather have him than a puppy,\" the Father said; \"ever so much rather.\"  Just then the Baby puckered up his nose, and opened his little bit of a mouth--and a great big squeal came out of it! You would never have believed that such a big squeal could possibly come out of such a little mouth. And he squirmed more than ever.  Then Natsu, the nurse, said, \"There, there, little one! Come to your old Natsu, and she will carry you to Mother again.\"  \"Let me carry him,\" Take begged.  \"No, let me,\" said Taro.  But Natsu said, \"No, no, I will carry him myself. But you may come with me, if you want to, and see your Mother.\"  So Taro and Take and their Father all tiptoed quietly into the Mother's room, and sat down on the floor beside her bed.  They sat on the floor because everybody sits on the floor in Japan. The bed was on the floor, too.  It was made of many thick quilts, and the pillow a little block of wood! We should think it very uncomfortable, but the Twins' Mother did not think so. She lay with the wooden pillow under her head in such a way that her hair was not mussed by it-- instead, it looked just as neat as if she were going to a party. And it was just as nice as a party, because they all had such a happy time together watching the new baby.  Bot'Chan acted just like all the other babies in the world. First he got his fist into his mouth by accident, and sucked it. Then he got it out again without meaning to, and punched himself in the nose with it--such a funny little nose, no bigger than a small button! Then he opened his mouth wide and yawned.  \"See how sleepy the little mouse is,\" said the Mother. \"Run out and play now, my children, and let him rest.\"  Taro and Take left the room softly and went out on the porch. They sat down on the top step to talk over the wonderful thing that had happened.  It was springtime and the flowers in the garden were just pushing their leaves through the ground. The sun was shining, and a little new yellow butterfly, that had only just crept out of its snug cocoon that very day, was dancing about in the"]]]
