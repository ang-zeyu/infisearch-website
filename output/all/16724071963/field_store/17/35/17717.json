By comparative study of coloration, nesting, food habits, skeleton and soft parts, an attempt is made to determine which of the differences and similarities between species are the result of habits within relatively recent geological time, and which differences are the result of inheritance from ancient ancestral stocks, which were in the distant past morphologically different. On the basis of this information, an attempt is made to ascertain the natural relationships of these birds. Previous workers have assigned waxwings alone to the family Bombycillidae, and a question to be determined in the present study is whether or not additional kinds of birds should be included in the family.  It has generally been assumed that the nomadic waxwings originated under boreal conditions, in their present breeding range, and that they did not undergo much adaptive radiation but remained genetically homogeneous. Also it is assumed that the species were wide ranging and thus did not become isolated geographically to the extent that, say, the Fringillidae did. The assumption that waxwings originated in the northern part of North America or Eurasia may be correct, but it is more probable that the origin was more southerly, perhaps, in northern Mexico, of North America (see p. 519.) Subsequent to the differentiation of this stock in the south, there was a northerly movement, while certain populations remained behind and underwent an evolution different from the northern group. Since the fossil record does not permit us to say when in geological time the family originated, we must rely on anatomical evidence and the distributional evidence of present-day species to estimate when the family stock had diverged from some unknown group sufficiently to merit the status of a separate family.     ACKNOWLEDGMENTS   It is with pleasure that I acknowledge the guidance received in this study from Professor E. Raymond Hall of the University of Kansas. I am indebted also to Dr. Herbert Friedmann of the United States National Museum for the loan of certain skins, skeletons, and alcoholic material; to Mr. Alexander Skutch, for notes on certain Central American birds; and to Dr. Henry W. Setzer, Mr. George H. Lowery, Jr., Mr. Victor E. Jones, Mr. Victor Housholder, Mr. Alvaro Wille-Trejos, and Mr. Morton F. Davis, for gifts of specimens that have been used in this work. Suggestions and critical comments from Professors Worthie H. Horr, Charles G. Sibley and Edward H. Taylor are gratefully acknowledged. I wish also to thank Mrs. Virginia Unruh for the preparation of the drawings used in this work.     NOMENCLATURAL HISTORY   The oldest name available for any species of the waxwings is _Lanius garrulus_ Linnaeus (1758). _Lanius garrulus_ and _Lanius garrulus_ variety B _carolinensis_ were described as conspecific. The description has been associated with the first of the two names. The latter name is a _nomen nudum_ since it was not accompanied by a separate description. The generic name _Lanius_ was originally applied to both shrikes and waxwings by Linnaeus. Since that name is applied to the shrikes only, the next available generic name that may be applied to the generically different waxwings must be used. This is _Bombycilla_, a name originally proposed by Brisson (1760) for the Cedar Waxwing. In the 12th Edition of the Systemae Naturae (1766) Gmelin proposed the generic name _Ampelis_ for the Bohemian Waxwing, and combined it with the specific name _garrulus_, the Cedar Waxwing being termed variety B. Vieillot (1807) proposed the generic name _Bombycilla_ and combined it with a new specific name, _cedrorum_, for the Cedar Waxwing. Vieillot has been cited as the author of _Bombycilla_ since that time, although Brisson used _Bombycilla_ 33 years before. Oberholser (1917) did not cite Brisson's work in his discussion of the proper generic name for the waxwings, and _Bombycilla_ should be ascribed to Brisson and not Vieillot, since Opinion 37, rendered by the International Zo√∂logical Committee on Nomenclature, states that generic names used by Brisson (1760) are valid under the Code. In consequence, the specific name available for the Cedar Waxwing, since Brisson is ruled not to be a binomialist, is _Bombycilla cedrorum_ Vieillot (1807).  Most workers prior to 1900 utilized the family name Ampelidae to include waxwings, silky flycatchers, and palm-chats. Ridgway (1904:113) elevated the silky flycatchers to family rank under the name Ptilogonatidae, and assigned the palm-chats to a separate family, the Dulidae.     MATERIALS   The following specimens, numbering 238, and representing each currently recognized species and subspecies, were used in the study, and were supplemented by observation in 1947 on specimens in the United States National Museum.     ====================================================================           Species or Subspecies           | Skin | Skeleton| Alcoholic   ----------------------------------------+------+---------+----------   _Phainoptila melanoxantha melanoxantha_ |    8 |    1    |    2   _Phainoptila melanoxantha minor_        |    2 |         |   _Ptilogonys cinereus cinereus_          |   13 |    3    |    4   _Ptilogonys cinereus molybdophanes_     |    6 |         |   _Ptilogonys caudatus_                   |   16 |    3    |    4   _Phainopepla nitens nitens_             |      |    1    |    5   _Phainopepla nitens lepida_             |   12 |    5    |    4   _Bombycilla cedrorum_                   |   53 |   27    |    8   _Bombycilla garrula garrula_            |    4 |    3    |   _Bombycilla garrula centralasiae_       |    9 |    2    |   _Bombycilla garrula pallidiceps_        |    7 |    3    |    2   _Bombycilla japonica_                   |   10 |         |   _Dulus dominicus dominicus_             |    9 |    5    |    2   _Dulus dominicus oviedo_                |    4 |    1    |                                           |---------------------------       Totals                              |  153 |   54    |   31   --------------------------------------------------------------------     DIAGNOSES   Family Bombycillidae  _Diagnosis._--Bill short, flat, somewhat obtuse, minutely notched near tip of each maxilla, flared at base; gape wide and deeply cleft; culmen convex; nasal fossa broad, exposed, or filled with short, erect or antrorse, close-set velvety feathers; nostril narrowly elliptical; rictal vibrissae long, short, or absent;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34556"],["title","Phylogeny of the Waxwings and Allied Birds (#1)"],["body","bone free, articulating at two points; wings long and pointed, or short and rounded; primaries ten, tenth reduced in some species; tail short, narrow, even, two thirds or less length of wing, or much longer and forked or rounded; feet weak (except in _Dulus_ and _Phainoptila_); tarsus generally shorter than middle toe and claw, distinctly scutellate with five or six divisions, the lateral plate subdivided (except in _Phainoptila_); lateral toes of nearly equal length; hallux approximately as long as inner lateral toe, or shorter; basal phalanx of middle toe more or less united to that of outer and inner toes; body stout; head generally conspicuously crested; plumage soft, smooth and silky (except in _Dulus_); eggs spotted; nest in trees; three subfamilies, five genera, eight species.
