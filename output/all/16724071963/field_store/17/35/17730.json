Our paths have         diverged at the very outset, and we have little oppor-         tunity to help each other. On the contrary, if my 21:21   friends pursue my course, we have the same railroad         guides, and our mutual interests are identical; or, if I         take up their line of travel, they help me on, and our 21:24   companionship may continue.                                Zigzag course          Being in sympathy with matter, the worldly man is at         the beck and call of error, and will be attracted thither- 21:27   ward. He is like a traveller going westward         for a pleasure-trip. The company is alluring         and the pleasures exciting. After following the sun for 21:30   six days, he turns east on the seventh, satisfied if he can         only imagine himself drifting in the right direction. By-         and-by, ashamed of his zigzag course, he would borrow 22:1    the passport of some wiser pilgrim, thinking with the aid         of this to find and follow the right road.                             Moral retrogression  22:3    Vibrating like a pendulum between sin and the hope         of forgiveness,- selfishness and sensuality causing con-         stant retrogression,- our moral progress will 22:6    be slow. Waking to Christ's demand, mortals         experience suffering. This causes them, even as drown-         ing men, to make vigorous efforts to save themselves; and 22:9    through Christ's precious love these efforts are crowned         with success.                               Wait for reward          \"Work out your own salvation,\" is the demand of 22:12   Life and Love, for to this end God worketh with you.         \"Occupy till I come!\" Wait for your re-         ward, and \"be not weary in well doing.\" If 22:15   your endeavors are beset by fearful odds, and you receive         no present reward, go not back to error, nor become a         sluggard in the race.  22:18   When the smoke of battle clears away, you will dis-         cern the good you have done, and receive according to         your deserving. Love is not hasty to deliver us from 22:21   temptation, for Love means that we shall be tried and         purified.                          Deliverance not vicarious          Final deliverance from error, whereby we rejoice in 22:24   immortality, boundless freedom, and sinless sense, is not         reached through paths of flowers nor by pinning         one's faith without works to another's vicarious 22:27   effort. Whosoever believeth that wrath is righteous or         that divinity is appeased by human suffering, does not         understand God.                          Justice and substitution  22:30   Justice requires reformation of the sinner. Mercy         cancels the debt only when justice approves. Revenge         is inadmissible. Wrath which is only appeased is not 23:1    destroyed, but partially indulged. Wisdom and Love         may require many sacrifices of self to save us from sin. 23:3    One sacrifice, however great, is insufficient to         pay the debt of sin. The atonement requires         constant self-immolation on the sinner's part. That 23:6    God's wrath should be vented upon His beloved Son, is         divinely unnatural. Such a theory is man-made. The         atonement is a hard problem in theology, but its scien- 23:9    tific explanation is, that suffering is an error of sinful sense         which Truth destroys, and that eventually both sin and suf-         fering will fall at the feet of everlasting Love.                             Doctrines and faith  23:12   Rabbinical lore said: \"He that taketh one doctrine,         firm in faith, has the Holy Ghost dwelling in him.\"         This preaching receives a strong rebuke in 23:15   the Scripture, \"Faith without works is dead.\"         Faith, if it be mere belief, is as a pendulum swinging be-         tween nothing and something, having no fixity. Faith, 23:18   advanced to spiritual understanding, is the evidence gained         from Spirit, which rebukes sin of every kind and estab-         lishes the claims of God.                        Self-reliance and confidence  23:21   In Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and English, /faith/ and the         words corresponding thereto have these two defini-         tions, /trustfulness/ and /trustworthiness/. One 23:24   kind of faith trusts one's welfare to others.         Another kind of faith understands divine Love and how         to work out one's \"own salvation, with fear and trem- 23:27   bling.\" \"Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief!\"         expresses the helplessness of a blind faith; whereas the         injunction, \"Believe . . . and thou shalt be saved!\" 23:30   demands self-reliant trustworthiness, which includes spir-         itual understanding and confides all to God.          The Hebrew verb /to believe/ means also /to be firm/ or 24:1    /to be constant/. This certainly applies to Truth and Love         understood and practised. Firmness in error will never 24:3    save from sin, disease, and death.                           Life's healing currents          Acquaintance with the original texts, and willingness         to give up human beliefs (established by hierarchies, and 24:6    instigated sometimes by the worst passions of         men), open the way for Christian Science to be         understood, and make the Bible the chart of life, where 24:9    the buoys and healing currents of Truth are pointed         out.                               Radical changes          He to whom \"the arm of the Lord\" is revealed will 24:12   believe our report, and rise into newness of life with re-         generation. This is having part in the atone-         ment; this is the understanding, in which 24:15   Jesus suffered and triumphed. The time is not distant         when the ordinary theological views of atonement will         undergo a great change, - a change as radical as that 24:18   which has come over popular opinions in regard to pre-         destination and future punishment.                           Purpose of crucifixion          Does erudite theology regard the crucifixion of Jesus 24:21   chiefly as providing a ready pardon for all sinners who         ask for it and are willing to be forgiven?         Does spiritualism find Jesus' death necessary 24:24   only for the presentation, after death, of the material         Jesus, as a proof that spirits can return to earth? Then         we must differ from them both.  24:27   The efficacy of the crucifixion lay in the practical af-         fection and goodness it demonstrated for mankind. The         truth had been lived among men; but until they saw that 24:30   it enabled their Master to triumph over the grave, his own         disciples could not admit such an event to be possible.         After the resurrection, even the unbelieving Thomas was 25:1    forced to acknowledge how complete was the great proof of         Truth and Love.                            True flesh and blood  25:3    The spiritual essence of blood is sacrifice. The effi-         cacy of Jesus' spiritual offering is infinitely greater than         can be expressed by our sense of human 25:6    blood. The material blood of Jesus was no         more efficacious to cleanse from sin when it was shed         upon \"the accursed tree,\" than when it was flowing in 25:9    his veins as he went daily about his Father's business.         His true flesh and blood were his Life; and they truly eat         his flesh and drink his blood, who partake of that divine 25:12   Life.                              Effective triumph          Jesus taught the way of Life by demonstration, that         we may understand how this divine Principle heals 25:15   the sick, casts out error, and triumphs over         death. Jesus presented the ideal of God better         than could any man whose origin was less spiritual. By 25:18   his obedience to God, he demonstrated more spiritu-         ally than all others the Principle of being. Hence the         force of his admonition, \"If ye love me, keep my com- 25:21   mandments.\"          Though demonstrating his control over sin and disease,         the great Teacher by no means relieved others from giving 25:24   the requisite proofs of their own piety. He worked for         their guidance, that they might demonstrate this power as         he did and understand its divine Principle. Implicit faith 25:27   in the Teacher and all the emotional love we can bestow         on him, will never alone make us imitators of him. We         must go and do likewise, else we are not improving the 25:30   great blessings which our Master worked and suffered to         bestow upon us. The divinity of the Christ was made         manifest in the humanity of Jesus.                            Individual experience  26:1    While we adore Jesus, and the heart overflows with         gratitude for what he did for mortals, - treading alone 26:3    his loving pathway up to the throne of         glory, in speechless agony exploring the way         for us, - yet Jesus spares us not one individual expe- 26:6    rience, if we follow his commands faithfully; and all         have the cup of sorrowful effort to drink in proportion         to their demonstration of his love, till all are redeemed 26:9    through divine Love.                           Christ's demonstration          The Christ was the Spirit which Jesus implied in his         own statements: \"I am the way, the truth, and the life;\" 26:12   \"I and my Father are one.\" This Christ,         or divinity of the man Jesus, was his divine         nature, the godliness which animated him. Divine Truth, 26:15   Life, and Love gave Jesus authority over sin, sickness,         and death. His mission was to reveal the Science of         celestial being, to prove what God is and what He does 26:18   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3458"],["title","Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures (#6)"],["body","man.                              Proof in practice          A musician demonstrates the beauty of the music he         teaches in order to show the learner the way by prac- 26:21   tice as well as precept. Jesus' teaching and         practice of Truth involved such a sacrifice         as makes us admit its Principle to be Love. This was 26:24   the precious import of our Master's sinless career and         of his demonstration of power over death. He proved         by his deeds that Christian Science destroys sickness, sin, 26:27   and death.          Our Master taught no mere theory, doctrine, or belief.         It was the divine Principle of all real being which he 26:30   taught and practised. His proof of Christianity was no         form or system of religion and worship, but Christian         Science, working out the harmony of Life and Love. 27:1    Jesus sent a message to John the Baptist, which was in-         tended to prove beyond a question that the Christ had 27:3    come: \"Go your way, and tell John what things ye have         seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk,         the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, 27:6    to the poor the gospel is preached.\" In other words:         Tell John what the demonstration of divine power is,         and he will at once perceive that God is the power in 27:9    the Messianic work.                                Living temple          That Life is God, Jesus proved by his reappearance         after the crucifixion in strict accordance with his scien- 27:12   tific statement: \"Destroy this temple [body],         and in three days I [Spirit] will raise it up.\"         It is as if he had said: The I - the Life, substance, 27:15   and intelligence of the universe - is not in matter to         be destroyed.          Jesus' parables explain Life as never mingling with 27:18   sin and death. He laid the axe of Science at the root         of material knowledge, that it might be ready to cut         down the false doctrine of pantheism, - that God, or 27:21   Life, is in or of matter.                             Recreant disciples          Jesus sent forth seventy students at one time, but only         eleven left a desirable historic record. Tradition credits 27:24   him with two or three hundred other disciples         who have left no name. \"Many are called,         but few are chosen.\" They fell away from grace because 27:27   they never truly understood their Master's instruction.          Why do those who profess to follow Christ reject the         essential religion he came to establish? Jesus' persecu- 27:30   tors made their strongest attack upon this very point.         They endeavored to hold him at the mercy of matter and         to kill him according to certain assumed material laws.                             Help and hindrance  28:1    The Pharisees claimed to know and to teach the di-         vine will, but they only hindered the success of Jesus' 28:3    mission. Even many of his students stood         in his way. If the Master had not taken a         student and taught the unseen verities of God, he would 28:6    not have been crucified. The determination to hold Spirit         in the grasp of matter is the persecutor of Truth and         Love.  28:9    While respecting all that is good in the Church or out         of it, one's consecration to Christ is more on the ground         of demonstration than of profession. In conscience, we 28:12   cannot hold to beliefs outgrown; and by understanding         more of the divine Principle of the deathless Christ, we         are enabled to heal the sick and to triumph over sin.                           Misleading conceptions  28:15   Neither the origin, the character, nor the work of         Jesus was generally understood. Not a single compo-         nent part of his nature did the material 28:18   world measure aright. Even his righteous-         less and purity did not hinder men from saying: He         is a glutton and a friend of the impure, and Beelzebub is 28:21   his patron.                            Persecution prolonged          Remember, thou Christian martyr, it is enough if         thou art found worthy to unloose the sandals of thy 28:24   Master's feet! To suppose that persecution         for righteousness' sake belongs to the past,         and that Christianity to-day is at peace with the world 28:27   because it is honored by sects and societies, is to mis-         take the very nature of religion. Error repeats itself.         The trials encountered by prophet, disciple, and apostle, 28:30   \"of whom the world was not worthy,\" await, in some         form, every pioneer of truth.                              Christian warfare          There is too much animal courage in society and not 29:1    sufficient moral courage. Christians must take up arms         against error at home and abroad. They must grapple 29:3    with sin in themselves and in others, and         continue this warfare until they have finished         their course. If they keep the faith, they will have the 29:6    crown of rejoicing.          Christian experience teaches faith in the right and dis-         belief in the wrong. It bids us work the more earnestly 29:9    in times of persecution, because then our labor is more         needed. Great is the reward of self-sacrifice, though we         may never receive it in this world.                            The Fatherhood of God  29:12   There is a tradition that Publius Lentulus wrote to         the authorities at Rome: \"The disciples of Jesus be-         lieve him the Son of God.\" Those instructed 29:15   in Christian Science have reached the glori-         ous perception that God is the only author of man.         The Virgin-mother conceived this idea of God, and 29:18   gave to her ideal the name of Jesus - that is, Joshua,         or Saviour.                            Spiritual conception          The illumination of Mary's spiritual sense put to 29:21   silence material law and its order of generation, and         brought forth her child by the revelation of         Truth, demonstrating God as the Father of 29:24   men. The Holy Ghost, or divine Spirit, overshadowed         the pure sense of the Virgin-mother with the full recog-         nition that being is Spirit. The Christ dwelt forever 29:27   an idea in the bosom of God, the divine Principle of the         man Jesus, and woman perceived this spiritual idea,         though at first faintly developed.  29:30   Man as the offspring of God, as the idea of Spirit,         is the immortal evidence that Spirit is harmonious and         man eternal. Jesus was the offspring of Mary's self- 30:1    conscious communion with God. Hence he could give         a more spiritual idea of life than other men, and could 30:3    demonstrate the Science of Love - his Father or divine         Principle.                            Jesus the way-shower          Born of a woman, Jesus' advent in the flesh partook 30:6    partly of Mary's earthly condition, although he was en-         dowed with the Christ, the divine Spirit, with-         out measure. This accounts for his struggles 30:9    in Gethsemane and on Calvary, and this enabled him to         be the mediator, or /way-shower/, between God and men.         Had his origin and birth been wholly apart from mortal 30:12   usage, Jesus would not have been appreciable to mortal         mind as \"the way.\"          Rabbi and priest taught the Mosaic law, which said: 30:15   \"An eye for an eye,\" and \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood,         by man shall his blood be shed.\" Not so did Jesus, the         new executor for God, present the divine law of Love, 30:18   which blesses even those that curse it.                               Rebukes helpful          As the individual ideal of Truth, Christ Jesus came to         rebuke rabbinical error and all sin, sickness, and death,- 30:21   to point out the way of Truth and Life. This         ideal was demonstrated throughout the whole         earthly career of Jesus, showing the difference between 30:24   the offspring of Soul and of material sense, of Truth and         of error.          If we have triumphed sufficiently over the errors of 30:27   material sense to allow Soul to hold the control, we         shall loathe sin and rebuke it under every mask. Only         in this way can we bless our enemies, though they 30:30   may not so construe our words. We cannot choose for         ourselves, but must work out our salvation in the way         Jesus taught. In meekness and might, he was found 31:1    preaching the gospel to the poor. Pride and fear are unfit         to bear the standard of Truth, and God will never place 31:3    it in such hands.                            Fleshly ties temporal          Jesus acknowledged no ties of the flesh. He said: \"Call         no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, 31:6    which is in heaven.\" Again he asked: \"Who         is my mother, and who are my brethren,\" im-         plying that it is they who do the will of his Father. We 31:9    have no record of his calling any man by the name of         /father/. He recognized Spirit, God, as the only creator, and         therefore as the Father of all.                               Healing primary  31:12   First in the list of Christian duties, he taught his fol-         lowers the healing power of Truth and Love. He attached         no importance to dead ceremonies. It is the 31:15   living Christ, the practical Truth, which makes         Jesus \"the resurrection and the life\" to all who follow him         in deed. Obeying his precious precepts, - following his 31:18   demonstration so far as we apprehend it, - we drink of         his cup, partake of his bread, are baptized with his pu-         rity; and at last we shall rest, sit down with him, in a full 31:21   understanding of the divine Principle"]]]
