TAYLOR   A small collection of Mexican reptiles and amphibians recently acquired by the University of Kansas Natural History Museum contains five specimens of a species of the genus _Hyla_ (_sensu lato_) which is here described as new.   ~Hyla proboscidea~ sp. nov.  _Type._--University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, No. 23626, collected 2 km. west of Jico, Veracruz, Mexico, at an elevation of 4,200 ft., Oct. 28, 1946, by Walter W. Dalquest.  _Paratypes._--Nos. 23624, 23625, 23627, 23628, collected with the type.  _Diagnosis._--A medium sized member of the genus with known maximum length of male, 57 mm. Canthus rostralis well defined; tip of snout with a bulbous projection; fingers more than one-third webbed, foot nearly completely webbed; tympanum distinct; skin smooth above, granular below; very prominent inner metatarsal tubercle, small outer tubercle; tibiotarsal articulation reaches to nostril; a well-defined outer tarsal fold; anal opening ventral, covered by a free triangular flap; pupil of eye horizontal.  _Description of the type._--Head longer than broad, the distance between the eye and nostril slightly greater than distance between nostril and tip of snout; canthus rostralis sharply defined, continued to above nostril; upper part of loreal region sloping abruptly, lower part sloping more gently to edge of lip; area in front of nostril somewhat swollen, the nostril large, directed strongly backward; tip of snout forming a short rounded proboscis; upper jaw rather strongly overhanging lower jaw.  Width of an upper eyelid contained in interorbital distance about 1-1/3 times; horizontal diameter of eye about equal to distance between eye and nostril, about 1-1/3 times diameter of tympanum; tympanum distinct, its distance from orbit equal to its diameter, overhung by a glandular fold running back from eye.  Choanae large; vomerine teeth in two elevated patches which lie between, and reach the posterior level, of choanae, the patches closer to each other than to choanae; tongue rather small, subcircular, not or but very indistinctly notched behind, not at all free behind; opening to vocal sacs behind level of tongue, the openings a short slit directed backwards. (Vocal sacs not evident externally in type or paratypes.)  Skin of dorsal surfaces generally smooth (under magnification surface minutely corrugated and wrinkled); ventral surface of abdomen, the thighs, and lower part of lateral surface of body strongly granulate, the granules unequal in size and elevation; breast, chin, and under side of arm with sparse granules or tubercles.  Anal opening ventral, covered by a small, free, triangular flap; a small thickened fold, slightly free, on each side of anus partly covered by triangular flap.  [Illustration: _Measurements_ (in mm.).--Snout to vent, 58; leg, 86; head length, 20; head width, 18.6.]  Arms rather short, upper arm slender, forearm much thickened; a small axillary web present; disks on three outer fingers distinctly larger than tympanum, of first finger equal to or somewhat smaller than tympanum; outer fingers, between one-third and one-half webbed; on inner fingers webbing less than one-third; first finger more or less opposed to other three, its base widened, and the upper surface covered by a large patch of minute dark, horn-colored nuptial asperities, that extend to near the terminal disk; subarticular tubercles strongly elevated with numerous supernumerary tubercles on palm; a somewhat enlarged elevated palmar tubercle; under surface of forearm with a row of distinct tubercles; other smaller scattered granules present. Toes more than four-fifths webbed, the membrane reaching the base of the terminal disks, on one side at least, of all toes save fourth; subarticular tubercles strongly elevated, with numerous supernumerary tubercles on sole; a large elevated inner metatarsal tubercle; a small outer tubercle; a continuous, well-defined, tarsal fold extending entire length of tarsus. Tibiotarsal articulation reaches nostril when leg is brought forward.  _Color and marking._--General color of type (preserved in formalin, then transferred to alcohol) dull grayish purple, darker anteriorly and somewhat lighter and more mottled posteriorly; color very much lighter on sides with a few cream, dark-edged spots in groin and on sides of abdomen; front and back surfaces of thigh and shank with some darker and lighter flecking that is continued more or less on the foot. When submerged in water, very dim dark spots or bars visible on limbs; ventral surface dirty brownish flesh, without markings.  _Variation._--The series consists of five adult male specimens. It is presumed that the female is considerably larger, and may lack the nasal proboscis which I suspect is a secondary sexual character.  There are some differences in the shade of coloring in the preserved specimens, some being darker, some lighter than the type. In two the lateral dark-edged, cream spots extend to the axilla, and the light and dark markings on the front and back surfaces of the leg are much more distinct in most of the specimens than in the type. When the specimens are submerged in water, the black bars on the limbs are evident in all specimens. The tympanum is sometimes darker, sometimes lighter than its surroundings.  In the field notes of Mr. Dalquest I find the statement that the color in life is bright yellow, which presumably applies to all of the specimens. No trace of this color remains at the present time.  The ventral granules of some of the paratypes are very unequal in elevation, some being elongated, nipplelike.  The following table gives the variation in measurements of the type and paratypes:   Measurements of _Hyla proboscidea_ in mm.  =======+=======+========+=======+=====+=====+==========+==========        | Snout |        |       |     |     | Foot and |        |  to   |  Head  | Head  | Arm | Leg | longest  |   Eye        | vent  | length | width |     |     |   toe    | diameter -------+-------+--------+-------+-----+-----+----------+---------- 23626  |  58   |  20    | 18.6  | 29  | 86  |   39     |    5 23625  |  56   |  19    | 18    | 29  | 81  |   37     |    5 23627  |  53   |  18.5  | 17    | 30  | 81  |   35     |    5 23624  |  50   |  16.8  | 15.5  | 26  | 70  |   29.8   |    5 23628  |  50   |  17    | 16    | 28  | 71  |   30     |    5 -------+-------+--------+-------+-----+-----+----------+----------  _Relationship._--It would appear that the relationship of this species is with _Hyla bistincta_, a widespread Mexican species likewise occurring in the same general area but at a much higher elevation. It also has an elongated flap which carries the anal opening nearly to the level of venter but the terminal part lacks the triangular flap. There is no prolongation of the snout tip. There are also numerous other differences, so that it would be difficult to confuse the two forms.  _Remarks._--This adds another very distinctive species to the Veracrucian fauna. Despite the fact that this state has probably been explored at greater length than any other Mexican state it still is a likely place for the discovery of novelties.       _Transmitted April 8, 1948._"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34340"],["title","Three New Beavers from Utah (#0)"],["body","New Beavers from Utah  By  STEPHEN D.

Words surrounded by underscores, like _this_, signifies words in italics.]     Three New Beavers from Utah  By  STEPHEN D. DURRANT AND HAROLD S. CRANE   The subspecific identity of beavers from Utah seems never to have been carefully investigated. With the exception of the name _Castor canadensis repentinus_ applied to animals from Zion and Parunuweap canyons by Presnall (1938:14), all other writers from 1897 until the present time, have used for animals from Utah, the name combination _Castor canadensis frondator_ Mearns, the type of which is from Sonora, Mexico. Study of specimens of beavers from Utah, accumulated in the collections of the Museum of Zo√∂logy, University of Utah, proves these animals to be far more variable than formerly supposed, and discloses the existence of three hitherto unnamed kinds, which are named and described below.  We recognize the need for caution in proposing new names for American beavers, because the transplanting of these animals from one watershed to another may have permitted the animals of a given area to change genetically, say, through hybridization, and may also have altered the geographic distribution of the several kinds. The officials of the Utah State Fish and Game Commission have assured us that such transplants have not occurred in the areas where these three new kinds are found, and further that nowhere in the state have transplants been made from one major drainage system to another; such transplants as have been made were only within the same major drainage system.  The capitalized color terms used in this paper are after Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912. All measurements are in millimeters. We are indebted to the officials of the United States National Museum for the loan of comparative materials.   ~Castor canadensis pallidus~ new subspecies  _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull, number 719, Museum of Zo√∂logy, University of Utah; Lynn Canyon, 7,500 ft., Boxelder County, Utah; September 7, 1932; collected by W. W. Newby.  _Range._--Known only from the Raft River Mountains.  _Diagnosis._--Size small; tail and hind foot short (see measurements). Color (type): Pale, upper parts uniformly Ochraceous-Buff; underfur Snuff Brown; underparts uniformly Light Buff, grading to Light Ochraceous-Buff at base of tail; underfur Light Drab; front and hind feet Light Ochraceous-Buff. Skull: Rostrum short; nasals broad (breadth averaging 54 per cent of length), constricted posteriorly and barely projecting posteriorly beyond premaxillae; zygomatic arches robust, but not widely spreading (zygomatic breadth 77 per cent of basilar length); mastoid breadth 73 per cent of zygomatic breadth; anterolateral margin of orbit narrow (6.2); occipital condyles visible from dorsal view; condylobasal length greater than occipitonasal length; upper incisors narrow (Orange Chrome in color); coronoid processes high and wide; cheek teeth narrow.  _Measurements._--Measurements of the type are as follows: Total length, 1040; length of tail, 380; length of hind foot, 157; length of ear, 35; occipitonasal length, 129.1; basilar length, 116.6; mastoid breadth, 65.6; interorbital breadth, 23.6; length of nasals, 43.3; zygomatic breadth, 89.7; breadth of nasals, 23.4; alveolar length of upper molariform teeth, 30.4.  _Comparisons._--From topotypes and near topotypes of _Castor canadensis taylori_, _C. c. pallidus_ differs as follows: Size smaller; tail and hind foot shorter. Color: Markedly lighter throughout. Skull: Nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent of length of nasals, as opposed to 46 per cent); nasals barely projecting posteriorly beyond premaxillae; rostrum shorter; zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length less; mastoid breadth actually as well as relatively greater; interorbital breadth greater; occipitonasal length shorter rather than longer than condylobasal length; tympanic bullae smaller; coronoid process higher and wider; cheek teeth narrower.  From specimens of _Castor canadensis baileyi_, from 20 miles north northeast of Elko, Elko County, Nevada, _C. c. pallidus_ differs as follows: Body smaller; tail longer; hind foot shorter; ears shorter: Color: Markedly lighter throughout. Skull: Larger; nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent of length of nasals as opposed to 41 per cent); nasals barely projecting posteriorly beyond premaxillae; rostrum broader; zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length less; mastoid breadth actually as well as relatively greater; occipitonasal length less rather than greater than condylobasal length; tympanic bullae smaller; coronoid process higher and wider; cheek teeth narrower.  From one topotype and two specimens of _Castor canadensis repentinus_, from the Colorado River at Yuma, Yuma County, Arizona, _C. c. pallidus_ differs as follows: Tail and hind foot shorter. Color: Lighter throughout. Skull: Narrower; nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent of length of nasals as opposed to 47 per cent); nasals barely projecting posteriorly beyond premaxillae; rostrum shorter; zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length less; mastoid breadth actually as well relatively greater; tympanic bullae narrower and smaller; coronoid process higher and wider; cheek teeth narrower.  From one specimen of _Castor canadensis concisor_, from Trappers Lake, Garfield County, Colorado, and from the original description of that subspecies (Warren and Hall, 1939: 358), _C. c. pallidus_ differs as follows: Size smaller. Color: Markedly lighter throughout. Skull: Smaller, narrower; nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent of length of nasals as opposed to 48 per cent); rostrum shorter; zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length less; mastoid breadth relative to zygomatic breadth greater; tympanic bullae narrower and smaller; jugals narrower; distal end of meatal tube smaller; coronoid process shorter and wider; angular process shorter and rounded rather than nearly pointed; cheek teeth narrower.  From the type and near topotypes of _Castor canadensis rostralis_, _C. c. pallidus_ differs as follows: Size smaller; tail and hind foot shorter. Color: Markedly lighter throughout. Skull: Smaller and narrower; rostrum shallower and narrower; posterior end of nasals more constricted and barely projecting posteriorly beyond premaxillae; zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length less; mastoid breadth actually as well as relatively greater; dorsal surface of lacrimal bone larger; tympanic bullae narrower; coronoid process higher and wider; angular process not projecting so far caudad; cheek teeth narrower.  From the type and near topotypes of _Castor canadensis duchesnei_, _C. c. pallidus_ differs as follows: Size smaller; tail and hind foot shorter. Color: Lighter throughout. Skull: Shorter, narrower and less massive; nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent of length of nasals as opposed to 46 per cent); nasals barely projecting posteriorly beyond premaxillae; rostrum shorter and narrower; zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length less; mastoid breadth actually as well as relatively greater; tympanic bullae narrower and smaller; coronoid process higher and wider; angular process not projecting so far caudad; cheek teeth narrower.  _Remarks._--The Raft River Mountains of extreme northwestern Utah, where _C. c. pallidus_ occurs, are the only mountains of the state within the drainage of the Snake River. The Snake River proper lies 50 miles to the northward in Idaho and contains another kind of beaver, _C. c. taylori_ (Davis, 1939: 273). Although occurring within the same drainage as _C. c. taylori_, _C. c. pallidus_ is as distinct from it as from any other named kind. The relationships of _C. c. pallidus_, as indicated by the short rostrum and short, wide nasals, are rather more with _C. c. rostralis_ of the Wasatch Mountains, than with _C. c. taylori_.  The pale color of the animals belonging to _C. c. pallidus_ was noted at the time of capture, and is the same in the young specimen (625 mm. total length) as in the type, an adult.       _Specimens examined._--Total, 2, distributed as follows:      _Boxelder County_: Raft River, 5 mi. S Yost, Raft River      Mountains, 6,000 ft., 1; Lynn Canyon, Raft River Mountains,      7,500 ft., 1.   ~Castor canadensis rostralis~ new subspecies  _Type._--Male, young adult, skin and skull, number 5199, Museum of Zo√∂logy, University of Utah; Red Butte Canyon, Fort Douglas, 5,000 ft., Salt Lake County, Utah; October 13, 1947; collected by Harold S. Crane and Clifton M. Greenhalgh, original number 446 of Crane.  _Range._--Known from the western streams of the Wasatch Mountains; probably occurs in all streams draining westward into the basin of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville.  _Diagnosis._--Size large; tail and hind foot long (see measurements). Color (type): Upper parts Snuff Brown, purest on head; underfur Brownish Black (2); base of tail Cinnamon Buff; hind feet Carob Brown; ears Blackish Brown (2); underparts Auburn, grading posteriorly to Cinnamon Buff; underfur Light Drab. Skull: Large, massive; nasals short and broad (breadth averaging 54 per cent of length) and moderately convex transversely; rostrum deep and broad; ventral surface of rostrum moderately"]]]
