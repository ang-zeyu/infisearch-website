DUELLMAN   The systematic status of the populations of lizards assignable to _Cnemidophorus sacki_ in western México (Sonora southward to Jalisco) has been reviewed in detail by Zweifel (1959, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist, 117 (2):57-116), who stated that the use of the specific name _sacki_ for the western populations rests upon a reasonable, but as yet unproved, assumption that intergradation occurs. Although Zweifel examined specimens of the nominal subspecies from the upper Balsas Basin, he did not study specimens from the intervening area--the Tepalcatepec Valley in Michoacán.  Field studies and the examination of large series of preserved specimens of _Cnemidophorus_ from the Tepalcatepec Valley show the presence of _Cnemidophorus sacki_ in the region between the ranges of _C. sacki sacki_ in the upper Balsas Basin and _C. sacki occidentalis_ in Jalisco and southern Nayarit. Furthermore, the populations of _sacki_ inhabiting the Tepalcatepec Valley have characters of scutellation and coloration that distinguish them from other described subspecies of _sacki_. In recognition of the important contributions to the systematics of the genus _Cnemidophorus_ made by Dr. Richard G. Zweifel, I propose that the subspecies of _Cnemidophorus sacki_ in the Tepalcatepec Valley be named as follows:                +Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli+ new subspecies  _Holotype._--University of Michigan Museum of Zoology No. 119542, from Capirio, Michoacán, México (185 meters), an adult male, one of a series collected on June 13, 1958, by William E. Duellman, Jerome B. Tulecke, and John Wellman. Original number WED 12310.  _Paratopotypes._--UMMZ Nos. 119536-119541 and 119543-119550.  _Diagnosis._--A race of _Cnemidophorus sacki_ characterized by large size (more than 130 mm. snout-vent length in males), approximately 106 dorsal granules around the midbody, about 41 femoral pores, and a dorsal color-pattern in adult males consisting of lateral and dorsolateral rows of spots, paravertebral rows fused with middorsal light green area at least anteriorly, and pink throat having a median light blue spot or transverse band.  _Description of Holotype._--Snout-vent length, 128 mm.; tail length, 252 mm.; tail/body ratio, 1.97; scutellation typical of _sacki_--four supraoculars, enlarged postantebrachials, and enlarged mesoptychials; 107 granules around midbody (excluding enlarged ventrals); 45 femoral pores; three enlarged preanal scales; supraorbital semicircle-series extending anteriorly to posterior edge of frontal (Fig. 1).       [Illustration: Top View Head - Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli]  ~Fig. 1.~ Top view of the head of the holotype of _Cnemidophorus sacki     zweifeli_ (UMMZ 119542) showing scutellation. ×5.   Top of head and nape dusty brown; tip of rostral and lateral edges of superciliaries dark cream-color; upper labials and sides of head anterior to eyes cream-color, mottled with blue; lower labials and postocular region pale blue; mental, postmental, and sublabials cream-color. Upper surfaces of forelimbs dull bluish gray, spotted with pale greenish yellow; dorsal surfaces of proximal one-fourth of tail light brownish gray turning to pale orange-brown posteriorly; lateral surfaces of tail bluish gray anteriorly and creamy brown posteriorly. Nuchal region light bluish gray; flanks dark gray; dorsal ground-color dark brown, somewhat paler posteriorly. Body having a row of cream-colored spots in place of a lateral stripe, and another row in place of dorsolateral stripe; dorsally, large diffuse tan or light green spots partially fused and tending to form irregular transverse markings. Chin to posterior end of sublabials pale pink, bordered posteriorly by bluish white area, and then pink. Mesoptychials, under surfaces of hind limbs, and belly cream-colored; anterior edges of belly scales dark blue; lateral two rows of ventrals on posterior two-thirds of body dark blue having light blue or cream-colored spots. Under surfaces of forelimbs bluish cream; ventral surface of tail cream-colored.  _Variation in Size and Scutellation._--The largest male has a snout-vent length of 132 mm., the largest female, 114 mm., and the smallest juvenile, 34 mm. The number of dorsal granules at the midbody varies from 91 to 117 (106.2 ± 0.43); the ratio of the number of granules between the paravertebral stripes to the number of granules around the body (PV/GAB) varies from 0.064 to 0.157 (0.097 ±0.007); the number of femoral pores varies from 32 to 49 (41.1 ± 0.20). Usually there are only three enlarged preanals, but 18 specimens have a somewhat enlarged scale anterior to the normal complement of three. In 15 specimens the supraorbital semicircle-series terminate short of the posterior edge of the frontal; in the others the series reach the frontal.  _Variation in Coloration._--The coloration of juveniles and subadults varies little; large adults vary considerably especially in the amount of diffusion of the light green middorsal area. In some individuals the vertebral pale area does not include the paravertebral spots; in other individuals the pale area includes not only the paravertebral rows, but, at least anteriorly, the dorsolateral rows. In large males of about equal size (and collected at the same time) there is considerable variation in the amount of blue on the belly. In a few of the males the belly is white with only the anterior edge of each scale blue; in some only the lateral rows of ventrals on the posterior two-thirds of the body are blue; in others all of the posterior two-thirds of the belly is blue.  _Ontogenetic Change in Color Pattern._--The metamorphosis of color pattern in _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_ results in the dorsal ground-color becoming paler with age, the replacement of the stripes by spots, and finally in large males the suffusion of these spots.  A single hatchling (UMMZ 114732) is available; this specimen has a prominent umbilical scar and a snout-vent length of 34 mm. The top of the head is olive brown; the dorsal surfaces of the limbs are dark brown with cream mottling; the dorsal ground-color is brownish black; this is paler on the lower flanks. The lateral and dorsolateral stripes are cream-colored; the paravertebral stripes are white. There is a faint, diffuse vertebral stripe anteriorly (Fig. 2 A). The throat and undersides of the limbs and tail are cream-colored; the belly is bluish white. In life the stripes were pale yellowish green, and the tip of the tail was pink.  In larger individuals the dorsal ground-color is dark brown; the lower flanks are grayish tan. Light brown diffuse spots are present in the lateral and dorsolateral dark fields. The tan vertebral stripe is diffuse and nearly fills the paravertebral dark fields; the paravertebral stripes are faint posteriorly; throughout their length they are scalloped--the beginning of their fragmentation into spots (Fig. 2 B).  In subadults (± 80 mm. snout-vent length) the paravertebral stripes are fragmented into spots posteriorly. Also, the dorsolateral stripes in some individuals are fragmented posteriorly. The dorsolateral dark fields are somewhat paler than the lateral dark fields. Cream-colored spots are present on the flanks. The mottling on the thighs tends towards the formation of light spots (Fig. 2 C).  In small adults (± 100 mm. snout-vent length) the paravertebral stripes are entirely fragmented into spots. The lateral and dorsolateral stripes are broken into spots posteriorly. The middorsal pale area (formed by the suffusion of the vertebral stripe) and paravertebral and dorsolateral rows of spots are pale green. The cream-colored spots on the flanks are expanded to form vertical bars (Fig. 2 D).  Large adult males (± 120 mm. snout-vent length) have all of the stripes fragmented into spots. The diffuse middorsal area is expanded and encloses the paravertebral rows of spots. The pale spots present in the dark fields in smaller individuals are either absent or fused with spots resulting from the fragmentation of the stripes (Fig. 2 E).  _Sexual dimorphism._--Males attain a larger size (known maximum snout-vent length of 132 mm., as compared with 114 mm. in females). Males have larger but not more numerous, femoral pores, blue bellies, and pink and blue throats, whereas females are unicolor creamy white ventrally. The more nearly complete metamorphosis of color pattern exhibited by adult males probably is correlated with their large adult size. Large females retain complete lateral and dorsolateral stripes. The jowls of breeding males are swollen.

However, lizards from eastern Michoacán (Chinapa, 6 km. N of Tafetan, 6 km. S of Tzitzio, and 19 km. S of Tzitzio) differ slightly from those from the Tepalcatepec Valley; the eastern specimens have fewer dorsal granules and femoral pores, and a higher ratio of dorsal granules between the paravertebral stripes to the number of granules around the body (see Tables 1-3). No large adult males are present in the eastern series; the subadults and small adult males have color patterns like lizards of similar size from the Tepalcatepec Valley. The largest male from the east has a snout-vent length of 110 mm., rows of pale spots, and no trace of brown and tan cross-bars. Specimens of _Cnemidophorus sacki sacki_ of equal size from Guerrero, Morelos, and Puebla in the upper Balsas Basin have a tan dorsum with dark brown cross-bars. The localities in eastern Michoacán are intermediate geographically between the Tepalcatepec Valley and the known range of the nominal subspecies in the upper Balsas Basin. In characters of scutellation specimens from the east are intermediate between _C. sacki sacki_ and _C. sacki zweifeli_ in the Tepalcatepec Valley. However, in coloration the lizards from the east are like those from the Tepalcatepec Valley, but differ distinctly from the nominal subspecies. Therefore, the eastern series is referred to the subspecies _C. sacki zweifeli_.  _Comparisons._--Four other species of _Cnemidophorus_ occur in the Tepalcatepec Valley with _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_. Of these, _C. calidipes_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 79 mm., 66 to 86 dorsal granules, and a light brown dorsum with pale blue spots and vertical bars; _C. communis communis_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 135 mm., 105 to 144 dorsal granules, and a greenish tan dorsum with yellow spots; _C. deppei infernalis_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 84 mm., 91 to 120 dorsal granules, and a striped pattern throughout life; and _C. lineatissimus exoristus_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 98 mm., 108 to 135 dorsal granules, and a middorsal yellow stripe and vertical bars on the flanks. Both _calidipes_ and _communis_ are like _sacki_ in possessing four enlarged supraoculars and enlarged postantebrachials, whereas _deppei_ and _lineatissimus_ have three enlarged supraoculars and granular postantebrachials. Juveniles of _calidipes_ and _sacki_ are alike in coloration but different in the extent of the supraorbital semicircle-series. In _calidipes_ the supraorbital semicircle-series usually are complete, whereas in _sacki_ the series never extended anterior to the posterior edge of the frontal.     ~Table 1.--Variation in the Number of Dorsal Granules            in Three Subspecies of Cnemidophorus sacki~  Key for Table:    No. = Number of Specimens  SD = Standard Deviation    SE  = Standard Error   C/V = Coefficient of Variation  /======================================================================\\ |   ~Population~           | No. |  Range  | Mean |  SD  |  SE  | C/V  | |--------------------------+-----+---------+------+------+------+------| |_sacki sacki_             |     |         |      |      |      |      | |   Entire Sample          | 106 |  88-105 | 96.3 | 4.16 | 0.40 | 3.92 | |   Puebla: Tehuitzingo    |  22 |  88-103 | 95.1 | 4.18 | 0.89 | 4.39 | |   Guerrero: Chilpancingo |  23 |  90-105 | 95.8 | 3.86 | 0.80 | 4.02 | |   Guerrero: Mexcala      |  22 |  90-102 | 96.5 | 3.56 | 0.76 | 3.69 | |   Morelos                |  39 |  89-105 | 97.2 | 4.56 | 0.73 | 4.69 | |                          |     |         |      |      |      |      | |_sacki zweifeli_          |     |         |      |      |      |      | |   Entire Sample          | 191 |  91-117 | 106.2| 5.98 | 0.43 | 3.13 | |   Michoacán: Tafetan     |  21 |  91-116 | 101.4| 8.04 | 1.75 | 7.92 | |   Michoacán: Apatzingán  | 170 |  95-117 | 106.8| 5.42 | 1.32 | 3.19 | |                          |     |         |      |      |      |      | |_sacki occidentalis_[A]   |  62 |  97-118 | 106.3| 4.72 | 0.60 | 7.61 | \\======================================================================/  [Footnote A: Data for _C. sacki occidentalis_ in Tables 1-3 are from Zweifel (1959, Bull.

Both _occidentalis_ and _zweifeli_ have variable, diffuse color patterns in large adults, but _zweifeli_ differs from _occidentalis_ in having a blue spot on the pink throat.  _Ecology._--In the arid Tepalcatepec Valley _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_ lives at elevations of 160 to 1300 meters. In the lower parts of the valley the lizards live primarily in open scrub forests, characterized by deciduous trees offering only partial shade from the sun, especially during the prolonged dry season. Common trees in this scrub forest are _Acacia cymbispina_, _Cercidium plurifoliolatum_, _Mimosa distachya_, and _Prosopis juliflora_.  During the dry season (November through May) adult males apparently aestivate; several large series collected in the winter include only subadults and females. This absence of males is corroborated by personal observations in the Tepalcatepec Valley in April and May. In the summer rainy season the lizards are active in the morning and again in the late afternoon; only _Cnemidophorus calidipes_ is active during the heat of the midday. In some areas of the scrub forest _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_ is found in association with _Cnemidophorus communis communis_. Throughout the scrub forest _C. sacki zweifeli_ occurs with _C. deppei infernalis_. In some of the more dense scrub forest, where _C. sacki zweifeli_ is not so abundant as in the more open forest, it has been taken with _C. lineatissimus exoristus_. In the open _Acacia-Cercidium_ associations on the valley floor _C. sacki zweifeli_ occurs with _C. calidipes_.  This subspecies is not restricted to the scrub forest. On the lower slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica in Michoacán _C. sacki zweifeli_ has been collected in open pine-oak forest near Zirimicuaro and Ziracuaretiro.  _Distribution._--_Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_ inhabits the valley of the Río Tepalcatepec in Michoacán and probably extreme southwestern Jalisco, and the western part of the Balsas Basin in Michoacán. No specimens have been seen from extreme western"]]]
