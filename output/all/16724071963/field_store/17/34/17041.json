Cages of experimental animals began arriving along with several additional specialists. Ebert Industrial Labs, contrite over the original information leak, made available their electron microscope, and Murt assigned the new toxicologist to work over there with Feldman, the bacteriologist, studying ways to weaken or destroy the virus.  Stitchell, the endocrinologist, and a trio of psychologists from the State University began injecting monkeys with virus when Feldman found he could propagate it in sterile medium.  On September 12, 1961, Dr. Sylvester Murt became a victim of the virus which bore his name.         *       *       *       *       *  He had slept poorly and he awakened feeling empty. His first dismal thought was that Phyl wouldn't be at the hospital this morning. He had told her to spend a few hours down at Ebert Labs, getting notes on their progress.  As he shaved, dressed and breakfasted, this thought preyed on his mind. It wasn't until he had put in half the morning clock-watching and door-gazing that he stepped outside his wretchedness and took an objective look at his feelings.  It wasn't that he missed her help--he had plenty of personnel at his disposal now. He simply longed for the sight of her, for the sound of her voice and her heels clipping busily around his office-lab.  _Here we go again_, he thought, and then he came up short. The feeling was similar to the silly evening of infatuation he had allowed himself, but it was intensified tenfold. The burn in his stomach was almost painful. He caught himself sighing like a frustrated poet, and he grew to hate the sight of the hall door, through which she kept right on not appearing.  When she failed to show up by 11:30, and he gagged over his lunch, he knew he was sick.  He had Murt's Virus!  Now what? Did knowing you had it make it any easier? Easier to make a damned fool of himself, he supposed. He'd have to take hold of himself or he'd scare her off the grounds.  At the thought of her leaving him for good, something like a dull crosscut saw hacked across his diaphragm, and he dropped his forkful of potato salad.  Back at his office, he diluted 30 cc of pure grain alcohol with water and swallowed it. Some of the distress and anxiety symptoms were relieved, and he bent determinedly to his work.  When her distinctive steps finally came through the door, he refused to raise his head from the binocular microscope. \"How are they making out over there?\" he mumbled.  \"It's slow,\" she said, dropping her notes on his desk. \"They're halfway through the sulfas so far. No results yet.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Relief at having her near him again was so great, it was almost frightening. But he gained equal pleasure from finding his self-control adequate to keep from raising his head and devouring her with his eyes.  \"Sylvester,\" her voice came from behind his stool, \"if you don't mind, I'd rather not go over there again.\"  \"Why not?\"  Her voice was strangely soft. \"Because I--I missed....\"  At that instant, her hand rested on his shoulder and it sent a charge of high voltage through him. He stiffened.  \"_Don't do that!_\" he said sharply.  He could see her reflection dimly in the window glass. She took a step backward. \"What's the matter, Sylvester?\"  He fought back the confusion in his brain, considered explaining that he was making a fine adjustment on the scope. But he didn't. He turned and let her have it. \"Because I've got the virus,\" he said in a flat voice. \"And the object of my affection--or infected, overstimulated glands--is _you_!\"  \"Oh, dear! That blonde at the restaurant....\" Phyl's face was pale, but she composed her features quickly. \"Do you want me to leave?\"  \"Lord no! That magnifies the symptoms. Stay with me and--and just be yourself. I won't bother you. If I lay a finger on you, clobber me.\"  \"Have you had your blood tested?\"  \"I don't have to. I've got all the symp--\"  He broke off, realizing that he was taking for granted that the new virus _was_ the cause of his feeling. Clinically, this was nowhere near proved yet. Slowly he rolled up his sleeve above the elbow. He dipped a swatch of gauze in alcohol and swabbed a vein.  \"All right, Phyl, you're the doctor. Make with the syringe.\"         *       *       *       *       *  By nightfall, Murt came to understand the reasons for the increase in industrial accidents, absenteeism and the rest of the social effects of the \"mild\" epidemic. Phyllis Sutton was in his mind constantly. He deliberately did not look at her. But he was aware of her every movement, the texture and shape of her hand when she handed him a slide, the scent of her powder, the sound of her heels.  When she left the room, he found himself awaiting her return and conjecturing on what she was doing every moment. Not that it was difficult to adjust his behavior--no, that was relatively easy. All he had to do was think about every remark he made to her, censoring word, inflection and tone of voice--and, by keeping his back to her, it was easy to prevent his eyes from darting glances at her profile and staring at the curve of her hip below the tight belt.  By staying busy, he fought off the depression until he left for the club, when it closed in on him like an autumn fog. He stopped at the club bar.  Curly, the bald-headed bartender, eyed him curiously when he ordered a double Scotch.  \"Heavy going down at the hospital these days?\" Curly asked.  Murt envied him his relaxed, carefree expression. He nodded. \"Pretty busy. I suppose you're catching it, too. Lot of people drowning their sorrows these days?\"  Curly looked up at the clock. \"You said it! In about a half hour, the place'll be loaded. This epidemic is going to run the distilleries dry if it doesn't end pretty soon.\"  \"Does liquor help any?\"  \"Seems to--a little. It's the damnedest thing! Everybody's in love with the wrong people--I mean ten times as bad as usual. Of course, not everybody. Take my wife--she's got it bad, but she's still in love with _me_. So it could be worse.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"What do you mean?\" Murt asked, raising his head.  \"I mean it's bad enough for the poor woman to have the guy she wants. It's the jealousy angle. Every minute I'm away, she sits at home wondering if I'm faithful. Calls me up six times a shift. I don't dare take her out anyplace. Every time another female comes in sight, she starts worrying. Kate's a damned good wife, always has been, or I wouldn't be putting up with it. That's what's happening to a lot of marriages. Some guys get fed up and start looking around. About that time, the bug bites _them_ and look out, secretary!\"  \"But it's not her fault,\" Murt said emphatically.  \"I know,\" Curly shrugged. \"A lot of people don't make any allowances for it, though. You know Peter, the elevator boy? He and his wife both got it. For a while it was okay, but I guess they finally drove themselves nuts, keeping tabs on each other. Now they can't stand to be together and they can't stand to be apart. Poor joker ran the cage past the basement limit-switch three times today and had to be bailed out of the shaft. Mr. Johnson said he'd fire him if he could get another boy.\"  The implication was shocking to Murt. He had supposed that unhappiness would stem principally from cases of unrequited love, such as his own, but it was apparent that the disease magnified the painful aspects of mutual love as well. Over-possessiveness and jealousy were common reefs of marriage, so it was hardly illogical that the divorce courts were as busy as the marriage license bureaus, after all.         *       *       *       *       *  It helped a little to immerse himself in the troubles of others, but, after another double Scotch, he went to his apartment and immediately fell into despondency. The desire to phone Phyllis was almost overpowering, though he knew talking to her wouldn't help. Instead, he dressed and went to dinner. The club boasted a fine chef, but the food tasted like mucilage.  Later, he went to the bar and drank excessively. Yet he had to take a sedative to get to sleep.  He awoke in a stupor at ten o'clock. His phone was jangling persistently. It was Phyllis Sutton, and her face showed sharp concern.  \"Are you all right, Sylvester?\"  For a moment his hangover dominated, but then it all came back. \"Good morning! I'm _great_!\" he moaned.  \"Stitchell and the new toxicologist think they have something to report,\" she said.  \"So do I. Alcohol is positively not the answer.\"  \"This is important. Your suggestion on the sulfa series seems to have paid off.\"  \"I'll be right over,\" he said, \"as soon as I amputate my head.\"  \"Come down to the zoo. I'll be there.\"  The thought of a remedy that might relieve him was a fair hangover cure. He dressed quickly and even managed to swallow a little coffee and toast.     V   At the hospital, he went directly to the \"zoo\" in the basement. A knot of personnel, including Phyllis, Peterson, the toxicologist, and Feldman, opened to admit him to the cage under their inspection. A quick glance at the control cages showed no change in the undoctored monkeys. Males and females were paired off, huddling together miserably, chattering and sadly rubbing their heads together. Each couple eyed the other couples suspiciously. Even here, the overpossessiveness was evident, and Murt cringed from the pitiful, disconsolate expressions.  The cage before him, however, appeared normally animated. The monks were feeding and playing happily. Feldman was grinning. \"Had to try a new derivative, Sylvester, but the sulfa series was the right approach.\"  Murt stared at the cage, redeyed. \"Hadn't realized you succeeded in producing the symptoms in monkeys.\"  Phyllis said, \"Why, I gave you that report yester--\" She broke off with an understanding glance.  Peterson was exclaiming, \"I never saw"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32748"],["title","Mate in Two Moves (#4)"],["body","a rapid-acting remedy! And so far, there's no evidence of toxic effect.\"  \"It must absorb directly into the gland tissue,\" Feldman added. \"Hardly had time to materially reduce the virus content significantly.\"  Murt murmured words of congratulations to them, turned on his heel and stalked out. Phyllis followed him to his office.  \"Get me some of the stuff and notes on the dosages they administered,\" he ordered.  \"Certainly,\" she said. \"But why didn't you ask--_Dr. Murt, you aren't going to try it on yourself?_\"  \"Why not?\" he barked hoarsely.  \"It'll be weeks before we can determine if it's safe,\" she protested, horrified.  \"We haven't got weeks. People are falling apart. This thing's contagious.\"  Even while Murt said it, he felt it was the wrong approach. He knew his own perspective was shot, but Phyllis would probably try to protect him against himself.  She did not. Instead, her face softened with sympathy and something else he refused to identify. She said, \"I'll be right back.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The pressure in his head throbbed down his neck into his body. He wanted her so much, it was difficult to resist following her out into the hall. She returned in a few minutes with a 500-cc glass-stoppered reagent bottle half full of a milky fluid.  \"Oral administration?\" he asked.  She nodded. \"Fifteen cc for the monkeys.\"  She secured a small beaker and a tapered graduate from the glassware cabinet and set them before him. He poured 50 cc into the graduated measure and transferred it to the beaker.  [Illustration]  \"What do they call it?\" he asked.  \"Sulfa-tetradine,\" she replied. \"One of a series Peterson was testing. There is no physiological data on it yet. All he knows is that it inhibited the virus in culture. So they tried it on the monkeys.\"  Murt raised the beaker to his lips. It was against every sensible tenet of scientific procedure. He was amazed that Phyllis was silent as he swallowed the bland, chalky fluid. He heard a clink. Turning, he saw her raising the graduate to her lips. In it was a like quantity of sulfa-tetradine.  \"What are you doing?\" he half-shouted. \"We don't need a test-control!\"  \"I'm not a control,\" she said softly, touching her lips with a scrap of gauze. \"I've had the virus for months.\"  He stared at her unbelievingly. \"How do you know?\"  \"One of the first test samples was my own blood,\" she said. \"You saw it. It was one of the twelve positive.\"  \"But the symptoms--you don't show a sign of--\"  \"Thanks,\" she said. \"I started to break down yesterday, but you didn't notice. You see, you are my fixation and when you told me that you had it, too, I--\"  \"_Your_ fixation!\" The beaker slipped from his fingers and smashed to the tile. \"_You're in love with me?_\"  Her arms hung loosely at her sides and tears rimmed her eyes. \"Pathologically or otherwise, I've been a case since before I started the blood tests.\"  They moved together and clung to each other. \"Phyl, Phyl--why didn't you tell me?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Fiercely, she closed his lips with her own, and her fingers dug deeply into his shoulders. His arms pulled her closer yet, trying to fill the void in him that was greater than the Universe. For a long minute, the knowledge of her love and physical contact with her straining body dispelled the bleak loneliness.  When their lips parted, they gasped for breath.  It was no good. It was like tearing at an itching insect bite with your fingernails. The relief was only momentary, and it left the wound bleeding and more irritated than ever. Even if they were married--look at Peter at the club--Peter and his wife, mutually in love and completely miserable. It wasn't normal love. It was the damned virus!  As well argue with gravity. He tried to tell her, but he couldn't make her understand. Her restraint had been magnificent, but when the dam broke, it was beyond stopping the flood of her emotion. And now he couldn't believe it himself. Nothing this wonderful could be destroyed by mere misunderstanding. He cursed the years of his celibacy. All that time wasted--lost!  It was six o'clock before they reached her apartment. The License Bureau had been a mob scene. Hours more, upstairs in the City Hall waiting for the judge, while they held hands like a pair of college sophomores, staring into each others' eyes, drinking, drinking the elixir of adoration with a thirst that wouldn't be sated.  Phyllis weakened first. In the cab, after the ceremony, she released his hand and wiped her damp forehead.  Then, in the elevator, Murt felt himself relaxing. The alchemy of sustained passion had exhausted them both, he decided.  As Phyllis slipped the key in the door, she looked up at him in surprise. \"Do you know, I'm hungry. I'm starved--for the first time in months.\"  Murt discovered his own stomach was stirring with a prosaic pangful demand of its own. \"We should have stopped to eat,\" he said, realizing they had forgotten lunch.  \"_Steaks!_ I have some beauties in my freezer!\" Phyllis exclaimed. They peeled off their coats and she led him into the small kitchen. She pointed at the cupboard and silverware drawer. \"Set the table. We'll eat in five minutes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Slipping into an apron, she explored the freezer for meat and French fries, dropped them into the HF cooker and set the timer for 90 seconds. When it clicked off, she was emptying a transparent sack of prepared salad into a bowl.  \"Coffee will be ready in 50 seconds, so let's eat,\" she announced.  For minutes, they ate silently, ravenously, face to face in the little breakfast nook. Murt had forgotten the pure animal pleasure of satisfying a neglected appetite, and so, apparently, had his wife.  _Wife!_ The thought jolted him.  Their eyes met, and he knew that the same thing was in her mind.  The sulfa-tetradine!  With the edge barely off his hunger, he stopped eating. She did, too. They sipped the steaming coffee and looked at each other.  \"I--feel better,\" Phyllis said at last.  \"So do I.\"  \"I mean--I feel differently.\"  He studied her face. It was new. The tenseness was gone and it was a beautiful face, with soft lips and intelligent eyes. But now the eyes were merely friendly.  And it aroused no more than a casual pleasure in him, the pleasure of viewing a lovely painting or a perfect sunset. A peaceful intellectual rapport settled over them, inducing a physical lethargy. They spoke freely of their sensations, of the hypo-adrenal effects, and wondered that there was no unpleasant reaction. They decided that, initially at least, sulfa-tetradine was a miraculous success. Murt thought he should go back to the hospital and work out a report right away.  Phyllis agreed and offered to accompany him, but he said she had better get a night's sleep. The next day would be hectic.  After four hours at his desk, he called a taxi and, without hesitation, gave the address of his club. Not until he fell wearily into bed did he remember it was his wedding night.  By mutual agreement, the marriage was annulled the next day.  Feldman and Peterson were gratified at the efficacy of their drug, but both were horrified that Murt had chosen to experiment on himself. As usual, Phyl had insisted on being left out of the report.         *       *       *       *       *  After a week of close observation, one of the monkeys was chloroformed and tissue-by-tissue examination was made by an army of histologists. Blood samples showed completely clear of the virus, as did a recheck on Murt's own blood. No deleterious effects could be detected, so the results were published through the Government Health Service.  It was the day before Christmas before Dr. Sylvester Murt first noticed the approaching symptoms of a relapse, or reinfection--he couldn't guess which. The past weeks had been pleasantly busy and, as acclaimed authority on Murt's virus, he had had little time to think subjectively about his experience.  Sulfa-tetradine was now considered the specific for the affliction and was being produced and shipped by the carload all over the world. The press had over-generously insisted on giving him all the credit for the remedy as well as the isolation of the disease virus. He was an international hero.  The warning of another attack came to him at 3:30 in the afternoon, when Phyllis Sutton was leaving. She stuck her head back in the door and gave him an uncommonly warm smile and cried, \"Merry Christmas, Doctor!\"  He waved at her and, as the door closed, caught his breath. There was the burn in his stomach again. It passed away and he refused to give it further thought.  His own cab wound its way through the heavy Christmas Eve traffic an hour before store-closing time. Finally, the vehicle stalled in a jam. It was only six blocks to his club, so Murt paid off the driver and walked.  Part of his strategy of bachelorhood had been to ignore Christmas and the other sentimental seasons, when loneliness costs many a man his independence. But now it was impossible to ignore the snowflakes, the bustling, package-laden crowds and the street-corner Santa Clauses with their tinkling bells.         *       *       *       *       *  He found himself staring into department store windows at the gay decorations.  A pair of shimmering, nearly invisible nylons caught his eye. They were the most impalpable of substances, only their bare outline visible against the white background.  He thought of Phyllis and, on impulse, went into the store and bought a pair. The clerk had to pick a size at random for him. Outside, on the sidewalk, he stared at the prettily gift-wrapped package and finally acknowledged the tremor, the tension and the old ache in the region of his diaphragm.  _Relapse!_  He plodded three slushy blocks up a side-street before he found a cab. He gave Phyllis Sutton's address to the driver and sank back in the taxi as a wave of weakness overcame him. What if she weren't home? It was"]]]
