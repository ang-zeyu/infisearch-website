THE BULL-RUN ROUT   A LITTLE paper written years ago by a lately deceased brother of mine[1] describing the rout of the battle of Bull Run as he saw it with the eyes of a boy and a boy's love of the marvellous seems to me to possess some value historically for the intimate, unconscious picturing, along with it, of the state of the public mind on the eve of the so-called \"great uprising.\" It seems to illustrate well the truth that the great Civil War, as a war, was really a surprise,--to the people of the North at least; that the idea persisting up to the day of the battle of Bull Run at the back of the mind of everybody was that in some way the war-cloud would blow over, that the actual shock of contending armies and the pouring out of blood of citizens in civil war would be prevented or in some way avoided. The occasion of the trip to Washington, to carry dainties to a soldier brother, the occasion of the extension of the partly sight-seeing journey to the first battle-field of the great war, the commission from the horror-struck authorities at home to find and bring back from Virginia the body of the first Massachusetts soldier to fall,--all prove the naïveté of the popular conceptions at that time of what it was to enter upon war. This Chelsea boy,[2] whose body my brother was bidden by the mayor of their native place to recover and send home at all costs, was but the first of the fated host of three hundred and sixty thousand young men about to die for their country in the ensuing four years. I remember distinctly the consternation of the community when it was found that the Chelsea company of the First Massachusetts Infantry had been in the sharp action which was the first engagement in the approaching collision of the main armies, and that men had actually been shot and killed. The sickening realization was akin to that feeling my eldest brother[3] in that regiment had confessed to me when I was visiting him at the assembling and training camp at Readville and the new army wagons in their fresh blue paint and white canvas arrived on the scene in long array. \"It looks as though we were really going,\" he remarked ruefully.

I find a pretty complete picture of the psychology of those bewildered and dreadful weeks and months in two speeches of Wendell Phillips in that series of wonderful orations in which he rode the storm seeking to direct it to great issues. Some of these speeches I had the fortune to hear. I have been looking up certain things I heard delivered in that deliberate utterance of his with its polished periods, precise and penetrating as rifle-shots, yet freighted with passion, white-hot with intense conviction. It is only necessary to compare these two speeches of Phillips's to show how men's minds tossed and turned and agonized in those days,--the minds of honest, independent, fearless, conscientious men, too. In a speech of April 9, 1861, at New Bedford, Wendell Phillips was in Cassandra vein. Besides many other epigrammatic deliverances to similar effect, he said:       Inaugurate war, we know not where it will end; we are in      no condition to fight. The South is poor; we are rich.      The poor man can do twice the injury to the rich man      that the rich man can do to the poor. War will start up      every man whose livelihood hangs upon trade,      intensifying him into a compromiser. Those guns fired on      Fort Sumter are only to frighten the North into a      compromise. If the Administration provokes war it is a      trick,--nothing else. It is the masterly cunning of that      devil of compromise, the Secretary of State. He is not      mad enough to let the States run into battle. He knows      that the age of bullets is over. If a gun is fired in      Southern waters it is fired at the wharves of New York,      at the bank-vaults of Boston, at the money of the North.      It is meant to alarm. It is policy, not sincerity.  Thus in New Bedford, April 9; and no wonder that the local reporter records that the lecture was interrupted with frequent hisses. Twelve days later, on a Sunday, April 21, the same day that Fletcher Webster addressed an out-door meeting in State Street, speaking from the Old State House balcony, Phillips addressed an excited, crowded meeting in Music Hall. That day Phillips was the prophet militant. He began by saying that he gave this war a welcome \"hearty and hot.\" He would not recant or retract anything, he said; he needed everything he had been saying to justify so momentous an evil as civil war.       I rejoice before God to-day for every word that I have      spoken counselling peace; but I rejoice also with an      especially profound gratitude, that now, the first time      in my anti-slavery life, I speak under the stars and      stripes, and welcome the tread of Massachusetts men      marshalled for war. No matter what the past has been or      said; to-day the slave asks God for a sight of this      banner, and counts it the pledge of his redemption.      Hitherto it may have meant what you thought, or what I      did; to-day it represents sovereignty and justice. The      only mistake that I have made was in supposing      Massachusetts wholly choked with cotton-dust and      cankered with gold. The South thought her patience and      generous willingness for peace were cowardice; to-day      shows the mistake....       All winter long I have acted with that party which cried      for peace. The anti-slavery enterprise to which I belong      started with peace written on its banner. We imagined      that the age of bullets was over; that the age of ideas      had come; ... The South opened this door [to the      solution] with cannon-shot, and Lincoln shows himself at      the door. The war, then, is not aggressive, but in      self-defence, and Washington has become the Thermopylæ of      Liberty and Justice. Rather than surrender that Capital,      cover every square foot of it with a living body; crowd      it with a million of men, and empty every bank vault at      the North to pay the cost.[4]  [4] W. Phillips, Speeches (Boston, 1884), 396-400.  This speech was surely worth thousands of men to the government, but such is the constitutional cowardice of professional managing politicians that those of that day thought it prudent, for the sake of winning over to loyalty the so-called War Democrats, to have the speech suppressed, and all the docile daily papers did suppress it. It was circulated to the number of a hundred thousand as a supplement extra of the weekly called \"The Anglo-African.\" Even so late as October of that year the Republican State Convention, according to an exultant editorial of the \"Boston Daily Advertiser,\" \"certainly disavowed any intention of endorsing the fatal doctrines announced by Mr. Sumner in that convention,\" and also buried Rev. James Freeman Clarke's resolution in favor of freeing the slaves, as the esteemed contemporary of that day predicted, \"never to rise again.\" By another year the Emancipation proclamation had issued, and three months later Massachusetts idealists speaking through Wendell Phillips could say: \"A blundering and corrupt cabinet has made it at last an inevitable necessity,--Liberty or Death. The cowardice of Webster's followers in the cabinet has turned his empty rhetoric into solemn truth; and now honest men are not only at liberty, but bound to live and die under his motto,--'Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.'\" The country's baffling search to find its ground, its rising determination to yield thus far and no farther, the stand taken at last, the great defeat that first befell, the high idealism, the spirit of the hour,--all are seen in the brief, intimate account written for the family circle at home of the experiences and feelings of one representative Boston youth of twenty, soon after to be a full-fledged three years' man, a hero who rode in the First Massachusetts Cavalry from Virginia to Florida and back again.         *       *       *       *       *  \"The First Massachusetts Infantry was the first regiment to leave the State for three years' service in the national cause; and, indeed, is said to have been the first three years' regiment in the service of the United States.\" To the call from the War Department of May 8, 1861, for volunteers for three years, \"the First Regiment immediately and unanimously responded,\" though the other regiments which had gone from the State were enlisted for three months only. The First left Boston on June 15, 1861, and reached Washington on the 18th, and the next day marched, with the temperature at 90°, to a camp beyond Georgetown and was at once put under strictly military discipline, being there in the enemy's country. It was not till July 16 that the regiment marched into Virginia with three other regiments, and the next night bivouacked at Centreville.  The battle of Blackburn's Ford, July 18, in which the Chelsea soldiers fell, was an affair of outposts, resulting from General McDowell's purpose to \"feel of the enemy.\" It was begun"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32951"],["title","The Bull-Run Rout (#1)"],["body"," shots from the Rebels posted in the woods bordering Bull Run. Both sides were soon at work with artillery. Companies G and H of the First Regiment had advanced through a gully, or dry ravine, leading into Bull Run, until they found themselves exposed to a murderous fire from three different directions. For at least half an hour they remained in this position unable to advance or retreat. The New York Twelfth on their flank fell back, and a general retrograde movement soon followed, with a stand taken at Centreville. The only valuable result of the reconnoissance was the bringing under fire for the first time of some thousands of raw troops. Thirteen men of the First Regiment were killed, and as many more wounded and taken prisoners. Rev. Warren H. Cudworth, chaplain of the regiment, published in 1866 a very full and lively history of its operations.         *       *       *       *       *                            THE BULL-RUN MUSKET.       A single dead soldier of the Union army was an object of      intense public interest up to the date of the battle of      Bull Run in July, 1861.       There were two lads of us who left Boston to visit our      brothers--both of whom were in the army and in the same      company. We expected to find the Army at Washington; and      we each carried a box of dainties to delight our brothers      with. On reaching Washington, we were sorely disappointed      to find that the army had started on its march to      Richmond; and that no civilians were allowed to      follow--not even to cross the Potomac into Virginia. So      there was nothing to do but see the sights in Washington      and return to our homes. But we had been there only two      days when the news came of a fight or skirmish on July      18th at Blackburn's Ford, where several were killed,      and one of the dead was the brother of my companion. It      was a terrible blow to my friend, and a great shock for      me.       We immediately telegraphed home, and at once came the      reply \"Get the body, if you can, and send it home.\" Well,      we two lads went to the War Department and I suppose our      sorrowful tale moved them with compassion, for they gave      each of us a pass to go to the front to get the body of      the dead soldier. I've got that pass stowed away now,      among my papers, as a War curiosity. It reads,       Allow the bearer, Mr. Andrew J. Clement, to pass the      lines and go to the Front for the body of a friend.                                         DRAKE DE KAY                                              _Aid de Camp._       Later in the war, the death of a soldier was of too      little importance to awaken such sympathy at      Headquarters. Indeed, two days later, there were      thousands killed within two miles of the spot where those      killed in this skirmish were buried. After much      difficulty, we hired a light wagon in which my friend      rode, while I got a seat in an army wagon that was taking      out supplies. It was just midnight on Saturday July      20th when we started from Willard's Hotel on      Pennsylvania Avenue. There was a full moon, and the night      was lovely. I was all excitement. I was going to join the      army. I should see my brother, and perhaps I should see      the big battle everybody was talking about as soon to be      fought.       Well, I saw all that I expected to see and a good deal      more. As the horses toiled painfully all that night over      the rough and hilly roads, I little thought that on the      very next night I should be more painfully trudging back      over that very route footsore and weary, a gun on my      shoulder--and ready to fight if the victorious enemy came      up with us. Yet such was the case, and the gun in the      hall is the one that I carried to Washington after the      battle of Bull Run, July 21st, 1861.       Of course the ride that beautiful night was too exciting      for sleep. It was just after daybreak, when we were      taking a hasty breakfast at a small tavern, that we heard      the first boom of a heavy gun. This was the gun that      opened the great battle of Bull Run. We were yet six      miles away from the army--and all were impatient to reach      our destination. The horses were kept at their best      working pace, and when we had gone three miles we met      troops marching towards us. These were certain regiments      that wouldn't fight because the ninety days of their term      of service had just expired. They looked thoroughly      ashamed of themselves, and marched in great disorder. The      officer with our wagon, and the soldier who drove it,      both scoffed at them and called them sneaks and cowards;      and, cowards as they were, they didn't resent the      insults. For myself, I felt as though they all deserved      shooting when they got to Washington.       An hour later we reached Centreville and looked down on      the battle-field. Hastily finding where my friend's dead      brother was buried, I left him to his mournful task of      recovering the corpse while I went to find my own brother      whom I yet hoped to meet alive. But it wasn't an easy      task. The line of battle was long; and, in spite of my      inquiries, I went wrong. I went to the right wing only to      find that the regiment I sought was probably away off on      the left wing. Nobody seemed able to give exact      information, and everybody wanted to know what a boy in      black clothes and a straw hat was doing on the      battle-field. Once I went up and sat down in the rear of      a battery of light artillery to watch the effect of the      firing, and the Capt. drove me off with terrible oaths.      But I went around a small farm house and crept back      again, and saw the grapeshot scatter the \"rebs.\" And so I      went on from point to point, staring and asking      questions, and being stared at and questioned in return.      At length I learned that the regiment I wanted was at the      extreme left. So off I started, already weary from loss      of sleep, excitement and tramping under the hot sun.       Arriving at the left, I again was attracted by a battery      in action, and it was while I stood entranced with      excitement that my brother discovered me. His regiment      was lying in the bush close by supporting this very      battery. Never was a man more surprised than was he at      that moment. He supposed I was at home in Boston. But,      before he would talk, he made me go into the woods and      lie down with the soldiers so as to be in less danger.      And there I crawled around and shook hands with nearly a      hundred men whom I had known all my life. Many were the      questions I answered, and scores of messages were given      me to take home to parents and friends. The boys seemed      very sad--for a member had been killed in this company      only three days before, and they expected to be actively      fighting again at any moment. At length my brother      insisted that I should go back to Centreville out of      danger, and I started with a heavy heart. But secretly I      resolved to try to go to Richmond with the army, for I      felt sure it would only take a few days. Up to that time      it seemed to be victory for us; and I didn't believe it      could possibly be otherwise. So I went back to      Centreville. I was very hungry as well as tired. It was      now past four o'clock in the afternoon.       I soon found a group of sick officers who were about to      dine off of boiled beef close by the army wagon in which      I had come from Washington. They asked me to join them. I      had just got fairly seated when the astounding news came      that our army was defeated and was retreating. I didn't      believe it; but I rushed to the hilltop to see for      myself. Down there on the plain, where I had been in the      morning, there was certainly much dust and confusion.      Just then fresh troops, the reserves, started to go down,      but even to my inexperienced eye it was plain that they      went in bad order and went too late. It was there that I      saw the general who wore two hats--one crushed over the      other--and who was reported in newspaper accounts of the      scene as being very drunk that day. He certainly appeared      decidedly drunk at that moment.       Wild with excitement, I rushed down hill too; but long      before I got where I had been a few hours before, I met      the rush of panic stricken men coming pell-mell from the      field. To resist this rush was impossible and worse than      useless. Wagons driven at full speed came with the men.      Shouted curses filled the air. Wagons broke down, and,      cutting the harnesses, men mounted the horses and rode      off toward Centreville. Muskets were thrown away and      filled the road for a long distance. It was there that I      picked up my gun, begged a pocket full of ammunition, and      resolved to do my share when the terrible Black Horse      Cavalry reached us--for it was reported that they were      coming at full speed. Ere long I reached Centreville      again, and left the rush to look for my wagon. It had      gone, long before, in the grand stampede for Washington.      That didn't worry me much then--I thought I would find my      brother again; and fight in company with the boys I grew      up with. So I waited and waited at Centreville till the      sun got low. I saw at length that it would be useless to      try to find anybody. There were several roads; and all      were full of disorganized troops.       But the first mad rush was over. _All_ the army did not      run. _I_ did not run a step. It was nearly sunset when I      left Centreville; and, as I was terribly hungry, I      stopped, after going about a mile, and joined two of N.      Y. 69th regiment who were having a regular feast out of a      broken down and"]]]
