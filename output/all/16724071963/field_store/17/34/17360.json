The following new species were found in the course of an examination of material in the American Museum of Natural History collected by Dr. F. E. Lutz and Mr. Charles W. Leng in Cuba and by Dr. Lutz in Porto Rico. The types are in that institution.   ~Mecoloesthus signatus~ n. sp.  Cephalothorax pale, with black median mark, wider at head; sternum reddish or yellowish. Abdomen pale, with a black median stripe, narrowed near middle, not reaching anterior end where there is an oblique stripe, and a basal spot each side, also an apical spot each side, and the basal pleura show an oblique dark stripe. These marks are made up of small spots, more or less connected. The venter shows a narrow, median black stripe followed by a round spot, some distance before the spinnerets. Femora reddish, blackish near tip, and a white band at extreme tip; tibiæ dark, with a broad, white band near tip; rest of legs paler. Eyes in two groups, three each side (subequal in size) on a distinct elevation; A. M. E. minute, close together, and as high as upper edge of A. S. E. Abdomen elongate, cylindrical, spinnerets apical; legs very long; vulval area corneous, yellow, concave behind, but little swollen. Length; ceph. 1 mm.; abdomen 2.5 mm.; femur I, 12 mm.; femur IV, 10 mm.  From Naguabo, Porto Rico, March. No. 21669, Dept. Inv. Zoölogy.   ~Callilepsis grisea~ n. sp.

Cephalothorax narrow; eye-rows short and far apart; P. M. E. slightly oval, about three diameters apart and much closer to the larger P. S. E.; legs moderately long, very hairy or bristly, and with stout spines especially on femora III and IV; tibiæ I and II with three spines beneath, one at base, one at middle, one at tip, metatarsi with basal spine only; metatarsi and tarsi scopulate beneath; hind legs more numerously spined; sternum once and a half longer than broad, pointed behind, narrowed in front; abdomen fully twice as long as broad, sides subparallel. Length 6.8 mm.  From 12-1/2 kilometers south of Pinar del Rio, Cuba, September. No. 21670, Dept. Inv. Zoölogy.   ~Wulfila pretiosa~ n. sp.  Pale yellowish. Cephalothorax with a greenish stripe each side, a greenish mark over groove, and two faint lines back from P. M. E.; mandibles with a greenish vertical line in middle. Abdomen with dark greenish or nearly blackish stripe each side reaching to middle, a spot behind it, and a large median spot above spinnerets, four small dark dots in mid-dorsum; legs with faint dark spots at bases of many spines on femora and tibiæ. Cephalothorax narrow in front, A. M. E. hardly more than diameter apart; about as close to the very much larger A. S. E. Posterior eye-row nearly straight, the eyes equal and as large as A. S. E., P. M. E. about two diameters apart, and about as far from P. S. E. Legs long and slender, first and fourth pair about equal, all with stout spines on femora; tibiæ and metatarsi I and II each with two pairs of very long spines, none at tips. The black hair on tips of maxillæ, lip and mandibles is very prominent. Abdomen twice as long as broad. Length 4.5 mm.; leg I, 8 mm.  From San Carlos Est., Guantanamo, Cuba. October. No. 21671, Dept. Inv. Zoölogy.   ~Wulfila immaculata~ n. sp.  White or pale yellowish throughout, unmarked; the eyes on black rings, the claws black, and the anterior edge of the vulva reddish. The A. M. E. small, but little more than their diameter apart, about twice as far from the plainly large A. S. E., P. M. E. nearly three diameters apart, and only about two diameters from the P. S. E. Mandibles with only fine hairs; legs long, and very slender, the first pair more than twice as long as the body, all with very long, slender spines, and fine hairs. Abdomen nearly twice as long as broad; vulva shows two reddish marks in front, and behind is a large indistinct cavity. Length 3 mm.; leg I, 7.5 mm.  Type from 7 kilometers north of Viñales, Cuba, September, No. 21687, Dept. Inv. Zoölogy. Paratypes from Cabanas, Cuba, September; Naguabo, Porto Rico, March; and Mona Island, Feb.

Legs pale yellowish, femora and coxæ more whitish, tibiæ and patellæ I and IV tipped with black. Sternum yellowish, margined with dark. Abdomen above gray, with scattered white spots and larger black patches; a basal black spot each side, and two others each side toward tip, the last larger and extending down on sides to near the spinnerets; a large, oblique, dark spot on pleura, and one near base; venter with a large, median blackish spot, concave in front, dark on sides of genital groove. Legs I and II very long, much longer than others, all with many long, fine but stiff, hairs and some erect bristles on tibiæ, a long one at top of each patella above and one near middle of tibia above.

Eyes small; posterior row recurved, subequal in size, the P. M. E. one half nearer to each other than to the S. E. and about three diameters apart; the four M. E. make a square; A. S. E. smaller than other eyes, close to P. S. E., fully as far from A. M. E. as these from each other. Legs with many fine white bristles, and a few black spines, two on inner side of femur I near tip, no spines in front nor below on femora, nor below on tibiæ I and II, a few above on tibiæ and patellæ, the tarsus plus metatarsus I about as long as tibia plus patella I. Sternum sub-triangular, a little longer than broad, pointed behind. Abdomen fully one and a half times longer than broad, roundedly projecting behind the spinnerets, no higher at base than at spinnerets, and broadest at about middle of length. Length 3 mm.

The legs are pale with spots similar to those on the cephalothorax, many of which have a bristle or spine; no marks on the tarsi, but tibiæ and metatarsis are twice banded with reddish. The coxæ and sternum are pale. The abdomen is rather whitish above, with two rows of five reddish spots near middle, and elsewhere with many reddish dots, from many of which arise short, stout spines like those on the cephalothorax, pleura with red spots; venter with two reddish marks near base, beyond genital furrow with transverse white and black spots; some red around the pale spinnerets. The A. S. E. rather larger than usual; P. M. E. about three diameters apart, about as close to the P. S. E.

S. E. equal to A. S. E., P. M. E. much smaller than A. M. E., fully two and one half diameters apart and as far from the slightly larger P. S. E. Male palpi figured.
