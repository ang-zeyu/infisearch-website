The reality was so different from the anticipation that her heart swelled with the injustice of the thing, and she wept until the fountain of her tears was dry. The housekeeping which was to have been her pleasure served now to distract her mind. She threw herself into it with so much fervor as to extort a remonstrance from Aunt Fannie, the old colored woman who was the head factotum of the kitchen.  \"You all jest a gwine to kill yerse'f,\" she said reprovingly. \"'Tain't no mannah ob use to scrub an' scour twel a fly can't stan' up nowhar. Take hit easy, Miss Bee.\"  \"It's all that I can do for father,\" responded Bee, and the old woman was silenced.  So the days went by. Every morning she saw her father at breakfast, and received his formal greeting as gracefully as she could. The meal over, Doctor Raymond disappeared in his study to be seen no more until evening. He was never a demonstrative man, and his reserve seemed like indifference to his daughter. Beatrice pondered upon his unconcern until she became possessed with the one idea that somehow, some way, she must do something to attract his attention.  \"It's all because I'm not pretty,\" thought the unhappy child one morning when this state of things had gone on for a week. \"I must do something to make him like me; but what?\"  Listlessly she took up her butterfly book and turned the pages idly. All at once her eye was caught by these words:  \"One of the most singular and interesting facts in the animal kingdom is what has been styled mimicry. Certain colors and forms are possessed by animals which adapt them to their surroundings in such wise that they are in a greater or less degree secured from observation and attack....  \"A good illustration of this fact is found in the Disipsus Butterfly, which belongs to a group which is not especially protected, but is often the prey of insect-eating creatures. This butterfly has assumed almost the exact color and markings of the milkweed butterfly, which is distasteful to birds, and hence enjoys peculiar freedom from the attacks of enemies. Because this adaption of one form to another evidently serves the purpose of defense this phenomenon has been called 'protective mimicry.'\"  \"'Protective mimicry,'\" mused the girl thoughtfully, leaning back in her chair and clasping her hands above her head. \"That means if an animal wishes to defend himself from another he just puts on the form of one that his enemy doesn't like. 'Actor bugs,' Professor Lawrence calls them. If that can be done why couldn't any creature put on any form he liked? Wouldn't it be funny if a girl could change her appearance every morning just like she does her dress? I could get up then looking just like Adele. Why!--\"  Bee sat up suddenly, startled by the idea which came to her.  \"Beatrice Raymond,\" she cried, \"you can do it. Why it's done every day. Didn't Emma Drew come back from St. Louis with golden hair when she had gone away with it black? Wasn't Mrs. Simpson's hair red, and then all at once wasn't it black? And the girls are always doing things to their complexions. Why, I can be just like Adele if I wish. Oh, why didn't I think of it sooner? I've lost a whole week.\" And with that she jumped up from the chair, went to the mirror, and surveyed herself critically:  \"I could not change my eyes,\" she mused, \"but I don't believe that would matter. Adele's are sometimes so dark that they seem black. But oh dear! My complexion is horrid, and my hair is so dark! They would have to be changed. Now what is the way to do it?\"  At this moment Bee was in need of tender guidance from an older woman. She was a warm-hearted, loving, undisciplined girl; prone to do things on the impulse of the moment which she would afterward deeply regret. She had brooded over the indifference of her father and his apparent preference for her cousin until the matter had assumed gigantic proportions. Had it not been for the unfortunate change of photographs, and her father's consequent mistake, the question of looks would never have bothered her. As it was, the idea that if she could make herself like Adele, her father could not help but love her, filled her mind to the exclusion of anything else, and she thought of nothing save how the thing could be accomplished. Presently she turned from the glass and went down stairs to the kitchen.  \"Aunt Fanny,\" she said to the negro woman, \"do you know of anything that would make my skin white?\"  \"Lawsie, chile! What am de mattah wid yer skin? Hit am good ernuff,\" answered Aunt Fanny.  \"But do you?\" persisted Bee. \"Because if you do, and will tell me, I will give you my string of yellow beads. Do you know anything?\"  \"'Cose I does, honey,\" answered the darkey, her eyes glistening at the mention of the beads. \"Habn't I larn'd all erbout yarbs?\"  \"Then please tell me,\" coaxed the girl.  \"Yer want hit like Miss Adele's?\" questioned the old woman shrewdly.  \"Yes,\" answered Bee eagerly.  \"All yer has ter do, Miss Bee, is to git jim'son--yer know jim'son weed, honey?\"  \"Yes, yes,\" cried Bee impatiently. \"Go on.\"  \"Yer gits jim'son, an' makes a poultice ob de leabs. War dat ober night on yer face, an' in de mawnin' yer'll be as fair as de lily ob de valley. Miss Adele can't hole a candle to yer.\"  \"Are you sure, Aunt Fanny?\" questioned Bee gleefully.  \"'Cose I'se sure. What'd I be tellin' yer fer ef I ain't sure?\"  \"And could you make my hair yellow like Adele's?\"  \"No'm; I cain't do dat. Dere's a worman down in de town kin, but I cain't. No'm; I kin do mos' anything, I reckon, but dat.\"  \"Do you mean Miss Harris, the hairdresser, Aunt Fanny?\" asked Bee with sudden enlightenment.  \"Yes'um; she'll make yer hair yaller, er red, er anything yer wants hit,\" returned Aunt Fanny pompously, proud to be able to give so much information to her young mistress.  \"Thank you, thank you,\" cried Bee, springing up joyfully. \"I'll get the beads now, and if everything comes out all right I'll give you something nice.\"  She ran up to her room, and soon returned with the beads. Walnut Grove was a few miles farther out on the turnpike than was her Uncle Henry's place; consequently it was too far from the town to walk. Bee chafed at the necessity of waiting until Joel could get the buggy ready, so impatient was she to put her new idea into practice. It was brought round at length, however, and soon she found herself entering the only hair dressing shop that the little town afforded.  \"What can I do for you, Miss Raymond?\" asked the proprietress coming forward.  \"Miss Harris, can you change the color of the hair?\" asked the girl abruptly.  \"Certainly,\" answered Miss Harris, evidently surprised by the query. \"Why?\"  \"Because I want you to change the color of mine,\" spoke Bee quickly.  Miss Harris hesitated.  \"Does your father know of it, Miss Raymond?\"  \"Why! he wishes it,\" declared Bee with sincerity.  \"Very well then. What color did you wish?\"  \"I want it sunny and yellow; with gold lights all through it,\" answered Bee promptly. \"Can you do it?\"  \"Yes, Miss Raymond; but your complexion--\"  \"I know,\" interrupted Bee. \"It should be fair to go with it. Can you help me about it?\"  \"No; I only do the hair. I don't know of any here who does treat the skin. It's a small place, you know.\"  \"Yes;\" assented Bee. Silently she watched the deft movements of the woman as she applied the bleach. It was done finally, and Bee found herself the possessor of locks as yellow as her cousin's. She eyed the result doubtfully.  \"I like my own best,\" was her mental comment. \"But if it pleases father I don't mind.\"  \"You understand,\" said Miss Harris as the girl prepared to depart, \"the application will have to be renewed as the hair grows. Otherwise it would be dark at the roots while the ends would be yellow.\"  \"Will it?\" asked Bee in dismay. \"I thought that this was all there was to it.\"  \"No. It takes time and patience to attain gold even in the hair.\" Miss Harris laughed at her little joke. \"Whenever it needs touching up, come in and we'll soon fix you up.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Beatrice as she left.  \"It's going to take every cent of this month's allowance,\" she mused as she stopped at a milliner's and ordered a white chip hat with purple pansies for trimming sent home, \"but it costs to be a beauty. One must dress for it, Adele always says. I always liked her best when she wore great big purple pansies on her hat. Now for the jimpson.\"  Jimpson weeds abounded by the roadside. Bee filled the bottom of the buggy with them, and then drove home. Ignoring Joel's surprised looks the girl reached the house without meeting any one else, and went directly to her room.  \"I won't go down to dinner,\" was her thought. \"I'll burst upon father in the morning like a new being. Won't he be surprised?\"     Chapter VI  A Night of Misery      \"Man on the dubious waves of error tossed,     His ship half foundered and his compass lost,     Sees, far as human optics many command,     A sleeping fog, and fancies it dry land:     Spreads all his canvas, every sinew plies,     Pants for it, aims at it, enters it, and dies.\"      --_Truth. Cowper._   The night was warm, and Beatrice found her poultice exceedingly uncomfortable. She had heaped the leaves on a clean cloth, mashed them to a pulp, spread the mass between two other cloths through which were cut small holes for the eyes and nostrils, and then, with a resolution worthy of a better cause, bound the whole upon her face.  The juices of the crushed leaves soon wet the mask through and through, making her face wet and sticky. The greenish odor of the weed was sickening, and the poor child found her condition unpleasant to say the least. She tossed restlessly from side to side in the vain effort to find sleep, but slumber fled her call. The night wore on, and the mask became so oppressive that it seemed to stifle her.  \"I can not stand it,\" she exclaimed at last,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33407"],["title","Bee and Butterfly: A Tale of Two Cousins (#7)"],["body","out of bed. \"I can not! I shall smother.\"  She reached up to tear off the bandages that bound the suffocating thing on, but paused in the act.  \"I must not give up,\" she said aloud. \"I should be sorry in the morning if I did. I must stand it somehow, even though the night does seem as if it would never end. I must bear it.\"  Fortified by this determination she drew a chair to the window and tried to distract her thoughts by humming softly to herself.  \"I know,\" she thought, tiring of this pastime. \"I'll see if I can't make up some poetry, and forget all about the horrid thing. If it were not for father I would not stand it for a second. Let me see! I have it:      \"Bee was an ugly duckling,       And Adele a princess fair;     Bee's locks were black and heavy,       Adele had yellow hair.  \"Pshaw! That's sing-songy. I'll try again:      \"Adele's hair is sunny and golden,       Mine is as black as sin;     For there's nothing yellow about me       Excepting my yellow skin.  \"Dear, dear! It's most as hard to make rhymes as to be beautiful. How long the night is!\"  She arose and paced the floor restlessly. Eleven, then twelve o'clock struck. In all her life she had never spent a night without sleep. A first experience is very trying, and the hours seem interminable. At two o'clock she was about as miserable as she could well be, and only the thought of her father made her hold to her determination to stick it out. Suddenly she remembered that she had left a book she was reading on the library table.  \"I'll go down and get it,\" she ejaculated, pleased with the distraction. \"If anything will make me forget myself it's the 'Woman in White.'\"  Suiting the action to the word she lighted a small night lamp, and glided softly down the stairs to the library. Turning the knob gently she opened the door, stepped across the threshold, and then--It was a wonder that she did not shriek aloud; for there in the room were two men, one of whom held a bag into which the other was putting the household silver which was piled on the table in front of them. They wore slouch hats drawn well down over their faces, and were working by the light of a dark lantern.  Beatrice entered so quietly that they did not notice her and for a second she stood unobserved, too frightened to speak. Then something made one of the men look up. A look of terror flashed into his eyes and his face whitened. The other turned to see what his companion was doing, but at sight of the figure that stood in the doorway he uttered a yell, dropped the bag, and ran for the window.  \"It's a sperrit, Bill,\" he cried wildly. \"Come on, man!\"  Bill needed no second bidding. He glanced once more at the startling apparition and followed his comrade.  In truth Beatrice did present rather a ghostly appearance. She was clad in a long white night gown; her yellow hair bushed in all its bleached glory around the white mask through which her eyes gleamed with feverish brilliancy. The greenish juice of the jimpson had permeated the cloth, giving it just enough of a stain to be ghastly under the rays of the lamp. As the men gained the window the girl, hardly conscious of what she was doing, moved toward them. Uttering cries of fear the fellows jumped through and made a dash for the road. Doors began to open and close, and Bee knew that the household was aroused. It brought her to her senses quickly. She had been so frightened that she had not fully grasped the meaning of the scene through which she had just passed, but now it flashed upon her that it was her beautifying mask that had terrified the burglars.  \"Father must not see me,\" she thought with an hysterical giggle. \"I should frighten him, too.\"  There was not a moment to lose, so setting her lamp upon the table she crept under the couch and drew back as far as she could, just as her father ran in, followed by Aunt Fanny, Joel her husband, and old Uncle Billy, the gardener.  \"Well, upon my word!\" exclaimed Dr. Raymond. \"It's burglars. See, here is the silver. What made them leave it? Something scared them. What could it have been?\"  \"'Twuz a hant,\" cried Aunt Fanny, ashy with terror. \"Didn't you heah 'em say 'twuz a hant?\"  \"It certainly sounded that way, but that is nonsense of course. Joel, do you come with me, and we will search the grounds. Uncle Billy, go at once to the stable and see if everything is all right there. Aunt Fanny will look after the house.\"  \"Lawsie, Massa doctah, yer ain't a gwine ter leab me heah, is yer?\" queried Aunt Fanny fearfully.  \"Why, there is nothing to hurt you. Come on, Joel.\"  Dr. Raymond leaped through the window, followed by Joel, while Uncle Billy left for the stable. Aunt Fanny, left alone, began to soliloquize audibly:  \"Hant, eh? I spec' hit's a hant. Dis house dun bin shet up too long fer it not to be a hant. Dis heah chile ain't a gwine ter stay in no house wid a hant. No, sah; she a gwine ter leab shore yer bo'n. She--\"  \"Aunt Fanny,\" spoke Bee in muffled tones.  \"Good Lawd,\" cried Aunt Fanny, starting up. \"Hit's the hant. Lawd, Lawd, spar dis niggah! You doesn't want no ole worman like me. You--\"  \"Hush, Aunt Fanny! It's only Bee. Don't you know me?\"  Beatrice crept out of her hiding place and arose to her feet. Aunt Fanny gave a suppressed cry and sank back in her chair, staring at the girl in open-eyed wonder.  \"You, you ain't no Miss Bee,\" she gasped.  \"Yes, I am. I just had my hair fixed at the hairdresser's this afternoon, and I have on that jimpson poultice you told me about. I came down stairs to get a book and frightened the robbers away. I want to go upstairs now before father comes back so he won't see me.\"  \"Yas; go on up stairs,\" said Aunt Fanny severely, now completely reassured. \"Yer pa mustn't see you like dat. He won't 'prove ob no sech doin's, an' I doesn't eider. Yaller ha'r! Looks like flax! No'm; yer pa oughtn't ter see yer.\"  \"Then don't say a word about seeing me,\" cautioned Bee, turning to go. \"You won't, will you?\"  \"I ain't gwine ter say nuffin'. 'Tain't none ob my lookout ef yer wants ter spile yer ha'r. I ain't gwine ter hab nuffin' ter do wid hit,\" returned the negress with dignity.  So, feeling very much like a culprit, Bee stole upstairs. Presently she heard her father re-enter the house, and soon there came a rap on her door.  \"What is it?\" she asked from under the cover which, girl like, she had drawn over her as soon as she was safely in bed.  \"Are you all right, Beatrice?\" came her father's voice.  \"Yes father.\"  \"Don't be alarmed, but--\" Dr. Raymond hesitated, evidently considering whether it would be best to tell her about the intruders. \"You are not nervous, are you?\"  \"No----o;\" answered Bee weakly. She was.  She would have liked to have somebody cuddle her for a time, but--there was that awful mask.  \"If you should be disturbed about anything, Beatrice, just call me. I shall be in the next room, where I shall read for the remainder of the night.\"  \"Thank you, father,\" said the girl gratefully. \"I was afraid, but I won't be now.\"  \"Then good night.\"  \"Good night, father,\" replied the maiden who little guessed that her father went away from her door wondering and perplexed that she did not come out to speak with him, and to find what was the matter.  Her father's near presence brought so much of comfort to Bee's heart that she found herself forgetting all about the discomfort of the jimpson, and after a time she fell into a troubled sleep.     Chapter VII  The Result of Imitation      \"We are much bound to them that do succeed;     But, in a more pathetic sense, are bound     To such as fail.\"      --_Jean Ingelow._   It was morning. The long night with its wretchedness and discomfort had passed, and the bright sunshine full of cheer streamed into the room, athwart the bed where Beatrice lay, her features still hidden under the beautifying mask. She stirred uneasily and then opened her eyes.  \"Why, it's morning,\" she exclaimed, jumping up briskly. \"Thank goodness, I can take off this horrible thing at last. I ought to be fair as a lily after all I've gone through. My, my how funny my face feels!\" She untied the fastenings with a sigh of relief, and threw off the poultice thankfully.  \"My skin is sticky and tight,\" she mused, passing one hand over her face. \"I won't look at myself until I am dressed, and then I can tell just how I shall affect father. Let me see! I'll wear white. Adele looks best in white. Fair people always do, I think.\"  True to her resolve she bathed and dressed without once approaching the mirror. At length she was ready. She had no doubts as to the result. Beatrice was possessed with a child's faith; still, her heart began to beat quickly as she turned slowly and went toward the glass, keeping her eyes downcast.  \"It's just like a butterfly breaking out of the chrysalis,\" she told herself nervously. \"I have been an ugly grub for so long that I'm afraid to try my new wings. Now, ready, Beatrice! One, two, three!--Look, and see how beautiful you have become.\"  Smilingly she raised her eyes. The smile froze on her lips, and consternation swept over her face. Her features were distorted and swollen, and her skin was as yellow as saffron. With her dark eyes, bleached hair, and white dress the effect was startling. For one long moment the girl stared at her reflection, and then, as the full realization of the transformation came home to her, she flung herself upon the bed with a cry of anguish.  \"It's no use,\" she wailed. \"Everything is against me. I look worse than ever. What shall I do? What shall I do?\"  A knock sounded on the door just then, and Bee started up, fearing that it was her father.  \"Yes?\" she called.  \"Yer pa am a-waitin' fer yer, Miss Bee,\" came the voice of Aunt Fanny. \"He say de brek'fus am gittin' cole.\"  \"Aunt Fanny, come here!\" Beatrice opened the door and pulled the old woman inside. \"Look at my face! This comes from using that jimpson weed poultice. Now what am I going to do?\"  The negress gave a "]]]
