CHAPTER III. OF PUBLIC DEBTS.    INTRODUCTION AND PLAN OF THE WORK.              The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it       with all the necessaries and conveniencies of life which it annually       consumes, and which consist always either in the immediate produce of that       labour, or in what is purchased with that produce from other nations.            According, therefore, as this produce, or what is purchased with it, bears       a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume       it, the nation will be better or worse supplied with all the necessaries       and conveniencies for which it has occasion.            But this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different       circumstances: first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its       labour is generally applied; and, secondly, by the proportion between the       number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who       are not so employed. Whatever be the soil, climate, or extent of territory       of any particular nation, the abundance or scantiness of its annual supply       must, in that particular situation, depend upon those two circumstances.            The abundance or scantiness of this supply, too, seems to depend more upon       the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter. Among the       savage nations of hunters and fishers, every individual who is able to       work is more or less employed in useful labour, and endeavours to provide,       as well as he can, the necessaries and conveniencies of life, for himself,       and such of his family or tribe as are either too old, or too young, or       too infirm, to go a-hunting and fishing. Such nations, however, are so       miserably poor, that, from mere want, they are frequently reduced, or at       least think themselves reduced, to the necessity sometimes of directly       destroying, and sometimes of abandoning their infants, their old people,       and those afflicted with lingering diseases, to perish with hunger, or to       be devoured by wild beasts. Among civilized and thriving nations, on the       contrary, though a great number of people do not labour at all, many of       whom consume the produce of ten times, frequently of a hundred times, more       labour than the greater part of those who work; yet the produce of the       whole labour of the society is so great, that all are often abundantly       supplied; and a workman, even of the lowest and poorest order, if he is       frugal and industrious, may enjoy a greater share of the necessaries and       conveniencies of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire.            The causes of this improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the       order according to which its produce is naturally distributed among the       different ranks and conditions of men in the society, make the subject of       the first book of this Inquiry.            Whatever be the actual state of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with       which labour is applied in any nation, the abundance or scantiness of its       annual supply must depend, during the continuance of that state, upon the       proportion between the number of those who are annually employed in useful       labour, and that of those who are not so employed. The number of useful       and productive labourers, it will hereafter appear, is everywhere in       proportion to the quantity of capital stock which is employed in setting       them to work, and to the particular way in which it is so employed. The       second book, therefore, treats of the nature of capital stock, of the       manner in which it is gradually accumulated, and of the different       quantities of labour which it puts into motion, according to the different       ways in which it is employed.            Nations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity, and judgment, in       the application of labour, have followed very different plans in the       general conduct or direction of it; and those plans have not all been       equally favourable to the greatness of its produce. The policy of some       nations has given extraordinary encouragement to the industry of the       country; that of others to the industry of towns. Scarce any nation has       dealt equally and impartially with every sort of industry. Since the       down-fall of the Roman empire, the policy of Europe has been more       favourable to arts, manufactures, and commerce, the industry of towns,       than to agriculture, the Industry of the country. The circumstances which       seem to have introduced and established this policy are explained in the       third book.            Though those different plans were, perhaps, first introduced by the       private interests and prejudices of particular orders of men, without any       regard to, or foresight of, their consequences upon the general welfare of       the society; yet they have given occasion to very different theories of       political economy; of which some magnify the importance of that industry       which is carried on in towns, others of that which is carried on in the       country. Those theories have had a considerable influence, not only upon       the opinions of men of learning, but upon the public conduct of princes       and sovereign states. I have endeavoured, in the fourth book, to explain       as fully and distinctly as I can those different theories, and the       principal effects which they have produced in different ages and nations.            To explain in what has consisted the revenue of the great body of the       people, or what has been the nature of those funds, which, in different       ages and nations, have supplied their annual consumption, is the object of       these four first books. The fifth and last book treats of the revenue of       the sovereign, or commonwealth. In this book I have endeavoured to shew,       first, what are the necessary expenses of the sovereign, or commonwealth;       which of those expenses ought to be defrayed by the general contribution       of the whole society, and which of them, by that of some particular part       only, or of some particular members of it: secondly, what are the       different methods in which the whole society may be made to contribute       towards defraying the expenses incumbent on the whole society, and what       are the principal advantages and inconveniencies of each of those methods;       and, thirdly and lastly, what are the reasons and causes which have       induced almost all modern governments to mortgage some part of this       revenue, or to contract debts; and what have been the effects of those       debts upon the real wealth, the annual produce of the land and labour of       the society.        BOOK I. OF THE CAUSES OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE PRODUCTIVE POWERS OF LABOUR, AND OF THE ORDER ACCORDING TO WHICH ITS PRODUCE IS NATURALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE DIFFERENT RANKS OF THE PEOPLE.        CHAPTER I. OF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.         "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3300"],["title","An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (#1)"],["body","     The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the       greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is       anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the       division of labour. The effects of the division of labour, in the general       business of society, will be more easily understood, by considering in       what manner it operates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly       supposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones; not perhaps       that it really is carried further in them than in others of more       importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to       supply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole number       of workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every       different branch of the work can often be collected into the same       workhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator.            In those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply       the great wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of       the work employs so great a number of workmen, that it is impossible to       collect them all into the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one       time, than those employed in one single branch. Though in such       manufactures, therefore, the work may really be divided into a much       greater number of parts, than in those of a more trifling nature, the       division is not near so obvious, and has accordingly been much less       observed.            To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture, but one       in which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the       trade of a pin-maker: a workman not educated to this business (which the       division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the       use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same       division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps,       with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not       make twenty. But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not       only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number       of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One       man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth       points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make       the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a       peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by       itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a       pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations,       which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though       in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have       seen a small manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed,       and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct       operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but       indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when       they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a       day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling       size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of       forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth       part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four       thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought       separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated       to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made       twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two       hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part       of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a       proper division and combination of their different operations.            In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour       are similar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of       them, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so       great a simplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far       as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable       increase of the productive powers of labour. The separation of different       trades and employments from one another, seems to have taken place in       consequence of this advantage. This separation, too, is generally carried       furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and       improvement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of society,       being generally that of several in an improved one. In every improved       society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer; the manufacturer,       nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is necessary to produce       any one complete manufacture, is almost always divided among a great       number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each branch of       the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and the       wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and       dressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit       of so many subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one       business from another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so       entirely the business of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the       trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The       spinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver; but the       ploughman, the harrower, the sower of the seed, and the reaper of the       corn, are often the same. The occasions for those different sorts of       labour returning with the different seasons of the year, it is impossible       that one man should be constantly employed in any one of them. This       impossibility of making so complete and entire a separation of all the       different branches of labour employed in agriculture, is perhaps the       reason why the improvement of the productive powers of labour, in this       art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures. The       most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in       agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly more       distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their       lands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense       bestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural       fertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much       more than in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In       agriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always much more       productive than that of the poor; or, at least, it is never so much more       productive, as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich       country, therefore, will not always, in the same degree of goodness, come       cheaper to market than that of the poor. The corn of Poland, in the same       degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France, notwithstanding the       superior opulence and improvement of the latter country. The corn of       France is, in the corn-provinces, fully as good, and in most years nearly       about the same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and       improvement, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of       England, however, are better cultivated than those of France, and the       corn-lands of France are said to be much better cultivated than those of       Poland. But though the poor country, notwithstanding the inferiority of       its cultivation, can, in some measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and       goodness of its corn, it can pretend to no such competition in its       manufactures, at least if those manufactures suit the soil, climate, and       situation, of the rich country. The silks of France are better and cheaper       than those of England, because the silk manufacture, at least under the       present high duties upon the importation of raw silk, does not so well       suit the climate of England as that of France. But the hardware and the       coarse woollens of England are beyond all comparison superior to those of       France, and much cheaper, too, in the same degree of goodness. In Poland       there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind, a few of those       coarser household manufactures excepted, without which no country can well       subsist.            This great increase in the quantity of work, which, in consequence of the       division of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing,       is owing to three different circumstances; first, to the increase of       dexterity in every particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time       which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another;       and, lastly, to the invention of a great number of machines which       facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work of many.            First, the improvement of the dexterity of the workmen, necessarily       increases the quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of       labour, by reducing every man’s business to some one simple operation, and       by making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily       increases very much the"]]]
