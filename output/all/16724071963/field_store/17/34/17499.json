No. 21069, [male]?, taken on August 21, is in molt, with one patch of new fur on the rump and another along the midline of the nape and shoulders.   Sorex obscurus obscurus Merriam  Dusky Shrew      _Sorex obscurus_ Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna, 10:72, December 31, 1895.   (Type from near Timber Creek, altitude 8200 ft., Salmon River   Mountains, now Lemhi Mountains, 10 miles west of Junction, Lemhi   County, Idaho.)  _Specimens examined._--Total 12, as follows: _Yukon Territory_: McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 1; SW end Dezadeash Lake, 2; 1½ mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 2500 ft., 1. _British Columbia_: Stonehouse Creek, 5½ mi. W jct. Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, 4; W side Mt. Glave, 4000 ft., 14 mi. S and 2 mi. E Kelsall Lake, 1; Hot Springs, 3 mi. WNW jct. Trout River and Liard River, 1. _Alberta_: Assineau River, 1920 ft., 10 mi. E and 1 mi. N Kinuso, 2.  _Remarks._--Some of the shrews taken in extreme southwestern Yukon Territory (1½ miles south and 3 miles east of Dalton Post) and in extreme northwestern British Columbia (Stonehouse Creek and Mt. Glave) show evidence of intergradation with the coastal subspecies, _S. o. alascensis_, in length of hind foot. These individuals have a long hind foot (14 and 15); the hind feet of specimens from the other localities listed measure 13 and 14.  Alcorn, like Rand (1944:35), found the dusky shrew to be less common than the cinereous shrew; both were taken in the same trap lines. The dusky shrew was taken at a higher altitude (4000 feet, on Mt. Glave) than the cinereous shrew.   Sorex obscurus shumaginensis Merriam  Dusky Shrew      _Sorex alascensis shumaginensis_ Merriam, Proc. Washington Acad.   Sci., 2:18, March 14, 1900. (Type from Popof Island, Shumagin   Islands, Alaska.)      _Sorex obscurus shumaginensis_ J. A. Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.   Hist, 16:228, July 12, 1902.  _Specimens examined._--Total 3, as follows: _Alaska_: 1 mi. NE Anchorage, 100 ft., 1; Glenn Highway, 6 mi. WSW Snowshoe Lake, 2.  _Remarks._--These three shrews, in comparison with those referred to _S. o. obscurus_, are paler, and the one complete skull has a slightly higher braincase. All of the specimens were obtained in grassy areas adjacent to the roadway.   Sorex obscurus alascensis Merriam  Dusky Shrew      _Sorex obscurus alascensis_ Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna, 10:76,   December 31, 1895. (Type from Yakutat, Alaska.)  _Specimens examined._--Total 22, as follows: _Alaska_: E side Chilkat River, 100 ft., 9 mi. W and 4 mi. N Haines, 12; 1 mi. S Haines, 5 ft., 10.   Sorex palustris navigator (Baird)  Water Shrew      _Neosorex navigator_ Baird, Report Pacific R. R. Survey, 8, pt.   1, Mammals, p. 11, 1857. (Type from near head of Yakima River,   Cascade Mountains, Washington.)      _Sorex_ (_Neosorex_) _palustris navigator_ Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna,   10:92, December 31, 1895.  _Specimens examined._--Total 20, as follows: _Alaska_: E side Chilkat River, 100 ft., 9 mi. W and 4 mi. N Haines, 2. _Yukon Territory_: McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 11; SW end Dezadeash Lake, 2; 1½ mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 2500 ft., 3. _British Columbia_: Stonehouse Creek, 5½ mi. W jct. Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, 2.  _Remarks._--Those males with worn teeth seem to have a slightly longer and deeper rostrum with a larger, more inflated cranium than specimens of _S. p. navigator_ from Washington, but in other ways resemble typical _S. p. navigator_. An adult male, with slightly worn teeth, from Dezadeash Lake has sagittal and lambdoidal crests. All of the water shrews were taken in July and early August and at the edge of water in traps baited with rolled oats. None of the females had embryos.   Myotis lucifugus lucifugus (LeConte)  Little Brown Bat      _Vespertilio lucifugus_ LeConte, McMurtrie's Cuvier, Animal   Kingdom, vol. 1, appendix, p. 431, 1831. (Type from Georgia;   probably the LeConte plantation, near Riceboro, Liberty County.)      _Myotis lucifugus_ Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:59,   October 16, 1897.  _Specimens examined._--Thirty-eight from _British Columbia_: NE end Muncho Lake.  _Remarks._--The 38 bats were from a colony of approximately 75 individuals, found on the south side of a house. The paper was loose and had buckled in numerous places allowing room for the bats to ensconce themselves between the paper and outside wall.   Myotis lucifugus alascensis Miller  Little Brown Bat      _Myotis lucifugus alascensis_ Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:63,   October 16, 1897. (Type from Sitka, Alaska.)  _Specimens examined._--One from _British Columbia_: Screw Creek, 10 mi. S and 50 mi. E Teslin.  _Remarks._--The specimen is considerably darker both above and below than either of two specimens of _M. l. alascensis_ from Red Bluff Bay, Alaska. Alcorn searched ten frame buildings in an abandoned camp on the east side of Screw Creek, for bats and found only the one bat. It was above some droppings. No droppings were found in other buildings.   Ochotona collaris (Nelson)  Collared Pika      _Lagomys collaris_ Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 8:117,   December 21, 1893. (Type from near head of Tanana River, about   200 miles south of Fort Yukon, Alaska.)      [_Ochotona_] _collaris_ Trouessart, Catal. Mamm. viv. foss.,   p. 648, 1897.  _Specimens examined._--Total 14, as follows: _British Columbia_: Stonehouse Creek, 5½ mi. W jct. Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, 1; W side Mt. Glave, 4000 ft., 14 mi. S and 2 mi. E Kelsall Lake, 13.  _Remarks._--In comparing specimens obtained by Alcorn with published descriptions of _O. collaris_ in Howell (1924:35), it appeared that measurable geographic variation might be present in this monotypic species. Accordingly, comparisons were made with materials in the Biological Surveys collection of the U. S. National Museum, the Provincial Museum, Victoria, B. C., and the National Museum of Canada. A comparison of specimens of similar ages showed that no subspecific separation is justified although animals from the Yukon Territory, British Columbia, and Northwest Territories, as compared with available material from Alaska, tend to be grayer in color and longer in total length with a slightly larger skull and greater alveolar length of molariform tooth-row in both upper and lower jaws.  Specimens used for comparison were from the following localities: _Alaska_: Mts. near Eagle (USBS), 15; 200 mi. S Fort Yukon (USBS), 2; Upper Little Delta River, Glacier Creek, Mt. Hayes region (USBS), 1; Glacier Creek, Mt. Hayes region (USBS), 3; Little Delta River, Slate Creek, Red Mt. Camp, Mt. Hayes region (USBS), 1; Muldron Glacier, Mt. McKinley (USBS), 2; Mt. McKinley (USBS), 3; Summit of Chugach Mts., on Richardson Highway, N of Valdez (USBS), 1; Chitina River Glacier (Nat. Mus. Canada), 3. _Yukon Territory_: McMillan Pass, Canol Road, mile 282 (Nat. Mus. Canada), 2; Rose River, Canol Road, mile 95 (Nat. Mus. Canada), 8; Tepee Lake (Nat. Mus. Canada), 1; Conrad (Nat. Mus. Canada), 1; near Teslin Lake (Nat. Mus. Canada), 1. _Northwest Territories_: headwaters of Caracajou River, Canol Road, mile 111E (Nat. Mus. Canada), 1. _British Columbia_: White Mt., Moose Arm, Tagish Lake, Atlin (Prov. Mus., Victoria, B.C.), 2.   Lepus americanus macfarlani Merriam  Varying Hare      _Lepus americanus macfarlani_ Merriam, Proc. Washington Acad. Sci.,   2:30, March 14, 1900. (Type from Fort Anderson, near mouth of   Anderson River, Mackenzie, Canada.)  _Specimens examined._--Total 3, as follows: _Yukon Territory_: W side Lewes River, 2150 ft., 2 mi. S Whitehorse, 1; 5 mi. W Teslin River, 2400 ft., 16 mi. S and 53 mi. E Whitehorse, 1. _British Columbia_: 14 mi. N Fort Halkett, W side Smith River, 1.  _Remarks._--Alcorn reports seeing few hares on his two trips to Alaska. Near the Miniker River, a geologist told him that the numbers of these animals had steadily declined since 1943. One of three seen in a spruce forest on July 8, 1947, near Whitehorse was taken by Alcorn. A young one was captured in a rat trap in a building near the Teslin River on July 5 of the same year.   Tamiasciurus hudsonicus columbiensis A. H. Howell  Red Squirrel      _Tamiasciurus hudsonicus columbiensis_ A. H. Howell, Proc. Biol.   Soc. Washington, 49:135, August 22, 1936. (Type from Raspberry   Creek, about 30 mi. SE of Telegraph Creek, northern British Columbia.)  _Specimens examined._--Total 18, as follows: _Yukon Territory_: McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 1; W side Lewes River, 2150 ft., 2 mi. SW Whitehorse, 1; 2 mi. W Teslin River, 2400 ft., 16 mi. E Whitehorse, 1. _British Columbia_: 1 mi. NW jct. Irons Creek and Liard River, 1; ¼ mi. S jct. Trout River and Liard River, 3; S side Toad River, 10 mi. S and 21 mi. E Muncho Lake, 3; Summit Pass, 4200 ft., 10 mi. S and 70 mi. W Fort Nelson, 8.  _Remarks._--Rand (1944:42) experienced difficulty in assigning subspecific names to red squirrels taken along the Alaska Highway in northern British Columbia. Some variability as found by Rand is noted in adults taken by Alcorn in this area. All of the specimens assigned to _T. h. columbiensis_ have a darker tail and more tawny feet than _T. h. preblei_. The average of skulls of adults is smaller than the skull of an adult of _T. h. preblei_ from Yerrick Creek, Alaska.  Alcorn obtained most of the squirrels in rat traps and steel traps, using \"chewed\" rolled oats as well as bits of fish and mouse bodies as bait.   Tamiasciurus hudsonicus petulans (Osgood)  Red Squirrel      _Sciurus hudsonicus petulans_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 19:27,   October 6, 1900. (Type from Glacier, White Pass, Alaska.)      _T[amiasciurus]. hudsonicus petulans_ A. H. Howell, Proc. Biol.   Soc. Washington, 49:136, August 22, 1936.  _Specimens examined._--Total 7, as follows: _Alaska_: 1 mi. S Haines, 5 ft., 2. _Yukon Territory_: SW end Dezadeash Lake, 1; 1½ mi. E Tatshenshini River, 1½mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 4.  _Remarks._--Specimens from extreme southwestern Yukon Territory"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33915"],["title","Mammals taken Along the Alaska Highway (#2)"],["body","to be referable to this subspecies. The one adult female (skull only, with body measurements) from the southwestern end of Dezadeash Lake has a shorter skull than does any adult female of _T. h. columbiensis_. No skins of adults are in the series, but the skins of three subadults have darker upper parts, a darker tail and less olivaceous sides than _T. h. columbiensis_.   Tamiasciurus hudsonicus preblei A. H. Howell  Red Squirrel      _Tamiasciurus hudsonicus preblei_ A. H. Howell, Proc. Biol. Soc.   Washington, 49:133, August 22, 1936. (Type from Fort Simpson,   Mackenzie District, Northwestern Territories.)  _Specimens examined._--Total 3, as follows: _Alaska_: Chatanika River, 700 ft., 14 mi. E and 25 mi. N Fairbanks, 1; N side Salcha River, 600 ft., 25 mi. S and 20 mi. E Fairbanks, 1; Yerrick Creek, 21 mi. W and 4 mi. N Tok Junction, 1.  _Remarks._--In comparison with specimens of _T. h. hudsonicus_ from Iskwasum Lake, District of the Pas, Manitoba, the squirrel from Yerrick Creek, an adult female, is larger and paler on the upper parts and tail.  The squirrel taken at Yerrick Creek was captured in a rat trap; Alcorn found these animals to be \"fairly common\" in that area. He obtained no evidence that the natives use them for food.   Marmota monax ochracea Swarth  Woodchuck      _Marmota ochracea_ Swarth, Univ. California Publ. Zoöl., 7:203,   February 18, 1911. (Type from Forty-mile Creek, Alaska.)      _Marmota monax ochracea_ A. H. Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 37:34,   April 7, 1915.  _Specimens examined._--Total 3, as follows: _British Columbia_: Hot Springs, 3 mi. WNW jct. Trout River and Liard River, 1; ¼ mi. S jct. Trout River and Liard River, 2.   Citellus parryii plesius (Osgood)  Parry Ground Squirrel      _Spermophilis empetra plesius_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 19:29,   October 6, 1900. (Type from Bennett City, head of Lake Bennett,   British Columbia.)      _Citellus paryii plesius_ A. H. Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 56:97,   May 18, 1938.   _Specimens examined._--Total 42, as follows: _Alaska_: Richardson Highway, 2000 ft., 32 mi. S and 4 mi. W Big Delta, 5. _Yukon Territory_: 6 mi. SW Kluane, 2550 ft., 1; McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 1; 2 mi. NNW Whitehorse, 2100 ft., 1; 1 mi. NE Whitehorse, 1; ½ mi. W Whitehorse, 2150 ft., 1; SW end Dezadeash Lake, 1; 2 mi. W Teslin River, 2400 ft., 16 mi. S and 56 mi. E Whitehorse, 7; 1½ mi. E Tatshenshini River, 1½ mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 3. _British Columbia_: Stonehouse Creek, 5½ mi. W jct. Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, 14; W side Mt. Glave, 4000 ft., 14 mi. S and 2 mi. E Kelsall Lake, 7.  _Remarks._--The specimens vary much in color; most color variation is the result of wear and fading. In pallor of coloration the specimens taken on August 16 along the Richardson Highway, 32 miles south and 4 miles west of Big Delta, Alaska, show some resemblance to _C. p. ablusus_, which occurs to the westward, although in other diagnostic characters these specimens are typically _C. p. plesius_.  Specimens in early stages of molt were taken on July 3, 4, and 14; another specimen in an advanced stage of molt was obtained on July 10. One melanistic individual was taken one mile northeast of Whitehorse on July 11.  Alcorn found these ground squirrels locally abundant, especially in the vicinity of Whitehorse in Yukon Territory. A large population was observed along the highway west of the Teslin River; animals were seen for several miles along the road, principally in open coniferous forests where there was little or no underbrush. Alcorn caught several animals near the city dump at Whitehorse. Along the Richardson Highway he observed these ground squirrels almost continuously for approximately ten miles. He comments that the animals appeared to be more numerous in the man-cleared areas along the highway than in \"unmolested areas farther back from the highway.\" Specimens were taken with collecting gun and in rat traps baited with \"chewed\" rolled oats.   Eutamias minimus borealis (J. A. Allen)  Least Chipmunk      _Tamias asiaticus borealis_ J. A. Allen, Monogr. N. Amer. Rodentia,   p. 793, August, 1877. (Type from Fort Liard, Mackenzie, Canada.)      _Eutamias minimus borealis_ A. H. Howell, Jour. Mamm., 3:183,   August 4, 1922.  _Specimens examined._--Total 10, as follows: _British Columbia_: N side Muskwa River, 1200 ft., 4 mi. W Fort Nelson, 1; E side Minaker River, 1 mi. W Trutch, 5; Beatton River, 115 mi. S Fort Nelson, 1; 5 mi. W. and 3 mi. N Fort St. John, 1. _Alberta_: Assineau River, 1920 ft., 10 mi. E and 1 mi. N Kinuso, 2.  _Remarks._--Specimens with worn pelage are conspicuously paler and grayer than those in fresh pelage. Chipmunks in early stages of molt with fresh pelage extending posteriorly to the middle of the dorsal part of the back were taken on June 19, 20, and 22; others in fresh pelage above, except for the hind quarters, were taken on June 15 and on September 2.  Alcorn found this species nowhere abundant; for example, in 187 museum special traps set near Charlie Lake, 5 miles west and 3 miles north of Fort St. John, in British Columbia, he took only one chipmunk.   Eutamias minimus caniceps Osgood  Least Chipmunk      _Eutamias caniceps_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 19:28, October 6, 1900.   (Type from Lake Lebarge, Yukon Territory.)      _Eutamias minimus caniceps_ A. H. Howell, Jour. Mamm., 3:184,   August 4, 1922.  _Specimens examined._--Total 36, as follows: _Yukon Territory_: 6 mi. SW Kluane, 2550 ft., 2; McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 3; 2 mi. NNW Whitehorse, 2100 ft., 1; W side Lewes River, 2150 ft., 2 mi. S Whitehorse, 1; SW end Dezadeash Lake, 10; 5 mi. W Teslin River, 2400 ft., 16 mi. S and 53 mi. E Whitehorse, 1; W side Teslin River, 16 mi. S and 58 mi. E Whitehorse, 2; 1½ mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 2500 ft., 5. _British Columbia_: 1 mi. NW jct. Irons Creek and Liard River, 2; S side Toad River, 10 mi. S and 21 mi. E Muncho Lake, 6; Summit Pass, 4200 ft., 10 mi. S and 70 mi. W Fort Nelson, 3.  _Remarks._--Some of the specimens taken between Summit Pass and Toad River show evidence of intergradation between the paler and grayer _E. m. caniceps_ and the brighter and browner _E. m. borealis_. Rand (1944:41) also found evidence of intergradation between these two subspecies in this area.  Along the highway, Alcorn found this species to be somewhat more abundant in the Yukon Territory than in British Columbia. He often found the animals occupying abandoned road camps; seemingly they were more numerous in these areas than in undisturbed natural habitat.   Glaucomys sabrinus zaphaeus (Osgood)  Flying Squirrel      _Sciuropterus alpinus zaphaeus_ Osgood, Proc. Biol. Soc.   Washington, 18:133, April 18, 1905. (Type from Helm Bay, Cleveland   Peninsula, southeastern Alaska.)      _Glaucomys sabrinus zaphaeus_ A. H. Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 44:43,   June 13, 1918.  _Specimens examined._--One from _Yukon Territory_: 1½ mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 2500 ft.  _Remarks._--Although comparative material is not available at this writing, descriptions in the literature indicate that this single adult female belongs to the coastal form, _G. s. zaphaeus_. In both color and in cranial and external measurements, this specimen appears to agree closely with descriptions given by Howell (1918:43) and by Cowan (1937:78 and 82), although its measurements are also in the range of those given for _G. s. alpinus_ by Cowan (_loc. cit._). It may be pointed out that Swarth (1936:402) regarded a specimen from 15 miles south of Atlin, British Columbia, as _G. s. alpinus_.  Measurements of Alcorn's specimen are as follows: total length, 331; tail, 143; hind foot, 42; ear from notch, 23; greatest length of skull, 41.7; zygomatic breadth, 25.7; mastoid breadth, 21.7; length of nasals, 12.2; length maxillary tooth-row, 8.2; interorbital constriction, 8.2; and postorbital constriction, 9.0.   Castor canadensis sagittatus Benson  Beaver      _Castor canadensis sagittatus_ Benson, Jour. Mamm., 14:320,   November 13, 1933. (Type from Indianpoint Creek, 3200 ft., 16 mi.   NE Barkerville, British Columbia.)  _Specimens examined._--Two from _British Columbia_: Fort Halkett, N side Liard River.  _Remarks._--Two beaver skulls obtained by Alcorn from trapper Johnny Pie appear to be of this subspecies. Anderson (1947:133) records this subspecies from the Liard River, in the area from which these specimens were taken. The trapper told Alcorn that he shot these two beavers in the winter of 1947-48 and hung the skulls in a tree.   Peromyscus maniculatus algidus Osgood  White-footed Mouse      _Peromyscus maniculatus algidus_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, No. 28:56,   April 17, 1909. (Type from head of Lake Bennett, site of old Bennett   City, British Columbia.)  _Specimens examined._--Total 93, as follows: _Alaska_: E side Chilkat River, 100 ft., 9 mi. W and 4 mi. N Haines, 20; 1 mi. W Haines, 5 ft., 7. _Yukon Territory_: 6 mi. SW Kluane, 2550 ft., 10; McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 6; 2 mi. NNW Whitehorse, 2100 ft., 2; W side Lewes River, 2150 ft., 2 mi. S Whitehorse, 16; SW end Dezadeash Lake, 9; 1½ mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 15. _British Columbia_: Stonehouse Creek, 5½ mi. W jct. Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, 8.  _Remarks._--Specimens from the localities listed above are in the geographic range of _P. m. algidus_ as outlined by Anderson (1947: 136). Specimens from the vicinity of Haines, Alaska, are slightly darker indicating intergradation with _P. m. hylaeus_; Osgood (1909a: 54 and 56) also noted that intergradation between _P. m. algidus_ and _P. m. hylaeus_ occurs in this area.   Peromyscus maniculatus borealis Mearns  White-footed Mouse      _Peromyscus maniculatus borealis_ Mearns, Proc. Biol. Soc.   Washington, 24:102, May 15, 1911. Substitute name for _P. m. arcticus_   Mearns. (Type from Fort Simpson, Mackenzie, Canada.)  _Specimens examined._--Total 214, as follows: _Yukon Territory_: 2 mi. W Teslin River, 2400 ft."]]]
