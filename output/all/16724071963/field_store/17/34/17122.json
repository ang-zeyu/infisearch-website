Bontarc turned suddenly upon the dour Retoc. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"is there any truth to the legend that the clock in the tower will toll the end of one hundred years?\"  \"None whatever,\" the sadistic Abarian snapped. \"A rumor passed from the lips of one old woman to another.\"  Bontarc smiled. \"Then why are you here? The hundred years are up today.\"  Retoc's hand moved toward his whip-sword. \"Are you calling me a liar?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Bontarc watched alertly as the blade came partly from its scabbard. \"If we fight we may miss the tolling of the clock,\" he said evenly.  With an oath, Retoc pushed the sword back into its scabbard and put sharp heels to his stad's flanks. The animal screamed indignantly and rocketed ahead. Bontarc smiled and turned his car back toward his own group.  And now they were assembled and waiting, the curious of the planet Tarth. Would the clock toll as it was rumored Portox had said? Would an avenger come forth to challenge Retoc and his Abarian hordes?  There was not much time left. Swiftly the clock ticked off the remaining moments and the end of one hundred years was at hand. Silence settled over the assembled Tarthans.  Then a great sound boomed over the plains; a single ringing peal that rose majestically into the air, reverberated across the empty land that once had been the site of a thriving, prosperous nation. The first part of the legend had been fulfilled.  Then, suddenly, chaos reigned. With a great thundering that shook the ground upon which they stood, the gray tower exploded in crimson glory; a great mushrooming blossom of red fire erupted skyward hurling the assembled Tarthans to the ground where they lay in numbed stupor.  The thunderous report echoed across the plain ten thousand times louder than the tolling of the clock. But aside from the initial dulling shock, no Tarthan was injured because the crushing power rose upward.  There was an expression of mute wonder on Bontarc's face. And he thought: We have not seen the end of this. It is only the beginning. But the beginning of what? Only Portox could have known. And Portox was--where?  Bontarc started his car and moved across the plain sensing cosmic events but not knowing....  Not knowing that the sound of the tolling clock had gone with more than the speed of light across the void, had been flung arrow-straight to a brooding mansion in the heart of a thick forest upon another planet; to the door of a cavern deep in the rock beneath the mansion.  That even now the lock of this door had responded to the electronic impulse and the huge panel was swinging slowly open.     CHAPTER III  _The Man in the Cavern_   As the sound of the tolling clock died out across the Plains of Ofrid, a man opened his eyes on the planet far away and saw for the first time the place in which he had spent one hundred years.  He awoke with neither fright nor surprise but rather with a sense of wonder. He arose slowly from the great bed upon which he had lain and allowed his attention to roam about the strange place in which he found himself.  In the wall opposite the bed there was set a full length mirror and as the man turned he saw himself for the first time; a tall, broadly-muscled figure of heroic proportions. Completely naked, his body was reflected as masculine perfection in every detail.  For a few moments, the man stared at the body as though it belonged to someone else. Then he spoke musingly. \"You did your work well, Portox, my friend.\"  The sound of his own voice startled him but not so much so as the content of the words. A baffled expression touched his handsome face. Who was Portox? And what work had he done? What place was this--and for that matter, who was he himself, this naked figure which looked back at him from the glittering mirror?  The questions were annoying because he felt that he knew the answers. Yet they would not come within reach of his conscious mind.  He had little time to ponder this enigma however because at that moment he became aware of a second presence in the room. He turned. A man stood just inside the open door.  The naked one stared at the other with an interest that left no room for self-consciousness nor shame. \"Who are you?\" he asked.  \"My name is John Pride,\" the man answered. He was a man of erect bearing and though there was wonder and surprise in his voice he bore himself with a quiet dignity. \"And now,\" he added, \"may I ask you the same question?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The naked man looked down at his own body and for the first time seemed conscious of its nudity. He glanced around the room and saw a robe of royal purple lying across a chair by the bed. He stepped over and lifted the robe and put it on. As he was tying the rich purple cord around his waist he looked frankly back at John Pride and said, \"I do not know. I honestly do not know.\"  John Pride said, \"I have wondered what I would find in this cavern--wondered through the years. Only in my wildest fancies did I tell myself that a fellow human--or even a living creature--awaited me here. But now I find this is true.\"  The younger man regarded his visitor with a calmness that belied any wariness between them. John Pride noted this with admiration and respect. The young man said, \"Won't you be seated?\" and when his guest was comfortable, regarded him with a smile. \"Perhaps there are some things we should talk over.\"  \"Perhaps there are. You say you do not know your own name?\"  \"That only begins to sum up my ignorance. I am not only unaware of my identity but I haven't the faintest notion of what this place is--where it is--or how I came here.\"  It was John Pride's turn to stare. While doing so, he analyzed the younger man keenly. He saw honesty and an inner warmth that attracted him. There was something almost godlike in the clean lines of the body he had seen and in the face. These things coupled with what he already knew, intrigued him mightily and he resolved to approach this strange affair with an open mind and not play the role of the unbelieving cynic. It was time to go ahead.         *       *       *       *       *  John Pride said, \"First, are you aware that there is another in this mansion--or was?\"  \"I did not even know this was a mansion. It seems only one room.\"  \"It is an enormous structure set deep in the forest.\"  \"This other one--?\"  \"A very old man. He died as I arrived here tonight.\"  \"You do not know his name or how came he here?\"  \"I have a vague idea.\"  The young man's dazzling blue eyes narrowed in thought. \"A while ago you said you have wondered through the years as to what you would find in this room. That indicates you were aware of its existence.\"  \"True. Perhaps at this point I had better tell you the complete story--as much of it as I know.\"  \"I would be in your debt.\"  \"No, I will merely be discharging the last of a very old obligation.\"  With that, John Pride took from his pocket a small leather covered book. He handled it gently, almost with affection, and said, \"This was my father's notebook. In it, is an account of this remarkable affair, put down by my great grandfather and handed down through the line. When my father died he placed it in my hand saying it entailed an obligation both business and personal and it was my obligation as well as his.  \"I have read the account of what transpired many times and with your permission I will put it into my own words. Then, when I am done, I will give you the book and the affair will be over so far as I and my family are concerned.\"  John Pride had settled back in his chair and was just ready to begin when the young man held up a sudden hand. \"Just one moment--please,\" he said, and a look of concentration came upon his face. Then he went on and his words took the form of a rhyme:      \"An ape, a boar, a stallion,      A land beyond the stars.      A virgin's feast, a raging beast,      A prison without bars.\"  He flushed and added: \"I don't know why I was possessed to recite that doggerel at just this moment but there is something strange about it. Strange in that I have a feeling it was taught to me at some long distant time in the past. I sense that it is very important to whatever destiny awaits me. Yet I know not who taught me the verse nor what it means.\"  \"That verse is inscribed in this book and I believe I know how it entered your mind and memory. I believe too, that I understand how you are able to converse with me though you know nothing of this land or even this room,\" John Pride said quietly.  \"Then please tell me!\"  \"I think it better that I start at the beginning rather than give you the story piece-meal. That way, your mind will be better able to assimilate and to judge.\"  \"I await your pleasure,\" the young man said with impatience he strove to conceal.  \"Very well,\" John Pride said, his eyes growing vague with a far-away look.     CHAPTER IV  _John Pride's Story_   \"I am a member,\" John Pride began, \"of a firm called Pride, Conroy, and Wilson. We are a very old firm of private bankers with offices in Wall Street. Both Conroy and Wilson died before I was born, leaving no issue, so the company has been controlled by a Pride for many years.  \"This affair in which we are interested had its inception one hundred years ago. At that time, a man came to see my great grandfather in his office. He was a most remarkable man and gained my grandfather's respect and confidence from the very first. He never stated from whence he came, being more interested in the future than in the past. He put up at a New York City hotel and my great grandfather knew there were three in his party; the man himself, another man and a woman both somewhat older than he.  \"At one time when my great grandfather visited them in their hotel suite, he saw the woman fleetingly as she was leaving the room. She was carrying something that he thought"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32953"],["title","Quest of the Golden Ape (#2)"],["body","have been an infant snuggled in a blanket. He could not be sure however and he did not ask questions.  \"The man was interested in obtaining a place of abode, a place that had to possess certain definite qualifications. First, it had to be built upon solid rock and set in the most secluded location possible.  \"Second, it had to be so completely free of legal involvements that when he secured title, no possible claim of another could ever be taken seriously enough to even cause the property to be visited. In short, the strange man said, details relevant to the property must integrate to a point where no one would visit it for one hundred years.\"  At this place in his narrative, John Pride stopped a moment to rest his voice. After a pause, the young man in the purple robe inquired, \"Why do you smile?\"  \"At the recollection. My great grandfather had just a white elephant--\"  \"A white elephant?\"  \"Merely a descriptive term. A place that had been built before the Revolution but which even at that early time had been bypassed by the trend of progress until it was completely isolated. No one wanted it. No one would ever want it so far as my great grandfather could judge.\"  \"Except this strange man you speak of.\"  \"Precisely. He was delighted with the place and when my great grandfather pointed out that even with the location and the high surrounding wall there was no guarantee that wandering adventurers might not move in and take possession at some distant date, the man smiled cryptically and said he would see to it that that did not occur.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The young man was scowling. \"I know that man. He is somewhere back in my mind, but he will not come forward.\"  John Pride regarded his listener for a moment and then went on. \"The man seemed in ample funds and paid for the property with a giant ruby the like of which my great grandfather had never before set eyes on.  \"But the affair was far from ended. The man moved his _m幯age_ into the mansion saying he would call upon my great grandfather later.         *       *       *       *       *  \"All the legal formalities had been of course taken care of--an indisputable deed, guaranteed by the strongest trust company in the land. But that was not enough.  \"After a few weeks, during which time the man had inquired of my great grandfather where certain materials could be obtained, he returned to the old gentleman's office with the most startling request of all.  \"He said that he had set in motion a procedure that would terminate in exactly one hundred years from a given moment and that he wished to retain grandfather's firm as trust agents in relation to that procedure. The duties of the firm would be negligible during the hundred-year period. My great grandfather and his issue were merely to remain completely away from the property which was certainly a simple thing to do.  \"But knowledge of what had taken place must be passed down to his son and in case the latter did not survive the one hundred years, to his son's son.  \"At this point my great grandfather interposed reality in the form of a question: 'I have a son but suppose he is so inconsiderate as to not duplicate with a male heir?'  \"The man smiled and said he was sure that would not be the case. He was right, but whether it was a gamble on his part or whether he spoke from a knowledge beyond us, we never knew.  \"But regardless--at the end of one hundred years the surviving issue was, by sacred trust, to be present in this mansion. The door of a vault beneath it would open and the trustee was to enter and deliver therein a written account of the series of events leading up to that moment.  \"In payment for this service, the man insisted upon presenting my great grandfather with jewels the value of which on a yearly basis transcended all our other income combined. My great grandfather demurred but the man said nothing brightens memory so much as material gain and he did not want the agreement to be forgotten.\"  \"What happened to the man?\" the young listener asked.  John Pride shook his head sadly. \"We never knew. When all the arrangements were made, he came again to the office, thanked my great sire for his services, and was never seen again.\"  \"He must have given you his name.\"  John Pride frowned. \"He used a name of course but there was the impression of its not being his true one. The book mentions this. The name he used was C. D. Bram.\"  \"Portox!\" the young man cried suddenly.  \"What did you say?\"  \"Portox. The name is back in my mind. I used it as I awoke.\"  \"A strange name.\"  \"And stranger still is the fact that I know nothing of it--wait!\" The young man's handsome features strained as he concentrated with all his power. Sweat stood out on his forehead. But then a look of disappointment came into his face and his broad shoulders sagged. \"No. The knowledge is somewhere back in my mind but I cannot capture it.\"  John Pride was about to speak but the young man stayed him with a sudden intense look. \"One thing however is very clear to me.\"  \"And that is--?\"  \"The face of my mother.\"  \"The woman who held you in her arms in the hotel suite?\"  \"No, I do not think so. But I see a face clearly in my mind. A sad and beautiful face. There is a marked resemblance between it and what I see in that mirror. She is the most beautiful woman who ever lived and I yearn to find her and take her in my arms.\"  \"I hope you succeed.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A tragic light appeared in the young man's eyes. \"But where is she? How can I find her? Why did she leave me in this place?\"  \"I do not have the answers to those questions. But I have a theory concerning you and the elapsed years.\"  \"Tell me!\"  John Pride spoke firmly but with obvious awe. \"I think you were brought here as an infant for some reason known only to the one who called himself C. D. Bram.\"  \"Or Portox.\"  \"Perhaps. I think you were placed in that bed and left there for one hundred years.\"  \"But--\"  \"Consider. That door has never been opened. There is certainly no other exit to this cavern.\"  \"And I have no recollection of ever having lived before,\" the young man said slowly.  \"Yet you can converse with me. You obviously have been given an education.\"  \"But how?\"  \"It is known that knowledge can be injected into the subconscious while the receiver sleeps. I'm sure the man you insist upon calling Portox was aware of this--this and perhaps other scientific miracles. Who are we to say that you were not nourished by some means beyond our knowledge?\"  But that investigation was never to be made because as John Pride extended his hand to touch the box it suddenly burst into a glow and he withdrew his fingers quickly.  Before the younger man could answer a glowing point of light sprang into being and brightened and a wave of searing heat erupted from the walls of the room, searing the eyes of John Pride and leaving him to grope helplessly as in the heart of a furnace. The younger man was beyond his reach. Blinding pain caused him to reel.     CHAPTER V  _Question Upon Question_   John Pride opened his eyes as a moan escaped his lips. The haze cleared and he found himself lying upon a cool stone floor looking up into the concerned face of the younger man. \"What happened?\" John Pride asked feebly. He tried to refocus.  \"I don't know except that the heat of that fire was upon us with such swiftness that we were almost incapacitated. I picked you up and started walking. Fortunately I moved in the direction of the door. Otherwise we would have been doomed.\"  \"I am in your debt.\"  \"No more so than I in yours.\"  \"Did you extinguish the fire?\"  \"It burned out of its own accord. But only after the cave was completely gutted. There is nothing left in there but the bare rock walls.\"  John Pride sat up with quick concern. \"The book!\"  \"It is gone.\" The young man looked ruefully down at his own naked body. \"Gone--together with my precious robe.\"  \"That can easily be replaced along with other raiment but the book--I was supposed to deliver it--\"  \"--to the cavern. You did that, my friend. It was not through you that the fire consumed it. You have dispatched your obligation. Let your mind be at ease.\"  John Pride got to his feet. He shook his head in the negative. \"No. A portion of my obligation still exists. Fortunately I did not bring forth the second and last item I was to place in the cavern.\"  \"The second item?\"  \"Yes, and I believe the most important.\"         *       *       *       *       *  With that, Pride took from his pocket a small box wrapped in heavy material and sealed and resealed with a sort of rubberized wax.  \"This,\" he said. \"I know not what is in the box nor I think, did my father, my grandfather, nor my great grandfather before me. We have been given to understand that its delivery to the cavern was the most important single duty of the trust. So I now place it in your hands, praying that this act fulfills the long-standing obligation of my family.\"  The younger man had salvaged a portion of his robe, a length of material that went over his shoulders and draped skimpily down the sides of his body. This did nothing whatever in the way of covering his nudity but rather accentuated and added to it.  He took the box and was scanning it with great interest when the excitement and strenuous action of the preceding few minutes again took grip upon John Pride's comparatively less rugged physique.  His eyes closed and he began sinking again to the floor whereupon the younger man slipped the box hastily in the pocket that had not burned away from his robe and caught John Pride in his arms.  He lifted the elder man and carried him up from the mansion caverns and into the great hall that swept forward to the main entrance. As he walked, bearing the heavy burden as though it were but a mere feather, he was of two minds.  One mind entertained concern for his new-found friend and the other was occupied with interest in these new"]]]
