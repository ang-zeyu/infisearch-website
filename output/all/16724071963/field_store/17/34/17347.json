(For the selfishness that crucified was only one fruit of sin.)  Out of that realisation of the horror of sin there sprang an ethical passion--a passion which in the heart and in the world waged ceaseless war on selfishness and all the devices of evil. Thus humanity was lifted out of the mire.  They girded themselves to fight that dread and hateful power which crucified the Holy One.  Like the wind blowing in from the sea that sweeps before it the foul miasma that lies over the valleys, so that men look up and see the heavens and feel a new vigour moving in their blood, so a breath from the living God came stirring the foul places of humanity, and the eyes, no longer blinded by the exhalations of evil passions, saw the ideal of purity arise before their eyes, and they turned to climb towards the clearer vision.  Through the revelation of purity in the face of Jesus Christ and the realisation of the awfulness of that power which crowned that purity with thorns, there came to humanity the dawning of deliverance from sin--a deliverance still going on to its fruition.  ***  History is for ever repeating itself, and to-day the process of humanity's deliverance from evil will gather momentum and advance a long way towards the final triumph.  For just as men only realised the hatefulness of sin when they saw it laid upon Jesus Christ, so will it be also to-day.  A generation that had lost the sense of sin beholds sin laid upon millions of men, working woe unspeakable, and, beholding, learns anew what sin is and the hatefulness of it.  For these millions of men grappling with death, what are they but humanity's sin-bearers. On them is laid the burden of the sins of this generation.  The selfishness, greed, ambition, lust--all the passions which sweep men to wars of conquest--have poured the vials of misery on their heads.  The son of the widow sitting on the mort-safe, who now lies in a nameless grave, he bore it.  The bearing of it killed him.  And as humanity will realise its horror, the word sin will once more burn red before men's eyes, and there will arise that passion for righteousness which will lay sin low even as the dust.  There will ring round the world the compelling cry that this power of hell must not for ever hold humanity in its grip--that ruthless ambition, militarism, despotism must be made to cease from the face of the earth.  Once more the shadow of the Cross will mean salvation to men.  ***  There was another power also that stirred the world under the shadow of the Cross, and that was the power of self-sacrifice.  There came to men an overwhelming realisation that at the heart of the universe was the Spirit of self-sacrifice, and that the Cross was but the expression of it.  They realised that the greatest thing a man can do with his life is to lay it down.  And as men realise to-day that the Cross still abides in the heart of God, so that in all their affliction He is afflicted, there comes to them the feeling that the one way of coming nearest to His heart is the way of self-sacrifice.  Under the shadow of the Cross now lifted up, a nation that sought life's pleasures has suddenly thrilled with the glory of self-sacrifice.  What is it that sustains the men who go down to the earthly hell of ruthless war?  It is just this--the consciousness, newly wakened, of how glorious a thing it is to die for King and country, for home and kindred.  They are content to be blotted out if only the race will live, to descend to the abyss that the nation may be exalted.  Under the shadow of the Cross self-sacrifice has become once more the only rock on which our feet can stand secure.  Men charge across fields of death with the light of it in their eyes.  They are raised into the fellowship of the Cross.  And we are raised with them.  If I could only tell the bowed widow sitting there on the mort-safe the glorious fellowship with which her son is numbered, she would again lift up her face to the light.  He has died that we may live.  Greater love hath no man than this--nor yet greater glory.  But she needs not to be told; she knows it already.  She knows it far better than you or I do, for she feels it.  In the deep places of life where words are meaningless, her dumb heart feels the mystery of sin-bearing and the glory of self-sacrifice.  By a faculty deeper and truer far than reason, in the depths of the soul where the Unseen Spirit moves revealing the things that are of lasting worth, she has learned in meekness and suffering that divine wisdom which is hid from the wise.  She knows that the road that goes by Calvary up to the Cross is the one road along which the feet can come to God.  She knows that her son has walked along that road, and that, because of his bearing the cross laid upon him, and his dying while bearing it, God has brought him into that joy which all the cross-bearers see shining beyond the darkness and the woe.  And because she has thus entered into the secret place of the Most High, and has felt the touch of God, she is ready to greet the day of still greater sacrifice.  ***  In the evening, when the curtains were drawn, I took up a magazine and read an article.  It was a bitter invective against Christianity and the Church.  Nineteen centuries of the religion of the Cross--and this holocaust as the fruit.  It is amazing the blindness of the jaundiced eye.  It would be as reasonable to blame the Founder of Christianity for His own crucifixion as to blame Christianity for the fact that the wicked have continued to crucify Him.  These things are so not because, but in spite, of Christianity.  Grievous as war now is, yet it is not war as in the days before the Cross was erected on Calvary.  When Ulysses asked Agamemnon for sanction to bury the body of Ajax, the King was greatly annoyed.  \"What do you mean?\" he answered, \"do you feel pity for a dead enemy?\"  That was the spirit of war in the old heathen world--the spirit which had no mercy on the living and no pity for the dead.  Slowly but surely the spirit of Christ fettered the spirit of hate and dethroned the spirit of revenge.  We now minister to the wounded and bury the dead enemy with the pity and the honour we render to our own.  We can trace the evolution of peace through the centuries.  Wars between individuals have ceased.  A century and a half ago warring clans in Scotland dyed the heather red; to-day wars between tribes have ceased.  There remains only war between nations, and already there are great nations between whom war is unthinkable.  If we in these days wage war with Germany, yet we in these days also celebrate the hundredth anniversary of unbroken peace with the United States of America.  If we bewail the failure of Christianity in the former, let us be grateful for the triumph of Christianity in the latter.  Formerly war was the normal condition; now to the moral consciousness of Christendom war is an outrage.  We only need to look beneath the surface to realise that Galilee is conquering Corsica, and will conquer at the last.  Beneath the shadow of the Cross men will at last find healing for their grievous wounds.  ***  And as a symbol thereof the doors of the sanctuaries of peace will be flung wide open, and no burdened heart will find the House of God locked and barred against groping hands.  One fruit of these grievous days may well be that the Church will realise that it does not become her to occupy a lower plane than that heathen temple in ancient Rome, whose door was shut not day or night while men were dying in battle.  In the coming days when the mothers of sorrow come to their dead, over whose graves the falling leaves flutter as a benediction, they will not be left sitting on the iron mort-safe.  The open door will invite them into the sanctuary of peace, and they will croon the coronach of their woe in the holy place.  For they are the priesthood of this generation, offering up the most precious sacrifice--and the door of the holy place must be open to them.  And there, in the sanctuaries of peace, their sorrow will be transmuted into joy.     IV  The Power of Prayer    IV  For eight centuries the Church of St. Giles has been the centre of the religious life of Scotland.  At all times of sorrow the nation has turned to it, and within its walls, consecrated by the prayers of so many generations, the surcharged heart has voiced its woe in the presence of the Unseen.  But in all the years of the dim and fading past there never was a day like this in which we now stand.  Death has come as a grim spectre, and has looked into our eyes.  The winds carry to our ears the moans of our perishing sons, dying gloriously for freedom on the bloody fields of Flanders.  The great ships guard our shores, and we know that if that vigil failed, our cities and villages and fair countryside would become as Louvain and the Low Country. Death itself would be welcome rather than that.  If there ever came to any nation a call to seek the refuge which eye has not seen, that call soundeth persistently, compellingly in our ears.  And that call soundeth not in vain.  To-day[1] the two great Churches of Scotland met as one in St. Giles, the days of their misunderstanding ended, to pray for King and country--for all the things which make life beautiful.  They have come through days of alienation and isolation, but to-day they are with one accord in one place.  And in their hearts only one purpose--to seek the blessing of God for their nation.   [1] November 18, 1914.   ***  As one sat there, under the tattered flags on which many bloody fights for freedom are emblazoned, and watched the stream of men flow into the church, what memories came crowding through the echoing corridors of time.  Four hundred years ago there came to Edinburgh the news of Flodden, and out of the closes the women rushed to St. Giles, until round all the altars there was no room to kneel because of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33635"],["title","The Great Discovery (#7)"],["body","crowd wailing for their dead.  The moaning of their lamentation was as the sound of the surf wailing on the shore, and their sobbing as the cry of the grinding pebbles in the backwash of the tide.  But the city fathers could stand upright even in that most cruel day when the cloud of destruction was creeping over the Pentlands; and there is the note of the heroic in that resolution which called all the able-bodied men to rally to the defence of the capital, and exhorted \"the good women to pass to the kyrk, and pray whane tyme requires for our Soveraine Lord and his Army, and neichbouris being thereat.\"  That proclamation stirs the blood!  They are dust, these fathers of ours, but their spirit is all alive, throbbing in the heart of us--their far-away children.  Never did a race meet its Sedan in a sublimer spirit than that.  The strong, at toll of bell and tuck of drum, manned the ramparts, and the women filled St. Giles' and sent heavenward their cries.  The bodies of such a race may for a brief season be brought to subjection, but their souls are invincible--and it is the soul that always conquers.  And here to-day it is the same.  From every part of Scotland men have come, and they passed \"to the kirk to pray for our Sovereign Lord and his Army.\"  True, there has been no Flodden and no Sedan; but it is by the good hand of God upon us that the enemy was frustrated in his eagerness for another Sedan.  And it is in part the prayer of thanksgiving that is laid to-day upon His altar, and in part the petition that His mercies may be continued to the nation in the cruel days to come.  ***  What a sanctuary for a nation's prayers, this church, where Kings have prayed and gone forth to die in battle; where Queens have wept as the voice of judgment, grim and stern, untouched by tenderness or love, sounded in the ear; where three thousand people dissolved in tears as the good Regent, foully slain, was borne to his grave.  Over it passed wave after wave of fanaticism and barbarism; and at last it fell into the hands of the restorers--more ruthless far than Goths or Vandals! But, through it all, the house of God survived; and, apparelled once more in some of its pristine glory, it opens its doors to a nation that once more seek after its God.  And above us, as we sit there, hang the colours of our Scottish regiments stirring our patriotism, assuring us that the men who guarded these flags on many bloody fields were guarded by God, and that we are still in His keeping.  What a place this is in which to set vibrating that note of patriotism which now quivers from Maiden Kirk to John o' Groat's.  These colours there--they are the most eloquent things on earth, for they pertain to the realm of symbols.  Words are poor compared to tears, and that is because tears belong to the world of symbols.  That tattered banner there belonged to the Gordon Highlanders, and was carried through the Peninsula and the Crimea.  Woven in faded letters you can read on it still Corunna, Almarez, Pyrenees, Waterloo.  Ah! these flags tell of a devotion stronger than death, rekindle the memories of the day when stern silence fell on the ranks, as the Highland Brigade breasted the slopes of the Alma until Sir Colin Campbell lifted his hat and they rushed on the foe with the slogan of victory; and that other day when \"the thin red line tipped with steel\" rolled back the surge of the Cossacks; aye, and of a hundred such days when men went down joyously to death that the race might be free and live.  Waterloo!--it is on many flags.  And we remember how the Man of Destiny himself, as he saw his ranks yield before the onslaught of the Highlanders, did not restrain his admiration for his enemies, but exclaimed with the true soldier's generosity, \"Les braves Ecossais\"--\"Brave, brave Scotsmen\" (what a contrast to \"French's contemptible little Army\").  The hands that carried, the hearts that thrilled at the waving of these flags, their fame will never perish.    \"On the slopes of Quatre Bras   The Frenchmen saw them stand unbroken.       *    *    *    *    *   On the day of Waterloo   The pibroch blew where fire was hottest.       *    *    *    *    *   When the Alma heights were stormed   Foremost went the Highland bonnets.       *    *    *    *    *   As it was in days of yore,   So the story shall be ever.     *    *    *    *    *   Think then of the name ye bear,   Ye that wear the Highland tartan.     *    *    *    *    *   Zealous of its old renown,   Hand it down without a blemish.\"  As the eye looks along the nave up into the choir and sees the gleam of red, colours after colours, there comes the memory of words--\"We have heard with our ears, O God, and our fathers have told us what work Thou didst in their days in the times of old....  Through Thee will we push down our enemies....\"  The unseen God who has led His people through so many and great dangers will not forsake them now.  ***  There is a tablet where formerly stood the door that led to Haddo's Hole, and there hangs on a pillar the flag that pertains of truth to the realm of romance.  Men with their hearts hot with indignation buried it in Pretoria in 1880, and put above it the inscription \"Resurgam.\"  Afterwards the Colonel recovered it and brought it home. When war broke out again his widow restored it to the regiment--the Royal Scots Fusiliers.  In 1881 that regiment was the last to leave the Transvaal; in 1900 it was the first to enter the Transvaal--as the inscription narrates.  And by the direction of Lord Roberts, when Pretoria was occupied, this identical flag was run up amid the shouts of the victors.  Now it rests here.  \"Resurgam\"--it is the unquenchable spirit of an invincible nation.  If only the manhood of Scotland could be gathered into this Church, under these flags, and the story they tell were put into words, pulsating with passion--then the ranks of our Army would be filled up in a week.  What a lack of imagination we reveal!  We teach dates, thinking we are teaching history.  The only way to teach history is by flags, and all they stand for.  When Douglas threw the heart of Bruce among his enemies he cried, \"Lead thou on as thou wast wont and Douglas will follow thee or die.\"  In the spirit of Douglas our fathers followed the flags, and we will follow in the steps of our fathers and face death with undaunted hearts as they were wont.  There comes to us the shouting of their triumph, and we cry: \"Lead on; we will follow or die.\"  This grey church, St. Giles', is the temple of patriotism. Therefore our feet turn towards it in dark days, and we say, \"Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem!\"  ***  How the old words are born for us anew as we thus meet as one \"to entreat God for the broken peace of Christendom.\"  We sing \"God is our refuge and our strength,\" but there is a note of intensity in the singing now such as we never knew before.  Men close their eyes, and stand, the world blotted out, before their God, realising that He and He alone is the one refuge, the only giver of victory.  We hear the old story read of Moses holding up his hands and Israel prevailing on the plains below; but it is not Israel we see travailing in battle, but our own brothers in the rain-sodden trenches, and we feel the uprising of the ceaseless intercession of a nation that has anew found its God.  It is not the right hand that assureth victories; it is that spirit of enthusiasm, that passion for righteousness which filleth the heart, and that spirit is as the wind blowing where it listeth--and it cometh out of the Unseen at the call of our prayers.  When in other days we prayed for the King it was in the spirit of cold formalism.  But now a lump rises in the throat as we invoke the blessing and protection of Heaven for the solitary man who is the symbol of the unity of our Empire, and who watcheth over its destinies day and night, and who has sent his son to face death with the meanest of his subjects.  We hear the glorious words: \"If God be for us, who can be against us?\" and they are written for ourselves.  We, who fight for the truth of word and for the freedom and deliverance of the oppressed, can feel that God is for us, and that all is well.  And when we pray, our voices rising as one, \"Thy kingdom come,\" we can see that kingdom coming through blood and tears, cleansing the foul places and establishing peace on everlasting foundations.  It is a new day that has dawned for us--a day in which we stand united as the subjects of the one King, as the sons of the one God--and the things that separated us one from another are swept away.  What the conferring of the wise found so difficult to achieve, the roaring of the guns has accomplished.  God teacheth his people by sending them through the purifying fires.  ***  In these prayers in St. Giles' there is a directness which shows that we are there for a definite purpose.  We no longer use qualifying words.  We cry for victory.  There is a bloodless form of prayer which some use and which sends the worshipper away with an aching heart.  It is the prayer that never prays directly for victory.  \"Thy will be done,\" it prays, in the spirit of submission.  But prayer is not submission; it is a wrestling.  In other days our fathers wrestled in prayer and prevailed.  \"I spent the night in prayer,\" wrote Oliver Cromwell, in critical days; \"I prayed God that He would guide us against the enemy.  We were simple fellows of the country, and they were men of blood and fashion, but the Lord delivered them into our hands.  By His grace we killed five thousand.  If He continues to show mercy we will kill some more to-morrow.\"  Such were the Ironsides, \"men of a spirit,\" who broke the charges of the Cavaliers, as the cliff dashes back in white spray the rush of the billows.  This was also the language of the Covenanters of old; and though we no longer use such plainness of speech, we mean the same.  There is a place for tenderness; but"]]]
