He was strong and cheery himsel', but fower o' his mates were chilled to the bane, and Ah wacht 'em shiver to death richt afore ma een.  \"It was aboot daylicht when we pickit up a' that was left o' the crew o' the _Killarney_, and aboot an hour efter we fell in wi' the _Sportsman_, wha passed us a hawser and tried to tow, stern-first, what was left o' the _Seagull_. Ah didna see what was wrang, but they tellt me that the wreck o' the stern and the helm bein' jammed hard a-sta'bo'd made sae much drag that the cable partit. Then there was naithing else to do--sin' the _Seagull_ cudna steam--but to sink her wi' gun-fire. The captain askit permission for this by W.T., and when it came they ditched the books and signals, transferred abody to the _Sportsman_, and then gae her a roun' or twa at the water-line wi' the _Sportsman's_ guns. Doon she gaed, and that,\" he concluded with a grin, \"is the true yarn o' the sinkin' o' the _Seagull_. If only o' ma mates try to mak' ye b'lieve that she foundert 'count o' bein' hit and holed by a 'human proj' kent as Jock Campbell, I'm hopin' ye'll no listen to 'em.\"     CHAPTER II  \"FIREBRAND\"   It was a little incident which occurred one night when the Grand Fleet was returning to Base from one of its periodical sweeps through the North Sea that set Able-seaman Melton talking of the things he had seen and felt and heard the time he was standing anti-submarine watch in the _Firebrand_, when her flotilla of destroyers mixed itself up with a squadron of German cruisers in the course of the \"dog-fight\" which concluded the battle of Jutland.  I had found him, muffled to the eyes and dancing a jangling jig on a sleet-slippery steel plate to keep warm, when I picked my precarious way along the coco-matted deck and climbed up to the after searchlight platform of the Flotilla Leader I chanced to be in at the time. A fairly decent day was turning into a dirty night, and the steadily thickening mistiness which accompanied a sodden rain in process of transformation into soft snow had reduced the visibility to a point where the Commander-in-Chief deemed it safer for the Fleet to put back to open sea and take no further chances among the treacherous currents and rocky islands that beset the approaches to the Northern Base.  The Flagship, which had received the order by wireless, flashed \"Destroyers prepare to take station for screening when Fleet alters to easterly course at nine o'clock,\" and shortly before that hour the Flotilla Leader made the signal to execute. Almost immediately I felt the hull of the _Flyer_ take on an accelerated throb as her speed was increased, and a moment later the wake began to boil higher as the helm was put hard-a-starboard to bring her round. We were steaming a cable's length on the starboard bow of the _Olympus_, the leading ship of the squadron at the time, and the carrying out of the manoeuvre involved the _Flyer's_ leading her division across the head of the battleship line and down the other side on an opposite course, so that the destroyers would be in a position to resume night-screening formation when the fleet had finished turning.  Just how the captain of the _Flyer_ happened to cut his course so fine I never learned, but the patchiness of the drifting mist must have had a good deal to do with making him misjudge his distance. At any rate, just as we had turned through nine or ten points, I suddenly saw the ominously bulking bows of the _Olympus_ come juggernauting out of the night, with the amorphous loom of the bridge and foretop towering monstrously above. The _Flyer_ seemed fairly to jump out of the water at the kick her propellers gave her as the turbines responded to the bridge's call for \"More steam,\" and a spinning puff of smoke darkened the glow above the funnels for a moment as fresh oil was sprayed upon the fires beneath the boilers.  It was a good deal like a cat scurrying in front of a speeding motor-car, and the consequences would have been more or less similar had not one of the _Olympus's_ swarming lookouts, peering into the darkness from his screened nest, gathered hint of the disaster that menaced in time to warn the forebridge. The great super-dreadnought responded to her helm very smartly considering her tonnage, and she turned just far enough to starboard to avoid grinding us under. I could almost look up through the port hawse-pipe as the flare of her bow loomed above my head, and the man standing by the depth-charges on the all-but-grazed stern of the _Flyer_ might well have been pardoned even if the story his mates afterwards told of his action on this occasion were true--that he had tried to fend off one of the largest battleships afloat with a boat-hook.  A silhouette against the barely perceptible glow at the back of the forebridge of a \"brass-hatted\" officer shaking his fist as though in the act of ramping and roaring like a true British sailor moved by righteous anger; a forty or fifty degree heel to starboard as the curling bow-wave of the _Olympus_ thwacked resoundingly along her port side, and the _Flyer_ drove on into the sleet-shot darkness to blow off accumulated steam in rolling clouds, allow her fluttering pulse to become normal, and resume the even tenor of her way.  Melton, A.B., whistling over and over the opening bars of the chorus of \"Do You Want Us to Lose the War?\" started his metallically clanking jig again, but presently, like a man with something on his mind, sidled over and shoved his Balaklava-bordered face against the outside of the closely-reefed hood of my \"lammy\" coat, and muttered thickly something about being afraid he had got himself into trouble. When I had pulled loose a snap and improved communications by unmuffling a lee ear, I learned that it had just occurred to the good chap that he failed to report to the bridge the battleship he had sighted \"fifty yards to the port beam,\" and he was wondering whether there would be a \"strafe\" coming from the skipper about it.  \"Fact is, sir,\" he said, speaking brokenly as the galloping gusts every now and then forced a word back into his mouth, \"that that rip-rarin' stem, with the white foam flyin' off both sides of it, bearing down right for where I was standin'--all that was so like what I saw the night of Jutland in the _Firebrand_ that--that the turn it give me took my mind right back and--and I wasn't thinkin' o' anything else till the _'Lympus_ was gone by.\"  I assured him that, since the _Olympus_ had doubtless been sighted from the bridge several winks before she had been visible from his less-favourable vantage, they would probably have been too busy to respond to his call at the voice-pipe even had he tried to report what he saw.  \"If I were you,\" I said, \"I would forget all about that, and try to explain how a cruiser that the _Firebrand_ was about to ram bow-to-bow\" (I had, of course, already heard something of that dare-devilish exploit) \"could have looked to you like the _Olympus_ ramping down on a right-angling course and threatening to slice off the _Flyer's_ stern with all her depth-charges. I quite understood that one ramming is a good deal like another, as far as a big ship hitting a destroyer fair and square is concerned, but----\"  \"'Twasn't that _first_ cru'ser 'tall, sir,\" Melton interrupted, nuzzling into my \"lammy\" hood again to make himself heard. \"Twas 'nother 'un, sir--a wallopin' big un. The seas was stiff wi' cru'sers fer a minit, sir, an' no sooner was we clear o' the first un than the second come tearin' down on us, tryin' to cut us in two amidships. An' that last un was a battl' cru'ser nigh as big as the _'Lympus_, all shot up in the funnels and runnin' wild an' bloody-minded like a mad bull. We were pretty nigh to bein' stopped dead, an' if she hadn't been slower'n cold grease wi' her helm she'd ha' eat us right up.\"  There had been nothing of malice aforethought in my action in cornering Melton on the searchlight platform that night, for, as it chanced, I had failed to learn up to that moment that he had been in the famous _Firebrand_ at Jutland. Nor, with the wind and sea getting up as fast as the glass and the thermometer were going down, was the time or the place quite what a man would have chosen for anything in the way of cosy fireside reminiscence. But, both these facts notwithstanding, I felt that, since I was leaving the _Flyer_ to go to another base directly she arrived in harbour on the morrow, it would be criminal to neglect the opportunity of hearing what was perhaps the most sportingly spectacular of all the Jutland destroyer actions related by one who was actually in it. I did not dare to distract Melton's attention from his lookout by drawing him into talking while he was still on watch, but, when he was relieved at ten o'clock, I waylaid him at the foot of the ladder with a pot of steaming hot ship's cocoa (foraged from the galley by a sympathetic ward-room steward) and both pockets of my \"lammy\" coat filled with the remnants of a box of assorted Yankee \"candy\" looted from the American submarine in which I had been on patrol the week before.  Melton rose to the lure instantly--or perhaps I should say \"fell to the bribe\"--for the British bluejacket, if only he were given a chance to develop, is quite as sweet of tooth as his brother Yank. Because I could hardly take him to the captain's cabin, which I was occupying for the moment, for a yarn, and because he, likewise, could not take me down to the mess deck to disturb the off-watch sleepers with our chatter, there was nothing to do but carry on as best we could in the friendly lee of one of the funnels.  It was a night of infernal inkiness by now, and only clinging patches of soft snow and their blanker blankness revealed the dimly guessable lines of whaler and cowls and torpedo tubes and the loom of the loftier bridge. The battleship line was masked completely by the double curtain of the darkness"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33438"],["title","Sea-Hounds (#6)"],["body","the snow, and only a tremulous greyness, barely discernible in the intervals of the flurries of flakes where the starboard bow-wave curled back from the _Olympus_, gave an intermittent bearing to help in keeping station. Underfoot was the blackness of the pit, not the faintest gleam reflecting from the waves washing over the weather side to swirl half-knee high about our sea boots. Even overhead all that was visible were fluttering patches of snow flakes dancing through the haloes of pale rose radiance that crowned the tops of the funnels. The wail of the wind in the wireless aerials, the crash of the surging beam seas, the throb of the propellers, and the pussy-cat purr of the spinning turbines--these were the fit accompaniment to which Melton A.B. recited to me the epic of the _Firebrand_ at Jutland.  The cocoa I quaffed mug for mug with Melton, down to the last of the sweet, sustaining \"settlings\" in the bottom of the pot; but the candy I kept in reserve to draw on from time to time as it was needed to lubricate his tongue and stoke the smouldering fires of his memory. I started him off with a red-and-white \"barber's pole\" stick, which took not a little fumbling with mittened hands to extract from its greased tissue paper wrapper, and the seductive fragrance of crunched peppermint mingled with the acrid fumes of burning petroleum as he leaned close and began to tell how the ----th Flotilla, to which the _Firebrand_ belonged, screening the ----th B.S. of the Battle Fleet, came upon the scene toward the end of the long summer afternoon. He had witnessed Beatty's consummate manoeuvre of \"crossing the T\" of the enemy line with the four that remained of his battered First Battle Cruiser Squadron, and he had seen the main Battle Fleet baulked of its action the lowering mists and the closing in of darkness; but it was not until full night had clapped down its lid that the fun for the _Firebrand_ really began.  \"It was just 'twixt daylight an' dark,\" he said, reaching me a steadying hand in the darkness as the _Flyer_ teetered giddily down the back of a receding sea, \"that the flotilla dropped back to take stashun 'stern the battl'ships we was screenin'. The _Killarney_ was leadin' an' after her came the _Firebran'_, _Seagull_, _Wreath_, an' _Consort_, makin' up the First Divishun. _Wreath_ an' _Consort_ sighted some Hun U-boats and 'stroyers while this move was on, an' plunk'd off a few shots at 'em. Don't think wi' any fatal consequence. Then there come the rattle of light gun fire from the south'ard, like from cru'sers or battleships repellin' T.B.D.'s. Then it was all serene for mor'n an 'our, an' then all hell opens up.\"  I suspected, from the sounds he made, that Melton had bitten into a block of milk chocolate without removing its wrapping of foil and paper, but presently his enunciation grew less explosive and more intelligible.  \"It was Hun cru'sers drivin' down on us from the starboard quarter that started the monkey-show,\" he said, \"an' that bein' the nor'west it was hardly where we'd reason to expect 'em from. It looks like we had 'em clean cut off, wi' the 'hole Battl' Fleet steamin' 'tween 'em an' their way back home, an' that they was tryin' to sneak through in the darkness. The _Wreath_, at the end o' the line nearest 'em, spotted 'em first, and she, 'cause she didn't want to give herself 'way wi' flashin', reported what she'd seen by low-power W.T. to the rest o' the flotilla. Course I--standin' watch aft--didn't know nothin' 'bout that signal, so that the first I hears o' the Huns was when they all opened up on the poor ol' _Killarney_, 'cause she was the leader. I s'pose, and she started firin' back at their flashes.  \"The leadin' Hun flashed his searchlight on the _Killarney_ as he opened up, but shut off sharp when _Killarney_ came back at him. I could see some o' the projes flittin' right down the light beam until it blinked off, an' it was a flock of two or three of these that I kept my eye on all the way till they bashed into the _Killarney's_ bridge and busted. She was zigzaggin' a coupl' o' points on _Firebrand's_ starboard bow just then, so my standin' aft didn't prevent my gettin' a good look at what was happenin'. I could see the bodies o' four or five men flyin' up wi' the wreckage o' the explosion, an' then, all in a minnit, she was rollin' in flames from the funnels right for'ard. By the light o' it I could see the crews o' the 'midships and after guns workin' 'em like devils, an' twice anyhow, an' I think three times, I saw a bright, shiny slug slip over the side, an' knew they were loosin' mouldies to try to get their own back from the Hun.  \"The sea was boilin' up red as blood where the light from the burnin' _Killarney_ fell on the spouts the Huns' projes was throwin' up all round her. She was the fairest mark ever a gun trained on, and p'raps that was what tempted the Hun to keep pumpin' projes at her instead o' givin' more attenshun to the rest of the divishun trailin' astern. That was what gave _Firebran'_ her first chance o' alterin' the Hun navy list that night.  \"The second cru'ser in the Hun line was bearin' right abeam to starboard by now, an' I could see by her gun-flashes she was of good size, wi' four long funnels fillin' up all the deck 'tween her two masts. She was firing fast in salvoes wi' all the guns that would bear on the burnin' _Killarney_. I could just make out by the light from the _Killarney_, which was growin' stronger every minnit, that the crew of our after torpedo tube was gettin' busy, an' while I was watchin' 'em, over flops the mouldie and starts to run. I knew it was aimed for one or t'other o' the two leadin' Huns, but wasn't dead sure which till I saw the after funnels an' mainmast o' the second toppl' over an' a big flash o' fire take their place. Then it looked like there was exploshuns right off fore an' aft, and then fires broke out all over her from stem to stern. Next thing I knows, she takes a big list to starboard, an' over she goes, wi' more exploshuns throwin' up spouts o' steam, as she rolls under. The second mouldie--it got away right after the first--was never needed to finish the job. The _Firebran'_ had evened up the score for the _Killarney_, wi' a good margin over.  \"The captain turned away to reload mouldies after that, an' just as we swung out o' line I saw a salvo straddle the _Killarney_, and two or three shells hit square 'tween her funnels an' after sup'rstruct'r'. They must have gone off in her engine room, for there was more steam than fire risin' from her as we turned an' left her astern, an' she looked stopped dead. A Hun cru'ser was closin' the blazin' wreck o' her, firm' hard; but, by Gawd, what d'you think I saw. The only patch on the ol' _Killarney_ that was free o' the ragin' fires was her stern, an' from there the steady flashes of her after gun showed it was bein' worked as fast an' reg'lar as ever I seen it done at any night-firin' practice. I looked to see her blow up every minnit, but she was still spittin' wi' that littl' after gun when the sudden flashin' up of the fightin' lights for'ard turned my attenshun nearer home.  \"I could just make out a line of what looked like 'stroyers headin' cross our bows, an' thought we'd stumbled into 'nother nest o' Huns till they answered back wi' the signal o' the day, an' I knew it was one of our own flotillas we'd been catchin' up to. That flashin' up o' lights come near to doin' for us tho', for it showed us up to a big Hun steamin' three or four miles off on the port beam, an' he claps a searchlight on us an' chases it up wi' a sheaf o' shells. The only proj that hit us bounced off wi'out doin' much hurt to the ship, but some flyin' hunks o' it smashed the mouldie davit and knocked out most o' the crews o' the after tubes, includin' the T.G.M.[C] That put a stop to reloadin' operashuns wi' a mouldie in only one o' the tubes. By good luck we managed to zigzag out o' the searchlight beam right after that, an' was free to turn back an' try to start a divershun for the poor ol' _Killarney_.  [Footnote C: Torpedo Gunner's Mate.]  \"Her fires looked to be dyin' down when we first picked her up, but right after that some more projes bust on her an' she started blazin' harder than ever. I watched for the spittin' o' that littl' after gun, but when it come it looked to spurt right out o' the heart o' a blazin' furnace, showin' the fire was now burnin' from stem to stern. One more salvo plastered over her, an' that one got no reply. The good ol' '_Killy_' had shot her bolt, an' her finish looked a matter o' minnits.  \"It was plain enough if anyone was still livin' they was goin' to need pickin' up in a hurry, an' the captain put the _Firebran'_ at full speed to close her an' stan' by to give a han'. Just then I saw a Hun searchlight turned on and start feelin' its way up to where the _Killarney_ was burning, wi' a cru'ser followin' up the small end o' the beam, seemin' to be nosin' in to end the mis'ry. She did not bear right for a mouldie, but we opened up wi' the foremost gun, an' I saw the shells bustin' on her bridge and fo'c'sl' like rotten apples chucked 'against a wall. The light blinked off as the first proj hit home, but there was no way to tell if it was shot away or no. It was the second time that night that we'd done our bit to ease off the hell turned loose on the _Killarney_. Likewise it was the last. From then on we had our own partic'lar hell to wriggle out of, wi' no time left to play 'Venging Nemisus' to our stricken sisters. Just a big bonfire sittin' on the sea an' lickin' a hole in the night wi' its flames--that was the last I saw of the ol' _Killarney_.\"  Melton paused for a moment as if engrossed in the memories conjured up by his narrative, and I took advantage of the interval to hand him one of those most loved lollipops of Yankee youngster-hood, a plump, hard ball of toothsome saccharinity called--obviously from its resistant resiliency--an \"All-Day"]]]
