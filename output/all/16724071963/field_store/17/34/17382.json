As a chain is no stronger than its weakest link, just so the greatest load which can be hauled over a road is the load which can be hauled through the deepest mud hole or up the steepest hill on that road. The cost of haulage is, therefore, necessarily increased in proportion to the roughness of the surface or steepness of the grade. It costs one and one-half times as much to haul over a road having a five per cent grade and three times as much over one having a ten per cent grade as on a level road. As a perfectly level road can seldom be had, it is well to know the steepest allowable grade. If the hill be one of great length, it is sometimes best to have the lowest part steepest, upon which the horse is capable of exerting his full strength, and to make the slope more gentle toward the summit, to correspond with the continually decreasing strength of the fatigued animal.  So far as descent is concerned, a road should not be so steep that the wagons and carriages cannot be drawn down it with perfect ease and safety. Sir Henry Parnell considered that when the grade was no greater than one foot in thirty-five feet, vehicles could be drawn down it at a speed of twelve miles an hour with perfect safety. Gillespie says:  \"It has been ascertained that a horse can for a short time double his usual exertion; also, that on the best roads he exerts a pressure against his collar of about one thirty-fifth of the load. If he can double his exertion for a time, he can pull one thirty-fifth more, and the slope which would force him to lift that proportion would be, as seen from the above table, one of one in thirty-five, or about a three per cent grade. On this slope, however, he would be compelled to double his ordinary exertion to draw a full load, and it would therefore be the maximum grade.\" Mr. Isaac B. Potter, an eminent authority upon roads, says:  \"Dirty water and watery dirt make bad going, and mud is the greatest obstacle to the travel and traffic of the farmer. Mud is a mixture of dirt and water. The dirt is always to be found in the roadway, and the water, which comes in rain, snow, and frost, softens it; horses and wagons and narrow wheel tires knead it and mix it, and it soon gets into so bad a condition that a fairly loaded wagon cannot be hauled through it.  \"We cannot prevent the coming of this water, and it only remains for us to get rid of it, which can be speedily done if we go about it in the right way. Very few people know how great an amount of water falls upon the country road, and it may surprise some of us to be told that on each mile of an ordinary country highway three rods wide within the United States there falls each year an average of twenty-seven thousand tons of water. In the ordinary country dirt road the water seems to stick and stay as if there was no other place for it, and this is only because we have never given it a fair opportunity to run out of the dirt and find its level in other places. We cannot make a hard road out of soft mud, and no amount of labor and machinery will make a good dirt road that will stay good unless some plan is adopted to get rid of the surplus water. Water is a heavy, limpid fluid, hard to confine and easy to let loose. It is always seeking for a chance to run down a hill; always trying to find its lowest level.\"  An essential feature of a good road is good drainage, and the principles of good drainage remain substantially the same whether the road be constructed of earth, gravel, shells, stones, or asphalt. The first demand of good drainage is to attend to the shape of road surface. This must be \"crowned,\" or rounded up toward the center, so that there may be a fall from the center to the sides, thus compelling the water to flow rapidly from the surface into the gutters which should be constructed on one or both sides, and from there in turn be discharged into larger and more open channels. Furthermore, it is necessary that no water be allowed to flow across a roadway; culverts, tile, stone, or box drains should be provided for that purpose.  In addition to being well covered and drained, the surface should be kept as smooth as possible; that is, free from ruts, wheel tracks, holes, or hollows. If any of these exist, instead of being thrown to the side the water is held back and is either evaporated by the sun or absorbed by the material of which the road is constructed. In the latter case the material loses its solidity, softens and yields to the impact of the horses' feet and the wheels of vehicles, and, like the water poured upon a grindstone, so the water poured on a road surface which is not properly drained assists the grinding action of the wheels in rutting or completely destroying the surface. When water is allowed to stand on a road the holes and ruts rapidly increase in number and size; wagon after wagon sinks deeper and deeper, until the road finally becomes utterly bad, and sometimes impassable, as frequently found in many parts of the country during the winter season.  Road drainage is just as essential to a good road as farm drainage is to a good farm. In fact, the two go hand in hand, and the better the one the better the other, and vice versa. There are thousands of miles of public roads in the United States which are practically impassable during some portion of the year on account of bad drainage, while for the same reason thousands of acres of the richest meadow and swamp lands lie idle from year in to year out.  The wearing surface of a road must be in effect a roof; that is, the section in the middle should be the highest part and the traveled roadway should be made as impervious to water as possible, so that it will flow freely and quickly into the gutters or ditches alongside. The best shape for the cross section of a road has been found to be either a flat ellipse or one made up of two plane surfaces sloping uniformly from the middle to the sides and joined in the center by a small, circular curve. Either of these sections may be used, provided it is not too flat in the middle for good drainage or too steep at the gutters for safety. The steepness of the slope from the center to the sides should depend upon the nature of the surface, being greater or less according to its roughness or smoothness. This slope ought to be greatest on earth roads, perhaps as much in some cases as one foot in twenty feet after the surface has been thoroughly rolled or compacted by traffic. This varies from about one in twenty to one in thirty on a macadam road, to one in forty or one in sixty on the various classes of pavements, and for asphalt sometimes as low as one in eighty.  Where the road is constructed on a grade or hill the slope from the center to the sides should be slightly steeper than that on the level road. The best cross section for roads on grades is the one made up from two plane surfaces sloping uniformly from the center to the sides. This is done so as to avoid the danger of overturning near the side ditches, which would necessarily be increased if the elliptical form were used. The slope from the center to the sides must be steep enough to lead the water into the side ditches instead of allowing it to run down the middle of the road. Every wheel track on an inclined roadway becomes a channel for carrying down the water, and unless the curvature is sufficient these tracks are quickly deepened into water courses which cut into and sometimes destroy the best improved road.  In order to prevent the washing out of earth roads on hills it sometimes becomes necessary to construct water breaks; that is, broad shallow ditches arranged so as to catch the surface water and carry it each way into the side ditches. Such ditches retard traffic to a certain extent, and often result in overturning vehicles; consequently they should never be used until all other means have failed to cause the water to flow into the side channels; neither should they be allowed to cross the entire width of the road diagonally, but should be constructed in the shape of the letter V. This arrangement permits teams following the middle of the road to cross the ditch squarely and thus avoid the danger of overturning. These ditches should not be deeper than is absolutely necessary to throw the water off the surface, and the part in the center should be the shallowest.  Unfortunately farmers and road masters have a fixed idea that one way to prevent hills, long and short, from washing is to heap upon them quantities of those original tumular obstructions known indifferently as \"thank-you-ma'ams,\" \"breaks,\" or \"hummocks,\" and the number they can squeeze in upon a single hill is positively astonishing. Quoting Mr. Isaac B. Potter:        \"Side ditches are necessary because the thousands of tons of       water which fall upon every mile of country road each year,       in the form of rain or snow, should be carried away to some       neighboring creek or other water channel as fast as the rain       falls and the snow melts, so as to prevent its forming mud       and destroying the surface of the road. When the ground is       frozen and a heavy rain or sudden thaw occurs, the side       ditch is the only means of getting rid of the surface water;       for no matter how sandy or porous the soil may be, when       filled with frost it is practically water-tight, and the       water which falls or forms on the surface must either remain       there or be carried away by surface ditches at the sides of       the road.        \"A side ditch should have a gradually falling and even grade       "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33710"],["title","Comments on the Taxonomy and Geographic Distribution of Some North American (#0)"],["body","on the Taxonomy and Geographic Distribution of Some North American Marsupials, Insectivores and Carnivores  BY  E.

RAYMOND HALL and KEITH R. KELSON   In preparing maps showing the geographic distribution of North American mammals we have found in the literature conflicting statements and questionable identifications, which have led us to examine the specimens concerned with results as set forth below. Our studies have been aided by a contract (NR 161-791) between the Office of Naval Research, Department of the Navy, and the University of Kansas. Grateful acknowledgment is made to the persons in charge of the several collections of mammals consulted for permission to examine and study the specimens therein.   ~Didelphis marsupialis californica~ Bennett  From Cuernavaca, Morelos, Hooper (Jour. Mamm., 28:43, February 1, 1947) lists a specimen, as he says, on purely geographic grounds, as of the subspecies _Didelphis mesamericana tabascensis_. We have examined this specimen, an unsexed skull-only, which falls within the range of individual variation of _Didelphis marsupialis californica_ and refer the specimen to that subspecies.   ~Didelphis marsupialis etensis~ J. A. Allen  From El Muñeco, Costa Rica, Harris (Occas. Papers, Mus. Zool. Univ. Michigan, no. 476:7, October 8, 1943) lists as _Didelphis richmondi_ a specimen ([Male], No. 67550 U.M.). Our examination of the specimen shows it to be within the range of individual variation of populations that have been referred to _D. m. etensis_ from adjoining areas. We identify the specimen as _Didelphis marsupialis etensis_.   ~Didelphis marsupialis tabascensis~ J. A. Allen  From Minatitlán, Veracruz, J. A. Allen (Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 14:168, June 15) listed a specimen under the name _Didelphis marsupialis_ [in the trinomial sense] instead of under the name _Didelphis marsupialis tabascensis_, which would be expected, on geographic grounds, to apply. The specimen is No. 78123, U.S. Nat. Mus., Biol. Surv. Coll. Our examination of the specimen reveals that it is within the range of individual variation of _Didelphis marsupialis tabascensis_ and we identify the specimen as of that subspecies. From Yaruca, Honduras, Bangs (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., 39:157, July, 1903) doubtfully listed as _Didelphis yucatanensis_ a specimen, No. 10611, M.C.Z. Our examination of the specimen indicates that it is within the range of variation expectable in _Didelphis marsupialis tabascensis_, known from surrounding areas, and we identify the specimen as _Didelphis marsupialis tabascensis_.   ~Didelphis marsupialis virginiana~ Kerr  J. A. Allen (Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 14:166, May 28, 1901) and A. H. Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 45:20, October 28, 1921) have identified four skulls from Sylacuga, Alabama, as _Didelphis virginiana pigra_. The two subspecies _virginiana_ and _pigra_ are not known to differ cranially. We have, however, examined the skulls which are Nos. 44057-44060 in the U.S. Nat. Mus., Biol. Surv. Coll. Because they are from a place north of other localities (Auburn and Greensboro, Alabama) from which the subspecies _virginiana_ has been recorded, and within the geographic range of _virginiana_, we identify the specimens as _Didelphis marsupialis virginiana_.  Sycamore Creek (synonymous with Fort Worth), Texas, is a place from which J. A. Allen (_op. cit._:173) recorded a specimen as _Didelphis marsupialis texensis_. This specimen (No. 24359/31765 U. S. Nat. Mus., Biol. Surv. Coll.) is in the black color-phase. There are only a few white hairs on the hind feet, and the basal fourth of the tail is black. The black phase occurs all through the range of the species _D. marsupialis_ and our examination of the specimen reveals no characters by which it can be distinguished from _D. m. virginiana_ of the surrounding region and we accordingly identify the specimen as _Didelphis marsupialis virginiana_.   ~Didelphis marsupialis pigra~ Bangs  Davis (Jour. Mamm., 25:375, December 12, 1944) was one writer who presented evidence that _Didelphis virginiana_ (through its subspecies _virginiana_ or _pigra_ or both) was only subspecifically distinct from the species _Didelphis mesembrinus_ (= _D. marsupialis_) through the subspecies _texensis_. Davis, however, did not actually employ a name combination that would enforce his conclusion and he remarked that he had not seen specimens which showed actual intergradation in the color of the toes. As the remarks below will show, Davis (_loc. cit._) was correct in his supposition that J. A. Allen had seen such specimens.  Deming Station, Matagordo, and Velasco, Texas, are three places from which J. A. Allen (Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 14:162, May 28, 1901) listed specimens as _Didelphis virginiana_. The specimens concerned are in the Biological Surveys Collection of the U.S. Nat. Museum and bear catalogue numbers as follows: Deming Station, 32430/44266, 32432/44268, 32433/44269; Matagordo, 32431/44267; Velasco, 32812/44833. In each specimen the tail is shorter than the head and body. The specimen from Velasco is semi-black, has the basal tenth of the tail black and there is no white on the ears or tail. The specimen from Matagordo is grayish, has the basal fifth of the tail black, ears black, the right hind foot black, but there is some white on the toes of the left hind foot and on each of the forefeet. Of the three specimens from Deming Station, all are in the gray color-phase. The first has the tail black only as far from the base as there is hair and there is considerable whitish on the hind toes. The second specimen has the basal fifth of the tail black and a slight amount of whitish on the hind toes. The third specimen has the basal third of the tail black and the toes are all black. In the sum total of their characters the specimens mentioned above are referable to _Didelphis marsupialis pigra_. These five specimens, and indeed the three from Deming Station alone, show intergradation in coloration of the feet between _Didelphis marsupialis texensis_ and _Didelphis virginiana pigra_. Probably there is three-way intergradation here at Deming Station in that _D. v. virginiana_ immediately to the north is involved. The specimens mentioned above, along with the information recorded by Davis (_loc. cit._) and other authors (for example, J. A. Allen, _loc. cit._, and Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 16:249-279, August 18, 1902), give basis for arranging the North American _Didelphis_ as follows:      _Didelphis marsupialis virginiana_ Kerr.          1792. _Didelphis virginiana_ Kerr, Animal Kingdom, p. 193, type         locality Virginia.      _Didelphis marsupialis pigra_ Bangs.          1898. _Didelphis virginiana pigra_ Bangs, Proc.
