Utilitarians may, perhaps, inquire the _uses_ of butterflies--what they do, make, or can be sold for; and I must confess that my little favourites neither make anything to wear, like the silkworm, nor anything to eat, like the honey-bee, nor are their bodies saleable by the ton, like the cochineal insects, and that, commercially speaking, they are just worth nothing at all, excepting the few paltry pence or shillings that the dealer gets for their little dried bodies occasionally; so they are of no more use than poetry, painting, and music--than flowers, rainbows, and all such {34} unbusinesslike things. In fact, I have nothing to say in the butterfly's favour, except that it is a joy to the deep-minded and to the simple-hearted, to the sage, and, still better, to the child--that it gives an earnest of a better world, not vaguely and generally, as does every \"thing of beauty,\" but with clearest aim and purpose, through one of the most strikingly perfect and beautiful analogies that we can find throughout that vast Creation, where--   \"All animals are living hieroglyphs.\"[5]  The butterfly, then, in its own progressive stages of caterpillar, chrysalis, and perfect insect, is an emblem of the human soul's progress through earthly life and death, to heavenly life.  Even the ancient Greeks, with their imperfect lights, recognised this truth, when they gave the same name, Psyche ([Greek: Psuchê]), to the soul, or spirit of life, and to the butterfly, and sculptured over the effigy of one dead the figure of a butterfly, floating away, as it were, in his breath; while poets of all nations have since followed up the simile.  And this analogy is not only a mere general resemblance, but holds good through its minute details to a marvellous extent; to trace which fully would require volumes, while in this place the slightest sketch only can be given.  First, there is the grovelling caterpillar-state, {35} emblematical of our present imperfection, but yet the state of preparation and increase towards perfection, and that, too, which largely influences the future existence.  Many troubles and changes are the lot of the caterpillar. Repeated skin-shiftings and ceaseless industry in his vocation are necessary, that within his set time he may attain full growth and vigour.  Then comes a mighty change: the caterpillar is to exchange his worm-like form and nature for an existence unspeakably higher and better. But, as we have seen, to arrive at this glory there is only one condition, which is, that the creature must pass through another, and, as it might seem, a gloomy state--one anything but cheerful to contemplate; for it must cease to eat, to move, and--_to the eye_--_to live_. Yet, is it really dead now, or do we, who have watched the creature thus far, despair and call it lost? Do we not rather rejoice that it rests from its labours, and that the period of its glorification is at hand?  In the silent chrysalis state then our _Psyche_ sleeps away awhile, unaffected by the vicissitudes around it; and, at last, when its appointed day arrives, bursts from its cerements, and rises in the air a winged and joyous being, to meet the sun which warmed it into new life. Now it is a _butterfly_,--bright emblem of pleasure unalloyed.  This happy consummation, however, is only for the chrysalis which has not within it the devouring worm, the fruit of the ichneumon's egg, harboured during the {36} caterpillar state--and emblem, in the human soul, of some deadly sin yielded to during life, and which afterwards becomes the gnawing \"worm that dieth not.\" For in this case, instead of the bright butterfly, there issues forth from the chrysalis-shell only a swarm of black, ill-favoured flies, like a troop of evil spirits coming from their feast on a fallen soul.  If a caterpillar were gifted with a foreknowledge of his butterfly future, so far transcending his inglorious present, we could imagine that he would be only impatient to get through his caterpillar duties, and rejoice to enter the chrysalis state as soon as he was fitted for it. How short-sighted then would a caterpillar appear who should endeavour, while in that shape, to emulate the splendour of the butterfly by some wretched temporary substitute, adding a few more, or brighter stripes than nature had given it; or, again, if one whose great change was drawing near, should attempt to conceal its visible approach by painting over the fading hues of health, and plastering up the wrinkles of its outward covering, so soon to be thrown off altogether; instead of striving for inward strength and beauty, which would never decline, but be infinitely expanded in the butterfly--and regarding the earthly beauty's wane as the dawn of the celestial.  [Illustration: VI.]  {37} With these and similar reflections before us (which might be multiplied _ad infinitum_), we shall no longer look upon the caterpillar as a mere unsightly and troublesome reptile, the chrysalis as an unintelligible curiosity, and the butterfly as a pretty painted thing and nothing more; but regard them as _together_ forming one of those beautiful and striking illustrations with which the book of Nature has been so profusely enriched by its GREAT AUTHOR; not to be taken as _substitutes_ for His revealed Word, but as harmonious adjuncts, bringing its great truths more home to our understandings, just as the engravings in a book are not designed as substitutes for the text, but to elucidate and strengthen the ideas in the reader's mind.  While the poet draws from the butterfly many a pleasant similitude, and the moralist many a solemn teaching, the artist (who should be poet and moralist too) dwells upon these beings with fondest delight, finding in them images of joy and life when seen at large in the landscape, and rich stores of colour-lessons when studied at home in the cabinet.  The owners of many a name great in the arts have been enthusiastic collectors of butterflies. Our distinguished countryman, Thomas Stothard, was one of their devotees, and the following anecdote, extracted from his published life, shows how he was led to make them his special study:--  \"He was beginning to paint the figure of a reclining sylph, when a difficulty arose in his own mind how best to represent such a being of fancy. A friend who was present said, 'Give the sylph a butterfly's wing, and then you have it.' 'That I will,' exclaimed Stothard; 'and to be correct I will paint the wing {38} from the butterfly itself.' He sallied forth, extended his walk to the fields, some miles distant, and caught one of those beautiful insects; it was of the species called the Peacock. Our artist brought it carefully home, and commenced sketching it, but not in the painting room; and leaving it on the table, a servant swept the pretty little creature away, before its portrait was finished. On learning his loss, away went Stothard once more to the fields to seek another butterfly. But at this time one of the tortoise-shell tribe crossed his path, and was secured. He was astonished at the combination of colour that presented itself to him in this small but exquisite work of the Creator, and from that moment determined to enter on a new and difficult field--the study of the insect department of Natural History. He became a hunter of butterflies. The more he caught, the greater beauty did he trace in their infinite variety, and he would often say that no one knew what he owed to these insects--they had taught him the finest combinations in that difficult branch of art--colouring.\"  The above doubtless has its parallel in the experience of many artistic minds, whose very nature it is to appreciate to the full the perfections set forth in a butterfly, admiring--   \"The velvet nap which on his wings doth lie,   The silken down with which his back is dight,   His broad outstretched horns, his airy thigh,   His glorious colours and his glistening eye.\"                                 SPENSER.         *       *       *       *       *   {39}  CHAPTER IV.      BUTTERFLIES IN THE CABINET--HOW TO CATCH THEM--APPARATUS--GOING     OUT--WEATHER--LOCALITIES--LOCAL BUTTERFLIES--INCOGNITOS--FIELD     WORK--FAVOURITE STATIONS--BEWARE OF THE BRAMBLE.  The mention of butterflies \"in the cabinet\" leads at once to the question, how to get them there; or, in other words, HOW TO CATCH A BUTTERFLY.  This is a question often less difficult to answer in words than in action, for many of our butterflies are gifted not only with strong prejudices against the inside of a net, but with very strong powers of escaping from that unpleasant situation. Still, by aid of proper apparatus, a sure eye and hand, and often, of a good pair of legs, there is no butterfly, however fleet and wary, that we may not feel ourselves a tolerable match for.  Firstly, then, as to the out-door apparatus required.  This is simple enough, a _net_ and _pocket-boxes_, with a few _pins_, being the only essentials.[6]  {40}  Variously constructed nets are used, according to fancy, but the choice may lie between two chief forms: the _Clap-net_ and the _Ring-net_.  [Illustration]  The former certainly gives more power in a fair chase, but the latter has the advantage of being the {41} lighter, more portable, and less conspicuous of the two. Both of these instruments are shown in the accompanying figures.  The clap-net (fig. 1) usually has the sticks that compose the framework made each in three separate pieces, joined by ferrules--a couple of light fishing-rods will do excellently, a piece of bent cane being substituted"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33852"],["title","British Butterflies: Figures and Descriptions of Every Native Species (#6)"],["body","the top joint. The manner in which the gauze is extended between, and fitted on, these rods will be sufficiently obvious on looking at the cut, which represents the net half open. In taking an insect, one handle is held in each hand, the net opened wide, and thrown over, or made to intercept the insect, when, by suddenly closing the handles together, a closed bag is made, and the little prisoner is secured.  [Illustration]  The ring-net (fig. 2), which is the implement most generally in vogue, may be constructed in several ways. The cheapest, and at the same time a highly serviceable one, is made by getting from a tinman a tin \"socket\" of this form, the larger end fitting on to the end of a straight stick, and the two smaller tubes receiving the ends of a hoop of cane, which carries the net, it being passed through a loose hem round the top of the latter. The cane, taken out of the socket, can be rolled up closely with the net and carried in the pocket to the scene of action, while the handle may be a strong common walking-stick, a {42} most useful auxiliary in getting across country, and thus this net becomes really no incumbrance to the tourist, who may have other matters in hand besides butterfly hunting--perhaps sketching and botanizing--when the larger clap-net becomes quite embarrassing.  Another form of this net has the ring made of _metal_, and _jointed_ in several places, so as to fold within a small pocketable compass, and arranged to screw into a brass socket on the top of the stick. This is a very commendable net--not so easily home-made as the last, certainly, but it can be readily procured complete from the London dealers (or \"naturalists,\" as they style themselves).  A net that has been a good deal used of late opens and shuts on the umbrella principle, and with the same celerity, forming a ring-net when open--when shut going into a case like that of an umbrella.  Some entomologists, nervously sensitive to public opinion, are, however, somewhat shy of sporting these umbrella nets, for should rain perchance come down while he is on the road, the villagers may be astonished at the insane spectacle of a man scuttling along through the torrent and getting drenched through, while he carries a good-looking umbrella carefully under his arm for fear it should get wet; and if, on the other hand, the weather be fine, the carrying such a protective would seem an equally eccentric whim. But only the _very_ thin-skinned would be driven from the use of a good weapon by such a harmless contingency as I have here supposed. {43}  Other necessary equipments for the fly-catcher are two or three _light wooden boxes_, as large as can conveniently be carried in the pockets, and having either the bottom, or, if deep enough, both bottom and top lined with a layer of _cork_, about one-eighth of an inch in thickness.  A pin-cushion, well furnished with _entomological pins_, should also be carried, and will be found to be most accessible when suspended by a loop and button (or otherwise) inside the breast of the coat.  The pins here mentioned, which are an important item among butterfly-collecting requisites, are of a peculiar manufacture--very small-headed, long and thin, but strong. Any good London dealer will supply them on application, or send them by post into the country.  Armed with the above simple _paraphernalia_, viz. net to catch, boxes and pins to contain and detain, the insect hunter may sally forth on any fine summer's day, with a pretty sure prospect of sport, and the chance, at least, of a prize. Much depends, however, on the choice of a day, and the nature of the locality that is to form the hunting ground.  As to weather, it must be remembered that winged insects have a great objection to face a north, or north-east wind, during the prevalence of which you will probably find hardly one stirring, however prolific the locality may at other times be.  Butterflies, as a rule, do not appear to be at all {44} influenced by an eye for the picturesque and romantic in the choice of their favourite haunts. Often have I been disappointed in this way, finding a delicious spot, basking in sunshine, and bedight with all manner of flowers such as a butterfly loves, yet with scarcely a stray butterfly to enliven it; while, on the other hand, a piece of the most unpromising flat waste land will be all alive with insect beauty. Those, for example, who would see those splendid creatures, the Swallow-tail butterfly and the large Copper (if this exists with us at all now), must go to the dreary fen districts that form their almost exclusive haunts.  It is, in fact, very hard to say what influences bring a swarm of butterflies together, to populate one particular spot, to the utter neglect of others close at hand, and, to all appearance, just as eligible.  Some species are most remarkable for their excessive _localness_ (as it is called), or, limiting their range to an exceedingly small circumscribed space; so much so, that some rare species have been known to haunt just one corner of one particular field, year after year, while not a single specimen could be found in all the neighbouring fields, though precisely similar, to all appearance. This phenomenon is quite inexplicable with regard to insects endowed so pre-eminently with locomotive powers as butterflies are.  The local nature of his game should, however, induce the collector to leave no nook or corner unexplored when he is \"working\" a district; as the passing over (or rather, neglecting to _pass over_) a single field may lose him the very species it would joy him most to find.  [Illustration: VII.]  {45}  I would also advise the beginner--and, indeed, all but the very experienced hands--to catch, not necessarily for slaughter, but for inspection, every attainable individual whose species he cannot positively declare to when on the wing, lest he pass by some rarities unawares. Thus the valued Queen of Spain, and the much-disputed _Dia_ Fritillaries, the _Melitæas_, the Brown Hair-streak, and (on the mountains) the rare _Erebias_, perhaps some new to this country,--any of these might be mistaken by a novice for some of the commoner brown species. Among the \"Whites,\" too, the Black-veined White, that great prize, the Bath White, and the white varieties of the Clouded Yellow and Clouded Sulphur, might share the same fate, or fortune rather, of being reckoned as \"Cabbage Whites.\"  Then, with the \"Blues.\" Who is there that could at once distinguish with certainty the very rare Mazarine Blue (_P. Acis_) from the common Blues when on the wing? Perhaps it would turn out to be less rare than supposed, if all the Blues in a fresh locality were netted as they came near, and set at liberty after passing muster.  Why, only last season a very curious Blue,[7] never before observed in this country, was captured near {46} Brighton by a collector, who, at the moment, thought it was only a Common Blue, so precisely similar did it look when flying.  As to the manipulation of the net, it will be better to leave the young collector to find that out for himself, which, if he has the use of his hands, he will quickly do when he gets into the field. He will soon perceive that with most of the swifter butterflies, it is of no use to make a rush at them. A surprise answers better than a charge; for they easily take alarm at open violence, and then go off straight ahead at a pace that renders pursuit, over bad ground especially, most trying, if not hopeless work. So the \"_suaviter in modo_\" principle is best here as elsewhere:--gently follow up and watch your butterfly till he pauses over or settles upon a flower, or whatever it may be; then, with caution, you can generally come within striking distance without giving alarm, and one vigorous, well-aimed stroke usually settles the matter; if, after that, he is outside of your net instead of in, you will find it a difficult matter to get another chance, at least, with most of the larger and strong-flying kinds. But there is much diversity of disposition among these creatures, and some are unscared by repeated attacks. These points of character the collector will soon learn when he has been among these lively little people for a season.  The different species have also their own favourite positions, on which they delight to perch.  Thus the Clouded Yellow loves the low flowers of {47} the railway-bank and the down; often seen toying with a breeze-rocked flower as yellow-coated as himself, as though he had mistaken it, in its fluttering, for one of his mates.  Then the Peacock and Red Admiral are attached to several plants of the composite order, such as the thistles, teazle, and above all (as far as I have observed), to that fine, stalwart plant that frequently abounds in thickets, &c., and known as Hemp Agrimony (_Eupatorium cannabinum_). I seldom, at the proper season, visit a clump of this growing in a sunny opening, without finding, besides a store of other insects, one or both of these grand butterflies enthroned on the ample purplish flower-heads, and _fanning_ their gorgeous wings, after the custom of their genus, then launching into the air, and, after a few circling evolutions in that element, returning to the self-same flower-heads, their chosen seats.  Both of these flies are easily captured when in this position, as they allow a near approach, and can be without hindrance swept off by a rapid side-stroke of the net.  The glorious Purple Emperor is celebrated for his predilection for a throne on the oak, though some other lofty trees, such as the ash, are occasionally honoured by the imperial presence; but his habits and _locale_ will be referred to more particularly hereafter.  That lovely butterfly, the Silver-washed Fritillary, has a _penchant_ for settling on the bramble, which {48} justifies the preference by proving itself the insect's best friend; but withal a most provoking opponent to his would-be captor, who may get him"]]]
