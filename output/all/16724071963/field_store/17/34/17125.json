Also the drawn whip-sword spoke eloquently of who this intruder was.  The Abarian of the Ofridian well in search of prey. The cowardly assassin who would now enter and find a defenseless man and a beautiful girl who would set him aflame with lust.  Rage threw a red curtain over Bram Forest's eyes as he struggled up to meet the intruder. But the latter never saw him because at that moment the now-familiar nausea seized Bram Forest's vitals, doubling him over.  And when the Abarian had advanced into the cavern, he found only an empty bed of moss, Bram Forest having been snatched up and whirled into darkness by the relentless hand of time put into terrifying motion.     CHAPTER IX  _In Custody_   Bram Forest regained consciousness upon a grassy slope across which slanted the rays of a setting sun. The same sun that had warmed him upon the planet Tarth--of this he was certain.  He arose and glanced about quickly, realizing--while he was sure he had returned to Earth--that he could be many miles from the mysterious mansion under which he had spent one hundred years.  [Illustration: Screaming, Ylia offered her own body in defense of her loved one.]  At first his heart sank because the terrain was not at all familiar. Then it rose again as he saw the tower of the gray mansion pushing somberly above the line of the forest top. He stood for a moment, orienting himself with the tower the center of his calculations. Then he moved out of the glade toward his right.  But he had gone scarcely ten feet into the wooded area when his sharpened instincts gave him quick warning and he dropped like a stone and lay still.  The sound of footsteps greatened until their echo came loud in his ears and a man passed not ten feet from his outstretched hands.  The man wore the blue uniform and smart cap of a state trooper and he was on the alert but not so much so as to detect the silent Bram Forest.  The latter, with the first moment he had had to give thought to himself since he had awakened in the cavern on the Plains of Ofrid, realized suddenly that he was no longer naked. He had of course been vaguely aware of this before but now he gave it his attention and realized what had happened. He focused on past events.         *       *       *       *       *  During his time of unconsciousness from the treacherous Abarian's blade thrust, the beautiful Ylia had garbed him in the brilliant uniform of the slain Nadian, Jlomec. This uniform was both colorful and practical but it did nothing to either hide or encumber the great muscles of his chest and arms, thighs.  The State Trooper passed on his way and Bram Forest wondered what he was doing about the old mansion. But this did not occupy his thoughts for long. As soon as the way was clear, he moved like a great cat through the underbrush toward the spot from whence he had made his exodus to the planet Tarth. As he skirted the last glade, he prayed that the second article in the box containing the fabulous disc he had now switched to his right wrist, still lay where he had carelessly dropped it.  He came to the edge of the open field and warily surveyed the terrain. No one was in sight. He strained his ears for the sound of any approaching footsteps and heard nothing. He sprang swiftly into the open and ran across the field.  It was there--the flat white package--exactly where he had dropped it that first morning. He swept it up, intent upon returning to the shelter of the forest.  But his interest in what lay beneath the white paper wrapping had grown to such a point of intensity that his footsteps lagged, his attention riveted upon the tantalizing thing, and he came to a full stop mid-field while his strong fingers tore at the wrappings.  The white parchment came away and Bram Forest stared at what was revealed. Then a strange and terrifying change came over him. His handsome features contorted as every drop of blood was drained from his face. His great frame shook as with an illness and such a demoniacal rage came over him as few people in this or any other world have seen.  Now a great and terrifying cry arose from his throat; a cry that make even the beasts of this forest freeze in their tracks and crouch lower in their places of concealment. A cry of such rage and agony that even the trees of the forest seemed to pause and listen in mute wonder....         *       *       *       *       *  Mulcahey Davis, State Trooper, picked brambles from the legs of his blue uniform and cursed his assignment in no uncertain terms.  Why in the name of law and decency had he and Mowbray been ordered to patrol this tangled, deserted spook-hole? Sure--the body of some old hobo had been found in a well with rocks thrown on it but what were he and Mowbray going to prove by tramping around through these brambles?  Mulcahey Davis heard footsteps and looked up to see Mowbray laboring across the last few yards of his beat. Mowbray broke from the last clutching strands of thorn bush and began beating burrs from his legs. \"Find anything?\" he asked.  \"Not a blasted thing. It's downright crazy, our clambering around this woods. What will we find? A couple of rabbits?\"  \"That body in the well has to be investigated,\" Mowbray said, seriously. \"Pretty odd deal.\"  \"What progress have they made?\"  \"They've located the outfit that held this place in trust, but the guy in charge had a stroke or something. He can't be questioned. They may never be able to question him. An old guy named Pride. He's in pretty bad shape.\"  \"Chances are he wouldn't know anything about it even if they could ask him. What would he have been doing out here?\"  \"There's that funny fire in the basement, too. Nothing routine about that. Fire so hot it melted rock. A lot of unanswered questions here.\"  \"If they'd ask me, I'd tell them--\"  Mulcahey Davis' throat froze as a terrible cry smote his ears. Mowbray paled suddenly and the two men looked at each other in instinctive fear.  But they were tried and tested law-enforcement officers and were not held in the grip of terror for long. \"Did you hear that?\" Mulcahey Davis said.  \"Good lord, man! How could I help it!\"  \"Where'd it come from?\"  \"Over there.\"  \"Let's go.\"  The two troopers plunged again into the undergrowth to emerge at the edge of an open field. And regardless of their personal courage and experience in their line of effort, what they saw froze them anew.  A giant of a man--a creature of godlike proportions stood in the open field, washed by the rays of the setting sun. His great arms were held aloft and he was looking up into the sky with a terrifying expression that was a mixture of pain and rage.  He was speaking and his great voice echoed in what was remindful of a thunderous prayer. \"I know not the purpose for which I was created but well do I now know my dedicated task. Vengeance! Vengeance such as this world or any other has never seen!\"  With this the giant--clad in a strange colorful uniform of some sort--dropped to his knees and lowered his great head into his hands.  Mowbray's face was grim and alert. \"Come on,\" he whispered. \"We're behind him so we get a break. Move in quietly. And let's get him before he sees us. I've got a hunch he could lick ten of us and we don't want to use our guns.\"  They crossed the field softly and moved in behind the kneeling man. They acted in concert with an expertness telling of lengthy experience.  Mowbray was thankful for the way it turned out. He knew not why the giant put up no resistance. The man seemed stunned as from a great blow and before he could recover, the troopers had him bound hand and foot with their belts.  Mulcahey Davis got to his feet and wiped the sweat from his face. \"There's one for the psychos and a padded cell afterwards.\"  \"You said it,\" Mowbray agreed heartily. \"Let's take him in.\"     CHAPTER X  _The Road to Nadia_   The stads of Abaria, like the masters who rode them, were ill-accustomed to the clear cold air of Nadia. They snorted visible jets of vapor into the crisp air as their splayed feet scratched and slipped, seeking purchase on the ice-covered, up-tilted rocky plain.  \"It's an accursed country, lord,\" Hultax told the king of the Abarians as their steeds advanced shoulder and shoulder.  Retoc sat tall and straight on the stad's broad back, his black cloak with the royal emblem billowing in the stiff wind, his hard handsome face ruddy with the cold air, his cruel eyes mere slits against the Nadian wind. \"Quiet, you fool,\" he admonished Hultax. \"Everything we Abarians say and do in Nadia must be sweetness and light--now.\"  The vanguard of the long column of Abarian riders had reached a rushing mountain stream, its waters too swift to freeze in the sub-zero temperature. Lifting one hand overhead, Retoc called a halt.  \"They'll find out, lord,\" Hultax persisted. \"They'll find out what you did. I know they will. They'll find out it was you who killed Jlomec, their ruler's brother.\"  Retoc smiled. The smile made Hultax' blood run cold, for he had seen such a smile before--when Retoc witnessed the execution of disloyal Abarian subjects. The smile hardened on Retoc's face, as if it had frozen there in the cold Nadian wind. \"Dismount your steed,\" he said in a soft voice which only Hultax heard.  Trembling, Hultax obeyed his master's command. His stad, suddenly riderless, pawed nervously at the frost-hardened ground on the edge of the stream. Retoc withdrew his whip-sword and fondled the jewel-encrusted haft. \"If you ever say that again, here in Nadia or elsewhere, I will kill you,\" he warned his lieutenant.  \"But the brown girl--\"  \"The brown girl be damned!\" roared Retoc in sudden fury.  \"We haven't been able to find her. That day at the cave, she came rushing out, lord, while you--\"  \"I was detained,\" Retoc said, some of the passion gone from his voice. He would never forget the sight of the iron-thewed young man, who once had almost strangled him, growing suddenly,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32953"],["title","Quest of the Golden Ape (#8)"],["body","transparent, then disappearing. He had stood there, whip-sword in hand, mouth agape, while the brown girl ran past him and--according to what Hultax had told him later--mounted his own stad and vanished across the Ofridian plain.  \"But lord, don't you see?\" Hultax demanded. \"The brown girl knows what happened to Jlomec, prince of the royal Nadian blood. If she attends the royal funeral. She will--\"  Retoc laughed. Hultax blanched. He had heard such laughter when enemies of Retoc and thus of Abaria had died in pain. \"Fool, fool!\" he heard Retoc say now. \"Think you a bedraggled wayfaring maid of the Ofridian desert will be invited to the funeral of a prince of the Nadian royal blood?\"  \"Nevertheless, sire,\" Hultax persisted, \"that day at the cave I took the liberty to send three of our best stadsmen after the girl with orders to capture her or kill her on sight.\"  Slowly, as a thaw spreads in spring over the broad Nadian ice fields, Retoc smiled at his second in command. Hultax too let his face relax into a grateful grin: until now he had been teetering on the brink of violent death, and he knew it.  \"You may mount,\" Retoc said.         *       *       *       *       *  Hastily Hultax climbed astride his stad. Retoc lifted his arm overhead and made a circular motion with his outstretched hand. The first of the Abarian stads advanced with some reluctance into the swift cold shallow water of the stream.  \"What about the white giant?\" Hultax asked unwisely when the entire party had reached the other side and Retoc was urging his stad up the slippery bank.  \"Have your scouts been able to find the wayfarers who saw him?\"  \"No, sire. Only the girl nursed him back to health. The others fled.\"  \"And wisely. They have learned to hold their tongues, as you should learn, Hultax. They will give us no trouble. As far as they are concerned, there is no white giant.\"  \"But there is talk of what happened at the Tower, and of Portox' wizardry, and a god who would return, full-grown in exactly a hundred years--\"  \"Shut up!\" Retoc cried, almost screaming the words.  But that night at the Abarian encampment a day and a half's march from Nadia city, Retoc dreamed of Queen Evalla, the lovely Ofridian ruler whose slow death by torture he had relished as the final act of his utter destruction of the once proud Ofridian nation. Evalla in the dream seemed happy and confident. Retoc awoke sweating although frigid winds howled over the Nadian ice-fields. Her confidence sent unknown fear through him.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Really, it's quite simple,\" the superbly-muscled prisoner said in the language which was not his own but which he could speak as well as a native. \"You see, it wasn't simple at all until I saw what was in the package, but it's quite simple now. In the package was a picture of my mother, the dead Queen Evalla. I am her son. I am of the royal blood. When I saw the picture, it suddenly triggered my memory-responses, as Portox had arranged. Then--\"  \"What about the old guy in the well?\" the trooper asked unimaginatively.  \"I'm sorry. I can't answer your questions now. I have to return to my home. The handful of wayfarers who alone are left of a once great nation are waiting for vengeance. I will....\"  His voice trailed on, earnestly, politely. The trooper looked at the man from the state mental hospital, who shook his head slowly. They left the powerful, polite prisoner in his cell and went through the corridor to the prison office.  \"Real weirdy, huh, doc?\" the trooper said.  \"A--uh--weirdy to you, but rather cut and dry to me, I'm afraid,\" Dr. Slonamn said. \"Delusions of grandeur and delusions of persecution. Advanced paranoia, I'm afraid.\"  \"It's funny, doc. When they took everything away from him he might hurt himself with, he didn't mind at all. Only the bracelet. Three strong men had to hold him when they took the bracelet.\"  \"Bracelet?\" Dr. Slonamn said.  \"We got it in the office. I'll show you.\"  The bracelet turned out to be a small, mesh-metal strap as wide around as a big man's upper arm. Attached to the strap was a disc of silvery metal.  \"You'd think it was worth a million bucks,\" the trooper said.  Dr. Slonamn nodded sagely. \"Paranoid. It helps confirm the diagnosis. You see, out of touch with the real world, a paranoid can attach great value to utterly worthless objects. Well, I'll write out my report, sergeant.\"  \"Captain Caruthers said to thank you, sir.\"  \"Not at all. Part of my job.\"  Meanwhile, back in his cell, the prisoner, big hands gripping the bars so tight that his knuckles were white, was thinking: _I've got to make them understand. Somehow I've got to make them understand before it's too late._  He closed his eyes, lost in intense thought. When he did so, an image swam before his mind's eye. He did not know how this could be, but ascribed it to more of the dead Portox' magic.  What he saw was the barren ice fields of Nadia, with several great caravans making their slow way across the bleak blazing whiteness toward Nadia City. As was the custom in Nadia, the prisoner--whose name was Bram Forest--knew, great funeral games would be held to honor the memory of the late beloved Prince Jlomec. And it was here in frigid Nadia, at such a time as this, when all the royal blood of all the royal households of Tarth gathered, the wizardry of Portox seemed to tell him, that vengeance would come. Here, if only....  _Ylia!_  The image blurred. He had seen her once. His knuckles went white as bleached bone on the bars. He concentrated every atom of his will. _Ylia, Ylia!_ But now with his eyes shut he saw nothing. With his eyes opened, only the bars of his cell and the cell-block corridor beyond. _Ylia, Ylia! Hear me. There is danger on the road to Nadia. Ylia...._     CHAPTER XI  _On the Ice Fields of Nadia_   B'ronth the Utalian left footprints in the snow.  Otherwise, B'ronth was invisible. But if a hidden observer watched the Utalian's slow progress across the ice fields of Nadia he would see where the ice was soft or where snow had fallen during the night into the gullies, the unexpected, mysterious appearance of footprints, a left staggered after a right, then another left, then a right again, then a left.  Actually, B'ronth the Utalian was not invisible. But like all Utalians, he was a chameleon of a man. Within seconds his skin would assume the color of its environment, utterly and completely. Thus, from above B'ronth the Utalian was the dazzling white of the Nadian ice-fields; from below, looking up at the pale cloudless sky, he was cold, transparent blue.  All morning he had been trailing the girl. He had reached her camp on the road to Nadia only moments after she had quit it in company with an old man. From the tattered snow cloaks they wore, they both clearly were wayfarers. B'ronth could have challenged them at once, sprinting across the ice toward them, but he hadn't done that. B'ronth the Utalian was a coward. He accepted the fact objectively: his people were notorious cowards. The proper time would come, he told himself. There would come a time when the girl and the old man were helpless. Then he, B'ronth, would strike.  The day before an Abarian warrior had given him a description of the girl and had promised him a bag of gold for her capture, half a bag of gold if he killed her and could prove it. A bag of gold, he thought. He would take her alive. It was a long, cold road to Nadia City. True, B'ronth the Utalian was small of stature, a puny creature like all his people. And there were certain disadvantages in his perfect camouflage. He was walking naked across the ice-fields in order to remain unseen. His flesh shivered and his bones were stiff. But a Nadian boy named Lulukee, whom B'ronth had promised half the gold, was not many minutes' march behind him with warm clothing, food, and drink. After he captured the girl....         *       *       *       *       *  Invisible, he mounted a rise where solid sheet ice adhered to the shoulder of a rocky hill. Below him, traversing a snow-floored valley and so far away that they were mere dots against the snow, were the old man and the girl.  B'ronth the Utalian chuckled. The sound was swept up instantly and dispersed by the wind. It was a cold wind and it all but froze B'ronth to the marrow, but the Nadian sun was surprisingly warm and now seemed to beam down on him with promise of his golden reward. Shivering both from cold and delight, the invisible Utalian walked swiftly down into the snow-mantled valley.  There would be a trail of footprints for the boy Lulukee to follow....         *       *       *       *       *  \"Cold, Hammeth?\" Ylia asked her companion.  \"No, girl. I'll manage if you will. Is it much further?\"  \"Half a day's march to Nadia City yet, I'm afraid,\" Ylia said. \"We could rest if you wish.\"  The man was extremely old by Tarthian standards, probably three hundred and fifty years old. He wore a snow-cape of _purullian_ fur which the wind whipped about his bony frame and up over his completely bald head. \"I'm sorry, Ylia,\" he said suddenly. There were tears in his eyes which the cold and the wind did not explain.  \"What for? You came to the cave. You accompanied me here to Nadia.\"  \"When Retoc the Abarian almost killed the White God, I fled with the others.\"  \"If you didn't flee you too might have been slain, Hammeth.\"  \"Yet you remained behind.\"  \"He still lived. Someone had to tend him.\"  Hammeth's breath came in shallow gasps. He once had been a strong, big man, but the life and the strength had fled his frame when Retoc destroyed Ofrid, a hundred years before. As a wayfarer on the Plains of Ofrid, he had aged in those hundred years. And he had shrunk and shriveled with approaching senility. \"Tell me, Ylia,\" he asked, panting, \"is this Bram Forest you speak of indeed the--the god of the legend? The God of the Tower come to right the ancient wrongs?\"  A frown marred the beauty of Ylia's matchless"]]]
