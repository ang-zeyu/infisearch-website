We have examined these specimens and find them to be readily separable from _T. s. rufescens_ on the basis of darker coloration. The affinities of the specimens in question are with _T. s. fisheri_ and _T. s. ohionensis_. As a standard for comparison we have used specimens in the Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan, in comparable pelage of _T. s. ohionensis_ from Dearborn County, Indiana, taken in August and specimens of _T. s. fisheri_ from \"near\" summit Butt Mtn. and Little Meadows, both places in Giles County, Virginia, as well as two specimens from Allair, Monmouth County, New Jersey. On the basis of buffy (instead of white) edging of the tail, buffy (not white) light dorsal stripes, and buffy (not black) anterior third of the median dark stripe, the specimens from Overton, Wooster, and Loudonville are referred to _Tamias striatus ohionensis_.   ~Tamias striatus pipilans~ Lowery  A. H. Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 29:16, November 30, 1929) recorded six specimens of _Tamias striatus striatus_ from Greensboro, Alabama. Subsequently, Lowery (Occas. Papers Mus. Zool., Louisiana State Univ., 13:235, November 22, 1943) named _T. s. pipilans_ and assigned to it specimens from northeastern Alabama. Lowery did not, however, mention the specimens from Greensboro and, thus, their subspecific identity was placed in doubt. We have examined five of the six specimens mentioned by Howell (_loc. cit._) (57034-57036, 57588, and 77037 BS) and because of their brilliant color and large size, refer them to _Tamias striatus pipilans_ Lowery.   ~Tamias striatus rufescens~ Bole and Moulthrop  A. H. Howell (Jour. Mamm., 13:166, August 9, 1932) also referred a specimen (13154), from La Porte, Indiana, in the Chicago Nat. History Museum to _T. s. fisheri_. We find the specimen to be distinguishable from _T. s. fisheri_ in darker, richer pelage, brown instead of blackish anterior third of the median dorsal stripe, more buffy light dorsal stripes, and more heavily constructed skull. The specimen most closely resembles _T. s. rufescens_ in having, as compared to _T. s. ohionensis_, brighter, more rufescent color, wider incisors, proportionately narrower interorbital region, and more widely spreading zygomatic arches. We refer it to that subspecies.   ~Sciurus carolinensis pennsylvanicus~ Ord  When J. A. Allen considered what name to apply to the gray squirrel of northeastern United States and adjacent parts of Canada, (Monogr. N. Amer. Rodentia, p. 709, 1877) he selected the name _leucotis_ of Gapper (Zool. Jour., 5:206, 1830) as applicable. Allen rejected Ord's (Guthrie's Geog., 2nd Amer. Ed., Zool. App., 2:292, 1815) earlier name, _Sciurus Pennsylvanica_, because (_loc. cit._) \"it was given to specimens from the Middle Atlantic States, and hence from a locality bordering upon the habitat of the southern form, and consequently the name is not strictly applicable to the northern type as developed in the Northern and Northeastern States and the Canadas.\" It must be recalled that Allen had not at that time seen a copy of Ord's exceedingly rare work and was basing his comments on Baird's statements on Ord's treatment of the squirrels.  Subsequently, Rhoads obtained a copy of the second edition of Guthrie's Geography and had Ord's zoological appendix thereto reprinted. The reprinted version (now known generally as Ord's Zoology by Rhoads, 1894) contains (Appendix, p. 19) Rhoads' review of the _pennsylvanicus vs. leucotis_ controversy. Rhoads concluded that _pennsylvanicus_ must apply because it has priority and is available. The habitat was given by Ord as \"those parts of Pennsylvania which lie to the westward of the Allegany ridge,\" not the \"Middle Atlantic States\" as Allen thought.  Notwithstanding Rhoads' comments, Bangs (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 10:156, December 28, 1896), in his \"Review of the Squirrels of Eastern North America,\" employed _leucotis_ Gapper and rejected Ord's name because it \"is a _nomen nudum_\" and of uncertain application. There seems to have been no attempt subsequently to review the pertinent names.  We are of the opinion that Rhoads' (_loc. cit._) analysis and conclusions are correct and as cogent today as then. We do not agree with Bangs that _pennsylvanicus_ is a _nomen nudum_ for the following reasons. The name was based on melanistic individuals and could conceivably be applied to three species of squirrels, the red squirrel, the fox squirrel, and the gray squirrel. Melanistic red squirrels, _Tamiasciurus hudsonicus_, are everywhere rare and in any case appear as individuals and not populations. Ord (_loc. cit._) reported that his _Sciurus Pennsylvanica_ was _abundant_. Ord, we think, was not referring to the fox squirrel, _Sciurus niger_, because he wrote that _S. Pennsylvania_ \"has always been confounded with... [_Sciurus niger_], but it is a different species,\" and (_loc. cit._) described _S. niger_ as a \"Large Black Squirrel\" and _Sciurus Pennsylvanica_ as a \"Small Black Squirrel.\" Therefore, _pennsylvanicus_ Ord can refer only to _Sciurus carolinensis_. Further, melanistic gray squirrels then, as now, were common in western Pennsylvania and exceedingly rare in eastern Pennsylvania. Additionally, Ord described his animal, although admittedly inadequately (small, black, not _S. niger_). The name _Sciurus Pennsylvanica_ Ord is clearly not a _nomen nudum_ and must replace _leucotis_ Gapper.  Allen's (_loc. cit._) argument that the specimens were not representative of \"_leucotis_\" because they were from the Middle Atlantic States is based on an initial misunderstanding of the locality. Further, whether or not \"topotypes\" are representative of a subspecies has no bearing on the availability of the name appended to them. The name and synonomy of the northern gray squirrel are as follows:       ~Sciurus carolinensis pennsylvanicus~ Ord       1815. _Sciurus Pennsylvanica_ Ord, Guthrie's Geog., 2nd      Amer.

Rodentia, Sciuridae, p. 700 (_et auct._).   ~Sciurus niger rufiventer~ Geoffroy  Two specimens (36192/48550, a young male with unworn teeth, and 36193/48551, an adult male with much worn teeth, both in the United States Biological Surveys Collection in the National Museum) were recorded by Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 25:75, 1905) as _Sciurus ludovicianus_ from Gainesville, Texas. Bailey (_loc. cit._) further stated that if the name _Sciurus rufiventer_ Geoffroy proved usable it would apply to the specimens from Gainesville. Since the name _rufiventer_ was revived there would be no question concerning the identity of these specimens had not Lowery and Davis (Occas. Papers, Mus. Zool., Louisiana State Univ., 9:172, 1942) assigned three specimens (not seen by us) to _Sciurus niger limitis_ Baird from a point only thirteen miles northwesterly. Lowery and Davis (_loc. cit._) say that their specimens are intergrades (presumably with _rufiventer_) and Bailey (_loc. cit._) noted that his two specimens from Gainesville \"are in size and color nearer to _ludovicianus_ [= _rufiventer_] than to typical _limitis_.\" Examination of the two specimens from Gainesville convinces us that Bailey was correct and the specimens therefore are referable to _Sciurus niger rufiventer_. More in detail, the color agrees with that of _rufiventer_ and differs from that of _limitis_ and from that of darker specimens of _Sciurus niger ludovicianus_ (in the restricted sense used by Lowery and Davis, _op. cit._: 104). Also the size is larger than in _limitis_ and as in _rufiventer_ or _ludovicianus_. Selected measurements of Nos. 36192/48550 and 36193/48551 are, respectively, as follows: Total length, 505, 500; length of tail, 237, 228; length of hind foot, 72, 70; basilar length of Hensel, 48.5, 48.6; zygomatic breadth, 35.1, 36.0; length of nasals, 21.4, 22.3; alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 11.8, 11.1; width across posterior tongues of premaxillae, 17.5, 18.4.   ~Sciurus variegatoides rigidus~ Peters  Harris (Occas. Papers Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan, 266:1, June 28, 1933) named _Sciurus variegatoides austini_ with type locality at Las Agujas, Province of Puntarenas, Costa Rica. Later, in his revision of the species _Sciurus variegatoides_, he (Misc. Publs. Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan, 38:19, September 7, 1937) referred specimens from Chomes, Costa Rica, to _S. v. austini_ and (_op. cit._:24) specimens from Puntarenas, Province of Puntarenas, to _S. v. rigidus_, an inland subspecies. The geographic arrangement of these referred specimens seemed to warrant a reconsideration of the material. We have examined specimens of _S. variegatoides_ in the Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan, from the following localities in Costa Rica: Puntarenas (62703-62706), Las Agujas (65118 [type of _S. v. austini_], 59847-59850), Río Las Agujas (65114-65117), Agua Caliente (66483), Zarcéro (75757-75761, 75765), Cartago (67546, 67547), and Esparta (75762-75764). The specimens listed by Harris (_op. cit._, 1937:19) as from Chomes, in the Museum of Zoology of the University of Michigan, are not now in that museum and we have not seen them.  Harris (_op. cit._:19) characterized _S. v. austini_ as differing from _S. v. rigidus_ in having brightly rufous legs (Ochraceou"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33578"],["title","Comments on the Taxonomy and Geographic Distribution of Some North American (#3)"],["body","s-Orange) in _S. v. rigidus_ and a dorsal coloration resulting from a mixture of shiny black and silver (Ochraceous-Orange mixed with black in _S. v. rigidus_). We find that in the color of the legs of the paratypes of _S. v. austini_ there is considerable variation ranging from bright rufous in No. 65116 to much darker and duller in No. 59849. In six of the ten specimens of the type series, the color is rufous, but in the other four the color of the legs approaches and overlaps that found in the referred specimens of _S. v. rigidus_. The color of the dorsum of _S. v. austini_ is also variable. No. 59850, for example, is dark brown and closely resembles No. 75762, from Esparta, which was referred to _S. v. rigidus_. Further, some specimens referred to _S. v. rigidus_ (67546 and 67547) have the bright-colored legs of _S. v. austini_ and some (75759, for example) have the black-and-silver back of _austini_. We recognize differences of an average sort between the now-available specimens of the two alleged subspecies, but because of the individual variation that exists, we feel that recognition of two subspecies is not indicated. There is also some variation that is the result of wear and molt and one of us (Kelson) feels that some of the differences are explainable on this basis. Accordingly, we prefer to adopt a more conservative taxonomic arrangement than that of Harris for this group of the Costa Rican squirrels and arrange _Sciurus variegatoides austini_ Harris, 1933, as a synonym of _Sciurus variegatoides rigidus_ Peters, 1863.   ~Thomomys bottae alienus~ Goldman  Six specimens (21249-21253, 212706 BS) from Rice, Arizona, were referred by Goldman (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 46:76, April 27, 1933) to the subspecies _Thomomys bottae mutabilis_ Goldman when he proposed that name as new, but these six specimens were not mentioned by him when he later named _Thomomys bottae alienus_ (Jour. Washington Acad. Sci., 28:338, July 15, 1938), to which subspecies the specimens in question might be expected to belong. Examination of the six specimens reveals that they are intergrades between _T. b. mutabilis_ and _T. b. alienus_ but that the specimens more closely resemble the latter. More precisely, slightly larger size of skull, greater ventral inflation of tympanic bullae, and less depressed occipital region ally the specimens with _Thomomys bottae alienus_, and we identify them as that subspecies. The two subspecies concerned are not so distinct as are most subspecies of _Thomomys bottae_.   ~Thomomys bottae aphrastus~ Elliott  Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 39:58, November 15, 1915) referred three specimens from San Antonio, Baja California, to _Thomomys bottae nigricans_. These specimens have not, to our knowledge, been re-examined subsequently, although the current taxonomic treatment of the pocket gophers of Baja California by Huey (Trans. San Diego Soc. Nat. Hist., 10(4):245-268, 1 map, August 31, 1945) excludes _T. b. nigricans_ from the area of San Antonio. The pertinent specimens are probably Nos. 10810-10812 in the Chicago Natural History Museum. We have examined the specimens and, using the comparative materials listed under the account of _T. b. siccovallis_, find them to be intermediate in most characters between _T. b. aphrastus_ and _T. b. martirensis_. Because they more nearly resemble _T. b. aphrastus_ in the weakly-spreading zygomatic arches, we refer the specimens from San Antonio to that subspecies.   ~Thomomys bottae jojobae~ Huey  When Huey (Trans. San Diego Soc. Nat. Hist., 10:256, August 31, 1945) named _Thomomys bottae jojobae_ from Sangre de Cristo, Baja California, México, he made no mention of a specimen that Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 39:58, November 15, 1915) identified as _Thomomys bottae nigricans_ from La Huerta, which place is approximately eight miles northwest of Sangre de Cristo. From a geographic standpoint, it seemed unlikely that the specimen from La Huerta would be referable to _T. b. nigricans_. Examination of the specimen (138752 BS) proves it to differ from topotypes of _T. b. nigricans_ and to agree with _T. b. jojobae_ in richer, more rufescent color, especially ventrally, and smaller, slenderer, more delicate skull. The specimen is therefore tentatively referred to _Thomomys bottae jojobae_. We have not, however, compared it with specimens of _Thomomys bottae juarezensis_, a subspecies the range of which lies to the east on the summit of the Sierra Juárez.   ~Thomomys bottae martirensis~ J. A. Allen  Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 39:58, November 15, 1915) referred pocket gophers from Piñon on the west slope of the San Pedro Mártir Mountains, Baja California, to the subspecies _Thomomys bottae nigricans_. The subspecific identity of these animals has now been reinvestigated subsequently, although the locality whence they were obtained is far removed from what is now thought to be the geographic range of _T. b. nigricans_; further, several other subspecies are known to occur in the intervening area. We have examined the available material from Piñon (13853-13855 BS) and find the specimens to agree with _Thomomys bottae martirensis_ and to differ from _T. b. nigricans_ in lighter color, larger, more ridged and angular skull; proportionately greater mastoidal breadth; narrower occipital shelf; more ventrally produced alveolar ramus of the maxillae; and deeply concave posterior border of the temporal root of the zygomatic arch. These specimens thus constitute the northernmost record of _T. b. martirensis_ known to us.   ~Thomomys bottae mohavensis~ Grinnell  Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 39:73, November 15, 1915) assigned a series of 7 specimens from Lone Willow Spring, California, to the subspecies _Thomomys bottae perpes_. This locality lies at the northern edge of the Mohave Desert. Later, Grinnell (Univ. California Publ. Zool., 17:427, April 25, 1918) named the pocket gophers from approximately the eastern half of the Mohave Desert, _Thomomys perpallidus_ [= _bottae_] _mohavensis_, but failed to mention the specimens recorded by Bailey, and thus their subspecific identity is in doubt. We find that _T. b. mohavensis_ differs from _T. b. perpes_ in more pallid color (light yellowish as opposed to dark rufescent) larger size, larger and more angular skull, angular (as opposed to more evenly bowed) zygomatic arches, larger and deeper audital bullae, narrower interpterygoid space, and proportionately greater mastoidal breadth. In external measurements, size and angularity of skull, width of interpterygoid space and angularity of the zygomatic arch, the specimens from Lone Willow Spring seem to be intermediate between the two subspecies, but perhaps show more resemblance to _T. b. mohavensis_. Otherwise, the specimens closely resemble _T. b. mohavensis_ to which they are here referred. The specimens provide a northern marginal record of occurrence for that subspecies.  Other specimens recorded as _T. b. perpes_ by Bailey (_loc. cit._) from Grapevine Ranch, California, have also not been mentioned in later publications although, from a geographic standpoint, they might be better referred to either _Thomomys bottae pascalis_ or _T. b. mohavensis_. Comparison of specimens of _T. b. mohavensis_ and _T. b. pascalis_ from various localities show _T. b. pascalis_ to be larger (including the skull), darker, and to possess a more nearly vertical occipital plane, wider-spread but less angular zygomatic arches, less inflated tympanic bullae, wider braincase (which consequently appears to be less inflated), proportionately longer and slenderer rostrum, and broader nasals distally. Cranially, _T. b. pascalis_ differs from _T. b. perpes_ in essentially the same ways, but to an event greater degree. In color, _T. b. pascalis_ differs from _T. b. perpes_ in being duller, less rufescent.  The series of four specimens, in the U. S. Biological Surveys Collection, from Grapevine Ranch clearly are not referable to _T. b. perpes_. They do, however, agree with _T. b. mohavensis_ in all essential particulars except that in two of the four specimens the braincase is wider and the nasals are wider distally. This width is evidence of intergradation with _T. b. pascalis_. Seemingly, then, they are best referred to _Thomomys bottae mohavensis_.   ~Thomomys bottae muralis~ Goldman  When Goldman (Jour. Washington Acad. Sci., 26(3):112, March 15, 1936) described and named this pocket gopher from Arizona, he arranged it as a full species and stated that there is no evidence of intergradation with other named kinds. We have examined the holotype and three topotypes (202579-202582 BS) and compared them with specimens of other kinds of pocket gophers occurring in northern and central Arizona. The _muralis_ gopher is a depauperate form clearly belonging to the _bottae_ group. The characters which Goldman (_loc. cit._) set forth as distinguishing _muralis_ from other named kinds are readily apparent and, like Goldman, we see no evidence of intergradation. Nevertheless, the characters which serve to identify the race are, in a general way, those commonly found in populations of depauperate individuals of _Thomomys bottae_ and _T. talpoides_. The small size, delicate structure, well-inflated braincase, short premaxillary tongues, and strongly recurved upper incisors, often appear in populations existing in inhospitable areas of shallow, unstable soils. For this reason we feel that the relationships of this population are best shown by arranging _muralis_ as a subspecies of _Thomomys bottae_; the name should stand as _Thomomys bottae muralis_ Goldman.  As far as known, _T. b. muralis_ is completely isolated from other populations of pocket gophers by uninhabitable eroding cliffs. The animals have been found only on isolated terraces in the lower end of Prospect Valley (itself a lateral pocket) within the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, Hualpai Indian Reservation, Arizona. Consequently it is unlikely that intergradation with other"]]]
