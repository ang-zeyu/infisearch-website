Balin laughed.  It was evening again when Stark awoke. He sat up, stretching lazily. Thanis crouched by the hearthstone, stirring something savory in a blackened pot. She wore a red kirtle and a necklet of beaten gold, and her hair was combed out smooth and shining.  She smiled at him and rose, bringing him his own boots and trousers, carefully cleaned, and a tunic of leather tanned fine and soft as silk. Stark asked her where she got it.  \"Balin stole it--from the baths where the nobles go. He said you might as well have the best.\" She laughed. \"He had a devil of a time finding one big enough to fit you.\"  She watched with unashamed interest while he dressed. Stark said, \"Don't burn the soup.\"  She put her tongue out at him. \"Better be proud of that fine hide while you have it,\" she said. \"There's no sign of attack.\"  Stark was aware of sounds that had not been there before--the pacing of men on the Wall above the house, the calling of the watch. Kushat was armed and ready--and his time was running out. He hoped that Ciaran had not been delayed on the moors.  Thanis said, \"I should explain about the belt. When Balin undressed you, he saw Camar's name scratched on the inside of the boss. And, he can open a lizard's egg without harming the shell.\"  \"What about you?\" asked Stark.  She flexed her supple fingers. \"I do well enough.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Balin came in. He had been seeking news, but there was little to be had.  \"The soldiers are grumbling about a false alarm,\" he said. \"The people are excited, but more as though they were playing a game. Kushat has not fought a war for centuries.\" He sighed. \"The pity of it is, Stark, I believe your story. And I'm afraid.\"  Thanis handed him a steaming bowl. \"Here--employ your tongue with this. Afraid, indeed! Have you forgotten the Wall? No one has carried it since the city was built. Let them attack!\"  Stark was amused. \"For a child, you know much concerning war.\"  \"I knew enough to save your skin!\" she flared, and Balin smiled.  \"She has you there, Stark. And speaking of skins....\" He glanced up at the belt. \"Or better, speaking of talismans, which we were not. How did you come by it?\"  Stark told him. \"He had a sin on his soul, did Camar. And--he was my friend.\"  Balin looked at him with deep respect. \"You were a fool,\" he said. \"Look you. The thing is returned to Kushat. Your promise is kept. There is nothing for you here but danger, and were I you I would not wait to be flayed, or slain, or taken in a quarrel that is not yours.\"  \"Ah,\" said Stark softly, \"but it is mine. The Lord Ciaran made it so.\" He, too, glanced at the belt. \"What of the talisman?\"  \"Return it where it came from,\" Thanis said. \"My brother is a better thief than Camar. He can certainly do that.\"  \"No!\" said Balin, with surprising force. \"We will keep it, Stark and I. Whether it has power, I do not know. But if it has--I think Kushat will need it, and in strong hands.\"  Stark said somberly, \"It has power, the Talisman. Whether for good or evil, I don't know.\"  They looked at him, startled. But a touch of awe seemed to repress their curiosity.  He could not tell them. He was, somehow, reluctant to tell anyone of that dark vision of what lay beyond the Gates of Death, which the talisman of Ban Cruach had lent him.  Balin stood up. \"Well, for good or evil, at least the sacred relic of Ban Cruach has come home.\" He yawned. \"I am going to bed. Will you come, Thanis, or will you stay and quarrel with our guest?\"  \"I will stay,\" she said, \"and quarrel.\"  \"Ah, well.\" Balin sighed puckishly. \"Good night.\" He vanished into an inner room. Stark looked at Thanis. She had a warm mouth, and her eyes were beautiful, and full of light.  He smiled, holding out his hand.  The night wore on, and Stark lay drowsing. Thanis had opened the curtains. Wind and moonlight swept together into the room, and she stood leaning upon the sill, above the slumbering city. The smile that lingered in the corners of her mouth was sad and far-away, and very tender.  Stark stirred uneasily, making small sounds in his throat. His motions grew violent. Thanis crossed the room and touched him.  Instantly he was awake.  \"Animal,\" she said softly. \"You dream.\"  Stark shook his head. His eyes were still clouded, though not with sleep. \"Blood,\" he said, \"heavy in the wind.\"  \"I smell nothing but the dawn,\" she said, and laughed.  Stark rose. \"Get Balin. I'm going up on the Wall.\"  She did not know him now. \"What is it, Stark? What's wrong?\"  \"Get Balin.\" Suddenly it seemed that the room stifled him. He caught up his cloak and Camar's belt and flung open the door, standing on the narrow steps outside. The moonlight caught in his eyes, pale as frost-fire.  Thanis shivered. Balin joined her without being called. He, too, had slept but lightly. Together they followed Stark up the rough-cut stair that led to the top of the Wall.  He looked southward, where the plain ran down from the mountains and spread away below Kushat. Nothing moved out there. Nothing marred the empty whiteness. But Stark said,  \"They will attack at dawn.\"     V   They waited. Some distance away a guard leaned against the parapet, huddled in his cloak. He glanced at them incuriously. It was bitterly cold. The wind came whistling down through the Gates of Death, and below in the streets the watchfires shuddered and flared.  They waited, and still there was nothing.  Balin said impatiently, \"How can you know they're coming?\"  Stark shivered, a shallow rippling of the flesh that had nothing to do with cold, and every muscle of his body came alive. Phobos plunged downward. The moonlight dimmed and changed, and the plain was very empty, very still.  \"They will wait for darkness. They will have an hour or so, between moonset and dawn.\"  Thanis muttered, \"Dreams! Besides, I'm cold.\" She hesitated, and then crept in under Balin's cloak. Stark had gone away from her. She watched him sulkily where he leaned upon the stone. He might have been part of it, as dark and unstirring.  Deimos sank low toward the west.  Stark turned his head, drawn inevitably to look toward the cliffs above Kushat, soaring upward to blot out half the sky. Here, close under them, they seemed to tower outward in a curving mass, like the last wave of eternity rolling down, crested white with the ash of shattered worlds.  _I have stood beneath those cliffs before. I have felt them leaning down to crush me, and I have been afraid._  He was still afraid. The mind that had poured its memories into that crystal lens had been dead a million years, but neither time nor death had dulled the terror that beset Ban Cruach in his journey through that nightmare pass.  He looked into the black and narrow mouth of the Gates of Death, cleaving the scarp like a wound, and the primitive ape-thing within him cringed and moaned, oppressed with a sudden sense of fate.  He had come painfully across half a world, to crouch before the Gates of Death. Some evil magic had let him see forbidden things, had linked his mind in an unholy bond with the long-dead mind of one who had been half a god. These evil miracles had not been for nothing. He would not be allowed to go unscathed.  He drew himself up sharply then, and swore. He had left N'Chaka behind, a naked boy running in a place of rocks and sun on Mercury. He had become Eric John Stark, a man, and civilized. He thrust the senseless premonition from him, and turned his back upon the mountains.  Deimos touched the horizon. A last gleam of reddish light tinged the snow, and then was gone.  Thanis, who was half asleep, said with sudden irritation, \"I do not believe in your barbarians. I'm going home.\" She thrust Balin aside and went away, down the steps.  The plain was now in utter darkness, under the faint, far Northern stars.  Stark settled himself against the parapet. There was a sort of timeless patience about him. Balin envied it. He would have liked to go with Thanis. He was cold and doubtful, but he stayed.  Time passed, endless minutes of it, lengthening into what seemed hours.  Stark said, \"Can you hear them?\"  \"No.\"  \"They come.\" His hearing, far keener than Balin's, picked up the little sounds, the vast inchoate rustling of an army on the move in stealth and darkness. Light-armed men, hunters, used to stalking wild beasts in the show. They could move softly, very softly.  \"I hear nothing,\" Balin said, and again they waited.  The westering stars moved toward the horizon, and at length in the east a dim pallor crept across the sky.  The plain was still shrouded in night, but now Stark could make out the high towers of the King City of Kushat, ghostly and indistinct--the ancient, proud high towers of the rulers and their nobles, set above the crowded Quarters of merchants and artisans and thieves. He wondered who would be king in Kushat by the time this unrisen sun had set.  \"You were wrong,\" said Balin, peering. \"There is nothing on the plain.\"  Stark said, \"Wait.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Swiftly now, in the thin air of Mars, the dawn came with a rush and a leap, flooding the world with harsh light. It flashed in cruel brilliance from sword-blades, from spearheads, from helmets and burnished mail, from the war-harness of beasts, glistened on bare russet heads and coats of leather, set the banners of the clans to burning, crimson and gold and green, bright against the snow.  There was no sound, not a whisper, in all the land.  Somewhere a hunting horn sent forth one deep cry to split the morning. Then burst out the wild skirling of the mountain pipes and the broken thunder of drums, and a wordless scream of exultation that rang back from the Wall of Kushat like the very voice of battle. The men of Mekh began to move.  Raggedly, slowly at first, then more swiftly as the press of warriors"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32664"],["title","Black Amazon of Mars (#6)"],["body","and flowed, the barbarians swept toward the city as water sweeps over a broken dam.  Knots and clumps of men, tall men running like deer, leaping, shouting, swinging their great brands. Riders, spurring their mounts until they fled belly down. Spears, axes, sword-blades tossing, a sea of men and beasts, rushing, trampling, shaking the ground with the thunder of their going.  And ahead of them all came a solitary figure in black mail, riding a raking beast trapped all in black, and bearing a sable axe.  Kushat came to life. There was a swarming and a yelling in the streets, and soldiers began to pour up onto the Wall. A thin company, Stark thought, and shook his head. Mobs of citizens choked the alleys, and every rooftop was full. A troop of nobles went by, brave in their bright mail, to take up their post in the square by the great gate.  Balin said nothing, and Stark did not disturb his thoughts. From the look of him, they were dark indeed.  Soldiers came and ordered them off the Wall. They went back to their own roof, where they were joined by Thanis. She was in a high state of excitement, but unafraid.  \"Let them attack!\" she said. \"Let them break their spears against the Wall. They will crawl away again.\"  Stark began to grow restless. Up in their high emplacements, the big ballistas creaked and thrummed. The muted song of the bows became a wailing hum. Men fell, and were kicked off the ledges by their fellows. The blood-howl of the clans rang unceasing on the frosty air, and Stark heard the rap of scaling ladders against stone.  Thanis said abruptly, \"What is that--that sound like thunder?\"  \"Rams,\" he answered. \"They are battering the gate.\"  She listened, and Stark saw in her face the beginning of fear.  It was a long fight. Stark watched it hungrily from the roof all that morning. The soldiers of Kushat did bravely and well, but they were as folded sheep against the tall killers of the mountains. By noon the officers were beating the Quarters for men to replace the slain.  Stark and Balin went up again, onto the Wall.  The clans had suffered. Their dead lay in windrows under the Wall, amid the broken ladders. But Stark knew his barbarians. They had sat restless and chafing in the valley for many days, and now the battle-madness was on them and they were not going to be stopped.  Wave after wave of them rolled up, and was cast back, and came on again relentlessly. The intermittent thunder boomed still from the gates, where sweating giants swung the rams under cover of their own bowmen. And everywhere, up and down through the forefront of the fighting, rode the man in black armor, and wild cheering followed him.  Balin said heavily, \"It is the end of Kushat.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A ladder banged against the stones a few feet away. Men swarmed up the rungs, fierce-eyed clansmen with laughter in their mouths. Stark was first at the head.  They had given him a spear. He spitted two men through with it and lost it, and a third man came leaping over the parapet. Stark received him into his arms.  Balin watched. He saw the warrior go crashing back, sweeping his fellows off the ladder. He saw Stark's face. He heard the sounds and smelled the blood and sweat of war, and he was sick to the marrow of his bones, and his hatred of the barbarians was a terrible thing.  Stark caught up a dead man's blade, and within ten minutes his arm was as red as a butcher's. And ever he watched the winged helm that went back and forth below, a standard to the clans.  By mid-afternoon the barbarians had gained the Wall in three places. They spread inward along the ledges, pouring up in a resistless tide, and the defenders broke. The rout became a panic.  \"It's all over now,\" Stark said. \"Find Thanis, and hide her.\"  Balin let fall his sword. \"Give me the talisman,\" he whispered, and Stark saw that he was weeping. \"Give it me, and I will go beyond the Gates of Death and rouse Ban Cruach from his sleep. And if he has forgotten Kushat, I will take his power into my own hands. I will fling wide the Gates of Death and loose destruction on the men of Mekh--or if the legends are all lies, then I will die.\"  He was like a man crazed. \"Give me the talisman!\"  Stark slapped him, carefully and without heat, across the face. \"Get your sister, Balin. Hide her, unless you would be uncle to a red-haired brat.\"  He went then, like a man who has been stunned. Screaming women with their children clogged the ways that led inward from the Wall, and there was bloody work afoot on the rooftops and in the narrow alleys.  The gate was holding, still.         *       *       *       *       *  Stark forced his way toward the square. The booths of the hucksters were overthrown, the wine-jars broken and the red wine spilled. Beasts squealed and stamped, tired of their chafing harness, driven wild by the shouting and the smell of blood. The dead were heaped high where they had fallen from above.  They were all soldiers here, clinging grimly to their last foothold. The deep song of the rams shook the very stones. The iron-sheathed timbers of the gate gave back an answering scream, and toward the end all other sounds grew hushed. The nobles came down slowly from the Wall and mounted, and sat waiting.  There were fewer of them now. Their bright armor was dented and stained, and their faces had a pallor on them.  One last hammer-stroke of the rams.  With a bitter shriek the weakened bolts tore out, and the great gate was broken through.  The nobles of Kushat made their first, and final charge.  As soldiers they went up against the riders of Mekh, and as soldiers they held them until they died. Those that were left were borne back into the square, caught as in the crest of an avalanche. And first through the gates came the winged battle-mask of the Lord Ciaran, and the sable axe that drank men's lives where it hewed.  There was a beast with no rider to claim it, tugging at its headrope. Stark swung onto the saddle pad and cut it free. Where the press was thickest, a welter of struggling brutes and men fighting knee to knee, there was the man in black armor, riding like a god, magnificent, born to war. Stark's eyes shone with a strange, cold light. He struck his heels hard into the scaly flanks. The beast plunged forward.  In and over and through, making the long sword sing. The beast was strong, and frightened beyond fear. It bit and trampled, and Stark cut a path for them, and presently he shouted above the din,  \"Ho, there! _Ciaran!_\"  The black mask turned toward him, and the remembered voice spoke from behind the barred slot, joyously.  \"The wanderer. The wild man!\"  Their two mounts shocked together. The axe came down in a whistling curve, and a red sword-blade flashed to meet it. Swift, swift, a ringing clash of steel, and the blade was shattered and the axe fallen to the ground.  Stark pressed in.  Ciaran reached for his sword, but his hand was numbed by the force of that blow and he was slow, a split second. The hilt of Stark's weapon, still clutched in his own numbed grip, fetched him a stunning blow on the helm, so that the metal rang like a flawed bell.  The Lord Ciaran reeled back, only for a moment, but long enough. Stark grasped the war-mask and ripped it off, and got his hands around the naked throat.  He did not break that neck, as he had planned. And the Clansmen who had started in to save their leader stopped and did not move.  Stark knew now why the Lord Ciaran had never shown his face.  The throat he held was white and strong, and his hands around it were buried in a mane of red-gold hair that fell down over the shirt of mail. A red mouth passionate with fury, wonderful curving bone under sculptured flesh, eyes fierce and proud and tameless as the eyes of a young eagle, fire-blue, defying him, hating him....  \"By the gods,\" said Stark, very softly. \"By the eternal gods!\"     VI  A woman! And in that moment of amazement, she was quicker than he.  There was nothing to warn him, no least flicker of expression. Her two fists came up together between his outstretched arms and caught him under the jaw with a force that nearly snapped his neck. He went over backward, clean out of the saddle, and lay sprawled on the bloody stones, half stunned, the wind knocked out of him.  The woman wheeled her mount. Bending low, she took up the axe from where it had fallen, and faced her warriors, who were as dazed as Stark.  \"I have led you well,\" she said. \"I have taken you Kushat. Will any man dispute me?\"  They knew the axe, if they did not know her. They looked from side to side uneasily, completely at a loss, and Stark, still gasping on the ground, thought that he had never seen anything as proud and beautiful as she was then in her black mail, with her bright hair blowing and her glance like blue lightning.  The nobles of Kushat chose that moment to charge. This strange unmasking of the Mekhish lord had given them time to rally, and now they thought that the Gods had wrought a miracle to help them. They found hope, where they had lost everything but courage.  \"A wench!\" they cried. \"A strumpet of the camps. _A woman!_\"  They howled it like an epithet, and tore into the barbarians.  She who had been the Lord Ciaran drove the spurs in deep, so that the beast leaped forward screaming. She went, and did not look to see if any had followed, in among the men of Kushat. And the great axe rose and fell, and rose again.  She killed three, and left two others bleeding on the stones, and not once did she look back.  The clansmen found their tongues.  \"_Ciaran! Ciaran!_\"  The crashing shout drowned out the sound of battle. As one man, they turned and followed her.  Stark, scrambling for his life underfoot, could not forbear smiling. Their childlike minds could see only two alternatives--to slay her out of hand, or to worship her. They had chosen to worship. He thought the bards would be singing of the Lord Ciaran of Mekh as long as there were"]]]
