She opened the door under his impatient knock, and her eyes widened cordially.  \"Sylvester!\" she exclaimed. \"Merry Christmas! Is that for me?\" She pointed to the package, clutched forgotten in his hands.  \"Merry, hell!\" he said dispiritedly. \"I came to warn you to look out for a relapse. Mine's been coming on all day.\"  She drew him inside, made him take off his coat and sit down before she acknowledged his remark. The apartment was cozy, with a tiny Christmas tree decorated in the window. She returned from the hall closet and sat beside him.  \"Look what I did--on impulse,\" he said and tossed the package on her lap. \"That's what really turned it on.\"  She opened the nylons and looked up at him sideways.  He continued unhappily, \"I saw them in a window. Made me think of you, and about that time the seizure began. I tried to kid myself that I was just getting you a little token of--of my esteem, but the symptoms are almost as bad as before already.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Apparently she refused to accept the seriousness of the situation. Her smile was fatuous, he thought, kissably fatuous.  \"Don't you realize what this means?\" he demanded. \"Peterson and Feldman turned up a very distressing fact. Sulfa-tetradine deposits out in the endocrines, so a single dose is all a person can take. This relapse of mine means we have it all to do over again.\"  \"Think, Dr. Murt! Just think a minute,\" she urged.  \"About what?\"  \"If the sulfa deposits out in the very glands it's there to protect, how could you be suffering another attack?\"  His arms ached to reach out and emphasize his argument. \"I don't know. All I know is how I feel. In a way, this is even worse, because--\"  \"I know,\" Phyllis said and perversely moved close to him. \"My relapse came last Tuesday when I bought you a tie for Christmas. I sent a blood sample over to Ebert Labs right away. And do you know what?\"  \"What?\" Murt asked in a bewildered fog.  \"It was negative. I don't have Murt's Virus.\" She slipped an arm around his waist and put her head on his shoulder. \"All I've got is Murt himself.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32759"],["title","Red Nails (#0)"],["body","Nails                            By ROBERT E. HOWARD    _One of the strangest stories ever written--the tale of a barbarian  adventurer, a woman pirate, and a weird roofed city inhabited by the                 most peculiar race of men ever spawned_       Nearly four years ago, WEIRD TALES published a story called \"The     Phoenix on the Sword,\" built around a barbarian adventurer named     Conan, who had become king of a country by sheer force of valor and     brute strength. The author of that story was Robert E. Howard, who     was already a favorite with the readers of this magazine for his     stories of Solomon Kane, the dour English Puritan and redresser of     wrongs. The stories about Conan were speedily acclaimed by our     readers, and the barbarian's weird adventures became immensely     popular. The story presented herewith is one of the most powerful     and eery weird tales yet written about Conan. We commend this story     to you, for we know you will enjoy it through and through.     _1. The Skull on the Crag_   The woman on the horse reined in her weary steed. It stood with its legs wide-braced, its head drooping, as if it found even the weight of the gold-tasseled, red-leather bridle too heavy. The woman drew a booted foot out of the silver stirrup and swung down from the gilt-worked saddle. She made the reins fast to the fork of a sapling, and turned about, hands on her hips, to survey her surroundings.  They were not inviting. Giant trees hemmed in the small pool where her horse had just drunk. Clumps of undergrowth limited the vision that quested under the somber twilight of the lofty arches formed by intertwining branches. The woman shivered with a twitch of her magnificent shoulders, and then cursed.  She was tall, full-bosomed and large-limbed, with compact shoulders. Her whole figure reflected an unusual strength, without detracting from the femininity of her appearance. She was all woman, in spite of her bearing and her garments. The latter were incongruous, in view of her present environs. Instead of a skirt she wore short, wide-legged silk breeches, which ceased a hand's breadth short of her knees, and were upheld by a wide silken sash worn as a girdle. Flaring-topped boots of soft leather came almost to her knees, and a low-necked, wide-collared, wide-sleeved silk shirt completed her costume. On one shapely hip she wore a straight double-edged sword, and on the other a long dirk. Her unruly golden hair, cut square at her shoulders, was confined by a band of crimson satin.  Against the background of somber, primitive forest she posed with an unconscious picturesqueness, bizarre and out of place. She should have been posed against a background of sea-clouds, painted masts and wheeling gulls. There was the color of the sea in her wide eyes. And that was as it should have been, because this was Valeria of the Red Brotherhood, whose deeds are celebrated in song and ballad wherever seafarers gather.  [Illustration: \"Convinced that his death was upon him, the Cimmerian acted according to his instinct.\"]  She strove to pierce the sullen green roof of the arched branches and see the sky which presumably lay about it, but presently gave it up with a muttered oath.  Leaving her horse tied she strode off toward the east, glancing back toward the pool from time to time in order to fix her route in her mind. The silence of the forest depressed her. No birds sang in the lofty boughs, nor did any rustling in the bushes indicate the presence of any small animals. For leagues she had traveled in a realm of brooding stillness, broken only by the sounds of her own flight.  She had slaked her thirst at the pool, but she felt the gnawings of hunger and began looking about for some of the fruit on which she had sustained herself since exhausting the food she had brought in her saddle-bags.  Ahead of her, presently, she saw an outcropping of dark, flint-like rock that sloped upward into what looked like a rugged crag rising among the trees. Its summit was lost to view amidst a cloud of encircling leaves. Perhaps its peak rose above the tree-tops, and from it she could see what lay beyond--if, indeed, anything lay beyond but more of this apparently illimitable forest through which she had ridden for so many days.  A narrow ridge formed a natural ramp that led up the steep face of the crag. After she had ascended some fifty feet she came to the belt of leaves that surrounded the rock. The trunks of the trees did not crowd close to the crag, but the ends of their lower branches extended about it, veiling it with their foliage. She groped on in leafy obscurity, not able to see either above or below her; but presently she glimpsed blue sky, and a moment later came out in the clear, hot sunlight and saw the forest roof stretching away under her feet.  She was standing on a broad shelf which was about even with the tree-tops, and from it rose a spire-like jut that was the ultimate peak of the crag she had climbed. But something else caught her attention at the moment. Her foot had struck something in the litter of blown dead leaves which carpeted the shelf. She kicked them aside and looked down on the skeleton of a man. She ran an experienced eye over the bleached frame, but saw no broken bones nor any sign of violence. The man must have died a natural death; though why he should have climbed a tall crag to die she could not imagine.         *       *       *       *       *  She scrambled up to the summit of the spire and looked toward the horizons. The forest roof--which looked like a floor from her vantage-point--was just as impenetrable as from below. She could not even see the pool by which she had left her horse. She glanced northward, in the direction from which she had come. She saw only the rolling green ocean stretching away and away, with only a vague blue line in the distance to hint of the hill-range she had crossed days before, to plunge into this leafy waste.  West and east the view was the same; though the blue hill-line was lacking in those directions. But when she turned her eyes southward she stiffened and caught her breath. A mile away in that direction the forest thinned out and ceased abruptly, giving way to a cactus-dotted plain. And in the midst of that plain rose the walls and towers of a city. Valeria swore in amazement. This passed belief. She would not have been surprised to sight human habitations of another sort--the beehive-shaped huts of the black people, or the cliff-dwellings of the mysterious brown race which legends declared inhabited some country of this unexplored region. But it was a startling experience to come upon a walled city here so many long weeks' march from the nearest outposts of any sort of civilization.  Her hands tiring from clinging to the spire-like pinnacle, she let herself down on the shelf, frowning in indecision. She had come far--from the camp of the mercenaries by the border town of Sukhmet amidst the level grasslands, where desperate adventurers of many races guard the Stygian frontier against the raids that come up like a red wave from Darfar. Her flight had been blind, into a country of which she was wholly ignorant. And now she wavered between an urge to ride directly to that city in the plain, and the instinct of caution which prompted her to skirt it widely and continue her solitary flight.  Her thoughts were scattered by the rustling of the leaves below her. She wheeled cat-like, snatched at her sword; and then she froze motionless, staring wide-eyed at the man before her.  He was almost a giant in stature, muscles rippling smoothly under his skin which the sun had burned brown. His garb was similar to hers, except that he wore a broad leather belt instead of a girdle. Broadsword and poniard hung from this belt.  \"Conan, the Cimmerian!\" ejaculated the woman. \"What are _you_ doing on my trail?\"  He grinned hardly, and his fierce blue eyes burned with a light any woman could understand as they ran over her magnificent figure, lingering on the swell of her splendid breasts beneath the light shirt, and the clear white flesh displayed between breeches and boot-tops.  \"Don't you know?\" he laughed. \"Haven't I made my admiration for you plain ever since I first saw you?\"  \"A stallion could have made it no plainer,\" she answered disdainfully. \"But I never expected to encounter you so far from the ale-barrels and meat-pots of Sukhmet. Did you really follow me from Zarallo's camp, or were you whipped forth for a rogue?\"  He laughed at her insolence and flexed his mighty biceps.  \"You know Zarallo didn't have enough knaves to whip me out of camp,\" he grinned. \"Of course I followed you. Lucky thing for you, too, wench! When you knifed that Stygian officer, you forfeited Zarallo's favor and protection, and you outlawed yourself with the Stygians.\"  \"I know it,\" she replied sullenly. \"But what else could I do? You know what my provocation was.\"  \"Sure,\" he agreed. \"If I'd been there, I'd have knifed him myself. But if a woman must live in the war-camps of men, she can expect such things.\"  Valeria stamped her booted foot and swore.  \"Why won't men let me live a man's life?\"  \"That's obvious!\" Again his eager eyes devoured her. \"But you were wise to run away. The Stygians would have had you skinned. That officer's brother followed you; faster than you thought, I don't doubt. He wasn't far behind you when I caught up with him. His horse was better than yours. He'd have caught you and cut your throat within a few more miles.\"  \"Well?\" she demanded.  \"Well what?\" He seemed puzzled.  \"What of the Stygian?\"  \"Why, what do you suppose?\" he returned impatiently. \"I killed him, of course, and left his carcass for the vultures. That delayed me, though, and I almost lost your trail when you crossed the rocky spurs of the hills. Otherwise I'd have caught up with you long ago.\"  \"And now you think you'll drag me back to Zarallo's camp?\" she sneered.  \"Don't talk like "]]]
