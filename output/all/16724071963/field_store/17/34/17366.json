The Secretary seemed puzzled, but good-naturedly opened his wallet, and produced several of the same description. These he handed to the Inspector, who took them and bowed profoundly. A moment was spent in intense examination.  \"You must pardon me if I ask you if you use these cards when calling upon the President?\" proceeded the Washington officer. The Inspector's eyes seemed to be still riveted upon the cards in his hands.  \"Why, yes--no--that is, once in a while, if I happen to desire an audience at an unusual hour,\" answered the Secretary, exhibiting the first signs of embarrassment.  \"Will you please tell us when you called there last?\" asked Inspector Byrnes, furtively glancing up and speaking in a chatty, assuring tone.  The Secretary's face expressed relief.  \"Certainly,\" he answered; \"that is easy enough. I attended an informal reception in the Blue Room from three to four yesterday and saw the President alone a minute afterward. That is the last time I saw him.\" One might almost have fancied at the last sentence that tears arose to the eyes of the cabinet officer; at least there were tears in his voice.  \"Just as a matter of formality, Mr. Secretary, will you tell us where you were between twelve and two o'clock this morning?\" asked the Inspector, with the unconscious look of a man who was asking for a glass of water.  \"What does this mean, sir? Do you suspect me in this infernal mystery?\" ejaculated the Secretary. His face was pale from excitement; his eyes flashed in manly protest.  \"Not at all, not at all, sir. Calm yourself. This is only a matter of curious coincidence and a disagreeable formality,\" answered the Inspector, waving his hand as if he were brushing away a fly.  The Secretary stood a moment in thought, and then turned and touched a button. Immediately a servant appeared to whom the Secretary whispered a few words. The man in livery bowed and went.  \"Now, gentlemen,\" said the Secretary, standing with much dignity before his callers, \"wait a moment, and so far as I am concerned this mystery shall be cleared. I happened to be in this room last night from twelve until half-past two with some gentlemen, whom I am sure you will recognize. Ah! here they are.\"  A tap at the door and a \"Come in\" revealed to the astonished detectives the Secretaries of War and of the Interior, who entered the room.  \"Now, Inspector,\" continued the Secretary of State in his grandest manner, \"will you kindly ask your question again?\"  It then transpired that the three Secretaries had conducted an informal meeting to confer about the distressing question of war with Canada which was at that time agitating the country, and that their interview had been prolonged into the small hours of the morning. The chief of the Washington police could not refrain from profuse apologies after this denouement. Inspector Byrnes thought profoundly, and then, after a pause, burst out with unparalleled frankness:  \"Gentlemen, this is the most startling mystery in the annals of American crime. I must confess that up to this moment I am absolutely foiled.\" He then recounted, under seal of secrecy, the whole story as we have seen it. Ending his exciting narrative, he said:  \"And, Mr. Secretary, do you know of any one in Washington or in the country that resembles you enough to deceive two men, taking into account a natural drowsiness that each admitted?\"  The three gentlemen of the Cabinet thought hard but were soon bound to answer in the negative. For the Secretary of State was no ordinary-looking man. Conspicuous on any occasion, though not what might be strictly called handsome, he always commanded attention by his distinguished air. His luxuriant side whiskers, which were really magnificent were the most noticeable feature of his face. He had the happy consciousness that there were none like them in the United States.  \"There is only one more question you can answer, Mr. Secretary,\" said Inspector Byrnes, with a deferential look. \"The watchman on the first floor said he recognized your team. Will you please find out whether your coupé was in or not between twelve and two? Coachmen have queer tricks at times.\"  The coachman was immediately sent for. Meanwhile the Secretary stated that he had come in at twelve from a late call on a personal friend.  \"May I ask your friend's name?\" interrupted the national sleuth-hound, swiftly and politely.  \"The Patagonian Ambassador,\" replied the Secretary with hauteur. He added that he had sent his carriage instructing John, the family coachman, to be on hand at eleven that morning. The carriage was evidently not there, and in the excitement of the news the Secretary had foregone his morning's Department business.  After half an hour of waiting, during which the two police officers had sent out several messages, the coachman was ushered in among the impatient quintet. Instead of the prim and stately master of the horse, who was the despair of even his co-peer the Jehu of the English Ambassador, and the admiration of the Washington gamin, there skulked in a battered, bandaged, hastily-dressed man, who shuffled out incoherent excuses, and burst into moist apologies.  \"It wasn't my fault. The divil was in it. The hosses are safe. The kerridge is well. I woke up in the gutter, the blood sputterin' down me backbone. They were picked up this morning. Don't discharge me! I've served you fifteen years and only trained twicst. What'll become of me? Lord have mercy!\" The coachman of the Secretary had a stock of irreproachable syntax, which had been utterly scattered during the experience of the last night. At this spontaneous moment his native grammar got the best of him.  The coachman's testimony amounted to this: The driver was walking his horses to the stable in the fog when he saw a man beckon him from the sidewalk. Not a soul was on the street. Beyond was a dark, private lane. He stopped, and, to his surprise, saw, as he thought, his master standing and motioning him to come to a halt and get down. The Secretary's face was turned toward the dark. The voice sounded muffled. When the coachman alighted his master produced a silver flask and told him to take a drink as it was so damp. He dared not disobey, though full of wonder at this unprecedented favor. As soon as he had taken a pull he felt dizzy. Two or three more black figures appeared like ghosts before his eyes. He thought he struck out or tried to run to the coach, he didn't know which. A queer odor mounted to his head. Then he lost consciousness. He came to, early in the morning, a little after four, and staggered to the stable. The team was not there. He fell into a stupor of despair. About an hour after, an acquaintance of his drove the span up, and said they had been found unchecked, grazing near the Smithsonian Institute. He supposed that they had run away. The Secretary's coachman had then given the fellow five dollars for his services and to hold his tongue. He was afraid of being discharged. He had just heard of the disappearance of the President and he feared being implicated in the affair. After the name of the person who found the horses was taken down, and after a searching cross-examination, the frightened man was sent away to rest, with assurance of continued favor. Subsequent examinations failed to find any traces of the catastrophe in the coupé. It had been carefully cleaned when it came back to the stable. There was no blood visible.  This completes the whole of the testimony and information that was received or discovered by the united efforts of all the detectives in America up to the fourteenth of the month. Clews had been manufactured and followed with desperate rapidity, but to no avail. Numberless arrests had been made, but no one could be legally held for high treason against the Chief Executive. All that was known was this: that some bold villain had successfully personated the Secretary of State; that he had gulled three servants by a close resemblance; that he, with others, probably, had forcibly carried the President and his wife from their very beds, leaving them but scant time to take the necessary articles of clothing; that these abductors had audaciously used the State carriage for their nefarious purpose; that they had left absolutely no trace behind; and, that moreover, in the darkness of the fog and rain no further track could be found of the direction they took. They could not have gone by train; so every house in the city of Washington and in the suburbs, to the distance of fifteen miles or more, had been searched in vain. A like systematic investigation was carried on along the river, to the bay, in search of anything suspicious afloat. The authorities gave the robbers of the nation no time or opportunity to escape by land or water. All avenues were watched. Where were they and their noble booty? In short the foremost couple of the United States had utterly disappeared, to the horror and despair of the civilized world.  It was just one week from the morning of the shock when the New York _Herald_ published the following manifesto in its original form. It was sent as an advertisement with five dollars enclosed. The envelope was postmarked from division II of the New York Post-office. The document bore no superscription. It read as follows:       TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES:       _We have abducted your President and his wife, and hold them      for ransom. They will not be delivered up until their fine be      paid publicly, under full sanction of Congress. Moreover,      Congress and the people must guarantee, in addition to the full      payment, C. O. D., entire liberty to the abductors permanently      to withdraw from this country and live in future peace. Unless      Congress and the nation give their honor for the payment of the      ransom and our personal and impregnable liberty, we will not      deliver our prisoners. We impose"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33662"],["title","A Republic Without a President, and Other Stories (#2)"],["body"," ransom of a million dollars      apiece for each week, for such time as this offer may remain      unaccepted. The time begins from date of capture. These      conditions are final. When the country, through its      representatives, accedes to this demand, the time and place of      delivery will be published in these columns. The loyalty and      honor of the nation are now on exhibition before the world._  This communication burst like dynamite upon the people. Did it not bear an undeniable stamp of genuineness upon its face, not only through the firmness of its tone, but by the audacity of the demand? Yet there was an equal division of opinion. Some thought it was the raving of a crank in search of notoriety, but others looked upon it as a veritable communication from those who held the President and his wife in their possession.  Two millions of dollars a week! A princely ransom worthy of a royal couple and of the United States.  It was natural that the handwriting of this letter should be scrutinized severely. Every ingenuity that detective art could devise for finding the sender was employed. During the next few days New York underwent an espionage worthy of the court of St Petersburg. But, to the utter mortification of Inspector Byrnes and his myriads, of Pinkerton and his myrmidons, they were bound to confess their utter failure. The perpetrators of the incredible deed, like                               \"An arm     Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,\"  brandished the sword in the air and disappeared.  In the meantime the political nation was aroused. It experienced some measure of relief to know, if it were true, that its chief was held for paltry gold. In that case, he and his would be safe from the assassin's sword or the vengeance of an alien party whose hatred he had incurred by patriotic scorn in his inaugural address. An yet, the question was raised whether some treasonable secret society had not secluded him, hoping to increase its revenue at the expense of the United States treasury. Many went so far as to pronounce it a Fenian plot to raise money for Parnell in his final overthrow of English rule in Ireland. Constituents wrote to their representatives in Washington, instructing them to vote the ransom, without delay, from the surplus fund, which was now one hundred and seventy-eight million dollars. Others instructed them not to waste the public money, as the President and his spouse must soon be found by competent detectives, and thus a \"creditable saving to the treasury\" would be made. The Vice-President, who had succeeded to full powers, sent a special message to Congress, requesting it to vote the ransom, no matter how enormous. The strain on him was not worth the people's money. So Congress met in secret session, and spent the balance of the week fighting, temporizing, and receiving telegrams to the effect that new clews were found.  On the twenty-second of June, exactly two weeks from the time of the distinguished capture, the following epigrammatic communication was printed by the New York _Herald_, in the same handwriting as the previous one. The envelope bore a Chicago postmark:       \"_Congress has disregarded our generous offer: The ransom for      the President of the United States and for his wife is      therefore raised two million dollars._\"  This was all; cold and ominous. Like the first message it was unsigned. The style was unrelenting and imperious. Citizens awoke to the sensation that they who were now the nation's martyrs were in the hands of men who would not shrink from enforcing their demand. It was now universally believed that these were _bonâ fide_ bulletins sent by the unscrupulous abductors themselves. This became the detectives' final theory, and they massed their skill towards it.  The unsolved mystery brooded like dog-days over man, woman, and child. A nameless fear, that of an unknown and irresistible enemy in their midst, paralyzed the citizens. Prayers were offered in every church, school-house, and home. The hostilities that but lately threatened the country ceased. Civilization breathed nothing but sympathy for the bereaved republic. Sovereigns redoubled their private guards and quaked upon their thrones. And yet, in the face of fears, petitions, and threats, Congress, in a spirit of disastrous conservatism that has marked so many of its deliberations, allowed itself to be ruled by a dissenting minority. Detective Byrnes, hoping to gain imperishable credit and also the reward of five hundred thousand dollars which Congress had been liberal enough to offer, counselled delay in a private letter to the Speaker of the House. So it happened that this august body would not ratify the overwhelming vote for immediate payment of ransom which had just been passed by the Senate.  This filibustering brought the country into the third week of the calamity. The following communication to the New York _Herald_, postmarked Boston, written in the same hand as before, brought matters to a crisis:       \"_The nation has evidently more love for their surplus than for      their President. The requisite ransom has reached six millions      of dollars in gold. The treasury is not yet exhausted, nor are      we. None can find us. Our defences are unapproachable. We laugh      at your attempts. The wife of your President, we are grieved to      say, is ill._\"  This proclamation aroused a new element, which had been smouldering, to white heat. The women of the country rose _en masse_. They fired old societies and organized new to collect ransom. The W. C. T. U. and W. H. M. A. and A. S. A. and A. B. C. and X. Q. B. Z. thrilled to the occasion. Infant Bands of Hope and Daughters of Endeavor invaded private families with demands for penny subscriptions. Weeping women persuaded dollars by the tens, hundreds and thousands from responsive men. They renounced their bon-bons and new dresses, parties and dowries in their patriotic fervor. The presidents of all the women's societies in the land trooped to Washington. They cried shame at those who trifled for the sake of the fiftieth part of the gold in the vaults with the noblest life in the Union. These unselfish women stormed the capital, and literally poured two millions of dollars, which they had collected in less than three days, upon the floor of the House to rescue the first lady of the land from who knew what? They forced their husbands, their representatives, to do their bidding, and the final vote was passed amid indescribable scenes.  The ransom was now ready for the President and their lady. It had to be accompanied by the national promise to secure freedom to those who delivered up the suffering couple. That was the third of July. Still the impotence of the nation in this new crisis filled thoughtful men with apprehension. Was it moral that cash instead of justice should be given to these stupendous criminals? What a precedent for infamous success! Of what avail courts of law and prisons if such consummate daring goes unpunished? Is there a portion of our national machinery out of gear? If so, which? Nevertheless the excitement was now beyond fever heat. It is safe to say that the temperature of the people had risen ten degrees when the news was flashed abroad that the \"President's money,\" as it was called, had been unanimously voted by Congress. Tears streamed as patriots met each other. Many developed a new species of insanity in their suspense.  The country had now done its part toward the rescue of its chief magistrate and of his perishing consort. Would the abductors be true to their portion of the contract? Party strife had been forgotten in this new anguish. All Fourth of July demonstrations had been postponed until a loving people's thanksgiving for their President's safety could blend with the time honored celebration of a nation's birth.  But suspense was not long delayed. Promptly the New York _Herald_ received a manifesto, this time the last, sent by the arch-conspirators to Congress and the people. This envelope was boldly postmarked Washington. This fact made those in the capital city almost afraid to stir from their homes lest unawares they might meet the demon in their midst who had dwarfed all principals in the records of crime up to the present date. But this final proclamation read as follows:       TO CONGRESS AND ALL AMERICANS.       _We note your late and liberal response to our proposal. We      shall not be outdone in the honorable discharge of obligations.      At precisely eight (8) o'clock on the morning of July sixth      (6th) the payment of ransom and delivery of captives will take      place within one mile of Washington's homestead, Mt. Vernon.      The government vessel with ransom and proper officials on board      will remain in near sight of Mt. Vernon. At our signal (which      shall consist of four Japanese day rockets, each representing a      flaming sword) whether hurled from land or water, the officers      of the government will steam toward the place of delivery.      Guards will fall back immediately upon the discharge of      whistling bombs until the ransom and the ransomed meet. The      Presidential party will bear a flag, vertically striped black      and crimson. On its centre will be a gold half-eagle. Payment      must be made as follows: There must be eighty (80) leathern      bags, each containing one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)      in gold; the amount of ransom being eight million dollars      ($8,000,000) for four weeks' board at one million dollars      ($1,000,000) a week apiece. This money must be paid and its      genuineness certificated upon the honor of the United States by      the Secretaries of State and of the Treasury. If there is any      suspicion of infidelity on the part of the nation, the      President and his wife will be held for another month on the      same terms. Should we be betrayed in the trust which we have      reposed"]]]
