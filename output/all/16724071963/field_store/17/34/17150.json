By nature a philosopher is not       in genius and disposition half so different from a street porter, as a       mastiff is from a grey-hound, or a grey-hound from a spaniel, or this last       from a shepherd’s dog. Those different tribes of animals, however, though       all of the same species are of scarce any use to one another. The strength       of the mastiff is not in the least supported either by the swiftness of       the greyhound, or by the sagacity of the spaniel, or by the docility of       the shepherd’s dog. The effects of those different geniuses and talents,       for want of the power or disposition to barter and exchange, cannot be       brought into a common stock, and do not in the least contribute to the       better accommodation and conveniency of the species. Each animal is still       obliged to support and defend itself, separately and independently, and       derives no sort of advantage from that variety of talents with which       nature has distinguished its fellows. Among men, on the contrary, the most       dissimilar geniuses are of use to one another; the different produces of       their respective talents, by the general disposition to truck, barter, and       exchange, being brought, as it were, into a common stock, where every man       may purchase whatever part of the produce of other men’s talents he has       occasion for.        CHAPTER III. THAT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS LIMITED BY THE EXTENT OF THE MARKET.              As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of       labour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by the       extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market.       When the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement to       dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to       exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is       over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other       men’s labour as he has occasion for.            There are some sorts of industry, even of the lowest kind, which can be       carried on nowhere but in a great town. A porter, for example, can find       employment and subsistence in no other place. A village is by much too       narrow a sphere for him; even an ordinary market-town is scarce large       enough to afford him constant occupation. In the lone houses and very       small villages which are scattered about in so desert a country as the       highlands of Scotland, every farmer must be butcher, baker, and brewer,       for his own family. In such situations we can scarce expect to find even a       smith, a carpenter, or a mason, within less than twenty miles of another       of the same trade. The scattered families that live at eight or ten miles       distance from the nearest of them, must learn to perform themselves a       great number of little pieces of work, for which, in more populous       countries, they would call in the assistance of those workmen. Country       workmen are almost everywhere obliged to apply themselves to all the       different branches of industry that have so much affinity to one another       as to be employed about the same sort of materials. A country carpenter       deals in every sort of work that is made of wood; a country smith in every       sort of work that is made of iron. The former is not only a carpenter, but       a joiner, a cabinet-maker, and even a carver in wood, as well as a       wheel-wright, a plough-wright, a cart and waggon-maker. The employments of       the latter are still more various. It is impossible there should be such a       trade as even that of a nailer in the remote and inland parts of the       highlands of Scotland. Such a workman at the rate of a thousand nails       a-day, and three hundred working days in the year, will make three hundred       thousand nails in the year. But in such a situation it would be impossible       to dispose of one thousand, that is, of one day’s work in the year. As by       means of water-carriage, a more extensive market is opened to every sort       of industry than what land-carriage alone can afford it, so it is upon the       sea-coast, and along the banks of navigable rivers, that industry of every       kind naturally begins to subdivide and improve itself, and it is       frequently not till a long time after that those improvements extend       themselves to the inland parts of the country. A broad-wheeled waggon,       attended by two men, and drawn by eight horses, in about six weeks time,       carries and brings back between London and Edinburgh near four ton weight       of goods. In about the same time a ship navigated by six or eight men, and       sailing between the ports of London and Leith, frequently carries and       brings back two hundred ton weight of goods. Six or eight men, therefore,       by the help of water-carriage, can carry and bring back, in the same time,       the same quantity of goods between London and Edinburgh as fifty       broad-wheeled waggons, attended by a hundred men, and drawn by four       hundred horses. Upon two hundred tons of goods, therefore, carried by the       cheapest land-carriage from London to Edinburgh, there must be charged the       maintenance of a hundred men for three weeks, and both the maintenance and       what is nearly equal to maintenance the wear and tear of four hundred       horses, as well as of fifty great waggons. Whereas, upon the same quantity       of goods carried by water, there is to be charged only the maintenance of       six or eight men, and the wear and tear of a ship of two hundred tons       burthen, together with the value of the superior risk, or the difference       of the insurance between land and water-carriage. Were there no other       communication between those two places, therefore, but by land-carriage,       as no goods could be transported from the one to the other, except such       whose price was very considerable in proportion to their weight, they       could carry on but a small part of that commerce which at present subsists       between them, and consequently could give but a small part of that       encouragement which they at present mutually afford to each other’s       industry. There could be little or no commerce of any kind between the       distant parts of the world. What goods could bear the expense of       land-carriage between London and Calcutta? Or if there were any so       precious as to be able to support this expense, with what safety could       they be transported through the territories of so many barbarous nations?       Those two cities, however, at present carry on a very considerable       commerce with each other, and by mutually affording a market, give a good       deal of encouragement to each other’s industry.            Since such, therefore, are the advantages of water-carriage, it is natural       that the first improvements of art and industry should be made where this       conveniency opens the whole world for a market to the produce of every       sort of labour, and that they should always be much later in extending       themselves into the inland parts of the country. The inland parts of the       country can for a long time have no other market for the greater part of       their goods, but the country which lies round about them, and separates       them from the sea-coast, and the great navigable rivers. The extent of the       market, therefore, must for a long time be in proportion to the riches and       populousness of that country, and consequently their improvement must       always be posterior to the improvement of that country. In our North       American colonies, the plantations have constantly followed either the       sea-coast or the banks of the navigable rivers, and have scarce anywhere       extended themselves to any considerable distance from both.            The nations that, according to the best authenticated history, appear to       have been first civilized, were those that dwelt round the coast of the       Mediterranean sea. That sea, by far the greatest inlet that is known in       the world, having no tides, nor consequently any waves, except such as are       caused by the wind only, was, by the smoothness of its surface, as well as       by the multitude of its islands, and the proximity of its neighbouring       shores, extremely favourable to the infant navigation of the world; when,       from their ignorance of the compass, men were afraid to quit the view of       the coast, and from the imperfection of the art of ship-building, to       abandon themselves to the boisterous waves of the ocean. To pass beyond       the pillars of Hercules, that is, to sail out of the straits of Gibraltar,       was, in the ancient world, long considered as a most wonderful and       dangerous exploit of navigation. It was late before even the Phoenicians       and Carthaginians, the most skilful navigators and ship-builders of those       old times, attempted it; and they were, for a long time, the only nations       that did attempt it.            Of all the countries on the coast of the Mediterranean sea, Egypt seems to       have been the first in which either agriculture or manufactures were       cultivated and improved to any considerable degree. Upper Egypt extends       itself nowhere above a few miles from the Nile; and in Lower Egypt, that       great river breaks itself into many different canals, which, with the       assistance of a little art, seem to have afforded a communication by       water-carriage, not only between all the great towns, but between all "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3300"],["title","An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (#5)"],["body","considerable villages, and even to many farm-houses in the country, nearly       in the same manner as the Rhine and the Maese do in Holland at present.       The extent and easiness of this inland navigation was probably one of the       principal causes of the early improvement of Egypt.            The improvements in agriculture and manufactures seem likewise to have       been of very great antiquity in the provinces of Bengal, in the East       Indies, and in some of the eastern provinces of China, though the great       extent of this antiquity is not authenticated by any histories of whose       authority we, in this part of the world, are well assured. In Bengal, the       Ganges, and several other great rivers, form a great number of navigable       canals, in the same manner as the Nile does in Egypt. In the eastern       provinces of China, too, several great rivers form, by their different       branches, a multitude of canals, and, by communicating with one another,       afford an inland navigation much more extensive than that either of the       Nile or the Ganges, or, perhaps, than both of them put together. It is       remarkable, that neither the ancient Egyptians, nor the Indians, nor the       Chinese, encouraged foreign commerce, but seem all to have derived their       great opulence from this inland navigation.            All the inland parts of Africa, and all that part of Asia which lies any       considerable way north of the Euxine and Caspian seas, the ancient       Scythia, the modern Tartary and Siberia, seem, in all ages of the world,       to have been in the same barbarous and uncivilized state in which we find       them at present. The sea of Tartary is the frozen ocean, which admits of       no navigation; and though some of the greatest rivers in the world run       through that country, they are at too great a distance from one another to       carry commerce and communication through the greater part of it. There are       in Africa none of those great inlets, such as the Baltic and Adriatic seas       in Europe, the Mediterranean and Euxine seas in both Europe and Asia, and       the gulfs of Arabia, Persia, India, Bengal, and Siam, in Asia, to carry       maritime commerce into the interior parts of that great continent; and the       great rivers of Africa are at too great a distance from one another to       give occasion to any considerable inland navigation. The commerce,       besides, which any nation can carry on by means of a river which does not       break itself into any great number of branches or canals, and which runs       into another territory before it reaches the sea, can never be very       considerable, because it is always in the power of the nations who possess       that other territory to obstruct the communication between the upper       country and the sea. The navigation of the Danube is of very little use to       the different states of Bavaria, Austria, and Hungary, in comparison of       what it would be, if any of them possessed the whole of its course, till       it falls into the Black sea.        CHAPTER IV. OF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF MONEY.              When the division of labour has been once thoroughly established, it is       but a very small part of a man’s wants which the produce of his own labour       can supply. He supplies the far greater part of them by exchanging that       surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his       own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he       has occasion for. Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes, in some       measure, a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a       commercial society.            But when the division of labour first began to take place, this power of       exchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embarrassed in       its operations. One man, we shall suppose, has more of a certain commodity       than he himself has occasion for, while another has less. The former,       consequently, would be glad to dispose of; and the latter to purchase, a       part of this superfluity. But if this latter should chance to have nothing       that the former stands in need of, no exchange can be made between them.       The butcher has more meat in his shop than he himself can consume, and the       brewer and the baker would each of them be willing to purchase a part of       it. But they have nothing to offer in exchange, except the different       productions of their respective trades, and the butcher is already       provided with all the bread and beer which he has immediate occasion for.       No exchange can, in this case, be made between them. He cannot be their       merchant, nor they his customers; and they are all of them thus mutually       less serviceable to one another. In order to avoid the inconveniency of       such situations, every prudent man in every period of society, after the       first establishment of the division of labour, must naturally have       endeavoured to manage his affairs in such a manner, as to have at all       times by him, besides the peculiar produce of his own industry, a certain       quantity of some one commodity or other, such as he imagined few people       would be likely to refuse in exchange for the produce of their industry.       Many different commodities, it is probable, were successively both thought       of and employed for this purpose. In the rude ages of society, cattle are       said to have been the common instrument of commerce; and, though they must       have been a most inconvenient one, yet, in old times, we find things were       frequently valued according to the number of cattle which had been given       in exchange for them. The armour of Diomede, says Homer, cost only nine       oxen; but that of Glaucus cost a hundred oxen. Salt is said to be the       common instrument of commerce and exchanges in Abyssinia; a species of       shells in some parts of the coast of India; dried cod at Newfoundland;       tobacco in Virginia; sugar in some of our West India colonies; hides or       dressed leather in some other countries; and there is at this day a       village in Scotland, where it is not uncommon, I am told, for a workman to       carry nails instead of money to the baker’s shop or the ale-house.            In all countries, however, men seem at last to have been determined by       irresistible reasons to give the preference, for this employment, to       metals above every other commodity. Metals can not only be kept with as       little loss as any other commodity, scarce any thing being less perishable       than they are, but they can likewise, without any loss, be divided into       any number of parts, as by fusion those parts can easily be re-united       again; a quality which no other equally durable commodities possess, and       which, more than any other quality, renders them fit to be the instruments       of commerce and circulation. The man who wanted to buy salt, for example,       and had nothing but cattle to give in exchange for it, must have been       obliged to buy salt to the value of a whole ox, or a whole sheep, at a       time. He could seldom buy less than this, because what he was to give for       it could seldom be divided without loss; and if he had a mind to buy more,       he must, for the same reasons, have been obliged to buy double or triple       the quantity, the value, to wit, of two or three oxen, or of two or three       sheep. If, on the contrary, instead of sheep or oxen, he had metals to       give in exchange for it, he could easily proportion the quantity of the       metal to the precise quantity of the commodity which he had immediate       occasion for.            Different metals have been made use of by different nations for this       purpose. Iron was the common instrument of commerce among the ancient       Spartans, copper among the ancient Romans, and gold and silver among all       rich and commercial nations.            Those metals seem originally to have been made use of for this purpose in       rude bars, without any stamp or coinage. Thus we are told by Pliny (Plin.       Hist Nat. lib. 33, cap. 3), upon the authority of Timaeus, an ancient       historian, that, till the time of Servius Tullius, the Romans had no       coined money, but made use of unstamped bars of copper, to purchase       whatever they had occasion for. These rude bars, therefore, performed at       this time the function of money.            The use of metals in this rude state was attended with two very       considerable inconveniences; first, with the trouble of weighing, and       secondly, with that of assaying them. In the precious metals, where a       small difference in the quantity makes a great difference in the value,       even the business of weighing, with proper exactness, requires at least       very accurate weights and scales. The weighing of gold, in particular, is       an operation of some nicety in the coarser metals, indeed, where a small       error would be of little consequence, less accuracy would, no doubt, be       necessary. Yet we should find it excessively troublesome if every time a       poor man had occasion either to buy or sell a farthing’s worth of goods,       he was obliged to weigh the farthing. The operation of assaying is still       more difficult, still more tedious; and, unless a part of the metal is       fairly melted in the crucible, with proper dissolvents, any conclusion       that can be drawn from it is extremely uncertain. Before the institution       of coined money, however, unless they went through this tedious and       difficult operation, people must always have been liable to the grossest       frauds and impositions; and instead of a pound weight of pure silver, or       pure copper, might"]]]
