Their females wouldn't look twice at either of us.\"  When they reached one of the few three-story structures in the city, Johnson dismissed their guard. They entered the building and walked down a short corridor and through a door lettered:                           DONALD H. JOHNSON                           District Manager                       Interplanets Trade Company  \"To be frank with you,\" Hawkes said, as he eased his lank body into the chair Johnson offered, \"I had planned to learn more about your local activities before I introduced myself. However, I've found in the past that my first judgment of a man is usually right, so I think I'll get down to business immediately.\" He drew a set of papers from an inside pocket and tossed them on the desk in front of Johnson. \"I'm a Company Secret Service man,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *  Johnson raised his eyebrows, but looked at the papers without comment. He glanced up at Hawkes.  \"Do you recognize either of the men in the pictures?\" Hawkes asked, when he saw that Johnson had no intention of speaking.  Unhurriedly Johnson picked up the papers and removed a rubber binder. He pulled out two photos and laid them on the desk in front of him. \"The bearded one is the man who waylaid me,\" he said. \"Of course.\"  \"Look at both a little closer,\" Hawkes suggested, \"and see if you don't notice something else.\"  Johnson studied the pictures. \"There's no doubt about the first,\" he murmured. \"Evidently I'm supposed to recognize the other also.\" Abruptly he sat erect. \"They're both the same man,\" he exclaimed. \"Only in the second picture he's clean-shaven.\"  Hawkes nodded. \"There's a story about those two pictures,\" he said. \"But first, let me fill you in on some background. You know that Interplanets has branches on more than a thousand worlds. Because of this widespread operation it's particularly vulnerable to robbery. But it would cost more than the Company's earnings to post adequate guards on every station. And it would be impractical to depend on the protection of the local governments, many of which are extremely primitive. On the other hand, allowing themselves to be robbed with impunity would be financial suicide.\"  Johnson nodded. \"Of course.\"  \"That,\" Hawkes continued, \"is where the Company's Secret Service comes in. It never lets up on the effort it will make to solve a robbery and bring the perpetrators to justice. And it never quits, once it begins an investigation. That policy has proven very effective in discouraging thievery. During the Company's entire tenure there have been less than a dozen unsolved thefts--and two of them occurred right here on Marlock.\"  \"I was a clerk with the Company at the time of the second,\" Johnson said reminiscently. \"Been with them about three years then. That must have been over twenty years ago. I....\" He paused and looked down. \"I remember,\" he said. \"The picture without the beard.... That's the thief. The photograph was taken by one of the automatic cameras set up for just that purpose; we still use them. But they never found the man.\"  \"That's right,\" Hawkes agreed. \"That robbery occurred a little over twenty years ago. And the other picture you have was taken at the time of the first robbery--approximately twenty-five years before that.\"  \"But it isn't possible,\" Johnson protested. \"These pictures are of the same man. And there's obviously no twenty-five year spread in age between them. Unless....\"  \"Unless one is the other's father, or a relative that resembles him very closely?\" Hawkes finished. \"Look at the pictures again. There's the same scar on both foreheads, the same pock-mark on the right cheek; our special section has even made measurements of the comparative sizes of the nose, ears and other features. There's no possible doubt that the pictures are of the same man.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"How do you explain it?\" Johnson asked.  \"I don't,\" Hawkes replied quietly. \"That's one of the things I'm here to learn. But did you notice this? The man we encountered this afternoon was not only the same as the one on those pictures: he still looks the same. We might, for the sake of argument, grant that a man's appearance would change only slightly in twenty-five years. But when you add another twenty-three on top of that--and he's still unchanged...?\"  \"If you're certain that he's the man, why don't you arrest him?\" Johnson asked.  \"Can we arrest a man apparently about thirty years old and accuse him of a crime committed forty-eight years ago--or even twenty-three years ago?\"  \"I suppose not,\" Johnson agreed. \"What do you intend to do?\"  \"I haven't decided yet. First I'll have to learn more about the situation here. You can help me with that. Right now I'd like to know something about the native customs--especially in regard to legal matters.\"  \"Their laws are fairly simple,\" Johnson began. \"There's no law against stealing or taking by force anything you can get away with. That sounds absurd by Earth standards, it prevents the amassing of more goods than an individual needs, and makes for fairly equitable distribution. If a native somehow acquires a sudden amount of wealth--goods, in their case--he must hire guards to protect it. Guarding is a major occupation. They do an especially big business during the tourist seasons. In time the pay of the guards will eat up any native's surplus. Either way--by loss or guard pay--the wealth is soon redistributed.\"  \"Can they even kill one another with impunity?\"  \"No. Their laws are rigid in that respect. In the process of--relieving another of his property, they must neither break a major bone, nor inflict permanent damage. If they disobey, they are tortured to death in the public square.\"  Hawkes asked, \"Who enforces their law?\"  \"One of the clans. Its members are supported in their duties by all the others. And there's a permanent open season on murderers. Anyone, police or civilian may revenge a victim.\"  \"How about the law against carrying firearms?\"  \"With them, intent is tantamount to commission,\" Johnson replied. \"Only foreigners are ever foolish enough to be caught armed. However, all native laws apply to them also. The only concession the Company has been able to force is that a foreign offender isn't tortured: He's put in jail for ten years. None ever live to come out.\"  \"I see,\" Hawkes said. \"Interesting. However, the immediate situation is this. I've been sent here because the Service received reports that our bearded friend had made another appearance. And we believe it's safe to assume that he's here to attempt a third robbery. Right now we'll have to pass over his trick of longevity. Our problem is to catch him in the act. When do you think he'll make his play?\"  \"It'll have to be some time before tomorrow noon,\" Johnson answered. \"Under our setup we accept furs from the natives whenever they're brought in. But we pay off only once a year. That way I'm not burdened with guarding money the whole year around. I have well over fifty thousand credits in the safe now. And tomorrow I begin paying off.\"  \"Then we'll have to be ready for him,\" Hawkes said, \"though I don't expect him until tonight. Probably just about the time you're ready to close. He'll need you to open the safe. I can count on your help?\"  Johnson nodded.         *       *       *       *       *  That night as they waited in his office, Johnson turned to Hawkes. \"I've been giving some thought to what you told me this afternoon about the robberies. I have a theory that might account for some of the things we don't understand.\"  \"Yes?\" Hawkes looked closely at Johnson.  \"You've probably heard of our tourist attraction called Nature's Moebius Strip? As far as we know, no one has ever gone beyond a certain point--and returned. Suppose there's a time flaw at that point--and the bearded man has somehow learned about it. Suppose anyone completing the Moebius circle, and returning, finds--say, twenty years have elapsed, while to him only a few minutes have passed?\"  \"Go on.\" Hawkes leaned forward intently.  [Illustration]  \"He makes his first holdup,\" Johnson continued, \"and goes around the Strip. When he comes out twenty years later they're no longer looking for him. He leaves Marlock, and during the next five years he goes through the money he stole. He returns and repeats the process. This time the money lasts only three years. Now he's back to try it again. Do you see how that would tie everything up in a neat little package?\"  [Illustration]  Hawkes smiled, as he relaxed and sat back. \"A bit too neat,\" he said. \"Also, you don't have an ounce of concrete evidence to back up your theory.\"  \"That's right. I don't,\" Johnson agreed.  Outside the door a board creaked. Johnson glanced quickly across the room to where Hawkes sat with a pistol on his lap. Hawkes' eyebrows raised, but he made no sound.         *       *       *       *       *  Suddenly the door was kicked open and the black-bearded stranger stood framed in the doorway. \"Raise 'em!\" he barked. The gun in his hand was aimed at Johnson.  The man took two steps into the room. Hawkes shifted slightly in his chair and the gunman's head swiveled in his direction. The slug from Hawkes' pistol made a small blue hole in the upper left corner of his forehead.  The thug's face tipped up, shocked and unbelieving. He swayed slowly before he fell backward, his body rigid. His fur cap flew from his head as he struck the floor.  \"I thought we'd better play it safe,\" Hawkes said as he rose and walked over to the fallen man. He slipped his gun into his pocket before he bent and picked up the cap at his feet. He dropped it over the upturned face.  For a long moment the silence held thin as the two men looked at each other. Hawkes stood, wiping his right hand on his trouser leg. Johnson toyed idly with the gun he had picked up from the desk in front of him.  Finally Hawkes "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33790"],["title","Delayed Action (#3)"],["body","his body sag into a chair at Johnson's right. \"This is always a dirty business,\" he said sourly.  Johnson sat down also. \"Did you notice the look on his face when he saw you, and you shot him?\" he asked, abstractedly turning the pistol in his hand. \"Funny thing. In that half-second before he fell an article I read somewhere flashed into my mind. It seems that during the French Revolution a certain doctor got to wondering just how long a man's brain remained active after his head had been cut off. He persuaded some of his friends who were due to be guillotined to cooperate in a series of tests. Each man was to keep blinking his eyes as long as possible after his head left his body, as a sign that he was still conscious. The doctor counted as high as six winks.\"  \"Very interesting, I'm sure,\" Hawkes said guardedly. \"But a bit morbid, isn't it?\"  \"I was wondering,\" Johnson went on as though he had not heard the other, \"whether he was still conscious for that instant after you shot him. And if that brought the look of surprise to his face.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Hawkes turned in his chair to face Johnson fully. \"You're driving at something,\" he said sharply. \"Get to the point.\"  \"Personally I've wondered at a few things about you myself,\" Johnson said. He held the gun steadily in his hand now, no longer pretending to play with it. \"I told you that our second robbery occurred while I was a clerk with the Company,\" he went on. \"They jerked me in to the Home Office, and for a while I had a pretty rough time.... You know, when I joined the Company, I was an amnesiac. I remembered my name, but that's about all....\"  \"No, I didn't know,\" Hawkes muttered, growing slightly paler.  \"I learned then from the Home Office that I had been a member of their Secret Service some twenty years earlier. I'd been sent here to investigate the first robbery. And I had disappeared. Naturally, they had suspected me.  \"However, they had no evidence, and when I reappeared twenty years later they played it smart by just waiting, instead of arresting me. When the second robbery occurred, they closed in.  \"The only thing that saved me was the fact that tests proved my memory was really gone, and that I had told the truth--as I knew it. From the few scraps of information I retained--about being out on the Moebius Strip--they and I arrived at the theory I mentioned a short time ago. I was sent back here to wait. The Company never gives up. Remember?\"  \"Are you insinuating that I was in cahoots with this fellow here?\" Hawkes asked harshly.  \"I'd say it was more than an insinuation,\" Johnson replied. \"You made several other slips. In the first place, Secret Service men are usually better informed about a situation they're investigating than you seemed to be. Also, those identification papers you showed me were faked.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The skin along the bridge of Hawkes' nose had drawn tight, and now his lips grew narrower. \"In that case, why did I save you from that man this afternoon?\" he asked. \"And why would I shoot him now?\"  \"Your saving me was an act, to get into my confidence. You shot him so you wouldn't have to split the loot. I figure you were in with him on the second robbery also. There had to be someone because his memory would be gone, when he came off the Strip. But you weren't satisfied. Together you decided to pull off another robbery while you were here and double the spoils. Then you decided you wanted it all for yourself and you shot him.\"  \"There's one big flaw in your reasoning,\" Hawkes pointed out. \"How did I plan to get away? The only ships leaving here for several months belong to the Company. Do you think I'd be foolish enough to expect them to let me slip out on one of their ships?\"  \"No. I think you intended to go out on the Strip yourself.\"  \"All right then,\" Hawkes countered. \"You admitted that this was a two-man job. How could I protect myself when I returned, if I knew in advance that I wouldn't know who I was, let alone what I had done?\"  \"I'll come back to that in a minute,\" Johnson said. \"But now I'd advise you to drop your gun on the floor and give yourself up. You've got nothing to gain by carrying on the bluff. You know I'll never let you get to the Strip. And, once I put you on the ship, the Company will take over.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Hawkes' shoulders drooped. Finally he smiled raggedly. \"There's no use my arguing any longer,\" he said. \"But you've made the mistake of underestimating me, my friend. I've lost my gamble. That's all. You have nothing on me. I'm not as ignorant of native law as I may have pretended. Granted, I am carrying a lethal weapon. But I'm on private property. That's legal. I shot a man. But only in defense of my own life. His gun on the floor will prove he came in armed. So I'm clean as far as the natives are concerned. Right?\"  Johnson nodded.  \"And, as for the Company, what will they hold me for? They can't prove any connection between me and him.\" Hawkes indicated the man on the floor. \"And this robbery--it never actually came off. Earth laws don't allow prosecution for intent. Now, where does that leave you?\"  Johnson stood up. \"You're right--as far as you went,\" he said. \"But, returning to your earlier question about one man pulling this job, I asked myself how I would do it, if it had to be done alone. And I found a way. You'd probably figure the same one. Now I'll take that paper in your pocket. It will serve very well as a confession.\"  Suddenly Hawkes' right hand streaked toward a side pocket. Johnson leaned forward and brought the flat of his gun across the other's temple.  As Hawkes sagged, Johnson ripped open his coat and took out a sealed envelope. He removed a sheet of paper and read:       _This has been written for my own information. My name is      Alton Hawkes. I have robbed the Interplanets Company and      gone out on the Strip with the money. When I read this my      memory will be gone and twenty years will have elapsed._                                                       --CHARLES V.
