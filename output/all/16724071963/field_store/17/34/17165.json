The other seven men came crawling out of the bushes to light up their “woodbines”  and fag-ends.  “Well, I'm off,” said I, and once more went forward in the direction pointed out by the corporal and his lost squad.  “So long, mate--good luck!” he shouted.  “Same to you!” I called back.  And now came sleep upon me. Even as I walked an awful weariness fell upon every limb. My legs became heavy and slow. That short rest had stiffened me, and my eyelids closed as I trudged on. I lifted them with an effort and dragged one foot after the other. I knew I must get back to my unit, and that here it was very dangerous. I wanted to lie down on the dead grass and sleep and sleep and sleep. I urged my muscles to swing my legs--for I knew if once I sat down to rest I should never keep awake.  It was while I was thus trying to jerk my sleepy nerves on to action that I came upon a zigzagged trench. It was fully six feet deep and about a yard wide. It was of course an old Turkish defence running crosswise along the great backbone of the Sirt. I knew now that I was nearing the bay, for most of these trenches overlooked the beach.  There was a white object about ten yards from me. What it was I could not tell, and a quiver of fear ran through me and threw off the awful sleepiness of fatigue.  Was it a Turkish sniper's shirt? Or was it a piece of white cloth, or a sheet of paper? In the gloom of night I could not discover.  However, I determined to go steady, and I crept up to a dark thorn-bush and stood still. It did not move. Still standing against the dark bush to hide the fact that I was unarmed, I shouted--  “Halt! who are you?” in as gruff and threatening a tone as I could command.  Silence. It did not move. I ran forward along the trench and there found a white pack-mule all loaded up with baggage; I could make out the queerly worked trappings, with brass-coins on the fringed bridle and coloured fly-tassels over the eyes. It was stone dead and stiff. Its eyes glared at me--a glassy glare full of fear. The Turkish pack-mule had been bringing up material to the Turks in the trench when it had been killed--and now the deep sides of the trench were holding it upright.  I trudged away towards the beach and lay down to sleep at last among the other men of the ambulance, who were lying scattered about behind tufts of bush or against ledges of rock.  When weighed down with sleep any bed will serve.  And this was the end of our first day's work on the field.     CHAPTER XIV. THE SNIPER OF THE PEAR-TREE GULLY   We used to start long before daylight, when the heavy gloom of early morning swept mountain, sea and sand in an indistinct haze; when the cobwebs hung thick from thorn to thorn like fairy cats'-cradles all dripping and beaded with those heavy dews. The guard would wake us up about 3.30 A.M. We were asleep anywhere, lying about under rocks and in sandy dells, sleeping on our haversacks and water-bottles, and our pith helmets near by. We got an issue of biscuit and jam, or biscuit and bully-beef, to take with us, and each one carried his iron rations in a little bag at his side.  So we set off--a long, straggling, follow-my-leader line of men and stretchers. The officer first, then the stretcher-sergeant--(myself)--and the squads, two men to a stretcher, carrying the stretchers folded up, and last of all a corporal or a “lance-jack” bringing up the rear in case any one should fall out.  Cold, dark, shivery mornings they were; our clothes soaked in dew and our pith helmets reeking wet, with the puggaree all beaded with dew-drops. We toiled up and up the ridges and gullies of the Kislar Dargh and the Kapanja Sirt slowly, like a little column of ants going out to bring in the ant eggs.  Often we had to wait while the Indian transport came down from the hill-track before we could proceed, and we always came upon the Engineers' field-telegraph wires on the ground. I would shout “Wire!”  over my shoulder, and the shout “Wire!... Wire!... Wire!” went down the line from squad to squad.  From the old Turkish well I led my stretcher-squads past the gun of the Field Artillery (mounted quite near our hospital tents) along a track which ran past a patch of dry yellow grass and dead thistles--here among the prickly plants and sage-bushes grew a white flower--pure and sweet-scented--something like a flag--a “holy flower” among the dead and scorched-up yellow ochre blades and the khaki and dull grey-greens of thorns. We went along this track, past the dead sniper which Hawk and I had so carefully stalked. Near by, hidden by bushes and rank willow thickets lay a dozen more dead Turks, swollen, fly-blown and stinking in the broiling sun. We hurried on past the Turkish bivouacs--many of the relics had been picked up by the British Tommies since last I saw the place: the tobacco had all gone--many of the shirts and overcoats which had been lying about had disappeared--the place had been thoroughly ransacked. We trudged past the wooden cross of our dead comrade and we were silent.  Indeed, throughout those first three days--Saturday, Sunday and Monday--when the British and Turks grappled to and fro and flung shrapnel at each other incessantly; when the fighting line swayed and bent, sometimes pushing back the Turks, sometimes bending in the British; when the fate of the whole undertaking still hung in the balance; when what became a semi-failure might have been a staggering success: in those days the death-silence fell upon us all.  No one whistled those rag-time tunes; no one tried to make jokes, except the very timid, and they giggled nervously at their own.  No one spoke unless it was quite necessary. Each man you passed asked you the vital question: “Any water?”  For a moment as he asks his eyes glitter with a gleam of hope--when you shake your head he simply trudges on over the rocks and scrub with the same fatigued and sullen dullness which we all suffered.  Often you asked the same question yourself with parched and burning lips.  One after another we came upon the wounded. Here a man dragging a broken leg along with him. Here a man holding his fractured fore-arm and running towards us. Sometimes the pitiful cry, faint and full of agony: “Stretchers! Stretcher-bearers!” away in some densely overgrown defile swept with bullets and shrapnel.  And so at last all my squads had turned back with stretchers loaded with men and pieces of men. I went on alone--a lonely figure wandering about the mountains, looking and listening for the wounded.  I came now upon a party of Engineers at work making a road. They were working with pick-axe and spade--clearing away bush and rocks.  “Any water?” they asked.  I shook my head.  “Any wounded?” I said.  “Some down there, they say,” said a red-faced man.  “Damn rotten job that,” muttered another, as I went on.  “Better keep well over in the bushes,” shouted the red-faced man. “They've got this bit of light-coloured ground marked--you're almost sure ter git plugged.”  “Thanks!” I called back, and broke off to my left among the sage and thistle and thorn.  I went now downhill into an overgrown water-course (very much like the one in which I used to sleep and eat away back by the artillery big gun). Here were willows and brambles with ripe blackberries, and wild-rose bushes with scarlet hips. “Just like England!” I thought.  And then, as I crossed the little dry-bed stream and came out upon a sandy spit of rising ground: “Z-z-ipp! Ping!”--just by my left arm. The bullet struck a ledge of white rock with the now familiar metallic “tink!”  I went on moving quickly to get behind a thorn-bush--the only cover near at hand. Here, at any rate, I should be out of sight.  “Ping!”  “Crack--ping!”  I could hear the report of the rifle. I lay flat on my stomach, grovelled my face into the sandy soil and lay like a snake and as still as a tortoise.  I waited for about ten minutes. It seemed an hour, at least, to me. The sniper did not shoot again. In front of my thorn-bush was an open space of pale yellow grass, with no cover at all. I crawled towards the left flank and tried to creep slowly away. I moved like the hands of a clock--so slowly; about an inch at a time, pushing forward like a reptile on my stomach, propelling myself only by digging my toes into the earth. My arms I kept stiff by my side, my head well down.  But the sniper away behind that little pear-tree (which stood at the far end of the open space) had an eagle eye.  “Ping! z-z-pp! ping!”  I lay very still for a long time and then crept slowly back to my thorn-bush.  I tried the right flank, but with the same effect. And now he began shooting through my thorn-bush on the chance of hitting me.  Behind me was a dense undergrowth of thorn, wild-rose bramble, thistle, willow and sage.  I turned about and crawled through this tangle, until at last I came out, scratched and dishevelled and sweating, into the old water-course.  The firing-line was only a few hundred yards away, and the bullets from a Turkish maxim went wailing over my head, dropping far over by the Engineers whom I had passed.  I wanted to find those wounded, and I wanted to get past that open space, and I wanted above all to dodge that sniper. The old scouting instincts of the primitive man came calling me to try my skill against the skill of the Turk. I sat there wiping away blood from the scratches and sweat from my forehead and trying to think of a way through.  I looked at the mountains on my left--the lower ridge of the Kapanja Sirt--and saw how the water-course went up and up and in and out, and I thought if I kept low and crawled round in this ditch I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3306"],["title","At Suvla Bay (#8)"],["body","come out at last close behind the firing-line, and then I could get in touch with the trenches. I could hear the machine-gun of the M--'s rattling and spitting.  I began crawling along the water-course. I had only gone three yards or so, and turned a bend, when I came suddenly upon two wounded men. Both quite young--one merely a boy. He had a bad shrapnel wound through his boot, crushing the toes of his right foot. The other lay groaning upon his back--with a very bad shrapnel wound in his left arm. The arm was broken.  The boy sat up and grinned when he saw me.  “What's up?” asked his pal.  “Red Cross man,” says the boy; and then: “Any water?”  “Not a drop, mate,” said I. “Been wounded long?”  “Since yesterday evening,” says the boy.  “Been here all that time?” I asked. (It was now mid-afternoon.)  “Yes: couldn't get away”--and he pointed to his foot.  “'E carn't move--it's 'is arm. We crawled 'ere.”  “I'll be back soon with stretchers and bandages,” I said, and went quickly back along the water-course and then past the Engineers.  “Found 'em?” they asked.  “Yes: getting stretchers up now,” said I. “Awful stink here! Found any dead?” I asked.  “Yes, there's one or two round here. We buried one over there yesterday: 'e fell ter bits when we moved 'im.”  I went on. Soon I was back in the ditch beside the wounded men. I had successfully dodged the sniper by following along the bottom of the bed of the stream. With me I brought two stretcher-squads, and they had a haversack containing, as I thought, splints and bandages. But when I opened it, it had only some field dressings in it and some iodine ampoules.  I soon found that the man's arm was not only septic, but broken and splintered.  “Got a pair of scissors?” I asked.  One man had a pair of nail-scissors, and with this very awkward instrument I proceeded to operate. It was a terrible gash. His sleeve was soaked in blood. I cut it away, and his shirt also.  I broke an iodine phial and poured the yellow chemical into his great gaping wound. Actually his flesh stunk: it was going bad.  “Is it broke?” he asked.  “Be all right in a few minutes; nothing much.” I lied to him.  “Not broke then?”  “Bit bent; be all right.”  With the nail-scissors I cut great chunks of his arm out, and all this flesh was gangrenous, and mortification was rapidly spreading. My fingers were soaked in blood and iodine.  I cut away a piece of muscle which stunk like bad meat.  “Can you feel that?” I asked.  “Feel what?” he murmured.  “I thought that might hurt. I was cutting your sleeve away, that's all.”  I cut out all the bad flesh, almost to the broken bones. I filled up the jagged hole with another iodine ampoule. I plugged the opening with double-cyanide gauze, and put on an antiseptic pad.  “Splints?” I asked.  “Haven't any.”  So I used the helve of an entrenching-tool and the stalks of the willow undergrowth.  I set his arm straight and bandaged it tightly and fixed it absolutely immovably. Then we got him on a stretcher, and they carried him three and a half miles to our ambulance tents. But I'm afraid that arm had to come off. I never heard of him again.  The other fellow was cheerful enough, and only set his teeth and drew his breath when I cut off his boot with a jack-knife. Wonderful endurance some of these young fellows have. There's hope for England yet.     CHAPTER XV. KANGAROO BEACH             “COMMUNICATIONS”       The native only needs a drum,      On which to thump his dusky thumb--       But WE--the Royal Engineers,      Must needs have carts and pontoon-piers;      Hundreds of miles of copper-wire,      Fitted on poles to make it higher.      Hundreds of sappers lay it down,      And stick the poles up like a town.      By a wonderful system of dashes and dots,      Safe from the Turkish sniper's shots--      We have, as you see, a marvellous trick,      Of sending messages double-quick.      You can't deny it's a great erection,      Done by the 3rd Field Telegraph Section;      But somewhere--      THERE'S A DISCONNECTION!       The native merely thumps his drum,      He thumps it boldly, thus--“Tum! Tum!”                          J. H.                 (Sailing for Salonika.)   Kangaroo Beach was where the Australian bridge-building section had their stores and dug-outs.  It was one muddle and confusion of water-tanks, pier-planks, pontoons, huge piles of bully-beef, biscuit and jam boxes. Here we came each evening with the water-cart to get our supply of water, and here the water-carts of every unit came down each evening and stood in a row and waited their turn. The water was pumped from the water-tank boats to the tank on shore.  The water-tank boats brought it from Alexandria. It was filthy water, full of dirt, and very brackish to taste. Also it was warm. During the two months at Suvla Bay I never tasted a drop of cold water--it was always sickly lukewarm, sun-stewed.  All day long high explosives used to sing and burst--sometimes killing and wounding men, sometimes blowing up the bully-beef and biscuits, sometimes falling with a hiss and a column of white spray into the sea. It was here that the field-telegraph of the Royal Engineers became a tangled spider's web of wires and cross wires. They added wires and branch wires every day, and stuck them up on thin poles. Here you could see the Engineers in shirt and shorts trying to find a disconnection, or carrying a huge reel of wire. Wooden shanties sprang up where dug-outs had been a day or so before. Piers began to crawl out into the bay, adding a leg and trestle and pontoon every hour. Near Kangaroo Beach was the camp of the Indians, and here you could see the dusky ones praying on prayer mats and cooking rice and “chupatties” (sort of oatcake-pancakes).  Here they were laying a light rail from the beach up with trucks for carrying shells and parts of big guns.  Here was the field post-office with sacks and sacks of letters and parcels. Some of the parcels were burst and unaddressed; a pair of socks or a mouldy home-made cake squashed in a cardboard box--sometimes nothing but the brown paper, card box and string, an empty shell--the contents having disappeared. What happened to all the parcels which never got to the Dardanelles no one knows, but those which did arrive were rifled and lost and stolen. Parcels containing cigarettes had a way of not getting delivered, and cakes and sweets often fell out mysteriously on the way from England.     CHAPTER XVI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE LOST SQUADS   Things became jumbled.  The continual working up to the firing-line and the awful labour of carrying heavy men back to our dressing station: it went on. We got used to being always tired, and having only an hour or two of sleep. It was log-heavy, dreamless sleep... sheer nothingness. Just as tired when you were wakened in the early hours by a sleepy, grumbling guard. And then going round finding the men and wakening them up and getting them on parade. Every day the same... late into the night.  Then came the disappearance of a certain section of our ambulance and the loss of an officer.  This particular young lieutenant was left on Lemnos sick. He really was very sick indeed. He recovered to some extent of the fever, and joined us one day at Suvla. This was in the Old Dry Water-course period, when Hawk and I lived in the bush-grown ditch.  Officers, N.C.O.'s, and men were tired out with overwork. This young officer came up to the Kapanja Sirt to take over the next spell of duty.  I remember him now, pale and sickly, with the fever still hanging on him, and dark, sunken eyes. He spoke in a dull, lifeless way.  “Do you think you'll be all right?” asked the adjutant.  “Yes, I think so,” he answered.  “Well, just stick here and send down the wounded as you find them. Don't go any farther along; it's too dangerous up there--you understand?”  “All right, sir.”  It was only a stroke of luck that I didn't stay with him and his stretcher-squads.  “You'd better come down with me, sergeant,” says the adjutant.  Next day the news spread in that mysterious way which has always puzzled me. It spread as news does spread in the wild and desolate regions of the earth.  “... lost... all the lot...”  “Who is?”  “Up there... Lieutenant S--- and the squads...”  “How-joo-know?”  “Just heard--that wounded fellow over there on the stretcher... they went out early this morning, and they've gone--no sign, never came back at all--”  “'E warn't fit ter take charge... 'e was ill, you could see.”  “Nice thing ter do. The old man'll go ravin' mad.”  “It was a ravin' mad thing to put the poor feller in charge... ”  “Don't criticise yer officers,” said some wit, quoting the Army Regulations.  The adjutant and a string of squads turned out, and we went back again to the spot where we had left the young officer the evening before.  The cook and an orderly man remained, and we heard from them the details of the mystery.  Early that morning they had formed up, and gone off under Lieutenant S--- along the mule track overlooking the Gulf of Saros. That was all. There was still hope, of course... but there wasn't a sign of them to be seen. The machine-gun section had seen them pass right along. Some officers had warned them not to go up, but they went and they never came back.  There were rumours that one of the N.C.O.'s of the party, a sergeant, had been seen lying on some rocks.  “Just riddled with bullets--riddled!”  The hours dragged on. I begged of the adjutant to let me go off along the ridge on my own to see if I could find any trace.  “It's too dangerous,” he said. “If I thought there was half a chance I'd go with you, but we don't want to lose any more.”  Those ten or twelve men went out of our lives completely. Days passed. There was no news. It was queer. It was queer when I called the roll next day--  “Briggs!”--“Sar'nt!”  “Boots!”--“Sarn't!”  “Cudworth!”--“Here, Sar'nt!”  “Dean!”--“Sar'nt!”  “Desmond!”--“Sar'nt!”  “D---.”  I couldn't remember not to "]]]
