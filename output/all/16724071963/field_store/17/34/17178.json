      WATER AND SHORE BIRDS.                                  General Hints.   The _Loon_ and _Grebes_ are common representatives of the order of Diving Birds. Their legs are set far back on the body, making it difficult for them to walk at all.  *Grebes look like small, tailless ducks. They have long, slender necks,           short wings, smooth glossy plumage and flat, lobed feet. They           rarely leave the water and can dive or sink out of sight           instantly when disturbed, swimming to a distance with only the           tip of the bill out of water.  *Loons are very large, with flat, heavy bodies, short tails and long,           tapering bills. They are never crested, but are conspicuously           marked, and are equally expert with the grebes in diving and           sinking.  _Gulls_ and _Terns_ belong to the order of the _Long-winged Swimmers_, but are better described by the name of _Skimmers_.  *Terns are much slenderer and usually smaller than gulls, have very           pointed bills and wings, and forked tails. They rarely if ever           swim, but skim swallow-like over the water, bill downward,           plunging into the water for their prey.  *Gulls are plumper than terns, with heavier bills and tails usually even.           They do not dive or plunge suddenly into the water, but fly and           soar or float about on the surface, sitting well up out of the           water.  _Ducks_, _Geese and Swans_ have webbed feet and short legs, and in walking carry themselves almost horizontal. As a rule they have very strong wings, enabling them to fly long distances at great speed. Our ducks are most easily remembered in three groups:--  *1. The fish-eating Mergansers, whose plumage is largely black and white           and which have saw-edged bills and, usually, conspicuous           crests.  *2. The Sea Ducks, which are conspicuously marked but plainly colored,           frequent open water or the sea coast, diving, often to great           depths, for their food. Descriptions are given of the _Lesser           Scaup_, _Redhead_, _Canvas-back_, _American Golden-eye_,           _Old-squaw_ _and_ _Buffle-head_.  *3. The River Ducks, which have broad, rounded bills, are much variegated           in color and markings, and have a peculiar habit of feeding           head downwards, as though standing on their heads with the body           tipped up. The _Teals_, _Mallard_, _Wood Duck_ and _Pintail_           belong to this group. The females of these ducks, though           differing noticeably in size, may easily be confused.  *Geese are larger than ducks, feed mostly on land and are usually seen           during migration flying at a height in regular ranks after a           leader.  _Herons_ and _Bitterns_ belong among the _Wading Birds_. They have long, pointed bills, long legs, loose, baggy plumage, broad wings and long necks, curved s shaped in flight.  *Herons are tall, crested birds, with very long legs, bills and necks and           small tails. Their notes are harsh and squawking. Large numbers           sometimes nest together.  *Bitterns have shorter legs, necks and bills than herons and are very           rarely crested. They utter hoarse, resounding calls, and are           ordinarily solitary in habit.  _Rails and Coots_ are known as _Marsh Birds_, although the latter are fine swimmers.  *Rails as a rule are smaller than bitterns and frequent grassy marshes           where they steal stealthily about, effectively concealed by           their dull streaky plumage. Short turned-up tails, short wings           and long legs are noticeable characteristics of these rapid           runners.  *Coots are ducklike in appearance and smoothly plumaged. Lobed feet           enable them to swim easily. Their bills spread out at the base           in the form of a plate or shield which extends up on to the           forehead.  _Plover_, _Sandpipers_ and the _Woodcock_ are strikingly different representatives of the great order of _Shore Birds_. The plover family have stout, short bills, while the sandpipers and woodcock belong to a family which have soft probing bills of greatly varying length, for obtaining their food in soft mud.  *Sandpipers have pointed wings, are dull-colored, and are usually found           slipping gracefully along the water's edge in search of food.           They skim rapidly over the water on outspread wings, and their           clear, reed-like notes are distinctly musical.  *Plovers are small and plump, with long pointed wings, short necks and           rather flat heads. They run and fly very rapidly, generally in           flocks piping loudly but sweetly. They frequent the inland as           well as the shore.  _Shore_ and _Water Birds_ are often extremely shy and they can detect the presence of an observer at a distance. The caution is therefore emphasized to approach them slowly and quietly.                                Particular Hints.   *Note:--Owing to a lack of sufficient data the following _Shore_ and _Water Birds_ are arranged according to the American Ornithologist's Union"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33125"],["title","Wild Birds in City Parks (#7)"],["body","instead of their average first appearance.
