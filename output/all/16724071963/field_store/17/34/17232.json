They were the daughters of Themis (Law), who sits by Jove on his throne to give him counsel.  The Erinnyes, or Furies, were three goddesses who punished crimes by their secret stings.  The heads of the Furies were wreathed with serpents, and their whole appearance was terrific and appalling.  Their names were Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera. They were also called Eumenides.  Nemesis was also an avenging goddess.  She represents the righteous anger of the gods, particularly towards the proud and insolent.  Pan [the name Pan means everything, and he is sometimes spoken of as the god of all nature] was the god of flocks and shepherds. His favorite residence, as the Greeks describe him, was in Arcadia.  The Satyrs were deities of the woods and fields.  They were conceived to be covered with bristly hair, their heads decorated with short, sprouting horns, and their feet like goats' feet.  Momus was the god of laughter, and Plutus the god of wealth.  ROMAN DIVINITIES  The preceding are Grecian divinities, though received also by the Romans.  Those which follow are peculiar to Roman mythology.  Saturn was an ancient Italian deity.  The Roman poets tried to identify him with the Grecian god Kronos, and fabled that after his dethronement by Jupiter, he fled to Italy, where he reigned during what was called the Golden Age.  In memory of his beneficent dominion, the feast of Saturnalia was held every year in the winter season.  Then all public business was suspended, declarations of war and criminal executions were postponed, friends made presents to one another, and the slaves were indulged with great liberties.  A feast was given them at which they sat at table, while their masters served them, to show the natural equality of men, and that all things belonged equally to all, in the reign of Saturn.  Faunus [there was also a goddess called Fauna, or Bona Dea], the grandson of Saturn, was worshipped as the god of fields and shepherds, and also as a prophetic god.  His name in the plural, Fauns, expressed a class of gamesome deities, like the Satyrs of the Greeks.  Quirinus was a war god, said to be no other than Romulus the founder of Rome, exalted after his death to a place among the gods.  Bellona, a war goddess.  Terminus, the god of landmarks.  His statue was a rude stone or post, set in the ground to mark the boundaries of fields.  Pales, the goddess presiding over cattle and pastures.  Pomona presided over fruit trees.  Flora, the goddess of flowers.  Lucina, the goddess of childbirth.  Vesta (the Hestia of the Greeks) was a deity presiding over the public and private hearth.  A sacred fire, tended by six virgin priestesses called Vestals, flamed in her temple.  As the safety of the city was held to be connected with its conservation, the neglect of the virgins, if they let it go out, was severely punished, and the fire was rekindled from the rays of the sun.  Liber is another Latin name of Bacchus; and Mulciber of Vulcan.  Janus was the porter of heaven.  He opens the year, the first month being named after him.  He is the guardian deity of gates, on which account he is commonly represented with two heads, because every door looks two ways.  His temples at Rome were numerous.  In war time the gates of the principal one were always open.  In peace they were closed; but they were shut only once between the reign of Numa and that of Augustus.  The Penates were the gods who were supposed to attend to the welfare and prosperity of the family.  Their name is derived from Penus, the pantry, which was sacred to them.  Every master of a family was the priest to the Penates of his own house.  The Lares, or Lars, were also household gods, but differed from the Penates in being regarded as the deified spirits of mortals. The family Lars were held to be the souls of the ancestors, who watched over and protected their descendants.  The words Lemur and Larva more nearly correspond to our word Ghost.  The Romans believed that every man had his Genius, and every woman her Juno; that is, a spirit who had given them being, and was regarded as a protector through life.  On birthdays men made offerings to their Genius, women to their Juno.  Macaulay thus alludes to some of the Roman gods:--    \"Pomona loves the orchard,   And Liber loves the vine,   And Pales loves the straw-built shed   Warm with the breath of kine;   And Venus loves the whisper   Of plighted youth and maid   In April's ivory moonlight,   Beneath the Chestnut shade.\"   \"Prophecy of Capys.\"  N.B.  It is to be observed that in proper names the final e and es are to be sounded.  Thus Cybele and Penates are words of three syllables.  But Proserpine and Thebes have been so long used as English words, that they may be regarded as exceptions, to be pronounced as if English.  Hecate is sometimes pronounced by the poets as a dissylable.  In the Index at the close of the volume, we shall mark the accented syllable, in all words which appear to require it.    CHAPTER II  Prometheus and Pandora  The Roman poet Ovid gives us a connected narrative of creation. Before the earth and sea and the all-covering heaven, one aspect, which we call Chaos, covered all the face of Nature,-- a rough heap of inert weight and discordant beginnings of things clashing together.  As yet no sun gave light to the world, nor did the moon renew her slender horn month by month,-- neither did the earth hang in the surrounding air, poised by its own weight,-- nor did the sea stretch its long arms around the earth.  Wherever there was earth, there was also sea and air.  So the earth was not solid nor was the water fluid, neither was the air transparent.  God and Nature at last interposed and put an end to this discord, separating earth from sea, and heaven from both.  The fiery part, being the lightest, sprang up, and formed the skies; the air was next in weight and place.  The earth, being heavier, sank below, and the water took the lowest place and buoyed up the earth.  Here some god, no man knows who, arranged and divided the land. He placed the rivers and bays, raised mountains and dug out valleys and distributed woods, fountains, fertile fields and stony plains.  Now that the air was clear the stars shone out, the fishes swam the sea and birds flew in the air, while the four-footed beasts roamed around the earth.  But a nobler animal was needed, and man was made in the image of the gods with an upright stature [The two Greek words for man have the root an, \"up], so that while all other animals turn their faces downward and look to the earth, he raises his face to heaven and gazes on the stars [Every reader will be interested in comparing this narrative with that in the beginning of Genesis.  It seems clear that so many Jews were in Rome in Ovid's days, many of whom were people of consideration among those with whom he lived, that he may have heard the account in the Hebrew Scriptures translated. Compare JUDAISM by Prof. Frederic Huidekoper.]  To Prometheus the Titan and to his brother Epimetheus was committed the task of making man and all other animals, and of endowing them with all needful faculties.  This Epimetheus did, and his brother overlooked the work.  Epimetheus then gave to the different animals their several gifts of courage, strength, swiftness and sagacity.  He gave wings to one, claws to another, a shelly covering to the third.  Man, superior to all other animals, came last.  But for man Epimetheus had nothing,-- he had bestowed all his gifts elsewhere.  He came to his brother for help, and Prometheus, with the aid of Minerva, went up to heaven, lighted his torch at the chariot of the sun, and brought down fire to man.  With this, man was more than equal to all other animals.  Fire enabled him to make weapons to subdue wild beasts, tools with which to till the earth.  With fire he warmed his dwelling and bid defiance to the cold.  Woman was not yet made.  The story is, that Jupiter made her, and sent her to Prometheus and his brother, to punish them for their presumption in stealing fire from heaven; and man, for accepting the gift.  The first woman was named Pandora.  She was made in heaven, every god contributing something to perfect her.  Venus gave her beauty, Mercury persuasion, Apollo music.  Thus equipped, she was conveyed to earth, and presented to Epimetheus, who gladly accepted her, though cautioned by his brother to beware of Jupiter and his gifts.  Epimetheus had in his house a jar, in which were kept certain noxious articles, for which, in fitting man for his new abode, he had had no occasion.  Pandora was seized with an eager curiosity to know what this jar contained; and one day she slipped off the cover and looked in. Forthwith there escaped a multitude of plagues for hapless man,-- such as gout, rheumatism, and colic for his body, and envy, spite, and revenge for his mind,-- and scattered themselves far and wide.  Pandora hastened to replace the lid; but, alas! The whole contents of the jar had escaped, one thing only excepted, which lay at the bottom, and that was HOPE.  So we see at this day, whatever evils are abroad, hope never entirely leaves us; and while we have THAT, no amount of other ills can make us completely wretched.  Another story is, that Pandora was sent in good faith, by Jupiter, to bless man; that she was furnished with a box, containing her marriage presents, into which every god had put some blessing.  She opened the box incautiously, and the blessings all escaped, HOPE only excepted.  This story seems more consistent than the former; for how could HOPE, so precious a jewel as it is, have been kept in a jar full of all manner of evils?  The world being thus furnished with inhabitants, the first age was an age of innocence and happiness, called the GOLDEN AGE. Truth and right prevailed, though not enforced by law, nor was there any"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],["title","Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#4)"],["body","to threaten or punish.  The forest had not yet been robbed of its trees to furnish timbers for vessels, nor had men built fortifications round their towns.  There were no such things as swords, spears, or helmets.  The earth brought forth all things necessary for man, without his labor in ploughing or sowing.  Perpetual spring reigned, flowers sprang up without seed, the rivers flowed with milk and wine, and yellow honey distilled from the oaks.    \"But when good Saturn, banished from above,   Was driven to hell, the world was under Jove.   Succeeding times a Silver Age behold,   Excelling brass, but more excelled by gold.   Then summer, autumn, winter did appear,   And spring was but a season of the year.   The sun his annual course obliquely made,   Good days contracted and enlarged the bad,   Then air, with sultry heats, began to glow;   The wings of winds were clogged with ice and sno   And shivering mortals into houses driven,   Sought shelter from the inclemency of heaven.   Those houses then were caves, or homely sheds;   With twining osiers fenced; and moss their beds.   Then ploughs, for seed, the fruitful furrows broke,   And oxen labored first beneath the yoke.   To this came next in course the Brazen Age:   A warlike offspring, prompt to bloody rage,   Not impious yet! . .   . . . Hard Steel succeeded then;   And stubborn as the metal were the men.\"   Ovid's Metam, Book I.  Dryden's Translation.  Crime burst in like a flood; modesty, truth, and honor fled.  In their places came fraud and cunning, violence, and the wicked love of gain.  Then seamen spread sails to the wind, and the trees were torn from the mountains to serve for keels to ships, and vex the face of ocean.  The earth, which till now had been cultivated in common, began to be divided off into possessions. Men were not satisfied with what the surface produced, but must dig into its bowels, and draw forth from thence the ores of metals.  Mischievous IRON, and more mischievous GOLD, were produced.  War sprang up, using both as weapons; the guest was not safe in his friend's house; and sons-in-law and fathers-in- law, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, could not trust one another.  Sons wished their fathers dead, that they might come to the inheritance; family love lay prostrate.  The earth was wet with slaughter, and the gods abandoned it, one by one, till Astraea [the goddess of innocence and purity.  After leaving earth, she was placed among the stars, where she became the constellation Virgo  The Virgin.  Themis (Justice) was the mother of Astraea.  She is represented as holding aloft a pair of scales, in which she weighs the claims of opposing parties.  It was a favorite idea of the old poets, that these goddesses would one day return, and bring back the Golden Age.  Even in a Christian Hymn, the Messiah of Pope, this idea occurs.    \"All crimes shall cease, and ancient fraud shall fail,   Returning Justice lift aloft her scale,   Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend,   And white-robed Innocence from heaven descend.\"  See, also,   Milton's Hymn on the nativity, stanzas xiv, and xv] alone was       left, and finally she also took her departure.  Jupiter, seeing this state of things, burned with anger.  He summoned the gods to council.  They obeyed the call, and took The road to the palace of heaven.  The road, which any one may see in a clear night, stretches across the face of the sky, and is called the Milky Way.  Along the road stand the palaces of the illustrious gods; the common people of the skies live apart, on either side.  Jupiter addressed the assembly.  He set forth the frightful condition of things on the earth, and closed by announcing his intention to destroy the whole of its inhabitants, and provide a new race, unlike the first, who would be more worthy of life, and much better worshippers of   the gods.  So saying he took a thunderbolt, and was about to launch it at the world, and destroy it by burning it; but recollecting the danger that such a conflagration might set heaven itself on fire, he changed his plan, and resolved to drown the world.  Aquilo, the north wind, which scatters the clouds, was chained up; Notus, the south, was sent out, and soon covered all the face of heaven with a cloak of pitchy darkness.  The clouds, driven together, resound with a crash; torrents of rain fall; the crops are laid low; the year's labor of the husbandman perishes in an hour.  Jupiter, not satisfied with his own waters, calls on his brother Neptune to aid him with his.  He lets loose the rivers, and pours them over the land.  At the same time, he heaves the land with an earthquake, and brings in the reflux of the ocean over the shores.  Flocks, herds, men, and houses are swept away, and temples, with their sacred enclosures, profaned.  If any edifice remained standing, it was overwhelmed, and its turrets lay hid beneath the waves.  Now all was sea; sea without shore.  Here and there some one remained on a projecting hill-top, and a few, in boats, pulled the oar where they had lately driven the plough. The fishes swim among the tree-tops; the anchor is let down into a garden.  Where the graceful lambs played but now, unwieldy sea- calves gambol.  The wolf swims among the sheep; the yellow lions and tigers struggle in the water.  The strength of the wild boar serves him not, nor his swiftness the stag.  The birds fall with weary wing into the water, having found no land for a resting place.  Those living beings whom the water spared fell a prey to hunger.  Parnassus alone, of all the mountains, overtopped the waves; and there Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha, of the race of Prometheus, found refuge   he a just man, and she a faithful worshipper of the gods.  Jupiter, when he saw none left alive but this pair, and remembered their harmless lives and pious demeanor, ordered the north winds to drive away the clouds, and disclose the skies to earth, and earth to the skies.  Neptune also directed Triton to blow on his shell, and sound a retreat to the waters.  The waters obeyed, and the sea returned to its shores, and the rivers to their channels.  Then Deucalion thus addressed Pyrrha: \"O wife, only surviving woman, joined to me first by the ties of kindred and marriage, and now by a common danger, would that we possessed the power of our ancestor Prometheus, and could renew the race as he at first made it!  But as we cannot, let us seek yonder temple, and inquire of the gods what remains for us to do.\"  They entered the temple, deformed as it was with slime, and approached the altar, where no fire burned.  There they fell prostrate on the earth, and prayed the goddess to inform them how they might retrieve their miserable affairs.  The oracle answered, \"Depart from the temple with head veiled and garments unbound, and cast behind you the bones of your mother.\"  They heard the words with astonishment.  Pyrrha first broke silence: \"We cannot obey; we dare not profane the remains of our parents.\" They sought the thickest shades of the wood, and revolved the oracle in their minds.  At length Deucalion spoke: \"Either my sagacity deceives me, or the command is one we may obey without impiety.  The earth is the great parent of all; the stones are her bones; these we may cast behind us; and I think this is what the oracle means.  At least, it will do no harm to try.\"  They veiled their faces, unbound their garments, and picked up stones, and cast them behind them.  The stones (wonderful to relate) began to grow soft, and assume shape.  By degrees, they put on a rude resemblance to the human form, like a block half finished in the hands of the sculptor.  The moisture and slime that were about them became flesh; the stony part became bones; the veins remained veins, retaining their name, only changing their use. Those thrown by the hand of the man became men, and those by the woman became women.  It was a hard race, and well adapted to labor, as we find ourselves to be at this day, giving plain indications of our origin.  The comparison of Eve to Pandora is too obvious to have escaped Milton, who introduces it in Book IV, of Paradise Lost:--    \"More lovely than Pandora, whom the gods   Endowed with all their gifts; and O, too like   In sad event, when to the unwiser son   Of Jupiter, brought by Hermes, she ensnared   Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged   On him who had stole Jove's authentic fire.\"  Prometheus and Epimetheus were sons of Iapetus, which Milton changes to Japhet.  Prometheus, the Titan son of Iapetus and Themis, is a favorite subject with the poets.  AEschylus wrote three tragedies on the subjects of his confinement, his release, and his worship at Athens.  Of these only the first is preserved, the Prometheus Bound.  Prometheus was the only one in the council of the gods who favored man.  He alone was kind to the human race, and taught and protected them.    \"I formed his mind,   And through the cloud of barbarous ignorance   Diffused the beams of knowledge . . . .   They saw indeed, they heard, but what availed   Or sight or hearing, all things round them rolling,   Like the unreal imagery of dreams   In wild confusion mixed!  The lightsome wall   Of finer masonry, the raftered roof   They knew not; but like ants still buried, delved   Deep in the earth and scooped their sunless caves.   Unmarked the seasons ranged, the biting winter,   The flower-perfumed spring, the ripening summer   Fertile of fruits.  At random all their works   Till I instructed them to mark the stars,   Their rising, and, a harder science yet,   Their setting.  The rich train of marshalled numbers   I taught them, and the meet array of letters.   To impress these precepts on their hearts I sent   Memory, the active mother of all reason.   I taught the patient steer to bear the yoke,   In all his toils joint-laborer of man.   By me the harnessed steed was trained to whirl   The rapid car, and grace the pride of wealth.   The tall bark,"]]]
