For long I have steered clear of this rock.  But at last I have reached it and must go over it, driven by my desire to chronicle the stirring events of pioneer days.  Even to-day it is not possible to travel into the remote corners of the West without seeing the lives of people still affected by a fighting past.  How can the truth be told about the pioneering of the West if the struggle, the fight, the blood be left out?  It cannot be done. How can a novel be stirring and thrilling, as were those times, unless it be full of sensation?  My long labors have been devoted to making stories resemble the times they depict.  I have loved the West for its vastness, its contrast, its beauty and color and life, for its wildness and violence, and for the fact that I have seen how it developed great men and women who died unknown and unsung.  In this materialistic age, this hard, practical, swift, greedy age of realism, it seems there is no place for writers of romance, no place for romance itself.  For many years all the events leading up to the great war were realistic, and the war itself was horribly realistic, and the aftermath is likewise.  Romance is only another name for idealism; and I contend that life without ideals is not worth living. Never in the history of the world were ideals needed so terribly as now.  Walter Scott wrote romance; so did Victor Hugo; and likewise Kipling, Hawthorne, Stevenson.  It was Stevenson, particularly, who wielded a bludgeon against the realists.  People live for the dream in their hearts.  And I have yet to know anyone who has not some secret dream, some hope, however dim, some storied wall to look at in the dusk, some painted window leading to the soul. How strange indeed to find that the realists have ideals and dreams! To read them one would think their lives held nothing significant. But they love, they hope, they dream, they sacrifice, they struggle on with that dream in their hearts just the same as others.  We all are dreamers, if not in the heavy-lidded wasting of time, then in the meaning of life that makes us work on.  It was Wordsworth who wrote, \"The world is too much with us\"; and if I could give the secret of my ambition as a novelist in a few words it would be contained in that quotation.  My inspiration to write has always come from nature.  Character and action are subordinated to setting.  In all that I have done I have tried to make people see how the world is too much with them.  Getting and spending they lay waste their powers, with never a breath of the free and wonderful life of the open!  So I come back to the main point of this foreword, in which I am trying to tell why and how I came to write the story of a feud notorious in Arizona as the Pleasant Valley War.  Some years ago Mr. Harry Adams, a cattleman of Vermajo Park, New Mexico, told me he had been in the Tonto Basin of Arizona and thought I might find interesting material there concerning this Pleasant Valley War. His version of the war between cattlemen and sheepmen certainly determined me to look over the ground.  My old guide, Al Doyle of Flagstaff, had led me over half of Arizona, but never down into that wonderful wild and rugged basin between the Mogollon Mesa and the Mazatzal Mountains.  Doyle had long lived on the frontier and his version of the Pleasant Valley War differed markedly from that of Mr. Adams.  I asked other old timers about it, and their remarks further excited my curiosity.  Once down there, Doyle and I found the wildest, most rugged, roughest, and most remarkable country either of us had visited; and the few inhabitants were like the country.  I went in ostensibly to hunt bear and lion and turkey, but what I really was hunting for was the story of that Pleasant Valley War.  I engaged the services of a bear hunter who had three strapping sons as reserved and strange and aloof as he was. No wheel tracks of any kind had ever come within miles of their cabin. I spent two wonderful months hunting game and reveling in the beauty and grandeur of that Rim Rock country, but I came out knowing no more about the Pleasant Valley War.  These Texans and their few neighbors, likewise from Texas, did not talk.  But all I saw and felt only inspired me the more.  This trip was in the fall of 1918.  The next year I went again with the best horses, outfit, and men the Doyles could provide.  And this time I did not ask any questions. But I rode horses--some of them too wild for me--and packed a rifle many a hundred miles, riding sometimes thirty and forty miles a day, and I climbed in and out of the deep canyons, desperately staying at the heels of one of those long-legged Texans.  I learned the life of those backwoodsmen, but I did not get the story of the Pleasant Valley War. I had, however, won the friendship of that hardy people.  In 1920 I went back with a still larger outfit, equipped to stay as long as I liked.  And this time, without my asking it, different natives of the Tonto came to tell me about the Pleasant Valley War. No two of them agreed on anything concerning it, except that only one of the active participants survived the fighting.  Whence comes my title, TO THE LAST MAN.  Thus I was swamped in a mass of material out of which I could only flounder to my own conclusion.  Some of the stories told me are singularly tempting to a novelist.  But, though I believe them myself, I cannot risk their improbability to those who have no idea of the wildness of wild men at a wild time.  There really was a terrible and bloody feud, perhaps the most deadly and least known in all the annals of the West.  I saw the ground, the cabins, the graves, all so darkly suggestive of what must have happened.  I never learned the truth of the cause of the Pleasant Valley War, or if I did hear it I had no means of recognizing it.  All the given causes were plausible and convincing.  Strange to state, there is still secrecy and reticence all over the Tonto Basin as to the facts of this feud.  Many descendents of those killed are living there now. But no one likes to talk about it.  Assuredly many of the incidents told me really occurred, as, for example, the terrible one of the two women, in the face of relentless enemies, saving the bodies of their dead husbands from being devoured by wild hogs.  Suffice it to say that this romance is true to my conception of the war, and I base it upon the setting I learned to know and love so well, upon the strange passions of primitive people, and upon my instinctive reaction to the facts and rumors that I gathered.  ZANE GREY.   AVALON, CALIFORNIA,     April, 1921    CHAPTER I  At the end of a dry, uphill ride over barren country Jean Isbel unpacked to camp at the edge of the cedars where a little rocky canyon green with willow and cottonwood, promised water and grass.  His animals were tired, especially the pack mule that had carried a heavy load; and with slow heave of relief they knelt and rolled in the dust.  Jean experienced something of relief himself as he threw off his chaps.  He had not been used to hot, dusty, glaring days on the barren lands.  Stretching his long length beside a tiny rill of clear water that tinkled over the red stones, he drank thirstily. The water was cool, but it had an acrid taste--an alkali bite that he did not like. Not since he had left Oregon had he tasted clear, sweet, cold water; and he missed it just as he longed for the stately shady forests he had loved.  This wild, endless Arizona land bade fair to earn his hatred.  By the time he had leisurely completed his tasks twilight had fallen and coyotes had begun their barking.  Jean listened to the yelps and to the moan of the cool wind in the cedars with a sense of satisfaction that these lonely sounds were familiar.  This cedar wood burned into a pretty fire and the smell of its smoke was newly pleasant.  \"Reckon maybe I'll learn to like Arizona,\" he mused, half aloud. \"But I've a hankerin' for waterfalls an' dark-green forests. Must be the Indian in me.... Anyway, dad needs me bad, an' I reckon I'm here for keeps.\"  Jean threw some cedar branches on the fire, in the light of which he opened his father's letter, hoping by repeated reading to grasp more of its strange portent.  It had been two months in reaching him, coming by traveler, by stage and train, and then by boat, and finally by stage again.  Written in lead pencil on a leaf torn from an old ledger, it would have been hard to read even if the writing had been more legible.  \"Dad's writin' was always bad, but I never saw it so shaky,\" said Jean, thinking aloud.      GRASS VALLY, ARIZONA.     Son Jean,--Come home.  Here is your home and here your needed.    When we left Oregon we all reckoned you would not be long behind.    But its years now.  I am growing old, son, and you was always my    steadiest boy.  Not that you ever was so dam steady.  Only your    wildness seemed more for the woods.  You take after mother, and    your brothers Bill and Guy take after me.  That is the red and    white of it.  Your part Indian, Jean, and that Indian I reckon    I am going to need bad.  I am rich in cattle and horses.  And my    range here is the best I ever seen.  Lately we have been losing    stock.  But that is not all nor so bad.  Sheepmen have moved into    the Tonto and are grazing down on Grass Vally.  Cattlemen and    sheepmen can never bide in this country.  We have bad times ahead.    Reckon I have more reasons to worry and need you, but you must wait    to hear that by word of mouth.  Whatever your doing, chuck it and    rustle for Grass Vally so to make here by spring.  I am asking you    to take pains to pack in some guns and a lot of shells.  And hide    them in your outfit.  If you meet anyone when your coming down into    the Tonto, listen more"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2070"],["title","To the Last Man (#1)"],["body","you talk.  And last, son, dont let    anything keep you in Oregon.  Reckon you have a sweetheart, and    if so fetch her along.  With love from your dad,     GASTON ISBEL.   Jean pondered over this letter.  Judged by memory of his father, who had always been self-sufficient, it had been a surprise and somewhat of a shock.  Weeks of travel and reflection had not helped him to grasp the meaning between the lines.  \"Yes, dad's growin' old,\" mused Jean, feeling a warmth and a sadness stir in him.  \"He must be 'way over sixty.  But he never looked old.... So he's rich now an' losin' stock, an' goin' to be sheeped off his range.  Dad could stand a lot of rustlin', but not much from sheepmen.\"  The softness that stirred in Jean merged into a cold, thoughtful earnestness which had followed every perusal of his father's letter. A dark, full current seemed flowing in his veins, and at times he felt it swell and heat.  It troubled him, making him conscious of a deeper, stronger self, opposed to his careless, free, and dreamy nature.  No ties had bound him in Oregon, except love for the great, still forests and the thundering rivers; and this love came from his softer side.  It had cost him a wrench to leave.  And all the way by ship down the coast to San Diego and across the Sierra Madres by stage, and so on to this last overland travel by horseback, he had felt a retreating of the self that was tranquil and happy and a dominating of this unknown somber self, with its menacing possibilities.  Yet despite a nameless regret and a loyalty to Oregon, when he lay in his blankets he had to confess a keen interest in his adventurous future, a keen enjoyment of this stark, wild Arizona.  It appeared to be a different sky stretching in dark, star-spangled dome over him--closer, vaster, bluer.  The strong fragrance of sage and cedar floated over him with the camp-fire smoke, and all seemed drowsily to subdue his thoughts.  At dawn he rolled out of his blankets and, pulling on his boots, began the day with a zest for the work that must bring closer his calling future.  White, crackling frost and cold, nipping air were the same keen spurs to action that he had known in the uplands of Oregon, yet they were not wholly the same.  He sensed an exhilaration similar to the effect of a strong, sweet wine.  His horse and mule had fared well during the night, having been much refreshed by the grass and water of the little canyon.  Jean mounted and rode into the cedars with gladness that at last he had put the endless leagues of barren land behind him.  The trail he followed appeared to be seldom traveled.  It led, according to the meager information obtainable at the last settlement, directly to what was called the Rim, and from there Grass Valley could be seen down in the Basin.  The ascent of the ground was so gradual that only in long, open stretches could it be seen.  But the nature of the vegetation showed Jean how he was climbing.  Scant, low, scraggy cedars gave place to more numerous, darker, greener, bushier ones, and these to high, full-foliaged, green-berried trees.  Sage and grass in the open flats grew more luxuriously.  Then came the pinyons, and presently among them the checker-barked junipers.  Jean hailed the first pine tree with a hearty slap on the brown, rugged bark.  It was a small dwarf pine struggling to live.  The next one was larger, and after that came several, and beyond them pines stood up everywhere above the lower trees.  Odor of pine needles mingled with the other dry smells that made the wind pleasant to Jean.  In an hour from the first line of pines he had ridden beyond the cedars and pinyons into a slowly thickening and deepening forest.  Underbrush appeared scarce except in ravines, and the ground in open patches held a bleached grass. Jean's eye roved for sight of squirrels, birds, deer, or any moving creature. It appeared to be a dry, uninhabited forest.  About midday Jean halted at a pond of surface water, evidently melted snow, and gave his animals a drink.  He saw a few old deer tracks in the mud and several huge bird tracks new to him which he concluded must have been made by wild turkeys.  The trail divided at this pond.  Jean had no idea which branch he ought to take.  \"Reckon it doesn't matter,\" he muttered, as he was about to remount.  His horse was standing with ears up, looking back along the trail.  Then Jean heard a clip-clop of trotting hoofs, and presently espied a horseman.  Jean made a pretense of tightening his saddle girths while he peered over his horse at the approaching rider.  All men in this country were going to be of exceeding interest to Jean Isbel.  This man at a distance rode and looked like all the Arizonians Jean had seen, he had a superb seat in the saddle, and he was long and lean.  He wore a huge black sombrero and a soiled red scarf.  His vest was open and he was without a coat.  The rider came trotting up and halted several paces from Jean  \"Hullo, stranger!\" he said, gruffly.  \"Howdy yourself!\" replied Jean.  He felt an instinctive importance in the meeting with the man.  Never had sharper eyes flashed over Jean and his outfit.  He had a dust-colored, sun-burned face, long, lean, and hard, a huge sandy mustache that hid his mouth, and eyes of piercing light intensity.  Not very much hard Western experience had passed by this man, yet he was not old, measured by years. When he dismounted Jean saw he was tall, even for an Arizonian.  \"Seen your tracks back a ways,\" he said, as he slipped the bit to let his horse drink.  \"Where bound?\"  \"Reckon I'm lost, all right,\" replied Jean.  \"New country for me.\"  \"Shore.  I seen thet from your tracks an' your last camp.  Wal, where was you headin' for before you got lost?\"  The query was deliberately cool, with a dry, crisp ring.  Jean felt the lack of friendliness or kindliness in it.  \"Grass Valley.  My name's Isbel,\" he replied, shortly.  The rider attended to his drinking horse and presently rebridled him; then with long swing of leg he appeared to step into the saddle.  \"Shore I knowed you was Jean Isbel,\" he said.  \"Everybody in the Tonto has heerd old Gass Isbel sent fer his boy.\"  \"Well then, why did you ask?\" inquired Jean, bluntly.  \"Reckon I wanted to see what you'd say.\"  \"So?  All right.  But I'm not carin' very much for what YOU say.\"  Their glances locked steadily then and each measured the other by the intangible conflict of spirit.  \"Shore thet's natural,\" replied the rider.  His speech was slow, and the motions of his long, brown hands, as he took a cigarette from his vest, kept time with his words.  \"But seein' you're one of the Isbels, I'll hev my say whether you want it or not.  My name's Colter an' I'm one of the sheepmen Gass Isbel's riled with.\"  \"Colter.  Glad to meet you,\" replied Jean.  \"An' I reckon who riled my father is goin' to rile me.\"  \"Shore.  If thet wasn't so you'd not be an Isbel,\" returned Colter, with a grim little laugh.  \"It's easy to see you ain't run into any Tonto Basin fellers yet.  Wal, I'm goin' to tell you thet your old man gabbed like a woman down at Greaves's store.  Bragged aboot you an' how you could fight an' how you could shoot an' how you could track a hoss or a man!  Bragged how you'd chase every sheep herder back up on the Rim.... I'm tellin' you because we want you to git our stand right. We're goin' to run sheep down in Grass Valley.\"  \"Ahuh!  Well, who's we?\" queried Jean, curtly.  \"What-at? ... We--I mean the sheepmen rangin' this Rim from Black Butte to the Apache country.\"  \"Colter, I'm a stranger in Arizona,\" said Jean, slowly.  \"I know little about ranchers or sheepmen.  It's true my father sent for me.  It's true, I dare say, that he bragged, for he was given to bluster an' blow. An' he's old now.  I can't help it if he bragged about me.  But if he has, an' if he's justified in his stand against you sheepmen, I'm goin' to do my best to live up to his brag.\"  \"I get your hunch.  Shore we understand each other, an' thet's a powerful help.  You take my hunch to your old man,\" replied Colter, as he turned his horse away toward the left.  \"Thet trail leadin' south is yours.  When you come to the Rim you'll see a bare spot down in the Basin.  Thet 'll be Grass Valley.\"  He rode away out of sight into the woods.  Jean leaned against his horse and pondered.  It seemed difficult to be just to this Colter, not because of his claims, but because of a subtle hostility that emanated from him.  Colter had the hard face, the masked intent, the turn of speech that Jean had come to associate with dishonest men. Even if Jean had not been prejudiced, if he had known nothing of his father's trouble with these sheepmen, and if Colter had met him only to exchange glances and greetings, still Jean would never have had a favorable impression.  Colter grated upon him, roused an antagonism seldom felt.  \"Heigho!\" sighed the young man, \"Good-by to huntin' an' fishing'! Dad's given me a man's job.\"  With that he mounted his horse and started the pack mule into the right-hand trail.  Walking and trotting, he traveled all afternoon, toward sunset getting into heavy forest of pine.  More than one snow bank showed white through the green, sheltered on the north slopes of shady ravines.  And it was upon entering this zone of richer, deeper forestland that Jean sloughed off his gloomy forebodings.  These stately pines were not the giant firs of Oregon, but any lover of the woods could be happy under them.  Higher still he climbed until the forest spread before and around him like a level park, with thicketed ravines here and there on each side.  And presently that deceitful level led to a higher bench upon which the pines towered, and were matched by beautiful trees he took for spruce.  Heavily barked, with regular spreading branches, these conifers rose in symmetrical shape to spear the sky with silver plumes.  A graceful gray-green moss, waved like veils from the branches.  The air was not so"]]]
