Commodore Shatrak, see to it that Colonel Ravney has them in the Convocation Chamber, and that preparations in the room are made, so that we may address them in the dignity befitting representatives of his Imperial Majesty.\" He turned to the Adityan slaves. \"That is all. You have permission to go.\"  They watched the delegation back out, with the honor-guard following. When the doors had closed behind them, Shatrak ran his hand over his bald head and laughed.  \"Shaved heads, every one of them. That's probably why they thought I was your slave. Bet those gorgets are servile badges, too.\" He touched the Knight's Star of the Order of the Empire at his throat. \"Probably thought that was what this was. We would have to draw something like this!\"  \"They simply can't imagine anybody not being either a slave or a slave-owner,\" Erskyll was saying. \"That must mean that there is no free non-slave-holding class at all. Universal slavery! Well, we'll have to do something about that. Proclaim total emancipation, immediately.\"  \"Oh, no; we can't do anything like that. The Constitution won't permit us to. Section Two, Article One: _Every Empire planet shall be self-governed as to its own affairs, in the manner of its own choice, and without interference._\"  \"But slavery.... Section Two, Article Six,\" Erskyll objected. \"_There shall be no chattel slavery or serfdom anywhere in the Empire; no sapient being of any race whatsoever shall be the property of any being but himself._\"  \"That's correct,\" he agreed. \"If this Mastership intends to remain the planetary government under the Empire, they will be obliged to abolish slavery, but they will have to do it by their own act. We cannot do it for them.\"  \"You know what I'd do, Prince Trevannion?\" Shatrak said. \"I'd just heave this Mastership thing out, and set up a nice tight military dictatorship. We have the planet under martial rule now; let's just keep it that way for about five years, till we can train a new government.\"  That suggestion seemed to pain Count Erskyll almost as much as the existing situation.         *       *       *       *       *  They dined late, in Commodore Shatrak's private dining room. Beside Shatrak, Erskyll and himself, there were Lanze Degbrend, and Count Erskyll's charge-d'affaires, Sharll Ernanday, and Patrique Morvill and Pyairr Ravney and the naval intelligence officer, Commander Andrey Douvrin. Ordinarily, he deplored serious discussion at meals, but under the circumstances it was unavoidable; nobody could think or talk of anything else. The discussion which he had hoped would follow the meal began before the soup-course.  \"We have a total population of about twenty million,\" Lanze Degbrend reported. \"A trifle over ten thousand Masters, all ages and both sexes. The remainder are all slaves.\"  \"I find that incredible,\" Erskyll declared promptly. \"Twenty million people, held in slavery by ten thousand! Why do they stand for it? Why don't they rebel?\"  \"Well, I can think of three good reasons,\" Douvrin said. \"Three square meals a day.\"  [Illustration]  \"And no responsibilities; no need to make decisions,\" Degbrend added. \"They've been slaves for seven and a half centuries. They don't even know the meaning of freedom, and it would frighten them if they did.\"  \"Chain of command,\" Shatrak said. When that seemed not to convey any meaning to Erskyll, he elaborated: \"We have a lot of dirty-necked working slaves. Over every dozen of them is an overseer with a big whip and a stungun. Over every couple of overseers there is a guard with a submachine gun. Over them is a supervisor, who doesn't need a gun because he can grab a handphone and call for troops. Over the supervisors, there are higher supervisors. Everybody has it just enough better than the level below him that he's afraid of losing his job and being busted back to fieldhand.\"  \"That's it exactly, Commodore,\" Degbrend said. \"The whole society is a slave hierarchy. Everybody curries favor with the echelon above, and keeps his eye on the echelon below to make sure he isn't being undercut. We have something not too unlike that, ourselves. Any organizational society is, in some ways, like a slave society. And everything is determined by established routine. The whole thing has simply been running on momentum for at least five centuries, and if we hadn't come smashing in with a situation none of the routines covered, it would have kept on running for another five, till everything wore out and stopped. I heard about those missile-stations, by the way. They're typical of everything here.\"  \"That's another thing,\" Erskyll interrupted. \"These Lords-Master are the descendants of the old Space-Vikings, and the slaves of the original inhabitants. The Space Vikings were a technologically advanced people; they had all the old Terran Federation science and technology, and a lot they developed for themselves on the Sword-Worlds.\"  \"Well? They still had a lot of it, on the Sword-Worlds, two centuries ago when we took them over.\"  \"But technology always drives out slavery; that's a fundamental law of socio-economics. Slavery is economically unsound; it cannot compete with power-industry, let alone cybernetics and robotics.\"  He was tempted to remind young Obray of Erskyll that there were no such things as fundamental laws of socio-economics; merely usually reliable generalized statements of what can more or less be depended upon to happen under most circumstances. He resisted the temptation. Count Erskyll had had enough shocks, today, without adding to them by gratuitous blasphemy.  \"In this case, Obray, it worked in reverse. The Space Vikings enslaved the Adityans to hold them in subjugation. That was a politico-military necessity. Then, being committed to slavery, with a slave population who had to be made to earn their keep, they found cybernetics and robotics economically unsound.\"  \"And almost at once, they began appointing slave overseers, and the technicians would begin training slave assistants. Then there would be slave supervisors to direct the overseers, slave administrators to direct them, slave secretaries and bookkeepers, slave technicians and engineers.\"  \"How about the professions, Lanze?\"  \"All slave. Slave physicians, teachers, everything like that. All the Masters are taught by slaves; the slaves are educated by apprenticeship. The courts are in the hands of slaves; cases are heard by the chief slaves of judges who don't even know where their own courtrooms are; every Master has a team of slave lawyers. Most of the lawsuits are estate-inheritance cases; some of them have been in litigation for generations.\"  \"What do the Lords-Master do?\" Shatrak asked.  \"Masterly things,\" Degbrend replied. \"I was only down there since noon, but from what I could find out, that consists of feasting, making love to each other's wives, being entertained by slave performers, and feuding for social precedence like wealthy old ladies on Odin.\"  \"You got this from the slaves? How did you get them to talk, Lanze?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Degbrend and Ravney exchanged amused glances. Ravney said:  \"Well, I detailed a sergeant and six privates to accompany Honorable Degbrend,\" Ravney said. \"They.... How would you put it, Lanze?\"  \"I asked a slave a question. If he refused to answer, somebody knocked him down with a rifle-butt,\" Degbrend replied. \"I never had to do that more than once in any group, and I only had to do it three times in all. After that, when I asked questions, I was answered promptly and fully. It is surprising how rapidly news gets around the Citadel.\"  \"You mean you had those poor slaves beaten?\" Erskyll demanded.  \"Oh, no. Beating implies repeated blows. We only gave one to a customer; that was enough.\"  \"Well, how about the army, if that's what those people in the long red-brown coats were?\" Shatrak changed the subject by asking Ravney.  \"All slave, of course, officers and all. What will we do about them, sir? I have about three thousand, either confined to their barracks or penned up in the Citadel. I requisitioned food for them, paid for it in chits. There were a few isolated companies and platoons that gave us something of a fight; most of them just threw away their weapons and bawled for quarter. I've segregated the former; with your approval, I'll put them under Imperial officers and noncoms for a quickie training in our tactics, and then use them to train the rest.\"  \"Do that, Pyairr. We only have two thousand men of our own, and that's not enough. Do you think you can make soldiers out of any of them?\"  \"Yes, I believe so, sir. They are trained, organized and armed for civil-order work, which is what we'll need them for ourselves. In the entire history of this army, all they have done has been to overawe unarmed slaves; I am sure they have never been in combat with regular troops. They have an elaborate set of training and field regulations for the sort of work for which they were intended. What they encountered today was entirely outside those regulations, which is why they behaved as they did.\"  \"Did you have any trouble getting cooperation from the native officers?\" Shatrak asked.  \"Not in the least. They cooperated quite willingly, if not always too intelligently. I simply told them that they were now the personal property of his Imperial Majesty, Rodrik III. They were quite flattered by the change of ownership. If ordered to, I believe that they would fire on their former Lords-Master without hesitation.\"  \"You told those slaves that they ... _belonged_ ... to the _Emperor_?\"  Count Erskyll was aghast. He stared at Ravney for an instant, then snatched up his brandy-glass--the meal had gotten to that point--and drained it at a gulp. The others watched solicitously while he coughed and spluttered over it.  \"Commodore Shatrak,\" he said sternly. \"I hope that you will take severe disciplinary action; this is the most outrageous....\" "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20726"],["title","A Slave is a Slave (#4)"],["body"," \"I'll do nothing of the sort,\" Shatrak retorted. \"The colonel is to be commended; did the best thing he could, under the circumstances. What are you going to do when slavery is abolished here, Colonel?\"  \"Oh, tell them that they have been given their freedom as a special reward for meritorious service, and then sign them up for a five year enlistment.\"  \"That might work. Again, it might not.\"  \"I think, Colonel, that before you do that, you had better disarm them again. You might possibly have some trouble, otherwise.\"  Ravney looked at him sharply. \"They might not want to be free? I'd thought of that.\"  \"Nonsense!\" Erskyll declared. \"Who ever heard of slaves rebelling against freedom?\"  Freedom was a Good Thing. It was a Good Thing for everybody, everywhere and all the time. Count Erskyll knew it, because freedom was a Good Thing for him.  He thought, suddenly, of an old tomcat belonging to a lady of his acquaintance at Paris-on-Baldur, a most affectionate cat, who insisted on catching mice and bringing them as presents to all his human friends. To this cat's mind, it was inconceivable that anybody would not be most happy to receive a nice fresh-killed mouse.  \"Too bad we have to set any of them free,\" Vann Shatrak said. \"Too bad we can't just issue everybody new servile gorgets marked, _Personal Property of his Imperial Majesty_ and let it go at that. But I guess we can't.\"  \"Commodore Shatrak, you are joking,\" Erskyll began.  \"I hope I am,\" Shatrak replied grimly.         *       *       *       *       *  The top landing-stage of the Citadel grew and filled the forward viewscreen of the ship's launch. It was only when he realized that the tiny specks were people, and the larger, birdseed-sized, specks vehicles, that the real size of the thing was apparent. Obray of Erskyll, beside him, had been silent. He had been looking at the crescent-shaped industrial city, like a servile gorget around Zeggensburg's neck.  \"The way they've been crowded together!\" he said. \"And the buildings; no space between. And all that smoke! They must be using fossil-fuel!\"  \"It's probably too hard to process fissionables in large quantities, with what they have.\"  \"You were right, last evening. These people have deliberately halted progress, even retrogressed, rather than give up slavery.\"  Halting progress, to say nothing of retrogression, was an unthinkable crime to him. Like freedom, progress was a Good Thing, anywhere, at all times, and without regard to direction.  Colonel Ravney met them when they left the launch. The top landing-stage was swarming with Imperial troops.  \"Convocation Chamber's three stages down,\" he said. \"About two thousand of them there now; been coming in all morning. We have everything set up.\" He laughed. \"They tell me slaves are never permitted to enter it. Maybe, but they have the place bugged to the ceiling all around.\"  \"Bugged? What with?\" Shatrak asked, and Erskyll was wanting to know what he meant. No doubt he thought Ravney was talking about things crawling out of the woodwork.  \"Screen pickups, radio pickups, wired microphones; you name it and it's there. I'll bet every slave in the Citadel knows everything that happens in there while it's happening.\"  Shatrak wanted to know if he had done anything about them. Ravney shook his head.  \"If that's how they want to run a government, that's how they have a right to run it. Commander Douvrin put in a few of our own, a little better camouflaged than theirs.\"  There were more troops on the third stage down. They formed a procession down a long empty hallway, a few scared-looking slaves peeping from doorways at them. There were more troops where the corridor ended in great double doors, emblazoned with a straight broad-sword diagonally across an eight-pointed star. Emblematology of planets conquered by the Space Vikings always included swords and stars. An officer gave a signal; the doors started to slide apart, and within, from a screen-speaker, came a fanfare of trumpets.  At first, all he could see was the projection-screen, far ahead, and the tessellated aisle stretching toward it. The trumpets stopped, and they advanced, and then he saw the Lords-Master.  They were massed, standing among benches on either side, and if anything Pyairr Ravney had understated their numbers. They all wore black, trimmed with gold; he wondered if the coincidence that these were also the Imperial colors might be useful. Queer garments, tightly fitted tunics at the top which became flowing robes below the waist, deeply scalloped at the edges. The sleeves were exaggeratedly wide; a knife or a pistol, and not necessarily a small one, could be concealed in every one. He was sure that thought had entered Vann Shatrak's mind. They were armed, not with dress-daggers, but with swords; long, straight cross-hilted broadswords. They were the first actual swords he had ever seen, except in museums or on the stage.  There was a bench of gold and onyx at the front, where, normally the seven-man Presidium sat, and in front of it were thronelike seats for the Chiefs of Managements, equivalent to the Imperial Council of Ministers. Because of the projection screen that had been installed, they had all been moved to an improvised dais on the left. There was another dais on the right, under a canopy of black and gold velvet, emblazoned with the gold sun and superimposed black cogwheel of the Empire. There were three thrones, for himself, Shatrak, and Erskyll, and a number of lesser but still imposing chairs for their staffs.         *       *       *       *       *  They took their seats. He slipped the earplug of his memophone into his left ear and pressed the stud in the middle of his Grand Star of the Order of Odin. The memophone began giving him the names of the Presidium and of the Chiefs of Managements. He wondered how many upper-slaves had been gunbutted to produce them.  \"Lords and Gentlemen,\" he said, after he had greeted them and introduced himself and the others, \"I speak to you in the name of his Imperial Majesty, Rodrik III. His Majesty will now greet you in his own voice, by recording.\"  He pressed a button on the arm of his chair. The screen lighted, flickered, and steadied, and the trumpets blared again. When the fanfare ended, a voice thundered:  \"_The Emperor speaks!_\"  Rodrik III compromised on the beard question with a small mustache. He wore the stern but kindly expression the best theatrical directors in Asgard had taught him; Public Face Number Three. He inclined his head slightly and stiffly, as a man wearing a seven-pound crown must.  \"We greet our subjects of Aditya to the fellowship of the Empire. We have long had good reports of you, and we are happy now to speak to you. Deserve well of us, and prosper under the Sun and Cogwheel.\"  Another fanfare, as the image vanished. Before any of the Lords-Master could find voice, he was speaking to them:  \"Well, Lords and Gentlemen, you have been welcomed into the Empire by his Majesty. I know, there hasn't been a ship in or out of this system for five centuries, and I suppose you have a great many questions to ask about the Galactic Empire. Members of the Presidium and Chiefs of Managements may address me directly; others will please address the chairman.\"  Olvir Nikkolon, the owner of Tchall Hozhet, was on his feet at once. He had a loose-lipped mouth and a not entirely straight nose and pale eyes that were never entirely still.  \"What I want to know is; why did you people have to come here to take our planet away from us? Isn't the rest of the Galaxy big enough for you?\"  \"No, Lord Nikkolon. The Galaxy is not big enough for any competition of sovereignty. There must be one and only one completely sovereign power. The Terran Federation was once such a power. It failed, and vanished; you know what followed. Darkness and anarchy. We are clawing our way up out of that darkness. We will not fail. We will create a peaceful and unified Galaxy.\"  He talked to them, about the collapse of the old Federation, about the interstellar wars, about the Neobarbarians, about the long night. He told them how the Empire had risen on a few planets five thousand light-years away, and how it had spread.  \"We will not repeat the mistakes of the Terran Federation. We will not attempt to force every planetary government into a common pattern, or dictate the ways in which they govern themselves. We will foster in every way peaceful trade and communication. But we will not again permit the plague of competing sovereignties, the condition under which war is inevitable. The first attempt to set up such a sovereignty in competition with the Empire will be crushed mercilessly, and no planet inhabited by any sapient race will be permitted to remain outside the Empire.  \"Lords and Gentlemen, permit me to show you a little of what we have already accomplished, in the past three hundred years.\"  He pressed another button. The screen flickered, and the show started. It lasted for almost two hours; he used a handphone to interject comments and explanations. He showed them planet after planet--Marduk, where the Empire had begun, Baldur, Vishnu, Belphegor, Morglay, whence their ancestors had come, Amaterasu, Irminsul, Fafnir, finally Odin, the Imperial Planet. He showed towering cities swarming with aircars; spaceports where the huge globes of interstellar ships landed and lifted out; farms and industries; vast crowds at public celebrations; troop-reviews and naval bases and fleet-maneuvers; historical views of the battles that had created Imperial power.  \"That, Lords and Gentlemen, is what you have an opportunity to bring your planet into. If you accept, you will continue to rule Aditya under the Empire. If you refuse, you will only put us to the inconvenience of replacing you with a new planetary government, which will be annoying for us and, probably, fatal for you.\"  Nobody said anything for a few minutes. Then Rovard Javasan, the Chief of"]]]
