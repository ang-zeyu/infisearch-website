Howard exerted himself bravely then, and did all he could to rally the fugitives; but Rodes' division, which attacked him, was soon reinforced by that of Colston, and the two together folded around his flanks, took his line in reverse, and finally carried the position with a rush; and then Buschbeck's brigade retired in good order through the flying crowd, who were streaming in wild disorder to the rear past Hooker's headquarters.  And now, with the right of our line all gone, with a yawning gap where Sickles' corps and Williams' division had previously been posted, with Lee thundering against the centre and left, and Jackson taking all our defences in reverse, his first line being close on Chancellorsville itself, it seemed as if the total rout of the army was inevitable.  Just before this attack, Hooker had decided to interpose more force between the wings of the rebel army, in order to permanently dissever Jackson from the main body.  If Sickles had been allowed to attack the left flank of the enemy opposite the Furnace, as he requested permission to do earlier in the afternoon, this co-operative movement could hardly have failed to produce great results; afterward it was too late to attempt it.  As already stated, Williams' division struck Anderson in front on Birney's left, and Geary attacked McLaws across the Plank Road to the right of Hancock.  Geary found the enemy strongly posted, and as he made no progress, returned to his works.  When the rout of the Eleventh Corps took place, Williams also hastened back, but was fired upon by Jackson's troops, who now occupied the intrenchments he had left.  Sickles thinks if this had not occurred several regiments of the enemy would have been cut off from the main body.    CHAPTER V. JACKSON'S ADVANCE IS CHECKED.  The constantly increasing uproar, and the wild rush of fugitives past the Chancellorsville House, told Hooker what had occurred, and roused him to convulsive life.  His staff charged on the flying crowd, but failed to stop them, and it became necessary to form a line of fresh troops speedily, as Jackson was sweeping everything before him.  It was not easy to find an adequate force for this emergency.  The whole line was now actively engaged, Slocum being attacked on the south, and Couch and Meade on the east.  Fortunately, Berry's division was held in reserve, and was available.  They were true and tried men, and went forward at once to the rescue.  Berry was directed to form across the Plank Road, drive the rebels back, and retake the lost intrenchments; an order easy to give, but very difficult to execute.  The most he could do, under the circumstances, was to form his line in the valley opposite Fairview, and hold his position there, the enemy already having possession of the higher ground beyond.  Before Berry went out, Warren had stopped several of the Eleventh Corps batteries, and had formed them across the Plank Road, behind the position of the infantry.  Winslow's Battery D, of the 1st New York, and Dimick's Battery H, of the 1st United States, were already there, with Hooker in person, having anticipated the movement. These guns were very destructive, and were the principal agent in checking the enemy.  As soon as they had formed in line, Warren gave orders to Colonel Best, Chief of Artillery to the Twelfth Corps, to post more batteries on the eminence called Fairview, to the rear and left of the others.  Few persons appreciate the steadiness and courage required, when all around is in flight and confusion, for a force to advance steadily to the post of danger in front and meet the exulting enemy. Such men are heroes, and far more worthy of honor than those who fight in the full blaze of successful warfare.  The thickets being unfavorable to cavalry, Sickles had sent Pleasonton back to Hazel Grove with two mounted regiments, the 8th and 17th Pennsylvania and Martin's battery, while the 6th New York was scouting the woods on his right, dismounted.  Upon reaching the open space which he had left when he went to the front, Pleasonton found the place full of the debris of the combat--men, horses, caissons, ambulances--all hurrying furiously to the rear.  To close the way he charged on the flying mass, at Sickles' suggestion, who had ridden in advance of his troops, which were still behind at the Furnace.  Sickles ordered Pleasonton to take command of the artillery, and the latter took charge of twenty-two guns, consisting of his own and the Third Corps batteries.  The latter had already been rallied and formed in line by Captain J. F. Huntington, of the Ohio battery.  As senior officer present he assumed command of the Third Corps artillery.  Unfortunately there was not time to load or aim, for the rebels were close at hand, and their triumphant yells were heard as they took possession of the works which Buschbeck had so gallantly defended.  This advantageous position, which was on an eminence overlooking Chancellorsville and the Plank Road, and which was really the key of the battle-field, was about to be lost.  There was but one way to delay Jackson, some force must be sacrificed, and Pleasonton ordered Major Peter Keenan, commanding the 8th Pennsylvania Cavalry, to charge the ten thousand men in front with his four hundred.  Keenan saw in a moment that if he threw his little force into that seething mass of infantry, horses and men would go down on all sides, and few would be left to tell the tale.  A sad smile lit up his noble countenance as he said, _\"General, I will do it.\"_  Thus, at thirty-four years of age, he laid down his life, literally impaled on the bayonets of the enemy, saving the army from capture and his country from the unutterable degradation of slave-holding rule in the Northern States.  The service rendered on that occasion is worthy to be recorded in history with the sacrifices of Arthur Winckelried in Switzerland, and the Chevalier d'Assas in France.*  [* Major J. R. Carpenter, one of the officers who headed this charge, asserts that Keenan made it without orders, his only instructions being to report to General Howard to assist in rallying the Eleventh Corps.  Pleasonton's testimony, however, is positive on the subject, and is supported by that of his aide, Colonel Clifford Thompson.  Perhaps Carpenter did not hear all the conversation that passed between Pleasonton and Keenan.]  A large part of his command were lost, but the short interval thus gained was of priceless value.  Pleasonton was enabled to clear a space in front of him, and twenty-two guns, loaded with double canister, were brought to bear upon the enemy.  They came bursting over the parapet they had just taken with loud and continuous yells, and formed line of battle within three hundred yards.  All his guns fired into their masses at once.  The discharge seemed fairly to blow them back over the works from which they had just emerged. Their artillery, under Colonel Crutchfield, which had been brought up, was almost annihilated by the fire of the battery on the Plank Road.  This gave time to reload the guns.  The enemy rallied and opened a furious musketry fire from the woods against Pleasonton and Berry.  Both stood firm, and then came two charges in succession which reached almost to the muzzles of Pleasonton's guns, which were only supported by two small regiments of cavalry--the 6th New York, and a new and untried regiment, the 17th Pennsylvania.  The whole did not amount to over 1,000 men. Archer's brigade, on Jackson's left, which had not been stayed by Keenan's charge, gained the woods and the Plank Road, and opened a severe enfilading fire.  Huntington changed front with his own battery and repelled the assault.  The 110th Pennsylvania regiment, of Whipple's division, arrived in time to strengthen the cavalry support, and many of the Eleventh Corps men fell into line also. The last charge of the enemy was baffled by the opportune arrival of Birney's and Whipple's divisions, and Barlow's brigade.  By this time, too (about 9 P.M.), Hays' brigade of French's corps had been posted on the right, in rear and oblique to Berry's second line.  The latter had greatly strengthened his position with log breastworks, etc.  Captain Best, of the 4th United States Artillery, in the meantime had exerted himself to collect forty or fifty guns belonging to the Twelfth, Third, and some he had stopped from the Eleventh Corps, and had arranged them at Fairview, to fire over the heads of Berry's troops into the thicket where the enemy were posted and along the Plank Road.  Hooker was so disheartened at the unexpected success of the enemy, that when the first shock came he sent word to Sickles to save his command if he could.  There is little doubt that at one time he thought of retreating and leaving the Third Corps to its fate; for when the enemy charged there was an awful gap in our lines; Birney's, Whipple's, and Williams' divisions and Barlow's brigade were all absent.  Fortunately Jackson was unable to press his advantage. The ardor of the charge, the darkness, the thickets and the abattis in which his forces became entangled, caused Rodes' and Colston's divisions to be all intermingled, creating such disorder and confusion that military organization was suspended, and orders could neither be communicated nor obeyed.  Jackson therefore halted his men in the edge of the woods, about a mile and a half from Chancellorsville, posted two brigades on the two roads that came in from the south, and sent for Hill's division, which was in rear and which had not been engaged, to take the front, while the other two divisions fell back to the open space at Dowdall's Tavern to reform their lines.  Pending this movement he rode out on the Plank Road with part "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20762"],["title","Chancellorsville and Gettysburg (#7)"],["body","his staff and a few orderlies to reconnoitre, cautioning his pickets not to fire at him on his return.  When he came back new men had been posted, and his approach was mistaken for the advance of Pleasonton's cavalry.  His own troops fired into him with fatal effect.  Nearly all his escort were killed or wounded and he received three balls, which shattered both arms.  His horse ran toward the Union lines, and although he succeeded in turning him back, he was dashed against the trees and nearly unhorsed.  He reached the Confederate lines about the time our artillery again opened up on the Plank Road with a fire that swept everything from its front.  Several of his attendants were killed and others wounded. The rebels found the utmost difficulty in keeping their men in line under this tremendous fire.  Sentries had to be posted, and great precautions taken to prevent the troops from giving way.  General Pender recognized Jackson as he was carried past, and complained of the demoralizing effect of this cannonade, but Jackson replied sharply and sternly, \"You must hold your ground, General Pender.\" He was removed to the Wilderness Tavern, and as General Lee was in some fear that Averell's cavalry, then at Elley's Ford, would make a dash and capture him, he was sent on to Guiney's Station, on the Fredericksburg and Richmond Railroad, where he died on the 10th of May.  Whether the rebels killed him, or whether some of his wounds came from our own troops, the 1st Massachusetts or 73d New York, who were firing heavily in that direction, is a matter of some doubt.  While leaning over him and expressing his sympathy, A. P. Hill was also wounded by the fire from a section of Dimick's battery, posted in advance in the Plank Road,* and the command of his corps was assigned at his request to the cavalry general, J. E. B. Stuart.  When our artillery fire ceased, Hill's troops took position in front of the others.  [* Young Dimick was the son of a distinguished general of the regular army.  Though wounded on this occasion he refused to leave the field.  The next day he again sought the post of danger and was mortally wounded while holding the Plank Road.]    CHAPTER VI. SICKLES FIGHTS HIS WAY BACK.--ARRIVAL OF THE FIRST CORPS.  Sickles, with his ten thousand men heaped up at Hazel Grove, was still cut off from the main body and could only communicate with Hooker's headquarters by means of bypaths and at great risk.  The last orders he received, at 5 P.M., had been to attack Jackson's right flank and check his advance.  He determined to do this and force his way back, and with the co-operation of Williams' and Berry's divisions, retake the Plank Road with the bayonet.  Ward's brigade was posted in the front line and Hayman's and Graham's brigades a hundred yards in rear.  A special column, under Colonel Egan of the 40th New York, was formed on the extreme left.  The muskets were uncapped and at midnight the command moved silently against the enemy, and in spite of a terrific outburst of musketry and artillery from the open space at Dowdall's, the Plank Road and the works which Buschbeck had defended were regained.  Berry at once moved forward his line to hold them.  Many guns and caissons taken from Howard's corps, and Whipple's ammunition train of pack mules were also recovered.  The confusion into which the enemy were thrown by this assault against their right, enabled Berry to easily repulse the attack on him, and he continued to hold the position. The result of this brilliant movement was the reoccupation of a great part of the works Howard had lost, and the capture of two guns and three caissons from the enemy.  It is said that in this conflict some of Sickles' men, in consequence of the thickets and confusion, finding themselves surrounded, surrendered as they supposed to the enemy, but to their delight found themselves in Berry's division, among their old comrades.  Soon after this fight was over Mott's brigade of the Third Corps, which had been on duty at the Ford, rejoined the main body.  Both sides now rested on their arms and prepared to renew the struggle at daylight.  Hooker, in view of a possible defeat, directed his engineer officers to lay out a new and stronger line, to cover his bridges, to which he could retreat in case of necessity.  At sunset the First Corps went into bivouac on the south side of United States Ford, about four miles and a half from Chancellorsville. The men were glad enough to rest after their tedious march on a hot day, loaded down with eight days' rations.  General Reynolds left me temporarily in charge of the corps, while he rode on to confer with Hooker.  We heard afar off the roar of the battle caused by Jackson's attack, and saw the evening sky reddened with the fires of combat, but knowing Hooker had a large force, we felt no anxiety as to the result, and took it for granted that we would not be wanted until the next day.  I was preparing a piece of india- rubber cloth as a couch when I saw one of Reynolds' aids, Captain Wadsworth, coming down the road at full speed.  He brought the startling news that the Eleventh Corps had fled, and if we did not go forward at once, the army would be hopelessly defeated.  We were soon on the road, somewhat oppressed by the news, but not dismayed. We marched through the thickening twilight of the woods amid a silence at first only broken by the plaintive song of the whip-poor- will, until the full moon rose in all its splendor.  As we proceeded we came upon crowds of Eleventh Corps fugitives still hastening to the rear.  They seemed to be wholly disheartened.  We halted for a time, in order that our position in line of battle might be selected, and then moved on.  As we approached the field a midnight battle commenced, and the shells seemed to burst in sparkles in the trees above our heads, but not near enough to reach us.  It was Sickles fighting his way home again.  When we came nearer and filed to the right to take position on the Elley's Ford road, the men struck up John Brown's song, and gave the chorus with a will. Their cheerful demeanor and proud bearing renewed the confidence of the army, who felt that the arrival of Reynolds' corps, with its historic record, was no ordinary reinforcement.  We were now on the extreme right of the other forces, on the Elley's Ford road, with the right flank thrown back behind Hunting Creek.  Hooker was very much discouraged by the rout of the Eleventh Corps. An occurrence of this kind always has a tendency to demoralize an army and render it less trustworthy; for the real strength of an armed force is much more in _opinion_ than it is in _numbers_.  A small body of men, if made to believe the enemy are giving way, will do and dare anything; but when they think the struggle is hopeless, they will not resist even a weak attack, for each thinks he is to be sacrificed to save the rest.  Hence Hooker did not feel the same reliance on his men as he did before the disaster.  He determined, nevertheless, to continue the battle, but contract his lines by bringing them nearer to Chancellorsville.  The real key of the battle-field now was the eminence at Hazel Grove.  So long as we held it the enemy could not advance without presenting his right flank to our batteries.  If he obtained possession of it he could plant guns which would enfilade Slocum's line and fire directly into our forces below.  Birney's division at this time was posted in advance of Best's guns on the left, Berry was on the right, with Williams' division of the Twelfth Corps behind Birney, and Whipple's division in rear of Berry.  The position of Hazel Grove commanded Chancellorsville, where all the roads met, and which it was vital to Hooker to hold.  For if he lost that, he could not advance in any direction, and only his line of retreat to the Ford would remain open to him.  Pleasonton spent the night in fortifying this hill, and placed forty guns in position there; but it was of no avail, for it was outside of the new line Sickles was directed to occupy at daylight, and Hooker was not aware of its importance.  A request was sent to the latter to obtain his consent to hold it, but he was asleep, and the staff- officer in charge, who had had no experience whatever in military matters, positively refused to awaken him until daylight, and then it was too late, for that was the time set for the troops to fall back to the new line.  At 9 P.M., Hooker sent an order to Sedgwick, who was supposed to be at Falmouth and to have 26,000 men, to throw bridges over, cross, drive away Early's 9,000, who held the heights of Fredericksburg, and then to come forward on the Plank Road, and be ready at daylight on the 3d to take Lee's force in reverse, while Hooker attacked it in front.  This order was given under the impression that Sedgwick had not crossed with his main body, but only with Howe's division, whereas he was at the bridge heads, three miles below Fredericksburg, on the south side of the river.  Hooker probably forgot that he had ordered a demonstration to be made against the Bowling Green road on the 1st, and that Sedgwick went over to make it.    CHAPTER VII. THE BATTLE OF THE THIRD OF MAY.  The Eleventh Corps were now sent to the extreme left of the line to reorganize.  There they were sheltered behind the strong works thrown up by Humphrey's division, and were not so liable to be attacked.  The new line laid out by Hooker's order was on a low ridge perpendicular to the Plank Road, and opposite and at right angles to the right of Slocum's front.  It was strongly supported by the artillery of the Third, Twelfth, and part of the Eleventh Corps, massed under Captain Best on the heights at Fairview, in the rear and to the left.  Sickles was ordered to fall back to it at dawn of day, Birney to lead the way, and Whipple (Graham's brigade) to bring up the rear.  The Plank Road ran through the centre of the position, Birney being on the left and Berry"]]]
