Dat was de lonesome journey over de mountain high,   Down w'ere de w'ite fog risin' show w'ere de swamp is lie,   An' drive as he can de faster, an' furder away he get,   Johnnie can hear dat woman closer an' closer yet.    Offen he tell about it, not'ing he never do   Geev' heem de funny feelin' Johnnie is goin' t'roo,   But he is sure of wan t'ing, if Belzemire 's comin' die,   Poor woman, she 'd never foller affer heem wit' her cry.
