VII  JOHNNY CHUCK'S SECRET  Johnny Chuck pushed up the last bit of gravel from the hole he had dug between the roots of the old apple tree in a corner of the Green Meadows.  He smoothed it down on the big, yellow mound he had made in front of his door.  Then he sat up very straight on top of the mound, brushed his coat, shook the sand from his trousers and carefully cleaned his hands.  After he had rested a bit, he turned around and looked at his new home, for that is what it was, although he had not come there to live yet, and no one knew of it, no one but jolly, round, red Mr. Sun, who, peeping between the branches of the old apple tree, had caught Johnny Chuck at work.  But _he_ wouldn't tell, not jolly Mr. Sun!  Looking down from the blue sky every day he sees all sorts of queer things and he learns all kinds of secrets, does Mr. Sun, but he never, never tells.  No, Sir!  Mr. Sun never tells one of them, not even to Old Mother West Wind when at night they go down together behind the Purple Hills.  So jolly, round, red Mr. Sun just smiled and smiled when he discovered Johnny Chuck's secret, for that is just what the new home under the apple tree was--a secret.  Not even the Merry Little Breezes, who find out almost everything, had discovered it.  Johnny Chuck chuckled to himself as he planned a back door, a beautiful back door, hidden behind a tall clump of meadow grass where no one would think to look for a door.  When he had satisfied himself as to just where he would put it, he once more sat up very straight on his nice, new mound and looked this way and looked that way to be sure that no one was near.  Then he started for his old home along a secret little path he had made for himself.  Pretty soon he came to the Lone Little Path that went past his own home.  He danced and he skipped along the Lone Little Path, and, because he was so happy, he tried to turn a somersault.  But Johnny Chuck was so round and fat and rolly-poly that he just tumbled over in a heap.  \"Well, well, well!  What's the matter with you?\" said a voice close beside him before he could pick himself up.  It was Jimmy Skunk, who was out looking for some beetles for his dinner.  Johnny Chuck scrambled to his feet and looked foolish, very foolish indeed.  \"There's nothing the matter with me, Jimmy Skunk,\" said Johnny. \"There's nothing the matter with me.  It's just because I've got a secret.\"  \"A secret!\" cried Jimmy Skunk.  \"What is it?\"  \"Yes, a secret, a really, truly secret,\" said Johnny Chuck, and looked very important.  \"Tell me, Johnny Chuck.  Come on, tell just _me_, and then we'll have the secret together,\" begged Jimmy Skunk.  Now Johnny Chuck was so tickled with his secret that it seemed as if he _must_ share it with some one.  He just couldn't keep it to himself any longer.  \"You won't tell any one?\" said Johnny Chuck.  Jimmy Skunk promised that he wouldn't tell a soul.  \"Cross your heart,\" commanded Johnny Chuck.  Jimmy Skunk crossed his heart.  Then Johnny Chuck looked this way and looked that way to be sure that no one was listening.  Finally he whispered in Jimmy Skunk's ear:  \"I've got a new home under the old apple tree in a corner of the Green Meadows,\" said Johnny Chuck.  Of course Jimmy Skunk was very much surprised and very much interested, so Johnny Chuck told him all about it.  \"Now, remember, it's a secret,\" said Johnny Chuck, as Jimmy Skunk started off down the Lone Little Path across the Green Meadows, to look for some beetles.  \"I'll remember,\" said Jimmy Skunk.  \"And don't tell!\" called Johnny Chuck.  Jimmy Skunk promised that he wouldn't tell.  Then Johnny Chuck started off up the Lone Little Path, whistling, and Jimmy Skunk trotted down the Lone Little Path onto the Green Meadows.  Jimmy Skunk was thinking so much about Johnny Chuck's new home that he quite forgot to look for beetles, and he almost ran into Peter Rabbit.  \"Hello, Jimmy Skunk,\" said Peter Rabbit, \"can't you see where you are going?  It must be you have something on your mind; what is it?\"  \"I was thinking of Johnny Chuck's new home,\" said Jimmy Skunk.  \"Johnny Chuck's new home!\" exclaimed Peter Rabbit.  \"Has Johnny Chuck got a new home?  Where is it?\"  \"Under the roots of the old apple tree in a corner of the Green Meadows,\" said Jimmy Skunk, and then he clapped both hands over his mouth.  You see he hadn't really meant to tell.  It just slipped out.  \"Oh, but it's a secret!\" cried Jimmy Skunk.  \"It's a secret, and you mustn't tell.  I guess Johnny Chuck won't mind if you know, Peter Rabbit, but you mustn't tell any one else.\"  Peter Rabbit promised he wouldn't.  Now Peter Rabbit is very inquisitive, very inquisitive indeed.  So as soon as he had parted from Jimmy Skunk he made up his mind that he must see the new home of Johnny Chuck.  So off he started as fast as he could go towards the old apple tree in a corner of the Green Meadows. Half way there he met Reddy Fox.  \"Hello, Peter Rabbit!  Where are you going in such a hurry?\" asked Reddy Fox.  \"Over to the old apple tree to see Johnny Chuck's new home,\" replied Peter Rabbit as he tried to dodge past Reddy Fox.  Then of a sudden he remembered and clapped both hands over his mouth.  \"Oh, but it's a secret, Reddy Fox.  It's a secret, and you mustn't tell!\" cried Peter Rabbit.  But Reddy Fox wouldn't promise that he wouldn't tell, for in spite of his handsome coat and fine manners, Reddy Fox is a scamp.  And, besides, he has no love for Johnny Chuck, for he has not forgotten how Johnny Chuck once made him run and called him a \"'fraid cat.\"  So when Reddy Fox left Peter Rabbit he grinned a wicked grin and hurried off to find Bobby Coon.  He met him on his way to the Laughing Brook.  Reddy Fox told Bobby Coon all about Johnny Chuck's secret and then hurried away after Peter Rabbit, for Reddy Fox also is very inquisitive.  Bobby Coon went on down to the Laughing Brook.  There he met Billy Mink and told him about the new home Johnny Chuck had made under the old apple tree in a corner of the Green Meadows.  Pretty soon Billy Mink met Little Joe Otter and told him.  Then Little Joe Otter met Jerry Muskrat and told him.  Jerry Muskrat saw Blacky the Crow and told him, and Great-Grandfather Frog heard him.  Blacky the Crow met his first cousin, Sammy Jay, and told him.  Sammy Jay met Happy Jack Squirrel and told him.  Happy Jack met his cousin, Striped Chipmunk, and told him.  Striped Chipmunk passed the house of old Mr. Toad and told him.  The next morning, very early, before Old Mother West Wind had come down from the Purple Hills, Johnny Chuck stole over to his new home to begin work on his new back door.  He had hardly begun to dig when he heard some one cough right behind him.  He whirled around and there sat Peter Rabbit looking as innocent and surprised as if he had really just discovered the new home for the first time.  \"What a splendid new home you have, Johnny Chuck!\" said Peter Rabbit.  \"Y--e--s,\" said Johnny Chuck, slowly.  \"It's a secret,\" he added suddenly.  \"You won't tell, will you, Peter Rabbit?\"  Peter Rabbit promised that he wouldn't tell.  Then Johnny Chuck felt better and went back to work as soon as Peter Rabbit left.  He had hardly begun, however, when some one just above him said: \"Good morning, Johnny Chuck.\"  Johnny Chuck looked up and there in the old apple tree sat Blacky the Crow and his cousin, Sammy Jay.  Just then there was a rustle in the grass and out popped Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter and Jerry Muskrat and Happy Jack Squirrel and Striped Chipmunk and Bobby Coon.  When Johnny Chuck had recovered from his surprise and looked over to the doorway of his new home there sat Reddy Fox on Johnny Chuck's precious new mound.  It seemed as if all the little meadow people were there, all but Jimmy Skunk, who wisely stayed away.  \"We've come to see your new home,\" said Striped Chipmunk, \"and we think it's the nicest home we've seen for a long time.\"  \"It's so nicely hidden away, it's really quite secret,\" said Reddy Fox, grinning wickedly.  Just then up raced the Merry Little Breezes and one of them had a message for Johnny Chuck from Great-Grandfather Frog.  It was this:  \"Whisper a secret to a friend and you shout it in the ear of the whole world.\"  After every one had admired the new home, they said good-bye and scattered over the Green Meadows.  Then Johnny Chuck began to dig again, but this time he wasn't making his new back door.  No indeed! Johnny Chuck was digging at that new mound of yellow gravel of which he had been so proud.  Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun blinked to be sure that he saw aright, for Johnny Chuck was _filling up his new home_ between the roots of the old apple tree.  When he got through, there wasn't any new home.  Then Johnny Chuck brushed his coat carefully, shook the sand out of his trousers, wiped his hands and started off for his old home.  And this time he didn't take his special hidden path, for Johnny Chuck didn't care who saw him go.  Late that afternoon, Johnny Chuck sat on his old doorstep, with his chin in his hands, watching Old Mother West Wind gathering her Merry Little Breezes into the big bag in which she carries them to their home behind the Purple Hills.  \"'Whisper a secret to a friend and you shout it in the ear of the whole world.'  Now what did Grandfather Frog mean by that?\" thought Johnny Chuck.  \"Now I didn't tell anybody but Jimmy Skunk and Jimmy Skunk didn't tell anyone but Peter Rabbit and--and--\"  Then Johnny Chuck began to chuckle and finally to laugh.  \"'Whisper a secret to a friend and you shout it in the ear of the whole world.'  My gracious, what a loud voice I must have had and didn't know it!\" said Johnny Chuck, wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes.  And the next day Johnny Chuck started to make a new home.  Where?  Oh, that's Johnny Chuck's secret.  And no one but jolly, round, red Mr. Sun has found it out yet.     VIII  JOHNNY CHUCK'S"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20877"],["title","Mother West Wind's Children (#8)"],["body","FIGHT  Johnny Chuck sat on the doorstep of his new home, looking away across the Green Meadows.  Johnny Chuck felt very well satisfied with himself and with all the world.  He yawned lazily and stretched and stretched and then settled himself comfortably to watch the Merry Little Breezes playing down by the Smiling Pool.  By and by he saw Peter Rabbit go bobbing along down the Lone Little Path.  Lipperty, lipperty, lip, went Peter Rabbit and every other jump he looked behind him.  \"Now what is Peter Rabbit up to?\" said Johnny Chuck to himself, \"and what does he keep looking behind him for?\"  Johnny Chuck sat up a little straighter to watch Peter Rabbit hop down the Lone Little Path.  Then of a sudden he caught sight of something that made him sit up straighter than ever and open his eyes very wide. Something was following Peter Rabbit.  Yes, Sir, something was bobbing along right at Peter Rabbit's heels.  Johnny Chuck forgot the Merry Little Breezes.  He forgot how warm it was and how lazy he felt.  He forgot everything else in his curiosity to learn what it could be following so closely at Peter Rabbit's heels.  Presently Peter Rabbit stopped and sat up very straight and then--Johnny Chuck nearly tumbled over in sheer surprise!  He rubbed his eyes to make sure that he saw aright, for there were two Peter Rabbits!  Yes, Sir, there were _two_ Peter Rabbits, only one was very small, very small indeed.  \"Oh!\" said Johnny Chuck, \"that must be Peter Rabbit's baby brother!\"  Then he began to chuckle till his fat sides shook.  There sat Peter Rabbit with his funny long ears standing straight up, and there right behind him, dressed exactly like him, sat Peter Rabbit's baby brother with _his_ funny little long ears standing straight up.  When Peter Rabbit wiggled _his_ right ear, his baby brother wiggled his right ear. When Peter Rabbit scratched his left ear, his baby brother scratched _his_ left ear.  Whatever Peter Rabbit did, his baby brother did too.  Presently Peter Rabbit started on down the Lone Little Path--lipperty, lipperty, lip, and right at his heels went his baby brother--lipperty, lipperty, lip.  Johnny Chuck watched them out of sight, and then he settled himself on his doorstep once more to enjoy a sun bath.  Every once in a while he chuckled to himself as he remembered how funny Peter Rabbit's baby brother had looked.  Presently Johnny Chuck fell asleep.  Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had climbed quite high in the sky when Johnny Chuck awoke.  He yawned and stretched and stretched and yawned, and then he sat up to look over the Green Meadows.  Then he became wide awake, very wide awake indeed!  Way down on the Green Meadows he caught a glimpse of something red jumping about in the long meadow grass.  \"That must be Reddy Fox,\" thought Johnny Chuck.  \"Yes, it surely is Reddy Fox.  Now I wonder what mischief he is up to.\"  Then he saw all the Merry Little Breezes racing towards Reddy Fox as fast as they could go.  And there was Sammy Jay screaming at the top of his voice, and his cousin, Blacky the Crow.  Happy Jack Squirrel was dancing up and down excitedly on the branch of an old elm close by.  Johnny Chuck waited to see no more, but started down the Lone Little Path to find out what it all was about.  Half way down the Lone Little Path he met Peter Rabbit running as hard as he could.  His long ears were laid flat back, his big eyes seemed to pop right out of his head, and he was running as Johnny Chuck had never seen him run before.  \"What are you running so for, Peter Rabbit?\" asked Johnny Chuck.  \"To get Bowser the Hound,\" shouted Peter Rabbit over his shoulder, as he tried to run faster.  \"Now what can be the matter?\" said Johnny Chuck to himself, \"to send Peter Rabbit after Bowser the Hound?\"  He knew that, like all the other little meadow people, there was nothing of which Peter Rabbit was so afraid as Farmer Brown's great dog, Bowser the Hound.  Johnny Chuck hurried down the Lone Little Path as fast as his short legs could take his fat, rolly-poly self.  Presently he came out onto the Green Meadows, and there he saw a sight that set every nerve in his round little body a-tingle with rage.  Reddy Fox had found Peter Rabbit's baby brother and was doing his best to frighten him to death.  \"I'm going to eat you now,\" shouted Reddy Fox, and then he sprang on Peter Rabbit's baby brother and gave him a cuff that sent him heels over head sprawling in the grass.  \"Coward!  Coward, Reddy Fox!\" shrieked Sammy Jay.  \"Shame!  Shame!\" shouted the Merry Little Breezes.  \"You're nothing but a great big bully!\" yelled Blacky the Crow.  But no one did anything to help Peter Rabbit's baby brother, for Reddy Fox is so much bigger than any of the rest of them, except Bobby Coon, that all the little meadow people are afraid of him.  But Reddy Fox just laughed at them, and nipped the long ears of Peter Rabbit's little brother so hard that he cried with the pain.  Now all were so intent watching Reddy Fox torment the baby brother of Peter Rabbit that no one had seen Johnny Chuck coming down the Lone Little Path.  And for a few minutes no one recognized the furious little yellow-brown bundle that suddenly knocked Reddy Fox over and seized him by the throat.  You see it didn't look a bit like Johnny Chuck.  Every hair was standing on end, he was so mad, and this made him appear twice as big as they had ever seen him before.  \"Coward!  Coward!  Coward!\" shrieked Johnny Chuck as he shook Reddy Fox by the throat.  And then began the greatest fight that the Green Meadows had ever seen.  Now Johnny Chuck is not naturally a fighter.  Oh my, no!  He is so good-natured and so sunny-hearted that he seldom quarrels with any one. But when he has to fight, there isn't a cowardly hair on him, not the teeniest, weeniest one.  No one ever has a chance to cry, \"'Fraid cat! Cry baby!\" after Johnny Chuck.  So though, like all the other little meadow people, he was usually just a little afraid of Reddy Fox, because Reddy is so much bigger, he forgot all about it as soon as he caught sight of Reddy Fox tormenting Peter Rabbit's little brother.  He didn't stop to think of what might happen to himself.  He didn't stop to think at all.  He just gritted his teeth and in a flash had Reddy Fox on his back.  Such a fight was never seen before on the Green Meadows!  Reddy Fox is a bully and a coward, for he never fights with any one of his own size if he can help it, but when he has to fight, he fights hard.  And he certainly had to fight now.  \"Bully!\" hissed Johnny Chuck as with his stout little hind feet he ripped the bright red coat of Reddy Fox.  \"You great big bully!\"  Over and over they rolled, Johnny Chuck on top, then Reddy Fox on top, then Johnny Chuck up again, clawing and snarling.  It seemed as if news of the fight had gone over all the Green Meadows, for the little meadow people came running from every direction--Billy Mink, Little Joe Otter, Jerry Muskrat, Striped Chipmunk, Jimmy Skunk, old Mr. Toad.  Even Great-Grandfather Frog, who left his big lily pad, and came hurrying with great jumps across the Green Meadows.  They formed a ring around Reddy Fox and Johnny Chuck and danced with excitement.  And all wanted Johnny Chuck to win.  Peter Rabbit's poor little brother, so sore and lame from the knocking about from Reddy Fox, and so frightened that he hardly dared breathe, lay flat on the ground under a little bush and was forgotten by all but the Merry Little Breezes, who covered him up with some dead grass, and kissed him and whispered to him not to be afraid now.  How Peter Rabbit's little brother did hope that Johnny Chuck would win!  His great, big, round, soft eyes were wide with terror as he thought of what might happen to him if Reddy Fox should whip Johnny Chuck.  But Reddy Fox wasn't whipping Johnny Chuck.  Try as he would, he could not get a good hold on that round, fat, little body.  And Johnny Chuck's stout claws were ripping his red coat and white vest and Johnny Chuck's sharp teeth were gripping him so that they could not be shaken loose.  Pretty soon Reddy Fox began to think of nothing but getting away.  Every one was shouting for Johnny Chuck.  Every time Reddy Fox was underneath, he would hear a great shout from all the little meadow people, and he knew that they were glad.  Now Johnny Chuck was round and fat and rolly-poly, and when one is round and fat and rolly-poly, one's breath is apt to be short.  So it was with Johnny Chuck.  He had fought so hard that his breath was nearly gone.  Finally he loosed his hold on Reddy Fox for just a second to draw in a good breath.  Reddy Fox saw his chance, and, with a quick pull and spring, he broke away.  How all the little meadow people did scatter!  You see they were very brave, very brave indeed, so long as Johnny Chuck had Reddy Fox down, but now that Reddy Fox was free, each one was suddenly afraid and thought only of himself.  Jimmy Skunk knocked Jerry Muskrat flat in his hurry to get away.  Billy Mink trod on Great-Grandfather Frog's big feet and didn't even say \"Excuse me.\"  Striped Chipmunk ran head first into a big thistle and squealed as much from fear as pain.  But Reddy Fox paid no attention to any of them.  He just wanted to get away, and off he started, limping as fast as he could go up the Lone Little Path.  Such a looking sight!  His beautiful red coat was in tatters.  His face was scratched.  He hobbled as he ran.  And just as he broke away, Johnny Chuck made a grab and pulled a great mouthful of hair out of the splendid tail Reddy Fox was so proud of.  When the little meadow people saw that Reddy Fox was actually running away, they stopped running themselves, and all began to shout: \"Reddy Fox is a coward and a bully!  Coward!  Coward!\"  Then they crowded around Johnny Chuck and all began talking at once about his great fight.  Just then they heard a great noise up on the hill.  They saw Reddy Fox coming back down the Lone Little Path, and he was using his"]]]
