He suspects the vicar of favouritism in awarding the prizes. The fact that his daughter won first prize for rabbits with a giant Belgian did little to console him.\"  \"And we raised quite a respectable sum for the Red Cross by charging threepence admission to see a stuffed menagerie of Phil's,\" added Miss Heredith.  \"A stuffed menagerie! What a curious thing,\" remarked a young lady.  \"Not quite a menagerie,\" said Sir Philip. \"Merely the stuffed remains of some animals Phil used to keep as a youngster. When they died--as they invariably did--he used to skin them and stuff them. He was quite an expert taxidermist.\"  \"Tell them about your museum exhibit, Philip,\" said Miss Heredith, with quite an animated air.  \"We also arranged a little exhibition of--er--old things,\" continued Sir Philip diffidently. \"Armour, miniatures, some old jewels, and things like that. That also brought in quite a respectable sum for the Red Cross.\"  \"From the Heredith collection, I presume?\" said Mr. Brimley.  \"What wonderful old treasures you must have in this wonderful old house of yours,\" gushed the young lady who had spoken before. \"I am so disappointed in not seeing the Heredith pearl necklace. What a pity dear Mrs. Heredith is ill. She was going to wear the pearls to-night, and now I shall have to go away without seeing them.\"  Sir Philip bowed. He did not quite relish the trend of the conversation, but he was too well-bred to show it.  \"You shall see the pearls in the morning,\" said Miss Heredith courteously.  \"I adore pearls,\" sighed the guest.  \"If you admire pearls, you should see the collection which is being made for the British Red Cross,\" remarked Vincent Musard. \"I had a private view the other day. It is a truly magnificent collection.\"  All eyes were turned on the speaker. The topic interested every lady present, and they were aware that Musard was one of the foremost living authorities on jewels. The men had all heard of the famous traveller by repute, and they wanted to listen to what he had to say. Musard seemed rather embarrassed to find himself the object of general attention, and went on with his dinner in silence. But some of the ladies were determined not to lose the opportunity of learning something from such a well-known expert on a subject so dear to their hearts, and they plied him with eager questions.  \"It must be a wonderful collection,\" said a slight and slender girl named Garton, with blue eyes and red hair. She was a lady journalist attached to Mr. Brimley's paper. Twenty years ago she would have been called an advanced woman. She believed in equality for the sexes in all things, and wrote articles on war immorality, the \"social evil\" and kindred topics in a frank unabashed way which caused elderly old-fashioned newspaper readers much embarrassment. Miss Garton was just as eager as the more frivolous members of her sex to hear about the Red Cross pearls, and begged Mr. Musard to give her some details. She would have to do a \"write up\" about the necklace when she returned to London, she said, and any information from Mr. Musard would be so helpful.  \"It is not a single necklace,\" said Musard. \"There are about thirty necklaces. The Red Cross committee have already received nearly 4,000 pearls, and more are coming in every day.\"  \"Four thousand pearls!\" \"How perfectly lovely!\" \"How I should love to see them!\" These feminine exclamations sounded from different parts of the table.  \"I suppose the collection is a very fine and varied one?\" observed Sir Philip.  \"Undoubtedly. The committee have had the advice of the best experts in London, who have given much time to grading the pearls for the different necklaces. In an ordinary way it takes a long while--sometimes years--to match the pearls for a faultless necklace, but in this case the experts have had such a variety brought to their hands that their task has been comparatively easy. But in spite of the skilful manner in which the necklaces have been graded, it is even now a simple matter for the trained eye to identify a number of the individual pearls. The largest, a white pearl of pear shape, weighing 72 grains, would be recognized by any expert anywhere. There are several other pearls over thirty grains which the trained eye would recognize with equal ease in any setting. The few pink and black pearls are all known to collectors, and it is the same with the clasps. One diamond and ruby clasp is as well-known in jewel history as the State Crown. The diamonds are in the form of a Maltese Cross, set in a circle of rubies.\"  \"That must have been the gift of the Duchess of Welburton,\" remarked Sir Philip. \"She inherited it from her great aunt, Adelina, wife of the third duke. There was a famous pearl necklace attached to the clasp once, but it disappeared about ten years ago at a ball given by the German Ambassador, Prince Litzovny. I remember there was a lot of talk about it at the time, but the necklace was never recovered. The clasp, too, has a remarkable history.\"  \"All great jewels have,\" said Musard. \"In fact, all noteworthy stones have dual histories. Their career as cut and polished gems is only the second part. Infinitely more interesting is the hidden history of each great jewel, from the discovery of the rough stone to the period when it reaches the hands of the lapidary, to be polished and cut for a drawing-room existence. What a record of intrigue and knavery, stabbings and poisonings, connected with some of the greatest jewels in the British Crown--the Black Prince's ruby, for example!\"  Musard gazed thoughtfully at the great ruby on his own finger as he ceased speaking. The guests had finished dinner, and Miss Heredith, with a watchful eye on the big carved clock which swung a sedate pendulum by the fireplace, beckoned Tufnell to her and directed him to serve coffee and liqueurs at table.  \"What is your favourite stone, Mr. Musard?\" said a bright-eyed girl sitting near him, after coffee had been served.  \"Personally I have a weakness for the ruby,\" replied Musard. \"Its intrinsic value has been greatly discounted in these days of synthetic stones, but it is still my favourite, largely, I suppose, because a perfect natural ruby is so difficult to find. I remember once journeying three thousand miles up the Amazon in search of a ruby reputed to be as large as a pigeon's egg. But it did not exist--it was a myth.\"  \"What a life yours has been!\" said the girl. \"How different from the humdrum existence of us stay-at-homes! How I should like to hear some of your adventures. They must be thrilling.\"  \"If you want to hear a real thrilling adventure, Miss Finch, you should get Mr. Musard to tell you how he came by that ruby he is wearing,\" said Phil Heredith, joining in the conversation.  The eyes of all the guests were directed to the ring which Musard was wearing on the little finger of his left hand. The stone in the plain gold setting was an unusually large one, nearly an inch in length. The stone had been polished, not cut, and glowed rather than sparkled with a deep rich red--the true \"pigeon's-blood\" tint so admired by connoisseurs.  \"Nonsense, Phil\"--Musard flushed under his brown skin--\"your guests do not want to hear me talk any more about myself. I've monopolized the conversation too long already.\"  \"Oh, please do tell us!\" exclaimed several of the guests.  \"Really, you know, I'd rather not,\" responded Musard, in some embarrassment. \"It's a long story, for one thing, and it's not quite--how shall I express it--it's a bit on the horrible side to relate in the presence of ladies.\"  \"I do not think that need deter you,\" remarked one of the young officers drily. \"We are all pretty strong-minded nowadays--since the War.\"  \"Oh, we should love to hear it,\" said the lady journalist, who scented good \"copy.\" \"Shouldn't we?\" she added, turning to some of the ladies near her.  \"Yes, indeed!\" chorused the other ladies. \"Do tell us.\"  \"Go ahead, Musard--you see you can't get out of it,\" said Phil.  \"Perhaps, Phil, as Mr. Musard does not think it a suitable story--\" commenced Miss Heredith tentatively. Her eye was fixed anxiously on the clock, which was verging on twenty minutes past seven, and she feared the relation of her old friend's experience might make them late at the Weynes. But at that moment Tufnell approached his mistress and caught her eye. A slight shade of annoyance crossed her brow as she listened to something he communicated in a low voice, and she turned to her guests.  \"I must ask you to excuse me for a few moments,\" she said.  She rose from her place and left the room. As the door closed behind her the ladies turned eagerly to Musard.  \"Now, please, tell us about the ruby,\" said several in unison.  The explorer glanced at the eager faces looking towards him.  \"Very well, I will tell you the story,\" he said quietly, but with visible reluctance.     CHAPTER IV   \"It was before the war. Many strange things have happened in the world before the Boche broke loose with his dream of 'Deutschland Ã¼ber Alles.' I had been to Melville Island trying to match a pearl for the Devonshire necklace, and I went from the pearl fisheries to New Zealand, led there by rumours of the discovery of some wonderful black pearls. It was, however, a wild-goose chase. These rumours generally are. One of the experts of the New Zealand Fishery Department had been exploring the Haurakai Gulf, and returned to Auckland with a number of black pearls, which he had found in an oyster-bed on one of the Barrier Islands. He thought his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20546"],["title","The Hand in the Dark (#6)"],["body","was made, though, being a fishery expert, he ought to have known better. They were black pearls right enough, but they came from edible oysters, and were valueless as jewels--not worth a shilling each.  \"I put up at the Royal hotel, Auckland, waiting for a ship to take me back to England. I had arranged to return round the Cape, to look at a parcel of diamonds which were expected to arrive at Capetown from the fields in about six weeks' time. The day before I was due to sail, a rough-looking man named Moynglass, a miner, came to the hotel to see me. He had heard of me as a mining expert, and he had a business proposition which he wanted to place before me.  \"He told me he and four others had just returned to Auckland after putting in six weeks among the volcanic beaches of the North Island, searching--'fossicking,' he called it--for fine gold. These black sand volcanic beaches are common in parts of New Zealand. The black sand is derived from the crystals of magnetic iron, and there is frequently a fair amount of fine gold mingled with them. By the continued action of the surf the heavier materials, gold, and ironstone sand, are mingled together between high and low water mark, and what appears as a stratum of black sand is found on the surface or buried under the ordinary sand. The gold is usually very fine, and the trouble of sifting and collecting it is great. A man works for wages, and hard-earned wages at that, who goes in for this kind of mining. But your true miner is ever an adventurer and a gambler, and gold thus won is dearer to his heart than gold which might be earned with less effort and more regularity in the form of sovereigns. You see, there is always the chance of a big find.  \"Moynglass and his party had met with fair success along the beaches, but they wanted more than that. Moynglass was anxious to trace the fine gold to its source, and find a fortune. He believed, like most miners, that this fine gold is carried along the beds of the larger rivers and distributed by the action of the sea along the different beaches where it is found. His theory was that if the drift of the gold sands could be traced to their source, a great quartz reef would be found which would make the discoverers wealthy men. But he and his mates knew nothing about geology, and they wanted somebody to go with them who could chart the course, and lead them to the launching point of the gold.  \"I had heard this theory before, and was not impressed by it. I should probably have turned down Moynglass's proposition if, in the course of his conversation, he had not produced a sample of ruby quartz from his pocket and showed it to me. He said he had found it while exploring one of the rivers of the Urewera country. I examined the quartz attentively. It was emery rock, and imbedded in the pale green mass were ruby crystals, and true Oriental rubies at that. I realized the valuable nature of the discovery, and questioned the man closely as to where he had obtained the ruby rock, but he became instantly suspicious, and guarded in his replies. If I joined his party--well and good: he would show me the spot, and we would share and share alike, but he would tell me nothing otherwise.  \"I decided to go, and the terms were agreed upon. We set out from Auckland, the five of us, a week later. We went by coastal steamer to a little port in the Bay of Plenty, and there we plunged into the Urewera Mountains. My companions thought of nothing but the search for the source of the golden sands, but I was interested only in the ruby rock. There lay the fortune, if I could find it. I carried the specimen of corundum in my waistcoat pocket.  \"The river we were ascending to its source was called the Araheoa. It was a rushing, noisy torrent, winding along a deep and narrow gorge, which in places almost met overhead. Some patches of olivine and serpentine encouraged me to think that we should find a heavy belt of the rock somewhere along the upper part of the valley, but my hopes were not realized. Day after day passed, and I found no more of it. When my companions washed the sands of likely stretches of river beach for fine gold, I examined the waste for corundum crystals, but I found no signs of them.  \"We followed the river until we reached an inaccessible mountain gorge which seemed to bar our further progress. But, by diverting our course some miles to the northward, we were able to ascend to the upper reaches of the river, and, here, to my delight, I found the banks and rapids studded with great green masses of olivine rocks.  \"I was anxious to examine these rocks, which extended up the mountain side, and my companions agreed with me that it was advisable to leave the bed of the river for the spur of the mountains where the river apparently took its rise. We crossed the stream, and commenced a gradual but oblique ascent of the spur. But after climbing for some hours we found our further progress stopped by a wide and deep gully, a sinister place, full of masses of dark green rocks. At the foot of one of the largest of these rocks we came across a large hole descending almost perpendicularly into the earth.  \"We lit our lamps and descended. After some scrambling we found ourselves on a landing-place, from which another low passage of an easier gradient led into a large cave in the solid rock.  \"The surface underneath our feet was covered with a dust so fine that it slipped from beneath us like sand, and rose in thick clouds about us. The cave was high enough to walk upright in, and seemed to run a great distance, with many lateral passages and smaller recesses off the principal chamber. Moynglass entered one of these passages and disappeared from view. A few moments afterwards we heard him, in a very excited voice, calling us to follow him.  \"We proceeded stooping, in Indian file, down the passage, and found Moynglass in a smaller cave at the end of it, staring intently at something which was at first difficult to see in the gloom. Then, by the light of our lamps, we made out a sapling sticking up between two rocks, with a withered human hand impaled on it by a rusty sheath knife.  \"As I was examining it, one of my companions, who had been exploring the cave, gave a cry of astonishment which caused me to look round. In a corner of the cave, revealed by his lamp, lay two skeletons side by side. The hand of one skeleton was missing, and in the eye of the other there gleamed a large uncut ruby. We examined the skeletons and searched the cave, but found nothing to throw any light on the mystery or reveal any clue of identity. There was not a vestige of food or clothing around the remains, and not a scrap of writing--only the two crumbling skeletons, the sapling, the sheath knife, and the ruby.  \"What had brought about such a tragedy in the dim recesses of that prehistoric cave? Who could say? Perhaps the men had been prospecting together, and one had found the ruby and hidden in the cave, where his companion had found him and cut off his right hand with some primitive idea of making his vengeance fit the crime. Then, perhaps, they had been unable to escape from the cave, and had died together of thirst and hunger. But what is the use of speculating? The secret must ever remain hidden in the cave where the skeletons still lie.\"  Musard stopped abruptly, and sat staring straight in front of him. His strange eyes had a fixed look, as if gazing into the distance. His brown hand rested lightly on the white tablecloth, and the great ruby on his little finger gleamed fitfully in the light.  \"You haven't told us all the story yet,\" said Phil Heredith quietly.  The other looked doubtfully at the ring of intent faces regarding him. \"I left that part untold for a good reason,\" he admitted. \"It is--well, I thought it a little bit too horrible to relate.\"  \"Oh, do tell us,\" said the lady journalist enthusiastically. \"We are all dying to hear it. It is such an unusual and exciting story that it would be cruel to leave us in suspense about the end.\"  \"Very well, then,\" said Musard, as the other ladies chorused their approval. \"We left the cave, and Moynglass, who considered himself the leader of the expedition, put the ruby in his pocket. That night we camped at a wild desolate spot, not far from the edge of a cliff about two hundred feet high, at the foot of which the bitter sulphurous waters of the river flowed into a chasm. In the morning we found Moynglass lying dead in his blanket, with the rusty sheath knife he had brought away from the cave sticking in his breast. The ruby was gone, and, so, also, was the eldest member of our party--an elderly dark-faced Irishman named Doyne, who, the previous day, had angrily disputed Moynglass's right to carry the ruby.  \"We searched for Doyne all that day, but could find no trace of him. The next day we tracked across a glacier-like expanse littered with large blocks of sandstone. It was a grim spot. A horrible, stony, treeless waste which might have been the birthplace of the earth and the scene of Creation--a tableland between great mountains, full of masses of rhodonite contorted into grotesque shapes of stone images; a place where our lightest whispers came shouting back out of the profound stillness from the huge castellated black rocks bristling on the edge of a precipice which slit the valley from end to end.  \"It was there we found Doyne, staggering along the lip of the gorge. He had gone mad in the solitude, and was wandering along bareheaded, tossing his arms in the air as he walked. When I saw him I thought of Cain trying to escape from the wrath of God after killing Abel. He saw us as soon as we saw him, and started to run. We set out in pursuit, but he fled with great speed, leaping from rock to rock like a mountain goat. He was getting away from us when he slipped and fell into the chasm with a loud cry. We found a path down the precipice and descended, and discovered him at the foot, battered to"]]]
