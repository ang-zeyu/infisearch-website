Dat 's purty beeg word, Charmette, for go     On poor leetle house so small,   Wit' only wan chimley, a winder or so,     An' no galerie at all--   But I want beeg word, so de worl' will know     W'at dat place it was mean to me,   An' dere on de book of Jean Jacques Rousseau,     Charmette is de nam' I see.
