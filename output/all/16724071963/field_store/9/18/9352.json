They had been reasonably successful in a portion of their attempt, at least; as the French government had agreed, though secretly, to furnish arms and other munitions of war through a pseudo-mercantile firm which was represented by M. de Beaumarchais, the gifted author of the comedy \"Le Mariage de Figaro.\"  The French had also agreed to furnish a limited amount of money; but, more important than all these, there were hints and indications that if the American army could win any decisive battle or maintain the unequal conflict for any length of time, an open and closer alliance would be made.  The envoys had despatched Colonel Wilton, from their number, back to America to make a report of the progress of their negotiations to Congress.  This had been done, and General Washington had been informed of the situation.  The little ship, one of the gallant vessels of the nascent American navy, in which Colonel Wilton had returned from France, had attacked and captured a British brig of war during the return passage, and young Seymour, who was the first lieutenant of the ship, was severely wounded.  The wound had been received through his efforts to protect Colonel Wilton, who had incautiously joined the boarding-party which had captured the brig.  After the interview with Congress, Colonel Wilton was requested to await further instructions before returning to France, and, pending the result of the deliberations of Congress, after a brief visit to the headquarters of his old friend and neighbor General Washington, he had retired to his estate.  As a special favor, he was permitted to bring with him the wounded lieutenant, in order that he might recuperate and recover from his wound in the pleasant valleys of Virginia.  That Seymour was willing to leave his own friends in Philadelphia, with all their care and attention, was due entirely to his desire to meet Miss Katharine Wilton, of whose beauty he had heard, and whose portrait indeed, in her father's possession, which he had seen before on the voyage, had borne out her reputation.  Seymour had been informed since his stay at the Wiltons' that he had been detached from the brig Argus, and notified that he was to receive orders shortly to report to the ship Ranger, commanded by a certain Captain John Paul Jones; and he knew that he might expect his sailing orders at any moment.  He had improved, as has been seen, the days of his brief stay to recover from one wound and receive another, and, as might have been expected, he had fallen violently in love with Katharine Wilton.  There were also staying at the house, besides the servants and slaves, young Philip Wilton, Katharine's brother, a lad of sixteen, who had just received a midshipman's warrant, and was to accompany Seymour when he joined the Ranger, then outfitting at Philadelphia; and Bentley, an old and veteran sailor, a boatswain's mate, who had accompanied Seymour from ship to ship ever since the lieutenant was a midshipman,--a man who had but one home, the sea; one hate, the English; one love, his country; and one attachment, Seymour.  Colonel Wilton was a widower.  As Katharine came down the stairway, clad in all the finery her father had brought back for her from Paris, her hair rolled high and powdered, the old family diamonds with their quaint setting of silver sparkling upon her snowy neck, her fan languidly waving in her hand, she looked strikingly like a pictured woman smiling down at them from over the mantel; but to the sweetness and archness of her mother's laughing face were added some of the colonel's pride, determination, and courage.  He stepped to meet her, and then bent and kissed the hand she extended toward him, with all the grace of the old r√©gime; and Seymour coming upon them was entranced with the picture.  He too had changed his attire, and now was clad in the becoming dress of a naval lieutenant of the period.  He wore a sword, of course, and a dark blue uniform coat relieved with red facings, with a single epaulet on his shoulder which denoted his official rank; his blond hair was lightly touched with powder, and tied, after the fashion of active service, in a queue with a black ribbon.  \"Now, Seymour, since you two truants have come at last, will you do me the honor to hand Miss Wilton to the dining-room?\" remarked the colonel, straightening up.  With a low bow, Seymour approached the object of his adoration, who, after a sweeping courtesy, gave him her hand.  With much state and ceremony, preceded by one of the servants, who had been waiting in attention in the hall, and followed by the colonel, and lastly by the colonel's man, a stiff old campaigner who had been with him many years, they entered the dining-room, which opened from the rear of the hall.  The table was a mass of splendid plate, which sparkled under the soft light of the wax candles in candelabra about the room or on the table, and the simple meal was served with all the elegance and precision which were habitual with the gentleman of as fine a school as Colonel Wilton.  At the table, instead of the light and airy talk which might have been expected in the situation, the conversation assumed that grave and serious tone which denoted the imminence of the emergency.  The American troops had been severely defeated at Long Island in the summer, and since that time had suffered a series of reverses, being forced steadily back out of New York, after losing Fort Washington, and down through the Jerseys, relentlessly pursued by Howe and Cornwallis. Washington was now making his way slowly to the west bank of the Delaware.  He was losing men at every step, some by desertion, more by the expiration of the terms of their enlistment.  The news which Colonel Wilton had brought threw a frail hope over the situation, but ruin stared them in the face, and unless something decisive was soon accomplished, the game would be lost.  \"Did you have a pleasant ride up the river, Katharine?\" asked her father.  \"Very, sir,\" she answered, blushing violently and looking involuntarily at Seymour, who matched her blush with his own.  There was a painful pause, which Seymour broke, coming to the rescue with a counter question.  \"Did you notice that small sloop creeping up under the west bank of the river, colonel, this evening?  I should think she must be opposite the house now, if the wind has held.\"  \"Why, when did you see her, Mr. Seymour?  I thought you were looking at--at--\"  She broke off in confusion, under her father's searching gaze.  He smiled, and said,--  \"Ah, Katharine, trained eyes see all things unusual about them, although they are apparently bent persistently upon one spot.  Yes, Seymour, I did notice it; if we were farther down the river, we might suspect it of being an enemy, but up here I fancy even Dunmore's malevolence would scarcely dare to follow.\"  Katharine looked up in alarm.  \"Oh, father, do you think it is quite safe?  Chloe told me that Phoebus told her that the raiders had visited Major Lithcomb's plantation, and you know that is not more than fifty miles down the river from us.  Would it not be well to take some precaution?\"  \"Tut, tut, child! gossip of the negro servants!\"  The colonel waved it aside carelessly.  \"I hardly think we have anything to fear at present; though what his lordship may do in the end, unless he is checked, I hardly like to imagine.\"  \"But, father,\" persisted Katharine, \"they said that Johnson was in command of the party, and you know he hates you.  You remember he said he would get even with you if it cost him his life, when you had him turned out of the club at Williamsburg.\"  \"Pshaw, Katharine, the wretch would not dare.  It is a cowardly blackguard, Seymour, whom I saw cheating at cards at the Assembly Club at the capital.  I had him expelled from the society of gentlemen, where, indeed, he had no right of admittance, and I scarcely know how he got there originally.  He made some threats against me, to which I naturally paid no attention.  But what did you think of the vessel?\"  \"I confess I saw nothing suspicious about her, sir,\" replied Seymour. \"She seemed very much like the packets which ply on the river; I only spoke idly of the subject.\"  \"But, father, the packet went up last week, the day before you came back, and is due coming down the river now, while this boat is coming up,\" said Katharine.  \"Oh, well, I think we are safe enough now; but, to relieve your unusual anxiety, I will send Blodgett down to the wharf to examine and report.--Blodgett, do you go down to the boat-landing and keep watch for an hour or two.  Take your musket, man; there is no knowing what you might need it for.\"  The old soldier, who had stationed himself behind the colonel's chair, saluted with military precision, and left the room, saying, \"Very good, sir; I shall let nothing escape my notice, sir.\"  \"Now, Katharine, I hope you are satisfied.\"  \"Yes, father; but if it is the raiders, Blodgett won't be able to stop them.\"  \"The raiders,\" laughed the colonel; and pinching his daughter's ear, he said, \"I suspect the only raiders we shall see here will be those who have designs upon your heart, my bonny Kate,--eh, Seymour?\"  \"They would never dare to wear a British uniform in that case, father,\" she retorted proudly.  \"Well, Seymour, I hear, through an express from Congress to-day, that Captain Jones has been ordered to command the Ranger, and that the new flag--we will drink to it, if you please; yes, you too, Katharine; God bless every star and stripe in it--will soon be seen on the ocean.\"  \"It will be a rare sight there, sir,\" said Seymour; \"but it will not be long before the exploits of the Ranger will make it known on the high seas, if rumor does not belie her captain.\"  \"I trust so; but do"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20791"],["title","For Love of Country: A Story of Land and Sea in the Days of the Revolution (#4)"],["body","know this Captain Jones?\"  \"Not at all, sir, save by reputation; but I am told he has one requisite for a successful officer.\"  \"And what is that?\"  \"He will fight anything, at any time, or at any place, no matter what the odds.\"  Colonel Wilton smiled.  \"Ah, well, if it were not for men of that kind, our little navy would never have a chance.\"  \"No, father, nor the army, either; if we waited for equality before fighting, I am afraid we should wait forever.\"  \"True, Katharine.  By the way, have you seen Talbot to-day?\"  \"No, father.\"  \"I wish that we might enlist his services in the cause.  I don't think there is much doubt about Talbot himself, is there?\"  \"No.  It is his mother, you know; she is a loyalist to the core.  As were her ancestors, so is she.\"  The colonel nodded gently; he had a soft spot in his heart for the subject of their discussion.  \"With her teaching and training, I can well understand it, Katharine.  Proud, of high birth, descended from the 'loyal Talbots,' and the widow of one of them, she cannot bear the thought of rebellion against the king.  I don't think she cares much for the people, or their liberties either.\"  \"Yes, father; with her the creed is, the king can do no wrong.\"  \"Ah, well,\" said the colonel, reflectively, \"I thought so too once, and many is the blow I have struck for this same king.  But liberty is above royalty, independence not a dweller in the court; so, in my old age, I find myself on a different side.\"  He sipped his wine thoughtfully a moment, and continued,--  \"Madam Talbot has certainly striven to restrain the boy, and successfully so far.  He is a splendid fellow; I wish we had him.  He would be of great service to the cause, with his name and influence, and the money he would bring; and then the quality of the young man himself would be of value to us.  You have met him, Seymour, I believe?\"  \"Yes, sir, several times; and I agree with you entirely.  It is his mother who keeps him back.  I have had one or two conversations with her.  She is a Tory through and through.\"  \"Not a doubt of it, not a doubt of it,\" said the colonel.  \"Katharine, can't you do something with him?\"  \"Oh, father, you know that I have talked with him, pleaded with him, and begged him to follow his inclination; but he remains by his mother.\"  \"Nonsense, Katharine!  Don't speak of him in that way; give him time. It is a hard thing: he is her only son; she is a widow.  Let us hope that something will induce him to come over to us.\"  He said this in gentle reproof of his spirited daughter; and then,--  \"Permit me to offer you a glass of wine, Seymour,--you are not drinking anything; and to whom shall we drink?\"  Seymour, who had been quaffing deep draughts of Katharine's beauty, replied promptly,--  \"If I might suggest, sir, I should say Mistress Wilton.\"  \"No, no,\" said Katharine.  \"Drink, first of all, to the success of our cause.  I will give you a toast, gentlemen: Before our sweethearts, our sisters, our wives, our mothers, let us place--our country,\" she exclaimed, lifting her own glass.  The colonel laughed as he drank his toast, saying, \"Nothing comes before country with Katharine.\"  And Seymour, while he appreciated the spirit of the maiden, felt a little pang of grief that even to a country he should be second,--an astonishing change from that spirit of humility which a moment since contented itself with metaphorically kissing the ground she walked upon.  \"By the way, father, where is Philip?\" asked Katharine.  \"He went up the branch fishing, with Bentley, I believe.\"  \"But is n't it time they returned?  Do you know, I feel nervous about them; suppose those raiders--\"  \"Pshaw, child!  Still harping on the raiders? and nervous too!  What ails you, daughter?  I thought you never were nervous.  We Wiltons are not accustomed to nervousness, you know, and what must our guest think?\"  \"Nothing but what is altogether agreeable,\" replied Seymour, a little too promptly; and then, to cover his confusion, he continued: \"But I think Miss Wilton need feel under no apprehension.  Master Philip is with Bentley, and I would trust the prudence and courage and skill of that man in any situation.  You know my father, who was a shipmaster, when he died aboard his ship in the China seas, gave me, a little boy taking a cruise with him, into Bentley's charge, and told him to make a sailor and a man of me, and from that day he has never left me.  At my house, in Philadelphia, he is a privileged character.  There never was a truer, better, braver man; and as for patriotism, love of country is a passion with him, colonel.  He might set an example to many in higher station in that particular.\"  \"Yes, I have noticed that peculiarity about the man.  I think Philip is safe enough with him, Katharine, even if those--  Ha! what is that?\" The colonel sprang to his feet, as the sound of a musket-shot rang out in the night air, followed by one or two pistol-shots and then a muffled cry.     CHAPTER IV  _Lord Dunmore's Men Pay an Evening Call_  \"Oh, father, it must be the raiders!  That was Blodgett's voice,\" cried Katharine, looking very pale and clasping her hands.  \"Let me go and investigate, colonel,\" said Seymour, leaping to his feet and seizing his sword.  \"Do so, Seymour,\" cried the colonel, as the sailor hastily left the room.  \"Phoebus,\" to the butler, \"go tell Caesar to call the slaves to the house.  You, Scipio,\" to one of the footmen, \"go open the arm-chest.  Katharine, reach me my sword.  See that the doors are closed, Billy,\" said the colonel to the other servant, rapidly and with perfect coolness.  \"I think, Katharine, that perhaps you would better retire to your room;\" but even as he spoke the sound of hurried footsteps and excited voices outside was heard.  After a few moments one of the field-hands, followed by Seymour, burst panting into the room, his mouth working with excitement and his eyes almost starting from his head.  \"Well, sir, what is it?\" said the colonel.  \"Foh de Lawd's sake, suh, dey'se a-comin', suh, dey'se a-comin'. Dey'se right behin' me; dey'll be heah in a minute, suh.\"  \"Who is coming, you idiot!\" exclaimed the colonel.  \"De redcoats, de British sojuhs, suh; dey 'se fohty boat-loads ob 'em; dey'se come off fum de lil' sloop out in de ribah, and dey 'se gwine kill we all, and bu'n de house down.  Dey done shot Mars' Blodgett, and dey'se coming heah special to get you, suh, Mars' Kunnel, kase I heahd dem say, when I was lyin' down on de wha'f, dat de man dey wanted was dat Kunnel Wilton.\"  \"It is quite true, sir; they seem to be a party of raiders of some sort,\" said Seymour, coolly.  \"I fear that Blodgett has been killed, as I heard nothing of him.  I saw them from the brow of the hill.  Perhaps you may escape by the back way, though there is little time for that. Do you take Miss Wilton and try it, sir; leave me to hold these men in play.\"  \"Yes, yes, father,\" urged Katharine; \"I know it must be Lord Dunmore's men and Johnson.  They know that you have come back from France, and now the man wants to take you prisoner.  You remember what the governor told you at Williamsburg, that he would make you rue the day you cast your lot in with the colonists and refused to assist him in the prosecution of his measures.  And you know we have been warned at least a dozen times about it.  Oh, what shall we do?  Do fly, and let me stay here and receive these men.\"  \"What! my daughter, do you think a Wilton has ever left his house to be defended by his guest and by a woman!  Seymour, I believe, however, as an officer in the service of our country, your best course is to leave while there is yet time.\"  \"I will never leave you, sir; I will stay here with you and Mistress Katharine, and share whatever fate may have in store for you.\"  But even as he spoke, the crowding footsteps of many men were heard at both entrances to the wide hall-way which ran through the house.  At the same moment the door was violently thrown open, and the dining-room was filled with an irregular mass of motley, ragged, red-coated men, whose reckless demeanor and hardened faces indicated that they had been recruited from the lowest and most depraved classes of the inhabitants of the colony.  They were led by a middle-aged man of dissipated appearance, whose rough and brutal aspect was not concealed by the captain's uniform he wore, nor was the malicious triumph in his bearing and in his voice veiled by the mock courtesy with which he advanced, pistol in hand.  \"What means this intrusion, sir?\" shouted Colonel Wilton, in a voice of thunder.  \"This is Colonel Wilton, I believe, is it not?\" said the leader of the band, taking off his hat.  \"Yes, sir, it is; you, Mr. Johnson, should be the last to forget it, and I desire to know at once the meaning of this outrageous descent upon a peaceful dwelling.\"  The man bowed low with mock courtesy.  \"I shall have to ask your pardon, my dear sir, for appearing before the great Colonel Wilton so unceremoniously.  But my orders, I regret to say, allow me no discretion whatever; they are imperative.  You are my prisoner.  I have been sent here by my Lord Dunmore, the governor of this colony of Virginia, to secure the persons of some of the principal rebellious subjects of his majesty King George, and your name, unfortunately, is the first and chiefest on the list.  I shall have to request you to accompany me at once.\"  The master of the situation smiled mockingly, and the colonel, white with anger, looked about the room.  Resistance was perfectly hopeless; all the windows even were now blocked up by the irregular soldiery.  \"He has chosen a fit man to do his work,\" said the colonel, in haughty scorn; \"failing gentlemen, he must needs take blackguards and bullies into his service as housebreakers and raiders.\"  Johnson flushed visibly, as he said with another bow, \"Colonel Wilton would better remember that I am master now.\"  \"Sir, I am not likely to forget it.  There is the family"]]]
