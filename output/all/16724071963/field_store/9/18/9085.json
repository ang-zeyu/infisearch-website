In doing so a large amount of gas is evolved, the movement of which causes the disturbance of the earth's crust, which manifests itself to us in the form of earthquakes. At the same time the confined gases seek an outlet, which they find at the weakest part, and the volcanoes spout forth the lava, flame, and gases. There is an undoubted connection between earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Earthquakes usually precede volcanic action. This internal combustion is going on at all times, and is only more violent at some period than at others. The lava in the Crater of Stromboli has been in a liquid state for more than two thousand years.\"  \"Before we left home I saw in a paper that some scientist described the kind of rock and other matter which was seven miles down in the earth.\"  \"Was anyone ever down as far as that?\"  \"No; a little over a mile is as far as man has actually penetrated the earth.\"  \"Then, I should like to know how geologists can tell with any certainty what the rock is like several miles down?\"  \"That is known just as positively as though a hole had been dug down that distance.\"  \"I don't see how that is possible.\"  \"I am going to make you a sketch which you can examine at leisure, that will show how he knows. Assuming that the earth has a crust--that is, the outside or cooled part, let the first sketch (Figure 10) represent this crust, before the mountains and valleys were formed. The slightly curved horizontal lines merely represent the different layers of the crust, such as rock, clay, coal, slate, and the like. When the cooling process took place the earth grew smaller within, so that the crust was forced together.  [Illustration: _Fig. 10. NORMAL CRUST OF THE EARTH_]  \"The second sketch (Figure 11) shows this crust forced together, so that when the upheaval took place, two mountain ranges, A and B, were formed, with a valley (C) between them, and the broken lines (D), where the crust separated, were exposed, and by that means examinations can be readily made way down into the crust, without ever leaving the surface of the earth.\"  As it was understood that the boys should take at least a day each week for hunting, particularly since such sport would develop expertness in the use of their weapons, an early start was made on the day selected, which was within a week of the time they returned home.  Ever since the disappearance of the boat left at the falls in South River, there was some anxiety on that score. It was a frequent topic of conversation, and after they left home it was by a mutual impulse that they wended their way south, taking a trail which was now familiar to them.  \"See here, Harry, I should like to go to the place where I discovered South River, and where I had the experience with the snake and the strange animal, which frightened me so.\"  [Illustration: _Fig. 11. MOUNTAIN UPHEAVAL_]  \"Then we must go to the left, because, you remember, you came up between these hills, and crossed the stream where I found you.\"  It was about three miles across from the Cataract house, but less from their original home. When they reached the river the surroundings were very much unlike anything George had seen before, and he could not identify the place where the ramie plant had been found.  The ocean could be seen plainly from their position, and George thought they were too far east, which proved to be the case.  \"Here it is, Harry; here is a low place, and you can see the ramie plant all about here. I am sure of it.\"  \"Is this the place you lost the hatchet?\"  \"So I did: I'll show you the place.\" But he failed to find the hatchet. Subsequently Harry stumbled across it, but it was found some distance from the place where George declared he lost it.  \"Let us try to cross the river. We can do it if we find a couple of logs.\"  At a bend of the river they found a lot of driftwood caught in the roots of a tree, and after some work a number of pieces were cut and laid crosswise on each other.  After the experiences of several expeditions of this kind, to say nothing of the exploring trips, the need of the bolo and ropes impressed itself on their minds. They were never without them.  The river at this point was fully one hundred feet wide, but by the aid of long poles the raft was not long in making the trip. After properly securing it they took up their weapons and at once made a dive for the interior.  The trees were fairly thick, and before going very far Harry checked George with the statement that there was game ahead, as he had heard rustling sounds in the leaves.  Both were now looking forward intently, expecting and hoping that some game worthy of attention would appear. Whenever they stopped, the animal, or what it was, would stop, to resume its motion whenever they moved. This was getting to be decidedly interesting, and at the same time trying to the hunters. The distance was fully a mile from the river. The noise which came from the slight rustling of the leaves and the occasional breaking of a twig was growing acute.  \"Are we hunting or being hunted?\" said George, under breath.  Not forgetting the Professor's story of the hunter's careful scrutiny of leaves, they adopted that plan, but it gave them no clue. Whatever it was, it was in front of them, but they were unable to get a glimpse of it.  Once, by agreement, they stopped and were silent for several minutes. The silence was just as profound and continued as their own. It was getting tense, when George hit upon a plan.  \"Let us be quiet for a minute or so, and then suddenly bound forward and give a whoop. I think that will frighten him, and enable us to sight him.\"  \"Before doing that get the guns ready for a shot, and don't fire too soon. Don't get excited. Remember the Professor's warning; a shot close at hand, deliberately aimed, is more positive than a dozen shots excitedly fired at a distance.\"  When all was ready Harry whispered, \"Now!\"  With a whoop both started forwardly on a run as fast as the dense underbrush would permit. Before they had gone twenty feet a large leopard-like animal sprang transversely across their path, then, seeing the boys, crouched for a spring. The guns were cocked and ready, and it is a wonder that in the excitement there was not a premature shot.  \"Now, steady,\" said Harry. \"Aim, fire!\" and the moment both shots rang out. Harry cried excitedly, \"Now for the other guns!\"  The other guns were not necessary then. The animal gave a savage growl and bounded to the left, and after they had time to recover, both moved toward the spot.  \"We have hit him, sure,\" was George's exultant shout. \"See the blood on the leaves. My! he was as big as a lion!\"  \"Let's follow him,\" was Harry's determination. And off they started, the blood tracks plainly showing the way. Not a further view was obtainable of the animal, and in less than a quarter of a mile all blood traces disappeared, to the chagrin of both.  They directed their steps toward the river, but within two hundred feet of the spot where they had last stopped, George stepped back and cried: \"There he is now, right ahead of us.\"  \"Let us be careful now; he may be angry.\" There was no alternative but to fire. The shots were almost at the same instant, and to their great relief the animal, after a single leap, fell down without a groan.  The approach was cautious, because experience had not taught them whether it was safe immediately to make an examination of the body. After some hesitation they went up closer, and when all doubts as to his death had been dispelled a careful examination was made.  They found only a single shot wound between the shoulders.  Here was a dilemma, surely enough. The river fully a half mile away, if not more, and the brute too large to carry, made them hesitate about attempting to skin it in the absence of the Professor.  \"I wish we knew what kind of an animal it is. We had better go home and bring the Professor back with us in the morning.\"  So taking note of the surroundings, to familiarize themselves with the location, they hurried back to the river, and rafted themselves over. The Cataract home was reached about four o'clock, after one of the most adventurous days spent on the island, although, in some respects, not as exciting as their earlier experiences. They had begun to be veterans. They were not merely boys.  Naturally, the Professor heard a stirring tale, and when it was all told over and over again, he told them he thought that undoubtedly the region beyond the river would turn out to be their hunting preserves, a statement which the boys did not forget to profit by, as we shall see later on.  \"I wonder why we haven't seen more animals north of the South River? There have been very few in this section,\" was George's observation.  \"Undoubtedly the mountain region affords them safer retreats, and it is one of the things which indicate to me that we shall find that section very wild, and when we are in shape to do so may be able to have some interesting and exciting times in that part of our domain,\" was the Professor's response.  \"But in South Africa wild animals are found in abundance on the plains.\"  \"True; but they have very thick brush, or cover, owing to the luxurious growth of vegetation. That affords them means for covering their retreat when attacked.\"  Following out the usual custom while on expeditions of this kind, they constantly, while on the way,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20588"],["title","The Wonder Island Boys: Exploring the Island (#8)"],["body","to examine specimens of plants and trees.  [Illustration: _Fig. 12. Branch of the Camphor Tree._]  \"Here is a branch, with the flower, of a tree, and the smell is very familiar.\"  \"That is from a camphor tree; do you not recognize it?\"  \"So it is; I know camphor is good for a great many things.\"  \"It would take some time to enumerate the things camphor is used for. Indeed, there are so many that Raspail, a French chemist, years ago found a system of medicine largely on the camphor plant, claiming that it was nature's universal remedy.\"  \"Here is a sample of plant which we found growing in bushes; there were also a few trees with the flowers. It is bitter to the taste.\"  \"This is the Calisaya, one of the varieties of the plant from which the well-known quinine is made. There are at least forty varieties of the plant. This is indeed a valuable find. But I see you have some beans there?\"  \"Yes; are they good to eat?\"  \"In South America, particularly in the Argentine Republic, it is eaten as a fruit, and the seeds are fed to cattle. Our yaks would relish them.\"  \"We saw them everywhere on the other side of the river.\"  \"The dry pulp of the seed is very nutritious, and is supposed to have been the food of St. John while in the wilderness, as it is the same kind of locust bean that grows in Palestine, and in various parts of Asia Minor. The Spanish name is Algoraba, or Carob-tree.\"  \"We have brought only one more sample, and it looks very familiar, but I never saw any beans or pods on it like this.\"  \"Don't you recognize Smilax? Of course, it is somewhat different from the kind you know. The root of this kind of Smilax is called Sarsaparilla, and the bean is good to eat.\"  \"Well, I am going to lay in a supply.\"  The boys could not forget the animal they had shot when morning came, so at the Professor's suggestion, they improvised a raft, which was loaded on the wagon, and a start made for the river.  Tethering the team the raft was launched, and the Professor accompanied them across. A light skid had been made for use in transporting the hide, so they would not be compelled to carry it the entire distance. Before they had reached the spot pointed out by the boys, they stumbled on the animal.  \"Why,\" said the Professor, \"this is an Ocelot, very dangerous when attacked, and just the kind of beast to elude you. I commend you for the good judgment in adopting the course you did.\"  \"See here, Harry; I don't understand this. You will remember when we examined him, just before leaving him here, that we found only one bullet hole between the shoulders; this has two bullet wounds, one in the head and the other in the neck.\"  \"Why this is not the place we shot him. This must have been shot by some one else.\"  \"Do you remember what you selected as your marking for the spot?\"  Harry looked about, and finally said: \"I remember two trees, standing about ten feet apart, east and west of each other.\"  \"That is the place, I am sure,\" was George's conclusion, after they had made a circuit around the spot; \"yes, I am sure those are the trees.\"  \"There it is; I see it.\"  Surely enough, close to the two trees an animal was found, larger than the one they had just left.  \"So it seems you killed two of them,\" and the Professor was so much amused he could not help laughing as he saw the amazement on the boys' countenances. \"You are certainly fine hunters.\"  \"I think--yes; here is the shot in the shoulder--this is the last one we shot. The other one, over there, was the one we followed so long and took our first shot at.\"  Within two hours the skins were ready, packed on the skid, and delivered at the raft, and after a hard forenoon's work the Cataract was reached shortly after noon.     CHAPTER VI  HUNTING VEGETABLES AND PLANTS   One night, while engaged in the usual evening discussion, many topics were mentioned, things connected with the day's adventures talked over, and plans for the following day considered.  As usual, George was the persistent questioner, but Harry was the one to utilize the meaning, and generally the first to take advantage in a practical way of the information thus obtained.  We have stated heretofore that George was the theorist and Harry the practical one. George delighted to delve down into mysteries; but Harry utilized the knowledge in constructing and building articles. Both, therefore, had useful accomplishments. To learn and to do are the great things in life.  During the day the boys had turned out a nice sample of bread, and George, as usual, began the questioning:  \"Professor, you said the other day, that fermentation caused a change in the dough, and that it was due to heat. I am curious to know why heat should cause it to ferment?\"  \"Heat develops bacteria, a tiny germ, which grows so rapidly in a short time, that millions are produced. These living organisms cause gases to form, and they continue to breed and grow and multiply so long as they have anything to feed on.\"  \"And we eat all that stuff and call it good?\"  \"Yes; and why not? Every part of your body contains the little creatures, and they really keep you alive, and preserve your health, as well as prevent diseases.\"  \"Why so?\"  \"Most germs are of the harmless type, and it is because of the vast numbers of the harmless ones that the few poisonous or disease germs are killed. Water has millions of them in every cubic inch. Professor Dewar, a great English chemist, calls them nature's policemen. If a typhoid fever germ, for example, should be introduced among so many germs, as is the case every day, a fight at once takes place, and where a person is finally attacked with the fever, it is because the germs escaped the policemen who were on duty.\"  \"That sounds like a romance.\"  \"Yes; the life history of those germs is really a wonderful thing, and books have been written about them. They exist in tribes, as it were; some of them can live only where oxygen is present, and some live on nitrogen only; others on carbon. But that is not all. Man has learned to use them, so they will work just as surely as our yaks work for us under our direction.\"  \"How interesting! In what way do we use them?\"  \"In what is called the septic system of treating sewage. You know that sewage from the kitchen contains all kinds of meat and vegetables, and the more it has fermented the stronger becomes the odor and the greater are the number of bacteria in the sewage. The sewage in the liquid state is first placed in a reservoir, and at a certain temperature the germs grow very rapidly, and, of course, eat up the vegetable and animal matter until it is nearly all consumed. Then it is run off into another reservoir which has another tribe of germs in it, those that live on carbon, and which are not harmful to man, and when these two tribes meet war is declared, and they fight to the death. The harmless germs are victorious in every battle, and when the sewage is discharged into a stream, or used for irrigating purposes, few, if any, of the harmful germs remain.\"  \"So in using germs the object is to cultivate one kind to kill another kind?\"  \"Not always; chemists have found out that man and animals absorb oxygen and expel nitrogen, in order to live; and that plants take in and live on nitrogen, and give out oxygen. They further learned that certain germs make nitrogen, just the same as we found that certain germs made carbonic gas in the dough; so that the United States Department of Agriculture, through its chemical division, concluded to set the germs to work, and the department will now send a box containing millions of the tiny creatures to any farmer who applies for them.\"  \"When they get them, how do they set them to work?\"  \"The germs are thrown into a tub of water, and the seed, like corn, is put into the water and allowed to remain for a certain length of time. When the seed is taken out, more or less of the germs remains on each kernel, and when it is put into the ground the germs keep on working, making nitrogen which the growing plant absorbs. It is wonderful to see the effect in a field where one row has these germ-infected seeds, and the other rows are not so treated.\"  It was now May, and the weather was slightly cooler, but there was neither snow nor frost. North of the equator it was growing warmer, because the winter had passed. Here the summer had gone, and winter was coming on. From every indication they were not in a cold climate.  \"Why do you think we shall not have any snow?\" was Harry's inquiry.  \"I notice too many trees, as well as shrubs and flowers, which could not live if we had frosts or freezing weather. Many of the trees about here do not shed their leaves, and the kind of animals which we now know exist here are sufficient evidence that we need not fear cold weather.\"  For more than a week the boys and the Professor put in their time prospecting in the hills and in carting various ores and mineralogical samples to their workshop.  The pelts which were on hand needed curing and besides there were also four yak pelts which had to be tanned, as shoe leather was badly needed. The hide originally dehaired was long ago ready for tanning, as well as the later ones.  \"What shall we use for the tanning process?\"  \"The bark of certain trees must be procured, so if you can find either oak, hemlock, birch or beech trees, we can probably make a tanning compound which will serve our purpose.\"  \"In what way will the bark of those trees tan the leather?\"  \"All the barks named contain what is called tannic acid. Other elements also are used, such as gallic acid, alum, sulphate of iron, and copper, salt, and other agents.\"  \"What are the chemicals for?\"  [Illustration: _Fig. 13. Tanning Vat._]  \"The tannic acid or the chemicals act on the skins, or, rather on the gelatin, glutin and albumen in the skins, and thus harden the texture and preserve it. Where tannin is not used and only the chemicals are employed, it is called 'tawing' the leather, instead of '"]]]
