The grandmother jumped up in her fright and asked him what that meant.  \"They have taken Heidi away,\" Peter said with a groan.  \"Who has, Peter? Where has she gone?\" the unhappy grandmother asked. Brigida had seen Deta walking up the footpath a short while ago and soon they guessed what had happened. With a trembling hand the old woman opened a window and called out as loudly as she could: \"Deta, Deta, don't take the child away. Don't take her from us.\"  When Heidi heard that she struggled to get free, and said: \"I must go to grandmother; she is calling me.\"  But Deta would not let her go. She urged her on by saying that she might return soon again. She also suggested that Heidi might bring a lovely present to the grandmother when she came back.  Heidi liked this prospect and followed Deta without more ado. After a while she asked: \"What shall I bring to the grandmother?\"  \"You might bring her some soft white rolls, Heidi. I think the black bread is too hard for poor grandmother to eat.\"  \"Yes, I know, aunt, she always gives it to Peter,\" Heidi confirmed her. \"We must go quickly now; we might get to Frankfurt today and then I can be back tomorrow with the rolls.\"     [Illustration: WHEN HEIDI HEARD THAT SHE STRUGGLED TO GET FREE]  Heidi was running now, and Deta had to follow. She was glad enough to escape the questions that people might ask her in the village. People could see that Heidi was pulling her along, so she said: \"I can't stop. Don't you see how the child is hurrying? We have still far to go,\" whenever she heard from all sides: \"Are you taking her with you?\" \"Is she running away from the uncle?\" \"What a wonder she is still alive!\" \"What red cheeks she has,\" and so on. Soon they had escaped and had left the village far behind them.  From that time on the uncle looked more angry than ever when he came to the village. Everybody was afraid of him, and the women would warn their children to keep out of his sight.  He came down but seldom, and then only to sell his cheese and buy his provisions. Often people remarked how lucky it was that Heidi had left him. They had seen her hurrying away, so they thought that she had been glad to go.  The old grandmother alone stuck to him faithfully. Whenever anybody came up to her, she would tell them what good care the old man had taken of Heidi. She also told them that he had mended her little house. These reports reached the village, of course, but people only half believed them, for the grandmother was infirm and old. She began her days with sighing again. \"All happiness has left us with the child. The days are so long and dreary, and I have no joy left. If only I could hear Heidi's voice before I die,\" the poor old woman would exclaim, day after day.  [Illustration]     VI  A NEW CHAPTER WITH NEW THINGS   In a beautiful house in Frankfurt lived a sick child by the name of Clara Sesemann. She was sitting in a comfortable rolling-chair, which could be pushed from room to room. Clara spent most of her time in the study, where long rows of bookcases lined the walls. This room was used as a living-room, and here she was also given her lessons.  Clara had a pale, thin face with soft blue eyes, which at that moment were watching the clock impatiently. At last she said: \"Oh Miss Rottenmeier, isn't it time yet?\"  The lady so addressed was the housekeeper, who had lived with Clara since Mrs. Sesemann's death. Miss Rottenmeier wore a peculiar uniform with a long cape, and a high cap on her head. Clara's father, who was away from home a great deal, left the entire management of the house to this lady, on the condition that his daughter's wishes should always be considered.  While Clara was waiting, Deta had arrived at the front door with Heidi. She was asking the coachman who had brought her if she could go upstairs.  \"That's not my business,\" grumbled the coachman; \"you must ring for the butler.\"  Sebastian, the butler, a man with large brass buttons on his coat, soon stood before her.  \"May I see Miss Rottenmeier?\" Deta asked.  \"That's not my business,\" the butler announced. \"Ring for Tinette, the maid.\" With that, he disappeared.  Deta, ringing again, saw a girl with a brilliant white cap on her head, coming down the stairway. The maid stopped half-way down and asked scornfully: \"What do you want?\"  Deta repeated her wish again. Tinette told her to wait while she went upstairs, but it did not take long before the two were asked to come up.  Following the maid, they found themselves in the study. Deta held on to Heidi's hand and stayed near the door.  Miss Rottenmeier, slowly getting up, approached the newcomers. She did not seem pleased with Heidi, who wore her hat and shawl and was looking up at the lady's headdress with innocent wonder.  \"What is your name?\" the lady asked.  \"Heidi,\" was the child's clear answer.  \"What? Is that a Christian name? What name did you receive in baptism?\" inquired the lady again.  \"I don't remember that any more,\" the child replied.  \"What an answer! What does that mean?\" said the housekeeper, shaking her head. \"Is the child ignorant or pert, Miss Deta?\"  \"I shall speak for the child, if I may, madam,\" Deta said, after giving Heidi a little blow for her unbecoming answer. \"The child has never been in such a fine house and does not know how to behave. I hope the lady will forgive her manners. She is called Adelheid after her mother, who was my sister.\"  \"Oh well, that is better. But Miss Deta, the child seems peculiar for her age. I thought I told you that Miss Clara's companion would have to be twelve years old like her, to be able to share her studies. How old is Adelheid?\"  \"I am sorry, but I am afraid she is somewhat younger than I thought. I think she is about ten years old.\"  \"Grandfather said that I was eight years old,\" said Heidi now. Deta gave her another blow, but as the child had no idea why, she did not get embarrassed.  \"What, only eight years old!\" Miss Rottenmeier exclaimed indignantly. \"How can we get along? What have you learned? What books have you studied?\"  \"None,\" said Heidi.  \"But how did you learn to read?\"  \"I can't read and Peter can't do it either,\" Heidi retorted.  \"For mercy's sake! you cannot read?\" cried the lady in her surprise. \"How is it possible? What else have you studied?\"  \"Nothing,\" replied Heidi, truthfully.  \"Miss Deta, how could you bring this child?\" said the housekeeper, when she was more composed.  Deta, however, was not easily intimidated, and said: \"I am sorry, but I thought this child would suit you. She _is_ small, but older children are often spoilt and not like her. I must go now, for my mistress is waiting. As soon as I can, I'll come to see how the child is getting along.\" With a bow she was outside and with a few quick steps hurried down-stairs.  Miss Rottenmeier followed her and tried to call her back, for she wanted to ask Deta a number of questions.  Heidi was still standing on the same spot. Clara had watched the scene, and called to the child now to come to her.  Heidi approached the rolling-chair.  \"Do you want to be called Heidi or Adelheid?\" asked Clara.  \"My name is Heidi and nothing else,\" was the child's answer.  \"I'll call you Heidi then, for I like it very much,\" said Clara. \"I have never heard the name before. What curly hair you have! Was it always like that?\"  \"I think so.\"  \"Did you like to come to Frankfurt?\" asked Clara again.  \"Oh, no, but then I am going home again to-morrow, and shall bring grandmother some soft white rolls,\" Heidi explained.  \"What a curious child you are,\" said Clara. \"You have come to Frankfurt to stay with me, don't you know that? We shall have our lessons together, and I think it will be great fun when you learn to read. Generally the morning seems to have no end, for Mr. Candidate comes at ten and stays till two. That is a long time, and he has to yawn himself, he gets so tired. Miss Rottenmeier and he both yawn together behind their books, but when I do it, Miss Rottenmeier makes me take cod-liver oil and says that I am ill. So I must swallow my yawns, for I hate the oil. What fun it will be now, when you learn to read!\"  Heidi shook her head doubtfully at these prospects.  \"Everybody must learn to read, Heidi. Mr. Candidate is very patient and will explain it all to you. You won't know what he means at first, for it is difficult to understand him. It won't take long to learn, though, and then you will know what he means.\"  When Miss Rottenmeier found that she was unable to recall Deta, she came back to the children. She was in a very excited mood, for she felt responsible for Heidi's coming and did not know how to cancel this unfortunate step. She soon got up again to go to the dining-room, criticising the butler and giving orders to the maid. Sebastian, not daring to show his rage otherwise, noisily opened the folding doors. When he went up to Clara's chair, he saw Heidi watching him intently. At last she said: \"You look like Peter.\"  Miss Rottenmeier was horrified with this remark, and sent them all into the dining-room. After Clara was lifted on to her chair, the housekeeper sat down beside her. Heidi was motioned to sit opposite the lady. In that way they were placed at the enormous table. When Heidi saw a roll on her plate, she turned to Sebastian, and pointing at it, asked, \"Can I have this?\" Heidi had already great confidence in the butler, especially on account of the resemblance she had discovered. The butler nodded, and when he saw Heidi put the bread in her pocket, could hardly keep from laughing. He came to Heidi now with a dish of small baked fishes. For a long time the child did not move; then turning her eyes to the butler, she said: \"Must I eat that?\" Sebastian nodded, but another pause ensued. \"Why don't you give it to me?\" the child quietly asked, looking at her plate. The butler, hardly able to keep his countenance, was told to place the dish on the table and leave the room.

Illustrated by MOREY     CHAPTER I    Pirates of Space   Apparently motionless to her passengers and crew, the Interplanetary liner _Hyperion_ bored serenely onward through space at normal acceleration. In the railed-off sanctum in one corner of the control room a bell tinkled, a smothered whirr was heard, and Captain Bradley frowned as he studied the brief message upon the tape of the recorder--a message flashed to his desk from the operator's panel. He beckoned, and the second officer, whose watch it now was, read aloud:    \"Reports of scout patrols still negative.\"  \"Still negative.\" The officer scowled in thought. \"They've already searched beyond the widest possible location of the wreckage, too. Two unexplained disappearances inside a month--first the _Dione_, then the _Rhea_--and not a plate nor a lifeboat recovered. Looks bad, sir. One might be an accident; two might possibly be a coincidence....\" His voice died away. What might that coincidence mean?  \"But at three it would get to be a habit,\" the captain finished the thought. \"And whatever happened, happened quick. Neither of them had time to say a word--their location recorders simply went dead. But of course they didn't have our detector screens nor our armament. According to the observatories we're in clear ether, but I wouldn't trust them from Tellus to Luna. You have given the new orders, of course?\"  \"Yes, sir. Detectors full out, all three courses of defensive screen on the trips, projectors manned, suits on the hooks. Every object detected in the outer space to be investigated immediately--if vessels, they are to be warned to stay beyond extreme range. Anything entering the fourth zone is to be rayed.\"  \"Right--we are going through!\"  \"But no known type of vessel could have made away with them without detection,\" the second officer argued. \"I wonder if there isn't something in those wild rumors we've been hearing lately?\"    [Illustration:      Now, systematically and precisely, the great Cone of     Battle was coming into being; a formation developed during     the Jovian Wars while the forces of the Three Planets were     fighting in space.]  \"Bah! Of course not!\" snorted the captain. \"Pirates in ships faster than light--fifth order rays--nullification of gravity--mass without inertia--ridiculous! Proved impossible, over and over again. No, sir, if pirates are operating in space--and it looks very much like it--they won't get far against a good big battery full of kilowatt-hours behind three courses of heavy screen, and a good solid set of multiplex rays. Properly used, they're good enough for anybody. Pirates, Neptunians, angels, or devils--in ships or on sunbeams--if they tackle the _Hyperion_ we'll burn them out of the ether!\"  Leaving the captain's desk, the watch officer resumed his tour of duty. The six great lookout plates into which the alert observers peered were blank, their far-flung ultra-sensitive detector screens encountering no obstacle--the ether was empty for thousands upon thousands of kilometers. The signal lamps upon the pilot's panel were dark, its warning bells were silent. A brilliant point of white in the center of the pilot's closely ruled micrometer grating, exactly upon the cross-hairs of his directors, showed that the immense vessel was precisely upon the calculated course, as laid down by the automatic integrating course-plotters. Everything was quiet and in order.  \"All's well, sir,\" he reported briefly to Captain Bradley--but all was not well.         *       *       *       *       *  Danger--more serious far in that it was not external--was even then, all unsuspected, gnawing at the great ship's vitals. In a locked and shielded compartment, deep down in the interior of the liner, was the great air purifier. Now a man leaned against the primary duct--the aorta through which flowed the stream of pure air supplying the entire vessel. This man, grotesque in full panoply of space armor, leaned against the duct, and as he leaned a drill bit deeper and deeper into the steel wall of the pipe. Soon it broke through, and the slight rush of air was stopped by the insertion of a tightly fitting rubber tube. The tube terminated in a heavy rubber balloon, which surrounded a frail glass bulb. The man stood tense, one hand holding before his silica-and-steel helmeted head a large pocket chronometer, the other lightly grasping the balloon. A sneering grin was upon his face as he awaited the exact second of action--the carefully pre-determined instant when his right hand, closing, would shatter the fragile flask and force its contents into the primary air stream of the _Hyperion_!         *       *       *       *       *  Far above, in the main saloon, the regular evening dance was in full swing. The ship's orchestra crashed into silence, there was a patter of applause and Clio Marsden, radiant belle of the voyage, led her partner out into the promenade and up to one of the observation plates.  \"Oh, we can't see the earth any more!\" she exclaimed. \"Which way do you turn this, Mr. Costigan?\"  \"Like this,\" and Conway Costigan, burly young first officer of the liner, turned the dials. \"There--this plate is looking back, or down, at Tellus; this other one is looking ahead.\"  Earth was a brilliantly shining crescent far beneath the flying vessel. Above her, ruddy Mars and silvery Jupiter blazed in splendor ineffable against a background of utterly indescribable blackness--a background thickly besprinkled with dimensionless points of dazzling brilliance which were the stars.  \"Oh, isn't it wonderful!\" breathed the girl, awed. \"Of course, I suppose that it's old stuff to you, but I--a ground-gripper, you know, and I could look at it forever, I think. That's why I want to come out here after every dance. You know, I ...\"  Her voice broke off suddenly, with a queer, rasping catch, as she seized his arm in a frantic clutch and as quickly went limp. He stared at her sharply, and understood instantly the message written in her eyes--eyes now enlarged, staring hard, brilliant, and full of soul-searing terror as she slumped down, helpless but for his support. In the act of exhaling as he was, lungs almost entirely empty, yet he held his breath until he had seized the microphone from his belt and had snapped the lever to \"emergency.\"  \"Control room!\" he gasped then, and every speaker throughout the great cruiser of the void blared out the warning as he forced his already evacuated lungs to absolute emptiness. \"Vee-Two Gas! Get tight!\"  Writhing and twisting in his fierce struggle to keep his lungs from gulping in a draft of that noxious atmosphere, and with the unconscious form of the girl draped limply over his left arm, Costigan leaped toward the portal of the nearest lifeboat. Orchestra instruments crashed to the floor and dancing couples fell and sprawled inertly while the tortured First Officer swung the door of the lifeboat open and dashed across the tiny room to the air-valves. Throwing them wide open, he put his mouth to the orifice and let his laboring lungs gasp their eager fill of the cold blast roaring from the tanks. Then, air-hunger partially assuaged, he again held his breath, broke open the emergency locker, donned one of the space-suits always kept there, and opened its valves wide in order to flush out of his uniform any lingering trace of the lethal gas.  He then leaped back to his companion. Shutting off the air, he released a stream of pure oxygen, held her face in it, and made shift to force some of it into her lungs by compressing and releasing her chest against his own body. Soon she drew a spasmodic breath, choking and coughing, and he again changed the gaseous stream to one of pure air, speaking urgently as she showed signs of returning consciousness. Now, it was Clio Marsden's life.  \"Stand up!\" he snapped. \"Hang onto this brace and keep your face in this air-stream until I get a suit around you! Got me?\"  She nodded weakly, and, assured that she could now hold herself at the valve, it was the work of only a minute to encase her in one of the protective coverings. Then, as she sat upon a bench, recovering her strength, he flipped on the lifeboat's visiphone projector and shot its invisible beam up into the control room, where he saw space-armored figures furiously busy at the panels.  \"Dirty work at the cross-roads!\" he blazed to his captain, man to man--formality disregarded, as it so often was in the Triplanetary service. \"There's skulduggery afoot somewhere in our primary air! Maybe that's the way they got those other two ships--pirates! Might have been a timed bomb--don't see how anybody could have stowed away down there through the inspections, and nobody but Franklin can neutralize the shield of the air-room--but I'm going to look around, anyway. Then I'll join you fellows up there.\"  \"What was it?\" the shaken girl asked. \"I think that I remember your saying 'Vee-Two gas.' That's forbidden! Anyway, I owe you my life, Conway, and I'll never forget it--never. Thanks--but the others--how about all the rest of us?\"  \"It was Vee-Two,"]]]
