But the majority of the poor scarcely cared, and would have grumbled at any rule.  For weeks Detroit was in a ferment with the moving out. There were sorrowful farewells. Many a damsel missed the lover to whom she had pinned her faith, many an irregular marriage was abruptly terminated. The good Recollet fathers had tried to impress the sacredness of family ties upon their flock, but since the coming of the English, the liberty allowed every one, and the Protestant form of worship, there had grown a certain laxness even in the town.  \"It is going to be a great day!\" declared Jeanne, as she sprang out of her little pallet. There were two beds in the room, a great, high-post carved bedstead of the Bellestre grandeur, and the cot Jacques Pallent, the carpenter, had made, which was four sawed posts, with a frame nailed to the top of them. It was placed in the corner, and so, out of sight, Pani felt that her charge was always safe. In the morning Jeanne generally turned a somersault that took her over to the edge of the big bed, from whence she slid down.  The English had abolished slavery in name, but most of the Pani servants remained. They seldom had any other than their tribal name. Since the departure of the Bellestres Jeanne's guardian had taken on a new dignity. She was a tall, grave woman, and much respected by all. No one would have thought of interfering with her authority over the child.  \"Hear the cannon at the Fort and the bells. And everybody will be out! Pani, give me some breakfast and let me go.\"  \"Nay, nay, child. You cannot go alone in such a crowd as this will be. And I must set the house straight.\"  \"But Marie De Ber and Pierre are to go. We planned it last night. Pierre is a big, strong boy, and he can pick his way through a crowd with his elbows. His mother says he always punches holes through his sleeves.\"  Jeanne laughed gayly. Pierre was a big, raw-boned fellow, a good guard anywhere.  \"Nay, child, I shall go, too. It will not be long. And here is a choice bit of bread browned over the coals that you like so much, and the corn mush of last night fried to a turn.\"  \"Let me run and see Marie a moment--\"  \"With that head looking as if thou hadst tumbled among the burrs, or some hen had scratched it up for a nest! And eyes full of dew webs that are spun in the grass by the spirits of night.\"  \"Look, they are wide open!\" She buried her face in a pail of water and splashed it around as a huge bird might, as she raised her beautiful laughing orbs, blue now as the midnight sky. And then she carelessly combed the tangled curls that fell about her like the spray of a waterfall.  \"Thou must have a coif like other French girls, Jeanne. Berthê Campeau puts up her hair.\"  \"Berthê goes to the Recollets and prays and counts beads, and will run no more or shout, and sings only dreary things that take the life and gayety out of you. She will go to Montreal, where her aunt is in a convent, and her mother cries about it. If I had a mother I would not want to make her cry. Pani, what do you suppose happened to my mother? Sometimes I think I can remember her a little.\"  The face so gay and willful a moment before was suddenly touched with a sweet and tender gravity.  \"She is dead this long time, _petite_. Children may leave their mothers, but mothers never give up their children unless they are taken from them.\"  \"Pani, what if the Indian woman had stolen me?\"  \"But she said you had no mother. Come, little one, and eat your breakfast.\"  Jeanne was such a creature of moods and changes that she forgot her errand to Marie. She clasped her hands together and murmured her French blessing in a soft, reverent tone.  Maize was a staple production in the new world, when the fields were not destroyed by marauding parties. There were windmills that ground it coarsely and both cakes and porridge were made of it. The Indian women cracked and pounded it in a stone mortar and boiled it with fish or venison. The French brought in many new ways of cooking.  \"Oh, hear the bells and the music from the Fort! Come, hurry, Pani, if you are going with us. Pani, are people slow when they get old?\"  \"Much slower, little one.\"  \"Then I don't want to be old. I want to run and jump and climb and swim. Marie knits, she has so many brothers and sisters. But I like leggings better in the winter. And they sew at the Recollet house.\"  \"And thou must learn to sew, little one.\"  \"Wait until I am big and old and have to sit in the chimney corner. There are no little ones--sometimes I am glad, sometimes sorry, but if they are not here one does not have to work for them.\"  She gave a bright laugh and was off like a flash. The Pani woman sighed. She wondered sometimes whether it would not have been better to give her up to the good father who took such an interest in her. But she was all the poor woman had to love. True she could be a servant in the house, but to have her wild, free darling bound down to rigid rules and made unhappy was more than she could stand. And had not Mr. Bellestre provided this home for them?  The woman had hardly put away the dishes, which were almost as much of an idol to her as the child, when Jeanne came flying back.  \"Yes, hurry, hurry, Pani! They are all ready. And Madame De Ber said Marie should not go out on such a day unless you went too. She called me feather headed! As if I were an Indian chief with a great crown of feathers!\"  The child laughed gayly. It was as natural to her as singing to a bird.  Pani gathered up a few last things and looked to see that the fire was put out.  Already the streets were being crowded and presented a picturesque aspect. Inside the stockade the _chemin du ronde_ extended nearly around the town and this had been widened by the necessity of military operations. Soldiers were pouring out of the Citadel and the Fort but the colonial costume looked queer to eyes accustomed to the white trimmings of the French and the red of the British. The latter had made a grander show many a time, both in numbers and attire. There were the old French habitans, gay under every new dispensation, in tanned leathern small clothes, made mostly of deer skin, and blue blouses, blue cap, with a red feather, some disporting themselves in unwonted finery kept for holiday occasions; pretty laughing demoiselles with bright kerchiefs or a scarf of open, knitted lace-like stuff with beads that sparkled with every coquettish turn of the head; there were Indians with belted tomahawks and much ornamented garments, gorgets and collars of rudely beaten copper or silver if they could afford to barter furs for them, half-breed dandies who were gorgeous in scarlet and jewelry of all sorts, squaws wrapped in blankets, looking on wonderingly, and the new possessors of Detroit who were at home everywhere.  The procession formed at the parade in front of the Fort. Some of the aristocracy of the place were out also, staid middle-aged men with powdered queues and velvet coats, elegant ladies in crimson silk petticoats and skirts drawn back, the train fastened up with a ribbon or chain which they carried on their arms as they minced along on their high heeled slippers, carrying enormous fans that were parasols as well, and wearing an immense bonnet, the fashion in France a dozen years before.  \"What is it all about?\" asked one and another.  \"They are to put up a new flag.\"  \"For how long?\" in derision. \"The British will be back again in no time.\"  \"Are there any more conquerors to come? We turn our coats at every one's bidding it seems.\"  The detachment was from General Wayne's command and great was the disappointment that the hero himself was not on hand to celebrate the occasion; but he had given orders that possession of the place should be signalized without him. Indeed, he did not reach Detroit until a month later.  On July 11, 1796, the American flag was raised above Detroit, and many who had never seen it gazed stupidly at it, as its red and white stripes waved on the summer air, and its blue field and white stars shone proudly from the flag staff, blown about triumphantly on the radiant air shimmering with golden sunshine.  Shouts went up like volleys. All the Michigan settlements were now a part of the United Colonies, that had so bravely won their freedom and were extending their borders over the cherished possessions of France and England.  The post was formally delivered up to the governor of the territory. Another flag was raised on the Citadel, which was for the accommodation of the general and his suite at present and whoever was commandant. It was quite spacious, with an esplanade in front, now filled by soldiers. There were the almost deafening salutes and the blare of the band.  \"Why it looks like heaven at night!\" cried Jeanne rapturously. \"I shall be an American,--I like the stars better than the lilies of France, and the red cross is hateful. For stars _are_ of heaven, you know, you cannot make them grow on earth.\"  A kindly, smiling, elderly man turned and caught sight of the eager, rosy face.  \"And which, I wonder, is the brave General Wayne?\"  \"He is not here to-day unfortunately and cannot taste the sweets of his many victories. But he is well worth seeing, and quite as sorry not to be here as you are to miss him. But he is coming presently.\"  \"Then it is not the man who is making a speech?--and see what a beautiful horse he has!\"  \"That is the governor, Major General St. Clair.\"  \"And General Wayne, is he an American?\"  The man gave an encouraging smile to the child's eager inquiry.  \"An American? yes. But look you, child. The only proper Americans would be the Indians.\"  She frowned and looked puzzled.  \"A little way back we came from England and France and Holland and Spain and Italy. We are so diverse that it is a wonder we can be harmonized. Only there seems something in this grand air, these mighty forests, these immense lakes and rivers, that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20721"],["title","A Little Girl in Old Detroit (#4)"],["body","liberty and independence and breadth of thought and action. Who would have dreamed that clashing interests could have been united in that one aim, liberty, and that it could spread itself from the little nucleus, north, south, east, and west! The young generation will see a great country. And I suppose we will always be Americans.\"  He turned to the young man beside him, who seemed amused at the enthusiasm that rang in his voice and shone in his eyes of light, clear blue as he had smiled down on the child who scarcely understood, but took in the general trend and was moved by the warmth and glow.  \"Monsieur, there are many countries beside England and France,\" she said thoughtfully.  \"O yes, a world full of them. Countries on the other side of the globe of which we know very little.\"  \"The other side?\" Her eyes opened wide in surprise, and a little crease deepened in the sunny brow as she flung the curls aside. She wore no hat of any kind in summer.  \"Yes, it is a round world with seas and oceans and land on both sides. And it keeps going round.\"  \"But, Monsieur,\" as he made a motion with his hand to describe it, \"why does not the water spill out and the ground slide off? What makes it--oh, how can it stick?\" with a laugh of incredulity.  \"Because a wisdom greater than all of earth rules it. Are there no schools in Detroit?\"  \"The English have some and there is the Recollet house and the sisters. But they make you sit still, and presently you go to Montreal or Quebec and are a nun, and wear a long, black gown, and have your head tied up. Why, I should smother and I could not hear! That is so you cannot hear wicked talk and the drunken songs, but I love the birds and the wind blowing and the trees rustling and the river rushing and beating up in a foam. And I am not afraid of the Indians nor the _shil loups_,\" but she lowered her tone a trifle.  \"Do not put too much trust in the Indians, Mam'selle. And there is the _loup garou_--\"  \"But I have seen real wolves, Monsieur, and when they bring in the furs there are so many beautiful ones. Madame De Ber says there is no such thing as a _loup garou_, that a person cannot be a man and a wolf at the same time. When the wolves and the panthers and the bears howl at night one's blood runs chilly. But we are safe in the stockade.\"  \"There is much for thee to learn, little one,\" he said, after a pause. \"There must be schools in the new country so that all shall not grow up in ignorance. Where is thy father?\"  Jeanne Angelot stared straight before her seeing nothing. Her father? The De Bers had a father, many children had, she remembered. And her mother was dead.  The address ended and there was a thundering roll of drums, while cheers went up here and there. Cautious French habitans and traders thought it wiser to wait and see how long this standard of stripes and stars would wave over them. They were used to battles and conquering and defeated armies, and this peace they could hardly understand. The English were rather sullen over it. Was this stripling of newfound liberty to possess the very earth?  The crowd surged about. Pani caught the arm of her young charge and drew her aside. She was alarmed at the steady scrutiny the young man had given her, though it was chiefly as to some strange specimen.  \"Thou art overbold, Jeanne, smiling up in a young man's face and puckering thy brows like some maid coquetting for a lover.\"  \"A young man!\" Jeanne laughed heartily. \"Why he had a snowy beard like a white bear in winter. Where were your eyes, Pani? And he told me such curious things. Is the world round, Pani? And there are lands and lands and strange people--\"  \"It is a brave show,\" exclaimed Louis Marsac joining them. \"I wonder how long it will last. There are to be some new treaties I hear about the fur trade. That man from the town called New York, a German or some such thing, gets more power every month. A messenger came this morning and I am to return to my father at once. Jeanne, I wish thou and Pani wert going to the upper lakes with me. If thou wert older--\"  She turned away suddenly. Marie De Ber had a group of older girls about her and she plunged into them, as if she might be spirited away.  Monsieur St. Armand had looked after his little friend but missed her in the crowd, and a shade of disappointment deepened his blue eyes.  \"_Mon père_,\" began the young man beside him, \"evidently thou wert born for a missionary to the young. I dare say you discovered untold possibilities in that saucy child who knows well how to flirt her curls and arch her eyebrows. She amused me. Was that half-breed her brother, I wonder!\"  \"She was not a half-breed, Laurent. There are curious things in this world, and something about her suggested--or puzzled. She has no Indian eyes, but the rarest dark blue I ever saw. And did Indian blood ever break out in curly hair?\"  \"I only noticed her swarthy skin. And there is such a mixed-up crew in this town! Come, the grand show is about over and now we are all reborn Americans up to the shores of Lake Superior. But we will presently be due at the Montdesert House. Are we to have no more titles and French nobility be on a level with the plainest, just Sieur and Madame?\" with a little curl of the lips. The elder smiled good naturedly, nay, even indulgently.  \"The demoiselles are more to thee than that splendid flag waving over a free country. Thou canst return--\"  \"But the dinner?\"  \"Ah, yes, then we will go together,\" he assented.  \"If we can pick our way through this crowd. What beggarly narrow streets. Faugh! One can hardly get his breath. Our wilds are to be preferred.\"  By much turning in and out they reached the upper end of St. Louis street, which at that period was quite an elevation and overlooked the river.     CHAPTER III.  ON THE RIVER.   The remainder of the day was devoted to gayety, and with the male population carousing in too many instances, though there were restrictions against selling intoxicants to the Indians inside the stockade. The Frenchman drank a little and slowly, and was merry and vivacious. Groups up on the Parade were dancing to the inspiriting music, or in another corner two or three fiddles played the merriest of tunes.  Outside, and the larger part of the town was outside now, the farms stretched back with rude little houses not much more than cabins. There was not much call for solidity when a marauding band of Indians might put a torch to your house and lay it in ashes. But with the new peace was coming a greater feeling of security.  There were little booths here and there where squaws were cooking sagamite and selling it in queer dishes made of gourds. There were the little maize cakes well-browned, piles of maple sugar and wild summer plums just ripening. The De Ber children, with Jeanne and Pani, took their dinner here and there out of doors with much merriment. It was here Marsac joined them again, his hands full of fruit, which he gave to the children.  \"Come over to the Strait,\" he exclaimed. \"That is a sight worth seeing. Everything is out.\"  \"O yes,\" cried Jeanne, eagerly. \"And, Louis, can you not get a boat or a canoe? Let us go out on the water. I'm tired of the heat and dust.\"  They threaded their way up to Merchants' wharf, for at King's wharf the crowd was great. At the dock yard, where, under the English, some fine vessels had been built, a few were flying pennons of red and white, and some British ships that had not yet left flaunted their own colors. As for the river, that was simply alive with boats of every description; Indian rowers and canoers, with loads of happy people singing, shouting, laughing, or lovers, with heads close together, whispering soft endearments or promising betrothal.  \"Stay here while I see if I can get a boat,\" said Louis, darting off, disappearing in the crowd.  They had been joined by another neighbor, Madame Ganeau and her daughter Delisse, and her daughter's lover, a gay young fellow.  \"He will have hard work,\" declared Jacques. \"I tried. Not a canoe or a pirogue or a flat boat. I wish him the joy of success.\"  \"Then we will have to paddle ourselves,\" said Jeanne. \"Or float, Marie. I can float beautifully when the tide is serene.\"  \"I would not dare it for a hundred golden louis d'or,\" interposed Delisse.  \"But Jeanne dares everything. Do you remember when she climbed the palisade? When one has a lover--\" and Marie sighed a little.  \"One comes to her senses and is no longer a child,\" said Madame Ganeau with a touch of sharpness in her voice. \"The saints alone know what will become of that wild thing. Marie, since your mother is so busy with her household, some one should look you up a lover. Thou art most fourteen if I remember rightly.\"  \"Yes, Madame.\"  \"Well, there is time to be sure. Delisse will be fifteen on her wedding day. That is plenty old enough. For you see the girl bows to her husband, which is as it should be. A girl well brought up should have no temper nor ways of her own and then she more easily drops into those of her husband, who is the head of the house.\"  \"I have a temper!\" laughed Jeanne. \"And I do not want any husband to rule over me as if I were a squaw.\"  \"He will rule thee in the end. And if thou triest him too far he may beat thee.\"  \"If he struck me I should--I should kill him,\" and Jeanne's eyes flashed fire.  \"Thou wilt have more sense, then. And if lovers are shy of thee thou wilt begin to long for them when thou art like a dried up autumn rose on its stem.\"  Jeanne bridled and flung up her chin.  Pierre took her soft hand in his rough one.  \"Do not mind,\" he said in a whisper; \"I would never beat you even if you did not have dinner ready. And I will bring you lovely furs and whatever you want. My father is willing to send me up in the fur country next year.\"  Jeanne laughed, then turned to sudden gravity and gave back the pressure of the hand in repentance.  \"You are so good to me, Pierre. But I do not want to marry in a long,"]]]
