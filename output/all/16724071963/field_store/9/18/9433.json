Seaton lay in exactly the same position, only the regular lifting of his powerful chest showing that he was alive.  \"I think we had better....\"  \"Sh ... sh,\" interrupted the girl in an intense whisper. \"You'll wake him up, Daddy.\"  \"Bosh! You couldn't wake him up with a club. His own name might rouse him, particularly if you said it; no other ordinary sound would. I started to say that I think we had better put him to bed on the davenport. He would be more comfortable.\"  \"But that would surely wake him. And he's so big....\"  \"Oh, no, it wouldn't, unless I drop him on the floor. And he doesn't weigh much over two hundred, does he?\"  \"About ten or eleven pounds.\"  \"Even though I am a lawyer, and old and decrepit, I can still handle that much.\"  With Dorothy anxiously watching the proceeding and trying to help, Vaneman picked Seaton up out of the chair, with some effort, and carried him across the room. The sleeping man muttered as if in protest at being disturbed, but made no other sign of consciousness. The lawyer then calmly removed Seaton's shoes and collar, while the girl arranged pillows under his head and tucked the blanket around him. Vaneman bent a quizzical glance upon his daughter, under which a flaming blush spread from her throat to her hair.  \"Well,\" she said, defiantly, \"I'm going to, anyway.\"  \"My dear, of course you are. If you didn't, I would disown you.\"  As her father turned away, Dorothy knelt beside her lover and pressed her lips tightly to his.  \"Good night, sweetheart,\" she murmured.  \"'Night,\" he muttered in his sleep, as his lips responded faintly to her caress.  Vaneman waited for his daughter, and when she appeared, the blush again suffusing her face, he put his arm around her.  \"Dorothy,\" he said at the door of her room, using her full name, a very unusual thing for him, \"the father of such a girl as you are hates to lose her, but I advise you to stick to that boy. Believe in him and trust him, no matter what happens. He is a real man.\"  \"I know it, Dad ... thank you. I had a touch of the blues today, but I never will again. I think more of his little finger than I do of all the other men I ever knew, put together. But how do you know him so well? I know him, of course, but that's different.\"  \"I have various ways of getting information. I know Dick Seaton better than you do--better than he knows himself. I have known all about every man who ever looked at you twice. I have been afraid once or twice that I would have to take a hand, but you saw them right, just as you see Seaton right. For some time I have been afraid of the thought of your marrying, the young men in your social set are such a hopeless lot, but I am not any more. When I hand my little girl over to her husband next October I can be really happy with you, instead of anxious for you. That's how well I know Richard Seaton.... Well, good night, daughter mine.\"  \"Good night, Daddy dear,\" she replied, throwing her arms around his neck. \"I have the finest Dad a girl ever had, and the finest ... boy. Good night.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was three o'clock the following afternoon when Seaton appeared in the laboratory. His long rest had removed all the signs of overwork and he was his alert, vigorous self, but when Crane saw him and called out a cheery greeting he returned it with a sheepish smile.  \"Don't say anything, Martin--I'm thinking it all, and then some. I made a regular fool of myself last night. Went to sleep in a chair and slept seventeen hours without a break. I never felt so cheap in my life.\"  \"You were worn out, Dick, and you know it. That sleep put you on your feet again, and I hope you will have sense enough to take care of yourself after this. I warn you now, Dick, that if you start any more of that midnight work I will simply call Dorothy over here and have her take charge of you.\"  \"That's it, Mart, rub it in. Don't you see that I am flat on my back, with all four paws in the air? But I'm going to sleep every night. I promised Dottie to go to bed not later than twelve, if I have to quit right in the middle of an idea, and I told her that I was coming out to see her every other evening and every Sunday. But here's the dope. I've got that missing factor in my theory--got it while I was eating breakfast this afternoon.\"  \"If you had eaten and slept regularly here and kept yourself fit you would have seen it before.\"  \"Yes, I guess that's right, too. If I miss a meal or a sleep from now on I want you to sand-bag me. But never mind that. Here's the explanation. We doped out before, you know, that the force is something like magnetism, and is generated when the coil causes the electrons of this specially-treated copper to vibrate in parallel planes. The knotty point was what could be the effect of a weak electric current in liberating the power. I've got it! It shifts the plane of vibration of the electrons!\"  \"It is impossible to shift that plane, Dick. It is fixed by physical state, just as speed is fixed by temperature.\"  \"No, it isn't. That is, it usually is, but in this case it may be shifted. Here's the mathematical proof.\"  So saying, Seaton went over to the drafting table, tacked down a huge sheet of paper, and sketched rapidly, explaining as he drew. Soon the two men were engaged in a profound mathematical argument. Sheet after sheet of paper was filled with equations and calculations, and the table was covered with reference books. After two hours of intense study and hot discussion Crane's face took on a look of dawning comprehension, which changed to amazement and then to joy. For the first time in Seaton's long acquaintance with him, his habitual calm was broken.  \"By George!\" he cried, shaking Seaton's hand in both of his. \"I think you have it! But how under the sun did you get the idea? That calculus isn't in any of the books. Where did you get it? Dick, you're a wonder!\"  \"I don't know how I got the idea, it merely came to me. But that Math is right--it's _got_ to be right, no other conclusion is possible. Now, if that calc. is right, and I know it is, do you see how narrow the permissible limits of shifting are? Look at equation 236. Believe me, I sure was lucky, that day in the Bureau. It's a wonder I didn't blow up the whole works. Suppose I hadn't been working with a storage cell that gave only four amperes at two volts? That's unusually low, you know, for that kind of work.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Crane carefully studied the equation referred to and figured for a moment.  \"In that case the limit would be exactly eight watts. Anything above that means instant decomposition?\"  \"Yes.\"  Crane whistled, a long, low whistle.  \"And that bath weighed forty pounds--enough to vaporize the whole planet. Dick, it cannot be possible.\"  \"It doesn't seem that way, but it is. It certainly makes me turn cold all over, though, to think of what might have happened. You know now why I wouldn't touch the solution again until I had this stuff worked out?\"  \"I certainly do. You should be even more afraid of it now. I don't mind nitroglycerin or T.N.T., but anything like that is merely a child's plaything compared to this. Perhaps we had better drop it?\"  \"Not in seven thousand years. The mere fact that I was so lucky at first proves that Fate intended this thing to be my oyster. However, I'll not tempt the old lady any farther. I'm going to start with one millionth of a volt, and will use a piece of copper visible only under a microscope. But there's absolutely no danger, now that we know what it is. I can make it eat out of my hand. Look at this equation here, though. That being true, it looks as though you could get the same explosive effect by taking a piece of copper which had once been partially decomposed and subjecting it to some force, say an extremely heavy current. Again under the influence of the coil, a small current would explode it, wouldn't it?\"  \"It looks that way, from those figures.\"  \"Say, wouldn't that make some bullet? Unstabilize a piece of copper in that way and put it inside a rifle bullet, arranged to make a short circuit on impact. By making the piece of copper barely visible you could have the explosive effect of only a few sticks of dynamite--a piece the size of a pea would obliterate New York City. But that's a long way from our flying-machine.\"  \"Perhaps not so far as you think. When we explore new worlds it might be a good idea to have a liberal supply of such ammunition, of various weights, for emergencies.\"  \"It might, at that. Here's another point in equation 249. Suppose the unstabilized copper were treated with a very weak current, not strong enough to explode it? A sort of borderline condition? The energy would be liberated, apparently, but in an entirely new way. Wonder what would happen? I can't see from the theory--have to work it out. And here's another somewhat similar condition, right here, that will need investigating. I've sure got a lot of experimental work ahead of me before I'll know anything. How're things going with you?\"  \"I have the drawings and blue-prints of the ship itself done, and working sketches of the commercial power-plant. I am working now on the details, such as navigating instruments, food, water, and air supplies, special motors, and all of the hundred and one little things that must be taken into consideration. Then, as soon as you get the power under control, we will have only to sketch in the details of the power-plant and its supports before we can begin construction.\"  \"Fine, Mart, that's great. Well, let's get busy!\"     CHAPTER IV  Steel Liberates Energy--Unexpectedly   DuQuesne was in his laboratory, poring over an abstruse article in a foreign journal of science, when Scott came breezily in with a newspaper in his hand, across the front page of which stretched great headlines.  \"Hello, Blackie!\" he called. \"Come down to earth and listen to this tale of mystery from that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20869"],["title","The Skylark of Space (#6)"],["body","-renowned fount of exactitude and authority, the _Washington Clarion_. Some miscreant has piled up and touched off a few thousand tons of T.N.T. and picric acid up in the hills. Read about it, it's good.\"  DuQuesne read:        MYSTERIOUS EXPLOSION!       MOUNTAIN VILLAGE WIPED OUT OF EXISTENCE!      TWO HUNDRED DEAD, NONE INJURED!       FORCE FELT ALL OVER WORLD. CAUSE UNKNOWN.      SCIENTISTS BAFFLED.       HARPER'S FERRY. March 26.--At 10: 23 A.M. today, the village of      Bankerville, about thirty miles north of this place, was totally      destroyed by an explosion of such terrific violence that      seismographs all over the world recorded the shock, and that      windows were shattered even in this city. A thick pall of dust and      smoke was observed in the sky and parties set out immediately. They      found, instead of the little mountain village, nothing except an      immense, crater-like hole in the ground, some two miles in diameter      and variously estimated at from two to three thousand feet deep. No      survivors have been found, no bodies have been recovered. The      entire village, with its two hundred inhabitants, has been wiped      out of existence. Not so much as a splinter of wood or a fragment      of brick from any of the houses can be found. Scientists are unable      to account for the terrific force of the explosion, which far      exceeded that of the most violent explosive known.  \"Hm ... m. That sounds reasonable, doesn't it?\" asked DuQuesne, sarcastically, as he finished reading.  \"It sure does,\" replied Scott, grinning. \"What'd'you suppose it was? Think the reporter heard a tire blow out on Pennsylvania Avenue?\"  \"Perhaps. Nothing to it, anyway,\" as he turned back to his work.  As soon as the visitor had gone a sneering smile spread over DuQuesne's face and he picked up his telephone.  \"The fool did it. That will cure him of sucking eggs!\" he muttered. \"Operator? DuQuesne speaking. I am expecting a call this afternoon. Please ask him to call me at my house.... Thank you.\"  \"Fred,\" he called to his helper, \"if anyone wants me, tell them that I have gone home.\"  He left the building and stepped into his car. In less than half an hour he arrived at his house on Park Road, overlooking beautiful Rock Creek Park. Here he lived alone save for an old colored couple who were his servants.  In the busiest part of the afternoon Chambers rushed unannounced into Brookings' private office. His face was white as chalk.  \"Read that, Mr. Brookings!\" he gasped, thrusting the _Clarion_ extra into his hand.  Brookings read the news of the explosion, then looked at his chief chemist, his face turning gray.  \"Yes, sir, that was our laboratory,\" said Chambers, dully.  \"The fool! Didn't you tell him to work with small quantities?\"  \"I did. He said not to worry, that he was taking no chances, that he would never have more than a gram of copper on hand at once in the whole laboratory.\"  \"Well ... I'll ... be ... damned!\" Slowly turning to the telephone, Brookings called a number and asked for Doctor DuQuesne, then called another.  \"Brookings speaking. I would like to see you this afternoon. Will you be at home?... I'll be there in about an hour. Good bye.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When Brookings arrived he was shown into DuQuesne's study. The two men shook hands perfunctorily and sat down, the scientist waiting for the other to speak.  \"Well, DuQuesne, you were right. Our man couldn't handle it. But of course you didn't mean the terms you mentioned before?\"  DuQuesne's lips smiled; a hard, cold smile.  \"You know what I said, Brookings. Those terms are now doubled, twenty thousand and ten million. Nothing else goes.\"  \"I expected it, since you never back down. The Corporation expects to pay for its mistakes. We accept your terms and I have contracts here for your services as research director, at a salary of two hundred and forty thousand dollars per annum, with the bonus and royalties you demand.\"  DuQuesne glanced over the documents and thrust them into his pocket.  \"I'll go over these with my attorney to-night, and mail one back to you if he approves the contract. In the meantime, we may as well get down to business.\"  \"What would you suggest?\" asked Brookings.  \"You people stole the solution, I see....\"  \"Don't use such harsh language, Doctor, it's....\"  \"Why not? I'm for direct action, first, last and all the time. This thing is too important to permit of mincing words or actions, it's a waste of time. Have you the solution here?\"  \"Yes, here it is,\" drawing the bottle from his pocket.  \"Where's the rest of it?\" asked DuQuesne as he noted the size of the bottle.  \"All that we found is here, except about a teaspoonful which the expert had to work on,\" replied Brookings. \"We didn't get it all, only half of it. The rest of it was diluted with water, so that it wouldn't be missed. After we get started, if you find it works out satisfactorily, we can procure the rest of it. That will certainly cause a disturbance, but it may be necessary....\"  \"Half of it!\" interrupted DuQuesne. \"You haven't one-twentieth of it here. When I saw it in the Bureau, Seaton had about five hundred milliliters--over a pint--of it. I wonder if you're double-crossing me again?\"  \"No, you're not,\" he continued, paying no attention to the other's protestations of innocence. \"You're paying me too much to want to block me now. The crook you sent out to get the stuff turned in only this much. Do you suppose he is holding out on us?\"  \"No. You know Perkins and his methods.\"  \"He missed the main bottle, then. That's where your methods make me tired. When I want anything done, I believe in doing it myself, then I know it's done right. As to what I suggest, that's easy. I will take three or four of Perkins' gunmen tonight. We'll go out there and raid the place. We'll shoot Seaton and anybody else who gets in the way. We'll dynamite the safe and take their solution, plans, notes, money, and anything else we want.\"  \"No, no, Doctor, that's too crude altogether. If we have to do that, let it be only as a last resort.\"  \"I say do it first, then we know we will get results. I tell you I'm afraid of pussyfooting and gumshoeing around Seaton and Crane. I used to think that Seaton was easy, but he seems to have developed greatly in the last few weeks, and Crane never was anybody's fool. Together they make a combination hard to beat. Brute force, applied without warning, is our best bet, and there's no danger, you know that. We've got away clean with lots worse stuff.\"  \"It's always dangerous, and we could wink at such tactics only after everything else has failed. Why not work it out from this solution we have, and then quietly get the rest of it? After we have it worked out, Seaton might get into an accident on his motorcycle, and we could prove by the state of development of our plans that we discovered it long ago.\"  \"Because developing the stuff is highly dangerous, as you have found out. Even Seaton wouldn't have been alive now if he hadn't had a lot of luck at the start. Then, too, it would take too much time. Seaton has already developed it--you see, I haven't been asleep and I know what he has done, just as well as you do--and why should we go through all that slow and dangerous experimental work when we can get their notes and plans as well as not? There is bound to be trouble anyway when we steal all their solution, even though they haven't missed this little bit of it yet, and it might as well come now as any other time. The Corporation is amply protected, and I am still a Government chemist. Nobody even suspects that I am in on this deal. I will never see you except after hours and in private, and will never come near your offices. We will be so cautious that, even if anyone should get suspicious, they can't possibly link us together, and until they do link us together, we are all safe. No, Brookings, a raid in force is the only sure and safe way. What is more natural than a burglary of a rich man's house? It will be a simple affair. The police will stir around for a few days, then it will all be forgotten and we can go ahead. Nobody will suspect anything except Crane, if he is alive, and he won't be able to do anything.\"  So the argument raged. Brookings was convinced that DuQuesne was right in wanting to get possession of all the solution, and also of the working notes and plans, but would not agree to the means suggested, holding out for quieter and more devious, but less actionable methods. Finally he ended the argument with a flat refusal to countenance the raid, and the scientist was forced to yield, although he declared that they would have to use his methods in the end, and that it would save time, money, and perhaps lives, if they were used first. Brookings then took from his pocket his wireless and called Perkins. He told him of the larger bottle of solution, instructing him to secure it and to bring back all plans, notes, and other material he could find which in any way pertained to the matter in hand. Then, after promising DuQuesne to keep him informed of developments, and giving him an instrument similar to the one he himself carried, Brookings took his leave.         *       *       *       *       *  Seaton had worked from early morning until late at night, but had rigorously kept his promise to Dorothy. He had slept seven or eight hours every night and had called upon her regularly, returning from the visits with ever-keener zest for his work.  Late in the afternoon, upon the day of the explosion, Seaton stepped into Crane's shop with a mass of notes in his hand.  \"Well, Mart, I've got it--some of it, at least. The power is just what we figured it, so immensely large as to be beyond belief. I have found:  \"First: That it is a practically irresistible _pull_ along the axis of the treated wire or bar. It is apparently focused at infinity, as near-by objects are not affected.  \"Second: I have"]]]
