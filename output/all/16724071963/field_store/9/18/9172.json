He glanced up quickly, to see two long black troop carriers, emblazoned with the Sun and Cogwheel and armored fist of Security, pass back of the Octagon Tower and let down on the north landing stage. A third followed. He rose quickly.  \"Please remain seated, gentlemen, and continue with the luncheon. If you will excuse me for a moment, I'll be back directly.\" I hope, he added mentally.         *       *       *       *       *  Captain-General Dorflay, surrounded by a dozen officers, Thoran and human, had arrived on the lower terrace at the base of the Octagon Tower. They had a full Thoran rifle company with them. As he went down to them, Dorflay hurried forward.  \"It has come, Your Majesty!\" he said, as soon as he could make himself heard without raising his voice. \"We are all ready to die with Your Majesty!\"  \"Oh, I doubt it'll come quite to that, Harv,\" he said. \"But just to be on the safe side, take that company and the gentlemen who are with you and get up to the mountains and join the Crown Prince and his party. Here.\" He took a notepad from his belt pouch and wrote rapidly, sealing the note and giving it to Dorflay. \"Give this to His Highness, and place yourself under his orders. I know; he's just a boy, but he has a good head. Obey him exactly in everything, but under no circumstances return to the Palace or allow him to return until I call you.\"  \"Your Majesty is ordering me away?\" The old soldier was aghast.  \"An emperor who has a son can be spared. An emperor's son who is too young to marry can't. You know that.\"  Harv Dorflay was only mad on one subject, and even within the frame of his madness he was intensely logical. He nodded. \"Yes, Your Imperial Majesty. We both serve the Empire as best we can. And I will guard the little Princess Olva, too.\" He grasped Paul's hand, said, \"Farewell, Your Majesty!\" and dashed away, gathering his staff and the company of Thorans as he went. In an instant, they had vanished down the nearest rampway.  The emperor watched their departure, and, at the same time, saw a big black aircar, bearing the three-mooned planet, argent on sable, of Travann, let down onto the south landing stage, and another troop carrier let down after it. Four men left the aircar--Yorn, Prince Travann, and three officers in the black of the Security Guard. Prince Ganzay had also left the table: he came from one direction as Prince Travann advanced from the other. They converged on the emperor.  \"What's happening here, Prince Travann?\" Prince Ganzay demanded. \"Why are you bringing all these troops to the Palace?\"  \"Your Majesty,\" Prince Travann said smoothly, \"I trust that you will pardon this disturbance. I'm sure nothing serious will happen, but I didn't dare take chances. The students from the University are marching on the Palace--perfectly peaceful and loyal procession; they're bringing a petition for Your Majesty--but on the way, while passing through a nonworkers' district, they were attacked by a gang of hooligans connected with a voting-bloc boss called Nutchy the Knife. None of the students were hurt, and Colonel Handrosan got the procession out of the district promptly, and then dropped some of his men, who have since been re-enforced, to deal with the hooligans. That's still going on, and these riots are like forest fires; you never know when they'll shift and get out of control. I hope the men I brought won't be needed here. Really, they're a reserve for the riot work; I won't commit them, though, until I'm sure the Palace is safe.\"  He nodded. \"Prince Travann, how soon do you estimate that the student procession will arrive here?\" he asked.  \"They're coming on foot, Your Majesty. I'd give them an hour, at least.\"  \"Well, Prince Travann, will you have one of your officers see that the public-address screen in front is ready; I'll want to talk to them when they arrive. And meanwhile, I'll want to talk to Chancellor Khane, Professor Dandrik, Professor Faress and Colonel Handrosan, together. And Count Tammsan, too; Prince Ganzay, will you please screen him and invite him here immediately?\"  \"Now, Your Majesty?\" At first, the Prime Minister was trying to suppress a look of incredulity; then he was trying to keep from showing comprehension. \"Yes, Your Majesty; at once.\" He frowned slightly when he saw two of the Security Guard officers salute Prince Travann instead of the emperor before going away. Then he turned and hurried toward the Octagon Tower.         *       *       *       *       *  The officer who had gone to the aircar to use the radio returned and reported that Colonel Handrosan was bringing the Chancellor and both professors from the University in his command-car, having anticipated that they would be wanted. Paul nodded in pleasure.  \"You have a good man there, Prince,\" he said. \"Keep an eye on him.\"  \"I know it, Your Majesty. To tell the truth, it was he who organized this march. Thought they'd be better employed coming here to petition you than milling around the University getting into further mischief.\"  The other officer also returned, bringing a portable viewscreen with him on a contragravity-lifter. By this time, the Bench of Counselors and the three off-planet guests had become anxious and left the luncheon pavilion in a body. The Counselors were looking about uneasily, noticing the black uniformed Security Guards who had left the troop carrier and were taking position by squads all around the emperor. First Citizen Yaggo, and King Ranulf and Lord Koreff, also seemed uneasy. They were avoiding the proximity of Paul as though he had the green death.  The viewscreen came on, and in it the city, as seen from an aircar at two thousand feet, spread out with the Palace visible in the distance, the golden pile of the Octagon Tower jutting up from it. The car carrying the pickup was behind the procession, which was moving toward the Palace along one of the broad skyways, with Gendarmes and Security Guards leading, following and flanking. There were a few Imperial and planetary and school flags, but none of the quantity-made banners and placards which always betray a planned demonstration.  Prince Ganzay had been gone for some time, now. When he returned, he drew Paul aside.  \"Your Majesty,\" he whispered softly, \"I tried to summon Army troops, but it'll be hours before any can get here. And the Militia can't be mobilized in anything less than a day. There are only five thousand Army Regulars on Odin, now, anyhow.\"  And half of them officers and noncoms of skeleton regiments. Like the Navy, the Army had been scattered all over the Empire--on Behemoth and Amida and Xipetotec and Astarte and Jotunnheim--in response to calls for support from Security.  \"Let's have a look at this rioting, Prince Travann,\" one of the less decrepit Counselors, a retired general, said. \"I want to see how your people are handling it.\"  The officers who had come with Prince Travann consulted briefly, and then got another pickup on the screen. This must have been a regular public pickup, on the front of a tall building. It was a couple of miles farther away; the Palace was visible only as a tiny glint from the Octagon Tower, on the skyline. Half a dozen Security aircars were darting about, two of them chasing a battered civilian vehicle and firing at it. On rooftops and terraces and skyways, little clumps of Security Guards were skirmishing, dodging from cover to cover, and sometimes individuals or groups in civilian clothes fired back at them. There was a surprising absence of casualties.  \"Your Majesty!\" the old general hissed in a scandalized whisper. \"That's nothing but a big fake! Look, they're all firing blanks! The rifles hardly kick at all, and there's too much smoke for propellant-powder.\"  \"I noticed that.\" This riot must have been carefully prepared, long in advance. Yet the student riot seemed to have been entirely spontaneous. That puzzled him; he wished he knew just what Yorn Travann was up to. \"Just keep quiet about it,\" he advised.         *       *       *       *       *  More aircars were arriving, big and luxurious, emblazoned with the arms of some of the most distinguished families in Asgard. One of the first to let down bore the device of Duklass, and from it the Minister of Economics, the Minister of Education, and a couple of other Ministers, alighted. Count Duklass went at once to Prince Travann, drawing him away from King Ranulf and Lord Koreff and talking to him rapidly and earnestly. Count Tammsan approached at a swift half-run.  \"Save Your Majesty!\" he greeted, breathlessly. \"What's going on, sir? We heard something about some petty brawl at the University, that Prince Ganzay had become alarmed about, but now there seems to be fighting all over the city. I never saw anything like it; on the way here we had to go up to ten thousand feet to get over a battle, and there's a vast crowd on the Avenue of the Arts, and----\" He took in the Security Guards. \"Your Majesty, just what _is_ going on?\"  \"Great and frightening changes.\" Count Tammsan started; he must have been to a psi-medium, too. \"But I think the Empire is going to survive them. There may even be a few improvements, before things are done.\"  A blue-uniformed Gendarme officer approached Prince Travann, drawing him away from Count Duklass and speaking briefly to him. The Minister of Security nodded, then turned back to the Minister of Economics. They talked for a few moments longer, then clasped hands, and Travann left Duklass with his face wreathed in smiles. The Gendarme officer accompanied him as he approached.  \"Your Majesty, this is Colonel Handrosan, the officer who handled the affair at the University.\"  \"And a very good piece of work, colonel.\" He shook hands with him. \"Don't be surprised if it's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20659"],["title","Ministry of Disturbance (#6)"],["body","next Honors Day. Did you bring Khane and the two professors?\"  \"They're down on the lower landing-stage, Your Majesty. We're delaying the students, to give Your Majesty time to talk to them.\"  \"We'll see them now. My study will do.\" The officer saluted and went away. He turned to Count Tammsan. \"That's why I asked Prince Ganzay to invite you here. This thing's become too public to be ignored; some sort of action will have to be taken. I'm going to talk to the students; I want to find out just what happened before I commit myself to anything. Well, gentlemen, let's go to my study.\"  Count Tammsan looked around, bewildered. \"But I don't understand----\" He fell into step with Paul and the Minister of Security; a squad of Security Guards fell in behind them. \"I don't understand what's happening,\" he complained.  An emperor about to have his throne yanked out from under him, and a minister about to stage a _coup d'etat_, taking time out to settle a trifling academic squabble. One thing he did understand, though, was that the Ministry of Education was getting some very bad publicity at a time when it could be least afforded. Prince Travann was telling him about the hooligans' attack on the marching students, and that worried him even more. Nonworking hooligans acted as voting-bloc bosses ordered; voting-bloc bosses acted on orders from the political manipulators of Cartels and pressure-groups, and action downward through the nonworkers was usually accompanied by action upward through influences to which ministers were sensitive.         *       *       *       *       *  There were a dozen Security Guards in black tunics, and as many Household Thorans in red kilts, in the hall outside the study, fraternizing amicably. They hurried apart and formed two ranks, and the Thoran officer with them saluted.  Going into the study, he went to his desk; Count Tammsan lit a cigarette and puffed nervously, and sat down as though he were afraid the chair would collapse under him. Prince Travann sank into another chair and relaxed, closing his eyes. There was a bit of wafer on the floor by Paul's chair, dropped by the little dog that morning. He stooped and picked it up, laying it on his desk, and sat looking at it until the door screen flashed and buzzed. Then he pressed the release button.  Colonel Handrosan ushered the three University men in ahead of him--Khane, with a florid, arrogant face that showed worry under the arrogance; Dandrik, gray-haired and stoop-shouldered, looking irritated; Faress, young, with a scrubby red mustache, looking bellicose. He greeted them collectively and invited them to sit, and there was a brief uncomfortable silence which everybody expected him to break.  \"Well, gentlemen,\" he said, \"we want to get the facts about this affair in some kind of order. I wish you'd tell me, as briefly and as completely as possible, what you know about it.\"  \"There's the man who started it!\" Khane declared, pointing at Faress.  \"Professor Faress had nothing to do with it,\" Colonel Handrosan stated flatly. \"He and his wife were in their apartment, packing to move out, when it started. Somebody called him and told him about the fighting at the stadium, and he went there at once to talk his students into dispersing. By that time, the situation was completely out of hand; he could do nothing with the students.  \"Well, I think we ought to find out, first of all, why Professor Faress was dismissed,\" Prince Travann said. \"It will take a good deal to convince me that any teacher able to inspire such loyalty in his students is a bad teacher, or deserves dismissal.\"  \"As I understand,\" Paul said, \"the dismissal was the result of a disagreement between Professor Faress and Professor Dandrik about an experiment on which they were working. I believe, an experiment to fix more exactly the velocity of accelerated subnucleonic particles. Beta micropositos, wasn't it, Chancellor Khane?\"  Khane looked at him in surprise. \"Your Majesty, I know nothing about that. Professor Dandrik is head of the physics department; he came to me, about six months ago, and told me that in his opinion this experiment was desirable. I simply deferred to his judgment and authorized it.\"  \"Your Majesty has just stated the purpose of the experiment,\" Dandrik said. \"For centuries, there have been inaccuracies in mathematical descriptions of subnucleonic events, and this experiment was undertaken in the hope of eliminating these inaccuracies.\" He went into a lengthy mathematical explanation.  \"Yes, I understand that, professor. But just what was the actual experiment, in terms of physical operations?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dandrik looked helpless for a moment. Faress, who had been choking back a laugh, interrupted:  \"Your Majesty, we were using the big turbo-linear accelerator to project fast micropositos down an evacuated tube one kilometer in length, and clocking them with light, the velocity of which has been established almost absolutely. I will say that with respect to the light, there were no observable inaccuracies at any time, and until the micropositos were accelerated to 16.067543333-1/3 times light-speed, they registered much as expected. Beyond that velocity, however, the target for the micropositos began registering impacts before the source registered emission, although the light target was still registering normally. I notified Professor Dandrik about this, and----\"  \"You notified him. Wasn't he present at the time?\"  \"No, Your Majesty.\"  \"Your Majesty, I am head of the physics department of the University. I have too much administrative work to waste time on the technical aspects of experiments like this,\" Dandrik interjected.  \"I understand. Professor Faress was actually performing the experiment. You told Professor Dandrik what had happened. What then?\"  \"Why, Your Majesty, he simply declared that the limit of accuracy had been reached, and ordered the experiment dropped. He then reported the highest reading before this anticipation effect was observed as the newly established limit of accuracy in measuring the velocity of accelerated micropositos, and said nothing whatever in his report about the anticipation effect.\"  \"I read a summary of the report. Why, Professor Dandrik, did you omit mentioning this slightly unusual effect?\"  \"Why, because the whole thing was utterly preposterous, that's why!\" Dandrik barked; and then hastily added, \"Your Imperial Majesty.\" He turned and glared at Faress; professors do not glare at galactic emperors. \"Your Majesty, the limit of accuracy had been reached. After that, it was only to be expected that the apparatus would give erratic reports.\"  \"It might have been expected that the apparatus would stop registering increased velocity relative to the light-speed standard, or that it would begin registering disproportionately,\" Faress said. \"But, Your Majesty, I'll submit that it was not to be expected that it would register impacts before emissions. And I'll add this. After registering this slight apparent jump into the future, there was no proportionate increase in anticipation with further increase of acceleration. I wanted to find out why. But when Professor Dandrik saw what was happening, he became almost hysterical, and ordered the accelerator shut down as though he were afraid it would blow up in his face.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I think it has blown up in his face,\" Prince Travann said quietly. \"Professor, have you any theory, or supposition, or even any wild guess, as to how this anticipation effect occurs?\"  \"Yes, Your Highness. I suspect that the apparent anticipation is simply an observational illusion, similar to the illusion of time-reversal experienced when it was first observed, though not realized, that positrons sometimes exceeded light-speed.\"  \"Why, that's what I've been saying all along!\" Dandrik broke in. \"The whole thing is an illusion, due----\"  \"To having reached the limit of observational accuracy; I understand, Professor Dandrik. Go on, Professor Faress.\"  \"I think that beyond 16.067543333-1/3 times light-speed, the micropositos ceased to have any velocity at all, velocity being defined as rate of motion in four-dimensional space-time. I believe they moved through the three spatial dimensions without moving at all in the fourth, temporal, dimension. They made that kilometer from source to target, literally, in nothing flat. Instantaneity.\"  That must have been the first time he had actually come out and said it. Dandrik jumped to his feet with a cry that was just short of being a shriek.  \"He's crazy! Your Majesty, you mustn't ... that is, well, I mean--Please, Your Majesty, don't listen to him. He doesn't know what he's saying. He's raving!\"  \"He knows perfectly well what he's saying, and it probably scares him more than it does you. The difference is that he's willing to face it and you aren't.\"  The difference was that Faress was a scientist and Dandrik was a science teacher. To Faress, a new door had opened, the first new door in eight hundred years. To Dandrik, it threatened invalidation of everything he had taught since the morning he had opened his first class. He could no longer say to his pupils, \"You are here to learn from me.\" He would have to say, more humbly, \"_We_ are here to learn from the Universe.\"  It had happened so many times before, too. The comfortable and established Universe had fitted all the known facts--and then new facts had been learned that wouldn't fit it. The third planet of the Sol system had once been the center of the Universe, and then Terra, and Sol, and even the galaxy, had been forced to abdicate centricity. The atom had been indivisible--until somebody divided it. There had been intangible substance that had permeated the Universe, because it had been necessary for the transmission of light--until it was demonstrated to be unnecessary and nonexistent. And the speed of light had been the ultimate"]]]
