I presume, from what I know of your habits, that will not be overlooked by you.\"  \"Quite so,\" he returned; \"it will doubtless be a welcome contribution to the treasury of his majesty's colony.  Mistress Wilton's diamonds also,\" he said meaningly; and then, turning to two of his men, \"Williams, you and Jones bundle up the plate in the tablecloth, get what's on the sideboard too;\" and laying his pistols down upon the table, he continued:  \"But before Colonel Wilton insults me again, it might be well for him to remember that I am master not only of his person, but of the persons of all others who are in this room.\"  The colonel started, and Johnson laughed, looking with insolence from Katharine to her father.  \"What, sir!  I reach through your insolent pride now, do I?  Curse you!\" with sudden heat, throwing off even the mask of politeness he had hardly worn.  \"I swore I would have revenge for that insult at Williamsburg, and now it's my hour.  You are to go with me, and go peaceably and quietly, or, by God, I 'll have you kicked and dragged out of the building, or killed like that old fool who tried to stop us coming up on the landing.\"  \"What!  Blodgett, my old friend Blodgett!  You villain, you haven't dared to kill him, have you?  Oh, my faithful--\"  \"Silence, sir!  We dare anything.  What consideration has a rebel a right to expect at the hands of his majesty's faithful Rangers?  You, Bruce and Denton, seize the old man.  If he makes any trouble, knock him down, or kill him, for aught I care.  One of you, take the girl there.  As for you, sir,\" to Seymour, who had been quietly watching the scene, \"I don't know who you are, but you are in bad company, and you will have to consider yourself a prisoner; I trust you have sense enough to come without force being used.  And so,\" clapping his hat on his head defiantly, \"God save the king!\"  Two of the soldiers seized the colonel in spite of the vigorous resistance he made; another approached Katharine, who had stood with clasped hands during the whole of the colloquy between Johnson and her father.  The soldier rudely chucked her under the chin, saying, \"Come on, my pretty one! you 'll give us a kiss, won't you, before we start?\" As she drew back, paling at the insult, Seymour, who had seen and heard it all, quick as a flash drew his sword, and threw himself upon the soldier; one rapid thrust at the surprised man he made, with all the force and skill begotten of long practice and a strong arm, and the hilt of his blade crushed against the man's throat, and he fell dead upon the floor.  At the same instant one of the other soldiers, who had observed the action, struck Seymour over the head with his clubbed musket, and he also fell heavily to the floor, and lay there senseless and still, blood running from a fearful-looking wound in his forehead. The room was filled with tumult in an instant, and with shouts of \"Kill him!\" \"Shove your bayonet through the damn rebel hound!\" \"Shoot him!\" \"Kill him!\" the men moved towards Seymour.  Johnson looked on unconcernedly.  \"Good God!\" shrieked the colonel, writhing in the grasp of the men who held him, \"are you going to allow a senseless, wounded man to be murdered before your eyes?  Oh, how could anybody ever mistake you for a gentleman for an instant?\" he added, with withering contempt; and then turning his head toward the fierce soldiery, \"Stop, stop, you bloody assassins!\" he cried.  \"Silence, sir!  He might as well die this way as on the gallows. Besides, he struck the first blow, and he has killed one of his majesty's loyal soldiers.  The soldier only wanted to kiss the girl anyway, and she will find, before she gets to camp, that kisses are cheap.\"  \"Oh, my God,\" groaned the father, \"and they call this war!\"  At this moment one of the soldiers lifted his bayonet to plunge it into the prostrate form of the unconscious sailor.  There was a blinding flash of light in the room, and a quick, sharp report.  The man's arm dropped to his side, and he shrieked and groaned with pain.  Katharine, unnoticed in the confusion, had slipped to the side of the table, and had quickly picked up one of the pistols which Johnson had laid upon it after the silver had been taken away.  Her ready decision and unerring aim had saved her lover's life.  She threw the smoking pistol she had used with such effect down at her feet, and, seizing the other, she stepped over to the side of her unconscious lover.  \"I swear,\" she said, in a shrill, high-pitched voice which just escaped a scream, and which trembled with the agitation of the moment, \"by my hope of heaven, if a single man of you lay hands on him, he shall have this bullet also, you cowards!\"  After a moment's hesitation, amid shouts of \"Kill the girl!\" the men surged toward her.  Chloe, her black maid, flung herself upon her mistress' breast.  \"Oh, honey, I let dem kill me fust.\"  \"Well done, Kate!  It's the true Wilton blood.  Oh, if I had a free arm, you villains!\" cried the still struggling colonel.  \"Seize the girl,\" Johnson commanded promptly, \"and let us get out of this.\"  The men made a rush toward the table where Katharine stood undaunted, her face flushed with excitement, her mouth tense with resolution.  She cried,--  \"Have a care, men! have a care!\"  One life she could still command with her loaded pistol.  Her hands did not tremble.  She waited to strike once more for love and country, but it would be all over in a moment.  The colonel groaned in agony, \"Kate, Kate!\" but they were almost upon her, when a new voice rose above the uproar,--  \"Hold!  Are you men?  Do you war with old men and women?  Back with you!  Get back, you dogs!  Back, I say!\"     CHAPTER V  _A Timely Interference_  A young man in the uniform of a British naval lieutenant leaped in front of the girl with drawn sword, with which he laid about him lustily, striking some of the men with the flat of it, threatening others with the point; and backing his actions by the prompt commands of one not accustomed to be gainsaid, he soon cleared the space in front of her.  \"How dare you interfere in this matter, my lord?\" shouted Johnson, passionately.  \"I command this party, and I intend--\"  \"I know you do,\" replied the officer, \"and that I am only a volunteer who has chosen to accompany you, worse luck! but I am a gentleman and a lieutenant in his Britannic majesty's navy, and by heaven! when I see old men mishandled, and wounded helpless men about to be assassinated, and young women insulted, I don't care who commands the party, I interfere.  And I don't propose to bandy words with any runagate American partisan who uses his commission to further private vengeance. And I swear to you, on my honor, if you do not instantly modify your treatment of this gentleman, and call off this ragamuffin crew, you shall be court-martialled, if I have any influence with Dunmore or Parker or Lord Howe, or whoever is in authority, and I will have the rest of you hung as high as Haman.  This is outrage and robbery and murder; it is not fighting or making prisoners,\" continued the young officer.  \"You are not fit to be an officer; and you, you curs, you disgrace the uniform you wear.\"  Johnson glanced at his men, who stood irresolute before him fiercely muttering.  A rascally mob of the lowest class of people in the colony, to whom war simply meant opportunity for plunder and rapine, they would undoubtedly back up their leader, in their present mood, in any attempt at resistance he might make the young officer.  But he hesitated a moment.  Desborough was a lord, high in the confidence of Governor Dunmore, and a man of great influence; his own position was too precarious, the game was not worth the candle, and the risk of opposition was too great.  \"Well,\" he said in sulky acquiescence, \"the men meant no special harm, but have it your own way.  Fall back, men!  As to what you say to me personally, you shall answer to me for that at a more fitting time,\" he continued doggedly.  \"When and where you please,\" answered Desborough, hotly, \"though I 'd soil a sword by passing it through you.  What was Dunmore thinking of when he put you in charge of this party and sent you to do this work, I wonder?  Give your orders to your men to unhand this gentleman instantly.  You will give your parole, sir?  I regret that we are compelled to secure your person, but those were the orders; and you, madam,\" turning to Katharine, \"I believe no order requires you to be taken prisoner, and therefore you shall go free.\"  But Katharine had knelt down by her prostrate lover as soon as the space in front of her had been cleared, and was entirely oblivious to all that was taking place about her.  \"Allow me to introduce myself, colonel,\" he resumed.  \"I am Lord Desborough.  I have often heard my father, the Earl of Desmond, in Ireland, speak of you.  I regret that we meet under such unpleasant circumstances, but the governor's orders must be carried out, though I wish he had sent a more worthy representative to do so.  I will see, however, that everything is done for your comfort in the future.\"  \"Sir,\" said the colonel, bowing, \"you have rendered me a service I can never repay.  I know your father well.  He is one of the finest gentlemen of his time, and his son has this day shown that he is worthy of the honored name he bears.  I will go with you cheerfully, and you have my parole of honor.  Katharine, you are free; you will be safe in the house, I think, until I can arrange for your departure.\"  She looked up from the floor, and then rose.  \"Oh, father, he is dead, he is dead,\" she moaned.  \"Yes, I will go with you; take me away.\"  \"Nay, my child, I cannot.\"  \"Enough of this!\" broke in the sneering voice of Johnson.  \"She has been taken in open resistance to the king's forces, and, warrant or no warrant, orders or no orders, or court-martial either,\" this with a malevolent glance at Desborough, \"she goes with us as a prisoner.\"  \"I will pledge my word, Colonel"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20791"],["title","For Love of Country: A Story of Land and Sea in the Days of the Revolution (#6)"],["body","lton, that no violence is offered her,\" exclaimed Desborough, promptly, and then, turning to Katharine,--  \"Trust me, madam.\"  \"I do, sir,\" she said faintly, giving him her hand.  \"You are very kind.\"  \"It is nothing, mistress,\" he replied, bowing low over it, as he raised it respectfully to his lips.  \"I will hold you safe with my life.\"  \"Very pretty,\" sneered Johnson; \"but are you coming?\"  \"What shall we do with these two, captain?\" asked the sergeant, kicking the prostrate form of Seymour, and pointing to the body of the man who had been slain.  \"Oh, let them lie there!  We can't be bothered with dead and dying men. One of them is gone; the other soon will be.  The slaves will bury them, and those other three at the foot of the hill--d' ye hear, ye black niggers?  There 's hardly room enough on the sloop for the living,\" he continued with cynical indifference.  \"All right, captain!  As you say, poor Joe's no good now; and as for the other, that crack of Welsh's was a rare good one; he will probably die before morning anyhow,\" replied the sergeant, there being little love lost among the members of this philosophic crew; besides, the more dead, the more plunder for the living.  And many of the band were even now following the example of their leader, and roaming over the house, securing at will whatever excited their fancy, the wine-cellar especially not being forgotten.  \"Oh, my God!  John,\" whispered Katharine, falling on her knees again by his side, \"must I leave you now, oh, my love!\" she moaned, taking his head in her arms, and with her handkerchief wiping the blood from off his forehead, \"and you have died for me--for me.\"  The colonel saw the action, and knew now what was the subject of the interview after supper which Seymour had so much desired.  He knelt down beside his daughter, a great pity for her in his soul, and laid his hand on the prostrate man's heart.  \"He is not dead, Katharine,\" he whispered.  \"I do not even think he will die; he will be all right in an hour.  If we don't go soon, Katharine, Philip and Bentley will return and be taken also,\" he continued rapidly.  \"Come, Katharine,\" he said more loudly, rising. \"Dearest child, we must go,--you must bear this, my daughter; it is for our country we suffer.\"  But the talismanic word apparently had lost its charm for her.  \"What's all this?\" said Johnson, roughly; \"she must go.\"  She only moaned and pressed her lover's hands against her heart.  \"And go now!  Do you hear?  Come, mistress,\" laying his hand roughly upon her shoulder.  \"Have a care, sir,\" said Desborough, warningly.  \"Keep to yourself, my dear sir; no harm is done.  But we must go; and if she won't go willingly, she will have to be carried, that's all.  Do you hear me? Come on!\"  \"Come, Katharine,\" said the colonel, entreatingly.  \"Oh, father, father, I cannot leave him!  I love him!\"  \"I know you do, dear; and worthy he is of your love too.  Please God you shall see him once again!  But now we must go.  Will you not come with me?\"  \"I cannot, I cannot!\" she repeated.  \"But you must, Kate,\" said the colonel, lifting her up, in deadly anxiety to get away before his son returned.  \"You are a prisoner.\"  \"I can't, father; indeed I can't!\" she cried again.  She struggled a moment, then half fainted in his arms.  \"Who else is here?\" said Johnson.  \"Only the slaves,\" replied the colonel.  \"Well, we don't want them.  Move on, then!  Your daughter can take her maid with her if she wishes,\" he said with surly courtesy.  \"Is this the wench?  Well, get your mistress a cloak, and be quick about it!\"  Assisted by Chloe, the maid, and Lord Desborough, the colonel half carried, half led, his daughter out of the room.  \"Seymour, Seymour!\" she cried despairingly at the door; but he lay still where he had fallen, seeing and hearing nothing.     CHAPTER VI  _Faithful Subject of his Majesty_  A few miles up the river from Colonel Wilton's plantation, upon a high bluff, from which, as at that point the river made a wide bend, one could see up and down for a long distance in either direction, was the beautiful home of the Talbots, known as Fairview Hall.  On the evening of the raid at the Wilton place, Madam Talbot and her son were having a very important conversation.  Madam Talbot was a widow who had remained unwedded again from choice.  Rumor had it that many gentlemen cavaliers of the neighborhood had been anxious to take to their own hearthstones the person of the fair young widow, so early bereft, and incidentally were willing to assume the responsibility of the management of the magnificent estate which had been left to her by her most considerate husband.  Among the many suitors gossip held that Colonel Wilton was the chief, and it was thought at one time that his chances of success were of the best; but so far, at least, nothing had come of all the agitation, and Madam Talbot lived her life alone, managing her plantation, the object of the friendly admiration of all the old bachelors and widowers of the neighborhood.  She had devoted herself to the successful development of her property with all the energy and capacity of a nature eminently calculated for success, and was now one of the richest women in the colony.  One son only had blessed her union with Henry Talbot, and Hilary Talbot was a young man just turned twenty-five years of age, and the idol of her soul.  Too self-contained and too proud to display the depth of her feelings, except in rare instances, and too sensible to allow them to interfere in the training of the child, she had spared neither her heart nor her purse in his education, with such happy results that he was regarded by all who knew him as one of the finest specimens of young Virginia that it were possible to meet.  Of medium height, active, handsome, dark-eyed, dark-haired, fiery and impetuous in temperament, generous and frank in disposition, he was a model among men; trained from his boyhood in every manly sport and art, and educated in the best institutions of learning in the colonies, his natural grace perfected by a tour of two years in England and abroad, from which he had only a year or so since returned, he perfectly represented all that was best in the young manhood of Virginia.  For many years there had been hopes in the minds of Colonel Wilton and Madam Talbot, that the affection between the two young people, who had played together from childhood with all the frankness and simplicity permitted by country life, would develop into something nearer and dearer, and that by their marriage at the proper time the two great estates might be united.  The two children, early informed of this desire, had grown up under the influence of the idea; as they reached years of discretion, they had taken it for granted, considering the arrangement as a fact accomplished by tacit understanding and habit rather than by formal promise. Personally attached to each other, nay, even fondly affectionate, the indefinite tie seemed sufficiently substantial to bring about the desired result.  Katharine had, especially during Talbot's absence in Europe, resisted all the importunities and rejected all the proposals made to her, and on his account refused all the hearts laid at her feet.  Since Talbot's return, however, and especially since he refused, or hesitated rather, to cast his lot in with her own people, his neighbors and friends, in the Revolution, the affair had, on her part at least, assumed a new phase.  Still, there had been nothing said or done to prevent this consummation so devoutly to be wished until the advent of Seymour.  Then, too, Talbot, calm and confident in the situation, had not noticed Seymour's infatuation, and was entirely ignorant that the coveted prize had slipped from his grasp.  The insight of the confident lover was not so keen as that of the watchful father.  It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself.  His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful.  Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities.  It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other.  When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.  For his own hopes, however, the decision had come too late, and it may be safely presumed that his hesitation was one of the main causes through which the woman he loved escaped him; for Katharine's heart was given to young Seymour, after a ten days' courtship, almost before his eyes.  In any event, a wiser man would have seen in Seymour a possible, nay, a certain rival by no means to be disregarded.  An officer who had devoted himself to the cause of his country in response to the first demand of the Congress, who had been conspicuously mentioned for gallantry in general orders and reports, who had been severely wounded while protecting Katharine's father at the risk of his life; as well bred and as well born as Talbot, of ample fortune, and with a wide knowledge of men and things acquired in his merchant voyagings as captain of one of his own ships in many seas,--Seymour's single-hearted devotion eminently fitted him to woo and win Miss Katharine Wilton, as he had done.  Nevertheless, a friendship had"]]]
