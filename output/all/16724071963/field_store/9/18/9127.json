It was drawing matters down rather fine when he was compelled to back down to where he had elbow room, and remove his coat before he could squeeze his body through that crack.  But he did it, with his six-shooter inside his shirt and the extra ammunition weighting his trousers pockets.  In spite of his long experience with desert scenery, Casey was somewhat astonished to find himself in a new land, fairly level and with thick groves of pinon cedar and juniper trees scattered here and there.  Far away stood other barren hills with deep canyons between.  He knew now that the black-capped butte was less a butte than the uptilted nose of a high plateau not half so barren as the lower country.  From the pointing Joshua tree it had seemed a peak, but contours are never so deceptive as in the high, broken barrens of Nevada.  He looked down into the gulch where Barney was holed up with their outfit.  He could scarcely distinguish the place, it had dwindled so with the distance.  He had small hope of seeing Barney.  After that last leaden bee had buzzed through his hat crown, you would have to dig faster than Barney if you wanted a look at him. Casey grinned when he thought of it.  When he had gotten his breath and had scraped some loose dirt out of his shirt collar, Casey crouched down behind a juniper and examined his surroundings carefully, his pale, straight-lidded eyes moving slowly as the white, pointing finger of a searchlight while he took in every small detail within view.  Midway in the arc of his vision was a ledge, ending in a flat-topped boulder.  The ledge blocked his view, except that he could see trees and a higher peak of rocks beyond it.  He made his way cautiously toward the ledge, his eyes fixed upon the boulder.  A huge, sloping slab of the granite outcropping it seemed, scaly with gray-green fungus in the cracks where moisture longest remained; granite ledge banked with low junipers warped and stunted and tangled with sage. The longer Casey looked at the boulder, the less he saw that seemed unnatural in a country filled with boulders and outcroppings and stunted vegetation.  But the longer he looked at it, the stronger grew his animal instinct that something was wrong.  He waited for a time--a long time indeed for Casey Ryan to wait.  There was no stir anywhere save the sweep of the wind blowing steadily from the west.  He crept forward, halting often, eyeing the boulder and its neighboring ledge, distrust growing within him, though he saw nothing, heard nothing but the wind sweeping through branches and bush.  Casey Ryan was never frightened in his life.  But he was Irish born--and there's something in Irish blood that will not out; something that goes beyond reason into the world of unknown wisdom.  It's a tricksy world, that realm of intuitions.  For this is what befell Casey Ryan, and you may account for it as best pleases you.  He circled the rock as a wolf will circle a coiled rattler which it does not see.  Beyond the rock, built close against it so that the rear wall must have been the face of the ledge, a little rock cabin squatted secretively.  One small window, with two panes of glass was set high under the eaves on the side toward Casey. Cleverly concealed it was, built to resemble the ledge.  Visible from one side only, and that was the side where Casey stood. At the back the sloping boulder, untouched, impregnable; at the north and west, a twist of the ledge that hid the cabin completely in a niche.  It was the window on the south side that betrayed it.  So here was what the boulder concealed,--and yet, Casey was not satisfied with the discovery.  Unconsciously he reached for his gun. This, he told himself, must be the secret habitation of the fiend who shot from rim-rocks with terrible precision at harmless prospectors and their burros.  Casey squinted up at the sun and turned his level gaze again upon the cabin.  Reason told him that the man with the rifle was still watching for a pot shot at him and Barney, and that there was nothing whatever to indicate the presence of only one man in the camp below. Had he been glimpsed once during the climb, he would have been fired upon; he would never have been given the chance to gain the top and find this cabin.  The place looked deserted.  His practical, everyday mind told him it was empty for the time being.  But he felt queer and uncomfortable, nevertheless.  He sneaked along the ledge to the cabin, flattened himself against the corner next the gray boulder and waited there for a minute.  He felt the flesh stiffening on his jaws as he crept up to the window to look in.  By standing on his toes, Casey's eyes came on a level with the lowest inch of glass,--the window was so high.  Just at first Casey could not see much.  Then, when his eyes had adjusted themselves to the half twilight within, his mind at first failed to grasp what he saw.  Gradually a dimly sensed dread took hold of him, and grew while he stood there peering in at commonplace things which should have given him no feeling save perhaps a faint surprise.  A fairly clean, tiny room he saw, with a rough, narrow bed in one corner and a box table at its head.  From the ceiling hung a lantern with the chimney smoked on one side and the warped, pole rafter above it slightly blackened to show how long the lantern had hung there lighted.  A door opposite the tiny window was closed, and there was no latch or fastening on the inner side. An Indian blanket covered half the floor space, and in the corner opposite the bed was a queer, drumlike thing of sheet iron with a pipe running through the wall; some heating arrangement, Casey guessed.  In the center of the room, facing the window, a woman sat in a wooden rocking chair and rocked.  A pale old woman with dark hollows under her eyes that were fixed upon the pattern of the Indian rug. Her hair was white.  Her thin, white hands rested limply on the arms of the chair, and she was rocking back and forth, back and forth, steadily, quietly,--just rocking and staring at the Indian rug.  Casey has since told me that she was the creepiest thing he ever saw in his life.  Yet he could not explain why it was so. The woman's face was not so old, though it was lined and without color.  There was a terrible quiet in her features, but he felt, somehow, that her thoughts were not quiet.  It was as if her thoughts were reaching out to him, telling him things too awful for her thin, hushed lips to let pass.  But after all, Casey's main object was to locate the man with the rifle, and to do it before he himself was seen on the butte.  He watched a little longer the woman who rocked and rocked. Never once did her eyes move from that fixed point on the rug.  Never once did her fingers move on the arm of the chair.  Her mouth remained immobile as the lips of a dead woman.  He had to force himself to leave the window; and when he did, he felt guilty, as if he had somehow deserted some one helpless and needing him.  He sneaked back, lifted himself and took another long look.  The old woman was rocking back and forth, her face quiet with that terrible, pent placidity which Casey could not understand.  Away from the cabin a pebble's throw, he shook his shoulders and pulled his mind away from her, back to the man with the rifle--and to Barney. Rocking in a chair never hurt anybody that he ever heard of.  And shooting from rim-rocks did.  And Barney was down there, holed up and helpless, though he had grub and water. Casey was up here in a mighty dangerous place without much grub or water but--he hoped--not quite helpless.  His immediate, pressing job was not to peek through a high-up window at an old woman rocking back and forth in a chair, but to round up the man who was interfering with Casey's peaceful quest for--well, he called it wealth; but I think that adventure meant more to him.  He picked his way carefully along the edge of the rim-rock, keeping under cover when he could and watching always the country ahead.  And without any artful description of his progress, I will simply say that Casey Ryan combed the edge of that rampart for two miles before dark, and found himself at last on the side farthest from Barney without having discovered the faintest trace of any living soul save the woman who rocked back and forth in the little, secret cabin.  Casey sat down on a rock, took a restrained drink from his canteen, and said everything he knew or could invent that was profane and condemnatory of his luck, of the unseen assassin, of the country and his present predicament.  He got up, looked all around him, sniffed unavailingly for some tang of smoke in the thin, crisp air, reseated himself and said everything all over again.  Presently he rose and made his way straight across the butte, going slowly to lessen his chance of making a noise for unfriendly ears to hear, and with the stars for guidance.    CHAPTER FOUR  The night was growing cold, and Casey had no coat.  At least he could go down and tell Barney what he had discovered and had failed to discover, and get something to eat.  Barney would probably be worrying about him, though there was a chance that a bullet had found Barney before dark.  Casey was uneasy, and once he was down the fissure again, he hurried as much as possible.  He managed to reach the camp by the little spring without being shot at and without breaking a leg.  But Barney was not there. Just at first Casey believed he was dead; but a brief search told Casey that two of the largest canteens were gone, together with a side of bacon, some flour and all of the tobacco.  White assassins would have made a more thorough job of robbing the camp.  Barney, it was evident, had fled the fate of the burros.  Casey told the stars what he thought of a partner like Barney. Afterward he ate what was easiest to swallow without cooking, overhauled what was left of their outfit,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2063"],["title","The Trail of the White Mule (#5)"],["body","the remainder in a clump of bushes, and wearily climbed the bluff again under a capacity load.  He concealed himself in the bottom of the fissure to sleep, since he could search no farther.  If he thought wistfully of the palled comfort of his apartment in Los Angeles, and of the Little Woman there, he still did not think strongly enough to send him back to them.  For with a canteen or two of water, some food and his two capable legs to carry him, Casey Ryan could have made it to Barstow easily enough.  But because he was Casey Ryan, and Irish, and because he was always on the hunt for trouble without recognizing it when he met it in the trail, it never occurred to him to follow Barney down to safer country.  \"That there Joshuay tree meant a lot more'n what it let on, pointin' up this way!\"  Casey muttered, staring down upon a somnolent wilderness blanketed with hushed midnight.  \"If it thinks it's got Casey whipped, it better think agin and think quick.  I'll give it somethin' to point at, 'fore I leave this here butte.  \"Funny, the way it kept pointin' up this way.  I've saw Joshuays before--miles of 'em. But I never seen one that looked so kinda human and so kinda like it was tryin' to talk.  Seems kinda funny; an' that old lady rockin' an' lookin'--seems like her an' the Joshuay has kinda throwed in together, hopin' somebody might come along with savvy enough to kinda--aw, hell!\"  So did Casey and his Irish belief in the supernatural fall plump against the limitations of his vocabulary.  Against the limitations proscribed by his material predicament, however, Casey Ryan set his face with a grin.  Somebody was going to get the big jolt of his life before long, he told himself over a careful breakfast fire built cunningly far back in the crevice where a current of air sucked into the rock capping of the butte. Something was going on up here that shouldn't go on.  He did not know what it was, but he meant to stop it.  He did not know who was making Indian war on peaceful prospectors, but Casey felt that they were already as good as licked, since he was here with breakfast under his belt and his six-shooter tucked handily inside his waistband.  He squinted up the crack in the ledge, made certain mental alterations in its narrow, jagged walls, and reached for the tough-handled, efficient prospector's pick he had thoughtfully included in his meagre equipment.  Slowly and methodically he worked up the crevice, knocking off certain sharp points of rock, and knowing all the while what would probably happen to him if he were overheard.  He was not discovered, however.  When he laid elbows on the upper level of the rim and pulled himself up, his coat was on his back where it belonged, and even Barney could have followed him.  Yet the top showed no evidence of a widening of the fissure.  The bushy junipers hid him completely while he reconnoitred and considered what he should do.  Because the place was close and the invisible call was strong, Casey went first to the rock hut, circled it carefully and found that it was exactly what it had seemed at first sight; a hidden place with no evident opening save that high, small window under the eaves.  There was no sign of pathway leading to it, no trace of life outside its wall.  But when he crept close and peeked in again, there sat the old woman rocking back and forth.  But to-day she stared at the wall before her.  Casey felt a distinct sensation of relief just in knowing that she was, after all, capable of moving.  Now her head was not bent, but rested against the back of her chair.  She was rocking steadily, quietly, with never a halt.  Casey rapped on the window and waited, fighting a nameless dread of the mystery of her.  But she continued to rock and to stare at the wall; if she heard the tapping she gave no sign whatever. So presently he turned away and set himself to the work of finding the man with the rifle.  To that end he first of all climbed the tallest pinon tree in sight; a tree that stood on a rise of ground apart from its brothers. From the concealment of its branches, he surveyed his surroundings carefully, noting especially the notched unevenness of the butte's rim and how just behind him it narrowed unexpectedly to a thin ridge not more than a couple of hundred yards in breadth.  A jagged outcropping cut straight across and Casey saw how yesterday he had mistaken that ledge for the rim of the butte.  His man must have been out on the point beyond him all the while.  He was out there now, very likely; there, or down in the camp he had watched yesterday like a vulture.  His search having narrowed to an area easily covered in an hour or two, Casey turned his head and examined as well as he could the deep canyon that had bitten into the butte and caused that narrow peak. Trees blocked his view there, and he was feeling about for a lower foothold so that he could make the descent when a voice from the ground startled him considerably.  \"Come down outa there, before I shoot yuh down!\"  Casey looked down and saw what he afterwards declared was the meanest looking man on earth, pointing straight at him the widest muzzled shotgun he had ever seen in his life.  Casey came down.  The last ten feet of the distance he made in a clean jump, planting his feet full in the old man's stomach. The meanest looking man on earth gave a grunt and crumpled, with Casey's fingers digging into his throat.  Whether Casey would have killed him or not will never be known. For just as the man was falling limp in his hands, another heavy body landed upon Casey's back.  Casey felt a hard, chill circle pressed against his perspiring temple.  His hands relaxed and fall away from the throat, leaving finger marks there in the flesh.  \"Git up off'n him!\" a new voice commanded harshly, and Casey obeyed. His captor shifted the gun muzzle to the back of Casey's neck and poked the gasping, bearded old man with his toe.  \"Git up, Paw, you old fool, you!  What'd you let 'im light on yuh fer? Why couldn't you a stood back a piece, outa reach?  You like to got croaked.\"  Casey found it prudent to hold his head rather still, as a man does when he carries a boil on his neck.  The muzzle of a six-shooter has a quieting effect, when applied to the person by an unfriendly hand. Casey did not at once see the intruder.  But presently \"Paw\" recovered himself and his shotgun, and swung it menacingly toward Casey. Whereupon the cold circle left Casey's medulla oblongata and a long-faced, long-legged youth stepped somewhat hastily to one side.  \"Paw, you ol' fool, you, get your finger off'n that trigger whilst you're aimin' at me!\" he exclaimed pettishly.  \"I wa'n't aimin' at you.  I was aimin' at this 'ere--\" Casey heard himself called many names, any one of which was good for a fight when Casey was free.  \"Aw, you shut up, Paw.  You ain't gittin' nobody nowhere,\" the son interrupted.  \"You can't cuss 'im t' death--he looks like he could cut loose a few of them pet names hisself if he got a chancet. Yuh might tell us what you was doin' up that there tree, mister. An' what you're doin' on this here butte, anyhow.\"  Casey looked at him.  Knowing Casey, I should say that his eyes were not pleasant.  \"Talk to Paw,\" he advised contemptuously. \"The two of yuh may possibly be able to stand each other without gittin' sick; but me, I never did git used to skunks!\"  That remark very nearly got him a through ticket to Land Beyond. But, being very nearly what Casey had called them, they contented themselves with mouthing vile epithets.  \"Better take 'im down to the mine an' keep 'im till Mart gets back, Paw,\" the long-jawed youth suggested, when he ran short of objurgations. \"Mart'll fix 'im when he comes.\"  \"I'd fix 'im, here an', now,\" threatened Paw, \"but Mart, he's so damned techy lately--what we oughta do is bust 'is head with a rock an' pitch 'im over the rim.  That'd fix 'im.\"  They wrangled over the suggestion, and finally decided to take him down and turn him over to one whom they called Joe.  Casey went along peaceably, hopeful that he would later have a chance to fight back. He told himself that they both had heads like peanuts, and whenever they moved, he swore, he could hear their brains rattle in their skulls. It doesn't take brains to shoot straight, and he decided that the lanky young man was the one who had shot from the rim-rock. They drove him down into the narrow, deep gulch, following a steep trail that Casey had not seen the day before.  The trail led them to the mouth of a tunnel; and by the size of the dump Casey judged that the workings were of a considerable extent.  They were getting out silver ore, he guessed, after a glance or two at stray pieces of rock.  Joe was a big, glum-looking individual with his left hand bandaged. He chewed tobacco industriously and maintained a complete silence while Hank, frequently telling Paw to shut up, told how and where they had found Casey spying up on the butte.  \"We don't fancy stray desert rats prowlin' around without no reason,\" said Joe.  \"Our boss that we're workin' for ain't at home.  We're lookin' for 'im back any day now, an' we'll just hold yuh till he comes.  He can do as he likes about yuh.  You'll have to work fer your board--c'm on an' I'll show yuh how.\"  Hank followed Casey and Joe into the tunnel.  Casey made no objections whatever to going.  The tunnel was a fairly long one, he noticed, with drifts opening out of it to left and right. At the end of the main tunnel, Joe turned, took Casey's candle from him and stuck it into a seam in the wall, as he had done with his own.  \"Ever drill in rock?\" he asked shortly.  \"Mebbe I have an' mebbe I ain't,\" Casey returned defiantly.  \"Here's a drill, an' here's your single-jack.  Now git t' work. There ain't any loafin' around this camp, and spies never meant good to nobody.  Yuh needn't expect to be popular with us--but you'll git your grub if yuh earn it.\"  Casey looked at the drill, took the"]]]
