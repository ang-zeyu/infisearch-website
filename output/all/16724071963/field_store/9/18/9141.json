This Side Up With Care._\"  \"Miss Elphinspoon,\" he said, and there was a new note in his voice, \"Angela, I leave England to-night----\"  \"To-night!\" gasped Angela.  \"On a confidential mission.\"  \"To Wazuchistan!\" exclaimed the girl.  Powers paused a moment. \"To Wazuchistan,\" he said, \"yes. But it must not be known. I shall return in a month--or never. If I fail\"--he spoke with an assumed lightness--\"it is only one more grave among the hills. If I succeed, the Cabinet is saved, and with it the destiny of England.\"  \"Oh, Mr. Powers,\" cried Angela, rising and advancing towards him, \"how splendid! How noble! No reward will be too great for you.\"  \"My reward,\" said Powers, and as he spoke he reached out and clasped both of the girl's hands in his own, \"yes, my reward. May I come and claim it here?\"  For a moment he looked straight into her eyes. In the next he was gone, and Angela was alone.  \"His reward!\" she murmured. \"What could he have meant? His reward that he is to claim. What can it be?\"  But she could not divine it. She admitted to herself that she had not the faintest idea.     CHAPTER III   In the days that followed all England was thrilled to its base as the news spread that the Wazoo might rise at any moment.  \"Will the Wazoos rise?\" was the question upon every lip.  In London men went to their offices with a sense of gloom. At lunch they could hardly eat. A feeling of impending disaster pervaded all ranks.  Sir John as he passed to and fro to the House was freely accosted in the streets.  \"Will the Wazoos rise, sir?\" asked an honest labourer. \"Lord help us all, sir, if they do.\"  Sir John, deeply touched, dropped a shilling in the honest fellow's hat, by accident.  At No. 10 Downing Street, women of the working class, with children in their arms, stood waiting for news.  On the Exchange all was excitement. Consols fell two points in twenty-four hours. Even raising the Bank rate and shutting the door brought only a temporary relief.  Lord Glump, the greatest financial expert in London, was reported as saying that if the Wazoos rose England would be bankrupt in forty-eight hours.  Meanwhile, to the consternation of the whole nation, the Government did nothing. The Cabinet seemed to be paralysed.  On the other hand the Press became all the more clamorous. The London _Times_ urged that an expedition should be sent at once. Twenty-five thousand household troops, it argued, should be sent up the Euphrates or up the Ganges or up something without delay. If they were taken in flat boats, carried over the mountains on mules, and lifted across the rivers in slings, they could then be carried over the desert on jackasses. They could reach Wazuchistan in two years. Other papers counselled moderation. The _Manchester Guardian_ recalled the fact that the Wazoos were a Christian people. Their leader, El Boob, so it was said, had accepted Christianity with childlike simplicity and had asked if there was any more of it. The _Spectator_ claimed that the Wazoos, or more properly the Wazi, were probably the descendants of an Iranic or perhaps Urgumic stock. It suggested the award of a Rhodes Scholarship. It looked forward to the days when there would be Wazoos at Oxford. Even the presence of a single Wazoo, or, more accurately, a single Wooz, would help.  With each day the news became more ominous. It was reported in the Press that a Wazoo, inflamed apparently with _ghee_, or perhaps with _bhong_, had rushed up to the hills and refused to come down. It was said that the Shriek-el-Foozlum, the religious head of the tribe, had torn off his suspenders and sent them to Mecca.  That same day the _Illustrated London News_ published a drawing \"Wazoo Warriors Crossing a River and Shouting, Ho!\" and the general consternation reached its height.  Meantime, for Sir John and his colleagues, the question of the hour became, \"Could the Cabinet be held together?\" Every effort was made. The news that the Cabinet had all been seen together at the circus, for a moment reassured the nation. But the rumour spread that the First Lord of the Admiralty had said that the clowns were a bum lot. The Radical Press claimed that if he thought so he ought to resign.  On the fatal Friday the question already referred to was scheduled for its answer. The friends of the Government counted on the answer to restore confidence. To the consternation of all, the expected answer was not forthcoming. The Colonial Secretary rose in his place, visibly nervous. Ministers, he said, had been asked where Wazuchistan was. They were not prepared, at the present delicate stage of negotiations, to say. More hung upon the answer than Ministers were entitled to divulge. They could only appeal to the patriotism of the nation. He could only say this, that _wherever_ it was, and he used the word _wherever_ with all the emphasis of which he was capable, the Government would accept the full responsibility for its being where it was.  The House adjourned in something like confusion.  Among those seated behind the grating of the Ladies' Gallery was Lady Elphinspoon. Her quick instinct told her the truth. Driving home, she found her husband seated, crushed, in his library.  \"John,\" she said, falling on her knees and taking her husband's hands in hers, \"is this true? Is this the dreadful truth?\"  \"I see you have divined it, Caroline,\" said the statesman sadly. \"It is the truth. We don't know where Wazuchistan is.\"  For a moment there was silence.  \"But, John, how could it have happened?\"  \"We thought the Colonial Office knew. We were confident that they knew. The Colonial Secretary had stated that he had been there. Later on it turned out that he meant Saskatchewan. Of course they thought _we_ knew. And we both thought that the Exchequer must know. We understood that they had collected a hut tax for ten years.\"  \"And hadn't they?\"  \"Not a penny. The Wazoos live in tents.\"  \"But, surely,\" pleaded Lady Elphinspoon, \"you could find out. Had you no maps?\"  Sir John shook his head.  \"We thought of that at once, my dear. We've looked all through the British Museum. Once we thought we had succeeded. But it turned out to be Wisconsin.\"  \"But the map in the _Times_? Everybody saw it.\"  Again the baronet shook his head. \"Lord Southcliff had it made in the office,\" he said. \"It appears that he always does. Otherwise the physical features might not suit him.\"  \"But could you not send some one to see?\"  \"We did. We sent Perriton Powers to find out where it was. We had a month to the good. It was barely time, just time. Powers has failed and we are lost. To-morrow all England will guess the truth and the Government falls.\"     CHAPTER IV   The crowd outside of No. 10 Downing Street that evening was so dense that all traffic was at a standstill. But within the historic room where the Cabinet were seated about the long table all was calm. Few could have guessed from the quiet demeanour of the group of statesmen that the fate of an Empire hung by a thread.  Seated at the head of the table, the Prime Minister was quietly looking over a book of butterflies, while waiting for the conference to begin. Beside him the Secretary for Ireland was fixing trout flies, while the Chancellor of the Exchequer kept his serene face bent over upon his needlework. At the Prime Minister's right, Sir John Elphinspoon, no longer agitated, but sustained and dignified by the responsibility of his office, was playing spillikins.  The little clock on the mantel chimed eight.  The Premier closed his book of butterflies.  \"Well, gentlemen,\" he said, \"I fear our meeting will not be a protracted one. It seems we are hopelessly at variance. You, Sir Charles,\" he continued, turning to the First Sea Lord, who was in attendance, \"are still in favour of a naval expedition?\"  \"Send it up at once,\" said Sir Charles.  \"Up where?\" asked the Premier.  \"Up anything,\" answered the Old Sea Dog, \"it will get there.\"  Voices of dissent were raised in undertones around the table.  \"I strongly deprecate any expedition,\" said the Chancellor of the Exchequer, \"I favour a convention with the Shriek. Let the Shriek sign a convention recognizing the existence of a supreme being and receiving from us a million sterling in acknowledgment.\"  \"And where will you _find_ the Shriek?\" said the Prime Minister. \"Come, come, gentlemen, I fear that we can play this comedy no longer. The truth is,\" he added with characteristic nonchalance, \"we don't know where the bally place is. We can't meet the House to-morrow. We are hopelessly split. Our existence as a Government is at an end.\"  But, at that very moment, a great noise of shouting and clamour rose from the street without. The Prime Minister lifted his hand for silence. \"Listen,\" he said. One of the Ministers went to a window and opened it, and the cries outside became audible. \"A King's Messenger! Make way for the King's Messenger!\"  The Premier turned quietly to Sir John.  \"Perriton Powers,\" he said.  In another moment Perriton Powers stood before the Ministers.  Bronzed by the tropic sun, his face was recognizable only by the assured glance of his eye. An Afghan _bernous_ was thrown back from his head and shoulders, while his commanding figure was draped in a long _chibuok_. A pair of pistols and a curved _yasmak_ were in his belt.  \"So you got to Wazuchistan all right,\" said the Premier quietly.  \"I went in by way of the Barooda,\" said Powers. \"For many days I was unable to cross it. The waters of the river were wild and swollen with rains. To cross it seemed certain death----\"  \"But at last you got over,\" said the Premier, \"and then----\"  \"I struck out over the Fahuri desert. For days and days, blinded by the sun, and almost buried in sand, I despaired.\"  \"But you got through it all right. And after that?\"  \"My first care was to disguise myself. Staining myself from head to foot with betel nut----\"  \"To look like a beetle,\" said the Premier. \"Exactly. And so you got to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20633"],["title","Winsome Winnie and other New Nonsense Novels (#7)"],["body","zuchistan. Where is it and what is it?\"  \"My lord,\" said Powers, drawing himself up and speaking with emphasis, \"I got to where it was thought to be. There is no such place!\"  The whole Cabinet gave a start of astonishment.  \"No such place!\" they repeated.  \"What about El Boob?\" asked the Chancellor.  \"There is no such person.\"  \"And the Shriek-el-Foozlum?\"  Powers shook his head.  \"But do you mean to say,\" said the Premier in astonishment, \"that there are no Wazoos? There you _must_ be wrong. True we don't just know where they are. But our despatches have shown too many signs of active trouble traced directly to the Wazoos to disbelieve in them. There are Wazoos somewhere, there--there _must_ be.\"  \"The Wazoos,\" said Powers, \"are there. But they are Irish. So are the Ohulîs. They are both Irish.\"  \"But how the devil did they get out there?\" questioned the Premier. \"And why did they make the trouble?\"  \"The Irish, my lord,\" interrupted the Chief Secretary for Ireland, \"are everywhere, and it is their business to make trouble.\"  \"Some years ago,\" continued Powers, \"a few Irish families settled out there. The Ohulîs should be properly called the O'Hooleys. The word Wazoo is simply the Urdu for McGinnis. El Boob is the Urdu for the Arabic El Papa, the Pope. It was my knowledge of Urdu, itself an agglutinative language----\"  \"Precisely,\" said the Premier. Then he turned to his Cabinet. \"Well, gentlemen, our task is now simplified. If they are Irish, I think we know exactly what to do. I suppose,\" he continued, turning to Powers, \"that they want some kind of Home Rule.\"  \"They do,\" said Powers.  \"Separating, of course, the Ohulî counties from the Wazoo?\"  \"Yes,\" said Powers.  \"Precisely; the thing is simplicity itself. And what contribution will they make to the Imperial Exchequer?\"  \"None.\"  \"And will they pay their own expenses?\"  \"They refuse to.\"  \"Exactly. All this is plain sailing. Of course they must have a constabulary. Lord Edward,\" continued the Premier, turning now to the Secretary of War, \"how long will it take to send in a couple of hundred constabulary? I think they'll expect it, you know. It's their right.\"  \"Let me see,\" said Lord Edward, calculating quickly, with military precision, \"sending them over the Barooda in buckets and then over the mountains in baskets--I think in about two weeks.\"  \"Good,\" said the Premier. \"Gentlemen, we shall meet the House to-morrow. Sir John, will you meantime draft us an annexation bill? And you, young man, what you have done is really not half bad. His Majesty will see you to-morrow. I am glad that you are safe.\"  \"On my way home,\" said Powers, with quiet modesty, \"I was attacked by a lion----\"  \"But you beat it off,\" said the Premier. \"Exactly. Good night.\"     CHAPTER V   It was on the following afternoon that Sir John Elphinspoon presented the Wazoo Annexation Bill to a crowded and breathless House.  Those who know the House of Commons know that it has its moods. At times it is grave, earnest, thoughtful. At other times it is swept with emotion which comes at it in waves. Or at times, again, it just seems to sit there as if it were stuffed.  But all agreed that they had never seen the House so hushed as when Sir John Elphinspoon presented his Bill for the Annexation of Wazuchistan. And when at the close of a splendid peroration he turned to pay a graceful compliment to the man who had saved the nation, and thundered forth to the delighted ears of his listeners--       _Arma virumque cano Wazoo qui primus ab oris_,  and then, with the words \"England, England,\" still on his lips, fell over backwards and was carried out on a stretcher, the House broke into wild and unrestrained applause.     CHAPTER VI   The next day Sir Perriton Powers--for the King had knighted him after breakfast--stood again in the conservatory of the house in Carlton Terrace.  \"I have come for my reward,\" he said. \"Do I get it?\"  \"You do,\" said Angela.  Sir Perriton clasped her in his arms.  \"On my way home,\" he said, \"I was attacked by a lion. I tried to beat it----\"  \"Hush, dearest,\" she whispered, \"let me take you to father.\"     IV  WHO DO YOU THINK DID IT?  OR, THE MIXED-UP MURDER MYSTERY  (_Done after the very latest fashion in this sort of thing_)     _IV.--Who Do You Think Did It? or, The Mixed-Up Murder Mystery._  _NOTE.--Any reader who guesses correctly who did it is entitled (in all fairness) to a beautiful gold watch and chain._     CHAPTER I  HE DINED WITH ME LAST NIGHT   The afternoon edition of the _Metropolitan Planet_ was going to press. Five thousand copies a minute were reeling off its giant cylinders. A square acre of paper was passing through its presses every hour. In the huge _Planet_ building, which dominated Broadway, employés, compositors, reporters, advertisers, surged to and fro. Placed in a single line (only, of course, they wouldn't be likely to consent to it) they would have reached across Manhattan Island. Placed in two lines, they would probably have reached twice as far. Arranged in a procession they would have taken an hour in passing a saloon: easily that.  In the whole vast building all was uproar. Telephones, megaphones and gramophones were ringing throughout the building. Elevators flew up and down, stopping nowhere.  Only in one place was quiet--namely, in the room where sat the big man on whose capacious intellect the whole organization depended.  Masterman Throgton, the general manager of the _Planet_, was a man in middle life. There was something in his massive frame which suggested massiveness, and a certain quality in the poise of his great head which indicated a balanced intellect. His face was impenetrable and his expression imponderable.  The big chief was sitting in his swivel chair with ink all round him. Through this man's great brain passed all the threads and filaments that held the news of a continent. Snap one, and the whole continent would stop.  At the moment when our story opens (there was no sense in opening it sooner), a written message had just been handed in.  The Chief read it. He seemed to grasp its contents in a flash.  \"Good God!\" he exclaimed. It was the strongest expression that this solid, self-contained, semi-detached man ever allowed himself. Anything stronger would have seemed too near to profanity. \"Good God!\" he repeated, \"Kivas Kelly murdered! In his own home! Why, he dined with me last night! I drove him home!\"  For a brief moment the big man remained plunged in thought. But with Throgton the moment of musing was short. His instinct was to act.  \"You may go,\" he said to the messenger. Then he seized the telephone that stood beside him (this man could telephone almost without stopping thinking) and spoke into it in quiet, measured tones, without wasting a word.  \"Hullo, operator! Put me through to two, two, two, two, two. Is that two, two, two, two, two? Hullo, two, two, two, two, two; I want Transome Kent. Kent speaking? Kent, this is Throgton speaking. Kent, a murder has been committed at the Kelly residence, Riverside Drive. I want you to go and cover it. Get it all. Don't spare expense. The _Planet_ is behind you. Have you got car-fare? Right.\"  In another moment the big chief had turned round in his swivel chair (at least forty degrees) and was reading telegraphic despatches from Jerusalem. That was the way he did things.     CHAPTER II  I MUST SAVE HER LIFE   Within a few minutes Transome Kent had leapt into a car (a surface car) and was speeding north towards Riverside Drive with the full power of the car. As he passed uptown a newsboy was already calling, \"Club Man Murdered! Another Club Man Murdered!\" Carelessly throwing a cent to the boy, Kent purchased a paper and read the brief notice of the tragedy.  Kivas Kelly, a well-known club man and _bon vivant_, had been found dead in his residence on Riverside Drive, with every indication--or, at least, with a whole lot of indications--of murder. The unhappy club man had been found, fully dressed in his evening clothes, lying on his back on the floor of the billiard-room, with his feet stuck up on the edge of the table. A narrow black scarf, presumably his evening tie, was twisted tightly about his neck by means of a billiard cue inserted in it. There was a quiet smile upon his face. He had apparently died from strangulation. A couple of bullet-holes passed through his body, one on each side, but they went out again. His suspenders were burst at the back. His hands were folded across his chest. One of them still held a white billiard ball. There was no sign of a struggle or of any disturbance in the room. A square piece of cloth was missing from the victim's dinner jacket.  In its editorial columns the same paper discussed the more general aspects of the murder. This, it said, was the third club man murdered in the last fortnight. While not taking an alarmist view, the paper felt that the killing of club men had got to stop. There was a limit, a reasonable limit, to everything. Why should a club man be killed? It might be asked, why should a club man live? But this was hardly to the point. They do live. After all, to be fair, what does a club man ask of society? Not much. Merely wine, women and singing. Why not let him have them? Is it fair to kill him? Does the gain to literature outweigh the social wrong? The writer estimated that at the rate of killing now going on the club men would be all destroyed in another generation. Something should be done to conserve them.  Transome Kent was not a detective. He was a reporter. After sweeping everything at Harvard in front of him, and then behind him, he had joined the staff of the _Planet_ two months before. His rise had been phenomenal. In his first week of work he had unravelled a mystery, in his second he had unearthed a packing scandal which had poisoned the food of the entire nation for ten years, and in his third he had pitilessly exposed some of the best and most respectable people in the metropolis.
