The French, you see, as well as the Venetians, had long been experimenting with glass-making and since it was considered there, as here, an art, many penniless Huguenot gentlemen who had lost their fortunes took it up; for one might be a glass-maker and still retain his noble rank. Such was Bernard Palissy----\"  \"The potter!\" interrupted Jean. \"I learned all about him in my history.\"  Giusippe nodded.  \"So? Then you know how he struggled for years to solve the secret of making the enamel he had seen on a Saracen cup. Palissy also made some fine old stained glass, although few people seem to know this. Many another Frenchman tried to discover the Venetian's great secret. They sought to bribe our people to tell the process, but without success. Then Colbert, the chief minister under Louis the Fourteenth, wrote the French ambassador at Venice that he must obtain for France some Venetian workmen. The ambassador was upset enough, as you may imagine, when he received the order. He said he could not do it. He dared not. If found out he would be thrown into the sea.\"  \"He ought to have been!\" Jean cried. \"He would have deserved it.\"  \"I think so too,\" Uncle Bob agreed.  \"It would have been far better for Venice had he been drowned in the Adriatic,\" Giusippe answered slowly. \"But he wasn't. Instead he began cautiously to look about. There are always in the world, señor, men who have no pride in their fatherland and can be bought with money. The next year the ambassador succeeded in bribing eighteen glass-makers to go to France and make mirrors for Versailles, the palace of the French king. And no sooner had these men got well to work and passed the mystery on to the French than Colbert forbade the French people to import any more mirrors from Venice, as mirrors could now be made at home. Some of these early French mirrors are now in the Cluny Museum in France, my father told me. In consequence of the treachery of these workmen Germany also soon learned how to make mirrors, and the fame of the Venetian artisans declined just as the Council had predicted it would. But it will be long before any other country can equal mine in the making of filigree or spun glass. You will, señorita, see much of this beautiful work while you are here in Venice.\"  \"I want to, Giusippe; and I want to get some to take home. May I, Uncle Bob?\"  Mr. Cabot nodded.  \"Your story is like a fairy tale, Giusippe,\" said he.  The boy smiled with pleasure.  \"It is a wonderful story to me because it is the story of my people. And, señor, there is much more to tell, but I must not weary you. Some of our filigree glass, it is true, became too elaborate to be beautiful. It is simply interesting because it is wonderful that out of glass could be fashioned ships, flowers, fruits, fish, and decorations of all kinds. It shows most delicate workmanship. But the drinking glasses with their fragile stems are really beautiful; and so are the vases and tazzas from white glass with enamel work or filigree of delicately blended colors. It was the Venetians, too, who invented engraved glass, where a design is scratched or cut into the surface with a diamond or steel point of a file. And our mille-fiori glass, which came to us way back from the Egyptians, is another famous variety. This is made from the ends of fancy colored sticks of glass cut off and arranged in a pattern. You will see it in the shops here.\"  \"I think you Venetians are wonderful!\" Jean exclaimed.  \"Ah, señorita, you have yet to see one of the finest things we have done,\" was Giusippe's grave reply. \"You have to see the San Marco with its mosaics!\"  \"Yes, we surely want to go there,\" put in Mr. Cabot. \"Do you think you could be our guide, Giusippe?\"  \"I could go to-morrow, señor; because of the festa I am free from work. I would like to show you San Marco, of all things, because I love it.\"  \"I am sure no one could do it better,\" replied Mr. Cabot, well pleased. \"To-morrow at nine, then. We will be ready promptly. You shall tell us the rest of your fascinating Venetian history and make Venetians of us.\"  \"I will come, señor.\"  \"You shall be paid for your time, my boy.\"  \"Alas, señor! That would spoil it all. I could not then show it to you. Forgive me and do not think me ungrateful. But my San Marco is to me the place I love. I show it to you because I love it. I have played about it and wandered in and out its doors since I was a very little child. I am proud that you should see it, señor.\"  \"As you will. To-morrow then.\"  \"Yes, señor.\"  Another moment and Giusippe was gone.  \"A remarkable boy! A most remarkable boy!\" ejaculated Mr. Cabot. \"He knows his country's history as I fancy few others know it. Could you pass as good an examination on yours, Jean?\"  Jean hung her head.  \"I'm afraid not.\"  \"Nor I,\" Uncle Bob remarked, patting her curls kindly.     CHAPTER IV  UNCLE BOB ENLARGES HIS PARTY   In accordance with his promise Giusippe came promptly the next morning and the four set out for the San Marco. It was a beautiful June day. The piazza was warm with sunshine, and as groups of tourists loitered through it the pigeons circled greedily about their feet begging food.  \"Why, Uncle Bob, these pigeons are exactly like the ones at home--just as pretty and just as hungry,\" Jean said.  \"Should you like to stop a moment and feed them, little girl?\"  \"Oh, do! It will make Hannah think of Boston,\" begged Jean. \"But we have nothing to give them,\" she added in dismay.  \"I will find you something, señorita,\" Giusippe declared.  Darting up to an old Italian who was standing near he soon returned with a small paper cornucopia filled with grain.  \"The pigeons of St. Mark's are very tame. See!\"  He put some kernels of corn on the top of his hat, and holding more in his outstretched hands stood motionless. There was a whirr of wings, and in an instant the boy was quite hidden beneath an eager multitude of fluttering whiteness.  \"I never saw so many pigeons,\" Jean whispered. \"You have many more than we do at home.\"  \"We Venetians are very fond of the birds,\" was Giusippe's reply. \"So, too, are the tourists who come to Venice, for they never seem to be tired of having their pictures taken surrounded by flocks of pigeons.\"  \"Doesn't this make you think of Boston Common, Hannah?\" asked Uncle Bob.  \"Yes, a little. But I should feel more as if I were in Massachusetts if there were not such a babel of foreign tongues about me.\" Then turning to Giusippe she demanded: \"How did you come to speak English, young man?\"  \"I have been expecting you would ask me that,\" smiled Giusippe. \"You see, I have an uncle who went to America; yes, to Pennsylvania, to seek his fortune. He stayed there five years and in that time he learned to speak English well. When he came back he taught me all he knew. Then he returned with his wife to the United States, and I got books and studied. When they found at Murano that I could speak English they often called on me to show tourists over the glass works. In this way I picked up many words and their pronunciation. Since then I have found that I could sometimes serve as interpreter for English or American travelers if I watched for the chance. I was eager for such opportunities, for it gave me practice, and I often learned new words.\"  \"And why are you so anxious to learn English, Giusippe?\" Jean questioned.  \"I hope, señorita, to go some day to the United States. My uncle told me what a wonderful country it is, and I desire to see it. Perhaps in that beautiful great land where everything is in abundance I might grow rich. I now have nothing to keep me here; my parents are dead and I have no other kinsmen. I want to join my uncle in Pennsylvania as soon as I have enough money. Part of my passage I have already saved.\"  \"Why, Giusippe!\"  \"Yes, señorita, I am in earnest. It is lonely here in Venice now that I have no people. And Murano is not what it was in the golden days of my ancestors. I am sure I could find work in your country if I should go there. Do you not think I could, señor?\" He turned to Mr. Cabot.  \"It is possible,\" was Uncle Bob's thoughtful answer. \"Especially since you speak English so well. What sort of thing would you like to do?\"  \"I know my trade of glass-making,\" was Giusippe's modest answer. \"I know, too, much of coloring stained glass and of mosaic making. These things I have known from my babyhood up. There must be such work for persons going to the United States. Perhaps my uncle, who is in Pittsburgh with a large glass company, could get me something to do there.\"  \"Pittsburgh!\" exclaimed the other three in a breath.  \"Yes. My uncle is with the company of a Señor Thomas Curtis, who has been very kind to him.\"  \"Uncle Tom! It's Uncle Tom!\" Jean cried, laying her hand impulsively on his arm. \"Mr. Curtis is my uncle, Giusippe. Did you ever hear anything so wonderful!\"  \"It certainly is a strange coincidence,\" agreed Mr. Cabot. \"But why did your uncle come back, Giusippe, after he once got over there?\"  \"Ah, it was this way. He went first alone, expecting when he had enough money to send it back so that the young girl he loved could follow him, and they could be married. But when at last he had the money saved her parents became sick. They were old people. She could not leave them to die here alone, señor. Therefore she refused to go to America, and so much did my uncle love Anita that he would not stay there without her. Back he came and worked once more at Murano. Then the father and mother died, and my uncle and Anita were married and went to the United States. They wanted to take me, but I pretended that I would rather remain here. This I did because I feared that if I went with them and did not find work I might be a burden. All this was several years ago.

Still, there are children, and I could not let him pay my fare to America. As I said, it will not take me much longer to save the rest of my passage money. Then I shall go and perhaps become rich. Who knows, señor!\" Giusippe broke into a ringing laugh.  Mr. Cabot made no reply.  He was thinking.  Fearing that he had offended, Giusippe changed the subject.  \"But I weary you with my affairs, señor. Pardon. Shall we go on to St. Mark's?\"  It was but a few steps across the piazza, and they were soon inside the church. Then for the first time Mr. Cabot spoke.  \"This church, Jean,\" said he, \"is the link between the old art of the Mohammedans and the Gothic art of the Christian era. It was planned as a Byzantine church, and in it one can see many things suggesting St. Sofia's at Constantinople. When St. Mark's at Alexandria was destroyed by the Mohammedans many of its treasures fell into the hands of the Doge of Venice, who promptly proclaimed St. Mark the new patron saint in place of St. Theodore and set about building a cathedral in which to put all the beautiful things he had acquired. Some parts of this ancient cathedral remain, but most of the church was built by Doge Contarini between 1063 and 1071. To the next Doge, Domenico Selvo, fell the task of decorating it. You see, over here the building of churches takes longer than it does at home.\"  \"I should think it did,\" answered Jean. \"Why, we think it is awful if our churches are not all done in two years.\"  Giusippe smiled.  \"Ah, we build not that way here, señorita,\" he said. \"Three centuries did our people spend in building into St. Mark's the marble carvings brought from the East; erecting the altars; and adorning the walls. These mosaics alone it took workmen two hundred and fifty years to fashion. Venice was a rich Republic, you see, and could well afford to put into this cathedral the money she might have spent on war. Above the slabs of marble are the mosaics, señorita. So it was in St. Sofia, my father told me; the slabs of marble near the ground and the decoration above. This whole cathedral of ours is covered on all the walls with mosaics--pictures made from bits of glass put together to form scenes from the Bible or from history. Even the most ignorant people who had had no schooling could read such stories, could they not?\"  Jean nodded.  She was dazzled by the beauty of the place--by the soft light; the walls rich in gold and color; by the many wonderful things there were to be seen. She was interested, too, in the smoothly worn, uneven floor which showed where the piles beneath the church had settled.  \"Mosaic makers, you know, Jean, began crude attempts at making pictures in glass thousands of years ago, for glass-making was familiar to the Egyptians as well as to the Phoenicans and Syrians. The Greeks and Romans, too, were great glass-makers. So glass-making came down through the ages. The Byzantine churches usually were lighted by a row of tiny glass windows round the base of the dome. Some of this ancient glass still remains in St. Sofia. The common way of making such windows was to cut a design in a slab of marble or plaster, and then insert small pieces of colored glass. Sometimes, too, a pattern for wall decoration was worked out by sticking fragments of glass into soft stucco. So the first mosaic work began. We can see some of it in the museums of England.\"  \"There seems to be a great deal to see in those London museums, Uncle Bob,\" Jean gasped.  \"I am afraid you will be more convinced of that fact than ever when you get there,\" chuckled Uncle Bob. \"But to return to Giusippe's mosaics. You may remember, perhaps, that when the Mohammedans invaded Constantinople and found how important a part the glass-makers played in decorating the churches, they at once handed the artisans over to the caliphs, that they might be set to work adorning their mosques. Now the Mohammedans believed it a crime to make a copy of either man or woman in a picture, a carving, or a statue. It was punishable to pay reverence to sacred figures; therefore all decoration in their churches took the form of flowers, fruit, or conventional designs. So no great mosaic pictures with figures such as these were made. Between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries Damascus became the center of glass-making, and there are in existence in some of the museums old Arab lamps which hung in the mosques with inscriptions from the Koran engraved upon them. It is Giusippe's St. Mark's which revived the art of mosaic making, and served as the bridge between those Pagan days and the days when with Christianity the arts revived and mosaic makers began to represent in glass figures of Christ and the saints.\"  \"And then the painters came, as Giusippe has said,\" put in Jean.  \"Yes, the great artists were born, and from that time pictures on canvas instead of pictures of glass decorated the churches. But the mosaic makers did an important service to art, for it was they who indirectly gave to the world the idea of making stained-glass windows. And in Venice those who ceased to make mosaics made instead the beautiful Venetian glass of which Giusippe has told us.\"  \"And are there no mosaics made now, Uncle Bob?\" asked Jean.  \"Yes. When in 1858 it became necessary to restore some of the mosaics in St. Mark's, a descendant of one of the old Murano glass workers named Radi, together with a Dr. Salviati, started a factory on the Grand Canal, where they gradually revived some of the past glory of Venice. They copied the old time glass products, making Arab lamps such as hung in the mosques; cameo work similar to the Naples and Portland vases; and pictures in mosaic. It was they who did The Last Supper for Westminster Abbey, and the mosaics for Albert Memorial Hall in London.\"  \"But Salviati's mosaics were not like those here, señor,\" put in Giusippe, \"because the San Marco mosaics were constructed upon the walls, small cubes of glass being pressed into the moist cement to make the picture. This gave a rough, irregular surface which artists say is far more artistic than is Salviati's smooth, glassy work. When Salviati sent mosaics away he made them here, and then backed them with cement so they could be placed on a slab of solid material and transported great distances from Venice. His pictures, it is true, were far more perfectly done than were the old mosaics--too perfectly, I have heard glass experts say.\"  \"Undoubtedly they are right, Giusippe, for the roughness in the ancient mosaics would, of course, break up the great plain surfaces and make them more interesting. But Salviati did Venice a service, nevertheless, in reviving the art. And there is, too, another virtue about mosaics, and that is that they will endure far longer than paintings. Had it not been for the foresight of Pope Urban, who between 1600 and 1700 had many of the famous pictures of the Vatican copied in mosaic, these masterpieces would have been lost to the world.\"  \"I have been told that the church in Ravenna has some fine mosaics, but I never have seen them,\" Giusippe ventured.  \"I have. They are beautiful, and I hope you may see them some time. Then there are others scattered through the various churches of Sicily and Rome; and there are also many beautiful inlays of mosaic decorating the old churches and palaces of European cities. When we visit Westminster Abbey, Jean, I must show you the crude early mosaic work on the tomb of Edward the Confessor. It is very curious, for it is made of pieces of colored glass set in grooves of marble.\"  \"How much you are to see, señorita,\" observed Giusippe wistfully.  Mr. Cabot fixed his eyes attentively on the boy.  \"Should you, too, like to see all these wonders, Giusippe?\" he asked half playfully and half in earnest.  But Giusippe, who did not catch the banter in his tone, answered seriously:  \"Should I? Ah, señor, it is not for me to envy or be unhappy about that which I may not have. Some day, perhaps, when I have made my fortune in your country I can return to the old world and see its marvels. I must have a little patience, that is all.\"  The mingling of sadness and longing in the reply touched Uncle Bob; Jean and the young Venetian chattered on, but Mr. Cabot walked silently ahead, deep in thought.  \"Did I understand you to say, Giusippe,\" he asked at last turning abruptly, \"that you have no relatives in Venice?\"  \"None in all the world with the exception of the uncle in America of whom I told you, señor.\"  Again there was a pause.  \"Suppose I were to take you with us.\"  \"What, señor?\"  \"Take you with us now, when we leave Venice.\"  \"I do not understand.\"  \"Suppose I asked you to go with us to France and England, and then across to America.\"  \"But I have not enough money, señor.\"  \"I haven't much, either,\" Mr. Cabot answered, smiling kindly into the boy's puzzled eyes. \"Still, I think I could get together a sufficient sum to pay your way until you got to the United States and found work.\"  \"To go--to go with you now, do you mean, señor?\"  \"Yes. We leave Venice next week for France. You see, I like you, Giusippe; we all do. And in addition to that you have done us a service. But more than anything else I feel that, once started, you are capable of making your way and doing well in life; all you need is a chance. I have perfect faith that if I took you to America you would make good. It would cost very little more were you to join us, and no doubt you could help in many little ways during the trip. Do you speak French at all?\"  \"Yes, some; but more German. It is nothing. Many travelers come to Venice, and one must talk to them. Then, too, here it is not unusual to speak several languages, because the countries lie near together, and the people come and go from place to place. With you it is different; a mighty sea divides you from the rest of the world.\"  \"Despite all your excuses for"]]]
