PUTNAM'S SONS   NEW YORK AND LONDON   The Knickerbocker Press    COPYRIGHT, 1907   BY   WILLIAM TYLER OLCOTT   COPYRIGHT, 1914   BY   WILLIAM TYLER OLCOTT   (For Second Edition)  [Illustration: The Knickerbocker Press, New York]  _Printed in the United States of America_     INTRODUCTION.   Considering the ease with which a knowledge of the constellations can be acquired, it seems a remarkable fact that so few are conversant with these time-honored configurations of the heavens. Aside from a knowledge of \"the Dipper\" and \"the Pleiades,\" the constellations to the vast majority, are utterly unknown.  To facilitate and popularize if possible this fascinating recreation of star-gazing the author has designed this field-book. It is limited in scope solely to that purpose, and all matter of a technical or theoretical nature has been omitted.  The endeavor has been to include in these pages only such matter as the reader can observe with the naked eye, or an opera-glass. Simplicity and brevity have been aimed at, the main idea being that whatever is bulky or verbose is a hindrance rather than a help when actually engaged in the observation of the heavens.  The constellations embraced in this manual are only those visible from the average latitude of the New England and Middle States, and owe their place in the particular season in which they are found to the fact that in that season they are favorably situated for observation.  With this brief explanatory note of the purpose and design of the book, the author proceeds to outline the scheme of study.     SCHEME OF STUDY.   The table of contents shows the scheme of study to be pursued, and to facilitate the work it is desirable that the student follow the therein circumscribed order.  A knowledge on the part of the reader of Ursa Major, or \"the Dipper\" as it is commonly called, and \"the Pleiades,\" the well-known group in Taurus, is presupposed by the author.  With this knowledge as a basis, the student is enabled in any season to take up the study of the constellations. By following out the order dictated, he will in a few nights of observation be enabled to identify the various configurations making up the several constellations that are set apart for study in that particular season.  A large plate, showing the appearance of the heavens at a designated time on the first night of the quarter, is inserted before each season's work. This should be consulted by the student before he makes an observation, in order that he may obtain a comprehensive idea of the relative position of the constellations, and also know in what part of the heavens to locate the constellation which he wishes to identify.  A knowledge of one constellation enables the student to determine the position of the next in order. In this work, the identification of each constellation depends on a knowledge of what precedes, always bearing in mind the fact that each season starts as a new and distinct part to be taken by itself, and has no bearing on that which comes before.

The diagrams, it will be observed, are grouped under the seasons, and they indicate the positions of the constellations as they appear at 9 o'clock P.M. in mid-season.  To facilitate finding and observing the constellations, the student should face in the direction indicated in the text. This applies to all constellations excepting those near the zenith.  The four large plates are so arranged that the observer is supposed to be looking at the southern skies. By turning the plate about from left to right, the eastern, northern, and western skies are shown successively.  On many of the diagrams the position of nebulæ is indicated. These are designated by the initial letter of the astronomer who catalogued them, preceded by his catalogue number, as for instance 8 M. signifies nebula number 8 in Messier's catalogue.  The magnitudes assigned to the stars in the diagrams are derived from the Harvard Photometry. When a star is midway between two magnitudes the numeral is underlined, thus _2_, indicates a star of magnitude 2.5.  If a star's magnitude is between 1 and 1.5 it is regarded as a first-magnitude star. If it lies between 1.5 and 2 it is designated second magnitude.     THE CONSTELLATIONS OF SPRING.  [Illustration: Map showing the principal stars visible from Lat. 40° N. at 9 o'clock April 1st.]     URSA MAJOR (er´sa mā´-jor)--THE GREAT BEAR. (Face North.)   LOCATION.--Ursa Major is probably the best known of the constellations, and in this work I presuppose that the reader is familiar with its position in the heavens. It is one of the most noted and conspicuous constellations in the northern hemisphere, and is readily and unmistakably distinguished from all others by means of a remarkable cluster of seven bright stars in the northern heavens, forming what is familiarly termed \"The Dipper.\"  The stars α and β are called the pointers, because they always point toward the Pole Star, 28¾° distant from α.  Alioth is very nearly opposite Shedir in Cassiopeia, and at an equal distance from the Pole. The same can be said of Megres, in Ursa Major, and Caph, in Cassiopeia.  The star ο is at the tip of the Bear's nose. A clearly defined semicircle begins at ο and ends in the pair ι and κ at the extremity of the Bear's right fore paw. This group of stars resembles a sickle. Note little Alcor close to Mizar. This star was used by the Arabs as a test of good eyesight.  Mizar and Alcor are known as the horse and his rider.  This plate shows the Bear lying on his back, his feet projected up the sky; three conspicuous pairs of stars represent three of his four feet.  The Chaldean shepherds and the Iroquois Indians gave to this constellation the same name. The Egyptians called it \"The Thigh.\"  α and η are moving through space in a contrary direction to the remaining five stars in \"The Dipper.\"  [Illustration: URSA MAJOR]     URSA MINOR (er´-sa mi´-nor)--THE LITTLE BEAR. (Face North.)   LOCATION.--The two pointer stars in Ursa Major indicate the position of Polaris, the North Star, which represents the tip of the tail of the Little Bear, and the end of the handle of the \"Little Dipper.\" In all ages of the world, Ursa Minor has been more universally observed and more carefully noticed than any other constellation, on account of the importance of the North Star.  Polaris is a little more than 1¼° from the true pole. Its light takes fifty years to reach us.  A line joining β Cassiopeiæ, and Megres, in Ursa Major, will pass through Polaris.  At the distance of the nearest fixed star our sun would shine as a star no brighter than Polaris which is presumably about the sun's size.  Polaris revolves around the true pole once in twenty-four hours in a little circle 2½° in diameter. Within this circle two hundred stars have been photographed.  The North Star is always elevated as many degrees above the horizon as the observer is north of the equator.  Compare the light of the four stars forming the bowl of the \"Little Dipper,\" as they are each of a different magnitude. A standard first-magnitude star is 2½ times brighter than a standard second magnitude star, etc.  [Illustration: URSA MINOR]     GEMINI (jem´-i-ni)--THE TWINS. (Face West.)   LOCATION.--A line drawn from β to κ Ursæ Majoris and prolonged an equal distance ends near Castor, in Gemini. Gemini is characterized by two nearly parallel rows of stars. The northern row if extended would reach Taurus, the southern one Orion. Note the fine cluster 35 M. Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781 a short distance southwest of it. Two wonderful streams of little stars run parallel northwest on each side of the cluster. Where the ecliptic crosses the solstitial colure is the spot where the sun appears to be when it is farthest north of the equator, June 21st. Castor is a fine double for a telescope, and Pollux has three little attendant stars. An isoceles triangle is formed by Castor, Aldebaran in Taurus, and Capella in Auriga. There is a record of an occultation in Gemini noted about the middle of the fourth century B.C.  The Arabs saw in this group of stars two peacocks, the Egyptians two sprouting plants, and the Hindus twin deities, while in the Buddhist zodiac they represented a woman holding a golden cord. Since classic times, however, the figure has always been that of human twins.  At the point indicated near θ a new star was discovered by Enebo in March, 1912. It attained a maximum of about magnitude 3.5 and has at this writing waned to the eleventh magnitude.  [Illustration: GEMINI]     AURIGA (â-ri´-ga)--THE CHARIOTEER. (Face Northwest.)   LOCATION.--A line drawn from δ to α Ursæ Majoris, and prolonged about 45°, ends near the bright Capella, in Auriga, a star of the first magnitude, and one of the most brilliant in the heavens. It is unmistakable, having no rival in brightness near it. Auriga is a beautiful and conspicuous constellation. It is characterized by a clearly defined pentagon. Note the three fourth-magnitude stars near Capella known as \"The Kids.\" The star β is common to Auriga and Taurus, being the former's right foot and the latter's northern horn. The field within the pentagon is particularly rich in clusters. Capella forms a rude square with Polaris, ε Cassiopeiæ, and ο Ursæ Majoris, and forms an equilateral triangle with Betelgeuze in Orion, and the Pleiades in Taurus.  A line from θ to α Aurigæ prolonged about 20° ends near α Persei.  Capella is visible at some hour of every clear night throughout the year. Of the first-magnitude stars it is nearest to the Pole, and it rises almost exactly in the northeast.  To the Arabs Capella was \"The Driver,\" because it seemed to rise earlier than the other stars and so apparently watched over them, or still more practically as \"The Singer\" who rode before the procession cheering on the camels, which last were represented by the Pleiades.  [Illustration: AURIGA]     CANCER (kan´-ser)--THE CRAB. (Face West.)   LOCATION.--Cancer lies between Gemini and Leo. A line drawn from Nath in Auriga to Pollux in Gemini, and prolonged about 15°, ends in Præsepe, the Manger, the great star cluster in Cancer, which is also called \"The Bee Hive.\" It contains 300 stars. The stars γ and δ are called the Aselli--the ass's colts feeding from the silver manger.  The star β lies about 10° northeast of Procyon. Acubens, α lies on the same line the same distance beyond β. These two stars form the tips of the inverted \"Y\" which distinguishes Cancer.  An imaginary line from Capella through Pollux will point out Acubens. Close to it are two faint stars. The Bee Hive lies within an irregular square formed by γ, δ, η, and θ, and looks like a nebula to the naked eye.  In June, 1895, all the planets except Neptune were in this quarter of the heavens, and Halley's comet was in this constellation on its first appearance in 1531.  The dimness of γ and δ is an infallible precursor of rain, and if the Bee Hive is not visible in a clear sky, it is a presage of a violent storm.  [Illustration: CANCER]     HYDRA (hi´-dra)--THE SEA-SERPENT. (Face South and Southwest.)   LOCATION.--The head of Hydra, a striking and beautiful arrangement of stars, lies just below the Bee Hive, in Cancer, 6° south of Acubens in that constellation, and forms a rhomboidal figure of five stars.  Hydra is about 100° in length and reaches almost from Canis Minor to Libra. Its stars are all faint except Alphard, or the Hydra's heart, a second-magnitude star remarkable for its lonely situation, southwest of Regulus, in Leo. A line drawn from γ Leonis through Regulus points it out. It is of a rich orange tint. Castor and Pollux, in Gemini, point southeast to it.  The constellations Crater, the Cup, and Corvus, the Crow, both stand on the coils of Hydra, south of Denebola, the bright star in the tail of the Lion.  Hydra is supposed to be the snake shown on a uranographic stone from the Euphrates, 1200 B.C.  The little asterism Sextans, the Sextant, lies in the region between Regulus and Alphard. It contains no stars brighter than the fourth magnitude.  [Illustration: HYDRA]     LEO (le´o)--THE LION. (Face South.)   LOCATION.--A line drawn from"]]]
