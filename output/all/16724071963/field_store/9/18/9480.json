The men refused this wager of battle, but fortune favored this doughty little cavalier, for presently a great storm arose.  As neither Talavera nor any of the men were navigators or seamen, they had to release Ojeda.  He took charge.  Once he was in charge, they never succeeded in ousting him.  In spite of his seamanship, the caravel was wrecked on the island of Cuba.  They were forced to make their way along the shore, which was then unsettled by Spain.  Under the leadership of Ojeda the party struggled eastward under conditions of extreme hardship.  When they were most desperate, Ojeda, who had appealed daily to his little picture of the Virgin, which he always carried with him, and had not ceased to urge the others to do likewise, made a vow to establish a shrine and leave the picture at the first Indian village they came to if they got succor there.  Sure enough, they did reach a place called Cueyabos, where they were hospitably received by the Indians, and where Ojeda, fulfilling his vow, erected a log hut, or shrine, in the recess of which he left, with much regret, the picture of the Virgin which had accompanied {17} him on his wanderings and adventures.  Means were found to send word to Jamaica, still under the governorship of Esquivel, whose head Ojeda had threatened to cut off when he met him.  Magnanimously forgetting the purpose of the broken adventurer, Esquivel despatched a ship to bring him to Jamaica.  We may be perfectly sure that Ojeda said nothing about the decapitation when the generous hearted Esquivel received him with open arms.  Ojeda with Talavera and his comrades were sent back to Santo Domingo.  There Talavera and the principal men of his crew were tried for piracy and executed.  Ojeda found that Encisco had gone.  He was penniless, discredited and thoroughly downcast by his ill fortune.  No one would advance him anything to send succor to San Sebastian.  His indomitable spirit was at last broken by his misfortunes.  He lingered for a short time in constantly increasing ill health, being taken care of by the good Franciscans, until he died in the monastery.  Some authorities say he became a monk; others deny it; it certainly is quite possible.  At any rate, before he died he put on the habit of the order, and after his death, by his own direction, his body was buried before the gate, so that those who passed through it would have to step over his remains. Such was the tardy humility with which he endeavoured to make up for the arrogance and pride of his exciting life.   IV. Enter One Vasco Nuñez de Balboa  Encisco, coasting along the shore with a large ship, carrying reënforcements and loaded with provisions for the party, easily followed the course of Ojeda's {18} wanderings, and finally ran across the final remnants of his expedition in the harbor of Cartagena.  The remnant was crowded into a single small, unseaworthy brigantine under the command of Francisco Pizarro.  Pizarro had scrupulously kept faith with Ojeda.  He had done more.  He had waited fifty days, and then, finding that the two brigantines left to him were not large enough to contain his whole party, by mutual agreement of the survivors clung to the death-laden spot until a sufficient number had been killed or had died to enable them to get away in the two ships.  They did not have to wait long, for death was busy, and a few weeks after the expiration of the appointed time they were all on board.  There is something terrific to the imagination in the thought of that body of men sitting down and grimly waiting until enough of them should die to enable the rest to get away!  What must have been the emotions that filled their breasts as the days dragged on?  No one knew whether the result of the delay would enable him to leave, or cause his bones to rot on the shore.  Cruel, fierce, implacable as were these Spaniards, there is something Homeric about them in such crises as these.  That was not the end of their misfortunes, for one of the two brigantines was capsized.  The old chroniclers say that the boat was struck by a great fish.  That is a fish story, which, like most fish stories, it is difficult to credit.  At any rate, sink it did, with all on board, and Pizarro and about thirty men were all that were left of the gallant three hundred who had followed the doughty Ojeda in the first attempt to colonize South America.  Encisco was for hanging them at once, believing that {19} they had murdered and deserted Ojeda, but they were able to convince him at last of the strict legality of their proceedings.  Taking command of the expedition himself, as being next in rank to Ojeda, the Bachelor led them back to San Sebastian.  Unfortunately, before the unloading of his ship could be begun, she struck a rock and was lost; and the last state of the men, therefore, was as bad as the first.  Among the men who had come with Encisco was a certain Vasco Nuñez, commonly called Balboa.  He had been with Bastidas and La Cosa on their voyage to the Isthmus nine years before.  The voyage had been a profitable one and Balboa had made money out of it.  He had lost all his money, however, and had eked out a scanty living on a farm at Hispaniola, which he had been unable to leave because he was in debt to everybody.  The authorities were very strict in searching every vessel that cleared from Santo Domingo, for absconders.  The search was usually conducted after the vessel had got to sea, too!  Balboa caused himself to be conveyed aboard the ship in a provision cask.  No one suspected anything, and when the officers of the boat had withdrawn from the ship and Hispaniola was well down astern, he came forth.  Encisco, who was a pettifogger of the most pronounced type, would have dealt harshly with him, but there was nothing to do after all.  Balboa could not be sent back, and besides, he was considered a very valuable reënforcement on account of his known experience and courage.  It was he who now came to the rescue of the wretched colonists at San Sebastian by telling them that across the Gulf of Darien there was an Indian tribe with many villages and much gold.  Furthermore, these {20} Indians, unfortunately for them, were not acquainted with the use of poisoned arrows.  Balboa urged them to go there.  His suggestion was received with cheers.  The brigantines, and such other vessels as they could construct quickly, were got ready and the whole party took advantage of the favorable season to cross the Gulf of Darien to the other side, to the present territory of Panama which has been so prominent in the public eye of late.  This was Nicuesa's domain, but nobody considered that at the time.  They found the Indian villages which Balboa had mentioned, fought a desperate battle with Cacique Cemaco, captured the place, and discovered quantities of gold castellanos (upward of twenty-five thousand dollars).  They built a fort, and laid out a town called Maria de la Antigua del Darien--the name being almost bigger than the town! Balboa was in high favor by this time, and when Encisco got into trouble by decreeing various oppressive regulations and vexatious restrictions, attending to things in general with a high hand, they calmly deposed him on the ground that he had no authority to act, since they were on the territory of Nicuesa.  To this logic, which was irrefutable, poor Encisco could make no reply.  Pending the arrival of Nicuesa they elected Balboa and one Zamudio, a Biscayan, to take charge of affairs.  The time passed in hunting and gathering treasure, not unprofitably and, as they had plenty to eat, not unpleasantly.   V. The Desperate Straits of Nicuesa  Now let us return to Nicuesa.  Making a landfall, Nicuesa, with a small caravel, attended by the two {21} brigantines, coasted along the shore seeking a favorable point for settlement.  The large ships, by his orders, kept well out to sea.  During a storm, Nicuesa put out to sea himself, imagining that the brigantines under the charge of Lope de Olano, second in command would follow him.  When morning broke and the storm disappeared there were no signs of the ships or brigantines.  Nicuesa ran along the shore to search for them, got himself embayed in the mouth of a small river, swollen by recent rains, and upon the sudden subsidence of the water coincident with the ebb of the tide, his ship took ground, fell over on her bilge and was completely wrecked. The men on board barely escaped with their lives to the shore.  They had saved nothing except what they wore, the few arms they carried and one small boat.  Putting Diego de Ribero and three sailors in the boat and directing them to coast along the shore, Nicuesa with the rest struggled westward in search of the two brigantines and the other three ships.  They toiled through interminable forests and morasses for several days, living on what they could pick up in the way of roots and grasses, without discovering any signs of the missing vessels.  Coming to an arm of the sea, supposed to be Chiriqui Lagoon off Costa Rica, in the course of their journeyings, they decided to cross it in a small boat rather than make the long detour necessary to get to what they believed to be the other side.  They were ferried over to the opposite shore in the boat, and to their dismay discovered that they were upon an almost desert island.  It was too late and they were too tired, to go farther that night, so they resolved to pass the night on the {22} island.  In the morning they were appalled to find that the little boat, with Ribero and the three sailors, was gone.  They were marooned on a desert island with practically nothing to eat and nothing but brackish swamp water to drink.  The sailors they believed to have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20910"],["title","South American Fights and Fighters, and Other Tales of Adventure (#4)"],["body","them.  They gave way to transports of despair.  Some in their grief threw themselves down and died forthwith.  Others sought to prolong life by eating herbs, roots and the like.  They were reduced to the condition of wild animals, when a sail whitened the horizon, and presently the two brigantines dropped anchor near the island.  Ribero was no recreant.  He had been convinced that Nicuesa was going farther and farther from the ships with every step that he took, and, unable to persuade him of that fact, he deliberately took matters into his own hands and retraced his course.  The event justified his decision, for he soon found the brigantines and the other ships.  Olano does not seem to have bestirred himself very vigorously to seek for Nicuesa, perhaps because he hoped to command himself; but when Ribero made his report he at once made for the island, which he reached just in time to save the miserable remnant from dying of starvation.  As soon as he could command himself, Nicuesa, whose easy temper and generous disposition had left him under the hardships and misfortunes he had sustained, sentenced Olano to death.  By the pleas of his comrades, the sentence was mitigated, and the wretched man was bound in chains and forced to grind corn for the rest of the party--when there was any to grind.  To follow Nicuesa's career further would be simply to chronicle the story of increasing disaster.  He lost {23} ship after ship and man after man.  Finally reduced in number to one hundred men, one of the sailors, which had been with Columbus remembered the location of Porto Rico as being a haven where they might establish themselves in a fertile and beautiful country, well-watered and healthy.  Columbus had left an anchor under the tree to mark the place, and when they reached it they found that the anchor had remained undisturbed all the years. They were attacked by the Indians there, and after losing twenty killed, were forced to put to sea in two small brigantines and a caravel, which they had made from the wrecks of their ships.  Coasting along the shore, they came at last to an open roadstead where they could debark.  \"In the name of God,\" said the disheartened Nicuesa, \"let us stop here.\"  There they landed, called the place after their leader's exclamation, Nombre de Dios.  The caravel, with a crew of the strongest, was despatched for succour, and was never heard of again.  One day, the colonists of Antigua were surprised by the sound of a cannon shot.  They fired their own weapons in reply, and soon two ships carrying reënforcements for Nicuesa under Rodrigo de Colmenares, dropped anchor in front of the town.  By this time the colonists had divided into factions, some favoring the existing régime, others inclining toward the still busy Encisco, others desirous of putting themselves under the command of Nicuesa, whose generosity and sunny disposition were still affectionately remembered. The arrival of Colmenares and his party, gave the Nicuesa faction a decided preponderance; and, taking things in their own hands, they determined to despatch one of the ships, with two {24} representatives of the colony, up the coast in search of the governor.  This expedition found Nicuesa without much difficulty.  Again the rescuing ship arrived just in time.  In a few days more, the miserable body of men, reduced now to less than sixty, would have perished of starvation.  Nicuesa's spirit had not been chastened by his unparalleled misfortunes.  He not only accepted the proffered command of the colony--which was no more than his right, since it was established on his own territory--but he did more.  When he heard that the colonists had amassed a great amount of gold by trading and thieving, he harshly declared that, as they had no legitimate right there, he would take their portion for himself; that he would stop further enterprises on their part--in short, he boastfully declared his intention of carrying things with a high hand in a way well calculated to infuriate his voluntary subjects.  So arrogant was his bearing and so tactless and injudicious his talk, that the envoys from Antigua fled in the night with one of the ships and reported the situation to the colony.  Olano, still in chains, found means to communicate with his friends in the other party.  Naturally he painted the probable conduct of the governor in anything but flattering colors.  All this was most impolitic in Nicuesa.  He seemed to have forgotten that profound political principle which suggests that a firm seat in the saddle should be acquired before any attempts should be made to lead the procession.  The fable of \"King Stork and the Frogs\" was applicable to the situation of the colonists.  In this contingency they did not know quite what to do.  It was Balboa who came to their rescue again.  {25} He suggested that, although they had invited him, they need not permit Nicuesa to land.  Accordingly, when Nicuesa hove in sight in the other ship, full of determination to carry things in his own way, they prevented him from coming ashore.  Greatly astonished, he modified his tone somewhat, but to no avail.  It was finally decided among the colonists to allow him to land in order to seize his person.  Arrangements were made accordingly, and the unsuspicious Nicuesa debarked from his ship the day after his arrival. He was immediately surrounded by a crowd of excited soldiers menacing and threatening him.  It was impossible for him to make headway against them.  He turned and fled.  Among his other gubernatorial accomplishments was a remarkable fleetness of foot.  The poor little governor scampered over the sands at a great pace.  He distanced his fierce pursuers at last and escaped to the temporary shelter of the woods.  Balboa, a gentleman by birth and by inclination as well--who had, according to some accounts, endeavored to compose the differences between Nicuesa and the colonists--was greatly touched and mortified at seeing so brave a cavalier reduced to such an undignified and desperate extremity.  He secretly sought Nicuesa that night and profferred him his services.  Then he strove valiantly to bring about an adjustment between the fugitive and the brutal soldiery, but in vain.  Nicuesa, abandoning all his pretensions, at last begged them to receive him, if not as a governor, at least as a companion-at-arms, a volunteer.  But nothing, neither the influence of Balboa nor the entreaties {26} of Nicuesa, could mitigate the anger of the colonists. They would not have the little governor with them on any terms.  They would have killed him then and there, but Balboa, by resorting to harsh measures, even causing one man to be flogged for his insolence, at last changed that purpose into another--which, to be sure, was scarcely less hazardous for Nicuesa.  He was to be given a ship and sent away forever from the Isthmus. Seventeen adherents offered manfully to share his fate.  Protesting against the legality of the action, appealing to them to give him a chance for humanity's sake, poor Nicuesa was hurried aboard a small, crazy bark, the weakest of the wretched brigantines in the harbor. This was a boat so carelessly constructed that the calking of the seams had been done with a blunt iron.  With little or no provisions, Nicuesa and his faithful seventeen were forced to put to sea amid the jeers and mockery of the men on shore.  The date was March 1, 1511.  According to the chroniclers, the last words that those left on the island heard Nicuesa say were, \"Show thy face, O Lord, and we shall be saved.\" [5]  A pathetic and noble departure!  Into the misty deep then vanished poor Nicuesa and his faithful followers on that bright sunny spring morning.  And none of them ever came back to tell the tale of what became of them.  Did they die of starvation in their crazy brigantine, drifting on and on while they rotted in the blazing sun, until her seams opened and she sank?  Did they founder in one of the sudden and fierce storms which sometimes swept {27} that coast?  Did the deadly teredo bore the ship's timbers full of holes, until she went down with all on board?  Were they cast on shore to become the prey of Indians whose enmity they had provoked by their own conduct?  No one ever knew.  It was reported that years afterward on the coast of Veragua some wandering adventurers found this legend, almost undecipherable, cut in the bark of a tree, \"_Aqui anduvo el desdichado Diego de Nicuesa_,\" which may be translated, \"Here was lost the unfortunate Diego de Nicuesa.\"  But the statement is not credited.  The fate of the gallant little gentleman is one of the mysteries of the sea.  Of the original eleven hundred men who sailed with the two governors there remained perhaps thirty of Ojeda's and forty of Nicuesa's at Antigua with Encisco's command.  This was the net result of the first two years of effort at the beginning of government in South America on the Isthmus of Panama, with its ocean on the other side still undreamed of.  What these men did there, and how Balboa rose to further prominence, his great exploits, and finally how unkind Fate also overtook him, will form the subject of the next paper.    [1] At least, the assertion is gravely made by the ancient chroniclers. I wonder what kind of an outfielder he would have made today.
