There is a pretty park at the back of the town, and we walked about it, and sat under the trees, and looked at the flowers, and the fountain playing, and enjoyed it ever so much. If it had been summer, and we had been at home, we shouldn't have cared so much for these things; but sitting under trees, and lounging about over the green grass, while our folks at home were up to their eyes, or thereabouts, in snow and ice, delighted both of us, especially Rectus. I never heard him talk so much.  We reached Savannah on Tuesday, and were to leave in the steamer for St. Augustine Thursday afternoon. Thursday morning we went out to the cemetery of Bonaventure, one of the loveliest places in the whole world, where there are long avenues of live-oaks that stretch from one side of the road to the other, like great covered arbors, and from every limb of every tree hang great streamers of gray moss, four and five feet long. It was just wonderful to look at. The whole place seemed dripping with waving fringe. Rectus said it looked to him as if this was a graveyard for old men, and that every old fellow had had to hang his beard on a tree before he went down into his grave.  This was a curious idea for Rectus to have, and the colored man who was driving us--we went out in style, in a barouche, but I wouldn't do that kind of thing again without making a bargain beforehand--turned around to look at him as if he thought he was a little crazy. Rectus was certainly in high spirits. There was a sort of change coming over him. His eyes had a sparkle in them that I never saw before. No one could say that he didn't take interest in things now. I think the warm weather had something to do with it.  \"I tell you what it is, Gordon,\" said he,--he still called me Gordon, and I didn't insist on \"Mr.,\" because I thought that, on the whole, perhaps it wouldn't do,--\"I'm waking up. I feel as if I had been asleep all my life, and was just beginning to open my eyes.\"  A graveyard seemed a queer place to start out fresh in this way, but it wasn't long before I found that, if Rectus hadn't really wakened up, he could kick pretty hard in his sleep.  Nothing much happened on the trip down to St. Augustine, for we travelled nearly all the way by night. Early the next morning we were lying off that old half Spanish town, wishing the tide would rise so that we could go in. There is a bar between two islands that lie in front of the town, and you have to go over that to get into the harbor. We were on the \"Tigris,\" the Bahama steamer that touched at St. Augustine on her way to Nassau, and she couldn't get over that bar until high tide. We were dreadfully impatient, for we could see the old town, with its trees, all green and bright, and its low, wide houses, and a great light-house, marked like a barber's pole or a stick of old-fashioned mint-candy, and, what was best of all, a splendid old castle, or fort, built by the Spaniards three hundred years ago! We declared we would go there the moment we set foot on shore. In fact, we soon had about a dozen plans for seeing the town.  If we had been the pilots, we would have bumped that old steamer over the bar, somehow or other, long before the real pilot started her in; but we had to wait. When we did go in, and steamed along in front of the old fort, we could see that it was gray and crumbling, and moss-covered in places, and it was just like an oil-painting. The whole town, in fact, was like an oil-painting to us.  The moment the stairs were put down, we scuffled ashore, and left the steamer to go on to the Bahamas whenever she felt like it. We gave our valises and trunk-checks to a negro man with a wagon, and told him to take the baggage to a hotel that we could see from the wharf, and then we started off for the fort. But on my way along the wharf I made up my mind that, as the fort had been there for three hundred years, it would probably stand a while longer, and that we had better go along with our baggage, and see about getting a place to live in, for we were not going to be in any hurry to leave St. Augustine.  We didn't go to any hotel at all. I had a letter of introduction to a Mr. Cholott, and on our way up from the wharf, I heard some one call out that name to a gentleman. So I remembered my letter, and went up and gave it to him. He was a first-rate man, and when we told him where we were going, we had quite a talk, and he said he would advise us to go to a boarding-house. It would be cheaper, and if we were like most boys that he knew, we'd like it better. He said that board could be had with several families that he knew, and that some of the Minorcans took boarders in the winter.  Of course, Rectus wanted to know, right away, what a Minorcan was. I didn't think it was exactly the place to ask questions which probably had long answers, but Mr. Cholott didn't seem to be in a hurry, and he just started off and told us about the Minorcans. A chap called Turnbull, more than a hundred years ago, brought over to Florida a lot of the natives of the island of Minorca, in the Mediterranean, and began a colony. But he was a mean sort of chap; he didn't care for anything but making money out of the Minorcans, and it wasn't long before they found it out, for he was really making slaves of them. So they just rose up and rebelled, and left old Turnbull to run his colony by himself. Served him right, too. They started off on their own accounts, and most of them came to this town, where they settled, and have had a good time ever since. There are a great many of them here now, descendants of the original Minorcans, and they keep pretty much together and keep their old name, too. They look a good deal like Spaniards, Mr. Cholott said, and many of them are very excellent people.  Rectus took the greatest interest in these Minorcans, but we didn't take board with any of them. We went to the house of a lady who was a friend of Mr. Cholott, and she gave us a splendid room, that looked right out over the harbor. We could see the islands, and the light-house, and the bar with the surf outside, and even get a glimpse of the ocean. We saw the \"Tigris\" going out over the bar. The captain wanted to get out on the same tide he came in on, and he did not lose any time. As soon as she got fairly out to sea, we hurried down, to go to the fort. But first, Rectus said, we ought to go and buy straw hats. There were lots of men with straw hats in St. Augustine. This was true, for it was just as warm here as we have it in June, and we started off to look for a straw-hat store.  We found that we were in one of the queerest towns in the world. Rectus said it was all back-streets, and it looked something that way. The streets were very narrow, and none of them had any pavement but sand and powdered shell, and very few had any sidewalks. But they didn't seem to be needed. Many of the houses had balconies on the second story, which reached toward each other from both sides of the street, and this gave the town a sociable appearance. There were lots of shops, and most of them sold sea-beans. There were other things, like alligators' teeth, and shells, and curiosities, but the great trade of the town seemed to be in sea-beans.[A] Rectus and I each bought one for our watch-chains.  I think we tried on every straw hat in town, and we bought a couple in a little house, where two or three young women were making them. Rectus asked me, in a low voice, if I didn't think one of the young women was a Mohican. I hushed him up, for it was none of his business if she was. I had a good deal of trouble in making Rectus say \"Minorcan.\" Whenever we had met a dark-haired person, he had said to me: \"Do you think that is a Mohican?\" It was a part of his old school disposition to get things wrong in this way. But he never got angry when I corrected him. His temper was perfect.  I bought a common-sized hat, but Rectus bought one that spread out far and wide. It made him look like a Japanese umbrella. We stuffed our felt hats into our pockets, and started for the fort. But I looked at my watch and found it was supper-time. I had suspected it when I came out of the hat-shop. The sea-trip and fine air here had given us tremendous appetites, which our walk had sharpened.  So we turned back at once and hurried home, agreeing to begin square on the fort the next day.  FOOTNOTES:  [A] Sea-beans are seeds of a West Indian tree. They are of different colors, very hard, and capable of being handsomely polished. They are called \"sea-beans\" because great numbers of them drift up on the Florida and adjacent coasts.     CHAPTER IV.  TO THE RESCUE.   The next morning, I was awakened by Rectus coming into the room.  \"Hello!\" said I; \"where have you been? I didn't hear you get up.\"  \"I called you once or twice,\" said Rectus, \"but you were sleeping so soundly I thought I'd let you alone. I knew you'd lost some sleep by being sick on the steamer.\"  \"That was only the first night,\" I exclaimed. \"I've made up that long ago. But what got you up so early?\"  \"I went out to take a warm salt-water bath before breakfast,\" answered Rectus. \"There's an eight-cornered bath-house right out here, almost under the window, where you can have your sea-water warm if you like it.\"  \"Do they pump it from the tropics?\" I asked, as I got up and began to dress.  \"No; they heat it in the bath-house. I had a first-rate bath, and I saw a Minorcan.\"  \"You don't say so!\" I cried. \"What was he like? Had he horns? And how did you know what he was?\"  \"I asked him,\" said Rectus.  \"Asked him!\" I exclaimed. \"You don't mean to say that you got up early and went around asking people if they were Mohicans!\"  \"Minorcans, I said.\"  \"Well, it's bad enough, even if you got the name right. Did you ask the man plump to his face?\"  \"Yes. But he first asked me what I was. He was an oldish man, and I met him just as I was coming out of the bath-house. He had a basket of clams on his arm, and I asked him"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20651"],["title","A Jolly Fellowship (#6)"],["body"," he caught them. That made him laugh, and he said he dug them out of the sand under the wharf. Then he asked me if my name was Cisneros, and when I told him it was not, he said that I looked like a Spaniard, and he thought that that might be my name. And so, as he had asked me about myself, I asked him if he was a Minorcan, and he said 'yes.'\"  \"And what then?\" I asked.  \"Nothing,\" said Rectus. \"He went on with his clams, and I came home.\"  \"You didn't seem to make much out of him, after all,\" said I. \"I don't wonder he thought you were a Spaniard, with that hat. I told you you'd make a show of yourself. But what are you going to do with your Minorcans, Rectus, when you catch them?\"  He laughed, but didn't mention his plans.  \"I didn't know how you got clams,\" he said. \"I thought you caught them some way. It would never have entered my head to dig for them.\"  \"There's lots to learn in this town about fish, and ever so many other things besides; and I tell you what it is, Rectus, as soon as we get through with the fort,--and I don't know how long that will take us, for I heard on the steamer that it had underground dungeons,--we'll go off on a first-class exploring expedition.\"  That suited Rectus exactly.  After breakfast we started for the fort. It is just outside of the town, and you can walk all the way on the sea-wall, which is about a yard wide on top,--just a little too wide for one fellow, but not quite wide enough for two.  The United States government holds the fort now, of course, and calls it Fort Marion, but the old Spanish name was San Marco, and we disdained to call it anything else. When we went over the drawbridge, and across the moat, we saw the arms of Spain on a shield over the great gate of the fort. We walked right in, into a wide hall, with dark door-ways on each side, and then out into a great inclosed space, like a parade-ground, in the centre of the fort, and here we saw a whole crowd of Indians. We didn't expect to find Indians here, and we were very much surprised. They did not wear Indian clothes, but were dressed in United States military uniform. They didn't look like anything but Indians, though, for all that. I asked one of them if he belonged here, and he smiled and said \"How?\" and held out his hand. We both shook it, but could make nothing out of him. A good many of them now came up and said \"How?\" to us, and shook hands, and we soon found that this meant \"How d' ye do?\" and was about all they knew of English.  [Illustration: \"HOW?\"]  We were lucky enough, before we got through shaking hands with our new friends, to see Mr. Cholott coming toward us, and he immediately took us in charge, and seemed to be glad to have a job of the kind. There was nothing about the fort that he didn't know. He told us that the Indians were prisoners, taken in the far West by United States troops, and that some of them were the worst Indians in the whole country. They were safe enough now, though, and were held here as hostages. Some were chiefs, and they were all noted men,--some as murderers, and others in less important ways. They had been here for some years, and a few of them could speak a little English.  He then took us all over the fort,--up an inclined plane to the top of the ramparts, and into the Indian barracks on one of the wide walls, where we saw a lot of Cheyennes and Kiowas, and Indians from other tribes, sitting around and making bows and arrows, and polishing sea-beans to sell to visitors. At each corner of the fort was a \"lookout tower,\"--a little box of a place, stuck out from the top of the wall, with loopholes and a long, narrow passage leading to it, with a high wall on each side to protect from bullets and arrows the man who went to look out. One of the towers had been knocked off, probably by a cannon-ball. These towers and slim little passages took our fancy greatly. Then Mr. Cholott took us downstairs to see the dungeons. He got the key and gave it to a big old Indian, named Red Horse, who went ahead with a lighted kerosene-lamp.  We first saw the dungeon where the Indian chief, Osceola, was shut up during the Seminole war. It was a dreary place. There was another chief, Wild Cat, who was imprisoned with Osceola, and one night Osceola \"boosted\" him to a high window, where he squeezed through the bars and got away. If Osceola had had any one to give him a lift, I suppose he would have been off, too. Rectus and I wondered how the two Indians managed this little question of who should be hoisted. Perhaps they tossed up, or perhaps Wild Cat was the lighter of the two. The worst dungeon, though, was a place that was discovered by accident about thirty years ago. There was nothing there when we went in; but, when it was first found, a chained skeleton was lying on the floor. Through a hole in the wall we crept into another dungeon, worse yet, in which two iron cages were found hung to the wall, with skeletons in them. It seemed like being in some other country to stand in this dark little dungeon, and hear these dreadful stories, while a big Indian stood grinning by, holding a kerosene-lamp.  Mr. Cholott told us that one of the cages and the bones could now be seen in Washington.  After Mr. Cholott went home, we tramped all over the fort again by ourselves, and that afternoon we sat on the outer wall that runs along the harbor-front of the fort, and watched the sail-boats and the fishermen in their \"dug-outs.\" There were a couple of sharks swimming up and down in front of the town, and every now and then they would come up and show themselves. They were the first sharks we had ever seen.  Rectus was worked up about the Indians. We had been told that, while a great many of the chiefs and braves imprisoned here were men known to have committed crimes, still there were others who had done nothing wrong, and had been captured and brought here as prisoners, simply because, in this way, the government would have a good hold on their tribes.  Rectus thought this was the worst kind of injustice, and I agreed with him, although I didn't see what we were going to do about it.  On our way home we met Rectus's Minorcan; he was a queer old fellow.  \"Hello!\" said he, when he saw Rectus. \"Have you been out catching clams?\"  We stopped and talked a little while about the sharks, and then the old man asked Rectus why he wanted to know, that morning, whether he was a Minorcan or not.  \"I just wanted to see one,\" said Rectus, as if he had been talking of kangaroos or giraffes. \"I've been thinking a good deal about them, and their bold escape from slavery, and their----\"  \"Slavery!\" sung out the old man. \"We were never slaves! What do you mean by that? Do you take us for niggers?\"  He was pretty mad, and I don't wonder, if that was the way he understood Rectus, for he was just as much a white man as either of us.  \"Oh no!\" said Rectus. \"But I've heard all about you, and that tyrant Turnbull, and the way you cast off his yoke. I mean your fathers, of course.\"  \"I reckon you've heard a little too much, young man,\" said the Minorcan. \"Somebody's been stuffin' you. You'd better get a hook and line, and go out to catch clams.\"  \"Why, you don't understand me!\" cried Rectus. \"I honor you for it.\"  The old man looked at him and then at me, and then he laughed. \"All right, bub,\" said he. \"If ever you want to hire a boat, I've got one. My name is Menendez. Just ask for my boat at the club-house wharf.\" And then he went on.  \"That's all you get for your sympathy with oppressed people,\" said Rectus. \"They call you bub.\"  \"Well, that old fellow isn't oppressed,\" I said; \"and if any of his ancestors were, I don't suppose he cares about remembering it. We ought to hire his boat some time.\"  That evening we took a walk along the sea-wall. It was a beautiful starlight night, and a great many people were walking about. When we got down near the fort,--which looked bigger and grayer than ever by the starlight,--Rectus said he would like to get inside of it by night, and I agreed that it would be a good thing to do. So we went over the drawbridge (this place has a drawbridge, and portcullises, and barbicans, and demi-lunes, and a moat, just as if it were a castle or a fort of some old country in Europe),--but the big gate was shut. We didn't care to knock, for all was dark, and we came away. Rectus proposed that we should reconnoitre the place, and I agreed, although, in reality, there wasn't anything to reconnoitre. We went down into the moat, which was perfectly dry, and very wide, and walked all around the fort.  We examined the walls, which were pretty jagged and rough in some places, and we both agreed that if we _had_ to do it, we believed we could climb to the top.  As we walked home, Rectus proposed that we should try to climb in some night.  \"What's the good?\" I asked.  \"Why, it would be a splendid thing,\" said he, \"to scale the walls of an old Middle-Age fort, like that. Let's try it, anyway.\"  I couldn't help thinking that it would be rather a fine thing to do, but it did seem rather foolish to risk our necks to get over the walls at night, when we could walk in, whenever we pleased, all day.  But it was of no use to say anything like that to Rectus. He was full of the idea of scaling the walls, and I found that, when the boy did get worked up to anything, he could talk first-rate, and before we went to sleep I got the notion of it, too, and we made up our minds that we would try it.  The next day we walked around the walls two or three times, and found a place where we thought we could get up, if we had a rope fastened to the top of the wall. When General Oglethorpe bombarded the fort,--at the time the Spaniards held it,--he made a good many dents in the wall, and these would help us. I did climb up a few feet, but we saw that it would never do to try to get all the way up without a rope.  How to fasten the rope on the top of the wall was the next question. We went in the fort, and found that if we"]]]
