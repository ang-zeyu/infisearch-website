He was suspicious of their going and thought it was a trap set to catch him in an attempted escape.  On the second day when the three went off together and left him alone, Casey went out gathering wood and discovered just where the \"powder,\" fuse and caps were kept under a huge, black boulder between the tunnel portal and the dugout.  On the third day he also gathered wood and helped himself to two sticks of dynamite, three caps and eighteen inches of fuse.  Not enough to be missed unless they checked their supply more carefully than Casey believed they did; but enough for Casey's purpose nevertheless.  That night, while the moon shone in through the dingy window at the head of his bunk and gave him a little light to work by, Casey sat up in bed and snored softly and with a soothing rhythm while he cut a stick of dynamite in two, capped five inches of fuse for each piece working awkwardly with his one good hand and pinching the caps tight with his teeth, which might have sent him with a bang into Kingdom Come--and very carefully worked the caps into the powder until no more than three inches of fuse protruded from the end of the half stick.  It would have been less dangerous to land with a yell in the middle of the floor and fight the three men with one bare hand, but Casey's courage never turned a hair.  Still snoring mildly, he held up to the moonlight two deadly weapons and surveyed them with much satisfaction.  They would not be so quick, as fiction would have them, but if his aim was accurate in throwing, they would be deadly enough.  Moreover, he could count with a good deal of certainty upon a certain degree of terror which the sight of them in his hand would produce.  When Casey Ryan cooked breakfast next morning, he carried two half-sticks of loaded dynamite under his hand in the sling. Can you wonder that even he shied at standing over the stove cooking hot cakes and complained that his broken hand pained him a lot and that the heat made it worse?  But a shrewd observer would have noticed on his face the expression of a cat that has been shut in the pantry over night.  Joe volunteered to take another look at the hand and see if blood poison was \"setting in\"; but Casey said it didn't feel like blood poison.  He had knocked it against the bunk edge in his sleep, he declared.  He'd dose 'er with iodine after a while, and she'd be all right.  Joe let it go at that, being preoccupied with other matters at which Casey could only guess.  He conferred with Paw outside the dugout after breakfast, called Hank away from the dish-washing and the three set off toward the tunnel with a brisker air than usually accompanied them to work.  Casey watched them go and felt reasonably sure of at least two hours to himself.  The first thing Casey did after he had made sure that he was actually alone was to remove the deadly stuff from the sling and lay it on a shadowed shelf where it would be safe but convenient to his hand. Then, going to his bunk, he reached under the blankets and found the other stick of dynamite which he had not yet loaded.  This he laid on the kitchen table and cut it in two as he had done last night with the other stick.  With his remaining cap he loaded a half and carried it back to his bunk. He was debating in his mind whether it was worth while purloining another cap from a box under the boulder when another fancy took him and set him grinning.  Four separate charges of dynamite, he reasoned, would not be necessary. It was an even chance that the sight of a piece with the fuse in his hand would be sufficient to tame Paw or Hank or Joe--or the three together, for that matter--without going further than to give them a sight of it.  With that idea uppermost, Casey split the paper carefully down the side of the remaining half-stick, took out the contents in a tin plate and carried it outside where he buried it in the sand beneath a bush. Returning to the dugout he made a thick dough of leftover pancake batter and molded it into the dynamite wrapping with a fragment of harmless fuse protruding from the opened end. When the thing was dry, Casey thought it would look very deadly and might be useful.  After several days of helplessness for want of a weapon, Casey was in a mood to supply himself generously.  He finished the dish-washing, working awkwardly with one hand. After that he put a kettle of beans on to boil, filled the stove with pinon sticks and closed the drafts.  He armed himself with the two loaded pieces of dynamite from the cupboard, filled his pockets with such other things as he thought he might need, and went prospecting on his own account.  At the portal of the tunnel he stopped and listened for the ping-g, ping-g of a single-jack striking steadily upon steel. But the tunnel was silent, the ore car uptilted at the end of its track on the dump. Yet the three men were supposedly at work in the mine, had talked at breakfast about wanting to show a certain footage when the boss returned, and of needing to hurry.  Casey went into the tunnel, listening and going silently; sounds travel far in underground workings.  At the mouth of the first right-hand drift he stopped again and listened.  This, if he would believe Joe, was the drift where the bad ground had caused the accident to Joe and his partner whose leg had been broken. Casey found the drift as silent as the main tunnel.  He went in ten feet or so and lighted the candle he had pulled from inside his shirt. With the candle held in the swollen fingers of his injured hand, and a prospector's pick taken from the portal in his other, Casey went on cautiously, keeping an eye upon the roof which, to his wise, squinting eyes, looked perfectly solid and safe.  If a track had ever been laid in this drift it had long since been removed.  But a well-defined path led along its center with boot tracks going and coming, blurring one another with much passing. Casey grinned and went on, his ears cocked for any sound before or behind, his shoes slung over his arm by their tied laces.  So he came, in the course of a hundred feet or so, to a crude door of split cedar slabs, the fastening padlocked on his side. Casey had vaguely expected some such bar to his path, and he merely gave a grunt of satisfaction that the lock was old and on his side of the door.  With his jackknife Casey speedily took off one side of the lock and opened it.  Making the door appear locked behind him when he had passed through was a different matter, and Casey did not attempt it.  Instead, he merely closed the door behind him, carrying the padlock in with him.  As Casey reviewed his situation, being on the butte at all was a risk in itself.  One detail more or less could not matter so much. Besides, he was a bold Casey Ryan with two loaded half-sticks of dynamite in his sling.  A crude ladder against the wall of a roomy stope beyond the door did not in the least surprise him.  He had expected something of this sort. When he had topped the ladder and found himself in a chamber that stretched away into blackness, he grunted again his mental confirmation of a theory working out beautifully in fact. His candle held close to the wall, he moved forward along the well-trodden path, looking for a door.  Mechanically he noticed also the formation of the wall and the vein of ore--probably high-grade in pockets, at least--that had caused this chamber to be dug.  The ore, he judged, had long since been taken out and down through the stope into the tunnel and so out through the main portal. These workings were old and for mining purposes abandoned. But just now Casey was absorbed in solving the one angle of the mystery which he had stumbled upon at first, and he gave no more than a glance and a thought to the silent testimony of the rock walls.  He found the door, fastened also on the outside just as he had expected it would be.  Beside it stood a rather clever heating apparatus which Casey did not examine in detail.  His Irish heart was beating rather fast while he unfastened the door.  Beyond that door his thoughts went questing eagerly but he hesitated nevertheless before he lifted his knuckles and rapped.  There was no reply.  Casey waited a minute, knocked again, then pulled the door open a crack and looked in.  The old woman sat there rocking back and forth, steadily, quietly.  But her thin fingers were rolling a corner of her apron hem painstakingly, as if she meant to hem it again. Her eyes were fixed absently upon the futile task.  Casey watched her as long as he dared and cleared his throat twice in the hope that she would notice him. But the old woman rocked back and forth and rolled her apron hem; unrolled it and carefully rolled it again.  \"Good morning, ma'am,\" said Casey, clearing his throat for the third time and coming a step into the room with his candle dripping wax on the floor.  For just an instant the uneasy fingers paused in their rolling of the apron hem.  For just so long the rockers hesitated in their motion. But the old woman did not reply nor turn her face toward him; and Casey pushed the door shut behind him and took two more steps toward her.  \"I come to see if yuh needed anything, ma'am; a friend, mebbe.\" Casey grinned amiably, wanting to reassure her if it were possible to make her aware of his presence.  \"They had yuh locked in, ma'am. That don't look good to Casey Ryan.  If yuh wanta get out--if they got yuh held a prisoner here, or anything like 'that, you can trust Casey Ryan any old time. Is--can I do anything for yuh, ma'am?\" The old woman dropped her hands to her lap and held them there, closely clasped.  Her head swung slowly round until she was looking at Casey with that awful, fixed stare she had heretofore directed at the wall or the floor.  \"Tell those hell-hounds they have a thousand years to burn--every one of them!\" she said in a deep, low voice that had in it a singing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20630"],["title","The Borough Treasurer (#0)"],["body","BOROUGH TREASURER  BY  J.

What those buildings had been used for in other days was not obvious to the casual and careless observer, but to the least observant their present use was obvious enough. Here were piles of timber from Norway; there were stacks of slate from Wales; here was marble from Aberdeen, and there cement from Portland: the old chambers of the grey buildings were filled to overflowing with all the things that go towards making a house--ironwork, zinc, lead, tiles, great coils of piping, stores of domestic appliances. And on a shining brass plate, set into the wall, just within the gateway, were deeply engraven the words: _Mallalieu and Cotherstone, Builders and Contractors_.  Whoever had walked into Mallalieu & Cotherstone's yard one October afternoon a few years ago would have seen Mallalieu and Cotherstone in person. The two partners had come out of their office and gone down the yard to inspect half a dozen new carts, just finished, and now drawn up in all the glory of fresh paint. Mallalieu had designed those carts himself, and he was now pointing out their advantages to Cotherstone, who was more concerned with the book-keeping and letter-writing side of the business than with its actual work. He was a big, fleshy man, Mallalieu, midway between fifty and sixty, of a large, solemn, well-satisfied countenance, small, sly eyes, and an expression of steady watchfulness; his attire was always of the eminently respectable sort, his linen fresh and glossy; the thick gold chain across his ample front, and the silk hat which he invariably wore, gave him an unmistakable air of prosperity. He stood now, the silk hat cocked a little to one side, one hand under the tail of his broadcloth coat, a pudgy finger of the other pointing to some new feature of the mechanism of the new carts, and he looked the personification of self-satisfaction and smug content.  \"All done in one action, d'ye see, Cotherstone?\" he was saying. \"One pull at that pin releases the entire load. We'd really ought to have a patent for that idea.\"  Cotherstone went nearer the cart which they were examining. He was a good deal of a contrast to his partner--a slightly built, wiry man, nervous and quick of movement; although he was Mallalieu's junior he looked older, and the thin hair at his temples was already whitening. Mallalieu suggested solidity and almost bovine sleekness; in Cotherstone, activity of speech and gesture was marked well-nigh to an appearance of habitual anxiety. He stepped about the cart with the quick action of an inquisitive bird or animal examining something which it has never seen before.  \"Yes, yes, yes!\" he answered. \"Yes, that's a good idea. But if it's to be patented, you know, we ought to see to it at once, before these carts go into use.\"  \"Why, there's nobody in Highmarket like to rob us,\" observed Mallalieu, good-humouredly. \"You might consider about getting--what do they call it?--provisional protection?--for it.\"  \"I'll look it up,\" responded Cotherstone. \"It's worth that, anyhow.\"  \"Do,\" said Mallalieu. He pulled out the big gold watch which hung from the end of his cable chain and glanced at its jewelled dial. \"Dear me!\" he exclaimed. \"Four o'clock--I've a meeting in the Mayor's parlour at ten past. But I'll look in again before going home.\"  He hurried away towards the entrance gate, and Cotherstone, after ruminative inspection of the new carts, glanced at some papers in his hand and went over to a consignment of goods which required checking. He was carefully ticking them off on a list when a clerk came down the yard.  \"Mr. Kitely called to pay his rent, sir,\" he announced. \"He asked to see you yourself.\"  \"Twenty-five--six--seven,\" counted Cotherstone. \"Take him into the private office, Stoner,\" he answered. \"I'll be there in a minute.\"  He continued his checking until it was finished, entered the figures on his list, and went briskly back to the counting-house near the gateway. There he bustled into a room kept sacred to himself and Mallalieu, with a cheery greeting to his visitor--an elderly man who had recently rented from him a small house on the outskirts of the town.  \"Afternoon, Mr. Kitely,\" he said. \"Glad to see you, sir--always glad to see anybody with a bit of money, eh? Take a chair, sir--I hope you're satisfied with the little place, Mr. Kitely?\"  The visitor took the offered elbow-chair, folded his hands on the top of his old-fashioned walking-cane, and glanced at his landlord with a half-humorous, half-quizzical expression. He was an elderly, clean-shaven, grey-haired man, spare of figure, dressed in rusty black; a wisp of white neckcloth at his throat gave him something of a clerical appearance: Cotherstone, who knew next to nothing about him, except that he was able to pay his rent and taxes, had already set him down as a retired verger of some cathedral.  \"I should think you and Mr. Mallalieu are in no need of a bit of money, Mr. Cotherstone,\" he said quietly. \"Business seems to be good with you, sir.\"  \"Oh, so-so,\" replied Cotherstone, off-handedly. \"Naught to complain of, of course. I'll give you a receipt, Mr. Kitely,\" he went on, seating himself at his desk and taking up a book of forms. \"Let's see--twenty-five pounds a year is six pound five a quarter--there you are, sir. Will you have a drop of whisky?\"  Kitely laid a handful of gold and silver on the desk, took the receipt, and nodded his head, still watching Cotherstone with the same half-humorous expression.  \"Thank you,\" he said. \"I shouldn't mind.\"  He watched Cotherstone produce a decanter and glasses, watched him fetch fresh water from a filter in the corner of the room, watched him mix the drinks, and took his own with no more than a polite nod of thanks. And Cotherstone, murmuring an expression of good wishes, took a drink himself, and sat down with his desk-chair turned towards his visitor.  \"Aught you'd like doing at the house, Mr. Kitely?\" he asked.  \"No,\" answered Kitely, \"no, I can't say that there is.\"  There was something odd, almost taciturn, in his manner, and Cotherstone glanced at him a little wonderingly.  \"And how do you like Highmarket, now you've had a spell of it?\" he inquired. \"Got settled down, I suppose, now?\"  \"It's all that I expected,\" replied Kitely. \"Quiet--peaceful. How do you like it?\"  \"Me!\" exclaimed Cotherstone, surprised. \"Me?--why, I've had--yes, five-and-twenty years of it!\"  Kitely took another sip from his glass and set it down. He gave Cotherstone a sharp look.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"yes--five-and-twenty years. You and your partner, both. Yes--it'll be just about thirty years since I first saw you. But--you've forgotten.\"  Cotherstone, who had been lounging forward, warming his hands at the fire, suddenly sat straight up in his chair. His face, always sharp seemed to grow sharper as he turned to his visitor with a questioning look.  \"Since--what?\" he demanded.  \"Since I first saw you--and Mr. Mallalieu,\" replied Kitely. \"As I say, you've forgotten. But--I haven't.\"  Cotherstone sat staring at his tenant for a full minute of speechlessness. Then he slowly rose, walked over to the door, looked at it to see that it was closed, and returning to the hearth, fixed his eyes on Kitely.  \"What do you mean?\" he asked.  \"Just what I say,\" answered Kitely, with a dry laugh. \"It's thirty years since I first saw you and Mallalieu. That's all.\"  \"Where?\" demanded Cotherstone.  Kitely motioned his landlord to sit down. And Cotherstone sat down--trembling. His arm shook when Kitely laid a hand on it.  \"Do you want to know where?\" he asked, bending close to Cotherstone. \"I'll tell you. In the dock--at Wilchester Assizes. Eh?\"  Cotherstone made no answer. He had put the tips of his fingers together, and now he was tapping the nails of one hand against the nails of the other. And he stared and stared at the face so close to"]]]
