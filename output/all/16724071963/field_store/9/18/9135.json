[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20631"],["title","Chosen Peoples (#2)"],["body","ns,\" \"a suffering servant,\" \"a kingdom of priests\"--the old Testament metaphors for Israel's mission are as numerous as they are noble. And the lyrics in which they occur are unparalleled in literature for their fusion of ethical passion with poetical beauty. Take, for example, the forty-second chapter of Isaiah. (I quote as in gratitude bound the accurate Jewish version of the Bible we owe to America.)      Behold My servant whom I uphold;     Mine elect in whom My soul delighteth;     I have put My spirit upon him,     He shall make the right to go forth to the nations:     He shall not fail or be crushed     Till he have set the right on the earth,     And the isles shall wait for his teaching.     Thus saith God the LORD,     He that created the heavens, and stretched them forth,     He that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it,     He that giveth bread unto the people upon it,     And spirit to them that walk therein:     I the LORD have called thee in righteousness,     And have taken hold of thy hand,     And kept thee, and set thee for a covenant of the people,     For a light of the nations;     To open the blind eyes,     To bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,     And them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.  Never was ideal less tribal: it is still the dynamic impulse of all civilization. \"Let justice well up as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream.\" \"Nation shall not lift sword against nation, neither shall there be war any more.\"  Nor does this mission march always with the pageantry of external triumph. \"Despised and forsaken of men,\" Isaiah paints Israel. \"Yet he bore the sin of many. And made intercession for the transgressors ... with his stripes we were healed.\"  Happily all that is best in Christendom recognizes, with Kuenen or Matthew Arnold, the grandeur of the Old Testament ideal. But that this ideal penetrated equally to our everyday liturgy is less understood of the world. \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, who hast chosen Israel from all peoples and given him the Law.\" Here is no choice of a favourite but of a servant, and when it is added that \"from Zion shall the Law go forth\" it is obvious what that servant's task is to be. \"What everlasting love hast Thou loved the house of Israel,\" says the Evening Prayer. But in what does this love consist? Is it that we have been pampered, cosseted? The contrary. \"A Law, and commandments, statutes and judgments hast Thou taught us.\" Before these were thundered from Sinai, the historian of the Exodus records, Israel was explicitly informed that only by obedience to them could he enjoy peculiar favour. \"Now therefore, if ye will hearken unto My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine; and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.\" A chosen people is really a choosing people. Not idly does Talmudical legend assert that the Law was offered first to all other nations and only Israel accepted the yoke.  How far the discipline of the Law actually produced the Chosen People postulated in its conferment is a subtle question for pragmatists. Mr. Lucien Wolf once urged that \"the yoke of the Torah\" had fashioned a racial aristocracy possessing marked biological advantages over average humanity, as well as sociological superiorities of temperance and family life. And indeed the statistics of Jewish vitality and brain-power, and even of artistic faculty, are amazing enough to invite investigation from all eugenists, biologists, and statesmen. But whether this general superiority--a superiority not inconsistent with grave failings and drawbacks--is due to the rigorous selection of a tragic history, or whether it is, as Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu maintains, the heritage of a civilization older by thousands of years than that of Europe; whether the Torah made the greatness of the people, or the people--precisely because of its greatness--made the Torah; whether we have a case of natural election or artificial election to study, it is not in any self-sufficient superiority or aim thereat that the essence of Judaism lies, but in an apostolic altruism. The old Hebrew writers indeed--when one considers the impress the Bible was destined to make on the faith, art, and imagination of the world--might well be credited with the intuition of genius in attributing to their people a quality of election. And the Jews of to-day in attributing to themselves that quality would have the ground not only of intuition but of history. Nevertheless that election is, even by Jewish orthodoxy, conceived as designed solely for world-service, for that spiritual mission for which Israel when fashioned was exiled and scattered like wind-borne seeds, and of the consummation of which his ultimate repatriation and glory will be but the symbol. It is with _Alenu_ that every service ends--the prayer for the coming of the Kingdom of God, \"when Thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the Kingdom of the Almighty and all the children of flesh will call upon Thy name, when Thou wilt turn unto Thyself all the wicked of the earth.... In that day the Lord shall be One and His name One.\" Israel disappears altogether in this diurnal aspiration.     IV   Israel disappears, too, in whole books of the Old Testament. What has the problem of Job, the wisdom of Proverbs, or the pessimism of Ecclesiastes to do with the Jew specifically? The Psalter would scarcely have had so universal an appeal had it been essentially rooted in a race.  In the magnificent cosmic poem of Psalm civ--half Whitman, half St. Francis--not only his fellow-man but all creation comes under the benediction of the Hebrew poet's mood. \"The high hills are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the conies.... The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God ... man goeth forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening.\" Even in a more primitive Hebrew poet the same cosmic universalism reveals itself. To the bard of Genesis the rainbow betokens not merely a covenant between God and man but a \"covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.\"  That the myth of the tribalism of the Jewish God should persist in face of such passages can only be explained by the fact that He shares in the unpopularity of His people. Mr. Wells, for example, in his finely felt but intellectually incoherent book, \"God the Invisible King,\" dismisses Him as a malignant and partisan Deity, jealous and pettily stringent. At most one is entitled to say with Mr. Israel Abrahams in his profound little book on \"Judaism\" that \"God, in the early literature a tribal, non-moral Deity, was in the later literature a righteous ruler, who, with Amos and Hosea, loved and demanded righteousness in man,\" and that there was an expansion from a national to a universal Ruler. But if \"by early literature\" anybody understand simply Genesis, if he imagines that the evolutionary movement in Judaism proceeds regularly from Abraham to Isaiah, he is grossly in error. No doubt all early gods are tribal, all early religions connected with the hearth and ancestor worship, but the God of Isaiah is already in Genesis, and the tribal God has to be exhumed from practically all parts of the Bible. But even in the crudities of Genesis or Judges that have escaped editorship I cannot find Mr. Wells's \"malignant\" Deity--_He_ is really \"the invisible King.\" The very first time Jehovah appears in His tribal aspect (Genesis xii.) His promise to bless Abraham ends with the assurance--and it almost invariably accompanies all the repetitions of the promise--\"And in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\" Nay, as I pointed out in my essay on \"The Gods of Germany,\" the very first words of the Bible, \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,\" strike a magnificent note of universalism, which is sustained in the derivation of all humanity from Adam, and again from Noah, with one original language. Nor is this a modern gloss, for the Talmud already deduces the interpretation. Racine's \"Esther\" in the noble lines lauded by Voltaire might be almost rebuking Mr. Wells:--      Ce Dieu, maître absolu de la terre et des cieux,     N'est point tel que l'erreur le figure à vos yeux:     L'Eternel est son nom, le monde est son ouvrage;     Il entend les soupirs de l'humble qu'on outrage,     Juge tous les mortels avec d'égales lois,     Et du haut de son trône interroge les rois.  --there is the true Hebrew note, the note denounced of Nietzsche.  Is this notorious \"tribal God\" the God of the Mesopotamian sheikh whose seed was so invidiously chosen? Well, but of this God Abraham asks--in what I must continue to call the epochal sentence in the Bible--\"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\" Abraham, in fact, bids God down as in some divine Dutch auction--Sodom is not to be destroyed if it holds fifty, forty-five, forty, thirty, twenty, nay ten righteous men. Compare this ethical development of the ancestor of Judaism with that of Pope Gregory XIII, in the sixteenth century, some thirty-one centuries later: _Civitas ista potest esse destrui quando in ea plures sunt hæretici_ (\"A city may be destroyed when it harbours a number of heretics\"). And this claim of man to criticize God Jehovah freely concedes. Thus the God of Abraham is no God of a tribe, but, like the God of the Rabbi who protested against the Bath-Kol, the God of Reason and Love. As clearly as for the nineteenth-century Martineau, \"the seat of authority in Religion\" has passed to the human conscience. God Himself appeals to it in that inversion of the Sodom story, the story of Jonah, whose teaching is far greater and more wonderful than its fish. And this Abrahamic tradition of free thought is continued by Moses, who boldly comes between"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20631"],["title","Chosen Peoples (#3)"],["body","and the people He designs to destroy. \"Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil did He bring them forth to slay them in the mountains...? Turn from Thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against Thy people.\" Moses goes on to remind Him of the covenant, \"And the Lord repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people.\" In the same chapter, the people having made a golden calf, Moses offers his life for their sin; the Old Testament here, as in so many places, anticipating the so-called New, but rejecting the notion of vicarious atonement so drastically that the attempt of dogmatic Christianity to base itself on the Old Testament can only be described as text-blind. And the great answer of Jehovah to Moses's questioning--\"I AM THAT I AM\"--yields already the profound metaphysical Deity of Maimonides, that \"invisible King\" whom the anonymous New Year liturgist celebrates as:        Highest divinity,     Dynast of endlessness,     Timeless resplendency,     Worshipped eternally,       Lord of Infinity!  And the fact that Moses himself was married to an Egyptian woman and that \"a mixed multitude\" went up with the Jews out of Egypt shows that the narrow tribalism of Ezra and Nehemiah, with the regrettable rejection of the Samaritans, was but a temporary political necessity; while the subsequent admission into the canon of the book of \"Ruth,\" with its moral of the descent of the Messiah himself from a Moabite woman, is an index that universalism was still unconquered. We have, in fact, the recurring clash of centripetal and centrifugal forces, and what assured the persistence and assures the ultimate triumph of the latter is that the race being one with the religion could not resist that religion's universal implications. If there were only a single God, and He a God of justice and the world, how could He be confined to Israel? The Mission could not but come. The true God, urges Mr. Wells, has no scorn or hatred for those who seek Him through idols. That is exactly what Ibn Gabirol said in 1050. But those blind seekers needed guiding. Religion, in fact, not race, has always been the governing principle in Jewish history. \"I do not know the origin of the term Jew,\" says Dion Cassius, born in the second century. \"The name is used, however, to designate all who observe the customs of this people, even though they be of different race.\" Where indeed lay the privilege of the Chosen People when the Talmud defined a non-idolater as a Jew, and ranked a Gentile learned in the Torah as greater than the High Priest? Such learned proselytes arose in Aquila and Theodotion each of whom made a Greek version of the Bible; while the orthodox Jew hardly regards his Hebrew text as complete unless accompanied by the Aramaic version popularly ascribed to the proselyte Onkelos. The disagreeable references to proselytes in Rabbinic literature, the difficulties thrown in their way, and the grotesque conception of their status towards their former families, cannot counterbalance the fact, established by Radin in his learned work, \"The Jews Among the Greeks and Romans,\" that there was a carefully planned effort of propaganda. Does not indeed Jesus tell the Pharisees: \"Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte\"? Do not Juvenal and Horace complain of this Judaising? Were not the Idumeans proselytised almost by force? \"The Sabbath and the Jewish fasts,\" says Lecky, doubtless following Josephus, \"became familiar facts in all the great cities.\" And Josephus himself in that answer to Apion, which Judaism has strangely failed to rank as one of its greatest documents, declares in noble language: \"There ought to be but one Temple for one God ... and this Temple common to all men, because He is the common God of all men.\"  It would be a very tough tribal God that could survive worshippers of this temper. An ancient Midrash taught that in the Temple there were seventy sacrifices offered for the seventy nations. For the mediæval and rationalist Maimonides the election of Israel scarcely exists--even the Messiah is only to be a righteous Conqueror, whose success will be the test of his genuineness. And Spinoza--though he, of course, is outside the development of the Synagogue proper--refused to see in the Jew any superiority save of the sociological system for ensuring his eternity. The comparatively modern Chassidism, anticipating Mazzini, teaches that every nation and language has a special channel through which it receives God's gifts. Of contemporary Reform Judaism, the motto \"Have we not one father, hath not one God created us?\" was formally adopted as the motto of the Congress of Religions at Washington. \"The forces of democracy _are_ Israel,\" cries the American Jew, David Lubin, in an ultra-modern adaptation of the Talmudic scale of values. There is, in fact, through our post-biblical literature almost a note of apology for the assumption of the Divine mission: perhaps it is as much the offspring of worldly prudence as of spiritual progress. The Talmud observed that the Law was only given to Israel because he was so peculiarly fierce he needed curbing. Abraham Ibn Daud at the beginning of the twelfth century urged that God had to reveal Himself to some nation to show that He did not hold Himself aloof from the universe, leaving its rule to the stars: it is the very argument as to the need for Christ employed by Mr. Balfour in his \"Foundations of Belief.\" Crescas, in the fourteenth century, declared--like an earlier Buckle--that the excellence of the Jew sprang merely from the excellence of Palestine. Mr. Abelson, in his recent valuable book on Jewish mysticism, alleges that when Rabbi Akiba called the Jews \"Sons of God\" he meant only that all other nations were idolaters. But in reality Akiba meant what he said--what indeed had been said throughout the Bible from Deuteronomy downwards. In the words of Hosea:      When Israel was a child, then I loved him,     And out of Egypt I called My son.  No evidence of the universalism of Israel's mission can away with the fact that it was still _his_ mission, the mission of a Chosen People. And this conviction, permeating and penetrating his whole literature and broidering itself with an Oriental exuberance of legendary fantasy, poetic or puerile, takes on in places an intimacy, sometimes touching in its tender mysticism, sometimes almost grotesque in its crude reminder to God that after all His own glory and reputation are bound up with His people's, and that He must not go too far in His chastisements lest the heathen mock. Reversed, this apprehension produced the concept of the _Chillul Hashem_, \"the profanation of the Name.\" Israel, in his turn, was in honour bound not to lower the reputation of the Deity, who had chosen him out. On the contrary, he was to promote the _Kiddush Hashem_ \"the sanctification of the Name.\" Thus the doctrine of election made not for arrogance but for a sense of _Noblesse oblige_. As the \"Hymn of Glory\" recited at New Year says in a more poetic sense: \"His glory is on me and mine on Him.\" \"He loves His people,\" says the hymn, \"and inhabits their praises.\" Indeed, according to Schechter, the ancient Rabbis actually conceived God as existing only through Israel's continuous testimony and ceasing were Israel--_per impossibile_--to disappear. It is a mysticism not without affinity to Mr. Wells's. A Chassidic Rabbi, quoted by Mr. Wassilevsky, teaches in the same spirit that God and Israel, like Father and Son, are each incomplete without the other. In another passage of Hosea--a passage recited at the everyday winding of phylacteries--the imagery is of wedded lovers. \"I will betroth thee unto Me for ever, Yea I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving-kindness and in mercy.\"  But it is in the glowing, poetic soul of Jehuda Ha-Levi that this election of Israel, like the passion for Palestine, finds its supreme and uncompromising expression. \"Israel,\" declares the author of the \"Cuzari\" in a famous dictum, \"is among the nations like the heart among the limbs.\" Do not imagine he referred to the heart as a pump, feeding the veins of the nations--Harvey was still five centuries in the future--he meant the heart as the centre of feeling and the symbol of the spirit. And examining the question why Israel had been thus chosen, he declares plumply that it is as little worthy of consideration as why the animals had not been created men. This is, of course, the only answer. The wind of creation and inspiration bloweth where it listeth. As Tennyson said in a similar connection:      And if it is so, so it is, you know,     And if it be so, so be it!     V   But although, as with all other manifestations of genius, Science cannot tell us why the Jewish race was so endowed spiritually, it can show us by parallel cases that there is nothing unique in considering yourself a Chosen People--as indeed the accusation with which we began reminds us. And it can show us that a nation's assignment of a mission to itself is not a sudden growth. \"Unlike any other nation,\" says the learned and saintly leader of Reform Judaism, Dr. Kohler, in his article on \"Chosen People\" in the _Jewish Encyclopædia_, \"the Jewish people began their career conscious of their life-purpose and world-duty as the priests and teachers of a universal religious truth.\" This is indeed a strange statement, and only on the theory that its author was expounding the biblical standpoint, and not his own, can it be reconciled with his general doctrine of progress and evolution in Hebrew thought. It would seem to accept the Sinaitic Covenant as a literal episode, and even to synchronise the Mission with it. But an investigation of the history of other Chosen Peoples will, I fear, dissipate any notion that the Sinaitic Covenant was other than a symbolic summary of the national genius for religion, a sublime legend retrospectively created. And the mission to other nations"]]]
