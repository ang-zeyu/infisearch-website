The Coming of the Devastator  This is the romantic history of Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, the most knightly and gentle of the Spanish discoverers, and one who would fain have been true to the humble Indian girl who had won his heart, even though his life and liberty were at stake.  It is almost the only love story in early Spanish-American history, and the account of it, veracious though it is, reads like a novel or a play.  After Diego de Nicuesa had sailed away from Antigua on that enforced voyage from which he never returned, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa was supreme on the Isthmus.  Encisco, however, remained to make trouble.  In order to secure internal peace before prosecuting some further expeditions, Balboa determined to send him back to Spain, as the easiest way of getting rid of his importunities and complaints.  A more truculent commander would have no difficulty in inventing a pretext for taking off his head.  A more prudent captain would have realized that Encisco with his trained mouth could do very much more harm to him in Spain than he could in Darien.  Balboa thought to nullify that possibility, however, by sending Valdivia, with a present, to Hispaniola, and Zamudio {32} with the Bachelor to Spain to lay the state of affairs before the King.  Encisco was a much better advocate than Balboa's friend Zamudio, and the King of Spain credited the one and disbelieved the other.  He determined to appoint a new governor for the Isthmus, and decided that Balboa should be proceeded against rigorously for nearly all the crimes in the decalogue, the most serious accusation being that to him was due the death of poor Nicuesa.  For by this time everybody was sure that the poor little meat-carver was no more.  An enterprise against the French which had been declared off filled Spain with needy cavaliers who had started out for an adventure and were greatly desirous of having one.  Encisco and Zamudio had both enflamed the minds of the Spanish people with fabulous stories of the riches of Darien.  It was curiously believed that gold was so plentiful that it could be fished up in nets from the rivers.  Such a piscatorial prospect was enough to unlock the coffers of a prince as selfish as Ferdinand.  He was willing to risk fifty thousand ducats in the adventure, which was to be conducted on a grand scale.  No such expedition to America had ever been prepared before as that destined for Darien.  Among the many claimants for its command, he picked out an old cavalier named Pedro Arias de Avila, called by the Spaniards Pedrarias.[1]  This Pedrarias was seventy-two years old.  He was of good birth and rich, and was the father of a large and interesting family, which he prudently left behind him in Spain.  His wife, however, insisted on going {33} with him to the New World.  Whether or not this was a proof of wifely devotion--and if it was, it is the only thing in history to his credit--or of an unwillingness to trust Pedrarias out of her sight, which is more likely, is not known.  At any rate, she went along.  Pedrarias, up to the time of his departure from Spain, had enjoyed two nick-names, El Galan and El Justador.  He had been a bold and dashing cavalier in his youth, a famous tilter in tournaments in his middle age, and a hard-fighting soldier all his life.  His patron was Bishop Fonseca.  Whatever qualities he might possess for the important work about to be devolved upon him would be developed later.  His expedition included from fifteen hundred to two thousand souls, and there were at least as many more who wanted to go and could not for lack of accommodations.  The number of ships varies in different accounts from nineteen to twenty-five.  The appointments both of the general expedition and the cavaliers themselves were magnificent in the extreme.  Many afterward distinguished in America went in Pedrarias's command, chief among them being De Soto.  Among others were Quevedo, the newly appointed Bishop of Darien, and Espinosa, the judge.  The first fleet set sail on the 11th of April, 1514, and arrived at Antigua without mishap on the 29th of June in the same year.  The colony at that place, which had been regularly laid out as a town with fortifications and with some degree at least of European comfort, numbered some three hundred hard-bitten soldiers.  The principle of the survival of the fittest had resulted in the selection of the best men from all the previous expeditions.  They would have been a {34} dangerous body to antagonize.  Pedrarias was in some doubt as to how Balboa would receive him.  He dissembled his intentions toward him, therefore, and sent an officer ashore to announce the meaning of the flotilla which whitened the waters of the bay.  The officer found Balboa, dressed in a suit of pajamas engaged in superintending the roofing of a house.  The officer, brilliant in silk and satin and polished armour, was astonished at the simplicity of Vasco Nuñez's appearance.  He courteously delivered his message, however, to the effect that yonder was the fleet of Don Pedro Arias de Avila, the new Governor of Darien.  [Illustration: \"Balboa . . . Engaged in Superintending the Roofing of a House\"]  Balboa calmly bade the messenger tell Pedrarias that he could come ashore in safety and that he was very welcome.  Balboa was something of a dissembler himself on occasion, as you will see.  Pedrarias thereupon debarked in great state with his men, and, as soon as he firmly got himself established on shore, arrested Balboa and presented him for trial before Espinosa for the death of Nicuesa.   II. The Greatest Exploit since Columbus's Voyage  During all this long interval, Balboa had not been idle.  A singular change had taken place in his character.  He had entered upon the adventure in his famous barrel on Encisco's ship as a reckless, improvident, roisterous, careless, hare-brained scapegrace. Responsibility and opportunity had sobered and elevated him.  While he had lost none of his dash and daring and brilliancy, yet he had become a wise, a prudent and a most successful captain.  Judged by the high standard of the modern times, Balboa was {35} cruel and ruthless enough to merit our severe condemnation.  Judged by his environments and contrasted with any other of the Spanish conquistadores he was an angel of light.   [Illustration: \"The Expedition Had to Fight Its Way Through Tribes of Warlike and Ferocious Mountaineers\"]  He seems to have remained always a generous, affectionate, open-hearted soldier.  He had conducted a number of expeditions after the departure of Nicuesa to different parts of the Isthmus, and he amassed much treasure thereby, but he always so managed affairs that he left the Indian chiefs in possession of their territory and firmly attached to him personally.  There was no indiscriminate murder, outrage or plunder in his train, and the Isthmus was fairly peaceable.  Balboa had tamed the tempers of the fierce soldiery under him to a remarkable degree, and they had actually descended to cultivating the soil between periods of gold-hunting and pearl-fishing.  The men under him were devotedly attached to him as a rule, although here and there a malcontent, unruly soldier, restless under the iron discipline, hated his captain.  Fortunately he had been warned by a letter from Zamudio, who had found means to send it via Hispaniola, of the threatening purpose of Pedrarias and the great expedition.  Balboa stood well with the authorities in Hispaniola.  Diego Columbus had given him a commission as Vice-Governor of Darien, so that as Darien was clearly within Diego Columbus's jurisdiction, Balboa was strictly under authority.  The news in Zamudio's letter was very disconcerting.  Like every Spaniard, Vasco Nuñez knew that he could expect little mercy and scant justice from a trial conducted under such auspices as Pedrarias's.  He determined, therefore, to secure himself in his position by some splendid achievement, which would so work upon the {36} feelings of the King that he would be unable, for very gratitude, to press hard upon him.  The exploit that he meditated and proposed to accomplish was the discovery of the ocean upon the other side of the Isthmus.  When Nicuesa came down from Nombre de Dios, he left there a little handful of men.  Balboa sent an expedition to rescue them and brought them down to Antigua.  Either on that expedition or on another shortly afterward, two white men painted as Indians discovered themselves to Balboa in the forest.  They proved to be Spaniards who had fled from Nicuesa to escape punishment for some fault they had committed and had sought safety in the territory of an Indian chief named Careta, the Cacique of Cueva.  They had been hospitably received and adopted into the tribe. In requital for their entertainment, they offered to betray the Indians if Vasco Nuñez, the new governor, would condone their past offenses. They filled the minds of the Spaniards, alike covetous and hungry, with stories of great treasures and what was equally valuable, abundant provisions, in Coreta's village.  Balboa immediately consented.  The act of treachery was consummated and the chief captured.  All that, of course, was very bad, but the difference between Balboa and the men of his time is seen in his after conduct.  Instead of putting the unfortunate chieftain to death and taking his people for slaves, Balboa released him.  The reason he released him was because of a woman--a woman who enters vitally into the subsequent history of Vasco Nuñez, and indeed of the whole of South America.  This was the beautiful daughter of the chief.  Anxious to propitiate his captor, Careta offered Balboa this flower of the family {37} to wife.  Balboa saw her, loved her and took her to himself."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20910"],["title","South American Fights and Fighters, and Other Tales of Adventure (#6)"],["body","  They were married in accordance with the Indian custom; which, of course, was not considered in the least degree binding by the Spaniards of that time.  But it is to Balboa's credit that he remained faithful to this Indian girl.  Indeed, if he had not been so much attached to her it is probable that he might have lived to do even greater things than he did.  In his excursions throughout the Isthmus, Balboa had met a chief called Comagre.  As everywhere, the first desire of the Spanish was gold.  The metal had no commercial value to the Indians.  They used it simply to make ornaments, and when it was not taken from them by force, they were cheerfully willing to exchange it for beads, trinkets, hawks' bells, and any other petty trifles.  Comagre was the father of a numerous family of stalwart sons.  The oldest, observing the Spaniards brawling and fighting--\"brabbling,\" Peter Martyr calls it--about the division of gold, with an astonishing degree of intrepidity knocked over the scales at last and dashed the stuff on the ground in contempt.  He made amends for his action by telling them of a country where gold, like Falstaff's reasons, was as plenty as blackberries.  Incidentally he gave them the news that Darien was an isthmus, and that the other side was swept by a vaster sea than that which washed its eastern shore.  These tidings inspired Balboa and his men.  They talked long and earnestly with the Indians and fully satisfied themselves of the existence of a great sea and of a far-off country abounding in treasure on the other side.  Could it be that mysterious Cipango of Marco Polo, search for which had been the object of Columbus's voyage?  The way there was discussed and the {38} difficulties of the journey estimated, and it was finally decided that at least one thousand Spaniards would be required safely to cross the Isthmus.  Balboa had sent an account of this conversation to Spain, asking for the one thousand men.  The account reached there long before Pedrarias sailed, and to it, in fact, was largely due the extensive expedition. Now when Balboa learned from Zamudio of what was intended toward him in Spain, he determined to undertake the discovery himself.  He set forth from Antigua the 1st of September, 1513, with a hundred and ninety chosen men, accompanied by a pack of bloodhounds, very useful in fighting savages, and a train of Indian slaves.  Francisco Pizarro was his second in command.  All this in lieu of the one thousand Spaniards for which he had asked, which was not thought to be too great a number.  The difficulties to be overcome were almost incredible.  The expedition had to fight its way through tribes of warlike and ferocious mountaineers.  If it was not to be dogged by a trail of pestilent hatreds, the antagonisms evoked by its advance must be composed in every Indian village or tribe before it progressed farther.  Aside from these things, the topographical difficulties were immense.  The Spaniards were armour-clad, as usual, and heavily burdened.  Their way led through thick and overgrown and pathless jungles or across lofty and broken mountain-ranges, which could be surmounted only after the most exhausting labor.  The distance as the crow flies, was short, less than fifty miles, but nearly a month elapsed before they approached the end of their journey.  Balboa's enthusiasm and courage had surmounted every obstacle.  He made friends with the chiefs {39} through whose territories he passed, if they were willing to be friends.  If they chose to be enemies, he fought them, he conquered them and then made friends with them then. Such a singular mixture of courage, adroitness and statesmanship was he that everywhere he prevailed by one method or another.  Finally, in the territory of a chief named Quarequa, he reached the foot of the mountain range from the summit of which his guides advised him that he could see the object of his expedition.  There were but sixty-seven men capable of ascending that mountain.  The toil and hardship of the journey had incapacitated the others.  Next to Balboa, among the sixty-seven, was Francisco Pizarro.  Early on the morning of the 25th of September, 1513, the little company began the ascent of the Sierra.  It was still morning when they surmounted it and reached the top.  Before them rose a little cone, or crest, which hid the view toward the south.  \"There,\" said the guides, \"from the top of yon rock, you can see the ocean.\"  Bidding his men halt where they were, Vasco Nuñez went forward alone and surmounted the little elevation.  A magnificent prospect was embraced in his view.  The tree-clad mountains sloped gently away from his feet, and on the far horizon glittered a line of silver which attested the accuracy of the claim of the Indians as to the existence of a great sea on the other side of what he knew now to be an isthmus.  Balboa named the body of water that he could see far away, flashing in the sunlight of that bright morning, \"the Sea of the South,\" or \"the South Sea.\" [2]  Drawing his sword, he took possession of it in the {40} name of Castile and Leon.  Then he summoned his soldiers.  Pizarro in the lead they were soon assembled at his side.  In silent awe they gazed, as if they were looking upon a vision.  Finally some one broke into the words of a chant, and on that peak in Darien those men sang the \"Te Deum Laudamus.\"  [Illustration: \"He Took Possession of the Sea in the Name of Castile and Leon\"]  Somehow the dramatic quality of that supreme moment in the life of Balboa has impressed itself upon the minds of the successive generations that have read of it since that day.  It stands as one of the great episodes of history.  That little band of ragged, weather-beaten, hard-bitten soldiers, under the leadership of the most lovable and gallant of the Spaniards of his time, on that lonely mountain peak rising above the almost limitless sea of trackless verdure, gazing upon the great ocean whose waters extended before them for thousands and thousands of miles, attracts the attention and fires the imagination.  Your truly great man may disguise his imaginative qualities from the unthinking public eye, but his greatness is in proportion to his imagination.  Balboa, with the centuries behind him, shading his eye and staring at the water:    ----Dipt into the future far as human eye could see,   Saw the visions of the world, and all the wonder that would be.   He saw Peru with its riches; he saw fabled Cathay; he saw the uttermost isles of the distant sea.  His imagination took the wings of the morning and soared over worlds and countries that no one but he had ever dreamed of, all to be the fiefs of the King of Castile.  It is interesting to note that it must have been to Balboa, of all men, that some adequate idea of the real size of the earth first came.  {41}  Well, they gazed their fill; then, with much toil, they cut down trees, dragged them to the top of the mountain and erected a huge cross which they stayed by piles of stones.  Then they went down the mountain-side and sought the beach.  It was no easy task to find it, either.  It was not until some days had passed that one of the several parties broke through the jungle and stood upon the shore.  When they were all assembled, the tide was at low ebb.  A long space of muddy beach lay between them and the water.  They sat down under the trees and waited until the tide was at flood, and then, on the 29th of September, with a banner displaying the Virgin and Child above the arms of Spain in one hand and with drawn sword in the other, Balboa marched solemnly into the rolling surf that broke about his waist and took formal possession of the ocean, and all the shores, wheresoever they might be, which were washed by its waters, for Ferdinand of Aragon, and his daughter Joanna of Castile, and their successors in Spain.  Truly a prodigious claim, but one which for a time Spain came perilously near establishing and maintaining.[3]   [Illustration: \"He Threw the Sacred Volume to the Ground in a Violent Rage\"]  Before they left the shore they found some canoes and voyaged over to a little island in the bay, which they called San Miguel, since it was that saint's day, and where they were nearly all swept away by the rising tide.  They went back to Antigua by another route, somewhat less difficult, fighting and making peace as before, and amassing treasure the while.  Great was the joy of the colonists who had been left behind, when Balboa and his men rejoined them.  {42} Those who had stayed behind shared equally with those who had gone.  The King's royal fifth was scrupulously set aside and Balboa at once dispatched a ship, under a trusted adherent named Arbolancha, to acquaint the King with his marvelous discovery, and to bring back reënforcements and permission to venture upon the great sea in quest of the fabled golden land toward the south.   III. \"Furor Domini\"  Unfortunately for Vasco Nuñez, Arbolancha arrived just two months after Pedrarias had sailed.  The discovery of the Pacific was the greatest single exploit since the voyage of Columbus.  It was impossible for the King to proceed further against Balboa under such circumstances. Arbolancha was graciously received, therefore, and after his story had been heard a ship was sent back to Darien instructing Pedrarias to let Balboa alone, appointing him an adelantado, or governor of the islands he had discovered in the South Sea, and all such countries as he might discover beyond.  All this, however took time, and Balboa was having a hard time with Pedrarias.  In spite of all the skill of the envenomed Encisco, who had been appointed the public prosecutor in Pedrarias's administration, Balboa was at last acquitted of having been concerned in the death of Nicuesa.  Pedrarias, furious at the verdict, made living a burden to poor Vasco Nuñez by civil suits which ate up all his property.  It had not fared well with the expedition of Pedrarias,"]]]
