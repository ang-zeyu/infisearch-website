There is a wide walk on top, with a low wall on the outside, just high enough to shelter cannon, and to enable the garrison to dodge musketry and arrows.  We had a good deal of trouble finding a rope, but we bought one, at last, which was stout enough,--the man asked us if we were going to fish for sharks, and didn't seem to believe us when we said no,--and we took it to our room, and made knots in it about a foot apart. The fort walls are about twenty feet high, and we made the rope plenty long enough, with something to spare. We didn't have much trouble to find a grapnel. We bought a small one, but it was strong enough. We talked the matter over a great deal, and went to the fort several times, making examinations, and measuring the height of the wall, from the top, with a spool of cotton.  It was two or three days before we got everything ready, and in our trips to the fort we saw a good deal of the Indians. We often met them in the town, too, for they were frequently allowed to go out and walk about by themselves. There was no danger, I suppose, of their trying to run away, for they were several thousand miles from their homes, and they probably would not care to run to any other place with no larger stock of the English language than one word, \"How?\" Some of them, however, could talk a little English. There was one big fellow--he was probably the largest of them all--who was called \"Maiden's Heart.\" I couldn't see how his name fitted, for he looked like an out-and-out savage, and generally wore a grin that seemed wicked enough to frighten settlers out of his part of the country. But he may have had a tender spot, somewhere, which entitled him to his name, and he was certainly very willing to talk to us, to the extent of his ability, which was not very great. We managed, however, to have some interesting, though rather choppy, conversations.  There was another fellow, a young chief, called Crowded Owl, that we liked better than any of the others, although we couldn't talk to him at all. He was not much older than I was, and so seemed to take to us. He would walk all around with us, and point out things. We had bought some sea-beans of him, and it may be that he hoped to sell us some more. At any rate, he was very friendly.  We met Mr. Cholott several times, and he told us of some good places to go to, and said he'd take us out fishing before long. But we were in no hurry for any expedition until we had carried out our little plan of surprising the fort. I gave the greater part of our money, however, to Mr. Cholott to lock up in his safe. I didn't like old Mr. Colbert's plan of going about with your capital pinned to your pockets. It might do while we were travelling, but I would rather have had it in drafts or something else not easily lost.  We had a good many discussions about our grapnel. We did not know whether there was a sentinel on duty in the fort at night or not, but supposed there was, and, if so, he would be likely to hear the grapnel when we threw it up and it hit the stones. We thought we could get over this difficulty by wrapping the grapnel in cotton wool. This would deaden the sound when it struck, but would not prevent the points of the hooks from holding to the inner edge of the wall. Everything now seemed all right, except that we had no object in view after we got over the wall. I always like to have some reason for doing a thing, especially when it's pretty hard to do. I said this to Rectus, and he agreed with me.  \"What I would like to do,\" said he, \"would be to benefit the innocent Indian prisoners.\"  \"I don't know what we can do for them,\" said I. \"We can't let them out, and they'd all go back again if we did.\"  \"No, we can't do that,\" said he; \"but we ought to do something. I've been around looking at them all carefully, and I feel sure that there are at least forty men among those Indians who haven't done a thing to warrant shutting them up.\"  \"Why, how do you know?\" I exclaimed.  \"I judge from their faces,\" said Rectus.  Of course this made me laugh, but he didn't care.  \"I'll tell you what we could do,\" said he; \"we could enter a protest that might be heard of, and do some good. We could take a pot of black paint and a brush with us, and paint on one of the doors that open into the inner square,--where everybody could see it,--something like this: 'Let the righteous Indian go free.' That would create talk, and something might be done.\"  \"Who'd do it?\" said I. \"The captain in command couldn't. He has no power to let any of them go free.\"  \"Well, we might address the notice to the President of the United States--in big black letters. They could not conceal such a thing.\"  \"Well, now, look here, Rectus,\" said I; \"this thing is going to cost too much money. That rope was expensive, and the grapnel cost a good deal more than we thought it would; and now you want a big pot of black paint. We mustn't spend our money too fast, and if we've got to economize, let's begin on black paint. You can write your proclamation on paper, and stick it on the door with tacks. They could send that easier to the President than they could send a whole door.\"  \"You may make as much fun as you please,\" said Rectus, \"but I'm going to write it out now.\"  And so he did, in big letters, on half a sheet of foolscap.     CHAPTER V.  STORMING SAN MARCO.   We started out on our storming expedition on a Tuesday night, about nine o'clock; we had a latch-key, so we could come home when we pleased. Rectus carried the rope, and I had the grapnel, wrapped in its cotton wool. We put newspapers around these things, and made pretty respectable packages of them. We did not go down the sea-wall, but walked around through some of the inner streets. It seemed to us like a curious expedition. We were not going to do anything wrong, but we had no idea what the United States government would think about it. We came down to the fort on its landward side, but our attack was to be made upon the waterfront, and so we went around that way, on the side farthest from the town. There were several people about yet, and we had to wait. We dropped our packages into the moat, and walked about on the water-battery, which is between the harbor and the moat, and is used as a sort of pleasure-ground by the people of the town. It was a pretty dark night, although the stars were out, and the last of the promenaders soon went home; and then, after giving them about ten minutes to get entirely out of sight and hearing, we jumped down into the moat, which is only five or six feet below the water-battery, and, taking our packages, went over to that part of the wall which we had fixed upon for our assault.  We fastened the rope to the grapnel, and then Rectus stood back while I made ready for the throw. It was a pretty big throw, almost straight up in the air, but I was strong, and was used to pitching, and all that sort of thing. I coiled the rope on the ground, took the loose end of it firmly in my left hand, and then, letting the grapnel hang from my right hand until it nearly touched the ground, I swung it round and round, perpendicularly, and when it had gone round three or four times, I gave it a tremendous hurl upward.  It rose beautifully, like a rocket, and fell inside of the ramparts, making only a little thud of a sound.  \"First-rate!\" said Rectus, softly; and I felt pretty proud myself.  I pulled on the rope, and found the grapnel had caught. I hung with my whole weight on it, but it held splendidly.  \"Now, then,\" said I to Rectus, \"you can climb up. Go slowly, and be very careful. There's no hurry. And mind you take a good hold when you get to the top.\"  We had arranged that Rectus was to go first. This did not look very brave on my part, but I felt that I wanted to be under him, while he was climbing, so that I could break his fall if he should slip down. It would not be exactly a perpendicular fall, for the wall slanted a little, but it would be bad enough. However, I had climbed up worse places than that, and Rectus was very nimble; so I felt there was no great danger.  Up he went, hand over hand, and putting his toes into nicks every now and then, thereby helping himself very much. He took it slowly and easily, and I felt sure he would be all right. As I looked at him, climbing up there in the darkness, while I was standing below, holding the rope so that it should not swing, I could not help thinking that I was a pretty curious kind of a tutor for a boy. However, I was taking all the care of him that I could, and if he came down he'd probably hurt me worse than he would hurt himself. Besides, I had no reason to suppose that old Mr. Colbert objected to a little fun. Then I began to think of Mrs. Colbert, and while I was thinking of her, and looking up at Rectus, I was amazed to see him going up quite rapidly, while the end of the rope slipped through my fingers. Up he went, and when I ran back, I could see a dark figure on the wall, above him. Somebody was pulling him up.  In a very few moments he disappeared over the top, rope and all!  Now, I was truly frightened. What might happen to the boy?  I was about to shout, but, on second thoughts, decided to keep quiet; yet I instantly made up my mind that, if I didn't see or hear from him pretty soon, I would run around to the gate and bang up the people inside. However, it was not necessary for me to trouble myself, for, in a minute, the rope came down again, and I took hold of it. I pulled on it and found it all firm, and then I went up. I climbed up pretty fast, and two or three times I felt a tug, as if somebody above was trying to pull me up. But it was of no use, for I was a great deal stouter and heavier than Rectus, who was a light, slim boy. But as I neared the top, a hand came down and clutched me by the collar, and some one, with a powerful arm and grip,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20651"],["title","A Jolly Fellowship (#8)"],["body","me over the top of the wall. There stood Rectus, all right, and the fellow who had helped us up was the big Indian, \"Maiden's Heart.\"  I looked at Rectus, and he whispered:  \"He says there's a sentinel down there in the square.\"  At this, Maiden's Heart bobbed his head two or three times, and, motioning to us to crouch down, he crept quietly over to the inner wall of the ramparts and looked down.  \"What shall we say we came for?\" I whispered, quickly.  \"I don't know,\" said Rectus.  \"Well, we must think of something,\" I said, \"or we shall look like fools.\"  But before he had time to think, Maiden's Heart crept back. He put his finger on his lips, and, beckoning us to follow him, he led the way to a corner of the fort near one of the lookout towers. We followed as quietly as we could, and then we all three slipped into the narrow entrance to the tower, the Indian motioning us to go first. When we two stood inside of the little round tower, old Maiden's Heart planted himself before us in the passage, and waited to hear what we had to say.  But we couldn't think of anything to say. Directly, however, I thought I must do something, so I whispered to the Indian:  \"Does the sentry ever come up here?\"  He seemed to catch my meaning.  \"I go watch,\" he said. \"Come back. Tell you.\" And off he stole, making no more noise than a cat.  \"Bother on him!\" said Rectus. \"If I'd known he was up here, I would never have come.\"  \"I reckon not,\" said I. \"But now that we have come, what are we going to do or say? That fellow evidently thinks we have some big project on hand, and he's ready to help us; we must be careful, or he'll rush down and murder the sentinel.\"  \"I'm sure I don't know what to say to him,\" said Rectus. \"We ought to have thought of this before. I suppose it would be of no use to mention my poster to him.\"  \"No, indeed,\" said I; \"he'd never understand that. And, besides, there's a man down there. Let's peep out and see what he's doing.\"  So we crept to the entrance of the passage, and saw Maiden's Heart, crouched near the top of the inclined plane which serves as a stairway from the square to the ramparts, and looking over the low wall, evidently watching the sentry.  \"I'll tell you what let's do,\" said Rectus. \"Let's make a rush for our rope, and get out of this.\"  \"No, sir!\" said I. \"We'd break our necks if we tried to hurry down that rope. Don't think of anything of that kind. And, besides, we couldn't both get down before he'd see us.\"  In a few minutes, Maiden's Heart crept quickly back to us, and seemed surprised that we had left our hiding-place. He motioned us farther back into the passage, and slipped in himself.  We did not have time to ask any questions before we heard the sentry coming up the stairway, which was near our corner. When he reached the top, he walked away from us over toward the Indian barracks, which were on the ramparts, at the other end of the fort. As soon as he reached the barracks, Maiden's Heart took me by the arm and Rectus by the collar, and hurried us to the stairway, and then down as fast as we could go. He made no noise himself, but Rectus and I clumped a good deal. We had to wear our shoes, for the place was paved with rough concrete and oyster-shells.  The sentry evidently heard the clumping, for he came running down after us, and caught up to us almost as soon as we reached the square.  \"Eugh!\" said he, for he was an Indian; and he ran in front of us, and held his musket horizontally before us. Of course we stopped. And then, as there was nothing else that seemed proper to do, we held out our hands and said \"How?\" The sentinel took his gun in his left hand, and shook hands with us. Then Maiden's Heart, who probably remembered that he had omitted this ceremony, also shook hands with us and said \"How?\"  The two Indians now began to jabber to each other, in a low voice; but we could not, of course, make out what they said, and I don't think they were able to imagine what we intended to do. We were standing near the inner door of the great entrance-way, and into this they now marched us. There was a lamp burning on a table.  Said Rectus: \"I guess they're going to put us out of the front door;\" but he was mistaken. They walked us into a dark room, on one side of the hall, and Maiden's Heart said to us: \"Stay here. Him mad. I come back. Keep still,\" and then he went out, probably to discuss with the sentinel the nature of our conspiracy. It was very dark in this room, and, at first, we couldn't see anything at all; but we soon found, from the smell of the bread, that we were in the kitchen or bakery. We had been here before, and had seen the head-cook, a ferocious Indian squaw, who had been taken in the act of butchering a poor emigrant woman on the plains. She always seemed sullen and savage, and never said a word to anybody. We hoped she wasn't in here now.  \"I didn't know they had Indian sentinels,\" said Rectus. \"That seems a little curious to me. I suppose they set the innocent ones to watch the guilty.\"  \"I don't believe that would work,\" said I, \"for the innocent chaps would want to get away, just as much as the others. I guess they make 'em take turns to stand guard. There has to be a sentinel in a fort, you know, and I suppose these fellows are learning the business.\"  We didn't settle this question, nor the more important one of our reason for this visit; for, at this moment, Maiden's Heart came back, carrying the lamp. He looked at us in a curious way, and then he said:  \"What you want?\"  I couldn't think of any good answer to this question, but Rectus whispered to me:  \"Got any money with you?\"  \"Yes,\" said I.  \"Let's buy some sea-beans,\" said Rectus.  \"All right,\" I answered.  \"Sea-beans?\" said Maiden's Heart, who had caught the word; \"you want sea-beans?\"  \"Yes,\" said Rectus, \"if you have any good ones.\"  At this, the Indian conducted us into the hall, put the lamp on the table, and took three or four sea-beans from his pocket. They were very nice ones, and beautifully polished.  \"Good,\" said I; \"we'll take these. How much, Maiden's Heart?\"  \"Fifty cents,\" said the Indian.  \"For all?\" I asked.  \"No. No. For one. Four bean two dollar.\"  We both exclaimed at this, for it was double the regular price of the beans.  \"All right,\" said Maiden's Heart. \"Twenty-five cents, daytime. Fifty cents, night.\"  We looked at each other, and concluded to pay the price and depart. I gave him two dollars, and asked him to open the gate and let us out.  [Illustration: \"ANOTHER BEAN.\"]  He grinned.  \"No. No. We got no key. Captain got key. Come up wall. Go down wall.\"  At this, we walked out into the square, and were about to ascend the inclined plane when the sentinel came up and stopped us. Thereupon a low conversation ensued between him and Maiden's Heart, at the end of which the sentry put his hand into his pocket and pulled out three beans, which he held out to us. I did not hesitate, but gave him a dollar and a half for them. He took the money and let us pass on,--Maiden's Heart at my side.  \"You want more bean?\" said he.  \"Oh, no!\" I answered. \"No, indeed,\" said Rectus.  When we reached the place where we had left our apparatus, I swung the rope over the wall, and, hooking the grapnel firmly on the inside, prepared to go down, for, as before, I wished to be under Rectus, if he should slip. But Maiden's Heart put his hand on my shoulder.  \"Hold up!\" he said. \"I got 'nother bean. Buy this.\"  \"Don't want it,\" said I.  \"Yes. Yes,\" said Maiden's Heart, and he coolly unhooked the grapnel from the wall.  I saw that it was of no use to contend with a big fellow like that, as strong as two common men, and I bought the bean.  I took the grapnel from Maiden's Heart, who seemed to give it up reluctantly, and as I hooked it on the wall, I felt a hand upon my shoulder. I looked around, and saw the sentinel. He held out to me another bean. It was too dark to see the quality of it, but I thought it was very small. However, I bought it. One of these fellows must be treated as well as the other.  Maiden's Heart and the sentry were now feeling nervously in their pockets.  I shook my head vigorously, and saying, \"No more! no more!\" threw myself over the wall, and seized the rope, Rectus holding the grapnel in its place as I did so. As I let myself down from knot to knot, a thought crossed my mind: \"How are we going to get that grapnel after we both are down?\"  It was a frightening thought. If the two Indians should choose, they could keep the rope and grapnel, and, before morning, the whole posse of red-skins might be off and away! I did not think about their being so far from home, and all that. I only thought that they'd be glad to get out, and that they would all come down our rope.  These reflections, which ran through my mind in no time at all, were interrupted by Rectus, who called down from the top of the wall, in a voice that was a little too loud to be prudent:  \"Hurry! I think he's found another bean!\"  I was on the ground in a few moments, and then Rectus came down. I called to him to come slowly and be very careful, but I can't tell how relieved I was when I saw him fairly over the wall and on his way down.  When we both stood on the ground, I took hold of the rope and shook it. I am not generally nervous, but I was a little nervous then. I did not shake the grapnel loose. Then I let the rope go slack, for a foot or two, and gave it a big sweep to one side. To my great delight, over came the grapnel, nearly falling on our heads. I think I saw Maiden's Heart make a grab at it as it came over, but I am not sure. However, he poked his head over the wall and said:  \"Good-bye! Come again.\"  We answered, \"Good-bye,\" but didn't say anything about coming again.  As we hurried along homeward, Rectus said:  \"If one of those Indians had kept us up there, while the other one ran into the barracks and got a fresh stock of sea-beans, they would have just bankrupted us.\"  \"No, they wouldn't,\" I said."]]]
