He climbed stiffly out, squinted at the sky line, which was jagged, and at his immediate surroundings, which were barren and lonely and soothing to his soul that hungered for these things. Great, gaunt \"Joshua\" trees stood in grotesque groups all up and down the narrow valley, hiding the way he had come from the way he would go.  It was as if the desert had purposely dropped a curtain before his past and would show him none of his future. Whereat Casey Ryan grinned, took a chew of tobacco and was himself again.  \"If they wanta come pinch me here, I'll meet 'em man to man. Back in town no man's got a show.  They pile in four deep and gang a feller. Out here it's lick er git licked.  They can all go t' thunder. Tahell with town!\"  The odor of coffee boiling in a new pot which the sagebrush fire was fast blackening; the salty, smoky smell of bacon frying in a new frying pan that turned bluish with the heat; the sizzle of bannock batter poured into hot grease--these things made the smiling mouth of Casey Ryan water with desire.  \"Hell!\" said Casey, breathing deep when, stomach full and resentment toward the past blurred by satisfaction with his present, he filled his pipe and fingered his vest pocket for a match.  \"Gas stoves can't cook nothin' so there's any taste to it.  That there's the first real meal I've et in six months. Light a match and turn on the gas and call that a fire!  Hunh! Good old sage er greasewood fer Casey Ryan, from here on!\"  He laid back against the sandy sidehill, tilted his hat over his eyes and crossed his legs luxuriously.  He was in no hurry to continue his journey.  Now that he and the desert were alone together, haste and Casey Ryan held nothing in common.  For awhile he watched a Joshua palm that looked oddly like a giant man with one arm hanging loose at its side and another pointing fixedly at a distant, black-capped butte standing aloof from its fellows.  Casey was tired after his night on the trail.  Easy living in town had softened his muscles and slowed a little that untiring energy which had balked at no hardship.  He was drowsy, and his brain stopped thinking logically and slipped into half-waking fancy.  The Joshua seemed to move, to lift its arm and point more imperatively toward the peak.  Its ungainly head seemed to turn and nod at Casey. What did the darned thing want?  Casey would go when he, got good and ready.  Perhaps he would go that way, and perhaps he would not. Right here was good enough for Casey Ryan at present; and you could ask anybody if he were the man to follow another man's pointing, much less a Joshua tree.  Battering rain woke Casey some hours later and drove him to the shelter of the Ford.  Thunder and lightning came with the rain, and a bellowing wind that rocked the car and threatened once or twice to overturn it. With some trouble Casey managed to button down the curtains and sat huddled on the front seat, watching through a streaming windshield the buffeted wilderness.  He was glad he had not unloaded his outfit; gladder still that the storm had not struck which he was traveling. Down the trail toward him a small river galloped, washing deep gullies where the wheels of his car offered obstruction to its boisterousness.  \"She's a tough one,\" grinned Casey, in spite of the chattering of his teeth.  \"Looks like all the water in the world is bein' poured down this pass.  Keeps on, I'll have to gouge out a couple of Joshuays an' turn the old Ford into a boat--but Casey'll keep agoin'!\"  Until inky dark it rained like the deluge.  Casey remained perched in his one-man ark and tried hard to enjoy himself and his hard-won freedom.  He stabbed open a can of condensed milk, poured it into a cup, and drank it and ate what was left of his breakfast bannock, which he had fortunately put away in the car out of the reach of a hill of industrious red ants.  He thought vaguely of cranking the car and going on, but gave up the notion.  One sidehill, he decided, was as good as another sidehill for the present.  That night Casey slept fitfully in the car and discovered that even a wall bed in a despised apartment house may be more comfortable than the front seat of a Ford.  His bones ached by morning, and he was hungry enough to eat raw bacon and relish it. But the sun was fighting through the piled clouds and shone cheerfully upon the draggled pass, and Casey boiled coffee and fried bacon and bannock beside the trail, and for a little while was happy again.  From breakfast until noon he was busy as a beaver repairing the washout beneath the car and on to the top of the hill. She was going to have to get down and dig in her toes to make it, he told the Ford, when at last he heaved pick and shovel into the tonneau, packed in his cooking outfit and made ready to crank up.  From then until supper time he wore a trail around the car, looking to see what was wrong and why he could not crank.  He removed hootin'-annies and dingbats (using Casey's mechanical terms) looked them over dissatisfiedly, and put them back without having done them ny good whatever.  Sometimes they were returned to a different place, I imagine, since I know too well how impartial Casey is with the mechanical parts of a Ford.  He made camp there that night, pitching his little tent in the trail for pure cussedness, and defying aloud a traveling world to make him move until he got good and ready.  He might have saved his vocabulary, for the road was impassable before him and behind; and had Casey managed to start the car, he could not have driven a mile in either direction.  Since he did not know that, the next day he painstakingly cleaned the spark plugs and tried again to crank the Ford; couldn't, and removed more hootin'-annies and dingbats than he had touched the day before. That night he once more pitched his tent in the trail, hoping in his heart that some one would drive along and dispute his right to camp there; when he would lick the doggone cuss.  On the fourth day, after a long, fatiguing session with the vitals of a Ford that refused to be cranked, Casey was busy gathering brush, for his supper fire when Fate came walking up' the trail.  Fate appears in many forms.  In this instance it assumed the shape of a packed burro that poked its nose around a group of Joshuas, stopped abruptly and backed precipitately into another burro which swung out of the trail and went careening awkwardly down the slope.  The stampeding burro had not seen the Ford at all, but accepted the testimony of its leader that something was radically wrong with the trail ahead. His pack bumped against the yuccas as he went; after him lurched a large man, heavy to the point of fatness, yelling hoarse threats and incoherent objurgations.  Casey threw down his armful of dead brush and went after the lead burro which was blazing itself a trail in an entirely different direction. The lead burro had four large canteens strapped outside its pack, and Casey was growing so short of water that he had begun to debate seriously the question of draining the radiator on the morrow.  I don't suppose many of you would believe the innate cussedness of a burro when it wants to be that way.  Casey hazed this one to the hills and back down the trail for half a mile before he rushed it into a clump of greasewood and sneaked up on it when it thought itself hidden from all mortal eyes.  After that he dug heels into the sand and hung on.  Memory resurrected for his need certain choice phrases coined in times of stress for the ears of burros alone.  Luxury and civilization and fifty-five thousand dollars and a wife were as if they had never been.  He was Casey Ryan, the prospector, fighting a stubborn donkey all over a desert slope. He led it conquered back to the Ford, tied it to a wheel and lifted off the four canteens, gratified with their weight and hoping there were more on the other burro.  He had quite forgotten that he had meant to lick the first man he saw, and grinned when the fat man came toiling back with the other animal.  By the time their coffee was boiled and their bacon fried, each one knew the other's past history and tentative plans for the future, censored and glossed somewhat by the teller but received without question or criticism.  The fat man's name was Barney Oakes, and he had heard of Casey Ryan and was glad to meet him.  Though Casey had never heard of Barney Oakes, he discovered that they both knew Bill Masters, the garage man at Lund; and further gossip revealed the amazing fact that Barney Oakes had once been the husband of the woman whom Casey had very nearly married, the widow who cooked for the Lucky Lode.  \"Boy, you're sure lucky she turned loose on yuh before yuh went an' married her!\"  Barney congratulated Casey, slapping his great thigh and laughing loudly.  \"She shore is handy with her tongue--that old girl. Ever hear a sawmill workin' overtime? That's her--rippin' through knots an' never blowin' the whistle fer quittin' time. I never knowed a man could have as many faults as what she used t' name over fer me.\"  He drained his cup and sighed with great content.  \"At that, I stayed with her seven months and fourteen days,\" he boasted.  \"I admit, two of them months I was laid up with a busted ankle an' shoulder blade. Tunnel caved in on me.\"  They talked late that night and were comrades, brothers, partners share and share alike before they slept.  Next morning Casey tried again to start the Ford; couldn't; and yielded to Barney's argument that burros were better than a car for prospectin' in that rough country.  They overhauled Casey's outfit, took all the grub and as much else as the burros could carry and debated seriously what point in the Panamints they should aim for.  \"Where's that there Joshuay tree pointin' to?\" Casey asked finally. \"She's the biggest and oldest in the bunch, and ever since I've been here she's looked like she's got"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2063"],["title","The Trail of the White Mule (#3)"],["body","ethin' on 'er mind. Whadda yuh think, Barney?\"  Barney walked around the yucca, stood behind the extended arm, squinted at the sharp-peaked butte with the black capping, toward which the gaunt tree seemed to point.  He spat out a stale quid of tobacco and took a fresh one, squinted again toward the butte and looked at Casey.  \"She's country I never prospected in, back in there.  I've follered poorer advice than a Joshuay.  Le's try it a whirl.\"  Thus it came to pass that Casey Ryan forsook his Ford for a strange partner with two burros and a clouded past, and fared forth across the barren foothills with no better guidance than the rigid, outstretched limb of a great, gaunt Joshua tree.    CHAPTER THREE  In a still sunny gulch which shadows would presently fill to the brim, Casey Ryan was reaching, soiled bandanna in his hand, to pull a pot of bubbling coffee from the coals,--a pot now blackened with the smoke of many campfires to prove how thoroughly a part of the open land it had become.  Something nipped at his right shoulder, and at the same instant ticked the coffeepot and overturned it into a splutter of steam and hot ashes.  The spiteful crack of a rifle shot followed close. Casey ducked behind a nose of rock, and big Barney Oakes scuttled for cover, spilling bacon out of the frying pan as he went.  For a week the two had been camped in this particular gulch, which drew in to a mere wrinkle on the southwestern slope of the black-topped butte, toward which the Joshua tree in the pass had directed them. Nearly a week they had spent toiling across the hilly, waterless waste, with two harrowing days when their canteens flopped empty on the burros and big Barney stumbled oftener than Casey liked to see.  Casey himself had gone doggedly ahead, his body bent forward, his square shoulders sagging a bit, but with never a thought of doing anything but go on.  A red splotch high up on the side of this gulch promised \"water formation\" as prospectors have a way of putting it.  They had found the water, else adventure would have turned to tragedy. Near the water they had also found a promising outcropping of silver-bearing quartz. Barney's blowpipe had this very day shown them silver in castle-building quantities.  Just at this moment, however, they were not thinking of mines. They were eyeing a round hole in the coffeepot from which a brown rivulet ran spitting into the blackening coals.  Casey was the more venturesome.  He raised himself to see if he could discover where the bullet had come from, and very nearly met the fate of the coffeepot.  He felt the wind of a second bullet that spatted against a boulder near Barney.  Barney burrowed deeper into his covert.  Casey went down on all fours and crawled laboriously toward a concealing bank covered thick with brush.  A third bullet clipped a twig of sage just about three inches above the middle of his back, and Casey flattened on his stomach and swore.  Some one on the peak of the hill had good eyesight, he decided.  Neither spoke, other than to swear in undertones; for voices carried far in that clear atmosphere, and nothing could be gained by conversation.  Darkness never had poured so slowly into that gulch since the world was young.  The campfire had died to black embers before Casey ventured from his covert, and Barney Oakes seemed to have holed up for the season.  Unless you have lived for a long while in a land altogether empty of any human life save your own, you cannot realize the effect of having mysterious bullets zip past your ears and ruin your supper for you.  \"Somebody's gunnin' fer us, looks like t' me,\" Barney observed belatedly in a hoarse whisper, from his covert.  \"Found that out, did yuh?  Well, it ain't the first time Casey's been shot at and missed,\" Casey retorted peevishly in the lee of the bank. \"Say! I knowed the sing of bullets before I was old enough to carry a tune.\"  \"So'd I,\" boasted Barney, \"but that ain't sayin' I learned t' like the song.\"  \"What I'm figurin' out now,\" said Casey, \"is how to get up there an' AT 'am.  An' how we kin do it without him seein' us.  Goin' t' be kinda ticklish--but it ain't the first ticklish job Casey Ryan ever tackled.\"  \"It can't be did,\" Barney stated flatly.  \"An' if it could be did, I wouldn't do it.  I ain't as easy t' miss as what you be. I got bulk.\"  \"A hole bored through your tallow might mebbe do you good,\" Casey suggested harshly.  \"Might let in a little sand.  You can't never tell--\"  \"My vitals,\" said Barney with dignity, \"is just as close to the surface as what your vitals be.  I ain't so fat--I'm big.  An' I got all the sand I need.  I also have got sense, which some men lacks.\"  \"What yuh figurin' on doin'?\" Casey wanted to know.  \"Set here under a bush an' let 'em pick yuh up same as they would a cottontail, mebbe? We got a hull night to work in, an' Casey's eyes is as good as anybody's in the dark.  More'n that, Casey's six-gun kin shoot just as hard an' fast as a rifle--let 'im git close enough.\"  Barney did not want to be left alone and said so frankly. Neither did he want to climb the butte.  He could see no possible gain in climbing to meet an enemy or enemies who could hear the noise of approach. It was plain suicide, he declared, and Barney Oakes was not ready to die.  But Casey could never listen to argument when a fight was in prospect. He filled a canteen, emptied a box of cartridges into his pocket, stuck his old, Colt six-shooter inside his trousers belt, and gave Barney some parting instruction under his breath.  Barney was to move camp down under the bank by the spring, and dig himself in there, so that the only approach would be up the narrow gulch.  He would then wait until Casey returned.  \"Somebody's after our outfit, most likely,\" Casey reasoned. \"It ain't the first time I've knowed it to happen.  So you put the hull outfit outa sight down there an' stand guard over it.  If we'd 'a' run when they opened up, they'd uh cleaned us out and left us flat.  They's two of us, an' we'll git 'em from two sides.\"  He stuffed cold bannock into the pocket that did not hold the cartridges and disappeared, climbing the side of the gulch opposite the point which held their ambitious marksman.  To Barney's panicky expostulations he had given little heed. \"If yore vitals is as close to your hide as what you claim,\" Casey had said impatiently, \"an' you don't want any punctures in 'em, git to work an' git that hide of yourn outa sight. It'll take some diggin'; they's a lot of yuh to cover.\"  Barney, therefore, dug like a badger with a dog snuffing at its tail. Casey, on the other hand, climbed laboriously in the darkness a bluff he had not attempted to climb by daylight.  It was hard work and slow, for he felt the need of going quietly. What lay over the rim-rock he did not know, though he meant to find out.  Daylight found him leaning against a smooth ledge which formed a part of the black capping he had seen from the road.  He had spent the night toiling over boulders and into small gulches and out again, trying to find some crevice through which he might climb to the top. Now he was just about where he had been several hours before, and even Casey Ryan could not help realizing what a fine target he would make if he attempted to climb back down the bluff to camp before darkness again hid his movements.  Standing there puffing and wondering what to do next, he saw the two burros come picking their way toward the spring for their morning drink and a handful apiece of rolled oats which Barney kept to bait them into camp.  The lead burro was within easy flinging distance of a rock, from camp, when the thin, unmistakable crack of a rifle-shot came from the right, high up on the rim somewhere beyond Casey.  The lead burro pitched forward, struggled to get up, fell again and rolled over, lodging against a rock with its four feet sticking up at awkward angles in the air.  The second burro, always quick to take alarm, wheeled and went galloping away down the draw.  But he couldn't outgallop the bullet that sent him in a complete somersault down the slope. Barney might keep the rest of his rolled oats, for the burros were through wanting them.  Casey squinted along the rim of black rock that crested the peak irregularly like a stiff, ragged frill of mourning stuff the gods had thrown away.  He could not see the man who had shot the burros. By the intervals between shots, Casey guessed that one man was doing the shooting, though it was probable there were others in the gang. And now that the burros were dead, it became more than ever necessary to locate the gang and have it out with them.  That necessity did not worry Casey in the least.  The only thing that troubled him now was getting up on the rim without being seen.  It was characteristic of Casey Ryan that, though he moved with caution, he nevertheless moved toward their unseen enemy.  Not for a long, long while had Casey been cautious in his behavior, and the necessity galled him.  If the hidden marksman had missed that last burro, Casey would probably have taken a longer chance. But to date, every bullet had gone straight to its destination; which was enough to make any man think twice.  Once during the forenoon, while Casey was standing against the rim-rock staring glumly down upon the camp, Barney's hat, perched on a pick handle, lifted its crown above the edge of his hiding place; an old, old trick Barney was playing to see if the rifle were still there and working.  The rifle worked very well indeed, for Barney was presently flattened into his retreat, swearing and poking his finger through a round hole in his hat.  Casey seized the opportunity created by the diversion and scurried like a lizard across a bare, gravelly slide that had been bothering him for half an hour.  By mid-afternoon he reached a crevice that looked promising enough when he craned up it, but which nearly broke his neck when he had climbed halfway up. Never before "]]]
