Meg Dods is baith land_lord_ and land_leddy_. Ill eneugh to keep the doors open as it is, let be facing Whitsunday and Martinmas--an auld leather pock there is, Maister Francie, in ane of worthy Maister Bindloose the sheriff-clerk's pigeon-holes, in his dowcot of a closet in the burgh; and therein is baith charter and sasine, and special service to boot; and that will be chapter and verse, speer when ye list.\"  \"I had quite forgotten,\" said Tyrrel, \"that the inn was your own; though I remember you were a considerable landed proprietor.\"  \"Maybe I am,\" replied Meg, \"maybe I am not: and if I be, what for no?--But as to what the Laird, whose grandfather was my father's landlord, said to the new doings yonder--he just jumped at the ready penny, like a cock at a grosert, and feu'd the bonny holm beside the Well, that they ca'd the Saint-Well-holm, that was like the best land in his aught, to be carved, and biggit, and howkit up, just at the pleasure of Jock Ashler the stane-mason, that ca's himsell an arkiteck--there's nae living for new words in this new warld neither, and that is another vex to auld folk such as me.--It's a shame o' the young Laird, to let his auld patrimony gang the gate it's like to gang, and my heart is sair to see't, though it has but little cause to care what comes of him or his.\"  \"Is it the same Mr. Mowbray,\" said Mr. Tyrrel, \"who still holds the estate?--the old gentleman, you know, whom I had some dispute with\"----  \"About hunting moorfowl upon the Spring-well-head muirs?\" said Meg. \"Ah, lad! honest Mr. Bindloose brought you neatly off there--Na, it's no that honest man, but his son John Mowbray--the t'other has slept down-by in Saint Ronan's Kirk for these six or seven years.\"  \"Did he leave,\" asked Tyrrel, with something of a faltering voice, \"no other child than the present Laird?\"  \"No other son,\" said Meg; \"and there's e'en eneugh, unless he could have left a better ane.\"  \"He died then,\" said Tyrrel, \"excepting this son, without children?\"  \"By your leave, no,\" said Meg; \"there is the lassie Miss Clara, that keeps house for the Laird, if it can be ca'd keeping house, for he is almost aye down at the Well yonder--so a sma' kitchen serves them at the Shaws.\"  \"Miss Clara will have but a dull time of it there during her brother's absence?\" said the stranger.  \"Out no!--he has her aften jinketing about, and back and forward, wi' a' the fine flichtering fools that come yonder; and clapping palms wi' them, and linking at their dances and daffings. I wuss nae ill come o't, but it's a shame her father's daughter should keep company wi' a' that scauff and raff of physic-students, and writers' prentices, and bagmen, and siclike trash as are down at the Well yonder.\"  \"You are severe, Mrs. Dods,\" replied the guest. \"No doubt Miss Clara's conduct deserves all sort of freedom.\"  \"I am saying naething against her conduct,\" said the dame; \"and there's nae ground to say onything that I ken of--But I wad hae like draw to like, Maister Francie. I never quarrelled the ball that the gentry used to hae at my bit house a gude wheen years bygane--when they came, the auld folk in their coaches, wi' lang-tailed black horses, and a wheen galliard gallants on their hunting horses, and mony a decent leddy behind her ain goodman, and mony a bonny smirking lassie on her pownie, and wha sae happy as they--And what for no? And then there was the farmers' ball, wi' the tight lads of yeomen with the bran new blues and the buckskins--These were decent meetings--but then they were a' ae man's bairns that were at them, ilk ane kend ilk other--they danced farmers wi' farmers' daughters, at the tane, and gentles wi' gentle blood, at the t'other, unless maybe when some of the gentlemen of the Killnakelty Club would gie me a round of the floor mysell, in the way of daffing and fun, and me no able to flyte on them for laughing--I am sure I never grudged these innocent pleasures, although it has cost me maybe a week's redding up, before I got the better of the confusion.\"  \"But, dame,\" said Tyrrel, \"this ceremonial would be a little hard upon strangers like myself, for how were we to find partners in these family parties of yours?\"  \"Never you fash your thumb about that, Maister Francie,\" returned the landlady, with a knowing wink.--\"Every Jack will find a Jill, gang the world as it may--and, at the warst o't, better hae some fashery in finding a partner for the night, than get yoked with ane that you may not be able to shake off the morn.\"  \"And does that sometimes happen?\" asked the stranger.  \"Happen!--and is't amang the Well folk that ye mean?\" exclaimed the hostess. \"Was it not the last season, as they ca't, no farther gane, that young Sir Bingo Binks, the English lad wi' the red coat, that keeps a mail-coach, and drives it himsell, gat cleekit with Miss Rachel Bonnyrigg, the auld Leddy Loupengirth's lang-legged daughter--and they danced sae lang thegither, that there was mair said than suld hae been said about it--and the lad would fain hae louped back, but the auld leddy held him to his tackle, and the Commissary Court and somebody else made her Leddy Binks in spite of Sir Bingo's heart--and he has never daured take her to his friends in England, but they have just wintered and summered it at the Well ever since--and that is what the Well is good for!\"  \"And does Clara,--I mean does Miss Mowbray, keep company with such women as these?\" said Tyrrel, with a tone of interest which he checked as he proceeded with the question.  \"What can she do, puir thing?\" said the dame. \"She maun keep the company that her brother keeps, for she is clearly dependent.--But, speaking of that, I ken what I have to do, and that is no little, before it darkens. I have sat clavering with you ower lang, Maister Francie.\"  And away she marched with a resolved step, and soon the clear octaves of her voice were heard in shrill admonition to her handmaidens.  Tyrrel paused a moment in deep thought, then took his hat, paid a visit to the stable, where his horse saluted him with feathering ears, and that low amicable neigh, with which that animal acknowledges the approach of a loving and beloved friend. Having seen that the faithful creature was in every respect attended to, Tyrrel availed himself of the continued and lingering twilight, to visit the old Castle, which, upon former occasions, had been his favourite evening walk. He remained while the light permitted, admiring the prospect we attempted to describe in the first chapter, and comparing, as in his former reverie, the faded hues of the glimmering landscape to those of human life, when early youth and hope have ceased to gild them.  A brisk walk to the inn, and a light supper on a Welsh rabbit and the dame's home-brewed, were stimulants of livelier, at least more resigned thoughts--and the Blue bedroom, to the honours of which he had been promoted, received him a contented, if not a cheerful tenant.

There must be government in all society--     Bees have their Queen, and stag-herds have their leader;     Rome had her Consuls, Athens had her Archons,     And we, sir, have our Managing Committee.  _The Album of St. Ronan's._   Francis Tyrrel was, in the course of the next day, formally settled in his old quarters, where he announced his purpose of remaining for several days. The old-established carrier of the place brought his fishing-rod and travelling-trunk, with a letter to Meg, dated a week previously, desiring her to prepare to receive an old acquaintance. This annunciation, though something of the latest, Meg received with great complacency, observing it was a civil attention in Maister Tirl; and that John Hislop, though he was not just sae fast, was far surer than ony post of them a', or express either. She also observed with satisfaction, that there was no gun-case along with her guest's baggage; \"for that weary gunning had brought him and her into trouble--the lairds had cried out upon't, as if she made her house a howff for common fowlers and poachers; and yet how could she hinder twa daft hempie callants from taking a start and an ower-loup?[I-10] They had been ower the neighbour's ground they had leave on up to the march, and they werena just to ken meiths when the moorfowl got up.\"  In a day or two, her guest fell into such quiet and solitary habits, that Meg, herself the most restless and bustling of human creatures, began to be vexed, for want of the trouble which she expected to have had with him, experiencing, perhaps, the same sort of feeling from his extreme and passive indifference on all points, that a good horseman has for the over-patient steed, which he can scarce feel under him. His walks were devoted to the most solitary recesses among the neighbouring woods and hills--his fishing-rod was often left behind him, or carried merely as an apology for sauntering slowly by the banks of some little brooklet--and his success so indifferent, that Meg said the piper of Peebles[I-11] would have caught a creelfu' before Maister Francie made out the half-dozen; so that he was obliged, for peace's sake, to vindicate his character, by killing a handsome salmon.  Tyrrel's painting, as Meg called it, went on equally slowly: He often, indeed, showed her the sketches which he brought from his walks, and used to finish at home; but Meg held them very cheap. What signified, she said, a wheen bits of paper, wi' black and white scarts upon them, that he ca'd bushes, and trees, and craigs?--Couldna he paint them wi' green, and blue, and yellow, like the other folk? \"Ye will never mak your bread that way,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20753"],["title","The Wonder Island Boys:  The Tribesmen (#0)"],["body","WONDER ISLAND BOYS                  BY ROGER T.
