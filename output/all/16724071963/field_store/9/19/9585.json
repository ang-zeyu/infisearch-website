Among the adventurers to whom the charter was granted, and who embraced representatives of every rank, profession and occupation, we find Humphrey Weld, the mayor, whose name immediately follows those of the peers of the realm who shared in the undertaking, and Nicholas Ferrar, skinner, who died in 1620, and gave by will \"£300 to the college in Virginia, to be paid when there shall be ten of the infidels’ children placed in it, and in the meantime twenty-four pounds by the yeare to be disbursed unto three discreete and godly men in the colonie, which shall honestly bring up three of the infidels’ children in Christian religion and some good course to live by.\"(139)  (M59)  In the meantime (15 May) seven vessels with emigrants on board had set sail from Woolwich. After frequent delays on the south coast of England they crossed the Atlantic and reached their destination on the 11th August. Yellow fever had unfortunately broken out on board ship during the long voyage, and this, together with the plague, which is generally believed to have been conveyed to Virginia by the fleet, committed great havoc among the early emigrants.(140)  (M60)  It was not long before more money was wanted, and again application was made to the livery companies. The Mercers declined to make any further advance;(141) but with the assistance of the other companies the sum of £5,000 was raised, which was afterwards increased to £18,000.(142) Nevertheless, in spite of every exertion, the company was in the autumn of 1611 on the very verge of ruin, and something had to be done to prevent its utter collapse. It was accordingly again re-constructed, its domains were made to comprise the Bermudas, or Somers Islands, and a third charter granted (12 March, 1612), in which a number of citizens are named as having become adventurers since the last letters patent.(143)  (M61)  A special feature of the charter was the authorisation of one or more lottery or lotteries to be held for the benefit of the company,(144) by virtue of which a lottery was soon afterwards opened in London. The chief prize fell to one Thomas Sharplys, or Sharplisse, a tailor of London, who won \"four thousand crowns in fair plate.\"(145) The lucky winner used the same motto on this occasion as was used by the Merchant Taylors’ Company in their venture in the lottery of 1569.(146) The City’s records are unaccountably silent on the matter of this lottery, but we learn from other sources that the Grocers’ Company adventured the sum of £62 10_s._ of their common goods and drew a prize of £13 10_s._ An offer being made to them to accept the prize subject to a rebate of £10, or in lieu thereof \"a faire rounde salt with a cover of silver all gilt,\" weighing over 44 ozs. at 6_s._ 7_d._ per oz., amounting to the sum of £14 19_s._ 1_d._, the company resolved to accept the salt, \"both in respect it would not be so much losse to the company ... and alsoe in regard this company wants salts.\" The balance of £1 9_s._ was ordered to be paid out of the common goods of the company.(147) Not only the companies but several of the city parishes had ventures in a small way in the lottery. Thus the vestry of St. Mary Colechurch agreed (7 June) to adventure the sum of £6 of the church stock, whereby the church was the gainer of \"twoe spones, price twenty shillinge.\"(148) The parish of St. Mary Woolchurch adventured a less sum, taking only fifty lots at a shilling apiece, in return for which it got a prize of ten shillings.(149) That the lottery was not taken up in the way it was hoped it would be is shown by the fact that just before the drawing—which took place in a house at the west end of St. Paul’s, and lasted from the 29th June till the 20th July—no less than 60,000 blanks were taken out, in order to increase the number of chances in favour of the adventurers.(150)  (M62)  Two years later (1614) another lottery for the same purpose was set on foot. On the 1st April the lords of the council addressed a circular letter to the city companies,(151) enclosing a copy of a pamphlet by Sir Thomas Smith, entitled \"A declaration of the present estate of the English in Virginia, with the final resolucon of the Great Lotterye intended for their supply,\" and exhorting them to do their best to make the lottery a success. The object is there described as a \"worthy and Christian enterprise, full of honour and profitt to His Majestie and the whole realme.\" A copy of this letter was forwarded to the several companies through Sir Thomas Middleton, the mayor,(152) who, as we have already said, was himself a member of the Council of the Virginia Company in 1609. The lotteries, however, found but little favour with the companies, who were actively engaged at the time in managing their recently acquired Irish estates, and had but little money to spare. The Merchant Taylors’ Company contented themselves with voting only £50 out of their common stock for the lottery, leaving it to individual members to venture further sums on their own account as each might think fit.(153) The Grocers’ Company, of which Middleton was a member, voted nothing out of their common stock, but each member was exhorted \"for the general advancement of Christianity and good of the commonwealth,\" to write with his own hands how much he was willing to venture. This was accordingly done (15 April), the lord mayor himself setting the example; but as to the result the company’s records fail to give any information.(154)  (M63)  The prospects of the Virginia Company were seriously imperilled by an ill-advised speech made in the House of Commons by the lord mayor inveighing against the importation of tobacco. The Company was already in disgrace with the House, through the indiscretion of Counsel employed to prosecute a petition on its behalf, and all the members of the Company who held seats in the House were desired to withdraw until it should be decided what action should be taken in the matter. Eventually peace was restored by the offending Counsel coming to the Bar of the House and making a humble submission.(155)  (M64)  In 1618 a scheme was set on foot for taking up vagrant boys and girls that lay begging in the streets of the city, having neither home nor friends, and transporting them to Virginia to be there industriously employed. The scheme came before the Court of Common Council on the 31st July in the form of a petition from a number of citizens. A committee was at once appointed to consider the matter, and on the 24th September they brought in their report.(156) The Virginia Company had agreed to take 100 boys and girls between the ages of eight and sixteen, and to educate and bring them up at the company’s charge. The company were prepared, moreover, to give each boy and girl fifty acres of land, to each boy as soon as he was twenty-four years of age, and to each girl at the age of twenty-one or her marriage, whichever should first happen. The charge of fitting out and transporting that number was estimated at £500, which sum the court agreed should be levied on the inhabitants of the city rateably according as each was assessed towards the last poor rate. The young emigrants were soon afterwards shipped to their new home,(157) and so successfully did the undertaking turn out that in little over a year another application was made to the Common Council (18 Dec., 1619) for another batch of 100 children for shipment to the colony in the following spring.(158) It was desired that the new emigrants should be twelve years old and upwards, with an allowance of £3 apiece for their transportation and 40_s._ apiece for their apparel, \"as was formerly graunted.\" The boys would be put out as apprentices until the age of twenty-one, and the girls likewise until the same age or marriage, after which they would be placed as tenants on the public lands, and be furnished with houses, stock of corn and cattle to begin with, and afterwards enjoy the moiety of all increase and profit. The Common Council being desirous of forwarding \"soe worthy and pious a worke\" as the plantation, accepted the company’s proposal, and directed that a sum of £500 necessary for the purpose should be levied as on the previous occasion.  (M65)  Some hitch, however, appears to have occurred in connection with the shipment of this second consignment of children. The City and the Virginia Company had fallen out for some reason or other. In a letter written about this time to the lord mayor(159) the company express regret that differences should have arisen between the city and themselves. They assure his lordship that there was no real foundation for these differences, seeing that they had now ratified all, and more than all than had been previously offered and accepted. Everything had been done that was necessary for the shipment of the children. The City had collected the requisite funds and the children had been provided, whilst the company on its part had provided a fair ship, and the Privy Council had \"at the city’s desire\" granted its warrant.(160) The company therefore trusted that the lord mayor and aldermen would proceed to the speedy ending of differences.  (M66)  The number of emigrants to Virginia was swelled by the transportation of a number of idle fellows who made it their business to follow the king "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20991"],["title","Follow My Leader: The Boys of Templeton (#0)"],["body","My leader The Boys of Templeton  By Talbot Baines Reed ________________________________________________________________________ Having now read all of this author's books about school life - rather dated even to me - I feel that this book is the one I have enjoyed the most.  It was not published as a book until seven or eight years after the author's death, but that was because the book had been published in serialised form in the Boy's Own Paper.  While the original text looked quite nice it suffered from having been typeset either by an apprentice or by someone rather eccentric.  For example words with an apostrophe representing the \"o\" of \"not\" had the apostrophe consistently in the wrong place, for example \"would'nt\" instead of \"wouldn't\".  We have very carefully cleaned up this class of error, and hope no more are to be found.  We have heard the audiobook, and it is good.  The main heroes of the story are all lovable gentle little chaps, but dreadful things happen, like a boat they have used goes missing, and a folding pencil one of them desperately desires in the stationer's shop goes missing from the shop.  Thus throughout the book there is a constant tension as to whether the police will be called, and eventually one of the boys sends for his father to help sort matters out, as they had got far beyond his own ability to deal with things. ________________________________________________________________________ FOLLOW MY LEADER THE BOYS OF TEMPLETON  BY TALBOT BAINES REED    CHAPTER ONE.  THE BOYS OF TEMPLETON.  HOW OUR HEROES ENTER UPON MORE THAN ONE CAREER.  On a raw, damp morning in early spring, a rather forlorn group of three youngsters might have been seen on the doorstep of Mountjoy Preparatory School, casting nervous glances up and down the drive, and looking anything but a picture of the life and spirits they really represented.  That they were bound on an important journey was very evident.  They were muffled up in ulsters, and wore gloves and top hats--a vanity no Mountjoy boy ever succumbed to, except under dire necessity.  Yet it was clear they were not homeward bound, for no trunks encumbered the lobby, and no suggestion of _Dulce Domum_ betrayed itself in their dismal features.  Nor had they been expelled, for though their looks might favour the supposition, they talked about the hour they should get back that evening, and wondered if Mrs Ashford would have supper ready for them in her own parlour.  And it was equally plain that, whatever their destination might be, they were not starting on a truant's expedition, for the said Mrs Ashford presently came out and handed them each a small parcel of sandwiches, and enjoined on them most particularly to keep well buttoned up, and not let their feet get wet.  \"It will be a cold drive for you, boys,\" said she; \"I've told Tom to put up at Markridge, so you will have a mile walk to warm you up before you get to Templeton.\"  A waggonette appeared at the end of the drive, and began to approach them.  \"Ah, there's the trap; I'll tell Mr Ashford--\"  Mr Ashford appeared just as the vehicle reached the door.  \"Well, boys, ready for the road?  Good bye, and good luck.  Don't forget whose son Edward the Fifth was, Coote.  Keep your heads and you'll get on all right.  I trust you not to get into mischief on the way.  All right, Tom.\"  During this short harangue the three boys hoisted themselves, one by one, into the waggonette, and bade a subdued farewell to their preceptor, who stood on the doorstep, waving to them cheerily, until they turned a corner and found themselves actually on the road to Templeton.  Not to keep the reader further in suspense as to the purpose of this important expedition, our three young gentlemen, having severally attained the responsible age of fourteen summers, and having severally absorbed into their systems as much of the scholastic pabulum of Mountjoy House as that preparatory institution was in the habit of dispensing to boys destined for a higher sphere, were this morning on their way, in awe and trembling, to the examination hall of Templeton school, there to submit themselves to an ordeal which would decide whether or not they were worthy to emerge from their probationary state and take their rank among the public schoolboys of the land.  Such being the case, it is little wonder they looked fidgety as they caught their last glimpse of Mr Ashford, and realised that before they came in sight of Mountjoy again a crisis in the lives of each of them would have come and gone.  \"Whose son was he?\" said Coote, appealingly, in about five minutes.  His voice sounded quite startling, after the long, solemn silence which had gone before.  His two companions stared at him, afterwards at one another; then one of them said--  \"I forget.\"  \"Whose son was he?\" said Coote, turning with an air of desperation to the other.  \"Richard the Third's,\" said the latter.  Coote mused, and inwardly repeated a string of names.  \"Doesn't sound right,\" said he.  \"Are you sure, Dick?\"  \"Who else could it be?\" said the young gentleman addressed as Dick, whose real name was Richardson.  \"Hanged if I know,\" said the unhappy Coote, proceeding to write an R and a 3 on his thumb-nail with a pencil.  \"It doesn't look right I believe because your own name's Richardson, you think everybody else is Richard's son too.\"  And the perpetrator of this very mild joke bent his head over his learned thumb-nail, and frowned.  It was a point of honour at Mountjoy always to punish a joke summarily, whether good, bad, or indifferent.  For a short time, consequently, the paternity of Edward the Fifth was lost sight of, as was also Coote himself, in the performance of the duty which devolved on Richardson and his companion.  This matter of business being at last satisfactorily settled, and Tom, the driver, who had considerately pulled up by the road-side during the \"negotiations,\" being ordered to \"forge ahead,\" the party returned to its former attitude of gloomy anticipation.  \"It's a precious rum thing,\" said Richardson, \"neither you nor Heathcote can remember a simple question like that.  I'd almost forgot it, myself.\"  \"I know I shan't remember anything when the time comes,\" said Heathcote. \"I said my Latin Syntax over to Ashford, without a mistake, yesterday, and I've forgotten every word of it now.\"  \"What I funk is the _viva voce_ Latin prose,\" said Coote.  \"I say, Dick, what's the gender of 'Amnis, a river?'\"  Dick looked knowing, and laughed.  \"None of your jokes,\" said he, \"you don't catch me that way--'Amnis,' a city, is neuter.\"  Coote's face lengthened, as he made a further note on his other thumb- nail.  \"I could have sworn it was a river,\" said he.  \"I say, whatever shall I do?  I don't know how I shall get through it.\"  \"Through what--the river?\" said Heathcote.  \"Bless you, you'll get through swimmingly.\"  There was a moment's pause.  Richardson looked at Coote; Coote looked at Richardson, and between them they thought they saw a joke.  Tom pulled up by the road-side once more, while Heathcote arranged with his creditors on the floor of the waggonette.  When, at length, the order to proceed was given, that trusty Jehu ventured on a mild expostulation.  \"Look'ee here, young gem'an,\" said he, touching his hat. \"You've got to get to Templeton by ten o'clock, and it's past nine now. I guess you'd better save up them larks for when you're coming home.\"  \"None of your cheek, Tom,\" said Richardson, \"or we'll have you down here, and pay you out, my boy.  Put it on, can't you?  Why don't you whip the beast up?\"  The prospect of coming down to be paid out by his vivacious passengers was sufficiently alarming to Tom to induce him to take their admonition seriously to heart; and for the rest of the journey, although several times business transactions were taking place on the floor of the vehicle, the plodding horse held on its course, and Markridge duly hove in sight.  With the approaching end of the journey, the boys once more became serious and uncomfortable.  \"I say,\" said Coote, in a whisper, as if Dr Winter, at Templeton, a mile away, were within hearing, \"do tell me whose son he was.  I'm certain he wasn't Richard the Third's.  Don't be a cad, Dick; you might tell a fellow.  I'd tell you, if I knew.\"  \"I've told you one father,\" said Dick, sternly, \"and he didn't have more.  If you want another, stick down Edward the Sixth.\"  Coote's face brightened, as he produced his pencil and cleaned his largest unoccupied nail.  \"That sounds more--, Oh, but, I say, how can Edward the Sixth be Edward the Fifth's father?  Besides, he had no family and-- Oh, what a howling howler I shall come!\"  His friends regarded him sympathetically, and assisted him to dismount.  \"We shall have to step out,\" said Richardson; \"it's five-and-twenty to ten, and it's a good mile.  Look here, Tom; you've got to come and fetch us at the school, do you hear?  We're not going to fag back here after the exam.\"  \"My orders was to wait here till you pick me up, young gentlemen,\" said Tom, grinning.  \"Mind what you're up to in them 'saminations.\"  With which parting sally our heroes found themselves alone, with their faces towards Templeton.  To any wayfarers less overwhelmed with care, that mile walk from Markridge to Templeton over the breezy downs, with the fresh sea air meeting you, with the musical hum of the waves on the beach below, and the glimmer of the spring sun on the ocean far ahead, would have been bracing and inspiriting.  As it was, it was not without its attractions even for the three boys; for did they not stand on the precincts of that enchanted ground occupied and glorified by the heroes of Templeton?  Was not this very road along which they walked a highway along which Templeton walked, or peradventure raced, or it may be bicycled?  Were not these downs the hunting-ground over which the Templeton Harriers coursed in chase of the Templeton hares?  Was not that square tower"]]]
