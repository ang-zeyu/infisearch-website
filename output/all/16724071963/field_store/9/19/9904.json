[Facsimile Signature] J.M.Schofield   THIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED TO THE YOUNG CITIZENS WHOSE PATRIOTISM, VALOR AND MILITARY SKILL MUST BE THE SAFEGUARD OF THE INTERESTS, THE HONOR AND THE GLORY OF THE AMERICAN UNION   FORTY-SIX YEARS IN THE ARMY  BY LIEUTENANT-GENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD  NEW YORK THE CENTURY CO. 1897   Copyright, 1897 by The Century Co.  The De Vinne Press.   PREFACE  Most of the chapters constituting the contents of this volume, were written, from time to time, as soon as practicable after the events referred to, or after the publication of historical writings which seemed to me to require comment from the point of view of my personal knowledge.  They were written entirely without reserve, and with the sole purpose of telling exactly what I thought and believed, not with any purpose of publication in my lifetime, but as my contribution to the materials which may be useful to the impartial historian of some future generation.  These writings had been put away for safe-keeping with \"instructions for the guidance of my executors,\" in which I said:  \"All the papers must be carefully revised, errors corrected if any are found, unimportant matter eliminated, and everything omitted which may seem, to a cool and impartial judge, to be unjust or unnecessarily harsh or severe toward the memory of any individual. I have aimed to be just, and not unkind.  If I have failed in any case, it is my wish that my mistakes may be corrected, as far as possible.  I have not attempted to write history, but simply to make a record of events personally known to me, and of my opinion upon such acts of others, and upon such important subjects, as have come under my special notice.  It is my contribution to the materials from which the future historian must draw for his data for a truthful history of our time.\"  Now, in the winter of 1896-97, I have endeavored to discharge, as far as I am able, the duty which I had imposed on my executors, and have decided to publish what I had written in past years, with corrections and comments, while many of the actors in the great drama of the Civil War are still living and can assist in correcting any errors into which I may have fallen.  After my chapters relating to the campaign of 1864 in Tennessee were in type, the monograph by General J. D. Cox, entitled \"Franklin,\" was issued from the press of Charles Scribner's Sons.  His work and mine are the results of independent analysis of the records, made without consultation with each other.   TABLE OF CONTENTS  Chapter I.

Douglas-- Restoration to Cadet Duty--James B. McPherson--John B. Hood--Robert E. Lee.  I was born in the town of Gerry, Chautauqua County, New York, September 29, 1831.  My father was the Rev. James Schofield, who was then pastor of the Baptist Church in Sinclairville, and who was from 1843 to 1881 a \"home missionary\" engaged in organizing new churches and building \"meeting-houses\" in Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri.  My mother was Caroline McAllister, daughter of John McAllister of Gerry.  We removed to Illinois in June, 1843, and, after a short stay in Bristol, my father made a new home for his family in Freeport, where he began his missionary work by founding the First Baptist Church of that place.  In all my childhood and youth I had what I regard as the best possible opportunities for education, in excellent public schools where the rudiments of English were taught with great thoroughness, and in a fair amount of all kinds of manly sports, and in hard work, mainly on the farm and in building a new home, which left no time and little inclination for any kind of mischief.  At sixteen years of age I spent three months in surveying public lands in the wilds of northern Wisconsin, and at seventeen taught district school in the little town of Oneco.  By that time I had chosen the law as my profession, and was working hard to complete the preparatory studies at my own expense.                                                    APPOINTMENT TO WEST POINT  The winter's school term in Oneco having closed early in the spring of 1849, I returned to Freeport and resumed my struggle with Latin. Then an unforseen event turned the course of my life.  The young man who had been appointed to West Point from our district only a year or two before had failed to continue his course in the Military Academy.  Thus a vacancy occurred just at the close of Mr. Thomas J. Turner's term in Congress.  There was no time for applications or for consultation.  He must select another candidate to enter the following June, or leave the place to be filled by his successor. Fortunately for me, Mr. Turner, as one of the public-school directors, had been present at an examination where the subject with which I had to deal was mathematical; if he had caught me at Latin, the result must have been fatal to all my prospects.  Besides, Mr. Turner had heard from his brother James of the stamina I had shown in the public land-surveying expedition; and also from my father of my determination to get a good education before beginning the study of law.  So he brought me a cadet appointment when he came home, and said he believed a boy with that record could get through West Point, the training there being, in his opinion, a good preparation for the study of law.  The little savings from all my past work had been invested in a piece of land which was sold to fit me out for my journey to West Point, including some inexpensive visits en route.  I reported at the Academy on June 1, 1849, with less than two dollars in my pocket, which I conscientiously deposited with the treasurer, as required by the regulations.  My reception was of the most satisfactory character.  William P. Curlin of the second class, and Hezekiah H. Garber of the third, both from Illinois, found me out very soon after I reported, took me under their protection in a brotherly way, and gave me some timely advice--not to take too seriously any little fun the \"men\" might make of my blue dress-coat and fancy gilt buttons, or anything like that; but I never experienced anything even approaching to hazing.  My rather mature appearance may have had something to do with the respect generally paid me.  It was true I was only seventeen years and nine months old, as recorded in the register, but my experience may have had some visible effect.  I was assigned to a room in the old South Barracks, which were demolished the next year.  My room-mates were Henry H. Walker and John R. "]]]
