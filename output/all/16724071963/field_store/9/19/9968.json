In this probably he was right, but he had overdone it.  I found the Serbs and the Czechs to be the best people over passports in Central Europe.  In Western Europe Belgium is most enlightened, having practically abolished the visa.  France is striving to follow Belgium's lead.  England in this matter, as in the matter of her charges for postage, telephones, and railway fares, seems to have completely lost that practical common sense which in the past has distinguished her from other nations.  She charges foreigners heavily, keeps them waiting, and treats them impolitely.  From Americans, for instance, there is a chorus of complaint on the ground of incivility. Not that Americans shine in this matter of passports for their own country.  America sets Europe an unenlightened example of red-tape and venality.  What then, is the game in Europe?  Why do free men and women spend golden forenoons in stuffy rooms, to fill in forms, to be brow-beaten by police and porters and clerks, treated like criminals or paupers, or unemployed come for an allowance?  Perhaps they are paid for it?  No, they actually have to pay, and pay heavily, suffering as it were injury on the top of insult.  It was partly explained to me in Munich by the British Consul-General. At Munich there is a Polish Consul and Vice-Consul, but there has been nothing to do, Poland having remarkably little business in Bavaria. The post languished.  The Vice-Consul was recalled; the clerk was dismissed.  One surmised the Consul himself might go and hand over his minute business to some other consulate which, no doubt, would have done it cheaply.  But no.  One day a solution occurred to the Consul. All Polish subjects in Bavaria ought to have Polish passports from the Polish Consul.  Police orders to that effect were therefore issued. All who claimed to be Polish, or to have been born in those parts of Germany or Austria now Polish territory, were to put in an appearance. They would receive passports and would be duly charged.  But, having registered the whole Polish population, what then?  \"Oh, I only give them visas for three months,\" says the Consul.  \"Every quarter they must come again.\"  So he converted his consulate into a revenue-paying establishment. What does it matter about the public?  It is only asked to give one day in ninety to these formalities and has the other eighty-nine to itself.  The Polish passport office in Berlin fully confirms this point of view. Here are inordinate crowds whom politics have separated from kith and kin, trying to get passes to go home, to live, to exist.  The door-keeper smokes a cigar; the first clerk makes eyes at the women applicants, the girl clerks suck sweets, the Consulate clock runs on, and you pay hundreds of German marks each for the upkeep of the business.  The Poles, or indeed, the British, or the Americans, for we are all tarred by the same brush, might take a lesson from the Czecho-Slovaks, who have at Vienna a bureau which will get your passport visa and your railway ticket for you, and reserve you a room in a hotel in Prague without any fee.  The enlightened Government of this new republic understands that that is the best propaganda for their country which can be done.  Not that Czecho-Slovakia does not charge for a visa and charge for permission to go out of the country.  At Cheb I nearly missed my train whilst an official was weighing up in his mind how much he should charge for allowing me to go through without a visa.  Another aspect of the passport trouble in Europe is local nationalism which at Budapest takes the form of insisting on asking you questions in Hungarian and refusing to understand any other tongue.  As you have to spend hours with the police in the Magyar capital before you obtain permission to stay there and again before you obtain permission to go away, this is peculiarly distressing.  Under such circumstances is it surprising that there is stagnation of peoples in Europe?  This stagnation is great, and it is noticeable in almost every great city of the continent.  It is a rich time for the hotel-keepers.  There is scarcely a capital in Europe where you can reckon on finding a room without trouble.  The following experiences are symptomatic enough: at Rome I visited about twenty hotels; shut out for the night, got into a \"strange place\" about three a.m.; Stuttgart, out all night; Sofia, visited all hotels, all full, slept in guard-room of town-patrol; Sofia, second time, shared a room with an officer; Vienna, toured city in a cab and found nothing; Warsaw, spent nine hours going from hotel to hotel, got a room for a thousand-mark tip. In Constantinople you can find cases of three families in one apartment.  Wherever you go you are going to have adventures in finding a room, unless you are an officer or a member of an Allied Commission, or belong to the Red Cross or Starving Children's Fund, or some organization that has facilities for looking out for itself.  Poor old Europe!  She was more of a unity in the days when we were \"an armed camp.\"  We have broken the power of militarism.  There has been a revolution in Russia.  A British statesman in the House of Commons, in 1917, said it was bliss to be alive, and to be young was very heaven. Some millions of young men died before Armistice Day, 1918.  Since then there has been great work clearing away barbed-wire entanglements along the old front.  But it seems to be a nightmare task: entanglements multiply upon us faster than we can clear the old ones away.  You cannot get across Europe because of the obstructions: you cannot circulate.     LETTERS OF TRAVEL  II. FROM CONSTANTINOPLE (I)  It has been a bleak early spring with snow on the uplands of Thrace. For those who travel from Paris to Constantinople on that Western moving shuttle, the Orient Express, there would be nothing to trouble the mind unpleasantly--except in that the more comfortable we are, the more we demand and the more we grumble.  But if you travel by the ordinary unheated train, where even the first-class carriages are more or less bereft of glass and have the windows loosely boarded up with bits of old packing-cases, you taste something of the persistent northern wind which blows down sleet and rain from the Black Sea, from Russia, as it were Russian unhappiness it was blowing down.  You arrive at Sofia at midnight in torrents of rain.  You take a cab and visit every hotel, large or small, in the Bulgarian capital, and are refused.  People are already sleeping three or four in a room, sleeping in outhouses and bath-rooms, refugee Bulgars from the lost Bulgar territories, refugee Turks, refugee Russians.  You return to the station and it is closed for the night, and you have a wordy discussion with the eternal cabman as to whether you shall pay a hundred or two hundred francs--Bulgarian francs or levas which are, however, worth a bare three-farthings each to-day.  You find shelter in a wayside café which is half café, half guard-house for the town patrol.  Soldiers are stretched out snoring on the floor.  Five levas to sit up, ten to lie down!  By that time of night you are fain to lie down.  A dreary journey on to Philippopolis and Svilengrad, with the wind lashing the train, lashing it all the way to the Chataldja lines and the zone of Allied control.  Eight passport examinations, eight examinations of your baggage, plentiful two, three, and four-hour stops, a land of ruined railway stations and bare hills, and only late on the second evening after Sofia do you creep into the imperial city.  It is Stamboul at night, agleam with lights, running with mud, flocking with dense crowds.  You change some money to piastres at a small booth, and your pocket is at once picked--a common experience.  The Pera tram is so crowded that you escape being asked for a fare, which is fortunate, seeing that you have no Turkish money.  So across the wonderful bridge on which all the nations of the world are seen walking, up to the so-called pleasant heights of Pera and its hotels and palaces.  Here for a dirty little room one pays more than in a first-class hotel in New York.  You are fortunate if you find even that soon.  A Greek-owned hotel.  You scan the names of the occupants--they are of all nationalities of Europe.  Russians and Armenians seem most to abound.  There appears to be a Scotsman among them, a Mr. Fraser, but he is a Scot resident in Smyrna and smokes a narghile every evening after supper.  The lounge of the hotel looks like a crèche for the children of refugees.  But couples are seen here on the couches interested only in themselves, and a long-haired Russian is at the piano playing Scriabine devotedly and with deep concentration, as if the boisterousness of the children were unheard.  Constantinople has five times as many people as it can house, a city now of appalling unhappiness and misery, and of a concomitant luxury and waste.  A scene at night: two children, a boy and a girl, lie huddled together on the pavement sleeping whilst the rain beats down upon them.  The crowd keeps passing, keeps passing, and some step over them, many glance questioningly downward, but all pass on.  No one stops.  I stood at a corner and watched.  Then I walked up to the children and wakened them and tried to make them speak.  But they stared with their pale faces and said nothing.  At a neighbouring pastry-cook's I bought two cakes and brought them to them, and stirred them up to take them, which they did eagerly, each grasping tightly a cake in the little hand.  I stopped a Russian woman who was hesitating as she passed.  \"There are many,\" said she.  \"It is quite common.  You see plenty babies lying in the rain.  When you come?  You come off a ship? . . .  The only way to help them is give them piastres.\"  I did that, and by that time a little crowd had gathered and every one began to fret and give a little money to them.  So"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21499"],["title","Europe—Whither Bound? (#4)"],["body"," crowd changed its mind, and the children began to have little sheaves of paper-money in their hands.  And still they lay in the rain and no one could take them in.  The Russians have got Constantinople at last.  It is an irony of Fate. There are a hundred thousand of them there, the best blood of Russia, and the most charming and delightful people in Europe in themselves, though now almost entirely destitute of means.  A large Russian army without arms is not very far away, and a Russian generalissimo without power stays in his yacht at Galata.  The great city has been outwardly transformed by the Russians who seem at first to have taken over all the business and to have dispossessed innumerable Turks and Greeks. Russian is the predominant language; all the best restaurants and many of the shops seem to be Russian, and Russian pedlars in scores cry their wares in the streets.  Greek and Turkish business is modest and retiring, but everything Russian is advertised by large artistic signs. The gleaming lights of innumerable \"Lotto Parlours\" catch the eye, you pass with the rolling crowd into the cabaret, the music-hall, the theatre, the café, the restaurant, the book-shop--all Russian.  You see the establishments of Russian doctors, lawyers, dentists, dancing-masters.  In an improvised wooden hut you see a celebrated portrait-painter sitting, ready to paint you whilst you wait or execute commissions of any kind.  The restaurants all have Russian names and sometimes refer back to business left behind in Russia--the restaurant \"Birzha\" from Rostof, \"Kievsky Ugolok\" from Kiev, \"Veliky Moskovsky Kruzhok,\" the \"Yar,\" and the like.  These are very tastefully arranged and the cooking is excellent, being under the supervision of celebrated Russian chefs.  Thus at the \"Kievsky Ugolok\" it is well known that the cook of Prince Vorontsof is in charge, and the restaurant does not merely live by reputation but an excellence of cuisine testifies in itself to some master-hand.  The waitresses at most of these Russian establishments are often women of society, and some of them very beautiful in the simplicity of uniform.  There is a fascinating added pleasure in being waited upon by such gracious women, but the heart aches for the fate of some of them.  On each table is a ticket with the name and patronymic of the waitress, thus, Tatiana Mihailovna, or Sophia Vladimirovna.  They are on a level with those they serve, and the women embrace them, the men kiss their hands.  Naturally there are no such things as tips; service is charged for in the bill.  Elegance mingles with melancholy.  Russians meet and talk endlessly, and sigh for Russia, and the Russian music croons the night long from the musicians' gallery or orchestra.  The saddest shops are those which, no doubt, belong mostly to Armenians and Spanish Jews, where \"valuables\" are exposed, the miscellaneous collections of the things the Russians have sold or wish to sell.  Here are rings, lockets, bracelets, fur-coats and wraps, gold vases, trinket-cases, odd spoons of Caucasian silver, cigarette-holders,--like so many locks of hair cut from diverse humanity.  Here lie intimate possessions, prized, not likely to be sold, seemingly quietly reproachful under the public gaze, baptismal crosses, jewelled girdles, gloves, Paris blouses, English costumes.  The refugees must sell all that they have, and some have sold all.  I met the wife of a colonel of Life Guards.  She was dressed in a cotton skirt, a cream-coloured \"woolly,\" a waterproof, and a wretched cheap collar of fur.  Once she never stepped out of her house but into a car.  Now in weather-beaten thin old boots she must tramp from place to place over the cobbles, living in one room with her family, washes the clothes herself, scrubs the floor, has no money.  The women have won the unbounded admiration of the British in Constantinople.  For pluck these Russian women would be hard to rival.  But what a destiny!  They spend their money, they sell their jewels and rings, they sell their clothes, they take out trays of chocolates to sell in the streets and shiver at the street-corners; to feed their children they sell more clothes. Hundreds of cases have been discovered in which the women are confined to their rooms, having sold almost all their wearing apparel, and having nothing in which to appear on the streets.  The refugee peasantry and working class are mostly confined in barbed-wire internment camps outside the city, and guarded by Sengalese.  Twenty per cent get permission to go into the city each day.  The seventy or eighty thousand indigent Russians in Constantinople belong mostly to the upper classes.  Very many belong to Petrograd society, and are people who fled to the Crimea and the Caucasus, were caught up in the Deniken or Wrangel panic, and transported hither.  They are well-educated people, speaking English and French, and well-read and accomplished.  But how little are those modern accomplishments when it comes to the elemental realities of life.  A beautiful young countess is employed in a bakery to sell bread, and is lucky.  An erstwhile lion and ex-general has a job in a laundry.  Pride intervenes only to stop them begging.  How few are the beggars!  But you see the nicest of girls with pinched white faces trying to sell _loukoum_.  Even hard Scotsmen passing by are fain to give them money and take nothing in return.  You see the strangest vendors--children standing at a street corner trying to sell a blouse and a pair of boots, tatterdemalions trying to dispose of unsaleable rags, ex-students with heaps of textbooks trying to sell to those students who, despite everything, are still carrying on.  When new boat-loads of refugees arrive, the street-selling is naturally augmented by a more hopeful crowd, and it was possible to see one day little bears with scarlet ribbons round their necks being offered for sale on the pavement, tiny baby-bears with pink noses and sprawling feet, fed with milk from wine bottles:  \"_Dvadsat lira, dvadsat lira!_\"  Alas, the temptations are great.  Need becomes more and more incessant. Starvation stares thousands in the face.  One sees those who keep their heads up still, but we lose sight of many who are utterly cast down and lost.  Many a Russian has gone down here in this great city and been lost, vanished into the hideous underworld of the Levant.  They sell all their jewels and then sell the last jewel of all.  In the cabarets and night-halls of low amusement there is nude dancing and drink, lascivious Greeks, drunken American sailors capable of enormities of behaviour, British Tommies with the rolling eye, \"seeing the world and being paid for it\" as the posters say.  The public places are a scandal, and the private dens got up in all sorts of styles with rose-coloured shaded lights and divans and cushions for abandonment to drugs and sensual affections must be explored individually to be described.  A part of old Russia has come to Constantinople--to die.  In charge of this imbroglio is a British General.  The city is under Allied control, and is patrolled by the troops of four nations, but the British is the main authority.  G.H.Q. Constantinople occupies a large barracks which faces a parade-ground.  Indian sentries march to and fro outside and enjoy thus serving their King, a picture of polish and smartness.  Facing the barracks is a smaller building called \"The Jockey Club\" where the Commander-in-Chief himself and many of his staff meet to lunch or dine, play billiards, or chat pleasantly over their liqueurs in English style.  \"What a pleasure it is to see our fellows in the streets so clean and well-behaved, with no interest except in football, and to compare them with the loafers you see everywhere,\" says General M.  \"One thing the British Empire can thank the Jews for,\" says Capt. C., \"is that they've ruined Russia.\"  \"What's the matter with the Russians,\" says stout Col. C., \"is that there's no punch in them; they're a helpless sort of people, from a general to a private soldier, it's all the same; they cannot cross a road unless you take them by the hand and lead them across.\"  \"What's the matter with Col. C. is that he warmed a seat in the War Office all the war,\" says Capt. T.  \"If he had ever faced a tenth of what the Russians have faced he'd talk to a different tune.\" \"What I dislike about them is that you see the rich ones doing themselves well in the restaurants whilst other poor beggars are starving outside,\" says another who does not like the Russians now. \"The French aristocrats went to their deaths with a smile,\" says another.  \"What do you think?  Oh, but you've got a soft spot in your heart for the Russians.\"  \"I have a golden rule.  I think it is in the worst of taste to say anything against a people who have suffered so much as the Russians.  And what should we be doing in their place--if the pride of England had been broken, and we also were all in exile eating the bread of strangers.  Should we present as brave a front?\" But how difficult it is to put oneself in another person's place in the imagination, and how unreadily it is done!  Still, loathing other nations is a favourite after-dinner occupation of English people, and need not be taken too seriously.  As a matter of actual behaviour, none in practice are kinder to the Russians than these same who speak against them.  Kindness goes a long way; practical common sense would go further.  Most of the Russians want permission to go to other parts of Europe.  The British command is theoretically in favour of letting the Russians go.  It is aware of the danger and distress of having a hundred thousand starving men and women on its hands.  But it cannot extricate itself from the tangle of international red-tape which smothers Constantinople.  On the other hand it actually allows thousands of new refugees to come in and make the situation worse.  The task of governing the city is so complicated"]]]
