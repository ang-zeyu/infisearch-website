I could get them later, I guess, but if you have any here I'd like to get a couple now because I want to give them to some one.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the secretary, in genial acquiescence; \"just a minute.\"  Tom went up in the elevator holding the two tickets in his hand. If his joy was darkened by any growing shadow of apprehension, he put the unpleasant thought away from him. He was too generous to harbor it; yet a feeling of uneasiness beset him.  As he entered the office, Margaret Ellison, smiled broadly.  \"You knew what it was?\" he said boldly.  \"Certainly I knew, and isn't it splendid!\"  \"I got two tickets,\" said Tom, \"for reserved seats down front. They're in the third row. I was going to give them to Roscoe and tell him to take--to ask you to go. But he's--he's late--I guess he stopped to register. So I'll give them to you, and when he comes up you can tell him about it.\"  \"I'll give them to him and say you asked me to.\"  \"All right,\" Tom said hesitatingly; \"then he'll ask you.\"  \"Perhaps.\"  She disappeared into the little inner office where Mr. Burton was waiting to dictate his mail, and Tom strolled over to the big window which overlooked Barrel Alley and gazed down upon that familiar, sordid place.  It was a long road from that squalid tenement down there to a place on the committee which was to receive the governor of the state. Over there to the left, next to Barrey's junk shop, was poor Ching Wo's laundry, into which Tom had hurled muddy barrel staves. And that brick house with the broken window was where \"Slats\" Corbett, former lieutenant of Tom's gang, had lived.  A big lump came up in his throat as he thought over the whole business now and of where the scout trail had brought him. Oh, he was happy!  The bright spring sunshine which poured in through the window on that wonderful morning, the flags which waved gayly here and there, seemed to reflect his own joy, and he was overwhelmed with the sense of triumph.  \"That was a good trail I hit, all right,\" he said to himself. He could not have said it out loud without his voice breaking.  One thing he wished in those few minutes of exultation. He wished that his mother might be there to see him on the stage, a conspicuous part of that patriotic demonstration, with the Gold Cross of the scouts upon his left breast. That would make the cup of joy overflow.  But since that could not be, the next best thing would be the knowledge that Margaret Ellison would be sitting there in the third row, looking ever so pretty, and would see him, and notice the Gold Cross and wonder what it meant.  \"I'm glad I never wore it to the office,\" he mused.  And Roscoe Bent, with all his sprightly manners and fine airs, would see where this good scout trail, which he had ridiculed, had brought Tom.  \"It's a bully--old--trail--it is,\" he said to himself; \"it's one good old trail, all right.\"  He took out his handkerchief and rubbed his eyes. Perhaps the bright sunlight was too strong for them.     CHAPTER V  THE MAIN TRAIL   But a trail is a funny thing. It is full of surprises and hard to follow. For one thing, you can never tell just where it is going to bring you out. There is the main trail and there are branch trails, and it is often puzzling to determine which is the main trail and which the branch.  Yet you must determine this somehow, for the one may lead you to food and shelter, to triumph and honor perhaps; while the other, which may be ever so clear and inviting, will lead you into bog and mire; so you have to be careful.  Of one thing you may be certain: there are not often two trails to the same place. You must pick one branch or the other. You must know where you want to go, and then hit the right trail. You must not be fooled by a side trail just because it happens to be broad and easy and pleasant. There are ways of telling which is the right trail, and you must learn those ways; otherwise you are not a good scout.  Upon the sleeve of Tom Slade's khaki jacket was seen the profile of an Indian. It was the scouts' merit badge for pathfinding. It meant that he knew every trail and byway for miles about Temple Camp. It meant that he had picked his way where there was no trail, through a dense and tangled wilderness; that he had found his way by night to a deserted hunting shack on the summit of a lonely wooded mountain in the neighborhood of Temple Camp and that he had later blazed a trail to that isolated spot.  Even Rossie Bent had opened his eyes at Tom's simple, unboastful narrative of this exploit, and had followed Tom's finger on the office map as he traced that blazed trail from the wood's edge near the camp up through the forest and along the brook to the very summit of the frowning height, from which the nickering lights of Temple Camp could be seen in the distance.  \"I'll bet not many people go up there,\" Roscoe had said.  So it was natural that when Tom looked back and thought of his career as a scout, of his rise from squalor and vicious mischief to this level of manliness and deserved honor, he should think of it as a trail--a good scout trail which he had picked up and followed. Down there in the mud of Barrel Alley it had begun, and see where it had led! To the platform of the Bridgeboro Lyceum where he, Tom Slade, would wear his Gold Cross, which every citizen at that patriotic Registration Day celebration might see, and would represent the First Bridgeboro Troop, B. S. A. in the town's welcome to the governor!  Oh, he was happy!  \"It's good I didn't listen to Slats Corbett and Sweet Caporal,\" he mused. \"I hit the right trail, all right. I bet if----\"  The door opened suddenly, and Mr. Brown from the bank entered with another gentleman, who appeared greatly disturbed.  \"Has Rossie Bent been up here to-day?\" Mr. Brown asked.  \"No, sir,\" said Tom. He felt his own voice tremble a little, and he realized that something was wrong.  \"This is Mr. Bent,\" said Mr. Brown, \"Roscoe's father. Roscoe hasn't been seen since last night, and his father is rather concerned about him.\"  \"You haven't seen him--to-day?\" Mr. Bent asked anxiously.  \"No, sir,\" said Tom.  The two men looked soberly at each other, and Tom went over to the door of the private office, which stood ajar, and quietly closed it.  \"Mr. Burton is busy,\" he said.  \"We might ask him,\" Mr. Brown suggested.  For the space of a few seconds Tom stood uneasily trying to muster the courage to speak.  \"It--it wouldn't be any good to let a lot of people know,\" he said hesitatingly, but looking straight at Roscoe's father. \"Mr. Burton only got here a few minutes ago, and he couldn't tell anything.--If you spoke to him, Miss Ellison would know about it too.\"  He spoke with great difficulty and not without a tremor in his voice, but his meaning reached the troubled father, who nodded as if he understood.  \"It's early yet,\" Tom ventured; \"maybe he'll think it over, kind of, and--and----\"  \"Thank you, my boy,\" said Mr. Bent soberly.  The two men stood a moment, as if not knowing what to do next. Then they left, and Tom remained standing just where he was. Of course, he was not surprised, only shocked.  \"I knew it all the time,\" he said to himself, \"only I wouldn't admit it.\"  He had been too generous to face the ugly fact. To him, who wished to go to war, the very thought of slacking and cowardice seemed preposterous--impossible.  \"I was just kidding myself,\" he said, with his usual blunt honesty, but with a wistful note of disappointment. \"There's no use trying to kid yourself--there ain't.\"  Mr. Burton came out with his usual smiling briskness and greeted Tom pleasantly. \"Congratulations, Tommy,\" said he. \"I suppose I'll see you among the big guns to-night. You leaving soon?\"  \"Y-yes, sir, in a few minutes.\"  \"Miss Ellison and I are so unpatriotic that we're going to work till the parade begins this afternoon.\"  \"I don't suppose he'll even _notice_ us to-morrow,\" teased the girl, \"he'll be so proud.\"  Tom smiled uncomfortably and wandered over to the window where, but a few minutes before, he had looked out with such pride and happiness. He did not feel very happy now.  Close by him was a table on which were strewn photographs of Temple Camp and the adjacent lake, a few birch bark ornaments, carved canes, and other specimens of handiwork which scouts had made there. There was also a large portfolio with plans of the cabins and pavilion and rough charts and diagrams of the locality.  Tom had shown this portfolio to many callers--scoutmasters and parents of scouts--who had come to make inquiries about the woodland community. He had shown it to Roscoe Bent only the day before and, as we know, he had been greatly pleased at the lively interest which that worldly young gentleman had shown.  He opened the portfolio idly now, and as he did so his gaze fell upon the map which showed the wooded hill and the position of the lonesome shack upon its summit. He called to mind with what pride he had traced his own blazed path up through the forest and how Roscoe had followed him, plying him with questions.  Then, suddenly, like a bolt out of the sky, there flashed into Tom's mind a suspicion which, but for his generous, unsuspecting nature, he might have had before. Was _that_ why Roscoe Bent had been so interested in the little hunting shack on the mountain? Was _that_ why he had asked if any one ever went up there; why he had inquired if there were fish to be caught in the brook and game to be hunted in the neighborhood? Was that why he had been so particular about the blazed path, and whether there was a fireplace in or near the shack? Had he been thinking of it as a safe refuge, a place of concealment for a person who had shirked his duty?  \"He could never"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20986"],["title","Tom Slade with the Colors (#5)"],["body","there,\" said Tom; \"he could never even _get_ there.\"  As the certainty grew in his mind, he was a little chagrined at his own credibility, but he was more ashamed for Roscoe.  \"I might have known,\" he said, \"that he wasn't really interested in camping.... He's a fool to think he can do that.\"  To Tom, who longed to go to war and who was deterred only by his promise to Mr. Ellsworth, the extremity that Roscoe had evidently gone to in the effort to escape service seemed unbelievable. But that was his game, and Tom saw the whole thing now as plain as day. It made him almost sick to think of it. While he, Tom, would be handing badges to the throng of proud and lucky young men just fresh from registering, while he sat upon the platform and listened to the music and the speeches in their honor, Roscoe Bent would be tracing his lonely way up that distant mountain with the insane notion of camping there. He would try to cheat the government and disgrace his family.  \"I don't see how he could do that--I don't,\" said Tom. \"I wonder what his father would say if he knew.--I wonder what Miss Ellison would say. I wonder what his mother would think.\"  He looked down again into Barrel Alley, and fixed his eyes upon the tenement where he and his poor mother and his wretched father had lived. But he was not thinking of his mother now--he was thinking of Roscoe Bent's mother and of his troubled father, going from place to place and searching in vain for his fugitive son.  \"If I told him,\" thought Tom, \"it would queer Roscoe. It wouldn't do for anybody to know.... I just got to go and bring him back.... Maybe they'd let him register to-morrow. He could say--he could say anything he wanted to about why he was away on the fifth of June. If he comes back they'll let him register, but if he doesn't they'll find him; they'll put his name in newspapers and lists and they'll find him. I just got to go and bring him back. And I got to go without telling anybody anything, too.\"  For a few moments longer he stood gazing out of the window down into that muddy alley where the good scout trail to honor and achievement had begun for him. For a few moments he thought of where it had brought him and of the joy and fulfillment which awaited him this very night. He wondered what people would say if he were not there. Well, in any event, they would not call him a slacker or a coward. He felt that there was no danger of being misjudged if he did his highest duty.  \"It's kind of like a branch trail I got to follow,\" he said, his voice breaking a little. \"I said it was a good trail, but now I see there's a branch trail that goes off, kind of, and I got to follow that....\"  But, of course, it wasn't a branch trail at all--it was the main trail, the true scout trail, which, forgetting all else, he was resolved to follow.     CHAPTER VI  TOM AND THE GOLD CROSS   Mr. Ellsworth was right when he said that Tom had a way of doping things out for himself. He had picked up scouting without much help, and he seldom asked advice.  His duty was very clear to him now. As long as no one but himself and Roscoe knew about this miserable business, the mistake could be mended and no harm come of it.  The thing was so important that the smaller evil of neglecting his allotted task and foregoing the honors which awaited him did not press upon him at all. He was disappointed, of course, but he acknowledged no obligation to anybody now except to Roscoe Bent and those whom his disgrace would affect. Wrong or right, that is the way Tom's mind worked.  Quietly he took his hat and went out, softly closing the door behind him. For a second or two he waited in the hall. He could still hear the muffled sound of the typewriter machine in the office.  As he went down in the elevator he heard two gentlemen talking about the celebration that evening and about the governor's coming. Tom listened wistfully to their conversation.  He had already taken from his pocket (what he always carried as his heart's dearest treasure) a dilapidated bank book. He intended to draw ten dollars from his savings account, which would be enough to get him to Catskill Landing, the nearest railroad point to camp, and to pay the return fare for himself and Roscoe.  But the bank was closed and Tom was confronted by a large placard in the big glass doors:      CLOSED IN HONOR OF OUR BOYS.      DON'T FORGET THE PATRIOTIC RALLY TO-NIGHT.     DO YOUR BIT!      YOU CAN CHEER IF YOU CAN'T REGISTER.  He had forgotten that the bank was to close early. Besides spoiling his plan, it reminded him that the town was turning out in gala fashion, and his thoughts turned again to the celebration in the evening.  \"I gotta keep in the right trail,\" he said doggedly, as he turned toward home.  He did not know what to do now, for he had less than a dollar in his pocket, and he was stubbornly resolved to take no one into his confidence. If he had the money, he could catch a train before noontime and reach the mountain by the middle of the afternoon. He would make a short cut from the railroad and not go up through Leeds or to Temple Camp at all.  As he walked along he noticed that the street was gay with bunting. In almost every shop window was a placard similar to the one in the bank. A large banner suspended across the street read:      DON'T FORGET THE RALLY     IN HONOR OF OUR BOYS     TO-NIGHT!  \"I ain't likely to forget it,\" he muttered.  He wondered how Roscoe's father felt when he saw that banner and this thought strengthened his determination so that he ignored the patriotic reminders all about him, and plodded stolidly along, his square face set in a kind of sullen frown.  \"It's being--with the Colors, just the same,\" he said, \"only in another kind of way--sort of.\"  As he turned into West Street he noticed on the big bulletin board outside the Methodist Church the words:      THE GOVERNOR WILL BE ON THE PLATFORM     OUR BOYS WILL BE IN THE TRENCHES     THE BOY SCOUTS ARE ON THE JOB     AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT!  \"They're a live bunch, that Methodist Troop, all right,\" commented Tom.  He raised his hand and gently lifted aside a great flag which hung so low over the sidewalk that he could not walk under it without stooping.  \"Just the same, I can say I'm with the Colors,\" he repeated. \"You can be with them even if--even if they ain't around----\"  He had evidently hit on some plan, for he walked briskly now through Culver Street, his lips set tight, making his big mouth seem bigger still.  He entered the house quietly and went up to the little room which he occupied. It was very small, with a single iron bed, a chair, a walnut bureau, and a little table whereon lay his Scout Manual and the few books which he owned. Outside the window, on its pine stick, hung a stiff muslin flag which he had bought.  He unlocked the top bureau drawer and took out a tin lock-box. This box was his pride, and whenever he took it out he felt like a millionaire. He had gazed at it in the window of a stationery store for many weeks and then, one Saturday, he had gone in and bought it for a dollar and a half.  He sat on the edge of his bed now, with the box on his knees, and rummaged among its contents. There was the pocket flashlight his patrol had given him; there was the scout jack-knife which had been a present from Roy's sister; an Indian arrow-head that Jeb Rushmore had found; a memorandum of the birthday of his patrol, and the birthdays of its members, and a clipping from a local paper describing how Tom Slade had saved a scout's life at Temple Camp and won the Gold Cross.  From the bottom of this treasure chest he lifted out a plush box which he rubbed on his knee to get the dust off, and then opened it slowly, carefully. He never tired of doing this.  As he lifted the cover the sunlight poured down out of the blue, cloudless sky of that perfect day, streaming cheerily into the plain little room which was all the home Tom had, and fell upon the glittering medal, making it shine with a dazzling brightness.  Often when Tom read of the Iron Cross being awarded to a submarine commander, or a German spy, or a Zeppelin captain for some unspeakable deed, he would come home and look at his own precious Gold Cross of the Scouts and think what it meant--heroism, _real_ heroism; bravery untainted; courage without any brutal motive; the courage that saves, not destroys.  He breathed upon the rich gold now (though it needed no polishing) and rubbed it with his handkerchief. Then he sat looking at it long and steadily. There, shining under his eyes, was the familiar design, the three-pointed sign of the scouts, with the American eagle superimposed upon it, as if Uncle Sam and the scouts were in close partnership.  Tom remembered that the Handbook, in describing the scout sign, referred to it as neither an arrow-head nor a fleur-de-lis, though resembling both, but as a modified form of the sign of the north on the mariner's compass.  \"Maybe it's like a fleur-de-lis, so as to remind us of France, kind of,\" Tom said, as he rubbed the medal again, \"and----\"  Suddenly a thought flashed into his mind. \"And it's pointing to the north, too! It's the compass sign of the north, and it tells me where to go, 'cause Temple Camp and that hill are north from here.... Gee, that's funny, when you come to think of it, how that Gold Cross can kind of remind you--of everything.... Now I know I _got_ to do it.... Nobody could tell me what I ought to do, 'cause the Gold Cross has told me.... And it'll help me to ... it will....\"     CHAPTER VII  THE TRAIL RUNS THROUGH A PESTILENT PLACE   If Tom had entertained any lingering misgivings as to his path of duty, he cast them from him now. If he had harbored any doubts as to his success, he banished them. Uncle Sam, poor bleeding, gallant France, and the voice of the scout, had all spoken to him out of the face of the wonderful Gold Cross, and he wanted no better authority than this for something which he must do in order to "]]]
