Hearing that tiny voice, which seemed to come from inside the fallen tree, Sandy Chipmunk was so startled that he leaped high into the air; and when he came down again upon all fours he found himself staring straight into Daddy Longlegs' beady eyes.  \"Oh! It's you, eh?\" cried Sandy Chipmunk. And he looked decidedly foolish, because he knew that he had no reason to fear anybody as mild as Daddy Longlegs.  \"It's a bad day, isn't it!\" said Daddy Longlegs once more.  \"I'm sorry I can't agree with you,\" Sandy replied. \"I think it's the finest weather that ever was.\"  \"You don't mean to say you like this wind?\" Daddy Longlegs cried. \"Why, I don't see how you dare to be out in it!\"  \"Oh, it's nothing when you're used to it,\" Sandy Chipmunk answered lightly.  \"I shall never get used to the wind, I'm afraid,\" Daddy told him sadly. \"It blows me about so terribly.\" And he went on to explain how he had started on a long journey the day before, and how he didn't dare go on--nor turn around and go home, either.  \"Well, well!\" Sandy Chipmunk exclaimed. \"You seem to be in a fix. But why don't you _ride_ home?\"  \"Ride?\" Daddy Longlegs shrilled. \"On what, I should like to know?\"  \"On Farmer Green's wagon!\" Sandy told him promptly. \"I happen to know that Johnnie Green and his grandmother drove to the miller's this morning to have a sack of wheat ground into flour. And they'll be coming back home this afternoon.\"     XIII  A DANGEROUS BUSINESS   SANDY CHIPMUNK did not tell Daddy Longlegs how he had been tied up in the sack of wheat and had had a ride in the wagon himself. He did not like riding in wagons. And he had been so glad to escape from the sack and jump into the bushes by the roadside that he had stopped to dance on Daddy's tree before scampering back home.  His suggestion took Daddy Longlegs by surprise. At first he felt a bit timid about riding in a wagon. But Sandy Chipmunk assured him it was not half as bad as it was said to be.  \"Is it far to the road?\" Daddy asked him.  \"Not if you hurry,\" Sandy told him. \"If you start now you surely ought to be able to reach the road by the time old Ebenezer passes this field.\"  \"Ebenezer! Who's he?\" Daddy inquired.  \"Oh! He's the horse that draws the wagon you're going to ride in,\" Sandy Chipmunk explained.  Daddy Longlegs thought deeply for a few minutes--or as deeply as anybody could who had so small a head as he. And then he said:  \"I'll try your plan, for I want to go home. But it's very dangerous for me to do so much walking on such a windy day as this.\"  \"Come on!\" cried Sandy. \"I'll show you the way to the road.\" And having started Daddy in the right direction, he hastened off to the road himself, to wait for the wagon.  Sandy waited by the roadside for a long, long time. And while he was lingering there, Daddy Longlegs was battling with the wind and having hard work to keep his feet. But by hurrying along fences, and dodging behind bowlders and bushes and every other sort of shelter that he could find, Daddy managed to reach the roadside at last, where he arrived quite out of breath.  \"Hurrah!\" Sandy Chipmunk shouted, as soon as Daddy joined him. \"Here you are--and you're just in time! For there's the wagon rattling down the next hill. And old Ebenezer (that's the horse, please remember!) he'll climb this rise as fast as he can, because he's in a hurry to get home.\"  \"He can't be half as anxious to reach home as I am,\" Daddy Longlegs remarked. \"And if he doesn't go his fastest after I'm aboard the wagon I hope Johnnie Green will whip him hard.\"  \"Johnnie can't do that,\" said Sandy Chipmunk. \"His father won't let him have a whip.\"  \"Well, he could cut a switch, I should think!\" Daddy Longlegs exclaimed.  But Sandy shook his head.  \"Johnnie's grandmother wouldn't let him do that,\" he replied. \"But you don't need to worry. You'll get home soon enough.\"  Soon the two watchers saw the old horse Ebenezer come jogging up the road. And then Sandy Chipmunk said something that sent Daddy Longlegs into a flutter of excitement.  \"Here they come!\" cried Sandy. \"You'd better stand right in the middle of the road, so you'll be sure to stop them.\"  And the mere thought of doing such a dangerous thing as that made Daddy Longlegs turn quite pale.     XIV  ONE WAY TO STOP A HORSE   EVERY one of Daddy Longlegs' eight knees began to shake, when Sandy Chipmunk told him to stand in the middle of the road, in order to stop the old horse Ebenezer, who was pulling the wagon in which Johnnie Green and his grandmother were riding.  \"I can't do that!\" Daddy shrieked, shrinking away from the dusty road. \"I'm so small that they wouldn't see me and the first thing I'd know I'd be run over.... You'll have to stop the wagon for me--you're so much bigger than I am.\"  But Sandy Chipmunk said he didn't like to speak to Johnnie Green, on account of a little trouble he had had with Johnnie's father over a letter.  \"Can't you wave your tail at him?\" Daddy Longlegs besought him. \"That wouldn't be _speaking_ to him, you know. Wave your tail at Johnnie Green until he stops the horse; and then you can run away, if you want to. And while the horse is standing still I'll scramble into the wagon, without anybody seeing me.\"  Now, Sandy Chipmunk was a good-natured person. And he saw that unless the wagon was stopped, Daddy Longlegs was going to be terribly disappointed. So he told Daddy that he would do what he could to help him.  Then Sandy leaped nimbly to the edge of the watering-trough at one side of the road and began waving his tail backwards and forwards, like a flag.  \"That's right!\" Daddy Longlegs shouted approvingly. \"But I wish you'd wave a little harder. I'm afraid they won't see you.\"  So Sandy Chipmunk redoubled his efforts. And he wagged his tail so hard that before he knew what was happening he had lost his footing, slipped off the edge of the trough, and found himself floundering in the water.  Daddy Longlegs was watching the wagon so anxiously that he never noticed what was happening to his friend. But he observed that Johnnie Green began to laugh. And pointing toward the watering-trough Johnnie cried, \"Oh! look, Grandma--look!\"  The old horse Ebenezer, too, seemed interested in what was going on. Anyhow, he swerved to the right and walked straight up to the trough. And the wagon came to a halt.  That was Daddy Longlegs' chance. He hurried to one of the rear wheels. And in spite of the wind he clambered quickly up and hid himself in a corner of the wagon-box.  Meanwhile Sandy Chipmunk, spluttering and choking, managed to pull himself out of his unexpected bath and frisked out of sight among the sumacs that fringed the road.  \"Well, I stopped the wagon, anyhow!\" he said to himself as he scampered away.  And that was just where he was mistaken. The old horse Ebenezer wanted a drink. That was why he had paused at the trough. He thrust his muzzle deep into the cool spring-water and drank so long that Johnnie Green began to be worried, for fear he would burst.  But old Ebenezer wouldn't budge until he had drunk his fill. When he was ready (and not before) the wagon went rumbling up the road again, taking Johnnie Green and his grandmother home to the farmhouse--and likewise bearing Daddy Longlegs back to the stone wall, where little Mr. Chippy lived in the wild grapevine.     XV  A CALL ON A NEIGHBOR   DADDY LONGLEGS was delighted to be at home again. And Mr. Chippy--as well as other neighbors--remarked that they had never seen him so happy and cheerful.  Perhaps one reason for Daddy's good spirits was the fact that the wind no longer blew and he could venture abroad without being buffeted about.  He was so relieved by the change in the weather that it seemed to him there could be no danger anywhere.  Little did Daddy Longlegs dream that a great army was even then making plans to capture him. And still less did he imagine that he was going to meet with a real adventure before the day was done.  Daddy Longlegs had so many pleasant ideas in his head that there was no room in it for any thought of danger. He had found that his neighbors considered him a hero, because he had ridden in Farmer Green's wagon. A good many of Daddy's friends rushed at once to the stone wall, to talk with him--as soon as they heard the news. And naturally he began to feel quite important.  \"Weren't you frightened?\" people asked him. \"Weren't you afraid that the horse would run away?\"  \"Oh, no! I wasn't the least bit scared, though I admit it was a dangerous feat,\" Daddy Longlegs told them. Then he would strut and swagger about, trying to appear as if there wasn't a braver person than he in all Pleasant Valley. And he talked about his wild ride to everybody that would listen to him.  At first Daddy's friends enjoyed hearing about his adventure. But he boasted so much about his bravery that his listeners soon grew tired of hearing him talk. And instead of his having many callers, it was not long before Daddy Longlegs found that nobody came near him, even to say howdy-do.  He endured his loneliness as long as he could, though he found it hard not to talk when he had so much to say. And feeling, at last, that he was in danger of choking over the babble that surged up from within him, Daddy Longlegs decided that he would go and call on Rusty Wren, who lived in the cherry tree near Farmer Green's bedroom window.  \"Rusty will be glad to know of my ride in the wagon,\" Daddy thought. \"And besides, I'd like to hear about his cousin's party, which I missed on account of the big wind.\" So off Daddy Longlegs started, the moment the idea popped into his head. He was the least bit uneasy, perhaps, for fear Rusty Wren might not be at home, in which case he would have nobody to talk to except Rusty's wife. And everybody knew that she was a person of uncertain temper.  But Daddy found Rusty perched on the tin roof of his house (his house was made of a maple-syrup can). And the first thing that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21426"],["title","The Tale of Daddy Longlegs (#5)"],["body","Longlegs said to him was this: \"Is your wife at home?\"  That may seem a strange question. But Rusty Wren appeared to know what his caller meant. Anyhow, Rusty said, \"No!\" in such a cheerful tone that Daddy Longlegs knew they could have a good chat without being disturbed.     XVI  BOASTFUL TALK   \"I SUPPOSE you've heard of my great adventure?\" Daddy Longlegs began, as soon as he learned that Rusty Wren was alone--that is, alone except for his six growing children inside the house. \"No doubt you know all about my daring deed?\"  \"Why, no!\" Rusty Wren replied, looking at his caller with no little wonder--for he had always believed Daddy Longlegs to be one of the mildest and most timid of all the field-people. \"What have you been doing?\" Rusty asked.  \"Something that you've never done!\" Daddy Longlegs told him proudly. \"I took a ride in Farmer Green's wagon yesterday, after the old horse Ebenezer!\"  \"Yes! yes! Go on!\" Rusty urged him. \"What happened to you?\"  \"What happened to me!\" cried Daddy Longlegs. \"I should think that _riding in a wagon_ was adventure enough for anyone, without any other sort of danger added to it.\"  But Rusty Wren didn't agree with him.  \"Riding in a wagon is nothing,\" he declared. \"Farmer Green rides in one almost every day. And as for it's being dangerous, there's only the danger that you'll be late arriving at the place where you're going--especially if you have to depend on old Ebenezer to take you. He's several thousand times my size; yet I can fly further in a day than he can trot in two weeks.\"  Well, Rusty's scoffing remarks made Daddy Longlegs quite peevish. He had come to Rusty's house in order to boast. And of course he was disappointed when he found that Rusty Wren did not think him a hero at all.  \"We'll say no more about the matter,\" Daddy observed stiffly. \"I can see that you are jealous. And I always make it a rule not to dispute with jealous people.\"  Rusty Wren couldn't help feeling somewhat ashamed. He realized that perhaps he had not been very polite to his caller. \"I meant no harm,\" he ventured \"And if you want to change the subject, I've no objection.\"  \"Very well!\" Daddy Longlegs replied. \"Let's talk about your cousin's party at Black Creek. I was sorry not to be present at it. But the high wind prevented me from travelling that day.\"  Then it was Rusty Wren's turn to look disappointed.  \"There wasn't any party,\" he said. \"Old Mr. Crow was mistaken. My cousin's party took place exactly a year earlier. So Mr. Crow was twelve months late with his news.\"  When he heard that, Daddy Longlegs couldn't help laughing right in Rusty Wren's face.  \"I don't see any joke,\" Rusty snapped. \"I can tell you that it's a good deal of a disappointment to have your mind all made up for a party, and then find that there is none.\"  \"Perhaps you're right,\" said Daddy Longlegs. \"Anyhow, I'm glad now that there was a wind that day, because the wind prevented my walking all the way to Black Creek for nothing.\"  \"Well, there's no wind now to keep you from walking anywhere you want to go,\" said Rusty Wren slyly. He hoped that Daddy Longlegs would take the hint--and leave, for he did not care to talk with him any longer. Besides, it was time for Rusty to feed his six growing children.  Soon, to Rusty's relief, Daddy Longlegs began to creep down the trunk of the cherry tree.  If he had known what was in store for him he might not have left just then.     XVII  DADDY IS ATTACKED   WHEN Daddy Longlegs went to call on Rusty Wren he did not know that a whole army had planned to capture him. But it was true, nevertheless, that a plot had been hatched against him. Now, right beneath the big old cherry tree where Rusty had his home there lived a colony of ants. And it was Rusty's habit--and his wife's, as well--to enjoy an occasional meal (or a light luncheon) by capturing and eating such ants as were not spry enough to keep out of harm's way.  Such actions only served to make the Wren family heartily disliked by every member of the ant colony. But there was nothing the ants could do except to try to be careful. And they were so angry that since they were powerless to harm the Wrens, they were quite ready and eager to vent their spite on Rusty's smaller friends.  That was the reason why they had determined to attack Daddy Longlegs at the very first opportunity.  Yes! The members of the ant colony had made up their minds to capture Daddy the next time he should visit Rusty Wren. And the ant army of fierce fighters was all prepared for a terrible battle. Each day sentinels took their posts and stayed on watch, ready to give the alarm the moment Daddy Longlegs came hobbling through the grass near the foot of the cherry tree.  And when, at last, Daddy fell into the trap, on the day that he visited Rusty to boast about his wagon ride, the news of his arrival spread like wildfire.  The ants had not said a word to Daddy as he passed their home and climbed up the cherry tree. They allowed him to go unharmed. But while he was high up in the tree chatting with Rusty Wren, ants hurried back to their stronghold from every direction. And in a surprisingly short time the whole army was ready and waiting--waiting for Daddy Longlegs to descend to the ground.  When he had finished his call, Daddy Longlegs left the cherry tree and started homeward. But he had not gone more than a few inches when the ant army sprang out of the ground as if by magic.  The soldiers were all around Daddy before he realized what was happening. And then he saw that it was too late for him to turn back and try to escape by climbing the tree again.  Being a timid person, he took fright at once. And looking up toward Rusty Wren's house he cried, \"Help! help!\" in a terror-stricken voice.  But Daddy's shrieks brought no answer. Rusty Wren had flown away to find food for his hungry children. The ant sentinels had seen him leave. And they knew that they had nothing to fear from that quarter.  As the army closed in around him, Daddy Longlegs thought that he had never been in such danger in all his life before. The army was so near him that he could have seen the whites of the soldier's eyes--if they had had any whites.     XVIII  THE ANT ARMY   URGED on by their leaders, the ant soldiers dashed upon meek, frightened Daddy Longlegs. On all sides they crowded about him. And as he looked down at his swarming enemies and saw how fiercely they rushed at him, his knees began to tremble just as they did when a strong wind was blowing.  Poor Daddy stood helplessly waiting for the worst to happen. He expected any moment to feel himself pulled down and thrown upon the ground. But strange to say, in spite of the uproar and the mad charge of Daddy's enemies, nothing of the kind occurred. Soon it became clear that the ant army was in some sort of trouble. Although the leaders drove the soldiers at Daddy Longlegs with frantic cries, the army merely surged backwards and forwards around him.  And Daddy had not received as much as a slap on the wrist from a single one of the attacking party.  Seeing that his forces were making no headway against the enemy, General Antenna, who commanded the entire army, called to one of the captains.  \"What's the trouble, Captain Kidd?\" the General demanded. \"Our soldiers don't seem to be doing any damage.\"  Of course, you must click your heels together when a General speaks to you. And naturally that took Captain Kidd some time to do, because it is no easy matter to click your heels together when you have six feet.  Perhaps it was only to be expected that General Antenna should quickly become impatient.  \"Why don't you answer?\" the General shouted. \"We'll lose the battle if we're not careful!\"  Then Captain Kidd had to stop and salute the General. And that took time, too. For how could anyone touch his cap when he had lost it somewhere?  Luckily, General Antenna soon saw what was the matter, and said:  \"Here--take my cap!\" And the General promptly clapped a gold-braided cap upon the Captain's head.  Then Captain Kidd was able to salute. And after that--and not before--the brave officer was ready to answer the General's inquiry.  Yes! Captain Kidd was all ready to reply. But by that time the Captain had quite forgotten what the question was.  Fortunately, General Antenna remembered--and repeated--it.  \"What's the trouble?\"  \"Oh, yes!\" said the Captain. \"The trouble is this: Our soldiers can't reach the enemy. Daddy Longlegs is so tall that they can't touch anything except his feet!\"  Taking a careful look at the battle-field, the General saw that it was so. But still the commander of the army was not dismayed.  \"Can't you tip him over?\"  \"We've tried to already,\" replied Captain Kidd. \"But he has too many legs for us.\"  \"Can't your soldiers stand on one another's shoulders?\"  \"It's no use,\" the Captain answered. \"We've tried that too.\"  General Antenna began to look somewhat worried, knowing that if the army couldn't win the battle before Rusty Wren came home, all would be lost. For no army of ants could stand and fight such a monster as he.  \"I have it!\" the General cried at last. \"I've thought of the very thing.... Bring some stepladders!\"     XIX  DADDY ESCAPES   THAT was a fine idea of General Antenna's--that plan of bringing stepladders, so that the ant army might climb up on them and reach Daddy Longlegs, whom they were attacking.  And Captain Kidd told the General on the spot that it was a most happy thought.  \"Then do as I tell you, at once!\" the General ordered pompously.  \"I can't!\" said Captain Kidd, who was terribly frightened, because the General was sure to be angry.  \"_Can't!_\" cried General Antenna fiercely. \"_Can't!_ What do you mean, madam?\" (Perhaps you did not know that Captain Kidd was a lady, as were also the General and the whole army, too!)  Captain Kidd's voice broke as she stammered an answer to General Antenna's rude demand.  \"I know of only one stepladder in Pleasant Valley,\" she explained. \"It belongs "]]]
