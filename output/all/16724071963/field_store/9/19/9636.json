I forgot all about its contents being perused, and was actually betrayed into shedding a few tears at the thought of my dear absent protectress.  \"I wish I was back with you,\" I wrote.  \"It's _miserable_ here.  The sweets you gave me have been stolen by that horrid old--\"  At this interesting juncture I was conscious of somebody standing behind me and looking over my shoulder.  It was Miss Henniker!  \"Give me that,\" she said.  I snatched the letter up and tore it into pieces.  I could stand a good deal, as I have said, but even a boy of twelve must draw the line somewhere.  Miss Henniker stood motionless as I destroyed my letter, and then said, in icy tones--  \"Follow me, Batchelor.\"  I rose meekly, and followed her--I cared not if it was to the gallows! She led me to her parlour, and ordered me to stand in the corner.  Then she rang her bell.  \"Tell Mr Ladislaw I should like to see him,\" said she to the servant.  In due time Mr Ladislaw appeared, and the case for the prosecution forthwith opened.  My misdemeanours for the entire day were narrated, culminating with this last heinous offence.  \"Batchelor,\" said Miss Henniker, \"repeat to Mr Ladislaw word for word what you were writing when I came to you.\"  I know not what spirit of meekness came over me.  I did as I was told, and repeated the sentence verbatim down to the words, \"The sweets you gave me have been stolen by that horrid old--\"  \"Old what?\" said Mr Ladislaw.  \"Old what?\" said Miss Henniker, I hesitated.  \"Come, now, say what you were going to write,\" demanded Mr Ladislaw.  \"Old what, Batchelor?\" reiterated the Henniker, keeping her eyes on me.  I must be honest!  \"Old beast,\" I said in a low tone.  \"I thought so,\" said the lady.  \"Batchelor has called me a beast twice since he came here, Mr Ladislaw.\"  \"Batchelor must be punished,\" said Mr Ladislaw, who, I could not help privately thinking, was a little afraid of Miss Henniker himself.  \"Come to my study, sir.\"  I came, followed of course by the Henniker; and in Mr Ladislaw's study I was caned on both hands.  Miss Henniker would, I fancy, have laid it on a little harder than the master did.  Still, it was enough to make me smart.  But the smart within was far worse than that without.  \"Return to the class-room now, and write at once to your uncle, Mr Jakeman,\" said Miss Henniker, \"and to no one else.\"  I returned to the room, where I found an eager whispered discussion going on.  When a boy was taken off for punishment by the Henniker, those who were left always had a brief opportunity for conversation.  The subject of discussion, I found, was Smith, who sat apart, with no paper before him, apparently exempt from the general task.  As usual, he was looking solemnly round him, but in no way to explain the mystery. At last Hawkesbury, the \"pet\" of the school--in other words, the only boy who seemed to get on with Miss Henniker and Mr Ladislaw--had walked up to Mr Hashford's desk, where the usher sat in temporary authority, and had said, \"Oh, Smith, the new boy, hasn't any paper, Mr Hashford.\"  \"No, I was told not to give him any,\" said the usher, terrified lest the Henniker should return.  \"I wonder why?\" said Hawkesbury.  \"Yes, it is strange,\" replied Mr Hashford; \"but please go to your place, Hawkesbury; Miss Henniker will return.\"  Hawkesbury had reported this brief conversation to his fellows, and this was what had given rise to the discussion I found going on when I returned from my caning.  It was soon cut short by the Henniker's reappearance; but the mystery became all the greater when it was seen that no notice was taken of the new boy's idleness, and that at the close of the exercise, when we were all called upon to bring up our letters, his name was distinctly omitted.  My effusion to my uncle was brief and to the point.  Dear Uncle Jakeman,--Miss Henniker wishes me to say that I have had five bad marks to-day.  I have also been caned hard on both hands for writing to dear Mrs Hudson, and for calling Miss Henniker bad names.  I hope you are very well.  Believe me, dear uncle, your affectionate nephew,--  Fred.  Batchelor.  With the exception of striking out the \"dear\" before Mrs Hudson this letter was allowed to pass.  In due time and to my great relief the bell rang for bed, and glad of any chance of forgetting the hateful place, I went up stairs to the dormitory.  The new boy, I found, was to occupy the bed next mine, at which I was rather pleased than otherwise.  I could not make out why I should take a fancy to Smith, but somehow I did; and when once during the night I happened to wake, and heard what sounded very much like a smothered sob in the bed next mine, I at least had the consolation of being sure I was not the only miserable boy at Stonebridge House.    CHAPTER FOUR.  HOW SMITH AND I TOOK A BREATH OF FRESH AIR AND PAID FOR IT.  As \"circumstances over which I had no control\" prevented my joining my fellow troublesome and backward boys in their daily retreat to the playground for the next few days, I had only a limited opportunity of seeing how the new boy settled down to his new surroundings.  Inside Stonebridge House we were all alike, all equally subdued and \"Henpecked.\"  The playground was really the only place where any display of character could be made; and as for three days I was a prisoner, Smith remained as much a mystery to me at the end of the week as he had been on the day of his arrival.  I could, however, guess from his looks and the looks of the others that he was having rather a bad time of it out there.  Hawkesbury used to come in with such a gracious smile every afternoon that I was certain something was wrong; and Philpot's flushed face, and Rathbone's scowl, and Flanagan's unusual gravity, all went to corroborate the suspicion. But Smith's face and manner were the most tell-tale.  The first day he had seemed a little doubtful, but gradually the lines of his mouth pulled tighter at the corners, and his eyes flashed oftener, and I could guess easily enough that he at least had not found his heart's content at Stonebridge House.  My term of penal servitude expired on Sunday; and in some respects I came out of it better than I had gone in.  For Mr Hashford had the charge of all detained boys, and he, good-hearted, Henniker-dreading usher that he was, had spent the three days in drilling me hard in decimal fractions; and so well too, that I actually came to enjoy the exercise, and looked upon the \"repeating dot\" as a positive pastime. Even Miss Henniker could not rob me of that pleasure.  \"Batchelor,\" whispered Flanagan to me, as we walked two and two to church behind the Henniker that Sunday, \"that new fellow's an awfully queer cove.  I can't make him out.\"  \"Nor can I.  But how's he been getting on the last day or two?\"  \"Getting on!  You never knew such scenes as we've had.  He's afraid of nobody.  He licked Philpot to fits on Thursday--smashed him, I tell you. You never saw such a demon as he is when his dander's up.  Then he walked into Rathbone; and if Rathbone hadn't been a foot taller than him, with arms as long as windmills, he'd have smashed Rathbone.\"  \"Did he try it on you?\"  I inquired.  \"No--why should he?\" said the sturdy Flanagan; \"time enough for that when I make a brute of myself to him.  But I dare say he'd smash me too. It's as good as a play, I tell you.  That time he did for Philpot he was as quick with his right, and walked in under his man's guard, and drove up at him, and took him on the flank just like--\"  \"A bad mark to Flanagan for talking, and to Batchelor for listening,\" rose the voice of Miss Henniker in the street.  This public award made us both jump, and colour up too, for there were a lot of ladies and gentlemen and young ladies close at hand, all of whom must have distinctly heard the Henniker's genial observation.  However, I was most curious to hear more of Smith.  Flanagan and I both had colds the rest of the way and finished our conversation behind our handkerchiefs.  \"Have you heard any more about him?\" asked I.  \"Not a word.  He's as close as an owl.  Hawkesbury says Hashford told him he came here straight from another school.  By the way--keep your handkerchief up, man!--by the way, when I said he's afraid of no one, he _is_ afraid of Hawkesbury, I fancy.  I don't know why--\"  \"I don't think I like Hawkesbury, either.  He's got such an everlasting grin.\"  \"So will you have if you don't talk lower, you young idiot,\" said Flanagan.  \"Yes, it's the grin that fetches Smith, I fancy.  I grinned at him one day, meaning to be friendly, but he didn't half like it.\"  I laughed at this, greatly to Flanagan's wrath.  Luckily, however, no evil consequences happened, and we reached church without any more bad marks.  Of all days, Sunday at Stonebridge House was the most miserable and desperate.  We had not even the occupation of lessons, still less the escape to the playground.  After church, we were marched back to the school, and there set to read some dry task book till dinner.  And after dinner we were set to copy out a chapter of Jeremiah or some other equally suitable passage from beginning to end on ruled paper, getting bad marks as on week days for all faults.  After this came tea, and after tea another dreary march forth to church.  But the culminating horror of the day was yet to come.  After evening church--and there really was a sense of escape and peace in the old church, even though we could not make out the sermon--after evening church, we were all taken up to Miss Henniker's parlour, and there doomed to sit perfectly still for a whole hour, while she read aloud something by one of the very old masters.  Oh, the agony of those Sunday evenings!  I have sat fascinated by that awful voice, with a cramp in my leg that I dared not stir to relieve, or a tickling in the small of my back from which there was no escape, or a cobweb on my face I had not the courage to brush away.  I have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],["title","My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#6)"],["body","sleep taking possession of me, yet daring neither to yawn, nor nod my head, nor wink my eyes.  I have stared fixedly at the gas, or the old china ornament on the mantelpiece, till my eyes became watery with the effort and I have suffered all the tortures of a cold in the head without the possibility either of sniffing or clearing my throat!  It made no difference to Miss Henniker that she was reading aloud.  She had her eye on every one of us the whole time, nay, more than ever; and many a bad mark was sprinkled up with her readings.  \"Once more, dearly beloved--Batchelor, a bad mark,\" became to me quite a familiar sound before I had been many Sundays at Stonebridge House.  This particular Sunday evening I thought I should go mad, at least, during the first part of the performance.  I _couldn't_ sit still, and the more I tried the more restless I became.  At last, however, some chance directed my eyes to where the new boy was sitting in a distant corner of the room, and from that moment, I can't tell why, I became a model of quiet sitting.  I found myself forgetting all about the cobwebs, and Mrs Hudson, and the china ornament, and the small of my back, and thinking of nothing but this solemn, queer boy, with his big eyes, and black hair, and troubled face.  The more I looked at him the more sorry I felt for him, and the more I wished to be his friend.  I would--  \"Batchelor, repeat the last words I read,\" broke in Miss Henniker.  She thought she had me, but no!  Far away as my thoughts had been, my ears had mechanically retained those last melodious strains, and I answered, promptly, \"Latitudinarianism of an unintelligent emotionalism!\"  One to me!  And I returned to my brown study triumphant, and pretty secure against further molestation.  I made up my mind, come what would, I would speak to the new boy and let him see _I_ was not against him.  Some one will smile, of course, and say, sarcastically, \"What a treat for the new boy!\"  But if he only knew with what fear and trembling I made that resolution, he would acquit Fred Batchelor of any very great self-importance in the matter.  Bedtime came at last, and, thankful to have the day over, we crawled away to our roosts.  The new boy's bed, as I have said, was next mine, and I conceived the determination, if I could only keep awake, of speaking to him after every one was asleep.  It was hard work that keeping awake; but I managed it.  Gradually, one after another dropped off, and the padding footsteps overhead and the voices below died away till nothing was heard but the angry tick of the clock outside and the regular breathing of the sleepers on every hand.  Then I softly slid out of bed and crawled on my hands and knees to Smith's bed.  It was an anxious moment for me.  He might be asleep, and wake up in a fright to find some one near him; or he might be awake and resent my intrusion.  Still I determined I _would_ go to him, and I was rewarded.  \"Is that Batchelor?\"  I heard him whisper as I approached his bed.  \"Yes,\" I answered, joyfully, and feeling half the battle over.  \"Come in,\" said he, moving to make room for me.  \"Oh no!\"  I said, in terror at the very idea.  \"Suppose I fell asleep. I'll kneel here, and then if any one comes I can crawl back.\"  \"What is it?\"  Smith said, presently, after a long and awkward pause.  I was thankful that he broke the ice.  \"Oh,\" I whispered, \"aren't you jolly miserable here, I say?\"  \"Pretty!\" said he.  \"Aren't you?\"  \"Oh, yes!  But the fellows are all so unkind to you.\"  Smith gave a little bitter laugh.  \"That doesn't matter,\" he said.  \"Doesn't it?  I wish I was bigger, I'd back you up--and so will Flanagan, if you let him.\"  \"Thanks, old man!\" said the new boy, putting his hand on my arm.  \"It's not the fellows I mind, it's--\" and here he pulled up.  \"Old Henniker,\" I put in, in accents of smothered rage.  \"Ugh!\" said Smith; \"she's awful!\"  But somehow it occurred to me the Henniker was not what Smith was going to say when he pulled up so suddenly just before.  I felt certain there was something mysterious about him, and of course, being a boy, I burned to know.  However, he showed no signs of getting back to that subject, and we talked about a lot of things, thankful to have scope for once for our pent-up feelings.  It was one of the happiest times I had known for years, as I knelt there on the hard carpetless floor and found my heart going out to the heart of a friend.  What we talked about was of little moment; it was probably merely about boys' trifles, such as any boy might tell another.  What was of moment was that there, in dreary, cheerless Stonebridge House, we had found some interest in common, and some object for our spiritless lives.  I told him all about home and my uncle, in hopes that he would be equally communicative, but here he disappointed me.  \"Are your father and mother dead too?\"  I said.  \"Not both,\" he replied.  It was spoken in a tone half nervous, half vexed, so I did not try to pursue the subject.  Presently he changed the subject and said, \"How do you like that fellow Hawkesbury?\"  \"Not much; though I don't know why.\"  Smith put out his hand and pulled my face close to his as he whispered, \"I hate him!\"  \"Has he been bullying you?\"  I inquired.  \"No,\" said Smith.  \"But he's--ugh--I don't know any more than you do why I hate him.  I say, shall you be out in the playground to-morrow?\"  \"Yes, unless I get four bad marks before.  I've two against me already.\"  \"Oh, don't get any more.  I want to go for a walk.\"  \"A walk!\"  I exclaimed.  \"You'll never be allowed!\"  \"But we might slip out just for a few minutes; it's awful never to get out.\"  It _was_ awful; but the risk.  However, I had promised to back him up, and so I said where he went I would go.  \"If it was only to climb one tree, or see just one bird on the bushes,\" he said, almost pathetically.  \"But I say, ain't you getting cold?\"  I was not, I protested, and for a long time more we continued talking. Then at last the creaking of a board, or the noise of a mouse, startled us in earnest, and in a moment I had darted back to my bed.  All was quiet again.  \"Good-night, old boy,\" I whispered.  \"Good-night, old man.  Awfully good of you,\" he replied.  \"I'll come to you to-morrow.\"  And not long after we were both sound asleep.  I managed to keep down my bad marks below four next day, so that I was able once more to take my walks abroad in the playground.  It was with a little feeling of misgiving that I sallied forth, for Smith was at my side, reminding me of our resolution to escape, if only for a few minutes, to the free country outside.  I would greatly have preferred not trying it, but Smith was set on it, and I had not the face to leave him in the lurch.  The far end of the playground, beyond the swings, broke into a patch of tangled thicket, beyond which again a little ditch separated the grounds of Stonebridge House from the country outside.  To this thicket, therefore, we wandered, after \"showing ourselves\" on the swings for a few minutes, for the sake of allaying suspicions.  The other fellows were most of them loafing about on the far side of the gravel yard, where the marble holes were; so we managed to make our escape pretty easily, and found ourselves at length standing on the breezy heath.  Once there, Smith's whole manner changed to one of wild delight.  The sense of freedom seemed to intoxicate him, and the infection seized me too.  We scampered about in a perfectly ridiculous manner; up hills and down hollows, leaping over bushes, chasing one another, and, in fact, behaving exactly like two kids (as we were), suddenly let loose from confinement.  \"I say,\" said I, all out of breath, \"suppose we run clean away, Smith?\"  Smith pulled up in the middle of a scamper, and looked up and down on every side.  Then the old solemn look came as he replied, \"Where to, that's it?\"  \"Oh, Brownstroke, if you like; or your home.  Let's turn up, you know, and give them a jolly surprise.\"  Smith's face clouded over as he said, hurriedly, \"I say, it's time to be going back, or we shall get caught.\"  This was an effectual damper to any idea of flight, and we quickly turned back once more to Stonebridge House.  We found our gap all right, and strolled back past the swings and up the gravel walk as unconcernedly as possible, fully believing no one had been witness of our escapade.  We were wrong.  Hawkesbury came up to us as we neared the house, with the usual smile on his face.  \"Didn't you hear me calling?\" he said.  \"You know it's against rules to go out of bounds, and I thought--\"  \"What! who's been out of bounds?\" said the voice of the Henniker at that moment.  Hawkesbury looked dejected.  \"Who did you say, Hawkesbury, had been out of bounds?\"  \"I'd rather not tell tales,\" said Hawkesbury, sweetly.  \"I've been out of bounds,\" blurted out Smith, \"and so has Batchelor.  I asked him to come, and Hawkesbury has been spying and--\"  \"Silence,\" cried Miss Henniker.  \"Smith and Batchelor, follow me.\"  We followed duly to Mr Ladislaw's study, where we were arraigned. Hawkesbury was sent for as evidence.  He came smiling, and declared he may have been mistaken, perhaps it was two other boys; he hoped we should not be punished, etcetera.  Smith was nearly breaking out once or twice during this, and it was all I could do to keep him in.  Hawkesbury was thanked and dismissed, and then, with the assistance of Miss Henniker, Mr Hashford, and Mr Ladislaw, Smith and I were birched, and forbidden the playground for a fortnight, during which period we were required to observe absolute silence.  So ended our little adventure out for a puff of free air!  Among our fellows we gained little enough sympathy for our misfortunes.  Flanagan was the only fellow who seemed really sorry.  The rest of the ill- conditioned lot saw in the affair only a good opportunity of crowing over their ill-starred adversary, and telling me it served me right for chumming up to"]]]
