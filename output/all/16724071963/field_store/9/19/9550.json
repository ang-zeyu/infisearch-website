I tell you what,\" said I: \"I'll come just to show you the ropes, and I won't take a pennyweight of the swag.\"  Such was the teasing fashion in which he invariably prevailed upon me; it was delightful to note how it caused him to yield in his turn. But Raffles had the grace to give in with a laugh, whereas I too often lost my temper with my point.  \"You little rabbit!\" he chuckled.  \"You shall have your share, whether you come or not; but, seriously, don't you think you might remember the girl?\"  \"What's the use?\" I groaned.  \"You agree there is nothing for it but to give her up.  I am glad to say that for myself before I asked you, and wrote to tell her so on Sunday.  Now it's Wednesday, and she hasn't answered by line or sign.  It's waiting for one word from her that's driving me mad.\"  \"Perhaps you wrote to Palace Gardens?\"  \"No, I sent it to the country.  There's been time for an answer, wherever she may be.\"  We had reached the Albany, and halted with one accord at the Piccadilly portico, red cigar to red cigar.  \"You wouldn't like to go and see if the answer's in your rooms?\" he asked.  \"No.  What's the good?  Where's the point in giving her up if I'm going to straighten out when it's too late?  It is too late, I have given her up, and I am coming with you!\"  The hand that bowled the most puzzling ball in England (once it found its length) descended on my shoulder with surprising promptitude.  \"Very well, Bunny!  That's finished; but your blood be on your own pate if evil comes of it.  Meanwhile we can't do better than turn in here till you have finished your cigar as it deserves, and topped up with such a cup of tea as you must learn to like if you hope to get on in your new profession.  And when the hours are small enough, Bunny, my boy, I don't mind admitting I shall be very glad to have you with me.\"  I have a vivid memory of the interim in his rooms.  I think it must have been the first and last of its kind that I was called upon to sustain with so much knowledge of what lay before me.  I passed the time with one restless eye upon the clock, and the other on the Tantalus which Raffles ruthlessly declined to unlock.  He admitted that it was like waiting with one's pads on; and in my slender experience of the game of which he was a world's master, that was an ordeal not to be endured without a general quaking of the inner man.  I was, on the other hand, all right when I got to the metaphorical wicket; and half the surprises that Raffles sprung on me were doubtless due to his early recognition of the fact.  On this occasion I fell swiftly and hopelessly out of love with the prospect I had so gratuitously embraced.  It was not only my repugnance to enter that house in that way, which grew upon my better judgment as the artificial enthusiasm of the evening evaporated from my veins. Strong as that repugnance became, I had an even stronger feeling that we were embarking on an important enterprise far too much upon the spur of the moment.  The latter qualm I had the temerity to confess to Raffles; nor have I often loved him more than when he freely admitted it to be the most natural feeling in the world.  He assured me, however, that he had had my Lady Lochmaben and her jewels in his mind for several months; he had sat behind them at first nights; and long ago determined what to take or to reject; in fine, he had only been waiting for those topographical details which it had been my chance privilege to supply.  I now learned that he had numerous houses in a similar state upon his list; something or other was wanting in each case in order to complete his plans.  In that of the Bond Street jeweller it was a trusty accomplice; in the present instance, a more intimate knowledge of the house.  And lastly, this was a Wednesday night, when the tired legislator gets early to his bed.  How I wish I could make the whole world see and hear him, and smell the smoke of his beloved Sullivan, as he took me into these, the secrets of his infamous trade!  Neither look nor language would betray the infamy. As a mere talker, I shall never listen to the like of Raffles on this side of the sod; and his talk was seldom garnished by an oath, never in my remembrance by the unclean word. Then he looked like a man who had dressed to dine out, not like one who had long since dined; for his curly hair, though longer that another's, was never untidy in its length; and these were the days when it was still as black as ink.  Nor were there many lines as yet upon the smooth and mobile face; and its frame was still that dear den of disorder and good taste, with the carved book-case, the dresser and chests of still older oak, and the Wattses and Rossettis hung anyhow on the walls.  It must have been one o'clock before we drove in a hansom as far as Kensington Church, instead of getting down at the gates of our private road to ruin.  Constitutionally shy of the direct approach, Raffles was further deterred by a ball in full swing at the Empress Rooms, whence potential witnesses were pouring between dances into the cool deserted street.  Instead he led me a little way up Church Street, and so through the narrow passage into Palace Gardens.  He knew the house as well as I did.  We made our first survey from the other side of the road.  And the house was not quite in darkness; there was a dim light over the door, a brighter one in the stables, which stood still farther back from the road.  \"That's a bit of a bore,\" said Raffles.  \"The ladies have been out somewhere--trust them to spoil the show!  They would get to bed before the stable folk, but insomnia is the curse of their sex and our profession.  Somebody's not home yet; that will be the son of the house; but he's a beauty, who may not come home at all.\"  \"Another Alick Carruthers,\" I murmured, recalling the one I liked least of all the household, as I remembered it.  \"They might be brothers,\" rejoined Raffles, who knew all the loose fish about town.  \"Well, I'm not sure that I shall want you after all, Bunny.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"If the front door's only on the latch, and you're right about the lock, I shall walk in as though I were the son of the house myself.\"  And he jingled the skeleton bunch that he carried on a chain as honest men carry their latchkeys.  \"You forget the inner doors and the safe.\"  \"True.  You might be useful to me there.  But I still don't like leading you in where it isn't absolutely necessary, Bunny.\"  \"Then let me lead you, I answered, and forthwith marched across the broad, secluded road, with the great houses standing back on either side in their ample gardens, as though the one opposite belonged to me. I thought Raffles had stayed behind, for I never heard him at my heels, yet there he was when I turned round at the gate.  \"I must teach you the step,\" he whispered, shaking his head.  \"You shouldn't use your heel at all.  Here's a grass border for you: walk it as you would the plank!  Gravel makes a noise, and flower-beds tell a tale.  Wait--I must carry you across this.\"  It was the sweep of the drive, and in the dim light from above the door, the soft gravel, ploughed into ridges by the night's wheels, threatened an alarm at every step.  Yet Raffles, with me in his arms, crossed the zone of peril softly as the pard.  \"Shoes in your pocket--that's the beauty of pumps!\" he whispered on the step; his light bunch tinkled faintly; a couple of keys he stooped and tried, with the touch of a humane dentist; the third let us into the porch.  And as we stood together on the mat, as he was gradually closing the door, a clock within chimed a half-hour in fashion so thrillingly familiar to me that I caught Raffles by the arm.  My half-hours of happiness had flown to just such chimes! I looked wildly about me in the dim light.  Hat-stand and oak settee belonged equally to my past.  And Raffles was smiling in my face as he held the door wide for my escape.  \"You told me a lie!\" I gasped in whispers.  \"I did nothing of the sort,\" he replied.  \"The furniture's the furniture of Hector Carruthers; but the house is the house of Lord Lochmaben.  Look here!\"  He had stooped, and was smoothing out the discarded envelope of a telegram.  \"Lord Lochmaben,\" I read in pencil by the dim light; and the case was plain to me on the spot.  My friends had let their house, furnished, as anybody but Raffles would have explained to me in the beginning.  \"All right,\" I said.  \"Shut the door.\"  And he not only shut it without a sound, but drew a bolt that might have been sheathed in rubber.  In another minute we were at work upon the study-door, I with the tiny lantern and the bottle of rock-oil, he with the brace and the largest bit.  The Yale lock he had given up at a glance.  It was placed high up in the door, feet above the handle, and the chain of holes with which Raffles had soon surrounded it were bored on a level with his eyes. Yet the clock in the hall chimed again, and two ringing strokes resounded through the silent house before we gained admittance to the room.  Raffle's next care was to muffle the bell on the shuttered window (with a silk handkerchief from the hat-stand) and to prepare an emergency exit by opening first the shutters and then the window itself.  Luckily it was a still night, and very little wind came in to embarrass us.  He then began operations on the safe, revealed by me behind its folding screen of books, while I stood sentry on the threshold.  I may have stood there for a dozen minutes, listening to the loud hall clock and to the gentle dentistry of Raffles in the mouth of the safe behind me, when a third sound thrilled my every nerve.  It was the equally cautious opening of a door in the gallery overhead.  I moistened my lips to whisper a word of warning to Raffles.  But his ears had been as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2098"],["title","A Thief in the Night: A Book of Raffles' Adventures (#2)"],["body","as mine, and something longer.  His lantern darkened as I turned my head; next moment I felt his breath upon the back of my neck.  It was now too late even for a whisper, and quite out of the question to close the mutilated door.  There we could only stand, I on the threshold, Raffles at my elbow, while one carrying a candle crept down the stairs.  The study-door was at right angles to the lowest flight, and just to the right of one alighting in the hall.  It was thus impossible for us to see who it was until the person was close abreast of us; but by the rustle of the gown we knew that it was one of the ladies, and dressed just as she had come from theatre or ball.  Insensibly I drew back as the candle swam into our field of vision: it had not traversed many inches when a hand was clapped firmly but silently across my mouth.  I could forgive Raffles for that, at any rate!  In another breath I should have cried aloud: for the girl with the candle, the girl in her ball-dress, at dead of night, the girl with the letter for the post, was the last girl on God's wide earth whom I should have chosen thus to encounter--a midnight intruder in the very house where I had been reluctantly received on her account!  I forgot Raffles.  I forgot the new and unforgivable grudge I had against him now.  I forgot his very hand across my mouth, even before he paid me the compliment of removing it.  There was the only girl in all the world: I had eyes and brains for no one and for nothing else. She had neither seen nor heard us, had looked neither to the right hand nor the left.  But a small oak table stood on the opposite side of the hall; it was to this table that she went.  On it was one of those boxes in which one puts one's letters for the post; and she stooped to read by her candle the times at which this box was cleared.  The loud clock ticked and ticked.  She was standing at her full height now, her candle on the table, her letter in both hands, and in her downcast face a sweet and pitiful perplexity that drew the tears to my eyes.  Through a film I saw her open the envelope so lately sealed and read her letter once more, as though she would have altered it a little at the last.  It was too late for that; but of a sudden she plucked a rose from her bosom, and was pressing it in with her letter when I groaned aloud.  How could I help it?  The letter was for me: of that I was as sure as though I had been looking over her shoulder.  She was as true as tempered steel; there were not two of us to whom she wrote and sent roses at dead of night.  It was her one chance of writing to me. None would know that she had written.  And she cared enough to soften the reproaches I had richly earned, with a red rose warm from her own warm heart.  And there, and there was I, a common thief who had broken in to steal!  Yet I was unaware that I had uttered a sound until she looked up, startled, and the hands behind me pinned me where I stood.  I think she must have seen us, even in the dim light of the solitary candle.  Yet not a sound escaped her as she peered courageously in our direction; neither did one of us move; but the hall clock went on and on, every tick like the beat of a drum to bring the house about our ears, until a minute must have passed as in some breathless dream.  And then came the awakening--with such a knocking and a ringing at the front door as brought all three of us to our senses on the spot.  \"The son of the house!\" whispered Raffles in my ear, as he dragged me back to the window he had left open for our escape.  But as he leaped out first a sharp cry stopped me at the sill.  \"Get back! Get back! We're trapped!\" he cried; and in the single second that I stood there, I saw him fell one officer to the ground, and dart across the lawn with another at his heels.  A third came running up to the window.  What could I do but double back into the house?  And there in the hall I met my lost love face to face.  Till that moment she had not recognized me.  I ran to catch her as she all but fell.  And my touch repelled her into life, so that she shook me off, and stood gasping: \"You, of all men!  You, of all men!\" until I could bear it no more, but broke again for the study-window. \"Not that way--not that way!\" she cried in an agony at that.  Her hands were upon me now.  \"In there, in there,\" she whispered, pointing and pulling me to a mere cupboard under the stairs, where hats and coats were hung; and it was she who shut the door on me with a sob.  Doors were already opening overhead, voices calling, voices answering, the alarm running like wildfire from room to room.  Soft feet pattered in the gallery and down the stairs about my very ears. I do not know what made me put on my own shoes as I heard them, but I think that I was ready and even longing to walk out and give myself up.  I need not say what and who it was that alone restrained me.  I heard her name.  I heard them crying to her as though she had fainted.  I recognized the detested voice of my _bête noir_, Alick Carruthers, thick as might be expected of the dissipated dog, yet daring to stutter out her name. And then I heard, without catching, her low reply; it was in answer to the somewhat stern questioning of quite another voice; and from what followed I knew that she had never fainted at all.  \"Upstairs, miss, did he?  Are you sure?\"  I did not hear her answer.  I conceive her as simply pointing up the stairs.  In any case, about my very ears once more, there now followed such a patter and tramp of bare and booted feet as renewed in me a base fear for my own skin.  But voices and feet passed over my head, went up and up, higher and higher; and I was wondering whether or not to make a dash for it, when one light pair came running down again, and in very despair I marched out to meet my preserver, looking as little as I could like the abject thing I felt.  \"Be quick!\" she cried in a harsh whisper, and pointed peremptorily to the porch.  But I stood stubbornly before her, my heart hardened by her hardness, and perversely indifferent to all else.  And as I stood I saw the letter she had written, in the hand with which she pointed, crushed into a ball.  \"Quickly!\" She stamped her foot.  \"Quickly--if you ever cared!\"  This in a whisper, without bitterness, without contempt, but with a sudden wild entreaty that breathed upon the dying embers of my poor manhood.  I drew myself together for the last time in her sight.  I turned, and left her as she wished--for her sake, not for mine.  And as I went I heard her tearing her letter into little pieces, and the little pieces falling on the floor.  Then I remembered Raffles, and could have killed him for what he had done.  Doubtless by this time he was safe and snug in the Albany: what did my fate matter to him?  Never mind; this should be the end between him and me as well; it was the end of everything, this dark night's work!  I would go and tell him so.  I would jump into a cab and drive there and then to his accursed rooms.  But first I must escape from the trap in which he had been so ready to leave me.  And on the very steps I drew back in despair.  They were searching the shrubberies between the drive and the road; a policeman's lantern kept flashing in and out among the laurels, while a young man in evening-clothes directed him from the gravel sweep.  It was this young man whom I must dodge, but at my first step in the gravel he wheeled round, and it was Raffles himself.  \"Hulloa!\" he cried.  \"So you've come up to join the dance as well! Had a look inside, have you?  You'll be better employed in helping to draw the cover in front here.  It's all right, officer--only another gentleman from the Empress Rooms.\"  And we made a brave show of assisting in the futile search, until the arrival of more police, and a broad hint from an irritable sergeant, gave us an excellent excuse for going off arm-in-arm. But it was Raffles who had thrust his arm through mine.  I shook him off as we left the scene of shame behind.  \"My dear Bunny!\" he exclaimed.  \"Do you know what brought me back?\"  I answered savagely that I neither knew nor cared.  \"I had the very devil of a squeak for it,\" he went on.  \"I did the hurdles over two or three garden-walls, but so did the flyer who was on my tracks, and he drove me back into the straight and down to High Street like any lamplighter.  If he had only had the breath to sing out it would have been all up with me then; as it was I pulled off my coat the moment I was round the corner, and took a ticket for it at the Empress Rooms.\"  \"I suppose you had one for the dance that was going on,\" I growled. Nor would it have been a coincidence for Raffles to have had a ticket for that or any other entertainment of the London season.  \"I never asked what the dance was,\" he returned.  \"I merely took the opportunity of revising my toilet, and getting rid of that rather distinctive overcoat, which I shall call for now.  They're not too particular at such stages of such proceedings, but I've no doubt I should have seen someone I knew if I had none right in.  I might even have had a turn, if only I had been less uneasy about you, Bunny.\"  \"It was like you to come back to help me out,\" said I.  \"But to lie to me, and to inveigle me with your lies into that house of all houses--that was not like you, Raffles--and I never shall forgive it or you!\"  Raffles took my arm again.  We were near the High Street gates of Palace Gardens, and I was too miserable to resist an advance which I meant never to give him an opportunity to repeat.  \"Come, come, Bunny, there wasn't much inveigling about it,\" said he. \"I did my level best to leave you behind, but you wouldn't listen to me.\"  \"If you had told me the truth I should have listened fast enough,\" I retorted.  \"But what's the use of talking?  You can boast of your own adventures after you bolted.  You don't care what happened to me.\"  \"I cared so much that I came back to see.\"  "]]]
