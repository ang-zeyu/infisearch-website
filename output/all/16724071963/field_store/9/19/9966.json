She was still gaining on us, and I observed at length that she had slightly altered her course, so as to be creeping up on our starboard quarter, though so slightly, that at first the alteration was not perceived.  Captain Magor took two or three short turns on the poop, then suddenly stopping, he shouted, \"In with the studding-sails, send down the royals,\" and presently afterwards, when this was done, \"Furl top-gallant-sails.\"  He had evidently made up his mind that escape was impossible, and was determined to fight the stranger should she prove an enemy.  Active as were our crew, some minutes passed before sail was shortened, by which time the stranger had crept up on our quarter.  She had hitherto kept all her canvas standing. We were still running before the wind.  I saw the captain give a steady look at her.  \"I know her now.  She is the `Vulture,' and we can expect no mercy if we are taken,\" he exclaimed, turning to Harry and me, his countenance exhibiting the anxiety he felt in the discovery, although the next moment he spoke in the same firm tone as usual.  \"The men stationed at the starboard guns be ready to fire,\" he cried out.  \"Brace the yards to larboard.\"  Before, however, the words were out of his mouth, the stranger's crew were seen swarming aloft.  The yards and tops were covered with men, and with a rapidity far excelling anything we were capable of, the studding-sails were taken in, the royals and top-gallant-sails furled, and just as our helm was put down, and we were about to luff across her bow, she luffed up and let fly a broadside of ten guns in return for our three.  At the same moment, as I looked aft, expecting still to see the ensign of Old England flying from her peak, I beheld a black piratical flag with the death's head and cross-bones, which had evidently been hoisted to strike terror into the hearts of our crew.  At that instant I heard the same crashing, rending sounds which had disturbed my slumbers, as the shot tore their way through our bulwarks, some striking the masts, others cutting away the shrouds and knocking a boat to pieces.  I saw one man fall at the after-guns, while two more were binding handkerchiefs round their arms, showing that they had been struck either by shot or splinters.  Having missed the opportunity of raking the enemy, we were now placed in a disadvantageous position to leeward. Still Captain Magor was not the man to give in.  He ordered \"Long Tom\" to be dragged from its present position, and run through the foremost port.  \"If the enemy have more guns than we have, we must make amends by firing ours twice as fast as she does,\" he cried out in a cheerful tone. \"Cheer up, my lads.  Toss the pieces in, and give the villains more than they bargain for.\"  Harry and I hastened to one of the guns, at which three of the crew had already been killed or disabled, and we exerted ourselves to the utmost. I confess that I have a somewhat confused idea of what now occurred.  I was thinking only of how I could best help in loading and running out the gun at which I had stationed myself.  All my thoughts and energies were concentrated on that; but I remember hearing the cries and groans of my shipmates as they were shot down, the tearing and crashing of the shot as they struck our devoted craft, the blocks falling from aloft, the shouts of the officers, and the occasional cheers of the men, and seeing the ropes hanging in festoons, the sails in tatters, wreck and confusion around us, with wreaths of smoke.  Then I remember observing the pirate ship, which had approached us closer and closer, come with a louder crash than any previous sounds alongside.  Grapplings were thrown on to our bulwarks, then a score or more of ruffianly looking fellows with hangers flashing leapt down on our decks.  We fired our pistols and drew our own blades, and for a few minutes fought with desperation; then Harry and I, with Tom Tubbs and the captain, were borne back towards the poop, where, as we stood for a few seconds, keeping our enemies at bay, we saw that, overwhelmed by numbers, all hope of successful resistance was vain.  Captain Magor shouted to us to sell our lives dearly, but just then I heard a voice exclaim, \"Drop your weapons and you shall have your lives, for you have fought like brave fellows.\"  Gazing at the speaker, whom I had not before recognised among the boarders, I beheld one whose countenance I knew.  Yes!  I had no doubt about the matter, he was Captain Roderick Trunnion.  At his heels followed a huge mastiff, who growled fiercely as his master was addressing us.  Whether or not Captain Roderick recognised Harry or me, we neither of us could tell.  \"We had better make a virtue of necessity,\" said the captain, dropping his sword; and I with the rest of the party did the same, for we could not suppose that our captors intended afterwards to slaughter us.  One of the officers of the pirate, stepping up, took our weapons, which we handed to him; and as our assailants now separated, apparently to plunder the vessel, the fearful condition of our deck was exposed to view.  In every direction were our poor fellows dead or wounded, including the two mates, one of whom had his head knocked off, while the other was cut almost in two by a round shot.  Planks were torn up where the shot had ploughed their way along them; blocks, entangled ropes, shattered spars, fragments of the bulwarks and boats, and pieces of sails, were scattered about amid large splashes of blood.  The pirates, now masters of the vessel, began at once to heave the dead overboard, several still breathing, who might have recovered, being treated in the same way.  Every moment I expected that the miscreants would compel us to walk the plank, but for a wonder they appeared satisfied with their victory.  Captain Trunnion did not appear to recognise us, though he fixed his eyes on Captain Magor in a very ominous way.  \"I know you,\" he said, approaching him; \"you once did me a good turn by picking me out of the water.  I should probably otherwise have served for a dinner to a hungry shark close at my heels; but you counterbalanced that by the scurvy trick you endeavoured to play me at Liverpool.  However, as no harm was done, except that my brother was not quite so affectionate as he might have been, I'll overlook that, and I tell you I don't wish to have your blood or that of any other man on my hands.  Now, listen to me, and if you are a sensible person, you will accept my offer and save your life.  I happen to have no one on board whom I can spare capable of navigating the vessel.  I intend to put a prize-crew on board this craft, and leave you some of your own men, and if you take her and them safe into the Sherbro River, you shall have your liberty and go wherever you like after the vessel has sailed.  I must send a man on board to act as mate who will stand no nonsense.  If you prove true, he'll be civil; but if not, you may expect to have your brains blown out at a moment's notice.  You understand me?\"  I watched Captain Magor's countenance, to judge whether he would accept the offer or not I hoped that he would do so, and that we should be allowed to accompany him.  He placed his hand on his brow as he paced several times up and down the deck.  \"I accept your offer,\" he said at length.  He did not I remarked, address Captain Roderick by his proper name.  \"You will, I hope, allow my two passengers to accompany me, and the boatswain, who, although not a navigator, is a first-rate seaman, and will be of great assistance to me.\"  \"No, no, my friend.  I intend these two young gentlemen, who, by the way they fought, have shown themselves to be fine spirited fellows, to accompany me; and the character you give of the boatswain makes me wish to have him on board my craft, where, to tell you the truth, I have not got too many able seamen.  You may consider yourself very fortunate at being allowed the privilege I offer you, so say no more about the matter.\"  These remarks destroyed the hopes Harry and I had entertained that we might get free of the pirate and ere long obtain our liberty.  Poor Tubbs looked very much cast down.  Knowing him well, I was sure he was not a man who would join with the pirates, although Captain Roderick might employ every means to win him over.  We were not long left in suspense as to our fate.  \"Now, my lads,\" exclaimed the pirate captain, addressing Harry and me, \"make your way on board my ship, and you follow them,\" he added turning to Tubbs.  We had just time to shake hands with Captain Magor, whose countenance showed the sorrow and anxiety he felt, when, at a sign from Captain Roderick, several of his men seized us by the shoulders, and hurried us on board the \"Vulture.\"  Tubbs then, giving an involuntary shrug of his shoulders, as if resigned to his fate, followed us; the savage growls of the dog making us dread that he would seize one of us by the leg, and so I have no doubt that he would have done at a sign from his master.  The deck of the pirate presented much the same scene as did that of the \"Arrow.\"  Our shot had done no little damage to the hull and rigging, while several of her crew were dead or dying.  Their shipmates were in the act of heaving the bodies overboard, although they did not treat those who were still breathing as they did our poor fellows.  A few of them, more compassionate than the rest, were endeavouring to staunch the blood flowing from the limbs and sides of the wounded men.  Harry, Tubbs, and I, finding that no one interfered with us, knelt down beside three of the men who were unable to move on the after part of the deck. The wretched beings were crying out for help and mercy.  Two of them were evidently suffering fearfully from thirst.  \"I'll get some water; it will do them good,\" said Tubbs, and making his way to a water-cask which stood"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21499"],["title","Europe—Whither Bound?

Being Letters of Travel from   the Capitals of Europe   in the Year 1921   BY  STEPHEN GRAHAM      THE RYERSON PRESS  TORONTO  1922     COPYRIGHT, 1922, BY  D. APPLETON AND COMPANY     PREFATORY NOTE  The Author's gratitude is due to many people in connexion with this book--to Bishop Nicholas of Zicca and the Rev. Hugh Chapman, of the Savoy, and Col. Treloar and Major-General Sir Fabian Ware, and the Editor of the \"Narodny Listi,\" at Prague, and Mr. Hyka,--to these and many others who helped a traveller on his way.  The letters from each capital were published in \"Country Life\" under the general title of _Quo Vadis Europa?_  A few after-thoughts have now been written on \"Extra Leaves,\" and sewn in between these letters.  No effort at an exhaustive study of any country is made here.  The object of the author was to make a rapid tour from capital to capital, \"keeping the taxi waiting,\" so to say, and thus obtain an idea of Europe as a whole.  It is perhaps one of the first books of travel written from the point of view of Europe as a unity, and it is hoped it will help to make us all good Europeans.

FROM PARIS     EUROPE--WHITHER BOUND?   LETTERS OF TRAVEL  I.  FROM ATHENS  Europe, whither goest thou?--the poignant question of to-day.  The pride of Christian culture, the greatest human achievement in history, with, as we thought before 1914, the seal of immortality set upon her, is now perhaps moving towards dissolution and death.  Europe has begun a rapid decline, though no one dares to think that she will continue in it downward until she reaches the chaos and misery and barbarity from which she sprang.  Affairs will presently take a turn for the better, Europe will recover her balance and resume the road of progress which she left seven years ago--prompts Hope.  \"Europe must die in order to be re-born as something better\"; \"all must be destroyed,\" say the theorists of revolution.  \"She staggers and falls and falls and plunges,\" seem to say the facts with the inexorableness of Fate.  Prophecy can be left to all men--it does not alter the course of events.  The historian in the future will ask what was the actual condition of Europe at this time, and it is possible to assume that he would grasp eagerly at an account of a visit by an impartial observer to all the principal capitals of Europe in the year 1921.  An effort to record what Europe looks like now, a series of true reflections and verbal photographs of swirling humanity at the great congregating places, the capitals, cannot but be of value.  So with the motto: \"See all: reserve your judgment,\" let us proceed.  The winds of the mountains traverse the well-shod civilization of a great city.  At the end of each of the long streets rises a mountain, and on the mountain rest the clouds and the sky.  You walk outwards, and climb the nearest and most prominent of the heights to the Acropolis, to the mighty slabs of the marble of the Parthenon, simple and pure in the mountain air, a point of view where it is always morning, and you look down from the ancient Athens to the new.  Your eyes rest on modern Athens all built in white stone, and extensive and handsome in a setting of mountains and sea, but the heart refuses to travel with the eyes.  The heart remains in the ancient city, and there, somehow, is perfect happiness, and it is a place in which to abide.  Not without some sacred thought does one place one's feet upon the bare rock where walked the bright spirits of ancient Athens.  The morning sun of Europe, the dawning vision of all that we Europeans could be or mean, dawns again in the soul.  As an old or invalid man, or one at least who in middle years has sinned and gone astray, one looks back to the innocence and promise of childhood.  Here shone the light of our being undimmed; here was kindled in Europe the faith of the ideal. Yonder is Mars Hill from which St. Paul showed the new way when the light was growing dim.  For Greece identified man in part with the Divine, but the new religion gave forgetful humanity its altar of remembrance, affirming that we do not belong to the beasts that perish but are affiliated to the Almighty.  It is perhaps strange that to-day the city which was the cradle of the ideal is a city where there are no ideals at all--either old or new, where Plato now means nothing, where even Bolshevism is not heard of. S----, who took his bachelorate on divinity at Oxford, is writing a sympathetic treatise on Nietzsche and Christianity for his doctorate at the University of Athens.  But what a mistake!  What an unfortunate choice of place and theme!  Who was Nietzsche?  \"I have changed my title to 'Nietzsche as the Devil'\" says S----.  \"Ah, that's better,\" says his professor, \"that we can understand.\"  You come down from the heights into the modern city, and you behold the rising civilization of a new Greece.  Here without question is a most pleasant city, with acacia avenues and white houses and full-bosomed abundant orange-trees hanging their golden fruits.  Thus happily bowered, merchants and bankers pursue their avocations, and shopkeepers display their wares in a pleasant array of modern shops.  On the streets walk leisurely an indolent and elegant people; the dark women are especially _chic_ and it must be said refined and restrained, and not so seductive in appearance as the South would suggest.  You see also at the many open-air cafés and in the street a very distinguished-looking type of man with finely cut features and plentiful iron-grey hair.  You surmise that you are looking upon the most indolent people in the world--not lazy like Russians or Irish, but elegantly indolent, walking so slowly, playing meditatively with their beads--for nearly every man carries his string of jet or amber beads, which he mechanically tells, though without a thought of prayer.  They walk with half-closed eyes, and whilst they seem to be thinking, they are but taking a passive pleasure in existence.  They sit down together at their cafés which debouch upon the streets, and sip the sweetest of coffee, and light their cigarettes, and regard the world which passes slowly by.  There are all manner of mendicants and of musicians flitting to and fro in the sun, like shabby butterflies, and the elegant Greek says \"No\" to them, not by sound of voice, but by the slightest elevation of the eyebrows and movement of the eye.  He sits and looks occasionally at the wonderful hills above him, so fresh, so virginal; but he does not, as an Englishman might do, pay quickly and go out and go up.  The modern Greek would never build so high as the Acropolis.  You do not hear a good word said for the Greek by any race in Europe. Italians, French, Serbs, Bulgars, Turks, and even British are all more or less anti-Greek.  Whilst it seems true to say that you scarcely find any nation that likes any other nation, yet the antipathy towards the Greek seems more marked than most others.  Whatever illfeeling or irritative may be in the air is readily vented upon the Greek.  Despite all this, however, the new Greeks are a slowly but steadily rising and prospering people.  One hundred years ago they obtained their liberation from the Turk.  The Turkish mind was shown to be incapable of absorbing Europeanism.  The light of the nineteenth century scared the night-bird back to Asia, and there arose Serbs, and Bulgars, and Roumanians as European nations, and Greece once more arose.  Modern civilization suits the Greek much more than it does the Turk.  He can understand it and utilize it.  Because of it he has risen and perchance will rise.  The Greeks are by far the cleverest people in the Balkans, and are perhaps the cleverest of the Mediterranean nations as well.  The Greek temperament swings between the dead calm and passionless on the one hand, to the violent and maniacal on the other.  The nation is still convalescent, its development is slow, and it is impossible to say how far new Greece will develop.  But its strength lies in its serpentine stillness and ancient unforgotten craft, and its weakness in that absence of ideals and in the sudden violence of partizanship which suggest pathological decay.  What Greece does is generally subtle and shrewd; what she says is often madness.  She has little sense of humour, and takes offence where other nations would laugh.  Thus she wins by statecraft and loses by politics.  In thought, and in the spoken word, Greece is outmatched for instance by the Slavs; but in silent action and in administrative policy Greece more often excels her neighbours.  You will always hear odious comparisons made in the Near East between Greek and Turk, to the disadvantage of the former.  But it seems rather absurd.  The Turk, at his best, is a child or a legendary hero--not one of ourselves--whereas the Greek is a serious European with a race-consciousness of civilization thousands of years old.  Athens has quietened down after the political violence of the restoration of Constantine.  One sees pictures of the King everywhere--a cavalry officer with high Greek military hat, bushy moustaches, and rather horse-like face.  He has large strained eyes with a questioning, impatient expression.  All these"]]]
