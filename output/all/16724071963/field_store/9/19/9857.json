It must have been on one of their visits to the Richmond house, perhaps at the slave market itself, that she beheld the other side; but this was a subject of which she would never speak to her son Robert. In fact, she was silent about it to all people, and he only knew that she was not wholly like the Southern women about him. When the war came she did not seek to persuade her son to either side, but when he made his choice he was always sure that he caused her pain, though she never said a word.  \"Do you wear such thin clothing as this out there in those cold forests?\" she asked, fingering his coat.  \"Mother,\" he replied with a smile, \"this is the style now; the shops recommend it, and you know we've all heard that a man had better be dead than out of the style.\"  \"And you have become a great soldier?\" she said, looking at him fondly.  He laughed, knowing that in any event he would seem great to her.  \"Not great, mother,\" he replied; \"but I know that I have the confidence of General Lee, on whose staff I serve.\"  \"A good man and a great one,\" she said, clasping her hands thoughtfully. \"It is a pity----\"  She stopped, and her son asked:  \"What is a pity, mother?\"  She did not answer, but he knew. It was said by many that Lee hesitated long before he went with his State.  \"Now,\" she said, \"you must eat,\" and she brought him bread and meat and coffee, serving them from a little table that she herself placed by his side.  \"How happens it, mother,\" he asked, \"that this food is still warm? It must have been hours since you had breakfast.\"  A deep tint of red as of a blush suffused her cheeks, and she answered in a hesitating voice:  \"Since there was a pause in the war, I knew that sooner or later you would come, and I remember how hungry you used to be as a growing boy.\"  \"And through all these days you have kept something hot on the fire for me, ready at a moment's notice!\"  She looked at him and there was a faint suspicion of tears in her eyes.  \"Yes, yes, Robert,\" she replied. \"Now don't scold me.\"  He had no intention of scolding her, but his thought was: \"Has any other man a mother like mine?\" Then he corrected himself; he knew that there must be myriads of others.  He said nothing in reply, merely smiling at her, and permitted her to do as she would. She went about the room with light, easy step, intent on her little services.  She opened the window shutters and the rich sunlight came streaming in, throwing a golden glow across the brown face of him who had left her a boy and come back a man. She sighed a little as she noticed how great was the change, but she hid the sigh from her son.  \"Mother,\" he asked presently, \"was there not some one else in this room when I came in? The light was faint, but I thought I saw a shadowy figure disappear.\"  \"Yes,\" she answered; \"that was Helen Harley. She was with me when you came. She may have known your footstep, too, and if not, she guessed it from my face, so she went out at once. She did not wish to be a mere curious onlooker when a mother was greeting her son, come home after three years in the war.\"  \"She must be a woman now.\"  \"She is a woman full grown in all respects. Women have grown old fast in the last three years. She is nearly a head taller than I.\"  \"You have been comfortable here, mother?\" he asked.  \"As much so as one can be in such times,\" she replied. \"I do not lack for money, and whatever deprivations I endure are those of the common lot--and this community of ill makes them amusing rather than serious.\"  She rose and walked to a door leading into the garden.  \"Where are you going?\" he asked.  \"I shall return in a few moments.\"  When she came back she brought with her a tall young woman with eyes of dark blue and hair of brown shot with gold wherever the firelight fell upon it. This girl showed a sinuous grace when she walked and she seemed to Prescott singularly self-contained.  He sprang to his feet at once and took her hand in the usual Southern fashion, making a compliment upon her appearance, also in the usual Southern fashion. Then he realized that she had ceased to be a little girl in all other respects as well as in the physical.  \"I have heard that gallantry in the face of the ladies as well as of the foe is part of a soldier's trade, Robert,\" she replied.  \"And you do not know which requires the greater daring.\"  \"But I know which your General ought to value the more.\"  After this she was serious. Neither of the younger people spoke much, but left the thread of the talk to Mrs. Prescott, who had a great deal to say. The elder woman, for all her gentleness and apparent timidity, had a bold spirit that stood in no awe of the high and mighty. She was full of curiosity about the war and plied her son with questions.  \"We in Richmond know little that is definite of its progress,\" she said. \"The Government announces victories and no defeats. But tell me, Robert, is it true, as I hear, that in the knapsacks of the slain Southern soldiers they find playing-cards, and in those of the North, Bibles?\"  \"If the Northern soldiers have Bibles, they do not use them,\" said Helen.  \"And if the Southern soldiers have playing-cards, they do use them,\" said Mrs. Prescott.  Robert laughed.  \"I daresay that both sides use their cards too much and their Bibles too little,\" he said.  \"Do not be alarmed, Robert,\" said his mother; \"such encounters between Helen and myself are of a daily occurrence.\"  \"And have not yet resulted in bloodshed,\" added Miss Harley.  Prescott watched the girl while his mother talked, and he seemed to detect in her a certain aloofness as far as he was concerned, although he was not sure that the impression was not due to his absence so long from the society of women. It gave him a feeling of shyness which he found difficult to overcome, and which he contrasted in his own mind with her ease and indifference of manner.  When she asked him of her brother, Colonel Harley, the brilliant cavalry commander, whose exploits were recounted in Richmond like a romance, she showed enthusiasm, her eyes kindling with fire, and her whole face vivid. Her pride in her brother was large and she did not seek to conceal it.  \"I hear that he is considered one of the best cavalry leaders of the age,\" she said, and she looked questioningly at Prescott.  \"There is no doubt of it,\" he replied, but there was such a lack of enthusiasm in his own voice that his mother looked quickly at him. Helen did not notice. She was happy to hear the praises of her brother, and she eagerly asked more questions about him--his charge at this place, the famous ruse by which he had beaten the Yankees at that place, and the esteem in which he was held by General Lee; all of which Prescott answered readily and with pleasure. Mrs. Prescott looked smilingly at Miss Harley.  \"It does not seem fair for a girl to show such interest in a brother,\" she said. \"Now, if it were a lover it would be all right.\"  \"I have no lover, Mrs. Prescott,\" replied Helen, a slight tint of pink appearing in her cheeks.  \"It may be so,\" said the older woman, \"but others are not like you.\" Then after a pause she sighed and said: \"I fear that the girls of '61 will show an unusually large crop of old maids.\"  She spoke half humourously of what became in reality a silent but great tragedy, especially in the case of the South.  The war was prominent in the minds of the two women. Mrs. Prescott had truly said that knowledge of it in Richmond was vague. Gettysburg, it was told, was a great victory, the fruits of which the Army of Northern Virginia, being so far from its base, was unable to reap; moreover, the Army of the West beyond a doubt had won a great triumph at Chickamauga, a battle almost as bloody as Gettysburg, and now the Southern forces were merely taking a momentary rest, gaining fresh vigour for victories greater than any that had gone before.  Nevertheless, there was a feeling of depression over Richmond. Bread was higher, Confederate money was lower; the scarcity of all things needed was growing; the area of Southern territory had contracted, the Northern armies were coming nearer and nearer, and a false note sometimes rang in the gay life of the capital.  Prescott answered the women as he best could, and, though he strove to keep a bold temper, a tone of gloom like that which afflicted Richmond appeared now and then in his replies. He was sorry that they should question him so much upon these subjects. He was feeling so good, and it was such a comfort to be there in Richmond with his own people before a warm fire, that the army could be left to take care of itself for awhile. Nevertheless, he understood their anxiety and permitted no show of hesitation to appear in his voice. Miss Harley presently rose to go. The clouds had come again and a soft snow was falling.  \"I shall see you home,\" said Prescott. \"Mother, will you lend me an umbrella?\"  Mrs. Prescott laughed softly.  \"We don't have umbrellas in Richmond now!\" she replied. \"The Yankees make them, not we, and they are not selling to us this year.\"  \"Mother,\" said Prescott, \"if the Yankees ever crush us it will be because they make things and we don't. Their artillery, their rifles, their ammunition, their wagons, their clothes, everything that they have is better than ours.\"  \"But their men are not,\" said Helen, proudly.  \"Nevertheless, we should have learned to work with our hands,\" said Prescott.  They slipped into the little garden, now bleak with winter waste. Helen drew a red cloak about her shoulders, which Prescott thought singularly becoming. The snow was falling gently and the frosty air deepened the scarlet in her cheeks. The Harley house was only on the other side of the garden and there was a path between the two. The city was now silent. Nothing came to their ears save the ringing of a church bell.  \"I suppose this does not seem much like war to you,\" said Helen.  \"I don't know,\" replied Robert. \"Just now I am engaged in escorting"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21321"],["title","Before the Dawn: A Story of the Fall of Richmond (#4)"],["body"," very valuable convoy from Fort Prescott to Fort Harley, and there may be raiders.\"  \"And here may come one now,\" she responded, indicating a horseman, who, as he passed, looked with admiring eyes over the fence that divided the garden from the sidewalk. He was a large man, his figure hidden in a great black cloak and his face in a great black beard growing bushy and unkempt up to his eyes. A sword, notable for its length, swung by his side.  Prescott raised his hand and gave a salute which was returned in a careless, easy way. But the rider's bold look of admiration still rested on Helen Harley's face, and even after he had gone on he looked back to see it.  \"You know him?\" asked Helen of Robert.  \"Yes, I know him and so do you.\"  \"If I know him I am not aware of it.\"  \"That is General Wood.\"  Helen looked again at the big, slouching figure disappearing at the corner. The name of Wood was famous in the Confederacy. The greatest of all the cavalry commanders in a service that had so many, a born military genius, he was an illiterate mountaineer, belonging to that despised, and often justly despised, class known in the South as \"poor white trash.\" But the name of Wood was now famous in every home of the revolting States. It was said that he could neither read nor write, but his genius flamed up at the coming of war as certainly as tow blazes at the touch of fire. Therefore, Helen looked after this singular man with the deepest interest and curiosity.  \"And that slouching, awkward figure is the great Wood!\" she said.  \"He is not more slouching and awkward than Jackson was.\"  \"I did not mean to attack him,\" she said quickly.  She had noticed Wood's admiring glance. In fact, it brought a tint of red to her cheeks, but she was not angry. They were now at her own door.  \"I will not ask you to come in,\" she said, \"because I know that your mother is waiting for you.\"  \"But you will some other time?\"  \"Yes, some other time.\"  When he returned to his own house Mrs. Prescott looked at him inquiringly but said nothing.     CHAPTER III  THE MOSAIC CLUB   Prescott was a staff officer and a captain, bearing a report from the Commander of the Army of Northern Virginia to the President of the Confederacy; but having been told in advance that it was perfunctory in its nature, and that no haste was necessary in its delivery, he waited until the next morning before seeking the White House, as the residence of the President was familiarly called at Richmond, in imitation of Washington. This following of old fashions and old ways often struck Prescott as a peculiar fact in a country that was rebelling against them.  \"If we succeed in establishing a new republic,\" he said to himself, \"it will be exactly like the one that we quit.\"  He was told at the White House that the President was then in conference with the Secretary of War, but Mr. Sefton would see him. He had heard often of Mr. Sefton, whose place in the Government was not clearly defined, but of whose influence there was no doubt. He was usually known as the Secretary. \"The Secretary of what?\" \"The Secretary of everything,\" was the reply.  Mr. Sefton received Prescott in a large dark room that looked like a workshop. Papers covered the tables and others were lying on the floor, indicating the office of a man who worked. The Secretary himself was standing in the darkest corner--a thin, dark, rather small man of about forty, one who seemed to be of a nervous temperament ruled by a strong will.  Prescott remembered afterward that throughout the interview the Secretary remained in the shadow and he was never once able to gain a clear view of his face. He found soon that Mr. Sefton, a remarkable man in all respects, habitually wore a mask, of which the mere shadow in a room was the least part.  Prescott gave his report, and the Secretary, after reading it attentively, said in a singularly soft voice:  \"I have heard of you, Captain Prescott. I believe that you distinguished yourself in the great charge at Gettysburg?\"  \"Not more than five thousand others.\"  \"At least you came out of the charge alive, and certainly five thousand did not do that.\"  Prescott looked at him suspiciously. Did he mean to cast some slur upon his conduct? He was sorry he could not see the Secretary's face more clearly, and he was anxious also to be gone. But the great man seemed to have another object in view.  \"I hear that there is much discontent among the soldiers,\" said Mr. Sefton in a gentle, sympathetic voice. \"They complain that we should send them supplies and reinforcements, do they not?\"  \"I believe I have heard such things said,\" reluctantly admitted Prescott.  \"Then I have not been misinformed. This illustrates, Captain, the lack of serious reflection among the soldiers. A soldier feels hungry. He wants a beefsteak, soft bread and a pot of coffee. He does not see them and at once he is angry. He waves his hand and says: 'Why are they not here for me?' The Government does not own the secret of Arabian magic. We cannot create something where nothing is.\"  Prescott felt the Secretary gazing at him as if he alone were to blame for this state of affairs. Then the door opened suddenly and several men entered. One, tall, thin and severe of countenance, the typical Southern gentleman of the old school, Prescott recognized at once as the President of the Confederacy. The others he inferred were members of his Cabinet, and he rose respectfully, imitating the example of Mr. Sefton, but he did not fail to notice that the men seemed to be disturbed.  \"A messenger from General Lee, Mr. President,\" said Mr. Sefton, in his smooth voice. \"He repeats his request for reinforcements.\"  The worried look of the President increased. He ran his hand across his brow.  \"I cannot furnish them,\" he said. \"It is no use to send any more such requests to me. Even the conscription will not fill up our armies unless we take the little boys from their marbles and the grandfathers from their chimney-corners. I doubt whether it would do so then.\"  Mr. Sefton bowed respectfully, but added nothing to his statement.  \"The price of gold has gone up another hundred points, Mr. Sefton,\" said the President. \"Our credit in Europe has fallen in an equal ratio and our Secretary of State has found no way to convince foreign governments that they are undervaluing us.\"  Prescott looked curiously at the Secretary of State--it was the first time that he had ever seen him--a middle-aged man with broad features of an Oriental cast. He it was to whom many applied the words \"the brains of the Confederacy.\" Now he was not disturbed by the President's evident annoyance.  \"Why blame me, Mr. President?\" he said. \"How long has it been since we won a great victory? Our credit is not maintained here in Richmond nor by our agents in Europe, but on the battlefield.\"  Mr. Sefton looked at Prescott as if to say: \"Just as I told you.\" Prescott thought it strange that they should speak so plainly before him, a mere subordinate, but policy might be in it, he concluded on second thought. They might desire their plain opinion to get back informally to General Lee. There was some further talk, all of which they seemed willing for him to hear, and then they returned to the inner room, taking Mr. Sefton, who bade Prescott wait.  The Secretary returned in a half-hour, and taking Prescott's arm with an appearance of great familiarity and friendliness, said:  \"I shall walk part of the way with you, if you will let me, Captain Prescott. The President asks me to say to you that you are a gallant soldier and he appreciates your services. Therefore, he hopes that you will greatly enjoy your leave of absence in Richmond.\"  Prescott flushed with pleasure. He liked a compliment and did not deem it ignoble to show his pleasure. He was gratified, too, at the confidence that the Secretary, a man whose influence he knew was not exaggerated, seemed to put in him, and he thanked him sincerely.  So they walked arm in arm into the street, and those who met them raised their hats to the powerful Secretary, and incidentally to Prescott also, because he was with Mr. Sefton.  \"If we win,\" said Mr. Sefton, \"Richmond will become a great city--one of the world's capitals.\"  \"Yes--if we win,\" replied Prescott involuntarily.  \"Why, you don't think that we shall lose, do you?\" asked the Secretary quickly.  Prescott was confused and hesitated. He regretted that he had spoken any part of his thoughts, and felt that the admission had been drawn from him, but now thought it better to be frank than evasive.  \"Napoleon said that Providence was on the side of the heaviest battalions,\" he replied, \"and therefore I hope ours will increase in weight soon.\"  The Secretary did not seem to be offended, leaning rather to the other side as he commended the frankness of the young Captain's speech. Then he began to talk to him at great length about the army, its condition, its prospects and the spirit of the soldiers. He revealed a knowledge of the camp that surprised Prescott and aroused in him admiration mingled with a lingering distrust.  Mr. Sefton seemed to him different, indeed, from the average Southerner. Very few Southern men at that time sought to conceal their feelings. Whatever their faults they were open, but Mr. Sefton wore his mask always. Prescott's mind went back unconsciously to the stories he had read of the agile Italian politicians of the Middle Ages, and for a moment paused at the doctrine of reincarnation. Then he was ashamed of himself. He was wronging Mr. Sefton, an able man devoted to the Southern cause--as everybody said.  They stopped just in front of Mrs. Prescott's house.  \"You live here?\" said the Secretary. \"I know your mother. I cannot go in, but I thank you. And Miss Harley lives in the next house. I know her, too--a spirited and beautiful woman. Good-day, Captain Prescott; I shall see you again before you return to the army.\"  He left Prescott and walked back toward the"]]]
