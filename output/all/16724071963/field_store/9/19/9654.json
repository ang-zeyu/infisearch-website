Is there anything in the house for the menagerie to eat?\" he asked the little old housekeeper.  \"Oh, yes, Uncle Toby always fed them well,\" she answered. \"Oh, I'm so glad you came to take charge of the pets!\"  \"I don't know whether we are or not,\" remarked Mrs. Martin. \"I suppose, though,\" she said to her husband in a low voice, as they prepared to enter the house, \"we can sell them. We don't have to keep them.\"  \"Yes, I guess that would be best--to sell them,\" agreed Mr. Martin, but he did not let the Curlytops hear him say this.  Led by Mrs. Watson, the Curlytop party entered the house. As the door was opened the different noises sounded more loudly than before.  The dogs barked--and Ted could now hear the tones of two different animals--the cat mewed, the monkey screeched and chattered, and the parrot cried:  \"Give Polly a cracker! Polly wants a crack-crack-cracker!\"  \"I guess the alligator is the only one that isn't saying anything,\" remarked Mr. Martin to his wife as they entered. \"And I never heard that alligators make a noise.\"  \"Yes they do!\" said Janet, eagerly. \"I read it in my natural history book. They make a noise like a grunt. At least it's either alligators or crocodiles, I've forgotten which. But one kind bellows like a bull.\"  \"Goodness! Let us hope this one doesn't!\" sighed Mrs. Martin. \"Who would ever think that Uncle Toby would keep a menagerie!\" she murmured.  \"I never did,\" agreed her husband.  \"They're all in one big room--a sort of addition to the house. It opens off the dining room,\" explained Mrs. Watson. \"Uncle Toby liked to eat when his pets did, that's why he had 'em so near him in the dining room. I'll show 'em to you.\"  \"Are the pigeons out there, too?\" asked Mrs. Martin.  \"No, Uncle Toby kept them in the barn,\" the housekeeper replied. \"If you don't want the pigeons, Uncle Toby told me to tell you there's a boy in this same street who will take them. But Uncle Toby said he wished you'd take charge of all the other pets.\"  \"Oh, yes, Mother--Daddy! Let's keep 'em _all_!\" pleaded Janet.  By this time Mrs. Watson had opened the door leading into the extra room that Uncle Toby had built to house his pets. No sooner was the door opened than the noise sounded louder than ever, and several things happened.  \"Oh, look at the lovely cat!\" cried Janet, as one with very fluffy fur walked forward as though to meet the Curlytops. \"It's a Persian, I guess. Oh, I just love a Persian! Turnover is very nice, but I love this one a lot,\" and she reached down to stroke the beautiful cat that seemed very friendly.  \"Oh, look!\" suddenly cried Ted. \"See! The dogs do tricks!\"  As he spoke one white poodle came walking along on his hind legs, with his front paws held in a funny fashion before him.  \"Bow wow!\" barked the poodle. And then, as if this might be a signal, there suddenly came from the end of the room another white poodle, so nearly like the first that it was difficult to tell them apart.  \"Oh, see! More tricks!\" cried Ted.  The second dog began turning somersaults. One after another he turned, making his way, in this fashion, to where Ted was patting the head of the poodle that was standing on its hind legs.  \"Say! I can have a regular circus with these trick dogs!\" cried Ted in delight.  \"And my Persian cat can be in it,\" added Janet.  Just then a cry, as if of fear, came from Trouble. Turning around the Curlytops and others saw a strange sight.  A brown monkey was hanging by its tail from an electric chandelier in the middle of the room, and, thus reaching down, was trying to pull Trouble's cap from the little fellow's head.  \"'Top! 'Top it!\" shouted William. \"Make han'-ordan monkey let my cap alone!\" he wailed. And then, with a flutter and a screech, a green and red parrot flew from its perch and landed on Mrs. Martin's shoulder. The pets of the Curlytops were having a lively time!     CHAPTER V  TIP AND TOP   With the barking of the trick dogs, in which Skyrocket joined, and with the mewing of the Persian cat, the shrieking of the parrot, and the chattering of the monkey, for a time there was so much noise in Uncle Toby's \"menagerie,\" as it was called, that the voices of Mr. and Mrs. Martin could scarcely be heard. But you could hear the voice of Trouble above everything.  \"Take him off! Make him 'top!\" cried the little fellow. For by this time the monkey, having hung down by his tail from the chandelier, and having taken off Trouble's cap, was now trying to pull the little boy's hair.  \"Bad monkey! Make him go 'way!\" cried Trouble.  [Illustration: THE SECOND DOG BEGAN TURNING SOMERSAULTS. \"The Curlytops and Their Pets.\" Page 50]  \"And I don't like this parrot!\" said Mrs. Martin, though, to be sure, the bird was gentle enough. It only sat on her shoulder and shrieked:  \"Crack! Crack! Cracker! I'm a cracker-acker!\"  \"Say, this is great!\" cried Ted, as he watched the two dogs, one of which was marching around on his hind legs while the other was turning somersaults.  \"Oh, it's terrible!\" said Mrs. Martin. \"Dick,\" she called to her husband, \"can't you make that monkey stop hurting William?\"  \"He isn't exactly hurting him, my dear,\" replied Mr. Martin. \"Though I fancy Trouble is a bit frightened. I was going to take that parrot off your shoulder.\"  \"Well, look after William first. He needs it more than I.\"  Mr. Martin advanced toward the monkey, swinging by his tail from the chandelier, when Mrs. Watson, the housekeeper, said:  \"I'll attend to him! I know how to manage Jack if I don't any of the other animals. I found a way to make him behave. Here!\" she suddenly cried, catching up a feather-duster and shaking it at the long-tailed creature. \"Get back to your cubby-hole, Jack!\"  With a shrill chatter the monkey dropped Trouble's cap, which he was trying to make stick on his own head, and a moment later he jumped down from the chandelier and scampered into a box at the side of the room.  \"That's where he belongs!\" said Mrs. Watson. \"He's always afraid of that feather-duster. Maybe he thinks it's a big eagle coming to bite his tail. Anyhow, show him the feather-duster whenever you want to quiet him.\"  \"That's a good thing to know,\" said Mr. Martin, when it was a little quieter in the room, because Jack, the monkey, had stopped chattering. \"But what shall we do about the parrot on my wife's shoulder?\"  \"Oh, Mr. Nip is all right. He's very gentle,\" said the housekeeper. \"Uncle Toby named him Mr. Nip because he used to nip and bite when he first came. But Uncle Toby soon cured him of that. Mr. Nip is a nice polly.\"  \"I'm a crack! I'm a crack! I'm a crack-crack-cracker!\" shrieked the parrot, and then he flew from Mrs. Martin's shoulder to the regular perch, near the little cage of the monkey--the \"cubby-hole,\" as Mrs. Watson called it.  \"Thank goodness!\" sighed the mother of the Curlytops.  \"You scared, Mother?\" asked Trouble, who was now wishing the monkey would come back, for after his first fright, the little fellow rather liked the fuzzy chap.  \"Only a little,\" said Mrs. Martin, for she thought if the Curlytops were to have anything to do with Uncle Toby's pets, it would not be well for her to say they frightened her.  \"I 'ike 'em all,\" remarked Trouble, while Janet was rubbing the big Persian cat and Ted was playing with the two dogs. \"Uncle Toby nice man to have all nanimals 'ike dis!\" and he looked around the room. Surely there were quite a number of animal pets there.  \"How in the world did my uncle ever come to have so many?\" asked Mr. Martin. \"And what in the world are we going to do with them?\"  \"I'll tell you about it after we've fed them,\" said Mrs. Watson. \"They'll be quieter after they're fed, and you might as well start in now to give them something to eat. If you're going to take 'em with you and keep 'em you'll have to feed 'em.\"  With the help of Ted and Janet, who set out food to the dogs and cat, Uncle Toby's animals were soon all being given things to eat, and this made them quiet. Then, while the children stood and watched the animals eat, Mrs. Watson took Daddy and Mother Martin into the next room and told them about Uncle Toby and the pets.  \"I never knew that my uncle was so fond of animals,\" said Mr. Martin.  \"He wasn't, when I first came here to keep house for him,\" explained Mrs. Watson. \"But he made friends, once, with a sailor, who had the parrot. When the sailor started off on his next sea voyage, and didn't want to take Mr. Nip, the parrot, with him, Uncle Toby said the bird could stay here. I didn't much mind that, as it was rather lonesome when Uncle Toby--as I always call him--went out. So I got to liking Mr. Nip.  \"Then, after a while, another sailor gave Uncle Toby Jack, the monkey. The house was more lively after that, for the monkey and parrot used to fight, though they don't any more. I thought this would be about all the pets Uncle Toby would get; but lo and behold! about a month after that another sailor, hearing that Uncle Toby had a monkey and a parrot, came and asked us if we wouldn't take Slider.\"  \"Who is Slider?\" asked Mrs. Martin. \"It sounds like a pair of roller skates.\"  \"Slider is the pet alligator. He came from Florida,\" explained Mrs. Watson. \"Uncle Toby took him in, as he had the monkey and the parrot, and I began to wonder what would happen next.\"  \"Did anything?\" asked Daddy Martin, as he watched the Curlytops playing in the next room with the pets.  \"Oh, my land, yes!\" exclaimed Mrs. Watson. \"It wasn't more than two weeks after he got Slider--that's the alligator--that an old circus man came along with the two dogs, Tip and Top.\"  \"Are those their names?\" asked Mrs. Martin, watching Ted as he made one of the dogs turn somersaults.  \"Yes, one of the white poodles--the one with the black spot on his tail--is named Tip,\" the housekeeper said. \"You see the spot is on the tip of his tail.\"  \"I can see that--yes,\" replied Mr. Martin from where he sat. He was wondering where all this was going to end. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21049"],["title","The Curlytops and Their Pets; Or, Uncle Toby's Strange Collection (#6)"],["body"," \"And the other dog is named Top,\" said the housekeeper. \"He has a black spot on the top of his head.\"  \"They are both very nice, and I like the names, too--Tip and Top,\" remarked Mrs. Martin. \"See!\" she exclaimed. \"Our own dog, Skyrocket, is making friends with them.\"  Indeed Skyrocket, the Curlytop's dog, was doing this very thing. Perhaps he wanted to learn how to walk on his hind legs and turn somersaults, as Tip and Top could do.  \"Tip and Top are two valuable dogs,\" said Mrs. Watson. \"They were once in the circus, and it was there they learned to do their tricks, though Uncle Toby taught them others.\"  \"Why didn't the circus man keep them if they were so valuable?\" asked Mrs. Martin.  \"The circus man had made friends with the sailor who gave Uncle Toby the alligator,\" explained the housekeeper, \"and the circus man decided to become a sailor, too. He said he didn't want to keep the dogs on a ship, so he gave them to Uncle Toby.\"  \"And that's how the menagerie started?\" asked Daddy Martin.  \"That's how it started,\" said Mrs. Watson. \"There were times when I thought it would never end. That was when a lady, who was going to travel for her health, asked Uncle Toby to keep Snuff, her Persian cat.\"  \"Is Snuff the cat's name?\" asked the mother of the Curlytops.  \"Yes,\" answered Mrs. Watson. \"It is just the color of snuff, you see, a sort of yellowish brown. Many Persian cats have that color, I'm told. Anyhow this lady--I've forgotten her name--said she saw that Uncle Toby loved animals, as he had so many of them, so she asked him to keep her cat.\"  \"And Uncle Toby did,\" remarked Mrs. Martin.  \"Uncle Toby surely did!\" declared the housekeeper. \"It seemed he couldn't say 'no' where animals were concerned. By this time the house began to be rather overrun with pets, so he built this room out of the dining room, with special cages--cubby-holes I call 'em--for the pets. I did think Snuff would be the last one, but after that came the white mice and rats.\"  \"It's usually the other way about,\" said Mrs. Martin, with a smile. \"When the cat comes the mice go. But this time the mice came after the cat arrived.\"  \"Yes,\" agreed the housekeeper. \"Snuff, the cat, and the white mice--I don't know their names--are great friends. The mice and rats belonged to a boy down the street. His family moved to another state last summer, and his folks made him get rid of the mice. He brought them to Uncle Toby, and of course Uncle Toby couldn't say no, so he kept them. It was then I first threatened to leave. The house was too full of animals.\"  \"But you didn't go,\" said Mrs. Martin.  \"No, I stayed on, because Uncle Toby begged me to, and he said he wouldn't add to his collection. But then came the pigeons. They were brought by another boy, whose folks moved away and he couldn't keep 'em any more. I didn't so much mind the pigeons, as they stay out in the barn. But we certainly had a houseful of pets! After a while I got rather to liking them, and Uncle Toby was very fond of 'em, and taught 'em many tricks.\"  \"But finally, as you know from the letter he wrote you, he decided to take a long trip, and perhaps he may never come back, if he finds he likes it in South America. So he decided to ask you to take charge of his collection, and I said I'd stay until you arrived, as Uncle Toby had to leave in a hurry, to catch a ship that was sailing for South America.\"  \"Why did he go there?\" asked Mr. Martin.  \"I think it was because he heard that monkeys and parrots come from there,\" the housekeeper answered. \"He seemed to like those animals better than any others, though Tip and Top, the two dogs, are more valuable, because they can do circus tricks.\"  \"They certainly are cute,\" said Mrs. Martin.  \"Well, there you have the story of Uncle Toby's pets,\" said Mrs. Watson, \"though I suppose they'll be the Curlytops' pets now, for Uncle Toby said he was going to give you his collection.\"  \"Hum! Yes,\" mused Mr. Martin. \"If I had known what the collection was I don't believe I would have come after it.\"  Mrs. Watson began putting on her hat, and from a corner of the room she picked up her valise, which she had already packed.  \"Where are you going?\" asked Mrs. Martin.  \"I am going away,\" answered the housekeeper. \"My plans are all made. I am going to live with my sister. All she keeps is a cat, and she puts that outside and winds the clock every night before she goes to bed. I'm going to her house. I told Uncle Toby I'd stay until the Curlytops came to take charge of the pets, and, now that you are here, I'll be going.\"  \"But I say! Look here! What are we going to do?\" asked Mr. Martin.  \"Why, you're to take charge of the collection,\" said the housekeeper. \"That's what Uncle Toby said in his letter. You are to have the pets!\"  \"But I don't want them! That is, we can't keep so many!\" protested Daddy Martin. \"Two dogs, a cat, a monkey, a parrot, an alligator and some white rats and mice, to say nothing of the pigeons! And we have a dog and cat now, and we just got rid of a goat and a pony! Oh, I say, my dear Mrs. Watson! This is too much!\"  \"Can't help it!\" said the housekeeper as she fastened on her hat. \"Uncle Toby said you were to take charge of his collection of pets. That's all I know. If he never comes back--and I don't believe he ever will--the pets are yours to keep. I'd keep them if I were you--all except the pigeons. There's a boy down the street who will take them and be glad to get 'em. The pets are valuable--especially Tip and Top, the dogs. They do tricks separately, but they do more tricks together--a sort of team, you know. Those dogs are very valuable for a show.\"  \"Then I know what we can do,\" said Mr. Martin. \"We can sell the pets Uncle Toby left and give the money to a home for children, or something like that. I'll do it--we'll sell the pets!\"  In another moment--just as if they had been waiting for their father to say this--there came a storm of objections from Ted and Janet. In they ran from the room where they had been playing with the animals.  \"Oh, don't sell 'em!\" pleaded Janet.  \"Let us keep 'em!\" begged Ted. \"Those dogs are the best I ever saw! They can do dandy tricks! I could get up a show with them and Skyrocket.\"  \"And this cat and our other cat, too,\" added Janet. \"Don't sell Uncle Toby's pets, Daddy! Let us keep them!\"  Daddy Martin looked at his wife. And then, as if they had been waiting for something like this, Tip and Top did one of their best tricks. Tip began turning somersaults again and Top walked around on his hind legs. Then the two dogs barked, and, without anyone saying a word to them, they did another trick.  Tip stopped turning somersaults and stood still. In an instant Top jumped up on Tip's back and stood there on his hind legs. Then Tip walked around the room.  \"Oh, aren't they too sweet for anything!\" cried Janet.  \"That's a dandy trick!\" declared Ted. \"Do, please, let us keep Uncle Toby's pets for our own.\"  \"Well,\" said his father slowly, \"I don't see how in the world----\"  But at that moment there came a knock at the door, and the dogs began to bark, the parrot shrieked, the monkey chattered and Snuff, the Persian cat, began to mew.  What was going to happen now?     CHAPTER VI  WHERE IS TIP?   \"Someone is at the door,\" said Mrs. Martin to Uncle Toby's housekeeper.  \"Yes, I hear 'em,\" answered the queer little old lady. \"I 'spect it's the boy after the pigeons. I told him to call as soon as he saw the Curlytops arrive, and he's probably been watching for you. I'll let him in as soon as I finish putting on my hat so I can go.\"  But before this Mr. Martin, who was nearest the door, had opened it, and in came a boy about as old as Teddy, though without the curly locks of that little lad.  \"Can I have the pigeons?\" asked the new boy, taking off his cap and making a little bow to Mrs. Martin, Mrs. Watson and Daddy Martin. \"Uncle Toby said I could have 'em if you folks didn't want 'em, and I've been waiting for you to come. I just saw you get here.\"  \"Yes! Yes! Take the pigeons! Take any of the animals you want!\" begged Mrs. Martin. \"I don't see what in the world we are going to do with these animals!\"  \"Oh, keep Tip and Top--the dogs!\" begged Teddy.  \"And Snuff, the cat!\" added Janet.  \"I 'ike monkey if he don't pull my cap off,\" said Trouble. \"'Et's keep him!\"  \"And the white mice and rats wouldn't be much bother,\" went on Teddy.  \"We never had a parrot that I can remember,\" cried Janet. \"I could feed him, Mother.\"  \"The alligator doesn't make much noise,\" Ted said.  \"Dear me! We'll end up by keeping them all, I see!\" laughed the father of the Curlytops. \"That is, all but the pigeons,\" he added quickly, as he saw a look of disappointment on the face of the new boy. \"You may have them, since Uncle Toby promised them to you.\"  \"The pigeons are all I want,\" said the boy, whose name was Bob Nelson. \"My mother won't let me have any of the other pets. And, anyhow, I have a dog and a cat. Could I get the pigeons now? I've got a basket and they are so tame I can pick 'em up. They know me. I used to help Uncle Toby feed 'em.\"  \"Yes, you may get them,\" Mrs. Martin said. \"We'll get rid of a few of the pets in that way. But what we are to do with the others, I'm sure I don't know.\"  \"You'd better keep 'em,\" advised Mrs. Watson, who was now almost ready to go. \"Uncle Toby wouldn't like it, I'm sure, if you didn't take care of his pets.\"  \"Oh, I wouldn't, for the world, have anything happen to them, as he was so fond of them and kind to them,\" said the mother of the Curlytops. \"But we could sell them to some animal store, and, as my husband says, give the money to a home for children. Uncle Toby would like that.\"  \"Yes, he was very fond of children and animals,\" said the housekeeper, as she seemed about to leave. \"It's a pity he never had any of his own--any children, I mean,\" she quickly added. \"He did have enough animals. You'd better keep 'em, your children seem fond of 'em,\" she added.  \"Oh, the Curlytops love"]]]
