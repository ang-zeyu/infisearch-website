To these speeches       they gave, of course, their own interpretation; fancying, no       doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of vast       quantities of ready money; and provided I paid them all I owed,       and a trifle more, in consideration of their services, I dare say       they cared very little what became of either my soul or my       carcass.        “In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently       inflated. I attached the car, therefore, and put all my       implements in it—not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a       copious supply of water, and a large quantity of provisions, such       as pemmican, in which much nutriment is contained in       comparatively little bulk. I also secured in the car a pair of       pigeons and a cat. It was now nearly daybreak, and I thought it       high time to take my departure. Dropping a lighted cigar on the       ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to       pick it up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose       end, as I said before, protruded a very little beyond the lower       rim of one of the smaller casks. This manoeuvre was totally       unperceived on the part of the three duns; and, jumping into the       car, I immediately cut the single cord which held me to the       earth, and was pleased to find that I shot upward, carrying with       all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden ballast,       and able to have carried up as many more.        “Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards,       when, roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and       tumultuous manner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke,       and sulphur, and legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and       blazing metal, that my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down       in the bottom of the car, trembling with unmitigated terror.       Indeed, I now perceived that I had entirely overdone the       business, and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to       be experienced. Accordingly, in less than a second, I felt all       the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately       thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst       abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament       asunder. When I afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail       to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded       myself, to its proper cause—my situation directly above it, and       in the line of its greatest power. But at the time, I thought       only of preserving my life. The balloon at first collapsed, then       furiously expanded, then whirled round and round with horrible       velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering like a drunken man,       hurled me with great force over the rim of the car, and left me       dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and my       face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in       length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom       of the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became       most providentially entangled. It is impossible—utterly       impossible—to form any adequate idea of the horror of my       situation. I gasped convulsively for breath—a shudder resembling       a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my frame—I       felt my eyes starting from their sockets—a horrible nausea       overwhelmed me—and at length I fainted away.        “How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It       must, however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I       partially recovered the sense of existence, I found the day       breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of       ocean, and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide       within the limits of the vast horizon. My sensations, however,       upon thus recovering, were by no means so rife with agony as       might have been anticipated. Indeed, there was much of incipient       madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my situation.       I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other, and       wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of       the veins, and the horrible blackness of the fingernails. I       afterward carefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and       feeling it with minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying       myself that it was not, as I had more than half suspected, larger       than my balloon. Then, in a knowing manner, I felt in both my       breeches pockets, and, missing therefrom a set of tablets and a       toothpick case, endeavored to account for their disappearance,       and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly chagrined. It now       occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in the joint of       my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to       glimmer through my mind. But, strange to say! I was neither       astonished nor horror-stricken. If I felt any emotion at all, it       was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was       about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma; and I       never, for a moment, looked upon my ultimate safety as a question       susceptible of doubt. For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the       profoundest meditation. I have a distinct recollection of       frequently compressing my lips, putting my forefinger to the side       of my nose, and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces       common to men who, at ease in their arm-chairs, meditate upon       matters of intricacy or importance. Having, as I thought,       sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution and       deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the       large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my       inexpressibles. This buckle had three teeth, which, being       somewhat rusty, turned with great difficulty on their axis. I       brought them, however, after some trouble, at right angles to the       body of the buckle, and was glad to find them remain firm in that       position. Holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth, I       now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. I had to rest       several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it       was at length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made       fast the buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security,       tightly around my wrist. Drawing now my body upwards, with a       prodigious exertion of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very       first trial, in throwing the buckle over the car, and entangling       it, as I had anticipated, in the circular rim of the wicker-work.        “My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an       angle of about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood       that I was therefore only forty-five degrees below the       perpendicular. So far from it, I still lay nearly level with the       plane of the horizon; for the change of situation which I had       acquired, had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards       from my position, which was accordingly one of the most imminent       and deadly peril. It should be remembered, however, that when I       fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen with my       face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from       it, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by       which I was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge,       instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car,—I say it       may be readily conceived that, in either of these supposed cases,       I should have been unable to accomplish even as much as I had now       accomplished, and the wonderful adventures of Hans Pfaall would       have been utterly lost to posterity, I had therefore every reason       to be grateful; although, in point of fact, I was still too       stupid to be anything at all, and hung for, perhaps, a quarter of       an hour in that extraordinary manner, without making the       slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly       tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment. But this feeling did not       fail to die rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and       dismay, and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin. In       fact, the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head       and throat, and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with       madness and delirium, had now begun to retire within their proper       channels, and the distinctness which was thus added to my       perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me of the       self-possession and courage to encounter it. But this weakness       was, luckily for me, of no very long duration. In good time came       to my rescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and       struggles, I jerked my way bodily upwards, till at length,       clutching with a vise-like grip the long-desired rim, I writhed       my person over it, and fell headlong and shuddering within the       car.        “It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself       sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. I       then, however, examined it with attention, and found it, to my       great relief, uninjured. My implements were all safe, and,       fortunately, I had lost neither ballast nor provisions. Indeed, I       had so well secured them in their places, that such an accident       was entirely out of the question. Looking at my watch, I found it       six o’clock. I was still rapidly ascending, and my barometer gave       a present altitude of three and three-quarter"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21472"],["title","Ned Garth; Or, Made Prisoner in Africa: A Tale of the Slave Trade (#0)"],["body","Garth; Made Prisoner in Africa. A Tale of the Slave Trade, by W H G Kingston.  ________________________________________________________________________  NED GARTH; MADE PRISONER IN AFRICA. A TALE OF THE SLAVE TRADE, BY W H G KINGSTON.    CHAPTER ONE.  \"Can you make her out, Ned?  My eyes are not so sharp as they used to be, and I lost sight of the craft when came on.\"  \"She has tacked, uncle; I see her masts in one, and she's standing to the westward.\"  \"I was afraid so; she must be a stranger, or she would have kept her course.  She'll not weather the head as she's now standing, and if it doesn't clear and show her the land, she'll be on shore, as sure as my name is John Pack.\"  The speaker was a strongly built man, dressed in a thick pea-coat buttoned closely over his breast, the collar turned up to protect his neck.  A white, low-crowned, weather-beaten, broadish-brimmed hat covered his head, and he held in his hand a thick stick, which he pressed firmly on the ground as he walked, for he had been deprived of one of his legs, its place being supplied by a wooden substitute resembling a mop handle in shape.  His appearance was decidedly nautical, and though habited in plain clothes, he might have been known at a glance to be a naval officer.  His companion, a boy of about fourteen years of age, though from his height and breadth of shoulders he might have been supposed to be older, wore a thick monkey jacket, a necessary protection against the strong wind and dense masses of rain and mist which swept up from the ocean.  They stood on the top of a cliff on the southern coast of England, which, circling round from the north-west to the south-east, formed a broad deep bay, terminated on the further side by a bluff headland, and on the other by a rocky point, a ledge partly under water extending beyond it.  The bay was indeed a dangerous place to enter with so heavy a gale from the south-west as was now blowing.  Lieutenant Pack and his young nephew Edward Garth were returning home from an errand of mercy to an old fisherman who had been severely injured by the upsetting of his boat, in a vain endeavour to go off to a coaster in distress, which foundered in sight of land, when he was washed on shore amid the fragments of his boat, narrowly escaping with his life.  Although the fisherman's cottage was upwards of two miles off, the old lieutenant trudged daily over to see him, and on this occasion had been accompanied by his nephew, carrying a basket containing certain delicacies prepared by the kind hands of Miss Sarah Pack, or sister Sally, as he was wont to call her.  He and his nephew had started later than usual, and the gloom of an autumn evening had overtaken them when they were still some distance from home.  He had caught sight of the vessel, apparently a large brig, and had at once perceived her dangerous position.  For some time he and his nephew stood watching the stranger from the cliff.  \"Here she comes again!\" cried Ned.  \"She made out the land sooner than I expected she would,\" observed the lieutenant; \"but she'll scarcely weather the point even now, unless the wind shifts.  She can't do it--she can't do it!\" he cried, striking the ground in his eagerness with his stick.  \"Run on, Ned, to the coast-guard station.  If you meet one of the men, tell him, in case he hasn't seen her, that I think the vessel will be on shore before long. But if you fall in with no one, go and let Lieutenant Hanson know what I say, and he'll get his rockets ready, so as to be prepared to assist the crew whenever the vessel may strike.  Take care, Ned, though, not to fall over the cliff--keep well away from it.  On a dark night you cannot see the path clearly, and in many spots, remember, it ends abruptly in places where it wouldn't do to tumble down.  I cannot spare you, my boy.\"  While the lieutenant was shouting out these latter sentences, Edward, eager to obey his uncle's directions, had got to a considerable distance; he, however, very soon came back.  \"I met one of the men, uncle,\" he said, \"and he went on to the station faster than I could in the dark, as he knows the short cuts.\"  \"Come along then, we'll keep an eye on the brig as we walk homeward,\" said the lieutenant.  \"I pray that after all she may claw off the land, although she will have a hard job to do it.\"  The old officer and the boy proceeded on the way they had previously been pursuing.  They had gone some distance when they saw a light approaching them.  \"Now, if my sister Sally hasn't sent Tom to look for us, or I am much mistaken,\" he exclaimed to himself rather than to his companion.  \"Poor soul! she's been in a precious quandary at our not returning sooner, and has been fancying that we shall be melted by the rain, or carried off the cliffs by the wind, though it blows directly on them.\"  The lieutenant was right in his conjectures; in another minute a voice was heard shouting, \"Dat you, Massa Pack an' Massa Ned?\"  \"Aye, aye,\" answered the lieutenant; \"keep your lantern shaded from the sea, or it may be mistaken for a signal.\"  Directly afterwards a tall figure could be discerned coming towards him. \"Missie Sarah in drea'ful way, cos you an' Massa Ned not come back when de wind an' rain kick up such a hulabaloo,\" said the same voice which had before spoken.  The lieutenant explained the cause of their delay, and bade Tom hasten back and tell his mistress that they would soon be at home, but were anxious to ascertain the fate of a vessel they had discovered closer in-shore than she should be.  \"Beg her not to be alarmed; and, Tom, you come back with a coil of rope and a couple of oars from the boat-house. We may not want them, for I hope the coast-guard men will be up to the spot in time to help, should the craft unfortunately come ashore, but it is just as well to be prepared to render assistance in case of need.\"  Tom, handing the lantern to the boy, hurried back to execute the orders he had received, the lieutenant and his young companion following at a slower pace.  The fast increasing darkness had now completely shut out the brig from sight.  When last perceived, however, her head was pointed in a direction which, could she maintain, she might weather the rocks under her lee.  Presently the loud report of a gun was heard sounding high above the roar of the seas which broke on the shore.  \"That was fearfully near,\" observed Edward.  \"It was indeed,\" said the lieutenant.  \"I hope that it will hurry Hanson and his men.  The master of the brig has discovered his danger.  There is no chance of her escaping, I fear.\"  \"I can see her!\" cried the boy; \"one of her top-masts has gone, she's drifting bodily on shore.\"  \"Poor fellows! with a heavy sea beating on it; unless she's a stout craft, she'll knock to pieces in a few minutes,\" observed the lieutenant.  \"We'll go down to the beach and try what help we can render.\"  A zig-zag pathway, well known to both of them, led downwards through an opening in the cliff, a short distance from the spot they had reached. The lieutenant and his nephew followed it without hesitation, the former leading and feeling the way with his stick, for it required care to avoid slipping over, and an ugly fall might have been the consequence of a false step.  They reached the bottom, however, in safety; and as they hurried along the shingly beach, straining their eyes to discover the whereabouts of the hapless brig, another and another gun was heard, the loud reports rapidly succeeding the bright flashes, showing the nearness of the vessel.  The whistling of the wind and the roaring of the waves overpowered all other sounds.  They listened for another gun, but listened in vain.  \"I feared it would be so,\" exclaimed the lieutenant; \"she must have struck already.\"  \"Yes, yes, I see a dark mass surrounded by foam; that must he her, and not fifty yards off,\" cried Ned.  As he spoke he could distinguish, in imagination at all events, amid the wild foaming waters, the crash of timbers, and hear the cries of the hapless crew imploring assistance. For an instant, too, he fancied that he saw a smaller object floating on the snowy crests of the waves, but before he could be certain that it was what he supposed, it had disappeared.  \"Would that the men with their rockets were here.  What can have delayed them?  If they don't come soon, not a soul of the crew will be left alive,\" exclaimed the lieutenant.  Just then a voice hailed, and Edward shouted in return.  A dark figure could be seen at the top of the cliff.  It was Tom, who rapidly made his way down to where they stood, carrying a pair of oars and a coil of rope.  \"The brig is driving in,\" cried Edward.  \"She's much nearer than when I first saw her.\"  \"You're right,\" answered the lieutenant.  \"In spite of my timber leg, few men could once beat me at swimming; even now I've a mind to go off to the wreck.  I might be in time to save some of the people.  Here, Tom, hand me the end of the rope, and I'll make it fast round my waist, and do you and Ned pay it out, and haul in again when I shout to you.\"  \"Don't think of going,\" said Edward; \"you have been ill lately, and are not as strong as you were.  Let me try.  I can swim like a fish; you have often seen me in rough water as well as in smooth.  It won't matter to any one if I am drowned.\"  \"Won't it though!  What would Aunt Sally say if I was to go back without you, Ned?\" exclaimed the lieutenant.  \"I should never be able to look her in the face again.\"  \"But I'll do my best not to come to harm,\" said Edward; \"and you can haul me back if I cannot make my way through the breakers.\"  \"Let me go, massa,\" cried Tom, rapidly throwing off his clothes, and beginning, without further ado, to fasten the rope round his own waist. \"Jis see him tight--not a slip-knot, massa.  Tom Baraka swim tro' worse seas dan dis on coast ob Africa, as you know.  Stick de oar in de sand. Tie de rope to it, Massa Pack; you pay out, and off him go.\"  And"]]]
