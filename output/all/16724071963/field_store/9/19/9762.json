Indeed, it is but justice to the shikaree to say, that Karl and Caspar ran first: for they had been the first to deliver their fire; and as soon as they had done so, each scampered as he best could.  They ran together; and fortunately for both a large tree was near, with low horizontal limbs, which favoured a rapid ascent towards its top.  There was only a second of time between the commencement of their flight and that of Ossaroo; but short as it was, it decided the preference of the pursuer, and Ossaroo became the sole object of pursuit.  The shikaree would fain have made for the tree, to which the others were retreating; but the proboscis of the elephant was already so far advanced in that direction, that there was every probability it might get lapped upon him before he could climb beyond reach.  For a moment he was in a dilemma, and his customary coolness seemed to have forsaken him.  The elephant was advancing upon him, its little switch of a tail oscillating rapidly in the air, and its trunk stretched horizontally towards him, with Ossaroo's own arrow still sticking in it.  It seemed to know that it was he who had sent that skewer through its gristly snout--perhaps giving it far more pain than the leaden missiles that had flattened against its thick skull; and for this reason it had chosen him as the first victim of its vengeance.  In truth, Ossaroo's position was one of extreme peril--so much so that Karl and Caspar--now perceiving themselves comparatively safe from the pursuit--uttered a simultaneous cry: both believing that their faithful guide and follower was on the point of \"coming to grief.\"  Ossaroo seemed bewildered at the very imminence of the danger.  But it was only for a moment--only while he hesitated as to whether he should try to reach the tree.  On perceiving that he could not do this with a fair chance of safety, he turned and ran in an opposite direction.  Whither?  To the obelisk.  Yes, by good fortune, the pillar from which he had just descended was only ten paces distant; and Ossaroo, in returning towards it, measured the ground with less than five.  Flinging away his now useless weapons, he clutched hold of the prominent points of the rock, and \"swarmed\" up it like a squirrel.  He had good occasion to employ all his powers of agility.  A second-- half a second more--and he would have been too late: for ere he had reached the summit of the pillar, the digit point of the elephant's trunk was inserted under the skirt of his tunic; and had the garment been of tougher material; Ossaroo would have been jerked back to the ground more rapidly than he had ascended.  As it was, the cotton fabric--frail from long wear and exposure--gave way with a loud \"screed;\" and although the shikaree was stripped of his coat-tail, and suffered a rather ignominious exposure, still he had the satisfaction of knowing that to this circumstance he was indebted for the safety of his skin.    CHAPTER TEN.  OSSAROO ON THE OBELISK.  The moment after, Ossaroo stood upon the summit of the obelisk.  But even there he was far from being confident of security: for the pursuer had not abandoned the hope of being able to reach him.  On the contrary, the infuriated animal, on finding itself baulked by the worthlessness of the fabric composing the skirt of the shikaree, spitefully tossed the piece of cloth from its trunk; and, rearing itself on its hind-legs, threw its body into an erect attitude, with its fore-feet resting high up against the rock.  One might have fancied that it was about to climb the obelisk; and this it would certainly have done had the thing been possible.  As it was, however, Ossaroo was not out of danger: for as the elephant stood on its hind-legs, with its prehensile proboscis extended to the full length, the tip of the latter was not more than six inches from the soles of his feet.  The shikaree stood upright like a statue on its pedestal--though unlike to a statue in his features, which were anything but unmoved.  On the contrary, his countenance exhibited the utmost consternation.  And no wonder: for he could plainly perceive that should the elephant succeed in lengthening its carcase only another twelve inches, he himself would be brushed from the summit like a fly.  In fearful suspense, therefore, did he stand, contemplating the monster which was making every effort to reach him.  These efforts were made with as much sagacity as energy.  Not only did the quadruped erect itself to its greatest height--standing, as one might say, upon its toes--but on finding that it was not tall enough, it fell back upon all fours, and then reared up afresh in an endeavour to stretch still higher.  Several times did it repeat the attempt--on each occasion trying a different side of the rock--as if in hopes that a greater elevation of the ground around the base might give it that advantage of twelve inches which it required for seizing its victim.  Fortunately for Ossaroo, the elephant had reached its very highest on first rearing up; and though it kept going round and round the rock, from no side could it do more than just touch with the top of its trunk the edge of the little flat space, upon which the feet of the shikaree were resting.  Ossaroo was beginning to be satisfied with this fact; and probably might have come to believe himself secure in his position, but for a circumstance that was making him uneasy.  It was, that, standing upon such a limited surface--a pedestal whose diameter was but little over the length of his own feet--he found it exceedingly difficult to keep his balance.  Had he been on the ground, there would have been no difficulty about it; but, perched as he was full twenty-feet aloft, the thing was quite different; and, with nerves unstrung by the fearful danger that threatened him below, it was just as much as he could do to keep his equilibrium.  Though only a \"mild Hindoo,\" Ossaroo was possessed of a high degree of courage; and, most of his life having been spent as a shikaree, he had become well inured to the risk of losing it.  Had he been a coward, or unused to such perils as at that moment surrounded him, he would in all likelihood have succumbed through fear; and toppled helplessly over upon the shoulders of the merciless monster that was threatening to destroy him.  With all his bravery, however, it was just as much as he could do to keep his balance.  Unfortunately, in climbing up the rock, he had been compelled to abandon his boar-spear: else with that he might have supported himself.  His long knife was still in his belt; and this he drew forth--not with the design of using it upon his antagonist, but only the better to balance himself.  It is true he would have been fain to take a chop or two at the gristly proboscis of the elephant; but he dared not bend his body into a stooping attitude, lest his centre of gravity might get beyond the supporting base, and thus bring about the result he dreaded.  No other course remained for him, than to preserve his body in an upright attitude; and, conscious of this fact, he braced his nerves to the utmost, and maintained himself erect and rigid as a statue of bronze.    CHAPTER ELEVEN.  A WHOLESALE TUMBLE.  In this attitude he remained for several minutes--the elephant all the while continuing its efforts to reach him Karl and Caspar, seated upon the branches of the tree, to which they had retreated, were witnesses of the whole scene from beginning to end.  The situation of Ossaroo would have bean sufficiently ludicrous for Caspar to have laughed at it, but for the danger in which the shikaree was placed.  This was so evident, that instead of indulging in anything akin to levity, Caspar looked on with feelings of deep anxiety, Karl being equally apprehensive about the result.  Neither could do anything to aid or rescue him, as they were unarmed--both having dropped their pieces when ascending the tree.  I have said that Karl was as uneasy about the result as his brother.  He was even more so.  It was not that he liked Ossaroo better, or would have more bitterly lamented his fate, had the latter perished by the proboscis of the elephant.  No, that was not the reason; but simply that Karl more clearly comprehended the danger in which the shikaree was placed.  After watching the efforts of the elephant for a short time, Caspar had become convinced that the animal could not reach Ossaroo--so long as the latter preserved his balance upon the summit of the rock.  Karl was equally satisfied of this; and both by their shouts kept encouraging the shikaree to stand firm.  But Karl soon noted another circumstance, which was as yet unperceived by Caspar, and it was this that was inspiring him with keener apprehension than that felt by his brother.  He had noticed that, each time as the elephant erected himself against the obelisk, the rock seemed slightly to shake.  Ossaroo was himself well aware of the circumstance--and more troubled at it than any of them--for it rendered it more difficult for him to preserve his equilibrium.  Caspar at length also observed the trembling of the rock, but it gave him no particular uneasiness: as, after what had passed, he felt confident that Ossaroo would be able to keep his place.  Nor was it the fear of his falling in that way that was distressing the young botanist; but rather a deduction which he drew from the circumstance, not apparent to the less philosophic mind of his brother.  The shaking of the rock had suggested to Karl a dangerous contingency. What was it?  The speech addressed by him at that moment to Caspar will explain.  \"Oh, brother!\" he exclaimed, on perceiving the danger, \"if the rock should fall--\"  \"No danger of that,\" said Caspar, interrupting him; \"it stands firm enough.  True, I see it shake a little, but only a very little; and that only when the brute springs up against it.  No danger, I should think!\"  \"But I fear there is clanger,\" rejoined Karl,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21239"],["title","The Cliff Climbers (#7)"],["body"," a tone of undiminished anxiety.  \"Not,\" added he, \"so long as the elephant acts as he is doing; but he may not continue thus.  These creatures are wonderfully sagacious; and if he only perceives that the pillar moves under his weight, a new idea may get into his brain, and then it will be all up with Ossaroo.\"  \"Ha!  I begin to comprehend you,\" said Caspar, beginning to share the alarm of his brother.  \"There is danger in that.  What is to be done? If we only had our guns up here, we might open fire on the brute. Whether we succeeded in killing him or not, we might at all events divert his attention from Ossaroo, and perhaps hinder him from thinking of the plan you speak of.  We might go down and get our guns.  What is to hinder us?--the elephant is too busy to notice us.\"  \"True--an excellent idea of yours, brother Caspar.\"  \"Well, then, to put it in execution.  I shall slip down to the ground; you follow to the lowest branch, and I can hand the guns up to you. Keep steady, and don't you fear, Ossy!\" added the young hunter in a louder voice, addressing himself to the shikaree.  \"We'll fetch him away from you directly--we'll tickle him with an ounce or two of lead through that thick hide of his.\"  So saying, Caspar commenced letting himself rapidly down from branch to branch, Karl following more leisurely.  Caspar had got upon the lowest limb of the tree, and Karl on that immediately above it, when a loud crash, accompanied by a piercing shriek, arrested the progress of both, causing them suddenly to turn their faces towards the obelisk.  During the short time that their eyes had been averted from it, a complete change had taken place in that curious tableau.  Instead of a tall column of stone, standing twenty-feet perpendicular, the same column was now seen lying along the earth in a nearly horizontal position, with a huge mass of broken boughs and branches of trees crushed under its top.  Near its base, now upturned and standing almost vertically, was the elephant, no longer on its hind feet, nor yet on all fours, but down upon its back, kicking its huge hoofs in the air, and making the most stupendous efforts to recover its legs.  Ossaroo was nowhere to be seen!  The contingency dreaded by Karl had come to pass.  The elephant, finding it impossible to reach the shikaree with its trunk--and no doubt judging by the \"feel\" that the rock was not immobile--had at length dropped down on all fours and, placing its broad shoulder against it, backed by the enormous weight of its bulky body, had sent the column crashing among the tops of a chestnut tree growing near--the trunk of which, yielding to the weight, gave way with a crash, and trunk, limbs, and branches were all borne downward to the earth!  The elephant itself, not calculating that it should find the task so easy of performance, had fallen at the same time--its cumbrous body losing balance by the impetus which it had thrown into the effort.  In short, of the four objects that formed the tableau--rock and tree, quadruped and man--not one was standing any longer in its place--for it is superfluous to say that Ossaroo had gone down with the obelisk.  But where was Ossaroo?  That was the question that occurred to both Karl and Caspar.  \"Oh! brother!\" groaned Caspar, \"I fear he is killed!\"  Karl made no reply; but for all that, Caspar's reflection, delivered in a loud tone, was not left without rejoinder.  Directly after the phrase had issued from his lips, an answer was heard proceeding from among the branches of the fallen chestnut tree, in a voice and with words that caused the hearts of the brothers to beat with joy.  \"No, young sahibs,\" replied the unseen Ossaroo; \"me no killee, me no bit damage.  If I only can get pass de old rogue, I safe and sound as ibber. Here go for run!\"  At the same moment the shikaree was seen shooting out from among the branches under which he had been for the time buried; and, then running with all his might towards the tree upon which the brothers had found refuge.  Long before the elephant could regain its feet, Ossaroo had reached a position of perfect security among the upper branches of the great tree; which Karl and Caspar, no longer thinking of their guns, had also re-ascended.    CHAPTER TWELVE.  A RING PERFORMANCE.  As the tree into which they had retreated was a very large one, there was no longer any present fear of danger from the elephant, however furious the latter might be; and they could look down upon it and watch its movements with a feeling of perfect security.  The only one of the party that was in dangerous proximity to that dreaded proboscis was Fritz; but Fritz had already been well warned of the wicked designs of the great brute, and was sufficiently swift-footed and sage enough to give the animal a wide berth.  As for the elephant itself, having recovered its feet, it stood for some seconds flapping its huge ears, and apparently in a kind of quandary--as if taken aback by the unexpected accident that had befallen it.  Not for long, however, did it continue in this tranquil attitude.  The arrow still sticking in its trunk reminded it of its purposes of vengeance. Once more angrily elevating its tail, and sounding its shrill trumpet, it rushed towards the fallen tree, and buried its long proboscis among the branches.  One by one it turned them over, as if in search of some object.  It was searching for the shikaree.  After a time it desisted from this manoeuvre, and looked around-- evidently with a puzzled air, and wondering what had become of the man. It had not seen him as he rushed towards the great tree: for his retreat had been made while the creature was sprawling upon its back.  Just then Fritz chanced to show himself--crouching under the branches upon which his masters had taken refuge, and evidently envying them their secure situation.  The sight of Fritz was enough.  It was he who had first challenged the elephant on its approach through the woods, and had conducted it under that terrible battery of bullets and arrows.  As soon, therefore, as the latter set eyes upon the dog, its fury not only became rekindled, but apparently redoubled; and, hoisting its tail on high, it charged full tilt upon its original adversary.  Had the assailant been a boar, or even a bull, no doubt Fritz would have stood his ground, or only swerved to one side, the better to elude the onset, and make an attack in turn.  But with a quadruped as big as a house--and of which Fritz, not being of Oriental origin, knew so little; and of that little nothing that was good--one, too, evidently provided with most formidable weapons, a tongue several feet long, and tusks in proportion--it is not to be wondered at, nor is it any great blot upon his escutcheon, that Fritz turned tail and fled.  So fast fled he, that in less than a score of seconds he was out of sight--not only of his masters in the tree, but of his pursuer, the elephant.  The latter only followed him for some half-dozen lengths of its own carcase; and seeing that the pursuit was likely to be a wild-goose chase, declined following Fritz any farther.  They in the tree, as the elephant started after the dog, were in hopes that the pursuit might carry the dangerous animal to some distance, and thus give them time to get back to the ground, and make their escape from the spot.  In this, however, they were doomed to disappointment; for having desisted from the chase of the dog, the great pachyderm returned to the point from whence it had started; and, after once more tossing the broken branches of the fallen chestnut tree upon the point of its proboscis, it commenced pacing round and round the fallen obelisk, keeping in regular circles, as if it were training itself for some performance in an amphitheatre.  For more than an hour did the brute continue this circular promenade, at intervals stopping to give utterance to its shrieking note; but most of the time moving on in sullen silence.  Now and then it directed its eyes, and once or twice its trunk, towards the branches of the prostrate tree as if it had still some suspicion that he who sent that stinging arrow was there concealed.  Indeed, it appeared by its movements to be keeping guard over that particular spot, lest its enemy should escape. It had long since extracted the arrow, by placing its great foot upon the shaft, and drawing it forth.  Fritz had stolen back to the edge of the thicket, but kept cowering so close that the elephant could not see him.  The parties perched above were more than annoyed by their imprisonment thus procrastinated, and began to think of how they might set themselves free.  They talked of making a rush to possess themselves of their guns; but to Karl this appeared too perilous to be attempted.  It was not twenty yards from the tree to the spot where rested the dismounted monolith; and the elephant, whose eye was in a state of continual activity, could not fail to see them descending from the branches.  The massive creature, though it moved about with apparently a gentle griding step, could go almost as fast as a galloping horse; and should it espy them in time, there would be but slight chance of eluding its prehensile trunk.  Moreover, the sight of them--even should they succeed in regaining the tree--would rekindle its rage, and cause it to prolong its stay upon the ground.  There was yet another consideration that influenced them to remain patiently on their perch.  They knew that they had provided themselves with only a very limited quantity of ammunition.  That article had become scarce with them; and they had prudently determined to economise it.  Karl had only two bullets left, with just powder enough to make two charges; while Caspar's horn and pouch were not better filled.  They might fire their whole stock of lead into the elephant, and still not succeed in killing a creature that sometimes walks off triumphantly with a score of bullets \"under his belt.\"  These shots might"]]]
