It would not be surprising to find one here.  Rather, I may say, it _is_ not: for now I feel certain what we have just seen is an elephant, since it can be nothing else.  He may have entered this valley before us--by straying up the glacier as we did, and crossing the chasm by the rock bridge--which I know he could have done as well as we.  Or else,\" continued Karl, in his endeavour to account for the presence of the huge creature, \"he may have come here long ago, even before there was any crevasse.  What is there improbable in his having been here many years--perhaps all his life, and that may be a hundred years or more?\"  \"I thought,\" said Caspar, \"that elephants were only found on the plains, where the vegetation is tropical and luxuriant.\"  \"That is another popular error,\" replied Karl.  \"So far from affecting tropical plains, the elephant prefers to dwell high up on the mountains; and whenever he has the opportunity, he climbs thither.  He likes a moderately cool atmosphere--where he may be less persecuted by flies and other troublesome insects: since, notwithstanding his great strength and the thickness of his hide, so small a creature as a fly can give him the greatest annoyance.  Like the tiger, he is by no means exclusively a tropical animal; but can live, and thrive too, in a cool, elevated region, or in a high latitude of the temperate zone.\"  Karl again expressed surprise that none of them had before that time observed any traces of this gigantic quadruped, that must have been their neighbour ever since the commencement of their involuntary residence in the valley.  Of course this surprise was fully shared by Caspar.  Ossaroo participated in it, but only to a very slight degree. The shikaree was still inclined towards indulging in his superstitious belief that the creature they had seen was not of the earth, but some apparition of Brahma or Vishnu.  Without attempting to combat this absurd fancy, his companions continued to search for an explanation of the strange circumstance of their not having sooner encountered the elephant.  \"After all,\" suggested Caspar, \"there is nothing so strange about it. There are many large tracts of the valley we have not explored; for instance, that wide stretch of black forest that lies at its upper end. Neither of us has ever been through there since the first two days, when we followed the deer all round, and went afterwards to examine the cliff.  For myself, I never strayed that way while hunting--because I always found the game in the open grounds near the lake.  Now the elephant may have his lair in that piece of forest, and only come out at night.  As for tracks, no doubt there are plenty, but I never thought of looking for them.  You know, brother, we have been too busy in making our tree-bridge, and afterwards exploring the cavern, to think of much else.\"  Karl admitted the truth of these observations; for it was as Caspar had alleged.  During the whole time of their residence in the valley, the minds of all three, filled with anxiety about the future, had been keenly bent upon devising some means of escape; and on this account they had given very little attention to anything that did not in some way contribute to that end.  Even Caspar, in his hunting excursions, had not gone over one-half of the valley; nor had these excursions been very numerous.  In three or four days he had procured as much _meat_ as was necessary.  This had been carefully cured by Ossaroo, and formed the staple of their daily food.  Only upon rare occasions were the guns afterwards used to procure a little fresh provision--such as a brace of wild duets from the lake, or one of the smaller game animals which could be found almost any morning within gunshot distance of the hut.  For these reasons many parts of the valley had been left unvisited; and it was deemed possible enough for even a great elephant to have been all the time dwelling within its boundaries, unseen by any of the party. Indulging in these conjectures, all three remained awake for more than an hour; but as the subject of their speculations appeared to have gone altogether away, they gradually came to the conclusion that he was not going to return at least for that night--and their confidence being thus restored, they once more betook themselves to sleep--resolved in future to keep a sharp lookout for the dangerous neighbour that had so unexpectedly presented himself to their view.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  RE-STOCKING THE GUNS.  Next morning all three were astir betimes, and out of the hut by the earliest light of day.  Karl and Caspar were anxious to obtain more definite information about the elephant, whose existence Ossaroo was still inclined to doubt.  Indeed, with the exception of the three or four shrieking whistles to which the animal had given utterance, so silently and mysteriously had he come and departed, that they might almost have fancied the whole thing a dream.  But such an immense creature could not move about, without leaving some traces of his presence; and as he had crossed the stream, or rather a little embayment of the lake into which the stream emptied itself, no doubt his tracks would be found on the sandy shore.  As soon, therefore, as the day broke, all three started for the spot where the creature had been seen to cross.  On reaching it, they could no longer doubt that an elephant had paid them a visit.  Huge footprints--nearly as big as the bottom of a bushel measure--were deeply indented in the soft sand; and looking across the \"straits\" (for so they were in the habit of calling the narrow mouth of the bay), they could see other similar tracks on the opposite shore, where the animal had waded out.  Ossaroo was no longer doubtful as to the character of the creature that had made those tracks.  He had hunted elephants in the jungles of Bengal, and knew all the peculiarities of the grand quadruped.  Such footmarks as were now under his eyes could not have been made by a mere visionary animal, but only by a real elephant in the flesh.  \"And one of the biggest kind,\" asserted the shikaree, now speaking in full confidence, and declaring, at the same time, that he could tell its height to an inch.  \"How can you do that?\" asked Caspar, in some surprise.  \"Me berra easy tell, young sahib,\" replied Ossaroo; \"only need takee size ob de rogue's foot.  Dis way, sahibs.\"  Saying this, the shikaree drew forth from one of his pockets a piece of string; and, choosing one of the tracks which had made the clearest impression, he carefully applied the string around its outer edge.  In this way the circumference of the elephant's foot was obtained.  \"Now, sahibs,\" said Ossaroo, holding the string between his fingers-- that portion of it which had been applied around the footprint--\"_twice_ the length of dis reachee to the top of he shoulder; that how Ossaroo know he biggee elephant.\"  The circumference of the foot thus measured being nearly six feet, it would follow, from the rule laid down by the shikaree, that the elephant in question was nearly twelve feet high; and this Karl knew to be one of the largest.  Nor did Karl question the correctness of the deduction: for he had often heard, from hunters whose word was not to be doubted, that the height of an elephant is exactly twice the circumference of his foot.  Ossaroo, having now yielded up his belief--that the elephant was one of his gods in disguise--declared with full confidence that the animal was a _rogue_.  Karl needed no explanation of what was meant by this.  He knew that the rogue elephant is an old male, who, for some reason or other--perhaps for bad behaviour--has had the cold shoulder given him by the rest of the herd, and from whose association he has been driven away.  Thus _cut_ by his former acquaintances, he is compelled to lead a solitary life--the consequence of which is, that he becomes exceedingly spiteful and morose in his disposition, and will not only attack any other animal that may chance to cross his path, but will even seek them out, as if for the mere purpose of indulging in a spirit of revenge! There are many such in the jungles of India, as well as in Africa; and, since man himself is not excepted from this universal hostility, a rogue elephant is regarded as an exceedingly dangerous creature in the neighbourhood where he takes up his abode.  There are many instances recorded--and well authenticated too--where human beings have been sacrificed to the fury of these gigantic monsters: and cases are known where a rogue elephant has purposely placed himself in waiting by the side of a frequented path, with the object of destroying the unwary traveller!  In the valley of the Dheira Doon an elephant of this class-- one, too, that had once been tamed, but had escaped from his servitude-- is known to have taken the lives of nearly twenty unfortunate people before his destruction could be effected.  Well knowing these proclivities on the part of the _rogue_, Ossaroo at once counselled caution in the future movements of all--a counsel which Karl was too prudent to reject; and even the bold, rash Caspar did not think it proper to dissent from.  It was resolved, therefore, before continuing their projected exploration of the cliffs, to set their weapons once more in proper order--against any chance of an encounter with the elephant.  Their guns had to be re-stocked, and a new handle put into the axe--as well as a shaft into the boar-spear of Ossaroo--for all the woodwork of these weapons had been broken up and burnt into ashes in the manufacture of the candles of bear's-grease that had lighted them out of the cave.  The search after the ledges must necessarily be postponed; until they could go upon that errand properly armed and equipped, against any enemy that might oppose their progress.  Having come to this wise determination, they returned "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21239"],["title","The Cliff Climbers (#5)"],["body","their hut; kindled a fire; cooked breakfast; and having despatched the meal, at once set about selecting pieces of wood for the various purposes for which they were required.  They had no difficulty in procuring just what was wanted: for the valley contained many valuable sorts of timber; and several kinds that had been already cut for other purposes, now well seasoned and ready to hand, were found lying about the hut.  Setting about their work in earnest, and labouring diligently from morning to night--and even into the night hours--they knew they would not be long in accomplishing a task so trifling as the stocking of a gun, or putting the handle to a boar-spear.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  INSPECTING THE CLIFFS.  Working diligently with their knives two days sufficed to make guns, axe, and spear as good as ever.  Ossaroo also made himself a new bow and a full quiver of arrows.  On the third morning, after breakfasting, all three set out with the determination not to leave any portion of the cliff unexamined.  The part which lay between their hut and the cave, Karl had already scrutinised with great care; so they went direct to the point where he had left off, and there commenced their new survey.  It is true they had already examined the cliffs all around; but this was just after they arrived in the valley, and the purpose of that exploration was very different from that of the present one.  Then they were only looking for a place by which they might climb out; and the idea of making ladders had not occurred to them.  Now that this scheme had suggested itself, they entered upon their second survey with the view of ascertaining whether it was practicable or possible.  Consequently, they went in search of facts of a different nature--viz., to see if there existed a series of ledges, one above another, that could be spanned by an equal number of such ladders as they might be able to construct.  That they could make ladders of a prodigious length--allowing sufficient time for the execution of the work--all felt confident.  They knew that the Thibet pine-trees--the same sort as they had used in making the bridge for the glacier crevasse--grew in great numbers not far from their hut; and by selecting some of the slenderest trunks of these, they would have the sides of as many ladders as they might want, almost ready made, and each forty or fifty feet in length.  If there should only be discovered a series of ledges, with not more than forty feet space between each two, there would be a fair hope of their being able to escalade the cliff, and escape from a place which, although one of the pleasantest-looking spots in the world, had now become to them loathsome as the interior of a dungeon.  Sure enough, and to the great joy of all, such a set of shelves was soon after presented to their eyes--having, at least in appearance, all the requirements of which they were in search.  The spaces between no two of them appeared to be greater than thirty feet, some were much nearer to each other.  The part of the cliff where these terraces were found was not quite so low, as that where Karl had made his measurement.  It did not appear, however, to be more than three hundred and fifty feet--a fearful height, it is true--but nothing when compared with other sections of the same precipice.  To reach to its top, more than a dozen ladders would be required--each between twenty and thirty feet in length.  The labour of making these ladders, with such tools as they had, might be looked upon as something stupendous--sufficient, you might suppose, to deter them from the task.  But you must endeavour to realise the situation in which they were placed--with no other hope of being delivered from their mountain prison--and with this idea in your mind, you will comprehend why they should have been willing to undertake even a far greater labour.  Of course, they did not expect to complete it in a day, neither in a week, nor in a month: for they well knew that it would take several months to make the number of ladders that would be required.  And then there would be the additional labour of getting each into its place: as all, after the first one, would have to be carried up the cliff to the ledge for which it should be constructed.  Indeed, to raise ladders of thirty feet in the manner contemplated, would seem an impossibility-- that is, for such strength or mechanism as they could command.  And so it might have proved, had they intended to make these ladders of the ordinary weight.  But they foresaw this difficulty, and hoped to get over it by making them of the very lightest kind--something that would just carry the weight of a man.  Becoming more than half satisfied that at this point the precipice might be scaled in the manner contemplated, they remained upon the ground in order to give it a thorough examination.  That done, they intended to make the complete circuit of the valley, and ascertain whether there might not be some other place still easier of ascent.  The point where they had halted was behind the tract of heavily-timbered forest--of which Caspar had spoken, and which up to this time none of them had entered.  Between the trees and the cliff they were now contemplating, there was a narrow strip of ground destitute of timber; and covered with a shingle of loose stones which had fallen from the mountain above.  Several boulders of large dimensions rested upon the ground, at short distances apart; and there was one of a pillar-shape that stood some twenty-feet high, while it was only about five or six in diameter.  It bore a sort of rude resemblance to an obelisk; and one might easily have fancied that the hand of man had accomplished its erection.  For all that, it was a mere freak of Nature, and had probably been set up by ancient glacier ice.  Up one of its sides there was a series of projections, by which an active man might climb to the top; and Ossaroo _did_ climb it, partly out of playfulness, and partly, as he said, to get a better view of the cliff.  The shikaree stayed only a few minutes on its top; and his curiosity having been satisfied, he had let himself down again.    CHAPTER NINE.  A RECONNOISSANCE INTERRUPTED.  Though the three had set out that morning with a wholesome dread of the elephant, and a determination to go about their reconnoissance with caution, their joy at the discovery of the ledges, and the eagerness with which they were scanning them, had for the moment banished from their minds all thoughts of the great quadruped.  They were thinking only of ledges and ladders, and talking loudly of how the latter might best be made and placed upon the former.  Just then, and just at the moment Ossaroo descended from the obelisk rock, Fritz, who had been prowling about among the trees, set up a fearful baying--such another as that to which he had given utterance on the night when the elephant had paid its visit to the hut.  There was a certain intonation of terror in the dog's voice--as if whatever called it forth was something that inspired him with fear.  The apprehension that it was the elephant occurred to all three at once; and with a simultaneous impulse they faced towards the spot whence the baying of the dog appeared to proceed.  Simultaneously, too, they clutched more firmly their respective weapons--Karl his rifle, Caspar his double-barrel, and Ossaroo his bow, with an arrow at the string.  It is superfluous to say, that there was a certain amount of consternation visible in the countenances of all three; which was rather increased than diminished by the sight of Fritz dashing suddenly out of the underwood, and running towards them at full speed, with his tail considerably below the horizontal.  Fritz, moreover, was giving utterance to something that very closely resembled a howl.  The dog had evidently been attacked by some animal that had put him to flight; and his masters knew that it must be a formidable creature that was causing the variant Fritz to behave in such an ignominious manner.  They were not kept long in doubt as to the character of Fritz's conqueror and pursuer: for close behind his hips, almost touching them, appeared a long, cylindrical, or trumpet-shaped object, of a bluish-grey colour, protruding between two yellowish crescents, like a pair of huge ivory horns.  Behind those appeared a pair of large ears, like flaps of sole leather; and in the rear of these last appendages came the round, massive form of an enormous elephant!  Crashing through the underwood, the monstrous creature soon cleared his body from the timber, and rushed straight across the open ground-- winding his terrible trumpet as he went.  He was following Fritz as straight as he could go, and evidently enraged at the dog.  The latter, on escaping from the tangle of the thicket, made direct for the spot occupied by his masters--thus directing the elephant upon them.  It was no longer a question of protecting Fritz from his formidable pursuer; for the elephant, on seeing three adversaries more worthy of his tusks, seemed to forget all about the puny four-footed creature who had provoked him; and at once directed his attack upon the upright bipeds--as if resolved to punish them for the misbehaviour of their subordinate.  The three, standing close together, saw at a glance that Fritz was no longer the object of the elephant's animosity: for the massive monster was now charging directly down upon them.  There was no time for concerted counsel--neither to take nor to give it. Each had to act upon his own instinct; and following this each acted. Karl sent the bullet from his rifle right between the tusks of the advancing foe; while Caspar fired both barrels of his piece \"bang\" into the forehead of the monster.  Ossaroo's arrow was seen sticking through the elephant's trunk; and the moment after Ossaroo's heels were presented to the enemy.  Karl and Caspar also ran: for it would have been sheer madness to have remained a"]]]
