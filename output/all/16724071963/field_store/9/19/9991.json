Correct?\"  Rak nodded, a little stiffly. \"Essentially correct, Miss Farn.\"  \"Well,\" Trigger said, \"I can't blame you for worrying a bit. How about your Guard Captain? Isn't it all right to ask him about reinforcements?\"  Rak pursed his lips. \"Yes. And I did. This morning. Before I called you.\"  \"What did he say?\"  Rak grimaced unhappily. \"He implied, Miss Farn, that his present guard complement could handle any emergency. How would he know?\"  \"That's his job,\" Trigger pointed out gently. The Juniors did look badly worried. \"He didn't have any helpful ideas?\"  \"None,\" said Rak. \"He said that if someone wanted to put up the money to hire a battle squad of Special Federation Police, he could always find some use for them. But that's hopeless, of course.\"  Trigger straightened up. She reached out and poked Rak's bony chest with a finger tip. \"You know something?\" she said. \"It's not!\"  The four faces lit up together.  \"The fact is,\" Trigger went on, \"that I'm handling the Project budget until someone shows up to take over. So I think I'll just buy you that Federation battle squad, Rak! I'll get on it right away.\" She stood up. The Juniors bounced automatically out of their chairs. \"You go tell your guard Captain,\" she instructed them from the hall door, \"there'll be a squad showing up in time for dinner tonight.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Federation Police Office in Ceyce informed Trigger that a Class A Battle Squad--twenty trained men with full equipment--would report for two months' duty at the Colonial School during the afternoon. She made them out a check and gave it the Ruya Farn signature via telewriter. The figure on that check was going to cause some U-League auditor's eyebrows to fly off the top of his head one of these days; but if the League insisted on remaining aloof to the problems of its Plasmoid Project, a little financial anguish was the least it could expect in return.  Trigger felt quite cheerful for a while.  Then she had a call from Precol's Maccadon office. She was requested to stand by while a personal interstellar transmission was switched to her ComWeb.  It looked like her day! She hummed softly, waiting. She knew just one individual affluent enough to be able to afford personal interstellar conversations; and that was Commissioner Tate. Fast work, Plemp, she thought approvingly.  But it was Brule Inger's face that flashed into view on the ComWeb. Trigger's heart jumped. Her breath caught in her throat.  \"Brule!\" she yelled then. She shot up out of her chair. \"Where are you calling from?\"  Brule's eyes crinkled around the edges. He gave her the smile. The good old smile. \"Unfortunately, darling, I'm still in the Manon System.\" He blinked. \"What happened to your hair?\"  \"Manon!\" said Trigger. She started to settle back, weak with disappointment. Then she shot up again. \"Brule! Lunatic! You're blowing a month's salary a minute on this! I love you! Switch off, fast!\"  Brule threw back his head and laughed. \"You haven't changed much in two months, anyway! Don't worry. It's for free. I'm calling from the yacht of a friend.\"  \"Some friend!\" Trigger said, startled.  \"It isn't costing her anything either. She had to transmit to the Hub today anyway. Asked me if I'd like to take over the last few minutes of contact and see if I could locate you.... Been missing me properly, Trigger?\"  Trigger smiled. \"Very properly. Well, that was lovely of her! Someone I know?\"  \"Hardly,\" said Brule. \"Nelauk arrived a week or so after you left. Nelauk Pluly. Her father's the Pluly Lines. Let's talk about you. What's the silver-haired idea?\"  \"Got talked into it,\" she told him. \"It's all the rage again right now.\" He surveyed her critically. \"I like you better as a redhead.\"  \"So do I.\" Oops, Trigger thought. Security, girl! \"So I'll change back tonight,\" she went on quickly. \"Golly, Brule. It's nice to see that homely old mug again!\"  \"Be a lot nicer when it won't have to be over a transmitter.\"  \"Right you are!\"  \"When are you coming back?\"  She shook her head glumly. \"Don't know.\"  He was silent a moment. \"I've had to take a bit of chitchat now and then,\" he remarked, \"about you and old Tate vanishing together.\"  Trigger felt herself coloring. \"So don't take it,\" she said shortly. \"Just pop them one!\"  The smile returned. \"Wouldn't be gentlemanly to pop a lady, would it?\"  She smiled back. \"So stay away from the ladies!\" Somehow Brule and Holati Tate never had worked up a really warm regard for each other. It had caused a little trouble before.  \"Okay to tell me where you are?\" he asked.  \"Afraid not, Brule.\"  \"Precol Home Office apparently knows,\" he pointed out.  \"Apparently,\" Trigger admitted.  They looked at each other a moment; then Brule grinned. \"Well, keep your little secret!\" he said. \"All I really want to know is when you're getting back.\"  \"Very soon, I hope, Brule,\" Trigger said unhappily. Then there was a sudden burst of sound from the ComWeb--gusts of laughing, chattering voices; a faint wash of music. Brule glanced aside.  \"Party going on,\" he explained. \"And here comes Nelauk! She wanted to say hello to you.\"  A dozen feet behind him, a figure strolled gracefully into view on the screen and came forward. A slender girl with high-piled violet hair and eyes that very nearly matched the hair's tint. She was dressed in something resembling a dozen blossoms--blossoms which, in Trigger's opinion, had been rather carelessly scattered. But presumably it was a very elegant party costume. She was quite young, certainly not yet twenty.  Brule laid a brotherly hand on a powdered shoulder. \"Meet Trigger, Nelauk!\"  Nelauk murmured it was indeed an honor, one she had long looked forward to. The violet eyes blinked sleepily at Trigger.  Trigger gave her a great big smile. \"Thanks so much for arranging for the call. I've been wondering how Brule was doing.\"  Wrong thing to say, probably, she thought. She was right. Nelauk reached for it with no effort.  \"Oh, he's doing wonderfully!\" she assured Trigger without expression. \"I'm keeping an eye on him. And this small favor--it was the very least I could do for Brule. For you, too, of course, Trigger dear.\"  Trigger held the smile firmly.  \"Thanks so much, again!\" she said.  Nelauk nodded, smiled back and drifted gracefully off the screen. Brule blew Trigger a kiss. \"They'll be cutting contact now. See you very, very soon, Trigger, I hope.\"  His image vanished before she could answer.  She paced her office, muttering softly. She went over to the ComWeb once, reached out toward it and drew her hand back again.  Better think this over.  It might not be an emergency. Brule didn't exactly chase women. He let them chase him now and then. Long before she left Manon, Trigger had discovered without much surprise, that the wives, daughters and girl friends of visiting Hub tycoons were as susceptible to the Inger charm as any Precol clerks. The main difference was that they were a lot more direct about showing it.  It hadn't really worried her. In fact, she found Brule's slightly startled reports of maneuverings of various amorous Hub ladies very entertaining. But she had put in a little worrying about something else. Brule's susceptibility seemed to be more to the overwhelming mass display of wealth with which he was suddenly in almost constant contact. Many of the yachts he went flitting around among as Precol's representative were elaborate spacegoing palaces, and it appeared Brule Inger was soon regarded as a highly welcome guest on most of them.  Brule talked about that a little too much.  Trigger resumed her pacing.  Little Nelauk mightn't be twenty yet, but she'd flipped out a challenge just now with all the languid confidence of a veteran campaigner. Which, Trigger thought cattily, little Nelauk undoubtedly was.  And a girl, she added cattily, whose father represented the Pluly Lines did have some slight reason for confidence....  \"Miaow!\" she reproved herself. Nelauk, to be honest about it, was also a dish.  But if she happened to be serious about Brule, the dish Brule might be tempted by was said Pluly Lines.  Trigger went over to the window and looked down at the exercise quadrangle forty floors below.  \"If he's that much of a meathead!\" she thought.  He could be that much of a meathead. He was also Brule. She went back to her desk and sat down. She looked at the ComWeb. A girl had a right to consider her own interests.  And there was the completely gruesome possibility now that Holati Tate might call in at any moment, give her an entirely reasonable, satisfactory, valid, convincing explanation for everything that had happened lately--and then show her why it would be absolutely necessary for her to stay here a while longer.  If it was a choice between inconveniencing Holati Tate and losing that meathead Brule--  Trigger switched on the ComWeb.     4   The head of the personnel department of Precol's Maccadon office said, \"You don't want me, Argee. That's not my jurisdiction. I'll connect you with Undersecretary Rozan.\"  Trigger blinked. \"Under--\" she began. But he'd already cut off.  She stared at the ComWeb, feeling a little shaken. All she'd done was to say she wanted to apply for a transfer! Undersecretary Rozan was one of Precol's Big Four. For a moment, Trigger had an uncanny notion. Some strange madness was spreading insidiously through the Hub. She shook the thought off.  A businesslike blonde showed up in the screen. She might be about thirty-five. She smiled a small, cold smile.  \"Rozan,\" she said. \"You're Trigger Argee. I know about you. What's the trouble?\"  Trigger looked at her, wondering. \"No trouble,\" she said. \"Personnel just routed me through to you.\"  \"They've been instructed to do so,\" said Rozan."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21510"],["title","Legacy (#5)"],["body"," \"Go ahead.\"  \"I'm on detached duty at the moment.\"  \"I know.\"  \"I'd like to apply for a transfer back to my previous job. The Manon System.\"  \"That's your privilege,\" said Rozan. She half turned, swung a telewriter forward and snapped it into her ComWeb. She glanced out at Trigger's desk. \"Your writer's connected, I see. We'll want thumbprint and signature.\"  She slid a form into her telewriter, shifted it twice as Trigger deposited thumbprint and signature and drew it out. \"The application will be processed promptly, Argee. Good day.\"  Not a gabby type, that Rozan.  If not gabby, the Precol blonde was a woman of her word. Trigger had just started lunch when the office mail-tube receiver tinkled brightly at her. She reached in, took out a flat plastic carrier, snapped it open. The paper that unfolded itself in her hand was her retransfer application.  At the bottom of the form was stamped \"Application Denied,\" followed by the signature of the Secretary of the Department of Precolonization, Home Office, Evalee.  Trigger's gaze shifted incredulously from the signature to the two words, and back. They'd taken the trouble to get that signature transmitted from Evalee just to make it clear that there were no heads left to be gone over in the matter. Precol was not transferring her back to Manon. That was final. Then she realized that there was a second sheet attached to the application form.  On it in handwriting were a few more words: \"In accordance with the instructions of Commissioner Tate.\" And a signature, \"Rozan.\" And three final words: \"Destroy this note.\"  Trigger crumpled up the application in one hand. Her other hand darted to the ComWeb.  Then she checked herself. To fire an as-of-now resignation back at Precol had been the immediate impulse. But something, some vague warning chill, was saying it might be a very poor impulse to follow.  She sat back to think it over.  It was very probable that Undersecretary Rozan disliked Holati Tate intensely. A lot of the Home Office big shots disliked Holati Tate. He'd stamped on their toes more than once--very justifiably; but he'd stamped. The Home Office wouldn't go an inch out of its way to do something just because Commissioner Tate happened to want it done.  So somebody else was backing up Commissioner Tate's instructions.  Trigger shook her head helplessly.  The only somebody else who _could_ give instructions to the Precolonization Department was the Council of the Federation!  And how could the Federation possibly care what Trigger Argee was doing? She made a small, incredulous noise in her throat.  Then she sat there a while, feeling frightened.  The fright didn't really wear off, but it settled down slowly inside her. Up on the surface she began to think again.  Assume it's so, she instructed herself. It made no sense, but everything else made even less sense. Just assume it's so. Set it up as a practical problem. Don't worry about the why....  The problem became very simple then. She wanted to go to Manon. The Federation--or something else, something quite unthinkable at the moment but comparable to the Federation in power and influence--wanted to keep her here.  She uncrumpled the application, detached Rozan's note, tore up the note and dropped its shreds into the wall disposal. That obligation was cancelled. She didn't have any other obligations. She'd liked Holati Tate. When all this was cleared up, she might find she still liked him. At the moment she didn't owe him a thing.  Now. Assume they hadn't just blocked the obvious route to Manon. They couldn't block all routes to everywhere; that was impossible. But they could very well be watching to see that she didn't simply get up and walk off. And they might be very well prepared to take quite direct action to stop her from doing it.  She would, Trigger decided, leave the method she'd use to get out of the Colonial School unobserved to the last. That shouldn't present any serious difficulties.  Once she was outside, what would she do?  Principally, she had to buy transportation. And that--since she had no intention of spending a few months on the trip, and since a private citizen didn't have the ghost of a chance at squeezing aboard a Federation packet on the Manon run--was going to be expensive. In fact, it was likely to take the bulk of her savings. Under the circumstances, however, expense wasn't important. If Precol refused to give her back her job when she showed up on Manon, a number of the industrial outfits preparing to move in as soon as the plant got its final clearance would be very happy to have her. She'd already turned down a dozen offers at considerably more than her present salary.  So ... she'd get off the school grounds, take a tube strip into downtown Ceyce, step into a ComWeb booth, and call Grand Commerce transportation for information on the earliest subspace runs to Manon.  She'd reserve a berth on the first fast boat out. In the name of--let's see--in the name of Birna Drellgannoth, who had been a friend of hers when they were around the age of ten. Since Manon was a Precol preserve, she wouldn't have to meet the problem of precise personal identification, such as one ran into when booking passage to some of the member worlds.  The ticket office would have her thumbprints then. That was unavoidable. But there were millions of thumbprints being deposited every hour of the day on Maccadon. If somebody started checking for her by that method, it should take them a good long while to sort out hers.  Next stop--the Ceyce branch of the Bank of Maccadon. And it was lucky she'd done all her banking in Ceyce since she was a teen-ager, because she would have to present herself in person to draw out her savings. She'd better lose no time getting to the bank either. It was one place where theoretical searchers could expect her to show up.  She could pay for her ship reservation at the bank. Then to a store for some clothes and a suitcase for the trip....  And, finally, into some big middle-class hotel where she would stay quietly until a few hours before the ship was due to take off.  That seemed to cover it. It probably wasn't foolproof. But trying to work out a foolproof plan would be a waste of time when she didn't know just what she was up against. This should give her a running start, a long one.  When should she leave?  Right now, she decided. Commissioner Tate presumably would be informed that she had applied for a transfer and that the transfer had been denied. He knew her too well not to become suspicious if it looked as if she were just sitting there and taking it.  She got her secretary on the ComWeb.  \"I'm thinking of leaving the office,\" she said. \"Anything for me to take care of first?\"  It was a safe question. She'd signed the day's mail and checks before lunch.  \"Not a thing, Miss Farn.\"  \"Fine,\" said Ruya Farn. \"If anyone wants me in the next three or four hours, I'll be either down in the main library or out at the lake.\"  And that would give somebody two rather extensive areas to look for her, if and when they started to look--along with the fact that, for all anyone knew, she might be anywhere between those two points.  A few minutes later, Trigger sauntered, humming blithely, into her room and gave it a brief survey. There were some personal odds and ends she would have liked to take with her, but she could send for them from Manon.  The Denton, however, was coming along. The little gun had a very precisely calibrated fast-acting stunner attachment, and old Runser Argee had instructed Trigger in its use with his customary thoroughness before he formally presented her with the gun. She had never had occasion to turn the stunner on a human being, but she'd used it on game. If this cloak and dagger business became too realistic, she'd already decided she would use it as needed.  She slipped the Denton into the side pocket of a lightweight rain robe, draped the robe over her arm, slung her purse beside it, picked up the sun hat and left the room.  The Colonial School's kitchen area was on one of the underground levels. Unless they'd modified their guard system very considerably since Trigger had graduated, that was the route by which she would leave.  As far as she could tell they hadn't modified anything. The whole kitchen level looked so unchanged that she had a moment of nostalgia. Groups of students went chattering along the hallways between the storerooms and the cooking and processing plants. The big mess hall, Trigger noticed in passing, smelled as good as it always had. Bells sounded the end of a period and a loudspeaker system began directing Class so and so to Room such and such. Standing around were a few uniformed guards--mainly for the purpose of helping out newcomers who had lost their direction.  She came out on the equally familiar big and brightly lit platform of the loading ramp. Some sixty or seventy great cylindrical vans floated alongside the platform, most of them disgorging their contents, some still sealed.  Trigger walked unhurriedly down the ramp, staying in the background, observing the movements of two ramp guards and marking four vans which were empty and looked ready to go.  The driver of the farthest of the four empties stood in the back of his vehicle, a few feet above the platform. When Trigger came level with him, he was studying her. He was a big young man with tousled black hair and a rough-and-ready look. He was grinning very faintly. He knew the ways of Colonial School students.  Trigger raised her left hand a few inches, three fingers up. His grin widened. He shook his head and raised both hands in a corresponding gesture. Eight fingers.  Trigger frowned at him, stopped and looked back along the row of vans. Then left hand up again--four fingers and thumb.  The driver made a circle with finger and thumb. A deal, for five Maccadon crowns. Which was about standard fare for unauthorized passage out of the school.  Trigger wandered on to "]]]
