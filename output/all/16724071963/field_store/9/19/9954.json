The latter examined it carefully and       deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire,       took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary       grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling       hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling       and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from       the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable       since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.        When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.        “The Parisian police,” he said, “are exceedingly able in their       way. They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly       versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to       demand. Thus, when G—— detailed to us his mode of searching the       premises at the Hotel D——, I felt entire confidence in his having       made a satisfactory investigation—so far as his labors extended.”        “So far as his labors extended?” said I.        “Yes,” said Dupin. “The measures adopted were not only the best       of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the       letter been deposited within the range of their search, these       fellows would, beyond a question, have found it.”        I merely laughed—but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.        “The measures, then,” he continued, “were good in their kind, and       well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to       the case, and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious       resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to       which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by       being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand; and many a       schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I knew one about eight       years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of ‘even and       odd’ attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is       played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of       these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or       odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he       loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the       school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay       in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his       opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and,       holding up his closed hand, asks, ‘are they even or odd?’ Our       schoolboy replies, ‘odd,’ and loses; but upon the second trial he       wins, for he then says to himself, ‘the simpleton had them even       upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just       sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will       therefore guess odd;’—he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a       simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus:       ‘This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and,       in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first       impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first       simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is       too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting       it even as before. I will therefore guess even;’—he guesses even,       and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his       fellows termed ‘lucky,’—what, in its last analysis, is it?”        “It is merely,” I said, “an identification of the reasoner’s       intellect with that of his opponent.”        “It is,” said Dupin; “and, upon inquiring of the boy by what       means he effected the thorough identification in which his       success consisted, I received answer as follows: ‘When I wish to       find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is       any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the       expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance       with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or       sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or       correspond with the expression.’ This response of the schoolboy       lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been       attributed to Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and       to Campanella.”        “And the identification,” I said, “of the reasoner’s intellect       with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright,       upon the accuracy with which the opponent’s intellect is       admeasured.”        “For its practical value it depends upon this,” replied Dupin;       “and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by       default of this identification, and, secondly, by       ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the       intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only their       own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden,       advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They       are right in this much—that their own ingenuity is a faithful       representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the       individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the       felon foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above       their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no       variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when       urged by some unusual emergency—by some extraordinary reward—they       extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without       touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of       D——, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all       this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the       microscope and dividing the surface of the building into       registered square inches—what is it all but an exaggeration of       the application of the one principle or set of principles of       search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding       human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his       duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for       granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,—not exactly in       a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg—but, at least, in some       out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of       thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a       gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see also, that       such recherchés nooks for concealment are adapted only for       ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary       intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the       article concealed—a disposal of it in this recherché manner,—is,       in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its       discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether       upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers;       and where the case is of importance—or, what amounts to the same       thing in the political eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,—the       qualities in question have never been known to fail. You will now       understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined       letter been hidden any where within the limits of the Prefect’s       examination—in other words, had the principle of its concealment       been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect—its       discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question.       This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the       remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the       Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All       fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty       of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are       fools.”        “But is this really the poet?” I asked. “There are two brothers,       I know; and both have attained reputation in letters. The       Minister I believe has written learnedly on the Differential       Calculus. He is a mathematician, and no poet.”        “You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and       mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he       could not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the       mercy of the Prefect.”        “You surprise me,” I said, “by these opinions, which have been       contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at       naught the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical       reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.”        “‘Il y a à parièr,’” replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, “‘que       toute idée publique, toute convention reçue est une sottise, car       elle a convenue au plus grand nombre.’ The mathematicians, I       grant you, have done their best to promulgate the popular error       to which you allude, and which is none the less an error for its       promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a better cause, for       example, they have insinuated the term ‘analysis’ into       application to algebra. The French are the originators of this       particular deception; but if a term is of any importance—if words       derive any value from applicability—then ‘analysis’ conveys       ‘algebra’ about as much as, in Latin, ‘ambitus’ implies       ‘ambition,’ ‘_religio_’ ‘religion,’ or ‘_homines honesti_’ a set       of _honorable_ men.”        “You have a quarrel on hand, I see,” said I, “with some of the       algebraists of Paris; but proceed.”        “I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason       which is cultivated in any especial form other than the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2148"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 2 (#3)"],["body","logical. I dispute, in particular, the reason educed       by mathematical study. The mathematics are the science of form       and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to       observation upon form and quantity. The great error lies in       supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra,       are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious       that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been       received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth.       What is true of relation—of form and quantity—is often grossly       false in regard to morals, for example. In this latter science it       is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the       whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In the consideration of       motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have       not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their       values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which       are only truths within the limits of relation. But the       mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as       if they were of an absolutely general applicability—as the world       indeed imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned       ‘Mythology,’ mentions an analogous source of error, when he says       that ‘although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget       ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing       realities.’ With the algebraists, however, who are Pagans       themselves, the ‘Pagan fables’ are believed, and the inferences       are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an       unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet       encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of       equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point       of his faith that x2+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal       to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you       please, that you believe occasions may occur where x2+px is not       altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you       mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond       doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.        “I mean to say,” continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his       last observations, “that if the Minister had been no more than a       mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of       giving me this check. I know him, however, as both mathematician       and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with       reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew       him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I       considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial       modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate—and       events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate—the       waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen, I       reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His       frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the       Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses,       to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus       the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G——, in       fact, did finally arrive—the conviction that the letter was not       upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought,       which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now,       concerning the invariable principle of policial action in       searches for articles concealed—I felt that this whole train of       thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister.       It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks       of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to       see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would       be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes,       to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in       fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to       simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of       choice. You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect       laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was       just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its       being so very self-evident.”        “Yes,” said I, “I remember his merriment well. I really thought       he would have fallen into convulsions.”        “The material world,” continued Dupin, “abounds with very strict       analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has       been given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may       be made to strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a       description. The principle of the vis inertiæ, for example, seems       to be identical in physics and metaphysics. It is not more true       in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in       motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is       commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter,       that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more       constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of       inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more       embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of       their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the street       signs, over the shop-doors, are the most attractive of       attention?”        “I have never given the matter a thought,” I said.        “There is a game of puzzles,” he resumed, “which is played upon a       map. One party playing requires another to find a given word—the       name of town, river, state or empire—any word, in short, upon the       motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game       generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the       most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as       stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the       other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards       of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively       obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous       with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to       pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and       too palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears,       somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He       never once thought it probable, or possible, that the Minister       had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the       whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world       from perceiving it.        “But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and       discriminating ingenuity of D——; upon the fact that the document       must always have been at hand, if he intended to use it to good       purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect,       that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary’s       ordinary search—the more satisfied I became that, to conceal this       letter, the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and       sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.        “Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green       spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at       the Ministerial hotel. I found D—— at home, yawning, lounging,       and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last       extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic       human being now alive—but that is only when nobody sees him.        “To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented       the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I       cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while       seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host.        “I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he       sat, and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters       and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few       books. Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny,       I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion.        “At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a       trumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by       a dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the       middle of the mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four       compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a solitary       letter. This last was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn       nearly in two, across the middle—as if a design, in the first       instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless, had been altered,       or stayed, in the second. It had a large black seal, bearing the       D—— cipher _very_ conspicuously, and was addressed, in a       diminutive female hand, to D——, the minister, himself. It was       thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into       one of the uppermost divisions of the rack.        “No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to       be that of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all       appearance, radically different from the one of which the Prefect       had read us so minute a description. Here the seal was large and       black, with the D—— cipher; there it was small and red, with the       ducal arms of the S—— family. Here, the address, to the Minister,       diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain       royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone       "]]]
