Moving on at noon of the 21st of December, the traveller...  This page and the next page are missing.  This page and the previous page are missing.  His fellow-travellers considered it necessary to journey by night till they could reach a more hospitable part of the country.  They accordingly started as soon as the people in the village had gone to sleep.  The stillness of the air, the howling of the wild beasts and the deep solitude of the forest made the scene solemn and impressive.  Not a word, except in a whisper, was uttered; and his companions pointed out to him the wolves and hyaenas, as they glided like shadows from one thicket to another.  The inhabitants of Bondou are called Foulahs.  They are naturally of a mild and gentle disposition; but the uncharitable maxims of the Koran have made them less hospitable to strangers and more reserved in their behaviour than the Mandingoes.  Leaving Bondou, the caravan entered the kingdom of Kajaaga.  The inhabitants, whose complexion is jet-black, are called Serrawoollies. The _dooty_, or chief man of Joag, the frontier town, though a rigid Mahommedan, treated Park very civilly; but while he was staying there a party of horseman, sent by the king, arrived to conduct him to Maana, his residence.  When there, the king demanded enormous duties, and Park had to pay him the five drachms of gold which he had received from the King of Bondou, besides which his baggage was opened and everything of value taken.  His companions now begged him to turn back, and Johnson declared it would be impossible to proceed without money.  He had fortunately concealed some of his property; but they were afraid of purchasing provisions, lest the king should rob him of his few remaining effects.  They therefore resolved to combat hunger during the day and wait for another opportunity of obtaining food.  While seated on the ground, with his servant-boy by his side, a poor woman came up with a basket on her head, and asked Park if he had had his dinner.  The boy replied that the king's people had robbed him of all his money.  On hearing this the good old woman, with a look of unaffected benevolence, took the basket from her head, and presented him with a few handfuls of ground nuts, walking away before he had time to thank her.  Leaving Joag in company with thirty persons and six loaded asses, he rode on cheerfully for some hours till the caravan reached a species of tree for which Johnson had frequently inquired.  On seeing it he produced a white chicken which he had purchased at Joag, tied it by a leg to one of the branches, and then told his companions that they might safely proceed, as the journey would be prosperous.  This incident shows the power of superstition over the minds of negroes; for though this man had resided seven years in England, it was evident that he still retained the superstitions imbibed in his youth.  Koomakary was the birthplace of one of Park's companions from Pisania, a blacksmith, who had been attentive to him on the road.  On approaching the place shouts were raised and muskets were fired.  The meeting between the long-absent blacksmith and his relations was very tender. The younger ones having embraced him, his aged mother was led forth, leaning upon a staff.  Every one made way for her as she stretched out her hands to bid her son welcome.  Being totally blind, she stroked his arms, hands and face with great care, and seemed highly delighted that her ears once more could hear the music of his voice.  \"It was evident,\" observes Park, \"that, whatever may be the difference between the negro and European, there is none in the genuine sympathies and characteristic feelings of our common nature.\"  The king, Dembo Sego, gave the traveller an audience, and appeared well-disposed towards him.  An escort was also sent to conduct him to the frontiers of Kaarta.  The capital of that province was reached on the 12th of February, and as soon as he arrived a messenger came from the king, bidding him welcome, and a large hut was at once provided for his accommodation.  The people, however crowded in till it was completely full; when the first visitors went, another took their place--in this way the hut being filled and emptied thirteen different times.  Park found the king, whose name was Daisy, surrounded by a number of attendants, the fighting men on his right-hand and the women and children on his left.  A bank of earth, on which was spread a leopard-skin, formed the throne.  Daisy seemed perfectly satisfied with the account the traveller gave of himself, but warned him of the dangers in his way on account of the war which was then raging, and advised him to return to Kason, there to remain till it was over.  Wise as this advice was, the approaching hot months made it important for him to proceed, dreading as he did having to spend the rainy season in the interior of Africa.  Daisy presented him with food, and sent a party of horse men to conduct him to Jarra, while three of his sons, with about two hundred horsemen, undertook to accompany him part of the way.  He had evidence of the disturbed state of the country while staying at the next town he entered.  A body of Moors approached the gates and carried off the cattle, and one of the horsemen was shot by a Moor.  The wounded man was brought in, when, as he was borne along, his mother went before, clapping her hands and enumerating the good qualities of her son.  The ball had passed through both his legs, and as he and his friends would not consent to have one of them amputated, he died the same night.  Going forward, on the 18th they passed through Simbug, the frontier village of Ludamar.  It was from hence Major Haughton wrote his last letter, with a pencil, to Dr Laidley.  After leaving the place, when endeavouring to make his way across the desert, he was murdered by some savage Mahommedans, who robbed him of everything he possessed.  At this time, while Daisy was employed in fortifying a strong position among the hills, his territory was overrun by his enemy, Mansong.  On the evening of the 5th of March Park reached the town of Dalli.  Here the people crowded in so disagreeable a manner to see the white stranger, that his host proposed, in order to avoid them, going in the cool of the evening to a negro village called Samee, at a short distance off.  As he was now within two days' journey of the heathen kingdom of Goumba, he had no apprehensions from the Moors, and readily accepted the invitation.  His landlord was proud of the honour of entertaining a white man, and Park spent the forenoon very pleasantly with these poor negroes, their gentleness of manner presenting a striking contrast to the rudeness and barbarity of the Moors.  While thus enjoying himself, greatly to his dismay a party of Moorish soldiers suddenly appeared in the place.  They were sent, they said, by their chief, Ali, to convey the white stranger to his camp at Benowm. If he would come willingly it would be better for him, but come he must, as they had orders to convey him by force; because Fatima, Ali's wife, having heard much about Christians, was anxious to see one.  Park, unable to resist, was compelled to accompany them.  The journey occupied many days, during which both Park and his attendants suffered much from thirst.  On the evening of the 12th they came in sight of Benowm, which presented to the eye a number of dirty-looking tents scattered without order over a large space of ground.  Among the tents appeared large herds of camels, cattle and goats.  As soon as he was seen the people who were drawing water threw down their buckets and, rushing towards him, began to treat him with the greatest discourtesy; one pulled at his clothes, another took off his hat, while a third stopped him to examine his waistcoat buttons.  At length the king's tent was reached, where a number of men and women were assembled.  Ali was seated on a black leather cushion, clipping a few hairs from his upper lip, a female attendant holding up a looking-glass before him.  He enquired whether the stranger could speak Arabic, and being answered in the negative he remained silent.  The ladies, however, asked a thousand questions, inspected his apparel, searched his pockets, and obliged him to unbutton his waistcoat to display the whiteness of his skin.  In the evening the priests announced prayer.  Before they departed his Moorish guide told him that Ali was about to present him with something to eat.  On looking round he saw some boys bringing a wild hog, which they tied to one of the tent ropes, when Ali made signs to him to kill and dress it for supper.  Though very hungry, he did not think it prudent to eat any part of an animal so much detested by the Moors, and therefore replied that he never touched such food.  The hog was then untied, in the hopes that it would run at the stranger, the Moors believing that a great enmity subsists between hogs and Christians.  In this, however, they were disappointed, for the animal no sooner regained his liberty than he began to attack indiscriminately every person who came in his way, and at last took shelter under the couch upon which the king was sitting.  Park was after this conducted to a hut, where he found another wild hog--tied there to a stick for the purpose of annoying him.  It attracted a number of boys, who amused themselves by beating it with sticks, till they so irritated the animal that it ran and bit at every person within reach.  A number of people came in and made him take off his stockings to exhibit his feet, and then his jacket and waistcoat to show them how his clothes were put off and on.  Day after day he was treated in the same manner.  He was also compelled to undertake various offices.  First, he was told to shave the head of one of the young princes, but, unaccustomed to use a razor, he soon "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21391"],["title","Great African Travellers: From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley (#3)"],["body","the boy's skin, on seeing which the king ordered him to desist.  On the 18th his black servant, Johnson, was brought in as as a prisoner before Ali by some Moors, who had also seized a bundle of his clothes left at Jarra.  Of these Ali took possession, and Park was unable to obtain even a clean shirt or anything he required.  The Moors next stripped him of his gold, his watch, the amber he had remaining and one of his pocket compasses.  Fortunately he had hidden the other in the sand near his hut.  This, with the clothes on his back, was the only thing Ali now left him.  Ali, on examining the compass, wished to know why the small needle always pointed to the Great Desert.  Park, unwilling to inform him of the exact truth, replied that his mother lived far beyond the sands of the Sahara, and that while she was alive the piece of iron would always point that way and serve as a guide to conduct him to her.  Ali, suspecting that there was something magical in it, was afraid of keeping so dangerous an instrument in his possession.  The Moors now held a council to determine what should be done with the stranger.  Some proposed that he should be put to death, others that he should only lose his right-hand, and one of Ali's sons came to him in the evening and with much concern informed him that his uncle had persuaded his father to put out his eyes.  Ali, however, replied that he would not do so until Fatima, the queen, who was at present in the north, had seen him.  In vain Park begged that he might be permitted to return to Jarra.  Ali replied that he must wait till Fatima had seen him, and that then he should be at liberty to go, and that his horse should be restored to him.  So wearied out was he at last with all the insults he received that he felt ready to commit any act of desperation.  One day Ali sent to say that he must be in readiness to ride out with him, as he intended to show him to some of his women.  They together visited the tents of four different ladies, at every one of which he was presented with a bowl of milk and water.  They were all remarkably corpulent, which in that country is the highest mark of beauty.  They were also very inquisitive, examining minutely his hair and skin, though affecting to consider him as a sort of inferior being to themselves, and pretending to shudder when they looked at the whiteness of his skin. Notwithstanding the attention shown him by these fat dames, his condition was not improved, and he was often left without even food or water, while suffering fearfully from the heat.  Ali at length moved his camp, and Park was sent forward under the escort of one of the king's sons.  The new encampment was larger than that of Benowm, and situated in the midst of a thick wood, about two miles distant from a neighbouring town, called Bubaka.  Here Park was introduced to queen Fatima by Ali.  She seemed much pleased at his coming, shaking hands with him, even though Ali had told her that he was a Christian.  She was a remarkably corpulent woman, with an Arab cast of countenance and long hair.  After asking a number of questions, with the answers to which she appeared interested, she became perfectly at her ease and presented her visitor with a bowl of milk.  She was, indeed, the only person who treated Park kindly during his stay.  Both men and cattle suffered much from thirst, and though Ali had given him a skin for containing water, and Fatima once or twice presented him with a small supply, yet such was the barbarous disposition of the Moors, that when his boy attempted to fill his skin at the wells, he generally received a sound drubbing for his presumption.  One night, having in vain attempted to obtain water, he resolved to try his fortune himself at the wells, which were about half a mile distant.  About midnight he set out, and, guided by the lowing of the cattle, he reached the place.  Here a number of Moors were drawing water, but he was driven by them from each well in succession.  At last he reached one where there was only an old man and two boys.  He earnestly besought the first to give him some water.  The old man complied, and drew up a bucket; but no sooner did Park take hold of it than, recollecting that the stranger was a Christian, and fearing that his bucket might be polluted, he dashed the water into the trough, and told him to drink from thence. Though the trough was none of the largest, and three cows were already drinking in it, Park knelt down, and, thrusting his head between two of the cows, drank with intense pleasure till the water was nearly exhausted.  The rainy season was now approaching, when the Moors evacuate the country of the negroes and return to the skirts of the Great Desert.  Ali looked upon Park as a lawful prisoner, and though Fatima allowed him food and otherwise treated him kindly, she had as yet said nothing about his release.  Fortunately for him, Ali had resolved to send an expedition to Jarra, of two hundred Moorish horsemen, to attack Daisy.  Park obtained permission to accompany them, and, through the influence of Fatima, he also received back his bundle of clothes and his horse.  On the 26th of May, accompanied by Johnson and his boy Demba, he set out with a number of Moors on horseback, Ali having gone on before.  On his way Ali's chief slave came up and told Demba that Ali was to be his master in future; then, turning to Park, said, \"The boy goes back to Bubaka, but you may take the old fool,\" meaning Johnson, \"with you to Jarra.\"  Park in vain pleaded for Demba, but the slave only answered that if he did not mount his horse he would send him back likewise. Poor Demba was not less affected than his master.  Having shaken hands with the unfortunate boy, and assured him that he would do everything in his power to redeem him, Park saw him led off by three of Ali's slaves.  At Jarra he took up his lodgings in the house of an old acquaintance, Dayman, whom he requested to use his influence with Ali to redeem the boy, and promised him a bill on Dr Laidley for the value of two slaves the moment he brought him to Jarra.  Ali, however, considering the boy to be Park's principal interpreter, would not liberate him, fearing that he would be instrumental in conducting him to Bambarra.  Still Park was eager, if possible, to continue his journey, but Johnson refused to proceed further.  At the same time he foresaw that he must soon fall a victim to the Moors if he remained where he was, and that if he went forward singly he must encounter great difficulties, both from the want of an interpreter and the means of purchasing food.  On the other hand he was very unwilling to return to England without accomplishing his mission.  He therefore determined to escape on the first opportunity at all risks.  This arrived sooner than he expected.  On the 26th of June news was brought that Daisy had taken Simbug, and would be at Jarra the next day.  Hearing this, the people began packing up their property and beating corn for their journey, and early in the morning nearly half had set off--the women and children crying, the men looking sullen and dejected.  Though Park was sure of being well treated could he make himself known to Daisy, yet as he might be mistaken for a Moor in the confusion, he thought it wisest to mount his horse with a large bag of corn before him, and to ride away with the rest of the townspeople.  He again fell in with his friend Dayman and Johnson.  They pushed on two days' journey to the town of Queira.  While Park was out tending his horse in the fields on the 1st of July, Ali's chief slave and four Moors arrived at Queira, and Johnson, who suspected the object of their visit, sent two boys to overhear their conversation.  From them he learned that the Moors had come to convey Park back to Bubaka.  This was a terrible stroke to him, and, now convinced that Ali intended to detain him for ever in captivity, or perhaps to take his life, he determined at all risks to attempt making his escape.  He communicated his design to Johnson, who, though he approved of it, showed no inclination to accompany him.  Park therefore resolved to proceed by himself, and to trust to his own resources.
