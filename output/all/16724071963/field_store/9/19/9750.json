We are used to books about the Mexican War, and similar topics, books where there are plenty of words and expressions in Mexican-Spanish.  In this book there are equally plenty of words and expressions in Africaans, the variety of Dutch spoken originally by the Boers (Boors in this book), the Dutch farmers.  The book is a very good introduction to the animals, both mammals and birds, of South Africa.  The snakes get a mention, too.  Several very tense moments are built up, and you will be wondering right up to the very last moment how whoever is involved in the story, is going to get out of the situation.  Recommended as perhaps one of the best books by this prolific author. NH ________________________________________________________________________  THE BUSH BOYS HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAPE FARMER AND HIS FAMILY  BY CAPTAIN MAYNE REID    CHAPTER ONE.  THE BOORS.  Hendrik Von Bloom was a _boor_.  My young English reader, do not suppose that I mean any disrespect to Mynheer Von Bloom, by calling him a \"boor.\"  In our good Cape colony a \"boor\" is a farmer.  It is no reproach to be called a farmer.  Von Bloom was one--a Dutch farmer of the Cape--a boor.  The boors of the Cape colony have figured very considerably in modern history.  Although naturally a people inclined to peace, they have been forced into various wars, both with native Africans and Europeans; and in these wars they have acquitted themselves admirably, and given proofs that a pacific people when need be can fight just as well as those who are continually exulting in the ruffian glory of the soldier.  But the boors have been accused of cruelty in their wars--especially those carried on against the native races.  In an abstract point of view the accusation might appear just.  But when we come to consider the provocation, received at the hands of these savage enemies, we learn to look more leniently upon the conduct of the Cape Dutch.  It is true they reduced the yellow Hottentots to a state of slavery; but at that same time, we, the English, were transporting ship-loads of black Guineamen across the Atlantic, while the Spaniards and Portuguese were binding the Red men of America in fetters as tight and hard.  Another point to be considered is the character of the natives with whom the Dutch boors had to deal.  The keenest cruelty inflicted upon them by the colonists was mercy, compared with the treatment which these savages had to bear at the hands of their own despots.  This does not justify the Dutch for having reduced the Hottentots to a state of slavery; but, all circumstances considered, there is no one of the maritime nations who can gracefully accuse them of cruelty.  In their dealings with the aborigines of the Cape, they have had to do with savages of a most wicked and degraded stamp; and the history of colonisation, under such circumstances, could not be otherwise then full of unpleasant episodes.  Young reader, I could easily defend the conduct of the boors of Cape colony, but I have not space here.  I can only give you my opinion; and that is, that they are a brave, strong, healthy, moral, peace-loving, industrious race--lovers of truth, and friends to republican freedom--in short, a noble race of men.  Is it likely, then, when I called Hendrik Von Bloom a boor, that I meant him any disrespect?  Quite the contrary.  But Mynheer Hendrik had not always been a boor.  He could boast of a somewhat higher condition--that is, he could boast of a better education than the mere Cape farmer usually possesses, as well as some experience in wielding the sword.  He was not a native of the colony, but of the mother country; and he had found his way to the Cape not as a poor adventurer seeking his fortune, but as an officer in a Dutch regiment then stationed there.  His soldier-service in the colony was not of long duration.  A certain cherry-cheeked, flaxen-haired Gertrude--the daughter of a rich boor--had taken a liking to the young lieutenant; and he in his turn became vastly fond of her.  The consequence was, that they got married.  Gertrude's father dying shortly after, the large farm, with its full stock of horses, and Hottentots, broad-tailed sheep, and long-horned oxen, became hers.  This was an inducement for her soldier-husband to lay down the sword and turn \"vee-boor,\" or stock farmer, which he consequently did.  These incidents occurred many years previous to the English becoming masters of the Cape colony.  When that event came to pass, Hendrik Von Bloom was already a man of influence in the colony and \"field-cornet\" of his district, which lay in the beautiful county of Graaf Reinet.  He was then a widower, the father of a small family.  The wife whom he had fondly loved,--the cherry-cheeked, flaxen-haired Gertrude--no longer lived.  History will tell you how the Dutch colonists, discontented with English rule, rebelled against it.  The ex-lieutenant and field-cornet was one of the most prominent among these rebels.  History will also tell you how the rebellion was put down; and how several of those compromised were brought to execution.  Von Bloom escaped by flight; but his fine property in the Graaf Reinet was confiscated and given to another.  Many years after we find him living in a remote district beyond the great Orange River, leading the life of a \"trek-boor,\"--that is, a nomade farmer, who has no fixed or permanent abode, but moves with his flocks from place to place, wherever good pastures and water may tempt him.  From about this time dates my knowledge of the field-cornet and his family.  Of his history previous to this I have stated all I know, but for a period of many years after I am more minutely acquainted with it. Most of its details I received from the lips of his own son, I was greatly interested, and indeed instructed, by them.  They were my first lessons in _African zoology_.  Believing, boy reader, that they might also instruct and interest you, I here lay them before you.  You are not to regard them as merely fanciful.  The descriptions of the wild creatures that play their parts in this little history, as well as the acts, habits, and instincts assigned to them, you may regard as true to Nature.  Young Von Bloom was a student of Nature, and you may depend upon the fidelity of his descriptions.  Disgusted with politics, the field-cornet now dwelt on the remote frontier--in fact, beyond the frontier, for the nearest settlement was an hundred miles off.  His \"kraal\" was in a district bordering the great Kalihari desert--the Saara of Southern Africa.  The region around, for hundreds of miles, was uninhabited, for the thinly-scattered, half-human Bushmen who dwelt within its limits, hardly deserved the name of inhabitants any more than the wild beasts that howled around them.  I have said that Von Bloom now followed the occupation of a \"trek-boor.\" Farming in the Cape colony consists principally in the rearing of horses, cattle, sheep, and goats; and these animals form the wealth of the boor.  But the stock of our field-cornet was now a very small one. The proscription had swept away all his wealth, and he had not been fortunate in his first essays as a nomade grazier.  The emancipation law, passed by the British Government, extended not only to the Negroes of the West India Islands, but also to the Hottentots of the Cape; and the result of it was that the servants of Mynheer Von Bloom had deserted him.  His cattle, no longer properly cared for, had strayed off.  Some of them fell a prey to wild beasts--some died of the _murrain_.  His horses, too, were decimated by that mysterious disease of Southern Africa, the \"horse-sickness;\" while his sheep and goats were continually being attacked and diminished in numbers by the earth-wolf, the wild hound, and the hyena.  A series of losses had he suffered until his horses, oxen, sheep, and goats, scarce counted altogether an hundred head.  A very small stock for a vee-boor, or South African grazier.  Withal our field-cornet was not unhappy.  He looked around upon his three brave sons--Hans, Hendrik, and Jan.  He looked upon his cherry-cheeked, flaxen-haired daughter, Gertrude, the very type and image of what her mother had been.  From these he drew the hope of a happier future.  His two eldest boys were already helps to him in his daily occupations; the youngest would soon be so likewise.  In Gertrude,--or \"Truey,\" as she was endearingly styled,--he would soon have a capital housekeeper. He was not unhappy therefore; and if an occasional sigh escaped him, it was when the face of little Truey recalled the memory of that Gertrude who was now in heaven.  But Hendrik Von Bloom was not the man to despair.  Disappointments had not succeeded in causing his spirits to droop.  He only applied himself more ardently to the task of once more building up his fortune.  For himself he had no ambition to be rich.  He would have been contented with the simple life he was leading, and would have cared but little to increase his wealth.  But other considerations weighed upon his mind-- the future of his little family.  He could not suffer his children to grow up in the midst of the wild plains without education.  No; they must one day return to the abodes of men, to act their part in the drama of social and civilised life.  This was his design.  But how was this design to be accomplished?  Though his so-called act of _treason_ had been pardoned, and he was now free to return within the limits of the colony, he was ill prepared for such a purpose.  His poor wasted stock would not suffice to set him up within the settlements.  It would scarce keep him a month.  To return would be to return a beggar!  Reflections of this kind sometimes gave him anxiety.  But they also added "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21237"],["title","The Bush Boys: History and Adventures of a Cape Farmer and his Family (#1)"],["body","to his disposition, and rendered him more eager to overcome the obstacles before him.  During the present year he had been very industrious.  In order that his cattle should be provided for in the season of winter he had planted a large quantity of maize and buckwheat, and now the crops of both were in the most prosperous condition.  His garden, too, smiled, and promised a profusion of fruits, and melons, and kitchen vegetables.  In short, the little homestead where he had fixed himself for a time, was a miniature oasis; and he rejoiced day after day, as his eyes rested upon the ripening aspect around him.  Once more he began to dream of prosperity-- once more to hope that his evil fortunes had come to an end.  Alas!  It was a false hope.  A series of trials yet awaited him--a series of misfortunes that deprived him of almost everything he possessed, and completely changed his mode of existence.  Perhaps these occurrences could hardly be termed _misfortunes_, since in the end they led to a happy result.  But you may judge for yourself, boy reader, after you have heard the \"history and adventures\" of the \"trek-boor\" and his family.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE \"KRAAL.\"  The ex-field-cornet was seated in front of his _kraal_--for such is the name of a South African homestead.  From his lips protruded a large pipe, with its huge bowl of _meerschaum_.  Every boor is a smoker.  Notwithstanding the many losses and crosses of his past life, there was contentment in his eye.  He was gratified by the prosperous appearance of his crops.  The maize was now \"in the milk,\" and the ears, folded within the papyrus-like husks, looked full and large.  It was delightful to hear the rustling of the long green blades, and see the bright golden tassels waving in the breeze.  The heart of the farmer was glad as his eye glanced over his promising crop of \"mealies.\"  But there was another promising crop that still more gladdened his heart--his fine children. There they are--all around him.  Hans--the oldest--steady, sober Hans, at work in the well-stocked garden; while the diminutive but sprightly imp Jan, the youngest, is looking on, and occasionally helping his brother.  Hendrik--the dashing Hendrik, with bright face and light curling hair--is busy among the horses, in the \"horse-kraal;\" and Truey--the beautiful, cherry-cheeked, flaxen-haired Truey--is engaged with her pet--a fawn of the springbok gazelle--whose bright eyes rival her own in their expression of innocence and loveliness.  Yes, the heart of the field-cornet is glad as he glances from one to the other of these his children--and with reason.  They are all fair to look upon,--all give promise of goodness.  If their father feels an occasional pang, it is, as we have already said, when his eye rests upon the cherry-cheeked, flaxen-haired Gertrude.  But time has long since subdued that grief to a gentle melancholy.  Its pang is short-lived, and the face of the field-cornet soon lightens up again as he looks around upon his dear children, so full of hope and promise.  Hans and Hendrik are already strong enough to assist him in his occupations,--in fact, with the exception of \"Swartboy,\" they are the only help he has.  Who is Swartboy?  Look into the horse-kraal, and you will there see Swartboy engaged, along with his young master Hendrik, in saddling a pair of horses.  You may notice that Swartboy appears to be about thirty years old, and he is full that; but if you were to apply a measuring rule to him, you would find him not much over four feet in height!  He is stoutly built however, and would measure better in a horizontal direction.  You may notice that he is of a yellow complexion, although his name might lead you to fancy he was black--for \"Swartboy\" means \"black-boy.\"  You may observe that his nose is flat and sunk below the level of his cheeks; that his cheeks are prominent, his lips very thick, his nostrils wide, his face beardless, and his head almost hairless--for the small kinky wool-knots thinly-scattered over his skull can scarcely be designated hair.  You may notice, moreover, that his head is monstrously large, with ears in proportion, and that the eyes are set obliquely, and have a Chinese expression.  You may notice about Swartboy all those characteristics that distinguish the \"Hottentots\" of South Africa.  Yet Swartboy is _not_ a Hottentot--though he is of the same race.  He is a _Bushman_.  How came this wild Bushman into the service of the ex-field-cornet Von Bloom?  About that there is a little romantic history.  Thus:--  Among the savage tribes of Southern Africa there exists a very cruel custom,--that of abandoning their aged or infirm, and often their sick or wounded, to die in the desert.  Children leave their parents behind them, and the wounded are often forsaken by their comrades with no other provision made for them beyond a day's food and a cup of water!  The Bushman Swartboy had been the victim of this custom.  He had been upon a hunting excursion with some of his own kindred, and had been sadly mangled by a lion.  His comrades, not expecting him to live, left him on the plain to die; and most certainly would he have perished had it not been for our field-cornet.  The latter, as he was \"trekking\" over the plains, found the wounded Bushman, lifted him into his wagon, carried him on to his camp, dressed his wounds, and nursed him till he became well.  That is how Swartboy came to be in the service of the field-cornet.  Though gratitude is not a characteristic of his race, Swartboy was not ungrateful.  When all the other servants ran away, he remained faithful to his master; and since that time had been a most efficient and useful hand.  In fact, he was now the only one left, with the exception of the girl, Totty--who was, of course, a Hottentot; and much about the same height, size, and colour, as Swartboy himself.  We have said that Swartboy and the young Hendrik were saddling a pair of horses.  As soon as they had finished that job, they mounted them, and riding out of the kraal, took their way straight across the plain.  They were followed by a couple of strong, rough-looking dogs.  Their purpose was to drive home the oxen and the other horses that were feeding a good distance off.  This they were in the habit of doing every evening at the same hour,--for in South Africa it is necessary to shut up all kinds of live-stock at night, to protect them from beasts of prey.  For this purpose are built several enclosures with high walls,--\"kraals,\" as they are called,--a word of the same signification as the Spanish \"corral,\" and I fancy introduced into Africa by the Portuguese--since it is not a native term.  These kraals are important structures about the homestead of a boor, almost as much so as his own dwelling-house, which of itself also bears the name of \"kraal.\"  As young Hendrik and Swartboy rode off for the horses and cattle, Hans, leaving his work in the garden, proceeded to collect the sheep and drive them home.  These browsed in a different direction; but, as they were near, he went afoot, taking little Jan along with him.  Truey having tied her pet to a post, had gone inside the house to help Totty in preparing the supper.  Thus the field-cornet was left to himself and his pipe, which he still continued to smoke.  He sat in perfect silence, though he could scarce restrain from giving expression to the satisfaction he felt at seeing his family thus industriously employed.  Though pleased with all his children, it must be confessed he had some little partiality for the dashing Hendrik, who bore his own name, and who reminded him more of his own youth than any of the others.  He was proud of Hendrik's gallant horsemanship, and his eyes followed him over the plain until the riders were nearly a mile off, and already mixing among the cattle.  At this moment an object came under the eyes of Von Bloom, that at once arrested his attention.  It was a curious appearance along the lower part of the sky, in the direction in which Hendrik and Swartboy had gone, but apparently beyond them.  It resembled a dun-coloured mist or smoke, as if the plain at a great distance was on fire!  Could that be so?  Had some one fired the _karoo_ bushes?  Or was it a cloud of dust?  The wind was hardly strong enough to raise such a dust, and yet it had that appearance.  Was it caused by animals?  Might it not be the dust raised by a great herd of antelopes,--a migration of the springboks, for instance?  It extended for miles along the horizon, but Von Bloom knew that these creatures often travel in flocks of greater extent than miles.  Still he could not think it was that.  He continued to gaze at the strange phenomenon, endeavouring to account for it in various ways.  It seemed to be rising higher against the blue sky--now resembling dust, now like the smoke of a widely-spread conflagration, and now like a reddish cloud.  It was in the west, and already the setting sun was obscured by it.  It had passed over the sun's disc like a screen, and his light no longer fell upon the plain. Was it the forerunner of some terrible storm?--of an earthquake?  Such a thought crossed the mind of the field-cornet.  It was not like an ordinary cloud,--it was not like a cloud of dust,--it was not like smoke.  It was like nothing he had ever witnessed before.  No wonder that he became anxious and apprehensive.  All at once the dark-red mass seemed to envelope the cattle upon the plain, and these could be seen running to and fro as if affrighted. Then the two riders disappeared under its dun shadow!  Von Bloom rose to his feet, now seriously alarmed.  What could it mean?  The exclamation to which he gave utterance brought little Truey and Totty from the house; and Hans with Jan had now got back with the sheep and goats.  All saw the singular phenomenon, but none of them could tell what it was.  All were in a state of alarm.  As they stood gazing, with hearts full of fear, the two"]]]
