In any event, Mr. Ellsworth's perplexities, and to some extent his anxieties, had come to an end when Mr. Temple had announced that Temple Camp was to have a city office and a paid manager for the conduct of its affairs, which had theretofore been looked after by himself and the several trustees and, to some extent, by Jeb Rushmore, former scout and plainsman, who made his home at the camp and was called its manager.  Whether Jeb had fulfilled all the routine requirements may be a question, but he was the spirit of the camp, the idol of every boy who visited it, and it was altogether fitting that he should be relieved of the prosy duties of record-keeping which were now to be relegated to the little office in Mr. Temple's big bank building in Bridgeboro.  So it was arranged that Tom should work as a sort of assistant to Mr. Burton in the Temple Camp office and, like Jeb Rushmore, if he fell short in some ways (he couldn't _touch_ a piece of carbon paper without getting his fingers smeared) he more than made up in others, for he knew the camp thoroughly, he could describe the accommodations of every cabin, and tell you every by-path for miles around, and his knowledge of the place showed in every letter that went out over Mr. Burton's name.  From the window, high up on the ninth floor, Tom could look down behind the big granite bank building upon a narrow, muddy place with barrel staves for a sidewalk and tenements with conspicuous fire escapes, and washes hanging on the disorderly roofs. This was Barrel Alley, where Tom had lived and where his poor, weary mother had died. He could pick out the very tenement. Strangely enough, this spot of squalor and unhappy memories held a certain place in his affection even now.  Tom and Mr. Burton and Miss Ellison, the stenographer, were the only occupants of the little office, but Mr. Temple usually came upstairs from the bank each day to confer with Mr. Burton for half an hour or so.  There was also another visitor who was in the habit of coming upstairs from the bank and spending many half hours lolling about and chatting. This was Roscoe Bent, a young fellow who was assistant something-or-other in the bank and whose fashionable attire and worldly wisdom caused Tom to stand in great awe of him.  Roscoe made no secret of the fact that he came up in order to smoke cigarettes, which practice was forbidden down in the bank. He would come up, smoke a cigarette, chat a while, and then go down again. He seemed to know by inspiration when Mr. Burton and Mr. Temple were going to be there. Up to the morning of this very day he had never shown very much interest in either Tom or Temple Camp, though he appeared to entertain a lively interest in Miss Ellison, and Tom envied him his easy manner and his faculty for entertaining her and making her laugh.  On the morning of this day, however, when he had come up for his clandestine smoke, he had manifested much curiosity about the camp, looking over the maps and pictures and asking many questions.  Tom had felt highly flattered.     CHAPTER III  ROSCOE BENT   Indeed, Tom had felt so highly flattered that the memory of young Mr. Roscoe Bent's condescension had lingered with him all day, and now he was going to give himself the pleasure of walking through Rockwood Place for a passing glimpse of the beautiful house wherein young Roscoe resided.  Tom knew well enough that Roscoe had to thank the friendship between his father and Mr. Temple for his position in the bank. In his heart he knew that there was not much to be said for Roscoe; that _he_ could do many things which Roscoe couldn't begin to do; but Roscoe on the other hand could do all those little things which poor Tom never could master; he could joke and make people laugh, and he always knew what to say and how to say it--especially to girls.  Tom's long trousers had not brought him this accomplishment, and in his clumsiness of speech and manner he envied this sprightly youth who had become so much of a celebrity in his thoughts that he actually took a certain pleasure in walking past the Bent residence just because it was where Roscoe and his well-to-do parents lived.  He was a little ashamed of doing this, just as he was ashamed of his admiration for Roscoe, and he knew that neither Roscoe, with his fine airs, nor Roscoe's home would have had any attractions for Roy at all. But then Roy's father was rich, whereas Tom's father had been poor, and he had come out of the slums and in some ways he would never change.  \"He isn't so bad, anyway,\" Tom muttered to himself, as he kicked another stone along. \"I knew he'd be really interested some day. Any feller's _got_ to be interested in a camp like that. If he only _went_ there once, he'd see what it was like and he'd fall for it, all right. I bet in the summer he goes to places where they dance and bow, and all that, but he'd fall for Temple Camp if he ever went there--he would.\"  Tom was greatly elated at Roscoe's sudden interest, and he believed that great things would come of it.  \"If he could only once see that shack up on the mountain,\" he said to himself, \"and make that climb, I bet he'd knock off his cigarettes. If he thought those pictures were good--gee, what would he think of the shack itself!\"  When he reached the Bent house he was surprised to see an automobile standing directly in front of it which he had not noticed as he approached because its lights were out. Not even the little red light which should have illuminated the car's number was visible, nor was there a single light either in the entrance hall or in any of the windows of the big house.  In the car sat a dark figure in the chauffeur's place, and Tom, as he passed, fancied that this person turned away from him. He was rather surprised, and perhaps a little curious, for he knew that the Bents did not keep a car, and he thought that if the presence of the machine meant visitors, or a doctor, there would be some light in the house.  Reaching the corner, he looked back just in time to see another figure, carrying luggage, descend the steps and enter the car. He was still close enough to know that not a word was spoken nor a sound made; there was not even the familiar and usual bang of the automobile door. But a certain characteristic swing of the person with the luggage, as he passed one bag and then the other into the car, showed Tom that the figure was that of young Roscoe Bent. Then the car rolled away, leaving him gaping and speculating in the concealment of a doorway near the corner.  \"I wonder where he can be going this time of night,\" Tom mused. \"Gee, that was funny! If he was going on a vacation or anything like that, he'd have said so this morning--and he'd have said good-bye to me. Anyway, he'd have said good-bye to Miss Ellison....\"  Tom boarded with a private family in Culver Street, and after he reached home he sat up in his room for a while working with a kind of sullen resignation on the few registration badges which had still to have pins attached to them.  It was while he was engaged in this heroic labor that a thought entered his mind which he put away from him, but which kept recurring again and again, and which ended by cheating him out of his night's sleep. Why should Roscoe Bent be leaving home with two suitcases at twelve o'clock at night when he would have to register for the selective draft the next day?  After this rather puzzling question had entered his mind and refused to be ousted or explained away, other puzzling questions began to follow it. Why had the lights of the automobile been out? Why had there been no lights in the house? Why had no one come out on the porch to bid Roscoe good-bye? Why had not Roscoe slammed the auto door shut, as one naturally did, that being the easiest way to shut it?  Well, all that was Roscoe's business, not his, thought Tom, as he settled down to go to sleep, and perhaps he had closed the door quietly because he wished not to disturb any one so late at night. That was very thoughtful of Roscoe....  But just the same Tom could not go to sleep, and he lay in bed thinking uneasily.  He had just about conquered his misgivings and had begun to think how suspicious and ungenerous he was, when another question occurred to him which had the effect of a knockout blow to his peace of mind.  Why had Roscoe Bent told Miss Ellison that it was better to be a live coward than a dead hero?  --Why, he had only been joking, of course, when he said that! It was one of those silly, careless things that he was always saying. Miss Ellison had not seemed to think it was very funny, but that had only made Roscoe laugh the more. \"I'd rather kill time than kill Germans,\" he had said lightly. And Miss Ellison had said, \"You're quite brave at killing time, aren't you?\"  It was just joking and jollying, thought Tom, as he turned over for the fourth or fifth time, and he wished that _he_ could joke and jolly like that. He made up his mind that when Roscoe came upstairs in the morning he would ask him whether the Germans weren't cowards to murder innocent women and children, and whether he would really want to be like them. He believed he could say that much without a tremor, even in front of Miss Ellison.  He wished morning would come so that he could be sure that Roscoe ... so that he could say that when Roscoe came upstairs.  \"I'll bet he'll be sleepy after being out so late,\" thought Tom.     CHAPTER IV  THE CUP OF JOY   Tom was to have the next day off for his patriotic activities, but he went to the Temple Camp office early in the morning to get the mail opened and attend to one or two routine duties.  He found Miss Ellison already at her desk, and she greeted him with a mysterious smile.  \"I hear you're going to be one of the celebrities,\" she said, busying herself with her typewriter machine.  \"One of the what?\" said Tom.  \"One of the leading"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20986"],["title","Tom Slade with the Colors (#3)"],["body","of the day. I don't suppose you'll even _look_ at poor me to-morrow.--I was down in the bank and Mr. Temple said to send you down as soon as you came in.\"  \"Me?\" stammered Tom.  \"Yes, you.\"  For a few seconds Tom waited, not knowing what to say or do--especially with his feet.  \"You didn't notice if Roscoe was down there, did you?\" he finally ventured.  \"I most certainly did not,\" answered Miss Ellison, smiling with that same mysterious smile, as she tidied up her desk. \"I have something else to think of besides Mr. Roscoe Bent.\"  Tom shifted from one foot to the other. \"I thought you--maybe--kind of--I thought you liked him,\" said he.  \"Oh, did you?\"  He had never been quite so close to Miss Ellison before, nor engaged in such familiar discourse with her. He hesitated, moving uneasily, then made a bold plunge.  \"I think you can--I think a person--I think a feller can tell if a girl kind of likes a certain feller--sort of----\"  \"Indeed!\" she laughed. \"Well, then, perhaps you can tell if I like _you_--sort of.\"  This was too much for Tom. He wrestled for a moment with his embarrassment, but he was in for it now, and he was not going to back out.  \"I'm too clumsy for girls,\" said he; \"they always notice that.\"  \"You seem to know all about them,\" said the girl; \"suppose I should tell you that _I_ never noticed any such thing.--A girl usually notices if a fellow is strong, though,\" she added.  \"It was being a scout that made me strong.\"  \"There are different ways of being strong,\" observed Miss Ellison, busying herself the while.  \"I know what you mean,\" said Tom. \"I got a good muscle.\"  She leaned back in her chair and looked at him frankly. \"I didn't mean exactly that,\" she said. \"I meant if you make up your mind to do a thing, you'll do it.\"  Again Tom waited, not knowing what to say. He felt strangely happy, yet very uncomfortable. At length, for lack of anything better to say, he observed:  \"I guess you kinder like Roscoe, all right.\"  For answer she bent over her typewriter and began to make an erasure.  \"Don't you?\" he persisted, gaining courage.  \"Do I have to tell _you_?\" she asked, laughing merrily.  Tom lingered for a few moments. He wanted to stay longer. This little familiar chat was a bigger innovation in his life than the long trousers had been. His heart was pounding just as it had pounded when he first took the scout oath. Evidently the girl meant to leave early herself, and see something of the day's festivities, for she was very prettily attired. Perhaps this, perhaps the balmy fragrance of that wonderful spring day which Providence had ordered for the registration of Uncle Sam's young manhood, perhaps the feeling that some good news awaited him down in Mr. Temple's office, or perhaps all three things contributed to give Tom a feeling of buoyancy.  \"Are you going to see the parade?\" he asked. \"I got a badge here maybe you'd like to wear. I can get another for myself.\"  \"I would like very much to wear it,\" she said, taking the little patriotic emblem which he removed from his khaki coat. \"Thank you.\"  Tom almost hoped she would suggest that he pin it on for her. He stood for a few moments longer and then, as he could think of nothing more to say, moved rather awkwardly toward the door.  \"You look splendid to-day, Tom,\" Miss Ellison said. \"You look like a real soldier in your khaki.\"  \"The woman where I board pressed it for me yesterday,\" he said, blushing.  \"It looks very nice.\"  Tom went down in the elevator, and when it stopped rather suddenly at the ground floor it gave him exactly the same feeling that he had experienced while he talked to Miss Ellison....  Roscoe Bent was not at his desk as he passed the teller's window and glanced through it, but he did not think much of that, for it was early in the day and the sprightly Roscoe might be in any one of a dozen places thereabout. He might be up in the Temple Camp office, even.  John Temple, founder of Temple Camp and president of the bank, sat at his sumptuous desk in his sumptuous office and motioned Tom to one of the big leather chairs, the luxuriousness of which disconcerted him almost as much as had Miss Ellison's friendliness.  \"I told Margaret to send you down as soon as you came in, Tom,\" said Mr. Temple, as he opened his mail. \"I want to get this matter off my mind before I forget it. You know that General Merrill is going to be here to-night, I suppose?\"  \"I heard the committee was trying to get him.\"  \"Well, they've got him, and the governor's going to be here, too; did you hear that?\"  \"No, sir, I didn't,\" said Tom, surprised.  \"I've just got word from his secretary that he can spend an hour in our little berg and say a few words at the meeting to-night. Now listen carefully, my boy, for I've only a few minutes to talk to you. This thing necessitates some eleventh-hour preparation. The plan is to have a member from every local organization in town to form a committee to receive the governor and the general. That's about all there is to it.  \"There's the Board of Trade, and the Community Council, and--let's see--the churches and the Home Defense and the Red Cross and the Daughters of Liberty and the Citizens' Club, and the Boy Scouts.\"  Already Tom felt flattered.  \"Each of these organizations has designated one of its members to act on the committee. I had Mr. Ellsworth on the phone this morning and told him he'd have to represent the scouts. He said he'd do no such thing--that he wasn't a boy scout.\"  \"He's the best scout of all of us,\" said Tom.  \"_He_ says you're the best,\" retorted Mr. Temple; \"so there you are.\"  \"Roy's got twice as many merit badges as I have,\" said Tom.  \"Well, you've got long trousers, anyway,\" said Mr. Temple, \"and Mr. Ellsworth says you're the representative scout, so I guess you're in for it.\"  \"_M-me?_\"  \"Now, pay attention. You're to knock off work at the registration places at five o'clock and go up to the Community Council rooms, where you'll meet these ladies and gentlemen who are to form the reception committee. Reverend Doctor Wade will be looking for you, and he'll take you in hand and tell you just what to do. There won't be much. I think the idea is to meet the governor and the general with automobiles and escort them up to the Lyceum. The committee'll sit on the platform, I suppose. Doctor Wade will probably do all the talking.... You're not timid about it, are you?\" he added, looking up and smiling.  \"Kind of, but----\"  \"Oh, nonsense; you just do what the others do. Here--here's a reception committee badge for you to wear. This is one of the burdens of being a public character, Tom,\" he added slyly. \"Mr. Ellsworth's right, no doubt; if the scouts are to be represented at all they should be represented by a scout. Don't be nervous; just do as the others do, and you'll get away with it all right. Now run along. I suppose I'll be on the platform too, so I'll see you there.... You look pretty nifty,\" he added pleasantly, as Tom took the ribbon badge.  \"Mrs. Culver pressed it for me,\" said Tom. \"It had a stain, but she got it off with gasoline.\"  \"Good for her.\"  \"Would--do you think it would be all right to wear my Gold Cross?\"  \"You bet!\" said Mr. Temple, busy with his mail. \"If I had the scouts' Gold Cross for life-saving, I'd wear it, and I'd have an electric light next to it, like the tail light on an automobile to show the license number.\"  Tom laughed. He found it easy to laugh. He was nervous, almost to the point of panic, but his heart was dancing with joy.  \"All right, my boy,\" laughed Mr. Temple. \"Go along now, and good luck to you.\"  As Tom went out of Mr. Temple's office he seemed to move on wings. He was half frightened, but happy as he had never been in all his life. His cup of joy was overflowing. He had been through the ordeal of more than one generous ovation from his comrades in the troop; he had stood awkward and stolid with that characteristic frown of his while receiving the precious Gold Cross which this night he would wear.  But this was different--oh, so different! He, Tom Slade, was to help receive the governor of the state and one of Uncle Sam's famous generals. The Boy Scouts were to be represented because the Boy Scouts had to be reckoned with on these occasions, and he, Tom Slade, organizer of the Elk Patrol and now assistant to the scoutmaster, was chosen for this honor.  \"I'm glad I had my suit pressed,\" he thought.  What a day it had been for him so far! He had had a little chat with Margaret Ellison, she had said she liked him--anyway, she had almost said it, and she had taken the little emblem from him and had said that _if he made up his mind to do a thing he would do it_. He remembered the very words. Then he had gone downstairs and received this overwhelming news from Mr. Temple. What if he _had_ planted his seeds wrong and bored holes slantingways instead of straight? He was so proud and happy now that he added the official, patented scout smile to his sumptuous regalia and smiled all over his face.  He was usually rather timid about speaking to the men in the bank unless they spoke to him first, for the bank was an awesome place to him; but to-day he was not afraid, and his recollection of the pleasant little chat upstairs reminded him of a fine thing to do.  \"Is Rossie Bent here?\" he asked, stopping at the teller's cage.  \"Bent!\" called the teller.  Tom waited in suspense.  \"Not here,\" called a voice from somewhere beyond.  \"Not here,\" repeated the teller, and added: \"Asleep at the switch, I dare say.\"  Evidently the people of the bank had Roscoe's number. A strange feeling came over Tom which chilled his elation and troubled him. Irresistibly there rose in his mind a picture of a waiting automobile, of a dark figure, and a silent departure late at night.  \"I guess maybe he's just stopped to register, hey?\" said Tom.  \"Stopped for something or other, evidently,\" said the teller.  \"Could I speak to Mr. Temple's secretary?\" Tom asked.  Mr. Temple's"]]]
