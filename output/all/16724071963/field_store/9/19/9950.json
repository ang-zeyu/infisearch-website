Occasionally we had to fight to punish our neighbours, who came upon our land and tried to carry off our cattle; and as I grew up and increased in strength I became a warrior, but I only wished to fight to protect my home and my fields from our enemies.  When old enough I married a wife, who was as fond of me as woman could be.  When kindly treated black women love their husbands, as do their white sisters.  We had a little child, I was fond of him, oh! so fond.  My delight when I came in from the fields was to carry him about in my arms, or to roll with him on the grass, letting him tumble over me and pull my hair and ears, and then he would smile down into my face and laugh merrily.  I was a hunter also, and used fearlessly to attack huge elephants for the sake of their tusks, as well as for their flesh, especially for their big feet, which afford a dainty meal.  Even one would be sufficient for the whole of our party.  I had crossed the river, with several companions, armed with bows, arrows, and spears, intending to go some distance south, where many elephants, it was said, had been seen.  A stranger brought the account.  We had gone a day's journey, and were encamped at night, hoping to fall in with a herd of elephants the next day.  We had eaten our evening meal, and were about to lie down to sleep, when we were startled by hearing a shower of bullets come whistling above our heads.  We rose to fly, but knew not which way to go, for from either side strange cries assailed our ears, and before we could recover from our surprise a large party of men, with gleaming swords in their hands, rushed in upon us.  Snatching up our spears we attempted to defend ourselves, but were quickly overpowered, two of my friends being killed and others badly wounded.  We were at once bound with cords and thrown on the ground, while our captors were employed in preparing another way to secure us.  They were fierce men in dark dresses, some wearing turbans on their heads, others red caps.  I watched their proceedings, thinking that, perhaps, they were going to kill and eat us.  They cut down some young trees, leaving a fork at one end, and fixing a thick branch at the other, so as to form another fork. When several logs had thus been prepared, they made us with kicks get up, and picking out the strongest men among us, placed one at one end of a leg, and one at the other, securing them by the forks round our necks. As our arms were lashed behind our backs we could offer no resistance, but, pricked by the spears or sword points of our captors, were compelled to march forward in the direction they ordered us.  Twenty or more of us were thus secured; the remainder were fastened together by a long rope, one behind the other at an interval of a few feet, with their arms lashed behind them, led by an Arab.  With the heavy log round our necks we had no chance of escaping, nor indeed had the others, who would have been shot had they made the attempt.  Two or three of the worst wounded sank down from loss of blood.  The Arabs made them get up and proceed, but finding at last that the poor wretches could not keep up with the rest, took them out of the line, and putting pistols to their heads, shot them dead.  We were joined as we proceeded towards the coast by other captives, taken much as we had been, and treated in the same cruel manner.  Some, who had come from still further up the country than we had, and who had thus a longer march, told us that one-third of their number had died or been killed on the way, so that even those who were suffering severely from sickness endeavoured to struggle on as long as they had strength to move for fear of being murdered.'  \"`At night we were ordered to lie down before the fire, with a strong guard placed over us.  We were generally amply fed, in order that our strength might be kept up.  Although we passed through several thickly-populated districts, no one dared to help us for fear of the Arabs.  At length we reached the bank of a river, near the sea-coast, where we found a large vessel ready to receive us.  We were at once ordered to go on board, when we were placed on a bamboo deck, packed close to each other, with our chins resting on our knees.  As soon as some fifty or more of us were stowed on the lower deck, another deck was placed over our heads, preventing us even from sitting upright.  On this another layer of slaves was stowed in the same way that we were.  A third deck was placed above them, which was also crowded with unfortunate captives.  We could hear the voices of those above us, and frequently their cries, as the Arabs beat them in order to make them sit closer.  A narrow passage was left down the centre of the deck, along which the Arabs could pass to bring us our food.  We were thus kept a couple of days in the river, either waiting for a fair wind, or because our masters were afraid of being caught by some of the ships of the white men.  Our condition was bad enough in smooth water, but we were to find it considerably worse when we got into the open sea.  My only consolation was that my wife and little boy had escaped.  I knew that they would be mourning for me, whom they were never to see again.  I then wished that they were dead, that their grief might come to an end; and sometimes a terrible thought came to me that they too might some day be captured and carried off to the same horrible slavery which I was doomed, as I thought, to bear.  There were not only men on board, but women and children, to be taken to a far distant country, of which we had never before heard.  Where it was we could not tell, but we knew, by one telling the other, that it was inhabited by the same sort of people as the Arabs, and we supposed that they would beat and otherwise cruelly treat us if we did not obey them.  The younger women and children were better cared for than we men were, and wore well fed, to make them look plump and healthy.  The vessel had one great nearly triangular sail, and the after part rose high out of the water, while the bows seemed as if they would dip under it.  At last, the wind being fair, we sailed.  For some time we glided on.  A few of us were sent on deck at a time to breath the fresh air.  I felt my heart sink within me, when, on looking round, I could nowhere see the land, nothing but the smooth, shining ocean on every side.  It was terrible; I thought we should never again set foot on shore.  I had often paddled my canoe on the river, and had even made trading voyages down to the great lake, where I had seen huge waves covered with foam rolling across it; but on such occasions we had quickly made for the shore.  Twice my canoe had been upset, but I had easily gained it by swimming.  Suddenly the wind began to roar, the thunder rolled above our heads, and the dhow was tossed about by the sea in a way which made me expect that she would speedily be thrown over, and that all on board would be sent into the raging waves.  Pitiful were the shrieks and cries of my companions.  In vain the Arabs ordered them to keep quiet; they believed that their last hour was come, and cared not what was said to them.  I determined, whatever happened, to struggle for my life.  I was young and strong; and the thought entered my mind that I might swim to the shore, and get back some day to my wife and children, though I knew that my home must be a long way off.  I felt quite disappointed when the storm ceased, and the dhow glided on her course as before.  When I next went on deck, I saw that she was in company with other vessels, rigged as she was, and sailing in the same direction.  Each of them had prisoners on board.  The decks of two or three of the larger ones were crowded with black forms, and I guessed that there were as many more below.  Our dhow sailed very fast, and was passing most of them, when a calm came on, and we lay all huddled together, near enough for the people in one vessel to speak to those on board another.  Presently I heard the Arabs shouting to each other that there was a large sail in sight.  The news seemed to alarm them.  She was coming towards the fleet of dhows, bringing up a breeze.  At last the wind filled our sails, and the dhows began to separate.  We fancied that if we could keep ahead of the stranger that she could not harm us; but we saw flashes of flame proceeding from her side, and round shot came bounding over the water towards us; first one dhow was hit, now another.  At last one shot struck our vessel, going through the side, and fearful were the cries which arose from the people below, who were wounded, or expected to be killed by other shots.  I had been allowed to remain on deck, for the Arabs in their flight did not think about the slaves.  I saw some of the dhows lower their sails, when boats from the big ship took possession of them.  Our dhow sailing faster than the others soon got ahead, and I saw our Arab masters rejoicing that they should escape; but the wind was increasing; every instant it grew stronger and stronger.  The large sail was lowered, and a small one hoisted, but we dashed over the fast rising sea at greater speed than ever, soon losing sight of the big ship, which, after securing the prizes she had taken, pursued some other dhows, who were endeavouring to make their escape in different directions to that we were steering.  The storm, however, increased.  The Arabs now began to look alarmed.  In vain they tried to stop the hole which the shot had made in the vessel's side; finding this difficult, owing to the crowd of slaves below, they began to throw those in their way overboard.  Some were dead, others wounded, but many were uninjured.  They shrieked out for mercy, but the Arabs heeded them not.'  \"`I had kept in the fore part of the vessel, hidden behind a coil of rope, fully expecting that they would soon seize me.  After labouring away for some time and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21472"],["title","Ned Garth; Or, Made Prisoner in Africa: A Tale of the Slave Trade (#4)"],["body","the water come in as fast as ever, they began to lower a boat and canoe, for the purpose of getting into them, and trying to save their lives, intending to leave me and my companions to our fate.  The sea was foaming and roaring around us.  It seemed that at any moment the dhow would sink.  The sail was now lowered, and the boat and canoe were got into the water.  The cry arose that the dhow was sinking, and the Arabs leapt into them in such haste that the boat was upset, and all in her were speedily overwhelmed.  The canoe, after being tossed about on the tops of the waves for a few minutes, was also turned over, and all in her shared the fate of their companions.  She was not far off at the time.  I thought that I might reach her, but I remembered my fellow-slaves.  I found a knife which one of the Arabs had left on the deck, and was endeavouring to release some of the men, who might be able to swim with me to the canoe, when I felt that the dhow was going down.  I sprang overboard, and with a few strokes gained the canoe, being almost thrown on to her by the seas, when I felt that she was being drawn under the surface; but I clutched tight hold of her, and she quickly came up again.  For a few moments the shrieks and cries of my drowning countrymen rose high above the loud dashing of the waves and the howling of the storm, but they were speedily silenced, and I found myself floating alone on the tossing waters.  I wished to live for the sake of my wife and child.  In my ignorance I knew not how far I was away from the land, still I struggled for life.  All night long I clung to the canoe, and before morning the wind had fallen and the sea had become smooth.  I was able to right the canoe, when I saw close to me a gourd and a paddle.  I reached them by working the canoe on with my hands, and contrived to bale her out.  I saw the sun rise, and knew that the land lay on the opposite side.  I tried to paddle towards it; but I had had no food and no water, and the sun came down with a heat I had never felt on shore.  Still, for hours I paddled on, when I saw the sails of a big ship rising above the horizon.  She must be, I thought, the one which had captured the dhows.  Fear filled my heart, for the Arabs had told us that the white men would kill and eat us.  Terror and the suffering I had undergone overcame me; I sank down at the bottom of the canoe, and knew no more until I found myself on board a ship, with white people standing round me.  I could not understand a word they said, nor tell them how I came to be in the canoe, but they looked kind, and my fears left me.  I was well fed and cared for, and soon recovered my strength.  There were several persons whom I now know to have been passengers.  One lady, very fair and beautiful, who spoke in a gentle, sweet voice to me, trying to make me comprehend what she meant.  She had a little girl with her.  I loved that child from the first, for she made me think of my own boy by her playful ways and happy laugh, though she was fair as a lily, and my boy was as black as I am, but I thought not of the difference of colour.  I felt that I should never wish to leave that kind lady and her child.  In a few days the weather again became bad, a fearful gale began to blow.  The ship was tossed about far more violently than the dhow had been.  Presently, during the night, I heard a loud crash, followed by the shouts and shrieks of the crew and passengers.  My first thought was of the little girl.  On reaching the deck a flash of lightning showed her to me, clinging to her mother's arms.  I made signs that I would try and save her, and I wrapped her up in some shawls which had been brought from below.  The officers and crew were, I saw, trying to lower the boats.  Whether they succeeded or not I could not tell, for the seas were sweeping over the ship, and I knew too that she was sinking, as the dhow had done.  While I was standing by the lady's side, looking for one of the boats into which to help her, a huge sea separated us, carrying me off my legs, and I found myself struggling amid the foaming waves.  I had caught sight of a dark object floating near, far larger than a boat.  By what means I know not I reached it. It was part of the wreck of a dhow or of some other vessel against which our ship had struck.  I climbed upon it with my little charge, whose head I had managed to keep above water.  She was crying out for her mamma.  I knew that name.  I tried to console her.  For some time voices reached my ear, but whether they came from the boats or the deck of the ship I could not tell; I guessed, too truly, that she had gone down, for when morning at last dawned neither she nor the boats were to be seen. I feared that the little girl would sink from hunger and thirst, for I remembered what I had endured in the canoe; but scarcely had the sun risen than I saw a ship approaching, and you, Massa Pack, know the rest.'  \"It was my ship which Tom saw coming.  Of course we soon had him and his little charge on board.  You will understand that I have given what I may call a translation of his yarn.  It was spun, as it were, in a number of shreds, and I have put them together; still I have expressed his sentiments, and have not adorned his tale by adding to it anything he did not say.  Many a time did he melt into tears as he spoke of his own child and the love he bore him, and it would be difficult to picture fully all the horrors he endured during his journey overland and his voyage in the slave dhow.  To send him back to his home I knew was impossible, he would have been retaken by the first Arab party he fell in with, or been murdered as he was trying to pass through the territory of any hostile tribe.  He therefore cheerfully remained on board my ship, and has stayed with me ever since, pretty well reconciled to his lot, his whole soul wrapped up in Mary, who has taken the place in his affections of the son from whom he has, he believes, for ever been separated, though he is devoted also to my sister, and to Ned and me. That black fellow has as big a heart as any white man.  He does not, however, forget his wife and child, for since he became a Christian, his great desire is that they should be brought to a knowledge of the truth. If it were possible, I would help him to get back to his native village, but to do so is beyond my means.  Indeed, from what I hear I fear that the Arabs have long ere this carried them off into captivity, or that, deprived of their protector, they have died of hunger or been killed by their cruel persecutors.  Those Arabs have long been the curse of that part of Africa--indeed, for the purpose of obtaining slaves, they have devastated many of its most fertile districts.\"  His guest listened with evident interest to the account given by the lieutenant.  \"I have not hitherto turned my attention in that direction,\" observed the former.  \"Of course I have heard much of the slave trade on the western coast and of the horrors of the middle passage, but I believed that it is now carried on only in a very limited degree, and that the inhabitants of the east coast are well able to take care of themselves.\"  \"I have cruised on both coasts, and am convinced that the people on the east part of Africa are subjected to cruelties fully equal to those which the western tribes have for so many ages endured,\" answered the lieutenant.  \"Tom's experience is that of thousands; but he did not describe the miseries suffered by those left behind, the despair of the women and children, and of the men who may have escaped from the sudden attack made on their village, to find it when they have returned burned to the ground, their fields laid waste, and their cattle carried off. No one can calculate the numbers who have died from hunger in a land teeming with abundance.\"  Ned and Mary came in during the latter part of the conversation, to which they paid the greatest attention.  \"I wish I could help to put a stop to such horrible doings,\" exclaimed Ned.  \"I should like to see an English fleet employed in catching all the dhows, and an army sent to march through the country to turn all the Arabs out of it.  It would be an honour to serve even as a drummer-boy on shore, or as a powder-monkey on board one of the ships.\"  Their guest smiled at Ned's enthusiasm.  \"A more certain way may be found for benefiting the Africans than by armies or fleets,\" observed Miss Sarah; \"if a band of faithful missionaries of the Gospel were scattered through the country, they would, with God's blessing, carry Christianity and civilisation to the long benighted and cruelly treated people.\"  \"You speak the truth, madam, the matter is worthy of consideration,\" observed the guest, turning to Miss Sarah.  \"I have learned several things since I came into your house.  I wish that I could remain longer to learn more, but I am compelled to go up to London; and as I feel myself sufficiently strong to travel, I must, early to-morrow morning, wish you farewell.\"    CHAPTER THREE.  The shipwrecked stranger had taken his departure; he had paid the doctor, and sent a present to the coast-guard men who had assisted to carry him to the house; but he had not offered to remunerate the lieutenant or Tom for the service they had rendered him, though he feelingly expressed his gratitude to them.  Perhaps he considered, and he was not wrong in so doing, that they not only did not require a reward for performing an act of humanity, but would have felt hurt had it been offered them.  The next morning the lieutenant and Ned started on a walk along the cliffs to inquire at Longview station about the coast-guard man who had nearly been killed on the night of the wreck.  The sky was clear, the blue ocean slumbered below their feet, the gentle ripples which played over it sparkling in the bright rays of the sun.  A large vessel, with a wide spread of canvas, was gliding majestically by on her way down channel.  Ned"]]]
