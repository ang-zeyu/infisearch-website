Now, then, what is it?\"  \"Well, sir, you boast of knowing me thoroughly.  Let me tell you that I know you, and your position here.\"  \"And find it is in every respect a strong one, sir.  Well?\"  \"You live here, close at hand to an enemy who covets your lands, and with whom you have fought again and again.  You and your ancestors were always enemies with the Edens.\"  \"Quite right, sir.  Well, what is that to you?\"  \"This, Sir Morton Darley.  The war is over.  I and my brave fellows are idle, our swords rusting in their sheaths.\"  \"More shame to the brave fellows who do not keep their weapons bright. Well, this is a long preamble to tell me that you have all been dismissed from the king's service.  Go on.\"  The captain stared and scowled, but he could not fully meet the searching eyes which looked him down.  \"Well,\" he said, rather blunderingly now, \"knowing what I did of my old officer's state--\"  \"`Old officer' is better, Captain Purlrose.  Go on, sir.\"  \"I said, here am I, a brave soldier, with a handful of stout followers, eager to do good, honest work; why should I not go and offer my sword to Sir Morton Darley?  He is sorely pressed.\"  \"Wrong,\" said Sir Morton.  \"He would be glad of our help,\" continued the man, without heeding the interruption; \"we could garrison his castle and help him to drive his enemy from the field.  Twelve of them, all well-tried soldiers, who can make him king of the country round.  That, sir, is why I have come, to confer a favour more than ask one.  Now, sir, what do you say?  Such a chance for you may never occur again.\"  \"Hah!\" ejaculated Sir Morton; \"and all this out of pure good fellowship!\"  \"Of course; save that a retainer who risks his life in his chief's service is worthy of his hire.\"  \"Naturally, sir.  So that is your meaning--your object in coming?\"  \"That is it, Sir Morton.  We can put your castle in a state of defence, make raids, and harass the enemy, fetch in stores from the surrounding country, and make you a great man.  Think of how you can humble the Edens.\"  Sir Morton frowned as he looked back at the past, and then from thence up to his present position, one in which he felt that he played a humble part in presence of his stronger enemy; and Ralph watched him, read in his face that he was about to accept his visitor's proposal, and with a feeling of horror at the thought of such a gang being hired to occupy a part of the castle, and brought, as it were, into a kind of intimacy, he turned quickly to his father, laid his hand upon his arm, and whispered eagerly:  \"Father, pray, pray don't do this.  They are a terribly villainous set of ruffians.\"  The captain twitched his big ears in his efforts to catch what was said; but he could only hear enough to make out that the son was opposing the plans, and he scowled fiercely at the lad.  \"Wait, wait,\" said Sir Morton.  \"But do go out and look at the rest of the men, father,\" whispered Ralph.  \"There is no need.\"  \"Then you will not agree, father?\"  \"Most certainly not, my boy.\"  Purlrose could not catch all this, but he scowled again.  \"Look here, young cockerel,\" he cried, \"don't you try and set my old officer against me.\"  \"No need,\" said Sir Morton hotly.  \"Ah, that's because hard times have made me and my poor gallant fellows look a little shabby.\"  \"Not that, sir.  Your old character stands in your way.\"  \"Oh, this is hard--this is hard.  You rich, and with everything comfortable, while I am poor, and unrewarded for all my labour and risk by an ungrateful Scot.\"  \"Don't insult your sovereign, sir!\" cried Sir Morton.  \"Oh, this is hard--this is hard.\"  \"Look here, Michael Purlrose, if you had been an officer and a gentleman in distress, I would have helped you.\"  \"Do you mean to say that I am not an officer, and a gentleman in distress, sir?\" cried the captain, clapping his hand to the hilt of his sword, a movement imitated by Ralph, angrily.  But Sir Morton stood back, unmoved.  \"Let your sword alone, boy,\" he said sternly.  \"You, Michael Purlrose, knowing you as I do of old, for a mouthing, cowardly bully, do you think that I am going to be frightened by your swagger?  Yes, I tell you that you are no gentleman.\"  \"Oh, this is too much,\" cried the visitor.  \"It is enough to make me call in my men.\"  \"Indeed!\" said Sir Morton coolly.  \"Why call them in to hear me recapitulate your disgrace?  As to your appeals to me for help, and your claim, which you profess to have upon me, let me remind you that you were engaged as a soldier of fortune, and well paid for your services, though you and yours disgraced the royal army by your robberies and outrages.  All you gained you wasted in riot and drunkenness, and now that you are suffering for your follies, you come and make claims upon me.\"  \"Oh, this is too hard upon a poor soldier who has bled in his country's service.  Did I not once save your life, when you were at your last gasp?\"  \"No, sir; it was the other way on.  I saved yours, and when I was surrounded, and would have been glad of your help, you ran away.\"  \"Ha-ha-ha!\" cried Ralph, bursting into a roar of laughter.  \"Ah-h-ah!\" cried the captain fiercely, as he half drew his sword; but he drove it back with a loud clang into its sheath directly.  \"Stay there, brave blade, my only true and trusted friend.  He is the son of my old companion-in-arms, and I cannot draw upon a boy.\"  Ralph laughed aloud again, and the captain scowled, and rolled his eyes fiercely; but he did not startle the lad in the least, and after a long, fierce stare, the man turned to Sir Morton.  \"Don't be hard upon an old brother-soldier, Morton Darley,\" he said.  \"No, I will not,\" said Sir Morton quietly.  \"You and your men can refresh yourselves in the hall, and when you start on your way, I will give you a pound or two to help you.\"  \"Oh, as if I were a common wayside beggar.  Comrade, this is too hard. Can you not see that my beard is getting grizzled and grey?\"  \"Yes; but I do not see what that has to do with it.\"  \"Think again, old comrade.  Twelve brave and true men have I with me. Take us as your gentlemen and men at arms to protect you and yours against those who are unfriendly.  You must have enemies.\"  Sir Morton started and glanced at his son, for these words touched a spring in his breast.  With thirteen fighting men to increase his little force, what might he not do?  The Edens' stronghold, with its regularly coming-in wealth, must fall before him; and, once in possession, Sir Edward Eden might petition and complain; but possession was nine points of the law, and the king had enough to do without sending a force into their wild out-of-the-way part of the world to interfere.  Once he had hold of the Black Tor, he could laugh at the law, and see the old enemy of his house completely humbled.  Sir Morton hesitated and turned his head, to find his son watching him keenly, while Captain Purlrose stood with his left hand resting on the hilt of his sword, making the scabbard cock out behind, and lift up the back of his ragged cloak, as with his right he twisted up and pointed one side of his rusty-grey fierce moustache.  The man was watching Sir Morton keenly, and his big ears twitched, as he tried to catch the whispered words which passed between father and son.  \"What do you say, Ralph, lad?  With the help of these men I could easily make Eden bite the dust.  Then the Black Tor would be mine, and afterwards yours; with all the rich revenue to be drawn from the lead-mine.  It is very tempting, boy.\"  \"Yes, father,\" said the boy hotly, and his face flushed as he spoke; \"but that's what it is--a miserable temptation.  We'll humble the Edens, and have the Black Tor and the lead-mine; but we'll win all with our swords like gentlemen, or fail.  We could not go and take the place with a set of ruffians like those outside, and helped by such a man as yonder bully.  You couldn't do it, father.  Say no.\"  \"Hah!  More insults,\" cried Purlrose, who had caught a word here and there.  \"But no; lie still, good sword: he is a beardless boy, and the son of the brave comrade I always honoured, whate'er my faults.\"  Ralph turned upon him angrily; but his father laid a hand upon the boy's shoulder, and pressed it hard.  \"Right, Ralph, lad,\" he said warmly, and he looked proudly in the boy's eyes.  \"I could not do it in that way.\"  \"Hah!\" ejaculated the lad, with a sigh of content.  \"No, Purlrose,\" continued Sir Morton.  \"I shall not avail myself of your services.  Go into the hall and refresh yourself and your men.  Come to me afterward, and I will help you as I said.\"  \"With a mouthful of bread, and a few pence, and after all this weary journey across these wild moors.  But I see: it is all through the words of this beardless boy.  Suppose I tell you that, now I have come, I mean to stay?\" he added threateningly.  \"Shall I get the men together, father?\" said Ralph quickly.  \"No, boy, there is no need,\" said Sir Morton firmly.  \"I am not afraid of Michael Purlrose's threats.\"  \"What!\" cried the man.  \"You do not know me yet.\"  \"Better than you know yourself, sir,\" said Sir Morton, rising.  \"That is the way to the hall.  Have the goodness to go first.\"  The captain threw his cloak back over his right shoulder, slapped his right hand heavily upon his rusty breast-plate, and then, with a flourish, caught at the hilt of his sword, and again half drew it from its sheath, to stand scowling at Ralph, the intentness of his gaze seeming to affect his eyes, so that they began to lean towards each other, as if for help, till his look"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21298"],["title","The Black Tor: A Tale of the Reign of James the First (#3)"],["body","a villainous squint.  Then, as neither father nor son quailed before him, he uttered a loud \"Hah!\" thrust back his sword, and strode with a series of stamps to the door, his high, buff-leather boots rustling and creaking the while.  There he faced round.  \"I give you one more chance, Morton Darley,\" he cried.  \"Yes or no?\"  \"No,\" said Sir Morton firmly.  \"One moment before it is too late.  Are we to be friends or foes?\"  \"Neither,\" shouted Ralph quickly.  \"Yes, boy, one or the other.  You, Morton Darley, will you take me into your service, or do you drive me into going straight to your rival and enemy, who will jump at my offer, and pay me better than I could expect of you?\"  \"Go where you please, sir,\" said Sir Morton.  \"Ah, you drive me to it, when I would have been your friend.  There, it must be so; but don't blame me when you are humbled in the dust.\"  \"Why, if you go there,\" cried Ralph, \"Sir Edward Eden will make his men disarm your crew of ragged Jacks, and set you all to work in his mine.\"  \"What!  Never.  Now, Darley, once more--friends or foes?\"  \"Neither, I tell you, man.  Now leave my place at once, you and yours. I will neither help you nor have any further dealings with you.  Go.\"  \"What!\" roared Purlrose; and this time he drew his sword fully, and Ralph's bright blade followed suit, glittering, while the captain's looked rusty and dull.  \"Pooh! put up your sword, Ralph,\" said Sir Morton, advancing toward their visitor, who began to shrink back.  \"Sheathe your blade, sir,\" he said sternly, and without paying the least attention to the man's bullying looks, he threw open the door, and pointed to the entrance.  He passed out, giving the door behind him a heavy slam, and marched out to the group standing about the broad steps and road, where father and son could hear him haranguing his men, who immediately burst into an angry yell, and for the most part turned menacingly toward the house.    CHAPTER THREE.  ABOUT THE ENEMY.  \"Shall I fasten the door, father?\" cried Ralph excitedly.  \"No,\" said Sir Morton firmly.  \"I know my man of old.\"  Ralph looked on and listened, as a low growl arose; but, bully and coward or no, it was evident that Captain Purlrose was master of his men, who stood listening and nodding their heads, one or two slapping the hilts of their swords menacingly, and at last the leader of the ragged crew turned and shook his fist threateningly at the house, and ended by striding jauntily away through the embattled gateway, followed by his gang.  \"Will they come back, father, at night?\" said Ralph, after uttering a sigh of relief.  \"No, my boy; I judge the men by their leader.  Michael Purlrose always had a wholesome love of keeping his skin sound; his men have, without doubt, the same.  He will execute his threat, though, of going to Eden's.\"  \"And if Sir Edward takes them into his service, it will be awkward for us, father.\"  \"Yes, _if_, my boy; but I do not think that Eden will.  We shall hear no more of the vagabonds, unless Purlrose comes back to beg.\"  \"I'll go and watch them, father,\" cried Ralph eagerly.  \"Yes; but you will not go near, so as to run any risk?  If they found you alone, they would attack and strip you of everything of value you have.\"  \"I'll take care,\" cried the lad.  \"I can get up to the side of the cliff, and watch them right away.  I can see the path to the Black Tor from there.\"  \"Yes; go,\" said Sir Morton, and the boy hurried out, crossed the little court, and passing through a small side-door, reached the slope of the cliff upon which the old castle was built, and then by a narrow pathway, clambered a couple of hundred feet higher, starting the jackdaws from their resting-places, making them fly off, uttering angry cries of _tah_! _tah_!  Then throwing himself down behind a great block of limestone, which had fallen from above, and which looked as if a thrust would send it hurtling down some hundred feet, into the river below, he waited till, as he fully expected, he saw the party of men appear down below in the track; and then he followed their course, seeing them disappear behind the trees, appear again, and after making divers short cuts, as if their leader were well acquainted with the place, make off for the ford.  Then he watched them as they straggled across the river, and struck into the narrow cliff path which led to the great dark-hued cliff known as the Black Tor, where the Edens' impregnable stronghold stood, perched upon a narrow ledge of rock which rose up like a monstrous tongue from the earth, connected on one side by a narrow natural bridge with the main cliff, the castellated building being protected on all sides by a huge rift fully a couple of hundred feet deep, the tongue being merely a portion of the cliff split away during some convulsion of nature; or perhaps gradually separated by subsidence, the top affording sufficient space for the building, and its courtyards.  Ralph watched the men until the last had disappeared; and then, knowing from the configuration of the place as he had seen it from another point of view, that he would probably not see them again for an hour or two, perhaps not again that day, if Sir Edward Eden received the proposals of Captain Purlrose favourably, he began slowly and thoughtfully to descend.  For he knew that it would be a serious matter for his father if Sir Edward Eden seized upon the opportunity for strengthening his retainers and attacking his rival.  The feud between the two families had lasted for generations, beginning so far back that the origin was lost in the mists of time.  All that Ralph Darley knew was, that in the days of Henry the Eighth, an Eden had done a Darley deadly injury that could never be forgiven, and ever since the wrong had been handed down from father to son as a kind of unpleasant faith by which it was the duty of all Darleys to be prepared to exterminate all Edens; and if they could not exterminate them and seize upon their possessions, to do them all the injury they could.  There was another version of the story, as Ralph well knew, and it was precisely the same, saving for the following exception: that in the beginning it was a Darley who did the deadly wrong to an Eden.  But one thing was certain--the two families had carried on their petty warfare in the most determined way.  Edens had fallen by the sword; so had Darleys.  There was a grim legend, too, of an Eden having been taken prisoner, and starved to death in one of the dungeons of Cliffe Castle, in Queen Mary's time; and Ralph had often gone down below to look at the place, and the staple ring and chain in the gloomy place, shuddering at the horror of the prisoner's fate.  For this the Edens had waited their time, and surprised the castle one night, driving the occupants from place to place, till they took refuge in the central tower, from which they could not be dislodged; so the Edens contented themselves by the following reprisal: they set fire to the castle in a dozen places before they retired, the flames raging till there was no more woodwork to destroy, and nothing was left but the strong central tower and the sturdy walls.  The place was restored, though, soon after, and the Sir Ralph Darley of Elizabeth's time made an expedition one night to give tit-for-tat, but only to find out that it was impossible to get across the stoutly-defended natural bridge at Black Tor, and that it was waste of time to keep on shooting arrows, bearing burning rags soaked in pitch, on to the roofs of the towers and in at the loopholes.  So he retreated, with a very sore head, caused by a stone thrown from above, dinting in his helmet, and with half his men carrying the other half, wounded or dead.  His successor had tried again and again to master the Edens and seize their possessions.  Amongst these was the Black Tor lead-mine, approached by steps in the side of the cliff; its galleries honeycombed the place, running right under the earth, and into natural caverns of the large opposite cliffs of limestone, where the jackdaws built their nests.  Ralph Darley, living as he did that day in the days of King James, pondered on all those old legends as he descended to give his father the information he had acquired; and as he stepped down, he knit his brows and began to think that it was quite time this feud had an end, and that it must be his duty to finish it all off, in spite of the addition to the strength at Black Tor, by waiting his opportunity, and meeting, and in fair fight slaying, young Mark Eden, who was about his own age, seventeen, and just back home from one of the great grammar-schools. This done, he would make a scheme for seizing the Black Tor, putting Sir Edward Eden and his mercenaries to the sword, but sparing the men who were miners, so that they might go on working for the Darleys.  By this means he would end the feud, secure peace, and make his father a rich and happy man, having proved himself a thoroughly good and chivalrous son.  Ralph felt very brave, and proud, and happy, when he had reached this point, which was just as he opened the door of his father's room, which contained a very small library--books being rare and precious in those days--plenty of handsome armour and war-like weapons of offence, and a corner set apart for alchemy and the study of minerals; for, in a desultory way, Sir Morton Darley, bitten by the desire to have a mine of his own to produce him as good an income as that of his enemy neighbour, had been given to searching without success for a good lode of lead.  Sir Morton was reading an old tome as his son entered the room, hot, eager, and excited.  \"Well, boy,\" he said, looking up dreamily; \"what is it?\"  \"They've gone straight to Black Tor, father.\"  \"The Edens?  Have they?  I did not know they had been away.\"  \"No, no, father; that captain fellow and his men.\"  \"Oh, of course.  I had almost forgotten them.  Tut, tut, tut!  It will be very awkward for us, Ralph, if Sir Edward "]]]
