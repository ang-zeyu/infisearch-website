All to me seemed hubbub and confusion.  The men flew here and there, some going aloft, while others came tramping along the deck with the ropes.  Even Captain Magor and the mates were pulling and hauling. Harry and I caught hold of the ropes they gave us, and ran along with them to gather in the fluttering canvas, which seemed as if it would be blown to shreds before it could be secured.  As it was, a fore-royal was carried away and a studding-sail boom was snapt off.  Before we had time to stow the lighter canvas the squall came down thick and strong on us. The order was given to clew up the courses and take a reef in the topsails.  The wind, though coming off the land, quickly beat the ocean into wild tossing waves, through which the brig dashed forward with lessened sail, yet still with increased speed.  A thick misty appearance, caused by a fine impalpable sand brought off the land by the squall, soon hid the stranger from sight.  \"It's an ill wind that blows nobody good,\" observed the mate; \"and I hope we shall be in luck, and get out of the way of that fellow; I don't like his looks, that I don't.\"  What Captain Magor thought about the matter he did not say.  He kept the brig away, running as before, which showed that he considered the stranger was still in pursuit of us.  Harry and I looked out for her, but she was nowhere to be seen.  \"Perhaps the squall took her unawares and carried away her masts; if so, and she is an enemy, we may thank the wind for the service it has rendered us,\" observed the first mate.  \"There's little chance of that, I fear,\" said Captain Magor.  \"When it clears up again we shall see her all ataunto, or I am much mistaken.\"  We all continued looking out anxiously over the taffrail, while the brig ploughed her way through the fast rising seas, which hissed and foamed around her.  The captain paced the deck, now looking aft, now aloft, waiting for the moment when he could venture to make sail again.  The men stood with their hands on the halyard, ready to hoist away at the expected order, for all on board knew the importance of keeping ahead of the stranger should she be what we suspected.  Still the atmosphere remained charged with dust off the coast, which, as the rays of the sun fell upon it, assumed a yellowish hue.  At any moment, however, it might dissolve, and already it had sunk lower than when it first came on.  Before long we had evidence that the captain's surmise was correct, for just over the thick bank astern we caught sight through our glasses of a fine perpendicular line against the sky, which he asserted were the royal masts of the stranger, with the royals still furled.  If he was right-- and of that there appeared little doubt--she must have gained rapidly on us.  The best we could hope for was that the mist would continue until nightfall and shroud us from her sight.  The setting sun, it should be understood, cast its light upon her masts, while ours were still in the shade.  We were doomed, however, to disappointment; suddenly the mist cleared off, and the bright rays of the sun exposed to view the topsails and courses of our pursuer.  \"We may still keep ahead of her, and when night comes on give her the slip,\" observed Captain Magor; \"if not, we will fight her.  The men, I hope, will stand to their guns, and show that they are British seamen. It will be a disgrace to knock under to piratical villains, such as I fear are the crew of yonder craft.\"  \"The men are staunch, I'll answer for that,\" observed Mr Serwin. \"Tubbs has had a talk with them to try their tempers, and he is as true a fellow as ever stepped.\"  \"That he is; and if you and I and the second mate should be killed, he will fight the ship as long as a stick is standing,\" answered the first mate, showing his appreciation of the boatswain's character.  Harry and I, as we walked the deck, agreed that we would fight to the last, though we heartily wished that we might escape the stern necessity.  Before long the captain shouted--  \"Shake out the reefs in the fore-topsail, my lads.\"  The topmen flew aloft and the sail was hoisted.  Soon afterwards the captain gave the order to set the fore-topgallantsail.  \"We must get preventer braces on it,\" he observed to the first mate; \"it won't do to run the risk of carrying away the spar.\"  The additional ropes were quickly secured by the active crew.  As they stood aft watching the sail, it seemed as if at any moment it would carry away the mast and spar, as, bulging out with the strong breeze, it strained and tugged in its efforts to free itself, but the sticks were tough and the ropes which held them sound, and with increased speed the brig flew before the gale.  Two of the best hands were at the wheel, for any carelessness in steering might in an instant have produced a serious disaster.  The effects of the additional sail were satisfactory, as the stranger was no longer gaining on us, as she had hitherto done.  Still, as I felt the violent blows given by the seas, now on one quarter, now on the other, the brig now pitching into a hollow ahead, now rising rapidly over another sea, then rolling from side to side, I feared that the masts must be jerked out of her.  Harry and I found it scarcely possible to walk the deck without being tossed about like shuttlecocks, so that our only resource was to hold fast to the stanchions, or, when we wanted to move, to catch hold of the bulwarks.  As night approached, however, the wind began to decrease, and the sea, having no great distance to run, went down.  Whether this was likely to be an advantage to us or not was now to be proved.  As the last rays of the sun ere he set glanced horizontally across the ocean, they fell on the stranger's canvas down to the foot of her courses.  Still our stout-hearted captain did not despair.  \"We will do what we can to give the fellow the go-by, and may outwit him, clever as he thinks himself,\" he said, laughing.  \"Aloft there, and set the fore-royal,\" he shouted; and this being done, the foretopmast studding-sails were again rigged out, thus exhibiting a broad sheet of canvas to the eyes of our pursuer, which would probably make him suppose that we intended to continue our course directly before the wind.  The sun had now sunk, but we could yet distinguish through the fast gathering gloom the sail astern.  Captain Magor now ordered the mainsail to be hauled out, and the main-topsail and maintop-gallant-sail to be set.  By the time this was done, not even the outlines of the stranger could be perceived astern.  \"Take in studdin'-sails,\" cried the captain.  These by the united efforts of the crew, wildly fluttering, were hauled down without a spar being lost.  The fore-royal was then furled. \"Starboard the helm,\" was the next order given.  \"Haul on the starboard fore and main braces,\" he then sang out, and the brig was brought to the wind on the larboard tack.  No sooner did she feel its power, as the yards were braced sharp up, the tacks hauled down, and the braces and bowlines sheeted home, than she heeled over to the force of the wind, which was still considerable, although it did not appear to when we were running before it.  \"If the stranger does not discover our change of course, she will be well away to leeward before morning, and we shall see no more of her,\" said Captain Magor, addressing Harry and me.  \"I don't want to expose the lives of you young gentlemen to danger, or to risk the loss of our cargo, I daresay you felt not a little anxious, but you may turn in and sleep soundly, with the prospect of making the coast of Africa in another day or two at furthest.  We will have some food first though, for you have been on deck ever since dinner; you'll be hungry.  Quambo!\" he shouted, \"let's have some supper on table as soon as possible.\"  \"Him dare 'ready, captain,\" answered the black steward, \"only wait de young gen'lemen to cut him.\"  The captain, leaving the deck in charge of the first mate, descended with us, and did ample justice to the plentiful meal Quambo had spread on the table.  The captain, before going on deck again, advised us to turn in.  We were, however, too anxious to do so, notwithstanding his assertions that all was likely to go well, and we therefore soon joined him on deck.  We found him looking out over the larboard quarter, the direction in which the stranger was most likely to be seen.  Although we swept the ocean with our glasses round two-thirds of the horizon, she was nowhere visible.  At length, trusting that the captain really was right, with our minds tolerably relieved, we went below and turned into our berths.  Still, though I slept, I could not get the thought of the pirate out of my mind.  I dreamed that I was again on deck, and that I saw our pursuer, like some monster of the deep, her canvas towering high above our own towards the sky, close to us.  Then she poured forth her broadsides, her shot with a crashing, rending sound passing across our deck.  Still we remained unharmed, and I heard the captain say, \"Give it them again, my lads--give it them again.\"  Our crew sprung to their guns; but there came another broadside from the enemy which carried away our masts and spars, pierced our bulwarks, knocking our boats to pieces. Still Harry and I stood on deck uninjured, and our crew appeared is undaunted and active as before.  I have often heard of people \"fighting their battles o'er again;\" but in this instance I fought mine before it occurred.  I was awakened by the stamping sound of the feet of the watch overhead as they ran along with the halyards; then came the cry, \"All hands on deck.\"  I jumped out of my berth, and found Harry slipping into his clothes.  No one else was in the cabin.  We hurried on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21490"],["title","The Two Supercargoes; Or, Adventures in Savage Africa (#7)"],["body","ck, where the officers and the watch below with the idlers had assembled.  I was surprised to find the brig once more before the wind and the crew engaged in making all sail.  The captain was standing aft issuing his orders, while the mates and boatswain were aiding the men in pulling and hauling.  We joined them without asking questions.  Some of the crew were aloft setting the top-gallant-sails and royals.  I wondered why this was done, but there was no time to ask questions.  At last, all the sail the brig could carry was set.  I then, having nothing further to do, went aft and asked the captain the reason of the change of course.  \"If you look astern you will see it,\" he said.  Shading my eyes with my hand, I gazed into the darkness, and there I at length discovered what the more practised eyes of the captain had long seen--the shadowy form of the stranger coming up under all sail towards us.  \"You see now why we have kept away,\" observed the captain.  \"Before the wind is our fastest point of sailing, and I wish that we had kept on it from the first.  That fellow out there must have hauled his wind soon after we lost sight of him.\"  \"Do you think she will come up with us?\"  I asked.  \"There is a great likelihood that she will,\" answered the captain; \"but a stern chase is a long chase, as every one knows.  Perhaps we may fall in with a man-of-war cruiser, when the tables will be turned; if not, as I said before, we must fight her.\"  \"With all my heart,\" I answered; and Harry echoed my words.  The stranger had by this time approached much nearer to us than before, or we should have been unable to see her.  We could thus no longer hope for an opportunity of escaping by altering our course.  \"It is my duty to stand on as long as I can, to give ourselves every chance of meeting with another craft, which may take a part in the game,\" observed the captain.  \"At all events, it will be daylight before we get within range of her guns, and you young gentlemen may as well turn in in the meantime and finish your night's rest.\"  Neither I nor Harry had any inclination, however, to do this.  The dream I had had still haunted my imagination, and I felt pretty sure that were I to go to sleep it would come back as vividly as before.  Stepping into the waist, I found Mr Tubbs, the boatswain.  \"Well, Tom, what do you think about the matter?\"  I asked.  \"Shall we have a brush with yonder craft which seems so anxious to make our acquaintance?\"  \"No doubt about it, Mr Westerton, and more than a brush too, I suspect. That ship out there is a big fellow, and will prove a tough customer. We shall have to show the stuff we are made of, and fight hard to beat him off.  I don't say but that we shall do it, but it will cost us dearly; for his people, we may be sure, know how to handle their guns; and from the height of his canvas I should say that he was twice our size, and probably carries double as many guns as we do, and musters three or four times more men.\"  \"Then I'm afraid that we shall have but a poor chance of beating him off,\" I observed.  \"There are always chances in war, and one of them may be in our favour; so it is our business to fight hard to the end.  A happy shot may knock away his masts and render him helpless, or enter his magazine and blow him up; or we may send half a dozen of our pills between wind and water, and compel him to keep all hands at the pumps, so that he will have no time to look after us.\"  \"But the same may happen to us,\" observed Harry.  \"Granted; those belong to the chances of war,\" answered Tom.  \"I was only speaking of those in our favour.  We must not think of the others; if the worst comes to the worst, we can but go to the bottom with our colours flying, as many pretty men have had to do before.\"  On the whole, Tom's remarks did not greatly increase our spirits.  Harry and I walked aft together.  \"One of us may fall, Dick,\" said Harry to me in a grave tone.  \"If I do, you will carry my last fond love to my mother and sister and poor Lucy, and say that my last thoughts were about them.\"  \"That I will,\" I answered.  \"And should I fall and you escape, you will see my parents, and tell your mother and sister Mary how to the last moment of my life I thought of them--how grateful I am for all their kindness to me.\"  The expressions we exchanged were but natural to young men who were about to engage for the first time in their lives in a desperate battle--for desperate we knew it must be, even should we come off victorious, if the stranger astern was, as we supposed, a pirate.  We paced the deck together.  The suspense we were doomed to undergo was more trying than when we were engaged in making or shortening sail, and the gale was blowing and the vessel tumbling about.  Now we were gliding calmly on, with nothing to do except occasionally to take a look astern at our expected enemy.  I began to long for daylight, and wished even to see the stranger come up within shot, so that we might ascertain to a certainty her true character.  At length a ruddy glow appeared beyond her in the east, gradually increasing in depth and brightness until the whole sky was suffused with an orange tint, and the sun, like a vast ball of fire, rose rapidly above the horizon, forming a glowing background to the sails of our pursuer, who came gliding along over the shining ocean towards us.  Already she was almost within range of our long gun, which the captain now ordered to be trained aft through one of the stern-ports.  The gun was loaded and run out.  \"Shall I fire, sir?\" asked Tom Tubbs, who acted as gunner as well as boatswain, running his eye along the piece.  \"Not until we can see her flag,\" answered the captain; \"she may, after all, be a man-of-war.  If we fire she may take us for a pirate, and we should get small credit for our bravery.  We shall see her colours presently if she yaws to fire at us.  Wait until I give the word.\"  In the meantime the magazine had been opened and powder and shot brought up on deck; the guns were loaded and run out, the arm-chest was also got up, and Harry and I, as did all on board, girded hangers to our sides and thrust pistols into our belts.  The captain shortly afterwards issued the order for all hands to be ready to shorten sail as soon as no chance remained of escaping without fighting.  Even now there was a hope that we might get away, or that the stranger might after all prove a friend instead of a foe; every rope was therefore kept belayed.  \"Long Tom,\" as the boatswain called his gun, was run out, it should be understood, under the poop on which Harry and I stood.  The captain had taken his post near the mizen rigging, so that he could see all parts alike, and his voice could be heard by Tom and the crew of the gun below him.  The mates were at their stations ready to shorten sail.  I had my spyglass turned towards our pursuer, endeavouring to get a glimpse of her flag should she have hoisted one, which she very certainly would have done were she a King's ship.  As I watched her, I could see that she was gaining upon us.  Objects which at first appeared indistinct were now clearly visible.  I could make out the men on the forecastle, but I saw no gun there with which she could return the compliment our \"Long Tom\" was about to pay her.  So far this was satisfactory.  \"Were she a King's ship she would have fired a gun without altering her course, as a signal for us to heave to,\" observed the captain.  Scarcely had he spoken than the stranger yawed--a gun was fired, and a shot came towards us, striking the water and sinking close under our counter.  At the same moment, raising my glass, I caught sight of the British ensign flying from the end of the peak.  \"Hurrah!\"  I exclaimed; \"she's a King's ship, and we are all right.\"  \"We must not be too sure of that,\" observed Harry; \"pirates can hoist false colours.  We want better proof of her honesty before we heave to. Had she been well disposed, she would not have sent that iron messenger after us.\"  For some time longer the \"Arrow\" stood on her course, while the stranger, keeping directly astern, did not alter hers.  I expected every moment to hear our captain give the word to fire, but he refrained from doing so.  Suspicious as was the behaviour of our pursuer, still I thought it possible that, after all, she might be a King's ship, and had shown her proper colours.  Presently, however, she yawed, her studding-sails fluttering as she did so, being almost taken back.  Two spouts of flame, followed quickly by a couple of round shot, issued from her bow-ports.  That the shot were fired with evil intent was evident, for one struck our larboard quarter close below where I was standing, and knocked away the carved work, while the other, flying high, passed close above our heads, and fell into the water not a dozen fathoms from the ship.  Before her helm could again be put up, Captain Magor shouted, \"Give it them, Tubbs,\" and our \"Long Tom,\" with a loud roar, sending forth a spout of flame, pitched a shot right through the fore part of her bulwarks, and I could see the splinters fly as it struck them.  \"Load and fire away as fast as you can,\" cried the captain; \"if that's a King's ship, she fired first, and must take the consequences.\"  I should have felt more satisfied had I been convinced that the captain was right, but still I could not help fancying that she was a royal cruiser, and that we might be committing a terrible mistake.  Shot after shot was now aimed at our pursuer.  Tom Tubbs and his men hauling in and loading the gun with a rapidity which only well-trained hands could have done.  Few of our shots--as far as I could judge--appeared to be so successfully aimed as the first had been.  Still I heard Captain Magor shouting out, \"Well done, my lads; never saw a gun better served.  Wing her if you can; knock away her foremast, and twenty golden guineas shall be yours.\"  The stranger all this time did not return our fire,"]]]
