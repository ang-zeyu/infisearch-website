It's my little way.  I _am_ so pretty and undulating,\" and instantly the titters burst out afresh.  Rhoda's face was a study, but even as she sat fuming with passion, a voice spoke in her ear from the side where Brown Eyes still studied her advertisements.  \"Laugh, can't you?\" said the voice.  \"Laugh, too, as if you enjoyed the joke.  It's the only way.  They will go on all the more if they see you are angry.\"  \"I hate them all!\" hissed Rhoda savagely, and the other heaved a sigh.  \"Ah, so do I, but they shan't hate me if I know it!  I'm sorry I snapped, but I'll talk now, and for pity's sake don't look so dismal. Let us look over this paper together, and make remarks, and smile as if we were enjoying ourselves too.\"  \"I don't feel as if I should ever enjoy myself again.  It's hateful going to school.  If I had known it was as bad as this I would never have come.\"  \"There's a lake in the grounds.  We will drown ourselves together after tea, but in the meantime do please keep up appearances.  Don't give yourself away before all these girls!\"  Rhoda looked at her curiously, and felt a thrill of comfort at finding a friend in the midst of her desolation.  \"What is your name?\" she queried eagerly, and the dark eyes met hers in a solemn stare.  \"Marah, for bitterness.  That's how I feel to-day, anyhow.  My godmothers and godfather christened me Dorothy, and in festive moments I have even answered to `Doll,' but I'd murder any one who called me that to-day.  Now, I'll show you something interesting...  I've travelled on this line before, and if you look out of the window you can catch a glimpse of Hurst Manor as we pass the next station.  It stands in its own grounds with nothing between it and the line.  Over there to the right--you can't miss it if you keep your eyes open.  Now!  There!  That gaunt, grey building.\"  Rhoda looked, and there it lay--a gaunt building, indeed, with row upon row of tall, bare windows staring like so many eyes, and out-standing wings flanked like sentinels on either side.  The poor recruit's face lengthened with horror.  \"It looks,\" she said dismally, \"like a prison!  It looks as if when you once got in, you would never never get out any more!\"    CHAPTER FIVE.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS.  Ten minutes later the journey came to an end, and the girls surged out on to the platform of the country station.  A line of waggonettes, cheerfully denominated \"Black Marias\" by the pupils, was in waiting, and with less confusion than might have been expected the girls divided into different parties, and seated themselves in the carriages marked with their own house colours.  Rhoda and her travelling companions, being all \"blue,\" were among the first to drive off, each girl clutching the handbag which contained the immediate necessities of her toilet, and chattering away at the pitch of her voice.  \"Square Face\" was evidently the wag of the party, and was treated with an admiring deference which seemed to bespeak a position of importance.  She was professionally addressed as \"Tom,\" and Rhoda from her seat opposite, read the words, \"Thomasina Bolderston,\" upon the label of the bag, and reflected that she had never heard a name more entirely appropriate to its owner.  It was at once so ugly, so uncommon, and so arresting to the memory, while Tom herself, once seen, could never be forgotten, nor confounded with another girl.  There she sat, the keen autumn air blanching her cheeks and reddening her eyes, her arms crossed squarely over her bag, her lips twitching with mischievous enjoyment.  She had but to roll her eyes, and the girls went into fresh convulsions of laughter; and when, at the entrance to \"Hurst\" grounds, she took out her handkerchief and affected to sob, the merriment reached an almost hysterical pitch.  Rhoda, however, failed to appreciate the humour of the joke, being inclined to cry in good truth as the grim doorway yawned before her, and she caught a glimpse of the chill, grey hall, so different from the glowing warmth of her own dear home.  Dorothy gripped her arm in sympathetic fashion as they alighted and fell into position in the long line of girls, who had suddenly thrown off their hoyden airs, and assumed a demeanour of severe propriety.  The queue wended its serpentine course down the hall itself, and across a smaller corridor to the head of the great staircase, where stood a lady in a black silk dress, and a cap with lavender ribbons, crowning bands of iron-grey hair.  She was in reality small of stature, but she held herself with an air which gave her the appearance of being six feet high at least, and as she shook hands with each girl she addressed to her a word of greeting.  \"How do you do, Mary?  Glad to see you, Kathleen.  Hope you are better, Ella.  Welcome back, Carrie!\" and so on, and so on.  Occasionally there came a hesitation, and the greeting terminated without a name being added, but whenever this was the case there was a knitting of the brows which showed distinct annoyance.  Miss Bruce evidently took a pride in remembering her pupils, and was hard on herself for any forgetfulness. When it came to the turn of the new girls, she detained them a moment to hope they would be happy, before waving them forward with an encouraging smile.  \"That's what we call being `presented.'  She is the Queen, and on the next landing are `the Lords,' and on the second `the Commons,'\" whispered a girl, who being herself only in her second term was not averse from posing as preceptor.  Rhoda lifted her eyes and beheld an array of governesses standing before her, shaking hands and welcoming the pupils in their turn.  Some looked formidable and learned, some did not.  Some had the orthodox braided locks and spectacles, some even condescended to the frivolity of a `fringe,' but one and all bore themselves with a dignity worthy of a foremost position in the newest of all new schools.  Rhoda passed by as in a dream, and felt far more interest in \"the Commons,\" who were for the most part young women removed from girlhood by so slight a barrier that there was a tone of comradeship in their voices, a sympathetic understanding in their glance.  The sweetest looking of all was evidently in special charge of the Blues, and, walked by the side of the two new girls as the detachment filed along the endless corridor towards its own apartments.  \"You two are sisters?  No!  Ah, well, you must pretend you are, for a day or two at least, until you get over the first loneliness.  Every one feels lonely at first among such a crowd of strangers, but it soon passes, and we are very happy together.  You must come and sit with me in my little den sometimes.  I'll ask you to tea on Sunday, and you must always come to me if you are in any difficulty.  In the meantime do as the other girls do, and you will get along quite easily.  You are in the same room.  Wash and get ready for tea at once.  The gong will ring in half an hour, and after that your boxes will have arrived and you will be able to unpack.\"  They reached the door of the dormitory as she finished speaking, and the girls entered, trying not to feel as if they were being introduced to a prison cell, or to be unduly cast down because they were separated by half the length of the room.  \"If we could have been next each other and just wobbled the curtain occasionally it would have been friendly!\" sighed Rhoda, sinking down on the solitary chair and gazing forlornly round her new abode.  A bed, a wash-stand, a chest of drawers with a glass on top, a small fixture wardrobe, and about three yards of space on which to disport her own fair self--different quarters, indeed, from her room at home, with its spacious floor, its deep bay windows, its adjoining dressing-room and bathroom!  When the curtains were drawn there was a feeling of cramped confinement which was most depressing to the spirits; yet, as her eye took in one detail after the other, Rhoda realised that there were redeeming points in the situation.  Small as it was, the cubicle was decidedly pretty, and blue enough to satisfy the blondest of mistresses. Blue was the paint on the walls, blue the mat on the floor, blue and white the coverlet on the bed, blue the quaintly shaped china on the wash-stand.  She remembered with a thrill of satisfaction that her own bags and cases were of the same hue, and took off her hat feeling that she had found an oasis in the desert of life.  Half-an-hour seemed a long time to prepare for tea, when no change of garment was possible, but it passed so quickly that the sound of the gong came as a surprise, and she emerged from her retreat to find her room-mates already filing towards the door.  Thomasina led the way, staring at Rhoda's locks with an amusement which the girl found it hard to fathom.  She had brushed out the curling mane with even greater care than usual, and was conscious that it was as tidy as nature had intended it should be.  Then why stare and smile?  She could not understand, but Thomasina only said enigmatically--  \"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may!  Come on, Fuzzy!\" and led the way out into the corridor.  Lines of girls were appearing on every side--along this corridor, along that, down narrow nights of stairs, around unexpected corners, all converging steadily on the central staircase.  It was like a game of \"Follow my leader,\" and Rhoda could not but admire the ease and skill with which \"Tom\" avoided collision, and marshalled her party to its own table in the great dining-hall.  When every one was seated, and grace said, the clatter of cups and saucers began, and Rhoda had her first experience of a school meal.  Well! the tea was very welcome, and it certainly was hot, but somehow or other it did not taste like the tea at home.  There was so much \"cup\" about it--perhaps that was the explanation.  It was quite an effort "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],["title","Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#7)"],["body","get one's lips over the rim.  Thickness seemed to be the order of the day when one looked from the china to the slices of bread and butter piled in the many plates.  One such chunk would make a meal in itself, thought Rhoda, nibbling fastidiously at the first slice, but whether from the fatigue of the long journey or the stimulating effect of companionship, her appetite seemed to be unusually keen, and when it was finished she put out her hand to take a second slice.  Instantly Thomasina's voice rang out in warning.  \"Stop that, Fuzzy! That's forbidden!\"  Rhoda stared at her in dignified displeasure.  \"My name happens to be Rhoda Chester!\"  \"Congratulate you, I'm sure.  Couldn't be sweeter; but you mustn't break rules, Rhoda Chester, all the same.  The rule in this school is that no girl helps herself at meals, or asks for more, or pays any attention to her own plate.\"  \"But if I am hungry?  If I _want_ more?  How am I to get it?\"  \"You must rely on the thoughtfulness and attention of your neighbours. Each girl is supposed to look after those beside her, but if she forgets you must starve in silence, knowing that you suffer in a good cause.  I find myself that a slight nudge applied to the elbow just as the cup is being carried to the mouth is a useful and judicious reminder...  Let me press a piece of plum-cake upon you, Miss Chester!\"  She held out the plate of bread with her squarest smile, and Rhoda smiled back with a curious sense of elation.  She questioned herself curiously as to its cause, and made the surprising discovery that it was because Thomasina had spoken to her, and showed some faint signs of friendliness!  Tea over, there was another game of \"Follow my leader,\" to the top story of the building this time, where all the length of a corridor was lined by baggage, with the mysterious addition of a flat wicker clothes-basket beside each trunk.  The house-mistress, Miss Everett, was flitting to and fro, and explained to the bewildered new girls that as the cubicles afforded no room for the accommodation boxes they must unpack upstairs, and carry down their possessions to store in drawers and wardrobes.  For the next hour and a half, therefore, the curious scene was witnessed of sixty pupils staggering downstairs in turns under the weight of heavy baskets of clothes, and meeting with sundry adventures by the way.  Lazy girls gave themselves the usual additional share of trouble by overweighting their load and toppling it over on the floor; hasty girls tripped on the stairs and collapsed in a heap, with a rain of boots falling on their head and pins showering broadcast through the banisters; careless girls took a rest to ease aching backs, then nipped up the wrong basket and bore it away, to reappear ten minutes later, puffing and injured, and receive indignant reproaches from the rightful owners.  Rhoda worked with a will, undisturbed by any such interruptions.  It was with the unconsciousness of habit that she shook out her silk-lined skirts, on lifting them from the box, but the rustling sound could not be mistaken, and instantly she was aware that the girls on either side were mincing round in affected fashion, shaking out their own skirts, and simpering meaningly in her direction.  At the first glance from her eyes they became statues of propriety, but she felt their ridicule, and catching the giggles of laughter which followed her retreat blushed over cheek and neck in an agony of mortification.  After all, was it appropriate to bring fine clothes to school?  Where the rules of the house were plain living and high thinking, was it not better to dress accordingly?  Might not display savour of ignorance, of lack of perception, of--oh, horrors!--of snobbishness itself?  The new dresses hung neglected on their pegs, and Rhoda put on a silk blouse with her serge skirt, and walked down to supper in mental sackcloth and ashes.  But here was a pleasant surprise!  The room was not grey any longer, but flooded with rosy light from the pink-hued shades which covered the electric burners.  The girls, too, were no longer clad in dark blue as in a uniform, but shone forth in blouses of brilliant hues, pink, blue, red, and white alternating gaily, with an occasional green or yellow to add to the variety.  There was in the atmosphere an indefinable air of relaxation, of rest after labour, which added tenfold to the brightness of the scene.  What if on each plate there was only a morsel of fish, not half enough to satisfy clamourous appetites, there was unlimited bread and jam to follow, and if cocoa was not the drink of all others which one would have chosen, it was at least wholesome and satisfying. Rhoda ate and was thankful, and felt ready for bed even before the summons came.  Several times during the day, when her feelings had threatened to become too keen for endurance, but pride had forbidden outward demonstration, she had cherished a determination to cry comfortably in bed; but when the time came she was so sleepy, so exhausted with excitement, the bed was so unexpectedly sympathetic, that she forgot her resolution, and, snoodling down on the pillow, fell swiftly and happily asleep.    CHAPTER SIX.  TOM'S RULE.  The next moment, as it seemed, there came the roll of a distant gong, and instantly there burst into life a score of jangling bells, clanging and tinkling over one's very head in a manner calculated to destroy the strongest nerves.  Rhoda felt an agonised certainty that the Chase was on fire, and springing up was confronted by the blue walls of her little cubicle.  Memory came back then, and with a pang of regret she lay back in bed, listening to the succession of groans, yawns, and sighs which arose from every corner of the room.  They were so eloquent that one could almost _see_ the sleepers stretching themselves in turn, blinking heavy lids, and rubbing dishevelled locks like so many sleek, lazy kittens.  For a moment no one spoke, then began a chorus of lamentations.  \"Seven o'clock!  It can't be true.  I haven't slept a wink all night!\"  \"I've been getting up at half-past eight all the holidays, and having a cup of tea in bed before that.  It's killing going back to this!\"  \"Wait till the mornings are dark, and the water is frozen in the jugs; that's the time it is really fun.  This is a mere trifle.\"  \"It's not a trifle at all.  I'm a growing girl, and need sleep.  If Miss Bruce had any heart she would see it, and give me an excuse.\"  \"She'll give you a mark instead, if you are not quick.  Hurry up now! No laggards!\" cried Thomasina's voice, in answer to which there came still louder groans, and the creaking of bedsteads as one girl after another rose to her feet.  Rhoda rose with the rest, and for ten minutes there was silence, broken only by the splashing of water.  Then suddenly the air was filled with a deep, melodious roll, at which, as at a signal, Thomasina appeared from her lair--beautiful in a magenta dressing-jacket, and hair coiled in a tight little knot at the top of her head--and opened wide the door of the dormitory.  Rhoda, peering from between her curtains could see other doors opening all the way down the corridor, and bare arms hastily withdrawn from view, while all the time the music swelled into fuller force, and pealed over the great, silent house like some majestic wakening voice.  \"What is it?\" she queried breathlessly, and Thomasina answered from behind her curtain:  \"The organ, of course.  The organ in the hall.  One of the music mistresses plays a voluntary every morning ten minutes after we get up, and the choir sings a hymn.  You will hear them presently.  Each house takes it in turn to do choir duty.  It's the Greens this week.\"  As she spoke the first note of the hymn sounded, and the words rose clearly on the air:--    \"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,   Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee.   Holy, holy, holy, Merciful and Mighty,   God in Three Persons, Blessed Trinity!\"  The clear voices were softened by distance into almost angelic sweetness, the treble rang true and sweet against the harmonious background of alto; the organ sank to a flute-like softness.  It was an unexpected and beautiful beginning to the day's work, and the tears started to Rhoda's eyes as she listened, for she was of an emotional nature, quick to respond to any outside influence.  She followed each line of the hymn with devout attention, and when it was finished knelt down beside her bed to offer a prayer, which was much longer and more fervent than it would have been ten minutes before.  She prayed for strength, for guidance, and--with a remembrance of yesterday's trials-- for patience too, that she might be able to take a joke in good part, and not value too highly her own dignity, and finally rose from her knees in a glow of virtuous resolution.  No sooner was she out of her cubicle than the blow descended.  With the glow of good resolution still upon her, she was tried--and fell!  Thomasina regarded her critically, and said, with a cool assurance more maddening than downright rudeness:  \"That coiffure is very becoming, Fuzzy, but it won't do here.  Go back to your den, and plait it in a pigtail like mine!\"  The glare of indignation, of scorn, of outraged dignity in Rhoda's eyes was beyond description.  She straightened her back into a poker of obstinacy, and replied--  \"I shall do no such thing!  I shall wear my hair as I choose, and as I have always worn it.\"  \"No you won't, my dear.  Pigtails are the rule in this establishment, and pigtails you must wear so long as you are within its walls.\"  \"If a teacher tells me to wear one, I shall obey.  If it is a rule, some one in authority will tell me.  I won't be ordered by you.\"  There was a gasp of astonishment throughout the room, and one head after another peered out to stare at the rebellious spirit who dared to defy that important personage, the Head Girl.  Thomasina closed her eyes and smiled in maddening"]]]
