Many strange birds flew by overhead, and still stranger wild animals started up from beneath some sheltering bush, and ran off along the fresh glades, all reminding the new-comers how far distant they were from the home of their childhood.  The old settled district had been left far behind before the animal they most wished to see started up near them.  He was a large creature, full five feet in height as he sat upright under the scant shade of a venerable gum tree, contemplating apparently the scene before him.  His long tail was stretched out on the ground behind him--an important support, and his little fore-paws tucked up in front.  James and Arthur were ahead of their party, and so quietly had their horses trod over the soft ground that he did not appear to have heard them.  They possessed guns, parting gifts from Mr Prentiss; but, not being required as a means of defence or offence, they had been left in the dray.  The kangaroo (\"an old man\" Larry called him) at length, hearing a sound, turned his mild, intelligent countenance towards them, and as he did so instantly gave a spring forward, startling them by its suddenness and the extent of ground it cleared.  Away he went, moving with similar springs, at a rate fleet as that of the deer.  In vain Larry and the men with the dray shouted and ran after him with their guns.  He was out of range before they could lift them to their shoulders.  Larry said that possibly a mob might be come upon before long.  In another hour or so, as they were travelling along a somewhat stony ridge, a large number of creatures were seen in the fertile valley below them.  Some were lying stretched at length on their sides, some were frisking about, round and over each other, and others were sitting up, sedately watching the rest.  \"Hurra, now!  There's the mob I told you of!\" shouted Larry.  \"If we had but the dogs and the master's rifle, we'd have more kangaroo steaks for supper than we'd eat in a week.\"  He could scarcely restrain himself from leaving his bullocks and giving chase; he made a start indeed, but checked himself in time, seeing that the probable result would have been the upsetting of his dray and the destruction of most of its cargo.  The young Gilpins with Sam found their way down the hill, hoping to ride down one of them; but the quick scent and keen eyes of the animals discovered their approach, and in an instant all were up on their feet and tails ready for a start--the mothers picking up the young joeys and putting them into their pouches-- and off went the entire herd down the valley, springing along in the most curious fashion, till they were out of sight.  Sam Green's open eyes of astonishment were very amusing.  \"Well!  I always did think that animals had four legs, and there they go just two and a tail, a-skipping like grasshoppers over the ground.  Well, well, well!\" he continued ejaculating till they disappeared.  \"There they go; there they go!  There's nothing I won't believe after that!\"  Their adventures as they travelled on were to be singularly few, they thought.  Now a dingo or wild dog, now a toombat or opossum, made its appearance, and created matter of interest and inquiry.  One evening, after they had camped on the borders of a wide plain, containing fine sheep-runs, which they were to cross the next day, the brothers led on their horses to find better feed than appeared near at hand; and, having tethered them, they sat down to talk over the future, and to commune with themselves.  Their heads had been resting on their hands for some time, when Arthur, looking up, saw a creature approaching from a distance.  That it was an emu they guessed at once.  They sat still, afraid of frightening it away.  It stalked leisurely on towards their horses, not noticing them.  Its head seemed fully six feet from the ground, at the end of a long neck; its legs were thick, to support its fat, tub-shaped body, of a brownish-black colour.  Reaching the horses, it stopped, made a curious noise, which sounded like \"Boo!\" in their faces, and which caused them to start back.  James and Arthur, thinking that their steeds would have broken their tethers, jumped up, when the emu, having satisfied his curiosity, turned round and trotted off, at a pace which showed that he had no fear of being pursued.  Towards the close of the day the travellers, after crossing an elevated down, saw before them a silvery stream running through a wide valley towards the east, its banks fringed by a variety of trees; while not far from them, amid a grove of fruit trees, appeared a pretty dwelling-house, with a verandah running round it, and near at hand, barns, sheds, stables, and other outhouses.  A closer inspection showed them that there were carpenters' and blacksmiths shops; indeed, it was a complete farm establishment on a large scale.  As riding on, in advance of the dray, they reached the door, a stout, hearty-looking old gentleman came out to meet them, and welcomed them in the most cordial manner.  Their horses were quickly unsaddled and turned into a paddock, and they themselves conducted into the house, and introduced to the members of the family as late arrivals from the old country.  All welcomed them; and they were soon seated at a well-covered supper-table, surrounded by the various inmates of the house.  The young strangers were surprised to find that the letter of introduction they brought had not been read, and that the kindness they were receiving was quite independent of anything that might be said in their favour.  It was not till the next day that the old Mr Prentiss alluded to it.  \"We received you, young gentlemen, as strangers,\" he remarked; \"but I little thought how much I owed you for saving from injury, if not death, those so dear to me.\"  James and Arthur Gilpin agreed that their \"lines had fallen to them in pleasant places.\"  They were treated as members of the family, and, what was of the greatest consequence to them as intending settlers, they were shown all the operations taking place on the farm.  As they gave diligent attention to everything they saw, they rapidly acquired a sufficient knowledge of agriculture and of the management of sheep and cattle, as practised in Australia, to enable them, with their previous experience as farmers in England, to commence farming on their own account.  While, however, they were in search of a station to suit them, Mr Prentiss received an application to find a gentleman capable of taking the management of a sheep and cattle farm, about a hundred and fifty miles off.  \"Quite in our neighbourhood, as we measure distances in this country,\" he remarked.  He proposed to the young Gilpins that they should accept the post.  \"You will be allowed to keep a proportion of sheep and cattle on your own account, and receive wages for looking after those of your employer, so that you will gain in both ways.  You will find also an established system by which, if it prove a good one, time and labour may be saved.  I would gladly find you employment, but this will be far more to your advantage.  It was hoped, I believe, that one of my own sons would take it.\"  The brothers at once agreed to accept the offer.    CHAPTER THREE.  The Gilpins no longer felt like newly arrived immigrants when they found themselves on their way to Warragong, the station of which they had undertaken charge.  They were far, however, from being over-confident of success, or of pleasing their employers; but they had resolved to make up by diligence and perseverance for their want of experience, and Mr Prentiss assured them that he had no doubt of their doing well.  Sam Green had thrown in his lot with them, and though receiving good wages from Mr Prentiss, he begged that he might be allowed to accompany them on the chance of their being able to give him permanent employment. Knowing by this time the value of a thoroughly trustworthy servant in Australia, they were very glad to accept his offer.  They, as well as Sam, had been furnished with excellent horses; and, much to his own satisfaction as well as theirs, Larry Killock was sent with a light cart to convey their luggage and various luxuries, which had been provided through the kindness of Mrs Prentiss.  A native black, partly civilised, and able to speak broken English, accompanied them as guide, and formed the fifth person of this party.  He either travelled in the cart or ran on foot beside it.  \"I should think that very few settlers begin a life in the bush with so many advantages as we possess,\" observed Arthur, as he rode on with his brother, a little ahead of the cart; \"we appear to have jumped over all difficulties, and to have arrived at a point which many only reach after years of toil.\"  \"I am not quite certain that it will prove to our permanent advantage,\" answered James.  \"I would rather have begun as we proposed, and worked our way upward; we should the better be able to encounter difficulties or mishaps which may occur.\"  \"Well, I vote we do not grumble with our good fortune,\" said Arthur, laughing; \"we shall have plenty to do, depend on that.\"  There was no great variety of scenery in that part of the country over which they travelled, but for the want of it the beauty of the climate, and the sense of present freedom which they enjoyed, made ample amends. Without luggage they might have performed the journey in three days, but with the cart, twenty or, at the most, thirty miles could not be got over in the day.  Even supposing that they could have found their way alone, it would not have been altogether safe to leave the cart without protection.  Bushrangers were occasionally, though rarely, heard of, and would probably, if they fell in with the cart, make no scruple of running off with it, and perhaps murder the driver.  Any wandering blacks from the interior might also pillage the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21464"],["title","The Gilpins and their Fortunes: A Story of Early Days in Australia (#4)"],["body","rt, and most probably kill poor Larry.  Larry had been entertaining Sam Green with an account of the depredations committed by such gentry in the bygone days of the colony, when the Dick Turpins, who had obtained a short-lived celebrity on the highway of Old England, laid the settlers in this new land under contribution; and the white stockmen shot down the black natives with as little compunction as they would kangaroos; the blacks, in retaliation, murdering them or any white men they could meet with.  Larry, observing the wide-mouthed interest created by his narratives, went on till poor Sam began to wish himself safe out of the country again.  They were crossing a wide plain, with a light soil thickly covered with grass.  A cloud of dust was seen to the right of the direction in which they were travelling; it increased in extent, and rose higher and higher.  \"Be them the niggers coming to murder us?\" asked Sam, in a fright.  \"If them are niggers, they're big ones, my boy, anyhow,\" answered Larry, evasively.  A dull, regular, pounding sound was heard, and at length dark forms were seen issuing from the cloud of dust--a few first, and then more and more, resolving themselves into bullocks, black, white, and dun, galloping on and bellowing with might and main.  Horsemen appeared on either side, like officers on a parade, and with their long whips, which they kept on cracking like pistol-shots, they kept order among their unruly charge.  Shouting and shrieking, they galloped round from the rear to the side to bring back any beast which showed an intention of straying away, their dogs sagaciously rendering them assistance by barking at the heels of the animals, and turning them back into the herd.  What with the thunder-like bellowing of the cattle and the tramp of their feet, the shouting of the drivers, the cracking of their whips, the barking of the dogs, the dust from the ground, and the steam from the creatures' backs, as, lashing their long tails, they tore onwards, jostling each other in their course, their sharp horns lowered for the charge, the approaching herd appeared like some vast army of savage monsters, rushing on to meet their foes in battle.  To draw up out of their way was impossible, and the travellers soon found themselves surrounded by the herd; the creatures, however, turned their horns aside, while the shape of their own heads and the width of their backs prevented them from running them into their companions in front or on either side, in spite of the seemingly confused way in which they were hurrying on.  The herd had passed, when two of the principal drivers, who, in spite of their rough dress and hair-covered countenances, appeared to be gentlemen, drew up and saluted the Gilpins with \"Good day, friends; whither bound?\"  \"To Warragong, to take charge of the station,\" said James.  \"I wish you joy,\" remarked one of the strangers; \"you will have no easy task, I take it.  A sad scoundrel has had the management of it for some time, as we know to our cost, having once employed him.  I am afraid, also, from the sort of men he always gets about him, that you will have no small trouble with them.\"  The strangers informed them that they were bound south to the Port Philip district, where there was a great demand for cattle.  As the evening was approaching, the parties agreed to camp together. Fires were lighted, the triangles erected, and the pots were soon boiling, while the quickly made damper was placed under the ashes to bake for the coming meal.  None of the party, however, could keep their seats by the fire long, without being often summoned to their feet, and sometimes to their saddles, to drive in the straying bullocks.  It seemed as hard work to keep them together when resting as to drive them forward, but neither master nor men were disconcerted; they rushed here and there with shout and song and laughter, till they had brought back the straying cattle, and then they sat down by the fire, or rolled themselves up in their blankets, as if nothing had happened.  The Gilpins were sorry to part from their new friends, whose frank, hearty manners had won their regard.  The morning meal of tea, damper, and pork having been discussed, they rode off in opposite directions.  \"Not pleasant information this, our friends gave us last night,\" said Arthur.  \"What can we do?\"  \"Wait events,\" answered his brother; \"forewarned is forearmed.  We will keep our knowledge to ourselves, though it will be necessary to advise Green not to trust to any of the men, so as to be led into mischief by them.  Perhaps the accounts of their misconduct may have been exaggerated.\"  Travelling in Australia has its disagreeables as well as its agreeables: there are heavy rains and fogs and sharp winds in winter; and in summer, scorching blasts and stifling heat, and biting or stinging insects, flying, and crawling, and hopping, and dust and smoke from bush fires and the burning trees, and want, at times, of water; but, notwithstanding these occasional drawbacks, so delightful is the perfect freedom to be enjoyed, the pure, bright atmosphere, and the general healthfulness of the climate, that in the opinion of most people the advantages very greatly preponderate.  The brothers had expected to reach the station in the afternoon, but an accident to the cart caused some delay, and the sun set before it appeared in sight.  Their black guide, however, assured them that the intervening country was tolerably level and easy, and that as there were certain woods he knew well, and a river on the other side, they could not miss their way.  Accordingly they pushed on, though it became so dark that they began to wish that they had camped at the usual hour. Suddenly, as they reached the confines of a wood, their horses snorted and started, and refused to proceed--those in the cart very nearly upsetting it by turning rapidly round; and, had not Sam caught their heads, they would have galloped off in an opposite direction.  Directly afterwards, a bright light burst forth from the wood and a spectacle appeared sufficient to make even a stout heart, with any tendency to superstitious feelings, tremble.  From among the trees, just beyond the light, appeared, flitting in and out, some twenty or thirty blanched skeletons, throwing their bony arms and legs with the greatest rapidity into every conceivable attitude.  Now they disappeared in the darkness, now again they darted into light; round and round they went, now seeming to sink into the ground, now leaping into the air, and often turning head over heels.  All the time not a sound proceeded from the phantom-looking dancers.  The Gilpins could scarcely help fancying themselves under some delusion.  They rubbed their eyes.  \"What is it?\" exclaimed Arthur.  \"Horrible! most horrible!  Do you see the skeletons?\"  \"Indeed I do,\" answered his brother; \"but such things cannot be--are not--at all events.\"  Sam Green had hitherto been engaged with the horses; he now came up to the point where the hideous spectacle was visible, and no sooner did his eyes rest on it than he exclaimed, \"Run, squires, run!  If it was mortal foes I'd stick by ye; but that's more than any mortal man can dare to face.  Oh! this is a terrible country, where the people cannot lie quiet in graves, but must needs go skipping about without any flesh on their bones.\"  \"The hoighth of ondacency!\" cried out Larry, in a voice which showed very little, if any, alarm.  \"Murra, go and tell your ugly countrymen that they are frightening the horses, and that they must turn their other sides to us till we have passed.\"  This order was given to the guide, who ran fearlessly up to the spot where the skeleton dance was proceeding, and no sooner did he reach it than the whole vanished like magic.  \"It's only some black fellows dancing a Corroborry,\" said the Irishman, laughing; \"you needn't be in such a mighty tremble, Sam.  We haven't the shred of a ghost out here; there may be some in the old country, but they're not fond of the salt sea, and couldn't cross it, not if they were paid for it, except they came out at the expense of the Government, like some other honest gintlemen I've heard spake of.\"  The horses, however, were still very unwilling to proceed, and it was some time before they could be coaxed past the suspicious spot; they then set off at increased speed to get away from the object of their dread.  The party pulled up for the black, who came running up.  \"No good people,\" he said, in a low voice; \"come here, do bad.\"  The Gilpins, hearing his remarks, endeavoured to discover the reason of his supposing that the party of natives they had just passed were badly disposed, but could elicit no further information from him.  It was more than an hour after this that a glimmering light appeared ahead, which Murra, the guide, assured them must proceed from the station.  It appeared to be somewhat above them on the hillside, and they soon afterwards found themselves ascending slightly towards it.  They had not got far, however, before several large dogs flew out, barking furiously, towards them.  They and Larry shouted loudly to the hut-keeper to call the animals off, but no one appeared, and, the dogs contenting themselves with barking, they proceeded on to the hut, from the window of which the light gleamed out.  The dogs, still loudly barking, at length roused up a couple of rough-looking men, who staggered out of the door, and, one of them holding a lamp, stared stupidly at the travellers, at the same time that, with loud oaths, he shouted to the dogs to be quiet.  \"Oh! you are strangers,\" said the least tipsy; \"well, you shall have a stranger's welcome in the bush; and so you may just go and turn out your horses, and then come and get what you can inside.\"  \"We've come to take charge of the station,\" said James, rather nettled; \"so, my men, I rather think that it is your duty to see and make yourselves useful to us.\"  \"Ho! ho!"]]]
