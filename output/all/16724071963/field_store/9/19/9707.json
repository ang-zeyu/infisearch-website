The Pharisees likewise do as much as that!  In storybooks the nurses always stay on, whether they are ruined or not, and give their money to help.  You _are_ mean!\"  \"No impertinence, please,\" said Nannie sharply.  She was just beginning to comb out Maud's hair, and it was astonishing how many knots there appeared to be that evening.  \"I'm sorry I spoke,\" reflected poor Maud.    CHAPTER FOUR.  In the next week future plans were practically settled so far as the young people were concerned.  Rowena had been right in her surmise about the boys, for, like most fathers, Mr Saxon was prepared to retrench in any and every direction rather than interfere with the education of his sons.  It was a family tradition that the eldest son should go into the army; therefore, at all costs, Hereward must continue that tradition. The Saxons had for generations been Eton boys, therefore it was impossible that Gurth could attend another school.  As to the girls-- well, Mr Saxon dearly loved his three daughters, and was proud of their grace and beauty, but in effect he held much the same ideas with regard to their education as those which Hereward had expounded to his sisters' indignation.  He thought it quite unnecessary to spend large sums on schooling for girls, and for his own part frankly preferred a woman who had no pretensions to being a blue-stocking.  The boys received the intelligence with a complacent sense that all was as it should be, and the one great anxiety being relieved, were disposed to make light of minor privations.  What though the manner of living at home must necessarily be less luxurious than of yore, holidays occupied, after all, a small portion of the year, and in a few years' time they would be launching out for themselves.  Hereward had an ambition to join an Indian regiment.  Gurth was destined for the Civil Service.  The Meads would be quite a good old place in which to spend an occasional furlough.  But the girls!  The girls were by no means reconciled to being sacrificed on the altar of masculine ambition.  When the programme for their own future was announced by the nervously anxious mother, Rowena, Etheldreda, and Maud were alike consumed with indignation and dismay.  They could hardly believe the evidence of their own ears as they listened to her words:  \"Father thought I had better have a little talk with you, dear girls, and explain to you what we have decided about your future.  It has been a difficult question--very difficult, and we have had to face alterations which we would thankfully have avoided, for in the end it simply comes down to the bare question of what we can or cannot afford. The boys' education is unfortunately very costly, and those expenses cannot be reduced.\"  \"Why?\" demanded Dreda.  The crisp, sharp question cut like a lash across Mrs Saxon's soft-toned explanation, and she started, and faced her young daughter with a shrinking almost of dismay.  Perhaps in her heart of hearts she, too, doubted the justice of the masculine mandate that girls should invariably be sacrificed for boys, but she was too loyal to admit any dissension when her husband had laid down his commands.  \"Why, Dreda?\" she repeated, gently.  \"Because the boys have their way to make in the world ...  If we have not much money to leave them, we must at least give them every chance of success.  Their education will be their capital.\"  \"An officer in the army needs a large private allowance.  Father has always said so.  Hereward will need to be helped all his life, instead of being able to help the family as an eldest son should do ...  He could go into business.\"  \"Oh, Dreda dear!  You, who are so sympathetic and kind-hearted.  Think of the terrible disappointment!  There always has been a soldier in the family.\"  \"The family has always been rich.  Of course I don't want him to be disappointed.  I don't want _anyone_ to be disappointed,\" declared Dreda with an emphasis which brought the colour into her mother's thin cheeks. \"I suppose I can go to Madame Clerc's at Easter, just the same?\"  \"I--I am afraid ...  Madame Clerc's is a very expensive school, darling. I am afraid it is out of the question!  We will do all we can for you. That is one of the principal things which we have had on our minds the last week, and I trust--I believe we have made satisfactory arrangements.  Miss Bruce does not feel able to give you finishing lessons, but Mrs Webster, of Swithin, tells me that she is quite satisfied with the school to which she has sent her three daughters. The education is all that could be desired, and the fees much more moderate than Madame Clerc's.  We should see more of you, too, darling, for you would be able to come home for the exeats in the middle of the term--\"  \"Mother!  What are you saying?  You can't possibly be in earnest. Please, please don't frighten me!  It's a hateful school.  I have always looked down upon it and detested it, and thanked goodness _I_ should never have to go to it!\"  Dreda's face was aflame with colour; her eyes had widened until they looked about twice their natural size, in her voice there sounded a quiver of so real a distress that the mother flushed painfully in response.  \"Dear! why be so prejudiced?  It may not be so fashionable a school as Madame Clerc's, but it is admirable in every way, and you will meet friends there whom you already know--the Websters...\"  \"Know them!  We don't!  We have met now and then, but we always determine not to know them.  We christened them `The Currant Buns,' and hated them from the first moment.  Round, white faces and little curranty eyes!\"  \"Dreda!  Dreda!  What has appearance to do with it?  You confess yourself that you are prejudiced, so you cannot possibly judge...  They are said to be clever and industrious, and exceptionally well brought up, but there will be other girls, plenty of other girls from whom to choose friends.\"  \"It is settled, then?  Really _settled_.  You have seen the mistress?\"  \"Yes, dear, it is settled.  You are to begin work at the beginning of the term.  The Websters are delighted to think of having you as a companion.\"  Dreda flung out her arms with a gesture of passionate despair, stood for a moment confronting her mother with flashing eyes and quivering lips, then suddenly wheeled round, and rushed headlong from the room.  Her first overwhelming impulse was to get out into the air.  The house suffocated her, and besides, she was going to do something ... something desperate ... and there was no scope indoors.  She thought of the lake, lying dull and grey within its reedy bank, and saw a vision of herself floating on the surface, with her unbound hair streaming round her face. In the Academy a year before she had been much attracted by a picture of the dead Elaine, and her own hair was exactly the same shade...  But it was wicked to commit suicide, and, miserable though she was, life held too many attractions to be lightly abandoned.  She would just run away into the darkness and the silence, with her sore, sore heart--to commune with nature, and face the future alone with her own soul!  Dreda sobbed aloud at the pathos of the thought, and, racing down the passage, threw open the side door leading into the garden.  A gust of wind blew into her face, a dash of cold sleety rain.  The sky was inky black, so black that it was impossible to distinguish even the outline of the trees: the air was soaking with moisture.  To one longing for darkness and loneliness, the prospect should have been all that could be desired; yet Dreda drew back shuddering, and shut the door with a hasty hand.  It was wet.  She hated to get wet, yet she could not take an umbrella.  When your heart was breaking, and you were face to face with one of the tragic moments of life, to walk abroad sheltered by an umbrella was too calm and commonplace a proceeding to be contemplated for a moment!  Dreda decided that on the whole it would be better to do her wrestling in her own room; but the noise of the opening and shutting of the door had attracted attention, and as she slowly retraced her steps the pantry door opened, and Martin the parlourmaid thrust her head inquiringly outward.  Martin was a pleasant middle-aged woman, an old retainer in the family, and the pantry at The Meads was quite a good-sized room, and a comfortable one at that, boasting a fireplace in which blazed the cheeriest of fires, for Martin was fond of comfort, and took a pride in keeping her domain spick and span.  Her face brightened as she saw the girl standing in the passage, for Dreda was a favourite with all the servants.  Miss Rowena, they agreed, was \"high;\" but Miss Dreda was \"feelin'.\"  \"Very feelin' was Miss Dreda!\"  She was always sorry for you, and wanted to help.  They bore her no grudge because the \"wanting\" frequently went no farther than words.  She was but young.  Young things did forget.  It was entered to her abiding credit that she was \"feelin'.\"  This afternoon one glimpse at the flushed, excited face was sufficient to show that the girl herself was in trouble, and Martin threw open the door to show the hospitable glow of the fire.  \"Miss Dreda!  Was that you standing by that door in the cold?  You'll be catching cold; that's what you'll be doing!  I'm having a snack of cocoa and buttered toast.  Come in and have a bite by the fire.\"  Dreda hesitated.  Buttered toast was incongruous--painfully incongruous; for among the other desperate resolutions which had rushed through her brain, a slow, determined starvation had held a foremost place.  She would turn with a sick distaste from the pleasures of the table; would eat only the plainest of viands, and of them barely enough to keep herself in life.  She would grow thin and hollow-eyed, and her parents, looking on, would repent their cruelty in sackcloth and ashes.  But--the buttered toast smelt wonderfully good!  \"I'll come"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21118"],["title","Etheldreda the Ready: A School Story (#5)"],["body"," and warm myself, but--I'm not hungry,\" said Dreda, hesitating.  But Martin did not appear to have heard.  As her young mistress seated herself by the fire, a stool was quietly placed by her side, and on the stool appeared, as if by magic, a plate of toast and a cup of cocoa.  Dreda's hand stretched out involuntarily; she ate and drank, and reflected that, after all, as her father had lost money so unexpectedly, it was only reasonable to suppose that he would recover it in a manner equally rapid.  She was sorry she had been cross.  She would never be cross any more.  In the recovered days of prosperity it would be so pleasant to remember how nobly she had borne herself in the hour of trial!    CHAPTER FIVE.  Meantime in the schoolroom upstairs another blow had fallen, and Rowena was quivering beneath the shock of discovering that in Miss Bruce's absence it was she and not Etheldreda who was expected to carry on Maud's education.  \"I am sure you will be a conscientious teacher, dear; and I hope that the regular occupation, and the consciousness that you are being of real use will make life brighter for you.  Maud will promise to be an industrious pupil, won't you, darling?\"  Maud eyed Rowena's tragic countenance, and felt it wise to refrain from rash protestations.  She was longing to rush after Dreda to declaim against this last injustice, and as her mother continued to address herself pointedly to Rowena, taking no more notice of her own important presence, she slipped softly from the room.  The two who were left, felt, the one a throb of relief, the other a chill of acute discomfort, at finding themselves alone.  The tie between this mother and her eldest daughter was a very tender one, and in the shock of the recent losses Mrs Saxon had unconsciously built much on Rowena's sympathy and love.  Rowena would help.  Rowena would sympathise; Rowena--herself a woman--would understand some things which even the good husband could not grasp.  In the happy, easy days of prosperity, Rowena could always be relied on to be loving, dutiful, and considerate--it was a shock to discover that these good qualities had not enough foundation to withstand the test of adversity.  Mrs Saxon was not angry; only distressed and troubled afresh, and overwhelmingly anxious to find the right way to her daughter's heart.  \"Mother!\" cried Rowena sharply.  \"_How_ did father lose his money?  It seems so strange that it should disappear all of a sudden like this.  We have always had plenty until now.  Has he been speculating, or doing something rash?\"  The momentary pause before Mrs Saxon replied and the dignified lifting of her gentle head were more eloquent than a spoken reproof.  \"No, Rowena; there is no blame attaching to your father.  There has been a great failure in America, which has affected many of his investments. We cannot reproach ourselves for any want of care, and that being so, we must look upon this change of circumstances as coming to us from God's hands, and try to learn the lessons which it is intended to teach.  To each of us, perhaps, our own task appears especially hard.  You, darling, have looked forward to a time of pleasure and gaiety, and it is difficult to give it up cheerfully, and face living quietly in the country and helping in the house.  I understand; I've been a girl myself, and I remember how I felt; but, darling, I am a woman now-- getting quite an old woman--and I have learnt my lessons.  There is more real joy and contentment to be gained by simply doing one's duty than in all the balls and receptions of a London season, Rowena!\"  Rowena sat dumb, her eyes fixed on the tablecloth, her long dark lashes resting on her cheeks.  Those were the sentiments you read in books, and heard in sermons, but it was always grown-up people who voiced them; grown-up people who, like mother, had had a good time in their own youth, and were afterwards unreasonable enough to expect their children to be resigned and middle-aged when they had just emerged from the schoolroom.  Rowena thought of the prospect which had stretched dazzlingly before her but a week before; of the gaiety and variety of amusement which had made so fair a dream, and contrasted it with the prospect of an uneventful domestic life at the Manor--teaching Maud! She pressed her lips together, and sat silent, feeling her mother's eyes on her face; dreading to meet their tenderly reproaching gaze.  \"That sounds strange to you, dear, and perhaps a little hard, but all the same it is _true_.  I do not minimise your disappointment, but for the time being it is inevitable, and nothing remains but to face the situation bravely.  As the eldest daughter of the house more depends upon you than upon any of the rest, and your opportunities will be endless.  You can be a great comfort to us, darling, or a great additional care.  It all depends upon the spirit in which you start the new life--upon whether you look in or out--put yourself first, or think of others.\"  Mrs Saxon paused again, and within Rowena's still form two contending forces fought for victory.  While one sullen spirit held her dumb, the real self seemed to stand apart, reviewing her own conduct, and uttering words of exhortation and appeal: \"How hateful of you never to say a word in reply!  Poor mother! her voice trembled...  It's hard on her, too. If you could just put your arms round her neck and kiss her, and promise to be good, it would comfort her ever so much.  And you'd be happier yourself.  It only makes you more miserable to sulk, and be unkind. Look up and smile, and promise to be nice.\"  So urged the inner voice, but alas, the fleshy eyelids seemed heavy as lead, and the lips remained stiff and unmoveable.  To all outward appearance there was no sign of softening in the fixed face.  Mrs Saxon's heart sank heavily.  Rowena's lack of response to her appeal was a bitter disappointment; but she realised that it was useless to prolong the interview.  A few moments longer she waited, hoping against hope for a word in reply, then stifling a sigh, she rose from her seat.  \"Well--I must go back to father.  Look after the fire, darling, if you are going to stay here.  It is getting low, and you must not catch cold.\"  She bent as she passed to kiss the unresponsive lips, and walked from the room carrying a heavy heart in her breast.  \"If she had only spoken! If she had even looked up and smiled!\"  Such was the wounded mother cry; and all the time Rowena's heart was speeding unspoken messages after her as she went.  \"Mother!  I'm sorry.  You are so sweet, and I am a wretch!  I _will_ try!  I'll try my best!\"  Alas! the ears of sense could not catch the message, and so the opportunity passed, and left both hearts aching and oppressed.    CHAPTER SIX.  \"What's `rejuiced'?\" queried Maud, squeezing herself into the central place on the big fender, as her brothers and sisters sat roasting chestnuts by the schoolroom fire one wet afternoon a few days later, and the question being received by a blank stare of bewilderment she repeated the word with intensified emphasis.  \"_Re-juiced_!  _We're_ rejuiced!  I heard Mary say so in the schoolroom.  She said to nurse that she didn't know if the missis would be wanting to keep on two housemaids now she was re-juiced!  Does it mean _poor_?\"  \"You have no business to listen to servants' conversation; but if you do, pray spare us the repetition!\" said Rowena in her most grown-up manner.  Maud reflected that ever since mother had spoken of the new arrangement about lessons, Ro had talked exactly like a governess, and been just as snappy as snappy.  She bounced on her seat, and wagged her head in the obstinate manner which she adopted upon provocation.  \"I don't listen, but I have ears, and if people speak I am obliged to hear.  Mary came into the room to dust.  Nurse was darning the tablecloth.  It's all gone into holes where Gurth spilt the chemical acid.  It's the one with the little shamrocks for a pattern.  So Nurse said: `Drat those boys!' and licked the cotton with her tongue, and--\"  Hereward and Gurth exchanged glances of resigned boredom, but Dreda drummed her heels on the floor, and called aloud with startling emphasis:  \"Go on!  Go on!  Who wants to hear about tablecloth patterns, and licking threads?  Keep to your point, if you have a point to stick to! If Rowena's is going to give you lessons, she'd better begin by teaching you not to be such a bore.  You go prosing on and on--\"  \"I don't.  I'm not.  Bore yourself!  'Twas most intrusting!\" insisted Maud, stolidly.  \"They were sort of talking about us all, in a sort of way as if I couldn't understand, and I understood all the time, and they said we were rejuiced, and I asked you a simple question what it meant. When you're perlite to other people, other people should be perlite to you in return.\"  \"All right, Maud, keep calm, keep calm!  You reduce a thing by taking something from it.  We are reduced because something--a great deal--has been taken away from our income, and what remains is not enough to go round.  I expect the second housemaid will be sent packing, and you will have to make the beds.\"  Maud squealed with dismay, then with a gleam of shrewdness nodded her head, and prophesied sagely:  \"It would be worse for you than me if I did!  I'd make them full of crumples.  I'd get hold of the ends of the clothes, and _Hop_ them down all together like Mary does when it's her Sunday out, and she's in a hurry.  _Then_ you'd be in a rage when you got in and your toes stuck out!\"  \"I'll make the beds!\" announced Dreda, graciously.  \"I think all girls ought to learn to be domestic, and there's a real art in making beds. I've often thought how much better I could do it than any servant we have had.  It's the trained intellect, I suppose.  (I do _hate_ you, Rowena, when you sneer like that!)  F'rinstance--I like my blankets just up to my chin, and if I tell Mary ten times a day, it's always the same--she"]]]
