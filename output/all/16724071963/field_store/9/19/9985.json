Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one       who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glasses, and       especially of large ones. Regarded apart from its reflection, the mirror       presents a continuous, flat, colourless, unrelieved surface,—a thing       always and obviously unpleasant. Considered as a reflector, it is potent       in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity: and the evil is here       aggravated, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its       sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. In fact, a room with four       or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show,       a room of no shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter       upon glitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing       effects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,       would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be       altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let the       same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be       startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.            It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a man       of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it. The       corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture.       As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is, therefore, not among _our       _aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in Appallachia), for the       spirituality of a British _boudoir. _But we have seen apartments in       the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly “modest” or “moderate”]       means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with any of the _or-molu’d       _cabinets of our friends across the water. Even _now_, there is       present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious chamber with whose       decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor lies asleep on a sofa—the       weather is cool—the time is near midnight: we will make a sketch of       the room during his slumber.            It is oblong—some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth—a       shape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of       furniture. It has but one door—by no means a wide one—which is       at one end of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the       other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor—have deep       recesses—and open on an Italian _veranda. _Their panes are of a       crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual.       They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to       the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. Without the       recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a       deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material       of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but the folds of the whole       fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance),       issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles       the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The drapery is thrown       open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping       it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such       devices are apparent. The colours of the curtains and their fringe—the       tints of crimson and gold—appear everywhere in profusion, and       determine the _character _of the room. The carpet—of Saxony       material—is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson       ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that       festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the _ground,       _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short       irregular curves—one occasionally overlaying the other. The walls       are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint, spotted with small       Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many       paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly landscapes of an       imaginative cast—such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield, or the       lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There are, nevertheless, three or       four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully.       The tone of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no “brilliant       effects.” _Repose _speaks in all. Not one is of small size.       Diminutive paintings give that _spotty _look to a room, which is the       blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched. The frames are broad       but not deep, and richly carved, without being _dulled _or filagreed.       They have the whole lustre of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls,       and do not hang off with cords. The designs themselves are often seen to       better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of       the chamber is injured. But one mirror—and this not a very large one—is       visible. In shape it is nearly circular—and it is hung so that a       reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary       sitting-places of the room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson       silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light       conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood,       also), without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed       altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the       sofas. This is also without cover—the drapery of the curtains has       been thought sufficient.. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which       bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded       angles of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with       highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some       light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk       cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound       books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an Argand       lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from       He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a       tranquil but magical radiance over all.      A TALE OF JERUSALEM        Intensos rigidam in frontem ascendere canos      Passus erat——                     —Lucan—_De Catone_       ——a bristly _bore_.                     _Translation._             “Let us hurry to the walls,” said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and Simeon       the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the year of the       world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one—“let us hasten to the       ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in the city of David,       and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the last hour of       the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in fulfilment of the       promise of Pompey, should be awaiting us with the lambs for the       sacrifices.”                  Simeon, Abel-Phittim, and Duzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim, or       sub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of Jerusalem.            “Verily,” replied the Pharisee; “let us hasten: for this generosity in the       heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an attribute of       the worshippers of Baal.”                  “That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the       Pentateuch,” said Buzi-Ben-Levi, “but that is only toward the people of       Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their       own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us       lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver       shekels per head!”                  “Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the       Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,       has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar,       to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”                  “Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who belonged       to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints whose manner of       _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a       thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees—a stumbling-block to less       gifted perambulators)—“by the five corners of that beard which, as a       priest, I am forbidden to shave!—have we lived to see the day when a       blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of       appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated       elements? Have we lived to see the day when—”            “Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted       Abel-Phittim, “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or       by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest offerings       should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not       extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside.”                  That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and which       bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most strongly       fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep and lofty       hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench, hewn from the       solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its       inner edge."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2151"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 5 (#2)"],["body","wall was adorned, at regular interspaces, by square       towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the highest one hundred and       twenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin, the       wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse. On the contrary,       between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a       perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits, forming part of the       precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when Simeon and his associates arrived       on the summit of the tower called Adoni-Bezek—the loftiest of all the       turrets around about Jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the       besieging army—they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an       eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by       several, that of the temple of Belus.            “Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,       “the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore—as the locusts in the       wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of Adommin.”                  “And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine—no,       not one—from Aleph to Tau—from the wilderness to the battlements—who       seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”                  “Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a Roman       soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the regions       of Pluto—“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has       broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince your       gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has thought       fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phœbus, who is a       true god, has been charioted for an hour—and were you not to be on the       ramparts by sunrise? Ædepol! do you think that we, the conquerors of the       world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every       kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower away! I say—and       see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight!”                  “El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the       centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away against       the temple—“El Elohim!—who is the god Phœbus?—whom doth       the blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of       the Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the Teraphim!—is       it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?—or Ashimah?—or       Nibhaz,—or Tartak?—or Adramalech?—or Anamalech?—or       Succoth-Benith?—or Dagon?—or Belial?—or Baal-Perith?—or       Baal-Peor?—or Baal-Zebub?”                  “Verily it is neither—but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too       rapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang on       the projection of yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of the       holy things of the sanctuary.”                  By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily laden       basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and, from the       giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly round it; but       owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of       their operations could be obtained.            Half an hour had already elapsed.            “We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of this       period he looked over into the abyss—“we shall be too late! we shall be       turned out of office by the Katholim.”                  “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim—“no more shall we feast upon the       fat of the land—no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense—our       loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”                  “Raca!” swore Ben-Levi, “Raca! do they mean to defraud us of the purchase       money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle?”                  “They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee—“they       have given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!—and thou,       Buzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!—for verily the Philistines have either       still hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to       place therein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while       their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.                   “Booshoh he!”—as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the       extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible—“Booshoh he!” was       the exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.            “Booshoh he!—for shame!—it is a ram from the thickets of       Engedi, and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat!”                  “It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the       bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes are       more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is like the       honey of Hebron.”                  “It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee, “the       heathen have dealt wonderfully with us——let us raise up our       voices in a psalm—let us give thanks on the shawm and on the       psaltery—on the harp and on the huggab—on the cythern and on the sackbut!”                  It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the Gizbarim       that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a _hog_ of no common size.            “Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,       letting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the       Philistines, “El Emanu!—God be with us—it is _the unutterable       flesh!”_     THE SPHINX         During the dread reign of the cholera in New York, I had accepted the       invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement       of his _cottage ornée_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around       us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in       the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we       should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful       intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city. Not a       day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some       acquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily       the loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every       messenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.       That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I could       neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was of a less       excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted       himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical intellect was not at       any time affected by unrealities. To the substances of terror he was       sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension.            His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which       I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which       I had found in his library. These were of a character to force into       germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my       bosom. I had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he       was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been       made upon my fancy.            A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens—a belief       which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed to       defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions—he       maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,—I       contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute       spontaneity—that is to say, without apparent traces of       suggestion—had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and       was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the       idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.            The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred       to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so       much of the portentous character, that I might well have been excused for       regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time so confounded       and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind       to communicate the circumstances to my friend.            Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at an       open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view       of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded       by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees. My       thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom       and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes from the page,       they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object—upon       some living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its       way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense       forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I doubted my own       sanity—or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes       passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor       in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which I distinctly saw, and       calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, I       fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than       even I did myself.
