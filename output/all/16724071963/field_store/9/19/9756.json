[Note 1.]  To him and Murtagh, the presence of this strange cetaceous animal gave no relief; and, after hearing its call, they sank back to their seats, relapsing into the state of half despondency, half hopefulness, from which it had startled them.  Not so with Saloo, who better understood its habits.  He knew they were amphibious, and that, where the dugong was found, land could not be a long way off.  He said this, once more arousing his companions by his words to renewed expectancy.  The morning soon after broke, and they beheld boldly outlined against the fast-clearing sky the blue mountains of Borneo.  \"Land!\" was the cry that came simultaneously from their lips.  \"Land--thank the Lord!\" continued the American skipper, in a tone of pious gratitude; and as his pinnace, still obedient to the breeze and spread tarpaulin, forged on toward it, he once more knelt down in the bottom of the boat, caused his children to do the same, and offered up a prayer--a fervent thanksgiving to the God alike of land and sea, who was about to deliver him and his from the \"dangers of the deep.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.  We are unwilling to interrupt the course of our narrative by disquisitions on subjects of natural history, and, therefore, relegate to a note the following particulars about the dugong.  This strange mammal belongs to a genus of the family _Manatidae_, or Herbivorous Cetacea.  The species of which a member was discovered by our castaways, is the _Halicore Indicus_, or dugong of the Indian Archipelago; and, as we have said, is never found very far from land.  Its dentition resembles, in some respects, that of the elephant; and from the structure of its digestible organs it can eat only vegetable food; that is, the _algae_, or weeds, growing on submarine rocks in shallow water. When it comes to the surface to breathe, it utters a peculiar cry, like the lowing of a cow.  Its length, when full-grown, is said to be twenty feet, but few individuals seem to exceed twelve feet.  In its general appearance it is very much like the _manatee_, or manatus, which haunts the mouths of the great South American rivers.    CHAPTER FIVE.  RUNNING THE BREAKERS.  The Almighty Hand that had thus far helped the castaways on their course, with a favouring wind bringing them in sight of Borneo's isle, was not going to crush the sweet hopes thus raised by wrecking their boat upon its shores.  And yet for a time it seemed as if this were to be their fate.  As they drew near enough to the land to distinguish its configuration, they saw a white line like a snow-wreath running between it and them, for miles to right and left, far as the eye could reach.  They knew it to be a barrier of coral breakers, such as usually encircle the islands of the Indian seas--strong ramparts raised by tiny insect creatures, to guard these fair gardens of God against the assaults of an ocean that, although customarily calm, is at times aroused by the _typhoon_, until it rages around them with dark scowling waves, like battalions of demons.  On drawing near these reefs, Captain Redwood, with the eye of an experienced seaman, saw that while the wind kept up there was no chance for the pinnace to pass them; and to run head on to them would be simply to dash upon destruction.  Sail was at once taken in, by letting go the sheet, and dropping the tarpaulin back into the bottom of the boat.  The oar that had been set up as a mast was left standing, for there were five others lying idle in the pinnace; and with four of these, Saloo and Murtagh each taking a pair, the boat was manned, the captain himself keeping charge of the tiller.  His object was not to approach the land, but to prevent being carried among the breakers, which, surging up snow-white, presented a perilous barrier to their advance.  To keep the boat from driving on the dangerous reef, was just as much as the oarsmen could accomplish.  Weakened as they were, by long suffering and starvation, they had a tough struggle to hold the pinnace as it were in _statu quo_--all the tougher from the disproportion between such a heavy craft and the light oar-stroke of which her reduced and exhausted crew were capable.  But as if taking pity upon them, and in sympathy with their efforts, the sun, as he rose above the horizon, seemed to smile upon them and hush the storm into silence.  The wind, that throughout the night had been whistling in their ears, all at once fell to a calm, as if commanded by the majestic orb of day; and along with the wind went down the waves, the latter subsiding more gradually.  It was easier now to hold the pinnace in place, as also to row her in a direction parallel to the line of the breakers; and, after coasting for about a mile, an opening was at length observed where the dangerous reef might perhaps be penetrated with safety.  Setting the boat's head toward it, the oars were once more worked with the utmost strength that remained in the arms of the rowers, while her course was directed with all the skill of which an American skipper is capable.  Yet the attempt was one of exceeding peril.  Though the wind had subsided, the swell was tremendous; billow after billow being carried against the coral reefs with a violence known only to the earthquake and the angry ocean.  Vast volumes of water surged high on either side, projecting still higher their sparkling shafts of spray, like the pillars of a waterspout.  Between them spread a narrow space of calm sea--yet only comparatively calm, for even there an ordinary boat, well managed, would be in danger of getting swamped.  What then was the chance for a huge pinnace, poorly manned, and therefore sure of being badly trimmed?  It looked as if after all the advantages that had arisen--that had sprung up as though providentially in their favour--Captain Redwood and the small surviving remnant of his crew were to perish among the breakers of Borneo, and be devoured by the ravenous sharks which amidst the storm-vexed reefs find their congenial home.  But it was not so to be.  The prayer offered up, as those snow-white but treacherous perils first hove in sight, had been heard on high; and He who had guided the castaways to the danger, stayed by their side, and gave strength to their arms to carry them through it.  With a skill drawn from the combination of clear intelligence and long experience, Captain Redwood set the head of his pinnace straight for the narrow and dangerous passage; and with a strength inspired by the peril, Murtagh and the Malay pulled upon their oars, each handling his respective pair as if his life depended on the effort.  With the united will of oarsmen and steerer the effort was successful; and ten seconds later the pinnace was safe inside the breakers, moving along under the impulse of two pairs of oars, that rose and fell as gently as if they were pulling her over the surface of some placid lake.  In less than ten minutes her keel touched bottom on the sands of Borneo, and her crew, staggering ashore, dropped upon their knees, and in words earnest as those uttered by Columbus at Cat Island, or the Pilgrims on Plymouth Rock, breathed a devout thanksgiving for their deliverance.    CHAPTER SIX.  A GIGANTIC OYSTER.  \"Water! water!\"  The pain of hunger is among the hardest to endure, though there is still a harder--that of thirst.  In the first hours of either, it is doubtful which of the two kinds of suffering is the more severe; but, prolonged beyond a certain point, hunger loses its keenness of edge, through the sheer weakness of the sufferer, while the agony of thirst knows no such relief.  Suffering, as our castaways were, from want of food for nearly a week, their thirst was yet more agonising; and after the thanksgiving prayer had passed from their lips, their first thought was of water--their cry, \"Water! water!\"  As they arose to their feet they instinctively looked around to see if any brook or spring were near.  An ocean was flowing beside them; but this was not the kind of water wanted.  They had already had enough of the briny element, and did not even turn their eyes upon it.  It was landward they looked; scanning the edge of the forest, that came down within a hundred yards of the shore-- the strip of sand on which they had beached their boat trending along between the woods and the tide-water as far as the eye could trace it. A short distance off, however, a break was discernible in the line of the sand-strip--which they supposed must be either a little inlet of the sea itself, or the outflow of a stream.  If the latter, then were they fortunate indeed.  Saloo, the most active of the party, hastened toward it; the others following him only with their eyes.  They watched him with eager gaze, trembling between hope and fear-- Captain Redwood more apprehensive than the rest.  He knew that in this part of the Bornean coast months often pass without a single shower of rain; and if no stream or spring should be found they would still be in danger of perishing by thirst.  They saw Saloo bend by the edge of the inlet, scoop up some water in his palms, and apply it to his lips, as if tasting it.  Only for an instant, when back to them came the joyful cry,--  \"_Ayer! ayer manis! sungi_!\"  (Water! sweet water!  A river!)  Scarce more pleasantly, that morning at day-break, had fallen on their ears the cry of \"Land!\" than now fell the announcement of the Malay sailor, making known the proximity of water.  Captain Redwood, who was acquainted with the Malay language, translated the welcome words.  Sweet water, Saloo had described it.  Emphatically might it be so termed.  All hastened, or rather rushed, toward the stream, fell prostrate on their faces by its edge, and drank to a surfeit.  It gave them new life; and, indeed, it had given them their lives already, though they knew it not.  It was the outflow"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21238"],["title","The Castaways (#4)"],["body"," its current into the ocean that caused the break in the coral reef through which their boat had been enabled to pass.  Otherwise they might have found no opening, and perished in attempting to traverse the surging surf.  The madrepores will not build their subaqueous coral walls where rivers run into the ocean; hence the open spaces here and there happily left, that form deep transverse channels admitting the largest ships.  No longer suffering from thirst, its kindred appetite now returned with undivided agony, and the next thought was for something to eat.  They again turned their eyes toward the forest, and up the bank of the stream that came flowing from it.  But Saloo had seen something in the sea, near the spot where the pinnace had been left; and, calling upon Murtagh to get ready some dry wood and kindle a fire, he ran back toward the boat.  Murtagh, the rest accompanying him, walked to the edge of the woods where the stream issued from the leafy wilderness.  Just beyond the strip of sand the forest abruptly ended, the trees standing thick together, and rising like a vast vegetable wall to a height of over a hundred feet.  Only a few straggled beyond this line. The very first of them, that nearest the sea, was a large elm-like tree, with tall trunk, and spreading leafy limbs that formed a screen from the sun, now well up in the sky, and every moment growing more sultry.  It offered a convenient camping-place; and under its cool shadow they could recline until with restored strength they might either seek or build themselves a better habitation.  An ample store of dry faggots was lying near; and Murtagh having collected them into a pile, took out his flint and steel, and commenced striking a light.  Meanwhile their eyes were almost constantly turned toward Saloo, all of them wondering what had taken him back to the boat.  Their wonder was not diminished when they saw him pass the place where the pinnace had been pulled up on the sand, and wade straight out into the water--as if he were going back to the breakers!  Presently, after he had got about knee-deep, they saw him stoop down, until his body was nearly buried under the sea, and commence what appeared to be a struggle with some creature still concealed from their observation.  Nor was their wonder any the less, when at length he rose erect again, holding in his hands what for all the world looked like a huge rock, to which a number of small shells and some sea-weed adhered.  \"What does the Malay crather want wid a big stone?\" was the interrogatory of the astonished Irishman.  \"And, look, captin, it's that same he's about bringin' us.  I thought it moight be some kind of shill-fish.  Hungry as we are, we can't ate stones?\"  \"Not so fast, Murtagh,\" said the captain, who had more carefully scrutinised the article Saloo had taken up.  \"It's not a stone, but what you first supposed it--a shell-fish.\"  \"That big thing a shill-fish!  Arrah now, captin, aren't you jokin'?\"  \"No, indeed.  What Saloo has got in his arms, if I'm not mistaken, is an oyster.\"  \"An oysther?  Two fut in length and over one in breadth.  Why, it's as much as the Malay can carry.  Don't yez see that he's staggerin' under it?\"  \"Very true; but it's an oyster for all that.  I'm now sure of it, as I can see its shape, and the great ribs running over it.  Make haste, and get your fire kindled; for it's a sort of oyster rather too strong-flavoured to be eaten raw.  Saloo evidently intends it to be roasted.\"  Murtagh did as requested, and by the time the Malay, bearing his heavy burden, reached the tree, smoke was oozing through a stack of faggots that were soon after ablaze.  \"Tha, Cappen Ledwad,\" said the Malay, flinging his load at the captain's feet.  \"Tha plenty shell-fiss--makee all we big blakfass.  Inside find good meat.  We no need open him.  Hot coalee do that.\"  They all gathered around the huge shell, surveying it with curiosity, more especially the young people.  It was that strange testaceous fish found in the Indian seas, and known to sailors as the \"Singapore oyster\"--of which specimens are not rare measuring a yard in length, and over eighteen inches in breadth at the widest diameter.  Their curiosity, however, was soon satisfied; for with stomachs craving as theirs, they were in no very fit condition for the pursuit of conchological studies; and Saloo once more lifting the large oyster-- just as much as he could do--dropped it among the faggots, now fairly kindled into a fire.  More were heaped around and over it, until it was buried in the heart of a huge pile, the sea-weeds that still clung to it crackling, and the salt water spurting and spitting, as the smoke, mingled with the bright blaze, ascended toward the overshadowing branches of the tree.  In due time Saloo, who had cooked Singapore oysters before, pronounced it sufficiently roasted; when the faggots were kicked aside, and with a boat-hook, which Murtagh had brought from the pinnace, the oyster [Note 1.] was dragged out of the ashes.  Almost instantly it fell open, its huge valves displaying in their concave cups enough \"oyster-meat\" to have afforded a supper for a party of fifteen individuals instead of five--that is, fifteen not so famished as they were.  With some knives and other utensils, which the Irishman had also brought away from the boat, they seated themselves around the grand bivalve; nor did they arise from their seats until the shells were scraped clean, and hunger, that had so long tortured them, was quite banished from their thoughts.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.  Strictly speaking, the Singapore oyster is a gigantic species of Clam, (_Tridacna_).    CHAPTER SEVEN.  A DANGEROUS LOCALITY.  After their ample meal of oyster \"roasted in the shell,\" which was a breakfast instead of a supper, they rested for the remainder of the day, and all through the following night.  They required this lengthened period of repose, not because they stood in need of sleep, but from the exhaustion of weakness, consequent upon their long spell of hunger and thirst.  They slept well, considering that they had no couch, nor any covering, but the tattered clothes they wore upon their bodies.  But they had become accustomed to this kind of bed; as to one even less comfortable, and certainly not safer--on the hard planks of the pinnace.  Nor did the cold discomfort them; for although the nights are colder on land than at sea, and in the tropics sometimes even chilly, that night was warm throughout; and nothing interfered with their slumbers except some horrid dreams, the sure sequence of suffering and perils such as they had been passing through.  The morning rose bright and beautiful, as nearly all Bornean mornings do.  And the castaways rose from their recumbent position, feeling wonderfully restored both in strength and spirits.  Henry and Helen-- these were the names of the young people--were even cheerful, inclined to wander about and wonder at the strange objects around: the beautiful beach of silvery sand; the deep blue sea; the white breakers beyond, rising over it like along snow-wreath; the clear fresh-water stream alongside, in which they could see curious fish disporting themselves; the grand forest-trees, among them stately palms and tall lance-like bamboos;--in short, a thousand things that make tropical scenery so charming.  Notwithstanding the scenic beauty, there was something needed before it could be thoroughly enjoyed, and this was breakfast.  The contents of the great oyster had given full satisfaction for the time; but that was nearly twenty-four hours ago, and the appetites of all were once more keenly whetted.  What was to take the edge off them?  This was the question that occupied their thoughts, and the answer was not so easy.  Saloo went in search of another Singapore oyster; Murtagh started along the bank of the stream, in the hope of beguiling some of the red and gold fish he saw playing \"backgammon\" in it, as he had seen the trout and salmon in his native Killarney; while the captain, having procured a rifle, that had been brought away in the boat, and which he well knew how to handle, wandered off into the woods.  Henry and Helen remained under the tree, as their father did not think there could be any danger in leaving them alone.  He was well enough acquainted with the natural history of Borneo to know that there were neither lions nor tigers in the island.  Had it been on the neighbouring island of Sumatra, or some desert coast of the mainland--in Malacca, Cochin-China, or Hindustan--he might have dreaded exposing them to the attack of tigers.  But as there was no danger of encountering these fierce creatures on the shores of Borneo, he told the children to stay under the tree until he and the others should return.  The young people were by this time rather tired of remaining in a recumbent position.  It was that to which they had been too long constrained while in the boat, and it felt irksome; moreover, the oyster, wonderfully restoring their strength, had brought back their wonted juvenile vigour, so that they felt inclined for moving about a bit.  For a time they indulged this inclination by walking to and fro around the trunk of the tree.  Soon, however, weariness once more came upon them, and they desired to have a seat.  Squatting upon the ground is an attitude only easy to savages, and always irksome to those accustomed to habits of civilised life, and to sitting upon chairs.  They looked about for something upon which they might sit but nothing appeared suitable.  There were neither logs nor large stones; for the beach, as well as the adjacent shore, was composed of fine drift sand, and no trees seemed to have fallen near the spot.  \"I have it!\" exclaimed Henry, after puzzling his brains a bit, his eye guiding him to a settlement of the difficulty.  \"The shells--the big oyster shells--the very things for us to sit upon,"]]]
