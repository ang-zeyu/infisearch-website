If you knew how for the last thirty years this has preyed upon my mind, you would comprehend my anxiety on this account; but God's will be done.  Do not let me detain you longer, Alexander; I should prefer being alone.\"  Alexander, at this intimation, took the proffered hand of his grand-uncle in a reverential and feeling manner, and, without saying any more, quitted the room.    CHAPTER TWO.  The conversation which he had had with his grand-uncle made a very forcible impression upon Alexander Wilmot; it occasioned him to pass a very sleepless night, and he remained till nearly four o'clock turning it over in his mind.  The loss of the _Grosvenor_ Indiaman had occurred long before he was born; he was acquainted with the outline of what had taken place, and had been told, when a child, that a relation of his family had perished; but although the narrative had, at the time, made some impression upon his young mind, he had seldom, if ever, heard it spoken of since, and may have been said to have almost forgotten it.  He was therefore not a little surprised when he found how great an influence it had upon his grand-uncle, who had never mentioned it to him before; indeed it had escaped Alexander's memory that it was his grand-uncle's only surviving daughter who had been lost in the vessel.  Alexander Wilmot was warmly attached to the old gentleman; indeed, he would have been very ungrateful if he had not been, for it was impossible that any one could have been treated with more kindness and liberality than he was by Sir Charles.  It was but the week before, that he had expressed a wish to travel on the continent, and Sir Charles had immediately given his consent that he should remain abroad, if he pleased, for two years.  When he approved, however, of Alexander's plans, he had made a remark as to his own age and infirmity, and the probable chance that they might not meet again in this world; and this remark of his grand-uncle left such an impression upon Alexander, that he almost repented having made the request, and had been ever since in a state of indecision as to whether he should avail himself of his grand-uncle's kindness and disregard of self, shown towards him in thus having granted his permission.  The conversation with Sir Charles had brought up a new idea in his mind; he had witnessed the anxiety and longing which his good old relation had shown about the fate of his daughter; he had heard from his own lips how long the ignorance of her fate had preyed upon his mind, and that to be satisfied on this point was the one thing wanting to enable the old man to die happy,--to permit him to say with sincerity, \"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.\"  Why, then, should he not go to discover the truth?  It would not, perhaps, occupy him so long as the two years of travelling on the continent, which had been consented to by his grand-uncle, and, instead of travelling for his own pleasure, he might be the means of satisfying the mind and quieting the anxiety of one who had been so kind to him.  Indeed, he should actually prefer a journey into the interior of Africa to a mere sojourn of some time on the continent; the very peril and danger, the anticipation of distress and hardship, were pleasing to his high and courageous mind, and before he fell asleep Alexander had made up his mind that he would propose the expedition, and if he could obtain his uncle's permission would proceed upon it forthwith.  Having come to this resolution, he fell fast asleep and dreamed away, till eight o'clock in the morning, that he was hunting elephants and having hand-to-hand conflicts with every variety of beast with which he had peopled Africa in his fancy.  When he was called up in the morning, he found his determination of the night before rather strengthened than otherwise, and accordingly, after breakfast was over, he opened the subject.  \"My dear sir,\" said he to Sir Charles, \"you were kind enough to give me your permission to travel on the continent for two years.\"  \"I did do so, Alexander; it is natural at your age that you should wish to see the world, and you have my full permission.  When do you think of starting?\"  \"That depends upon circumstances, sir, and I must be altogether guided by you; to tell you the truth, I do not think that one sees much of the world by following in the beaten track made by so many of our countrymen.\"  \"There I agree with you; in the present high state of civilisation there will be found little or no difference in the manners and customs of people; in the courts, none; very little in the best society, in which you will of course mix; and not so very much as people may imagine among the mass of population; but the scenery of the countries and the remains of ancient times are still interesting, and will afford pleasure; it must be your own reflections and comments upon what you see which must make it profitable; most people, however, travel from the love of change, added to the love of excitement.\"  \"I grant it, sir, and I do not mean to say but that I should receive much pleasure from a continental tour; perhaps I may add that I should derive more profit if I were to delay it till I am a little older and a little wiser; do you not think so?\"  \"I certainly do, Alexander.  What then? do you propose remaining in England for the present?--if so, I am sure it is on my account, and I am very grateful to you for your sacrifice.\"  \"If you wish it, sir, I will undoubtedly remain in England; at all events, if I do not go elsewhere.  I have abandoned my continental tour for the present; but I have another proposal to make, which I hope will meet with your approbation.\"  \"Why, my dear Alexander, on what expedition would you now proceed?  Do you wish to visit the United States or South America?\"  \"No, sir; I wish to make a voyage of still more interest--I wish to go to Africa,--that is, to embark for the Cape of Good Hope, and from thence proceed to the northward, to ascertain, if possible, what now is a source of sad disquiet to you, the actual fate of those who were wrecked in the _Grosvenor_, and have not since been heard of with any degree of certainty.\"  Sir Charles was for a time silent.  He pressed his hands to his forehead; at last he removed them, and said,--\"I cannot, much as I wish it, no,--I cannot consent, my dear boy; the danger will be too great. You must not risk your life.  It is very kind of you--very kind; but no, it must not be.\"  \"Indeed, sir, I think, on reflection, you will alter your mind.  As for danger--what danger can there be when missionaries are permitted to form their stations, and reside uninjured among the very savages who were so hostile when the _Grosvenor_ was lost?  The country, which was then a desert, is now inhabited by Europeans, within 200 miles of the very spot where the _Grosvenor_ was wrecked.  The continual emigration since the Cape has fallen under British government, and the zeal of those who have braved all dangers to make known the Word of God to the heathen and idolater, have in forty years made such an alteration, that I see no more danger in the mission which I propose than I do in a visit to Naples; and as for time, I have every reason to expect that I shall be back sooner than in the two years which you have proposed for my stay on the continent.\"  \"But if some accident were to happen to you, I should never forgive myself for having given my consent, and the few days that are left to me would be rendered miserable.\"  \"My dear sir, we are in the hands of God; and (short-sighted as we are) in running away from danger, as often run into it.  What we call an accident, the fall of a brick or a stone, the upsetting of a vehicle, anything however trivial or seemingly improbable, may summon us away when we least expect it: `In the midst of life we are in death,' and that death I may meet by staying in this country, which I might have avoided by going on this expedition.  Difficulties may arise, and some danger there may be, I admit; but when prepared to encounter both, we are more safe than when, in fancied security, we are taken unawares.  Do not, I entreat you, sir, refuse me this favour; I have considered well, and shall be most unhappy if I am not permitted to obtain the information for you which you have so much at heart.  Let my travels be of some advantage to you as well as to myself.  Do not refuse, I entreat you.\"  \"You are a good boy, Alexander, and your kindness makes me still more unwilling to part with you.  I hardly know what to say.  Let us drop the subject for the present; we will talk of it to-morrow or next day.  I must have time for reflection.\"  Alexander Wilmot did not fail to renew his entreaties on the following day, but could not gain Sir Charles's consent.  He was not, however, discouraged.  He had taken from the library all the works he could find relative to Southern Africa, and continually enforcing his arguments by quotations from various authors, all tending to prove that he might travel through the country without much risk, if he took proper precautions, his grand-uncle's objections grew daily more feeble, and at last Sir Charles gave his unwilling consent.  In the mean time, the books which Alexander had read had produced a great effect upon him. When he first proposed the mission, it was more from a feeling of gratitude towards his old relative than any other, but now he was most anxious to go on his own account.  The narratives of combats with wild beasts, the quantity and variety of game to be found, and the continual excitement which would be kept up, inflamed his imagination and his love of field-sports, and he earnestly requested to be permitted to depart immediately, pointing out to Sir Charles that the sooner he went away the sooner he would be back again.  This last argument was not without its weight, and Alexander was allowed to make "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21555"],["title","The Mission; or Scenes in Africa (#3)"],["body","preparation for his journey.  Inquiries were made, and a passage secured on board of a free-trader, which was to touch at the Cape, and in six weeks from the time that the subject had been brought up, Alexander Wilmot took leave of his grand-uncle.  \"May God bless you, sir, and keep you well till my return,\" said Alexander, pressing his hand.  \"May the Lord protect you, my dear boy, and allow you to return and close my eyes,\" replied Sir Charles, with much emotion.  Before night Alexander Wilmot was in London, from thence he hastened down to Portsmouth to embark.  The next day, the _Surprise_ weighed anchor and ran through the Needles, and before the night closed in was well down the Channel, standing before the wind, with studding-sails below and aloft.    CHAPTER THREE.  A melancholy feeling clouded the features of Alexander Wilmot as, on the following morning, the vessel, under a heavy press of sail, was fast leaving the shores of his native country.  He remained on the poop of the vessel with his eyes fixed upon the land, which every moment became more indistinct.  His thoughts may easily be imagined.  Shall I ever see that land again?  Shall I ever return, or shall my bones remain in Africa, perhaps not even buried, but bleaching in the desert?  And if I do return, shall I find my old relation still alive, or called away, loaded as he is with years, to the silent tomb?  We are in the hands of a gracious God.  His will be done.  Alexander turned away, as the land had at last become no longer visible, and found a young man of about his own age standing close to him, and apparently as much lost in reverie as he had been.  As in turning round Alexander brushed against him, he thought it right to apologise for the unintentional act, and this occasioned a conversation.  \"I believe, sir,\" said the other party, who was a tall, spare, slight-built man, with a dark complexion, \"that we were both indulging in similar thoughts as we took leave of our native shores.  Every Englishman does the same, and indeed every true lover of his country, let the country be what it will.  We find the feeling as strong in the savage as in the enlightened; it is universal.  Indeed, we may fairly say that it extends lower down to the brute species, from their love of localities.\"  \"Very true, sir,\" replied Alexander; \"but with brutes, as you say, it is merely the love of locality; with men, I trust, the feeling is more generous and noble.\"  \"So it ought to be, or else why are we so much more nobly endowed?  This is not your first voyage, I presume?\" continued the stranger.  \"Indeed, it is,\" said Alexander; \"I never was out of England, or on board of a vessel, before yesterday.\"  \"I should have imagined otherwise,\" remarked his companion: \"the other passengers are all suffering from sea-sickness, while you and I only are on the deck.  I presumed, therefore, that you had been afloat before.\"  \"I did feel very giddy yesterday evening,\" observed Alexander, \"but this morning I have no unpleasant sensation whatever.  I believe that some people do not suffer at sea.\"  \"A very few; but it appears that you are one of those most fortunate, for by experience I know how painful and distressing the sickness is for some time.  Breakfast will soon be ready; do you think that you can eat any?\"  \"Yes, a little--not much; a cup of tea or coffee,\" replied Alexander; \"but I cannot say that I have my usual appetite.  What bird is that which skims along the water?\"  \"It is the _procellarius_, as we naturalists call it, but in English, the stormy petrel; its presence denotes rough weather coming.\"  \"Then I wish it had not made its appearance,\" said Alexander, laughing; \"for with rough weather, there will of course be more motion in the vessel, and I feel the motion too much already.\"  \"I think if you eat your breakfast (although without appetite), and keep on deck, you may get over any further indisposition,\" replied the stranger.  \"Have we many passengers on board?\"  \"No; nine or ten, which is considered a small number, at least by the captain, who was complaining of his ill-luck.  They are mostly females and children.  There is a Cape gentleman who has long resided in the colony, and is now returning there.  I have had some conversation with him, and he appears a very intelligent person.  But here is the steward coming aft, to let us know that breakfast is ready.\"  The person who had thus conversed with Alexander Wilmot was a Mr Swinton, who, as he had accidentally observed, was a naturalist; he was a person of some independent property, whose ardour for science had induced him to engage in no profession, being perfectly satisfied with his income, which was sufficient for his wants and to enable him to follow up his favourite study.  He was now on his passage to the Cape of Good Hope, with no other object than to examine the natural productions of that country, and to prosecute his researches in science there, to a greater extent than had hitherto been practicable.  Before they had arrived at Madeira, at which island the ship remained three days to take in wine and fresh provisions, a great intimacy had been established between Alexander and Mr Swinton, although as yet neither knew the cause of the other's voyage to the Cape; they were both too delicate to make the inquiry, and waited till the other should of his own accord impart his reasons.  We have mentioned that there were other passengers, one of whom was a gentleman who resided in Cape Town, and who held a lucrative situation under the government.  He was an elderly gentleman, of about sixty years of age, of a very benign and prepossessing appearance; and it so happened that Alexander found out, on looking over his letters of introduction when at anchor at Madeira, that he possessed one to this gentleman.  This of course he presented at once, although they were already on intimate terms; and this introduction made Mr Fairburn (for such was his name) take an immediate interest in his welfare, and also warranted his putting the question, as to what were Alexander's views and intentions in visiting the Cape: for Mr Fairburn knew from the letter that he was heir to Sir Charles Wilmot, and therefore that he was not likely to be going out as a speculator or emigrant.  It hardly need be said that Alexander made no hesitation in confiding to one who could so materially assist him in the object of his voyage.  The other passengers were three young ladies bound to their friends in India, and a lady returning with her two marriageable daughters to rejoin her husband, who was a colonel in the Bengal army.  They were all pleasant people, the young ladies very lively, and on the whole the cabin of the _Surprise_ contained a very agreeable party; and soon after they left Madeira, they had fine weather, smooth water, and everything that could make a voyage endurable.  The awnings were spread, chairs brought up, and the major portion of the day was spent upon the quarter-deck and poop of the vessel, which for many days had been running down before the trade-winds, intending to make Rio, and there lay in a supply of fresh provisions for the remainder of her voyage.  One morning, as Alexander and Mr Fairburn were sitting together, Alexander observed--\"You have passed many years at the Cape, Mr Fairburn, have you not?\"  \"Yes; I was taken prisoner when returning from India, and remained a year in Cape Town during the time that it was in the hands of the Dutch; I was about to be sent home as a prisoner to Holland, and was embarked on board of one of the vessels in Saldanha Bay, when they were attacked by the English.  Afterwards, when the English captured the Cape, from my long residence in, and knowledge of, the country, I was offered a situation, which I accepted: the colony was restored to the Dutch, and I came home.  On its second capture I was again appointed, and have been there almost ever since.\"  \"Then you are well acquainted with the history of the colony?\"  \"I am, certainly, and if you wish it, shall be happy to give you a short account of it.\"  \"It will give me the greatest pleasure, for I must acknowledge that I know but little, and _that_ I have gleaned from the travels which I have run through very hastily.\"  \"I think it was in the year 1652 that the Dutch decided upon making a settlement at the Cape.  The aborigines, or natives, who inhabited that part of the country about Cape Town, were the Hottentots, a mild, inoffensive people, living wholly upon the produce of their cattle; they were not agriculturists, but possessed large herds of cattle, sheep, and goats, which ranged the extensive pastures of the country.  The history of the founding of one colony is, I fear, the history of most, if not all--commencing in doing all that is possible to obtain the good-will of the people until a firm footing has been obtained in the land, and then treating them with barbarity and injustice.  \"The Hottentots, won over by kindness and presents, thought it of little consequence that strangers should possess a small portion of their extensive territory, and willingly consented that the settlement should be made.  They, for the first time in their lives, tasted what proved the cause of their ruin and subsequent slavery--tobacco and strong liquors.  These two poisons, offered gratuitously, till the poor Hottentots had acquired a passion for them, then became an object of barter--a pipe of tobacco or a glass of brandy was the price of an ox; and thus daily were the colonists becoming enriched, and the Hottentots poor.  \"The colony rapidly increased, until it was so strong, that the governor made no ceremony of seizing upon such land as the government wished to retain or to give away; and the Hottentots soon discovered that not only their cattle, but the means of feeding them, were taken from them. Eventually, they were stripped of everything except their passion for tobacco and spirits, which they could not get"]]]
