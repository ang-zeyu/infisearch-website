It is not because I doubt his cleverness in presenting what he sees, but because I have a suspicion that there are some very important things which he does not see, or which do not interest him.  It is really much more satisfactory for each one to gather his life philosophy from his own experience rather than from what he reads out of a book, or from what he sees on the stage. \"The harvest of a quiet eye\" is, after all, more satisfying than the occasional discoveries of the unquiet eye that seeks only the brilliantly novel.  The inevitable discrepancy between the literary representations of life and life itself has been the cause of the ancient feud between teachers of morals and writers of fiction. Because of this Plato would banish poets from his Republic and the Puritans would exclude novelists and play-actors from their conventicles. But it is curious to observe how the character of the complaints varies with the change in literary fashions. The argument of serious persons against works of fiction used to be that they put too many romantic ideas into the reader's head.  This was the charge made by Mrs. Tabitha Tenney, one of the first of the long line of American novelists. She wrote a novel entitled \"Female Quixotism; exhibited in the Romantic Opinions and Extravagant Adventures of Dorcasina Sheldon.\" The work was addressed \"to all Columbian Young Ladies who read Novels and Romances.\" To these young ladies the solemn advice of Mrs. Tabitha Tenney was, \"Don't.\"  Miss Dorcasina was certainly a distressing example. \"At the age of three years this child had the misfortune to lose an excellent mother, whose advice would have pointed out to her the plain, rational path of life, and prevented her imagination from being filled with the airy delusions and visionary dreams of love and raptures, darts, fire and flames, with which the indiscreet writers of that fascinating kind of books denominated Novels fill the heads of artless young girls to their great injury, and sometimes to their utter ruin.\" Her father allowed her to indulge her fancy, \"never considering their dangerous tendency to a young, inexperienced female mind.\" The various calamities into which Miss Dorcasina Sheldon fell may be imagined by those who have not the patience to search for them upon the printed pages. Her parting words to those who had the guardianship of female minds had great solemnity. \"Withhold from their eyes the pernicious volumes, which while they convey false ideas of life, and inspire illusory expectations, will tend to keep them ignorant of everything worth knowing; and which if they do not eventually render them miserable may at least prevent them from becoming respectable. Suffer not their imaginations to be filled with ideas of happiness, particularly in the connubial state, which can never be realized.\"  If Mrs. Tabitha Tenney were to come to life in our day I think she would hardly feel like warning the Columbian young ladies against the effect of works of fiction in exaggerating the happiness of life in general or of the connubial state in particular. The young ladies are much more in danger of having their spirits depressed by the painstaking representation of miseries they are never likely to experience. The gloomy views of average human nature which once were conscientiously expounded by \"painful preachers\" are now taken up by painful play-wrights and story-tellers. Under the spell of powerful imaginations it is quite possible to see this world as nothing but a vale of tears.  Happily there is always a way of escape for those who are quick-witted enough to think of it in time. When fiction offers us only arid actualities, we can flee from it into the romance of real life.  I sympathize with a young philosopher of my acquaintance. He took great joy in a Jack-o-lantern. The ruddy countenance of the pumpkin was the very picture of geniality. Good-will gleamed from the round eyes, and the mouth was one luminous smile. No wonder that he asked the privilege of taking it to bed with him. He shouted gleefully when it was left on the table.  But when he was alone Mr. Jack-o-lantern assumed a more grimly realistic aspect. There was something sinister in the squint of his eye, and uncanny in the way his rubicund nose gleamed. On entering the room a little while after I found it in darkness.  \"What has become of your Jack-o-lantern?\"  \"He was making faces at me. I looked at him till I 'most got scared, so I just got up and blew him out.\"  I commended my philosopher for his good sense. It is the way to do with Jack-o-lanterns when they become unmannerly.  And I believe that it is the best way to treat distressing works of the imagination, though I know that their authors, who take themselves solemnly, will resent this advice.  We can't blow out a reality, just because it happens to make us miserable. We must face it. It is a part of the discipline of life. But a book or a play has no such right to domineer over us. Our own imagination has the first rights in its own home. If some other person's imagination intrudes and \"makes faces,\" it is our privilege to blow it out.     IV  The Ignominy of Being Grown-up  [Illustration]   As I have already intimated, my greatest intellectual privilege is my acquaintance with a philosopher. He is not one of those unsocial philosophers who put their best thoughts into books to be kept in cold storage for posterity. My Philosopher is eminently social, and is conversational in his method. He belongs to the ancient school of the Peripatetics, and the more rapidly he is moving the more satisfactory is the flow of his ideas.  He is a great believer in the Socratic method. He feels that a question is its own excuse for being. The proper answer to a question is not a stupid affirmation that would close the conversation, but another question. The questions follow one another with extreme rapidity. He acts upon my mind like an air pump. His questions speedily exhaust my small stock of acquired information. Into the mental vacuum thus produced rush all sorts of irrelevant ideas, which we proceed to share. In this way there comes a sense of intellectual comradeship which one does not have with most philosophers.  For four years my Philosopher has been interrogating Nature, and he has not begun to exhaust the subject. Though he has accumulated a good deal of experience, he is still in his intellectual prime. He has not yet reached the \"school age,\" which in most persons marks the beginning of the senile decay of the poetic imagination.  In my walks and talks with my Philosopher I have often been amazed at my own limitations. Things which are so easy for him are so difficult for me. Particularly is this the case in regard to the more fundamental principles of philosophy. All philosophy, as we know, is the search for the Good, the True, and the Beautiful. These words represent only the primary colors of the moral spectrum. Each one is broken up into any number of secondary colors. Thus the Good ranges all the way from the good to eat to the good to sacrifice one's self for; the Beautiful ascends from the most trifling prettiness to the height of the spiritually sublime; while the True takes in all manner of verities, great and small. In comparing notes with my Philosopher I am chagrined at my own color-blindness. He recognizes so many superlative excellences to which I am stupidly oblivious.   In one of our walks we stop at the grocer's, I having been asked to fill the office of domestic purveyor. It is a case where the office has sought the man, and not the man the office. Lest we forget, everything has been written down so that a wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err therein,--baking-powder and coffee and a dozen eggs, and last and least, and under no circumstances to be forgotten, a cake of condensed yeast. These things weigh upon my spirits. The thought of that little yeastcake shuts out any disinterested view of the store. It is nothing to me but a prosaic collection of the necessaries of life. I am uncheered by any sense of romantic adventure.  Not so with my Philosopher. He is in the rosy dawn of expectation. The doors are opened, and he enters into an enchanted country. His eyes grow large as he looks about him. He sees visions of the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in all their bewildering, concrete variety. They are in barrels and boxes and paper bundles. They rise toward the sky in shelves that reach at last the height of the gloriously unattainable. He walks through the vales of Arcady, among pickles and cheeses. He lifts up his eyes wonderingly to snowy Olympus crowned with Pillsbury's Best. He discovers a magic fountain, not spurting up as if it were but for a moment, but issuing forth with the mysterious slowness that befits the liquefactions of the earlier world. \"What is that?\" he asks, and I can hardly frame the prosaic word \"Molasses.\"  \"Molasses!\" he cries, gurgling with content; \"what a pretty word!\" I hadn't thought about it, but it is a pretty word, and it has come straight down from the Greek word for honey.  He discovers works of art. Surprising pictures, glowing in color, are on the walls. These are cherubs rioting in health, smiling old men, benignant matrons, radiant maidens, all feasting on nectar and ambrosia. Here and there is a pale ascetic, with a look of agony on his emaciated face.  \"What makes that man feel so bad?\" asks my Philosopher, anxious to extract a story from the picture. It seems like an inadequate explanation to say that he is only a martyr to his own folly in not getting the right kind of breakfast food.  For one thing, my Philosopher has a great physical advantage over me when it comes to seeing things. His eyes are only two feet ten inches from the ground, while mine are some five feet ten. Three feet do not count for much when we are considering astronomical distances, but they make a great"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20956"],["title","In The Yule-Log Glow, Book IV (#0)"],["body","THE                  YULE-LOG GLOW                 CHRISTMAS POEMS FROM                 'ROUND THE WORLD     \"Sic as folk tell ower at a winter ingle\"                                             _Scott_                      EDITED BY                HARRISON S.

O tidings, etc.    From God our Heavenly Father     A blessed angel came,   And unto certain shepherds     Brought tidings of the same,   How that in Bethlehem was born     The Son of God by name.                               O tidings, etc.    Fear not, then said the angel,     Let nothing you affright,   This day is born a Saviour     Of virtue, power, and might;   So frequently to vanquish all     The friends of Satan quite.                               O tidings, etc.    The shepherds at those tidings     Rejoicéd much in mind,   And left their flocks a-feeding     In tempest, storm, and wind,   And went to Bethlehem straightway     This blessed babe to find.                               O tidings, etc.    But when to Bethlehem they came,     Whereat this infant lay,   They found Him in a manger     Where oxen feed on hay;   His mother Mary kneeling     Unto the Lord did pray.                               O tidings, etc.    Now to the Lord sing praises,     All you within this place,   And with true love and brotherhood     Each other now embrace;   This holy tide of Christmas     All others doth deface.                               O tidings, etc.     WELCOME YULE.     _Welcome Yule, thou merry man,_   _In worship of this"]]]
