After breakfasting, Miss Kitty lingered a while to tease the birds, who scolded her shrilly, calling her a tramp and telling her to get out of their woods.  Of course Miss Kitty had to stay there for a time after that, to let the birds know that they couldn't frighten her away. She scared them almost out of their wits by threatening to climb up where their nests were. But she didn't do more than sharpen her claws against a tree-trunk. That alone was enough to throw them into a panic.  At last, after she had bothered the birds quite enough, Miss Kitty Cat set off for Pleasant Valley once more. Sometimes she travelled through fields; sometimes she jogged along the roads; sometimes she jumped to the top of a stone wall and used that for a highway. And always when she heard the creak and rattle of a wagon, as the sun rose higher and higher, she crept into the bushes and hid until she had the road to herself again.  If Miss Kitty hadn't been homesick she would have thought her adventure a great lark. But somehow she couldn't get Mrs. Green's house out of her mind. Especially the thought of the kitchen, with its delicious odors of seven-layer cakes baking in the oven, and doughnuts frying on top of the range, made Miss Kitty's nose twitch. And her own particular warm spot under the range, where she basked away long hours! When she recalled that it was no wonder that her pace quickened.  Perhaps Miss Kitty Cat herself couldn't have told exactly how she knew the way back to Farmer Green's place. No doubt she wouldn't have told, had she known; for she was one of the kind that keep such things to themselves. She never even explained to old dog Spot, afterward, where she spent the three nights that she was away from the farm.  Anyhow, Miss Kitty Cat kept plodding along. And one afternoon when she came out of a patch of woods on a hill-top, she saw something looming right ahead of her that looked familiar.  It was Blue Mountain. And she knew that on the other side of it lay Pleasant Valley--and her home at Farmer Green's.     XXI  IN THE PANTRY   OF COURSE everybody knows that while the cat's away the mice will play. So what happened during Miss Kitty Cat's absence from the farmhouse was really no more than any one might have expected. There were gay banquets in Mrs. Green's pantry at midnight. And among those present there was no one that had a better time than fat Mr. Moses Mouse. He was always the life of the party. He made jokes about Miss Snooper--as he called Miss Kitty Cat. And nobody laughed at them harder than he.  With every night that passed, Moses Mouse grew still merrier. Some of his companions even claimed that they could scarcely eat, he made them giggle so violently.  On the fourth night of Miss Kitty's absence, and at the fourth banquet, Mr. Mouse balanced a bit of cheese on the end of his nose, exclaiming at the same time, \"What a pity it is that Miss Snooper isn't here! How I'd like to offer her this delicious tidbit!\"  To his great surprise, none of his friends laughed.  \"Look out, Moses!\" Mrs. Mouse cried the next moment.  \"Don't worry, my dear!\" said he. \"I shan't lose this nice piece of cheese. If I drop it I can find it again. But I'm not going to drop it. I've practiced this trick a good many times.... It's too bad Miss Snooper isn't here to see it.\"  [Illustration: Miss Kitty Cat Sees Moses Mouse Balance a Bit of Cheese on His Nose.]  Still nobody even snickered--though Moses himself would have had he not been afraid of joggling the cheese off the end of his nose. He thought the silence very strange. And removing his eyes from the cheese, which he had been watching closely (though it made him look cross-eyed), he took a quick glance about him. Everybody had vanished.  \"Ha!\" said Moses Mouse to himself. \"They're playing a trick on me. They're hiding.\" And he promptly lost his temper. Much as he loved to cut capers and play tricks on others, Moses never liked to have any one get a laugh on him. And now he gave a sort of snort, because he was angry.  Thereupon the bit of cheese fell off Moses's nose and rolled behind him on the pantry floor. He turned to get it, only to find himself face to face with Miss Snooper herself; for Miss Kitty Cat was home again.  Before Moses Mouse could jump she clapped a paw down on him. And there he was--a prisoner!  \"Well, well!\" cried Miss Kitty Cat. \"Aren't you glad to see me? You were just wishing I was here.\"  Moses Mouse didn't act glad--not the least bit! He struggled his hardest to get away. But Miss Kitty hadn't the slightest trouble holding him, with only one paw, too.  \"Now that I'm here,\" she said to him, \"don't you want to balance that scrap of cheese on your nose once more, and offer it to me?\"  Since Miss Kitty caught him, Moses Mouse hadn't said anything that she could understand. He had made only a few squeaks of fright. Now, however, he managed to gasp, \"Yes! Just let me go a moment! I can't pick up the cheese while you're crushing me against the pantry floor.\"     XXII  THE FLOUR BARREL   MISS KITTY CAT took her paw off Moses Mouse, after giving him a sharp nip to warn him not to try to run away.  \"Ouch!\" Moses squeaked. And then, when he felt himself free, he picked up the hit of cheese that he had dropped upon the pantry floor. But he was shaking with fear.  He shook so hard that he couldn't balance the cheese on the end of his nose. It tumbled off at once and he turned quickly to get it. Miss Kitty Cat turned with him. And while she was turning, Moses Mouse turned back again and jumped behind a flour barrel.  She sprang after him. But the barrel stood so near the wall that there was only a small space behind it. It was wide enough for Moses Mouse to slip through; but it was entirely too narrow for Miss Kitty Cat. And Moses Mouse waited just beyond reach of her paw.  She ran around the barrel, only to find that Moses had crawled back through the opening and was watching her with his beady little eyes.  Miss Kitty Cat was almost frantic. She hurried around the barrel again, and saw that Moses Mouse had repeated his trick. He needed only to move the length of his tail, while she had to whisk all the way around the fat flour barrel.  \"This will never do,\" Miss Kitty thought, as she peered through the crack at Moses Mouse, while she paused to get her breath. And as she stared at him, an idea popped into her head. It seemed such a good idea that Miss Kitty Cat decided to act upon it at once.  So she wheeled and started off again, as if to run around the barrel once more. But when she had whisked half way around it she turned and hurried back again.  She had expected to surprise Mr. Moses Mouse on the wrong side of the crack. And to her astonishment, he wasn't there. He wasn't anywhere in sight.  \"Goodness me!\" Miss Kitty Cat wailed. \"There must have been something wrong with my idea.\"  There wasn't. It had merely happened that Moses Mouse had had an idea of his own.  \"I don't want to stay dodging here the rest of the night,\" he had said to himself. \"The next time Miss Snooper makes a trip around the barrel I'm going to run up the side of it and trust to luck.\"  That was exactly what he did. Once on top of the barrel, Moses Mouse leaped to a shelf. He crept along the shelf until he came to the pantry window. Now, Mrs. Green had left the window slightly open. And Moses Mouse darted out of doors and half jumped, half tumbled, to the ground. He knew how he could get to his nest quickly enough, through a certain chink in the cellar wall.  Miss Kitty Cat soon decided that she had lost Moses Mouse again.  \"Dear me!\" she sighed. \"What wretched luck I'm having to-night! I declare, it's a sad home-coming for me.\"  Meanwhile Mr. Moses Mouse was having a most merry time. Mrs. Mouse made a great fuss over him. And that was exactly what he liked.     XXIII  A SECRET   MISS KITTY CAT was behaving in the strangest manner. She came into the kitchen and hovered about the feet of Farmer Green's wife, mewing and looking up at Mrs. Green as if she had something special to tell her.  \"What is it, Kitty?\" Mrs. Green asked her. \"Are you hungry?\"  But Miss Kitty Cat soon showed that she wasn't hungry, for she wouldn't touch anything that Mrs. Green offered her.  \"Well, you'll have to run away, anyhow,\" Mrs. Green told her. \"I can't take a step with you right under my feet.\"  Though Miss Kitty Cat trotted towards the door, she soon made it plain that she didn't intend to leave the kitchen unless her mistress went with her. She came back and twitched Mrs. Green's apron gently with her claws. Then she ran to the doorway again and called to Mrs. Green.  It seemed to Miss Kitty Cat that she couldn't have said more clearly that she wanted to lead Mrs. Green somewhere. But still Mrs. Green didn't quite understand.  \"Scat!\" she cried, just a bit impatiently. \"I've too much to do to be bothered this morning. I suppose you've caught a mouse and want to show it to me. You'll have to bring it here, for I haven't any time to waste to-day.\"  Miss Kitty Cat felt somewhat hurt. She went out and sat on the doorstep and looked in at Farmer Green's wife. Now and then she gave a plaintive mew. But Mrs. Green wouldn't pay any attention to her.  \"Dear me!\" said Miss Kitty. \"Mrs. Green is busier than ever this morning.\"  Old dog Spot had been watching Miss Kitty's actions. And now, as she started towards the barn, he sidled up to her, wagging his tail to show her that he wanted to have a few friendly words with her.  \"If Mrs. Green won't come with you, I'll be glad to,\" he offered. \"Just lead the way and I'll follow.\"  \"You?\" Miss Kitty Cat exclaimed with scorn. \"You needn't think I'd take you where I want Mrs. Green to come. You needn't think I'd show you what I want her to see.\"  \"Ho!\" cried old Spot. \"I don't know how you're going to stop me"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21078"],["title","The Tale of Miss Kitty Cat (#7)"],["body"," following you.\"  \"I do,\" said Miss Kitty firmly. \"If you try to tag along after me where I'm going I'll soon make you wish you had minded your own affairs.\"  There was a look in her eyes that old Spot did not like. It reminded him of the time when he cornered Miss Kitty in the barn, soon after she arrived at the farm. He remembered that his nose still bore the marks of her sharp claws.  \"Well, well!\" he said. \"I was only joking. I'm too busy to bother with you, anyhow. I have a little matter to attend to in the pasture. There's a Woodchuck up there that's getting too bold.\"  Then he trotted off, trying to look as important as possible, so that no one would think he was afraid of Miss Kitty Cat.  \"Good!\" Miss Kitty cried, as she watched him while he started up the lane.  \"I'm glad he's out of the way. It would be awkward if I had to fight him while I'm doing what I'm going to do.\"     XXIV  FIVE IN A BASKET   \"WELL, if you're not bothering me again!\" Farmer Green's wife exclaimed.  Miss Kitty Cat had come up behind her and brushed against her, asking at the same time with her most polite mew if Mrs. Green wouldn't please turn around.  Mrs. Green looked over her shoulder.  \"I declare!\" she cried. \"So that's what you've been fussing about, is it?\"  Miss Kitty Cat gently laid something on the floor at her mistress' feet. And she acted much pleased when Mrs. Green bent over and picked up a tiny, soft, pudgy--kitten.  \"What do you think of that?\" Miss Kitty Cat asked Mrs. Green. At least, that was what Mrs. Green understood her to say.  Anyhow, Miss Kitty appeared delighted with what Mrs. Green told her. And feeling that her youngster was in safe hands, Miss Kitty Cat ran out of the kitchen and disappeared.  In a little while she returned, carrying another kitten in her mouth. Mrs. Green admired this one as much as the first. And again Miss Kitty vanished.  She returned with a third kitten; she returned with a fourth one.  \"Well, well!\" Farmer Green's wife said to her. \"We have enough now--don't you think so?\"  Mrs. Green soon learned that Miss Kitty Cat was not quite of the same mind. She made one more trip across the yard to the barn. And at last, with an air of great pride she set down a fifth kitten upon the kitchen floor.  \"That's all, Mrs. Green,\" Miss Kitty said. \"They're so beautiful it's a shame there aren't twice as many.\"  But Mrs. Green was out in the woodshed and didn't hear her. She came in soon with a basket.  \"This is what old Spot used to sleep in when he was a puppy,\" Mrs. Green told Miss Kitty Cat. \"I suppose you're willing to use it for your family.\"  Miss Kitty made no objection when Mrs. Green carefully laid the five kittens side by side on an old shawl which she spread in the bottom of the basket. Then Mrs. Green picked up the precious burden and with Miss Kitty following closely, set it down in a corner of the woodshed.  \"There!\" said Mrs. Green. \"Now they're snug and warm. And I'll set your milk right beside the basket, so you won't have to leave your family when you drink it.\"  [Illustration: Miss Kitty Cat Guards Her Kittens.]  It was not long before old dog Spot poked his long nose though the woodshed doorway and spied Miss Kitty Cat close beside the basket, lapping her milk. He gave a short bark when he saw her. And to his astonishment both Miss Kitty Cat and Farmer Green's wife came running at him.  Mrs. Green had a broom in her hand and Miss Kitty Cat had her claws in her paws. They both ordered him to keep away from the woodshed. And Spot sneaked off to the barn and hid in the stall beside the old horse Ebenezer.  \"What's troubling you?\" Ebenezer inquired in his slow way.  \"It's that ill-natured Miss Kitty Cat,\" Spot exclaimed. \"She has a big family of kittens. And she's terribly touchy about anybody's coming near them. Although she's keeping them in my basket, she hasn't even invited me to have a look at them.... I only hope,\" he added, \"they won't grow up to be like their mother.\"  Old Ebenezer looked down at him with mild surprise.  \"What's the matter with Miss Kitty?\" he asked.  \"She can't take a joke,\" said Spot. \"If you chase her, she always claws you if she can.\"  Now, that was one of the first things Miss Kitty taught her children. She claimed that claws were made to be used--especially on old dog Spot.  But when a kitten tried its claws on one of its mates Miss Kitty always cuffed it smartly. She claimed, then, that claws were _not_ made to be used--especially on one's own family.  And in time the kittens learned their lessons perfectly.
