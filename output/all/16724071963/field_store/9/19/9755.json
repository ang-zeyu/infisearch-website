Och, now! to think he's the ninth of them we've throwed overboard, all the crew of the owld ship, exceptin' our three selves, widout countin' the Malay an' the childer.  If it wasn't that yer honour's still left, I'd say the best goes first; for the nigger there looks as if he'd last out the whole lot of--\"  The captain, to whom this imprudent speech was torture, with a gesture brought it to an abrupt termination.  He was in fear of its effect not on the Malay, but on the insane sailor.  The latter, however, showed no sign of having heard or understood it; and in a whisper Murtagh received instructions how to act.  \"You lay hold of him by the shoulders,\" were the words spoken, \"while I take the feet.  Let us slip him quietly over without making any stir. Saloo, remain you where you are; we won't need your help.\"  This last speech was addressed to the Malay, and in his own language, which would not be understood by any other than himself.  The reason for laying the injunction upon him was, that he sat in the boat beyond the man deemed mad, and his coming across to the others might excite the latter, and bring about some vaguely dreaded crisis.  The silent Malay simply nodded an assent, showing no sign that he comprehended why his assistance was not desired.  For all that, he understood it, he too having observed the mental condition of the sailor.  Rising silently from their seats, and advancing toward the dead body, the captain and carpenter, as agreed upon, laid hold of and raised it up in their arms.  Even weak as both were, it was not much of a lift to them.  It was not a corpse, only a skeleton, with the skin still adhering, and drawn tightly over the bones.  Resting it upon the gunwale of the boat, they made a moment's pause, their eyes turned heavenward, as if mentally repeating a prayer.  The Irishman, a devout believer in the efficacy of outward observances, with one hand detached from the corpse, made the sign of the cross.  Then was the body again raised between them, held at arm's length outward, and tenderly lowered down upon the water.  There was no plunge, only a tiny plashing, as if a chair, or some other piece of light wood-work, had been dropped gently upon the surface of the sea.  But slight as was the sound, it produced an effect, startling as instantaneous.  The sailor, whose dead comrade was thus being consigned to the deep, as it were, surreptitiously, all at once sprang to his feet, sending forth a shriek that rang far over the tranquil water.  With one bound, causing the pinnace to heel fearfully over, he placed himself by the side over which the corpse had been lowered, and stood with arms upraised, as if intending to plunge after it.  The sight underneath should have awed him.  The dead body was slowly, gradually sinking, its garb of dark blue Guernsey shirt becoming lighter blue as it went deeper down in the cerulean water; while fast advancing to meet it, as if coming up from the darkest depths of the ocean, was a creature of monstrous shape, the very type of a monster.  It was the hideous hammer-headed shark, the dreaded _zygaena_ of the Celebes Sea.  With a pair of enormous eyes glaring sullenly out from two immense cheek-like protuberances, giving to its head that singular sledge-hammer appearance whence it has its name, it advanced directly toward the slow-descending corpse, itself, however, moving so rapidly that the spectators above had scarce taken in the outlines of its horrid form, when this was no longer visible.  It was hidden in what appeared a shower of bluish pearls suddenly projected underneath the water, and enveloping both the dead body of the sailor and the living form of the shark.  Through the dimness could be distinguished gleams of a pale phosphoric sheen like lightning flashes through a sky cloud; and soon after froth and bubbles rose effervescing upon the surface of the sea.  It was a terrible spectacle, though only of an instants duration.  When the subaqueous cloud cleared away, and they again looked with peering eyes down into the pellucid depths, there was nothing there, neither dead body of man, nor living form of monster.  The _zygaena_ had secured its prey, and carried the skeleton corpse to some dark cavern of the deep!  [Note 1.]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.  The hammer-headed shark, in common language, is rightly designated one of the most hideous of marine animals.  We mean hideous in outward appearance, for, of course, there is much both wonderful and beautiful in its internal organisation, and in the exquisite fitness of its structure for its peculiar part in the economy of nature.  In the general outline of its body, which is something like that of a cylinder, it resembles the ordinary sharks; and its distinctive feature is its head, which, on either side, expands like a double-headed hammer.  The eyes are very large, and placed at each extremity.  It is found in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as in the Indian Ocean, and is noted for its fierceness and voracity.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE ALBATROSS.  Captain Redwood and the Irishman were horrified at the sight that had passed under their eyes.  So, too, were the children, who had both started up from their reclining attitude, and looked over the side of the boat.  Even the impassive Malay, all his life used to stirring scenes, in which blood was often shed, could not look down into those depths, disturbed by such a tragical occurrence, without having aroused within him a sensation of horror.  All of them recoiled back into the boat, staggering down upon their seats.  One alone remained standing, and with an expression upon his face as if he was desirous of again beholding the sight.  It was not a look that betrayed pleasure, but one grim and ghastly, yet strong and steady, as if it penetrated the profoundest depths of the ocean.  It was the look of the insane sailor.  If his companions had still held any lingering doubts about his insanity, it was sufficient to dispel them.  It was the true stare of the maniac.  It was not long continued.  Scarce had they resumed their seats when the man, once more elevating his arms in the air, uttered another startling shriek, if possible louder and wilder than before.  He had stepped upon one of the boat seats, and stood with body bent, half leaning over the gunwale, in the attitude of a diver about to make his headlong plunge.  There could be no mistaking his intention to leap overboard, for his comrades could see that his muscles were strained to the effort.  All three--the captain, Murtagh, and the Malay--suddenly rose again, and leant forward to lay hold on him.  They were too late.  Before a finger could touch him he had made the fatal spring; and the next moment he was beneath the surface of the sea!  None of them felt strong enough to leap after and try to save him.  In all probability, the effort would have been idle, and worse; for the mad fancy that seemed urging him to self-destruction might still influence his mind, and carry another victim into the same vortex with himself. Restrained by this thought, they stood up in the boat, and watched for his coming up again.  He did so at length, but a good distance off.  A breeze had been gradually springing up, and during his dive the pinnace had made some way, by drifting before it.  When his head was again seen above the curling water, he was nearly a hundred yards to windward of the boat. He was not so far off as to prevent them from reading the expression upon his face, now turned toward them.  It had become changed, as if by magic.  The wild look of insanity was gone, and in its place was one almost equally wild, though plainly was it an expression of fear, or indeed terror.  The immersion into the cold, deep sea, had told upon his fevered brain, producing a quick reaction of reason; and his cries for help, now in piteous tones sent back to the boat, showed that he understood the peril in which he had placed himself.  They were not unheeded.  Murtagh and the Malay rushed, or rather tottered, to the oars; while the captain threw himself into the stern, and took hold of the tiller-ropes.  In an instant the pinnace was headed round, and moving through the water in the direction of the swimmer; who, on his side, swam toward them, though evidently with feeble stroke.  There seemed not much doubt of their being able to pick him up.  The only danger thought of by any of them was the _zygaena_; but they hoped the shark might be still occupied with its late prey, and not seeking another victim.  There might be another shark, or many more; but for some time past one only had been seen in the neighbourhood of the boat; the shark, as they supposed, which had but recently devoured the dead body of the sailor.  Trusting to this conjecture, they plied the oars with all the little strength left in their arms.  Still, notwithstanding their feeble efforts, and the impediment of pulling against the wind, they were nearing the unfortunate man, surely, if slowly.  They had got over half the distance; less than half a cable's length was now between the boat and the struggling swimmer.  Not a shark was to be seen on the water, nor beneath it--no fish of any kind--nothing whatever in the sea.  Only, in the sky above, a large bird, whose long scimitar-shaped wings and grand curving beak told them what it was--an albatross.  It was the great albatross of the Indian seas, with an extent of wing beyond that of the largest eagle, and almost equalling the spread of the South American condor.  [Note 1.]  They scarce looked at it, or even glanced above, they were looking below for the _zygaena_--scanning the surface of the water around them, or with their eyes"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21238"],["title","The Castaways (#2)"],["body","bent, endeavouring to penetrate its indigo depths in search of the monstrous form.  No shark in sight.  All seemed well; and despite the piteous appeals of the swimmer, now toiling with feebler stroke, and scarce having power to sustain himself they in the pinnace felt sure of being able to rescue him.  Less than a quarter cable's length lay between.  The boat, urged on by the oars, was still lessening the distance.  Five minutes more, and they would be close to their comrade, and lift him over the gunwale.  Still no _zygaena_ in sight--no shark of any kind.  \"Poor fellow! he seems quite cured; we shall be able to save him.\"  It was Captain Redwood who thus spoke.  The Irishman was about making a little hopeful rejoinder, when his speech was cut short by a cry from Saloo, who had suspended his stroke, as if paralysed by some sudden despair.  The Malay, who, as well as Murtagh, had been sitting with his back toward the swimmer, had slewed himself round with a quick jerk, that told of some surprise.  The movement was caused by a shadow flitting over the boat; something was passing rapidly through the air above.  It had caught the attention of the others, who, on hearing Saloo's cry, looked up along with him.  They saw only the albatross moving athwart the sky, no longer slow sailing as before, but with the swift-cutting flight of a falcon pouncing down upon its prey.  It seemed descending not in a straight line, but in an acute parabolic curve, like a thunderbolt or some aerolite projected toward the surface of the sea.  But the bird, with a whirr like the sound of running spindles, was going in a definite direction, the point evidently aimed at being the head of the swimmer!  A strange commingled shout arose over the ocean, in which several voices bore part.  Surprise pealed forth from the lips of those in the boat, and terror from the throat of the struggling man, while a hoarse croak from the gullet of the albatross, followed by what appeared a mocking scream of triumph.  Then quick succeeded a crashing sound, as the sharp heavy beak of the bird broke through the skull of the swimmer, striking him dead, as if by the shot of a six-pounder, and sending his lifeless body down toward the bottom of the sea!  It came not up again--at all events, it was never more seen by his castaway companions; who, dropping the oars in sorrowful despair, allowed the boat to drift away from the fatal spot--in whatever direction the soft-sighing breeze might capriciously carry it.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.  The albatross Is the largest of the ocean-birds.  Its wings, when extended, measuring fifteen feet, and its weight sometimes exceeding twenty to twenty-four pounds.  The common albatross is the _Diomedea exulans_ of naturalists.  Its plumage, except a few of the wing feathers, is white; its long, hard beak, which Is very powerful, is of a pale yellow colour; and its short, webbed feet are flesh coloured.  It is frequently met with in the Southern Ocean.  The species mentioned in the text is the black-beaked albatross, which frequents the India waters.  The albatross Is a formidable enemy to the sailor, for if one falls overboard, he will assuredly fall a victim to this powerful bird, unless rescued immediately by his comrades.  Its cry has some resemblance to that of the pelican; but it will also, when excited, give rent to a noise not unlike the braying of an ass.  The female makes a rude nest of earth on the sea-shore, and deposits therein her solitary egg, which is about four inches long, white, and spotted at the larger end.    CHAPTER FOUR.  THE CRY OF THE DUGONG.  Until the day on which the ninth sailor had died of starvation, and the tenth had been struck dead by the sea-bird, the castaways had taken an occasional spell at the oars.  They now no longer touched, nor thought of them.  Weakness prevented them, as well as despondency.  For there was no object in continuing the toil; no land in sight, and no knowledge of any being near.  Should a ship chance to come their way, they were as likely to be in her track lying at rest, as if engaged in laboriously rowing.  They permitted the oars, therefore, to remain motionless between the thole pins, themselves sitting listlessly on the seats, most of them with their heads bent despairingly downward.  The Malay alone kept his shining black eyes on the alert, as if despair had not yet prostrated him.  The long sultry day that saw the last of their two sailor comrades, at length came to a close, without any change in their melancholy situation.  The fierce hot sun went down into the bosom of the sea, and was followed by the short tropic twilight.  As the shades of night closed over them, the father, kneeling beside his children, sent up a prayer to Him who still held their lives in His hand; while Murtagh said the Amen; and the dark-skinned Malay, who was a Mohammedan, muttered a similar petition to Allah.  It had been their custom every night and morning, since parting from the foundered ship, and during all their long-protracted perils in the pinnace.  Perhaps that evening's vesper was more fervent than those preceding it; for they felt they could not last much longer, and that all of them were slowly, surely dying.  This night, a thing something unusual, the sky became obscured by clouds.  It might be a good omen, or a bad one.  If a storm, their frail boat would run a terrible risk of being swamped; but if rain should accompany it, there might be a chance of collecting a little water upon a tarpaulin that lay at the bottom.  As it turned out, no rain fell, though there arose what might be called a storm.  The breeze, springing up at an early hour of the day, commenced increasing after sunset.  It was the first of any consequence they had encountered since taking to the boat; and it blew right in the direction whither they intended steering.  With the freshening of the wind, as it came cool upon his brow, the castaway captain seemed to become inspired with a slight hope.  It was the same with Murtagh and the Malay.  \"If we only had a sail,\" muttered the captain, with a sigh.  \"Sail, cappen--lookee talpolin!\" said Saloo, speaking in \"pigeon English,\" and pointing to the tarpaulin in the bottom of the boat.  \"Why no him makee sail?\"  \"Yis, indade; why not?\" questioned the Irishman.  \"Comee, Multa! you help me; we step one oal--it makee mass--we lig him up little time.\"  \"All roight, Sloo,\" responded Murtagh, leaning over and seizing one of the oars, while the Malay lifted the tarpaulin from where it lay folded up, and commenced shaking the creases out of it.  With the dexterity of a practised sailor, Murtagh soon had the oar upright, and its end \"stepped,\" between two ribs of the boat, and firmly lashed to one of the strong planks that served as seats.  Assisted by the captain himself, the tarpaulin was bent on, and with a \"sheet\" attached to one corner rigged sail-fashion.  In an instant it caught the stiff breeze, and bellied out; when the pinnace feeling the impulse, began to move rapidly through the water, leaving in her wake a stream of sparkling phosphorescence that looked like liquid fire.  They had no compass, and therefore could not tell the exact direction in which they were being carried.  But a yellowish streak on the horizon, showing where the sun had set, was still lingering when the wind began to freshen, and as it was one of those steady, regular winds, that endure for hours without change, they could by this means guess at the direction--which was toward that part of the horizon where the yellowish spot had but lately faded out; in short, toward the west.  Westward from the place where the cyclone had struck the ship, lay the great island of Borneo.  They knew it to be the nearest land, and for this had they been directing the boat's course ever since their disaster.  The tarpaulin now promised to bring them nearer to it in one night, than their oars had done with days of hopeless exertion.  It was a long twelve-hour night; for under the \"Line\"--and they were less than three degrees from it--the days and nights are equal.  But throughout all its hours, the wind continued to blow steadily from the same quarter; and the spread tarpaulin, thick and strong, caught every puff of it acting admirably.  It was, in fact, as much canvas as the pinnace could well have carried on such a rough sea-breeze, and served as a storm-try sail to run her before the wind.  Captain Redwood himself held charge of the tiller; and all were cheered with the fine speed they were making--their spirits rising in proportion to the distance passed over.  Before daylight came to add to their cheerfulness, they must have made nearly a hundred miles; but ere the day broke, a sound fell upon their ears that caused a commotion among them--to all giving joy.  It came swelling over the dark surface of the deep, louder than the rush of the water or the whistling of the wind. It resembled a human voice; and although like one speaking in agony, they heard it with joy.  There was hope in the proximity of human beings, for though these might be in trouble like themselves, they could not be in so bad a state.  They might be in danger from the storm; but they would be strong and healthy--not thirsting skeletons like the occupants of the pinnace.  \"What do you think it is, captin?\" asked the Irishman.  \"Moight it be some ship in disthriss?\"  Before the captain could reply, the sound came a second time over the waters, with a prolonged wail, like the cry of a suffering sinner on his death-bed.  \"The _dugong_!\" exclaimed Saloo, this time recognising the melancholy note, so like to the voice of a human being.  \"It is,\" rejoined Captain Redwood.  \"It's that, and nothing more.\"  He said this in a despairing tone, for the dugong, which is the _manatee_, or sea-cow of the Eastern seas, could be of no service to them; on the contrary, its loud wailings"]]]
