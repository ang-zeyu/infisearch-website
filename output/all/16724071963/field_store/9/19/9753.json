This \"jambok\" is a severe chastener to an obstinate ox.  It is an elastic whip made of rhinoceros or hippopotamus skin,--hippopotamus is the best,--near six feet long, and tapering regularly from butt to tip.  Whenever the led oxen misbehaved, and Swartboy could not reach them with his long \"voorslag,\" Hendrik was ever ready to tickle them with his tough jambok; and, by this means, frighten them into good behaviour. Indeed, one of the boys was obliged to be at their head nearly all the time.  A \"leader\" is used to accompany most teams of oxen in South Africa.  But those of the field-cornet had been accustomed to draw the wagon without one, ever since the Hottentot servants fan away; and Swartboy had driven many miles with no other help than his long whip.  But the strange look of everything, since the locusts passed, had made the oxen shy and wild; besides the insects had obliterated every track or path which oxen would have followed.  The whole surface was alike,--there was neither trace nor mark.  Even Von Bloom himself could with difficulty recognise the features of the country, and had to guide himself by the sun in the sky.  Hendrik stayed mostly by the head of the leading oxen.  Hans had no difficulty in driving the flock when once fairly started.  A sense of fear kept all together, and as there was no herbage upon any side to tempt them to stray, they moved regularly on.  Von Bloom rode in front to guide the caravan.  Neither he nor any of them had made any change in their costume, but travelled in their everyday dress.  The field-cornet himself was habited after the manner of most boors,--in wide leathern trousers, termed in that country \"crackers;\" a large roomy jacket of green cloth, with ample outside pockets; a fawn-skin waistcoat; a huge white felt hat, with the broadest of brims; and upon his feet a pair of brogans of African unstained leather, known among the boors as \"feldt-schoenen\" (country shoes). Over his saddle lay a \"kaross,\" or robe of leopard-skins, and upon his shoulder he carried his \"roer\"--a large smoothbore gun, about six feet in length, with an old-fashioned flint-lock,--quite a load of itself. This is the gun in which the boor puts all his trust; and although an American backwoodsman would at first sight be disposed to laugh at such a weapon, a little knowledge of the boor's country would change his opinion of the \"roer.\"  His own weapon--the small-bore rifle, with a bullet less than a pea--would be almost useless among the large game that inhabits the country of the boor.  Upon the \"karoos\" of Africa there are crack shots and sterling hunters, as well as in the backwoods or on the prairies of America.  Curving round under the field-cornet's left arm, and resting against his side, was an immense powder-horn--of such size as could only be produced upon the head of an African ox.  It was from the country of the Bechuanas, though nearly all Cape oxen grow horns of vast dimensions. Of course it was used to carry the field-cornet's powder, and, if full, it must have contained half-a-dozen pounds at least!  A leopard-skin pouch hanging under his right arm, a hunting-knife stuck in his waist-belt, and a large meerschaum pipe through the band of his hat, completed the equipments of the trek-boor, Von Bloom.  Hans and Hendrik were very similarly attired, armed, and equipped.  Of course their trousers were of dressed sheep-skin, wide--like the trousers of all young boors--and they also wore jackets and \"feldt-schoenen,\" and broad-brimmed white hats.  Hans carried a light fowling-piece, while Hendrik's gun was a stout rifle of the kind known as a \"yager\"--an excellent gun for large game.  In this piece Hendrik had great pride, and had learnt to drive a nail with it at nearly a hundred paces.  Hendrik was _par excellence_ the marksman of the party. Each of the boys also carried a large crescent-shaped powder-horn, with a pouch for bullets; and over the saddle of each was strapped the robe or kaross, differing only from their father's in that his was of the rarer leopard-skin, while theirs were a commoner sort, one of antelope, and the other of jackal-skin.  Little Jan also wore wide trousers, jacket, \"feldt-schoenen,\" and broad-brimmed beaver,--in fact, Jan, although scarce a yard high, was, in point of costume, a type of his father,--a diminutive type of the boor.  Truey was habited in a skirt of blue woollen stuff, with a neat bodice elaborately stitched and embroidered after the Dutch fashion, and over her fair locks she wore a light sun-hat of straw with a ribbon and strings.  Totty was very plainly attired in strong homespun, without any head-dress.  As for Swartboy, a pair of old leathern \"crackers\" and a striped shirt were all the clothing he carried, beside his sheep-skin kaross.  Such were the costumes of our travellers.  For full twenty miles the plain was wasted bare.  Not a bite could the beasts obtain, and water there was none.  The sun during the day shone brightly,--too brightly, for his beams were as hot as within the tropics.  The travellers could scarce have borne them had it not been that a stiff breeze was blowing all day long.  But this unfortunately blew directly in their faces, and the dry karoos are never without dust. The constant hopping of the locusts with their millions of tiny feet had loosened the crust of earth; and now the dust rose freely upon the wind.  Clouds of it enveloped the little caravan, and rendered their forward movement both difficult and disagreeable.  Long before night their clothes were covered, their mouths filled, and their eyes sore.  But all that was nothing.  Long before night a far greater grievance was felt,--the want of water.  In their hurry to escape from the desolate scene at the kraal, Von Bloom had not thought of bringing a supply in the wagon--a sad oversight, in a country like South Africa, where springs are so rare, and running streams so uncertain.  A sad oversight indeed, as they now learnt--for long before night they were all crying out for water--all were equally suffering from the pangs of thirst.  Von Bloom thirsted, but he did not think of himself, except that he suffered from self-accusation.  He blamed himself for neglecting to bring a needful supply of water.  He was the cause of the sufferings of all the rest.  He felt sad and humbled on account of his thoughtless negligence.  He could promise them no relief--at least none until they should reach the spring.  He knew of no water nearer.  It would be impossible to reach the spring that night.  It was late when they started.  Oxen travel slowly.  Half the distance would be as much as they could make by sundown.  To reach the water they would have to travel all night; but they could not do that for many reasons.  The oxen would require to rest--the more so that they were hungered; and now Von Bloom thought, when too late, of another neglect he had committed--that was, in not collecting, during the flight of the locusts, a sufficient quantity of them to have given his cattle a feed.  This plan is often adopted under similar circumstances; but the field-cornet had not thought of it: and as but few locusts fell in the kraals where the animals had been confined, they had therefore been without food since the previous day.  The oxen in particular showed symptoms of weakness, and drew the wagon sluggishly; so that Swartboy's voice and long whip were kept in constant action.  But there were other reasons why they would have to halt when night came on.  The field-cornet was not so sure of the direction.  He would not be able to follow it by night, as there was not the semblance of a track to guide him.  Besides it would be dangerous to travel by night, for then the nocturnal robber of Africa--the fierce lion--is abroad.  They would be under the necessity, therefore, of halting for the night, water or no water.  It wanted yet half-an-hour of sundown when Von Bloom had arrived at this decision.  He only kept on a little farther in hopes of reaching a spot where there was grass.  They were now more than twenty miles from their starting-point, and still the black \"spoor\" of the locusts covered the plain.  Still no grass to be seen, still the bushes bare of their leaves, and barked!  The field-cornet began to think that he was trekking right in the way the locusts had come.  Westward he was heading for certain; he knew that.  But he was not yet certain that the flight had not advanced from the west instead of the north.  If so, they might go for days before coming upon a patch of grass!  These thoughts troubled him, and with anxious eyes he swept the plain in front, as well as to the right and left.  A shout from the keen-eyed Bushman produced a joyful effect.  He saw grass in front.  He saw some bushes with leaves!  They were still a mile off, but the oxen, as if the announcement had been understood by them, moved more briskly forward.  Another mile passed over, and they came upon grass, sure enough.  It was a very scanty pasture, though--a few scattered blades growing ever the reddish surface, but in no place a mouthful for an ox.  There was just enough to tantalise the poor brutes without filling their stomachs.  It assured Von Bloom, however, that they had now got beyond the track of the locusts; and he kept on a little farther in hopes that the pasture might get better.  It did not, however.  The country through which they advanced was a wild, sterile plain--almost as destitute of vegetation as that over which they had hitherto been travelling.  It no longer owed its nakedness to the locusts, but to the absence of water.  They had no more time to search for pasture.  The sun was already below the horizon when they halted to \"outspann.\"  A \"kraal\" should have been built for the cattle, and another for the sheep and goats.  There were bushes enough to have constructed them, but who of that tired party had the heart"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21237"],["title","The Bush Boys: History and Adventures of a Cape Farmer and his Family (#7)"],["body","cut them down and drag them to the spot?  It was labour enough--the slaughtering a sheep for supper, and collecting sufficient wood to cook it.  No kraal was made.  The horses were tied around the wagon.  The oxen, cattle, and sheep and goats, were left free to go where they pleased.  As there was no pasture near to tempt them, it was hoped that, after the fatigue of their long journey, they would not stray far from the camp-fire, which was kept burning throughout the night.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  THE FATE OF THE HERO.  But they _did_ stray.  When day broke, and the travellers looked around them, not a head of the oxen or cattle was to be seen.  Yes, there was one, and one only--the milch-cow.  Totty, after milking her on the previous night, had left her tied to a bush where she still remained.  All the rest were gone, and the sheep and goats as well.  Whither had they strayed?  The horses were mounted, and search was made.  The sheep and goats were found among some bushes not far off; but it soon appeared that the other animals had gone clean away.  Their spoor was traced for a mile or two.  It led back on the very track they had come; and no doubt any longer existed that they had returned to the kraal.  To overtake them before reaching that point, would be difficult, if at all possible.  Their tracks showed that they had gone off early in the night, and had travelled at a rapid rate--so that by this time they had most likely arrived at their old home.  This was a sad discovery.  To have followed them on the thirsting and hungry horses would have been a useless work; yet without the yoke-oxen how was the wagon to be taken forward to the spring?  It appeared to be a sad dilemma they were in; but after a short consultation the thoughtful Hans suggested a solution of it.  \"Can we not attach the horses to the wagon?\" inquired he.  \"The five could surely draw it on to the spring?\"  \"What! and leave the cattle behind?\" said Hendrik.  \"If we do not go after them, they will be all lost, and then--\"  \"We could go for them afterwards,\" replied Hans; \"but is it not better first to push forward to the spring; and, after resting the horses a while, return then for the oxen?  They will have reached the kraal by this time.  There they will be sure of water anyhow, and that will keep them alive till we get there.\"  The course suggested by Hans seemed feasible enough.  At all events, it was the best plan they could pursue; so they at once set about putting it in execution.  The horses were attached to the wagon in the best way they could think of.  Fortunately some old horse-harness formed part of the contents of the vehicle, and these were brought out and fitted on, as well as could be done.  Two horses were made fast to the disselboom as \"wheelers;\" two others to the trektow cut to the proper length; and the fifth horse was placed in front as a leader.  When all was ready, Swartboy again mounted the voor-kist, gathered up his reins, cracked his whip, and set his team in motion.  To the delight of every one, the huge heavy-laden wagon moved off as freely as if a full team had been inspanned.  Von Bloom, Hendrik, and Hans, cheered as it passed them; and setting the milch-cow and the flock of sheep and goats in motion, moved briskly after.  Little Jan and Truey still rode in the wagon; but the others now travelled afoot, partly because they had the flock to drive, and partly that they might not increase the load upon the horses.  They all suffered greatly from thirst, but they would have suffered still more had it not been for that valuable creature that trotted along behind the wagon--the cow--\"old Graaf,\" as she was called.  She had yielded several pints of milk, both the night before and that morning; and this well-timed supply had given considerable relief to the travellers.  The horses behaved beautifully.  Notwithstanding that their harness was both incomplete and ill fitted, they pulled the wagon along after them as if not a strap or buckle had been wanting.  They appeared to know that their kind master was in a dilemma, and were determined to draw him out of it.  Perhaps, too, they smelt the spring-water before them.  At all events, before they had been many hours in harness, they were drawing the wagon through a pretty little valley covered with green, meadow-looking sward; and in five minutes more were standing halted near a cool crystal spring.  In a short time all had drunk heartily, and were refreshed.  The horses were turned out upon the grass, and the other animals browsed over the meadow.  A good fire was made near the spring, and a quarter of mutton cooked--upon which the travellers dined--and then all sat waiting for the horses to fill themselves.  The field-cornet, seated upon one of the wagon-chests, smoked his great pipe.  He could have been contented, but for one thing--the absence of his cattle.  He had arrived at a beautiful pasture-ground--a sort of oasis in the wild plains, where there were wood, water, and grass,--everything that the heart of a \"vee-boor\" could desire.  It did not appear to be a large tract, but enough to have sustained many hundred head of cattle--enough for a very fine \"stock farm.\"  It would have answered his purpose admirably; and had he succeeded in bringing on his oxen and cattle, he would at that moment have felt happy enough.  But without them what availed the fine pasturage?  What could he do there without them to stock it?  They were his wealth--at least, he had hoped in time that their increase would become wealth.  They were all of excellent breeds; and, with the exception of his twelve yoke-oxen, and one or two long-horned Bechuana bulls, all the others were fine young cows calculated soon to produce a large herd.  Of course his anxiety about these animals rendered it impossible for him to enjoy a moment's peace of mind, until he should start back in search of them.  He had only taken out his pipe to pass the time, while the horses were gathering a bite of grass.  As soon as their strength should be recruited a little, it was his design to take three of the strongest of them, and with Hendrik and Swartboy, ride back to the old kraal.  As soon, therefore, as the horses were ready for the road again, they were caught and saddled up; and Von Bloom, Hendrik, and Swartboy, mounted and set out, while Hans remained in charge of the camp.  They rode at a brisk rate, determined to travel all night, and, if possible, reach the kraal before morning.  At the last point on the route where there was grass, they off-saddled, and allowed their horses to rest and refresh themselves.  They had brought with them some slices of the roast mutton, and this time they had not forgotten to fill their gourd-canteens with water--so that they should not again suffer from thirst.  After an hour's halt they continued their journey.  It was quite night when they arrived at the spot where the oxen had deserted them; but a clear moon was in the sky, and they were able to follow back the wheel-tracks of the wagon, that were quite conspicuous under the moonlight.  Now and then to be satisfied, Von Bloom requested Swartboy to examine the spoor, and see whether the cattle had still kept the back-track.  To answer this gave no great trouble to the Bushman. He would drop from his horse, and bending over the ground, would reply in an instant.  In every case the answer was in the affirmative.  The animals had certainly gone back to their old home.  Von Bloom believed they would be sure to find them there, but should they find them _alive_?  That was the question that rendered him anxious.  The creatures could obtain water by the spring, but food--where?  Not a bite would they find anywhere, and would not hunger have destroyed them all before this?  Day was breaking when they came in sight of the old homestead.  It presented a very odd appearance.  Not one of the three would have recognised it.  After the invasion of the locusts it showed a very altered look, but now there was something else that added to the singularity of its appearance.  A row of strange objects seemed to be placed upon the roof ridge, and along the walls of the kraals.  What were these strange objects, for they certainly did not belong to the buildings?  This question was put by Von Bloom, partly to himself, but loud enough for the others to hear him.  \"_Da vogels_!\"  (the vultures), replied Swartboy.  Sure enough, it was a string of vultures that appeared along the walls.  The sight of these filthy birds was more than ominous.  It filled Von Bloom with apprehension.  What could they be doing there?  There must be carrion near?  The party rode forward.  The day was now up, and the vultures had grown busy.  They flapped their shadowy wings, rose from the walls, and alighted at different points around the house.  \"Surely there must be carrion,\" muttered Von Bloom.  There _was_ carrion, and plenty of it.  As the horsemen drew near the vultures rose into the air, and a score of half-devoured carcasses could be seen upon the ground.  The long curving horns that appeared beside each carcass, rendered it easy to tell to what sort of animals they belonged.  In the torn and mutilated fragments, Von Bloom recognised the remains of his lost herd!  Not one was left alive.  There could be seen the remains of all of them, both cows and oxen, lying near the enclosures and on the adjacent plain--each where it had fallen.  But how had they fallen?  That was the mystery.  Surely they could not have perished of hunger, and so suddenly?  They could not have died of thirst, for there was the spring bubbling up just beside where they lay?  The vultures had not killed them!  What then?  Von Bloom did not ask many questions.  He was not left long in doubt. As he and his companions rode over the ground, the mystery was explained.  The tracks of lions, hyenas, and jackals, made everything clear enough.  A large troop of these animals had been upon the ground. The"]]]
