Lemon was very glad to have them, as he found them more companionable than many of the bigger fellows, and he had no difficulty in keeping them in order.  Tom Bouldon was also frequently of their party.  He had tried others, but after some experience he found their society by far the most satisfactory.  Blackall, although a bully, stood pretty well with the masters.  He had cleverness sufficient to get through his lessons with credit, and he had sense enough to keep himself out of mischief generally.  Doctor Carr now and then had uncomfortable feelings about him.  He was not altogether satisfied with his plausible answers; nor did he like the expression of his countenance, that almost sure indicator of the mind within.  Still the Doctor hoped that he might be mistaken, and did not forbid Blackall, who was appointed to the office by one of the masters, to take out a party of youngsters.  Far better would it have been for the boys had they been kept shut up within the walls of the school-room on the finest days of the year than have been allowed to go out with such an associate.  Blackall wanted to be considered a man, and he thought the sure way to become so was to imitate the vices and bad habits of men.  Too well do I remember the poison he poured into the ears of his attentive and astonished hearers. About five miles off there was a village with a few small shops in it. One of them contained books and stationery, and cigars and snuff.  It was much patronised by Blackall, not for the former, but for the latter articles.  He thought it very manly not only to have his cigar-case, but his snuff-box.  Lemon never failed to ridicule him to the other boys for his affectation of manliness.  He did this to prevent them from following so pernicious an example.  \"See that fellow, now, making a chimney of his mouth and a dust-hole of his nose,\" observed Lemon, when one day he and his party passed him, with several of his companions, lying on the grass on a hill side, three or four miles from the school.  Blackall had a huge cigar in his mouth, and a small boy sat near him, looking pale as death, and evidently suffering dreadfully.  \"What's the matter, Eden?\" asked Lemon, kindly, as he passed him.  \"Oh--oh! it's that horrid tobacco!  I thought I should like it; but I'm going to die--I know that I am.  Oh dear! oh dear!\" answered the little fellow.  \"I hope that you are not going to die,\" said Lemon; \"but you will not get well sitting there in the hot sun.  Jump up, and come with us. Bracebridge and Buttar and I will help you along.  There's a stream of clear cold water near here; a draught of that will do you much good. Think how pleasant it will be trickling down your throat, and putting out the fire which I know you feel burning within you.\"  The picture that Lemon thus wisely drew was so attractive, that the little fellow got slowly up, and tried to walk along with him.  \"Where are you going to take Eden to?\" shouted Blackall, when he saw what was occurring.  \"Out of mischief,\" answered Lemon.  \"We are going to the seaside, and-- some fresh air will do him good.\"  \"He is under my charge, and you have no business to take him away from me,\" said Blackall.  Lemon had become much interested in poor little Eden, who was a promising boy, and who he saw would be ruined if left much in Blackall's society.  He therefore, like a true-hearted, conscientious person, resolved by all means to save him.  He did not say, like some people, after a few slight efforts, \"I have done my duty.  I warned him of the consequences, and I am not called on to do any more.\"  When he wanted to draw a boy out of danger, he made him his friend; he worked and worked away; he talked to him; he showed him the inevitable result of his folly; he used arguments of all sorts; he worked on all the better feelings the boy might possess; and what was of still more avail, he did not trust to his own strength for success--he prayed earnestly at the Throne of Grace--at that Throne where such prayers are always gladly heard--that his efforts might avail: and others wondered, more than Lemon himself, how it was when Lemon took a fellow in hand that he always turned out so well.  For this important object he struggled hard to obtain popularity in the school, and succeeded; for no boy of his age and size was so popular among all the right-thinking and well-disposed boys as he was.  On this occasion he resolved not to leave Eden in Blackall's power.  \"If he wishes to come, I shall certainly allow him,\" said Lemon.  \"He was committed to my charge by Mr Ogilby, and you have no business to take him away,\" cried Blackall, still leaning lazily on his arm, and continuing to smoke.  \"To make him sick and wretched; to teach him to smoke and to drink beer and spirits, and to listen to your foul conversation--you reprobate!\" answered Lemon calmly, as he stopped and faced Blackall.  \"By God!  I'll thrash you for that as soundly as you ever were in your life,\" exclaimed Blackall, taking his cigar out of his mouth, and rising to his feet.  Earnest's heart rose to his mouth; Buttar clenched his fists tightly. Putting Eden behind them, they sprang to Lemon's side, and looked defiantly at the approaching bully.  None of the other boys of either party stirred.  Blackall did not like the aspect of affairs.  He knew that though, from his greater strength and weight, he could thrash Lemon, he could not hope at any time to gain an easy victory; and from what he had observed of Ernest, he suspected that if he did strike, he would strike very hard and sharp.  Buttar also, when once he was attempting to thrash him, had given him such a hit in the eye that the mark had remained for a fortnight at least, to the no small satisfaction of those whom he had been accustomed to bully.  He therefore stopped just before he got up to Lemon.  \"Come,\" he said, \"I don't want to quarrel.  Let Eden remain, and I'll cry _pax_.\"  \"Certainly not, Blackall, you've let Eden do what is forbidden; you are setting him a bad example.  I shall therefore be glad to take him away from you.  He wishes to accompany me, and I shall let him do so,\" was the answer.  \"Oh, you're a puritanical saint, Lemon,--all the school knows that,\" said Blackall with a sneer with which he hoped to cover his own retreat. He had been telling the fellows around him that he felt very seedy, and as he looked at the firm front of his three antagonists he had no fancy to commence a desperate fight with them.  \"I wish to deserve the good opinion of my schoolfellows, and I do not believe that they will agree with you,\" said Lemon.  \"If hating vice and despising the low practices in which you indulge will make me a saint, I am ready to acknowledge the impeachment, and I can only say that I hope the poor little fellows may see the hideousness of sin, and loathe it as much as they do the vile tobacco-leaves you give them to suck, and the spirits and beer which you teach them to drink.  Stop! hear me out. There is nothing immoral in drinking a glass of beer or in smoking, but in our case they are both forbidden by the Doctor, whom we are bound to obey.  Both become vices when carried to excess, as you, Blackall, carry them, and would teach your pitiable imitators to carry them; and I warn you and them that such practices can only bring you disgrace and misery at last.\"  Lemon, without saying another word, turned on his heel, and, accompanied by his two sturdy supporters, was walking away.  \"Do you mean to say that I drink?\" shouted Blackall, with an oath, as soon as he could recover from the astonishment into which this unusual style of address had thrown him.  Lemon turned round, looked him full in the face, and said, \"I do.\"  Then he went on the way he had been going.  Blackall did not say another word, but staggered back to the bank on which he had been sitting, and endeavoured to re-light the end of the cigar he had dropped when he got up.  He knew that Lemon had spoken the truth.  Already he had that day stopped at more than one road-side ale-house and drunk several glasses of beer.  \"_In vino-veritas_,\" is a true saying.  Blackall when sober might pass for a very brave fellow: his true character came out when he was drunk, and he showed himself an arrant coward, as he had done on this occasion.  The boys who remained with him looked very foolish, and some of them felt heartily ashamed of their leader.  Some resolved to break from him altogether, but he had thrown his chains too firmly over others to allow them to hope or even to wish to get free from him. Lemon, Ernest, Buttar, and their companions continued their walk, carrying poor little Eden along with them.  He confessed to having chewed a piece of the cigar and swallowed it, before he discovered that it was not intended to be eaten.  Happily for him, he became violently sick, and then, having washed his face in a brook and taken a draught of cold water, he was able to enjoy the beautiful coast scenery the party ultimately reached.  \"Is not this much better than sitting smoking and boozing with that thick-headed fellow, Blackall, and his set?\" said Ernest, addressing young Eden.  \"Indeed it is,\" was the answer.  \"I'm sure if Lemon will let me come with him, I will gladly promise never to go out with Blackall any more.\"  \"Stick to that resolution, my boy,\" replied Ernest.  \"I'll undertake that Lemon will let you accompany him; and now let us go down on the beach.  These sands look very tempting.\"  The whole party were soon on the sands, strolling along and picking up the various marine curiosities they found in their way.  Most of the party wondered at the odd-shaped things they picked up, but had not the slightest notion of their names, or even whether they were animal or vegetable.  Ernest knew very little on the subject, though he had read a book or so about the wonders of the sea-shore; but Lemon was able to give his party nearly all the information they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21452"],["title","Ernest Bracebridge: School Days (#6)"],["body","uired.  One of their number was called John Gregson.  He was looked upon by the school generally as rather stupid.  He seldom joined in any of their games; and when he did, played them very badly, unless they were such as required more judgment than practice.  Now, however, he showed that he possessed some knowledge which the others did not.  Ernest had picked up a roundish object with a hole through it, and partly covered with spines, which Tom Bouldon stoutly declared to be a fish's egg.  \"It must have been a very large fish, then,\" observed Ernest.  \"Those prickles, too, are puzzling.  Perhaps they grew after the egg was laid.\"  The general opinion was that Gregson knew something about all sorts of out-of-the-way matters.  \"I say, Gregson, this is a regular-built _egg_; isn't it?\" said Bouldon, as soon as he could be found.  He was discovered up to his knees in a pool among the rocks, with a hammer and chisel in hand, working perseveringly under water.  \"No; you first make a statement totally at variance with the truth, and then ask a question,\" answered the young naturalist, looking up from his occupation, but apparently not well pleased at being interrupted.  \"That is the _Echinus esculentus_, or sea-urchin.  Just let me finish knocking off this magnificent anemone, and I'll tell you all about it.\"  \"Anemone!  Oh, I know--one of those curious coloured sea-weedy things I've seen girls collect at watering-places,\" observed Bouldon, whose knowledge of natural history was not very extensive.  \"I'd save you all that trouble; let me cut it off with my knife.\"  \"Not for the world; you'd kill it, to a certainty,\" exclaimed Gregson. \"See, I have knocked off a piece of the rock to which it is sticking, and I may now put it into my jar.  Now I could cut off any portion of it, and the part cut off will turn into a new anemone, but if I were to injure the base the animal would quickly die.  They belong to the class scientifically called _Anthozoa_ or living flowers, because from their external appearance they seem to partake of the vegetable nature.  Just look into that part of the pool which I have left undisturbed.  See, there are two of them feeding.  Look how they stretch out their long tentacles to catch hold of their food.  Ah! that one has got hold of a tiny shrimp, and is tucking it into his hungry maw, which is just in the middle of its flower-like body.  Is he not a handsome fellow?  What beautiful colours he presents!  Ah!  I thought that I should see something else in the pool that you would think curious.  Look down close.  There are three or more little globular bodies floating about like balloons.  The animal is the berve.  It has ciliated bands round it, like the marks on a melon.  What a beautiful iridescent light plays over them!  They enable it to move over the water, while with its long tentacles it fishes for its food.  At night those cilia shine with a phosphorescent light, and have a very beautiful appearance.  Stop! oh, don't go away without looking more particularly at this submarine forest.  The woods of America in autumn do not present more gorgeous colours.  That beautiful pink weed is the _Delesseria sanguinea_.  Let us pull up some and take it with us to dry it.  It will keep its colour for years and its smell for months.  See, those are shrimps cruising in and about those delicate branches, and crabs crawling round their stems, and sandskippers darting about; ah, and there comes a goby!  Did any of you ever see a goby?  Look at him!--what bright eyes he has got!  He is hardly bigger than a shrimp, but he is their deadly enemy.  He eats up their eggs and the young shrimps, as well as sandhoppers, and indeed anything living which he can get into his big mouth.  In his way he is just as terrific a fellow as the shark.  He is very hardy, too, and will live in an aquarium with perfect contentment provided he can get enough to eat.\"  \"Well, I had no notion that so many curious things were to be found in a little pool of water,\" observed Bouldon.  \"I've looked into hundreds, but never found anything that I know of.\"  \"Oh, I have not mentioned a quarter of the things to be found even in this pool,\" answered Gregson.  \"Ah, look at that soldier-crab now!  He has just come out from among the sea-weed with his stolen shell in which he has stowed away his soft tail.  I'll tell you all about him--\"  \"Not now, Greggy, thank you,\" exclaimed Bouldon, who was getting somewhat tired of the naturalist's accounts.  When Gregson once began on his favourite subject he was never inclined to stop.  Nor was that surprising, for no subject is more interesting and absorbing to those who once take it up--nothing affords more pure or unmixed delight.  \"But I say, Greggy, you promised to tell us about this sea-egg, or whatever it is called,\" said Buttar.  \"Come, I want to hear.\"  \"Well, look at this starfish,\" answered Gregson, drawing a five-fingered jack from his jar.  Then, taking the echinus in his hand,--\"These two fellows are first cousins, very nearly related, though you may not be inclined to believe the fact.  The thing you call an egg was as much a living being, capable of feeding itself and producing young, as this starfish.  If I was to bend round the rays of the starfish and fill up the interior, I could produce an animal very like the echinus.  Both of them have also a mouth at the lower part, and their internal structure is very similar.  It is curious that as the echinus grows he continually sends forth a substance from the interior which simultaneously increases the sides of all the plates which form his shell, and thus he never finds his coat too small for him.  The spines which appear so rigid when he is dead, he can move when alive in any direction, and they are an excellent substitute for feet; while he can put forth tentacles from the centre orifice, which serve him as hands.  Did you ever see a starfish walk?  Well, he can get very rapidly over the ground and up steep rocks. He can bend his body into any shape, and the lower surface is covered with vast numbers of tentacles, with which he can work his onward way; and it is extraordinary what long journeys he is able to accomplish by perseverance.\"  Gregson wound up his lecture by promising to commence a salt-water aquarium, and most of his companions undertook to make another excursion with him for the purpose of conveying back a sufficient supply of salt-water and living curiosities to stock it.  They all agreed that they had mightily enjoyed their day's excursion.  Ernest, for the first time since he had come to school, felt rather ashamed of himself that he knew so little about natural history, especially of the sea, and he resolved to take every opportunity of making himself acquainted with the subject.  Just before they reached home they passed through the field where they had left Blackall and his party.  Most of the boys had gone away; but they saw three or four collected together at the bank where the bully had been sitting.  He was there; and his companions were bending over him endeavouring to rouse him up.  Several empty porter bottles lay near, which plainly told what was the matter with him--he was helplessly tipsy.  Lemon, and Ernest, and Buttar went forward to help to drag him along.  He looked a picture of imbecility and brutishness.  He knew none of them; and only grinned horribly when they spoke to him.  Though they felt he richly deserved punishment, it was a point of honour to endeavour to save a school-fellow from disgrace, so they hauled him along and got him into his room and put to bed without meeting any of the masters or the matron--an undertaking they could not have performed except in the holidays.  Nearly all his companions next day looked very wretched and complained of headaches--a pretty strong proof of the ill effects of drinking.  Alas, how many youths have been hopelessly ruined by the example and counsels of a wretch like Blackall!--and how many, in consequence of habits such as his, have sunk into an early and unhonoured grave, after continuing for a time a trouble and shame to all belonging to them!  Let masters and parents watch carefully against the first steps taken, often through folly and idleness, towards so vile a habit; and most earnestly do I pray that none of my young readers may be tempted to adopt so destructive a practice.    CHAPTER THREE.  OUR GRAND HARE HUNT.  \"Who's for a jolly good game of hare and hounds?\" exclaimed Tom Bouldon, rushing into the play-room, where a number of boys were assembled, soon after breakfast, on a lovely day during the Easter holidays.  Nearly everybody replied, \"I am, I, I, I.\"  \"That's right; we couldn't have finer weather, and it's sure to last. I've been talking to young Bracebridge, and he has undertaken to do hare,\" observed Bouldon.  \"I know what some of you will say: he's a new fellow, and isn't fit for the work; but there isn't such a runner in the school.  You see how he enters into all the games, though he has never played them before.  I'll bet he'll make as good a hare as we've ever had, if not a better.  That's my opinion.\"  This oration of Tommy's had the desired effect.  With but few dissentient voices, Ernest was elected to the honour of acting hare. Tommy hurried out to inform him of the fact.  Ernest was not well prepared for the undertaking.  He had only entered two or three times before into the sport, but still he sufficiently understood what was required of him, to feel that he should make a very creditable hare. He, however, thought that it would be more satisfactory if he was to consult with Bouldon and Buttar, as to what line of country he should take.  They told him that if they knew, it would spoil their fun; so they went and found Lemon, who gladly undertook to give him his advice on the subject.  In the meantime, all hands were busily employed in making scent; that is, tearing into the smallest possible pieces all the bits of paper"]]]
