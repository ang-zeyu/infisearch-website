As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for       not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its       gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly       portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief,       as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den,) but       the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the       dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing       a fitful and garish lustre. All was dark yet splendid—as that ebony       to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.            The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual       faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted       before the window, prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each       visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, I could       frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of       long years.            With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob,       when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old       man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)—a countenance which       at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the       absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. Any thing even remotely       resembling that expression I had never seen before. I well remember that       my first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it,       would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the       fiend. As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to       form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and       paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution,       of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood       thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense—of       supreme despair. I felt singularly aroused, startled, fascinated. “How       wild a history,” I said to myself, “is written within that bosom!” Then       came a craving desire to keep the man in view—to know more of him.       Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my       way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I       had seen him take; for he had already disappeared. With some little       difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed       him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention.            I had now a good opportunity of examining his person. He was short in       stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally,       were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong       glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of       beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a       closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped       him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. These       observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the       stranger whithersoever he should go.            It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city,       soon ending in a settled and heavy rain. This change of weather had an odd       effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new       commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the       jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. For my own part I did       not much regard the rain—the lurking of an old fever in my system       rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a       handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man held       his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked       close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never once turning       his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and by he passed into a       cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so       much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a change in his       demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with less object than       before—more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed the way       repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick that, at       every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely. The street was a       narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour,       during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number       which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the park—so vast a       difference is there between a London populace and that of the most       frequented American city. A second turn brought us into a square,       brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. The old manner of the       stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled       wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who       hemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I was       surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the       square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I astonished       to see him repeat the same walk several times—once nearly detecting       me as he came round with a sudden movement.            In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with       far less interruption from passengers than at first. The rain fell fast;       the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. With a       gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a by-street comparatively       deserted. Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an       activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put       me to much trouble in pursuit. A few minutes brought us to a large and       busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well       acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he       forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and       sellers.            During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place,       it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without       attracting his observation. Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc       over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence. At no moment did he       see that I watched him. He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke       no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare. I was now       utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we should not       part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him.            A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the       bazaar. A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and       at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. He hurried into       the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with       incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less lanes, until we       emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started—the       street of the D—— Hotel. It no longer wore, however, the same       aspect. It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and       there were few persons to be seen. The stranger grew pale. He walked       moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh,       turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great       variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the       principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were       thronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he       threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his       countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon his       breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that he now       took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience—but,       upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his       actions.            As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness       and vacillation were resumed. For some time he followed closely a party of       some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped       off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane       little frequented. The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in       thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which       brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from       those we had hitherto traversed. It was the most noisome quarter of       London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable       poverty, and of the most desperate crime. By the dim light of an       accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen       tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that scarce       the semblance of a passage was discernible between them. The paving-stones       lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass.       Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters. The whole atmosphere       teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life       revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned       of a London"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2151"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 5 (#8)"],["body","were seen reeling to and fro. The spirits of the old       man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death hour. Once more       he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze       of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge       suburban temples of Intemperance—one of the palaces of the fiend,       Gin.            It was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still       pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. With a half shriek of joy       the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original       bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among       the throng. He had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to       the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night. It was       something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the       countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously.       Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced       his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty London. Long and swiftly he       fled, while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to       abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing. The sun       arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most       thronged mart of the populous town, the street of the D——       Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely       inferior to what I had seen on the evening before. And here, long, amid       the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit of the       stranger. But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not       pass from out the turmoil of that street. And, as the shades of the       second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in       front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. He noticed       me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained       absorbed in contemplation. “This old man,” I said at length,       “is the type and the genius of deep crime. He refuses to be alone.       _He is the man of the crowd._ It will be in vain to follow; for I       shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst heart of the       world is a grosser book than the ‘Hortulus Animæ,’ {*1} and       perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ‘_er lasst       sich nicht lesen._’”                  {*1} The “_Hortulus Animæ cum Oratiunculis Aliquibus Superadditis_”        of Grünninger.     NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD         A Tale With a Moral.            “_Con tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says Don Thomas de las       Torres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” _“sean puras y castas,       importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_—meaning,       in plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure       personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We       presume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would be       a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him there       until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely upon       the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a moral; and,       what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every       fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a commentary upon       the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s object was to excite a       distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going a step farther, shows that       the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and       drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has satisfied himself that, by       Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin; by Antinous, Martin Luther;       by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general; and, by the Harpies, the Dutch.       Our more modern Scholiasts are equally acute. These fellows demonstrate a       hidden meaning in “The Antediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views       in Cock Robin,” and transcendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it       has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound       design. Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for       example, need have no care of his moral. It is there—that is to say,       it is somewhere—and the moral and the critics can take care of       themselves. When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended,       and all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,”        or the “Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended,       and the rest that he clearly meant to intend:—so that it will all       come very straight in the end.            There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by       certain ignoramuses—that I have never written a moral tale, or, in       more precise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics       predestined to bring me out, and develop my morals:—that is the       secret. By and by the “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them       ashamed of their stupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution—by       way of mitigating the accusations against me—I offer the sad history       appended,—a history about whose obvious moral there can be no       question whatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals       which form the title of the tale. I should have credit for this       arrangement—a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who       reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus       sneak it in at the fag end of their fables.            _Defuncti injuriâ ne afficiantur_ was a law of the twelve tables, and _De       mortuis nil nisi bonum_ is an excellent injunction—even if the dead       in question be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design,       therefore, to vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad       dog, it is true, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was       not to blame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his       mother. She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant—for       duties to her well-regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies,       like tough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the       better for beating—but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be       left-handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left       unflogged. The world revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a       baby from left to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an       evil propensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks       its quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,       and, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was       getting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in my       eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when he       had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have       mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced beyond       that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand it no longer,       but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my voice, made       prophecy of his ruin.            The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age he       used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At six       months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he was in       the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies. At eight       months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the Temperance       pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until,       at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon wearing       moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing, and       for backing his assertions by bets.            Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had       predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown with       his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when he came to       be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with       a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid wagers—no. I will       do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs. With       him the thing was a mere formula—nothing more. His expressions on       this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They were simple if       not altogether innocent expletives—imaginative phrases wherewith to       round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and so,” nobody ever       thought of taking him up; but still I could not help thinking it my duty       to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him. It was a       vulgar one—this I begged him to believe. It was discountenanced by       society—here I said nothing but the truth. It was forbidden by act       of Congress—here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie.       I remonstrated—but to no purpose. I demonstrated—in vain. I       entreated—he smiled. I implored—he laughed. I preached—he       sneered. I threatened—he swore. I kicked him—he called for the       police. I pulled his nose—he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil       his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again.            Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of       Dammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and       this was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about"]]]
