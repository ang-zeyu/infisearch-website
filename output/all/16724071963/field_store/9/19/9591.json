But he was always thinking, thinking, thinking, for all that; and under his little sheepskin winter coat and his rough hempen summer shirt his heart had and much courage in it as Hofer's ever had,--great Hofer, who is a household word in all the Innthal, and whom August always reverently remembered when he went to the city of Innspruck and ran out by the foaming water-mill and under the wooded height of Berg Isel.  August lay now in the warmth of the stove and told the children stories, his own little brown face growing red with excitement as his imagination glowed to fever-heat. That human being on the panels, who was drawn there as a baby in a cradle, as a boy playing among flowers, as a lover sighing under a casement, as a soldier in the midst of strife, as a father with children round him, as a weary, old, blind man on crutches, and, lastly, as a ransomed soul raised up by angels, had always had the most intense interest for August, and he had made, not one history for him, but a thousand; he seldom told them the same tale twice. He had never seen a story-book in his life; his primer and his mass-book were all the volumes he had. But nature had given him Fancy, and she is a good fairy that makes up for the want of very many things! only, alas! her wings are so very soon broken, poor thing, and then she is of no use at all.  \"It is time for you all to go to bed, children,\" said Dorothea, looking up from her spinning. \"Father is very late to-night; you must not sit up for him.\"  \"Oh, five minutes more, dear Dorothea!\" they pleaded; and little rosy and golden Ermengilda climbed up into her lap. \"Hirschvogel is so warm, the beds are never so warm as he. Cannot you tell us another tale, August?\"  \"No,\" cried August, whose face had lost its light, now that his story had come to an end, and who sat serious, with his hands clasped on his knees, gazing on to the luminous arabesques of the stove.  \"It is only a week to Christmas,\" he said, suddenly.  \"Grandmother's big cakes!\" chuckled little Christof, who was five years old, and thought Christmas meant a big cake and nothing else.  \"What will Santa Claus find for 'Gilda if she be good?\" murmured Dorothea over the child's sunny head; for, however hard poverty might pinch, it could never pinch so tightly that Dorothea would not find some wooden toy and some rosy apples to put in her little sister's socks.  \"Father Max has promised me a big goose, because I saved the calf's life in June,\" said August; it was the twentieth time he had told them so that month, he was so proud of it.  \"And Aunt Maïla will be sure to send us wine and honey and a barrel of flour; she always does,\" said Albrecht. Their aunt Maïla had a chalet and a little farm over on the green slopes towards Dorp Ampas.  \"I shall go up into the woods and get Hirschvogel's crown,\" said August; they always crowned Hirschvogel for Christmas with pine boughs and ivy and mountain-berries. The heat soon withered the crown; but it was part of the religion of the day to them, as much so as it was to cross themselves in church and raise their voices in the \"O Salutaris Hostia.\"  And they fell chatting of all they would do on the Christ-night, and one little voice piped loud against another's, and they were as happy as though their stockings would be full of golden purses and jewelled toys, and the big goose in the soup-pot seemed to them such a meal as kings would envy.                                   IV   In the midst of their chatter and laughter a blast of frozen air and a spray of driven snow struck like ice through the room, and reached them even in the warmth of the old wolf-skins and the great stove. It was the door which had opened and let in the cold; it was their father who had come home.  The younger children ran joyous to meet him. Dorothea pushed the one wooden arm-chair of the room to the stove, and August flew to set the jug of beer on a little round table, and fill a long clay pipe; for their father was good to them all, and seldom raised his voice in anger, and they had been trained by the mother they had loved to dutifulness and obedience and a watchful affection.  To-night Karl Strehla responded very wearily to the young ones' welcome, and came to the wooden chair with a tired step and sat down heavily, not noticing either pipe or beer.  \"Are you not well, dear father?\" his daughter asked him.  \"I am well enough,\" he answered, dully, and sat there with his head bent, letting the lighted pipe grow cold.  He was a fair, tall man, gray before his time, and bowed with labor.  \"Take the children to bed,\" he said, suddenly, at last, and Dorothea obeyed. August stayed behind, curled before the stove; at nine years old, and when one earns money in the summer from the farmers, one is not altogether a child any more, at least in one's own estimation.  August did not heed his father's silence: he was used to it. Karl Strehla was a man of few words, and, being of weakly health, was usually too tired at the end of the day to do more than drink his beer and sleep. August lay on the wolf-skin, dreamy and comfortable, looking up through his drooping eyelids at the golden coronets on the crest of the great stove, and wondering for the millionth time whom it had been made for, and what grand places and scenes it had known.  Dorothea came down from putting the little ones in their beds; the cuckoo-clock in the corner struck eight; she looked to her father and the untouched pipe, then sat down to her spinning, saying nothing. She thought he had been drinking in some tavern; it had been often so with him of late.  There was a long silence; the cuckoo called the quarter twice; August dropped asleep, his curls falling over his face; Dorothea's wheel hummed like a cat.  Suddenly Karl Strehla struck his hand on the table, sending the pipe on the ground.  \"I have sold Hirschvogel,\" he said; and his voice was husky and ashamed in his throat. The spinning-wheel stopped. August sprang erect out of his sleep.  \"Sold Hirschvogel!\" If their father had dashed the holy crucifix on the floor at their feet and spat on it, they could not have shuddered under the horror of a greater blasphemy.  \"I have sold Hirschvogel!\" said Karl Strehla, in the same husky, dogged voice. \"I have sold it to a travelling trader in such things for two hundred florins. What would you?--I owe double that. He saw it this morning when you were all out. He will pack it and take it to Munich to-morrow.\"  Dorothea gave a low shrill cry:  \"Oh, father!--the children--in mid-winter!\"  She turned white as the snow without; her words died away in her throat.  August stood, half blind with sleep, staring with dazed eyes as his cattle stared at the sun when they came out from their winter's prison.  \"It is not true! It is not true!\" he muttered. \"You are jesting, father?\"  Strehla broke into a dreary laugh.  \"It is true. Would you like to know what is true too?--that the bread you eat, and the meat you put in this pot, and the roof you have over your heads, are none of them paid for, have been none of them paid for for months and months: if it had not been for your grandfather I should have been in prison all summer and autumn, and he is out of patience and will do no more now. There is no work to be had; the masters go to younger men: they say I work ill; it may be so. Who can keep his head above water with ten hungry children dragging him down? When your mother lived, it was different. Boy, you stare at me as if I were a mad dog! You have made a god of yon china thing. Well--it goes: goes to-morrow. Two hundred florins, that is something. It will keep me out of prison for a little, and with the spring things may turn----\"  August stood like a creature paralyzed. His eyes were wide open, fastened on his father's with terror and incredulous horror; his face had grown as white as his sister's; his chest heaved with tearless sobs.  \"It is not true! It is not true!\" he echoed, stupidly. It seemed to him that the very skies must fall, and the earth perish, if they could take away Hirschvogel. They might as soon talk of tearing down God's sun out of the heavens.  \"You will find it true,\" said his father, doggedly, and angered because he was in his own soul bitterly ashamed to have bartered away the heirloom and treasure of his race and the comfort and health-giver of his young children. \"You will find it true. The dealer has paid me half the money to-night, and will pay me the other half to-morrow when he packs it up and takes it away to Munich. No doubt it is worth a great deal more,--at least I suppose so, as he gives that,--but beggars cannot be choosers. The little black stove in the kitchen will warm you all just as well. Who would keep a gilded, painted thing in a poor house like this, when one can make two hundred florins by it? Dorothea, you never sobbed more when your mother died. What is it, when all is said?--a bit of hardware much too grand-looking for such a room as this. If all the Strehlas had not been born fools it would have been sold a century ago, when it was dug up out of the ground. 'It is a stove for a museum,' the trader said when he saw it. To a museum let it go.\"  August gave a shrill shriek like a hare's when it is caught for its death, and threw himself on his knees at his father's feet.  \"Oh, father, father!\" he cried, convulsively, his hands closing on Strehla's knees, and his uplifted face blanched and distorted with terror. \"Oh, father, dear father, you cannot mean what you say? Send _it_ away--our life, our sun, our joy, our comfort? We shall all die in the dark and cold. Sell _me_ rather. Sell me to any trade or any pain you like; I will not mind. But Hirschvogel!--it is like selling the very cross off the altar! You must be in jest. You could not do such a thing--you could not!--you who have always been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20997"],["title","The Nürnberg Stove (#3)"],["body","and good, and who have sat in the warmth here year after year with our mother. It is not a piece of hardware, as you say; it is a living thing, for a great man's thoughts and fancies have put life into it, and it loves us though we are only poor little children, and we love it with all our hearts and souls, and up in heaven I am sure the dead Hirschvogel knows! Oh, listen; I will go and try and get work to-morrow! I will ask them to let me cut ice or make the paths through the snow. There must be something I could do, and I will beg the people we owe money to to wait; they are all neighbors, they will be patient. But sell Hirschvogel!--oh, never! never! never! Give the florins back to the vile man. Tell him it would be like selling the shroud out of mother's coffin, or the golden curls off Ermengilda's head! Oh, father, dear father! do hear me, for pity's sake!\"  Strehla was moved by the boy's anguish. He loved his children, though he was often weary of them, and their pain was pain to him. But besides emotion, and stronger than emotion, was the anger that August roused in him: he hated and despised himself for the barter of the heirloom of his race, and every word of the child stung him with a stinging sense of shame.  And he spoke in his wrath rather than in his sorrow.  \"You are a little fool,\" he said, harshly, as they had never heard him speak. \"You rave like a play-actor. Get up and go to bed. The stove is sold. There is no more to be said. Children like you have nothing to do with such matters. The stove is sold, and goes to Munich to-morrow. What is it to you? Be thankful I can get bread for you. Get on your legs, I say, and go to bed.\"  Strehla took up the jug of ale as he paused, and drained it slowly as a man who had no cares.  August sprang to his feet and threw his hair back off his face; the blood rushed into his cheeks, making them scarlet; his great soft eyes flamed alight with furious passion.  \"You _dare_ not!\" he cried, aloud, \"you dare not sell it, I say! It is not yours alone; it is ours----\"  Strehla flung the emptied jug on the bricks with a force that shivered it to atoms, and, rising to his feet, struck his son a blow that felled him to the floor. It was the first time in all his life that he had ever raised his hand against any one of his children.  Then he took the oil-lamp that stood at his elbow and stumbled off to his own chamber with a cloud before his eyes.  \"What has happened?\" said August, a little while later, as he opened his eyes and saw Dorothea weeping above him on the wolf-skin before the stove. He had been struck backward, and his head had fallen on the hard bricks where the wolf-skin did not reach. He sat up a moment, with his face bent upon his hands.  \"I remember now,\" he said, very low, under his breath.  Dorothea showered kisses on him, while her tears fell like rain.  \"But, oh, dear, how could you speak so to father?\" she murmured. \"It was very wrong.\"  \"No, I was right,\" said August, and his little mouth, that hitherto had only curled in laughter, curved downward with a fixed and bitter seriousness. \"How dare he? How dare he?\" he muttered, with his head sunk in his hands. \"It is not his alone. It belongs to us all. It is as much yours and mine as it is his.\"  Dorothea could only sob in answer. She was too frightened to speak. The authority of their parents in the house had never in her remembrance been questioned.  \"Are you hurt by the fall, dear August?\" she murmured, at length, for he looked to her so pale and strange.  \"Yes--no. I do not know. What does it matter?\"  He sat up upon the wolf-skin with passionate pain upon his face; all his soul was in rebellion, and he was only a child and was powerless.  \"It is a sin; it is a theft; it is an infamy,\" he said, slowly, his eyes fastened on the gilded feet of Hirschvogel.  \"Oh, August, do not say such things of father!\" sobbed his sister. \"Whatever he does, _we_ ought to think it right.\"  [Illustration: \"IT IS A SIN, IT IS A THEFT, IT IS AN INFAMY,\" HE SAID]  August laughed aloud.  \"Is it right that he should spend his money in drink?--that he should let orders lie unexecuted?--that he should do his work so ill that no one cares to employ him?--that he should live on grandfather's charity, and then dare sell a thing that is ours every whit as much as it is his? To sell Hirschvogel! Oh, dear God! I would sooner sell my soul!\"  \"August!\" cried Dorothea, with piteous entreaty. He terrified her, she could not recognize her little, gay, gentle brother in those fierce and blasphemous words.  August laughed aloud again; then all at once his laughter broke down into bitterest weeping. He threw himself forward on the stove, covering it with kisses, and sobbing as though his heart would burst from his bosom.  What could he do? Nothing, nothing, nothing!  \"August, dear August,\" whispered Dorothea, piteously, and trembling all over,--for she was a very gentle girl, and fierce feeling terrified her,--\"August, do not lie there. Come to bed: it is quite late. In the morning you will be calmer. It is horrible indeed, and we shall die of cold, at least the little ones; but if it be father's will----\"  \"Let me alone,\" said August, through his teeth, striving to still the storm of sobs that shook him from head to foot. \"Let me alone. In the morning!--how can you speak of the morning?\"  \"Come to bed, dear,\" sighed his sister. \"Oh, August, do not lie and look like that! you frighten me. Do come to bed.\"  \"I shall stay here.\"  \"Here! all night!\"  \"They might take it in the night. Besides, to leave it _now_!\"  \"But it is cold! the fire is out.\"  \"It will never be warm any more, nor shall we.\"  All his childhood had gone out of him, all his gleeful, careless, sunny temper had gone with it; he spoke sullenly and wearily, choking down the great sobs in his chest. To him it was as if the end of the world had come.  His sister lingered by him while striving to persuade him to go to his place in the little crowded bedchamber with Albrecht and Waldo and Christof. But it was in vain. \"I shall stay here,\" was all he answered her. And he stayed,--all the night long.                                   V   The lamps went out; the rats came and ran across the floor; as the hours crept on through midnight and past, the cold intensified and the air of the room grew like ice. August did not move; he lay with his face downward on the golden and rainbow-hued pedestal of the household treasure, which henceforth was to be cold for evermore, an exiled thing in a foreign city in a far-off land.  Whilst yet it was dark his three elder brothers came down the stairs and let themselves out, each bearing his lantern and going to his work in stone-yard and timber-yard and at the salt-works. They did not notice him; they did not know what had happened.  A little later his sister came down with a light in her hand to make ready the house ere morning should break.  She stole up to him and laid her hand on his shoulder timidly.  \"Dear August, you must be frozen. August, do look up! do speak!\"  August raised his eyes with a wild, feverish, sullen look in them that she had never seen there. His face was ashen white: his lips were like fire. He had not slept all night; but his passionate sobs had given way to delirious waking dreams and numb senseless trances, which had alternated one on another all through the freezing, lonely, horrible hours.  \"It will never be warm again,\" he muttered, \"never again!\"  Dorothea clasped him with trembling hands.  \"August! do you not know me?\" she cried, in an agony. \"I am Dorothea. Wake up, dear--wake up! It is morning, only so dark!\"  August shuddered all over.  \"The morning!\" he echoed.  He slowly rose up on to his feet.  \"I will go to grandfather,\" he said, very low. \"He is always good: perhaps he could save it.\"  Loud blows with the heavy iron knocker of the house-door drowned his words. A strange voice called aloud through the keyhole,--  \"Let me in! Quick!--there is no time to lose! More snow like this, and the roads will all be blocked. Let me in! Do you hear? I am come to take the great stove.\"  August sprang erect, his fists doubled, his eyes blazing.  \"You shall never touch it!\" he screamed; \"you shall never touch it!\"  \"Who shall prevent us?\" laughed a big man, who was a Bavarian, amused at the fierce little figure fronting him.  \"I!\" said August. \"You shall never have it! you shall kill me first!\"  \"Strehla,\" said the big man, as August's father entered the room, \"you have got a little mad dog here: muzzle him.\"  One way and another they did muzzle him. He fought like a little demon, and hit out right and left, and one of his blows gave the Bavarian a black eye. But he was soon mastered by four grown men, and his father flung him with no light hand out from the door of the back entrance, and the buyers of the stately and beautiful stove set to work to pack it heedfully and carry it away.  When Dorothea stole out to look for August, he was nowhere in sight. She went back to little 'Gilda, who was ailing, and sobbed over the child, whilst the others stood looking on, dimly understanding that with Hirschvogel was going all the warmth of their bodies, all the light of their hearth.  Even their father now was sorry and ashamed; but two hundred florins seemed a big sum to him, and, after all, he thought the children could warm themselves quite as well at the black iron stove in the kitchen. Besides, whether he regretted it now or not, the work of the Nürnberg potter was sold irrevocably, and he had to stand still and see the men from Munich wrap it in manifold wrappings and bear it out into the snowy air to where an ox-cart stood in waiting for it.  In another moment Hirschvogel was gone,--gone forever and aye.  August had stood still for a time, leaning, sick and faint from the violence that had been used to him, against the back wall of the house. The wall looked on a court where a well was, and the backs of other houses,"]]]
