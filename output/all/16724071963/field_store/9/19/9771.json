As no troops were encamped here, the islet had not been cleared at this point, and the jungle was dark and solitary.  The moon was now going down, and straggling shadows began to fall upon the water.  Certainly some one skulked into the bushes!--a rustling in the leaves-- yes! some fellow who has strayed beyond the line of sentries and is afraid to return to camp.  Ha! a boat! a skiff it is--a net and buoys! As I live, 'tis a Mexican craft!--who can have brought it here?  Some fisherman from the coast of Tuspan.  No, he would not venture; it must be--  A strange suspicion flashed across my mind, and I rushed through the mangrove thicket, where I had observed the object a moment before.  I had not proceeded fifty yards when I saw the folly of this movement.  I found myself in the midst of a labyrinth, dark and dismal, surrounded by a wall of leaves and brambles.  The branches of the mangroves, rooted at their tops, barred up the path, and vines laced them together.  \"If they be spies,\" thought I, \"I have taken the worst plan to catch them.  I may as well go through now.  I cannot be distant from the rear of the camp.  Ugh! how dismal!\"  I pushed on, climbing over fallen trunks, and twining myself through the viny cordage.  The creepers clung to my neck--thorns penetrated my skin--the _mezquite_ slapped me in the face, drawing blood.  I laid my hand upon a pendent limb; a clammy object struggled under my touch, with a terrified yet spiteful violence, and, freeing itself, sprang over my shoulder, and scampered off among the fallen leaves.  I felt its fetid breath as the cold scales brushed against my cheek.  It was the hideous iguana.  A huge bat flapped its sail-like wings in my face, and returned again and again, breathing a mephitic odour that caused me to gasp.  Twice I struck at it with my sword, cutting only the empty air.  A third time my blade was caught in the trellis of parasites.  It was horrible; I felt terrified to contend with such strange enemies.  At length, after a continued struggle, an opening appeared before me--a glade; I rushed to the welcome spot.  \"What a relief!\"  I ejaculated, emerging from the leafy darkness. Suddenly I started back with a cry of horror; my limbs refused to act; the sword fell from my grasp, and I stood palsied and transfixed, as if by a bolt from heaven.  Before me, and not over three paces distant, the image of Death himself rose out of the earth, and stretched forth his skeleton arms to clutch me.  It was no phantom.  There was the white, naked skull, with its eyeless sockets, the long, flesh-less limbs, the open, serrated ribs, the long, jointed fingers of Death himself.  As my bewildered brain took in these objects I heard a noise in the bushes as of persons engaged in an angry struggle.  \"Emile, Emile!\" cried a female voice, \"you shall not murder him--you shall not!\"  \"Off! off!--Marie, let me go!\" was shouted in the rough accents of a man.  \"Oh, no!\" continued the female, \"you shall not--no--no--no!\"  \"Curses on the woman!  There, let me go now!\"  There was a sound as of someone struck with violence--a scream--and at the same moment a human figure rushed out of the bushes, and, confronting me, exclaimed: \"Ha!  Monsieur le Capitaine! _coup pour coup_!\"  I heard no more; a heavy blow, descending upon my temples, deprived me of all power, and I fell senseless to the earth.  When I returned to consciousness the first objects I saw were the huge brown whiskers of Lincoln, then Lincoln himself, then the pale face of the boy Jack; and, finally, the forms of several soldiers of my company.  I saw that I was in my own tent and stretched upon my camp-bed.  \"What?--howl--what's the matter!--what's this?\"  I said, raising my hands to the bandage of wet linen that bound my temples.  \"Keep still, Cap'n,\" said Bob, taking my hand from the fillet and placing it by my side.  \"Och! by my sowl, he's over it; thank the Lord for His goodness!\" said Chane, an Irish soldier.  \"Over what? what has happened to me?\"  I inquired.  \"Och, Captin, yer honour, you've been nearly murthered, and all by thim Frinch scoundhrels; bad luck to their dirty frog-atin' picthers!\"  \"Murdered!  French scoundrels!  Bob, what is it?\"  \"Why, yer see, Cap'n, ye've had a cut hyur over the head; and we think it's them Frenchmen.\"  \"Oh!  I remember now; a blow--but the Death?--the Death?\"  I started up from the bed as the phantom of my night adventure returned to my imagination.  \"The Death, Cap'n?--what do yer mean?\" inquired Lincoln, holding me in his strong arms.  \"Oh! the Cap'n manes the skilleton, maybe,\" said Chane.  \"What skeleton?\"  I demanded.  \"Why, an owld skilleton the boys found in the chaparril, yer honner. They hung it to a three; and we found yer honner there, with the skilleton swinging over ye like a sign.  Och! the Frinch bastes!\"  I made no further inquiries about the \"Death.\"  \"But where are the Frenchmen?\" asked I, after a moment.  \"Clane gone, yer honner,\" replied Chane.  \"Gone?\"  \"Yes, Cap'n; that's so as he sez it,\" answered Lincoln.  \"Gone!  What do you mean?\"  I inquired.  \"Desarted, Cap'n.\"  \"How do you know that?\"  \"Because they ain't here.\"  \"On the island?\"  \"Searched it all--every bush.\"  \"But who? which of the French?\"  \"Dubrosc and that 'ar boy that was always with him--both desarted.\"  \"You are sure they are missing?\"  \"Looked high and low, Cap'n.  Gravenitz seed Dubrosc steal into the chaparril with his musket.  Shortly afterwards we heern a shot, but thought nothin' of it till this mornin', when one of the sodgers foun' a Spanish sombrary out thar; and Chane heern some'dy say the shot passed through Major Twing's markey.  Besides, we foun' this butcher-knife where yer was lyin'.\"  Lincoln here held up a species of Mexican sword called a _machete_.  \"Ha!--well.\"  \"That's all, Cap'n; only it's my belief there was Mexicans on this island, and them Frenchmen's gone with them.\"  After Lincoln left me I lay musing on this still somewhat mysterious affair.  My memory, however, gradually grew clearer; and the events of the preceding night soon became linked together, and formed a complete chain.  The shot that passed so near my head in Twing's tent--the boat-- the French words I had heard before I received the blow--and the exclamation, \"_Coup pour coup_!\"--all convinced me that Lincoln's conjectures were right.  Dubrosc had fired the shot and struck the blow that had left me senseless.  But who could the woman be whose voice I had heard pleading in my behalf?  My thoughts reverted to the boy who had gone off with Dubrosc, and whom I had often observed in the company of the latter.  A strange attachment appeared to exist between them, in which the boy seemed to be the devoted slave of the strong fierce Creole.  Could this be a woman?  I recollected having been struck with his delicate features, the softness of his voice, and the smallness of his hands.  There were other points, besides, in the _tournure_ of the boy's figure that had appeared singular to me.  I had frequently observed the eyes of this lad bent upon me, when Dubrosc was not present, with a strange and unaccountable expression.  Many other peculiarities connected with the boy and Dubrosc, which at the time had passed unnoticed and unheeded, now presented themselves to my recollection, all tending to prove the identity of the boy with the woman whose voice I had heard in the thicket.  I could not help smiling at the night's adventures; determined, however, to conceal that part which related to the skeleton.  In a few days my strength was restored.  The cut I had received was not deep--thanks to my forage-cap and the bluntness of the Frenchman's weapon.    CHAPTER SIX.  THE LANDING AT SACRIFICIOS.  Early in the month of March the troops at Lobos were re-embarked, and dropped down to the roadstead of Anton Lizardo.  The American fleet was already at anchor there, and in a few days above a hundred sail of transports had joined it.  There is no city, no village, hardly a habitation upon this half-desert coast.  The aspect is an interminable waste of sandy hills, rendered hirsute and picturesque by the plumed frondage of the palm-tree.  We dared not go ashore, although the smooth white beach tempted us strongly.  A large body of the enemy was encamped behind the adjacent ridges, and patrols could be seen at intervals galloping along the beach.  I could not help fancying what must have been the feeling of the inhabitants in regard to our ships--a strange sight upon this desert coast, and not a pleasing one to them, knowing that within those dark hulls were concealed the hosts of their armed invaders.  Laocoon looked not with more dread upon the huge ribs of the Danaic horse than did the simple peasant of Anahuac upon this fleet of \"oak leviathans\" that lay within so short a distance of his shores.  To us the scene possessed an interest of a far different character.  We looked proudly upon these magnificent models of naval architecture--upon their size, their number, and their admirable adaptation.  We viewed with a changing cheek and kindling eye this noble exhibition of a free people's strength; and as the broad banner of our country swung out upon the breeze of the tropics, we could not help exulting in the glory of that great nation whose uniform we wore around our bodies.  It was no dream.  We saw the burnished cannon and the bright epaulette, the gleaming button and the glancing bayonet.  We heard the startling trumpet, the stirring drum, and the shrill and thrilling fife; and our souls drank in all those glorious sights and sounds that form at once the spirit and the witchery of war.  The landing was to take place on the 9th, and the point of debarkation fixed upon was the beach opposite the island of Sacrificios, just out of range of the guns of Vera Cruz.  The 9th of March rose like a dream, bright, balmy, and beautiful.  The sea was scarcely stirred by the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21241"],["title","The Rifle Rangers (#7)"],["body","breeze of the tropics; but this breeze, light as it was, blew directly in our favour.  At an early hour I observed a strange movement among the ships composing the fleet.  Signals were changing in quick succession, and boats gliding rapidly to and fro.  Before daybreak the huge surf-boats had been drawn down from their moorings, and with long hempen hawsers attached to the ships and steamers.  The descent was about to be made.  The ominous cloud which had hung dark and threatening over the shores of Mexico was about to burst upon that devoted land.  But where?  The enemy could not tell, and were preparing to receive us on the adjacent shore.  The black cylinder began to smoke, and the murky cloud rolled down upon the water, half obscuring the fleet.  Here and there a broad sail, freshly unfurled, hung stiffly from the yard; the canvas, escaping from its gasket fastenings, had not yet been braced round to the breeze.  Soldiers were seen standing along the decks; some in full equipments, clutching the bright barrels of their muskets, while others were buckling on their white belts, or cramming their cartouche-boxes.  Officers, in sash and sword, paced the polished quarter-decks, or talked earnestly in groups, or watched with eager eyes the motions of the various ships.  Unusual sounds were heard on all sides.  The deep-toned chorus of the sailor, the creaking of the capstan, and the clanking of the iron cogs; the \"heave-ho!\" at the windlass, and the grating of the huge anchor-chain, as link after link rasped through the rusty ring--sounds that warned us to make ready for a change.  In the midst of these came the brisk rolling of a drum.  It was answered by another, and another, and still another, until all voices were drowned by the deafening noise.  Then followed the mingling shouts of command, a rushing over the decks, and streams of blue-clad men poured down the dark sides, and seated themselves in the surf-boats.  These were filled in a twinkling, and all was silent as before.  Every voice was hushed in expectation, and every eye bent upon the little black steamer which carried the commander-in-chief.  Suddenly a cloud of smoke rose up from her quarter; a sheet of flame shot out horizontally; and the report of a heavy gun shook the atmosphere like an earthquake.  Before its echoes had subsided, a deafening cheer ran simultaneously through the fleet; and the ships, all together, as if impelled by some hidden and supernatural power, broke from their moorings, and dashed through the water with the velocity of the wind.  Away to the north-west, in an exciting race; away for the island of Sacrificios!  On struggled the ships, bending to the breeze and cleaving the crystal water with their bold bows; on the steamers, beating the blue waves into a milky way, and dragging the laden boats in their foamy track.  On followed the boats through the hissing and frothy caldron.  Loud rolled the drum, loud brayed the bugle, and loud huzzas echoed from the adjacent shores.  Already the foe was alarmed and alert.  Light horsemen with streaming haste galloped up the coast.  Lancers, with gay trappings and long pennons, appeared through the openings of the hills.  Foaming, prancing steeds flew with light artillery over the naked ridges, dashing madly down deep defiles, and crushing the cactus with their whirling wheels. \"Andela!  Andela!\" was their cry.  In vain they urged their horses, in vain they drove the spur deep and bloody into their smoking sides.  The elements were against them, and in favour of their foes.  The earth and the water were their impediments, while the air and the water were the allies of their enemies.  _They_ clung and sweltered through the hot and yielding sand or sank in the marshy borders of the Mandinga and the Medellin, while steam and the wind drove the ships of their adversaries like arrows through the water.  The alarm spread up the coast.  Bugles were sounding, and horsemen galloped through the streets of Vera Cruz.  The alarm-drum beat in the plaza, and the long roll echoed in every _cuartel_.  Signal rockets shot up from San Juan, and were answered by others from Santiago and Concepcion.  Thousands of dark forms clustered upon the roofs of the city and the ramparts of the castle; and thousands of pale lips whispered in accents of terror, \"They come! they come!\"  As yet they knew not how the attack was to be made, or where to look for our descent.  They imagined that we were about to bombard their proud fortress of San Juan, and expected soon to see the ships of these rash invaders shattered and sunk before its walls.  The fleet was almost within long range, the black buoyant hulls bounded fearlessly over the water.  The eager crowd thickened upon the walls. The artillerists of Santiago had gathered around their guns, silent and waiting orders.  Already the burning fuse was sending forth its sulphurous smell, and the dry powder lay temptingly on the touch, when a quick, sharp cry was heard along the walls and battlements, a cry of mingled rage, disappointment, and dismay.  The foremost ship had swerved suddenly from the track; and bearing sharply to the left, under the _manege_ of a skilful helmsman, was running down under the shelter of Sacrificios.  The next ship followed her guide, and the next, and the next; and, before the astonished multitude recovered from their surprise, the whole fleet had come to within pistol-shot of the island!  The enemy now, for the first time, perceived the _ruse_, and began to calculate its results.  Those giant ships, that but a moment ago seemed rushing to destruction, had rounded to at a safe distance, and were preparing, with the speed and skilfulness of a perfect discipline, to pour a hostile host upon the defenceless shores.  In vain the cavalry bugle called their horsemen to the saddle; in vain the artillery car rattled along the streets; both would be too late!  Meanwhile, the ships let fall their anchors, with a plunge, and a rasping, and a rattle.  The sails came down upon the yards; and sailors swung themselves into the great surf-boats, and mixed with the soldiers, and seized the oars.  Then the blades were suddenly and simultaneously dropped on the surface of the wave, a naval officer in each boat directing the movements of the oarsmen.  And the boats pulled out nearer, and by an echelon movement took their places in line.  Light ships of war were thrown upon our flanks, to cover the descent by a cross fire.  No enemy had yet appeared, and all eyes were turned landward with fiery expectation.  Bounding hearts waited impatiently for the signal.  The report of a single gun was at length heard from the ship of the commander-in-chief; and, as if by one impulse, a thousand oars struck the water, and flung up the spray upon their broad blades.  A hundred boats leaped forward simultaneously.  The powerful stroke was repeated, and propelled them with lightning speed.  Now was the exciting race, the regatta of war!  The Dardan rowers would have been distanced here.  On! on! with the velocity of the wind, over the blue waves, through the snowy surf--on!  And now we neared the shore, and officers sprang to their feet, and stood with their swords drawn; and soldiers half sat, half crouched, clutching their muskets.  And the keels gritted upon the gravelly bed; and, at the signal, a thousand men, in one plunge, flung themselves into the water, and dashed madly through the surf.  Thousands followed, holding their cartridge-boxes breast-high; and blades were glancing, and bayonets gleaming, and banners waving; and under glancing blades, and gleaming bayonets, and waving banners, the dark mass rushed high upon the beach.  Then came a cheer, loud, long, and exulting.  It pealed along the whole line, uttered from five thousand throats, and answered by twice that number from the anchored ships.  It echoed along the shores, and back from the distant battlements.  A colour-sergeant, springing forward, rushed up the steep sides of a sand-hill, and planted his flag upon its snowy ridge.  As the well-known banner swung out upon the breeze, another cheer, wild and thrilling, ran along the line; a hundred answering flags were hauled up through the fleet; the ships of war saluted with full broadsides; and the guns of San Juan, now for the first time waking from their lethargic silence, poured forth their loudest thunder.  The sun was just setting as our column commenced its advance inward. After winding for a short distance through the defiles of the sand-hills, we halted for the night, our left wing resting upon the beach.  The soldiers bivouacked without tents--sleeping upon their arms, with the soft sand for their couch and the cartridge-box for their pillow.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note.  Cuartel is the quarter of the city.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  THE CITY OF THE TRUE CROSS.  Vera Cruz is a fortified city.  Round and round it is girt by a wall, with regular batteries placed at intervals.  You enter it from the land side by three gates (_garitas_), and from the sea by a beautiful pier or mole that projects some distance into the water.  The latter is a modern construction; and when the sun is descending behind the Mexican Cordilleras to the west, and the breeze blows in from the Gulf, this mole--the seat of but little commercial activity--becomes the favourite promenade of the dark-eyed Vera-Cruzanas and their pallid lovers.  The city stands on the very beach.  The sea at full tide washes its battlements, and many of the houses overlook the water.  On almost every side a plain of sand extends to a mile's distance from the walls, where it terminates in those lofty white sand-ridges that form a feature of the shores of the Mexican Gulf.  During high tides and \"northers\" the sea washes over the surrounding sand-plain, and Vera Cruz appears almost isolated amid the waves.  On one side, however, towards the south, there is"]]]
