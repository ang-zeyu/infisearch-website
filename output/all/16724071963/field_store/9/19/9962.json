The two young men sail as supercargoes, a post which at that time existed, but which later was to be known a ship's clerk.  The job of a supercargo was to be in charge of where in the vessel each item of cargo was stored, so that on arrival at its destination it could be quickly and easily found.  Of course in those days, as fifty years ago, items of cargo were individual small objects, sometimes stowed on pallets, but mostly in casks.  A pallet or a cask would be an individual item.  It wasn't very easy to read this text due to a slightly heavy typeface, so there may be a few errors, but not, we hope, over the 99.95% odds.  Probably best for that reason as an audiobook.  ________________________________________________________________________  THE TWO SUPERCARGOES, ADVENTURES IN SAVAGE AFRICA, BY W.H.G. KINGSTON.  Adventures in Savage Africa.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE OFFICE OF FRANK, TRUNNION & SWAB--HARRY BRACEWELL REPORTS THE ARRIVAL OF THE \"ARROW\"--HISTORY OF NICHOLAS SWAB--THE SLAVE TRADE--OUR FIRM GIVES UP ALL CONNECTION WITH IT--CAPTAIN RODERICK TRUNNION-- SOMETHING ABOUT MYSELF AND FRIENDS--INTERVIEW BETWEEN MR. TRUNNION AND GODFREY MAGOR, MATE OF THE \"ARROW\"--AN UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL--A STRANGE ACCUSATION--SUSPICIONS OF CAPTAIN TRUNNION--MRS. BRACEWELL AND HER DAUGHTER MARY.  \"The `Arrow' has come in, sir, from the Coast of Africa, under charge of Mr Godfrey Magor, the second mate,\" I heard Harry Bracewell, one of our shipping clerks, say, as I was seated on a high stool, pen in hand, leaning over my desk in the office of Messrs. Crank, Trunnion & Swab, general merchants, of Liverpool Harry addressed the senior partner, Mr Peter Crank, who had just then stepped out of his private room with a bundle of papers in his hand into the counting-house, where I, with a dozen other clerks, senior and junior, were driving our quills as fast as we could move them over the paper, or adding up columns of figures, or making calculations, as the case might be.  As I turned my head slightly, I could see both Mr Crank and Harry. They afforded a strange contrast.  Harry was tall, well-built, had a handsome countenance, with a pleasant expression which betokened his real character, for he was as kind, honest, and generous a young fellow as ever lived--the only son of his mother, the widow of a naval officer killed in action.  She had come to Liverpool for the sake of giving a home to Harry, who had been for some time in the employment of the firm. The difference between Mr Crank and Harry was indeed most conspicuous in their personal appearance.  Whereas Harry was tall, Mr Crank was short and stout; he had a bald head, shining as if it had been carefully polished, a round face, with a florid complexion, and a nose which was allowed by his warmest friends to be a snub; but he had a good mouth, bright blue eyes, often twinkling with humour, which seemed to look through and through those he addressed, while his brow exhibited a considerable amount of intellect.  Had not he possessed that, he would not have been at the head of the firm of Crank, Trunnion & Swab.  \"Brought home, did you say, by Godfrey Magor?  What has happened to Captain Rig and the first mate?\"  \"Both died from fever while up the Nunn, as did all hands except himself and three others.  So Mr Magor told me; and the survivors were all so weak, that he could not have brought the vessel home had he not shipped six Kroomen.  He had also a narrow escape from pirates, who actually boarded his vessel, when a man-of-war heaving in sight, they made off without plundering her or killing any one.\"  \"Bless my heart!  I'm sorry to hear about Captain Rig's death.  The poor man remained longer up the river than he should have done, no doubt about that I have over and over again charged the masters of our vessels to be careful in that respect, but they won't attend to what I say.  Let me see! that makes the fifth who has lost his life during the last two years.  I'm thankful he got clear of the pirates.  Those rascals have long been the greatest pests on that coast.  It is time the British Government should take effectual steps to put a stop to their depredations by sending a squadron into those seas.  Have you brought the manifest and the other papers with you?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Harry, producing them.  \"Mr Magor will be on shore himself in an hour or two, when he has seen the vessel made snug, for he has no one to leave in charge; he himself is still suffering from the fever, and two of her white crew are in their bunks.\"  Mr Crank, taking the documents, retired with them into his room, to run his eye over the list of articles brought by the \"Arrow,\" and to calculate their present market value.  The result I know was satisfactory.  I had afterwards to note down the prices which they fetched.  Merchants who could make so large a percentage on all their cargoes were certain to grow rich.  It was at the cost, however, of the lives of a great number of human beings; but that was not my employers' look out, nor did they allow the matter to trouble their consciences. They could always obtain fresh masters to take charge of their vessels, and fresh crews to man them.  In a short time Mr Trunnion, who had heard on 'Change of the arrival of the \"Arrow,\" came in to learn what news she had brought, expecting to find her master, who was wont, immediately he came on shore, to put in an appearance at the office.  Mr Trunnion expressed himself much shocked at Captain Rig's death.  \"Poor fellow! he used to boast that he was acclimatised, but it is a proof of the old adage, `that the pitcher which goes often to the well gets broken at last.'  We might have lost a worse man;\" and with this remark Mr Trunnion passed into his room, in which he sat to receive visitors on private business.  Mr Trunnion, although the second partner, was the youngest in the firm. He was a good-looking, urbane, well-mannered man, who, if not always loved by those under him, was much liked and respected in the social circle in which he moved, he being also one of the magnates of Liverpool.  For my own part, I had reason to like and be grateful to Mr Swab, the junior member of the firm.  He had formerly been a clerk in the house, but by diligent attention to and a thorough knowledge of business and strict honesty, he had some years before been made a partner.  To him I felt that I owed all the knowledge I possessed of commercial affairs, as from my first entrance into the office he took notice of me, and gave me the instruction I so much required.  My chief friend was Harry Bracewell, who was also a favourite with Mr Swab, and had received the same instruction from him that I had obtained.  Mr Swab was not at all ashamed of his origin.  He used to tell us that he had risen, not from the gutter, but from the mud, like other strange animals, having obtained his livelihood in his early days by hunting at low tide for whatever he could pick up along the shore, thrown overboard from the lighters or similar vessels unloading at the quays.  At length it was his good fortune to pick a purse out of the mud containing ten golden guineas, and, as he used to tell us, being convinced that he should never have a find like it, he resolved to quit his occupation, for which he had no particular fancy, and endeavour to obtain a situation where he might have a prospect of rising in the world.  Though he could neither read nor write, he was well aware that those acquirements were necessary for his advancement, as also that a decent suit of clothes would greatly contribute to his obtaining a respectable place.  These objects were now within his reach.  The most easily attained was the suit of clothes, and these he bought, with a cap and a good pair of shoes, at a slopseller's, including three shirts, a necktie, and other articles of clothing, for the moderate sum of 2 pounds, 13 shillings and 6 pence.  He had taken good care not to let the slopseller know of his wealth; indeed, that fact he kept locked in his own bosom, as he did his purse in a place in which no one was likely to discover it.  The balance of the ten pounds into which he had broken he expended in supporting himself while he acquired the first rudiments of knowledge, with the aid of a friend, the keeper of a second-hand bookstall, a broken-down schoolmaster, who, strange to say, still retained a pleasure in imparting instruction to the young.  Nicholas Swab first bought a spelling-book, and then confessed that he should find it of no use unless Mr Vellum would explain to him the meaning of the black marks on the pages.  \"Then you do not know your letters, my poor boy?\" said the old man in a tone of commiseration.  \"No, sir, I don't; but I soon will, if you'll tell them to me,\" answered Nicholas in a confident tone.  \"Sit down on that stool, and say them after me as I point them out to you,\" said Mr Vellum.  With great patience he went over the alphabet again and again.  \"Now I want to put them together, sir,\" said Nicholas, not content with the extent of the first lesson.  All day long he sat with the book before him, and then took it with him to his home.  That home, the abode of his mother, a widow, with a pension of five shillings a week, which enabled her to live, although too small to afford subsistence to her son, was in a small garret up a dark stair in one of the poorest of the back streets of Liverpool.  Nicholas set working away by the flame of a farthing rushlight, and at dawn he was up again poring over his book.  Old Vellum was so pleased with the progress made by his pupil, that he continued to give him all the assistance in his power, not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21490"],["title","The Two Supercargoes; Or, Adventures in Savage Africa (#1)"],["body"," teaching him to read but to write.  In a few weeks young Nicholas could do both in a very creditable manner.  Having thus gained the knowledge he desired, dressed in a decent suit of clothes, he went round to various offices in Liverpool offering to fill any vacant situation for which he might be considered fit.  Although he met with numerous rebuffs, he persevered, and was finally taken into the small counting-house of which Mr Peter Crank's father was the head.  To the firm, through all its various changes, he had remained attached, and though frequently offered opportunities of bettering himself, had refused to leave it.  \"No, no; I'll stick to my old friends,\" he always answered; \"their interests are mine, and although I am but a poor clerk, I believe I can forward them.\"  From the first, during all his leisure moments, of which he had not many, he continued to study hard, and to improve himself, spending a portion of his wages in books, which he obtained from Mr Vellum, who allowed him also the run of his library.  He was raised from grade to grade until he became head clerk, and during the illness of Mr Crank and the absence of Mr Trunnion, he so well managed the affairs of the firm, that they felt bound to offer him a partnership in the business, to the success of which he had so greatly contributed.  Notwithstanding his rise in the social circle, Nicholas Swab continued to be the same unostentatious, persevering, painstaking man which he had been from the first--upright in all his dealings, and generous to those who required a helping hand.  Some of the transactions of the firm would not, it must be confessed, stand the test of the present code of morality.  The slave trade had, until lately, been lawful, and the firm had engaged in it with as little hesitation as it would in any other mercantile business.  It had been in the habit of buying negroes in the cheapest market, and disposing of them in the dearest, without for a moment considering how they were obtained.  When the traffic was pronounced illegal, it withdrew its own vessels, but still had no hesitation in supplying the means for fitting out others which it knew were about to proceed to the African coast, although no particular inquiries were made on the subject.  It was not very long before the time of which I speak that the fact dawned on the minds of the partners that the traffic was hateful in the sight of God, as well as in that of a large number of their countrymen, and that it was the main cause of the cruel wars and miseries unspeakable from which the dark-skinned children of Africa had long suffered.  Being really conscientious men, they had agreed to abandon all connection with the traffic, and to employ their vessels in carrying on a lawful trade on the coast.  To do this, however, was not at first so easy as might be supposed.  One of the vessels especially, which they had contributed to fit out and to supply with goods, although not belonging to them, was commanded by Mr Trunnion's brother--a Captain Roderick Trunnion, of whose character I had heard from time to time mysterious hints thrown out not much to his credit.  He occasionally made his appearance at Liverpool.  He seemed to me to be a fine, bold, dashing fellow, ready to do and dare anything he might think fit.  He was like several privateer captains I had met with, who set their own lives and those of their followers at slight value, provided they could carry out their undertakings.  He gave, I believe, his brother, Mr Thomas Trunnion, the partner in our firm, considerable cause for anxiety and annoyance.  The last time he had been on shore, in order to recover his brother's confidence he endeavoured to make himself agreeable to the other partners.  Mr Swab, however, I know, did not trust him, as he privately told Harry Bracewell on one occasion.  \"And don't you,\" he added; \"he is without principles; he always did what he chose regardless of God or man.  And he doesn't believe in God, or that any man has a grain of honesty, nor does he, except when it suits him, boast of having any himself.\"  Captain Trunnion, however, appeared to have insinuated himself into the good graces of our senior partner, at whose house he was a frequent visitor.  He had a strong attraction there; for Lucy, Mr Crank's, only child, was a sweet, amiable, pretty girl, and Captain Trunnion believed that, could he win her, he should not only obtain a charming wife, but become possessed, some day or other, of Mr Crank's property.  Which influenced him most I cannot say.  All I know is, that he did not make any progress in the affections of Miss Lucy, for a very good reason, which he was not long in suspecting--that she had already given her heart to some one else.  That some one was my friend Harry Bracewell Captain Trunnion had, however, gone away without suspecting who was his rival.  My father and mother resided in Chester, so that I was received into the house, as a lodger, of Mrs Bracewell; thus it was that I became more intimate with Harry than I might otherwise have been.  I also had an opportunity of being constantly in the society of the widow's only daughter, Mary--a charming little unaffected girl, full of life and spirits, who treated me as her brother's friend, almost like a brother. For a long time I also thought only of her as a sister, although, somehow or other, I began at last to entertain the hope that, when I had by steady industry obtained the means of making her my wife, she would not feel it necessary to refuse me; and as my family was a respectable one, I had no reason to fear that any objection would be raised by Mrs Bracewell or Harry.  Of my own family I need not speak, except of one member--my brother Charley, who had gone to sea before I entered the office, and was now a midshipman of some years' standing.  He had lately joined the \"Rover\" frigate, employed on the African station.  Charley and I had been fast friends and companions, as brothers should be, when we were together, and when separated we constantly corresponded with each other.  I cannot say that I had any special fondness for mercantile pursuits, or at all events for the work of an office, having to sit for ten or twelve hours of the day on a high stool at a desk, but yet I was thoroughly impressed with the fact that I must gain my own livelihood, and that by working hard alone could I expect to do so.  Had the choice been given me, I should have preferred a life in the open air, with the opportunity of travelling about and seeing the world; but my father did not wish to have more than one son in the navy, and Charley had been devoted as an offering to Neptune.  I was, however, very happy in my situation.  Understanding what I was to do, I took a pleasure in doing it well; and I spent my evenings happily in the society of Mrs Bracewell and her son and daughter.  We had generally music and singing, now and then two or three visitors.  Occasionally we went out to Mr Crank's parties and those of other friends, so that our lives were in no respects dull.  I enter into these details in order that more interest may be taken in the rest of my narrative than might otherwise have been the case.  About an hour after Harry had reported the arrival of the vessel, as I was engaged in Mr Trunnion's private room in taking down letters at his dictation, the mate of the \"Arrow\" was announced.  As Mr Crank was out, Mr Trunnion desired him to come in and give an account of his voyage. As I was not desired to quit the room, I continued transcribing the notes which I had taken down, but I glanced round at the mate as he entered.  His appearance showed that he had suffered from the fever which had carried off so many of his shipmates.  His cheek was pale and hollow, his eye dull, and his figure emaciated; even his voice sounded weak and hollow.  \"Sit down,\" said Mr Trunnion in a kind voice, showing that he was struck by the sickly look of the poor mate.  \"I should like to hear full particulars of your voyage.  It has been a successful one judging by the manifest, which I have been looking over, although fatal to so many long in our employment.  You have managed well, too, in bringing home the `Arrow.'  We are well satisfied--I can tell you that at once.\"  The mate then began an account of the transactions connected with the vessel from the time of her arrival on the Coast of Africa, the number of places visited, and the trade transactions at each.  They were very interesting to me I know at the time, but I did not note them.  Mr Magor then described how one after the other the captain and crew died, until he and three others were alone left.  \"I doubted indeed whether I should have been able to bring the vessel home,\" he continued.  \"We had a narrow escape of being captured by a picarooning craft which swept alongside us during a calm.  A number of the crew, headed by their captain, had actually made their way on board, and having bound me and three of my men, were proceeding to get off the hatches to take the cargo out of the hold, when a man-of-war, bringing up a strong breeze from the south, hove in sight.  The pirates on discovering her hurried on board their own craft, carrying away two of my Kroomen, and casting off the grapplings with which they had made her fast alongside, got out their long sweeps and pulled away for their lives.  As soon as the remaining Kroomen had set me and the other white men free, we ran out our guns and began firing at her.  She returned our shot; and as she had more guns and heavier metal than ours, we judged it prudent not to follow her.  When the breeze came, which it did soon afterwards, she stood away under all sail before the wind.  She showed that she was a fast craft, for she had almost got out of sight before the man-of-war came up with us.  The latter pursued her, but whether she was overtaken or not I cannot say, as we continued our voyage towards England, and I saw no more of either"]]]
