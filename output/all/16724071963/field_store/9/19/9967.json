Common also are posters of Constantine as St. George, and the Venizelist administration as a three-headed dragon of which Venizelos is the chief and certainly most loathly head.  Venizelos has become violently distasteful to the people--though possibly he may return to power by as violent a reaction.  The chief reason for his fall was that he offended Greek national pride by being the puppet of the Allies. The revolution which he accomplished at the instigation of the French was highly resented.  And all the mortification of the French contempt for Greece was vented upon him.  Although Greece won such a goodly share of the booty of the war, she was treated throughout the war with a brutal nonchalance.  Venizelos had much respect, but Greece had none. A comparison is often made between the machinations of the Allies in Petrograd in 1917 for the deposing of the Tsar, and the intrigues which forced Constantine to flee.  Venizelos nevertheless was one of the cleverest statesmen of Europe--granted one can be clever and not wise at the same time--clever and even stupid, his chief weakness being a crude violence of temperament which breaks out in his speeches:  On vient de vous dire, s'écria-t-il, qu'il n'y avait pas de germanophiles an Grèce.  Cela est vrai pour le peuple, pour les homines politiques de tous les partis en grande majorité.  Moi-même je viens de l'attester à la conference de Londres.  Mais cela n'est vrai du roi, ni de son entourage.  Ceux-la ne sont pas seulement germanophiles.  Ils sont Boches de la tête aux pieds! . . .   The good order, the low cost of living, the high value of the drachma, the excellent condition of the army, the enhanced prestige of the Greek nation after the war, all testify to the ability of Venizelos. Venizelos won for Hellas territory which extends from Salonica all the way to the Black Sea, and brought her almost to the gates of Constantinople.  The role of neutrality which King Constantine affected would have left Greece without the coveted war-glory, and, of course, without the dangerous responsibility she has now.  Thanks to Venizelos, Greece is almost an empire.  And the Greeks are glad to have this extra sway.  No sentiment has stood in the way of Constantine's Government retaining what its arch-enemy had won.  \"We may fall out in politics, but where our material interests are concerned you will find complete solidarity,\" said an Athenian journalist.  And it seems true.  Not many signs of altruism are visible in Greece.  There are few Germanophiles.  \"Do not fear for us,\" said M. Kalogeropoulos, to the French.  \"Greece will not ally herself to a corpse\"--meaning Germany. In fact, there is among the Greeks only Graecophilism.  If superlative and clamorous love of country is a virtue--they have it.  For Greece, when you are down, you are down.  As for fallen Germany, so for Russia in her humiliation Greece has no extra thought or care.  Not a humanitarian and philanthropic nation!  One wonders how a Greek mind would interpret the \"big-brother-love\" of the Americans, which prompts the marvellous rescue-work now being done by the United States in all the stricken countries of Europe.  There, however, the indolence of the Greek mind and the half-closed eye intervene.  There is no curiosity about philanthropy.  But it is a Greek word by origin.  One longs to see some sort of love towards the neighbour.  There is a mortal enmity towards the Bulgar, a cool reciprocity of Italian dislike, a non-comprehension of the Serb, traditional hatred of the Turk--all these are intensified by egoism.  New Greece, with her hazardous northern frontier, needs to cultivate friendship, and will have to employ all her strategy to gain any.  Her mainstay is, of course, England.  For us Greece has the natural respect which a weak country pays to a strong friend, but she has also a curious covert regard for us as one nation of sailors for another, a petty maritime State for a great one.  Her weakness is in asking material favours at the same time as she pays compliments.  Greece is almost our ally in the Near East.  French rivalry has bound British and Greeks together. In our employ are Greeks; in the French employ, Turks.  There is no question but our employees are the cleverer and the more capable, but there is a continual clash on psychological grounds.  The Greeks make mistakes and the British are not ready to make allowances.  The Englishman demands that his friend shall be a \"sportsman\"--the Turk is, the Greek is not.  Therefore we cannot fit Greece into the jig-saw puzzle which we call the comity of nations.  The question is, can Greece cut herself to fit--ought she to?  It is strange to come into the martial display of Athens and find the old war still going on, see the numbers of worn soldiers weighed down with all the impedimenta of \"fighting order\" coming home on leave or returning to the front, to see the Turkish prisoners of war jobbing at the station and on the streets, to see the handsome Evzones, the soldiers of the King's bodyguard, strutting together in fine style along the cobbled roadway.  It is impressive, and shows Greece in a new light.  Then the Constituent Assembly with its new Turkish members in their fezes rather takes the eye as a novel synthesis of political interest in the Near East.  Athens is a great capital where much that is vital in the future of Europe is at stake.  It stands somewhat aside from the general misery of Europe, and for that reason more perhaps can be seen.  Not that Greece has not its poor--its appalling beggars, its miserable war-cripples, its refugees.  An extensive strike was in progress in February; it had to be settled by a threat of mobilization.  \"Any workman not in his place on Monday morning will be called up for the next draft to Asia Minor\" proved an effectual way of meeting demands for higher pay.  Of the refugees, pity is first awakened for the Russians.  Just outside the city of Athens, in old barracks, lie the survivors of the tuberculosis hospitals evacuated from the Crimea--pale and haggard as death--strange wisps of humanity, attended by devoted Russian doctors and nurses; but fed on the scantiest of dry army rations, short of medicine and comfort of all kinds.  One ward of dying women with staring eyes, an unforgettable impression!  Whilst in Greece, every Englishman should visit our cemeteries in Macedonia, and realize that we planted many thousands of our people like seeds of a kind in this Grecian soil--that a flower of freedom might grow.  On a wind-blown moor, in sight of Mt. Olympus and the sea, ranges one regular array of British crosses--now of wood, but presently to be of marble, with a stone of remembrance in their midst.  It will be done well, in the British way.  Even the dead might be pleased by what is being done.  But here is a strange phenomenon which seems to make a mockery of our sacrifice.  Around this wonderful burying ground are growing up a miscellany of alien crosses, of all shapes and sizes, stuck in ugly heaps of upturned earth.  Every day a pit is dug and the dead-cart arrives.  There is no service, no ceremony.  But forty or fifty nearly naked bodies of women and children are shot into the pit and covered over hastily and a cross put over them.  They are Russians, the so-called Russian Greeks evacuated from the Caucasus last year, now stricken with typhus and almost famished to death, some 12,000 of them in old army huts, living promiscuously together and attended by one desperate doctor and a few devoted sisters.  Europe is heaping her dead around us.  This truly is not near Athens, but above the ruined ramshackle port of Salonica, once a fair city, but now facing the sea with almost a mile of fire-devastated streets.  The refugees are confined to their huts, and are under a sort of military control.  All the people are proletariat, and ought never to have been taken on board ships and brought to Greece.  A few would have been killed by Bolsheviks, but not so many as will die here by disease.  They cannot help Russia outside of Russia, and it is beyond belief that little countries can look after them indefinitely.  It is pathetic to look into their huts, strung from wall to wall with crusts of bread, the floors multitudinous with people and especially with children; every serious person engaged in the hopeless task of destroying the lice.  Even if these people were at once put on transports and taken to Russia half of their number would be destined to death.  The Russian scenes and episodes in Greece foreshadow the immense tragedy to be witnessed in Constantinople and on Gallipoli and at Lemnos.  What touches the heart at Athens will ravage the whole being at Constantinople.  But of that anon.  An episode at Athens on the day of arrival had a spice of novelty in it which soon dulled on the palate in a rapidity of repetition:  It is Sunday afternoon, and on the pavement of a quiet street stands a mute and gloomy man with an armful of what appears to be paper-money. He is holding it out in his two hands.  Impossible that it should be money!  But it is.  He is holding about half a million roubles in his hands.  Yes, they are for sale.  This for so much, this other for so much.  \"I am sorry I have no Greek money, but please take five liras Italian and give it to your comrades.  You must be very poor.\"  A smile appeared on the man's face.  \"But you'll take some roubles,\" said he.  \"Well, if you like, just a small note for remembrance.  It doesn't matter what.\"  \"Here's ten thousand roubles!\"  And he handed out a handsome new note for that amount.  It fluttered from his hand to the pavement and was caught on the wind.  \"Pick it up quickly!  It's ten thousand roubles,\" one wished to cry anxiously to the passer-by.  Only ten thousand!  And for something less than sixpence!  \"Europe won't get right before the Russian business"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21499"],["title","Europe—Whither Bound? (#2)"],["body","straightened out,\" said an American commercial traveller at the hotel.  He, for his part, was engaged in the profitless task of disposing of large margins of goods at fifty per cent below cost of production whilst the leisurely, crafty Greeks kept him waiting from day to day in the expectation of getting another ten per cent reduction.  \"The whole world's out of gear,\" said the American in disgust.  \"The war and the Russian revolution are the cause.  They have ruined the meaning of money.\"  I was to find his words true to this extent that at every capital the European problem proved to be inextricably involved in the Russian problem also.     EXTRA LEAVES  (i) _On Passports and \"Circulation\"_  Mr. H. G. Wells, in \"The Salvaging of Civilization,\" has very pleasantly contrasted the States of America with the States of Europe--the Disunited States.  America, where you can travel by through trains without showing passports, without customs-barriers, without change of currency and without police-inquisition; America where there is a free interchange of peoples and opinions, Europe lying in unexampled obstruction and stagnation; America with its cheap post and universally-used telephone service, Europe with its expensive, ill-managed posts and local and limited and expensive and contumacious telephone.  At the time of writing you can send a letter from San Francisco to London for less than it costs to send a similar letter from one London suburb to another.  In America you have inter-state telephone service, you have the constant extension of an elaborate and efficient system, whilst on our side of the water we intelligent Europeans are asking to have the apparatus removed as a hindrance and a failure.  Passports, railway-service, post, telephone, currency--all these may fittingly be considered as aspects of one vital matter, namely, circulation.  All living organic unity is dependent on circulation.  As the health of the human body is dependent on an unobstructed circulation of the blood, of the lymph, of the air, so the health of a nation or a state or a group of states is dependent on the free circulation of peoples, goods, opinions, money, and what not.  A bad circulation results in \"pins and needles,\" and we Europeans have so inverted common sense as to indulge habitually in a policy of pin-pricks.  A bad circulation results in cold feet, in local stagnation, in lethargy.  No circulation results in death.  It means    to die, and go we know not where,   To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot.   It may almost be said that Shakespeare's formula for death describes Europe--she goes she knows not where, she lies in cold obstruction and she rots.  In reality it is not quite so bad as that.  Though there is local paralysis of an alarming kind, there is also a sluggish circulation. How impeded that circulation is let the traveller judge.  In January, 1921, I took a general passport for Europe.  The British passport office facilitated my struggles.  For I am a well-known struggler there and am now excused the preliminary heats.  I spent a week getting visas in London.  I remembered his Excellency of Greece had changed his address.  When the taxi-driver had located his new office in Great Tower Street we found that he was having a holiday, celebrating New Year's Day in orthodox Greek style about the fourteenth of the month.  I returned in a few days' time and his Excellency was celebrating Epiphany.  Next time I resolved to take a precautionary twenty minutes at the telephone and find out whether there were any other festivals on.  The Poles, I remember, asked for answers to questions on two sheets of foolscap and charged thirty shillings for a visa that went out of date before I could get to their country.  His Excellency of Bulgaria I made several trips to Kensington to find, and I gave him up as apparently non-existent.  With the representatives of Latvia I had a troublous conversation and finally obtained another useless visa for forty shillings.  The Germans would not give a visa as I was entering Germany from the other side of Europe.  I spent about ten pounds in London merely for the application of rubber stamps and Consuls' signatures.  In the course of my travels that passport became an appalling wilderness of visas and remarks climbing out of their legitimate spaces to get mixed up with wife's signature and the colour of the hair.  The most flattering of these remarks is no doubt that affixed at Sofia station--\"Not dangerous to society.\"  But I had to show that passport not only to the police and the military of all nations, but also before entering the gambling halls of Monte Carlo on the one hand and before entering the gates of the Cathedral of Sancta Sophia at Constantinople on the other.  One of the worst places is Vintimiglia on the Franco-Italian line.  The French frank you out of their country; the Italians frank you in.  You step into a separate chamber and are searched and asked particular and impertinent questions.  Before leaving Italy the Italian police demand your personal attendance and take a small due.  In some countries you are required to obtain police permission to leave the country; in some not.  No one tells you what you have to do.  You can take a ticket and proceed gaily to the frontier and then be turned back.  This can happen even in the enlightened State of Czechoslovakia.  Greece, however, is one of the worst international offenders in this matter.  The traveller has to spend a morning with the police, and he may be held up for some days if Church Festivals intervene.  If he goes to the frontier without the police stamp on his passport he gets sent back.  Two examples of how this lack of international manners works out I append: A German officer captured by the Russians in 1915, was sent to Siberia, escaped and got somehow down to Tashkent, the ex-capital of Russian Central Asia, struggled out of Asia and through Asia Minor in an utterly indigent condition, and this year stowed away on a Greek ship and got to Athens.  So great was the interest in his case that a subscription was made for him publicly, and he was given a first-class ticket to Berlin, and a place in the sleeping car was reserved.  Incredible as it may seem, he was turned off the express at midnight at Ghevgeli and returned to Salonica by slow train because his passport had not the Greek police visa.  Of course he lost his sleeping-car accommodation and resumed his journey homewards by ordinary trains.  Another case was that of a young Roumanian returning from the Far East after endless vicissitudes in the Koltchak and Bolshevik adventures.  He also was turned off and had to go to Salonica to visit the police.  However, the British authorities could not throw stones at the Greeks. It would be unwise.  Constantinople under British domination is one of the worst places of obstruction in Europe.  You need a military pass to get in; you need a good deal more than that to get out.  The Australian Colonel in charge of the work going on at the Dardanelles gave me a letter to G.H.Q. Constantinople, asking D.M.I. (we still talk of D.M.I.'s) to put my passport through quickly.  Here I was met by one of those drawling incapables who make England loathed on the Continent. \"I--don't--really--see,\" says he, and pauses, and looks at my weather-beaten cap and tramping boots--\"I don't really see----\" Inability is a guiding sign of the administration.  I went to the Allied Passport Bureau, British Section, where a tippable man was keeping a queue of all the rabble of the East, and I was to come tomorrow morning.  When the British section had given the visa I went to the French, then to the Italians.  One loses one's patience, being kept waiting so long, and one breaks into a room sometimes before one is asked.  It was so with the Italians.  I stepped suddenly into the room of the man who had to initial my pass, and he was tenderly embracing a charming brunette.  He signed tacitly and rapidly and I was gone. . . .  After the Italians you seek out the Greeks who are in an entirely different district.  Outside the Consulate is a string of photographers with cameras and ricketty chairs.  The Greeks require photographs--you sit down on a chair on the open roadway, and in a quarter of an hour you have a sheaf of wet pictures of yourself by which it certainly would be hard to recognize you.  Inside the Greek Consulate rages a terrific hurly-burly.  You wait and perspire in a vapour of garlic. . . .  Then for the Bulgars.  The Bulgars have certainly hit on a novelty.  The rubber stamp is applied to your passport in one office and the date is written but the visa has to be signed in another office a mile away.  Are we then through with everything?  No.  The Orient Express requires a doctor's certificate that you are free from vermin and infection.  For this the doctors naturally charge a heavy fee.  For my part I refused to see a doctor and carried the matter off with a high hand at the railway station, where they put me down as \"officer in mufti.\"  Apparently officers are exempted from all this.  It is only if you happen to be one of the ordinary dirty and despised free citizens of Europe and not a member of any Commission or Red Cross or Y.M.C.A., or military unit--that you go through all this.  Europe for the man in uniform!  So useful is the military uniform that some civilians carry their ex-khaki attire in an extra suit-case and put it on when they want to get along.  I met an Englishman, ex-officer, in this get-up in the Serbian Constituent Assembly.  He could beard whom he liked in Jugo-Slavia clad in an old uniform with ribbons.  I heard of another in Austria who was arrested at the chief station in Vienna, having four millions of Austrian crowns on his person.  Austrian crowns are worth much more in London than in Vienna, and it is illegal to take large quantities out of the country.  But an observant speculator had concluded that"]]]
