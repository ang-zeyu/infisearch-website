[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21236"],["title","The Boy Hunters (#3)"],["body"," was still another motive that influenced him--perhaps the most powerful of all.  He was inspired by the pride of the naturalist.  He thought of the triumph he would obtain by sending such a rare contribution to the great museum of Europe.  If ever, my young reader, you should become a naturalist, you will comprehend how strong this feeling may be; and with our hunter-naturalist it was so.  At first he proposed that Hugot should accompany them.  This the boys would not hear of, and all three stoutly opposed it.  They could not think of taking Hugot--their father would require Hugot at home--Hugot would be of no use to them, they said.  They would do as well, if not better, without him.  The truth was, that these ambitious young hunters did not wish to be robbed of any part of the credit of their enterprise--which they knew would be the case if Hugot were to accompany them.  Not that Hugot was by any means a noted hunter--quite the contrary--nor a warrior neither, notwithstanding he had been a _chasseur a cheval_, and wore such fierce moustachios.  All this his old Colonel knew very well; and therefore did not much insist upon sending Hugot with them.  Hugot's talents shone best in another sphere of action--in the _cuisine_.  There Hugot was at home, for he could compound an omelette, fricassee a chicken, or dress a _canard aux olives_, with Monsieur Soyer himself.  But Hugot--although for many years he had accompanied his old and young masters in the chase--had no taste whatever for hunting.  He had a wholesome dread of bears and panthers, and as to Indians ...  Ha! _Indians_!  Now you will wonder, my young friend, when you come to think of these Indians--when you come to consider that fifty warlike nations of them live and roam over the prairies--many of them sworn foes to white men, killing the latter wherever they may meet them, as you would a mad dog or a poisonous spider,--I say, when you consider these things, you will wonder that this old French or Corsican father should consent to let his sons go upon so dangerous an expedition.  It seems unnatural, does it not?  In fact, quite improbable, when we come to reflect that the Colonel dearly loved his three sons, almost as dearly as his own life. And yet one would say, he could hardly have found a readier plan to get rid of them, than thus to send them forth among savages.  Upon what, then, did he rely for their safety?  On their age?  No.  He knew the Indians better than that.  He knew very well that their age would not be cared for, should they chance to fall in with any of the tribes hostile to the whites.  It is true, that the savages might not scalp them on this account--being boys,--but they would be very certain to carry them into a captivity from which they might never return.  Or did their father anticipate that the excursion should extend no farther than the country of some friendly tribe?  He entertained no such idea.  Had this been their plan, their errand would have been likely to prove fruitless. In a country of that sort they would have seen but little of the buffalo; for it is well-known that the buffaloes are only found in plenty upon those parts of the prairies termed \"war grounds\"--that is, where several tribes go to hunt, who are at war with each other.  In fact, that is the reason why these animals are more numerous there than elsewhere, as the hunters are fewer, on account of the danger they incur of coming into collision with each other.  In a territory which is exclusively in possession of any particular tribe, the buffaloes are soon killed or run off by incessant hunting.  It is a fact, therefore, well-known among prairie-hunters, that wherever buffaloes are plenty there is plenty of danger as well, though the converse of this is not always true.  On the neutral or \"war grounds\" of the Indians, you may meet with a friendly tribe one day, and on the next, or even within the next hour, you may fall in with a band of savages who will scalp you on sight.  Now, the father of our three boy hunters knew all this, as well as I know it.  How then are we to account for his apparently unnatural conduct, in permitting them to risk their lives in such an enterprise? It would be quite unaccountable indeed were it not that there was a _mystery_ connected with it, which I shall explain to you hereafter. All I can tell you now is, that when the three were mounted and about to start, the Colonel hobbled up; and, drawing from his pocket a small leathern bag or case ornamented with stained porcupine quills, he handed it to Basil, saying as he did so: \"_Take good care of it, Basil_--_you know its use_--_never let it part from you_--_your lives may depend upon it.  God be with you, my brave boys.  Adieu_!\"  Basil took the case, passed the string over his shoulders, pushed the bag under the breast of his hunting-shirt, pressed his father's hand, and putting the spur to his horse rode briskly off.  Lucien saluted his father with a kiss, waved his hand gracefully to Hugot, and followed.  Francois remained a moment behind the rest--rode up to Hugot--caught hold of his great moustache, gave it a twitch that caused the _ex-chasseur_ to grin again; and then, with a loud yell of laughter, wheeled his pony, and galloped after his brothers.  The Colonel and Hugot stood for some moments watching them.  When the boy hunters had reached the edge of the woods, all three reined up, turned in their saddles, and, taking off their hats, uttered a parting cheer.  The Colonel and Hugot cheered in return.  When the noise had subsided, the voice of Francois was heard shouting back,--  \"Fear not, papa! we'll bring you the _white buffalo_!\"    CHAPTER FIVE.  THE CAMP OF THE BOY HUNTERS.  Our young adventurers turned their faces westward, and were soon riding under the shadows of majestic woods.  At this time there were few white settlements west of the Mississippi river.  The small towns upon its banks, with here and there a settler's \"clearing\" or a squatter's cabin, were the only signs of civilisation to be met with.  A single day's ride in a westerly direction would carry the traveller clear of all these, and launch him at once into the labyrinth of swamps and woods, that stretched away for hundreds of miles before him.  It is true, there were some scattered settlements upon the bayous farther west, but most of the country between them was a wilderness.  In an hour or so our travellers had ridden clear of the settlements that surrounded Point Coupee, and were following the forest \"trails,\" rarely travelled except by roving Indians, or the white hunters of the border country.  The boys knew them well.  They had often passed that way on former hunting expeditions.  I shall not detail too minutely the events that occurred along their line of march.  This would tire you, and take up too much space.  I shall take you at once to their first encampment, where they had halted for the night.  It was in a small glade or opening, such as are often met with in the forests west of the Mississippi.  There was about an acre of clear ground, covered with grass and flowers, among which helianthus and blue lupines were conspicuous.  Tall trees grew all around; and you could tell from their leaves that these trees were of different kinds.  You might have told that from their trunks as well, for these were unlike each other.  Some were smooth, while upon others the bark was cracked, and crisped outward in large scales a foot or more in length.  The beautiful tulip-tree (_liriodendron_) was easily distinguished by its straight column-like trunks, out of which are sawed those great planks of _white poplar_ you may have seen, for that is the name by which it is known among carpenters and builders.  The name of _tulip-tree_ comes from its flowers, which in size and shape very much resemble tulips, and are of a greenish-yellow colour tinged with orange.  It was the characteristic tree around the glade.  There were many others, though; and most conspicuous, with its large wax-like leaves and blossoms, was the magnolia grandiflora.  The lofty sugar-maple (_acer saccharinum_) was seen, and lower down the leafy buck-eye (_aesculus flava_) with its pretty orange-flowers, and the shell-bark hickory--the _juglans alba_ of the botanists.  Huge creeping plants stretched from tree to tree, or ran slanting upward; and on one side of the glade you might observe the thick cane-reeds (_arundo gigantea_), growing like tall grass.  The forest on the other side was more open; no doubt, because some former fire had burned down the underwood in that direction.  The fan-like leaves of palmettos and yuccas growing all around, gave a southern and tropical aspect to the scene.  The young hunters had halted nearly two hours before sunset, in order to give time to prepare their night-camp.  About half-an-hour after their halt, the little glade presented a picture somewhat as follows:--Near its edge stood a small canvas tent, like a white cone or pyramid.  The fly, or opening, was thrown back, for the evening was fine, and there was no one inside.  A little to one side of the tent lay three saddles upon the grass.  They were of the Mexican fashion, with high pommel and cantle, a \"horn\" in front, with a staple and ring firmly fastened in the wood of the tree.  There were several thongs of leather fastened to other rings behind the cantle; but the stirrups were steel ones, and not those clumsy blocks of wood which so much disfigure the Mexican saddle. Beside the saddles was an odd-looking object.  It resembled a gigantic book, partly open, and set upon the opened edges.  It was a _pack-saddle_, also of Mexican fashion, and in that country called an \"alpareja.\"  It had a strong leathern girth, with a breech-strap to keep it from running forward upon the shoulders of the animal that might wear it.  At a short distance from the saddles, several blankets--red and green ones--with a bear-skin and a couple of buffalo-robes, were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21236"],["title","The Boy Hunters (#4)"],["body","upon the grass; and on a branch overhead hung whips, bridles, water-gourds, and spurs.  Against the trunk of a tulip-tree, that towered over the tent, rested three guns.  Two of them were rifles, of which one was much longer than the other: the third piece was a double-barrelled shot gun.  Bullet-pouches and powder-horns hung from the muzzles of all three, their straps being suspended from the projecting ends of the rammers.  On the opposite or leeward side of the tent a fire was burning.  It had not been long kindled, and crackled as it blazed.  You could easily have told the strong red flame to be that of the shell-bark hickory--the best firewood--though dry sticks of some lighter wood had been used to kindle it.  On each side of the fire a forked stick was stuck into the ground, with the forks at the top; and on these rested a fresh cut sapling, placed horizontally to serve as a crane.  A two-gallon camp-kettle of sheet-iron was suspended upon it and over the fire, and the water in the kettle was just beginning to boil.  Other utensils were strewed around. There was a frying-pan, some tin cups, several small packages containing flour, dried meat, and coffee; a coffee-pot of strong tin, a small spade, and a light axe, with its curved hickory shaft.  These were the inanimate objects of the picture.  Now for the animate.  First, then, were our heroes, the three Boy Hunters--Basil, Lucien, Francois.  Basil was engaged by the tent, driving in the pins; Lucien was attending to the fire which he has just kindled; while Francois was making the feathers fly out of a brace of wild pigeons he had shot on the way.  No two of the three were dressed alike.  Basil was all buckskin--except the cap, which was made from the skin of a raccoon, with the ringed-tail hanging over his shoulders like a drooping plume. He wore a hunting-shirt with fringed cape, handsomely ornamented with beads.  A belt fastened it around his waist, from which was suspended his hunting-knife and sheath, with a small holster, out of which peeped the shining butt of a pistol.  He wore deerskin leggings fringed down the seams, and mocassins upon his feet.  His dress was just that of a backwoods' hunter, except that his cotton under-garments looked finer and cleaner, and altogether his hunting-shirt was more tastefully embroidered than is common among professional hunters.  Lucien's dress was of a sky-blue colour.  It consisted of a half-blouse, half-hunting-shirt, of strong cottonade, with trousers of the same material.  He had laced buskins on his feet, and a broad-brimmed Panama hat on his head.  Lucien's dress was somewhat more civilised in its appearance than that of his elder brother.  Like him though he had a leather belt, with a sheath and knife on one side; and, instead of a pistol, a small tomahawk on the other.  Not that Lucien had set out with the intention of tomahawking anybody.  No; he carried his little hatchet for cracking rocks, not skulls.  Lucien's was a geological tomahawk.  Francois was still in roundabout jacket with trousers.  He wore leggings over his trousers, and mocassins upon his feet, with a cloth cap set jauntily over his luxuriant curls.  He, too, was belted with hunting-knife and sheath, and a very small pistol hung upon his left thigh.  Out near the middle of the glade were three horses picketed on lasso-ropes, so that they might not interfere with each other whilst browsing.  They were very different in appearance.  One was a large brown-black horse--a half-Arab--evidently endowed with great strength and spirit.  That was Basil's horse, and deservedly a favourite.  His name was \"Black Hawk\"--so called after the famous chief of the Sacs and Foxes, who was a friend of the old Colonel, and who had once entertained the latter when on a visit to these Indians.  The second horse was a very plain one, a bay, of the kind known as \"cot.\"  He was a modest, sober animal, with nothing either of the hunter or warrior in his looks; but sleek withal, and in good condition, like a well-fed citizen.  Hence his name, which was \"Le Bourgeois.\"  Of course he was ridden by the quiet Lucien.  The third horse might have been termed a pony--if size be considered--as he was by far the smallest of the three.  He was a horse, however, both in shape and character--one of that small but fiery breed taken by the Spanish conquerors to the New World, and now known throughout the western country as \"mustangs.\"  As I shall have reason to say more of these beautiful creatures by and by, I shall only state here, that the one in question was spotted like a pard, and answered to the name \"Le Chat\" (the cat)--particularly when Francois called him, for he was Francois' horse.  A little apart from the horses was another animal, of a dirty slate colour, with some white marks along the back and shoulders.  That was a true-bred Mexican mule, wiry and wicked as any of its race.  It was a she-mule, and was called Jeanette.  Jeanette was tethered beyond kicking distance of the horses; for between her and the mustang there existed no friendly feeling.  Jeanette was the owner of the odd-looking saddle--the pack.  Jeanette's duty was to carry the tent, the provisions, the implements, and utensils.  But one other living object might be noticed in the glade--the dog \"Marengo.\"  From his size and colour--which was tawny red--you might have mistaken him for a panther--a cougar.  His long black muzzle and broad hanging ears gave him quite a different appearance, however; and told you that he was a hound.  He was, in fact, a blood-hound, with the cross of a mastiff--a powerful animal.  He was crouching near Francois, watching for the offal of the birds.  Now, young reader, you have before you a \"night-camp\" of the Boy hunters.    CHAPTER SIX.  A FOX-SQUIRREL IN A FIX.  Francois soon finished dressing his pigeons, and plunged them into the boiling-water.  A piece of dried meat was added, and then some salt and pepper, drawn from the store-bag, for it was the intention of Francois to make pigeon-soup.  He next proceeded to beat up a little flour with water, in order to give consistency to the soup.  \"What a pity,\" said he, \"we have no vegetables!\"  \"Hold!\" cried Lucien, who overheard him.  \"There appears to be a variety of green stuff in this neighbourhood.  Let me see what can be done.\"  So saying, Lucien walked about the glade with his eyes bent upon the ground.  He seemed to find nothing among the grass and herbs that would do; and presently he strayed off among trees, towards the banks of a little stream that ran close by.  In a few minutes he was seen returning with both his hands full of vegetables.  He made no remark, but flung them down before Francois.  There were two species--one that resembled a small turnip, and, in fact, was the Indian turnip (_psoralea esculenta_), while the other was the wild onion found in many parts of America.  \"Ha!\" cried Francois, who at once recognised them, \"what luck! _pomme-blanche_, and wild onions too, as I live!  Now I shall make a soup worth tasting.\"  And he proceeded with great glee to cut up the vegetables, and fling them into the steaming kettle.  In a short while the meat and pigeons were boiled, and the soup was ready.  The kettle was taken from the crane; and the three brothers, seating themselves on the grass, filled their tin cups, and set to eating.  They had brought a supply of hard bread to last for a few days. When that should give out, they would draw upon their bag of flour; and when this, too, should be exhausted, it was their intention to go without bread altogether, as they had often done on like excursions before.  While thus enjoying their pigeon-soup and picking the bones of the plump birds, the attention of all three was suddenly arrested by a movement near one side of the glade.  They had just caught a glimpse of something that looked like a flash of yellow light shooting up in a straight direction from the ground.  All three guessed what it was--the lightning passage of a squirrel up the trunk of a tree; and there was the animal itself, clinging flat against the bark, having paused a moment--as is usual with squirrels-- before making another rush upward.  \"Oh!\" cried Lucien, in a suppressed voice, \"it is a fox-squirrel, and such a beauty!  See! it is marked like a tortoise-shell cat!  Papa would give twenty dollars for such a skin.\"  \"He shall have it for far less,\" rejoined Francois, stealing towards his gun.  \"Stop, Francois!\" said Lucien.  \"Let Basil try it with his rifle--he is a surer shot than you.\"  \"Very well,\" replied Francois; \"but if he should miss, it's no harm for me to be ready.\"  Basil had already risen, and was silently making for the guns.  On reaching them, he took the long rifle, and turned in the direction of the game.  At the same moment Francois armed himself with his double-barrel.  The tree up which the squirrel had run was what is termed a \"dead-wood.\" It was a decaying tulip-tree--scathed by lightning or storm--and stood somewhat apart from the others, out in the open ground.  There was little else standing but the naked trunks, which rose like a column to the height of sixty feet.  The branches had all been swept away by the wind, with one exception; and this was a long limb that stretched diagonally upward from the top of the trunk.  The limb, although crooked and forking in several places, was not very thick.  It was without twigs or leaves, being of course, like the tree itself, dead.  Whilst Basil and Francois were preparing their guns, the squirrel had made a second rush to the top of this limb; where it sat itself down in a fork, and appeared to contemplate the setting sun.  No better mark could have been desired for a shot, provided they could get near enough; and that they were likely to do, for the little animal did not appear to regard the presence either of them or their horses--thus showing that it had never been hunted.  With its bushy tail erect, and spread like "]]]
