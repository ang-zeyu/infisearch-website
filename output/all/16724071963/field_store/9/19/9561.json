And--\"  Mrs. Pragoff did not add that she had invited a little party to meet them. She was afraid of frightening the timid souls.  \"Would you like to come, Miss Prudy? Tell me honestly, now.\"  There was no need to ask Fly. She was dancing for joy--the absurd little image.  \"O, yes'm; I'd be delighted,\" replied Mother Hubbard, a smile lighting up her face even to the floury tip of her nose. \"And I think Horace and Dotty would, too. Shall I go and ask?\"  Yes, Horace and Dotty were both pleased with the idea.  \"She's a foreigner,\" said Prudy, doubtfully; \"but she talks our language beautifully. She's a dear friend of auntie's, too.\"  \"What I object to,\" said Horace, \"is taking Toddlekins; but I may possibly hire her to stay at home.\"  It was finally decided that Mrs. Pragoff should call next day and take the children to church with her, and thence home to a Christmas dinner. She laughed, as she rolled away in her carriage, thinking what droll figures they were, and how Prudy blinked through her glasses.  \"So I shan't have to cook but one meal more, and that will be breakfast,\" thought Mother Hubbard, her tired heart leaping up with something like joy.  They sat down to dinner at last.  \"Tea urn been standing on the table all this while?\" asked Dr. Moonshine, resuming his critical manners; \"'twould take the tea some time to freeze on here, Mrs. Hubbard, if that is what you're trying to do with it!\"  Mrs. Hubbard pretended not to hear.  \"She's blind of her ears, papa; you have to speak loud.\"  \"What makes your child's face so red, doctor?\" asked the landlady, pouring hot water till it overran the cup; \"don't the darling feel well?\"  \"Yes'm, pitty well; only but the white tea gets in my cheeks and makes 'em too hot.\"  \"White tea, I should think,\" remarked Dr. Moonshine; \"why, Mother Hubbard, the tea-leaf in your urn must feel rather lonesome.\"  Mother Hubbard took off the cover and peeped in.  \"None there, as true as you live! I'll jump right up, doctor, and stew two or three handfuls.\"  \"Don't rise for me, ma'am; don't rise for me. We'll swallow the will for the deed, ma'am; the will for the deed.\"  \"It's always so, doctor,\" said Lady Magnifico, in an undertone; \"we've had to swallow these mistakes from time _immortal_.\"  Her ladyship meant \"immemorial.\" She was surprised at the ease with which she used large words.  \"All the mistakes are owing to the eccentricity of genius,\" said the doctor, bowing to Mother Hubbard. \"Our landlady is what is called 'absent.' Here's a health to our _absent_ friend.\"  \"You'll have to excuse the biscuit,\" said Mother Hubbard, nervously. \"I mixed 'em too tight, and I think the flour's half corn, they look so yellow; it _can't_ be all soda.\"  \"I presume not _all_ soda; some mixture of flour and water. But where are they, ma'am?\"  \"O, I put them in the cupboard. I thought you'd like crackers better.\"  \"But these are the _mizzerble_ kind, that don't split,\" said Lady Magnifico, in tragic tones; \"I told you so to-day noon.\"  \"Stop a minute, Miss Hubbard; my coffee's too sour,\" cried the youngest, determined to scowl as hard as Dotty did, if it was a possible thing.  The worried landlady passed the sugar, and the small boarder corrected the _sourness_ of her white tea with three teaspoonfuls, heaping measure.  \"My little Toddlekins is eating nothing.\" said the doctor. \"I hope her red cheeks don't indicate fever.\"  \"There's great quantities of sickness just now among children,\" said Lady Magnifico, crooking her little finger genteelly. \"_Nervous Exhaustation_ is going about.\"  \"Nervous what, my lady?\"  \"_Exhaustation_. I am well acquainted with a lady in the first society that had it dreadfully. She called in twenty-five doctors, if my memory _preserves_ me right; and _then_ she like to died.\"  \"You know it for a fact, my lady? I hope it won't come here (or the doctors either). Is it catching, Dr. Moonshine?\"  \"Well, yes, Mother Hubbard; it's apt to catch fine ladies. Goes hard with 'em, too.\"  \"Ah me, then I'll never dare go out,\" drawled Lady Magnifico, looking at her rings.  Here Mother Hubbard timidly passed the cake. \"White Mountain; but I suspect it's a poor rule.\"  \"A poor rule that don't work both ways, hey? If this was ever white, ma'am, 'twasn't a fast color; faded to a rusty black. And as to it's being a mountain, ma'am, it looks to me like a pretty hollow valley.\"  \"I'm so sorry, doctor! But your little girl dusted my soda over the cat, and that was why the cake didn't rise.\"  \"Just so, ma'am; but did the cat rise?\"  \"O, Dr. Moonshine, I see you're making fun of my cooking. And now I'll tell you something more. I got the butter ready, and forgot to put it in, and that's why the cake's so tough.\"  \"Never mind,\" said the doctor, very amiable as long as he could make his joke. \"It is pretty tough cake, ma'am; but it's always tougher where there's none.\"  \"There's one thing about it,\" said Mother Hubbard, a little relieved; \"it's sweet in the middle, and you needn't eat the bitter part, where it's burnt.\"  \"It's my practice to mix the bitter with the sweet,\" said the doctor, waving the butter-knife. \"In this way, Mother H., your black-valley cake is almost as good as pills.\"  \"I ate a pill,\" observed Fly, \"and 'twas worser'n this!\"  \"You ate a pill, child? When? Where? I'll warrant that's what ails you.\"  \"No, it don't ail me now. I spitted it out.\"  After nibbling a few crackers, and the inside of the cake, the happy family moved away from the table, hungrier than when they had sat down.  \"What is home without a mother?\" sang Horace, in a plaintive voice; and Dotty joined in, with emphasis.  Prudy looked as low-spirited as the \"black-valley cake.\"  \"I hope Uncle Augustus will be able to come home to-morrow. I declare, we are real cruel not to feel worse about his being sick away off there in a hotel.\"  \"You'd better believe he gets things to eat,\" responded Lady Magnifico, aside to the doctor. \"I'd rather be some sick than have a landlady that's purblind and _purdeaf_, and such _owdrageous_ poor cooking! Glad I'm going out to Christmas dinner.\"     CHAPTER VI.  PRUDY IN A NEW LIGHT.   Mother Hubbard was heated, and tired, and hungry, and cross. It was all very well for a lady boarder to loll on an ottoman, play with her rings, and find fault. It was all very well for a gentleman boarder to fire poor jokes; but they couldn't either of them know how every word cut like a lash. When the doctor said, carelessly, \"Some people think themselves great cooks, my lady; but the proof of the pudding's in the eating,\" why, that speech was \"the pin in the end of the lash.\"  Prudy saw now that she had pretended to know a great deal more than she really did. Pretension is very apt to get laughed at. She had always scorned Dotty's self-conceit; but hadn't she shown quite as much herself? Making her auntie suppose she understood cooking, and putting Mrs. Fixfax to all this trouble for nothing? How horrified auntie would be, and the housekeeper too, if they should dream that this little family was starving, with a cook-book lying open on the floor!  \"But I declare, it's real mean in you two to make fun of me,\" cried the young landlady, tipping the sugar-basin plump into the dish-tub; \"you couldn't get any better supper yourselves, nor half so good; so there!\"  Surprised at the sharp sound of her own voice, dismayed at sight of the wet sugar, and completely discouraged by the aspect of things in general, Prudy burst out into a sort of frenzy. She was ashamed of herself, but she couldn't stop.  \"You think I can bear everything--you and Dotty both! People are careful what they say to Dotty, for her temper's just like live coals; but they talk to me, and say anything; anything they've a mind to.\"  \"Why, Prue,\" exclaimed Horace, as astonished as if Mother Hubbard's dog had spoken; \"why, Prue!\"  \"Yes, you think it's awful if I speak; but sometimes it seems as if I should bite my tongue out.\"  \"Don't, Prudy,\" exclaimed Dotty, looking on with awe and alarm, as if there had been a sudden eclipse of the sun; \"I didn't mean to.\"  \"Don't Prudy,\" said Fly, clutching at the brown dress; \"and I'll give you sumpin what I buy.\"  There is an old saying, \"Beware the fury of a patient man.\" Prudy had tried all day to                            \"Smile and smile,     While secret wounds were eating at her heart;\"  but now she could scarcely bear the touch of little Fly's hand. She did not care what she said, if she could only find words bitter enough.  \"I always have to bear, and bear, and bear. Nobody else does. I've noticed how different it is with Susy. She frets, and then people let her alone. And Dotty, how she tosses up her head like Aunt Martha's horse Lightning-Dodger! Haven't I always pacified Dotty, and humored her? Had to alter the play to suit her. And what does that child know or care, any more than if I was a common sister, that hadn't been giving up, and giving up, and _giving up_, ever since she was born?\"  Prudy's cap-strings shook violently, her teeth chattered, and the sharp words seemed to rattle out like hail-stones. Horace had never seen her in such a mood, and was half inclined to run away; but when she took her hands down from her face, and he saw how pale she was, his heart was moved.  \"Come, Prue, you're sick abed; that's what's the matter. Lie down, and let that lazy Dot take off her diamonds, and go to work.\"  Prudy dropped upon the sofa and covered her face with her handkerchief, while Dotty, strange to relate, actually slid the rings off her fingers and thumbs, and began to put away the crackers.  \"O, dear,\" thought Prudy, blushing under the cap-border, spectacles, and handkerchief; \"what did possess me to talk so? I had been holding in all day; why did I let go? If I ever do let go, I can't stop; and O, how shameful it is!\"  It seemed as easy for Prudy to be good as for a bird to sing;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20984"],["title","Prudy Keeping House (#6)"],["body","it was not so. She had a great deal of human nature, after all. She liked her own way, but she never had it unless Dotty was willing. Was that a pleasant way to live? If you think so, dears, just try it. The secret of Prudy's sweetness was really this: In all trials she was continually saying, under breath, \"Please, God, keep me from doing wrong.\" She had found that was really the only way--the only _safe_ way.  \"Everybody calls me amiable. They wouldn't if they knew how I have to grit my teeth together to keep from scolding. I like to be called amiable, but nobody'll do it again; and Horace sees now I'm not the girl he thought I was.\"  All Prudy's hail-stones of wrath had melted into tear-drops, and she was sobbing them into her handkerchief. She did not clearly know whether she was crying because she had done wrong, or because Horace would see she \"was not the girl he had thought she was.\"  \"Bless your dear little soul,\" said Dr. Moonshine, kneeling before her, while his blue swallow-tails swept the floor, \"you've told the truth. Everybody knows Dot's a spitfire, and you're an angel; and she does impose upon you most abominably.\"  Dotty stood staring, with a plate in her hand, too much astonished to defend herself.  \"And I'm ashamed of firing so many jokes at you, Prue; I am so. I'm a great joker (he meant a great _wit_!), but this is the first time I ever mistrusted you cared--you always take things so like a lamb,--or you'd better believe I wouldn't have done it. For there isn't a girl in the world I like so well as I do you, nor begin to.\"  \"O, Hollis,\" moaned the little one, stirred by sudden jealousy.  \"Hullelo! I forgot you, Topknot.--You're my heart's jewel; that's generally understood. When I say I like Prue, I mean next after you.\"  The jealous Fly was satisfied, and folded her little wings against Horace's breast. Prudy felt greatly soothed, but her cap-strings were still shaking, and she could not trust her voice to speak. Nothing more was said for some time. Dotty clattered away at the dishes, kitty purred by the stove, and Horace rocked his little sister, who clung about his neck like an everlasting pea. Presently he stopped rocking, and exclaimed,--  \"Why, what's the matter with my Toddlekins? What makes her breathe so short?\"  \"My froat's short; that's what is it,\" replied the little philosopher, closing her eyes, as if she did not choose to talk.  \"But how does your throat feel, Topknot?\"  \"Feels bad; why?\"  \"Girls, this child has a sore throat, and a high fever. Her hands are as hot as pepper.\"  Dotty wrung the dish-cloth tragically.  \"She's going to have the measles; you see'f she don't.\"  \"Hush!\" said Prudy, springing up, and tucking back her sleeves. \"Let's give her a warm bath. That's what mother does when we are sick, before ever she sends for the doctor.\"  \"I'd _ravver_ have a _turkey-wash_,\" said Fly, rousing a little, and then dropping her head again.  \"There, she's lost her senses; I knew she would,\" said Dotty, walking the floor.  \"Do stop that, Dot. She has her senses as clear as you have. When she says _turkey-wash_, she means a Turkish bath; it takes me to interpret. She had a very gentle Turkish bath once. Liked it--didn't you, Fly? Can't you rub her real hard with a crash towel, girls? That will be almost as good.\"  \"Of course we can,\" said Prudy, forgetting her gust of indignation entirely; \"and what could be nicer than this little bathroom, with the silver faucets and ivory tub. Come, Fly, and have your turkey-wash. 'Twill make you feel a great deal better.\"  After a nice bath, at which Prudy and Dotty presided, the little one was dressed in her nightie, and set on her brother's knee again.  \"Prudy said I'd feel better to be baved,\" said she, looking thoughtfully at the gas-light; \"but now I was baved, and I don't feel any diffunt; I feel just's I did by-fore.\"  \"When can she have taken such a cold?\" said Horace; \"don't you see, Prue, she can't breathe out of her nose?\"  Then Fly remembered the orange-man, and something made her face grow red in a minute; but it was not the white tea.  \"Pitiful about my signess,\" sighed she, and thought she would never, never tell of her own disobedience. But Horace saw the blush and heard the sigh.  \"I am glad Fly always minds,\" said he, looking straight into the little guilty face. \"For God sees everything she does,\" whispered he, solemnly.  Horace never spoke of such subjects to other people; you would not suppose they were much in his mind; but to this precious little sister he gave his best thoughts, so far as he could make her understand them.  \"For God sees everything she does.\"  Fly did not speak for as much as a minute, and then she said, timidly,--  \"Hollis, I want to ask you sumpin; does God wear spetticles?\"  \"No, dear; no, indeed.\"  \"O, I thought He did.\"  \"But He sees us in the light and in the dark, Topknot.\"  The child winced.  \"Can He see Hisself athout looking in the glass?\"  \"Yes, I suppose so.\"  \"Then, when I go up to God, I'll find He has four eyes,--two to see Hisself, and two to see other things. O, dear, I'm so sick, I guess I will go up to God.\"  The housekeeper was listening from the next room.  \"That child's voice is growing hoarse. I must go and look into this business,\" thought she.  She knocked at the children's door.  \"I came to ask if I can do anything for you, young ladies.\"  Mrs. Fixfax had heard a great deal of the play, and had been in a state of amusement all day, without seeing the actors; and when she caught sight of them now, she had to twist her mouth very hard, \"to keep her teeth in.\"  The magnificent Lady Magnifico, the ridiculous Dr. Moonshine, and the becapped Mother Hubbard, all replied in chorus, \"O, yes'm, we were going to ring for you. Do you see what ails the baby.\"  Mrs. Fixfax approached the child in such a tender, motherly way, that Horace was ashamed of having compared her face to \"a platter of cold hash.\" She had a strong, sensible look, as if she were capable of carrying a whole hospital full of children through all sorts of diseases; and Prudy and Horace, who had begun to have an unpleasant feeling of responsibility, were greatly relieved.  \"You don't think it's anything but a cold--do you, Mrs. Fixfax? I don't know much about sickness.\"  Mrs. Fixfax allowed herself to smile this time, as her eye rested on the Mother Hubbard cap.  \"No, I don't see anything alarming yet. If this was my child, I should just gargle her throat with salt and water, wrap a pork rind round her neck, and put her to bed.\"  Fly objected to nothing, if she could only sleep with her own brother Hollis. When told she might do so, she tried to clap her hands; but her heart was heavy, and her throat was sore; so all she could do was to kiss him and cry.  \"And now, my dears, how do you enjoy housekeeping?\" asked Mrs. Fixfax, carelessly, as she attended to Fly's throat.  \"No--ot very much,\" returned Dr. Moonshine, faintly; for no one else seemed ready to speak. \"Rather hard on the head of the family. Don't you say so, Prue?\"  But Prudy could not answer, on account of a throbbing at the roots of her tongue.  \"I see you have been taking an early dinner,\" contined Mrs. Fixfax, very coolly, as if she had no idea the children before her were half starved.  \"Ye--es'm.\"  \"So, perhaps you wouldn't object to going down and finishing off on roast turkey? I ordered the table set for you.\"  \"You did? O, thank you, ma'am!\" cried Lady Magnifico, ready to throw herself on the housekeeper's neck.  \"I never object to roast turkey myself,\" said the doctor, his eyes gleaming with delight.  Mother Hubbard said nothing; but she thought she should relish a good dinner as well as her boarders. They all went down but Fly, who was by this time fast asleep in Mrs. Fixfax's arms.  \"I reckon the servants thought we'd been wrecked on a desert island, by the dash we made at that turkey,\" whispered Horace, as they returned to the housekeeper's room.  \"How good you were, Horace Clifford, not to tell Mrs. Fixfax about my awful cooking.\"  \"And I didn't tell, either,\" said Dotty. \"But wasn't it _mizzerble_?\"  As if Mrs. Fixfax didn't know, and wasn't that very minute laughing over the \"tight biscuit\" and low-spirited cake!     CHAPTER VII.  A FLY IN TRINITY CHURCH.   The children went to bed that night cheered by a remark which Mrs. Fixfax dropped as if by accident.  \"The cook is to fry buckwheat cakes in the morning. I dare say you would like omelettes, too. Do you drink chocolate?\"  \"She takes it for granted we are going to eat down stairs,\" thought Prudy. And now her troubles were over. Life bloomed before her once more like a garden of roses.  Horace did not rest remarkably well. In the first place, the bed was too warm. Mrs. Fixfax had rolled Fly into a big bundle, with nothing out but the end of her nose, and was toasting her with soapstones.  \"Buried alive,\" Horace said, \"with gravestones at her head and feet.\"  \"I'm all of a _personation_,\" gasped the child. \"My mamma never did me so, Hollis. She gave me little tinty tonty pills,--sugar clear through,--not the big ones Miss Fixfix eats.\"  \"Well, lie still, Topknot, and don't roll towards me.\"  For an hour or two Fly lay gasping; then she said, softly,--  \"Hollis, Hollis, is He looking now?\"  \"Yes, dear; but don't be afraid of the good God.\"  \"I didn't, Hollis, if I wasn't naughty. When I'm good I'm willin' He should look.\"  \"Naughty, Topknot?\"  \"Yes, Hollis; I _solomon_ promised I wouldn't go ou' doors; but that new Miss Fixfix, she let me gwout, athout nuffin on my head, 'n' I got a awful cold.\"  \"O, little Fly!\"  \"I know it, Hollis. I was defful sorry all the time. I ate ollinges, too; so for course I got the sore froat.\"  \"I'm glad you told me, Fly; now I know what ails you. But you mustn't ever disobey again.\"  \"Yes, um,\" said Fly, rolling towards her brother, and crying till the tears ran down on the flannel which was bound around her neck. A few moments after she whispered,--  \"Now I"]]]
