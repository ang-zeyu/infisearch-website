Now, if you've finished with this poor chap for a while, you had better cut away and make yourself fit for the cuddy, and then shift aft, bag and baggage.\"  \"Very well, sir, I will, and many thanks to you for the promotion,\" answered Dick.  \"But we cannot leave Tom here on the table, comfortable as he is.  Therefore, with your permission, sir, I will call in a couple of hands, who, with Joe and myself, will be able to put him into the spare bunk, where he will be out of everybody's way, and where I can attend to him quite conveniently.\"  To this proposal the worthy skipper at once consented; and half an hour later Dick, having discarded his working clothes for a suit of blue serge, and otherwise made himself presentable, moved aft and established himself in the spare cabin which Captain Roberts placed at his disposal, the skipper having meanwhile ensured a cordial reception for him from the passengers by telling them such particulars of Dick's history as he was acquainted with, and also describing, with much picturesque detail, the masterly manner in which the lad had patched up the injured seaman.  Dick had no reason to complain of the manner in which the passengers received him among them; on the contrary, his reception was cordial in the extreme, especially by the women, to whose sense of romance the lad's story, as told by the skipper, appealed very strongly.  The introduction took place just as the passengers--or at least those of them who were not too ill--were about to sit down to tiffin, and Dick was assigned a place at the long table halfway between the head and the foot, where Captain Roberts and Mr Sutcliffe respectively presided; but the young man declined to sit down until he had visited and relieved his new patients, consisting of five ladies and three men.  His method of dealing with these unfortunates was simplicity itself. Relying wholly upon the wonderful power of hypnotism with which his friend Humphreys had endowed him, he prepared for each patient a draught consisting of sugar and water only, slightly flavoured with an aromatic bitter; and, as he presented this, he got the patient under his influence in the instantaneous manner which Humphreys had taught him, at the same time saying, in a quietly confident tone of voice:  \"Now, I want you to drink this, please.  It is an absolutely unfailing and instantaneous remedy for the distressing complaint from which you are suffering, and the moment that you have swallowed it every trace of discomfort will disappear, to return no more.  You will feel so thoroughly well that very probably you will wish to rise and dress; but I do not advise that.  On the contrary, I recommend you to remain where you are until you have had a few hours' refreshing sleep, after which you can get up to dinner.  That is right,\"--as the patient swallowed the draught.  \"Now you feel quite all right, don't you?  Yes.  You will feel very sleepy presently; just let yourself go; and when you awake you will find yourself as well as you ever were in your life.\"  And, incredible though it may appear, that is precisely what happened. What was perhaps at least equally remarkable was that, although these good people had all suffered more or less from seasickness every day since leaving Gravesend, from that moment they were entirely free from it for the remainder of the voyage.  Among the passengers who were thus suddenly and completely cured was a Mr Philip Grosvenor, who, having been crossed in love, and, moreover, possessing far more money than he knew what to do with, while he had no disposition to dissipate it on the racecourse or at the gambling tables, was going out to South Africa to shoot big game; and this young man--he was only a month or two over twenty-six years of age--at once struck up a warm friendship with Dick, originating, possibly, in a feeling of gratitude for his prompt relief from those sufferings which had hitherto made his life a burden to him, from the moment when the South Foreland light had sunk beneath the horizon astern of the _Concordia_.  He made his first advances after dinner on the evening of the day which had witnessed his cure.  As Dick had foretold, he fell asleep immediately after swallowing the draught which the young medico had administered, had awakened, feeling absolutely well, just in time to rise and dress for dinner, had partaken of a very hearty meal, and thereafter had made his way up on the poop to gaze upon the stirring spectacle of the ship battling with and gallantly holding her own against the raging wind and sea--and possibly also to revel in his new- found immunity from the horrors of _mal de mer_.  Here he had found Dick, a born sailor, walking the heaving and plunging deck and chatting animatedly with Mr Sutcliffe, who, honest man, felt somewhat at a loss to determine precisely the manner of his behaviour toward the youngster whom he had so recently patronised and ordered about, but who was now translated aft to the quarterdeck upon an equal footing with himself. Dick had just about succeeded in putting to flight the worthy chief mate's feeling of awkwardness and embarrassment when Grosvenor appeared and joined the pair, whereupon Sutcliffe, who was rather shy with the passengers, sheered off, upon the pretence of attending to his duty, and left the two together.  \"By Jove, Doctor, but this is a grand sight, isn't it?\" exclaimed Dick's recent patient.  \"Never saw the like of it before, and shouldn't be in form to see it now, but for you.  'Pon my word, you know, you are a wonder--a perfect wonder!  Give me your arm and let's walk about a bit, shall we?  That's right.  D'you know I don't think I ever felt more fit in my life than I do at this moment; and to reflect that only this morning I was--ugh!  Tell you what it is, Doctor, you should patent that prescription of yours, have it made up, and sell it at five shillings the bottle.  You would soon make your fortune.  And I'll write a testimonial for you.  `Took one dose and never needed another!' eh?  No, hang it all, that wouldn't do, either, rather too ambiguous, eh? sort of double meaning in that kind of statement--what?  But, joking apart, old man, I'd very strongly advise you to patent the thing and advertise it extensively.  I'm certain that there's money in it.\"  \"Possibly,\" agreed Dick, who had no intention of taking this young man into his confidence to the extent of explaining the actual character of the draught.  \"Unfortunately, however, to do as you suggest needs the preliminary expenditure of a good deal of money, which is a singularly scarce commodity with me.  No, I am afraid that plan of yours will scarcely do; it is true that I am particularly anxious to make my fortune, and that, too, without a moment's loss of time, but I am afraid I shall have to hit upon some other way of doing it.\"  \"Ah!  Well, what is your plan, if it is a fair question?  Excuse me, old chap, I'm not asking out of mere vulgar, impertinent curiosity, but at the dinner table to-night somebody mentioned that you are working your passage out to South Africa.  What do you propose to do when you arrive there?\"  \"Heaven only knows; certainly I do not,\" answered Dick with a lugubrious smile.  \"When I step ashore on the wharf at Port Natal I shall not know in what direction to turn my steps, or where to look for a meal or a night's lodging.  Also the whole of my available capital will consist in the wages which I shall take up when Captain Roberts gives me my discharge, amounting, probably, to a couple of shillings.\"  \"What?\" ejaculated Grosvenor incredulously.  \"Oh, I say, my dear chap, you are not in earnest, surely?\"  \"Indeed I am, then, in deadly earnest,\" answered Dick.  \"But I am not worrying.  I am strong and more than willing to work, and I mean to take the very first job that comes to hand, let it be what it will.  I believe that if a chap is willing to work he can always get something to do, though it may not be precisely the kind of work that he would like. And when once I have secured the means of providing myself with board and lodging I shall be able to look round for something better.\"  \"Yes--yes, of course you will,\" responded Grosvenor, a little dubiously. \"I say, old chap,\" he continued admiringly, \"you are a `gritty' beggar, and no mistake!  I wonder if you would mind telling me your story?\"  \"No, not at all,\" answered Dick; \"there is nothing in it that I need be ashamed of.\"  And forthwith he proceeded to give his new-found friend a brief yet clear account of the circumstances which had resulted in his being reduced to his present plight.  \"By Jove, Maitland, I admire you!\" exclaimed Grosvenor when Dick had come to the end of his story.  \"There is not one man in a hundred who, under similar circumstances, would have tackled the situation with the indomitable pluck and whole-hearted belief in himself that you have shown; and I feel sure that such courage will meet with its just reward. You are the kind of fellow that always comes out on top, simply because you will not allow yourself to be kept down.  Now, look here, I am going to make a proposition to you--and, understand me, it is on purely selfish grounds that I am going to make it.  I am going out to South Africa because I want to forget a--well, a very bitter disappointment that I have recently sustained, and the particulars of which I will perhaps tell you some day if you fall in with my proposition, as I hope you will.  The way in which I propose to conquer this disappointment of mine is to go in for a life of adventure--exploration of the interior, big-game shooting, and that sort of thing, you understand.  I have heard some most thrilling stories of the wonderful things and people that are to be found in the interior of Africa, and, while many of them are doubtless lies, there is evidence enough of a perfectly reliable character to prove that there is at least a certain amount"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21060"],["title","The Congo Rovers: A Story of the Slave Squadron (#0)"],["body","Congo Rovers A Story of the Slave Squadron  By Harry Collingwood ________________________________________________________________________ This book by Collingwood is a good story, but as your reviewer has said elsewhere, told in a rather long-winded manner, and in the notably Kingston style and format that Collingwood often adopts. Why not? Kingston was dead before Collingwood started to write, and the style had been proved to be what young readers of the era liked.  The format specifically is that the book starts with a young boy who is suddenly offered a posting as a midshipman in a naval vessel about to sail in a few days' time.

CHAPTER ONE.  MY FIRST APPEARANCE IN UNIFORM.  \"Um!\" ejaculated my father as he thoughtfully removed his double eye- glass from his nose with one hand, and with the other passed a letter to me across the breakfast-table--\"Um! this letter will interest you, Dick. It is from Captain Vernon.\"  My heart leapt with sudden excitement, and my hand trembled as I stretched it out for the proffered epistle.  The mention of Captain Vernon's name, together with the announcement that the subject-matter of the letter was of interest to me, prepared me in a great measure for the intelligence it conveyed; which was to the effect that the writer, having been appointed to the command of the sloop-of-war _Daphne_, now found himself in a position to fulfil a promise of some standing to his dear and honoured friend Dr Hawkesley (my father) by receiving his son (myself) on board the sloop, with the rating of midshipman.  The sloop, the letter went on to say, was commissioned for service on the west coast of Africa; and if I decided to join her no time should be lost in procuring my outfit, as the _Daphne_ was under orders to sail on the --; just four days from the date of the receipt of the letter.  \"Well, Dick, what do you think of Captain Vernon's proposal?\" inquired my father somewhat sadly, as I concluded my perusal of the letter and raised my eyes to his.  \"Oh, father!\"  I exclaimed eagerly, \"I _hope_ you will consent to let me go.  Perhaps I may never have another such an opportunity; and I am _quite sure_ I shall never care to be anything but a sailor.\"  \"Ah! yes--the old, old story,\" murmured my father, shaking his head dubiously.  \"Thousands of lads have told their fathers exactly the same thing, and have lived to bitterly regret their choice of a profession. Look at my life.  I have to run about in all weathers; to take my meals when and how I can; there is not a single hour in the twenty-four that I can call my own; it is a rare thing for me to get a night of undisturbed rest; it is a hard, anxious, harassing life that I lead--you have often said so yourself, and urged it as one of the reasons why you object to follow in my footsteps.  But I tell you, Dick, that my life--ay, or the life even of the poorest country practitioner, for that matter--is one of ease and luxury compared with that of a sailor.  But I have said all this to you over and over again, without convincing you; and I hardly dare hope that I shall be more successful now; so, if you are really quite resolved to go to sea, I will offer no further objections.  It is true that you will be going to an unhealthy climate; but God is just as well able to preserve you there as He is here; and then, again, you have a strong healthy constitution, which, fortified with such preservative medicines as I can supply, will, I hope, enable you to withstand the malaria and to return to us in safety.  Now, what do you say--are you still resolved to go?\"  \"Quite,\" I replied emphatically.  \"Now that you have given your consent the last obstacle is removed, and I can follow with a light heart the bent of my own inclinations.\"  \"Very well, then,\" said my father, rising from the table and pushing back his chair.  \"That question being settled, we had better call upon Mr Shears forthwith and give the order for your uniform and outfit. There is no time to lose; and since go you _will_, I would very much rather you went with Vernon than with anyone else.\"  The above conversation took place, as already stated, in the breakfast- room of my father's house.  My father was at that time--as he continued to be until the day of his death--the leading physician in Portsmouth; and his house--a substantial four-storey building--stood near the top of the High Street.  The establishment of Mr Shears, \"Army and Navy Tailor, Clothier, and Outfitter,\" was situated near the bottom of the same street.  A walk, therefore, of some ten minutes' duration took us to our destination; and at the end of a further half-hour's anxious consultation I had been measured for my uniform--one suit of which was faithfully promised for the next day--had chosen my sea-chest, and had selected a complete outfit of such clothing as was to be obtained ready- made.  This important business concluded, my father departed upon his daily round of visits, and I had the remainder of the day at my own disposal.  My first act on emerging from the door of Mr Shears' establishment was to hasten off to the dockyard at top speed to take another look at the _Daphne_.  I had often seen the craft before; had taken an interest in her, indeed, I may say, from the moment that her keel was laid--she was built in Portsmouth dockyard--and had watched her progress to completion and her recent launch with an admiration which had steadily increased until it grew into positive _love_.  And now I was actually to have the happiness, the _bliss_, of going to sea in her as an officer on her first cruise.  Ecstatic thought!  I felt as though I was walking on air!  But my rapture received a pretty effectual damper when I reflected--as I soon did--that my obstinate determination to go to sea must certainly prove a deep disappointment, if not a source of constant and cruel anxiety, to my father.  Dear old dad! his most cherished wish, as I knew full well, had long been that I, his only son, might qualify myself to take over and carry on the exceedingly snug practice he had built up, when the pressure of increasing years should render his retirement desirable.  But the idea was so utterly distasteful to me that I had persistently turned a deaf ear to all his arguments, persuasions, ay, and even his entreaties.  Unfortunately, perhaps, for the fulfilment of his desires, I was born and brought up at Portsmouth; and all my earliest recollections of amusement are, in some way or other, connected with salt water.  Swimming and boating early became absolute passions with me; I was never quite happy unless I happened to be either in or on the water; _then_, indeed, all other pleasures were less than nothing to me.  As a natural consequence, I soon became the intimate companion of every boatman in the harbour; I acquired, to a considerable extent, their tastes and prejudices, and soon mastered all the nautical lore which it was in their power to teach me.  I could sail a boat before I could read; and by the time that I had learned to write, was able to hand, reef, and steer with the best of them.  My conversation--except when it was addressed to my father--was copiously interlarded with nautical phrases; and by the time I had attained the age of fourteen--at which period this history begins--I was not only acquainted with the name, place, and use of every rope and spar in a ship, but I had also an accurate knowledge of the various rigs, and a distinct opinion as to what constituted a good model.  The astute reader will have gathered from this confession that I was, from my earliest childhood, left pretty much my own master; and such was in fact the case.  My mother died in giving birth to my only sister Eva (two years my junior); a misfortune which, in consequence of my father's absorption in the duties of his practice, left me entirely to the care of the servants, by whom I was shamefully neglected.  But for this I should doubtless have been trained to obedience and a respectful deference to my father's wishes.  The mischief, however, was done; I had acquired a love of the sea, and my highest ambition was to become a naval officer.  This fact my father at length reluctantly recognised, and by persistent entreaty I finally prevailed upon him to take the necessary steps to gratify my heart's desire--with the result already known to the reader.  The sombre reflections induced by the thought of my father's disappointment did not, I confess with shame, last long.  They vanished as a morning mist is dissipated before the rising sun, when I recalled to mind that I was not only going to sea, but that I was actually going to sail in the _Daphne_.  This particular craft was my _beau-ideal_ of what a ship ought to be; and in this opinion I was by no means alone-- all my cronies hailing from the Hard agreeing, without exception, that she was far and away the handsomest and most perfect model they had ever seen.  My admiration of her was unbounded; and on the day of her launch--upon which occasion I cheered myself hoarse--I felt, as I saw her gliding swiftly and gracefully down the ways, that it would be a priceless privilege to sail in her, even in the capacity of the meanest ship-boy.  And now I was to be a midshipman on board her!  I hurried onward with swift and impatient steps, and soon passed through the dockyard gates--having long ago, by dint of persistent coaxing, gained the _entree_ to the sacred precincts--when a walk of some four or five hundred yards further took me to the berth alongside the wharf where she was lying.  Well as I knew every curve and line of her beautiful hull, my glances now dwelt upon her with tenfold loving interest.  She was a ship-sloop of 28 guns--long 18-pounders--with a flush deck"]]]
