The original ideals of a general colonial reform were now lost sight of; the men responsible for them had all passed off the stage; Grenville, Townshend, and Halifax were dead, and North, careless and subservient to George III, Hillsborough, Suffolk, Sandwich, and Rochford--all noblemen, and in many cases inefficient--did not see beyond the problem of coercing noisy and troublesome rioters, indistinguishable from the followers of Wilkes.  Over and over again they reiterated that the colonists' resentment was not to be feared, that they would submit to genuine firmness, that they were all cowardly and dared not resist a few regular troops.  Lord George Germaine earned the thanks of Lord North by declaring that the colonists were only \"a tumultuous and noisy rabble,\" men who ought to be \"following their mercantile employment and not attempting to govern.\"  Not a gleam of any other statesmanship appears in any of the Ministerial speeches than that displayed in the determination to exact complete submission.  There were passed, accordingly, by the full Ministerial majority, five measures known as {54} the Coercive Acts, or, in America, as the Five Intolerable Acts.  The first one punished Boston by closing the port to all trade until the offending town should recompense the East India Company for the tea destroyed.  The next altered the government of Massachusetts Bay by making the councillors appointive instead of elective, by placing the appointment and removal of all judicial officers entirely in the hands of the governor, by placing the selection of jurors in the hands of the sheriffs and prohibiting town-meetings--apart from the annual one to elect officers--without the governor's permission.  A third Act authorized the transfer to England for trial of British officers charged with murder committed while in discharge of their duties.  A fourth Act re-established the system of quartering troops.  The fifth Act reorganized the province of Quebec, whose government, under the Proclamation of 1763, had proved defective in several respects.  The legal institutions of the new colony were not well adapted to the mixed French and British inhabitants, and the religious situation needed definition.  The Quebec Act altered the government of the province by the creation of an appointive council, authorized the Catholic Church to collect tithes, and allow the French to substitute an oath of allegiance for the oath of {55} supremacy.  Moreover, French civil law was permitted to exist.  At the same time the boundaries of the province were extended into the region west of the mountains so as to include the lands north of the Ohio River.  With the passage of these Acts, the original causes for antagonism were superseded.  The commissioners of customs might have enforced the Navigation Acts indefinitely; the objectionable Tea Act might have stood permanently on the statute-book; but, without a more tangible grievance, it is not easy to conceive of the colonists actually beginning a revolution.  The time had now come when a more serious issue was raised than the right of Parliament to collect a revenue by a tariff in the colonies.  If Parliament was to be allowed to crush the prosperity of a colonial seaport, to centralize a hitherto democratic government created by a royal charter, and to remove royal officers from the scope of colonial juries, it was clear that the end of all the powers and privileges wrung from royal or proprietary governors by generations of struggle was at hand.  Yet the striking feature in this punitive legislation was that the North Ministry expected it to meet no resistance, although its execution, so far as the government of Massachusetts was concerned, rested on the consent of the colonists. There was, under the British {56} system, no administrative body capable of carrying out these laws, no military force except the few regiments in Boston, and no naval force beyond a few frigates and cruisers.  The mere passage of the laws, according to North and to Lord Mansfield, was sufficient to bring submission.  Nothing more clearly shows the profound ignorance of the Tory Ministry than this expectation, for it was instantly disappointed.  At the news of the Acts, the response from America was unanimous.  Already the colonial Whigs were well organized in committees of correspondence, and now they acted not merely in Massachusetts but in every colony.  The town of Boston refused to vote compensation, and was immediately closed under the terms of the Port Act.  Expressions of sympathy and gifts of provisions came pouring into the doomed community; while public meetings, legislatures, political leaders and clergymen, in chorus denounced the Acts as unconstitutional, cruel, and tyrannous.  The Quebec Act, extending the Catholic religion and French law into the interior valley under despotic government, was regarded as scarcely less sinister than the Regulating Act itself.  Under the efficient organization of the leaders a Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in October, 1774, to make united {57} protest. This body, comprising without exception the most influential men in the colonies, presented a clear contrast to Parliament in that every man was the representative of a community of freemen, self-governing and equal before the law.  The leaders did not regard themselves in any sense as revolutionaries.  They were simply delegates from the separate colonies, met to confer on their common dangers.  Their action consisted in the preparation of a petition to the King, addresses to the people of England, the people of Quebec, and the people of the colonies, but not to Parliament, since they denied its right to pass any such laws as those under complaint.  The Congress further drew up a declaration of rights which stated sharply the colonial claims, namely, that Parliament had no right to legislate for the internal affairs of the separate colonies.  It also adopted a plan for putting commercial pressure on England by forming an Association whose members pledged themselves to consume no English products, and organize committees in every colony to enforce this boycott.  The leaders in the body were destined to long careers of public prominence--such men as George Washington, Lee, and Patrick Henry of Virginia, Rutledge of South Carolina, Dickinson of Pennsylvania, Jay of New York, Samuel and John Adams of {58} Massachusetts.  They differed considerably in their temper, the Massachusetts men being far more ready for drastic words and deeds than the others; but they held together admirably.  If such protests as theirs could not win a hearing in England, it was hardly conceivable that any could.  Meanwhile the situation gave signs of being more explosive in reality than the respectful words of the Congress implied.  In Massachusetts, the town of Boston showed no sign of submitting, and endured distress and actual starvation, although much cheered by gifts of food from all parts of the continent.  The new government under the Regulating Act proved impossible to put into operation, for the popular detestation was visited in such insulting and menacing forms that the new councillors and judges dared not serve.  More radical action followed. When Gage, having caused the election of a legislature, prorogued it before it had assembled, the members none the less gathered.  Declaring that the Regulating Act was invalid, they elected a council, appointed a committee of safety, and named a receiver of taxes.  On February 1, 1775, a second Provincial Congress was chosen by the towns, which had not even a nominal sanction by the governor.  The colony was, in fact, in peaceful revolution, for Gage found himself unable to collect {59} taxes or to make his authority respected as governor beyond the range of his bayonets.  Equally significant was it that in several other colonies, where the governors failed to call the legislatures, provincial congresses or conventions were spontaneously elected to supervise the situation and choose delegates to the Continental Congress.  So deep was the popular anger in Massachusetts Bay that the collection of arms and powder and the organization of militia were rapidly begun. Clearly, the Massachusetts leaders were preparing to persist to the verge of civil war.  But by this time there began to be felt in the colonies a countercurrent of protest.  As the situation grew darker, and men talked openly of possible separation unless the intolerable wrongs were redressed, all those whose interests or whose loyalty revolted at the idea of civil war became alarmed at the danger.  Soon men of such minds began to print pamphlets, according to the fashion of the time, and to attempt to prevent the radicals from pushing the colonies into seditious courses.  But the position of these conservatives was exceedingly difficult, for they were obliged to apologize for the home country at a time when every act on the part of that country indicated a complete indifference to colonial prejudices. Their arguments against {60} revolution or independence left, after all, no alternative except submission.  Denounced as Tories by the hotter radicals, they found themselves at once more and more alarmed by the daring actions of the Whigs, and more detested by the excited people of their communities.  The action of the British government after these events showed no comprehension of the critical situation into which they were rushing. George III and North secured in the election of 1774 a triumphant majority of the Commons, and felt themselves beyond reach of danger at home.  The arguments of the colonists, the protests of the Continental Congress, fell upon indifferent ears.  Although Burke and Chatham exerted themselves with astonishing eloquence in the session of Parliament which began in November 1774, the Whig motions for conciliation were voted down by the full Ministerial majority."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21276"],["title","The Wars Between England and America (#7)"],["body","from merchants, who felt the pressure of the Non-importation Association, were shelved.  So far as the policy of the Ministry may be described, it consisted of legislation to increase the punishment of Massachusetts Bay and extend it to other colonies, and to offer a conditional exemption from Parliamentary taxation.  Both houses of Parliament declared Massachusetts Bay to be in rebellion, and voted to {61} crush all resistance.  An Act was passed on March 30, to restrain the trade of New England, shutting off all colonial vessels from the fisheries, and forbidding them to trade with any country but England or Ireland.  By a second Act, in April, this restriction was extended to all the colonies except New York and Georgia.  The only purpose of this Act was punitive.  Every step was fought by the Whig opposition, now thoroughly committed to the cause of the colonists, but their arguments had the inherent weakness of offering only a surrender to the colonists' position which the parliamentary majority was in no mood to consider.  In fact it was only with great difficulty and after a stormy scene that North induced his party to vote a so-called conciliatory proposition offering to abstain from taxing any colony which should make such a fixed provision for civil and judicial officers as would satisfy Parliament.  It was only a few days after the passage of the restraining Acts by Parliament that the long-threatened civil war actually broke out in Massachusetts.  General Gage, aware of the steady gathering of powder and war material by the revolutionary committee of safety, finally came to the conclusion that his position required him to break up these threatening bases of supplies.  On April 19, 1775, he sent out a force of 800 men to {62} Lexington and Concord--towns a few miles from Boston--with orders to seize or destroy provisions and arms.  They accomplished their purpose, after dispersing with musketry a squad of farmers at Lexington, but were hunted back to Boston by many times their number of excited \"minute men,\" who from behind fences and at every crossroad harassed their retreat.  A reinforcement of 1500 men enabled the raiding party to escape, but they lost over 800 men, and inflicted a total loss of only 90 in their flight.  Thus began the American Revolution, for the news of this day of bloody skirmishing, as it spread, started into flame the excitement of the colonial Whigs.  From the other New England colonies men sprang to arms, and companies marched to Boston, where they remained in rude blockade outside the town, unprovided with artillery or military organization, but unwilling to return to their homes.  From the hill-towns, a band of men surprised Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain, taking the cannon for use around Boston.  In every other colony militia were organized, officers chosen and arms collected, and almost everywhere, except in Quaker Pennsylvania and in proprietary Maryland, the governors and royal officials fled to the seacoast to take refuge in royal ships of war, or resigned their positions at the command {63} of crowds of armed \"minute men.\"  Conventions and congresses, summoned by committees of safety, were elected by the Whigs and assumed control of the colonies, following the example of Massachusetts.  The British colonial government, in short, crumbled to nothing in the spring of 1775.  Only Gage's force of a few regiments, shut up in Boston, and a few naval vessels, represented the authority of England in America.  Again there met a Continental Congress at Philadelphia, whose duty it was to unify colonial action and to give the colonial answer to the late parliamentary acts.  Once more the ablest men of the colonies were present, now gravely perturbed over the situation, and divided into two camps.  On the one hand, most of the New Englanders, led by Samuel Adams and John Adams, his cousin, felt that the time for parley was at an end, that nothing was to be hoped for from the North Ministry, and that the only reasonable step was to declare independence.  Others still hoped that George III would realize the extent of the crisis and be moved to concessions, while yet others, who hoped little, thought that one more effort should be made to avoid revolution.  But none dreamed of surrender.  Of the growing number of Americans who recoiled in horror from {64} the possibility of independence, and were beginning to show their dread in every way, not one was in this body.  It represented only the radicals in the several colonies.  The Congress has been charged with inconsistency, for some of its measures were impelled by the most radical members, others by the conservatives.  On the one hand, it declined to adopt a form of federation suggested by Franklin, and authorized Dickinson to draw up a final, respectful, almost obsequious petition to the King to avoid war--a document called the \"Olive Branch\"; but, on the other hand, it appointed Washington to command the troops near Boston as a Continental commander, adopted a report censuring the conciliatory proposition in bold language, and issued an address justifying with extravagant rhetoric the taking up of arms.  Still more daring, it went so far as to arrange to pay the so-called \"Continental army\" by means of bills of credit, redeemable by the united colonies.  Later, in 1775, it appointed a secret committee to correspond with friends abroad, and undertook extensive measures for raising troops and accumulating military stores.  To the revolted colonies, who found themselves with no legal authorities, it gave the advice to form such governments as would secure peace and good order during the continuance {65} of the existing dispute, a step which was promptly taken by several.  Fighting meanwhile went on.  General Gage, on June 17, undertook to drive from Charlestown, across the harbour from Boston, a body of about 1,500 provincial troops who had intrenched themselves on Breed's Hill. In all, about 3,000 British were brought to the attack, while gunboats raked the peninsula between Charlestown and the mainland, hindering the arrival of reinforcements.  With true British contempt for their adversaries, the lines of red-uniformed troops marched under the hot sun up the hill, to be met with a merciless fire at short range from the rifles, muskets, and fowling pieces of the defenders.  Two frontal attacks were thus repelled with murderous slaughter; but a third attack, delivered over the same ground, was pushed home, and the defenders were driven from their redoubt.  Never was a victory more handsomely won or more dearly bought.  The assailants lost not less than 1,000 out of 3,000 engaged, including 92 officers.  The Americans lost only 450, but that was almost as large a proportion.  It was obvious to any intelligent officer that the Americans might have been cut off from behind and compelled to surrender without being attacked; but Gage and his subordinates were anxious to teach the rebels a lesson.  The {66} result of this action, known in history as \"Bunker Hill,\" was to render him and nearly all the officers who served against Americans unwilling ever again to storm intrenchments.  They discovered that, as Putnam, who commanded part of the forces, observed, the militia would fight well if their legs were covered.  They were later to discover the converse, that with no protection militia were almost useless.  From this time the British force remained quietly in Boston, fed and supplied from England at immense cost, and making no effort to attack the miscellaneous levies which General Washington undertook to form into an army during the summer and autumn.  Nothing but the inaction of the British made it possible for Washington's command to remain, for they lacked powder, bayonets, horses and, most serious of all, they lacked all military conceptions.  The elementary idea of obedience was inconceivable to them.  Washington's irritation over the perfectly unconcerned democracy of the New Englanders was extreme; but he showed a wonderful patience and tenacity, and by sheer persistence began to create something like a military organization.  Yet, even after months of drill and work the army remained little more than an armed mob.  At length, in March, 1776, Washington managed to {67} place a force on Dorchester heights, which commanded the harbour from the south.  At first Gage had some idea of attacking, but storms intervened; and finally, without another blow, he evacuated the city and sailed with all his force to Halifax.  So ended a siege which ought never to have lasted a month had the British generals been seriously minded to break it up.  Other military events consisted of a few skirmishes in Virginia and North Carolina, where the governors managed to raise small forces of loyalists, who were thoroughly defeated by the Whig militia, and of a gallant but hopeless attempt by the rebels to capture Canada.  After some futile efforts on the part of Congress to induce the French to revolt, two bodies of men, in the autumn of 1775, made their way across the border.  One, entering Canada by way of Lake Champlain, occupied Montreal, and then advanced against Quebec, where it was joined by the other, which, with great hardships, had penetrated through the wilderness of northern Maine.  The commanders, Richard Montgomery, Benedict Arnold, and Daniel Morgan of Virginia, were men of daring, but their force, numbering not more than 1,000, was inadequate; and, after the failure of an effort to carry the place by surprise on the night of December 31--in which Montgomery was {68} killed and Morgan captured--they were unable to do more than maintain a blockade outside the fortress.  The action of the North Ministry during these months showed no deviation from its policy of enforcing submission.  The Olive Branch petition was refused a reception, and a proclamation was issued declaring the colonies in rebellion and warning all subjects"]]]
