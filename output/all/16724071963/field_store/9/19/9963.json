The pirates who had boarded us were of all nations, Spaniards, Portuguese, and French, and there were several Englishmen among them.  That their leader was one I could swear, for I heard him speaking English to several of the villains; and what is more, as he gave me a good opportunity of marking his features while I was bound to the mainmast, I should remember him were I ever to meet him again.\"  \"I hope that you may never fall in with him again under similar circumstances,\" remarked Mr Trunnion.  \"Should you do so, he will probably make you walk the plank before he begins discharging your cargo into his own craft.\"  While the mate was narrating his adventures I heard a strange race speaking in an authoritative tone in the outer office.  Suddenly the door was burst open, and a tall powerful man, dressed in riding-boots, his clothes bespattered with mud, yet having in other respects a nautical cut about him, entered the room.  Mr Trunnion gazed on him without speaking.  \"What, Tom! don't you know me?\" exclaimed the new-comer advancing and putting out his hand.  \"My beard has grown, and I have become somewhat sunburnt since we parted.\"  \"Bless my heart! is it you, Roderick?\" exclaimed Mr Trunnion.  \"I own that I did not recognise you, and was surprised at the intrusion of a stranger.\"  Roderick Trunnion, giving a laugh, threw himself into a chair opposite his brother, who reassumed his usual cold and dignified demeanour as he took his seat.  From my desk I could observe what was going forward.  I saw the mate start and narrowly scan the countenance of the new-comer with a look of extreme astonishment, while the latter, who did not appear to remark him, leaned forward and gazed at his brother, whose manner seemed to irritate him.  \"Where in the world have you come from, Roderick?\" asked Mr Trunnion.  \"From Falmouth last, where I left the `Vulture' to refit.  We met with a somewhat heavy gale, in which she was fearfully knocked about, and had we not kept the pumps going she would have foundered to a certainty.  As I wanted to see you and other friends; I took horse and rode night and day to get here.  The business I have got to speak of brooks of no delay, and is such as you and I can talk about best alone.\"  Turning round as he spoke, he cast a glance at Mr Magor.  For a moment, it seemed to me that his eye appeared to quail, but he quickly recovered himself.  \"Have you finished your business here?\" he asked in a bold tone, looking at the mate.  \"If so, you will leave me and your employer alone--for I presume that you are the master of one of his vessels.  And that youngster--you do not wish him to take down our conversation, I suppose,\" he added, first looking at me then round at his brother.  \"Really, Roderick, you have been so accustomed to command, that you forget that you are not on your own quarter-deck,\" observed Mr Trunnion, who was evidently annoyed at the authoritative tone assumed by his brother.  The mate rose and looked first at Mr Trunnion then at Captain Roderick.  \"I have met that man before,\" he said, \"and it is my duty to tell you when and how it was.  It was not long ago, on the high seas, when he boarded the `Arrow' at the head of--\"  Mr Trunnion, as the mate spoke, looked very much agitated, and I naturally fancied that something extraordinary was about to be said. Captain Roderick alone appeared perfectly cool.  Fixing his glance on the mate, he exclaimed in a loud tone, interrupting him--  \"You, my good fellow, may have met me half-a-dozen times for what I know to the contrary, or half-a-dozen men whom you may mistake for me, although I cannot say that I ever set eyes on you before.  However, go on and tell Mr Trunnion what I did when you fancy that you saw me, and I shall then know whether you are mistaken as to my identity.\"  The mate looked greatly confused.  \"I can only hope that I am mistaken, and unless Mr Trunnion desires me, I shall decline at present stating where, as I believe, I last saw you.\"  Mr Trunnion was silent for a minute, and seemed lost in thought. Suddenly looking up he said--  \"You have been suffering from fever, Mr Magor, and your recollection of events, very naturally, is somewhat clouded.  A few weeks' quiet and rest will restore your health.  I would advise you not to repeat what you have just said.  I'll send on board and relieve you of charge of the brig as soon as possible, and you can go to your friends in the country.\"  Mr Magor, making a nautical bow to Mr Trunnion, and giving another glance towards Captain Roderick, left the room.  \"Westerton,\" continued my employer, turning to me, \"you have heard all that has been said, and if it were repeated, although the poor man is under an hallucination, it might be the cause of disagreeable reports. You are discreet, I can trust you.  Let not a word on the subject escape your lips.  You can now go and finish those letters at your own desk.\"  I did as I was ordered, and gathering up the papers, followed the mate out of the room, leaving the two brothers together.  What followed, I of course cannot say.  For an hour or more they were closeted together.  At last Captain Roderick came out, and returned to the inn where he had put up his horse.  All I know is, that Mr Trunnion did not invite him to his house.  It seemed to me suspicious, and I could not help thinking about the matter, and wished that I could have consulted Harry Bracewell.  Two evenings afterwards we went to a party at the house of Mr Crank.  Shortly after we arrived, who should walk in but Captain Roderick.  By the way Mr Crank and Lucy received him, I felt convinced that Mr Trunnion had said nothing to prejudice the senior partner against him.  He made himself at home as usual, treating Miss Lucy with great deference, and it seemed to me that he was gaining ground in her good graces.  His appearance was greatly improved since the day I had seen him in the counting-house.  His face was carefully shaved, and his dress was such as to set off his well-made active figure.  His aim was evidently to play the agreeable, not only to the young lady of the house, but to all the ladies present, and with some--especially with the dowagers--he appeared to be as successful as he could desire.  He cast an indifferent glance now and then at me, as if he had never set eyes on me before, and appeared perfectly unconscious of the accusation--for such I considered it--brought against him by Mr Magor.  When I observed his apparent success with Lucy Crank, I felt a greater desire than ever to tell Harry what I had heard, and to advise him to warn her and her father of what I believed to be the real character of the man.  His brother, I supposed, from fraternal affection of family pride, had said nothing to his senior partner to warn him, and, of course, even to Harry I could not venture to say what I thought about Captain Trunnion.  I could only hope that Lucy would remain as indifferent to him as she had always before appeared to be, and that he would quickly again return to the \"Vulture.\" I was surprised, indeed, that he had ventured to be so long absent from his vessel, as his presence would be necessary while she was refitting. Perhaps, after all, his statements about her might not be true; she might not even be at Falmouth, although his mud-bespattered appearance on his arrival showed that he had ridden a long distance.    CHAPTER TWO.  CAPTAIN TRUNNION APPEARS OPENLY AT LIVERPOOL--HIS ATTENTIONS TO LUCY CRANK--HER AFFECTION FOR HARRY BRACEWELL--CAPTAIN TRUNNION EXHIBITS HIS JEALOUSY OF HARRY--SUSPECTING THE CAPTAIN'S EVIL INTENTIONS, I WATCH OVER HARRY--GODFREY MAGOR PLACED IN COMMAND OF THE \"ARROW\"--HARRY AND I APPOINTED SUPERCARGOES--ATTEND TO THE STOWAGE OF THE VESSEL--PREPARE FOR SAILING--FAREWELL TO LOVED ONES--VOYAGE COMMENCED.  Notwithstanding the very grave suspicion cast on him by the mate of the \"Arrow,\" Captain Roderick Trunnion did not immediately quit Liverpool, as I supposed he would have done.  He was, as far as I could judge, not on friendly terms with his brother, as he lived at an inn, although there was ample room for him at Mr Trunnion's house, where he seldom went, nor did he again appear at the office.  I met him, however, frequently walking about Liverpool, dressed in shoregoing clothes, booted and spurred, and carrying a riding-whip in his hand.  Notwithstanding, I should have known him at a glance to be a seaman.  I found also that he very frequently called at Mr Crank's residence at times when he well knew that the old gentleman would be at his counting-house.  I did not suppose, however, that he received any encouragement from Miss Lucy, but he always had some excuse for paying a visit, either to show some curiosity which he said he had brought from abroad, or to leave a book or other articles which he had obtained for her.  The fact was, that he had got into the good graces of Miss Deborah Crank, Mr Crank's maiden sister, who resided with him to look after Miss Lucy and keep his house in order.  I met the Captain there at two or three evening parties to which the Bracewells and I were invited, and on each occasion he was evidently paying court to the young lady.  When not with her, he was making himself agreeable to Miss Deborah.  Harry appeared to be in no way jealous or unhappy, which he would have been had he thought that Captain Roderick had the slightest chance of success.  \"We understand each other,\" he said, \"and she has assured me that she does not like him, though she cannot be rude to him while her father and aunt invite him to the house.\"  I did not like to make Harry unhappy by saying that I was not quite so certain about the matter as he was; at the same time I longed to be able to warn Miss Lucy of the character of the roan.  What surprised me was that Mr Trunnion should not have spoken to Mr Crank, or that the latter should not have thought it strange that Captain Roderick never came to the counting-house.  Probably"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21490"],["title","The Two Supercargoes; Or, Adventures in Savage Africa (#3)"],["body","Trunnion was influenced by fraternal feelings in not warning his partner of his suspicions regarding his brother's character. I did not, however, long entertain fears of Miss Lucy's affection for Harry, from a circumstance which he told me.  It was a holiday, and he had arranged to accompany her and her aunt on a visit to some friends in the country.  The coach was at the door waiting for Miss Deborah, who was upstairs, not yet having finished her toilet, while Lucy, who had finished dressing, was seated in the drawing-room with Harry by her side.  Suddenly the door opened, the young people expecting to see Miss Deborah enter.  What, therefore, was their surprise when Captain Roderick talked into the room.  He stood for a moment gazing fiercely at Harry.  \"What business have you here?\" he exclaimed in a voice hoarse with passion.  Harry wisely did not answer him; but Lucy, looking up and holding Harry's hand, said quietly--  \"Mr Bracewell has come to escort my aunt and me into the country, and I have good reason for the annoyance I feel at the question you have put to him.  My father is from home and will not return for some time, so I cannot invite you to wait for him.\"  Captain Roderick was not a man to be abashed even by the way Miss Lucy had addressed him.  Taking a turn or two in the room, he waited--so Harry thought--expecting Miss Deborah to come down-stairs and invite him to accompany them.  Lucy, suspecting his purpose, took Harry's arm and whispered, \"Let us go down to the carriage.\"  Miss Deborah, happening to look out of her window, saw them get in, and being just then ready, she joined them without going into the drawing-room.  Lucy, with much presence of mind, just before the carriage drove off, desired the servant, in a low voice which her aunt did not hear, to see Captain Roderick out of the house.  Whatever Captain Roderick might before have supposed, he now discovered to a certainty that Harry Bracewell was his rival.  When I heard the account just given, believing that the mate was right in his suspicions, I felt sure that, should he have an opportunity, he would revenge himself on my friend.  I told Harry all I could to warn him.  I said that I believed Captain Roderick was a bad, unprincipled man, whom no fear of consequences or any right feeling would restrain from committing an act of violence if he thought that it would further his object.  Harry merely laughed, and observed, \"When he finds that he has no chance of cutting me out he'll take himself off.  I should think his brother, who is so strict and correct in his conduct, would be very glad to get him away from Liverpool.\"  Knowing what dreadful deeds had been done by men of ill-regulated minds influenced by jealousy, I felt seriously anxious about Harry, lest Captain Roderick should find means to revenge himself.  Had I been able to explain the cause of the dread I had of him I might have convinced Harry of his danger, and induced him to be careful when going abroad at night; but I could only tell him that I suspected the man, and that I did not like him: Harry, however, though he had a true regard for me, either thought that I was mistaken or needlessly alarmed.  Sometimes I thought of telling my fears to Mr Trunnion, and asking permission from him to warn Harry Bracewell; but I knew that he would feel highly offended were I to speak on the subject to him.  I therefore, whenever Harry went out, made some excuse for accompanying him, especially when he went to Mr Crank's house.  On those occasions, instead of going in, I used to walk about in the neighbourhood, or sit down in an archway where the dark shadow concealed me from the view of passers-by.  On two different evenings I saw a person pass whom I felt sure by his figure was Captain Roderick.  The second time, when he stopped before Mr Crank's house, the light of the moon falling on his face revealed his features to me, and convinced me that I was not mistaken.  He was dressed as I first saw him at the counting-house, and he had a hanger by his side, and a brace of pistols in his belt, with a pair of riding-boots on, as if prepared for a journey.  Fearing that Harry might come out, and that his rival might attack him, I went up as if I was going to knock at the door; instead of which I stood in the porch, where, concealed, I could watch Captain Roderick. Perhaps he suspected that I had recognised him; for after waiting a minute, and looking up at the windows, he moved away, and I lost sight of him.  I waited until Harry came out, and then taking his arm, I hurried him along in an opposite direction to that which he would naturally have followed as the shortest way home.  \"Why are you going by this road?\" he asked.  \"I will tell you presently,\" I answered, continuing at a quick pace. \"Don't ask questions just now, for I really cannot answer you.\"  Harry did as I wished, and we therefore exchanged few word until we reached home.  \"Now,\" I said, \"I will tell you.  I am confident that Captain Roderick was waylaying you, and would either have sought a quarrel, or perhaps have cut you down with his hanger, or shot you.\"  Harry was at length inclined to believe that I was right, but still he added, \"Perhaps, after all, he maybe going away, and only came to take a last look at the house where Lucy lives; for, from what she tells me he said to her, I cannot help thinking that he must be desperately enamoured.\"  \"If he does go, well and good; but if he remains, I tell you, Harry, that I do not consider your life safe,\" I remarked.  \"I must beg your mother and sister to lock you up, and not let you go out at night until the fellow has gone.  He is a villain!\"  I repeated, in my eagerness almost revealing what I was bound to keep secret.  After this I saw no more of Captain Roderick.  Whether or not he had left Liverpool I was uncertain, but I hoped he had gone.  A few days afterwards, Mr Magor, the mate of the \"Arrow,\" came to the office, where he was received in a very friendly way by Mr Swab.  He looked completely changed.  The sickly hue had left his cheek, and he was stout and hearty, with the independent bearing of a seaman.  \"I am glad to see you looking so well, Mr Magor,\" said Mr Swab.  \"My partners and I have been talking the matter over; and from the way you brought the `Arrow' home, and the character you received from her late master, we are resolved to offer you the command.\"  \"Thank you, sir.  I am proud of your approval; and I may venture to say, as far as navigating a vessel, or handling her in fine weather or foul, I am as competent as most men.  I cannot boast, however, of my abilities as a trader, as I am no hand at keeping accounts.  In that respect, I do not think that I should do you Justice.\"  \"Well, well, Captain Magor; we cannot always expect to find a man like Captain Rig, who combined both qualifications.  We must therefore send a supercargo, or perhaps two, to help you; and I hope, with their assistance, that you will not be compelled to remain long up any of the rivers, and run the risk of losing your own life or of having your crew cut off by fever.  You must try and be away from the coast before the sickly season sets in.  It is by remaining up the rivers during the rains and hot weather that so many people die.\"  \"As to the hot weather, I don't know when it is not hot on the coast,\" observed Captain Magor, for so in future I may call him; \"but I am ready to brave any season in your service.  And I again thank you, sir, for the offer you make me, which I gladly accept, provided you supply me with the assistance you see I require.\"  \"We will try to do that,\" said Mr Swab.  \"Now, without loss of time, look out for a couple of good men as mates, and the best crew you can obtain, and get the vessel fitted out without delay.  I will accompany you on board and place you in command.\"  This was said in the outer office, where Henry and I overheard it.  \"I wonder to whom they will offer the berths,\" said Harry to me.  \"If I thought that it would advance me in the house, and enable me the sooner to speak to Mr Crank, I for one should be ready to accept an offer, although it would be a sore trial to go away.  I had never dreamed of doing so; but yet, if I was asked, I would not refuse, as, of course, it could not fail to give one a lift; whereas, should I refuse, I should fall in the estimation of the partners.\"  The very next day Mr Crank desired Harry and me to come into his inner room, and he then told us, what we already knew, that the firm intended to send out two supercargoes, who might assist each other, and asked if we would go, promising us each a share in the profits of the voyage, and advancement in the house on our return.  \"I do not hide from you that there is danger from the climate, and in some places from the natives; but the vessel will be well armed, and you must exert all the judgment and discretion you possess.  You are both young and strong, and have never tampered with your constitutions, so that you are less likely to succumb to the climate than the generality of seamen.\"  He then entered fully into the subject, telling us how to act under various circumstances, and giving us full directions for our guidance.  We did not appear very elated at the offer, but accepted it, provided Harry's mother and my parents did not object.  \"Tell them all I have said,\" observed Mr Crank, \"and let me know to-morrow, that should you refuse our offer I may look out for two other young men who have no family ties to prevent them from going.  Our interests should, I think, be considered in the matter.\"  I judged by the tone of the senior partner's voice that he would be offended should we refuse his offer, and we therefore made up our minds to press the matter with those who had to decide for us.  Of course we talked it over as we walked home that evening.  We both fancied that we should be absent little more than five months, and that we should come back with"]]]
