At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18-,       I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum,       in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back       library, or book-closet, _au troisième_, No. 33, _Rue Dunôt,       Faubourg St. Germain_. For one hour at least we had maintained a       profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have       seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies       of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For       myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which       had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier       period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and       the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogêt. I looked upon       it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of       our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance,       Monsieur G——, the Prefect of the Parisian police.        We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much       of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we       had not seen him for several years. We had been sitting in the       dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but       sat down again, without doing so, upon G.‘s saying that he had       called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend,       about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of       trouble.        “If it is any point requiring reflection,” observed Dupin, as he       forebore to enkindle the wick, “we shall examine it to better       purpose in the dark.”        “That is another of your odd notions,” said the Prefect, who had       a fashion of calling every thing “odd” that was beyond his       comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of       “oddities.”        “Very true,” said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe,       and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.        “And what is the difficulty now?” I asked. “Nothing more in the       assassination way, I hope?”        “Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very       simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it       sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like       to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively odd.”        “Simple and odd,” said Dupin.        “Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all       been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet       baffles us altogether.”        “Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at       fault,” said my friend.        “What nonsense you do talk!” replied the Prefect, laughing       heartily.        “Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,” said Dupin.        “Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?”        “A little too self-evident.”        “Ha! ha! ha—ha! ha! ha!—ho! ho! ho!” roared our visitor,       profoundly amused, “oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!”        “And what, after all, is the matter on hand?” I asked.        “Why, I will tell you,” replied the Prefect, as he gave a long,       steady and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair.       “I will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me       caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest       secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now       hold, were it known that I confided it to any one.”        “Proceed,” said I.        “Or not,” said Dupin.        “Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very       high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has       been purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who       purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take       it. It is known, also, that it still remains in his possession.”        “How is this known?” asked Dupin.        “It is clearly inferred,” replied the Prefect, “from the nature       of the document, and from the non-appearance of certain results       which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber’s       possession; that is to say, from his employing it as he must       design in the end to employ it.”        “Be a little more explicit,” I said.        “Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its       holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is       immensely valuable.” The Prefect was fond of the cant of       diplomacy.        “Still I do not quite understand,” said Dupin.        “No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who       shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a       personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder       of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage       whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.”        “But this ascendancy,” I interposed, “would depend upon the       robber’s knowledge of the loser’s knowledge of the robber. Who       would dare—”        “The thief,” said G., “is the Minister D——, who dares all things,       those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of       the theft was not less ingenious than bold. The document in       question—a letter, to be frank—had been received by the personage       robbed while alone in the royal boudoir. During its perusal she       was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted       personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.       After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she       was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The       address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus       unexposed, the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the       Minister D——. His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper,       recognises the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion       of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some       business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he       produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens       it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close       juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen       minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he       takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim.       Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention       to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at       her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving his own letter—one of       no importance—upon the table.”        “Here, then,” said Dupin to me, “you have precisely what you       demand to make the ascendancy complete—the robber’s knowledge of       the loser’s knowledge of the robber.”        “Yes,” replied the Prefect; “and the power thus attained has, for       some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very       dangerous extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly       convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter.       But this, of course, cannot be done openly. In fine, driven to       despair, she has committed the matter to me.”        “Than whom,” said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, “no       more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even       imagined.”        “You flatter me,” replied the Prefect; “but it is possible that       some such opinion may have been entertained.”        “It is clear,” said I, “as you observe, that the letter is still       in possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and       not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With       the employment the power departs.”        “True,” said G.; “and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first       care was to make thorough search of the minister’s hotel; and       here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching       without his knowledge. Beyond all things, I have been warned of       the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect       our design.”        “But,” said I, “you are quite au fait in these investigations.       The Parisian police have done this thing often before.”        “Oh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of       the minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently       absent from home all night. His servants are by no means       numerous. They sleep at a distance from their master’s apartment,       and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have       keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet       in Paris. For three months a night has not passed, during the       greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in       ransacking the D—— Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to mention       a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the       search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a       more astute man than"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2148"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 2 (#1)"],["body","self. I fancy that I have investigated       every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible       that the paper can be concealed.”        “But is it not possible,” I suggested, “that although the letter       may be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he       may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?”        “This is barely possible,” said Dupin. “The present peculiar       condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues       in which D—— is known to be involved, would render the instant       availability of the document—its susceptibility of being produced       at a moment’s notice—a point of nearly equal importance with its       possession.”        “Its susceptibility of being produced?” said I.        “That is to say, of being destroyed,” said Dupin.        “True,” I observed; “the paper is clearly then upon the premises.       As for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider       that as out of the question.”        “Entirely,” said the Prefect. “He has been twice waylaid, as if       by footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own       inspection.”        “You might have spared yourself this trouble,” said Dupin. “D——,       I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have       anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course.”        “Not altogether a fool,” said G., “but then he’s a poet, which I       take to be only one remove from a fool.”        “True,” said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his       meerschaum, “although I have been guilty of certain doggrel       myself.”        “Suppose you detail,” said I, “the particulars of your search.”        “Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched _everywhere_.       I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire       building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to       each. We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We       opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a       properly trained police agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is       impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a ‘secret’ drawer to       escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There       is a certain amount of bulk—of space—to be accounted for in every       cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line       could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The       cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me       employ. From the tables we removed the tops.”        “Why so?”        “Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece       of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an       article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within       the cavity, and the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of       bedposts are employed in the same way.”        “But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?” I asked.        “By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient       wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we       were obliged to proceed without noise.”        “But you could not have removed—you could not have taken to       pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been       possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter       may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in       shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it       might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did       not take to pieces all the chairs?”        “Certainly not; but we did better—we examined the rungs of every       chair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every       description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful       microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we       should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain of       gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple.       Any disorder in the glueing—any unusual gaping in the       joints—would have sufficed to insure detection.”        “I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the       plates, and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as       the curtains and carpets.”        “That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every       particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house       itself. We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we       numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each       individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two       houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before.”        “The two houses adjoining!” I exclaimed; “you must have had a       great deal of trouble.”        “We had; but the reward offered is prodigious!”        “You include the grounds about the houses?”        “All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively       little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and       found it undisturbed.”        “You looked among D——‘s papers, of course, and into the books of       the library?”        “Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only       opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume,       not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the       fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the       thickness of every book-cover, with the most accurate       admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of       the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled       with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should       have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the       hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with       the needles.”        “You explored the floors beneath the carpets?”        “Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards       with the microscope.”        “And the paper on the walls?”        “Yes.”        “You looked into the cellars?”        “We did.”        “Then,” I said, “you have been making a miscalculation, and the       letter is not upon the premises, as you suppose.”        “I fear you are right there,” said the Prefect. “And now, Dupin,       what would you advise me to do?”        “To make a thorough re-search of the premises.”        “That is absolutely needless,” replied G——. “I am not more sure       that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.”        “I have no better advice to give you,” said Dupin. “You have, of       course, an accurate description of the letter?”        “Oh yes!”—And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book,       proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and       especially of the external appearance of the missing document.       Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his       departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever       known the good gentleman before.        In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found       us occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and       entered into some ordinary conversation. At length I said,—        “Well, but G——, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have       at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as       overreaching the Minister?”        “Confound him, say I—yes; I made the re-examination, however, as       Dupin suggested—but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would       be.”        “How much was the reward offered, did you say?” asked Dupin.        “Why, a very great deal—a very liberal reward—I don’t like to say       how much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn’t       mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any       one who could obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming       of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been       lately doubled. If it were trebled, however, I could do no more       than I have done.”        “Why, yes,” said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his       meerschaum, “I really—think, G——, you have not exerted       yourself—to the utmost in this matter. You might—do a little       more, I think, eh?”        “How?—in what way?”        “Why—puff, puff—you might—puff, puff—employ counsel in the       matter, eh?—puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell       of Abernethy?”        “No; hang Abernethy!”        “To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a       certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this       Abernethy for a medical opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an       ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his       case to the physician, as that of an imaginary individual.        “‘We will suppose,’ said the miser, ‘that his symptoms are such       and such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?’        “‘Take!’ said Abernethy, ‘why, take advice, to be sure.’”        “But,” said the Prefect, a little discomposed, “I am perfectly       willing to take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give       fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.”        “In that case,” replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a       check-book, “you may as well fill me up a check for the amount       mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.”        I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely       thunder-stricken. For some minutes he remained speechless and       motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth,       and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then,       apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen,       and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up"]]]
