Meanwhile, in the boat-house, we had stripped for action and launched our boat.  As we were ready to put off, and make for the starting-point, Mr Blunt came up and said to Blades, our \"stroke\",--  \"Now remember, row a steady stroke all through.  Don't be flurried if they get the best of the start.  If you can stick to them the first half of the way, you ought to be able to row them down in the last; and mind, Adams,\" he said, addressing me, \"don't let them force you out of your straight course, and don't waste time in trying to bother them.  Keep as straight as an arrow, and you can't go wrong.\"  As our fellows put off for the starting-place, their long clean stroke elicited no little admiration from the onlookers, who saw much in it that augured well for the success of our boat.  Thanks to Mr Blunt, our crew had learned to master that steady, strong sweep of the oars which is universally admitted to be the perfection of rowing style and the most serviceable of all strokes.  Rowed well through from first to last, gripping the water the instant the oar is back and the body and arms forward, and dragged clean through without jerk or plunge, the swing of the bodies regular as clockwork, the feather clear and rapid--this essentially is the kind of rowing which not only puts most pace into the boat, but is capable of being sustained far longer than any other.  Not long after us our opponents embarked, and we had an opportunity of criticising their style as they paddled up to where we lay waiting for them.  It certainly looked pretty and taking.  The stroke was quicker than ours, and equally regular, but it seemed to end in a spasmodic jerk as the oars left the water, which, though it succeeded in making the boat travel quickly, appeared to try the powers of the rowers rather more than our style did.  Still, there was no mistaking that they were a fast and a powerful crew, and I remember to this day the passing thought, \"I wish we were at the end of it!\" that flashed through my mind as I gathered my rudder lines together, ready for the start.  Mr Blunt is to act as starter, and is coming towards us in a boat, with his watch in his hand.  Our rivals' boat is lying close beside ours, and I can see their stroke is leaning forward and saying something to the coxswain.  I wonder it it's about me?  Perhaps he is telling him to push me out of my course, or perhaps they are saying how nervous I am looking!  Well, I _am_ nervous.  I begin to think I shall forget which way I have to go.  Perhaps I shall pull the right-hand line instead of the left; or possibly I shall omit to pull either line at all!  What lasting disgrace will then be mine!  Then suddenly I remember what Mr Blunt said, that it's all up with a race if the \"cox\" loses his head, and by a violent effort I banish my qualms, and resolve, come what may, _nothing_ shall unsteady me.  Still, my hands tremble as I grasp the lines.  \"Adams,\" says Blades, \"make my stretcher fast, will you?\"  The voice of a human being close to me, somehow, has the effect of helping me to recover my wits completely; and as I kneel and make fast the stretcher, and then once again take my seat in the stern of the boat, I feel quite myself again, and wonder at myself for being such an ass.  \"Back water half a stroke!\" calls out Mr Blunt to us from his skiff.  We obey him, and then find the other boat is a little in front of us. We therefore move a quarter of a stroke forward.  Still the boats are not quite level.  The other boat must come back a foot or two.  Not quite enough; our boat must advance a few inches.  There, now they are level.  \"Are you ready?\"  No, our boat has drifted forward again, and must be moved back.  All this takes time, but presently we are once again level, and the question is repeated--  \"Are you ready?\"  The only answer this time is the leaning forward of both crews, with arms stretched and oars well back, in readiness for the signal.  What ages it seems!  And there I actually the wind has blown our rivals' bows across the stream, and before we start another two minutes must be spent in manoeuvring her back into position.  Once again--  \"Are you ready?\"  No answer, save the quick reach forward and silent suspense.  \"Then go!\" and I feel the boat half lifted in the water under me.  The first stroke is rather a scramble, and so is the second, but by the third the boat has begun to get its \"way\" on, and in a stroke or two more our men have settled down to their customary swing.  But what of our opponents?  At the first stroke their boat had dashed away an inch or two in advance of ours, at the third that distance had become a foot, and presently they were far enough ahead to enable me to catch sight of their coxswain's back.  As we both settled down to work, they were rowing at a considerably quicker pace than we, wrenching the boat forward at each stroke, and inch by inch improving their advantage.  All this I noticed before the shout with which the spectators hailed the start had died away.  I had a dim vision of a body of runners starting along with us on the banks, and of eager cries to one crew or the other from sympathising onlookers; but I had enough to do to keep my eye fixed ahead, without gaping at the crowd.  Remembering Mr Blunt's advice, I selected a landmark in front, and steered our course direct for it; a plan of which I had cause to be glad pretty early in the race.  For the Old Boys' boat, drawing steadily ahead to about half a boat's length, began very gradually to insinuate its nose a little over in our direction, so that, had I not had a fixed point on which to steer, I should have been strongly tempted to give way unwittingly before it, and so abandon an inch or two of the water that fairly belonged to our boat.  As it was, however, I was able both to detect and defeat this manoeuvre, for, keeping on a perfectly straight course, the others were obliged to draw in their horns, and return to a straight course too, having lost some little ground in the process. Still, they seemed to be forging ahead, and the shouts from the banks announced that thus far, at any rate the Parkhurst boat was getting the worst of it.  I stole a look at Blades.  His face was composed and unconcerned, and it was easy to see he knew what he was about.  He kept up his long steady swing, being well backed up by the three men behind him, and lifted the boat well at the beginning of the stroke, never letting it down till the end.  I could see that he knew exactly how far the others were ahead, and at what rate they were rowing; and yet he neither quickened nor altered his stroke, but plodded on with such a look of easy confidence that I at once felt quite satisfied in my own mind as to the result.  It was not long before our opponents gave indication of abating somewhat the quick stroke they had hitherto maintained, and by virtue of which they had already got nearly a boat's length ahead.  At the same moment Blades slightly quickened his stroke, and instantly our boat began to crawl up alongside that of our rivals, amid the frantic cheers of the onlookers.  Slowly and surely we forged ahead, till our stroke's oar was level with their coxswain.  Then a spurt from the Old Boys kept the two boats abreast for a few seconds, but it died away after a little, and once more their boat travelled slowly back, as we drew level, and began in our turn to take the lead.  Now was our time to--  What is that ahead on the water, drifting right across the bows of our boat?  A shout from the banks apprises me that others besides myself have taken the sudden alarm.  An empty boat, insecurely moored to the bank, has got adrift, and is calmly floating up with the tide in mid- stream along our very course!  What is to be done?  The other boat, being on the opposite side, can easily clear the obstacle, but not so ours.  Either we must put our bows across our enemy's water, and so run the risk of a \"foul,\" and consequent defeat, or else we must lose ground by slackening our pace and going out of our course to avoid the unlucky boat.  There are not ten seconds in which to decide; but that suffices me to choose the latter alternative, trusting to the rowing powers of our crew to make up the disadvantage.  \"Look to your oars, stroke side!\"  I cry, and at the same time pull my rudder line quickly.  It was as I expected.  The boat lost ground instantly, and I could see, out of the corner of my eye, the Old Boys' boat shoot forward with a quickened stroke, and hear the triumphant shouts of their partisans.  A second or two sufficed to get past the obstructing boat, our oars on the stroke side just scraping it as we did so; but as we headed again into our proper course, we saw our opponents two clear boats' lengths in front, their men pulling with all the energy of triumph and confidence.  It was a sight to make one despair.  How were we ever to make up that tremendous gap?  \"How much?\"  Blades inquires, as he swings forward towards me.  \"Two!\"  I reply.  He sets his face determinedly, and quickens his stroke.  The men behind him do not at first get into the altered swing, and for a moment or two the rowing is scrambling, and our boat rolls unsteadily, a spectacle hailed with increased joy by the partisans of the Old Boys' boat.  \"Steady now!\" cries Blades, over his shoulder, and next moment the boat rights itself; the four oars dip and feather simultaneously.  I, sitting in the stern, can feel the swing as of one man, and the boat dashes forward like a machine.  Our fellows on the banks mark the change and cheer tremendously.  \"Well spurted, Parkhurst!\"  \"Put it on now!\"  \"You're gaining!\"  \"Rowed indeed!\"  Such were the cries which, as I heard them, set my blood tingling with excitement.  It was a long time before any perceptible gain was noticeable from where I sat.  The Old Boys had taken advantage of their lead to come across into our water, and all I could see of them was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21137"],["title","Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life (#5)"],["body"," blades of their oars on in front, which rose and fell swiftly and with a regular beat.  Still the shout from the bank was, \"You're gaining!\" and presently I saw their boat edging off again into their own water, by which I concluded we had pulled up sufficiently to make this necessary to avoid a foul.  Our men pulled splendidly.  Cool, determined, and plucky, each rowed his best, his eyes fixed on the back of the man before him, keeping perfect time, and pulling each stroke through with terrible energy.  I could see by their pale looks that they shared the common excitement, but there was no sign of flurry or distress, nothing but a quiet determination, which augured better for the result of their efforts than all the shouts of the onlookers.  Where are we now?  Those willows on my left are, I know, just half a mile from the winning-post.  Shall we, in that distance, be able to pull up the length which now divides us and our rivals?  There is a chance yet!  The leading boat is not going as fast as it was a minute ago.  I can tell that by the eddies from their oars which sweep past.  \"How much?\" inquired Blades again, as he swung forward.  \"One!\"  I replied.  I could see by the gleam in his eyes that he had hope still of making that one length nothing before the winning-post was reached.  That shout from the bank means something, surely!  \"Well rowed indeed, Parkhurst!\"  \"They're overlapped!\"  Yes, those who could see it were watching the little pink flag at the prow of our boat creeping, inch by inch, up the stern of our rivals'. The eddies from their oars came past nearer now, and the \"thud\" of their outriggers sounded closer.  Yes, we are gaining without doubt; but shall we overtake them in time to avoid defeat?  I can see a mass of people ahead on the banks, and know that they are gathered opposite the winning-post.  It can't be a quarter of a mile off now!  Again that shout from the bank.  Ah, yes, our bow oar is level with their stroke.  \"Now you have it!\" shout our fellows.  Blades turns his head for half a second, and cries to his men as he quickens up to his final spurt.  What a shout then rent the air!  Our boat no longer crawled up beside the Old Boys, but began to fly.  On, on!  Their coxswain seems to be gliding backwards towards me.  In vain they attempt to answer our spurt; they have not the rowing left in them to do it.  Nothing can stop us! In another moment we are abreast, and almost instantly there come such cheers after cheers from the bank that even the dash of the oars was drowned in it.  \"Parkhurst's ahead!\"  \"Ah, well rowed!\"  \"Now, Old Boys!\"  \"It's a win!\"  On, on!  What sensation so glorious, so madly exciting, as that of one of the crew of a winning boat within twenty yards of the goal?  I am tempted to shout, to wave my hat, to do something ridiculous, but I set my teeth and sit still, holding my breath.  Four strokes more will do it.  One!  I am level with the stroke of the Old Boys' boat.  Two!  Our fellows pull as if they had another half-mile to go still.  Three!  The judge at the winning-post is lifting his hand and cocking his pistol. Four!  Crack goes the signal! and as our men cease rowing, and the boat shoots forward with the impetus of that last terrific stroke, amid the cheers and shouts of the assembled crowd, I breathe again, knowing that the Parkhurst boat has won, by three yards, the grandest race in which it was ever my lot to take part.    CHAPTER FOUR.  PARKHURST VERSUS WESTFIELD.  \"Now, Parkhurst, turn out sharp!  They are going in first.\"  So shouted Steel, the captain of our eleven, putting his head in at the door of the tent in which we were arraying ourselves in flannels and spiked shoes, and otherwise arming for the great match against Westfield School, which was now about to commence.  We always looked upon these Westfield fellows as our most dangerous rivals on the cricket field (much in the light in which we esteemed Craven where football was concerned), and the match in which our respective pretensions were yearly settled was, I need hardly say, regarded as _the_ match of the season, and made the object of untiring practice and feverish excitement.  Year after year, for twelve years, our rival elevens had met, always on the last Saturday of June, one year at Parkhurst and the next at Westfield, and so far the result had been that each school had won six matches.  Fancy then the state of our feelings this year, as we started off in the early morning on our omnibus from Parkhurst, to engage in the decisive contest which (unless it ended in a draw) must turn the balance either in favour of our school, or to the glorification of our rivals. We could not bear to think of the possibility of a defeat; it would be too tragical, too shameful.  So as we drove over to Westfield that morning, we talked of nothing but victory, and felt very like those determined old Spartans who, when they went to the wars, made a vow they would return either with their shields or on them.  Of course there was a regular swarm of people to see the match.  Old Parkhurst \"bats,\" who had played in the first match, thirteen years ago, were there, with big beards, and very majestic to look at; Old Boys, now settled in life, were there with their wives and children; carriages full of our own and Westfield's fathers and mothers; and shoals of young brothers and sisters, crammed the space beyond the flags; the \"doctors,\" as usual, had driven over; and almost gave offence to some of our most enthusiastic partisans by \"chumming up\" publicly with the head master of our rivals!  And then, besides, there was a host of outsiders, drawn together by simple curiosity or love of cricket; so that altogether, as we emerged from our tent in our snow-white flannels and pink belts, we felt that the eyes of the world were upon us, and were more convinced than ever that anything short of victory would be the most terrible of all calamities which could fall on our youthful heads.  Our great hope was in Steel, our captain, one of the best cricketers Parkhurst had ever produced; and for coolness and self-confidence without his equal anywhere.  We all adored him, for he never snubbed youngsters, or made light of their doings.  If, during practice, a fellow bowled, batted, or fielded well, Steel took care to encourage him; but if any one played carelessly, or bungled, Steel scowled, and that unlucky man's name disappeared for a season from the list of candidates for a place in the first eleven.  See him now stroll up to the wickets, with his wicket-keeping pads on, talking on the way to one of the two men who are to officiate first with their bats on behalf of Westfield.  We youngsters can't understand such coolness, and keep our eyes on him, as if every moment we expected to see him fell his rival to the earth. It's a great matter to be used to a thing.  I, who was now making my first appearance in the first eleven, felt as if the world began, continued, and ended within the area of this Westfield meadow; but here was some one who, to all appearances, made no more of the great match than he would of his dinner.  But away now with all thoughts but cricket!  The ball we have been tossing about idly is taken into custody by the umpire; Steel is behind the wickets, looking round to see if we fielders are all in our places, and motioning one or two of us to stand deeper or closer in, as he deems advisable.  The Westfield batsman who is to receive the first over is getting \"middle\"; our bowler is tucking up his sleeves, and gripping the brand-new ball in his hand; the ground-keeper is chasing a few small boys back behind the ropes; and the scorers in the big tent are dipping their pens in the ink.  Altogether, it is a critical moment in my life--a moment that seems as long as a whole day.  \"Play!\" cries the umpire; and our bowler delivers his first ball--not a very alarming one, and evidently meant more as a test of the ball and the pitch than as a serious attack on the enemy's wicket.  My readers of course do not expect me to give a full, true, and particular account of every ball bowled on that eventful day.  That would be as tedious for them as for me.  But I shall do my best to recall the chief features of the game as they presented themselves to me from my post, first at cover-point, and (while our side was batting) from the tent and the wickets.  The first few overs were not eventful.  They rarely are.  Our men had to get used to the ground and the ball; and the batsmen chose to be exceedingly careful how they hit out at first.  In the third over a single run was made, and of course the Westfield fellows cheered as if the match were already won.  Then gradually came one or two more singles, a two, another one, a three, and then, just as the two batsmen were getting into good humour and fancying they might lay about them a little more freely, down went the first wicket amid the cheers of our fellows, and we saw the figures 12 posted up on the telegraph, as indicating the score so far standing to the credit of Westfield.  We had not long to wait for the next man in, and still less long to see him out, poor fellow! for the very first ball sent his bails flying over Steel's head, and he had to trudge back to the tent and take off his pads almost before he had got used to the feel of them on his legs.  In the over following the arrival of his successor an easy catch by point disposed of another wicket.  \"This is something like!\"  I exclaimed to myself.  \"Three men out for fourteen runs.  If it goes on like this, we shall have it all our own way\"; and in my satisfaction I ventured to communicate my ideas to the man fielding at point.  \"Adams, will you attend to the game?\"  It was Steel who spoke, and at the sound of his voice I started like one shot, and discovered that the next man was in and ready to begin.  I stepped back to my place in an instant, and would sooner have had one of Hurley's swiftest balls catch me"]]]
