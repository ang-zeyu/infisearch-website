It ran:          As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.        The word “moor” only was printed in ink.        “Now,” said Sir Henry Baskerville, “perhaps you will tell me, Mr.       Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is       that takes so much interest in my affairs?”        “What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there       is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?”        “No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was       convinced that the business is supernatural.”        “What business?” asked Sir Henry sharply. “It seems to me that       all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own       affairs.”        “You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir       Henry. I promise you that,” said Sherlock Holmes. “We will       confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this       very interesting document, which must have been put together and       posted yesterday evening. Have you yesterday’s _Times_, Watson?”        “It is here in the corner.”        “Might I trouble you for it—the inside page, please, with the       leading articles?” He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes       up and down the columns. “Capital article this on free trade.       Permit me to give you an extract from it.       ‘You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or      your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but      it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run      keep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of our      imports, and lower the general conditions of life in this island.’        “What do you think of that, Watson?” cried Holmes in high glee,       rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. “Don’t you think       that is an admirable sentiment?”        Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional       interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark       eyes upon me.        “I don’t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,”       said he, “but it seems to me we’ve got a bit off the trail so far       as that note is concerned.”        “On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail,       Sir Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do,       but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of       this sentence.”        “No, I confess that I see no connection.”        “And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection       that the one is extracted out of the other. ‘You,’ ‘your,’       ‘your,’ ‘life,’ ‘reason,’ ‘value,’ ‘keep away,’ ‘from the.’ Don’t       you see now whence these words have been taken?”        “By thunder, you’re right! Well, if that isn’t smart!” cried Sir       Henry.        “If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that       ‘keep away’ and ‘from the’ are cut out in one piece.”        “Well, now—so it is!”        “Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have       imagined,” said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement.       “I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a       newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came       from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable       things which I have ever known. How did you do it?”        “I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from       that of an Esquimau?”        “Most certainly.”        “But how?”        “Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious.       The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve,       the—”        “But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally       obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the       leaded bourgeois type of a _Times_ article and the slovenly print       of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your       negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the       most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in       crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I       confused the _Leeds Mercury_ with the _Western Morning News_. But       a _Times_ leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could       have been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the       strong probability was that we should find the words in       yesterday’s issue.”        “So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,” said Sir Henry       Baskerville, “someone cut out this message with a scissors—”        “Nail-scissors,” said Holmes. “You can see that it was a very       short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips       over ‘keep away.’”        “That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of       short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste—”        “Gum,” said Holmes.        “With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word ‘moor’       should have been written?”        “Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all       simple and might be found in any issue, but ‘moor’ would be less       common.”        “Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything       else in this message, Mr. Holmes?”        “There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have       been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is       printed in rough characters. But the _Times_ is a paper which is       seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We       may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an       educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his       effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing       might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will       observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but       that some are much higher than others. ‘Life,’ for example is       quite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or       it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter.       On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was       evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such       a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the       interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any       letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he       would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption—and       from whom?”        “We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,” said Dr.       Mortimer.        “Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and       choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the       imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to       start our speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt,       but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a       hotel.”        “How in the world can you say that?”        “If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and       the ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered       twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short       address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle.       Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such       a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. But       you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get       anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that       could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around       Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated _Times_       leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent       this singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What’s this?”        He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words       were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.        “Well?”        “Nothing,” said he, throwing it down. “It is a blank half-sheet       of paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have       drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir       Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you       have been in London?”        “Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.”        “You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?”        “I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,”       said our visitor. “Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch       me?”        “We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us       before we go into this matter?”        “Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.”        “I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth       reporting.”        Sir Henry smiled. “I don’t know much of British life yet, for I       have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I       hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary       routine of life over here.”        “You have lost one of your boots?”        “My dear sir,” cried Dr. Mortimer, “it is only mislaid. You will       find it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of       troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?”        “Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.”        “Exactly,” said Holmes, “however foolish the incident may seem.       You have lost one of your boots, you say?”        “Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last       night, and there was only one in the morning. I could get no       sense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I       only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never       had them on.”        “If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be       cleaned?”"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2852"],["title","The Hound of the Baskervilles (#7)"],["body","        “They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I       put them out.”        “Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you       went out at once and bought a pair of boots?”        “I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with       me. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the       part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways       out West. Among other things I bought these brown boots—gave six       dollars for them—and had one stolen before ever I had them on my       feet.”        “It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,” said Sherlock       Holmes. “I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer’s belief that it       will not be long before the missing boot is found.”        “And, now, gentlemen,” said the baronet with decision, “it seems       to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I       know. It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full       account of what we are all driving at.”        “Your request is a very reasonable one,” Holmes answered. “Dr.       Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story       as you told it to us.”        Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his       pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the       morning before. Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest       attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.        “Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,”       said he when the long narrative was finished. “Of course, I’ve       heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery. It’s the pet       story of the family, though I never thought of taking it       seriously before. But as to my uncle’s death—well, it all seems       boiling up in my head, and I can’t get it clear yet. You don’t       seem quite to have made up your mind whether it’s a case for a       policeman or a clergyman.”        “Precisely.”        “And now there’s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I       suppose that fits into its place.”        “It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what       goes on upon the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer.        “And also,” said Holmes, “that someone is not ill-disposed       towards you, since they warn you of danger.”        “Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me       away.”        “Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted       to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which       presents several interesting alternatives. But the practical       point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or       is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.”        “Why should I not go?”        “There seems to be danger.”        “Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger       from human beings?”        “Well, that is what we have to find out.”        “Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell,       Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me       from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to       be my final answer.” His dark brows knitted and his face flushed       to a dusky red as he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper       of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last       representative. “Meanwhile,” said he, “I have hardly had time to       think over all that you have told me. It’s a big thing for a man       to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like       to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look       here, Mr. Holmes, it’s half-past eleven now and I am going back       right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson,       come round and lunch with us at two. I’ll be able to tell you       more clearly then how this thing strikes me.”        “Is that convenient to you, Watson?”        “Perfectly.”        “Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?”        “I’d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.”        “I’ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,” said his companion.        “Then we meet again at two o’clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!”        We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang       of the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the       languid dreamer to the man of action.        “Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!” He       rushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a       few seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs       and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still       visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of       Oxford Street.        “Shall I run on and stop them?”        “Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with       your company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for       it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk.”        He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which       divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards       behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street.       Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon       which Holmes did the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little       cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager       eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted       on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward       again.        “There’s our man, Watson! Come along! We’ll have a good look at       him, if we can do no more.”        At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of       piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.       Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed       to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street.       Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in       sight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the       traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out       of sight.        “There now!” said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white       with vexation from the tide of vehicles. “Was ever such bad luck       and such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an       honest man you will record this also and set it against my       successes!”        “Who was the man?”        “I have not an idea.”        “A spy?”        “Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville       has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in       town. How else could it be known so quickly that it was the       Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If they had followed       him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the       second. You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the       window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.”        “Yes, I remember.”        “I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none.       We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very       deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is       a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I       am conscious always of power and design. When our friends left I       at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their       invisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted       himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he       could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice.       His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take       a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one       obvious disadvantage.”        “It puts him in the power of the cabman.”        “Exactly.”        “What a pity we did not get the number!”        “My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not       seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is       our man. But that is no use to us for the moment.”        “I fail to see how you could have done more.”        “On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked       in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a       second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or,       better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited       there. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should       have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and       seeing where he made for. As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness,       which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and       energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our       man.”        We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this       conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long       vanished in front of us.        “There is no object in our following them,” said Holmes. “The       shadow has departed and will not return. We must see what further       cards we have in our hands and play them with decision. Could you       swear to that man’s face within the cab?”        “I could swear only to the beard.”        “And so could I—from which I gather that in all probability it       was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no       use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here,       Watson!”        He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he       was warmly greeted by the manager.        “Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in       which I had the good fortune to help you?”        “No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps       my life.”        “My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some"]]]
