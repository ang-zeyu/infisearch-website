The morn hath come, sweet morn, awake!     And from thy pinions slumber shake.                                     II      Pure as the morn God's presence shines;     Love like its beams, thy life entwines;     Richer the gifts thy God bestows     Than morning beauty can disclose.                                     III      Sweet as the breath that fans the bowers,     And stirs the leaves and opening flowers,     Comes with the morn, the breath divine     To stir thee, slumbering soul of mine.                                     IV      O Thou, the Morn, the Light, the Sun,     With Thee be every day begun;     Brightness shall clothe my life always,     And fill my soul with grateful praise.                                      V      Glory to Thee, O Christ! my Lord,     Light of my soul, Incarnate Word!     Come with the morn, abide alway,     And cheer my course to endless day.                                         I      The saffron tints appear,     The morning comes--'tis here.     Wipe slumber from thine eyes,     Behold the sun arise!                                     II      Clad in his garb of gold,     Bright as he shone of old;     Beams o'er the heavens extend,     Shafts from his orb descend.                                     III      Sun, that in morning light     Rises, nor sinks in night,     Shine in my soul alway,     Make there an endless day.                                     IV      Life for my deadness give;     Shine, that my soul may live;     Joy to my sorrow bring;     Light on Thy glowing wing.                                      V      If 'neath the cloud I lie,     Darkness obscure my sky;     Yet, may my faith behold     Glints of the hidden gold.                                     VI      Father, to Thee, always,     And Holy Ghost, be praise;     Glory, while ages run,     To Thee, O Christ! our Sun.                                         I      Now glows the morn in beauty rare,     O haste my soul to fervent prayer,     And let the wings of morning raise     To God the tribute of thy praise.                                     II      The night is gone; now disappear     The clouds that hung in threatening near;     Day comes apace, and terrors flee,     For light illumes the earth and sea.                                     III      O soul dismayed! when darkness fills     The dismal days with darkling ills,     Rest in the calm the promise gives,     That Christ, thy Light and Glory, lives.                                     IV      Morn shall appear and scatter night;     Light shall appear in noonday might.     Strong in the joy the daylight brings,     Soul, thou shalt rise on glowing wings.                                      V      Morn of my soul, O Christ, Thou art;     Light of my life; my drooping heart     Sings, when Thy countenance benign     Shines as the joys of noonday shine.                                      EVENING                                         I      When night her sable curtain spreads,       And darkness falls on sea and land,     In silent beauty, o'er our heads,           The stars shine grand.                                     II      The orb of day his race hath run,       But see what glory comes to view,     As, full of radiance, one by one,           The stars shine true.                                     III      Now bright their silver light appears,       And reverent eyes behold the sight;     Hope lights the darkness of our fears--           The stars shine bright.                                     IV      When on our life the curtain falls,       And fast descends a threatening night,     Then, lest dismay the soul appals,           The stars shine bright.                                      V      O great the wisdom, great the power,--       God draws the curtains of the night,     And, in the dark and lonesome hour,           The stars shine bright.                                     VI      The glory and the truth of God,       His lovingkindness and His care,--     Such is the light He sheds abroad,           His stars shine rare.                                         I      A crown of gold surpassing rare,     The western hills, in beauty, wear;     And earth and sea reflect the light,     That fades before th' approach of night.                                     II      O Glorious Sun! whose peerless ray     Illumes the realm of endless day,     Shine on a world where darkness dwells,     And all the joy of day dispels.                                     III      Soft o'er the land the twilight creeps;     Night falls apace, and nature sleeps;     O let not night my life control,     And plunge in sleep my drowsy soul.                                     IV      Sleep to the weary pilgrim give,     But let the soul through slumber live;     Wake when the first faint gleam of morn     Tells that another day is born.                                      V      Light of my life! bid night depart,     Sing to my soul, and cheer my heart;     That morn, and noon, and night may be     One beauteous day of joy to me.                                     VI      And when the brightest morn shall break,     And bid the eternal day awake,     O Glorious Sun! in radiance shine,     To guard from night the realm divine.

II      Say, came He forth by myriads led?--       Come, gaily sound his praises high;     A crown of gold upon his head?       While angels praise Him in the sky.                   _Refrain._                                     III      Of earthly pomp the Lord had none,--       Come, gaily sound His praises high;     His kingly crown had not been won,       While angels praise Him in the sky.                   _Refrain._                                     IV      A little child the Lord became,--       Come, gaily sound His praises high,     To bear our guilt, and share our shame,       While angels praise Him in the sky.                   _Refrain._                                      V      O Jesu, Who in manger lay,--       Come, gaily sound his praises high,     Make me a little child to-day,       While angels praise Thee in the sky.                   _Refrain._                                     VI      And may I come, with spirit meet,--       Come, gaily sound His praises high,     To lay my tribute at Thy feet,       While angels praise Thee in the sky.                   _Refrain._                                     VII      To Father, Spirit, One with Christ,--       Come, gaily sound His praises high,     Be endless praise, Whose love sufficed,       While angels praise Him in the sky.                   _Refrain._   ----------  [1]This carol has been set to excellent and appropriate music by Mr.    Arthur Henry Brown, Brentwood, Essex, and is published by Novello &    Co., London. It is noteworthy that Mr. Brown is honourably associated    with Eastern Hymnody by his tune, _St. Anatolius_, which was composed    for Dr. Neale's rendering of the Greek evening hymn, {tên hêmeran    dielthôn}, \"The day is past and over\"; and also by _Orthodoxus_ and    _Apostolicus_, which were composed for The Ektene and The Litany Of    The Deacon respectively; and by _St. Stythians_, composed for {basileu    ouranie paraklête}, \"O King, enthroned on high\"--renderings by the    present author, all of which find a place in the new edition of Church    Hymns.                                     CAROL[2]                         {euphranthêti hierousalêm}                                       I      Jerusalem, rejoice!       Keep festival and sing;     All ye who dwell in Zion's courts,       Bring forth an offering.             Rejoice, rejoice,             Jerusalem, rejoice;         And sing with glee, right merrily,             Let every heart and voice.                                     II      To-day the chain is loosed       That long hath bound our race,     The condemnation is removed       Through God's abounding grace.             Rejoice, rejoice, etc.                                     III      The gates of heaven are wide,       And Satan's work undone;     For She[3] who fell beneath his power,       Now gives the world God's Son.             Rejoice, rejoice, etc.                                     IV      O depth of riches great!       O height of wisdom strong!

Rejoice, rejoice, etc.                                      V      Now, let creation sing       And leap, nor brook control,     For Christ hath come to call it back,       And save each ruined soul.

I      The best that heaven could bring--       First fruits, an offering free--     Was brought from far, when, by the star,       The wise men came to Thee.                                     II      No sceptre, and no throne!       The magi were amazed,     As, with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28479"],["title","Hymns from the East (#3)"],["body","prise, on humble guise       And poverty, they gazed.                                     III      But there Thy God-head shone,       Despite the manger bed;     O Christ, the Lord, Incarnate Word!       'Twas there Thou laid'st Thy head.                                         I      Out from the rising of the sun,       O'er tracts of desert wild,     The Magi came on journey lone,       To seek the heaven-born child;     The star o'erhead their footsteps led,       And hope their way beguiled.                                     II      They bore Him costly gifts of gold,       And myrrh and spices sweet:     \"For He is King,\" they had been told,       Whom they would meekly greet;     And they would go, in reverence low,       And worship at His feet.                                     III      O humble Child, in manger laid!       The wise beheld Thee there,     And reverently their homage paid,       And gave their offerings rare.     Their quest was found, and to the ground       They bowed the head in prayer.                                     IV      O Jesu, who in manger lay,       The Son of God most high,     Let me my humble homage pay,       And bring my offerings nigh,     And humbly greet Thee at Thy feet,       And low in worship lie.                                      EASTER                                         I      O woeful hour! when from the night     Emerged in wrath Satanic might,     To crush the Christ, whom God in heaven,     To raise our fallen race, had given.                                     II      O woeful hour! when, with the scorn     Of sinful men, His soul was torn;     When sin exulting bowed the knee,     And stung the Christ with mockery.                                     III      O woeful hour! when to the tree     The Christ was nailed in agony;     When anguish for our sin He bore,     And thorns His throbbing temples tore.                                     IV      O woeful hour! O darkest day!     The God-Man, still, entombed lay,     For death his cruel shaft had driven     To quell the hope our God had given.                                      V      O saddened soul! the night is past,     The morn, bright morn, has come at last;     The rage of sin its worst hath done,     Yet lives in power th' eternal Son.                                     VI      The dark hath vanished in the light;     O futile now, Satanic might;     Sin wounded lies, and death is slain     By Him who lives in power again.                                     VII      Hail, glorious morn! the Christ hath risen;     Hail Victor from the darkest prison!     Up, up, my soul! thy praises pour     To Christ, Thy God, for evermore.                                         I      Crown the Lord of glory,       Angels, crown your King;     Saints whose souls He ransomed,       Bring your offering;     Let no voice be silent,       Laud and honour bring.                                     II      Crown the Lord of glory,--       Once He dwelt below,     Bore the cross of sorrow,       Drank the cup of woe;     Now He reigns triumphant,       Let your praises flow.                                     III      Crown the Lord of glory,--       On the earth He wore     Purple robe that mocked Him,       Thorns His brow that tore;     Now His griefs are ended,       Praise Him evermore.                                     IV      Crown the Lord of glory,       For His work is done;     Crown the King of glory,       God's eternal Son;     In my life enthroned,       Be Thy reign begun!                                         I      O Christ, when on the shameful tree,     Thou bor'st such cruel pain for me,     Thine every member felt the smart,     And sent its sorrows to Thy heart.                                     II      A crown of thorns Thy temples tore,     Thy face, O Christ, vile spittings bore,     And cruel hands, O action base!     Smote Thee, defiant, in the face.                                     III      When in Thy thirst, men heard Thee call,     Thy lips were drenched with bitter gall;     And to Thine ears the words were borne     Of blasphemy and ribald scorn.                                     IV      Thy hands and feet with nails were riven,     The spear into Thy side was driven;--     O Christ, when dying on the tree,     How great the pain Thou bor'st for me!                                      V      Now, by Thy Cross, Almighty King,     Salvation to the sinner bring,     And let Thy sacrifice for me     Teach me to sacrifice for Thee.                                         I      O God of love, whose mercy came     To this dark world of sin and shame,     And on a Cross of suffering sore,     That sin and shame in meekness bore.                                     II      Supreme the love the Christ displayed,     When He, True God, True Man was made;     When He was scorned, His patience then     Shone forth divine, with sinful men.                                     III      Did e'er such mercy lead the great     To stoop from high to low estate?     Did e'er such love incline the heart     To take the erring sinner's part?                                     IV      'Twas God who loved, 'twas God who gave     His Son our erring souls to save;     'Tis Christ that wins us by the love     From earth below to heaven above.                                      V      Win me, O Lord, whose mercy came     To this dark world of sin and shame,     To that bright world whose beauties shine     Forever in Thy love divine.                                     VI      To Thee, O Father, glory be,     And glory, Christ, God-Man, to Thee,     And to the Spirit, Three in One,     Now, and while countless ages run.                                         I      When Hades held the Lord of Life,       The boast of sin was vaunting high;     'Twas much to wound a sinless soul,       But more to see the God-Man die.                                     II      When Hades held the Lord of Life,       The gates were barred to hold Him fast.     No prison bars so closely drawn       Were e'er by soul of mortal passed.                                     III      When Hades held the Lord of Life,       Rejoicing, death beheld Him there;--     \"Now close the ancient barriers draw,       And drive the prisoner to despair.\"                                     IV      O, blank surprise when Hades shook!       O, ringing joy through all the gloom!     Asunder fell the gates of night,       And rose the Conqueror from the tomb.                                      V      Immortal Saviour! death is dead,       No more it holds the souls of men;     For Thou hast crushed the power of sin,       And brought us back to life again.                                         I      When Thou, O Christ, upon the tree,       Wert bearing pain for sinful men,     The sun, lamenting, hid his face,       And clothed himself with darkness then;                                     II      And o'er the world, when noontide came,       The light grew faint and faded soon;     And men in wonder saw the dark       Bring in the night at hour of noon.                                     III      But, low in Hades' depths there shone       Such light as never shone before;     And prisoners saw the Light of lights,       And joyed to feel their bondage o'er.                                     IV      O blessed art Thou, Christ, our Lord,       For all the pain so meekly borne;     The dark that hid Thee in Thy woe,       Has ushered in a glorious morn.                                         I      To Thy Cross and Resurrection,       Laud and praise we humbly give;     In Thy death and life immortal,       We will die, and ever live.                                     II      Christ Incarnate! by Thy Manhood,       Thou to God hast brought me nigh;     Christ the humble! by Thy meekness,       Thou hast raised my horn on high.                                     III      Source of life! O Christ, the anguish       Borne upon the cruel tree     Lifts me to the bliss abiding,       Where from suffering, souls are free.                                     IV      Endless praises, bright and thankful,       Christ, to Thee be ever given,     By the souls in sorrow singing,       By the souls redeemed in heaven.                                         I      Light is dawning 'mong the hills,       Light of light Thy beams display,       All the darkness chase away,     Light that dawned upon our ills.                                     II      Dark the day the Cross was raised       By the hands of cruel men;       Great Thy load of sorrow then;     Angel hosts were sore amazed.                                     III      Dark the world while in the tomb,       Lone in death the Saviour lay,       Till the stone was rolled away,     And His Rising quelled the gloom.                                     IV      Fadeless now, O Light of light,       Glory of the Father, Thou,       Shine upon Thy people now,     Rise upon their darkest night.                                         I      Hail rising morn! for He hath risen;       Hail light that gilds the Eastern skies;     For, from the bonds of darkest prison,       Thy first beams saw the Christ arise.                                     II      O merciful and gracious One!       The gates of Hades Thou hast rent,     And by Thy Rising, Christ the Son,       No more we lie in bondage pent.                                     III      To-day the lips of Adam sing;       Eve hails the Christ of mankind born;     And patriarchs and prophets bring       Their hymns to greet the wondrous morn.                                     IV      And Thine the glory, Thine the power,       By glowing hearts in praise expressed;     For Thine the might, this glorious hour,       By which the sons of men are blessed.                                         I      We"]]]
