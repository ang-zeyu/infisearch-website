They come with sound of revelry and song, and close beside them press a crowd of weeping wives and mothers and little children, starved, crippled, and murdered, who are to be fellow victims with the drunkard. Not very far back from the front row come one hundred thousand young men in the very prime of young, vigorous life, just beginning to drink their first glass of wine or beer, with no intention of ever standing in that front row, yet having started on the way. Back of them, one hundred little school boys who think it manly to ape the follies of their predecessors. Back of them, one hundred thousand little toddlers whose feet stagger in their innocent helplessness. Back of them, one hundred thousand mothers with babies in their arms. Oh, how sweetly those baby eyes look up into the loving eyes that are brooding over them. Is it possible those baby brows will ever lie low in the gutter, those sweet lips be stained by oath or glass; those crumpled rose-leaf fingers ever strike the murderous blow incited by alcohol? It must be, if that front rank of one hundred thousand drunkards is to be recruited, for the drunkards of the future are to-day babies in their mother's arms. Do you who read these words intend to join this vast army of prospective drunkards, or will you belong to the cold-water army that is marching on accompanied by health, vigor, industry, prosperity, success and long life?  We must not be so interested in the inheritance of evil qualities as to forget the transmission of good. We read in Exodus, twentieth chapter, that the sins of the fathers are to be visited upon the children unto the third and fourth generations of them that hate the Lord, but mercy will be shown to _thousands of generations_ of them that love Him and keep his commandments. As we have seen the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children in transmission of diseased bodies, perverted moral natures and weakened wills, and realize that the promise is being fulfilled in the visitation of the sins of the fathers upon the children, let us see if the other promise is being fulfilled also, in the mercy shown to thousands of them that love the Lord and keep His commandments.  An English specialist in children's diseases has carefully noted the difference between twelve families of drinkers and twelve families of sober parents during a period of twelve years.                          INTEMPERATE. | TEMPERATE.                                      |   Produced 57 children; 25 died in   | Produced 61 children; 6 died   the first week of life.

This leaves only 10 who showed     |   during the whole of life a         |   normal disposition and development |   of body and mind.                  |  If it were not a fact that health, purity, integrity, intellect and virtue were being transmitted to a far greater extent than sin and vice, there would be little good in the world, but the transmission of these good qualities is so extended, so like the air and the sunshine and the water, a common thing, that we almost forget to recognize it. When we turn our thoughts to the investigation of this phase of the subject, we find that vigorous parents have healthful children, that powers of intellect are transmitted, and that honesty and uprightness in the father warrants us in expecting the same in the son. We recognize the transmission of powers of intellect in the fact that where the parents have a peculiar talent, we very generally find the same talent in their children. We are acquainted with musical families, mathematical families, artistic families, and in the study of renowned people of the world we find evidences of this transmission of intellect. We also learn that the effects of education are transmissible, and if the parents are educated along a certain line the children receive education along that line much more readily. This fact becomes a wonderful incentive to us to build up all that is best in our own natures in order that through us the world may receive an impetus towards higher and better things.  Sometimes when your faults and defects press upon you with tremendous force and you find it so very hard to overcome them, you may be tempted to lay the blame on your ancestry who gave you such a dower, who by their lives handicapped you in your life-struggle. You may feel inclined to say with some writer, to me unknown, who says:   HEREDITY.      \"Your strictures are unmerited,       Our follies are inherited,     Directly from our gran-pas they all came;       Our defects have been transmitted,     And we should be acquitted       Of all responsibility and blame.      We are not depraved beginners,       But hereditary sinners,     For our fathers never acted as they should;       'Tis the folly of our gran-pas     That continually hampers--       What a pity that our gran-pas weren't good!      Yes, we'd all be reverend senators,       If our depraved progenitors     Had all been prudent, studious and wise;       But they were quite terrestial,     Or we would be celestial,       Yes, we'd all be proper tenants for the skies.      If we're not all blameless sages,       And beacons to the ages,     And fit for principalities and powers;       If we do not guide and man it,     And engineer the planet,       'Tis the folly of our forefathers--not ours.\"  But the lesson of these lines is not that you should lie back in inaction, making no effort to overcome your defects because they are inheritances. There is for you a wiser lesson in the theme than that. When Marshall Ney was taunted with the fact that the Imperial nobility had no pedigree he proudly replied, \"We are ancestors.\"  There is a grand thought for you. If your ancestors did not do the best for you, will you not profit by your knowledge of this fact and do the best for those who shall look back to you as their ancestor? Supposing that your parents in their youth had said: \"I will take care of my health so that my children may be born with vigorous bodies; I will make good use of my intellect so that my children will inherit an added capacity for acquiring knowledge; I will obey all laws of morality so that my children will by inheritance tend toward virtue;\" and supposing that you to-day, with healthful bodies, keen intellects and upward tending moral natures, were reaping the reward of their forethought, would you not bless them for it?  You have no right to remain listless and discouraged because of your inheritances, whatever they may be. Hear the inspiriting words of Ella Wheeler Wilcox:      There is no thing you cannot overcome.     Say not thy evil instinct is inherited;     Or that some trait inborn, makes thy whole life forlorn,     And calls for punishment that is not merited.      Back of thy parents and grandparents lies,     The great Eternal Will; that, too, is thine     Inheritance--strong, beautiful, divine;     Sure lever of success for one who tries.      Pry up thy fault with this great lever--will;     However deeply bedded in propensity;     However firmly set, I tell thee firmer yet     Is that great power that comes from truth's immensity.      There is no noble height thou canst not climb;     All triumphs may be thine in time's futurity,     If whatsoe'er thy fault, thou dost not faint or halt,     But lean upon the staff of God's security.      Earth has no claim the soul can not contest.     Know thyself part of the supernal source,     And naught can stand before thy spirit's force     The soul's divine inheritance is best.  The youth of to-day have in their own hands the molding of the future, not only of themselves, but of the nation, by the every day habits of their lives. By their thoughts and aspirations, by the moral tendencies which they are cultivating in themselves, they are determining what shall be the characteristics of the nation in a hundred years to come. Shall this be, in a hundred years, a nation of drunkards? The young people of to-day are deciding that question. Shall it be a nation of invalids? This, also, the young people are deciding. Shall it be a nation filled with greed of gain, with a low standard of morals, with dishonest methods in business, or shall it be a nation wherein vigorous health is the rule, unflinching courage, absolute integrity and pure morality shall everywhere reign? What the young people of to-day are making of themselves physically, mentally and morally, is deciding what shall be the future of the country.     THE WHITE CROSS.   The cross is considered as an emblem of self-denial, the immolating of selfish wishes upon the altar of universal good.  In a nobler sense it means not so much self-denial as the creation of nobler desires, so that the individual wants only those things which he rightfully should have; he is not obliged to deny himself, because he asks nothing but that which is noble and pure. In this sense the cross is not so much the emblem of self-denial as an emblem of self-ennoblement--the exaltation of self.  The White Cross typifies the purifying of the life from the desire of mere sense pleasures. It means the noble manhood which claims for itself the privilege of chastity and the rewards of purity.  The White Cross army is composed of men and boys over fourteen years of age who unite to resist vice, to secure safety for the home and for society, to become all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29056"],["title","Almost A Man (#6)"],["body","becomes true manhood. In organized co-operation there is strength. It is not only the \"long pull\" and the \"strong pull,\" but the \"pull altogether,\" that is thoroughly successful.  Hundreds of men are living the white life individually, but are not associated together in an effort to influence others. Such association would result in more rapidly spreading the idea of the responsibility of the individual, would create public opinion, would give moral support to those who might find their unaided strength inadequate to meet the temptations of the world, in short, would furnish the conditions favorable to the highest ideals of social and individual life.  The White Cross Society aims to unite men in such an organized effort for the elevation of moral standards. Its members are pledged to the keeping of a fivefold obligation. The first of these appeals to the chivalry latent in the heart of every man, making him a protector of every woman, however lonely or friendless she may be, recognizing her potential value to the race; protecting her against his own selfish desires, against the open and covert assaults of other men, against her own unwisdom, if need be.  The second obligation pledges the White Cross knight to a pure heart expressed not only in conduct but in word. He will think and speak reverently of life in all its phases, and help to cleanse the language--written or spoken--of all that pollutes the heart or vitiates the imagination. The third obligation claims for the White Cross soldier the glory of living up to the highest moral standards, of being as pure as the noblest woman that lives. The fourth recognizes the power of influence and binds the members to a helpful interest in all humanity.  The fifth covers the whole scope of life in the obligation to use every effort to fulfil the command, \"Keep thyself pure.\" The heart of the true man must throb a quick response to the appeal made to him by the White Cross.  It means marital fidelity, it implies the sanctity of the home, it creates individual purity, and that insures social purity, it means a nobler manhood, a grander womanhood, a safer childhood.  The appeal is made to you individually. Will you not become a White Cross knight? Will you not, even if you cannot join an organized society, become a standard-bearer of the White Cross, pledging yourself to its five obligations? Soon you will find others willing to unite with you in this great work, and the society will be formed.  Each one who reads this book may become a true and faithful knight of the White Cross, no matter where he may be, in city mart or lonely farm, in busy shop or quiet school, and not only may he be a soldier, but he may be a recruiting officer, inducing others to enlist under the White Cross banner.

The principal of a young ladies' school writes: \"I invited our girls to the parlor and read your brochure, which was listened to with the deepest interest. At certain portions of the reading nearly all were in tears. It is a most pathetically pure, chaste presentation of a grand subject. You would have rejoiced could you have heard the expressions from the young ladies. Surely, dear Dr. Allen, God has blessed many through your instrumentality.\"  Read this book if you read no other but the Bible this year.--_Emma Bates, Valley City, N. D._  Please send me some more copies of your unique and valuable little book. I cannot keep a copy over night. It would be an evangel to every young person in whose hands it might be placed. I would also invite the public school teachers to examine this rare little book.--_Frances E.

A booklet designed to help mothers and teachers in the instruction of boys.

D.=  Teaching by metaphor, parable, and allegory has been the method of many of the wisest instructors.  No one can claim originality in comparing the body to a house, for that comparison is as old as literature.  But the simile is still of interest to the juvenile mind, and as science is ever making new discoveries, there is continual demand for new and interesting works on physiology.  Dr. Wood-Allen in this new book has united scientific facts and metaphor with the skill that would be expected from her by those acquainted with her literary powers.  The book will be found equally valuable as a text-book, a supplementary reader or a reference book in schools, or as a book of pleasant home instruction. Teachers in Normal Schools will find it a most suggestive aid in teaching physiology. As it contains the most reliable scientific facts in regard to alcohol, tobacco, and other narcotics, it fills the demand created by the school laws compelling the teaching of the action of narcotics on the human body.   TESTIMONIALS.  A charming book.--_Frances Willard._  Only a scientific person can understand how really good it is. It has been to me intensely interesting, and I hope sincerely that the world at large will appreciate it.--_J. M. W. Kitchen, M. D._  It gives me pleasure to note that the book, both by its subject-matter and its pleasing form of presentation, is well adapted to the use for which it is intended.--_B. A. Hinsdale, Professor of the Science and Art of Teaching, University of Michigan._  I find here, wrought out in attractive form, some of the most important knowledge that our young people ought to know. It is suitable for a supplementary reader in the upper grammar grades of the public schools. Part Second particularly is of the highest value to the boys and girls in our grammar and high schools.--_W. S.
