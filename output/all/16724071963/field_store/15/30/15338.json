Nevertheless a word may not be out of place for the inception of the work is out of the ordinary. Mr. Hard did not decide that a book on this subject was needed and then set about studying these interesting plants. He has observed them, collected them, induced many friends to join in eating those which proved to be palatable and delicious--really meddled for years with the various kinds which are edible and otherwise, and then recently he has decided to publish a book on his favorite subject. The interesting occupation of photographing the mushrooms and the toadstools doubtless has contributed largely to the determination culminating in the materialization of the treatise.  If I have correctly apprehended the origin and the contributing causes, we would expect this book to be different from the other books on mushrooms--not of course in scope and purpose; but the instruction and suggestions given, the descriptions and general remarks offered, the wide range of forms depicted in word and picture, the whole make up of the book in fact, will appeal to the people at large rather than the college student in particular. The author does not write for the specially educated few, but for the mass of intelligent people--those who read and study, but who observe more; those who are inclined to commune with nature as she displays herself in the glens and glades, in the fields and forests, and who spend little, if any, time chasing the forms or sketching the tissues that may be seen on the narrow stage of a compound microscope.  The book then is for the beginner, and for all beginners; the college student will find that this is the guide to use when he is ready to begin studying the mushrooms; the teachers in the schools should all begin to study mushrooms now, and for the purpose they will find this book advantageous; the people who see mushrooms often but do not know them may find here a book that really is a help.  We might wish for color photography when the subject is a delicately tinted mushroom; but if with it we should lose detail in structure then the wish would be renounced. The colors can be, approximately, described, often not so the characteristic markings, shapes and forms. The halftones from the photographs will, we anticipate, prove a valuable feature of the book, especially if the plants be most carefully examined before turning to the pictures. For half an hour the pages may be turned and the illustrations enjoyed. That, however, would give one no real knowledge of mushrooms. If such use only is made of the pictures, better had they never been prepared by Mr. Hard and his friends. But if a charming little toadstool, a delicately colored mushroom, a stately agaric, be carefully removed from the bed of loam, the decaying stump, or the old tree-trunk, then turned over and over again, and upside down, every part scrutinized, the structure in every detail attentively regarded--not with repugnant feeling, rather with a sympathetic interest that should naturally find all organisms inhabiting our globe--then in due time coming to the picture, a real picture, in the book, it must surely bring both pleasure and profit. Ponder the suggestion. Then, to conclude in a word, if Mr. Hard's book will induce people to _learn_ and _enjoy_ the mushrooms that we have, it will be a success, and great will be his reward.    W. A. Kellerman, Ph. D.    _Botanical Department,   Ohio State University,   Columbus, O._     AUTHOR'S NOTE  IN MEMORIAM   It is with feelings of profound sadness that I am impelled to supplement the above Introduction by a brief tribute to the memory of that genial gentleman and lovable companion, as well as enthusiastic scientist, the late Dr. W. A. Kellerman.  Spending his life in the pursuit of science, the Angel of Death overtook him while still in search for wider knowledge of Nature and her works, and with icy fingers sealed the lids over eyes ever on the alert for the discovery of hidden truths.  Quiet, reticent, and unassuming, it was given to but few to know the great-hearted, unselfish sweetness of nature underlying his whole life. Yet the scientific world in general and Nature students especially, recognize in Dr. Kellerman's death a loss long to be regretted and not soon to be repaired.  The foregoing \"Introduction\" from his pen was one of the latest, if not the last of his public writings, done but a few weeks before being stricken with the fatal fever which fell upon him in the forests of Guatemala, and so quickly ended his earthly hopes and aspirations.  It seems doubly sad that one so well and widely known in his life should be called upon to lay its burdens and its pleasures down while so far away from all who knew and loved him well; and to rest at last among strangers in a strange land.  To this beloved friend and companion of so many pleasant days in woods and fields the author of this book desires to pay the tribute of a loving remembrance and heartfelt appreciation.    The Author.     PREFACE      \"Various as beauteous, Nature, is thy face;     * * * all that grows, has grace.     All are appropriate. Bog and moss and fen     Are only poor to undiscerning men.     Here may the nice and curious eye explore     How Nature's hand adorns the ruby moor;     Beauties are these that from the view retire,     But will repay th' attention they require.\"   Botany and geology have been favorite studies of the author since leaving college, thanks to Dr. Nelson, who lives in the hearts of all his students. He, by his teachings, made these subjects so attractive and interesting that by one, at least, every spare moment has been given to following up the studies of botany and paleontology. But the mycological part of botany was brought practically to the author's attention by the Bohemian children at Salem, Ohio, at the same time arousing a desire to know the scientific side of the subject and thus to be able to help the many who were seeking a personal knowledge of these interesting plants.  Every teacher should be able to open the doors of Nature to his pupils that they may see her varied handiwork, and, as far as possible, assist in removing the mist from their eyes that they may see clearly the beauties of meadow, wood or hillside.  In beginning the fuller study of the subject the writer labored at great disadvantage because, for a number of years, there was but little available literature. Every book written upon this subject, in this country, was purchased as soon as it came out and all have been very helpful.  The study has been a very great pleasure, and some very delightful friendships have been made while in search for as great a variety of species as possible.  For a number of years the object was simply to become familiar with the different genera and species, and no photographs of specimens were made. This was a great mistake; for, after it was determined to bring out this work, it seemed impossible to find many of the plants which the author had previously found in other parts of the state.  However, this failure has been very largely overcome through the generous courtesy of his esteemed friends,--Mr. C. G. Lloyd, of Cincinnati; Dr. Fisher, of Detroit; Prof. Beardslee, of Ashville, N. C.; Prof. B. O. Longyear, of Ft. Collins, Col., and Dr. Kellerman, of Ohio State University,--who have most kindly furnished photographs representing those species found earlier in other parts of the state. The species represented here have all been found in this state within the past few years.  The writer is under great obligation to Prof. Atkinson, of Cornell University, for his very great assistance and encouragement in the study of mycology. His patience in examining and determining plants sent him is more fully appreciated than can be expressed here. Dr. William Herbst, Trexlertown, Pa., has helped to solve many difficult problems; so also have Mr. Lloyd, Prof. Morgan, Capt. McIlvaine and Dr. Charles H. Peck, State Botanist of New York.  The aim of the book has been to describe the species, as far as possible, in terms that will be readily understood by the general reader; and it is hoped that the larger number of illustrations will make the book helpful to those who are anxious to become acquainted with a part of botany so little studied in our schools and colleges.  No pains have been spared to get as representative specimens as it was possible to find. A careful study of the illustrations of the plants will, in most cases, very greatly assist the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29086"],["title","The Mushroom, Edible and Otherwise (#1)"],["body","in determining the classification of the plant when found; but the illustration should not be wholly relied upon, especially in the study of Boleti. The description should be carefully studied to see if it tallies with the characteristics of the plant in hand.  In many plants where notes had not been taken or had been lost, the descriptions given by the parties naming the plants were used. This is notably so of many of the Boleti. The author felt that Dr. Peck's descriptions would be more accurate and complete, hence they were used, giving him credit.  Care has been taken to give the translation of names and to show why the plant was so called. It is always a wonder to the uninitiated how the Latin name is remembered, but when students see that the name includes some prominent characteristic of the plant and thus discover its applicability, its recollection becomes comparatively easy.  The habitat and time of growth of each plant is given, also its edibility. The author was urged by his many friends throughout the state, while in institute work and frequently talking upon this subject, to give them a book that would assist them in becoming familiar with the common mushrooms of their vicinity. The request has been complied with.  It is hoped that the work will be as helpful as it has been pleasant to perform.    M. E. H.  Chillicothe, Ohio, January 11, 1908.

It was my practice to go out every day after flowers, especially the rarer ones, of which there were many in this county, and bring in specimens for the classes. There was in the city a wire nail mill, running day and night, whose proprietors brought over, from time to time, large numbers of Bohemians as workers in the mill. Very frequently, when driving to the country early in the morning, I found the boys and girls of these Bohemian families searching the woods, fields and pastures at some distance from town, although they had not been in this country more than a week or two and could not speak a word of English. I soon found that they were gathering mushrooms of various kinds and taking them home for food material. They could not tell me how they knew them, but I quickly learned that they knew them from their general characteristics,--in fact, they knew them as we know people and flowers.  I resolved to know something of the subject myself. I had no literature on mycology, and, at that time, there seemed to be little obtainable. About that time there appeared in Harper's Monthly an article by W. Hamilton Gibson upon Edible Toadstools and Mushrooms--an article which I thoroughly devoured, soon after purchasing his book upon the subject.  Salem, Ohio, was a very fertile locality for mushrooms and it was not long till I was surprised at the number that I really knew. I remembered that where there is a will there is a way.  In 1897 I moved to Bowling Green, Ohio; there I found many species which I had found about Salem, Ohio, but the extremely rich soil, heavy timber and numerous old lake beaches seemed to furnish a larger variety, so that I added many more to my list. After remaining three years in Bowling Green, making delightful acquaintance with the good people of that city as well as with the flowers and mushrooms of Wood county, Providence placed me in Sidney, Ohio, where I found many new species of fungi and renewed my acquaintance with many of those formerly met.  Since coming to Chillicothe I have tried to have the plants photographed as I have found them, but having to depend upon a photographer I could not always do this. I have not found in this vicinity many that I have found elsewhere in the state, although I have found many new things here, a fact which I attribute to the hilly nature of the county. For prints of many varieties of fungi obtained before coming here, I am indebted to my friends. I should advise any one intending to make a study of this subject to have all specimens photographed as soon as they are identified, thus fixing the species for future reference.  It seems to me that every school teacher should know something of mycology. Some of my teachers have during the past year made quite a study of this interesting subject, and I have found that their pupils kept them busy in identifying their finds. Their lists of genera and species, as exhibited on the blackboards at the close of the season were quite long. I found from my Bohemian boys and girls that their teachers in their native country had opened for them the door to this very useful knowledge. Observation has proven to me conclusively that there is a large and increasing interest in this subject throughout the greater part of Ohio.  Every professional man needs a hobby which he may mount in his hours of relaxation, and I am quite sure there is no field that offers better inducement for a canter than the subject of botany, and especially this particular department of botanical work.  I have a friend, a professional man who has an eye and a heart for all the beauties of nature. After hours of confinement in his office at close and critical work he is always anxious for a ramble over the hillsides and through the woods, and when we find anything new he seems to enjoy it beyond measure.  Many ministers of the gospel have become famous in the mycological world. The names of Rev. Lewis Schweiwitz, of Bethlehem, Pa.; Rev. M. J. Berkeley and Rev. John Stevenson, of England, will live as long as botany is known to mankind. Their influence for good and helpfulness to their fellowmen will be everlasting.  With such an inspiration, how quickly one is lost to all business cares, and how free and life-giving are the fields, the meadows and the woods, so that one must exclaim with Prof. Henry Willey in his \"Introduction to the Study of the Lichen\":      \"If I could put my woods in song,       And tell what's there enjoyed,     All men would to my garden throng,       And leave the cities void.     In my lot no tulips blow;       Snow-loving pines and oaks instead;     And rank the savage maples grow,       From Spring's first flush to Autumn red;     My garden is a forest ledge,       Which older forests bound.\"   MUSHROOMS AND TOADSTOOLS  =HOW TO TELL MUSHROOMS FROM TOADSTOOLS.= In all probability no student of mycology has any one query more frequently or persistently pressed upon his attention than the question, \"How do you tell a toadstool from a mushroom?\"--or if in the woods or fields, in search for new species, with an uninitiated comrade, he has frequently to decide whether a certain specimen \"is a mushroom or a toadstool,\" so firmly fixed is the idea that one class of fungi--the toadstools--are poisonous, and the other--the mushrooms--are edible and altogether desirable; and these inquiring minds frequently seem really disappointed at being told that they are one and the same thing; that there are edible toadstools and mushrooms, and poisonous mushrooms and toadstools; that in short a toadstool is really a mushroom and a mushroom is only a toadstool after all.  Hence the questions with the beginner is, how he may tell a poisonous fungus from an edible one. There is but one answer to this question, and that is that he must thoroughly learn both genera and species, studying each till he knows its special features as he does those of his most familiar friends.  Certain species have been tested by a number of people and found to be perfectly safe and savory; on the other hand, there are species under various genera which, if not actually poisonous, are at least deleterious.  It is the province of all books on fungi to assist the student in separating the plants into genera and species; in this work special attention has been given to distinguishing between the edible and the poisonous species. There are a few species such "]]]
