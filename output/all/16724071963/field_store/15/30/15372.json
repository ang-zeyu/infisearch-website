They dug him out from under his crumpled plane and the piled splinters of quartz. His metal was dented and twisted, but unpierced. They carried him tenderly to the space ship, and carefully set him down. The ship's physician listened long with his stethoscope, then looked up and smiled.  \"He's alive,\" the doctor said, \"just barely alive.

But, if you do, beware--beware of the     Knights!_    dream   town   _by ... HENRY SLESAR_    The woman in the doorway looked so harmless. Who  was to tell she had some rather startling interests?   The woman in the doorway looked like Mom in the homier political cartoons. She was plump, apple-cheeked, white-haired. She wore a fussy, old-fashioned nightgown, and was busily clutching a worn house-robe around her expansive middle. She blinked at Sol Becker's rain-flattened hair and hang-dog expression, and said: \"What is it? What do you want?\"  \"I'm sorry--\" Sol's voice was pained. \"The man in the diner said you might put me up. I had my car stolen: a hitchhiker; going to Salinas ...\" He was puffing.  \"Hitchhiker? I don't understand.\" She clucked at the sight of the pool of water he was creating in her foyer. \"Well, come inside, for heaven's sake. You're soaking!\"  \"Thanks,\" Sol said gratefully.  With the door firmly shut behind him, the warm interior of the little house covered him like a blanket. He shivered, and let the warmth seep over him. \"I'm terribly sorry. I know how late it is.\" He looked at his watch, but the face was too misty to make out the hour.  \"Must be nearly three,\" the woman sniffed. \"You couldn't have come at a worse time. I was just on my way to court--\"  The words slid by him. \"If I could just stay overnight. Until the morning. I could call some friends in San Fernando. I'm very susceptible to head colds,\" he added inanely.  \"Well, take those shoes off, first,\" the woman grumbled. \"You can undress in the parlor, if you'll keep off the rug. You won't mind using the sofa?\"  \"No, of course not. I'd be happy to pay--\"  \"Oh, tush, nobody's asking you to pay. This isn't a hotel. You mind if I go back upstairs? They're gonna miss me at the palace.\"  \"No, of course not,\" Sol said. He followed her into the darkened parlor, and watched as she turned the screw on a hurricane-style lamp, shedding a yellow pool of light over half a flowery sofa and a doily-covered wing chair. \"You go on up. I'll be perfectly fine.\"  \"Guess you can use a towel, though. I'll get you one, then I'm going up. We wake pretty early in this house. Breakfast's at seven; you'll have to be up if you want any.\"  \"I really can't thank you enough--\"  \"Tush,\" the woman said. She scurried out, and returned a moment later with a thick bath towel. \"Sorry I can't give you any bedding. But you'll find it nice and warm in here.\" She squinted at the dim face of a ship's-wheel clock on the mantle, and made a noise with her tongue. \"Three-thirty!\" she exclaimed. \"I'll miss the whole execution ...\"  \"The what?\"  \"Goodnight, young man,\" Mom said firmly.  She padded off, leaving Sol holding the towel. He patted his face, and then scrubbed the wet tangle of brown hair. Carefully, he stepped off the carpet and onto the stone floor in front of the fireplace. He removed his drenched coat and suit jacket, and squeezed water out over the ashes.  He stripped down to his underwear, wondering about next morning's possible embarrassment, and decided to use the damp bath towel as a blanket. The sofa was downy and comfortable. He curled up under the towel, shivered once, and closed his eyes.         *       *       *       *       *  He was tired and very sleepy, and his customary nightly review was limited to a few detached thoughts about the wedding he was supposed to attend in Salinas that weekend ... the hoodlum who had responded to his good-nature by dumping him out of his own car ... the slogging walk to the village ... the little round woman who was hurrying off, like the White Rabbit, to some mysterious appointment on the upper floor ...  Then he went to sleep.  A voice awoke him, shrill and questioning.  \"Are you _nakkid_?\"  His eyes flew open, and he pulled the towel protectively around his body and glared at the little girl with the rust-red pigtails.  \"Huh, mister?\" she said, pushing a finger against her freckled nose. \"Are you?\"  \"No,\" he said angrily. \"I'm not naked. Will you please go away?\"  \"Sally!\" It was Mom, appearing in the doorway of the parlor. \"You leave the gentleman alone.\" She went off again.  \"Yes,\" Sol said. \"Please let me get dressed. If you don't mind.\" The girl didn't move. \"What time is it?\"  \"Dunno,\" Sally shrugged. \"I like poached eggs. They're my favorite eggs in the whole world.\"  \"That's good,\" Sol said desperately. \"Now why don't you be a good girl and eat your poached eggs. In the kitchen.\"  \"Ain't ready yet. You going to stay for breakfast?\"  \"I'm not going to do anything until you get out of here.\"  She put the end of a pigtail in her mouth and sat down on the chair opposite. \"I went to the palace last night. They had an exelution.\"  \"Please,\" Sol groaned. \"Be a good girl, Sally. If you let me get dressed, I'll show you how to take your thumb off.\"  \"Oh, that's an old trick. Did you ever see an exelution?\"  \"No. Did you ever see a little girl with her hide tanned?\"  \"Huh?\"  \"_Sally!_\" Mom again, sterner. \"You get out of there, or you-know-what ...\"  \"Okay,\" the girl said blithely. \"I'm goin' to the palace again. If I brush my teeth. Aren't you _ever_ gonna get up?\" She skipped out of the room, and Sol hastily sat up and reached for his trousers.  When he had dressed, the clothes still damp and unpleasant against his skin, he went out of the parlor and found the kitchen. Mom was busy at the stove. He said: \"Good morning.\"  \"Breakfast in ten minutes,\" she said cheerfully. \"You like poached eggs?\"  \"Sure. Do you have a telephone?\"  \"In the hallway. Party line, so you may have to wait.\"  He tried for fifteen minutes to get through, but there was a woman on the line who was terribly upset about a cotton dress she had ordered from Sears, and was telling the world about it.  Finally, he got his call through to Salinas, and a sleepy-voiced Fred, his old Army buddy, listened somewhat indifferently to his tale of woe. \"I might miss the wedding,\" Sol said unhappily. \"I'm awfully sorry.\" Fred didn't seem to be half as sorry as he was. When Sol hung up, he was feeling more despondent than ever.  A man, tall and rangy, with a bobbing Adam's apple and a lined face, came into the hallway. \"Hullo?\" he said inquiringly. \"You the fella had the car stolen?\"  \"Yes.\"  The man scratched his ear. \"Take you over to Sheriff Coogan after breakfast. He'll let the Stateys know about it. My name's Dawes.\"  Sol accepted a careful handshake.  \"Don't get many people comin' into town,\" Dawes said, looking at him curiously. \"Ain't seen a stranger in years. But you look like the rest of us.\" He chuckled.  Mom called out: \"Breakfast!\"         *       *       *       *       *  At the table, Dawes asked his destination.  \"Wedding in Salinas,\" he explained. \"Old Army friend of mine. I picked this hitchhiker up about two miles from here. He _seemed_ okay.\"  \"Never can tell,\" Dawes said placidly, munching egg. \"Hey, Ma. That why you were so late comin' to court last night?\"  \"That's right, Pa.\" She poured the blackest coffee Sol had ever seen. \"Didn't miss much, though.\"  \"What court is that?\" Sol asked politely, his mouth full.  \"Umagum,\" Sally said, a piece of toast sticking out from the side of her mouth. \"Don't you know _nothin'_?\"  \"_Arma_gon,\" Dawes corrected. He looked sheepishly at the stranger. \"Don't expect Mister--\" He cocked an eyebrow. \"What's the name?\"  \"Becker.\"  \"Don't expect Mr. Becker knows anything about Armagon. It's just a dream, you know.\" He smiled apologetically.  \"Dream? You mean this--Armagon is a place you dream about?\"  \"Yep,\" Dawes said. He lifted cup to lip. \"Great coffee, Ma.\" He leaned back with a contented sigh. \"Dream about it every night. Got so used to the place, I get all confused in the daytime.\"  Mom said: \"I get muddle-headed too, sometimes.\"  \"You mean--\" Sol put his napkin in his lap. \"You mean _you_ dream about the same place?\"  \"Sure,\" Sally piped. \"We all go there at night. I'm goin' to the palace again, too.\"  \"If you brush your teeth,\" Mom said primly.  \"If I brush my teeth. Boy, you shoulda seen the exelution!\"  \"Execution,\" her father said.  \"Oh, my goodness!\" Mom got up hastily. \"That reminds me. I gotta call poor Mrs. Brundage. It's the _least_ I could do.\"  \"Good idea,\" Dawes nodded. \"And I'll have to round up some folks and get old Brundage out of there.\"  Sol was staring. He opened his mouth, but couldn't think of the right question to ask. Then he blurted out: \"What execution?\"  \"None of _your_ business,\" the man said coldly. \"You eat up, young man. If you want me to get Sheriff Coogan lookin' for your car.\"  The rest of the meal went silently, except for Sally's insistence upon singing her school song between mouthfuls. When Dawes was through, he pushed back his plate and ordered Sol to get ready.  Sol grabbed his topcoat and followed the man out the door.  \"Have to stop someplace first,\" Dawes said. \"But we'll be pickin' up the Sheriff on the way. Okay with you?\"  \"Fine,\" Sol said uneasily.  The rain had stopped, but the heavy clouds seemed reluctant to leave the skies over the small town. There was a skittish breeze blowing, and Sol Becker tightened the collar of his coat around his neck as he tried to keep up with the fast-stepping Dawes.         *       *       *       *       *  They crossed the street diagonally, and entered a two-story wooden building. Dawes took the stairs at a brisk pace, and pushed open the door on the second floor. A fat man looked up from behind a desk.  \"Hi, Charlie. Thought I'd see if you wanted to help move Brundage.\"  The man batted his eyes. \"Oh, Brundage!\" he said. \"You know, I clean forgot about him?\" He laughed. \"Imagine me forgetting that?\"  \"Yeah.\" Dawes wasn't amused. \"And you Prince Regent.\"  \"Aw, Willie--\"  \"Well, come on.
