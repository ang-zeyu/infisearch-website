Even setting that objection aside, it is undeniable that no work of fiction published of late in America corresponds quite so accurately to the terms of this definition as do the multiplication tables.  Yet the multiplication tables are not without their claims to applause as examples of straightforward narrative.  It is, also, at least permissible to consider that therein the numeral five, say, where it figures as protagonist, unfolds under the stress of its varying adventures as opulent a development of real human nature as does, through similar ups-and-downs, the Reverend John Hodder in _The Inside of the Cup_.  It is equally allowable to find the less simple evolution of the digit seven more sympathetic, upon the whole, than those of Undine Spragg in _The Custom of the Country_. But, even so, this definition of what may now, authoritatively, be ranked as a \"best novel\" is an honest and noteworthy severance from misleading literary associations such as have too long befogged our notions about reading-matter.  It points with emphasis toward the altruistic obligations of tale-tellers to be \"vital.\"  For we average-novel-readers--we average people, in a word--are now, as always, rather pathetically hungry for \"vital\" themes, such themes as appeal directly to our everyday observation and prejudices.  Did the decision rest with us all novelists would be put under bond to confine themselves forevermore to themes like these.  As touches the appeal to everyday observation, it is an old story, at least coeval with Mr. Crummles' not uncelebrated pumps and tubs, if not with the grapes of Zeuxis, how unfailingly in art we delight to recognize the familiar.  A novel whose scene of action is explicit will always interest the people of that locality, whatever the book's other pretensions to consideration.  Given simultaneously a photograph of Murillo's rendering of _The Virgin Crowned Queen of Heaven_ and a photograph of a governor's installation in our State capital, there is no one of us but will quite naturally look at the latter first, in order to see if in it some familiar countenance be recognizable.  And thus, upon a larger scale, the twentieth century is, pre-eminently, interested in the twentieth century.  It is all very well to describe our average-novel-readers' dislike of Romanticism as \"the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.\" It is even within the scope of human dunderheadedness again to point out here that the supreme artists in literature have precisely this in common, and this alone, that in their masterworks they have avoided the \"vital\" themes of their day with such circumspection as lesser folk reserve for the smallpox.  The answer, of course, in either case, is that the \"vital\" novel, the novel which peculiarly appeals to us average-novel-readers, has nothing to do with literature.  There is between these two no more intelligent connection than links the paint Mr. Sargent puts on canvas and the paint Mr. Dockstader puts on his face.  Literature is made up of the re-readable books, the books which it is possible--for the people so constituted as to care for that sort of thing--to read again and yet again with pleasure.  Therefore, in literature a book's subject is of astonishingly minor importance, and its style nearly everything: whereas in books intended to be read for pastime, and forthwith to be consigned at random to the wastebasket or to the inmates of some charitable institute, the theme is of paramount importance, and ought to be a serious one.  The modern novelist owes it to his public to select a \"vital\" theme which in itself will fix the reader's attention by reason of its familiarity in the reader's everyday life.  Thus, a lady with whose more candid opinions the writer of this is more frequently favored nowadays than of old, formerly confessed to having only one set rule when it came to investment in new reading-matter--always to buy the Williamsons' last book.  Her reason was the perfectly sensible one that the Williamsons' plots used invariably to pivot upon motor-trips, and she is an ardent automobilist.  Since, as of late, the Williamsons have seen fit to exercise their typewriter upon other topics, they have as a matter of course lost her patronage.  This principle of selection, when you come to appraise it sanely, is the sole intelligent method of dealing with reading-matter.  It seems here expedient again to state the peculiar problem that we average-novel-readers have of necessity set the modern novelist--namely, that his books must in the main appeal to people who read for pastime, to people who read books only under protest and only when they have no other employment for that particular half-hour.  Now, reading for pastime is immensely simplified when the book's theme is some familiar matter of the reader's workaday life, because at outset the reader is spared considerable mental effort.  The motorist above referred to, and indeed any average-novel-reader, can without exertion conceive of the Williamsons' people in their automobiles. Contrariwise, were these fictitious characters embarked in palankeens or droshkies or jinrikishas, more or less intellectual exercise would be necessitated on the reader's part to form a notion of the conveyance.  And we average-novel-readers do not open a book with the intention of making a mental effort.  The author has no right to expect of us an act so unhabitual, we very poignantly feel.  Our prejudices he is freely chartered to stir up--if, lucky rogue, he can!--but he ought with deliberation to recognize that it is precisely in order to avoid mental effort that we purchase, or borrow, his book, and afterward discuss it.  Hence arises our heartfelt gratitude toward such novels as deal with \"vital\" themes, with the questions we average-novel-readers confront or make talk about in those happier hours of our existence wherein we are not reduced to reading.  Thus, a tale, for example, dealing either with \"feminism\" or \"white slavery\" as the handiest makeshift of spinsterdom--or with the divorce habit and plutocratic iniquity in general, or with the probable benefits of converting clergymen to Christianity, or with how much more than she knows a desirable mother will tell her children--finds the book's tentative explorer, just now, amply equipped with prejudices, whether acquired by second thought or second hand, concerning the book's topic.  As endurability goes, reading the book rises forthwith almost to the level of an afternoon-call where there is gossip about the neighbors and Germany's future.  We average-novel-readers may not, in either case, agree with the opinions advanced; but at least our prejudices are aroused, and we are interested.  And these \"vital\" themes awake our prejudices at the cost of a minimum--if not always, as when Miss Corelli guides us, with a positively negligible--tasking of our mental faculties.  For such exemption we average-novel-readers cannot  but be properly grateful. Nay, more than this: provided the novelist contrive to rouse our prejudices, it matters with us not at all whether afterward they be soothed or harrowed.  To implicate our prejudices somehow, to raise in us a partizanship in the tale's progress, is our sole request.  Whether this consummation be brought about through an arraignment of some social condition which we personally either advocate or reprehend--the attitude weighs little--or whether this interest be purchased with placidly driveling preachments of generally \"uplifting\" tendencies--vaguely titillating that vague intention which exists in us all of becoming immaculate as soon as it is perfectly convenient--the personal prejudices of us average-novel-readers are not lightly lulled again to sleep.  In fact, the jealousy of any human prejudice against hinted encroachment may safely be depended upon to spur us through an astonishing number of pages--for all that it has of late been complained among us, with some show of extenuation, that our original intent in beginning certain of the recent \"vital\" novels was to kill time, rather than eternity.  And so, we average-novel-readers plod on jealously to the end, whether we advance (to cite examples already somewhat of yesterday) under the leadership of Mr. Upton Sinclair aspersing the integrity of modern sausages and millionaires, or of Mr. Hall Caine saying about Roman Catholics what ordinary people would hesitate to impute to their relatives by marriage--or whether we be more suavely allured onward by Mrs. Florence Barclay, or Mr. Sydnor Harrison, with ingenuous indorsements of the New Testament and the inherent womanliness of women.  The \"vital\" theme, then, let it be repeated, has two inestimable advantages which should commend it to all novelists: first, it spares us average-novel-readers any preliminary orientation, and thereby mitigates the mental exertion of reading; and secondly, it appeals to our prejudices, which we naturally prefer to exercise, and are accustomed to exercise, rather than our mental or idealistic faculties. The novelist who conscientiously bears these two facts in mind is reasonably sure of his reward, not merely in pecuniary form, but in those higher fields wherein he harvests his chosen public's honest gratitude and affection.  For we average-novel-readers are quite frequently reduced by circumstances to self-entrustment to the resources of the novelist, as to those of the dentist.  Our latter-day conditions, as we cannot but recognize, necessitate the employment of both artists upon occasion. And with both, we average-novel-readers, we average people, are most grateful when they make the process of resorting to them as easy and unirritating as may be possible.     V   So much for the plea of us average-novel-readers; and our plea, we think, is rational.  We are \"in the market\" for a specified article; and human"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/288"],["title","The Certain Hour (Dizain des PoÃ«tes) (#3)"],["body","nuity, co-operating with human nature, will inevitably insure the manufacture of that article as long as any general demand for it endures.  Meanwhile, it is small cause for grief that the purchaser of American novels prefers Central Park to any \"wood near Athens,\" and is more at home in the Tenderloin than in Camelot.  People whose tastes happen to be literary are entirely too prone to too much long-faced prattle about literature, which, when all is said, is never a controlling factor in anybody's life.  The automobile and the telephone, the accomplishments of Mr. Edison and Mr. Burbank, and it would be permissible to add of Mr. Rockefeller, influence nowadays, in one fashion or another, every moment of every living American's existence; whereas had America produced, instead, a second Milton or a Dante, it would at most have caused a few of us to spend a few spare evenings rather differently.  Besides, we know--even we average-novel-readers--that America is in fact producing her enduring literature day by day, although, as rarely fails to be the case, those who are contemporaneous with the makers of this literature cannot with any certainty point them out.  To voice a hoary truism, time alone is the test of \"vitality.\"  In our present flood of books, as in any other flood, it is the froth and scum which shows most prominently.  And the possession of \"vitality,\" here as elsewhere, postulates that its possessor must ultimately perish.  Nay, by the time these printed pages are first read as printed pages, allusion to those modern authors whom these pages cite--the pre-eminent literary personages of that hour wherein these pages were written--will inevitably have come to savor somewhat of antiquity: so that sundry references herein to the \"vital\" books now most in vogue will rouse much that vague shrugging recollection as wakens, say, at a mention of _Dorothy Vernon_ or _Three Weeks_ or _Beverly of Graustark_.  And while at first glance it might seem expedient--in revising the last proof-sheets of these pages--somewhat to \"freshen them up\" by substituting, for the books herein referred to, the \"vital\" and more widely talked-of novels of the summer of 1916, the task would be but wasted labor; since even these fascinating chronicles, one comprehends forlornly, must needs be equally obsolete by the time these proof-sheets have been made into a volume.  With malice aforethought, therefore, the books and authors named herein stay those which all of three years back our reviewers and advertising pages, with perfect gravity, acclaimed as of enduring importance.  For the quaintness of that opinion, nowadays, may profitably round the moral that there is really nothing whereto one may fittingly compare a successful contribution to \"vital\" reading-matter, as touches evanescence.  And this is as it should be.  _Tout passe.--L'art robust seul a l'Ã©ternitÃ©_, precisely as Gautier points out, with bracing common-sense; and it is excellent thus to comprehend that to-day, as always, only through exercise of the auctorial virtues of distinction and clarity, of beauty and symmetry, of tenderness and truth and urbanity, may a man in reason attempt to insure his books against oblivion's voracity.  Yet the desire to write perfectly of beautiful happenings is, as the saying runs, old as the hills--and as immortal.  Questionless, there was many a serviceable brick wasted in Nineveh because finicky persons must needs be deleting here and there a phrase in favor of its cuneatic synonym; and it is not improbable that when the outworn sun expires in clinkers its final ray will gild such zealots tinkering with their \"style.\"  This, then, is the conclusion of the whole matter.  Some few there must be in every age and every land of whom life claims nothing very insistently save that they write perfectly of beautiful happenings.  And even we average-novel-readers know it is such folk who are to-day making in America that portion of our literature which may hope for permanency.

It is as if the intellect and the will had become used to moving paralytically among visions, dreams, and mystic terrors, weighed down with torpor._\"     Fair friend, since that hour I took leave of thee   I have not slept nor stirred from off my knee,   But prayed alway to God, S. Mary's Son,   To give me back my true companion;       And soon it will be Dawn.    Fair friend, at parting, thy behest to me   Was that all sloth I should eschew and flee,   And keep good Watch until the Night was done:   Now must my Song and Service pass for none?       For soon it will be Dawn.    RAIMBAUT DE VAQUIERAS.--_Aubade, from F. York Powell's version_.     BELHS CAVALIERS   You may read elsewhere of the long feud that was between Guillaume de Baux, afterward Prince of Orange, and his kinsman Raimbaut de Vaquieras.  They were not reconciled until their youth was dead.  Then, when Messire Raimbaut returned from battling against the Turks and the Bulgarians, in the 1,210th year from man's salvation, the Archbishop of Rheims made peace between the two cousins; and, attended by Makrisi, a converted Saracen who had followed the knight's fortunes for well nigh a quarter of a century, the Sire de Vaquieras rode homeward.  Many slain men were scattered along the highway when he came again into Venaissin, in April, after an absence of thirty years.  The crows whom his passing disturbed were too sluggish for long flights and many of them did not heed him at all.  Guillaume de Baux was now undisputed master of these parts, although, as this host of mute, hacked and partially devoured witnesses attested, the contest had been dubious for a while: but now Lovain of the Great-Tooth, Prince Guillaume's last competitor, was captured; the forces of Lovain were scattered; and of Lovain's lieutenants only Mahi de Vernoil was unsubdued.  Prince Guillaume laughed a little when he told his kinsman of the posture of affairs, as more loudly did Guillaume's gross son, Sire Philibert.  But Madona Biatritz did not laugh.  She was the widow of Guillaume's dead brother--Prince Conrat, whom Guillaume succeeded--and it was in her honor that Raimbaut had made those songs which won him eminence as a practitioner of the Gay Science.  Biatritz said, \"It is a long while since we two met.\"  He that had been her lover all his life said, \"Yes.\"  She was no longer the most beautiful of women, no longer his be-hymned Belhs Cavaliers--you may read elsewhere how he came to call her that in all his canzons--but only a fine and gracious stranger.  It was uniformly gray, that soft and plentiful hair, where once such gold had flamed as dizzied him to think of even now; there was no crimson in these thinner lips; and candor would have found her eyes less wonderful than those Raimbaut had dreamed of very often among an alien and hostile people.  But he lamented nothing, and to him she was as ever Heaven's most splendid miracle.  \"Yes,\" said this old Raimbaut,--\"and even to-day we have not reclaimed the Sepulcher as yet.  Oh, I doubt if we shall ever win it, now that your brother and my most dear lord is dead.\"  Both thought a while of Boniface de Montferrat, their playmate once, who yesterday was King of Thessalonica and now was so much Macedonian dust.  She said:  \"This week the Prince sent envoys to my nephew. . . .  And so you have come home again----\"  Color had surged into her time-worn face, and as she thought of things done long ago this woman's eyes were like the eyes of his young Biatritz.  She said: \"You never married?\"  He answered:  \"No, I have left love alone.  For Love prefers to take rather than to give; against a single happy hour he balances a hundred miseries, and he appraises one pleasure to be worth a thousand pangs. Pardieu, let this immortal usurer contrive as may seem well to him, for I desire no more of his bounty or of his penalties.\"  \"No, we wish earnestly for nothing, either good or bad,\" said Dona Biatritz--\"we who have done with loving.\"  They sat in silence, musing over ancient happenings, and not looking at each other, until the Prince came with his guests, who seemed to laugh too heartily.  Guillaume's frail arm was about his kinsman, and Guillaume chuckled over jests and by-words that had been between the cousins as children. Raimbaut found them no food for laughter now.  Guillaume told all of Raimbaut's oath of fealty, and of how these two were friends and their unnatural feud was forgotten.  \"For we grow old,--eh, maker of songs?\" he said; \"and it is time we made our peace with Heaven, since we are not long for this world.\"  \"Yes,\" said the knight; \"oh yes, we both grow old.\"  He thought of another April evening, so long ago, when this Guillaume de Baux had stabbed him in a hedged field near Calais, and had left him under a hawthorn bush for dead; and Raimbaut wondered that there was no anger in his heart.  \"We are friends now,\" he said.  Biatritz, whom these two had loved, and whose vanished beauty had been the spur of their long enmity, sat close to them, and hardly seemed to listen.  Thus the evening passed and every one was merry, because the Prince had overcome Lovain of the Great-Tooth, and was to punish the upstart on the morrow.  But Raimbaut de Vaquieras, a spent fellow, a derelict, barren of aim now that the Holy Wars were over, sat in this unfamiliar place--where when he was young he had laughed as a cock crows!--and thought how at the last he had crept home to die as a dependent on his cousin's bounty.  Thus the evening passed, and at its end Makrisi followed the troubadour to his regranted fief of Vaquieras.  This was a chill and brilliant "]]]
