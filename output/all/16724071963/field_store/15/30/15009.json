But at my age--I may tell you I am nearing the end of my second century--one is apt to forget the flight of Time. Or it may be that Time in your world flies more quickly than in ours. I did not stay to hear more from the Baron than that he had succeeded in finding our Queen, and, to be quite plain with you, I was unprepared to find you so mature.\"  Then, thought Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson confusedly, she _had_ been brought here for the Pageant after all. But what very odd people seemed to be getting it up!  \"Baron--whatever his name is, appeared to be quite satisfied that I was suited to the part,\" she said coldly. \"Of course, if you require someone younger----\"  \"There can be no manner of doubt, my dear, that you are the Queen we have been seeking, so the mere fact that you are rather older than some of us expected is of no importance whatever.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson. \"I do not consider myself more than middle-aged, and have generally been taken for younger than I am, Mrs. ----, I haven't the pleasure of knowing your name.\"  \"Here they call me the Fairy Vogelflug; in the neighbouring Kingdom of Clairdelune my name is Voldoiseau. I have officiated as Court Godmother to the reigning Royal families in both countries for many generations.\"  \"I _thought_ you were a Fairy Godmother!\" cried Ruby; \"and I'm sure you're a _good_ Fairy, and can do all sorts of wonderful things.\"  \"I used to, my child, in my younger days, but my powers are not what they were, and I seldom exercise them now, because it exhausts me too severely to do so. Once there were several of us Court Godmothers, but I am the only one left, and my health is so poor that I can do little for my God-children but give them moral teaching and wise counsel. However, such good offices as I can still render shall be entirely at your service.\"  \"You are very kind,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, resenting the other's air of patronage, \"but all my children are already provided with God-parents. As you tell me you are a Fairy,\" she continued, \"I suppose I must accept your word for it--but it will take a great deal more than that to make me believe that we are in Fairyland.\"  \"I thought,\" said the Fairy, \"you already knew that the name of this country is Märchenland.\"  It should be said here once for all that the Wibberley-Stimpsons found no difficulty in understanding, or making themselves perfectly intelligible to any Märchenlanders, although they always had a curious feeling that they were conversing in a foreign language.  \"Whatever the country is called,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson aggressively, \"I should like some explanation of that Baron Troitz's conduct in entrapping us into coming here. I was distinctly given to understand that I had been chosen to be the Queen at our local Pageant, and that we were being taken to talk over the arrangements with the Committee. Now he has gone off in the most ungentlemanly way, and left us stranded and helpless here!\"  \"You must have misunderstood the good Baron,\" said the Fairy Vogelflug; \"and he is far too loyal to desert you. He has merely hastened on to Eswareinmal, the city whose walls and towers you see yonder, to prepare for your reception. As you probably know, he has devoted himself with the most untiring zeal to his mission of seeking you out and restoring you to your inheritance.\"  \"He never said a word about that to me--not a word. If I am really entitled to any property in this country, I should be glad to know where it is situated, and what is its exact value.\"  \"Then,\" said the Fairy, \"I may inform you that you are entitled, as the daughter of your late Father--our long-lost and much-lamented Prince Chrysopras--to no less a possession than the Crown of Märchenland.\"  \"You--you don't _say_ so!\" gasped Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson. \"The Crown of--Sidney, did you hear _that_.\"  \"It's some mistake, my dear,\" he said. \"Must be! ... My wife's father, Ma'am, though in some respects--a--a remarkable character, was never a Prince--at least that _I've_ heard of.\"  \"It doesn't at all follow, Sidney,\" said his wife in a nettled tone, \"that anything you don't happen to have heard of is not a fact. There always _was_ a mystery about poor dear Papa's origin. He was most reticent about it--even with me. And I know it was rumoured that Prinsley was not his real name. So it would not surprise me in the least if Mrs. Fogleplug turned out to be right, though I cannot say till she gives us further particulars.\"  \"I will do so most willingly,\" said the Fairy. \"But as it will take me some time to relate them, I should strongly advise you all to sit down.\"  They seated themselves round her in a semicircle, and presently she began:  \"You must know,\" she said, \"that our mighty and gracious Sovereign, the late King Smaragd, was twice wedded. By his first wife he had an only son, Prince Chrysopras, a gallant and goodly prince, beloved not only by his father, but by the whole nation. Well, after mourning his first wife for a longer period than is customary, King Smaragd took to himself another, who was much younger than himself, besides being marvellously beautiful.\"  \"And of course she hated the poor Prince,\" said Ruby. \"Stepmothers always do in the stories.\"  \"I have not said she hated him,\" said the Court Godmother, who did not like her points to be anticipated. \"On the contrary, she treated him with every mark of affection, and was constantly bestowing on him gifts of the costliest description. One day she presented him with a wondrous mechanical horse, fiercer and more mettlesome than even the steeds that are born in Märchenland.\"  \"Motor-bike, what,\" suggested Clarence sapiently.  \"A mechanical horse is what I _said_,\" repeated the Fairy, \"resembling others in shape and beauty, but made of metal. Prince Chrysopras, being a skilful and fearless horseman----\"  \"Indeed he was!\" put in Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson. \"He used to ride regularly in the Row, almost to the last. On 'Joggles,' such a dear brown fat cob. He was one of what I believe was known as 'The Liver Brigade' ... a fact which for some reason I can't pretend to fathom seems to be causing you amusement, Miss Heritage.\"  Daphne, whose sense of humour was occasionally an inconvenience to her, had certainly found the notion of a Fairy Prince in the Liver Brigade a little too much for her gravity. However, she attributed her lapse to the name of the horse.  \"It was the name they gave it at the Livery Stables,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson. \"And I really cannot see myself--but we are interrupting this good lady here.\"  \"You are,\" said the Fairy. \"I was about to say that Prince Chrysopras was greatly delighted by his Royal Stepmother's gift, and at once leapt on the back of the strange steed.\"  \"What I call asking for trouble,\" commented Clarence.  \"_I_ know what happened!\" Ruby struck in eagerly. \"It flew right up into the air with him, and poor Grandpapa fell off.\"  \"If he had, none of you would be here at the moment,\" said the Fairy. \"Don't be in such a hurry, my child. He was much too good a rider to fall off. But the horse flew up and up with him till both could no longer be seen. The remains of the steed were found long afterwards on a mountain top. But nothing more was ever seen of the Prince, who was supposed to have perished in one of our lakes.\"  \"Then he must have fallen off after all,\" insisted Ruby.  \"No, no, Ruby,\" said her mother, with a sense that, where the credit of her family was concerned, nothing was too improbable for belief; \"the horse flew with him to England, or _somewhere_ in Europe--or else he couldn't have met your dear grandmother, whom none of you ever saw, for she died long before you were born. And I expect that, after he got off, the horse flew back again, and was just able to get to Märchenland before the machinery broke down. And dear Papa very naturally would not care for people to know that he had got there by such peculiar means, which accounts for my never having heard of it before.\"  \"Exactly,\" said the Fairy Vogelflug; \"but King Smaragd only knew that his son was lost to him, and when he discovered that the horse was enchanted, and that his Queen had bribed the Hereditary Grand Magician to construct it, his anger knew no bounds.\"  \"Enough to annoy anybody,\" said Mr. Wibberley-Stimpson. \"I should certainly----\"  \"He ordered,\" the Fairy went on, without appearing to feel any interest in what Mr. Stimpson would have done in similar circumstances, \"both the Queen and the Grand Magician to be enclosed in a barrel, the inside of which had been set with sharp nails, and rolled down into the lake from the top of the mountain.\"  \"I should say myself,\" remarked Mr. Stimpson, \"that that was going a little too far. But he certainly had great provocation.\"  \"He also commanded that all wizards and enchanters should renounce their practices for ever, and adopt some other calling, or be banished from the Country.\"  \"There,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson approvingly, \"I think he was _so_ right. I would never encourage any of those clairvoyant people myself. And did he marry a third wife at all?\"  \"Not if he was wise!\" said Clarence.  \"No, although it grieved him sorely that he had no heir to succeed him. But towards the end of his days, he dreamed repeatedly that his son was yet living. He beheld him in these visions a wanderer in some far-off land, earning his bread as a musician, for in Music he had rare skill.\"  \"I fancy he must have given it up when he took to Finance,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, \"though he kept his taste for it. I well remember his buying a beautiful orchestrion which used to be in the Picture Gallery.\"  \"Well,\" pursued the Fairy, \"in further dreams it was revealed to the King that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28459"],["title","In Brief Authority (#7)"],["body","son was married to one, who, though not of his own race or rank, was both gently born and very fair to see.\"  \"Pollentine was the maiden name of your Grandmother on _my_ side, my dears,\" explained Mrs. Stimpson to her family. \"She must have been good-looking as a girl, judging by a daguerrotype I had of her. Her father was a highly distinguished Auctioneer and Estate Agent in East Croydon, as I daresay was also revealed in the King's dream.\"  \"Of that I can say nothing,\" replied the Court Godmother; \"but I know that further visions showed him his son as a widower with an only daughter, and later still that he was no longer living. And so much was the King impressed that he caused a search to be made for this grand-daughter of his in every country that is known to us. Even when he lay on his death-bed he did not give up hope that she would be found, and so he left his Kingdom in charge of his trusted favourite Marshal Federhelm as Regent, with strict injunctions to continue seeking for the missing Queen.\"  \"And how,\" inquired Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, \"did the Marshal manage to find me out?\"  \"It was not he. He soon convinced himself that all further endeavours were useless. No, it is to the devotion of our worthy Court Chamberlain, the Baron Treuherz von Eisenbänden, that your discovery is owing. He had grieved so deeply to see Märchenland without a Sovereign that, after the example of 'Faithful John,' the founder of his family, he had placed iron hoops round his chest to keep his heart from breaking.\"  \"We heard 'em go,\" said Clarence; \"thought it was only his braces.\"  \"At length,\" continued the Fairy, \"the Baron went in secret to Xuriel, the Astrologer Royal, and induced him to consult the stars. Which Xuriel did, and by much study and intricate calculation he succeeded in ascertaining the exact spot in the other world where the Queen would be discovered, and even the means by which she might be recognised.\"  \"Ah,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, \"I shall begin to believe in Astronomy after this. But even now I don't _quite_ understand how Baron Troitz got to 'Inglegarth.'\"  \"That was by _my_ assistance. I placed my travelling car at his service, with the wise storks that fly straight to any place to which they are directed, even though they may never have heard of it before. Happily for Märchenland, Xuriel's calculations have proved correct, except that he did not foresee that the Baron would bring back two Sovereigns instead of one.\"  \"What--is the Gov'nor going to be King?\" inquired Clarence. \"My hat!\"  \"That would be ridiculous, Clarence,\" said his mother, \"when your Father hasn't a drop of Royal blood in his veins! He can't even rank as Prince Consort!\"  \"Not so, my dear, not so,\" corrected the Fairy, \"by the custom of Märchenland, anyone who weds the Sovereign shares the throne, and your husband will be as truly the King of this Country as you will be its Queen.\"  \"Oh, is _that_ the rule?\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, not best pleased. \"Well, Sidney, I trust you will show yourself equal to your position, that is all.\"  \"I trust so, my love,\" he replied uneasily. \"It--it's come on me at rather short notice. However!\"  \"If Daddy and Mums are King and Queen,\" asked Ruby, \"will Edna and me be Princesses?\"  \"Undoubtedly you will,\" said the Court Godmother.  \"Then Clarence will be a Prince. So you see, Miss Heritage, dear, you _have_ met a Prince after all!\"  \"Shut up, Kiddie!\" said the new Crown Prince in some confusion.  \"And what will Miss Heritage be, Mummy?\"  \"Miss Heritage will be what she was before, my dear--your governess.\"  \"But I shan't want one any more--we're in Fairyland now--and Fairy Princesses haven't got to do lessons. Oh, Mums, couldn't you make Miss Heritage a Princess too? Do!\"  \"Why not?\" said the Fairy, glancing at Daphne, whose colour had risen slightly. \"Anybody might very well take her to be one as it is.\"  \"Miss Heritage,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, \"has, I am sure, too much good sense to expect a title of any kind. She will continue to be my daughter's instructress, and I may possibly find a place for her as Mistress of the Robes or something; but it's much too early to say anything definite at--Really, Edna,\" she broke off suddenly, \"how you can sit there calmly reading as if nothing had happened!\"  \"I was merely running through my lecture-notes again, Mother,\" said Edna. \"If I _am_ a Princess,\" she added, for the benefit of the Court Godmother, \"that is no reason why I shouldn't go on cultivating my mind.\"  \"Now you're a Princess, my dear,\" replied her mother, \"it doesn't signify to anybody whether your mind is cultivated or not.\"  \"It signifies a great deal to _me_, mother,\" said Edna, and resumed the study of her notes with an air of conscious merit.  \"I must say _one_ thing, Mrs. Fogleplug,\" Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson proceeded; \"it would have been more considerate if I had been given proper notice, and a reasonable time to prepare for such a complete change as this. I do feel _that_.\"  She did; it was a great deprivation to her to have lost the opportunity of mentioning casually to her Gablehurst friends--and Lady Harriet especially--that she would shortly be leaving them to occupy a throne.  \"Precisely my own feeling,\" said Mr. Stimpson, thinking regretfully how the news would have made that confounded fellow Thistleton sit up, and of the sensation it might have produced in the train to the City. \"It is, to say the least of it, unfortunate that I had no time to communicate with the other members of my firm.\"  \"And there's Clarence, too!\" said his fond mother. \"His Company will be quite helpless without him!\"  \"They may be in a bit of a hole at first,\" he admitted, thankful now that he had said nothing about his resignation, or the readiness with which it had been accepted. \"Still, no fellow is indispensable. What?\"  The Fairy explained that haste had been unavoidable, as it might have been injurious to the storks if they had remained longer in a climate to which they were unaccustomed.  \"But why send storks to fetch us at all?\" demanded Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson. \"Why not some more modern conveyance?... There they are again with the car--coming back for us, I expect.... Yes, I can make out Baron Troitz and the trumpeters--and there seems to be a gentleman in armour with them.\"  \"The Regent, Marshal Federhelm,\" said the Fairy. \"He is coming to offer his congratulations.\"  \"Is he?\" cried Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, scrambling to her feet again in some dismay. \"A Regent! I--I wish I knew the proper way of addressing him!\"  The storks by this time had brought the car to ground, and were now standing about on one leg with folded wings and an air of detachment. The Marshal alighted and advanced slowly towards the Stimpsons while the heralds sounded their trumpets.  He made a formidable and warrior-like figure in his golden half-armour of a kind unknown to antiquarians, and great jack-boots of gilded leather. He was tall, and the towering mass of waving feathers that crowned his helmet made him look taller still. His vizor was raised, showing a swarthy, hook-nosed face, with quick, restless eyes like a lizard's, a fierce moustache, and a bristling beard that spread out in a stiff black fan.  \"_You_ had better speak to him, Sidney,\" whispered his wife, overcome by sudden panic; \"I really can't.\"  \"Er--\" began Mr. Stimpson nervously, \"I believe I have the pleasure of addressing the Regent. We--we're the new King and Queen, you know, and these are the other members of the family.\"  The Marshal seemed a little taken aback at first, but he promptly recovered himself, and bending so low that his feathers brushed Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson's nose, he placed in her hand a small velvet-covered baton studded with gold stars.  \"Oh, thank you very much, I'm sure,\" she said. \"It's quite charming. Has it got an address or anything inside it?\"  \"The symbol of my authority, your Majesty,\" he said, with soldierly curtness. \"I have long desired to surrender it to hands more worthy to govern than mine.\"  \"Very handsome of you to say so,\" replied Mr. Stimpson; \"but I daresay you aren't altogether sorry to get out of it, eh?\"  \"It is too lofty a position, Sire, for a rough, simple warrior like myself,\" he said. \"Nothing but a sense of duty to my country would have made me accept the Regency at all.\"  \"I am sure,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, \"we shall find you have carried on the Kingdom for us as satisfactorily as possible.\"  \"The people appeared to think so, your Majesty. But I am forgetting the chief purpose I am here for. I have the honour to announce that the procession will shortly be on its way to escort your Majesties to your Coronation, which is to take place this morning in the great church of Eswareinmal.\"  \"_Coronation!_\" Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson almost screamed. \"Before we have so much as had our breakfast! And in these things we are wearing now! I never heard of anything so preposterous!\"  \"I don't care much myself,\" said Mr. Stimpson, \"about being crowned on an empty--without having had something to eat--if it's only an egg.\"  \"If they're going to crown the Guv'nor in a dinner-jacket and white tie,\" Clarence muttered to Edna, \"we shall never hear the last of it, that's all!\"  \"There is nothing to make a fuss about, my dear,\" said the Court Godmother to Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, as though she were addressing a froward child; \"look behind you, and you will see that everything you may require is already provided.\"  They looked and saw two velvet Marquees, one striped in broad bands of apple-green and mazarine blue, the other in pale rose and cream, which a party of attendants had just finished putting up. \"In those pavilions,\" continued the Fairy, \"you will find not only food prepared for you, but robes such as are fitting for a Coronation. You will have plenty of time both to eat and change your dress before the procession can possibly arrive.\"  \"She's not likely to have got our measurements"]]]
