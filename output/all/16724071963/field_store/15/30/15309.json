The old man tried another listener.  \"What have they got in those sacks, Captain?\" he inquired, as that great being passed them in his never ending parade to and fro on the deck.  The Captain paused in his march, and towered over the travellers--tall, grave, and serenely self-satisfied.  \"Fishermen,\" he explained, \"are often passengers in My ship. These five are from Mhruxi--the place we last touched at--and that's the way they carry their money. The money of this island is heavy, gentlemen, but it costs little, as you may guess. We buy it from them by weight--about five shillings a pound. I fancy a ten pound-note would buy all those sacks.\"  By this time the old man had closed his eyes--in order, no doubt, to concentrate his thoughts on these interesting facts; but the Captain failed to realise his motive, and with a grunt resumed his monotonous march.  Meanwhile the fishermen were getting so noisy over the weighing-machine that one of the sailors took the precaution of carrying off all the weights, leaving them to amuse themselves with such substitutes in the form of winch-handles, belaying-pins, &c., as they could find. This brought their excitement to a speedy end: they carefully hid their sacks in the folds of the jib that lay on the deck near the tourists, and strolled away.  When next the Captain's heavy footfall passed, the younger man roused himself to speak.  \"_What_ did you call the place those fellows came from, Captain?\" he asked.  \"Mhruxi, sir.\"  \"And the one we are bound for?\"  The Captain took a long breath, plunged into the word, and came out of it nobly. \"They call it Kgovjni, sir.\"  \"K--I give it up!\" the young man faintly said.  He stretched out his hand for a glass of iced water which the compassionate steward had brought him a minute ago, and had set down, unluckily, just outside the shadow of the umbrella. It was scalding hot, and he decided not to drink it. The effort of making this resolution, coming close on the fatiguing conversation he had just gone through, was too much for him: he sank back among the cushions in silence.  His father courteously tried to make amends for his _nonchalance_.  \"Whereabouts are we now, Captain?\" said he, \"Have you any idea?\"  The Captain cast a pitying look on the ignorant landsman. \"I could tell you _that_, sir,\" he said, in a tone of lofty condescension, \"to an inch!\"  \"You don't say so!\" the old man remarked, in a tone of languid surprise.  \"And mean so,\" persisted the Captain. \"Why, what do you suppose would become of My ship, if I were to lose My Longitude and My Latitude? Could _you_ make anything of My Dead Reckoning?\"  \"Nobody could, I'm sure!\" the other heartily rejoined.  But he had overdone it.  \"It's _perfectly_ intelligible,\" the Captain said, in an offended tone, \"to any one that understands such things.\" With these words he moved away, and began giving orders to the men, who were preparing to hoist the jib.  Our tourists watched the operation with such interest that neither of them remembered the five money-bags, which in another moment, as the wind filled out the jib, were whirled overboard and fell heavily into the sea.  But the poor fishermen had not so easily forgotten their property. In a moment they had rushed to the spot, and stood uttering cries of fury, and pointing, now to the sea, and now to the sailors who had caused the disaster.  The old man explained it to the Captain.  \"Let us make it up among us,\" he added in conclusion. \"Ten pounds will do it, I think you said?\"  [Illustration]  But the Captain put aside the suggestion with a wave of the hand.  \"No, sir!\" he said, in his grandest manner. \"You will excuse Me, I am sure; but these are My passengers. The accident has happened on board My ship, and under My orders. It is for Me to make compensation.\" He turned to the angry fishermen. \"Come here, my men!\" he said, in the Mhruxian dialect. \"Tell me the weight of each sack. I saw you weighing them just now.\"  Then ensued a perfect Babel of noise, as the five natives explained, all screaming together, how the sailors had carried off the weights, and they had done what they could with whatever came handy.  Two iron belaying-pins, three blocks, six holystones, four winch-handles, and a large hammer, were now carefully weighed, the Captain superintending and noting the results. But the matter did not seem to be settled, even then: an angry discussion followed, in which the sailors and the five natives all joined: and at last the Captain approached our tourists with a disconcerted look, which he tried to conceal under a laugh.  \"It's an absurd difficulty,\" he said. \"Perhaps one of you gentlemen can suggest something. It seems they weighed the sacks two at a time!\"  \"If they didn't have five separate weighings, of course you can't value them separately,\" the youth hastily decided.  \"Let's hear all about it,\" was the old man's more cautious remark.  \"They _did_ have five separate weighings,\" the Captain said, \"but--Well, it beats _me_ entirely!\" he added, in a sudden burst of candour. \"Here's the result. First and second sack weighed twelve pounds; second and third, thirteen and a half; third and fourth, eleven and a half; fourth and fifth, eight: and then they say they had only the large hammer left, and it took _three_ sacks to weigh it down--that's the first, third and fifth--and _they_ weighed sixteen pounds. There, gentlemen! Did you ever hear anything like _that_?\"  The old man muttered under his breath \"If only my sister were here!\" and looked helplessly at his son. His son looked at the five natives. The five natives looked at the Captain. The Captain looked at nobody: his eyes were cast down, and he seemed to be saying softly to himself \"Contemplate one another, gentlemen, if such be your good pleasure. _I_ contemplate _Myself_!\"     KNOT V.  OUGHTS AND CROSSES.     \"Look here, upon this picture, and on this.\"   \"And what made you choose the first train, Goosey?\" said Mad Mathesis, as they got into the cab. \"Couldn't you count better than _that_?\"  \"I took an extreme case,\" was the tearful reply. \"Our excellent preceptress always says 'When in doubt, my dears, take an extreme case.' And I _was_ in doubt.\"  \"Does it always succeed?\" her aunt enquired.  Clara sighed. \"Not _always_,\" she reluctantly admitted. \"And I can't make out why. One day she was telling the little girls--they make such a noise at tea, you know--'The more noise you make, the less jam you will have, and _vice vers秬.' And I thought they wouldn't know what '_vice vers秬' meant: so I explained it to them. I said 'If you make an infinite noise, you'll get no jam: and if you make no noise, you'll get an infinite lot of jam.' But our excellent preceptress said that wasn't a good instance. _Why_ wasn't it?\" she added plaintively.  Her aunt evaded the question. \"One sees certain objections to it,\" she said. \"But how did you work it with the Metropolitan trains? None of them go infinitely fast, I believe.\"  \"I called them hares and tortoises,\" Clara said--a little timidly, for she dreaded being laughed at. \"And I thought there couldn't be so many hares as tortoises on the Line: so I took an extreme case--one hare and an infinite number of tortoises.\"  \"An extreme case, indeed,\" her aunt remarked with admirable gravity: \"and a most dangerous state of things!\"  \"And I thought, if I went with a tortoise, there would be only _one_ hare to meet: but if I went with the hare--you know there were _crowds_ of tortoises!\"  \"It wasn't a bad idea,\" said the elder lady, as they left the cab, at the entrance of Burlington House. \"You shall have another chance to-day. We'll have a match in marking pictures.\"  Clara brightened up. \"I should like to try again, very much,\" she said. \"I'll take more care this time. How are we to play?\"  To this question Mad Mathesis made no reply: she was busy drawing lines down the margins of the catalogue. \"See,\" she said after a minute, \"I've drawn three columns against the names of the pictures in the long room, and I want you to fill them with oughts and crosses--crosses for good marks and oughts for bad. The first column is for choice of subject, the second for arrangement, the third for colouring. And these are the conditions of the match. You must give three crosses to two or three pictures. You must give two crosses to four or five----\"  \"Do you mean _only_ two crosses?\" said Clara. \"Or may I count the three-cross pictures among the two-cross pictures?\"  \"Of course you may,\" said her aunt. \"Any one, that has _three_ eyes, may be said to have _two_ eyes, I suppose?\"  Clara followed her aunt's dreamy gaze across the crowded gallery, half-dreading to find that there was a three-eyed person in sight.  \"And you must give one cross to nine or ten.\"  \"And which wins the match?\" Clara asked, as she carefully entered these conditions on a blank leaf in her catalogue.  \"Whichever marks fewest pictures.\"  \"But suppose we marked the same number?\"  \"Then whichever uses most marks.\"  Clara considered. \"I don't think it's much of a match,\" she said. \"I shall mark nine pictures, and give three crosses to three of them, two crosses to two more, and one cross each to all the rest.\"  \"Will you, indeed?\" said her aunt. \"Wait till you've heard all the conditions, my impetuous child. You must give three oughts to one or two pictures, two oughts to three or four, and one ought to eight or nine. I don't want you to be _too_ hard on the R.A.'s.\"  Clara quite gasped as she wrote down all these fresh conditions. \"It's a great deal worse than Circulating Decimals!\" she said. \"But I'm determined to win, all the same!\"  Her aunt smiled grimly. \"We can begin _here_,\" she said, as they paused before a gigantic picture, which the catalogue informed them was the \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29042"],["title","A Tangled Tale (#3)"],["body","of Lieutenant Brown, mounted on his favorite elephant.\"  \"He looks awfully conceited!\" said Clara. \"I don't think he was the elephant's favorite Lieutenant. What a hideous picture it is! And it takes up room enough for twenty!\"  \"Mind what you say, my dear!\" her aunt interposed. \"It's by an R.A.!\"  But Clara was quite reckless. \"I don't care who it's by!\" she cried. \"And I shall give it three bad marks!\"  Aunt and niece soon drifted away from each other in the crowd, and for the next half-hour Clara was hard at work, putting in marks and rubbing them out again, and hunting up and down for suitable pictures. This she found the hardest part of all. \"I _can't_ find the one I want!\" she exclaimed at last, almost crying with vexation.  \"What is it you want to find, my dear?\" The voice was strange to Clara, but so sweet and gentle that she felt attracted to the owner of it, even before she had seen her; and when she turned, and met the smiling looks of two little old ladies, whose round dimpled faces, exactly alike, seemed never to have known a care, it was as much as she could do--as she confessed to Aunt Mattie afterwards--to keep herself from hugging them both.  \"I was looking for a picture,\" she said, \"that has a good subject--and that's well arranged--but badly coloured.\"  The little old ladies glanced at each other in some alarm. \"Calm yourself, my dear,\" said the one who had spoken first, \"and try to remember which it was. What _was_ the subject?\"  \"Was it an elephant, for instance?\" the other sister suggested. They were still in sight of Lieutenant Brown.  \"I don't know, indeed!\" Clara impetuously replied. \"You know it doesn't matter a bit what the subject _is_, so long as it's a good one!\"  Once more the sisters exchanged looks of alarm, and one of them whispered something to the other, of which Clara caught only the one word \"mad.\"  \"They mean Aunt Mattie, of course,\" she said to herself--fancying, in her innocence, that London was like her native town, where everybody knew everybody else. \"If you mean my aunt,\" she added aloud, \"she's _there_--just three pictures beyond Lieutenant Brown.\"  \"Ah, well! Then you'd better go to her, my dear!\" her new friend said, soothingly. \"_She'll_ find you the picture you want. Good-bye, dear!\"  \"Good-bye, dear!\" echoed the other sister, \"Mind you don't lose sight of your aunt!\" And the pair trotted off into another room, leaving Clara rather perplexed at their manner.  \"They're real darlings!\" she soliloquised. \"I wonder why they pity me so!\" And she wandered on, murmuring to herself \"It must have two good marks, and----\"     KNOT VI.  HER RADIANCY.     \"One piecee thing that my have got,      Maskee[A] that thing my no can do.    You talkee you no sabey what?                Bamboo.\"   They landed, and were at once conducted to the Palace. About half way they were met by the Governor, who welcomed them in English--a great relief to our travellers, whose guide could speak nothing but Kgovjnian.  \"I don't half like the way they grin at us as we go by!\" the old man whispered to his son. \"And why do they say 'Bamboo!' so often?\"  \"It alludes to a local custom,\" replied the Governor, who had overheard the question. \"Such persons as happen in any way to displease Her Radiancy are usually beaten with rods.\"  [Illustration: \"WHY DO THEY SAY 'BAMBOO!' SO OFTEN?\"]  The old man shuddered. \"A most objectional local custom!\" he remarked with strong emphasis. \"I wish we had never landed! Did you notice that black fellow, Norman, opening his great mouth at us? I verily believe he would like to eat us!\"  Norman appealed to the Governor, who was walking at his other side. \"Do they often eat distinguished strangers here?\" he said, in as indifferent a tone as he could assume.  \"Not often--not ever!\" was the welcome reply. \"They are not good for it. Pigs we eat, for they are fat. This old man is thin.\"  \"And thankful to be so!\" muttered the elder traveller. \"Beaten we shall be without a doubt. It's a comfort to know it won't be Beaten without the B! My dear boy, just look at the peacocks!\"  They were now walking between two unbroken lines of those gorgeous birds, each held in check, by means of a golden collar and chain, by a black slave, who stood well behind, so as not to interrupt the view of the glittering tail, with its network of rustling feathers and its hundred eyes.  The Governor smiled proudly. \"In your honour,\" he said, \"Her Radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional peacocks. She will, no doubt, decorate you, before you go, with the usual Star and Feathers.\"  \"It'll be Star without the S!\" faltered one of his hearers.  \"Come, come! Don't lose heart!\" said the other. \"All this is full of charm for me.\"  \"You are young, Norman,\" sighed his father; \"young and light-hearted. For me, it is Charm without the C.\"  \"The old one is sad,\" the Governor remarked with some anxiety. \"He has, without doubt, effected some fearful crime?\"  \"But I haven't!\" the poor old gentleman hastily exclaimed. \"Tell him I haven't, Norman!\"  \"He has not, as yet,\" Norman gently explained. And the Governor repeated, in a satisfied tone, \"Not as yet.\"  \"Yours is a wondrous country!\" the Governor resumed, after a pause. \"Now here is a letter from a friend of mine, a merchant, in London. He and his brother went there a year ago, with a thousand pounds apiece; and on New-Year's-day they had sixty thousand pounds between them!\"  \"How did they do it?\" Norman eagerly exclaimed. Even the elder traveller looked excited.  The Governor handed him the open letter. \"Anybody can do it, when once they know how,\" so ran this oracular document. \"We borrowed nought: we stole nought. We began the year with only a thousand pounds apiece: and last New-Year's-day we had sixty thousand pounds between us--sixty thousand golden sovereigns!\"  Norman looked grave and thoughtful as he handed back the letter. His father hazarded one guess. \"Was it by gambling?\"  \"A Kgovjnian never gambles,\" said the Governor gravely, as he ushered them through the palace gates. They followed him in silence down a long passage, and soon found themselves in a lofty hall, lined entirely with peacocks' feathers. In the centre was a pile of crimson cushions, which almost concealed the figure of Her Radiancy--a plump little damsel, in a robe of green satin dotted with silver stars, whose pale round face lit up for a moment with a half-smile as the travellers bowed before her, and then relapsed into the exact expression of a wax doll, while she languidly murmured a word or two in the Kgovjnian dialect.  The Governor interpreted. \"Her Radiancy welcomes you. She notes the Impenetrable Placidity of the old one, and the Imperceptible Acuteness of the youth.\"  Here the little potentate clapped her hands, and a troop of slaves instantly appeared, carrying trays of coffee and sweetmeats, which they offered to the guests, who had, at a signal from the Governor, seated themselves on the carpet.  \"Sugar-plums!\" muttered the old man. \"One might as well be at a confectioner's! Ask for a penny bun, Norman!\"  \"Not so loud!\" his son whispered. \"Say something complimentary!\" For the Governor was evidently expecting a speech.  \"We thank Her Exalted Potency,\" the old man timidly began. \"We bask in the light of her smile, which----\"  \"The words of old men are weak!\" the Governor interrupted angrily. \"Let the youth speak!\"  \"Tell her,\" cried Norman, in a wild burst of eloquence, \"that, like two grasshoppers in a volcano, we are shrivelled up in the presence of Her Spangled Vehemence!\"  \"It is well,\" said the Governor, and translated this into Kgovjnian. \"I am now to tell you,\" he proceeded, \"what Her Radiancy requires of you before you go. The yearly competition for the post of Imperial Scarf-maker is just ended; you are the judges. You will take account of the rate of work, the lightness of the scarves, and their warmth. Usually the competitors differ in one point only. Thus, last year, Fifi and Gogo made the same number of scarves in the trial-week, and they were equally light; but Fifi's were twice as warm as Gogo's and she was pronounced twice as good. But this year, woe is me, who can judge it? Three competitors are here, and they differ in all points! While you settle their claims, you shall be lodged, Her Radiancy bids me say, free of expense--in the best dungeon, and abundantly fed on the best bread and water.\"  The old man groaned. \"All is lost!\" he wildly exclaimed. But Norman heeded him not: he had taken out his note-book, and was calmly jotting down the particulars.  \"Three they be,\" the Governor proceeded, \"Lolo, Mimi, and Zuzu. Lolo makes 5 scarves while Mimi makes 2; but Zuzu makes 4 while Lolo makes 3! Again, so fairylike is Zuzu's handiwork, 5 of her scarves weigh no more than one of Lolo's; yet Mimi's is lighter still--5 of hers will but balance 3 of Zuzu's! And for warmth one of Mimi's is equal to 4 of Zuzu's; yet one of Lolo's is as warm as 3 of Mimi's!\"  Here the little lady once more clapped her hands.  \"It is our signal of dismissal!\" the Governor hastily said. \"Pay Her Radiancy your farewell compliments--and walk out backwards.\"  The walking part was all the elder tourist could manage. Norman simply said \"Tell Her Radiancy we are transfixed by the spectacle of Her Serene Brilliance, and bid an agonized farewell to her Condensed Milkiness!\"  \"Her Radiancy is pleased,\" the Governor reported, after duly translating this. \"She casts on you a glance from Her Imperial Eyes, and is confident that you will catch it!\"  \"That I warrant we shall!\" the elder traveller moaned to himself distractedly.  Once more they bowed low, and then followed the Governor down a winding staircase to the Imperial Dungeon, which they found to be lined with coloured marble, lighted from the roof, and splendidly though not luxuriously furnished with a bench of polished malachite. \"I trust you will not delay the calculation,\" the Governor said, ushering them in with much"]]]
