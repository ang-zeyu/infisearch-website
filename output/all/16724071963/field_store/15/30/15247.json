This     condition is not commonly congenital, but comes on in youth, the     liability to it being well known to be transmissible from parent to     child. The change from the spherical to the ovoidal shape seems the     immediate {9} consequence of something like inflammation of the coats,     under which they yield, and there is ground for believing that it may     often originate in causes acting directly on the individual affected,     and may thenceforward become transmissible. When both parents are     myopic Mr. Bowman has observed the hereditary tendency in this     direction to be heightened, and some of the children to be myopic at an     earlier age or in a higher degree than their parents. Thirdly,     squinting is a familiar example of hereditary transmission: it is     frequently a result of such optical defects as have been above     mentioned; but the more primary and uncomplicated forms of it are also     sometimes in a marked degree transmitted in a family. Fourthly,     _Cataract_, or opacity of the crystalline lens, is commonly observed in     persons whose parents have been similarly affected, and often at an     earlier age in the children than in the parents. Occasionally more than     one child in a family is thus afflicted, one of whose parents or other     relation presents the senile form of the complaint. When cataract     affects several members of a family in the same generation, it is often     seen to commence at about the same age in each; _e.g._, in one family     several infants or young persons may suffer from it; in another,     several persons of middle age. Mr. Bowman also informs me that he has     occasionally seen, in several members of the same family, various     defects in either the right or left eye; and Mr. White Cooper has often     seen peculiarities of vision confined to one eye reappearing in the     same eye in the offspring.[17]      The following cases are taken from an able paper by Mr. W. Sedgwick,     and from Dr. Prosper Lucas.[18] Amaurosis, either congenital or coming     on late in life, and causing total blindness, is often inherited; it     has been observed in three successive generations. Congenital absence     of the iris has likewise been transmitted for three generations, a     cleft-iris for four generations, being limited in this latter case to     the males of the family. Opacity of the cornea and congenital smallness     of the eyes have been inherited. Portal records a curious case, in     which a father and two sons were rendered blind, whenever the head was     bent downwards, apparently owing to the crystalline lens, with its     capsule, slipping through an unusually large pupil into the anterior     chamber of the eye. Day-blindness, or imperfect vision under a bright     light, is inherited, as is night-blindness, or an incapacity to see     except under a strong light: a case has been recorded, by M. Cunier, of     this latter defect having affected eighty-five members of the same     family during six generations. The singular incapacity of     distinguishing colours, which has been called _Daltonism_, is     notoriously hereditary, and has been traced through five generations,     in which it was confined to the female sex.      With respect to the colour of the iris: deficiency of colouring matter     is well known to be hereditary in albinoes. The iris of one eye being     of a different colour from that of the other, and the iris being     spotted, are cases which have been inherited. Mr. Sedgwick gives, in     addition, on the {10} authority of Dr. Osborne,[19] the following     curious instance of strong inheritance: a family of sixteen sons and     five daughters all had eyes \"resembling in miniature the markings on     the back of a tortoiseshell cat.\" The mother of this large family had     three sisters and a brother all similarly marked, and they derived this     peculiarity from their mother, who belonged to a family notorious for     transmitting it to their posterity.      Finally, Dr. Lucas emphatically remarks that there is not one single     faculty of the eye which is not subject to anomalies; and not one which     is not subjected to the principle of inheritance. Mr. Bowman agrees     with the general truth of this proposition; which of course does not     imply that all malformations are necessarily inherited; this would not     even follow if both parents were affected by an anomaly which in most     cases was transmissible.  Even if no single fact had been known with respect to the inheritance of disease and malformations by man, the evidence would have been ample in the case of the horse. And this might have been expected, as horses breed much quicker than man, are matched with care, and are highly valued. I have consulted many works, and the unanimity of the belief by veterinaries of all nations in the transmission of various morbid tendencies is surprising. Authors, who have had wide experience, give in detail many singular cases, and assert that contracted feet, with the numerous contingent evils, of ring-bones, curbs, splints, spavin, founder and weakness of the front legs, roaring or broken and thick wind, melanosis, specific ophthalmia, and blindness (the great French veterinary Hazard going so far as to say that a blind race could soon be formed), crib-biting, jibbing, and ill-temper, are all plainly hereditary. Youatt sums up by saying \"there is scarcely a malady to which the horse is subject which is not hereditary;\" and M. Bernard adds that the doctrine \"that there is scarcely a disease which does not run in the stock, is gaining new advocates every day.\"[20] So it {11} is in regard to cattle, with consumption, good and bad teeth, fine skin, &c. &c. But enough, and more than enough, has been said on disease. Andrew Knight, from his own experience, asserts that disease is hereditary with plants; and this assertion is endorsed by Lindley.[21]  Seeing how hereditary evil qualities are, it is fortunate that good health, vigour, and longevity are equally inherited. It was formerly a well-known practice, when annuities were purchased to be received during the lifetime of a nominee, to search out a person belonging to a family of which many members had lived to extreme old age. As to the inheritance of vigour and endurance, the English race-horse offers an excellent instance. Eclipse begot 334, and King Herod 497 winners. A \"cock-tail\" is a horse not purely bred, but with only one-eighth or one-sixteenth impure blood in his veins, yet very few instances have ever occurred of such horses having won a great race. They are sometimes as fleet for short distances as thoroughbreds, but as Mr. Robson, the great trainer, asserts, they are deficient in wind, and cannot keep up the pace. Mr. Lawrence also remarks, \"perhaps no instance has ever occurred of a three-part-bred horse saving his '_distance_' in running two miles with thoroughbred racers.\" It has been stated by Cecil, that when unknown horses, whose parents were not celebrated, have unexpectedly won great races, as in the case of Priam, they can always be proved to be descended on both sides, through many generations, from first-rate ancestors. On the Continent, Baron Cameronn challenges, in a German veterinary periodical, the opponents of the English race-horse, to name one good horse on the Continent which has not some English race-blood in his veins.[22]  With respect to the transmission of the many slight, but {12} infinitely diversified characters, by which the domestic races of animals and plants are distinguished, nothing need be said; for the very existence of persistent races proclaims the power of inheritance.  A few special cases, however, deserve some consideration. It might have been anticipated, that deviations from the law of symmetry would not have been inherited. But Anderson[23] states that a rabbit produced in a litter a young animal having only one ear; and from this animal a breed was formed which steadily produced one-eared rabbits. He also mentions a bitch, with a single leg deficient, and she produced several puppies with the same deficiency. From Hofacker's account[24] it appears that a one-horned stag was seen in 1781 in a forest in Germany, in 1788 two, and afterwards, from year to year, many were observed with only one horn on the right side of the head. A cow lost a horn by suppuration,[25] and she produced three calves which had on the same side of the head, instead of a horn, a small bony lump attached merely to the skin; but we here approach the doubtful subject of inherited mutilations. A man who is left-handed, and a shell in which the spire turns in the wrong direction, are departures from the normal though a symmetrical condition, and they are well known to be inherited.      _Polydactylism._--Supernumerary fingers and toes are eminently liable,     as various authors have insisted, to transmission, but they are noticed     here chiefly on account of their occasional regrowth after amputation.     Polydactylism graduates[26] by multifarious steps from a mere cutaneous     appendage, not including any bone, to a double hand. But an additional     digit, supported on a metacarpal bone, and furnished with all the     proper muscles, nerves, and vessels, is sometimes so perfect, that it     escapes detection, unless the fingers are actually counted.     Occasionally there are several supernumerary digits; but usually only     one, making the total number six. This one may represent either a thumb     or finger, being attached to the inner or outer "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28897"],["title","The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Volume II (of 2) (#4)"],["body","of the hand.     Generally, through the law of correlation, both hands and feet are     similarly affected. I have tabulated the cases recorded in various     works or privately communicated {13} to me, of forty-six persons with     extra digits on one or both hands and feet; if in each case all four     extremities had been similarly affected, the table would have shown a     total of ninety-two hands and ninety-two feet each with six digits. As     it is, seventy-three hands and seventy-five feet were thus affected.     This proves, in contradiction to the result arrived at by Dr.     Struthers,[27] that the hands are not more frequently affected than the     feet.      The presence of more than five digits is a great anomaly, for this     number is not normally exceeded by any mammal, bird, or existing     reptile.[28] Nevertheless, supernumerary digits are strongly inherited;     they have been transmitted through five generations; and in some cases,     after disappearing for one, two, or even three generations, have     reappeared through reversion. These facts are rendered, as Professor     Huxley has observed, more remarkable from its being known in most cases     that the affected person had not married one similarly affected. In     such cases the child of the fifth generation would have only 1-32nd     part of the blood of his first sedigitated ancestor. Other cases are     rendered remarkable by the affection gathering force, as Dr. Struthers     has shown, in each generation, though in each the affected person had     married one not affected; moreover such additional digits are often     amputated soon after birth, and can seldom have been strengthened by     use. Dr. Struthers gives the following instance: in the first     generation an additional digit appeared on one hand; in the second, on     both hands; in the third, three brothers had both hands, and one of the     brothers a foot affected; and in the fourth generation all four limbs     were affected. Yet we must not over-estimate the force of inheritance.     Dr. Struthers asserts that cases of non-inheritance and of the first     appearance of additional digits in unaffected families are much more     frequent than cases of inheritance. Many other deviations of structure,     of a nature almost as anomalous as supernumerary digits, such as     deficient phalanges, thickened joints, crooked fingers, &c., are in     like manner strongly inherited, and are equally subject to intermission     with reversion, though in such cases there is no reason to suppose that     both parents had been similarly affected.[29]      {14}      Additional digits have been observed in negroes as well as in other     races of man, and in several of the lower animals. Six toes have been     described on the hind feet of the newt (_Salamandra cristata_), and, as     it is said, of the frog. It deserves notice from what follows, that the     six-toed newt, though adult, had preserved some of its larval     characters; for part of the hyoidal apparatus, which is properly     absorbed during the act of metamorphosis, was retained. In the dog, six     toes on the hinder feet have been transmitted through three     generations; and I have heard of a race of six-toed cats. In several     breeds of the fowl the hinder toe is double, and is generally     transmitted truly, as is well shown when Dorkings are crossed with     common four-toed breeds.[30] With animals which have properly less than     five digits, the number is sometimes increased to five, especially in     the front legs, though rarely carried beyond that number; but this is     due to the development of a digit already existing in a more or less     rudimentary state. Thus the dog has properly four toes behind, but in     the larger breeds a fifth toe is commonly, though not perfectly,     developed. Horses, which properly have one toe alone fully developed     with rudiments of the others, have been described with each foot     bearing two or three small separate hoofs: analogous facts have been     noticed with sheep, goats, and pigs.[31]      The most interesting point with respect to supernumerary digits is     their occasional regrowth after amputation. Mr. White[32] describes a     child, three years old, with a thumb double from the first joint. He     removed the lesser thumb, which was furnished with a nail; but to his     astonishment it grew again, and reproduced a nail. The child was then     taken to an eminent London surgeon, and the newly-grown thumb was     wholly removed by its socket-joint, but again it grew and reproduced a     nail. Dr. Struthers mentions a case of partial regrowth of an     additional thumb, amputated when the child was three months old; and     the late Dr. Falconer communicated to me an analogous case which had     fallen under his own observation. A gentleman, who first called my     attention to this subject, has given me the following facts which     occurred in his own family. He himself, two brothers, and a sister were     born with an extra digit to each extremity. His parents were not     affected, and there was no tradition in the family, or in the village     in which the family had long resided, of any member having been thus     affected. Whilst a child, both additional toes, which were attached by     bones, were rudely cut off; but the stump of one grew again, and a     second operation was performed in his thirty-third year.      {15}      He has had fourteen children, of whom three have inherited additional     digits; and one of them, when about six weeks old, was operated on by     an eminent surgeon. The additional finger, which was attached by bone     to the outer side of the hand, was removed at the joint; the wound     healed, but immediately the digit began growing; and in about three     months' time the stump was removed for the second time by the root. But     it has since grown again, and is now fully a third of an inch in     length, including a bone; so that it will for the third time have to be     operated on.      Now the normal digits in adult man and other mammals, in birds, and, as     I believe, in true reptiles, have no power of regrowth. The nearest     approach to this power is exhibited by the occasional reappearance in     man of imperfect nails on the stumps of his fingers after     amputation.[33] But man in his embryonic condition has a considerable     power of reproduction, for Sir J. Simpson[34] has several times     observed arms which had been cut off in the womb by bands of false     membrane, and which had grown again to a certain extent. In one     instance, the extremity was \"divided into three minute nodules, on two     of which small points of nails could be detected;\" so that these     nodules clearly represented fingers in process of regrowth. When,     however, we descend to the lower vertebrate classes, which are     generally looked at as representing the higher classes in their     embryonic condition, we find ample powers of regrowth. Spallanzani[35]     cut off the legs and tail of a salamander six times, and Bonnet eight     times, successively, and they were reproduced. An additional digit     beyond the proper number was occasionally formed after Bonnet had cut     off or had divided longitudinally the hand or foot, and in one instance     three additional digits were thus formed.[36] These latter cases appear     at first sight quite distinct from the congenital production of     additional digits in the higher animals; but theoretically, as we shall     see in a future chapter, they probably present no real difference. The     larvæ or tadpoles of the tailless Batrachians, but not the adults,[37]     are capable of reproducing lost members.[38] Lastly, as I have been     informed by Mr. J. J. Briggs and Mr. F. Buckland, when portions of the     pectoral and tail fins of various {16} fresh-water fish are cut off,     they are perfectly reproduced in about six weeks' time.  From these several facts we may infer that supernumerary digits in man retain to a certain extent an embryonic condition, and that they resemble in this respect the normal digits and limbs in the lower vertebrate classes. They also resemble the digits of some of the lower animals in the number exceeding five; for no mammal, bird, existing reptile, or amphibian (unless the tubercle on the hind feet of the toad and other tailless Batrachians be viewed as a digit) has more than five; whilst fishes sometimes have in their pectoral fins as many as twenty metacarpal and phalangeal bones, which, together with the bony filaments, apparently represent our digits with their nails. So, again, in certain extinct reptiles, namely, the Ichthyopterygia, \"the digits may be seven, eight, or nine in number, a significant mark,\" says Professor Owen, \"of piscine affinity.\"[39]  We encounter much difficulty in attempting to reduce these various facts to any rule or law. The inconstant number of the additional digits--their irregular attachment to either the inner or outer margin of the hand--the gradation which can be traced from a mere loose rudiment of a single digit to a completely double hand--the occasional appearance of additional digits in the salamander after a limb has been amputated--these various facts appear to indicate mere fluctuating monstrosity; and this perhaps is all that can be safely said. Nevertheless, as supernumerary digits in the higher animals, from their power of regrowth and from the number thus acquired exceeding five, partake of the nature of the digits in the lower vertebrate animals;--as they occur by no means rarely, and are transmitted with remarkable strength, though perhaps not more strongly than some other anomalies;--and as with animals which have fewer than five digits, when an additional one appears it is generally due to the development of a visible rudiment;--we are led in all cases to suspect, that,"]]]
