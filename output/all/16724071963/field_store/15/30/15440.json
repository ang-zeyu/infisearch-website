SANDWICHES   Sandwiches may be made from one of three or four kinds of bread; whole wheat bread, Boston brown or oatmeal bread, white bread and rye bread made into square, deep loaves; in fact, all bread used for sandwiches should be made especially for the purpose, so that the slices may be in good form, and sufficiently large to cut into fancy shapes.  The butter may be used plain, slightly softened or it may be seasoned and flavored with just a suspicion of paprika, a little white pepper, and a few drops of Worcestershire sauce.  For ordinary sandwiches use the bread without toasting. For canapés, toast is to be preferred. Sandwiches are principally used for buffet lunches or evening sociables, where only a light, substantial lunch is required. In these days they are made in great varieties. Almost all sorts of meat, if properly seasoned, may be made into delicious sandwiches. If the meat is slightly moistened with cream or olive oil, sandwiches for traveling, provided each one is carefully wrapped in oiled paper, will keep fresh three or four days. The small French rolls may have the centres scooped out, the spaces filled with chicken salad or chopped oysters, and served as sandwiches. The rolls may be made especially for that purpose, not more than two inches long and one and a half inches wide; with coffee, they make an attractive meal easily served.  Ordinary sandwiches may be made either square, triangular, long, narrow, round or crescent shaped. One slice of bread will usually make one round sandwich and one crescent, provided the cutting is done economically. Meat used for sandwiches should be chopped very fine and slightly moistened with cream, melted butter, olive oil or mayonnaise dressing well seasoned. Fish should be rubbed or pounded in a mortar; add enough sauce tartare to make it sufficiently moist to easily spread.  Turkey, chicken, game, tongue, beef and mutton, with their proper seasonings, moistened with either mayonnaise or French dressing, make exceedingly nice sandwiches.   To Keep Sandwiches  It is frequently necessary to make sandwiches several hours before they are needed. As they dry quickly they must be carefully wrapped or they will be unpalatable. Wring from cold water two ordinary tea towels; put one on top of the other. An old tablecloth will answer the purpose very well. As fast as the sandwiches are made put them on top of the damp towel; when you have the desired quantity, cover the top with moist lettuce leaves; fold over the towels, and put outside of this a perfectly dry, square cloth. Sandwiches will keep in this way for several hours, and in perfectly good condition. On a very warm day they may be covered all over with moist lettuce leaves; use the green ones that are not so palatable or sightly for garnishing.   Bread  To make good sandwiches, especially when one is a long way from a city, it is quite necessary to know how to make sandwich bread, which is quite different, or should be, from ordinary bread. Compressed yeast is always to be preferred, but if one cannot get it, the next best is good home-made yeast. Bread for sandwiches must be baked in rather large square pans, and must be just a little lighter and softer than bread for the table. The following recipes will, I am sure, help the \"out of town\" housewife. Nut bread is usually made into simple bread and butter sandwiches; the nuts in the bread are quite"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29329"],["title","Sandwiches (#1)"],["body","filling.   Yeast    4 good sized potatoes   1 quart of boiling water   2 tablespoonfuls of sugar   1 tablespoonful of salt  Pare and grate the potatoes into the hot water, stir over the fire until it reaches boiling point, and simmer gently for five minutes. Take from the fire, add the sugar and salt, and when lukewarm add a cupful of yeast, or two dry yeast cakes that have been moistened in a little water, or one cake of compressed yeast. Turn the mixture into a jar and cover with a saucer. Stir it down as fast as it comes to the top of the jar. When it falls, or ceases to be very light, which will be five or six hours, pour it into a bottle, put the cork in very loosely and stand it in a cold place. Use one cupful of this to each two loaves of bread.   German Potato Bread  Boil one potato until tender; mash it through a sieve, add to it a half pint of warm water and a teaspoonful of sugar. Stir in one cupful of flour and one cupful of yeast; let this stand for two hours, or until very light. It is better to make this at seven o'clock, so the bread may be sponged at nine or ten. Scald a pint of milk, add to it a pint of water, beat in a quart and a pint of flour. The batter should be thick enough to drop, rather than pour from the spoon. Then stir in the potato starter, and stand in a place about 65° Fahr. over night. Next morning knead thoroughly, adding flour. Put this aside until very light, about two hours, then mold into loaves, put it into square greased pans, and when light bake in a moderately quick oven three-quarters of an hour.  This recipe will make two box loaves and a dozen rolls.   Nineteenth Century Bread  Scald a pint of milk, add a pint of water, a teaspoonful of salt, and when lukewarm, one compressed yeast cake moistened in a little warm water. Add sufficient whole wheat flour to make a batter, beat thoroughly, cover and stand aside two and a half hours; then stir, adding more whole wheat flour until you have a dough. Knead quickly, separate into loaves, put each in a square greased pan, cover and stand in a warm place about one hour, until very light. Slash the top with a sharp knife, brush with water and bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour.   White Bread  Add a pint of water to a pint of scalded milk; when lukewarm add one compressed yeast cake, moistened, and a teaspoonful of salt. Add sufficient flour gradually, beating all the while, to make a dough. Knead this dough until it is soft and elastic, and free from stickiness. Put it into a greased bowl, stand it in a warm place three hours. Separate it into loaves, knead five minutes, put the loaves in square greased pans and stand aside until very light. Slash the top with a sharp knife, brush with water, and bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour. This should make two loaves, or a dozen bread sticks and a dozen rolls.   Nut Bread     1 quart of flour    4 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder    1 teaspoonful of salt    1 cupful of chopped nuts   1½ cupfuls of milk  Add the baking powder and salt to the flour and sift them. Add the nuts, mix thoroughly and gradually add the milk. Knead this into a loaf, put it into a square pan, brush the top with melted butter, let it stand twenty minutes, and bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour.   Anchovy Sandwiches  Beat a quarter of a pound of butter to a cream, adding gradually two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, a saltspoonful of paprika, two tablespoonfuls of anchovy paste. Spread this on thin slices of bread, put two together, trim off the crusts, and cut into triangles.   Anchovy and Egg Sandwiches  Mash the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs with two tablespoonfuls of melted butter or olive oil, add a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of paprika and a tablespoonful of anchovy paste or two mashed anchovies. Spread this between thin slices of buttered bread, press the slices together, trim off the crusts and cut into triangles.  Sardines may be used in the place of anchovies.   Cold Beef Sandwiches  Take the remains of cold roasted beef, and chop very fine; put it into a bowl; to each half pint of meat, add a half teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce and a teaspoonful of melted butter; work this together. Cut the crust from the ends of a loaf of whole wheat bread; butter lightly and slice; so continue until you have the desired number of slices; spread the slices with a layer of the seasoned meat; put two slices together, and cut into desired shapes.   Caviar Sandwiches No. 1  Beat a quarter of a pound of butter to a cream; add two tablespoonfuls of onion juice, the same of lemon, a saltspoonful of paprika, and gradually four tablespoonfuls of caviar. Spread this on thin slices of brown bread or pumpernickel, put two together, press lightly and cut into long, narrow shapes.   Caviar Sandwiches No. 2  Cut slices of bread in crescent-shaped pieces, butter one side and toast. Have ready two hard-boiled eggs, remove yolks, put them through sieve, chop whites very fine, and spread toast with layer of caviar; then sprinkle over first a little of whites, then a little of the yolks of the eggs. Put over in the form of a ring a piece of onion, the onion having first been cut into thin slices, and then separated.   Celery Sandwiches  Cut slices of bread, butter one side and toast. Cut the white part of celery into thin slices, cover it over the bread, then cover this with a layer of mayonnaise dressing, cover with another piece of toast, cut into squares and serve. All sandwiches of this kind must be used as soon as made.   Celery Salad Sandwiches  Put four eggs into warm water; bring to the boiling point, and keep there, without boiling, for fifteen minutes. Take the white portion from one head of celery; wash and chop it very fine. Remove the shells from the hard-boiled eggs, and either chop them very fine or put through a vegetable press, and mix with them the celery; add a half teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper. Butter the bread before you cut it from the loaf. After you have a sufficient quantity cut, put over each slice a layer of the mixed egg and celery; put right in the center of this a teaspoonful of mayonnaise dressing, and sort of smooth it all over. Put two pieces together and press them lightly. Trim off the crusts, and cut the sandwiches into pieces about two inches wide and the length of the slices.   Rolled Bread and Butter Sandwiches  Beat the butter to a cream. Remove the crusts from the loaf, butter each slice before you cut it off, and roll at once. These may be tied with narrow baby ribbon or wrapped at once in waxed paper, fringing and twisting the ends.   Rolled Chicken Sandwiches  Trim the crusts from the entire loaf, butter each slice and cut it off as thin as possible; spread it quickly with the mixture, roll and wrap it at once in waxed paper. If the bread is home-made and cracks in the rolling, put a colander over a kettle of boiling water, throw in it a few slices at a time, as soon as they have softened spread them with soft butter, then cover with the mixture, roll and wrap in waxed paper.  To make the mixture, chop sufficient cold boiled chicken to make a pint. Rub together two level tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour, add slowly a half cupful of hot milk, stir over the fire for a minute, then add the chicken, a level teaspoonful of salt, a half teaspoonful of celery seed, a saltspoonful of white pepper, a dash of red pepper, a teaspoonful of onion juice and a grating of nutmeg; mix and cool. This will make four dozen rolled sandwiches.   Sandwiches à la Rorer  Chop sufficient white meat of cooked chicken to make a half pint. Select two fine bunches of cress, and with a sharp knife shave it very fine. Wash and dry the crisp portion from a head of lettuce. Put the yolks of two eggs into a saucepan, add the juice from two lemons and stir over hot water until the mixture is thick; take from the fire and add slowly two tablespoonfuls of olive oil; add this to the chicken and season with a half teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper. Butter a slice of white bread, put over a rather thick layer of the chicken mixture, then a slice of brown bread, buttered on both sides; cover this with a thick layer of cress, dust it lightly with salt and pepper, then another slice of white bread, buttered; press these firmly together, trim the crusts and cut into fingers.   Chicken and Almond Sandwiches  Chop sufficient cold cooked chicken to make a half pint. Chop a quarter of a pound of blanched almonds, add them to the chicken, add four tablespoonfuls of cream, a half teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper; mix thoroughly, put between thin slices of buttered bread and cut into crescents or rounds.   Chicken and Lettuce à la Kendall  Put sufficient cold boiled chicken through the meat chopper to make a half pint, pound it in a mortar or rub it in a bowl with the hard-boiled yolks of four eggs, four tablespoonfuls of thick cream, a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper, and if you have it, two saltspoonfuls of celery seed; in the winter you may add a half cupful of finely chopped celery. Butter thin slices of white bread, cover them with this mixture, place on top a slice of brown bread buttered on both sides, then a thick layer of shredded celery, with a tablespoonful of mayonnaise in the middle, then another slice of buttered white bread; press together, trim the crusts and cut into fingers.   Princess Sandwiches  Chop sufficient cold chicken to make a half pint, add the juice of half a lemon, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter or olive oil, twelve walnuts chopped very fine, a half teaspoonful of paprika and a half teaspoonful of salt. Put this mixture between thin slices of buttered bread, trim the crusts and cut into fingers.   Windsor Sandwiches  Chop sufficient cold boiled chicken to make a half pint, add a half cupful of finely chopped celery, a half teaspoonful of salt, "]]]
