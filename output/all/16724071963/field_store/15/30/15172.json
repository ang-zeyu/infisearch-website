We shall know it now.”  And so she went on talking about it and growing more and more troubled about it, until one could see that it was filling all her mind.  At last we came upon a dreadful object. It was the madman—hacked and stabbed to death in his iron cage in the corner of the square. It was a bloody and dreadful sight. Hardly any of us young people had ever seen a man before who had lost his life by violence; so this cadaver had an awful fascination for us; we could not take our eyes from it. I mean, it had that sort of fascination for all of us but one. That one was Joan. She turned away in horror, and could not be persuaded to go near it again. There—it is a striking reminder that we are but creatures of use and custom; yes, and it is a reminder, too, of how harshly and unfairly fate deals with us sometimes. For it was so ordered that the very ones among us who were most fascinated with mutilated and bloody death were to live their lives in peace, while that other, who had a native and deep horror of it, must presently go forth and have it as a familiar spectacle every day on the field of battle.  You may well believe that we had plenty of matter for talk now, since the raiding of our village seemed by long odds the greatest event that had really ever occurred in the world; for although these dull peasants may have thought they recognized the bigness of some of the previous occurrences that had filtered from the world's history dimly into their minds, the truth is that they hadn't. One biting little fact, visible to their eyes of flesh and felt in their own personal vitals, became at once more prodigious to them than the grandest remote episode in the world's history which they had got at second hand and by hearsay. It amuses me now when I recall how our elders talked then. They fumed and fretted in a fine fashion.  “Ah, yes,” said old Jacques d'Arc, “things are come to a pretty pass, indeed! The King must be informed of this. It is time that he cease from idleness and dreaming, and get at his proper business.” He meant our young disinherited King, the hunted refugee, Charles VII.  “You say well,” said the maire. “He should be informed, and that at once. It is an outrage that such things would be permitted. Why, we are not safe in our beds, and he taking his ease yonder. It shall be made known, indeed it shall—all France shall hear of it!”  To hear them talk, one would have imagined that all the previous ten thousand sackings and burnings in France had been but fables, and this one the only fact. It is always the way; words will answer as long as it is only a person's neighbor who is in trouble, but when that person gets into trouble himself, it is time that the King rise up and do something.  The big event filled us young people with talk, too. We let it flow in a steady stream while we tended the flocks. We were beginning to feel pretty important now, for I was eighteen and the other youths were from one to four years older—young men, in fact. One day the Paladin was arrogantly criticizing the patriot generals of France and said:  “Look at Dunois, Bastard of Orleans—call him a general! Just put me in his place once—never mind what I would do, it is not for me to say, I have no stomach for talk, my way is to act and let others do the talking—but just put me in his place once, that's all! And look at Saintrailles—pooh! and that blustering La Hire, now what a general that is!”  It shocked everybody to hear these great names so flippantly handled, for to us these renowned soldiers were almost gods. In their far-off splendor they rose upon our imaginations dim and huge, shadowy and awful, and it was a fearful thing to hear them spoken of as if they were mere men, and their acts open to comment and criticism. The color rose in Joan's face, and she said:  “I know not how any can be so hardy as to use such words regarding these sublime men, who are the very pillars of the French state, supporting it with their strength and preserving it at daily cost of their blood. As for me, I could count myself honored past all deserving if I might be allowed but the privilege of looking upon them once—at a distance, I mean, for it would not become one of my degree to approach them too near.”  The Paladin was disconcerted for a moment, seeing by the faces around him that Joan had put into words what the others felt, then he pulled his complacency together and fell to fault-finding again. Joan's brother Jean said:  “If you don't like what our generals do, why don't you go to the great wars yourself and better their work? You are always talking about going to the wars, but you don't go.”  “Look you,” said the Paladin, “it is easy to say that. Now I will tell you why I remain chafing here in a bloodless tranquillity which my reputation teaches you is repulsive to my nature. I do not go because I am not a gentleman. That is the whole reason. What can one private soldier do in a contest like this? Nothing. He is not permitted to rise from the ranks. If I were a gentleman would I remain here? Not one moment. I can save France—ah, you may laugh, but I know what is in me, I know what is hid under this peasant cap. I can save France, and I stand ready to do it, but not under these present conditions. If they want me, let them send for me; otherwise, let them take the consequences; I shall not budge but as an officer.”  “Alas, poor France—France is lost!” said Pierre d'Arc.  “Since you sniff so at others, why don't you go to the wars yourself, Pierre d'Arc?”  “Oh, I haven't been sent for, either. I am no more a gentleman than you. Yet I will go; I promise to go. I promise to go as a private under your orders—when you are sent for.”  They all laughed, and the Dragon-fly said:  “So soon? Then you need to begin to get ready; you might be called for in five years—who knows? Yes, in my opinion you'll march for the wars in five years.”  “He will go sooner,” said Joan. She said it in a low voice and musingly, but several heard it.  “How do you know that, Joan?” said the Dragon-fly, with a surprised look. But Jean d'Arc broke in and said:  “I want to go myself, but as I am rather young yet, I also will wait, and march when the Paladin is sent for.”  “No,” said Joan, “he will go with Pierre.”  She said it as one who talks to himself aloud without knowing it, and none heard it but me. I glanced at her and saw that her knitting-needles were idle in her hands, and that her face had a dreamy and absent look in it. There were fleeting movements of her lips as if she might be occasionally saying parts of sentences to herself. But there was no sound, for I was the nearest person to her and I heard nothing. But I set my ears open, for those two speeches had affected me uncannily, I being superstitious and easily troubled by any little thing of a strange and unusual sort.  Noel Rainguesson said:  “There is one way to let France have a chance for her salvation. We've got one gentleman in the commune, at any rate. Why can't the Scholar change name and condition with the Paladin? Then he can be an officer. France will send for him then, and he will sweep these English and Burgundian armies into the sea like flies.”  I was the Scholar. That was my nickname, because I could read and write. There was a chorus of approval, and the Sunflower said:  “That is the very thing—it settles every difficulty. The Sieur de Conte will easily agree to that. Yes, he will march at the back of Captain Paladin and die early, covered with common-soldier glory.”  “He will march with Jean and Pierre, and live till these wars are forgotten,” Joan muttered; “and at the eleventh hour Noel and the Paladin will join these, but not of their own desire.” The voice was so low that I was not perfectly sure that these were the words, but they seemed to be. It makes one feel creepy to hear such things.  “Come, now,” Noel continued, “it's all arranged; there's nothing to do but organize under the Paladin's banner and go forth and rescue France. You'll all join?”  All said yes, except Jacques d'Arc, who said:  “I'll ask you to excuse me. It is pleasant to talk war, and I am with you there, and I've always thought I should go soldiering about this time, but the look of our wrecked village and that carved-up and bloody madman have taught me that I am not made for such work and such sights. I could never be at home in that trade. Face swords and the big guns and death? It isn't in me. No, no; count me out. And besides, I'm the eldest son, and deputy prop and protector of the family. Since you are going to carry Jean and Pierre to the wars, somebody must be left behind to take care of our Joan and her sister. I shall stay at home, and grow old in peace and tranquillity.”  “He will stay at home, but not grow old,” murmured Joan.  The talk rattled on in the gay and careless fashion privileged to youth, and we got the Paladin to map out his campaigns and fight his battles and win his victories and extinguish the English and put our King upon his throne and set his crown upon his head. Then we asked him what he was going to answer when the King should require him to name his reward. The Paladin had it all arranged in his head, and brought it out promptly:  “He shall give me a dukedom, name me premier peer, and make me Hereditary Lord High Constable of France.”  “And marry you to a princess—you're not going to leave that out, are you?”  The Paladin colored a trifle, and said, brusquely:  “He may keep his princesses—I can marry more to my taste.”  Meaning Joan, though nobody suspected it at that time. If any had, the Paladin would have been finely ridiculed for his vanity. There was no fit mate in that village for Joan of Arc. Every one would have said that.  In turn, each person present was required to say what reward he would demand of the King if he could change places with the Paladin and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2875"],["title","Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc — Volume 2 (#0)"],["body","by David Reed; HTML file by David Widger         PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF  JOAN OF ARC   VOLUME 2 (of 2)  by Mark Twain    PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF JOAN OF ARC   by The Sieur Louis De Conte   (her page and secretary)  In Two Volumes Freely translated out of the ancient French into modern English from the original unpublished manuscript in the National Archives of France    Contents   PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF JOAN OF ARC   BOOK II -- IN COURT AND CAMP (Continued)  28 Joan Foretells Her Doom  29 Fierce Talbot Reconsiders  30 The Red Field of Patay  31 France Begins to Live Again  32 The Joyous News Flies Fast  33 Joan's Five Great Deeds  34 The Jests of the Burgundians  35 The Heir of France is Crowned  36 Joan Hears News from Home  37 Again to Arms  38 The King Cries “Forward!”  39 We Win, But the King Balks  40 Treachery Conquers Joan  41 The Maid Will March No More   BOOK III TRIAL AND MARTYRDOM  1 The Maid in Chains  2 Joan Sold to the English  3 Weaving the Net About Her  4 All Ready to Condemn  5 Fifty Experts Against a Novice  6 The Maid Baffles Her Persecutors  7 Craft That Was in Vain  8 Joan Tells of Her Visions  9 Her Sure Deliverance Foretold  10 The Inquisitors at Their Wits' End  11 The Court Reorganized for Assassination  12 Joan's Master-Stroke Diverted  13 The Third Trial Fails  14 Joan Struggles with Her Twelve Lies  15 Undaunted by Threat of Burning  16 Joan Stands Defiant Before the Rack  17 Supreme in Direst Peril  18 Condemned Yet Unafraid  19 Our Last Hopes of Rescue Fail  20 The Betrayal  21 Respited Only for Torture  22 Joan Gives the Fatal Answer  23 The Time Is at Hand  24 Joan the Martyr   CONCLUSION      BOOK II -- IN COURT AND CAMP (Continued)    28 Joan Foretells Her Doom  THE TROOPS must have a rest. Two days would be allowed for this. The morning of the 14th I was writing from Joan's dictation in a small room which she sometimes used as a private office when she wanted to get away from officials and their interruptions. Catherine Boucher came in and sat down and said:  “Joan, dear, I want you to talk to me.”  “Indeed, I am not sorry for that, but glad. What is in your mind?”  “This. I scarcely slept last night, for thinking of the dangers you are running. The Paladin told me how you made the duke stand out of the way when the cannon-balls were flying all about, and so saved his life.”  “Well, that was right, wasn't it?”  “Right? Yes; but you stayed there yourself. Why will you do like that? It seems such a wanton risk.”  “Oh, no, it was not so. I was not in any danger.”  “How can you say that, Joan, with those deadly things flying all about you?”  Joan laughed, and tried to turn the subject, but Catherine persisted. She said:  “It was horribly dangerous, and it could not be necessary to stay in such a place. And you led an assault again. Joan, it is tempting Providence. I want you to make me a promise. I want you to promise me that you will let others lead the assaults, if there must be assaults, and that you will take better care of yourself in those dreadful battles. Will you?”  But Joan fought away from the promise and did not give it. Catherine sat troubled and discontented awhile, then she said:  “Joan, are you going to be a soldier always? These wars are so long--so long. They last forever and ever and ever.”  There was a glad flash in Joan's eye as she cried:  “This campaign will do all the really hard work that is in front of it in the next four days. The rest of it will be gentler--oh, far less bloody. Yes, in four days France will gather another trophy like the redemption of Orleans and make her second long step toward freedom!”  Catherine started (and so did I); then she gazed long at Joan like one in a trance, murmuring “four days--four days,” as if to herself and unconsciously. Finally she asked, in a low voice that had something of awe in it:  “Joan, tell me--how is it that you know that? For you do know it, I think.”  “Yes,” said Joan, dreamily, “I know--I know. I shall strike--and strike again. And before the fourth day is finished I shall strike yet again.”  She became silent. We sat wondering and still. This was for a whole minute, she looking at the floor and her lips moving but uttering nothing. Then came these words, but hardly audible: “And in a thousand years the English power in France will not rise up from that blow.”  It made my flesh creep. It was uncanny. She was in a trance again--I could see it--just as she was that day in the pastures of Domremy when she prophesied about us boys in the war and afterward did not know that she had done it. She was not conscious now; but Catherine did not know that, and so she said, in a happy voice:  “Oh, I believe it, I believe it, and I am so glad! Then you will come back and bide with us all your life long, and we will love you so, and honor you!”  A scarcely perceptible spasm flitted across Joan's face, and the dreamy voice muttered:  “Before two years are sped I shall die a cruel death!”  I sprang forward with a warning hand up. That is why Catherine did not scream. She was going to do that--I saw it plainly. Then I whispered her to slip out of the place, and say nothing of what had happened. I said Joan was asleep--asleep and dreaming. Catherine whispered back, and said:  “Oh, I am so grateful that it is only a dream! It sounded like prophecy.” And she was gone.  Like prophecy! I knew it was prophecy; and I sat down crying, as knowing we should lose her. Soon she started, shivering slightly, and came to herself, and looked around and saw me crying there, and jumped out of her chair and ran to me all in a whirl of sympathy and compassion, and put her hand on my head, and said:  “My poor boy! What is it? Look up and tell me.”  I had to tell her a lie; I grieved to do it, but there was no other way. I picked up an old letter from my table, written by Heaven knows who, about some matter Heaven knows what, and told her I had just gotten it from Pere Fronte, and that in it it said the children's Fairy Tree had been chopped down by some miscreant or other, and-- I got no further. She snatched the letter from my hand and searched it up and down and all over, turning it this way and that, and sobbing great sobs, and the tears flowing down her cheeks, and ejaculating all the time, “Oh, cruel, cruel! how could any be so heartless? Ah, poor Arbre Fee de Bourlemont gone--and we children loved it so! Show me the place where it says it!”  And I, still lying, showed her the pretended fatal words on the pretended fatal page, and she gazed at them through her tears, and said she could see herself that they were hateful, ugly words--they “had the very look of it.”  Then we heard a strong voice down the corridor announcing:  “His majesty's messenger--with despatches for her Excellency the Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of France!”      29 Fierce Talbot Reconsiders  I KNEW she had seen the wisdom of the Tree. But when? I could not know. Doubtless before she had lately told the King to use her, for that she had but one year left to work in. It had not occurred to me at the time, but the conviction came upon me now that at that time she had already seen the Tree. It had brought her a welcome message; that was plain, otherwise she could not have been so joyous and light-hearted as she had been these latter days. The death-warning had nothing dismal about it for her; no, it was remission of exile, it was leave to come home.  Yes, she had seen the Tree. No one had taken the prophecy to heart which she made to the King; and for a good reason, no doubt; no one wanted to take it to heart; all wanted to banish it away and forget it. And all had succeeded, and would go on to the end placid and comfortable. All but me alone. I must carry my awful secret without any to help me. A heavy load, a bitter burden; and would cost me a daily heartbreak. She was to die; and so soon. I had never dreamed of that. How could I, and she so strong and fresh and young, and every day earning a new right to a peaceful and honored old age? For at that time I thought old age valuable. I do not know why, but I thought so. All young people think it, I believe, they being ignorant and full of superstitions. She had seen the Tree. All that miserable night those ancient verses went floating back and forth through my brain:        And when, in exile wand'ring, we      Shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee,      Oh, rise upon our sight!  But at dawn the bugles and the drums burst through the dreamy hush of the morning, and it was turn out all! mount and ride. For there was red work to be done.  We marched to Meung without halting. There we carried the bridge by assault, and left a force to hold it, the rest of the army marching away next morning toward Beaugency, where the lion Talbot, the terror of the French, was in command. When we arrived at that place, the English retired into the castle and we sat down in the abandoned town.  Talbot was not at the moment present in person, for he had gone away to watch for and welcome Fastolfe and his reinforcement of five thousand men.  Joan placed her batteries and bombarded the castle till night. Then some news came: Richemont, Constable of France, this long time in disgrace with the King, largely because of the evil machinations of La Tremouille and his party, was approaching with a large body of men to offer his services to Joan--and very much she needed them, now that Fastolfe was so close by. Richemont had wanted to join us before, when we first marched on Orleans; but the foolish King, slave of those paltry advisers of his, warned him to keep his distance and refused all reconciliation with him.  I go into these details because they are important. Important because they lead up to the exhibition of a new gift in Joan's extraordinary mental make-up--statesmanship. It is a sufficiently strange thing to find that great quality in an ignorant country-girl of seventeen and a half, but she had it.  Joan was for "]]]
