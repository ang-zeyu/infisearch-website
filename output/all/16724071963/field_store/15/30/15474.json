Within that time, one of the strangest phenomena which I think I may say any nation has ever manifested arose to its height and fell--I mean that strange and altogether marvellous phenomenon, English Puritanism. Within that time, England had to show statesmen like Burleigh, Strafford, and Cromwell--I mean men who were real statesmen, and not intriguers, seeking to make a reputation at the expense of the nation. In the course of that time, the nation had begun to throw off those swarms of hardy colonists which, to the benefit of the world--and as I fancy, in the long run, to the benefit of England herself--have now become the United States of America; and, during the same epoch, the first foundations were laid of that Indian Empire which, it may be, future generations will not look upon as so happy a product of English enterprise and ingenuity. In that time we had poets such as Spenser, Shakespere, and Milton; we had a great philosopher, in Hobbes; and we had a clever talker about philosophy, in Bacon. In the beginning of the period, Harvey revolutionized the biological sciences, and at the end of it, Newton was preparing the revolution of the physical sciences. I know not any period of our history--I doubt if there be any period of the history of any nation--which has precisely such a record as this to show for a hundred years. But I do not recall these facts to your recollection for a mere vainglorious purpose. I myself am of opinion that the memory of the great men of a nation is one of its most precious possessions--not because we have any right to plume ourselves upon their having existed as a matter of national vanity, but because we have a just and rational ground of expectation that the race which has brought forth such products as these may, in good time and under fortunate circumstances, produce the like again. I am one of those people who do not believe in the natural decay of nations. I believe, to speak frankly, though perhaps not quite so politely as I could wish--but I am getting near the end of my lecture--that the whole theory is a speculation invented by cowards to excuse knaves. My belief is, that so far as this old English stock is concerned it has in it as much sap and vitality and power as it had two centuries ago; and that, with due pruning of rotten branches, and due hoeing up of weeds, which will grow about the roots, the like products will be yielded again. The \"weeds\" to which I refer are mainly three: the first of them is dishonesty, the second is sentimentality, and the third is luxury. If William Harvey had been a dishonest man--I mean in the high sense of the word--a man who failed in the ideal of honesty--he would have believed what it was easiest to believe--that which he received on the authority of his predecessors. He would not have felt that his highest duty was to know of his own knowledge that that which he said he believed was true, and we should never have had those investigations, pursued through good report and evil report, which ended in discoveries so fraught with magnificent results for science and for man. If Harvey had been a sentimentalist--by which I mean a person of false pity, a person who has not imagination enough to see that great, distant evils may be much worse than those which we can picture to ourselves, because they happen to be immediate and near (for that, I take it, is the essence of sentimentalism)--if Harvey had been a person of that kind, he, being one of the kindest men living, would never have pursued those researches which, as he tells us over and over again, he was obliged to pursue in order to the ascertainment of those facts which have turned out to be of such inestimable value to the human race; and I say, if on such grounds he had failed to do so, he would have failed in his duty to the human race. The third point is that Harvey was devoid of care either for wealth, or for riches, or for ambition. The man found a higher ideal than any of these things in the pursuit of truth and the benefit of his fellow-men. If we all go and do likewise, I think there is no fear for the decadence of England. I think that our children and our successors will find themselves in a commonwealth, different it may be from that for which Eliott, and Pym, and Hampden struggled, but one which will be identical in the substance of its aims--great, worthy, and well to live in.

Knight_  [Illustration: \"_I was dead._\"]    As Jerry's eyes fell on the creature's head, he shuddered--for the   face was nothing but bone, with dull-brown skin stretched taut over   it. A skeleton that was alive!   It was a wicked night, the night I met the man who had died. A bitter, heart-numbing night of weird, shrieking wind and flying snow. A few black hours I will never forget.  \"Well, Jerry, lad!\" my mother said to me as I pushed back from the table and started for my sheepskin coat and the lantern in the corner of the room. \"Surely you're not going out a night like this? Goodness gracious, Jerry, it's not fit!\"  \"Can't help it, Mother,\" I replied. \"Got to go. You've never seen me miss a Saturday night yet, have you now?\"  \"No. But then I've never seen a night like this for years either. Jerry, I'm really afraid. You may freeze before you even get as far as--\"  \"Ah, come now, Mother,\" I argued. \"They'd guy me to death if I didn't sit in with the gang to-night. They'd chaff me because it was too cold for me to get out. But I'm no pampered sissy, you know, and I want to see--\"  \"Yes,\" she retorted bitingly, \"I know. You want to go and bask in that elegant company. Our stove's just as good as the one down at that dirty old store,\" continued my persistent and anxious parent, \"and it's certainly not very flattering to think that you leave us on a night like this to--Who'll be there, anyway?\"  \"Oh, the usual five or six I suppose,\" I answered as I adjusted the wick of my lantern, hearing as I did the snarl and cut of the wind through the evergreens in the yard.  \"That black-whiskered sphinx, Hammersly, will he be there?\"  \"Yes, he'll be there, I'm pretty sure.\"  \"Hm-m!\" she exclaimed, her expression now carrying all the contempt for my judgment and taste she intended it should. \"Button your coat up good around your neck, then, if you must go to see your precious Hammersly and the rest of them. Have you ever heard that man say anything yet? Does he speak at all, Jerry?\" Then her gentle mind, not at all accustomed to hard thoughts or contemptuous remarks, quickly changed. \"Funny thing about that fellow,\" she mused. \"He's got something on his mind. Don't you think so, Jerry?\"  \"Y-es, yes I do. And I've often wondered what it could be. He certainly's a queer stick. Got to admit that. Always brooding. Good fellow all right, and, for a 'sphinx' as you call him, likable. But I wonder what is eating him?\"  \"What do you suppose it could be, Jerry boy?\" questioned Mother following me to the door, the woman of her now completely forgetting her recent criticisms and, perhaps, the rough night her son was about to step into. \"Do you suppose the poor chap has a--a--broken heart, or something like that? A girl somewhere who jilted him? Or maybe he loves someone he has no right to!\" she finished excitedly, the plates in her hand rattling.  \"Maybe it's worse than that,\" I ventured. \"P'r'aps--I've no right to say it--but p'r'aps, and I've often thought it, there's a killing he wants to forget, and can't!\"         *       *       *       *       *  I heard my mother's sharp little \"Oh!\" as I shut the door behind me and the warmth and comfort of the room away. Outside it was worse than the whistle of the wind through the trees had led me to expect. Black as pitch it was, and as cold as blazes. For the first moment or two, though, I liked the feel of the challenge of the night and the racing elements, was even a little glad I had added to the dare of the blackness the thought of Hammersly and his \"killing.\" But I had not gone far before I was wishing I did not have to save my face by putting in an appearance at the store that night.  Every Saturday night, with the cows comfortable in their warm barn, and my own supper over, I was in the habit of taking my place on the keg or box behind the red-hot stove in Pruett's store. To-night all the snow was being hurled clear of the fields to block the roads full between the old, zigzag fences. The wind met me in great pushing gusts, and while it flung itself at me I would hang against it, snow to my knees, until the blow had gone along, when I could plunge forward again. I was glad when I saw the lights of the store, glad when I was inside.  They met me with mock applause for my pluck in facing the night, but for all their sham flattery I was pleased I had come, proud, I must admit, that I had been able to plough my heavy way through the drifts to reach them. I saw at a glance that my friends were all there, and I saw too that there was a strange man present.         *       *       *       *       *  A very tall man he was, gaunt and awkward as he leaned into the angle of the two counters, his back to a dusty show-case. He attracted my attention at once. Not merely because he appeared so long and pointed and skinny, but because, of all ridiculous things in that frozen country, he wore a hard derby hat! If he had not been such a queer character it would have been laughable, but as it was it was--creepy. For the man beneath that hard hat was about as queer a looking character as I have ever seen. I supposed he was a visitor at the store, or a friend of one of my friends, and that in a little while I would be introduced. But I was not.  I took my place in behind the stove, feeling at once, though I am far from being unsociable usually, that the man was an intruder and would spoil the evening. But despite his cold, dampening presence we were soon at it, hammer and tongs, discussing the things that are discussed behind hospitable stoves in country stores on bad nights. But I could never lose sight of the fact that the stranger standing there, silent as the grave, was, to say the least, a queer one. Before long I was sure he was no friend or guest of anyone there, and that he not only cast a pall over me but over all of us. I did not like it, nor did I like him. Perhaps it would have been just as well after all, I thought, had I heeded my mother and stayed home.  Jed Counsell was the one who, innocently enough, started the thing that changed the evening, that had begun so badly, into a nightmare.  \"Jerry,\" he said, leaning across to me, \"thinkin' of you s'afternoon. Readin' an article about reincarnation. Remember we were arguin' it last week? Well, this guy, whoever he was I've forgot, believes in it. Says it's so. That people _do_ come back.\" With this opening shot Jed sat back to await my answer. I liked these arguments and I liked to bear my share in them, but now, instead of immediately answering the challenge, I looked around to see if any other of our circle were going to answer Jed. Then, deciding it was up to me, I shrugged off the strange feeling the man in the corner had cast over me, and prepared to view my opinions.  \"That's just that"]]]
