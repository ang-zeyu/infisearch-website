Daoud turned to Celino and laughed with delighted surprise.  \"You write excellent Arabic. I would never have guessed that you were not one of us.\"  Lorenzo accepted Daoud's compliment with a small bow.  \"One of _us_?\" said Manfred. \"And what are you, then, Messere? I see before me a strapping man, blond enough to be one of my Swabian knights, yet who claims to come from the Sultan of Cairo. You are no Arab or Turk.\"  \"Indeed not, Sire,\" said Daoud. \"I am a Mameluke.\"  \"A blond Mameluke.\" Manfred nodded. \"Where are you from, then, Russia or Circassia?\"  Without emotion Daoud told the king of his descent from crusaders and his capture by the Muslims.  \"What a strange world this is,\" said Manfred. \"And when did this happen to you?\"  \"Twenty years ago, Sire. For most of those years I have served my lord Baibars al-Bunduqdari, who is now Sultan of Cairo.\"  \"And you are a Muslim?\"  \"Of course, Sire.\"  Manfred stood up and came close to him. \"Of course? You say that so firmly. Do you not remember the Christian teachings of your childhood?\"  The question made Daoud angry. _My soul is undivided. King or not, how dare this infidel question that!_  \"God willed that I find the truth, Sire,\" he said simply.  Manfred shrugged. \"It is all the same to me. I have lived among Muslims all my life.\"  \"May I know, Sire, why your secretary, to whom my master sent me in good faith, tried to kill me?\" Daoud asked.  Manfred turned his back on Daoud and strolled a short distance down the pebble path. \"Lorenzo is neither my secretary nor does he normally command my gate guards. He performs for me _unusual_ tasks that require a man of uncommon courage, loyalty, and wit. Such as testing you--first, by taking you prisoner, then by giving you pork and wine and speaking to you in Arabic, finally by trying to kill you.\"  \"But I might have killed him.\"  \"I did not realize how much of a risk I was taking,\" said Lorenzo.  \"We did not think Baibars could find anywhere in his empire a man who could go to the papal court undetected. We hoped to show him his error and send you back. But you are quite a remarkable man, David.\"  _Show Baibars his error!_ Manfred might be a brilliant man, but he evidently underestimated Baibars. Daoud sensed himself feeling a bit superior and warned himself not to make the same mistake and underestimate Manfred.  \"Perhaps now that you have tested my ability, Sire, you might be more inclined to help me.\"  \"Help you to do what?\" There was a note of irritation in Manfred's voice. \"Your Sultan Baibars has asked me only to help you carry out a mission in the Papal States. What is your mission?\"  Daoud said, \"Sire, my master chose not to entrust his plan to writing, but sent me to tell it to you instead. I am here for one purpose, to prevent the forming of an alliance between Christians and Tartars.\"  Manfred looked surprised, and stared intently at Daoud. \"Tartars? Those barbarians who invaded Europe--how long ago, Lorenzo?\"  Lorenzo frowned. \"Over twenty years, Sire.\"  Daoud said, \"Fifty years ago they were nothing. A scattering of herdsmen, like the Bedouin. Now they are the most powerful people on earth.\"  Manfred nodded. \"Yes, I remember now. When they rode into Poland and Hungary I was just a boy. Everyone was in terror of them. Their emperor sent letters to all the monarchs of Europe demanding that they surrender. He contemptuously offered them positions in his court.\" He grinned at Daoud. \"My father showed me the letter he was sending back. If Tartar emperor succeeded in conquering Europe, my father said, he would be well qualified to serve as his falconer.\"  Daoud inclined his head. \"Your family's love of falconry is well known to your admirers in the lands of Islam. My lord the sultan considers you an old friend and hopes that you will see fit to help him in his time of need.\"  Manfred held out his hands, palms up. \"If I can.\"  \"Now the Tartars have fallen upon the lands of Islam,\" Daoud said. \"They have conquered Persia. They have a hundred thousand mounted warriors in the field, and allies and auxiliaries. They have leveled our holy city of Baghdad, destroyed it utterly, and killed every man, woman, and child who lived there, even the Commander of the Faithful, our caliph himself. These are no fanciful tales, Sire. I have fought against the Tartars. I have seen with my own eyes the ashes of Baghdad and the heaps of its dead.\"  The scene of desolation arose in his mind as it had so many times before, the gray plain where a city had been, the unbelievable sight of a landscape strewn with rotting, headless corpses as far as the eye could see. To put it out of his mind, he hurried on with what he had to say.  \"Now their armies advance through Syria, threatening the realm of my lord, the Sultan of Cairo. We have had word that Hulagu Khan, commander of the Tartar armies in Persia, has sent two high-ranking emissaries to the pope. They are sailing across the Middle Sea now, from the island of Cyprus to Venice. Hulagu Khan wants to form an alliance with the Christian rulers of Europe to attack us from both directions at once, east and west. Our whole people, our whole Muslim faith, could be utterly wiped out.\"  Manfred nodded grimly. \"And all of Christian Europe would rejoice at your destruction. Not I, certainly, but the rest of them. What do you propose to do about these Tartar emissaries to the pope?\"  \"For that I will need your help, Sire. I, too, will go to the pope's court. I understand that he resides at Orvieto, a small town north of Rome.\"  \"Yes,\" Lorenzo put in, \"and there he will stay. He has not set foot in Rome since he galloped in to be crowned at Saint Peter's and galloped out again. He is terrified of the Roman mob. As well he should be, since most of their leaders are in our pay.\"  \"Trade secrets, Celino,\" said Manfred, raising a cautioning finger. \"So, you will go to Orvieto. And then?\"  \"I will present myself at the pope's court as I have here, as David, a merchant of Trebizond. I will take up residence with--friends--who can help me reach the ears of men of influence. I will spread stories throughout Orvieto--true stories--of the horrors the Tartars have perpetrated everywhere they have gone, of their determination to conquer the entire world.\"  Manfred shook his head. \"What you plan to do is very dangerous. You've proven to us that you are a skilled and resourceful man, but still, what if you are discovered?\" He shook his head. \"Have you any idea of how your people are _hated_ in Europe, David? If it were known that I helped a Muslim spy to steal into the court of the pope, all the kingdoms of Christendom would turn against me. The pope need but snap his fingers and I and my little realm would be swept away. No, David. You ask me to risk too much.\"  Daoud was momentarily surprised, then angry. He had expected that Manfred would cooperate with him. If the young king vacillated, Daoud might have journeyed from Egypt to Italy for nothing.  And then a ripple of fear crept up his spine. If he failed to persuade Manfred, the Tartars might destroy the world he had come to love and believe in.  _God, help me to stop them. I must not go back to El Kahira a failure._  He must choose his words with care. He was dealing here with a king, and one did not argue with kings. Better to ask questions than offer arguments.  \"Does not the pope wish even now to take your throne from you, Sire?\" he said. \"How can matters between you and him be any worse?\"  Manfred nodded. \"True, Pope Urban keeps offering my crown to this prince and that, claiming that I had no right to inherit it from my father. And that he had no right to have it in the first place.\" Manfred bit his lip, and the light pink of his cheeks reddened. \"But only the French are powerful enough to take it from me. And King Louis of France is kindly disposed to me and will not permit any of his great barons to make war on me. I rely on Louis's continued goodwill.\"  \"But the man who wants to join with the Tartars to annihilate Islam is that same King Louis of France,\" Daoud said. \"France, as you said, is the only kingdom with the power to help the pope dethrone you. Should the pope decide against allying with the Tartars, King Louis will continue to prohibit his subjects from joining the pope's war against you. Help me, and you come between King Louis and the pope.\"  \"Intrigue requires gold,\" said Manfred. \"Does your master expect me to pay for your activities?\"  \"What I have brought with me will pay for all,\" Daoud replied. He unbuckled his belt and undid the laces that held his hose tight around his waist. Celino moved closer, tense, ready in case Daoud should reach for a weapon. Daoud slipped his fingers into the breeches he wore under his hose and found the bag tied to the drawstring.  \"What is the man doing?\" said Manfred with a wondering smile. Celino shook his head.  Daoud pulled out a bag of heavy red silk, full and round with what it held. He felt a childlike delight in mystifying the two men.  \"Pay me from your royal treasury what this is worth,\" said Daoud, \"and I shall have gold enough for all I need to do.\" He pulled apart the mouth of the silk bag and drew out of it a globe of green fire. He held it out to Manfred. Celino gasped.  Daoud was gratified at their wonderment.  \"Are you not afraid I will steal this from you and dump you in an unmarked grave?\" said Manfred with a bright grin.  \"The Hohenstaufen family have been friends of the sultans of Egypt since your father's day,\" said Daoud. \"We have learned to trust you.\"  \"Just listen to that, Lorenzo,\" said Manfred. \"The Saracens think better of me than the pope does.\"  Besides, Daoud thought, Manfred knew that Baibars's arm was long. Manfred, Daoud was sure, knew that Baibars would not permit anyone, even a distant head of state, to betray him so flagrantly."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28515"],["title","The Saracen: Land of the Infidel (#6)"],["body","eyes wide, Manfred extended his palm, and Daoud unhesitatingly placed the emerald in it. Manfred raised it close to his face, peering through the dark depths into its glowing heart. The jewel, irregular in shape but nearly spherical, reflected little spots of pale green light on his cheeks. He shook his head.  \"Green, the color I love best in all the world. The color of hope.\" He encircled it with thumb and forefinger. \"Look, Lorenzo, I cannot get my fingers around it. I am amazed that your master is willing to part with such a wonder. How did he come by it?\"  \"It has been through many hands, Sire,\" said Daoud. \"It once belonged to Emir Fakr ad-Din, who commanded the army of Egypt when King Louis invaded our land.\"  \"To think Baibars let you take this emerald from him, and you came all this way from Alexandria with it and delivered it to me. And Baibars trusted you.\"  \"As he trusts you, Sire,\" Daoud put in quickly.  \"_You_ are like a falcon, are you not?\" said Manfred, smiling into Daoud's eyes. \"Released to fly far afield for your sultan.\"  Manfred strode to Daoud suddenly and clapped him on the shoulder. \"Let it be done as your master wishes, then. The trader from Trebizond will go to Orvieto with my help.\"  A surge of joy sprang up within Daoud and almost burst past his lips. He bowed, his heart pounding.  _God be thanked!_  Manfred said, \"We must see about turning this jewel of yours into gold coins. Or smaller jewels. They would be easier to carry than gold.\" Manfred looked lovingly at the emerald again, then carefully dropped it into his belt pouch and smiled at Daoud.  \"You should not go alone into the Papal States, David. You may have studied Europe from afar, but you do not know Italy firsthand. Lorenzo here shall go with you. I trust Lorenzo to travel far and secretly in my service, even as your master trusts you.\"  Celino sighed. Daoud and Celino eyed each other.  Daoud began searching for ways to dissuade Manfred. A short while earlier he and Celino had been trying to kill each other. And Celino would be putting Manfred's interests first, not those of Islam.  Obviously aware of his hesitation, Manfred took his arm. \"Listen to me, Mameluke. You will be wise to accept every bit of help that is offered to you. I have powerful allies in northern Italy, in Florence, Pisa, Siena, and other cities. But you do not know them and they do not know you. Lorenzo speaks for me. He knows who the key Ghibellini are in the north, and they know him. Do not object to taking him with you.\"  Manfred would not let him go, Daoud realized, unless Celino went with him. And the argument that Celino could put him in touch with the Ghibellini of the north was a strong one.  _Lorenzo is perhaps twenty years older than I, but he is quick-witted and quick on his feet. And, yes, I would rather not go alone. I could easily make a mistake from ignorance. I am better off with a man like this to guide me._  A tentative smile played under Celino's grizzled mustache. \"My royal master is determined in this. What do you say?\"  Daoud bowed. \"I accept. With gratitude. We shall travel this road together.\"  \"Whatever happens to the two of you,\" Manfred said, \"no one must ever know that I am involved.\"  \"I guarantee that, Sire,\" said Celino.  Manfred rubbed the palms of his hands together. \"There is one other person I propose to send with you. She can be a great help to you.\"  Celino turned quickly to Manfred. \"I do not advise it, Sire.\"  \"Why not?\" said Manfred. \"She will be perfect.\"  \"Because she will not want to go.\" There was censure in Celino's dark stare--and a boyish defiance in Manfred's answering look.  \"Do not question me,\" said Manfred. \"I have no choice. For her good and for my own, she must leave here. And she _will_ be useful to you.\"  Instead of replying, Celino only sighed again.  \"A woman?\" Daoud was thunderstruck. In El Kahira women left their homes only to visit other women. He felt anxiety claw at his belly. Any mistake in planning might wreck the mission and doom him, and Celino, to a horrible death. And to send a woman to the court of the pope on such a venture seemed not just a mistake, but utter madness.  \"A very beautiful woman,\" said Manfred, a grin stretching his blond mustache. \"One who has had a lifetime's schooling in intrigue. She is from Constantinople, and her name is Sophia, which means wisdom in Greek.\"  _There are no more treacherous people on this earth than the Byzantines_, Daoud thought, _and they have ever been enemies of Islam_.  Argument surged up in him, but he saw a hardness in Manfred's eyes that told him nothing he might say would sway the king. He looked at Celino, and saw in the dark, mustached face the same reluctant acceptance he had heard in the sigh.  Whoever this Sophia might be, he would have to take her with him.     IV   Sophia pressed her head back against the pillow and screamed with pleasure. Her loins dissolved into rippling liquid gold. Her fingers dug into the man's back and her legs clenched around his hips, trying to crush him against her.  \"Oh--oh--oh--\" she moaned. The warmth spread to her toes, her fingertips, her scalp, filling her with joy. She was so happy that she wanted to cry.  As the blaze of ekstasia died down, she felt Manfred driving deep inside her. She felt his hardness, his separateness, as she could not feel it a moment ago when she was at her peak and they seemed to melt together, one being.  His rhythm was insistent, inexorable, like a heartbeat. His hands under her back were tense. He was fighting for his climax.  She delighted in the sight of his massive shoulders overshadowing her. It was almost like being loved by a god.  Manfred's face was pressed against her shoulder, his open mouth on her collarbone. She turned toward him and saw the light in his white-gold hair. She slid one hand up to his hair and stroked it, while with the other she rubbed his back in a circular motion.  She felt the muscles in his body tighten against her. He drew in a shuddering breath.  \"Yes--yes--good,\" she whispered, still stroking his hair, still caressing his back.  He relaxed, panting heavily.  _He never makes much noise. Nothing like my outcries._  They lay without moving, she pleased by the warm weight of him lying upon her, as if it protected her from floating away. The feel of him still inside her sent wavelets of pleasure through her.  Still adrift on sensations of delight, she opened her eyes to stare up into the shadows of the canopy overhead. On the heavy bed curtains to her left, the late afternoon sun cast an oblong of yellow light with a pointed arch at the top, the shape of an open window nearby. She knew well the play of light in this unoccupied bedchamber in an upper part of the castle. Manfred and she had met here many times.  They rolled together so that they lay side by side in a nest of red and purple cushions. The down-filled silk bolster under them whispered as they shifted their weight, and the rope netting that held it creaked. Manfred propped his head up with one arm. His free hand toyed with the ringlets of her unbound hair. She slid her palm over his chest.  She remembered an ancient sculpture she had seen in a home outside Athens. The torso of a man, head missing, arms broken off at the shoulders, legs gone below the knees, the magnificent body had survived barbarian invasions, the coming of Christianity, the iconoclasts, the Frankish conquest, to stand now on a plain pedestal in a room with purple walls, the yellowish marble gleaming in the light of many candles. Her host showed it only to his most trusted guests.  \"Which god is this?\" she had asked.  \"I think it is just an athlete,\" said her host. \"The old Greeks made gods of their athletes.\"  Manfred's naked torso, pale as marble, seemed as beautiful. And was alive.  She sighed happily. \"How lucky I am that there was time for love in my king's life this afternoon.\" She spoke in the Sicilian dialect, Manfred's favorite of all his languages.  How lucky, she thought, that after all her years of wandering she had at last found a place in the world where she was loved and needed.  His lips stretched in a smile, but his blue eyes were empty. Uneasiness took hold of her. She sensed from the look on his face that he was about to tell her something she did not want to hear.         *       *       *       *       *  In memory she heard a voice say, _Italy was ours not so long ago and might be ours again_. So Michael Paleologos, the Basileus, Emperor of Constantinople, had introduced the suggestion that she go to Italy, and at just such a moment as this, when they were in bed together in his hunting lodge outside Nicaea.  She had felt no distress at the idea of being parted from Michael. He was a scrawny man with a long gray beard, and though she counted herself enormously lucky to have attracted his attention, she felt no love for him.  She had come to Lucera acting as Michael's agent and personal emissary to Manfred--and resenting Michael's use of her but feeling she had no choice. She was a present from one monarch to another. She ought to be flattered, she supposed.  She had walked into Manfred's court in the embroidered jeweled mantle Michael had given her, her hair bound up in silver netting. Lorenzo Celino had conducted her to the throne, and she bowed and looked up. And it was like gazing upon the sun.  Manfred von Hohenstaufen's smile was brilliant, his hair white-gold, his eyes sapphires.  He stepped down from his throne, took her hand, and led her to his eight-sided garden. First she gave him Michael's messages--news that a Tartar army had stormed the crusader city of Sidon, leveled it, and ridden off again--a warning that Pope Urban had secretly offered the crown of Naples and Sicily, Manfred's crown, to Prince Edward, heir apparent to the throne of England.  \"Your royal master is kind, but the pope's secret is no secret,\" Manfred had said, laughing and unconcerned. \"The nobility of England "]]]
