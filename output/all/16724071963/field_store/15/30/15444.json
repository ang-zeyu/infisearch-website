The book is full of choice recipes, every one of which has been successfully tested by Mrs. Rorer and found to come out right. This alone is of incalculable benefit and ought to commend the book to the favorable consideration of every housekeeper.  The use of this book in the home means better health, better living, economy in the use of food, and a consequent saving in dollars and cents.  12mo, nearly 600 pages, with portrait of author; bound in cloth, $1.00 net; by mail, $1.15   =Mrs. Rorer's Vegetable Cookery and Meat Substitutes=  This book has a twofold object:    1. To show the value of vegetables in their relation to diet and   health, how to prepare, cook and serve them, what to eat under certain   conditions of health, and thus have them perform their proper work.    2. To give to the prudent housewife a knowledge of combinations of   foods in the shape of toothsome recipes to take the place of meat, or   as we call them--Meat Substitutes.  It goes without saying that we all know too little about the value of vegetables as food. We eat them because they are palatable, not realizing their immense importance as body builders. Here they are classified, and thus made to give us a right idea of their use.  Then as to Meat Substitutes. It is not necessary to be a vegetarian to desire a change from a meat diet. There are health reasons often demanding abstention from meats; or economy may be an impelling motive; or a desire for change and variety in the daily bill of fare may be warrant enough. However we look at it here is the wonder book to point the way to better and healthier living.  There is an abundance of the choicest and most palatable recipes, and they are given in such a manner, that if the directions are followed, the results are sure. You cannot make mistakes.  12mo, cloth, $1.50 net; by mail, $1.65   =Mrs. Rorer's Every Day Menu Book=  In the course of her teaching and editorial work, there have come to Mrs. Rorer frequent requests for a book that will provide a daily bill of fare, one that will be at once rational, its directions easy of accomplishment, and give an excellent variety.

A fine volume that ought to commend itself to every housekeeper.  12mo, 300 pages, handsomely illustrated; bound in cloth $1.50 net; by mail, $1.65   =Mrs. Rorer's Cakes, Icings and Fillings=  Every one is interested in the cake problem.

With a group of ODD SALADS and some CEYLON SALADS.  A salad made from a succulent green vegetable and French dressing, should be seen on the dinner table in every well-regulated household three hundred and sixty-five times a year. These green vegetables contain the salts necessary to the well being of our blood; the oil is an easily-digested form of fatty matter; the lemon juice gives us sufficient acid; therefore simple salads are exceedingly wholesome.  During the summer, the dinner salad may be composed of any well-cooked green vegetable, served with a French dressing; string beans, cauliflower, a mixture of peas, turnips, carrots and new beets, boiled radishes, cucumbers, tomatoes, uncooked cabbage, and cooked spinach.

With many new and valuable recipes.  We quote from the author's introduction:  \"Economical marketing does not mean the purchase of inferior articles at a cheap price, but of a small quantity of the best materials found in the market; these materials to be wisely and economically used. Small quantity and no waste, just enough and not a piece too much, is a good rule to remember. In roasts and steaks, however, there will be, in spite of careful buying, bits left over, that if economically used, may be converted into palatable, sightly and wholesome dishes for the next day's lunch or supper.\"  12mo, cloth, 50 cents net; by mail, 55 cents   =Mrs. Rorer's Sandwiches=  Of all the useful and dependable articles of food, commend us to the Sandwich.

E. J. DILLON   WITH AN INTRODUCTION  BY  THE HON. W. M. HUGHES, M.P. PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA  BRENTANO'S NEW YORK  CHAPMAN & HALL LTD. LONDON  1917  PRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY RICHARD CLAY & SONS, LIMITED, BRUNSWICK ST., STAMFORD ST., S.E. 1, AND BUNGAY SUFFOLK  TO  H.S.H. ALICE PRINCESS OF MONACO  THIS PARTIAL PRESENTMENT OF THE BEGINNINGS OF A WORLD CATACLYSM     INTRODUCTION   Behind any human institution there stand a few men--perhaps only one man--who direct its movement, protect its interests, or serve as its mouthpiece. This applies to nations. If we wish to know for what a nation stands and what are its ideals and by what means it seeks to realise them, we shall do well to know something of the men who lead its people or express their feelings.  It is of vital importance that we should understand the attitude of every one of the nations--both friends and enemies--involved in this war. For in this way only can we know what is necessary to be done to achieve victory.  And the remarkable man who has written this book knows those who lead the warring nations in this titanic conflict very much better than ordinary men know their own townsmen.  Dr. Dillon has moved through the chancelleries of Europe. He has seen and heard what has been denied to all but very few. In the Balkans, that cauldron of racial passions which, overflowing, gave our enemies an ostensible cause for this war, he moved as though an invisible and yet keenly observant figure. He could claim the friendship of Venizelos and other Balkan statesmen. He has travelled as a monk throughout the mountain fastnesses, he has slept in the caves of Albania. He understands the people of all the Balkans, speaks their tongues as a native, and knows and assesses at their true value their leaders.  At the time of the murder of the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduchess, Dr. Dillon was in Austria, and he remained there through those long negotiations in which Germany tenaciously clung to her design of war.  How well he knows Germany let his book speak. His knowledge of Russia is profound. A master of many languages, he occupied a chair at the Moscow University for many years, and his insight into Russian politics is deep.  In this book he speaks out of the depth of his knowledge, and tells the people of Britain what this war means to them, and what needs to be done before we can hope for victory. He speaks plainly because he feels strongly.  It may be that we cannot agree with him in everything that he says. But no one, after reading Dr. Dillon's remarkable book, will any longer regard the war as but a passing episode. It is a timely antidote to that fatal delusion.  For this war is a veritable cataclysm, and the future of the world hangs upon the result. We must change our lives. Insidiously, while we have called all foreigners brothers and sought foes amongst ourselves, the great force of barbarism, in a new guise and with enormous power of penetration and annexation, has worked for our undoing. This force now stands bared, in the hideous bestiality of Germany's doctrine of Might, and it can be defeated only by an adaptation of its methods that will leave nothing as it was before.  Dr. Dillon's unfolding of the story of German preparation is, it will be admitted, one of fascinating interest. Of its value as a contribution to political and diplomatic history it is not for me to speak. But to its purpose in keying all men to the pitch; all to a sense of the great events in which we are taking part, I bear my testimony. \"Germany is wholly alive, physically, intellectually, and psychically. And she lives in the present and future\" (p. 311). And the living force of Germany requires us to rise to the very fulness of our powers; for as the champions of truth and right we must prove ourselves physically and morally stronger than the champions of soulless might.  Germany is wholly alive; but she is alive for evil. We whose purpose is good, whose cause is justice and whose triumph is indispensable if honest industry and human right are not to disappear from mankind, are as yet not fully alive to the immensity and necessity of our task. We must awaken, or be awakened, ere it be too late.  Germany is living in the present and in the future. It is a present of determined effort, of unlimited sacrifice, of colossal hope. The future for which she strives and suffers is a future incompatible with those ideals which our race cherishes and reveres. Either our philosophy, our religion and code prevail, or they fade into decay, and Germany's aims remain. The choice is definite.  There can be no parley, no compromise with the evil thing for which Germany fights. There is not room for both. One must go down.  We must win outright. And we can and shall win--if we bend every thought, our whole will, our every energy, our utmost intensity of determination to the great work. Failing this, we shall secure only a victory equivalent to defeat. We chose the part of free men, and, when purified by complete self-sacrifice, shall emerge from the ordeal a great and regenerated people.  W. M. HUGHES.     CONTENTS   CHAP.

They have belied or confirmed various forecasts, fulfilled some few hopes, blasted many others, and obliged the allied peoples to carry forward most of their cherished anticipations to another year's account. Meanwhile the balance as it stands offers ample food for sobering reflection, but will doubtless evoke dignified resignation and grim resolve on the part of those who confidently looked for better things.  The items of which that balance is made up are worth careful scrutiny for the sake of the hints which they offer for future guidance. The essence of their teaching is that we Allies are engaged not in a war of the by-past type in which only our armies and navies are contending with those of the adversary according to accepted rules, but in a tremendous struggle wherein our enemies are deploying all their resources without reserve or scruple for the purpose of destroying or crippling our peoples. Unless, therefore, we have the will and the means to mobilize our admittedly vaster facilities and materials and make these subservient to our aim, we are at a disadvantage which will profoundly influence the final result. It will be a source of comfort to optimists to think that, looking back on the vicissitudes of the first twenty months' campaign, they can discern evidences that there is somewhere a statesman's hand methodically moulding events to our advantage, or attempering their most sinister effects. Those who fail to perceive any such traces must look for solace to future developments. For there are many who fancy that the economy of our energies has been carried to needless lengths, that the adjustment of means to ends lacks thoroughness and precision, and that our leaders have kept over rigorously within the narrow range of partial aims, instead of surveying the problem in its totality and enlarging the permanent efficacy of their precautions against unprecedented dangers.  The twenty months that have just lapsed into history have done much to loosen the hold of some of the baleful insular prejudices which heretofore held sway over the minds of nearly all sections of the British nation. It may well be, therefore, that we are now better able to grasp the significance of the principal events of the war, and to seek it not in their immediate effects on the course of the struggle, but in the roots--still far from lifeless--whence they sprang. For it is not so much the upshot of the first phases of the campaign as the deep-lying causes which rendered them a foregone conclusion that force themselves on our consideration. Those causes are still operative, and unless they be speedily uprooted will continue to work havoc with our hopes.  It is now fairly evident that the present war is but a violent phase in the unfolding of a grandiose ground idea--the subjugation of Europe by the Teuton--which was being steadily realized ever since the close of"]]]
