It's the place he ought to have, for he has done more for us than anybody else, and Odell and Percy will be the lieutenants. Put those in the box when the time comes.\"  Rodney took the ballots that were placed in his hand, and just then some one called out:  \"Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes! All you Rangers fall in in single rank here in front of headquarters, and be ready to cast your votes for captain.\"  Rodney laughed heartily.  \"That's the deputy sheriff,\" said the recruit with whom he had been conversing, as the two hastened toward the captain's tent. \"There isn't much military about that order.\"  \"It'll do,\" replied Rodney. \"The boys seem to understand it, and what more do you want?\"  \"Now answer to your names,\" continued the deputy; whereupon Rodney laughed again.  \"What ought he to have said?\" inquired his friend.  \"Listen to roll-call, would be the proper order,\" said the Barrington boy. \"But it's all right. Guerillas are not supposed to be posted in such things.\"  \"But we are not guerillas.\"  \"Look in your dictionary and you will find that you can't make us out to be anything else,\" replied Rodney.  The two fell in side by side and answered to their names when they were called. The Barrington boy supposed that nominations would now be in order, but it seemed that they had already been made from captain down to fourth corporal. The Rangers were faced to the right and ordered to march up one at a time and deposit their votes for captain in the ballot-box (a cigar box with a slot in the cover), beside which stood the three \"inspectors of election\" who were to count the votes after they were all in, and who had been chosen before Rodney arrived on the ground. When the balloting was completed the company had countermarched twice, and stood on the same ground it occupied before the ceremony began. One of the inspectors emptied the contents of the cigar box on the table, another opened the first ballot that came to his hand and called out the name that was written upon it, and the third kept count. The result was just what Rodney's friend told him it would be.  \"There were sixty-five votes cast, and they one and all bear the name of our popular friend Robert Hubbard,\" said the inspector and the announcement was received with cheers.  \"Speech! Speech!\" shouted the Rangers.  \"No, no!\" replied the newly elected captain. \"There are two lieutenants, one orderly sergeant, five duty sergeants and four corporals yet to be elected, and we don't want to waste any time in foolishness.\"  \"Have you got your ballots ready for first lieutenant?\" inquired the deputy sheriff, who continued to act as master of ceremonies. \"Then face to the right again and march yourselves around here and put 'em in the box. Laugh away, Rodney,\" he added, smiling good-naturedly and shaking his head at the Barrington boy. \"We'll get the hang of these things after a while.\"  The voting was gone through with the same as before, and there was more cheering and clapping of hands when the inspector announced that Hiram Odell had been unanimously elected to the office of first lieutenant; but following the example of his superior he declined to waste time in speech-making.  And now Rodney Gray began to take a deeper interest in what was going on. The second lieutenant would be voted for next, and Tom Randolph, whose father had done so much for the company, had had the impudence to bring himself forward as a candidate. It couldn't be possible, Rodney thought, that such an ignorant upstart stood any chance of election when his opponent was so popular a young man as Albert Percy. He stood where he could see Tom's face, and there was not a particle of color in it. If he could have looked into the ballot Tom held in his hand, he would have found that the name written upon it was that of Thomas Randolph himself. The candidate intended to vote in his own favor and he did; but it did not bring him the coveted office. When the result was announced he had just twelve votes. All the others were cast for Albert Percy. Then there was more cheering, but Tom didn't join in; and neither did he shout out a responsive \"Aye\" when it was proposed that the election be declared unanimous. On the contrary he looked daggers at every man in the ranks whose eye he could reach; and he could reach more than half of them, for the line was almost as crooked as a rail fence.  \"That's a pretty way for them to treat me after all the exertions my father has made and the money he has promised to spend for the company,\" said Tom to the sympathizing friend who stood next on the right. \"I believe I'll haul out.\"  \"Don't do it,\" was the reply. \"Stay in and help beat the rest of that ticket. It's all cut and dried.\"  \"Of course it is and has been for some time. I could see it now if I had only half an eye; but they have been so sly about it that I never suspected it before. Slip out of the line and tell everybody who voted for me to vote against Gray, no matter what they put him up for. We'll show them that they don't run the company.\"  \"Have you got your votes ready for orderly sergeant?\" inquired the deputy.  \"I'd like to say a word before the vote is taken,\" said Captain Hubbard, without giving any one time to answer the sheriff's question, \"and that is, that the office of orderly sergeant is one of the most important in the company.\"  \"I wonder how he happens to know so much,\" whispered Tom Randolph to the Ranger who touched elbows with him on the right; and in a minute more he found out.  \"Ever since I began taking an active part in getting up this company,\" continued the captain, \"I have been in correspondence with a military friend who has taken pains to post me on some matters that are not touched upon in the tactics. Among other things he warned me that if we intend to do business in military form, we must be careful whom we select for the office of orderly. He ought to be a thorough-going soldier--\"  \"Gray, Gray! Sergeant Rodney Gray!\" yelled a score of voices.  \"Very well, gentlemen,\" said the captain, who looked both surprised and pleased. \"If he is your choice I have nothing to say beyond this: I shall be more than satisfied with his election.\"  \"Randolph, Randolph!\" shouted Tom's friends, believing that if he could not get one office he might be willing to take another; but it turned out that their candidate was not that sort of fellow.  \"I don't want it, and what's more to the point, I won't accept it,\" said he, wrathfully. \"If any one votes for me he will only be wasting his ballot, for I am going to leave the company. Do you suppose I am such a fool as to allow myself to be set up and bowled over by Rodney Gray?\" he added in an undertone, in response to a mild protest from his friend on the right. \"His supporters are in the majority and no one else need look for a show.\"  Everybody was surprised to hear this declaration from the lips of one who had thus far taken the deepest interest in the organization and done all in his power to help it along, and several of the Rangers leaned forward to get a glimpse of the speaker's face to see if he really meant what he said. Rodney glanced toward the captain to see how he took it, and learned what it was that induced the defeated candidate to take this stand. Leaning upon his cane just inside the door of the captain's tent was Mr. Randolph, whose face was fully as black as Tom's, and who nodded approvingly at every word the angry young man uttered.  \"I haven't been sworn in yet, and am as free to go and come as I was a month ago,\" declared Tom.  \"For the matter of that, so are we all,\" answered the captain, who had known a week beforehand that young Randolph was sure to be defeated, and that he would take it very much to heart. \"But I considered myself bound from the time I put my name to this muster-roll. We can't be sworn in except by a State officer, for the minute we consent to that, that minute we give up our freedom and render ourselves liable to be ordered to the remotest point in the Confederacy. We are partisans, and never will surrender our right to do as we please.\"  Captain Hubbard and his company of Rangers were not the only dupes there were in the Confederacy at that moment. It was well known that the new government was in full sympathy with partisan organizations; and its agents industriously circulated the report that it would not only aid in the formation of such organizations, but would allow them full liberty of action after they were sworn into the service of their State. The government knew the temper of the Southern people, and was well aware that the desire to emulate the example of such heroes as Marion would draw into the service many a dashing youngster who might otherwise stay out of it. What could be more alluring to a hot-head like Rodney Gray than the wild, free, and glorious life which the simple word \"partisan\" conjured up? The ruse, for that's just what it was, proved successful. Partisan companies sprung into existence all over the South, but in less than twelve months after the war began there was not one of them in the service. Neither were there any such things as State troops.  When Morgan and Forrest were first heard of they were known and acknowledged as partisans; and the former carried his partisanship so far that when General Buckner declined to give him permission to act upon his own responsibility, he took possession of a deserted house, went into camp there, and supported his men out of his own pocket; but before the war closed both he and Forrest were Confederate generals, and their men were regularly sworn into the Confederate service.  We said that the State troops also had ceased to exist, and the following incident proves it: When the Governor of Arkansas called upon his troops, who were serving in the Army of the Center, to come home at once and save their State from threatened invasion, General Beauregard"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29300"],["title","Rodney, the Partisan (#4)"],["body","to have permitted them to obey the summons. He could not do otherwise and be consistent, for if the eleven rebellious States made the Confederacy, they surely had the right to unmake it. But did he live up to the principles for which he was fighting? On the contrary he surrounded those Arkansas troops with a wall of gleaming bayonets backed by frowning batteries, and gave them just five minutes to make up their minds whether or not they would return to duty. The government at Richmond was a despotism of the worst sort, as more than one poor, deluded rebel found to his sorrow; and yet Jefferson Davis and the rest of them stoutly maintained that they were fighting for the right of the States to do as they pleased.  \"I don't consider myself bound to stay in the company for no other reason than because my name is on that muster-roll,\" said Randolph.  \"Stick to it and we'll back you up,\" whispered the recruit on Tom's right.  \"If I drop out of the ranks will you come too?\" whispered Randolph, in reply.  \"I will, and so will all the rest.\"  Being thus encouraged Randolph stepped out of the line and walked off toward his father's carriage, to which his indignant mother had already beat a dignified retreat. When he had gone a little distance he looked behind him and saw, with no little satisfaction, that he was followed by eleven others who were displeased by the way the election was going.  They were the ones who had been urged into the company by Mr. Randolph, who had promised to see them well fitted out with horses and weapons, and of course they felt bound to follow the example of his son. There were those who believed that Mr. Randolph would not have taken so much interest in the company if he had not believed that every recruit he brought into it would cast a vote for Tom.  Here was a pretty state of affairs, thought Captain Hubbard, who looked troubled rather than vexed. He did not care so much for the desertion of young Randolph and his friends (although the unexpected withdrawal of twelve men from his command was no small matter), but he did care for the spirit that prompted their action. It was a rule or ruin policy he did not like to see manifested at that juncture. He was well enough acquainted with Randolph to know that he would not be satisfied with simply deserting the company, but would try in all ways to be revenged upon every member of it who had voted against him. While the captain was thinking about it, somebody tried to make matters worse by setting up a loud hiss, and in an instant the sound was carried along the whole length of the line. It wasn't stopped, either, until Rodney Gray stepped to the front.  \"Mr. Commander,\" said he, raising his hand to his cap with a military flourish, \"I don't want this position. The officers already chosen have been fairly elected, but I'll vote for Randolph for the next highest office in the gift of the company, if he can be induced to come back.\"  \"Haven't you heard him say that he don't want it and won't take it?\" replied the captain. \"I think the Rangers know what they are doing. Proceed with the election.\"  \"But, Captain, I don't want to be a clerk,\" protested Rodney. \"I want to be a soldier. Aside from his writing, the orderly has little to do but loaf about camp all the while, keeping an eye on the company property, signing requisitions and drilling awkward squads, and that's a job I don't want. What's more, without any intention of being disrespectful, I'll not take it. There must be some here who want it, and who can do that sort of work as well, if not better than I can. If you think you must put me in for something, let me be a duty sergeant, so that I will have a chance to go on a scout now and then.\"  So saying the Barrington boy made another flourish with his hand and stepped back to his place in the ranks with military precision.  \"Now, Rodney, take that back,\" said Lieutenant Percy, with most unbecoming familiarity. \"You are the only military man in the company, and I don't see how we can get along without you.\"  \"I'll tell you what I'll do, Rodney,\" chimed in Captain Hubbard. \"You take the position, and I will promise that you shall go out on a scout as often as you please.\"  The Barrington boy's face relaxed into a broad grin.  \"Captain,\" said he, \"what sort of an organization is this any way--a mob or a military company?\"  \"Now, what is the use of your asking such a question as that?\" demanded the captain, rather sharply.  \"Well, then, if it is a military company, I suppose you intend to be governed by military rules, do you not?\"  \"Of course we do, if we have brains enough to find out what those rules are.\"  \"I have no fears on that score; and when you find out what those rules are, you will see that you have no business to let me go out on a scout as often as I please.\"  \"What's the reason I haven't?\" exclaimed the captain. \"I command the company, don't I?\"  \"You certainly do.\"  \"And haven't I a right to do as I please?\"  \"That depends upon circumstances. Do you intend to remain right here about home?\"  \"Not by a jugful. We're going to belong to some part of the army, if we have to go clear up to Missouri to find a commander who will take us.\"  \"Then you will find that you can't do as you please. The minute that commander accepts you, he will swear you and all of us into the service.\"  \"After we have been sworn into the service of the State?\"  \"Certainly.\"  \"I don't believe it,\" said Captain Hubbard, bluntly. \"He wouldn't have any right to do it.\"  The boy's words raised a chorus of dissent all along the line, and Lieutenant Odell said, as soon as he could make himself heard:  \"You are way off the track, Rodney. What did we secede for if it wasn't to prove the doctrine of State Rights? If we are going to give our liberty up to a new government, we might as well have stayed under the old.\" And all the Rangers uttered a hearty \"That's so.\"  \"You'll see,\" replied Rodney, who was greatly amused by the look of astonishment his words had brought to the faces around him. \"A general would look pretty accepting the services of a company he couldn't command, wouldn't he, now?\"  \"But he could command us,\" said everybody in the line; and Captain Hubbard added: \"I'd promise that we would obey him as promptly and readily as any of his regular troops.\"  \"But that wouldn't satisfy him. He'd want the power to make us obey him, or we might take it into our heads to leave him when things didn't go to suit, just as Randolph and his friends have left us. If we should try any little game like that in the face of the enemy, he might have the last one of us shot.\"  \"What do you think of the prospect, boys?\" said the captain, pulling out his handkerchief and mopping his face with it. He was all in the dark and wanted somebody to suggest something.  \"Look here, Rodney,\" said Lieutenant Percy. \"If you knew our company was to go up in smoke what did you join it for?\"  \"I don't believe it is going up in smoke,\" was the reply. \"I certainly hope it isn't, for I am under promise to go into the service, and would rather go with my friends and neighbors than with strangers; but if we are going to bear arms, we've got to have authority from somebody to do it.\"  \"Why, we'll get that from the State of Louisiana,\" exclaimed the Rangers, almost as one man. \"The State is supreme, no one outside of it has a right to command our services, and State Rights will be our battle-cry, if we need one.\"  \"All right,\" exclaimed Rodney. \"I am here to share the fortunes of the company, whatever they may be, but I can't take the position you have so kindly offered me, and I beg you will not urge me further. Give it to some one who wants it, and I will do all I can to help him.\"  \"Well, that's different,\" said the captain, who seemed to be much relieved. \"Fall out and prepare your ballots; and you had better fix 'em all up while you are about it, so that there may be no further delay.\"  The order to \"fall out\" was quite unnecessary, for the ranks were pretty well broken before the captain gave it. He allowed them half an hour in which to write out their ballots, and then the line was reformed, after a fashion, and the voting went on; and although the results were in the main satisfactory, there were some long faces among the Rangers.  \"Never mind,\" said Rodney, who had been elected first duty sergeant. \"You outsiders may have a chance yet. I'll bet a picayune that if this company sees any service at all, it will not be mustered out with the same officers it has now. Bone your tactics night and day, and then if there is an examination, you will stand as good a chance as anybody. Captain, who is going to commission you?\"  \"I have been commissioned already; that is to say, I have been authorized by the governor to raise a company of independent cavalry to be mustered into the State service. That is all right, isn't it?\"  \"I suppose it is,\" replied the boy; and then he walked off to find his father, thoughtfully pulling his under lip as he went.  \"What's the matter?\" inquired Mr. Gray, as his son approached the place where he was standing. \"Wasn't the election satisfactory? I thought the best men were chosen.\"  \"I wasn't thinking about that,\" was the answer. \"If we are mustered into the service of the State, we must of course be sworn in. This State is a part of the Confederacy; and if the Confederacy calls upon Louisiana for troops then what?\"  \"Why, then you would have to go. I reckon,\" replied one of the planters who was talking with his father.  \"Yes, I reckon we would: and we'd have to take the oath to support the Confederacy, and that would take us out from under the control of the State and make us Confederate troops, wouldn't it? It's a sort of mixed-up mess and I don't see where our independence comes in. But the boys seem to think it is all right and I suppose it is.\"  But it wasn't all right, and the sequel proved it.                                  CHAPTER III.                     "]]]
