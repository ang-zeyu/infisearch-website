I'd con      Each precept the harsh world enjoins, I'd take      Our ancestors' stern verdicts one by one,      I'd bind myself before then to exact      The prescribed vengeance--and one word of hers,      The sight of her, the bare least memory      Of Mildred, my one sister, my heart's pride      Above all prides, my all in all so long,      Would scatter every trace of my resolve.      What were it silently to waste away      And see her waste away from this day forth,      Two scathed things with leisure to repent,      And grow acquainted with the grave, and die      Tired out if not at peace, and be forgotten?      It were not so impossible to bear.      But this--that, fresh from last night's pledge renewed      Of love with the successful gallant there,      She calmly bids me help her to entice,      Inveigle an unconscious trusting youth      Who thinks her all that's chaste and good and pure,      --Invites me to betray him... who so fit      As honour's self to cover shame's arch-deed?      --That she'll receive Lord Mertoun--(her own phrase)--      This, who could bear?  Why, you have heard of thieves,      Stabbers, the earth's disgrace, who yet have laughed,      \"Talk not to me of torture--I'll betray      No comrade I've pledged faith to!\"--you have heard      Of wretched women--all but Mildreds--tied      By wild illicit ties to losels vile      You'd tempt them to forsake; and they'll reply      \"Gold, friends, repute, I left for him, I find      In him, why should I leave him then, for gold,      Repute or friends?\"--and you have felt your heart      Respond to such poor outcasts of the world      As to so many friends; bad as you please,      You've felt they were God's men and women still,      So, not to be disowned by you.  But she      That stands there, calmly gives her lover up      As means to wed the Earl that she may hide      Their intercourse the surelier:  and, for this,      I curse her to her face before you all.      Shame hunt her from the earth!  Then Heaven do right      To both!  It hears me now--shall judge her then!           [AS MILDRED faints and falls, TRESHAM rushes out.]       AUSTIN.  Stay, Tresham, we'll accompany you!       GUENDOLEN.                                    We?      What, and leave Mildred?  We?  Why, where's my place      But by her side, and where yours but by mine?      Mildred--one word!  Only look at me, then!       AUSTIN.  No, Guendolen!  I echo Thorold's voice.      She is unworthy to behold...       GUENDOLEN.                    Us two?      If you spoke on reflection, and if I      Approved your speech--if you (to put the thing      At lowest) you the soldier, bound to make      The king's cause yours and fight for it, and throw      Regard to others of its right or wrong,      --If with a death-white woman you can help,      Let alone sister, let alone a Mildred,      You left her--or if I, her cousin, friend      This morning, playfellow but yesterday,      Who said, or thought at least a thousand times,      \"I'd serve you if I could,\" should now face round      And say, \"Ah, that's to only signify      I'd serve you while you're fit to serve yourself:      So long as fifty eyes await the turn      Of yours to forestall its yet half-formed wish,      I'll proffer my assistance you'll not need--      When every tongue is praising you, I'll join      The praisers' chorus--when you're hemmed about      With lives between you and detraction--lives      To be laid down if a rude voice, rash eye,      Rough hand should violate the sacred ring      Their worship throws about you,--then indeed,      Who'll stand up for you stout as I?\"  If so      We said, and so we did,--not Mildred there      Would be unworthy to behold us both,      But we should be unworthy, both of us.      To be beheld by--by--your meanest dog,      Which, if that sword were broken in your face      Before a crowd, that badge torn off your breast,      And you cast out with hooting and contempt,      --Would push his way thro' all the hooters, gain      Your side, go off with you and all your shame      To the next ditch you choose to die in!  Austin,      Do you love me?  Here's Austin, Mildred,--here's      Your brother says he does not believe half--      No, nor half that--of all he heard!  He says,      Look up and take his hand!       AUSTIN.                     Look up and take      My hand, dear Mildred!       MILDRED.                I--I was so young!      Beside, I loved him, Thorold--and I had      No mother; God forgot me:  so, I fell.       GUENDOLEN.  Mildred!       MILDRED.              Require no further!  Did I dream      That I could palliate what is done?  All's true.      Now, punish me!  A woman takes my hand?      Let go my hand!  You do not know, I see.      I thought that Thorold told you.       GUENDOLEN.                        What is this?      Where start you to?       MILDRED.             Oh, Austin, loosen me!      You heard the whole of it--your eyes were worse,      In their surprise, than Thorold's!  Oh, unless      You stay to execute his sentence, loose      My hand!  Has Thorold gone, and are you here?       GUENDOLEN.  Here, Mildred, we two friends of yours will wait      Your bidding; be you silent, sleep or muse!      Only, when you shall want your bidding done,      How can we do it if we are not by?      Here's Austin waiting patiently your will!      One spirit to command, and one to love      And to believe in it and do its best,      Poor as that is, to help it--why, the world      Has been won many a time, its length and breadth,      By just such a beginning!       MILDRED.                   I believe      If once I threw my arms about your neck      And sunk my head upon your breast, that I      Should weep again.       GUENDOLEN.          Let go her hand now, Austin!      Wait for me.  Pace the gallery and think      On the world's seemings and realities,      Until I call you.           [AUSTIN goes.]       MILDRED.  No--I cannot weep.      No more tears from this brain--no sleep--no tears!      O Guendolen, I love you!       GUENDOLEN.                Yes:  and \"love\"      Is a short word that says so very much!      It says that you confide in me.       MILDRED.                         Confide!       GUENDOLEN.  Your lover's name, then!  I've so much to learn,      Ere I can work in your behalf!       MILDRED.                        My friend,      You know I cannot tell his name.       GUENDOLEN.                        At least      He is your lover? and you love him too?       MILDRED.  Ah, do you ask me that,--but I am fallen      So low!       GUENDOLEN.  You love him still, then?       MILDRED.                               My sole prop      Against the guilt that crushes me!  I say,      Each night ere I lie down, \"I was so young--      I had no mother, and I loved him so!\"      And then God seems indulgent, and I dare      Trust him my soul in sleep.       GUENDOLEN.                   How could you let us      E'en talk to you about Lord Mertoun then?       MILDRED.  There is a cloud around me.       GUENDOLEN.                             But you said      You would receive his suit in spite of this?       MILDRED.  I say there is a cloud...       GUENDOLEN.                           No cloud to me!      Lord Mertoun and your lover are the same!       MILDRED.  What maddest fancy...       GUENDOLEN [calling aloud.] Austin! (spare your pains--      When I have got a truth, that truth I keep)--       MILDRED.  By all you love, sweet Guendolen, forbear!      Have I confided in you...       GUENDOLEN.                 Just for this!      Austin!--Oh, not to guess it at the first!      But I did guess it--that is, I divined,      Felt by an instinct how it was:  why else      Should I pronounce you free from all that heap      Of sins which had been irredeemable?      I felt they were not yours--what other way      Than this, not yours?  The secret's wholly mine!       MILDRED.  If you would see me die before his face...       GUENDOLEN.  I'd hold my peace!  And if the Earl returns      To-night?       MILDRED.    Ah Heaven, he's lost!       GUENDOLEN.                         I thought so.  Austin!           Enter AUSTIN      Oh, where have you been hiding?       AUSTIN.                          Thorold's gone,      I know not how, across the meadow-land.      I watched him till I lost him in the skirts      O' the beech-wood.       GUENDOLEN.          Gone?  All thwarts us.       MILDRED.                                    Thorold too?       GUENDOLEN.  I have thought.  First lead this Mildred to her room.      Go on the other side; and then we'll seek      Your brother:  and I'll tell you, by the way,      The greatest comfort in the world.  You said      There was a clue to all.  Remember, Sweet,      He said there was a clue!  I hold it.  Come!     ACT III            SCENE I.--The end of the Yew-tree Avenue under MILDRED'S Window.           A light seen through a central red pane            Enter TRESHAM through the trees       Again here!  But I cannot lose myself.      The heath--the orchard--I have traversed glades      And dells and bosky paths which used to lead      Into green wild-wood depths, bewildering      My boy's adventurous step.  And now they tend      Hither or soon or late; the blackest shade      Breaks up, the thronged trunks of the trees ope wide,      And the dim turret I have fled from, fronts      Again my step; the very river put      Its arm about me and conducted me      To this detested spot.  Why then, I'll shun      Their will no longer:  do your will with me!      Oh, bitter!  To have reared a towering scheme      Of happiness, and to behold it razed,      Were nothing:  all men hope, and see their hopes      Frustrate, and grieve awhile, and hope anew.      But I... to hope that from a line like ours      No horrid prodigy like this would"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2880"],["title","A Blot in the 'Scutcheon (#6)"],["body","pring,      Were just as though I hoped that from these old      Confederates against the sovereign day,      Children of older and yet older sires,      Whose living coral berries dropped, as now      On me, on many a baron's surcoat once,      On many a beauty's whimple--would proceed      No poison-tree, to thrust, from hell its root,      Hither and thither its strange snaky arms.      Why came I here?  What must I do?           [A bell strikes.]                                         A bell?      Midnight! and 'tis at midnight... Ah, I catch      --Woods, river, plains, I catch your meaning now,      And I obey you!  Hist!  This tree will serve.           [He retires behind one of the trees.  After a pause,            enter MERTOUN cloaked as before.]       MERTOUN.  Not time!  Beat out thy last voluptuous beat      Of hope and fear, my heart!  I thought the clock      I' the chapel struck as I was pushing through      The ferns.  And so I shall no more see rise      My love-star!  Oh, no matter for the past!      So much the more delicious task to watch      Mildred revive:  to pluck out, thorn by thorn,      All traces of the rough forbidden path      My rash love lured her to!  Each day must see      Some fear of hers effaced, some hope renewed:      Then there will be surprises, unforeseen      Delights in store.  I'll not regret the past.           [The light is placed above in the purple pane.]      And see, my signal rises, Mildred's star!      I never saw it lovelier than now      It rises for the last time.  If it sets,      'Tis that the re-assuring sun may dawn.           [As he prepares to ascend the last tree of the avenue,            TRESHAM arrests his arm.]      Unhand me--peasant, by your grasp!  Here's gold.      'Twas a mad freak of mine.  I said I'd pluck      A branch from the white-blossomed shrub beneath      The casement there.  Take this, and hold your peace.       TRESHAM.  Into the moonlight yonder, come with me!      Out of the shadow!       MERTOUN.            I am armed, fool!       TRESHAM.                               Yes,      Or no?  You'll come into the light, or no?      My hand is on your throat--refuse!--       MERTOUN.                              That voice!      Where have I heard... no--that was mild and slow.      I'll come with you.           [They advance.]       TRESHAM.             You're armed:  that's well.  Declare      Your name:  who are you?       MERTOUN.                  (Tresham!--she is lost!)       TRESHAM.  Oh, silent?  Do you know, you bear yourself      Exactly as, in curious dreams I've had      How felons, this wild earth is full of, look      When they're detected, still your kind has looked!      The bravo holds an assured countenance,      The thief is voluble and plausible,      But silently the slave of lust has crouched      When I have fancied it before a man.      Your name!       MERTOUN.    I do conjure Lord Tresham--ay,      Kissing his foot, if so I might prevail--      That he for his own sake forbear to ask      My name!  As heaven's above, his future weal      Or woe depends upon my silence!  Vain!      I read your white inexorable face.      Know me, Lord Tresham!           [He throws off his disguises.]       TRESHAM.                Mertoun!           [After a pause.]                                        Draw now!       MERTOUN.                                     Hear me      But speak first!       TRESHAM.          Not one least word on your life!      Be sure that I will strangle in your throat      The least word that informs me how you live      And yet seem what you seem!  No doubt 'twas you      Taught Mildred still to keep that face and sin.      We should join hands in frantic sympathy      If you once taught me the unteachable,      Explained how you can live so and so lie.      With God's help I retain, despite my sense,      The old belief--a life like yours is still      Impossible.  Now draw!       MERTOUN.                Not for my sake,      Do I entreat a hearing--for your sake,      And most, for her sake!       TRESHAM.                 Ha, ha, what should I      Know of your ways?  A miscreant like yourself,      How must one rouse his ire?  A blow?--that's pride      No doubt, to him!  One spurns him, does one not?      Or sets the foot upon his mouth, or spits      Into his face!  Come!  Which, or all of these?       MERTOUN.  'Twixt him and me and Mildred, Heaven be judge!      Can I avoid this?  Have your will, my lord!           [He draws and, after a few passes, falls.]       TRESHAM.  You are not hurt?       MERTOUN.                     You'll hear me now!       TRESHAM.                                          But rise!       MERTOUN.  Ah, Tresham, say I not \"you'll hear me now!\"      And what procures a man the right to speak      In his defence before his fellow man,      But--I suppose--the thought that presently      He may have leave to speak before his God      His whole defence?       TRESHAM.            Not hurt?  It cannot be!      You made no effort to resist me.  Where      Did my sword reach you?  Why not have returned      My thrusts?  Hurt where?       MERTOUN.  My lord--       TRESHAM.             How young he is!       MERTOUN.  Lord Tresham, I am very young, and yet      I have entangled other lives with mine.      Do let me speak, and do believe my speech!      That when I die before you presently,--       TRESHAM.  Can you stay here till I return with help?       MERTOUN.  Oh, stay by me!  When I was less than boy      I did you grievous wrong and knew it not--      Upon my honour, knew it not!  Once known,      I could not find what seemed a better way      To right you than I took:  my life--you feel      How less than nothing were the giving you      The life you've taken!  But I thought my way      The better--only for your sake and hers:      And as you have decided otherwise,      Would I had an infinity of lives      To offer you!  Now say--instruct me--think!      Can you, from the brief minutes I have left,      Eke out my reparation?  Oh think--think!      For I must wring a partial--dare I say,      Forgiveness from you, ere I die?       TRESHAM.                          I do      Forgive you.       MERTOUN.      Wait and ponder that great word!      Because, if you forgive me, I shall hope      To speak to you of--Mildred!       TRESHAM.                      Mertoun, haste      And anger have undone us.  'Tis not you      Should tell me for a novelty you're young,      Thoughtless, unable to recall the past.      Be but your pardon ample as my own!       MERTOUN.  Ah, Tresham, that a sword-stroke and a drop      Of blood or two, should bring all this about      Why, 'twas my very fear of you, my love      Of you--(what passion like a boy's for one      Like you?)--that ruined me!  I dreamed of you--      You, all accomplished, courted everywhere,      The scholar and the gentleman.  I burned      To knit myself to you:  but I was young,      And your surpassing reputation kept me      So far aloof!  Oh, wherefore all that love?      With less of love, my glorious yesterday      Of praise and gentlest words and kindest looks,      Had taken place perchance six months ago.      Even now, how happy we had been!  And yet      I know the thought of this escaped you, Tresham!      Let me look up into your face; I feel      'Tis changed above me:  yet my eyes are glazed.      Where? where?           [As he endeavours to raise himself, his eye catches the lamp.]                     Ah, Mildred!  What will Mildred do?      Tresham, her life is bound up in the life      That's bleeding fast away!  I'll live--must live,      There, if you'll only turn me I shall live      And save her!  Tresham--oh, had you but heard!      Had you but heard!  What right was yours to set      The thoughtless foot upon her life and mine,      And then say, as we perish, \"Had I thought,      All had gone otherwise\"?  We've sinned and die:      Never you sin, Lord Tresham! for you'll die,      And God will judge you.       TRESHAM.                 Yes, be satisfied!      That process is begun.       MERTOUN.                And she sits there      Waiting for me!  Now, say you this to her--      You, not another--say, I saw him die      As he breathed this, \"I love her\"--you don't know      What those three small words mean!  Say, loving her      Lowers me down the bloody slope to death      With memories... I speak to her, not you,      Who had no pity, will have no remorse,      Perchance intend her... Die along with me,      Dear Mildred! 'tis so easy, and you'll 'scape      So much unkindness!  Can I lie at rest,      With rude speech spoken to you, ruder deeds      Done to you?--heartless men shall have my heart,      And I tied down with grave-clothes and the worm,      Aware, perhaps, of every blow--oh God!--      Upon those lips--yet of no power to tear      The felon stripe by stripe!  Die, Mildred!  Leave      Their honourable world to them!  For God      We're good enough, though the world casts us out.           [A whistle is heard.]       TRESHAM.  Ho, Gerard!           Enter GERARD, AUSTIN and GUENDOLEN, with lights                             No one speak!  You see what's done.      I cannot bear another voice.       MERTOUN.                      There's light--      Light all about me, and I move to it.      Tresham, did I not tell you--did you not      Just promise to deliver words of mine      To Mildred?       TRESHAM.     I will bear those words to her.       MERTOUN.  Now?       TRESHAM.        Now.  Lift you the body, and leave me      The head.           [As they have half raised MERTOUN, he turns suddenly.]       MERTOUN.  I knew they turned me:  turn me not from her!      There! stay you! there!           [Dies.]       GUENDOLEN [after a pause].  Austin, remain you here      With Thorold until Gerard comes with help:      Then lead him to his chamber.  I must go      To"]]]
