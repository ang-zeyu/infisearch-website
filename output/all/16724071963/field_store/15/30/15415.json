Or, on the other hand, conditions remaining the same, let a given organism vary (and no one doubts that they do vary) in two directions: into one form (a) better fitted to cope with these conditions than the original stock, and a second (b) less well adapted to them. Then it is no less certain that the conditions in question must exercise a selective influence in favour of (a) and against ( b), so that (a) will tend to predominance, and (b) to extirpation.  That M. Flourens should be unable to perceive the logical necessity of these simple arguments, which lie at the foundation of all Mr. Darwin's reasoning; that he should confound an irrefragable deduction from the observed relations of organisms to the conditions which lie around them, with a metaphysical \"forme substantielle,\" or a chimerical personification of the powers of Nature, would be incredible, were it not that other passages of his work leave no room for doubt upon the subject.  \"On imagine une 'election naturelle' que, pour plus de menagement, on me dit etre inconsciente, sans s'apercevoir que le contre-sens litteral est precisement la: 'election inconsciente'.\" (P. 52.)  \"J'ai deja dit ce qu'il faut penser de 'l'election naturelle'. Ou 'l'election naturelle' n'est rien, ou c'est la nature: mais la nature douee 'd'election', mais la nature personnifiee: derniere erreur du dernier siecle: Le xixe fait plus de personnifications.\" (P. 53.)  M. Flourens cannot imagine an unconscious selection--it is for him a contradiction in terms. Did M. Flourens ever visit one of the prettiest watering-places of \"la belle France,\" the Baie d'Arcachon? If so, he will probably have passed through the district of the Landes, and will have had an opportunity of observing the formation of \"dunes\" on a grand scale. What are these \"dunes\"? The winds and waves of the Bay of Biscay have not much consciousness, and yet they have with great care \"selected,\" from among an infinity of masses of silex of all shapes and sizes, which have been submitted to their action, all the grains of sand below a certain size, and have heaped them by themselves over a great area. This sand has been \"unconsciously selected\" from amidst the gravel in which it first lay with as much precision as if man had \"consciously selected\" it by the aid of a sieve. Physical Geology is full of such selections--of the picking out of the soft from the hard, of the soluble from the insoluble, of the fusible from the infusible, by natural agencies to which we are certainly not in the habit of ascribing consciousness.  But that which wind and sea are to a sandy beach, the sum of influences, which we term the \"conditions of existence,\" is to living organisms. The weak are sifted out from the strong. A frosty night \"selects\" the hardy plants in a plantation from among the tender ones as effectually as if it were the wind, and they, the sand and pebbles, of our illustration; or, on the other hand, as if the intelligence of a gardener had been operative in cutting the weaker organisms down. The thistle, which has spread over the Pampas, to the destruction of native plants, has been more effectually \"selected\" by the unconscious operation of natural conditions than if a thousand agriculturists had spent their time in sowing it.  It is one of Mr. Darwin's many great services to Biological science that he has demonstrated the significance of these facts. He has shown that--given variation and given change of conditions--the inevitable result is the exercise of such an influence upon organisms that one is helped and another is impeded; one tends to predominate, another to disappear; and thus the living world bears within itself, and is surrounded by, impulses towards incessant change.  But the truths just stated are as certain as any other physical laws, quite independently of the truth, or falsehood, of the hypothesis which Mr. Darwin has based upon them; and that M. Flourens, missing the substance and grasping at a shadow, should be blind to the admirable exposition of them, which Mr. Darwin has given, and see nothing there but a \"derniere erreur du dernier siecle \"--a personification of Nature--leads us indeed to cry with him: \"O lucidite! O solidite de l'esprit Francais, que devenez-vous?\"  M. Flourens has, in fact, utterly failed to comprehend the first principles of the doctrine which he assails so rudely. His objections to details are of the old sort, so battered and hackneyed on this side of the Channel, that not even a Quarterly Reviewer could be induced to pick them up for the purpose of pelting Mr. Darwin over again. We have Cuvier and the mummies; M. Roulin and the domesticated animals of America; the difficulties presented by hybridism and by Palaeontology; Darwinism a 'rifacciamento' of De Maillet and Lamarck; Darwinism a system without a commencement, and its author bound to believe in M. Pouchet, etc. etc. How one knows it all by heart, and with what relief one reads at p. 65--  \"Je laisse M. Darwin!\"  But we cannot leave M. Flourens without calling our readers' attention to his wonderful tenth chapter, \"De la Preexistence des Germes et de l'Epigenese,\" which opens thus:--  \"Spontaneous generation is only a chimaera. This point established, two hypotheses remain: that of 'pre-existence' and that of 'epigenesis'. The one of these hypotheses has as little foundation as the other.\" (P. 163.)  \"The doctrine of 'epigenesis' is derived from Harvey: following by ocular inspection the development of the new being in the Windsor does, he saw each part appear successively, and taking the moment of 'appearance' for the moment of 'formation' he imagined 'epigenesis'.\" (P. 165.)  On the contrary, says M. Flourens (p. 167),  \"The new being is formed at a stroke ('tout d'un coup') as a whole, instantaneously; it is not formed part by part, and at different times. It is formed at once at the single 'individual' moment at which the conjunction of the male and female elements takes place.\"  It will be observed that M. Flourens uses language which cannot be mistaken. For him, the labours of von Baer, of Rathke, of Coste, and their contemporaries and successors in Germany, France, and England, are non-existent: and, as Darwin \"imagina\" natural selection, so Harvey \"imagina\" that doctrine which gives him an even greater claim to the veneration of posterity than his better known discovery of the circulation of the blood.  Language such as that we have quoted is, in fact, so preposterous, so utterly incompatible with anything but absolute ignorance of some of the best established facts, that we should have passed it over in silence had it not appeared to afford some clue to M. Flourens' unhesitating, 'a priori', repudiation of all forms of the doctrine of progressive modification of living beings. He whose mind remains uninfluenced by an acquaintance with the phenomena of development, must indeed lack one of the chief motives towards the endeavour to trace a genetic relation between the different existing forms of life. Those who are ignorant of Geology, find no difficulty in believing that the world was made as it is; and the shepherd, untutored in history, sees no reason to regard the green mounds which indicate the site of a Roman camp, as aught but part and parcel of the primeval hill-side. So M. Flourens, who believes that embryos are formed \"tout d'un coup,\" naturally finds no difficulty in conceiving that species came into existence in the same way.

CHAPTER I.                        RODNEY KEEPS HIS PROMISE.  \"So you are going to stick to your uniform, are you? I thought perhaps you would be glad to see yourself in citizen's clothes once more, and so I told Jane to put one of your old suits on the bed where you would be sure to see it.\"  It was Mrs. Gray who spoke, and her words were addressed to her son Rodney, who just then stepped out of the hall upon the wide gallery where his father and mother were sitting. Rodney had been at home about half an hour just long enough, in fact, to take a good wash and exchange his fatigue suit for a sergeant's full uniform.  In the first volume of this series of books we told of the attentions our Union hero, Marcy Gray, received while he was on the way to his home in North Carolina, and how very distasteful and annoying they were to him. We said that the passengers on his train took him for just what he wasn't--a rebel soldier fresh from the seat of war, or a recruit on his way to join some Southern regiment--and praised and petted him accordingly. Marcy didn't dare tell the excited men around him that he was strong for the Union, that he had refused to cheer the Stars and Bars when they were hoisted on the tower of the Barrington Military Academy, and that if a war came he hoped the secessionists would be thrashed until they were brought to their senses--Marcy did not dare give utterance to these sentiments, for fear that some of the half tipsy passengers in his car might use upon him the revolvers they flourished about so recklessly. He was obliged to sail under false colors until he reached Boydtown in his native State, where Morris, his mother's coachman, was waiting for him. Rodney Gray, the rebel, who you will remember left the academy a few weeks before Marcy did, received just as much attention during his homeward journey. Sumter had not yet been fired upon, but the passengers on the train were pretty certain it was going to be, and gave it as their opinion that if the \"Lincolnites\" attempted \"subjugation\" they would be neatly whipped for their pains. Being in full sympathy with the passengers Rodney was not afraid to tell who and what he was.  \"I am neither a soldier nor a recruit,\" he said over and over again, when some enthusiastic rebel shook him by the hand and praised him for so promptly responding to the President's call for volunteers. \"I am a Barrington cadet on my way home, and I am under promise to enlist inside of twenty-four hours after I get there. Do you see this gray suit? I shall not wear any other color until the independence of the Southern States has been acknowledged by the world.\"  Such sentiments as these never failed to \"bring down the car,\" as Rodney afterward expressed it when describing some of the incidents of his journey from Barrington, and many of the passengers assured him that he would be at liberty to put on a citizen's suit in less than six months.  \"The fighting won't amount to anything,\" said one, who talked as if he thought himself able to whip the whole Yankee nation alone and unaided. \"It will be over in a good deal less than six months, but you gallant fellows will have to wear your uniforms a little longer in order to escort President Davis to Washington. He will dictate terms of peace in the enemy's capital.\"  \"If our President will only do that, I will stay in the army ten years if it is necessary,\" declared Rodney, and he meant every word of it, for he was carried away by his enthusiasm.  A good many foolish notions of this sort were drummed into Rodney Gray's head during his two days' journey from Barrington to Mooreville. He afterward had occasion to recall some of them, and to wonder how he ever came to accept them as the truth. But he kept his word so far as his uniform was concerned; that is to say, he returned to the closet the citizen's suit that had been laid out for him, and rigged himself up as if he were going on dress parade. His mother looked at him with fond and admiring eyes as he stepped upon the gallery and seated himself in the easy chair that one of the attentive darkies placed for him; for Rodney was an only child, and a very fine looking young soldier besides.  \"Yes,\" he said, in reply to his mother's question. \"I am going to stick to my uniform. It is the color that has been adopted by our government, and, as I told some of the passengers on the train, I'll not wear any other until we have secured our independence.\"  \"Nobly said!\" exclaimed Rodney's mother, who was as strong for secession as Marcy Gray's mother was for the Union. \"I was sure you would not stay at home very long after your State called for your services. I don't think you will have to wear the gray for a very great while, but your father thinks he sees trouble in the near future.\"  \"I don't think so my dear; I know so,\" replied Mr. Gray, in answer to an inquiring look from Rodney. \"The North can raise more men than we can.\"  \"That was what the colonel said when I asked him to let me come home,\" exclaimed Rodney. \"He said, further, that the Northern people are not cowardly--they are only patient; and that there will come a time when their patience will all be gone, and then they will sweep over us like a cloud of locusts.\"  \"And did you believe any such nonsense?\" inquired Mrs. Gray. \"What will our brave people be doing while the hated Yankees are sweeping over us? Don't you remember our President said the fighting must all be done on Northern soil?\"  \"It takes two to make a bargain,\" said Mr. Gray, quietly.  \"That's just what Marcy said,\" exclaimed Rodney. \"That boy is going to get himself into business before he gets through talking. He's Union to the back-bone, and while I was at the academy he didn't hesitate to speak his sentiments as often as he felt like it. If he keeps that up when he gets home his neighbors may take him in hand.\"  \"I am sorry to hear that about Marcy,\" said Mr. Gray, thoughtfully. \"He is a traitor and his mother must be another. I wonder where Sailor Jack stands. By the way, where is Jack?\"  \"He was at sea the last I heard, and I suppose Marcy and his mother are greatly worried about him. And well they may be; for of course we'll have a big fleet of privateers afloat within a month after war is declared. But, father, do you think there is going to be a war?\"  \"I am sure of it,\" answered Mr. Gray.  \"And it will be fought on Southern soil?\"  \"It will.\"  \"Well, how long do you think I shall have to wear this uniform?\"  \"If you don't take it off until the South gains her independence, you will have to wear it as long as you live.\"  \"Why, father!\" exclaimed Mrs. Gray, dropping her sewing into her lap and looking fixedly at her husband, who leaned back in his big chair watching the smoke from his cigar. \"How can you bring yourself to utter such treasonable language in your son's hearing? You know you do not believe a word of it.\"  \"Never fear for me, mother,\" said Rodney, with a laugh. \"I know where you stand and I am with you.\"  \"There was nothing treasonable in what I said, and I do believe every word of it,\" replied Mr. Gray. \"I am as firm a friend to the South as any man in the state, and will make as many sacrifices as the next one to secure her independence. Why shouldn't I? Every thing I've got in the world is right here, and if the South doesn't succeed in her efforts to free herself, we'll be beggars, the last one of us. I wish from the bottom of my heart that when our armies get started they might sweep every abolitionist in the country into Massachusetts Bay; but they'll not be able to do it. The Union has cost the Northern people so much blood and treasure that they will not permit it to be destroyed.\"  \"I reckon the South had about as much to do with the war of the Revolution as the North did,\" declared Rodney.  \"And another thing, the Northern people will not fight,\" Mrs. Gray hastened to add. \"Wasn't it the South that did the most toward whipping Mexico?\"  \"And wasn't it the North that did the most toward whipping England?\" retorted Mr. Gray. \"Look here,\" he added, starting up in his chair when he saw Rodney and his mother look toward each other with a smile of disbelief on their faces. \"You must have forgotten your history, you two.
