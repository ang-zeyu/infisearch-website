So a second vault above the vault of the firmament closes in, together with the firmament, a space where are the storehouses of rain, hail, and snow.\"[43:1] There seems to be nowhere in Scripture the slightest hint or suggestion of any such second vault; certainly not in the beautiful passage to which Prof. Schiaparelli is here referring.       \"Where is the way to the dwelling of light,       And as for darkness, where is the place thereof;       That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,       And that thou shouldst discern the paths to the house thereof.              *       *       *       *       *        Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow,       Or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,       Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,       Against the day of battle and war?       By what way is the light parted,       Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?       Who hath cleft a channel for the water-flood,       Or a way for the lightning of the thunder;             *       *       *       *       *                  Hath the rain a father?       Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?       Out of whose womb came the ice?       And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?\"  The Song of David, Psalm xviii., clearly shows that its writer held no fantasy of a solidly built cistern of waters in the sky, but thought of the \"dark waters\" in the heavens, as identical with the \"thick clouds.\" The passage is worth quoting at some length, not merely as supplying a magnificent word picture of a storm, but as showing the free and courageous spirit of the Hebrew poet, a spirit more emancipated than can be found in any other nation of antiquity. It was not only the gentler aspect of nature that attracted him; even for its most terrible, he had a sympathy, rising, under the influence of his strong faith in God, into positive exultation in it.       \"In my distress I called upon the Lord,       And cried unto my God:       He heard my voice out of His temple,       And my cry before Him came into His ears.       Then the earth shook and trembled,       The foundations also of the mountains moved       And were shaken, because He was wroth.       There went up a smoke out of His nostrils,       And fire out of His mouth devoured:       Coals were kindled by it.       He bowed the heavens also, and came down;       And thick darkness was under His feet.       And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly:       Yea, He flew swiftly upon the wings of the wind.       He made darkness His hiding place,       His pavilion round about Him;       Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.       At the brightness before Him His thick clouds passed,       Hailstones and coals of fire.       The Lord also thundered in the heavens,       And the Most High uttered His voice;       Hailstones and coals of fire.       And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them;       Yea lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.       Then the channels of waters appeared,       And the foundations of the world were laid bare,       At Thy rebuke, O Lord,       At the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils.       He sent from on high, He took me;       He drew me out of many waters.       He delivered me from my strong enemy,       And from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.\"  Two other passages point to the circulation of water vapour upward from the earth before its descent as rain; one in the prophecy of Jeremiah, the other, almost identical with it, in Psalm cxxxv. 7: \"When He uttereth His voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries.\" Here we get a hint of a close observing of nature among the Hebrews. For by the foreshortening that clouds undergo in the distance, they inevitably appear to form chiefly on the horizon, \"at the ends of the earth,\" whence they move upwards towards the zenith.  A further reference to clouds reveals not observation only but acute reflection, though it leaves the mystery without solution. \"Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of Him Which is perfect in knowledge?\" There is a deep mystery here, which science is far from having completely solved, how it is that the clouds float, each in its own place, at its own level; each perfectly \"balanced\" in the thin air.       \"That mist which lies in the morning so softly in the valley,      level and white, through which the tops of the trees rise as      if through an inundation--why is _it_ so heavy? and why does      it lie so low, being yet so thin and frail that it will melt      away utterly into splendour of morning, when the sun has shone      on it but a few moments more? Those colossal pyramids, huge      and firm, with outlines as of rocks, and strength to bear the      beating of the high sun full on their fiery flanks--why are      _they_ so light--their bases high over our heads, high over      the heads of Alps? why will these melt away, not as the sun      rises, but as he descends, and leave the stars of twilight      clear, while the valley vapour gains again upon the earth like      a shroud?\"[46:1]  The fact of the \"balancing\" has been brought home to us during the past hundred years very vividly by the progress of aërial navigation. Balloons are objects too familiar even to our children to cause them any surprise, and every one knows how instantly a balloon, when in the air, rises up higher if a few pounds of ballast are thrown out, or sinks if a little of the gas is allowed to escape. We know of no balancing more delicate than this, of a body floating in the air.  [Illustration: CIRRUS FROM SOUTH KENSINGTON, 1906, MAY 29.]  [Illustration: CUMULI FROM TUNBRIDGE WELLS, 1906, MAY 20.  (Photographs of clouds, taken by Dr. W. J. S. Lockyer.)  \"Dost thou know the balancing of the clouds?\"]  \"The spreadings of the clouds,\" mentioned by Elihu are of the same nature as their \"balancings,\" but the expression is less remarkable. The \"spreading\" is a thing manifest to all, but it required the mind both of a poet and a man of science to appreciate that such spreading involved a delicate poising of each cloud in its place.  The heavy rain which fell at the time of the Deluge is indeed spoken of as if it were water let out of a reservoir by its floodgates,--\"the windows of heaven were opened;\" but it seems to show some dulness on the part of an objector to argue that this expression involves the idea of a literal stone built reservoir with its sluices. Those who have actually seen tropical rain in full violence will find the Scriptural phrase not merely appropriate but almost inevitable. The rain does indeed fall like hitherto pent-up waters rushing forth at the opening of a sluice, and it seems unreasonable to try to place too literal an interpretation upon so suitable a simile.  There is the less reason to insist upon this very matter-of-fact rendering of the \"windows of heaven,\" that in two out of the three connections in which it occurs, the expression is certainly used metaphorically. On the occasion of the famine in the city of Samaria, Elisha prophesied that--       \"To-morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be      sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in      the gate of Samaria. Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned      answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the Lord would      make windows in heaven, might this thing be?\"  So again Malachi exhorted the Jews after the Return from Babylon:--       \"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may      be meat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the      Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven,      and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room      enough to receive it.\"  In neither case can the \"windows of heaven\" have been meant by the speaker to convey the idea of the sluice-gates of an actual, solidly-built reservoir in the sky.  One other cloud fact--their dissipation as the sun rises high in the heavens--is noticed in one of the most tender and pathetic passages in all the prophetic Scriptures. The Lord, by the mouth of Hosea, is mourning over the instability of His people. \"O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? For your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.\"  The winds of heaven were considered as four in number, corresponding to our own four \"cardinal points.\" Thus the great horn of Daniel's he-goat was broken and succeeded by four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven; as the empire of Alexander the Great was divided amongst his four generals. In Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones the prophet prays, \"Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain;\" and Jeremiah foretells that \"the four winds from the four quarters of heaven\" shall be brought upon Elam, and scatter its outcasts into every nation.  The circulation of the winds is clearly set forth by the Preacher in the Book of Ecclesiastes.       \"The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the      north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth      again according to his circuits.\"  Of the four quarters, the Hebrews reckoned the east as first. It was to the east that they supposed themselves always looking. The chief word for east, therefore, _kedem_, means \"that which is before,\" \"the front\"; and the word next in use is, naturally, _mizrach_, the rising of the sun. The west is, as naturally, _mebō hasshemesh_, the going down of the sun; but as the Mediterranean Sea lay to the westward of Palestine \"the sea\" (_yam_) is frequently put instead of that point of the compass. With the east in front, the south becomes the right, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28540"],["title","Bibliomania; or Book-Madness (#0)"],["body","(https://www.pgdp.net)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

[Illustration]  ADVERTISEMENT.   _The public may not be altogether unprepared for the re-appearance of the BIBLIOMANIA in a more attractive garb than heretofore;--and, in consequence, more in uniformity with the previous publications of the Author._  _More than thirty years have elapsed since the last edition; an edition, which has become so scarce that there seemed to be no reasonable objection why the possessors of the_ other _works of the Author should be deprived of an opportunity of adding the_ present _to the number: and although this re-impression may, on first glance, appear something like a violation of contract with the public, yet, when the length of time which has elapsed, and the smallness of the price of the preceding impression, be considered, there does not appear to be any very serious obstacle to the present republication; the more so, as the number of copies is limited to five hundred._  _Another consideration deeply impressed itself upon the mind of the Author. The course of thirty years has necessarily brought changes and alterations amongst \"men and things.\" The dart of death has been so busy during this period that, of the Bibliomaniacs so plentifully recorded in the previous work, scarcely_ three,_--including the Author--have survived. This has furnished a monitory theme for the APPENDIX; which, to the friends both of the dead and the living, cannot be perused without sympathising emotions--_       _\"A sigh the absent claim, the DEAD a tear.\"_  _The changes and alterations in \"things,\"--that is to say in the_ =Bibliomania= _itself--have been equally capricious and unaccountable: our countrymen being, in_ these _days, to the full as fond of novelty and variety as in those of Henry the Eighth. Dr. Board, who wrote his_ Introduction of Knowledge _in the year 1542, and dedicated it to the Princess Mary, thus observes of our countrymen:_       _I am an Englishman, and naked do I stand here,      Musing in my mind what raiment I shall wear;      For now I will wear_ this, _and now I will wear_ that,      _Now I will wear--I cannot tell what._  _This highly curious and illustrative work was reprinted, with all its wood-cut embellishments, by Mr. Upcott. A copy of the original and most scarce edition is among the Selden books in the Bodleian library, and in the Chetham Collection at Manchester. See the_ Typographical Antiquities, _vol._ iii. _p._ 158-60.  _But I apprehend the general apathy of Bibliomaniacs to be in a great measure attributable to the vast influx of BOOKS, of every description, from the Continent--owing to the long continuance of peace; and yet, in the appearance of what are called_ English Rarities, _the market seems to be almost as barren as ever. The wounds, inflicted in the HEBERIAN contest, have gradually healed, and are subsiding into forgetfulness; excepting where, from_ collateral _causes, there are too many_ striking _reasons to remember their existence._  _Another motive may be humbly, yet confidently, assigned for the re-appearance of this Work. It was thought, by its late proprietor,--MR. EDWARD WALMSLEY[1]--to whose cost and liberality this edition owes its appearance--to be a volume, in itself, of pleasant and profitable perusal; composed perhaps in a quaint and original style, but in accordance with the characters of the_ Dramatis Personæ. _Be this as it may, it is a work divested of all acrimonious feeling--is applicable to all classes of society, to whom harmless enthusiasm cannot be offensive--and is based upon a foundation not likely to be speedily undermined._  _T.F. DIBDIN._  _May_ 1, 1842.       [Footnote 1: _Mr. EDWARD WALMSLEY, who died in 1841, at an      advanced age, had been long known to me. He had latterly      extensive calico-printing works at Mitcham, and devoted much      of his time to the production of beautiful patterns in that      fabrication; his taste, in almost every thing which he      undertook, leant towards the fine arts. His body was in the      counting-house; but his spirit was abroad, in the studio of      the painter or engraver. Had his natural talents, which were      strong and elastic, been cultivated in early life, he would,      in all probability, have attained a considerable reputation.      How he loved to embellish--almost to satiety--a favourite      work, may be seen by consulting a subsequent page towards      the end of this volume. He planned and published the_      Physiognomical Portraits, _a performance not divested of      interest--but failing in general success, from the prints      being, in many instances, a repetition of their precursors.      The thought, however, was a good one; and many of the heads      are powerfully executed. He took also a lively interest in      Mr. Major's splendid edition of Walpole's_ Anecdotes of      Painting in England, _a work, which can never want a reader      while taste has an abiding-place in one British bosom._       _Mr. Walmsley possessed a brave and generous spirit; and I      scarcely knew a man more disposed to bury the remembrance of      men's errors in that of their attainments and good      qualities._]     THE BIBLIOMANIA;  OR  =Book-Madness;=  CONTAINING SOME ACCOUNT OF THE  HISTORY, SYMPTOMS, AND CURE OF THIS FATAL DISEASE.
