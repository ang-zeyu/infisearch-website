You know the French have possessions all  along that coast and they won’t be sorry to find an opportunity of  stretching out their hand a little further. Our difficulties as to capital are  at an end, for a full third of it is guaranteed in Paris, and I expect that  small investors and speculators for the rise will gobble a lot more. We shall  plant £10,000,000 worth of Sahara scrip in sunny France, my boy, and foggy  England has underwritten the rest. It will be a case of ‘letters of  allotment and regret,’ _and_ regret, Alan, financially the most  successful issue of the last dozen years. What do you say to that?” and  in his elation the little man puffed out his chest and pursing up his lips,  blew through them, making a sound like that of wind among wires.    “I don’t know, Mr. Haswell. If we are all alive I would prefer to answer the question twelve months hence, or later, when we see whether the  company is going to be a practical success as well, or not.”  Again Mr. Haswell made the sound of wind among wires, only this time there was  a shriller note in it; its mellowness was gone, it was as though the air had  suddenly been filled with frost.  “A practical success!” he repeated after him. “That is scarcely our affair, is it? Promoters should not bother themselves with long  views, Alan. These may be left to the investing public, the speculative parson  and the maiden lady who likes a flutter—those props of modern enterprise.  But what do you mean? You originated this idea and always said that the profits  should be great.”  “Yes, Mr. Haswell, on a moderate capitalization and provided that we are sure of the co-operation of the Porte.”  Mr. Haswell looked at him very searchingly and Sir Robert, who had been listening, said in his cold voice:  “I think that we thrashed out these points long ago, and to tell you the truth I am rather tired of them, especially as it is too late to change anything. How did you get on with Jackson, Vernon?”  “I did not get on at all, Sir Robert. He will not touch the thing on any terms, and indeed means to oppose it tooth and nail.”  “Then he will find himself in a minority when the articles come out to-morrow. Of course it is a bore, but we are strong enough to snap our fingers  at him. You see they don’t read _The Judge_ in France, and no one  has ever heard of it in Constantinople. Therefore we have nothing to  fear—so long as we stick together,” he added meaningly.  Alan felt that the crisis had come. He must speak now or for ever hold his  peace; indeed Aylward was already looking round for his hat.  “Sir Robert and Mr. Haswell,” he broke in rather nervously, “I have something to say to you, something unpleasant,” and he paused.  “Then please say it at once, Vernon. I want to dress for dinner, I am going to the theatre to-night and must dine early,” replied Aylward in a voice of the utmost unconcern.  “It is, Sir Robert,” went on Alan with a rush, “that I do not like the lines upon which this business is being worked, and I wish to give up  my interest in it and retire from the firm, as I have a right to do under our  deed of partnership.”  “Have you?” said Aylward. “Really, I forget. But, my dear fellow, do not think that we should wish to keep you for one moment against  your will. Only, might I ask, has that old puritan, Jackson, hypnotized you, or  is it a case of sudden madness after influenza?”  “Neither,” answered Alan sternly, for although he might be diffident on matters that he did not thoroughly understand, he was not a man to  brook trifling or impertinence. “It is what I have said, no more nor  less. I am not satisfied either as to the capitalization or as to the guarantee  that the enterprise can be really carried out. Further”—and he  paused,—“Further, I should like what I have never yet been able to  obtain, more information as to that Firman under which the concession is  granted.”  For one moment a sort of tremor passed over Sir Robert’s impassive countenance, while Mr. Haswell uttered his windy whistle, this time in a tone  of plaintive remonstrance.  “As you have formally resigned your membership of the firm, I do not see that any useful purpose can be served by discussing such matters. The fullest  explanations, of course, we should have been willing to give——”  “My dear Alan,” broke in Mr. Champers-Haswell, who was quite upset, “I do implore you to reflect for one moment, for your own sake. In a single week you would have been a wealthy man; do you really mean to throw away  everything for a whim?”  “Perhaps Vernon remembers that he holds over 1700 of the Syndicate shares  which we have worked up to £18, and thinks it wiser to capture the profit in  sight, generally speaking a very sound principle,” interrupted Aylward  sarcastically.  “You are mistaken, Sir Robert,” replied Alan, flushing. “The way that those shares have been artificially put up is one of the things to  which I most object. I shall only ask for mine the face value which I paid for  them.”  Now notwithstanding their experience, both of the senior partners did for a  moment look rather scared. Such folly, or such honesty, was absolutely  incredible to them. They felt that there must be much behind. Sir Robert,  however, recovered instantly.  “Very well,” he said; “it is not for us to dictate to you; you must make your own bed and lie on it. To argue or remonstrate would only be  rude.” He put out his hand and pushed the button of an electric bell,  adding as he did so, “Of course we understand one thing, Vernon, namely,  that as a gentleman and a man of honour you will make no public use of the  information which you have acquired during your stay in this office, either to  our detriment, personal or financial, or to your own advantage.”    “Certainly you may understand that,” replied Vernon. “Unless my character is attacked and it becomes necessary for me to defend myself, my  lips are sealed.”  “That will never happen—why should it?” said Sir Robert with a polite bow.  The door opened and the head clerk, Jeffreys, appeared.  “Mr. Jeffreys,” said Sir Robert, “please find us the deed of partnership between Major Vernon and ourselves, and bring it here. One moment.  Please make out also a transfer of Major Vernon’s parcel of Sahara  Syndicate shares to Mr. Champers-Haswell and myself at par value, and fill in a  cheque for the amount. Please remove also Major Vernon’s name wherever it  appears in the proof prospectus, and—yes—one thing more. Telephone  to Specton—the Right Honourable the Earl of Specton, I mean, and say that  after all I have been able to arrange that he shall have a seat on the Board  and a block of shares at a very moderate figure, and that if he will wire his  assent, his name shall be put into the prospectus. You approve, don’t  you, Haswell?—yes—then that is all, I think, Jeffreys, only please  be as quick as you can, for I want to get away.”    Jeffreys, the immaculate and the impassive, bowed, and casting one swift glance  at Vernon out of the corner of his eye, departed.  What is called an awkward pause ensued; in fact it was a very awkward pause.  The die was cast, the matter ended, and what were the principals to do until  the ratifications had been exchanged or, a better simile perhaps, the _decree  nisi_ pronounced absolute. Mr. Champers-Haswell remarked that the weather  was very cold for April, and Alan agreed with him, while Sir Robert found his  hat and brushed it with his sleeve. Then Mr. Haswell, in desperation, for in  minor matters he was a kindly sort of man who disliked scenes and  unpleasantness, muttered something as to seeing him—Alan—at his  house, “The Court,” in Hertfordshire, from Saturday to Monday.    “That was the arrangement,” answered Alan bluntly, “but possibly after what has happened you will not wish that it should be kept.”  “Oh! why not, why not?” said Mr. Haswell. “Sunday is a day of rest when we make it a rule not to talk business, and if we did, perhaps we  might all change our minds about these matters. Sir Robert is coming, and I am  sure that your cousin Barbara will be very disappointed if you do not turn up,  for she understands nothing about these city things which are Greek to  her.”  At the mention of the name of Barbara Sir Robert Aylward looked up from the  papers which he affected to be tidying, and Alan thought that there was a kind  of challenge in his eyes. A moment before he had made up his mind that no power  on earth would induce him to spend a Sunday with his late partners at The  Court. Now, acting upon some instinct or impulse, he reversed his opinion.    “Thanks,” he said, “if that is understood, I shall be happy to come. I will drive over from Yarleys in time for dinner to-morrow. Perhaps  you will say so to Barbara.”  “She will be glad, I am sure,” answered Mr. Haswell, “for she told me the other day that she wants to consult you about some outdoor theatricals that she means to get up in July.”  “In July!” answered Alan with a little laugh. “I wonder where I shall be in July.”  Then came another pause, which seemed to affect even Sir Robert’s nerves,  for, abandoning the papers, he walked down the room till he came to the golden  object that has been described, and for the second time that day stood there  contemplating it.  “This thing is yours, Vernon,” he said, “and now that our relations are at an end, I suppose that you will want to take it away. What is  its history? You never told me.”  “Oh! that’s a long story,” answered Alan in an absent voice. “My uncle, who was a missionary, brought it from West Africa. I rather forget the facts, but Jeekie, my negro servant, knows them all, for as a lad my  uncle"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2857"],["title","A Yellow God: An Idol of Africa (#4)"],["body","him from sacrifice, or something, in a place where they worship  these things, and he has been with us ever since. It is a fetish with magical  powers and all the rest of it. I believe they call it the Swimming Head and  other names. If you look at it, you will see that it seems to swim between the  shoulders, doesn’t it?”  “Yes,” said Sir Robert, “and I admire the beautiful beast. She is cruel and artistic, like—like finance. Look here, Vernon, we have quarrelled, and of course henceforth are enemies, for it is no use mincing  matters, only fools do that. But in a way you are being hardly treated. You  could get £10 apiece to-day for those shares of yours in a block on the market,  and I am paying you £1. I understand your scruples, but there is no reason why  we should not square things. This fetish of yours has brought me luck, so  let’s do a deal. Leave it here, and instead of a check for £1700, I will  make you one out for £17,000.”  “That’s a very liberal offer,” said Vernon. “Give me a moment to think it over.”  Then he also walked into the corner of the room and contemplated the golden  mask that seemed to float between the frog-like shoulders. The shimmering eyes  drew his eyes, though what he saw in them does not matter. Indeed he could  never remember. Only when he straightened himself again there was left on his  mind a determination that not for seventeen or for seventy thousand pounds  would he part with his ownership in this very unique fetish.    “No, thank you,” he said presently. “I don’t think I will sell the Yellow God, as Jeekie calls it. Perhaps you will kindly keep her  here for a week or so, until I make up my mind where to stow her.”    Again Mr. Champers-Haswell uttered his windy whistle. That a man should refuse  £17,000 for a bit of African gold worth £100 or so, struck him as miraculous.  But Sir Robert did not seem in the least surprised, only very disappointed.    “I quite understand your dislike to selling,” he said. “Thank you for leaving it here for the present to see us through the flotation,”  and he laughed.  At that moment Jeffreys entered the room with the documents. Sir Robert handed  the deed of partnership to Alan, and when he had identified it, took it from  him again and threw it on the fire, saying that of course the formal letter of  release would be posted and the dissolution notified in the _Gazette_.  Then the transfer was signed and the cheque delivered.    “Well, good-bye till Saturday,” said Alan when he had received the latter, and nodding, to them both, he turned and left the room.  The passage ran past the little room in which Mr. Jeffreys, the head clerk, sat  alone. Catching sight of him through the open door, Alan entered, shutting it  behind him. Finding his key ring he removed from it the keys of his desk and of  the office strongroom, and handed them to the clerk who, methodical in  everything, proceeded to write a formal receipt.    “You are leaving us, Major Vernon?” he said interrogatively as he signed the paper.  “Yes, Jeffreys,” answered Alan, then prompted by some impulse, added, “Are you sorry?”  Mr. Jeffreys looked up and there were traces of unwonted emotion upon his hard,  regulated face.  “For myself, yes, Major—for you, on the whole, no.”  “What do you mean, Jeffreys? I do not quite understand.”  “I mean, Major, that I am sorry because you have never tried to shuffle off any shady business on to my back and leave me to bear the brunt of it; also  because you have always treated me as a gentleman should, not as a machine to  be used until a better can be found, and kicked aside when it goes out of  order.”  “It is very kind of you to say so, Jeffreys, but I can’t remember having done anything particular.”  “No, Major, you can’t remember what comes natural to you. But I and the others remember, and that’s why I am sorry. But for yourself I am glad, since although Aylward and Haswell have put a big thing through and are  going to make a pot of money, this is no place for the likes of you, and now  that you are going I will make bold to tell you that I always wondered what you  were doing here. By and by, Major, the row will come, as it has come more than  once in the past, before your time.”    “And then?” said Alan, for he was anxious to get to the bottom of this man’s mind, which hitherto he had always found so secret.  “And then, Major, it won’t matter much to Messrs. Aylward and Champers-Haswell, who are used to that kind of thing and will probably dissolve  partnership and lie quiet for a bit, and still less to folk like myself, who  are only servants. But if you were still here it would have mattered a great  deal to you, for it would blacken your name and break your heart, and then  what’s the good of the money? I tell you, Major,” the clerk went on  with quiet intensity, “though I am nobody and nothing, if I could afford  it I would follow your example. But I can’t, for I have a sick wife and a  family of delicate children who have to live half the year on the south coast,  to say nothing of my old mother, and—I was fool enough to be taken in and  back Sir Robert’s last little venture, which cost me all I had saved. So  you see I must make a bit before the machine is scrapped, Major. But I tell you  this, that if I can get £5000 together, as I hope to do out of Saharas before I  am a month older, for they had to give me a look-in, as I knew too much, I am  off to the country, where I was born, to take a farm there. No more of Messrs.  Aylward & Haswell for Thomas Jeffreys. That’s my bell. Good-bye,  Major, I’ll take the liberty to write you a line sometimes, for I know you  won’t give me away. Good-bye and God bless you, as I am sure He will in  the long run,” and stretching out his hand, he took that of the  astonished Alan and wrung it warmly.    When he was gone Alan went also, noticing that the clerks, whom some rumour of  these events seemed to have reached, eyed him curiously through the glass  screens behind which they sat at their desks, as he thought not without regret  and a kind of admiration. Even the magnificent be-medalled porter at the door  emerged from the carved teak box where he dwelt and touching his cap asked if  he should call a cab.  “No, thank you, Sergeant,” answered Alan, “I will take a bus, and, Sergeant, I think I forgot to give you a present last Xmas. Will you  accept this?—I wish I could make it more,” and he presented him with ten shillings.  The Sergeant drew himself up and saluted.  “Thank you kindly, Major,” he said. “I’d rather take that from you than £10 from the other gentlemen. But, Major, I wish we were out  on the West Coast again together. It’s a stinking, barbarous hole, but  not so bad as this ’ere city.”  For once these two had served as comrades, and it was through Alan that the  sergeant obtained his present lucrative but somewhat uncongenial post.    He was outside at last. The massive granite portal vanished behind him in the  evening mists, much as a nightmare vanishes. He, Alan Vernon, who for a year or  more had been in bondage, was a free man again. All his dreams of wealth had  departed; indeed if anything, save in experience, he was poorer than when first  the shadow of yonder doorway fell upon him. But at least he was safe, safe. The  deed of partnership which had been as a chain about his neck, was now white  ashes; his name was erased from that fearful prospectus of Sahara Limited,  wherein millions which someone would provide were spoken of like silver in the  days of Solomon, as things of no account. The bitterest critic could not say  that he had made a halfpenny out of the venture, in fact, if trouble came, his  voluntary abandonment of the profits due to him must go to his credit. He had  plunged into the icy waters of renunciation and come up clean if naked. Never  since he was a boy could Alan remember feeling so utterly light-hearted and  free from anxiety. Not for a million pounds would he have returned to gather  gold in that mausoleum of reputations. As for the future, he did not in the  least care what happened. There was no one dependent on him, and in this way or  in that he could always earn a crust, a nice, honest crust.      He ran down the street and danced for joy like a child, yes, and presented a  crossing-sweeper against whom he butted with a whole sixpence in compensation.  Thus he reached the Mansion House, not unsuspected of inebriety by the police,  and clambered to the top of a bus crowded with weary and anxious-looking City  clerks returning home after a long day’s labour at starvation wage. In  that cold company and a chilling atmosphere some of his enthusiasm evaporated.  He remembered that this step of his meant that sooner or later, within a year  or two at most, Yarleys, where his family had dwelt for centuries, must go to  the hammer. Why had he not accepted Aylward’s offer and sold that old  fetish to him for £17,000? There was no question of share-dealing there, and if  a very wealthy man chose to give a fancy price for a curiosity, he could take  it without doubt or shame. At least it would have sufficed to save Yarleys,  which after all was only mortgaged for £20,000. For the life of him he could  not tell. He had acted on impulse, a very curious impulse, and there was an end  of it perhaps; it might be because his uncle had told him as a boy that the  thing was unique, or perhaps because old Jeekie, his negro servant, venerated  it so much and swore that it was “lucky.” At any rate he had  declined and there was an end.      But another and a graver matter remained. He had desired wealth to save Yarleys, but he desired it still more for a different purpose. Above everything  on earth he loved Barbara, his distant cousin and the niece of Mr.  Champers-Haswell, who until an hour ago had been his partner. Now she was a  great heiress, and without fortune he could not marry her, even if she would  marry him, which remained in doubt."]]]
