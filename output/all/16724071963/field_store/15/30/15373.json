This here gentleman has to see him about somethin' else.\"  The man regarded Sol suspiciously. \"Never seen you before. Night _or_ day. Stranger?\"  \"Come _on_!\" Dawes said.  The fat man grunted and hoisted himself out of the swivel chair. He followed lamely behind the two men as they went out into the street again.  A woman, with an empty market basket, nodded casually to them. \"Mornin', folks. Enjoyed it last night. Thought you made a right nice speech, Mr. Dawes.\"  \"Thanks,\" Dawes answered gruffly, but obviously flattered. \"We were just goin' over to Brundage's to pick up the body. Ma's gonna pay a call on Mrs. Brundage around ten o'clock. You care to visit?\"  \"Why, I think that's very nice,\" the woman said. \"I'll be sure and do that.\" She smiled at the fat man. \"Mornin', Prince.\"  Sol's head was spinning. As they left the woman and continued their determined march down the quiet street, he tried to find answers.  \"Look, Mr. Dawes.\" He was panting; the pace was fast. \"Does _she_ dream about this--Armagon, too? That woman back there?\"  \"Yep.\"  Charlie chuckled. \"He's a stranger, all right.\"  \"And you, Mr.--\" Sol turned to the fat man. \"You also know about this palace and everything?\"  \"I told you,\" Dawes said testily. \"Charlie here's Prince Regent. But don't let the fancy title fool you. He got no more power than any Knight of the Realm. He's just too dern fat to do much more'n sit on a throne and eat grapes. That right, Charlie?\"  The fat man giggled.  \"Here's the Sheriff,\" Dawes said.  The Sheriff, a sleepy-eyed citizen with a long, sad face, was rocking on a porch as they approached his house, trying to puff a half-lit pipe. He lifted one hand wearily when he saw them.  \"Hi, Cookie,\" Dawes grinned. \"Thought you, me, and Charlie would get Brundage's body outa the house. This here's Mr. Becker; he got another problem. Mr. Becker, meet Cookie Coogan.\"  The Sheriff joined the procession, pausing only once to inquire into Sol's predicament.  He described the hitchhiker incident, but Coogan listened stoically. He murmured something about the Troopers, and shuffled alongside the puffing fat man.  Sol soon realized that their destination was a barber shop.  Dawes cupped his hands over the plate glass and peered inside. Gold letters on the glass advertised: HAIRCUT SHAVE & MASSAGE PARLOR. He reported: \"Nobody in the shop. Must be upstairs.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The fat man rang the bell. It was a while before an answer came.  It was a reedy woman in a housecoat, her hair in curlers, her eyes red and swollen.  \"Now, now,\" Dawes said gently. \"Don't you take on like that, Mrs. Brundage. You heard the charges. It hadda be this way.\"  \"My poor Vincent,\" she sobbed.  \"Better let us up,\" the Sheriff said kindly. \"No use just lettin' him lay there, Mrs. Brundage.\"  \"He didn't mean no harm,\" the woman snuffled. \"He was just purely ornery, Vincent was. Just plain mean stubborn.\"  \"The law's the law,\" the fat man sighed.  Sol couldn't hold himself in.  \"What law? Who's dead? How did it happen?\"  Dawes looked at him disgustedly. \"Now is it any of _your_ business? I mean, is it?\"  \"I don't know,\" Sol said miserably.  \"You better stay out of this,\" the Sheriff warned. \"This is a local matter, young man. You better stay in the shop while we go up.\"  They filed past him and the crying Mrs. Brundage.  When they were out of sight, Sol pleaded with her.  \"What happened? How did your husband die?\"  \"Please ...\"  \"You must tell me! Was it something to do with Armagon? Do you dream about the place, too?\"  She was shocked at the question. \"Of course!\"  \"And your husband? Did he have the same dream?\"  Fresh tears resulted. \"Can't you leave me alone?\" She turned her back. \"I got things to do. You can make yourself comfortable--\" She indicated the barber chairs, and left through the back door.  Sol looked after her, and then ambled over to the first chair and slipped into the high seat. His reflection in the mirror, strangely gray in the dim light, made him groan. His clothes were a mess, and he needed a shave. If only Brundage had been alive ...  He leaped out of the chair as voices sounded behind the door. Dawes was kicking it open with his foot, his arms laden with two rather large feet, still encased in bedroom slippers. Charlie was at the other end of the burden, which appeared to be a middle-aged man in pajamas. The Sheriff followed the trio up with a sad, undertaker expression. Behind him came Mrs. Brundage, properly weeping.  \"We'll take him to the funeral parlor,\" Dawes said, breathing hard. \"Weighs a ton, don't he?\"  \"What killed him?\" Sol said.  \"Heart attack.\"  The fat man chuckled.  The tableau was grisly. Sol looked away, towards the comfortingly mundane atmosphere of the barber shop. But even the sight of the thick-padded chairs, the shaving mugs on the wall, the neat rows of cutting instruments, seemed grotesque and morbid.  \"Listen,\" Sol said, as they went through the doorway. \"About my car--\"  The Sheriff turned and regarded him lugubriously. \"Your _car_? Young man, ain't you got no _respect_?\"  Sol swallowed hard and fell silent. He went outside with them, the woman slamming the barber-shop door behind him. He waited in front of the building while the men toted away the corpse to some new destination.         *       *       *       *       *  He took a walk.  The town was just coming to life. People were strolling out of their houses, commenting on the weather, chuckling amiably about local affairs. Kids on bicycles were beginning to appear, jangling the little bells and hooting to each other. A woman, hanging wash in the back yard, called out to him, thinking he was somebody else.  He found a little park, no more than twenty yards in circumference, centered around a weatherbeaten monument of some unrecognizable military figure. Three old men took their places on the bench that circled the General, and leaned on their canes.  Sol was a civil engineer. But he made like a reporter.  \"Pardon me, sir.\" The old man, leathery-faced, with a fine yellow moustache, looked at him dumbly. \"Have you ever heard of Armagon?\"  \"You a stranger?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Thought so.\"  Sol repeated the question.  \"Course I did. Been goin' there ever since I was a kid. Night-times, that is.\"  \"How--I mean, what kind of place is it?\"  \"Said you're a stranger?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then 'tain't your business.\"  That was that.  He left the park, and wandered into a thriving luncheonette. He tried questioning the man behind the counter, who merely snickered and said: \"You stayin' with the Dawes, ain't you? Better ask Willie, then. He knows the place better than anybody.\"  He asked about the execution, and the man stiffened.  \"Don't think I can talk about that. Fella broke one of the Laws; that's about it. Don't see where you come into it.\"  At eleven o'clock, he returned to the Dawes residence, and found Mom in the kitchen, surrounded by the warm nostalgic odor of home-baked bread. She told him that her husband had left a message for the stranger, informing him that the State Police would be around to get his story.  He waited in the house, gloomily turning the pages of the local newspaper, searching for references to Armagon. He found nothing.  At eleven-thirty, a brown-faced State Trooper came to call, and Sol told his story. He was promised nothing, and told to stay in town until he was contacted again by the authorities.  Mom fixed him a light lunch, the greatest feature of which was some hot biscuits she plucked out of the oven. It made him feel almost normal.  He wandered around the town some more after lunch, trying to spark conversation with the residents.  He learned little.         *       *       *       *       *  At five-thirty, he returned to the Dawes house, and was promptly leaped upon by little Sally.  \"Hi! Hi! Hi!\" she said, clutching his right leg and almost toppling him over. \"We had a party in school. I had chocolate cake. You goin' to stay with us?\"  \"Just another night,\" Sol told her, trying to shake the girl off. \"If it's okay with your folks. They haven't found my car yet.\"  \"Sally!\" Mom was peering out of the screen door. \"You let Mr. Becker alone and go wash. Your Pa will be home soon.\"  \"Oh, pooh,\" the girl said, her pigtails swinging. \"Do you got a girlfriend, mister?\"  \"No.\" Sol struggled towards the house with her dead weight on his leg. \"Would you mind? I can't walk.\"  \"Would you be my boyfriend?\"  \"Well, we'll talk about it. If you let go my leg.\"  Inside the house, she said: \"We're having pot roast. You stayin'?\"  \"Of course Mr. Becker's stayin',\" Mom said. \"He's our guest.\"  \"That's very kind of you,\" Sol said. \"I really wish you'd let me pay something--\"  \"Don't want to hear another word about pay.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mr. Dawes came home an hour later, looking tired. Mom pecked him lightly on the forehead. He glanced at the evening paper, and then spoke to Sol.  \"Hear you been asking questions, Mr. Becker.\"  Sol nodded, embarrassed. \"Guess I have. I'm awfully curious about this Armagon place. Never heard of anything like it before.\"  Dawes grunted. \"You ain't a reporter?\"  \"Oh, no. I'm an engineer. I was just satisfying my own curiosity.\"  \"Uh-huh.\" Dawes looked reflective. \"You wouldn't be thinkin' about writing us up or anything. I mean, this is a pretty private affair.\"  \"Writing it up?\" Sol blinked. \"I hadn't thought of it. But you'll have to admit--it's sure interesting.\"  \"Yeah,\" Dawes said narrowly. \"I guess it would be.\"  \"Supper!\" Mom called.  After the meal, they spent a quiet evening at home. Sally went to bed, screaming her reluctance, at eight-thirty. Mom, dozing in the big chair near the fireplace, padded upstairs at nine. Then Dawes yawned widely, stood up, and said goodnight at quarter-of-ten.  He paused in the doorway before leaving.  \"I'd think about that,\" he said. \"Writing it up, I mean. A lot of folks would think you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29193"],["title","Dream Town (#2)"],["body","just plum crazy.\"  Sol laughed feebly. \"I guess they would at that.\"  \"Goodnight,\" Dawes said.  \"Goodnight.\"  He read Sally's copy of _Treasure Island_ for about half an hour. Then he undressed, made himself comfortable on the sofa, snuggled under the soft blanket that Mom had provided, and shut his eyes.  He reviewed the events of the day before dropping off to sleep. The troublesome Sally. The strange dream world of Armagon. The visit to the barber shop. The removal of Brundage's body. The conversations with the townspeople. Dawes' suspicious attitude ...  Then sleep came.         *       *       *       *       *  He was flanked by marble pillars, thrusting towards a high-domed ceiling.  The room stretched long and wide before him, the walls bedecked in stunning purple draperies.  He whirled at the sound of footsteps, echoing stridently on the stone floor. Someone was running towards him.  It was Sally, pigtails streaming out behind her, the small body wearing a flowing white toga. She was shrieking, laughing as she skittered past him, clutching a gleaming gold helmet.  He called out to her, but she was too busy outdistancing her pursuer. It was Sheriff Coogan, puffing and huffing, the metal-and-gold cloth uniform ludicrous on his lanky frame.  \"Consarn kid!\" he wheezed. \"Gimme my hat!\"  Mom was following him, her stout body regal in scarlet robes. \"Sally! You give Sir Coogan his helmet! You hear?\"  \"Mrs. Dawes!\" Sol said.  \"Why, Mr. Becker! How nice to see you again! Pa! _Pa!_ Look who's here!\"  Willie Dawes appeared. _No!_ Sol thought. This was _King_ Dawes; nothing else could explain the magnificence of his attire.  \"Yes,\" Dawes said craftily. \"So I see. Welcome to Armagon, Mr. Becker.\"  \"Armagon?\" Sol gaped. \"Then this is the place you've been dreaming about?\"  \"Yep,\" the King said. \"And now _you're_ in it, too.\"  \"Then I'm only dreaming!\"  Charlie, the fat man, clumsy as ever in his robes of State, said: \"So _that's_ the snooper, eh?\"  \"Yep,\" Dawes chuckled. \"Think you better round up the Knights.\"  Sol said: \"The Knights?\"  \"Exelution! Exelution!\" Sally shrieked.  \"Now wait a minute--\"  Charlie shouted.  Running feet, clanking of armor. Sol backed up against a pillar. \"Now look here. You've gone far enough--\"  \"Not quite,\" said the King.  The Knights stepped forward.  \"Wait!\" Sol screamed.  Familiar faces, under shining helmets, moved towards him; the tips of sharp-pointed spears gleaming wickedly. And Sol Becker wondered--would he ever awake?
