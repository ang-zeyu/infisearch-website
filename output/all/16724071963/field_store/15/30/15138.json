This Adjunct is said to be '=peculiar=' to the Class so formed. In this case, the Class \"Things\" is called a '=Genus=' with regard to the Class so formed: the Class, so formed, is called a '=Species=' of the Class \"Things\": and its peculiar Adjunct is called its '=Differentia='.                                                                    pg002 As this Process is entirely _Mental_, we can perform it whether there _is_, or _is not_, an _existing_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct. If there _is_, the Class is said to be '=Real='; if not, it is said to be '=Unreal=', or '=Imaginary=.'      [For example, we may imagine that we have picked out, from the     Class \"Things,\" all the Things which possess the Adjunct     \"material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets\"; and we     may thus form the Real Class \"towns.\" Here we may regard     \"Things\" as a _Genus_, \"Towns\" as a _Species_ of Things, and     \"material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets\" as its     _Differentia_.      Again, we may imagine that we have picked out all the Things     which possess the Adjunct \"weighing a ton, easily lifted by a     baby\"; and we may thus form the _Imaginary_ Class \"Things that     weigh a ton and are easily lifted by a baby.\"]  (3) We may think of a certain Class, _not_ the Class \"Things,\" and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the Members of it which possess a certain Adjunct _not_ possessed by the whole Class. This Adjunct is said to be '=peculiar=' to the smaller Class so formed. In this case, the Class thought of is called a '=Genus=' with regard to the smaller Class picked out from it: the smaller Class is called a '=Species=' of the larger: and its peculiar Adjunct is called its '=Differentia='.      [For example, we may think of the Class \"towns,\" and imagine     that we have picked out from it all the towns which possess the     Attribute \"lit with gas\"; and we may thus form the Real Class     \"towns lit with gas.\" Here we may regard \"Towns\" as a _Genus_,     \"Towns lit with gas\" as a _Species_ of Towns, and \"lit with gas\"     as its _Differentia_.      If, in the above example, we were to alter \"lit with gas\" into     \"paved with gold,\" we should get the _Imaginary_ Class \"towns     paved with gold.\"]  A Class, containing only _one_ Member is called an '=Individual=.'      [For example, the Class \"towns having four million inhabitants,\"     which Class contains only _one_ Member, viz. \"London.\"]                                                                    pg002½ Hence, any single Thing, which we can name so as to distinguish it from all other Things, may be regarded as a one-Member Class.      [Thus \"London\" may be regarded as the one-Member Class, picked     out from the Class \"towns,\" which has, as its Differentia,     \"having four million inhabitants.\"]  A Class, containing two or more Members, is sometimes regarded as _one single Thing_. When so regarded, it may possess an Adjunct which is _not_ possessed by any Member of it taken separately.      [Thus, the Class \"The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment,\" when     regarded as _one single Thing_, may possess the Attribute     \"formed in square,\" which is _not_ possessed by any Member of it     taken separately.]                                                                     pg003  CHAPTER III.  _DIVISION._   § 1.  _Introductory._  'Division' is a Mental Process, in which we think of a certain Class of Things, and imagine that we have divided it into two or more smaller Classes.      [Thus, we might think of the Class \"books,\" and imagine that we     had divided it into the two smaller Classes \"bound books\" and     \"unbound books,\" or into the three Classes, \"books priced at     less than a shilling,\" \"shilling-books,\" \"books priced at more     than a shilling,\" or into the twenty-six Classes, \"books whose     names begin with _A_,\" \"books whose names begin with _B_,\" &c.]  A Class, that has been obtained by a certain Division, is said to be 'codivisional' with every Class obtained by that Division.      [Thus, the Class \"bound books\" is codivisional with each of the     two Classes, \"bound books\" and \"unbound books.\"      Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been     \"contemporary\" with every event that happened in 1815.]  Hence a Class, obtained by Division, is codivisional with itself.      [Thus, the Class \"bound books\" is codivisional with itself.      Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been     \"contemporary\" with itself.]                                                                     pg003½ § 2.  _Dichotomy._  If we think of a certain Class, and imagine that we have picked out from it a certain smaller Class, it is evident that the _Remainder_ of the large Class does _not_ possess the Differentia of that smaller Class. Hence it may be regarded as _another_ smaller Class, whose Differentia may be formed, from that of the Class first picked out, by prefixing the word \"not\"; and we may imagine that we have _divided_ the Class first thought of into _two_ smaller Classes, whose Differentiæ are _contradictory_. This kind of Division is called '=Dichotomy='.      [For example, we may divide \"books\" into the two Classes whose     Differentiæ are \"old\" and \"not-old.\"]  In performing this Process, we may sometimes find that the Attributes we have chosen are used so loosely, in ordinary conversation, that it is not easy to decide _which_ of the Things belong to the one Class and _which_ to the other. In such a case, it would be necessary to lay down some arbitrary _rule_, as to _where_ the one Class should end and the other begin.      [Thus, in dividing \"books\" into \"old\" and \"not-old,\" we may say     \"Let all books printed before A.D. 1801, be regarded as 'old,'     and all others as 'not-old'.\"]  Henceforwards let it be understood that, if a Class of Things be divided into two Classes, whose Differentiæ have contrary meanings, each Differentia is to be regarded as equivalent to the other with the word \"not\" prefixed.      [Thus, if \"books\" be divided into \"old\" and \"new\" the Attribute     \"old\" is to be regarded as equivalent to \"not-new,\" and the     Attribute \"new\" as equivalent to \"not-old.\"]                                                                    pg004 After dividing a Class, by the Process of _Dichotomy_, into two smaller Classes, we may sub-divide each of these into two still smaller Classes; and this Process may be repeated over and over again, the number of Classes being doubled at each repetition.      [For example, we may divide \"books\" into \"old\" and \"new\" (i.e.     \"_not_-old\"): we may then sub-divide each of these into     \"English\" and \"foreign\" (i.e. \"_not_-English\"), thus getting     _four_ Classes, viz.          (1) old English;         (2) old foreign;         (3) new English;         (4) new foreign.      If we had begun by dividing into \"English\" and \"foreign,\" and     had then sub-divided into \"old\" and \"new,\" the four Classes     would have been          (1) English old;         (2) English new;         (3) foreign old;         (4) foreign new.      The Reader will easily see that these are the very same four     Classes which we had before.]                                                                     pg004½  CHAPTER IV.  _NAMES._   The word \"Thing\", which conveys the idea of a Thing, _without_ any idea of an Adjunct, represents _any_ single Thing. Any other word (or phrase), which conveys the idea of a Thing, _with_ the idea of an Adjunct represents _any_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct; i.e., it represents any Member of the Class to which that Adjunct is _peculiar_.  Such a word (or phrase) is called a '=Name='; and, if there be an existing Thing which it represents, it is said to be a Name of that Thing.      [For example, the words \"Thing,\" \"Treasure,\" \"Town,\" and the     phrases \"valuable Thing,\" \"material artificial Thing consisting     of houses and streets,\" \"Town lit with gas,\" \"Town paved with     gold,\" \"old English Book.\"]  Just as a Class is said to be _Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there _is_, or _is not_, an existing Thing in it, so also a Name is said to be _Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there _is_, or _is not_, an existing Thing represented by it.      [Thus, \"Town lit with gas\" is a _Real_ Name: \"Town paved with     gold\" is an _Unreal_ Name.]  Every Name is either a Substantive only, or else a phrase consisting of a Substantive and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives).  Every Name, except \"Thing\", may usually be expressed in three different forms:--      (_a_) The Substantive \"Thing\", and one or more     Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives) conveying     the ideas of the Attributes;                                                                    pg005     (_b_) A Substantive, conveying the idea of a Thing with     the ideas of _some_ of the Attributes, and one or more     Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives) conveying     the ideas of the _other_ Attributes;      (_c_) A Substantive conveying the idea of a Thing with     the ideas of _all_ the Attributes.      [Thus, the phrase \"material living Thing, belonging to the     Animal Kingdom, having two hands and two feet\" is a Name     expressed in Form (_a_).      If we choose to roll up together the Substantive \"Thing\" and the     Adjectives \"material, living, belonging to the Animal Kingdom,\"     so as to make the new Substantive \"Animal,\" we get the phrase     \"Animal having two hands and two feet,\" which is a Name     (representing the same Thing as before) expressed in Form (_b_).      And, if we choose to roll up the whole phrase into one word, so     as to make the new Substantive \"Man,\" we get a Name (still     representing the very same Thing) expressed in Form (_c_).]  A Name, whose Substantive is in the _plural_ number, may be used to represent"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28696"],["title","Symbolic Logic (#5)"],["body","(1) Members of a Class, _regarded as separate Things_;     or (2) a whole Class, _regarded as one single Thing_.      [Thus, when I say \"Some soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are     tall,\" or \"The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are brave,\" I am     using the Name \"soldiers of the Tenth Regiment\" in the _first_     sense; and it is just the same as if I were to point to each of     them _separately_, and to say \"_This_ soldier of the Tenth     Regiment is tall,\" \"_That_ soldier of the Tenth Regiment is     tall,\" and so on.      But, when I say \"The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are formed     in square,\" I am using the phrase in the _second_ sense; and it     is just the same as if I were to say \"The _Tenth Regiment_ is     formed in square.\"]                                                                     pg006  CHAPTER V.  _DEFINITIONS._   It is evident that every Member of a _Species_ is _also_ a Member of the _Genus_ out of which that Species has been picked, and that it possesses the _Differentia_ of that Species. Hence it may be represented by a Name consisting of two parts, one being a Name representing any Member of the _Genus_, and the other being the _Differentia_ of that Species. Such a Name is called a '=Definition=' of any Member of that Species, and to give it such a Name is to '=define=' it.      [Thus, we may define a \"Treasure\" as a \"valuable Thing.\" In this     case we regard \"Things\" as the _Genus_, and \"valuable\" as the     _Differentia_.]  The following Examples, of this Process, may be taken as models for working others.      [Note that, in each Definition, the Substantive, representing a     Member (or Members) of the _Genus_, is printed in Capitals.]  1. Define \"a Treasure.\"  _Ans._ \"a valuable THING.\"  2. Define \"Treasures.\"  _Ans._ \"valuable THINGS.\"  3. Define \"a Town.\"  _Ans._ \"a material artificial THING, consisting of houses and streets.\"                                                                    pg007 4. Define \"Men.\"  _Ans._ \"material, living THINGS, belonging to the Animal Kingdom, having two hands and two feet\";  or else  \"ANIMALS having two hands and two feet.\"  5. Define \"London.\"  _Ans._ \"the material artificial THING, which consists of houses and streets, and has four million inhabitants\";  or else  \"the TOWN which has four million inhabitants.\"      [Note that we here use the article \"the\" instead of \"a\", because     we happen to know that there is only _one_ such Thing.      The Reader can set himself any number of Examples of this     Process, by simply choosing the Name of any common Thing (such     as \"house,\" \"tree,\" \"knife\"), making a Definition for it, and     then testing his answer by referring to any English Dictionary.]                                                                     pg008   BOOK II.  PROPOSITIONS.    CHAPTER I.  _PROPOSITIONS GENERALLY._   § 1.  _Introductory._  Note that the word \"some\" is to be regarded, henceforward, as meaning \"one or more.\"  The word 'Proposition,' as used in ordinary conversation, may be applied to _any_ word, or phrase, which conveys any information whatever.      [Thus the words \"yes\" and \"no\" are Propositions in the ordinary     sense of the word; and so are the phrases \"you owe me five     farthings\" and \"I don't!\"      Such words as \"oh!\" or \"never!\", and such phrases as \"fetch me     that book!\" \"which book do you mean?\" do not seem, at first     sight, to convey any _information_; but they can easily be     turned into equivalent forms which do so, viz. \"I am surprised,\"     \"I will never consent to it,\" \"I order you to fetch me that     book,\" \"I want to know which book you mean.\"]  But a '=Proposition=,' as used in this First Part of \"Symbolic Logic,\" has a peculiar form, which may be called its '=Normal form='; and if any Proposition, which we wish to use in an argument, is not in normal form, we must reduce it to such a form, before we can use it.                                                                    pg009 A '=Proposition=,' when in normal form, asserts, as to certain two Classes, which are called its '=Subject=' and '=Predicate=,' either      (1) that _some_ Members of its Subject are Members     of its Predicate;      or (2) that _no_ Members of its Subject are Members     of its Predicate;      or (3) that _all_ Members of its Subject are Members     of its Predicate.  The Subject and the Predicate of a Proposition are called its '=Terms=.'  Two Propositions, which convey the _same_ information, are said to be '=equivalent='.      [Thus, the two Propositions, \"I see John\" and \"John is seen by     me,\" are equivalent.]   § 2.  _Normal form of a Proposition._  A Proposition, in normal form, consists of four parts, viz.--      (1) The word \"some,\" or \"no,\" or \"all.\" (This word,     which tells us _how many_ Members of the Subject     are also Members of the Predicate, is called the     '=Sign of Quantity=.')      (2) Name of Subject.      (3) The verb \"are\" (or \"is\"). (This is called the     '=Copula=.')      (4) Name of Predicate.                                                                     pg010 § 3.  _Various kinds of Propositions._  A Proposition, that begins with \"Some\", is said to be '=Particular=.' It is also called 'a Proposition =in I=.'      [Note, that it is called 'Particular,' because it refers to a     _part_ only of the Subject.]  A Proposition, that begins with \"No\", is said to be '=Universal Negative=.' It is also called 'a Proposition =in E=.'  A Proposition, that begins with \"All\", is said to be '=Universal Affirmative=.' It is also called 'a Proposition =in A=.'      [Note, that they are called 'Universal', because they refer to     the _whole_ of the Subject.]  A Proposition, whose Subject is an _Individual_, is to be regarded as _Universal_.      [Let us take, as an example, the Proposition \"John is not well\".     This of course implies that there is an _Individual_, to whom     the speaker refers when he mentions \"John\", and whom the     listener _knows_ to be referred to. Hence the Class \"men     referred to by the speaker when he mentions 'John'\" is a     one-Member Class, and the Proposition is equivalent to \"_All_     the men, who are referred to by the speaker when he mentions     'John', are not well.\"]  Propositions are of two kinds, 'Propositions of Existence' and 'Propositions of Relation.'  These shall be discussed separately.                                                                     pg011  CHAPTER II.  _PROPOSITIONS OF EXISTENCE._   A '=Proposition of Existence=', when in normal form, has, for its _Subject_, the Class \"existing Things\".  Its Sign of Quantity is \"Some\" or \"No\".      [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_     existing Things are Members of its Predicate, it does _not_ tell     us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with _two_     numbers, which are, in ascending order, \"0\" and \"1 or more.\"]  It is called \"a Proposition of Existence\" because its effect is to assert the _Reality_ (i.e. the real _existence_), or else the _Imaginariness_, of its Predicate.      [Thus, the Proposition \"Some existing Things are honest men\"     asserts that the Class \"honest men\" is _Real_.      This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any     one of the following forms:--          (1) \"Honest men exist\";         (2) \"Some honest men exist\";         (3) \"The Class 'honest men' exists\";         (4) \"There are honest men\";         (5) \"There are some honest men\".      Similarly, the Proposition \"No existing Things are men fifty     feet high\" asserts that the Class \"men 50 feet high\" is     _Imaginary_.      This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any     one of the following forms:--          (1) \"Men 50 feet high do not exist\";         (2) \"No men 50 feet high exist\";         (3) \"The Class 'men 50 feet high' does not exist\";         (4) \"There are not any men 50 feet high\";         (5) \"There are no men 50 feet high.\"]                                                                     pg012  CHAPTER III.  _PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION._   § 1.  _Introductory._  A =Proposition of Relation=, of the kind to be here discussed, has, for its Terms, two Specieses of the same Genus, such that each of the two Names conveys the idea of some Attribute _not_ conveyed by the other.      [Thus, the Proposition \"Some merchants are misers\" is of the     right kind, since \"merchants\" and \"misers\" are Specieses of the     same Genus \"men\"; and since the Name \"merchants\" conveys the     idea of the Attribute \"mercantile\", and the name \"misers\" the     idea of the Attribute \"miserly\", each of which ideas is _not_     conveyed by the other Name.      But the Proposition \"Some dogs are setters\" is _not_ of the     right kind, since, although it is true that \"dogs\" and \"setters\"     are Specieses of the same Genus \"animals\", it is _not_ true that     the Name \"dogs\" conveys the idea of any Attribute not conveyed     by the Name \"setters\". Such Propositions will be discussed in     Part II.]  The Genus, of which the two Terms are Specieses, is called the '=Universe of Discourse=,' or (more briefly) the '=Univ.='  The Sign of Quantity is \"Some\" or \"No\" or \"All\".      [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_     Members of its Subject are _also_ Members of its Predicate, it     does not tell us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with     _three_ numbers, which are, in ascending order, \"0\", \"1 or     more\", \"the total number of Members of the Subject\".]  It is called \"a Proposition of Relation\" because its effect is to assert that a certain _relationship_ exists between its Terms.                                                                     pg013 § 2.  _Reduction of a Proposition of Relation to Normal form._  The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:--  (1) Ascertain what is the _Subject_ (i.e., ascertain what Class we are _talking about_);  (2) If the verb,"]]]
