We had great ado, during the cooking of dinner, to prevent them from hopping into our little stove, as it gleamed brightly in the early dusk; and have adopted special precautions to keep them from the tent, as they jump about in the tall grass, appeasing their insectivorous appetites.  [Footnote A: Upon the Ohio and kindred rivers, the term \"wharf\" applies to the river beach when graded and paved, ready for the reception of steamers. Such a wharf must not be confounded with a lake or seaside wharf, a staging projected into the water.]  [Footnote B: It was in this neighborhood, a mile or two above our camp, where the bottom is narrower, that Capt. William Foreman and twenty other Virginia militiamen were killed in an Indian ambuscade, Sept. 27, 1777.

The Big Grave--Washington, and Round Bottom--A lazy man's     Paradise--Captina Creek--George Rogers Clark at Fish     Creek--Southern types.   Near Fishing Creek, Friday, May 11th.--There had been rain during the night, with fierce wind gusts, but during breakfast the atmosphere quieted, and we had a genial, semi-cloudy morning.  Off at 8 o'clock, Pilgrim's crew were soon exploring Moundsville. There are five thousand people in this old, faded, countrified town. They show you with pride the State Penitentiary of West Virginia, a solemn-looking pile of dark gray stone, with the feeble battlements and towers common to American prison architecture. But the chief feature of the place is the great Indian mound--the \"Big Grave\" of early chroniclers. This earthwork is one of the largest now remaining in the United States, being sixty-eight feet high and a hundred in diameter at the base, and has for over a century attracted the attention of travelers and arch√¶ologists.  We found it at the end of a straggling street, on the edge of the town, a quarter of a mile back from the river. Around the mound has been left a narrow plat of ground, utilized as a cornfield; and the stout picket fence which encloses it bears peremptory notice that admission is forbidden. However, as the proprietor was not easily accessible, we exercised the privilege of historical pilgrims, and, letting ourselves in through the gate, picked our way through rows of corn, and ascended the great cone. It is covered with a heavy growth of white oaks, some of them three feet in diameter, among which the path picturesquely zigzags. The summit is fifty-five feet in diameter, and the center somewhat depressed, like a basin. From the middle of this basin a shaft some twenty-five feet in diameter has been sunk by explorers, for a distance of perhaps fifty feet; at one time, a level tunnel connected the bottom of this shaft with the side of the cone, but it has been mostly obliterated. A score of years ago, tunnel and shaft were utilized as the leading attractions of a beer garden--to such base uses may a great historical landmark descend!  Dickens, who apparently wrote the greater part of his _American Notes_ while suffering from dyspepsia, has a note of appreciation for the Big Grave: \"... the host of Indians who lie buried in a great mound yonder--so old that mighty oaks and other forest trees have struck their roots into its earth; and so high that it is a hill, even among the hills that Nature planted around it. The very river, as though it shared one's feelings of compassion for the extinct tribes who lived so pleasantly here, in their blessed ignorance of white existence, hundreds of years ago, steals out of its way to ripple near this mound; and there are few places where the Ohio sparkles more brightly than in the Big Grave Creek.\"  There is a sharp bend in the river, just below Moundsville, with Dillon's Bottom stretching long and wide at the apex on the Ohio shore--flat green fields, dotted with little white farmsteads, each set low in its apple grove, and a convoluted wall of dark hills hemming them in along the northern horizon. Then below this comes Round Bottom, its counterpart on the West Virginia side, and coursing through it a pretty meadow creek, Butler's Run.  Writes Washington, in 1781, to a correspondent who is thinking of renting lands in this region: \"I have a small tract called the round bottom containing about 600 Acres, which would also let. It lyes on the Ohio, opposite to pipe Creek, and a little above Capteening.\" Across the half mile of river are the little levels and great slopes of the Ohio hills, through which breaks this same Pipe Creek; and hereabout Cresap's band murdered a number of inoffensive Shawanese, a tragedy which was one of the inciting causes of Lord Dunmore's War (1774).  We crossed over into Ohio, and pulled up on the gravelly spit at the mouth of Pipe. While the others were botanizing high on the mountain side, I went along a beach path toward a group of whitewashed cabins, intent on replenishing the canteen. Upon opening the gate of one of them, two grizzly dogs came bounding out, threatening to test the strength of my corduroy trousers. The proprietor cautiously peered from a window, and, much to my relief, called off the animals. Satisfied, apparently, that I was not the visitor he expected, the fellow lounged out and sat upon the steps, where I joined him. He was a tall, raw-boned, loose-jointed young man, with a dirty, buttonless flannel shirt which revealed a hairy breast; upon his trousers hung a variety of patches, in many stages of grease and decrepitude; a gray slouch hat shaded his little fishy eyes and hollow, yellow cheeks; and the snaky ends of his yellow mustache were stiff with accumulations of dried tobacco juice. His fat, waddling wife, in a greasy black gown, followed with bare feet, and, arms akimbo, listened in the open door.  A coal company owns the rocky river front, here and at many places below, and lets these cabins to the poor-white element, so numerous on the Ohio's banks. The renter is privileged to cultivate whatever land he can clear on the rocky, precipitous slopes, which is seldom more than half an acre to the cabin; and he may, if he can afford a cow, let her run wild in the scrub. The coal vein, a few rods back of the house, is only a few inches thick, and poor in quality, but is freely resorted to by the cotters. He worked whenever he could find a job, my host said--in the coal mines and quarries, or on the bottom farms, or the railroad which skirts the bank at his feet.  \"But I tell ye, sir, th' _I_talians and Hungarians is spoil'n' this yere country fur white men; 'n' I do'n' see no prospect for hits be'n' better till they get shoved out uv 't!\" Yet he said that life wasn't so hard here as it was in some parts he had heard tell of--the climate was mild, that he \"'lowed;\" a fellow could go out and get a free bucket of coal from the hillside \"back yon;\" he might get all the \"light wood 'n' patchin' stuff\" he wanted, from the river drift; could, when he \"hankered after 'em,\" catch fish off his own front-door yard; and pick up a dollar now and then at odd jobs, when the rent was to be paid, or the \"ol' woman\" wanted a dress, or he a new coat.  This is clearly the lazy man's Paradise. I do not remember to have heard that the South Sea Islanders, in the ante-missionary days, had an easier time of it than this. What new fortune will befall my friend when he gets the Italians and Hungarians \"shoved out,\" and \"things pick up a bit,\" I cannot conceive.  A pleasing panorama he has from his doorway--across the river, the fertile fields of Round Bottom, once Washington's; Captina Island, just below, long and thickly-willowed, dreamily afloat in a glassy sea, reflecting every change of light; the whole girt about with the wide uplands of the winding valley, and overhead the march of sunny clouds.  Captina Creek (108 miles) is not far down on the Ohio bank, and beside it the little hamlet of Powhattan Point, with the West Virginia hills thereabout exceptionally high and steep, and wooded to the very top. Washington, who knew the Ohio well, down to the Great Kanawha, wrote of this creek in 1770: \"A pretty large creek on the west side, called by Nicholson [his interpreter] Fox-Grape-Vine, by others Captema creek, on which, eight miles up, is the town called Grape-Vine Town.\" Captina village is its white successor. But there were also Indians at the mouth of the creek; for when George Rogers Clark and his missionary companion, Jones, two years later camped opposite on the Virginia shore, they went over to make a morning call on the natives, who repaid it in the evening, doubtless each time receiving freely from the white men's bounty.  The next day was Sunday, and the travelers remained in camp, Jones recording in his journal that he \"instructed what Indians came over.\" In the course of his prayer, the missionary was particularly impressed by the attitude of the chief of Grape-Vine Town, named Frank Stephens, who professed to believe in the Christian God; and he naively writes, \"I was informed that, all the time, the Indians looked very seriously at me.\" Jones appears to have been impressed also with the hardness of the beach, where they camped in the open, doubtless to avoid surprises: \"Instead of feathers, my bed was gravel-stones, by the river side ... which at first seemed not to suit me, but afterward it became more natural.\"  In those days, traveling was beset with difficulties, both ashore and afloat. Eight years later (spring of 1780), three flatboats were descending the Ohio, laden with families intending to settle in Kentucky, when they suffered a common fate, being attacked by Indians off Captina Creek. Several men and a child were killed, and twenty-one persons were carried into captivity--among them, Catherine Malott, a girl in her teens, who subsequently became the wife of that most notorious of border renegades, Simon Girty.

I am not prejudiced, but I have observed the scientific mind in action, on a great many occasions, and I find it rather incomprehensible.  It is true that there are men with a scientific turn of mind who, at the same time, you can feel safe to stand with shoulder to shoulder, in an emergency. Young Hendricks, who was my junior officer on the _Ertak_, back in those early days of the Special Patrol Service, about which I have written so much, was one of these.  Nor, now that I come to think of the matter in the cool and impartial manner which is typical of me, was young Hendricks the only one. There was a chap--let's see, now. I remember his face very well; he was one of those dark, wiry, alert men, a native of Earth, and his name was--Inverness! Carlos Inverness. Old John Hanson's memory isn't quite as tricky as some of these smart young officers of the Service, so newly commissioned that the silver braid is not yet fitted to the curve of their sleeves, would lead one to believe.  I met Inverness in the ante-room of the Chief of Command. The Chief was tied up in one of the long-winded meetings which the Silver-sleeves devoted largely to the making of new rules and regulations for the confusion of both men and officers of the Service, but he came out long enough to give me the _Ertak's_ orders in person.  \"Glad to see you here at Base again, Commander,\" he said, in his crisp, business-like way. \"Hear some good reports of your work; keep it up!\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" I said, wondering what was in the air. Any time the Chief was complimentary, it was well to look out for squalls--which is an old Earth term for unexpected trouble.  \"Not at all, Commander, not at all. And now, let me present Carlos Inverness, the scientist, of whom you have undoubtedly heard.\"  I bowed and said nothing, but we shook hands after the fashion of Earth, and Inverness smiled quite humanly.  \"I imagine the good captain has been too busy to follow the activities of such as myself,\" he said, sensibly enough.  \"A commander\"--and I laid enough emphasis on the title to point out to him his error in terminology--\"in the Special Patrol Service usually finds plenty to occupy his mind,\" I commented, wondering more than ever what was up.  [Illustration: _At the same instant two other trap-doors swung up._]  \"True,\" said the Chief briskly. \"You'll pardon me if I'm exceedingly brief, Commander, but there's a sizeable group in there waiting my return.  \"I have a special mission for you; a welcome relief from routine patrol. I believe you have made special requests, in the past, for assignments other than the routine work of the Service, Commander?\"  He was boxing me up in a corner, and I knew it, but I couldn't deny what he said, so I admitted it as gracefully as I could.  \"Very well,\" nodded the Chief, and it seemed to me his eyes twinkled for an instant. \"Inverness, here, is head of a party of scientists bent upon a certain exploration. They have interested the Council in the work, and the Council has requested the cooperation of this Service.\"  He glanced at me to make sure I understood. I certainly did; when the Supreme Council _requested_ something, that thing was done.  \"Very well, sir,\" I said. \"What are your orders?\"  The Chief shrugged.  \"Simply that you are to cooperate with Inverness and his party, assisting them in every possible way, including the use of your ship for transporting them and a reasonable amount of equipment, to the field of their activities. The command of the ship remains, of course, in you and your officers, but in every reasonable way the _Ertak_ and her crew are to be at the disposal of Inverness and his group. Is that clear, Commander?\"  \"Perfectly, sir.\" Nothing could have been clearer. I was to run the ship, and Inverness and his crew were to run me. I could just imagine how Correy, my fighting first officer, would take this bit of news. The mental picture almost made me laugh, disgusted as I was.  \"Written orders will, of course, be given you before departure. I believe that's all. Good luck, Commander!\" The Chief offered his hand briefly, and then hurried back to the other room where the Silver-sleeves had gathered to make more rulings for the confusion of the Service.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Since when,\" asked Correy bitterly, \"are we running excursions for civilians? We'll be personally conducting elderly ladies next thing.\"  \"Or put on Attached Police Service,\" growled Hendricks, referring to the poor devils who, in those days, policed the air-lanes of the populated worlds, cruising over the same pitiful routes day after day, never rising beyond the fringe of the stratosphere.  \"Perhaps,\" suggested the level-headed Kincaide, \"it isn't as bad as it sounds. Didn't you, say, sir, that this Inverness was rather a decent sort of chap?\"  I nodded.  \"Very much so. You'd scarcely take him for a scientist.\"  \"And our destination is--what?\" asked Kincaide.  \"That I don't know. Inverness is to give us that information when he arrives, which will be very shortly, if he is on time.\"  \"Our destination,\" said Correy, \"will probably be some little ball of mud with a tricky atmosphere or some freak vegetation they want to study. I'd rather--\"  A sharp rap on the door of the navigating room, where we had gathered for an informal council of war, interrupted.  \"Party of three civilians at the main exit port, Port Number One, sir,\" reported the sub-officer of the guard. \"One sent his name: Carlos Inverness.\"  \"Very good. Admit them at once, and recall the outer guards. We are leaving immediately.\"  As the guard saluted and hurried away, I nodded to Correy. \"Have the operating room crew report for duty at once,\" I ordered, \"and ask Sub-officer Scholey to superintend the sealing of the ports. Mr. Kincaide, will you take the first watch as navigating officer? Lift her easily until we determine our objective and can set a course; this is like shoving off with sealed orders.\"  \"Worse,\" said Hendricks unhappily. \"Sealed orders promise something interesting, and--\"  \"Carlos Inverness and party,\" announced the guard from the doorway.  Inverness nodded to me in friendly fashion and indicated his two companions.  \"Commander Hanson,\" he said, \"permit me to present Godar Tipene and Cleve Brady, who are my companions on this expedition.\" I bowed, and shook hands with Brady; Tipene was a Zenian, and hence did not offer me this greeting of Earth. Then, quickly, I completed the round of introductions, studying Inverness's companions with interest as I did so.         *       *       *       *       *  Brady was short, and rather red-faced; a beefy, taciturn type, with a trap-like mouth and thoughtful discerning eyes. He struck me as being one with whom most men would like to be friendly, but who would have exceedingly few friends.  The Zenian was a perfect foil for him. Tipene was exceedingly tall and slender, like all his race, and very dark. His eyes were almost womanly in their softness, and he had the nervous grace of a thoroughbred--which is an Earth animal of particularly high breeding, raised for show purposes. He had the happy faculty of speaking the language of Earth without a trace of Zenian or Universal accent; the Zenians are exceeded by none in linguistic ability, which was a real accomplishment before these decadent days when native languages are slipping so rapidly into obscurity.  \"And now,\" said Inverness crisply, when the introductions were over, \"I presume you'll wish to know something about our destination and the objects of this expedition, sir?\"  \"It would be helpful in charting our course,\" I admitted, smiling.  Inverness, with beautiful disregard for the necessities of space navigation, spread voluminous papers over the table whose surface was formed by the pair of three-dimensional charts which were the _Ertak's_ eyes in outer space.  \"Our destination,\" he said, \"is a body designated on the charts as FX-31. You are familiar with it, Commander Hanson?\"  \"Hardly familiar,\" I admitted, smiling at Correy. \"The universe is rather sizable, and even the named bodies are so numerous that one is able to be familiar with but an exceedingly small percentage. Its designation, of course, gives me certain information regarding its size, location and status, however.\"  \"How much information, Commander?\" asked Tipene nervously.  \"Well, 'F' indicates that it is large; larger than Earth, for example. The numerals tells me where to locate it upon our space charts. And the 'X' would indicate that it is inhabited, but not by intelligent beings. Or that there is reasonable doubt as to the nature of those inhabiting it.\"  \"A very good summary of the knowledge we have,\" nodded Inverness approvingly. \"I can add but one bit of information which may or may not be accurate: that the sphere known as FX-31 is populated by a ruling class decidedly unusual in type, and possessed of a degree of intelligence which has made them virtual masters of the sphere.\"  \"What are they like?\" asked Correy. \"Will they put up a fight? Are they dangerous?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Our knowledge came from a luckless tramp liner which set down on FX-31 in search of water, their water-producing equipment having been damaged by carelessness. They found water, a great river of it, and sent a party of five men to determine its fitness for human consumption. They were snapped up before they"]]]
