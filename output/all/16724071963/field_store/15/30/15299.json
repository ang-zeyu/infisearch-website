To human eyes they were alone in the cabin. But Bat still followed a moving something with his gaze. And it was something which he had at last made up his mind to distrust and dislike. For now he took a step or two forward and spat--his loathing made plain by every raised hair along his spine. And in that same moment Steena saw a flicker--a flicker of vague outline against Cliff's hunched shoulders as if the invisible one had crossed the space between them.  But why had it been revealed against Cliff and not against the back of one of the seats or against the panels, the walls of the corridor or the cover of the bed where it had reclined and played with its loot? What could Bat see?  The storehouse memory that had served Steena so well through the years clicked open a half-forgotten door. With one swift motion she tore loose her spaceall and flung the baggy garment across the back of the nearest seat.  Bat was snarling now, emitting the throaty rising cry that was his hunting song. But he was edging back, back toward Steena's feet, shrinking from something he could not fight but which he faced defiantly. If he could draw it after him, past that dangling spaceall.... He had to--it was their only chance.  \"What the....\" Cliff had come out of his seat and was staring at them.  What he saw must have been weird enough. Steena, bare-armed and shouldered, her usually stiffly-netted hair falling wildly down her back, Steena watching empty space with narrowed eyes and set mouth, calculating a single wild chance. Bat, crouched on his belly, retreating from thin air step by step and wailing like a demon.  \"Toss me your blaster.\" Steena gave the order calmly--as if they still sat at their table in the Rigel Royal.  And as quietly Cliff obeyed. She caught the small weapon out of the air with a steady hand--caught and leveled it.  \"Stay just where you are!\" she warned. \"Back, Bat, bring it back!\"  With a last throat-splitting screech of rage and hate, Bat twisted to safety between her boots. She pressed with thumb and forefinger, firing at the spacealls. The material turned to powdery flakes of ash--except for certain bits which still flapped from the scorched seat--as if something had protected them from the force of the blast. Bat sprang straight up in the air with a scream that tore their ears.  \"What...?\" began Cliff again.  Steena made a warning motion with her left hand. \"_Wait!_\"  She was still tense, still watching Bat. The cat dashed madly around the cabin twice, running crazily with white-ringed eyes and flecks of foam on his muzzle. Then he stopped abruptly in the doorway, stopped and looked back over his shoulder for a long silent moment. He sniffed delicately.  Steena and Cliff could smell it too now, a thick oily stench which was not the usual odor left by an exploding blaster-shell.  Bat came back, treading daintily across the carpet, almost on the tips of his paws. He raised his head as he passed Steena and then he went confidently beyond to sniff, to sniff and spit twice at the unburned strips of the spaceall. Having thus paid his respects to the late enemy he sat down calmly and set to washing his fur with deliberation. Steena sighed once and dropped into the navigator's seat.  \"Maybe now you'll tell me what in the hell's happened?\" Cliff exploded as he took the blaster out of her hand.  \"Gray,\" she said dazedly, \"it must have been gray--or I couldn't have seen it like that. I'm colorblind, you see. I can see only shades of gray--my whole world is gray. Like Bat's--his world is gray too--all gray. But he's been compensated for he can see above and below our range of color vibrations and--apparently--so can I!\"   Her voice quavered and she raised her chin with a new air Cliff had never seen before--a sort of proud acceptance. She pushed back her wandering hair, but she made no move to imprison it under the heavy net again.  \"That is why I saw the thing when it crossed between us. Against your spaceall it was another shade of gray--an outline. So I put out mine and waited for it to show against that--it was our only chance, Cliff.  \"It was curious at first, I think, and it knew we couldn't see it--which is why it waited to attack. But when Bat's actions gave it away it moved. So I waited to see that flicker against the spaceall and then I let him have it. It's really very simple....\"  Cliff laughed a bit shakily. \"But what _was_ this gray thing? I don't get it.\"  \"I think it was what made the _Empress_ a derelict. Something out of space, maybe, or from another world somewhere.\" She waved her hands. \"It's invisible because it's a color beyond our range of sight. It must have stayed in here all these years. And it kills--it must--when its curiosity is satisfied.\" Swiftly she described the scene in the cabin and the strange behavior of the gem pile which had betrayed the creature to her.  Cliff did not return his blaster to its holder. \"Any more of them on board, d'you think?\" He didn't look pleased at the prospect.  Steena turned to Bat. He was paying particular attention to the space between two front toes in the process of a complete bath. \"I don't think so. But Bat will tell us if there are. He can see them clearly, I believe.\"  But there weren't any more and two weeks later Cliff, Steena and Bat brought the _Empress_ into the Lunar quarantine station. And that is the end of Steena's story because, as we have been told, happy marriages need no chronicles. And Steena had found someone who knew of her gray world and did not find it too hard to share with her--someone besides Bat. It turned out to be a real love match.  The last time I saw her she was wrapped in a flame-red cloak from the looms of Rigel and wore a fortune in Jovan rubies blazing on her wrists. Cliff was flipping a three-figure credit bill to a waiter. And Bat had a row of Vernal juice glasses set up before him. Just a little family party out on the town.       +--------------------------------------------------------------+   |                                                              |   | Transcriber's note:                                          |   |                                                              |   | Inconsistent hyphenation (space-all/spaceall) has been       |   | retained.                                                    |   |                                                              |   +--------------------------------------------------------------+"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29031"],["title","Sir William Herschel: His Life and Works (#0)"],["body","WILLIAM HERSCHEL  HIS LIFE AND WORKS     [Illustration: Sir William Herschel]  SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL   HIS LIFE AND WORKS  BY  EDWARD S.

In the following account of the life and works of Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL, I have been obliged to depend strictly upon data already in print--the _Memoir_ of his sister, his own scientific writings and the memoirs and diaries of his cotemporaries. The review of his published works will, I trust, be of use. It is based upon a careful study of all his papers in the _Philosophical Transactions_ and elsewhere.  A life of HERSCHEL which shall be satisfactory in every particular can only be written after a full examination of the materials which are preserved at the family seat in England; but as two generations have passed since his death, and as no biography yet exists which approaches to completeness, no apology seems to me to be needed for a conscientious attempt to make the best use of the scanty material which we do possess.  This study will, I trust, serve to exhibit so much of his life as belongs to the whole public. His private life belongs to his family, until the time is come to let the world know more of the greatest of practical astronomers and of the inner life of one of its most profound philosophers,--of a great and ardent mind, whose achievements are and will remain the glory of England.

CHAPTER I.  EARLY YEARS; 1738-1772.   Of the great modern philosophers, that one of whom least is known, is WILLIAM HERSCHEL. We may appropriate the words which escaped him when the barren region of the sky near the body of _Scorpio_ was passing slowly through the field of his great reflector, during one of his sweeps, to express our own sense of absence of light and knowledge: _Hier ist wahrhaftig ein Loch im Himmel._  HERSCHEL prepared, about the year 1818, a biographical memorandum, which his sister CAROLINA placed among his papers.  This has never been made public. The only thoroughly authentic sources of information in possession of the world, are a letter written by HERSCHEL himself, in answer to a pressing request for a sketch of his life, and the _Memoir and Correspondence of CAROLINE HERSCHEL_ (London, 1876), a precious memorial not only of his life, but of one which otherwise would have remained almost unknown, and one, too, which the world could ill afford to lose. The latter, which has been ably edited by Mrs. MARY CORNWALLIS HERSCHEL,[1] is the only source of knowledge in regard to the early years of the great astronomer, and together with the all too scanty materials to be gained from a diligent search through the biography of the time, affords the data for those personal details of his life, habits, and character, which seem to complete the distinct, though partial conception of him which the student of his philosophical writings acquires.  The letter referred to was published in the Göttingen Magazine of Science and Literature, III., 4, shortly after the name of HERSCHEL had become familiar to every ear through his discovery of _Uranus_, but while the circumstances of the discovery, and the condition of the amateur who made it, were still entirely unknown.  The editor (LICHTENBERG) says:      \"Herr HERSCHEL was good enough to send me, some time since, through     Herr MAGELLAN, copies of his Dissertations on Double Stars, on the     Parallax of the Fixed Stars, and on a new Micrometer. In the letter     which conveyed to him my thanks for his gift, I requested him to     note down a few facts in regard to his life, for publication in this     magazine, since various accounts, more or less incorrect, had     appeared in several journals. In answer, I received a very obliging     letter from him and what follows is that portion of it relating to     my request, which was sent me with full permission to make it     public.\"                                                   \"DATCHET, NEAR WINDSOR,                                                 _Nov. 15, 1783._      \"I was born in Hanover, November, 1738. My father, who was a     musician, destined me to the same profession, hence I was     instructed betimes in his art. That I might acquire a perfect     knowledge of the theory as well as of the practice of music, I was     set at an early age to study mathematics in all its     branches--algebra, conic sections, infinitesimal analysis, and the     rest.      \"The insatiable desire for knowledge thus awakened resulted next in     a course of languages; I learned French, English, and Latin, and     steadfastly resolved henceforth to devote myself wholly to those     sciences from the pursuit of which I alone looked for all my future     happiness and enjoyment. I have never been either necessitated or     disposed to alter this resolve. My father, whose means were limited,     and who consequently could not be as liberal to his children as he     would have desired, was compelled to dispose of them in one way or     another at an early age; consequently in my fifteenth year I     enlisted in military service, only remaining in the army, however,     until I reached my nineteenth year, when I resigned and went over to     England.      \"My familiarity with the organ, which I had carefully mastered     previously, soon procured for me the position of organist in     Yorkshire, which I finally exchanged for a similar situation at Bath     in 1766, and while here the peculiar circumstances of my post, as     agreeable as it was lucrative, made it possible for me to occupy     myself once more with my studies, especially with mathematics. When,     in the course of time, I took up astronomy, I determined to accept     nothing on faith, but to see with my own eyes everything which     others had seen before me. Having already some knowledge of the     science of optics, I resolved to manufacture my own telescopes, and     after many continuous, determined trials, I finally succeeded in     completing a so-called Newtonian instrument, seven feet in length.     From this I advanced to one of ten feet, and at last to one of     twenty, for I had fully made up my mind to carry on the improvement     of my telescopes as far as it could possibly be done. When I had     carefully and thoroughly perfected the great instrument in all its     parts, I made systematic use of it in my observations of the     heavens, first forming a determination never to pass by any, the     smallest, portion of them without due investigation. This habit,     persisted in, led to the discovery of the new planet (_Georgium     Sidus_). This was by no means the result of chance, but a simple     consequence of the position of the planet on that particular     evening, since it occupied precisely that spot in the heavens which     came in the order of the minute observations that I had previously     mapped out for myself. Had I not seen it just when I did, I must     inevitably have come upon it soon after, since my telescope was so     perfect that I was able to distinguish it from a fixed star in the     first minute of observation.      \"Now to bring this sketch to a close. As the king had expressed a     desire to see my telescope, I took it by his command to Greenwich,     where it was compared with the instruments of my excellent friend,     Dr. MASKELYNE, not only by himself, but by other experts, who     pronounced it as their opinion that my instrument was superior to     all the rest. Thereupon the king ordered that the instrument be     brought to Windsor, and since it there met with marked approval, his     majesty graciously awarded me a yearly pension, that I might be     enabled to relinquish my profession of music, and devote my whole     time to astronomy and the improvement of the telescope. Gratitude,     as well as other considerations specified by me in a paper presented     to the Royal Society, of which I am a member, has induced me to call     the new planet _Georgium Sidus_.          \"'Georgium Sidus.--jam nunc assuesce vocari.'--(_Virgil._)      And I hope it will retain the name.\"  We know but little of the family of HERSCHEL. The name is undoubtedly Jewish, and is found in Poland, Germany, and England. We learn that the ancestors of the present branch left Moravia about the beginning of the XVIIth century, on account of their change of religion to Protestantism. They became possessors of land in Saxony. HANS HERSCHEL, the great-grandfather of WILLIAM, was a brewer in Pirna (a small town near Dresden). Of the two sons of HANS, one, ABRAHAM (born in 1651, died 1718), was employed in the royal gardens at Dresden, and seems to have been a man of taste and skill in his calling. Of his eldest son, EUSEBIUS, there appears to be little trace in the records of the family. The second son, BENJAMIN, died in infancy; the third, ISAAC, was born in 1707 (Jan. 14), and was thus an orphan at eleven years of age. ISAAC was the father of the great astronomer.  He appears to have early had a passionate fondness for music, and this, added to a distaste for his father's calling, determined his career. He was taught music by an oboe-player in the royal band, and he "]]]
