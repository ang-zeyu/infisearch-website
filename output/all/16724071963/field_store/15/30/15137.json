[For example, \"large,\" \"red,\" \"old,\" \"which I received     yesterday.\"]  One Thing may have many Attributes; and one Attribute may belong to many Things.      [Thus, the Thing \"a rose\" may have the Attributes \"red,\"     \"scented,\" \"full-blown,\" &c.; and the Attribute \"red\" may belong     to the Things \"a rose,\" \"a brick,\" \"a ribbon,\" &c.]  Any Attribute, or any Set of Attributes, may be called an '=Adjunct=.'      [This word is introduced in order to avoid the constant     repetition of the phrase \"Attribute or Set of Attributes.\"      Thus, we may say that a rose has the Attribute \"red\" (or the     Adjunct \"red,\" whichever we prefer); or we may say that it has     the Adjunct \"red, scented and full-blown.\"]                                                                     pg001½  CHAPTER II.  _CLASSIFICATION._   'Classification,' or the formation of Classes, is a Mental Process, in which we imagine that we have put together, in a group, certain Things. Such a group is called a '=Class=.'  This Process may be performed in three different ways, as follows:--  (1) We may imagine that we have put together all Things. The Class so formed (i.e. the Class \"Things\") contains the whole Universe.  (2) We may think of the Class \"Things,\" and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the "]]]
