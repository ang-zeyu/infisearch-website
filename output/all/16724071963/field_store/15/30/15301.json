It is beautifully situated on both sides of the Avon, and has many fine walks and public buildings. The aspect of the city is markedly cheerful and brilliant, owing to the nature of the white stone of which the principal houses are built, and to the exquisite amphitheatre of hills in which they lie.  The society was then gay and polite, and HERSCHEL was at once thrown into a far more intelligent atmosphere than that he had just left in Yorkshire. It was easy to get new books, to see new faces, to hear new things. The Assembly Rooms (built in 1771) were noted for their size and elegance; the theatre was the best out of London.  His position as organist of the fashionable chapel placed him in the current. His charming and engaging manners made him friends. His talents brought him admirers and pupils, and pupils brought him money.[7]  He began in 1766 a life of unceasing activity, which continued. In 1768 he published in London a symphony (in C) for two violins, viola, bass, two oboes, and two horns, and in the same year two military concertos for two oboes, two horns, two trumpets, and two bassoons.[8] He wrote pieces for the harp, glees, \"catches,\" and other songs for the voice. One of these, the _Echo Catch_, was published and had even considerable vogue.      A competent musical critic writes to me of this work: \"The     counterpoint is clear and flowing, and is managed with considerable     taste and effect. It would be difficult to explain the great     cleverness shown in the construction of the _Catch_ without diagrams     to illustrate the movements of the parts. It is certainly an     ingenious bit of musical writing.\"  When he left Bath (in 1782), many of these musical writings were lost, in his great haste to take up his new profession. One, specially, his sister remembers to have written out for the printer, \"but he could not find a moment to send it off, nor answer the printer's letters.\" This was a four-part song, \"In thee I bear so dear a part.\" He wrote very many anthems, chants, and psalm-tunes for the excellent cathedral choir of the Octagon Chapel. Unfortunately, most of this music is now not to be found.  A notice of HERSCHEL'S life which appeared in the _European Magazine_ for 1785, January, gives a very lively picture of his life at this time, and it is especially valuable as showing how he appeared to his cotemporaries.      \"Although Mr. HERSCHEL loved music to an excess, and made a     considerable progress in it, he yet determined with a sort of     enthusiasm to devote every moment he could spare from business to     the pursuit of knowledge, which he regarded as the sovereign good,     and in which he resolved to place all his views of future happiness     in life.\". . .      \"His situation at the Octagon Chapel proved a very profitable one,     as he soon fell into all the public business of the concerts, the     Rooms, the Theatre, and the oratorios, besides many scholars and     private concerts. This great run of business, instead of lessening     his propensity to study, increased it, so that many times, after a     fatiguing day of fourteen or sixteen hours spent in his vocation, he     would retire at night with the greatest avidity to _unbend the     mind_, if it may be so called, with a few propositions in     MACLAURIN'S _Fluxions_, or other books of that sort.\"  It was in these years that he mastered Italian and made some progress in Greek.      \"We may hazard a natural conjecture respecting the course of     HERSCHEL'S early studies. Music conducted him to mathematics, or,     in other words, impelled him to study SMITH'S _Harmonics_. Now this     ROBERT SMITH was the author of _A Complete System of Optics_,     a masterly work, which, notwithstanding the rapid growth of that     branch of the science, is not yet wholly superseded. It seems to us     not unlikely that HERSCHEL, studying the _Harmonics_, conceived a     reverence for the author, who was at that time still living, so that     from the _Philosophy of Music_ he passed to the _Optics_, a work on     which SMITH'S great reputation chiefly rested; and thus undesignedly     prepared himself for the career on which he was shortly about to     enter with so much glory.\"[9]  There is no doubt that this conjecture is a true one. The _Optics_ of Dr. SMITH is one of the very few books quoted by HERSCHEL throughout his writings, and there is every evidence of his complete familiarity with its conclusions and methods; and this familiarity is of the kind which a student acquires with his early text-books. One other work he quotes in the same way, LALANDE'S _Astronomy_, and this too must have been deeply studied.  During the years 1765-1772, while HERSCHEL was following his profession and his studies at Bath, the family life at Hanover went on in much the same way.  In 1765 his father ISAAC had a stroke of paralysis, which ended his violin-playing forever, and forced him to depend entirely upon pupils and copying of music for a livelihood. He died on March 22, 1767, leaving behind him a good name, and living in the affectionate remembrance of his children and of all who knew him.  CAROLINA had now lost her best friend, and transferred to her brother WILLIAM the affection she had before divided between him and her father.      \"My father wished to give me something like a polished education,     but my mother was particularly determined that it should be a rough,     but at the same time a useful one; and nothing farther she thought     was necessary but to send me two or three months to a sempstress to     be taught to make household linen. . . . My mother would not consent     to my being taught French, and my brother Dietrich was even denied a     dancing-master, because she would not permit my learning along with     him, though the entrance had been paid for us both; so all my father     could do for me was to indulge me (and please himself) sometimes     with a short lesson on the violin, when my mother was either in     good humor or out of the way. Though I have often felt myself     exceedingly at a loss for the want of those few accomplishments of     which I was thus, by an erroneous though well-meant opinion of my     mother, deprived, I could not help thinking but that she had cause     for wishing me not to know more than was necessary for being useful     in the family; for it was her certain belief that my brother WILLIAM     would have returned to his country, and my eldest brother not have     looked so high, if they had had a little less learning.            *       *       *       *       *      But sometimes I found it scarcely possible to get through with the     work required, and felt very unhappy that no time at all was left     for improving myself in music or fancy work, in which I had an     opportunity of receiving some instruction from an ingenious young     woman whose parents lived in the same house with us. But the time     wanted for spending a few hours together could only be obtained by     our meeting at daybreak, because by the time of the family's rising     at seven, I was obliged to be at my daily business. Though I had     neither time nor means for producing anything immediately either for     show or use, I was content with keeping samples of all possible     patterns in needlework, beads, bugles, horse-hair, etc., for I could     not help feeling troubled sometimes about my future destiny; yet I     could not bear the idea of being turned into an Abigail or     housemaid, and thought that with the above and such like     acquirements, with a little notion of music, I might obtain a place     as governess in some family where the want of a knowledge of French     would be no objection.\"  A change was soon to come in her life too; her brother WILLIAM wrote to propose that she should join him at Bath--      . . . \"to make the trial, if, by his instruction, I might not become     a useful singer for his winter concerts and oratorios; he advised my     brother JACOB to give me some lessons by way of beginning; but that     if, after a trial of two years, we should not find it answer our     expectation, he would bring me back again. This at first seemed to     be agreeable to all parties, but by the time I had set my heart upon     this change in my situation, JACOB began to turn the whole scheme     into ridicule, and, of course, he never heard the sound of my voice     except in speaking, and yet I was left in the harassing uncertainty     whether I was to go or not. I resolved at last to prepare, as far as     lay in my power, for both cases, by taking, in the first place,     every opportunity, when all were from home, to imitate, with a gag     between my teeth, the solo parts of concertos, _shake and all_, such     as I had heard them play on the violin; in consequence I had gained     a tolerable execution before I knew how to sing. I next began to     knit ruffles, which were intended for my brother WILLIAM, in case I     remained at home--else they were to be JACOB'S. For my mother and     brother D. I knitted as many cotton stockings as would last two     years at least.\"  In August, 1772, her brother arrived at Hanover, to take her back to England with him. The journey to London was made between August 16th and 26th, and soon after they went together to HERSCHEL'S house, No. 7 New King's Street, Bath.

It was to a busy life in Bath that HERSCHEL took his sister CAROLINA, then twenty-two years old. She was a perfectly untried girl, of very small accomplishments and outwardly with but little to attract. The basis of her character was the possibility of an unchanging devotion to one object; for the best years of her life this object was the happiness and success of her brother WILLIAM, whom she profoundly loved. Her love was headstrong and full of a kind of obstinate pride, which refused to see anything but the view she had adopted. As long as her life continued to be with her dearest brother, all was well with her. She had a noble aim, and her heart was more than full. Later on, this very singleness of character brought her other years of wretchedness. It is necessary to understand the almost spaniel-like allegiance she gave, in order to comprehend the value which her services were to HERSCHEL. She supplied him with an aid which was utterly loyal, entire, and devoted. Her obedience was unquestioning, her reverence amounted almost to adoration. In their relation, he gave everything in the way of incentive and initiative, and she returned her entire effort loyally.  At first her business was to gain a knowledge of the language, and to perfect herself in singing, so that she might become a soloist in the concerts and oratorios which he was constantly giving.  In the beginning it was not easy.      . . . \"As the season for the arrival of visitors to the baths does     not begin till October, my brother had leisure to try my capacity for     becoming a useful singer for his concerts and oratorios, and being     very well satisfied with my voice, I had two or three lessons every     day, and the hours which were not spent at the harpsichord, were     employed in putting me in the way of managing the family. . . .     On the second morning, on meeting my brother at breakfast, he began     immediately to give me a lesson in English and arithmetic, and     showed me the way of booking and keeping accounts of cash received     and laid out. . . . By way of relaxation we talked of astronomy and     the bright constellations with which I had made acquaintance during     the fine nights we spent on the postwagen travelling through Holland.      \"My brother ALEXANDER, who had been some time in England, boarded     and lodged with his elder brother, and, with myself, occupied the     attic. The first floor, which was furnished in the newest and most     handsome style, my brother kept for himself. The front room,     containing the harpsichord, was always in order to receive his     musical friends and scholars at little private concerts or     rehearsals. . . . Sundays I received a sum for the weekly expenses,     of which my housekeeping book (written in English) showed the amount     laid out, and my purse the remaining cash. One of the principal     things required was to market, and about six weeks after coming to     England I was sent alone among fishwomen, butchers, basket-women,     etc., and I brought home whatever in my fright I could pick up. . . .     My brother ALEX., who was now returned from his summer engagement,     used to watch me at a distance, unknown to me, till he saw me safe     on my way home. But all attempts to introduce any order in our     little household proved vain, owing to the servant my brother then     had. And what still further increased my difficulty was, that my     brother's time was entirely taken up with business, so that I only     saw him at meals. Breakfast was at seven o'clock or before--much too     early for me, who would rather have remained up all night than be     obliged to rise at so early an hour. . . .      \"The three winter months passed on very heavily. I had to struggle     against _heimwehe_ (home sickness) and low spirits, and to answer my     sister's melancholy letters on the death of her husband, by which     she became a widow with six children. I knew too little English to     derive any consolation from the society of those who were about me,     so that, dinner-time excepted, I was entirely left to myself.\"  So the winter passed.      \"The time when I could hope to receive a little more of my brother's     instruction and attention was now drawing near; for after Easter,     Bath becomes very empty, only a few of his scholars, whose families     were resident in the neighborhood, remaining. But I was greatly     disappointed; for, in consequence of the harassing and fatiguing     life he had led during the winter months, he used to retire to bed     with a basin of milk or glass of water, and SMITH'S _Harmonics_ and     _Optics_, FERGUSON'S _Astronomy_, etc., and so went to sleep buried     under his favorite authors; and his first thoughts on rising were     how to obtain instruments for viewing those objects himself of which     he had been reading. There being in one of the shops a     two-and-a-half-foot Gregorian telescope to be let, it was for some     time taken in requisition, and served not only for viewing the     heavens, but for making experiments on its construction. . . . It soon     appeared that my brother was not contented with knowing what former     observers had seen, for he began to contrive a telescope eighteen or     twenty feet long (I believe after HUYGHENS' description). . . . I was     much hindered in my musical practice by my help being continually     wanted in the execution of the various contrivances, and I had to     amuse myself with making the tube of pasteboard for the glasses,     which were to arrive from London, for at that time no optician had     settled at Bath. But when all was finished, no one besides my     brother could get a glimpse of Jupiter or Saturn, for the great     length of the tube would not allow it to be kept in a straight line.     This difficulty, however, was soon removed by substituting tin     tubes. . . . My brother wrote to inquire the price of a reflecting     mirror for (I believe) a five or six foot telescope. The answer was,     there were none of so large a size, but a person offered to make one     at a price much above what my brother thought proper to give. . . .     About this time he bought of a Quaker, resident at Bath, who had     formerly made attempts at polishing mirrors, all his rubbish of     patterns, tools, hones, polishers, unfinished mirrors, etc., but all     for small Gregorians, and none above two or three inches diameter.      \"But nothing serious could be attempted, for want of time, till the     beginning of June, when some of my brother's scholars were leaving     Bath; and then, to my sorrow, I saw almost every room turned into a     workshop. A cabinet-maker making a tube and stands of all     descriptions in a handsomely furnished drawing-room; ALEX. putting     up a huge turning machine (which he had brought in the autumn from     Bristol, where he used to spend the summer) in a bedroom, for     turning patterns, grinding glasses, and turning eye-pieces, etc. At     the same time music durst not lie entirely dormant during the     summer, and my brother had frequent rehearsals at home, where Miss     FARINELLI, an Italian singer, was met by several of the principal     performers he had engaged for the winter concerts.\"  Finally, in 1774, he had made himself a Gregorian telescope,[10] and had begun to view the heavens. He was then thirty-six years old.  The writer in the _European Magazine_ describes this period:      \"All this time he continued his astronomical observations, and     nothing now seemed wanting to complete his felicity, but sufficient     leisure to enjoy his telescopes, to which he was so much attached,     that at the theatre he used frequently to run from the harpsichord     to look at the stars, during the time between the acts.\"  In an extract from his _Journal No. 1_, now at the rooms of the Royal Society, may be seen a copy of his first observation of the Nebula of _Orion_, on March 4, 1774. This was made with his five-and-a-half-foot Gregorian reflector.  It was at this time (1775), between the acts of the theatre, that he made his first review of the heavens, with a Newtonian telescope, of an aperture of four and a half inches and a magnifying power of 222 times. This telescope was one of the first made by himself. The review consisted of the examination of every star in the sky of the first, second, third, and fourth magnitudes, and of all planets visible. There are no records of these observations now extant, and they are noteworthy only as a preparation for more serious work.  He was carrying out his resolve to see everything for himself. His assiduity may be judged of by the fact that between 1774 and 1781 HERSCHEL had observed a single object--the Nebula of _Orion_--no less than fourteen times.  The success of his first telescopes incited him to new efforts. His house became a complete _atelier_, where everything that could tend to excellence in this manufacture was tried and re-tried a hundred different ways. When a difficulty arose, experiments were begun which continued till it was conquered. When a success was gained, it was prosecuted to the utmost.  In 1775 the first seven-foot reflector was made, in 1777 a ten-foot was finished, in 1778 a \"very good\" ten-foot took its place. It must not be thought that the telescopes mentioned were the only ones completed. On the contrary, they were but the best"]]]
