But I do not     think my brother ever accepted pecuniary assistance from any one of     his friends, and on this occasion he declined the offer by saying it     was paid for already.      \"Among the Bath visitors were many philosophical gentlemen who used     to frequent the lev√©es at St. James's, when in town. Colonel WALSH,     in particular, informed my brother that from a conversation he had     had with His Majesty, it appeared that in the spring he was to come     with his seven-foot telescope to the king. Similar reports he     received from many others, but they made no great impression nor     caused any interruption in his occupation or study, and as soon as     the season for the concerts was over, and the mould, etc., in     readiness, a day was set apart for casting, and the metal was in the     furnace. Unfortunately it began to leak at the moment when ready for     pouring, and both my brothers and the caster, with his men, were     obliged to run out at opposite doors, for the stone flooring (which     ought to have been taken up) flew about in all directions as high as     the ceiling. Before the second casting was attempted, everything     which could insure success had been attended to, and a very perfect     metal was found in the mould.      \"But a total stop and derangement now took place, and nearly six or     seven months elapsed before my brother could return to the     undisturbed enjoyment of his instruments and observations. For one     morning in Passion Week, as Sir WILLIAM WATSON was with my brother,     talking about the pending journey to town, my eldest nephew arrived     to pay us a visit, and brought the confirmation that his uncle was     expected with his instrument in town. . . . We had not one night in     the week, except Friday, but what was set apart for an oratorio either     at Bath or Bristol. Soon after Easter, a new organ being erected in     St. James's Church, it was opened with two performances of the     'Messiah;' this again took up some of my brother's time.\". . .  In May of 1782 HERSCHEL went to London.      \"But when almost double the time had elapsed which my brother could     safely be absent from his scholars, ALEX., as well as myself, were     much at a loss how to answer their inquiries, for, from the letters     we received, we could learn nothing but that he had been introduced     to the king and queen, and had permission to come to the concerts at     Buckingham House, where the king conversed with him about     astronomy.\"  It was during his absence at this time that the three following letters were written and received:      \"DEAR LINA:--      \"I have had an audience of His Majesty this morning, and met with a     very gracious reception. I presented him with the drawing of the     solar system, and had the honor of explaining it to him and the     queen. My telescope is in three weeks' time to go to Richmond, and     meanwhile to be put up at Greenwich, where I shall accordingly carry     it to-day. So you see, LINA, that you must not think of seeing me in     less than a month. I shall write to Miss LEE myself; and other     scholars who inquire for me, you may tell that I cannot wait on them     till His Majesty shall be pleased to give me leave to return, or     rather to dismiss me, for till then I must attend. I will also write     to Mr. PALMER to acquaint him with it.      \"I am in a great hurry, therefore can write no more at present.     Tell ALEXANDER that everything looks very likely as if I were to stay     here. The king inquired after him, and after my great speculum. He     also gave me leave to come to hear the GRIESBACHS play at the     private concert which he has every evening. My having seen the king     need not be kept a secret, but about my staying here it will be best     not to say anything, but only that I must remain here till His     Majesty has observed the planets with my telescope.      \"Yesterday I dined with Colonel WALSH, who inquired after you. There     were Mr. AUBERT and Dr. MASKELYNE. Dr. MASKELYNE in public declared     his obligations to me for having introduced to them the high powers,     for Mr. AUBERT has so much succeeded with them that he says he looks     down upon 200, 300, or 400 with contempt, and immediately begins     with 800. He has used 2,500 very completely, and seen my fine double     stars with them. All my papers are printing, with the postscript and     all, and are allowed to be very valuable. You see, LINA, I tell you     all these things. You know vanity is not my foible, therefore I need     not fear your censure. Farewell.                     \"I am, your affectionate brother,                                             \"WM. HERSCHEL.       \"Saturday Morning,           \"probably _May 25, 1782_.\"                      TO MISS HERSCHEL.                                      \"Monday Evening, _June 3, 1782._      \"DEAR LINA:--      \"I pass my time between Greenwich and London agreeably enough,     but am rather at a loss for work that I like. Company is not always     pleasing, and I would much rather be polishing a speculum. Last     Friday I was at the king's concert to hear GEORGE play. The king     spoke to me as soon as he saw me, and kept me in conversation for     half an hour. He asked GEORGE to play a solo-concerto on purpose     that I might hear him; and GEORGE plays extremely well, is very much     improved, and the king likes him very much. These two last nights I     have been star-gazing at Greenwich with Dr. MASKELYNE and Mr.     AUBERT. We have compared our telescopes together, and mine was found     very superior to any of the Royal Observatory. Double stars which     they could not see with their instruments I had the pleasure to show     them very plainly, and my mechanism is so much approved of that     Dr. MASKELYNE has already ordered a model to be taken from mine,     and a stand to be made by it to his reflector. He is, however, now     so much out of love with his instrument that he begins to doubt     whether it _deserves_ a new stand.      \"I am introduced to the best company. To-morrow I dine at Lord     PALMERSTON'S, next day with Sir JOSEPH BANKS, etc., etc. Among     opticians and astronomers nothing now is talked of but _what they     call_ my great discoveries. Alas! this shows how far they are     behind, when such trifles as I have seen and done are called     _great_. Let me but get at it again! I will make such telescopes,     and see such things--that is, I will endeavor to do so.\"                            TO MISS HERSCHEL.                                                       \"_July 3, 1782._\"      \"DEAR CAROLINA:--      \"I have been so much employed that you will not wonder at my not     writing sooner. The letter you sent me last Monday came very safe to     me. As Dr. WATSON has been so good as to acquaint you and ALEXANDER     with my situation, I was still more easy in my silence to you. Last     night the King, the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal,     Princess SOPHIA, Princess AUGUSTA, etc., Duke of MONTAGUE, Dr.     HEBERDEN, M. DE LUC, etc., etc., saw my telescope, and it was a very     fine evening. My instrument gave general satisfaction. The king has     very good eyes, and enjoys observations with telescopes exceedingly.      \"This evening, as the king and queen are gone to Kew, the princesses     were desirous of seeing my telescope, but wanted to know if it was     possible to see without going out on the grass, and were much     pleased when they heard that my telescope could be carried into any     place they liked best to have it. About eight o'clock it was moved     into the queen's apartments, and we waited some time in hopes of     seeing _Jupiter_ or _Saturn_. Meanwhile I showed the princesses, and     several other ladies who were present, the speculum, the     micrometers, the movements of the telescopes, and other things that     seemed to excite their curiosity. When the evening appeared to be     totally unpromising, I proposed an artificial _Saturn_ as an object,     since we could not have the real one. I had beforehand prepared this     little piece, as I guessed by the appearance of the weather in the     afternoon we should have no stars to look at. This being accepted     with great pleasure, I had the lamps lighted up which illuminated     the picture of a _Saturn_ (cut out in pasteboard) at the bottom of     the garden wall. The effect was fine, and so natural that the best     astronomer might have been deceived. Their royal highnesses and     other ladies seemed to be much pleased with the artifice.      \"I remained in the queen's apartment with the ladies till about half     after ten; when in conversation with them I found them extremely     well instructed in every subject that was introduced, and they     seemed to be most amiable characters. To-morrow evening they hope to     have better luck, and nothing will give me greater happiness than to     be able to show them some of those beautiful objects with which the     heavens are so gloriously ornamented.\"  CAROLINA'S diary goes on:      \"Sir WILLIAM WATSON returned to Bath after a fort-night or three     weeks' stay. From him we heard that my brother was invited to     Greenwich with the telescope, where he was met by a numerous party     of astronomical and learned gentlemen, and trials of his instrument     were made. In these letters he complained of being obliged to lead     an idle life, having nothing to do but to pass between London and     Greenwich. Sir WILLIAM received many letters, which he was so kind     as to communicate to us. By these, and from those to ALEXANDER or to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29031"],["title","Sir William Herschel: His Life and Works (#8)"],["body","e, we learned that the king wished to see the telescope at Windsor.     At last a letter, dated July 2, arrived from THERESE, and from this     and several succeeding ones we gathered that the king would not     suffer my brother to return to his profession again, and by his     writing several times for a supply of money we could only suppose     that he himself was in uncertainty about the time of his return.      \"In the last week of July my brother came home, and immediately     prepared for removing to Datchet, where he had taken a house with a     garden and grass-plat annexed, quite suitable for the purpose of an     observing-place. Sir WILLIAM WATSON spent nearly the whole time at     our house, and he was not the only friend who truly grieved at my     brother's going from Bath; or feared his having perhaps agreed to no     very advantageous offers; their fears were, in fact, not without     reason. . . . The prospect of entering again on the toils of teaching,     etc., which awaited my brother at home (the months of leisure being     now almost gone by), appeared to him an intolerable waste of time,     and by way of alternative he chose to be royal astronomer, with a     salary of ¬£200 a year. Sir WILLIAM WATSON was the only one to whom     the sum was mentioned, and he exclaimed, 'Never bought monarch honor     so cheap!' To every other inquirer, my brother's answer was that the     king had provided for him.\"  On the 1st of August, 1782, the family removed to Datchet. The last musical duty was performed on Whit-Sunday, 1782, in St. Margaret's Chapel, Bath, when the anthem for the day was of HERSCHEL'S own composition.  The end of the introductory epoch of his life is reached. Henceforth he lived in his observatory, and from his forty-fourth year onwards he only left it for short periods to go to London to submit his classic memoirs to the Royal Society. Even for these occasions he chose periods of moonlight, when no observations could be made.  He was a private man no longer. Henceforth he belongs to the whole world.  FOOTNOTES:  [10] Probably on the model of one of SHORT'S Gregorian telescopes, which were then the best instruments of the kind.  [11] For a description of the main points of HERSCHEL'S processes of making reflectors, which will illustrate his strong mechanical talents, see _Encyclop√¶dia Britannica_, eighth edition, article _Telescope_.  [12] These have never been published, nor is it likely at this day, when our measuring instruments are so greatly improved, that they would be of any material value to science, although of interest as giving the proofs of HERSCHEL'S assiduity and skill. He was always more than the maker of telescopes, for he was never content until they were applied to the problems of astronomy.  [13] ARAGO has implied that if HERSCHEL had directed his telescope to _Uranus_ only eleven days earlier than he did, this discovery would have escaped him, since at that time (March 2, 1781) the planet was at its _station_, and had no motion relative to the star. This is an entire misconception, since the new planet was detected by its physical appearance, and not by its motion. Does any one suppose that \"a new and singular star\" like this would have been once viewed and then forgotten?  [14] Four of _Jupiter_, one of the earth, and one of _Saturn_.  [15] JOHN MICHELL had been a member of the Royal Society since 1760: he died in 1793. He was a philosophical thinker, as is shown by his memoirs on the distances of the stars, and by his invention of the method for determining the earth's density. It is not certain that he was personally known to HERSCHEL, although his writings were familiar to the latter.  ALEXANDER WILSON was Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow, and is chiefly known to us by his theory of the nature of the solar spots, which was adopted and enlarged by HERSCHEL. He died in 1786; but the families of WILSON and HERSCHEL remained close friends.  [16] _Berliner Jahrbuch_, 1784, p. 211. In the _Connaissance des Tems_ for 1784 he is called \"HOROCHELLE.\"  [17] At the presentation Sir JOSEPH BANKS, the President of the Royal Society, said: \"In the name of the Royal Society I present to you this gold medal, the reward which they have assigned to your successful labors, and I exhort you to continue diligently to cultivate those fields of science which have produced to you a harvest of so much honor. Your attention to the improvement of telescopes has already amply repaid the labor which you have bestowed upon them; but the treasures of the heavens are well known to be inexhaustible. Who can say but your new star, which exceeds _Saturn_ in its distance from the sun, may exceed him as much in magnificence of attendance? Who knows what new rings, new satellites, or what other nameless and numberless phenomena remain behind, waiting to reward future industry and improvement?\"                                  CHAPTER III.              LIFE AT DATCHET, CLAY HALL, AND SLOUGH; 1782-1822.   The new house at Datchet, which was occupied from 1782 till 1785, was a source of despair to CAROLINA HERSCHEL, who looked upon its desolate and isolated condition with a housekeeper's eyes. This was nothing to her brother, who gayly consented to live upon \"eggs and bacon,\" now that he was free at last to mind the heavens. The ruinous state of the place had no terrors in his eyes, for was there not a laundry which would serve as a library, a large stable which was just the place for the grinding of mirrors, and a grass-plat for the small twenty-foot reflector?  Here they set to work at astronomy; the brother with the twenty-foot, the sister aiding him, and at odd times sweeping for comets. In the course of her life she discovered no less than eight, and five of these were first seen by her.         *       *       *       *       *  In 1787 HERSCHEL wrote his paper \"On three Volcanoes in the Moon,\" which he had observed in April of that year. In this he mentions previous observations of the same sort. I do not remember that the following account of these has ever been put on record in English. Baron VON ZACH writes from London to BODE:[18]      \"Probably you have heard also of the volcanoes in the moon, which     HERSCHEL has observed. . . . I will give you an account of it as I     heard it from his own lips. Dr. LIND, a worthy physician in Windsor,     who has made himself known through his two journeys in China, and     who is a friend of our HERSCHEL'S, was with his wife one evening on     a visit to HERSCHEL in Datchet [1783, May 4]. On this evening there     was to be an occultation of a star at the moon's dark limb. This was     observed by HERSCHEL and Doctor LIND. Mrs. LIND wished also to see     what was occurring, and placed herself at a telescope and watched     attentively.      \"Scarcely had the star disappeared before Mrs. LIND thought she saw     it again, and exclaimed that the star had gone in front of, and not     behind the moon. This provoked a short astronomical lecture on the     question, but still she would not credit it, because she _saw_     differently. Finally HERSCHEL stepped to the telescope, and in fact     he saw a bright point on the dark disc of the moon, which he     followed attentively. It gradually became fainter and finally     vanished.\". . .  The life at Datchet was not free from its annoyances.      \"Much of my brother's time was taken up in going, when the evenings     were clear, to the queen's lodge, to show the king, etc., objects     through the seven-foot. But when the days began to shorten, this was     found impossible, for the telescope was often (at no small expense     and risk of damage) obliged to be transported in the dark back to     Datchet, for the purpose of spending the rest of the night with     observations on double stars for a second catalogue. My brother was,     besides, obliged to be absent for a week or ten days, for the     purpose of bringing home the metal of the cracked thirty-foot     mirror, and the remaining materials from his work-room. Before the     furnace was taken down at Bath, a second twenty-foot mirror, twelve     inches diameter, was cast, which happened to be very fortunate, for     on the 1st of January, 1783, a very fine one cracked by frost in the     tube.      . . . \"In my brother's absence from home I was, of course, left alone     to amuse myself with my own thoughts, which were anything but     cheerful. I found I was to be trained for an assistant astronomer,     and, by way of encouragement, a telescope adapted for 'sweeping,'     consisting of a tube with two glasses, such as are commonly used in     a 'finder,' was given me. I was 'to sweep for comets,' and I see, by     my journal, that I began August 22d, 1782, to write down and     describe all remarkable appearances I saw in my 'sweeps,' which were     horizontal. But it was not till the last two months of the same year     that I felt the least encouragement to spend the star-light nights     on a grass-plot covered with dew or hoar-frost, without a human     being near enough to be within call. I knew too little of the real     heavens to be able to point out every object so as to find it again,     without losing much time by consulting the Atlas. But all these     troubles were removed when I knew my brother to be at no great     distance making observations, with his various instruments, on     double stars, planets, etc., and when I could have his assistance     immediately if I found a nebula or cluster of stars, of which I     intended to give a catalogue; but, at the end of 1783, I had only     marked fourteen, when my sweeping was interrupted by being employed     to write down my brother's observations with the large twenty-foot.     I had, however, the comfort to see that my brother was satisfied     with my endeavors to assist him when he wanted another person either     to run to the clocks, write down a memorandum, fetch"]]]
