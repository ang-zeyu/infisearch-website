He has been dead just two centuries, now, this ignorant man from the Middle West, this Founder. The tragedy is that the authorities of the time acted too slowly. They allowed him to speak, to get his message across. He was allowed to preach, to start his cult. And once such a thing is under way, there's no stopping it.  \"But what if he had died before he preached? What if none of his doctrines had ever been spoken? It took only a moment for him to utter them, that we know. They say he spoke just once, just one time. _Then_ the authorities came, taking him away. He offered no resistance; the incident was small.\"  The Speaker turned to Conger.  \"Small, but we're reaping the consequences of it today.\"  They went inside the building. Inside, the soldiers had already laid out the skeleton on a table. The soldiers stood around it, their young faces intense.  Conger went over to the table, pushing past them. He bent down, staring at the bones. \"So these are his remains,\" he murmured. \"The Founder. The Church has hidden them for two centuries.\"  \"Quite so,\" the Speaker said. \"But now we have them. Come along down the hall.\"  They went across the room to a door. The Speaker pushed it open. Technicians looked up. Conger saw machinery, whirring and turning; benches and retorts. In the center of the room was a gleaming crystal cage.  The Speaker handed a Slem-gun to Conger. \"The important thing to remember is that the skull must be saved and brought back--for comparison and proof. Aim low--at the chest.\"  Conger weighed the gun in his hands. \"It feels good,\" he said. \"I know this gun--that is, I've seen them before, but I never used one.\"  The Speaker nodded. \"You will be instructed on the use of the gun and the operation of the cage. You will be given all data we have on the time and location. The exact spot was a place called Hudson's field. About 1960 in a small community outside Denver, Colorado. And don't forget--the only means of identification you will have will be the skull. There are visible characteristics of the front teeth, especially the left incisor--\"  Conger listened absently. He was watching two men in white carefully wrapping the skull in a plastic bag. They tied it and carried it into the crystal cage. \"And if I should make a mistake?\"  \"Pick the wrong man? Then find the right one. Don't come back until you succeed in reaching this Founder. And you can't wait for him to start speaking; that's what we must avoid! You must act in advance. Take chances; shoot as soon as you think you've found him. He'll be someone unusual, probably a stranger in the area. Apparently he wasn't known.\"  Conger listened dimly.  \"Do you think you have it all now?\" the Speaker asked.  \"Yes. I think so.\" Conger entered the crystal cage and sat down, placing his hands on the wheel.  \"Good luck,\" the Speaker said.  \"We'll be awaiting the outcome. There's some philosophical doubt as to whether one can alter the past. This should answer the question once and for all.\"  Conger fingered the controls of the cage.  \"By the way,\" the Speaker said. \"Don't try to use this cage for purposes not anticipated in your job. We have a constant trace on it. If we want it back, we can get it back. Good luck.\"  Conger said nothing. The cage was sealed. He raised his finger and touched the wheel control. He turned the wheel carefully.  He was still staring at the plastic bag when the room outside vanished.  For a long time there was nothing at all. Nothing beyond the crystal mesh of the cage. Thoughts rushed through Conger's mind, helter-skelter. How would he know the man? How could he be certain, in advance? What had he looked like? What was his name? How had he acted, before he spoke? Would he be an ordinary person, or some strange outlandish crank?  Conger picked up the Slem-gun and held it against his cheek. The metal of the gun was cool and smooth. He practiced moving the sight. It was a beautiful gun, the kind of gun he could fall in love with. If he had owned such a gun in the Martian desert--on the long nights when he had lain, cramped and numbed with cold, waiting for things that moved through the darkness--  He put the gun down and adjusted the meter readings of the cage. The spiraling mist was beginning to condense and settle. All at once forms wavered and fluttered around him.  Colors, sounds, movements filtered through the crystal wire. He clamped the controls off and stood up.         *       *       *       *       *  He was on a ridge overlooking a small town. It was high noon. The air was crisp and bright. A few automobiles moved along a road. Off in the distance were some level fields. Conger went to the door and stepped outside. He sniffed the air. Then he went back into the cage.  He stood before the mirror over the shelf, examining his features. He had trimmed his beard--they had not got him to cut it off--and his hair was neat. He was dressed in the clothing of the middle-twentieth century, the odd collar and coat, the shoes of animal hide. In his pocket was money of the times. That was important. Nothing more was needed.  Nothing, except his ability, his special cunning. But he had never used it in such a way before.  He walked down the road toward the town.  The first things he noticed were the newspapers on the stands. April 5, 1961. He was not too far off. He looked around him. There was a filling station, a garage, some taverns, and a ten-cent store. Down the street was a grocery store and some public buildings.  A few minutes later he mounted the stairs of the little public library and passed through the doors into the warm interior.  The librarian looked up, smiling.  \"Good afternoon,\" she said.  He smiled, not speaking because his words would not be correct; accented and strange, probably. He went over to a table and sat down by a heap of magazines. For a moment he glanced through them. Then he was on his feet again. He crossed the room to a wide rack against the wall. His heart began to beat heavily.  Newspapers--weeks on end. He took a roll of them over to the table and began to scan them quickly. The print was odd, the letters strange. Some of the words were unfamiliar.  He set the papers aside and searched farther. At last he found what he wanted. He carried the _Cherrywood Gazette_ to the table and opened it to the first page. He found what he wanted:      PRISONER HANGS SELF      An unidentified man, held by the county sheriff's office for     suspicion of criminal syndicalism, was found dead this morning, by--  He finished the item. It was vague, uninforming. He needed more. He carried the _Gazette_ back to the racks and then, after a moment's hesitation, approached the librarian.  \"More?\" he asked. \"More papers. Old ones?\"  She frowned. \"How old? Which papers?\"  \"Months old. And--before.\"  \"Of the _Gazette_? This is all we have. What did you want? What are you looking for? Maybe I can help you.\"  He was silent.  \"You might find older issues at the _Gazette_ office,\" the woman said, taking off her glasses. \"Why don't you try there? But if you'd tell me, maybe I could help you--\"  He went out.  The _Gazette_ office was down a side street; the sidewalk was broken and cracked. He went inside. A heater glowed in the corner of the small office. A heavy-set man stood up and came slowly over to the counter.  \"What did you want, mister?\" he said.  \"Old papers. A month. Or more.\"  \"To buy? You want to buy them?\"  \"Yes.\" He held out some of the money he had. The man stared.  \"Sure,\" he said. \"Sure. Wait a minute.\" He went quickly out of the room. When he came back he was staggering under the weight of his armload, his face red. \"Here are some,\" he grunted. \"Took what I could find. Covers the whole year. And if you want more--\"  Conger carried the papers outside. He sat down by the road and began to go through them.         *       *       *       *       *  What he wanted was four months back, in December. It was a tiny item, so small that he almost missed it. His hands trembled as he scanned it, using the small dictionary for some of the archaic terms.      MAN ARRESTED FOR UNLICENSED DEMONSTRATION      An unidentified man who refused to give his name was picked up in     Cooper Creek by special agents of the sheriff's office, according to     Sheriff Duff. It was said the man was recently noticed in this area     and had been watched continually. It was--  Cooper Creek. December, 1960. His heart pounded. That was all he needed to know. He stood up, shaking himself, stamping his feet on the cold ground. The sun had moved across the sky to the very edge of the hills. He smiled. Already he had discovered the exact time and place. Now he needed only to go back, perhaps to November, to Cooper Creek--  He walked back through the main section of town, past the library, past the grocery store. It would not be hard; the hard part was over. He would go there; rent a room, prepare to wait until the man appeared.  He turned the corner. A woman was coming out of a doorway, loaded down with packages. Conger stepped aside to let her pass. The woman glanced at him. Suddenly her face turned white. She stared, her mouth open.  Conger hurried on. He looked back. What was wrong with her? The woman was still staring; she had dropped the packages to the ground. He increased his speed. He turned a second corner and went up a side street. When he looked back again the woman had come to the entrance of the street and was starting after him. A man joined her, and the two of them began to run toward him.  He lost them and left the town, striding quickly, easily, up into the hills at the edge of town. When he reached the cage he stopped. What had happened? Was it something about his clothing? His dress?  He pondered. Then, as the sun set, he stepped into the cage.  Conger sat before the wheel. For a moment he waited, his hands resting lightly on the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30255"],["title","The Skull (#2)"],["body","ontrol. Then he turned the wheel, just a little, following the control readings carefully.  The grayness settled down around him.  But not for very long.         *       *       *       *       *  The man looked him over critically. \"You better come inside,\" he said. \"Out of the cold.\"  \"Thanks.\" Conger went gratefully through the open door, into the living-room. It was warm and close from the heat of the little kerosene heater in the corner. A woman, large and shapeless in her flowered dress, came from the kitchen. She and the man studied him critically.  \"It's a good room,\" the woman said. \"I'm Mrs. Appleton. It's got heat. You need that this time of year.\"  \"Yes.\" He nodded, looking around.  \"You want to eat with us?\"  \"What?\"  \"You want to eat with us?\" The man's brows knitted. \"You're not a foreigner, are you, mister?\"  \"No.\" He smiled. \"I was born in this country. Quite far west, though.\"  \"California?\"  \"No.\" He hesitated. \"In Oregon.\"  \"What's it like up there?\" Mrs. Appleton asked. \"I hear there's a lot of trees and green. It's so barren here. I come from Chicago, myself.\"  \"That's the Middle West,\" the man said to her. \"You ain't no foreigner.\"  \"Oregon isn't foreign, either,\" Conger said. \"It's part of the United States.\"  The man nodded absently. He was staring at Conger's clothing.  \"That's a funny suit you got on, mister,\" he said. \"Where'd you get that?\"  Conger was lost. He shifted uneasily. \"It's a good suit,\" he said. \"Maybe I better go some other place, if you don't want me here.\"  They both raised their hands protestingly. The woman smiled at him. \"We just have to look out for those Reds. You know, the government is always warning us about them.\"  \"The Reds?\" He was puzzled.  \"The government says they're all around. We're supposed to report anything strange or unusual, anybody doesn't act normal.\"  \"Like me?\"  They looked embarrassed. \"Well, you don't look like a Red to me,\" the man said. \"But we have to be careful. The _Tribune_ says--\"  Conger half listened. It was going to be easier than he had thought. Clearly, he would know as soon as the Founder appeared. These people, so suspicious of anything different, would be buzzing and gossiping and spreading the story. All he had to do was lie low and listen, down at the general store, perhaps. Or even here, in Mrs. Appleton's boarding house.  \"Can I see the room?\" he said.  \"Certainly.\" Mrs. Appleton went to the stairs. \"I'll be glad to show it to you.\"  They went upstairs. It was colder upstairs, but not nearly as cold as outside. Nor as cold as nights on the Martian deserts. For that he was grateful.         *       *       *       *       *  He was walking slowly around the store, looking at the cans of vegetables, the frozen packages of fish and meats shining and clean in the open refrigerator counters.  Ed Davies came toward him. \"Can I help you?\" he said. The man was a little oddly dressed, and with a beard! Ed couldn't help smiling.  \"Nothing,\" the man said in a funny voice. \"Just looking.\"  \"Sure,\" Ed said. He walked back behind the counter. Mrs. Hacket was wheeling her cart up.  \"Who's he?\" she whispered, her sharp face turned, her nose moving, as if it were sniffing. \"I never seen him before.\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"Looks funny to me. Why does he wear a beard? No one else wears a beard. Must be something the matter with him.\"  \"Maybe he likes to wear a beard. I had an uncle who--\"  \"Wait.\" Mrs. Hacket stiffened. \"Didn't that--what was his name? The Red--that old one. Didn't he have a beard? Marx. He had a beard.\"  Ed laughed. \"This ain't Karl Marx. I saw a photograph of him once.\"  Mrs. Hacket was staring at him. \"You did?\"  \"Sure.\" He flushed a little. \"What's the matter with that?\"  \"I'd sure like to know more about him,\" Mrs. Hacket said. \"I think we ought to know more, for our own good.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Hey, mister! Want a ride?\"  Conger turned quickly, dropping his hand to his belt. He relaxed. Two young kids in a car, a girl and a boy. He smiled at them. \"A ride? Sure.\"  Conger got into the car and closed the door. Bill Willet pushed the gas and the car roared down the highway.  \"I appreciate a ride,\" Conger said carefully. \"I was taking a walk between towns, but it was farther than I thought.\"  \"Where are you from?\" Lora Hunt asked. She was pretty, small and dark, in her yellow sweater and blue skirt.  \"From Cooper Creek.\"  \"Cooper Creek?\" Bill said. He frowned. \"That's funny. I don't remember seeing you before.\"  \"Why, do you come from there?\"  \"I was born there. I know everybody there.\"  \"I just moved in. From Oregon.\"  \"From Oregon? I didn't know Oregon people had accents.\"  \"Do I have an accent?\"  \"You use words funny.\"  \"How?\"  \"I don't know. Doesn't he, Lora?\"  \"You slur them,\" Lora said, smiling. \"Talk some more. I'm interested in dialects.\" She glanced at him, white-teethed. Conger felt his heart constrict.  \"I have a speech impediment.\"  \"Oh.\" Her eyes widened. \"I'm sorry.\"  They looked at him curiously as the car purred along. Conger for his part was struggling to find some way of asking them questions without seeming curious. \"I guess people from out of town don't come here much,\" he said. \"Strangers.\"  \"No.\" Bill shook his head. \"Not very much.\"  \"I'll bet I'm the first outsider for a long time.\"  \"I guess so.\"  Conger hesitated. \"A friend of mine--someone I know, might be coming through here. Where do you suppose I might--\" He stopped. \"Would there be anyone certain to see him? Someone I could ask, make sure I don't miss him if he comes?\"  They were puzzled. \"Just keep your eyes open. Cooper Creek isn't very big.\"  \"No. That's right.\"  They drove in silence. Conger studied the outline of the girl. Probably she was the boy's mistress. Perhaps she was his trial wife. Or had they developed trial marriage back so far? He could not remember. But surely such an attractive girl would be someone's mistress by this time; she would be sixteen or so, by her looks. He might ask her sometime, if they ever met again.         *       *       *       *       *  The next day Conger went walking along the one main street of Cooper Creek. He passed the general store, the two filling stations, and then the post office. At the corner was the soda fountain.  He stopped. Lora was sitting inside, talking to the clerk. She was laughing, rocking back and forth.  Conger pushed the door open. Warm air rushed around him. Lora was drinking hot chocolate, with whipped cream. She looked up in surprise as he slid into the seat beside her.  \"I beg your pardon,\" he said. \"Am I intruding?\"  \"No.\" She shook her head. Her eyes were large and dark. \"Not at all.\"  The clerk came over. \"What do you want?\"  Conger looked at the chocolate. \"Same as she has.\"  Lora was watching Conger, her arms folded, elbows on the counter. She smiled at him. \"By the way. You don't know my name. Lora Hunt.\"  She was holding out her hand. He took it awkwardly, not knowing what to do with it. \"Conger is my name,\" he murmured.  \"Conger? Is that your last or first name?\"  \"Last or first?\" He hesitated. \"Last. Omar Conger.\"  \"Omar?\" She laughed. \"That's like the poet, Omar Khayyam.\"  \"I don't know of him. I know very little of poets. We restored very few works of art. Usually only the Church has been interested enough--\" He broke off. She was staring. He flushed. \"Where I come from,\" he finished.  \"The Church? Which church do you mean?\"  \"The Church.\" He was confused. The chocolate came and he began to sip it gratefully. Lora was still watching him.  \"You're an unusual person,\" she said. \"Bill didn't like you, but he never likes anything different. He's so--so prosaic. Don't you think that when a person gets older he should become--broadened in his outlook?\"  Conger nodded.  \"He says foreign people ought to stay where they belong, not come here. But you're not so foreign. He means orientals; you know.\"  Conger nodded.  The screen door opened behind them. Bill came into the room. He stared at them. \"Well,\" he said.  Conger turned. \"Hello.\"  \"Well.\" Bill sat down. \"Hello, Lora.\" He was looking at Conger. \"I didn't expect to see you here.\"  Conger tensed. He could feel the hostility of the boy. \"Something wrong with that?\"  \"No. Nothing wrong with it.\"  There was silence. Suddenly Bill turned to Lora. \"Come on. Let's go.\"  \"Go?\" She was astonished. \"Why?\"  \"Just go!\" He grabbed her hand. \"Come on! The car's outside.\"  \"Why, Bill Willet,\" Lora said. \"You're jealous!\"  \"Who is this guy?\" Bill said. \"Do you know anything about him? Look at him, his beard--\"  She flared. \"So what? Just because he doesn't drive a Packard and go to Cooper High!\"  Conger sized the boy up. He was big--big and strong. Probably he was part of some civil control organization.  \"Sorry,\" Conger said. \"I'll go.\"  \"What's your business in town?\" Bill asked. \"What are you doing here? Why are you hanging around Lora?\"  Conger looked at the girl. He shrugged. \"No reason. I'll see you later.\"  He turned away. And froze. Bill had moved. Conger's fingers went to his belt. _Half pressure_, he whispered to himself. _No more. Half pressure._  He squeezed. The room leaped around him. He himself was protected by the lining of his clothing, the plastic sheathing inside.  \"My God--\" Lora put her hands up. Conger cursed. He hadn't meant any of it for her. But it would wear off. There was only a half-amp to it. It would tingle.  Tingle, and paralyze.  He walked out the door without looking back. He was almost to the corner when Bill came slowly out, holding onto the wall like a drunken man. Conger went on.         *       *       *       *       *  As Conger walked, restless, in the night, a form loomed in front of him. He stopped, holding his breath.  \"Who is it?\" a man's voice came. Conger waited, tense.  \"Who is it?\" the man said again. He clicked something in his hand. A light flashed. Conger moved.  \"It's me,\" he said.  \"Who is 'me'?\"  \"Conger is my name. I'm staying at the Appleton's place. Who "]]]
