He saw a messenger coming down the street, gleaming in his uniform, and, somewhat nervously, approached him.  \"May I speak to you?\" asked Plato, with school-taught politeness.  \"What about, bud? I'm busy.\"  \"Well, I've been wanting to get Captain Halverson's autograph. He's on the _Space Symphony_--\"  \"So what?\"  \"Well, the thing is, they won't let me past the gate. So I thought that if I wore a messenger's uniform--\"  The other boy glared at him. \"Are you off your Norbert? I wouldn't let you wear this uniform for a zillion credits.\"  Plato swallowed nervously, and said in desperation, \"I don't have a zillion credits, but I've got eight, and I'll give them to you if you let me wear it. Just half an hour, that's all it'll take. It's the last chance I'll have to ask him. He's bound for Rigel, and he won't be back for five years, and you see--\"  His voice tapered to a thin, tearful squeak as the messenger looked at him.  \"You're offering me eight space-lousy credits?\"  \"It's all I have. We'll just change clothes for a few minutes, and that'll be all. Please, I've got to see him. I know that if I do, he'll give me his autograph.\"  \"Okay,\" said the messenger unexpectedly. \"But hurry back. I'll be at the gate waiting for you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  As they exchanged clothes, Plato was almost feverish with excitement. But he knew that if he expected to get past the guard, he would have to control himself. The clothes didn't fit too well, even though the messenger was small, and he must do nothing that would arouse the guard's suspicion.  He said to the messenger, \"Gee, thanks. You don't know how much this means to me.\" And then, with a mental grip on himself so tense that it hurt physically, he approached the guard, and said casually, \"Earth 'gram for Captain Halverson.\"  The guard hardly looked at him. He was past the gate!  He had been tricky again. Once out of sight of the guard, he made not for the _Space Symphony_, but for the _Long Ranger_, bound for Aldebaran.  \"Earth 'gram for Captain Brinjar,\" he muttered, doing his best to look bored, as if delivering 'grams to ships was an old thing to him. And then he was aboard!  It was not quite what he expected. The smooth walls were such as he might have found in his own dormitory. The quarters, he saw, were cramped, although for someone his size they were at least adequate. And the passageways, although brilliantly lighted, were mere narrow tunnels.  From the main passageway, other tunnels branched off bewilderingly, and Plato hesitated until he realized that his very confusion gave him an excuse for poking his nose into all sorts of places. He followed one of the tunnels until he came to a door: ENGINE ROOM--KEEP OUT.  He entered. A mechanic looked up.  \"Earth 'gram for Captain Brinjar. They said he was around here.\"  \"Not here,\" replied the mechanic. \"Try the cargo hold.\"  Plato backed out and set off down the corridor again, noting the direction arrows and signs. TO MAIN LOUNGE--no good. TO CAPTAIN'S CABIN--worse. He didn't want to find the captain and lose his excuse for being there.  And then he saw TO FOOD STORAGE and knew that he need look no further. This was a place both to hide and to eat, until the ship took off, and the crew found him, and had to accept him as one of themselves.  He opened the door to the food storage hold with an elaborate caution that turned out to be unnecessary. There was no one inside. He settled down between two packing cases and let out his breath. He had made it. He had stowed away successfully, and in a few hours he would be out in space, traveling between the stars, fighting, adventuring--  A yawn almost wiped the smile off his face.         *       *       *       *       *  He awoke to disaster. The captain and Plato's dorm master were standing there, staring down at him, and the dorm master was saying, \"All right, Plato, you've had your adventure, and now I'm afraid you'll have to pay for it. It's time to go home.\"  Plato couldn't move. It was impossible, after he had been so clever, so ingenious, and had thrown them off the trail in so many ways, for them to have found him!  \"You shouldn't have bought a ticket to the wrong station,\" said the dorm master, somewhat amusedly. \"When the conductor turned it in, the only one of its kind on his flight, it naturally attracted attention. We hadn't even suspected you had taken a glider-train until the flight people came to us.\"  Now he would never adventure on strange planets of unknown suns. He would never course through space like Comets Carter. He would never have the adventures which alone made life seem worth living.  Unable to control himself, he burst into tears. It was a completely unmanly thing to do, but he couldn't help himself. The tears flowed down over his cheeks, washing away all his shattered illusions. He would never dream such dreams again. From now on, it would be useless. They would be watching him carefully to make sure that he didn't leave the planet.  He heard the captain say in astonishment, \"I didn't know these young ones could cry like that.\"  \"Of course they cry,\" replied the dorm master. \"They eat, sleep, cry--almost like you and me, Captain. And worst of all, they even have their dreams. That's why I sometimes wonder, Captain, if it isn't a mistake to send them to school.\"  \"They have to learn.\"  \"Granted,\" agreed the dorm master somberly. \"But not to dream of being human when they're only androids.\"                                                      --WILLIAM MORRISON     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ November 1952.

A Protest and a Warning Addressed to the Peoples of Europe (#0)"],["body","by Edward.W.Badger e-mail psittacus@bigfoot.com  OR e-mail ted@worksop.worldonline.co.uk      NEVER AGAIN!  (A protest and a warning addressed to the peoples of Europe)  by Edward Carpenter     Never again must this Thing happen.  The time has come -- if the human race does not wish to destroy itself in its own madness -- for men to make up their minds as to what they will do in the future; for now indeed is it true that we are come to the cross-roads, we stand at the Parting of the Ways.  The rapid and enormous growth of scientific invention makes it obvious that Violence ten times more potent and sinister than that which we are witnessing to-day may very shortly be available for our use -- or abuse -- in War.  On the other hand who can doubt that the rapid growth of interchange and understanding among the peoples of the world is daily making Warfare itself, and the barbarities inevitably connected with it, more abhorrent to our common humanity?  Which of these lines are we to follow? Along which path are we to go? This is a question which the mass -- peoples of Europe in the future -- and not merely the Governments --- will have seriously to ponder and decide.  That bodies of men -- as has happened a hundred times in the trenches in Northern France and even on the Eastern Front -- should exchange morning salutations and songs in humorous amity, and then at a word of command should fall to shooting each other;  That peasants and artisans, and shopkeepers and students and schoolmasters, who have no quarrel whatever, who on the whole rather respect and honour each other, should with explosive bombs deliberately blow one another to bits so that even their own mothers could not recognize them; That human beings should use every devilish invention of science with the one purpose of maiming, blinding, destroying those against whom they have no personal grudge or grievance; All this is sheer madness.  Only a short time ago a private soldier said to me:  \"Yes, we had got to be such friends with those Bavarians in the trenches over against us that if we had returned there again I believe nothing could have made us fight with each other; but of course that point was perceived and we were moved to another part of the Line.\" What a criticism in a few words on the whole War! A hundred times this or something similar has happened, and a hundred and a thousand times these 'enemies' who have madly mutilated each other have -- a few minutes later -- been only too glad to dress each other's wounds and share the last contents of their water-bottles.   By all the heart-rending experiences which have now become so common and familiar to us;  By the fact that to-day there is hardly a family over the greater part of Europe that is not grieving bitterly over the loss of some dearest member of its circle;  By the white faces of the women clad in black, whom one sees everywhere in the streets of Berlin and Brussels and Paris and Vienna, of London and Milan and Belgrade and Petrograd;  By the sufferings of famine-stricken Poland, ravaged already three or four times in the last two years by opposing and alternate armies;  By the awful sufferings of the six or seven million Jews of the Russian Pale, hounded homeless in winter to and, fro over the frozen earth the old men and women and children perishing of exposure, fatigue, and starvation; By the agony of Serbia, and the despair of Belgium;  This must not be again!  By the five or six million actual combatants already slain; and, the strange spectacle of millions of Women (over half a million in Britain, more in France, multitudes in Germany and America) manufacturing man-destroying explosive shells in ceaseless stream by day and night; (And it is estimated that on the average some fifty shells are expended for every one man slain) By the terrified faces -- as of drowning men -- of those suffering in countless hospitals from shell-shock; by their trembling hands and, limbs and horrible dreams at night -- pursued by an ever-living horror;  By the curses of the tender-hearted friend who collects in No-man's-land between the lines the scattered fragments of his comrade's body -- the dabs of flesh, the hand, the head he knows so well, a boot with a foot still in it -- and puts them all together in a sack for burial;  By the silent stupefaction of wives and mothers trying vainly to picture to themselves a death which cannot be pictured; by the insane laughter of those who having witnessed these things can no longer weep;  This must not be again!   By the beach at Gallipoli covered with the prostrate and writhing forms of men exhausted and emaciated with dysentery, who have crawled down from the hills only to lie out there in the terrible sun tormented with flies and thirst, or to shiver through the frosty night, waiting for the tardy arrival of the Hospital Ship;  By the hundreds of bodies thrown at the last into the sea at sunrise, for their unceremonious end;  And each poor body for all its loathsome state so loved, so loved by some one far away;  By the dear Lord who in the beautiful legend descended for three days into Hell that he might redeem mankind; but these have lived in an actual Hell for weeks and months together --  This must not be again!   By the growth and expansion of Science (God forgive the word!) which will inevitably make each future war more devilish and inhuman than the last;   By the cry of the black and coloured peoples of the Earth who have for long enough already said how hard and cruel the faces of the white men seemed to them, and who now think how black their souls are;   By the hardness of heart, the insensitiveness of a certain kind, which during a century or more now has been bred by the institutions of Commercialism;   By the habitual betrayal, through long periods of 'prosperity' and `peace,' of men by their fellows -- of the weak by the powerful, of the generous by the mean, of the simple and thoughtless by the crafty and selfish;   By the huge dividends declared by Armament Firms; by the international agreements of these firms with one another, even to cozen their own respective Governments;  By the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of innocent folk trampled underfoot in the ditch of competition, the mad, race in which the devil takes the hindmost;  By the treacherous internal warfare of the ordinary industrial life of every country, the secret betrayal and murder of bodies and souls for profit -- at last written out in letters of blood and fire across the continents, for all to behold --  This must not be again !  Let the Allies by all means accuse Germany of world-ambition and world-plunder, and let the German people accuse their Prussian lords but let every nation also search its own heart and accuse itself.  For have not the lords of every nation set before themselves the same goal, the goal of world-ambition and glory and 'empire' and plunder?  And have not the mass-peoples of every nation stood meanly by and acclaimed the fraud, nor spoken out against it, silently consenting to these things in the prospect of some advantage also to themselves?  Have not all the nations without exception acted meanly and dastardly towards the out lying black races, and even towards those more civilized peoples whom they thought weaker than themselves -- and now in the stress of war are they not finding that their own rights and liberties are being slowly filched from them?  Yes, that is, the end of Glory and of Greed.  But the day of glory is departed.  The newspapers, it is true, still keep up the phrase.  They talk of a battalion \"covering itself with glory.\"  But the men themselves do not talk so.  They know too well what it all means.  They see no glory in covering themselves with the blood of their brothers of the opposing trenches; with whom a few moments before they were joining in songs and jokes.  They only say:  Now that we have begun, we will see it through -- but it must not be Again.    Never I think in all the history of the world has there been a thing so great in its way as the present British Army and Navy.  This enormous force, raised -- except for a small remnant -- by Voluntary enlistment from all classes of the nation, and inspired more by a general and protective sense towards the Motherland than by anything else, has fulfilled what it considered to be its duty and its honour with a devotion and a heroism unsurpassed.  It were impossible to stay and recount its many wonderful deeds.  A young officer said to me one day -- \"Horrible as the whole thing is, yet it almost seems worth while, when you think of the splendid things done -- and done too in such a simple matter-of-fact way: when you think of all the love and devotion poured out, and the lives our men have given one for the sake of another.\"  Great indeed is the spirit of such an army, great its magnanimity, its simplicity of mind, its unself-consciousness, its single concentration on its purpose.  Yet perhaps the most surprising thing about our men is that they have done all this with so little hatred in their hearts for the enemy.  Whatever the Germans may have felt, and whatever the French, the Britishers have just done their fighting in their own nonchalant way \"because they had to\" -- with scarcely a shadow of malice or revenge -- rather with that respect for a doughty opponent which always distinguishes the true fighter.  Think of that quaint story (Between The Lines, by Boyd Cable, pp 188 ff) of the German Burschen in their trenches, singing with pious enthusiasm the Song of Hate (probably commanded and compelled, poor devils, to sing it) and our men for days secretly listening, learning the words, practicing the tune on their muffled, mouth-organs; till having got it all complete they one morning, burst it forth in full chorus on the astonished Teutons, nor failed at the end to blaze out \"Gott strafe England\" at the top of, their voices as if they really meant it -- and"]]]
