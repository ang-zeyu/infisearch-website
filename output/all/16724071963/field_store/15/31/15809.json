Which was precisely why he rarely let himself think of it as a whole nowadays.  This last year, at any rate, Barney conceded to himself, had to be regarded as an improvement on the first. Well, he added irritably, and what wouldn't be? It hadn't been delightful, he'd frequently felt almost stupefied with boredom. But physically, at least, he was fit--considerably fitter, as a matter of fact, than he'd ever been in his life.  Not very surprising. When he got too restless to be able to settle down to anything else, he was walking about the valley, moving along at his best clip regardless of obstacles until he was ready to drop to the ground wherever he was. Exertion ate up restlessness eventually--for a while. Selecting another tree to chop into firewood took the edge off the spasms of rage that tended to come up if he started thinking too long about that association of jerks somewhere beyond the sun. Brother Chard was putting on muscle all over. And after convincing himself at last--after all, the animals weren't getting hurt--that the glaring diamond of fire in the daytime sky couldn't really be harmful, he had also rapidly put on a Palm Beach tan. When his carefully rationed sleep periods eventually came around, he was more than ready for them, and slept like a log.  Otherwise: projects. Projects to beat boredom, and never mind how much sense they made in themselves. None of them did. But after the first month or two he had so much going that there was no question any more of not having something to do. Two hours allotted to work out on the typewriter a critical evaluation of a chapter from one of McAllen's abstruse technical texts. If Barney's mood was sufficiently sour, the evaluation would be unprintable; but it wasn't being printed, and two hours had been disposed of. A day and a half--Earth Standard Time--to construct an operating dam across the stream. He was turning into an experienced landscape architect; the swimming pool in the floor of the valley beneath the cabin might not have been approved by Carstairs of California, but it was the one project out of which he had even drawn some realistic benefit.  Then:  Half an hour to improve his knife-throwing technique.  Fifteen minutes to get the blade of the kitchen knife straightened out afterwards.  Two hours to design a box trap for the capture of one of the fat gray squirrels that always hung about the cabin.  Fifty minutes on a new chess problem. Chess, Barney had discovered, wasn't as hairy as it looked.  Five hours to devise one more completely foolproof method of bringing about the eventual ruin of the association. That made no more practical sense than anything else he was doing--and couldn't, until he knew a great deal more about McAllen's friends than he did now.  But it was considerably more absorbing, say, than even chess.  Brother Chard could beat boredom. He could probably beat another three years of boredom.  He hadn't forgiven anyone for making him do it.     THE END OF YEAR FIVE   For some hours, the association's Altiplano station had been dark and almost deserted. Only the IMT transit lock beneath one of the sprawling ranch houses showed in the vague light spreading out of the big scanning plate in an upper wall section. The plate framed an unimpressive section of the galaxy, a blurred scattering of stars condensing toward the right, and, somewhat left of center, a large misty red globe.  [Illustration: Gone Fishing]  John Emanuel Fredericks, seated by himself in one of the two Tube operator chairs, ignored the plate. He was stooped slightly forwards, peering absorbedly through the eyepieces of the operator scanner before him.  Melvin Simms, Psychologist, strolled in presently through the transit lock's door, stopped behind Fredericks, remarked mildly, \"Good evening, doctor.\"  Fredericks started and looked around. \"Never heard you arrive, Mel. Where's Ollie?\"  \"He and Spalding dropped in at Spalding's place in Vermont. They should be along in a few minutes.\"  \"Spalding?\" Fredericks repeated inquiringly. \"Our revered president intends to observe the results of Ollie's experiment in person?\"  \"He'll represent the board here,\" Simms said. \"Whereas I, as you may have guessed, represent the outraged psychology department.\" He nodded at the plate. \"That the place?\"  \"That's it. ET Base Eighteen.\"  \"Not very sharp in the Tube, is it?\"  \"No. Still plenty of interfering radiation. But it's thinned out enough for contact. Reading 0.19, as of thirty minutes ago.\" Fredericks indicated the chair beside him. \"Sit down if you want a better look.\"  \"Thanks.\" The psychologist settled himself in the chair, leaned forward and peered into the scanner. After a few seconds he remarked, \"Not the most hospitable-looking place--\"  Fredericks grunted. \"Any of the ecologists will tell you Eighteen's an unspoiled beauty. No problems there--except the ones we bring along ourselves.\"  Simms grinned faintly. \"Well, we're good at doing that, aren't we? Have you looked around for uh ... for McAllen's subject yet?\"  \"No. Felt Ollie should be present when we find out what's happened. Incidentally, how did the meeting go?\"  \"You weren't tuned in?\" Simms asked, surprised.  \"No. Too busy setting things up for contact.\"  \"Well\"--Simms sat back in his chair--\"I may say it was a regular bear garden for a while, doctor. Psychology expressed itself as being astounded, indignant, offended. In a word, they were hopping mad. I kept out of it, though I admit I was startled when McAllen informed me privately this morning of the five-year project he's been conducting on the quiet. He was accused of crimes ranging ... oh, from the clandestine to the inhumane. And, of course, Ollie was giving it back as good as he got.\"  \"Of course.\"  \"His arguments,\" Simms went on, pursing his lips reflectively, \"were not without merit. That was recognized. Nobody enjoys the idea of euthanasia as a security device. Many of us feel--I do--that it's still preferable to the degree of brain-washing required to produce significant alterations in a personality type of Chard's class.\"  \"Ollie feels that, too,\" Fredericks said. \"The upshot of the original situation, as he saw it, was that Barney Chard had been a dead man from the moment he got on the association's trail. Or a permanently deformed personality.\"  Simms shook his head. \"Not the last. We wouldn't have considered attempting personality alteration in his case.\"  \"Euthanasia then,\" Fredericks said. \"Chard was too intelligent to be thrown off the track, much too unscrupulous to be trusted under any circumstances. So Ollie reported him dead.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The psychologist was silent for some seconds. \"The point might be this,\" he said suddenly. \"After my talk with McAllen this morning, I ran an extrapolation on the personality pattern defined for Chard five years ago on the basis of his background. Results indicate he went insane and suicided within a year.\"  \"How reliable are those results?\" Fredericks inquired absently.  \"No more so than any other indication in individual psychology. But they present a reasonable probability ... and not a very pleasant one.\"  Fredericks said, \"Oliver wasn't unaware of that as a possible outcome. One reason he selected Base Eighteen for the experiment was to make sure he couldn't interfere with the process, once it had begun.  \"His feeling, after talking with Chard for some hours, was that Chard was an overcondensed man. That is Oliver's own term, you understand. Chard obviously was intelligent, had a very strong survival drive. He had selected a good personal survival line to follow--good but very narrow. Actually, of course, he was a frightened man. He had been running scared all his life. He couldn't stop.\"  Simms nodded.  \"Base Eighteen stopped him. The things he'd been running from simply no longer existed. Ollie believed Chard would go into a panic when he realized it. The question was what he'd do then. Survival now had a very different aspect. The only dangers threatening him were the ones inherent in the rigid personality structure he had maintained throughout his adult existence. Would he be intelligent enough to understand that? And would his survival urge--with every alternative absolutely barred to him for five years--be strong enough to overcome those dangers?\"  \"And there,\" Simms said dryly, \"we have two rather large questions.\" He cleared his throat. \"The fact remains, however, that Oliver B. McAllen is a good practical psychologist--as he demonstrated at the meeting.\"  \"I expected Ollie would score on the motions,\" Fredericks said. \"How did that part of it come off?\"  \"Not too badly. The first motion was passed unanimously. A vote of censure against Dr. McAllen.\"  Fredericks looked thoughtful. \"His seventeenth--I believe?\"  \"Yes. The fact was mentioned. McAllen admitted he could do no less than vote for this one himself. However, the next motion to receive a majority was, in effect, a generalized agreement that men with such ... ah ... highly specialized skills as Barney Chard's and with comparable intelligence actually would be of great value as members of the association, if it turned out that they could be sufficiently relieved of their more flagrant antisocial tendencies. Considering the qualification, the psychology department could hardly avoid backing that motion. The same with the third one--in effect again that Psychology is to make an unprejudiced study of the results of Dr. McAllen's experiment on Base Eighteen, and report on the desirability of similar experiments when the personality of future subjects appears to warrant them.\"  \"Well,\" Fredericks said, after a pause, \"as far as the association goes, Ollie got what he wanted. As usual.\" He hesitated. \"The other matter--\"  \"We'll know that shortly.\" Simms turned his head to listen, added in a lowered voice, \"They're coming now.\"         *      "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30155"],["title","Relativity: The Special and General Theory (#0)"],["body","Relativity: The Special and General Theory    by Albert Einstein    Authorised Translation by Robert W.

PREFACE  The present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics. The work presumes a standard of education corresponding to that of a university matriculation examination, and, despite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the reader. The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and connection in which they actually originated. In the interest of clearness, it appeared to me inevitable that I should repeat myself frequently, without paying the slightest attention to the elegance of the presentation. I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler. I make no pretence of having withheld from the reader difficulties which are inherent to the subject. On the other hand, I have purposely treated the empirical physical foundations of the theory in a “step-motherly” fashion, so that readers unfamiliar with physics may not feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the forest for the trees. May the book bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive thought!  December, 1916    A. EINSTEIN   PART I: THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY   I.  PHYSICAL MEANING OF GEOMETRICAL PROPOSITIONS  In your schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance with the noble building of Euclid’s geometry, and you remember—perhaps with more respect than love—the magnificent structure, on the lofty staircase of which you were chased about for uncounted hours by conscientious teachers. By reason of our past experience, you would certainly regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the most out-of-the-way proposition of this science to be untrue. But perhaps this feeling of proud certainty would leave you immediately if some one were to ask you: “What, then, do you mean by the assertion that these propositions are true?” Let us proceed to give this question a little consideration.  Geometry sets out from certain conceptions such as “plane,” “point,” and “straight line,” with which we are able to associate more or less definite ideas, and from certain simple propositions (axioms) which, in virtue of these ideas, we are inclined to accept as “true.” Then, on the basis of a logical process, the justification of which we feel ourselves compelled to admit, all remaining propositions are shown to follow from those axioms, _i.e._ they are proven. A proposition is then correct (“true”) when it has been derived in the recognised manner from the axioms. The question of “truth” of the individual geometrical propositions is thus reduced to one of the “truth” of the axioms. Now it has long been known that the last question is not only unanswerable by the methods of geometry, but that it is in itself entirely without meaning. We cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line goes through two points. We can only say that Euclidean geometry deals with things called “straight lines,” to each of which is ascribed the property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it. The concept “true” does not tally with the assertions of pure geometry, because by the word “true” we are eventually in the habit of designating always the correspondence with a “real” object; geometry, however, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in it to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of these ideas among themselves.  It is not difficult to understand why, in spite of this, we feel constrained to call the propositions of geometry “true.” Geometrical ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature, and these last are undoubtedly the exclusive cause of the genesis of those ideas. Geometry ought to refrain from such a course, in order to give to its structure the largest possible logical unity. The practice, for example, of seeing in a “distance” two marked positions on a practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in our habit of thought. We are accustomed further to regard three points as being situated on a straight line, if their apparent positions can be made to coincide for observation with one eye, under suitable choice of our place of observation.  If, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we now supplement the propositions of Euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two points on a practically rigid body always correspond to the same distance (line-interval), independently of any changes in position to which we may subject the body, the propositions of Euclidean geometry then resolve themselves into propositions on the possible relative position of practically rigid bodies.[1] Geometry which has been supplemented in this way is then to be treated as a branch of physics. We can now legitimately ask as to the “truth” of geometrical propositions interpreted in this way, since we are justified in asking whether these propositions are satisfied for those real things we have associated with the geometrical ideas. In less exact terms we can express this by saying that by the “truth” of a geometrical proposition in this sense we understand its validity for a construction with rule and compasses.    [1] It follows that a natural object is associated also with a  straight line. Three points _A, B_ and _C_ on a rigid body thus lie in  a straight line when the points _A_ and _C_ being given, _B_ is chosen  such that the sum of the distances _AB_ and _BC_ is as short as  possible. This incomplete suggestion will suffice for the present  purpose.   Of course the conviction of the “truth” of geometrical propositions in this sense is founded exclusively on rather incomplete experience. For the present we shall assume the “truth” of the geometrical propositions, then at a later stage (in the general theory of relativity) we shall see that this “truth” is limited, and we shall consider the extent of its limitation.   II.  THE SYSTEM OF CO-ORDINATES  On the basis of the physical interpretation of distance which has been indicated, we are also in a position to establish the distance between two points on a rigid body by means of measurements. For this purpose we require a “distance” (rod"]]]
