The implications were, of course, that many of the purges, certainly the latter ones, were the result of the whims of a mental case, that the Soviet Complex had for long years been ruled by a man as unbalanced as Czar Peter the Great.  They pulled up before a rather large house that would have been called a dacha back in Moscow. Evidently, Ilya Simonov decided, whoever was sponsoring this night's get together, was a man of prominence. He grimaced inwardly. A lot of high placed heads were going to roll before he was through.  It turned out that the host was Leos Dvorak, the internationally famed cinema director and quite an idol of Ilya Simonov in his earlier days when he'd found more time for entertainment. It was a shock to meet the man under these circumstances.  Catherina Panova was obviously quite popular among this gathering. Their host gave her an affectionate squeeze in way of greeting, then shook hands with Simonov when Catherina introduced him.  \"Newly from Moscow, eh?\" the film director said, squinting at the security agent. He had a sharp glance, almost, it seemed to Simonov, as though he detected the real nature of the newcomer. \"It's been several years since I've been to Moscow. Are things loosening up there?\"  \"Loosening up?\" Simonov said.  Leos Dvorak laughed and said to Catherina, \"Probably not. I've always been of the opinion that the Party's influence would shrivel away first at its extremities. Membership would fall off abroad, in the neutral countries and in Common Europe and the Americas. Then in the so-called satellite countries. Last of all in Russia herself. But, very last, Moscow--the dullest, stodgiest, most backward intellectually, capital city in the world.\" The director laughed again and turned away to greet a new guest.  This was open treason. Ilya Simonov had been lucky. Within the first few days of being in the Czech capital he'd contacted one of the groups which he'd been sent to unmask.  Now he said mildly to Catherina Panova, \"He seems rather outspoken.\"  She chuckled. \"Leos is quite strongly opinionated. His theory is that the more successful the Party is in attaining the goals it set half a century ago, the less necessary it becomes. He's of the opinion that it will eventually atrophy, shrivel away to the point that all that will be needed will be the slightest of pushes to end its domination.\"  Ilya Simonov said, \"And the rest of the group here, do they agree?\"  Catherina shrugged. \"Some do, some don't. Some of them are of the opinion that it will take another blood bath. That the party will attempt to hang onto its power and will have to be destroyed.\"  Simonov said evenly, \"And you? What do you think?\"  She frowned, prettily. \"I'm not sure. I suppose I'm still in the process of forming an opinion.\"  Their host was calling them together and leading the way to the garden where chairs had been set up. There seemed to be about twenty-five persons present in all. Ilya Simonov had been introduced to no more than half of them. His memory was good and already he was composing a report to Kliment Blagonravov, listing those names he recalled. Some were Czechs, some citizens of other satellite countries, several, including Catherina, were actually Russians.  The American, a newspaperman named Dickson, had an open-faced freshness, hardly plausible in an agent from the West trying to subvert Party leadership. Ilya Simonov couldn't quite figure him out.  Dickson was introduced by Leos Dvorak who informed his guests that the American had been reluctant but had finally agreed to give them his opinion on the press on both sides of what had once been called the Iron Curtain.  Dickson grinned boyishly and said, \"I'm not a public speaker, and, for that matter, I haven't had time to put together a talk for you. I think what I'll do is read a little clipping I've got here--sort of a text--and then, well, throw the meeting open to questions. I'll try to answer anything you have to ask.\"  He brought forth a piece of paper. \"This is from the British writer, Huxley. I think it's pretty good.\" He cleared his voice and began to read.  _Mass communication ... is simply a force and like any other force, it can be used either well or ill. Used one way, the press, the radio and the cinema are indispensible to the survival of democracy. Used in another way, they are among the most powerful weapons in the dictator's armory. In the field of mass communications as in almost every other field of enterprise, technological progress has hurt the Little Man and helped the Big Man. As lately as fifty years ago, every democratic country could boast of a great number of small journals and local newspapers. Thousands of country editors expressed thousands of independent opinions. Somewhere or other almost anybody could get almost anything printed. Today the press is still legally free; but most of the little papers have disappeared. The cost of wood pulp, of modern printing machinery and of syndicated news is too high for the Little Man. In the totalitarian East there is political censorship, and the media of mass communications are controlled by the State. In the democratic West there is economic censorship and the media of mass communication are controlled by members of the Power Elite. Censorship by rising costs and the concentration of communication-power in the hands of a few big concerns is less objectionable than State Ownership and government propaganda; but certainly it is not something to which a Jeffersonian democrat could approve._  Ilya Simonov looked blankly at Catherina and whispered, \"Why, what he's reading is as much an attack on the West as it is on us.\"  She looked at him and whispered back, \"Well, why not? This gathering is to discuss freedom of the press.\"  He said blankly, \"But as an agent of the West--\"  She frowned at him. \"Mr. Dickson isn't an agent of the West. He's an American journalist.\"  \"Surely you can't believe he has no connections with the imperialist governments.\"  \"Certainly, he hasn't. What sort of meeting do you think this is? We're not interested in Western propaganda. We're a group of intellectuals searching for freedom of ideas.\"  Ilya Simonov was taken back once again.         *       *       *       *       *  Colonel Ilya Simonov dismissed his cab in front of the Ministry and walked toward the gate. Down the street the same plainclothes man, who had been lounging there the last time he'd reported, once again took him in, then looked away. The two guards snapped to attention, and the security agent strode by them unnoticing.  At the lieutenant's desk, before the offices of Kliment Blagonravov, he stopped and said, \"Colonel Simonov. I have no appointment but I think the Minister will see me.\"  \"Yes, Comrade Colonel,\" the lieutenant said. He spoke into an inter-office communicator, then looked up. \"Minister Blagonravov will be able to see you in a few minutes, sir.\"  Ilya Simonov stared nervously and unseeingly out a window while he waited. Gorki Park lay across the way. It, like Moscow in general, had changed a good deal in Simonov's memory. Everything in Russia had changed a good deal, he realized. And was changing. And what was the end to be? Or was there ever an end? Of course not. There is no end, ever. Only new changes to come.  The lieutenant said, \"The Minister is free now, Comrade Colonel.\"  Ilya Simonov muttered something to him and pushed his way through the heavy door.  Blagonravov looked up from his desk and rumbled affectionately, \"Ilya! It's good to see you. Have a drink! You've lost weight, Ilya!\"  His top field man sank into the same chair he'd occupied nine months before, and accepted the ice-cold vodka.  Blagonravov poured another drink for himself, then scowled at the other. \"Where have you been? When you first went off to Prague, I got reports from you almost every day. These last few months I've hardly heard from you.\" He rumbled his version of a chuckle. \"If I didn't know you better, I'd think there was a woman.\"  Ilya Simonov looked at him wanly. \"That too, Kliment.\"  \"You are jesting!\"  \"No. Not really. I had hoped to become engaged--soon.\"  \"A party member? I never thought of you as the marrying type, Ilya.\"  Simonov said slowly, \"Yes, a Party member. Catherina Panova, my assistant in the automobile agency in Prague.\"  Blagonravov scowled heavily at him, put forth his fat lips in a thoughtful pout. He came to his feet, approached a file cabinet, fishing from his pocket a key ring. He unlocked the cabinet, brought forth a sheaf of papers with which he returned to his desk. He fumbled though them for a moment, found the paper he wanted and read it. He scowled again and looked up at his agent.  \"Your first report,\" he said. \"Catherina Panova. From what you say here, a dangerous reactionary. Certainly she has no place in Party ranks.\"  Ilya Simonov said, \"Is that the complete file of my assignment?\"  \"Yes. I've kept it here in my own office. I've wanted this to be ultra-undercover. No one except you and me. I had hopes of you working your way up into the enemy's organization, and I wanted no possible chance of you being betrayed. You don't seem to have been too successful.\"  \"I was as successful as it's possible to be.\"  The security minister leaned forward. \"Ah ha! I knew I could trust you to bring back results, Ilya. This will take Frol Zverev's pressure off me. Number One has been riding me hard.\" Blagonravov poured them both another drink. \"You were able to insert yourself into their higher circles?\"  Simonov said, \"Kliment, there are no higher circles.\"  His chief glared at him. \"Nonsense!\" He tapped the file with a pudgy finger. \"In your early reports you described several groups, small organizations, illegal meetings. There must be an upper organization, some movement supported from the West most likely.\"  Ilya Simonov was shaking his head. \"No. They're all spontaneous.\"  His chief growled, \"I tell you there are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30338"],["title","Freedom (#5)"],["body","thousands of these little groups. That hardly sounds like a spontaneous phenomenon.\"  \"Nevertheless, that is what my investigations have led me to believe.\"  Blagonravov glowered at him, uncertainly. Finally, he said, \"Well, confound it, you've spent the better part of a year among them. What's it all about? What do they want?\"  Ilya Simonov said flatly, \"They want freedom, Kliment.\"  \"Freedom! What do you mean, freedom? The Soviet Complex is the most highly industrialized area of the world. Our people have the highest standard of living anywhere. Don't they understand? We've met all the promises we ever made. We've reached far and beyond the point ever dreamed of by Utopians. The people, all of the people, have it made as the Americans say.\"  \"Except for freedom,\" Simonov said doggedly. \"These groups are springing up everywhere, spontaneously. Thus far, perhaps, our ministry has been able to suppress some of them. But the pace is accelerating. They aren't inter-organized now. But how soon they'll start to be, I don't know. Sooner or later, someone is going to come up with a unifying idea. A new socio-political system to advocate a way of guaranteeing the basic liberties. Then, of course, the fat will be in the fire.\"  \"Ilya! You've been working too hard. I've pushed you too much, relied on you too much. You need a good lengthy vacation.\"  Simonov shrugged. \"Perhaps. But what I've just said is the truth.\"  His chief snorted heavily. \"You half sound as though you agree with them.\"  \"I do, Kliment.\"  \"I am in no mood for gags, as the Yankees say.\"  Ilya Simonov looked at him wearily. He said slowly, \"You sent me to investigate an epidemic, a spreading disease. Very well, I report that it's highly contagious.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Blagonravov poured himself more vodka angrily. \"Explain yourself. What's this all about?\"  His former best field man said, \"Kliment--\"  \"I want no familiarities from you, colonel!\"  \"Yes, sir.\" Ilya Simonov went on doggedly. \"Man never achieves complete freedom. It's a goal never reached, but one continually striven for. The moment as small a group as two or three gather together, all of them must give up some of the individual's freedom. When man associates with millions of his fellow men, he gives up a good many freedoms for the sake of the community. But always he works to retain as much liberty as possible, and to gain more. It's the nature of our species, I suppose.\"  \"You sound as though you've become corrupted by Western ideas,\" the security head muttered dangerously.  Simonov shook his head. \"No. The same thing applies over there. Even in countries such as Sweden and Switzerland, where institutions are as free as anywhere in the world, the people are continually striving for more. Governments and socio-economic systems seem continually to whittle away at individual liberty. But always man fights back and tries to achieve new heights for himself.  \"In the name of developing our country, the Party all but eliminated freedom in the Soviet Complex, but now the goals have been reached and the people will no longer put up with us, sir.\"  \"_Us!_\" Kliment Blagonravov growled bitterly. \"You are hardly to be considered in the Party's ranks any longer, Simonov. Why in the world did you ever return here?\" He sneered fatly. \"Your best bet would have been to escape over the border into the West.\"  Simonov looked at the file on the other's desk. \"I wanted to regain those reports I made in the early days of my assignment. I've listed in them some fifty names, names of men and women who are now my friends.\"  The fat lips worked in and out. \"It must be that woman. You've become soft in the head, Simonov.\" Blagonravov tapped the file beneath his heavy fingers. \"Never fear, before the week is out these fifty persons will be either in prison or in their graves.\"  With a fluid motion, Ilya Simonov produced a small caliber gun, a special model designed for security agents. An unusual snout proclaimed its quiet virtues as guns go.  \"No, Kliment,\" Ilya Simonov said.  \"Are you mad!\"  \"No, Kliment, but I must have those reports.\" Ilya Simonov came to his feet and reached for them.  With a roar of rage, Kliment Blagonravov slammed open a drawer and dove a beefy paw into it. With shocking speed for so heavy a man, he scooped up a heavy military revolver.  And Colonel Ilya Simonov shot him neatly and accurately in the head. The silenced gun made no more sound than a pop.  Blagonravov, his dying eyes registering unbelieving shock, fell back into his heavy swivel chair.         *       *       *       *       *  Simonov worked quickly. He gathered up his reports, checked quickly to see they were all there. Struck a match, lit one of the reports and dropped it into the large ashtray on the desk. One by one he lit them all and when all were consumed, stirred the ashes until they were completely pulverized.  He poured himself another vodka, downed it, stiff wristed, then without turning to look at the dead man again, made his way to the door.  He slipped out and said to the lieutenant, \"The Minister says that he is under no circumstances to be disturbed for the next hour.\"  The lieutenant frowned at him. \"But he has an appointment.\"  Colonel Ilya Simonov shrugged. \"Those were his instructions. Not to be bothered under any circumstances.\"  \"But it was an appointment with Number One!\"  That was bad. And unforeseen. Ilya Simonov said, \"It's probably been canceled. All I'm saying is that Minister Blagonravov instructs you not to bother him under any circumstances for the next hour.\"  He left the other and strode down the corridor, keeping himself from too obvious, a quickened pace.  At the entrance to the Ministry, he shot his glance up and down the street. He was in the clutch now, and knew it. He had few illusions.  Not a cab in sight. He began to cross the road toward the park. In a matter of moments there, he'd be lost in the trees and shrubbery. He had rather vague plans. Actually, he was playing things as they came. There was a close friend in whose apartment he could hide, a man who owed him his life. He could disguise himself. Possibly buy or borrow a car. If he could get back to Prague, he was safe. Perhaps he and Catherina could defect to the West.  Somebody was screaming something from a window in the Ministry.  Ilya Simonov quickened his pace. He was nearly across the street now. He thought, foolishly, _Whoever that is shouting is so excited he sounds more like a woman than a man._  Another voice took up the shout. It was the plainclothes man. Feet began pounding.  There were two more shouts. The guards. But he was across now. The shrubs were only a foot away.  The shattering blackness hit him in the back of the head. It was over immediately.  Afterwards, the plainclothes man and the two guards stood over him. Men began pouring from the Ministry in their direction.  Colonel Ilya Simonov was a meaningless, bloody heap on the edge of the park's grass.  The guard who had shot said, \"He killed the Minister. He must have been crazy to think he could get away with it. What did he want?\"  \"Well, we'll never know now,\" the plainclothesman grunted.   THE END         *       *       *       *       *"]]]
