A voice, startling in its sudden loudness, filled the little room.  \"Calling three--seven--G--four--two! Stand by for orders! Patrol O--sixteen--L sending; acknowledge, please!\"  Chet's eyes were staring into those of O'Malley. \"That's Jimmy Maddux back on our trail,\" he said. \"Now, what has got them suspicious?\"  He glanced once at the collision instrument. \"He's right overhead at thirty thousand,\" he added; \"and there are more of them coming in from all sides. Now what the devil--\"  Spud O'Malley had his hand on the voice switch. \"Be quiet!\" he commanded; then spoke into the transmitter--  \"Three--seven--G--four--two acknowledging!\" he said, and again Chet observed how all trace of accent had departed from his voice; it was an indication of the moment's tenseness and of the pilot's full understanding of their position.  The answering order was crisply spoken; this was a different Jimmy Maddux from the one who had chaffed the Irish pilot some hours before.  \"Stand by! We're coming down! Records at Hoover Terminal show two men reporting at pilots' gate under the number of your engineer, CG41. Hold your ship exactly where you are; we're sending a man aboard!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Chet had moved silently to the controls. The old multiple-lever instrument--he knew it well! But he looked at Spud O'Malley and waited for his nod of assent before he presumed to trespass on another pilot's domain. Then he shifted two little levers, and the ship fell away beneath them as it plunged toward the Earth.  And Pilot O'Malley was explaining to the Patrol Ship Captain as best he could for the rolling plunge of the careening ship:  \"I can't hold her, sir. And you'd best be keepin' away. It's stormin' fearful down here, and I can't rise above it! Keep clear!--I'm warnin' you!\" The hum of their helicopters rose to a shrill whine as Chet drove the ship out and down through the smothering clouds. \"You must hear her fans on your instruments; you can see how we're pitchin'!\"  He switched off the transmitter for a moment and faced Chet. \"They've been checkin' close,\" he stated. \"That was my engineer's number I gave you as we came through the gate. And, of course, he had given it before when he reported in. Now we're up against it.\"  The collision instrument was humming with the sound of many motors, and warning lights were giving their silent alarm of the oncoming ships.  \"They're comin' in,\" Spud went on hopelessly, \"like a flock of kites in the tropics when one of them's found somethin' dead--and it's us that's the carcass!\"         *       *       *       *       *  But Chet was not listening. The snowy clouds had broken for an instant; their ship had driven through and beneath them. Through the wild, whirling chaos of white there came for an instant a rift--and far across an icy expanse Chet glimpsed a range of black hills!  He spoke sharply to the pilot. \"That's Jimmy Maddux above us--kid him along, Spud! Tell him we're coming up, don't let him grab us with his magnets! This is putting you in a devil of a hole, old man. I'm sorry!--but we've got to see it through now.  \"You can never set this ship down, Spud; that patrol would be on our backs in half a second. And they'd knock me out with one shot the minute I stepped outside.\"  The clear space in the storm had filled again with the dirty gray of wind-whipped snow; off at the right a dim glow of distant fires was the midnight sun as it shone for a brief moment. One blast, more malignant in its fury than those that had come before, tore first at the blunt bow, then caught them amidships to roll the big, sluggish freighter till her racked framework shrieked and chattered.  Spud pointed through a rear lookout where a silvery Patrol Ship flashed down through the clouds. \"There's Jimmy!\" he shouted. \"He's takin' no chances of our landing--he's right on our tail!\"         *       *       *       *       *  But Chet Bullard, his hands working at the control levers, was staring straight ahead into that gray blast; and his eyes were shining as he pulled back on a lever that threw them once more into the concealment of the whirling clouds above.  \"Spud,\" he was shouting, \"have you got a 'chute? You freighters have 'em sometimes. Get me a 'chute and I'll fool them yet! I saw the shed--our hangars--our work shop! There's where our ship is!\"  They were lost once more in the snow that seemed to be driving past in solid drifts. Chet heard Spud shouting down a voice tube. And, curiously, it was plain that the Irish pilot had lost all tenseness from his voice; he was happy and as carefree as if he had found the answer to all his perplexing questions. He was calling an order to his relief pilot.  \"Mac--do ye break out two parachutes, me lad! Bring 'em up here, and shake a leg! No, there's nothin' to worry about--divil a thing!\"  Then, into the transmitter, he shouted thickly as he switched the instrument on:  \"Jimmy, me bhoy, kape away! Kape away, I'm tellin' you, or ye'll have me Irish temper disturbed, and I'm a divil whin I'm roused! What do I know about your twin ingineers? Wan of thim makes trouble enough for me! Now take yourself away, and don't step on the tail of this ship or we'll go down to glory together!--unless we go to another terminal and find oursilves in hell, and us all covered wid snow. Think how divilish conspicuous you'd be feelin'--\"         *       *       *       *       *  A discord of voices silenced his laughing banter; on the instrument board the warning light was flashing imperatively. Above the bedlam of voices one stood out, and all other commands went silent before the voice of authority.  \"Silence! This is the Commander of Air! Orders for O--sixteen--L: seize that ship! Your magnets!--disregard damage!--get your magnets on that ship and hold her. We are coming down--\"  Chet reached for the transmitter switch and opened it that their voices might not go beyond the control room.  \"Lots of company; they seem pretty certain that they're on the right track. And the big boss himself is coming down to call. Can't you hurry those 'chutes?\"  The control room door was flung open as the figure of a young man stumbled through and dropped two bundles of cloth and webbing upon the floor. He clung to the door-frame as Chet threw the big freighter into a totally unexpected maneuver that rolled them down and away from a silver-bellied ship above. Then the levers moved again, and the ship went hard-a-port as Chet caught again one fleeting glimpse of shadow below that could only be the markings of a building he had known well.  \"Hold her there, Spud!\" he shouted. \"He'll be back in a minute or two! He'll get us next time!\"  Chet was reaching for the straps of a 'chute. He had the webbing about him when he stopped to waste precious seconds in wide-eyed staring at the figure of Spud O'Malley.         *       *       *       *       *  Spud was pulling at a recalcitrant buckle. He had motioned the relief pilot to take the controls, and now the bulk of a parachute pack hung awkwardly behind him.  \"Spud!\" Chet shouted. \"You're not stepping out too! It's no sure thing with these old 'chutes; they're probably rotten! Stay here! Tell 'em I stuck you up with a gun!--tell 'em I made you bring me--\"  \"If you must talk,\" said Spud O'Malley calmly, and pulled a strap tight across his chest, \"do ye be tryin to work while you talk. Get that harness on! If I let you stow away on my ship you can do no less than take me along on yours!\"  A crashing impact drove the men to the floor in a sprawling heap; Chet pulled the last strap tight as he lay there. The lookouts were black above where the belly of a Patrol Ship clung close.  \"Jimmy knows how to obey orders,\" said Chet as he came to his feet. \"No cable magnets for Jimmy! He just smashed down on top of us, ripped off our fans and grabbed hold.\" He was helping Spud to his feet as he spoke.  \"Mac, me bhoy,\" the pilot told his assistant, \"the log has it all, the whole story. There'll be no trouble for you at all.\"  He yanked quickly at the port-opening switch, and the big steel disk backed slowly out of its threaded seat and swung wide.         *       *       *       *       *  Chet drew back one involuntary step as a blast of icy wind drove stinging snow into his face. Then, without a word, he gave Spud O'Malley a joyous grin and threw himself out into the void....  And, later, as he released the 'chute where a wind was dragging him violently across an icy expanse, he was laughing exultantly to see another 'chute whirled into the enshrouding drifts, while the chunky figure of a man came scrambling to his feet that he might shake a fist into the air toward some hidden enemy and shout into the storm epithets only half-heard.  \"--and be damned to ye!\" Chet heard him conclude; then was close enough to throw one arm about the figure and draw him after where he made his way toward a building that was like a mountain of snow.  Spud must have marveled at the craft within; at her sleek, shining sides; the flat nose that ended in a black exhaust port. He was examining the other exhausts that ringed her round when Chet pulled out a lever from the streamlined surface and swung open an entrance port.  He motioned Spud into the brilliantly lighted interior, where nitron illuminators were almost blinding as they shone of gleaming levers and dials of a control room like none that Spud O'Malley had ever seen.  Chet had thrown the building's doors open wide; a whirling motor had drawn them back on hidden tracks. Now he closed the entrance port with care, then glanced at his instruments before he placed his hand on a metal ball.         *       *       *       *       *  It hung suspended in air within a cage of curved bars. It was a modification of the high-liner ball-control, and it was new. Walt"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29717"],["title","The Finding of Haldgren (#5)"],["body","had had it installed to replace a more crudely fashioned substitute that had brought them safely back from the Dark Moon. The name of that new satellite was on Chet's lips as his thin hand rested delicately upon the ball.  \"It's not the Dark Moon this time, old girl,\" he told the ship, \"though you've taken me there twice. But we're going up just the same, and I told the Commander he hasn't Patrol Ships enough to hold us back.\" His fingers were gripping the little ball--lifting it--moving it forward....  And, as if he lifted the ship itself, the silent cylinder came roaring into life. Within the great building was a thundering blast that made the voice of the storm less than a whispering breath. It came but faintly through the heavily insulated walls, but Chet felt the lift of the ship, and that joyous smile was crinkling about his eyes as the silvery cylinder floated smoothly out of her shelter into the grip of the wind.  His eyes were on an upper lookout, where clouds were driving away like a curtain unrolled. More cloud banks were coming, but, for a time, the heavens were clear where the great red hull of a rusty freighter hung helpless beneath a red and silver Patrol Ship whose magnets held fast to its prey.         *       *       *       *       *  There were other shapes in the markings of the Service that shot slantingly down. Chet thought again of the carrion birds; then he saw the gold star on the bow of a great cruiser and knew from that ship that the Commander must be seeing their own below. Then he eased gently forward on a tiny ball--forward and forward, while the compensating floor of the control room swung up behind them and seemed thrusting up with unbearable weight.  There were flashes from the cruisers above, and flashes of red on the ice behind with fountains of shattered ice and rock; detonite works its most terrible destruction on a surface that is brittle and hard. But of what avail are detonite shells against a craft whose speed builds up to something greater than the muzzle velocity of a shell?--a silvery craft that sweeps out and out toward a black mountain range; then swings slowly up in a curve of sheer beauty that bends into banked masses of clouds--and ends.  But within the control room, Chet Bullard, no longer Master Pilot of the World, but master, in all truth, of space, knew that his ship's flight was far from ending. He turned to grin happily at his companion.  \"We're off!\" he shouted. \"And it's thanks to you that we made it. If Haldgren's alive he'll have you to thank; for it's you that has done the trick so far!\"  But Spud O'Malley answered soberly as he stared up and out into the blackness of levels he had never seen.  \"I've helped,\" he admitted; \"I've helped a bit. But it's a divil of a job of navigatin' that's ahead. And that's up to you, Chet Bullard; 'tis no job for an old omadhaun like mesilf!\"  Chet felt the lift of the Repelling Area as they shot through. Ahead was the black velvet night that he knew so well; its silent emptiness was pricked through with bright points of fire.  \"I found the Dark Moon,\" he said slowly, \"and that you can't see at all. This other will be easy.\"  There was no boastfulness in the tone, and Spud O'Malley nodded as he glanced respectfully at the young man who threw back his disheveled mop of hair from a lean face and marked down some cryptic figures on a record sheet.  Chet Bullard was on the job ... and his passenger, it would seem, was satisfied that his unbelievable adventure was well begun.     CHAPTER IV  _Life Monstrous and Horrible_   \"It looks,\" said Spud O'Malley, \"as if some bad little spalpeen of the skies had thrown pebbles at it when 'twas soft. It's fair pockmarked with places where the stones have hit.\"  He was staring through a forward lookout, where the whole sky seemed filled with a tremendous disk. One quarter was brilliantly alight; it formed a fat crescent within whose arms the rest of the globe was held in fainter glowing. By comparison, this greater portion was dark, though illuminated by earthlight far brighter than any moonlight on Earth.  But light or dark, the surface showed nothing but an appalling desolation where the rocky expanse had been still further torn and disrupted--pockmarked, as O'Malley had said, with great rings that had been the walls of tremendous volcanoes.  Chet was consulting a map where a similar area of circular markings had been named by scientists of an earlier day.  \"Hercules,\" he mused, and stared out at the great circle of the moon. \"The crater of Hercules! Yes, that must be it. That dark area off to one side is the Lake of Dreams; below it is the Lake of Death. Atlas! Hercules! Suffering cats, what volcanoes they must have been!\"  \"I don't like your names,\" objected O'Malley. \"Lake of Death! That's not so good. And I don't see any lake, and the whole Moon is wrong side up, according to your map.\"  Chet reached for the ball-control, moved it, and swung their ship in a slow, rotary motion. The result was an apparent revolution of the Moon.  \"There, it's right side up,\" Chet laughed; \"that is, if you can tell me what direction is 'up' out here in space. And, as for the names, don't let them disturb you; they don't mean anything. Some old-timer with a little three-inch telescope probably named them. The darker areas looked like seas to them. Astronomers have known better for a long time; and you and I--we're darned sure of it now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The great sea of shadow, a darker area within the shaded portion whose only light came from the Earth, was plainly a vast expanse of blackened rock. An immense depression, like the bottom of some earlier sea, it was heaved into corrugations that Chet knew would be mountain-high at close range. Marked with the orifices of what once had been volcanoes, the floor of that Lake of Death was hundreds of miles in extent.  But as for seas and lakes, there was no sign of water in the whole, vast, desolate globe. An unlikely place, Chet admitted, for the beginning of their search, and yet--those flashes of light!--the S O S! They had been real!  The bow blast had been roaring for over an hour; their strong deceleration made the forward part of the ship seem \"down.\" And down it was, too, by reason of the pull of the great globe they were approaching. But the roaring exhaust up ahead was checking their speed; Chet measured and timed the apparent growth of the Moon-disk and nodded his satisfaction at their reduced speed.  \"This will stop us,\" he said. \"I didn't know but we would have to swing off, shoot past, and return under control. But we're all right, and there is the place we are looking for--the big ring of Hercules, the level floor of rock inside it. And over at one side the smaller crater--\"         *       *       *       *       *  He was gazing entranced at the mammoth circle that had been a volcano's throat--the very one he had seen flashed on the screen. He moved the control to open a side exhaust and change their direction of fall. He was still staring, with emotions too overwhelming for words, and Spud O'Malley was silent beside him, as the great ring spread out and became an up-thrust circle of torn, jagged mountains some thirty or more miles across and directly below.  They fell softly into that circle. Its mountainous sides were high; they blocked off the view of the enormous terraces beyond that had been the crater's sloping sides.  From the direction that had suddenly become \"east,\" the rising sun's strong light struck in a slant to make the bar rocks seem incandescent. On one side the giant rim of the encircling mountains was black with shadow. The shadow reached out across the vast, rocky floor almost to the foot of the opposite wall many miles away. It enveloped their falling ship like a cushioning, ethereal sea: velvety, softly black, almost palpable.  It was wrapping them about in the darkness of night as Chet's slender hand touched so delicately upon the ball-control--checked them, eased off, drew back again until the thundering exhausts echoed softly where their ship hung suspended a hundred feet above a rocky floor. The shrouding darkness erased the harsh contours of mountain and plain; it seemed shielding this place of desolation and horror from critical, perhaps unfriendly eyes of these beings from another world. And Chet laid their ship down gently and silently on the earthlit plain as if he, too, felt this sense of intrusion--as if there might be those who would resent the trespass of unwanted guests.  But Spud O'Malley must have experienced no such delicacy of feeling. He let go one long pent-up breath.  \"And may the saints protect us!\" he said. \"The Lake of Death outside, and inside here is purgatory itself, or I don't know my geography. But you made it, Chet, me bhoy; you made it! What a sweet little pilot you are!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"There's air here,\" Chet was telling his companion later; \"air of a sort, but it's no good to us.\"  He pointed to the spectro-analyzer with its groupings of lines and light bands. \"Carbon dioxide,\" he explained, \"and some nitrogen, but mighty little of either. See the pressure gage; it's way down.  \"But that won't bother us too much. We've got some suits stowed away in the supplies that will hold an atmosphere of pressure, and their oxygen tanks will do the rest. We were ready for anything we might find on our Dark Moon trip, but we didn't need them there. Now they'll come in handy.\"  \"That's all right,\" O'Malley assured him; \"I've gone down under water in a diving suit; I've gone outside a ship for emergency repairs in a suit like yours when the air was as thin as this; I can stand it either way. But what I want to know is this:  \"What the divil chance is there of findin' your man, Haldgren, in such a frozen corner of purgatory as this? How could he live here? Here you've come in a fine, big ship, and his was a little bit of a bullet by"]]]
