Sew the gathered edge just inside this chalk mark so that the stitch will be covered by the skin.  [Illustration: Fig. 39.]  Quilt skin upon the lining with a good layer of cotton wadding between. Be sure and not draw down a bunch of hair under each loop. Tie the knots neatly on under side.  Fig. 39 shows incisions to make in removing a pelt for a symmetrical rug. Rug skins are best dried with no preservative whatever. In drying skins, stretch them symmetrically and dry in the shade.  [Illustration]     PREPARING AND MOUNTING A COYOTE     CHAPTER VI  PREPARING AND MOUNTING A COYOTE   This method may be applied to specimens from the size of a red fox or a bobcat up to a timber wolf. Remove the skin and prepare it in same way as that of a small mammal for mounting. When the carcass is bared in skinning, measure the girth of the neck at middle and at base; of the chest just behind the forelegs; the abdomen at its middle; the upper-arm at middle; the forearm just below elbow; the thigh at middle; the shank just below swell of thigh muscles back of knee, and the tail near its base. (See Fig. 40 for measurements.)  Lay the carcass upon a large piece of wrapping paper and take an outline of it complete, both before and after skinning.  Use same incisions and remove skin identically as in small specimen. Upon the outline sketch of peeled complete carcass set down the girth measurements in their proper places as taken with the tape. As in smaller specimens, these outline sketches will be found of great value as an aid to preserving natural lines in mounting.  [Illustration: Fig. 40.]  Wire the leg bones same as in a small mammal, using soft iron rod of sufficient size to support the specimen firmly. In our coyote a quarter-inch rod will be required. In a bobcat a three-sixteenths-inch rod will be large enough to support sturdily.  Bend the leg rods to fit the joints in position desired. Cut the rods of a length so that six or eight inches will protrude from the feet and eight or ten inches will remain free above to anchor to the body core. Bind the rods to the leg-bones with strong, light cord, doing the firmest wrapping near the joints.  Working over the body outline, cut a one-inch-thick board core that will set well within the outline. (See Fig. 41.)  [Illustration: Fig. 41.]  Cut a neck-rod of same size as for legs, having it twice as long as neck and head. Near one end of the neck-rod bend a jog to hold well when set with plaster of paris and chopped fiber into the brain cavity of the cleaned skull.  Wrap the leg muscles upon the bones same as in a small specimen, except pull the excelsior rather smooth for the purpose instead of rolling it in the palms. Make the Achilles tendon in same way and leave back of thigh off to be stuffed.  When the plaster to hold neck-rod in head is set, anchor the skull by the rod to the core-board in proper relation to the body. To do this, run the rod through a hole drilled through the board, clinch rod down forward and back with a hammer on anvil or vise, and fasten with staples, or drill a small hole through core-board each side of rod and tie the rod down with a strong loop of wire twisted down with the pliers.  Wrap the skull muscles on with excelsior rolled in palms of hands. Wrap a tail of pulled excelsior laid straight along a wire much smaller than is used in legs.  [Illustration: Fig. 42.]  Drill the center-board for legs and tail as shown in Fig. 42, which shows general assembling details. When the legs, head, and tail are finished, push the head and body-core into place in the skin, shove in the legs and tail, and wire the legs and tail fast in the center-board same as head was fastened.  The remainder of the mounting is accomplished in exactly the same way as the filling and finishing of a small mammal specimen, _i. e._, by stuffing the neck, body, and back of thighs and finishing the face and feet with a batch of papier-mache compo. No. 2. If the mouth is to be open, follow directions given for finishing an entire rug-head.  [Illustration: Fig. 43.]  To hold in the hollow of the flanks, cut several short, strong pieces of wire, sharpen them to cutting points, push them through the skin along line of hollow in front of hip, drive them firmly into the core-board, and then, with cutting pliers clinch their ends down to hold the skin in and cut off surplus wire, picking the fur out well to cover them. (See Fig. 43.)  [Illustration: Fig. 44.]  To support the compo.-filled ears until set and dry, drive a sharpened wire into the head, through hollow of ear. Point the wire in direction ear is to lay or stand and between ear and wire lay a loose, flat wad of cotton or tow. With a furrier's needle and thread take a narrow loop through center of ear near tip and tie lightly around wire to hold until dry. When dry remove the thread with scissors and the wires by a slight twist with pliers.  Mammals of the sizes named may be mounted so skillfully by this method that they cannot be told from mannikin specimens.  Specimens of this size need not be entirely mounted at one sitting. Prepare the skin, wire and wrap the legs and head, and make the center-board in one day, assemble the specimen and place the body filling the next day, and make the feet, mount the specimen, and finish the head the third day.  A little carbolic acid in the arsenic-water will help keep the skin from slipping the hair. Also keep unfinished parts wrapped in damp cloths wrung from carbolic acid water.

NET,            POSTAGE 5c. EXTRA     THE NUMBERS MAKE ORDERING EASY.  1. EXERCISE AND HEALTH, by Dr. Woods Hutchinson. Dr. Hutchinson takes the common-sense view that the greatest problem in exercise for most of us is to get enough of the right kind. The greatest error in exercise is not to take enough, and the greatest danger in athletics is in giving them up. He writes in a direct matter-of-fact manner with an avoidance of medical terms, and a strong emphasis on the rational, all-around manner of living that is best calculated to bring a man to a ripe old age with little illness or consciousness of bodily weakness.  2. CAMP COOKERY, by Horace Kephart. \"The less a man carries in his pack the more he must carry in his head,\" says Mr. Kephart. This book tells what a man should carry in both pack and head. Every step is traced--the selection of provisions and utensils, with the kind and quantity of each, the preparation of game, the building of fires, the cooking of every conceivable kind of food that the camp outfit or woods, fields or streams may provide--even to the making of desserts. Every recipe is the result of hard practice and long experience.  3. BACKWOODS SURGERY AND MEDICINE, by Charles S. Moody, M. D. A handy book for the prudent lover of the woods who doesn't expect to be ill but believes in being on the safe side. Common-sense methods for the treatment of the ordinary wounds and accidents are described--setting a broken limb, reducing a dislocation, caring for burns, cuts, etc. Practical remedies for camp diseases are recommended, as well as the ordinary indications of the most probable ailments. Includes a list of the necessary medical and surgical supplies.  4. APPLE GROWING, by M. C. Burritt. The various problems confronting the apple grower, from the preparation of the soil and the planting of the trees to the marketing of the fruit, are discussed in detail by the author.  5. THE AIREDALE, by Williams Haynes. The book opens with a short chapter on the origin and development of the Airedale, as a distinctive breed. The author then takes up the problems of type as bearing on the selection of the dog, breeding, training and use. The book is designed for the non-professional dog fancier, who wishes common sense advice which does not involve elaborate preparations or expenditure. Chapters are included on the care of the dog in the kennel and simple remedies for ordinary diseases.  6. THE AUTOMOBILE--Its Selection, Care and Use, by Robert Sloss. This is a plain, practical discussion of the things that every man needs to know if he is to buy the right car and get the most out of it.

Blue Book printed more than a     dozen of these stories by Nelson Bond about the \"greatest     inventulator of all time\"._    lighter     than      you    think   _by NELSON BOND_    Sandy's eyes needed only jet propulsion to become flying  saucers. Wasn't Pat wonderful? she beamed, at everyone.   Some joker in the dear, dead days now virtually beyond recall won two-bit immortality by declaring that, \"What this country needs is a good five-cent cigar.\"  Which is, of course, Victorian malarkey. What this country _really_ needs is a good five-cent nickel. Or perhaps a good cigar-shaped spaceship. There's a fortune waiting somewhere out in space for the man who can go out there and claim it. A fortune! And if you think I'm just talking through my hat, lend an ear ...  Joyce started the whole thing. Or maybe I did when for the umpteenth time I suggested she should marry me. She smiled in a way that showed she didn't disapprove of my persistence, but loosed a salvo of devastating negatives.  \"No deal,\" she crisped decisively. \"Know why? No dough!\"  \"But, sugar,\" I pleaded, \"two can live as cheaply as one--\"  \"This is true,\" replied Joyce, \"only of guppies. Understand, Don, I don't mind changing my name from Carter to Mallory. In fact, I'd rather like to. But I have no desire whatever to be known to the neighbors as 'that poor little Mrs. Mallory in last year's coat.'  \"I'll marry you,\" she continued firmly, \"when, as and if you get a promotion.\"  Her answer was by no stretch of the imagination a reason for loud cheers, handsprings and cartwheels. Because I'm a Federal employee. The United States Patent Office is my beat. There's one nice thing to be said about working for the bewhiskered old gentleman in the star-spangled stovepipe and striped britches: it's permanent. Once you get your name inscribed on the list of Civil Service employees it takes an act of Congress to blast it off again. And of course I don't have to remind you how long it takes _that_ body of vote-happy windbags to act. Terrapins in treacle are greased lightning by comparison.  But advancement is painfully slow in a department where discharges are unheard of and resignations rare. When I started clerking for this madhouse I was assistant to the assistant Chief Clerk's assistant. Now, ten years later, by dint of mighty effort and a cultivated facility for avoiding Senatorial investigations, I've succeeded in losing only one of those redundant adjectives.  Being my secretary, Joyce certainly realized this. But women have a remarkable ability to separate business and pleasure. So:  \"A promotion,\" she insisted. \"Or at least a good, substantial raise.\"  \"In case you don't know it,\" I told her gloomily, \"you are displaying a lamentably vulgar interest in one of life's lesser values. Happiness, not money, should be man's chief goal.\"  \"What good is happiness,\" demanded Joyce, \"if you can't buy money with it?\"  \"Why hoard lucre?\" I sniffed. \"You can't take it with you.\"  \"In that case,\" said Joyce flatly, \"I'm not going. There's no use arguing, Don. I've made up my mind--\"  At this moment our dreary little impasse was ended by a sudden tumult outside my office. There was a squealing shriek, the shuffle of footsteps, the pounding of fists upon my door. And over all the shrill tones of an old, familiar voice high-pitched in triumph.  \"Let me in! I've got to see him instantaceously. This time I've got it; I've absolutely _got_ it!\"  Joyce and I gasped, then broke simultaneously for the door as it flew open to reveal a tableau resembling the Laocoon group _sans_ snake and party of the third part. Back to the door and struggling valiantly to defend it stood the receptionist, Miss Thomas. Held briefly but volubly at bay was a red-thatched, buck-toothed individual--and I _do_ mean individual!--with a face like the map of Eire, who stopped wrestling as he saw us, and grinned delightedly.  \"Hello, Mr. Mallory,\" he said. \"Hi, Miss Joyce.\"  \"Pat!\" we both cried at once. \"Pat Pending!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Miss Thomas, a relative newcomer to our bailiwick, seemed baffled by the warmth of our greeting. She entered the office with our visitor, and as Joyce and I pumphandled him enthusiastically she asked, \"You--you _know_ this gentleman, Mr. Mallory?\"  \"I should say we do!\" I chortled. \"Pat, you old naughty word! Where on earth have you been hiding lately?\"  \"Surely you've heard of the great Patrick Pending, Miss Thomas?\" asked Joyce.  \"Pending?\" faltered Miss Thomas. \"I seem to have heard the name. Or seen it somewhere--\"  Pat beamed upon her companionably. Stepping to my desk, he up-ended the typewriter and pointed to a legend in tiny letters stamped into the frame: _Reg. U.S. Pat. Off.--Pat. Pending._  \"Here, perhaps?\" he suggested. \"I invented this. And the airplane, and the automobile, and--oh, ever so many things. You'll find my name inscribed on every one.  \"I,\" he announced modestly, \"am Pat Pending--the greatest inventulator of all time.\"  Miss Thomas stared at me goggle-eyed.  \"_Is_ he?\" she demanded. \"I mean--_did_ he?\"  I nodded solemnly.  \"Not only those, but a host of other marvels. The bacular clock, the transmatter, the predictograph--\"  Miss Thomas turned on Pat a gaze of fawning admiration. \"How wonderful!\" she breathed.  \"Oh, nothing, really,\" said Pat, wriggling.  \"But it is! Most of the things brought here are so absurd. Automatic hat-tippers, self-defrosting galoshes, punching bags that defend themselves--\" Disdainfully she indicated the display collection of screwball items we call our Chamber of Horrors. \"It's simply marvelous to meet a man who has invented things really worth while.\"  Honestly, the look in her eyes was sickening. But was Pat nauseated? Not he! The big goon was lapping it up like a famished feline. His simpering smirk stretched from ear to there as he murmured, \"Now, Miss Thomas--\"  \"Sandra, Mr. Pending,\" she sighed softly. \"To you just plain ... Sandy. Please?\"  \"Well, Sandy--\" Pat gulped.  I said disgustedly, \"Look, you two--break it up! Love at first sight is wonderful in books, but in a Federal office I'm pretty sure it's unconstitutional, and it _may_ be subversive. Would you mind coming down to earth? Pat, you barged in here squalling about some new invention. Is that correct?\"  With an effort Pat wrenched his gaze from his new-found admirer and nodded soberly.  \"That's right, Mr. Mallory. And a great one, too. One that will revolutionate the world. Will you give me an applicaceous form, please? I want to file it immediately.\"  \"Not so fast, Pat. You know the routine. What's the nature of this remarkable discovery?\"  \"You may write it down,\" said Pat grandiloquently, \"as Pat Pending's lightening rod.\"  I glanced at Joyce, and she at me, then both of us at Pending.  \"But, Pat,\" I exclaimed, \"that's ridiculous! Ben Franklin invented the lightning rod two hundred years ago.\"  \"I said _lightening_,\" retorted my redheaded friend, \"not _lightning_. My invention doesn't conduct electricity _to_ the ground, but _from_ it.\" He brandished a slim baton which until then I had assumed to be an ordinary walking-stick. \"With this,\" he claimed, \"I can make things weigh as much or as little as I please!\"  The eyes of Sandy Thomas needed only jet propulsion to become flying saucers.  \"Isn't he wonderful, Mr. Mallory?\" she gasped.  But her enthusiasm wasn't contagious. I glowered at Pending coldly.  \"Oh, come now, Pat!\" I scoffed. \"You can't really believe that yourself. After all, there _are_ such things as basic principles. Weight is not a variable factor. And so far as I know, Congress hasn't repealed the Law of Gravity.\"  Pat sighed regretfully.  \"You're always so hard to convince, Mr. Mallory,\" he complained. \"But--oh, well! Take this.\"  He handed me the baton. I stared at it curiously. It looked rather like a British swagger stick: slim, dainty, well balanced. But the ornamental gadget at its top was not commonplace. It seemed to be a knob or a dial of some kind, divided into segments scored with vernier markings. I gazed at Pending askance.  \"Well, Pat? What now?\"  \"How much do you weigh, Mr. Mallory?\"  \"One sixty-five,\" I answered.  \"You're sure of that?\"  \"I'm not. But my bathroom scales appeared to be. This morning. Why?\"  \"Do you think Miss Joyce could lift you?\"  I said thoughtfully, \"Well, that's an idea. But I doubt it. She won't even let me try to support _her_.\"  \"I'm serious, Mr. Mallory. Do you think she could lift you with one hand?\"  \"Don't be silly! Of course not. Nor could you.\"  \"There's where you're wrong,\" said Pending firmly. \"She can--and will.\"  He reached forward suddenly and twisted the metal cap on the stick in my hands. As he did so, I loosed a cry of alarm and almost dropped the baton. For instantaneously I experienced a startling, flighty giddiness, a sudden loss of weight that made me feel as if my soles were treading on sponge rubber, my shoulders sprouting wings.  \"Hold on to it!\" cried Pat. Then to Joyce, \"Lift him, Miss Joyce.\"  Joyce faltered, \"How? Like th-this?\" and touched a finger to my midriff. Immediately my feet left the floor. I started flailing futilely to trample six inches of ozone back to the solid floorboards. To no avail. With no effort whatever Joyce raised me high above her head until my dazed dome was shedding dandruff on the ceiling!  \"Well, Mr. Mallory,\" said Pat, \"do you believe me now?\"  \"Get me down out of here!\" I howled. \"You _know_ I can't stand high places!\"  \"You now weigh less than ten pounds--\"  \"Never mind the statistics. I feel like a circus balloon. How do I get down again?\"  \"Turn the knob on the cane,\" advised Pat, \"to your normal weight. Careful, now! _Not so fast!_\"  His warning came too late. I hit the deck with a resounding thud, and the cane came clattering after."]]]
