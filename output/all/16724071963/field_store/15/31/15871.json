After that he lay down and slept till morning dawned, and the man came and unlocked the door and shook the sleeper.  ‘Here is the cap,’ said Ian drowsily, drawing it from under his pillow.  And he fell asleep again directly.  The sun was high in the heavens when he woke again, and this time he beheld a tall, brown- haired youth standing by him.  ‘I am the raven,’ said the youth, ‘and the spells are broken.  But now get up and come with me.’  Then they two went together to the place where Ian had left the dead horse; but no horse was there now, only a beautiful maiden.  ‘I am the horse,’ she said, ‘and the spells are broken’; and she and the youth went away together.  In the meantime the smith had carried the cap to the castle, and bade a servant belonging to the knight’s youngest daughter bear it to her mistress.  But when the girl’s eyes fell on it, she cried out:  ‘He speaks false; and if he does not bring me the man who really made the cap I will hang him on the tree beside my window.’  The servant was filled with fear at her words, and hastened and told the smith, who ran as fast as he could to seek for Ian.  And when he found him and brought him into the castle, the girl was first struck dumb with joy; then she declared that she would marry nobody else.  At this some one fetched to her the knight of Grianaig, and when Ian had told his tale, he vowed that the maiden was right, and that his elder daughters should never wed with men who had not only taken glory to themselves which did not belong to them, but had left the real doer of the deeds to his fate.  And the wedding guests said that the knight had spoken well; and the two elder brothers were fain to leave the country, for no one would converse with them.  [From Tales of the West Highlands.]                 The Fox and the Wolf    At the foot of some high mountains there was, once upon a time, a small village, and a little way off two roads met, one of them going to the east and the other to the west.  The villagers were quiet, hard-working folk, who toiled in the fields all day, and in the evening set out for home when the bell began to ring in the little church.  In the summer mornings they led out their flocks to pasture, and were happy and contented from sunrise to sunset.  One summer night, when a round full moon shone down upon the white road, a great wolf came trotting round the corner.  ‘I positively must get a good meal before I go back to my den,’ he said to himself; ‘it is nearly a week since I have tasted anything but scraps, though perhaps no one would think it to look at my figure!  Of course there are plenty of rabbits and hares in the mountains; but indeed one needs to be a greyhound to catch them, and I am not so young as I was!  If I could only dine off that fox I saw a fortnight ago, curled up into a delicious hairy ball, I should ask nothing better; I would have eaten her then, but unluckily her husband was lying beside her, and one knows that foxes, great and small, run like the wind. Really it seems as if there was not a living creature left for me to prey upon but a wolf, and, as the proverb says: “One wolf does not bite another.” However, let us see what this village can produce.  I am as hungry as a schoolmaster.’  Now, while these thoughts were running through the mind of the wolf, the very fox he had been thinking of was galloping along the other road.  ‘The whole of this day I have listened to those village hens clucking till I could bear it no longer,’ murmured she as she bounded along, hardly seeming to touch the ground.  ‘When you are fond of fowls and eggs it is the sweetest of all music.  As sure as there is a sun in heaven I will have some of them this night, for I have grown so thin that my very bones rattle, and my poor babies are crying for food.’ And as she spoke she reached a little plot of grass, where the two roads joined, and flung herself under a tree to take a little rest, and to settle her plans.  At this moment the wolf came up.  At the sight of the fox lying within his grasp his mouth began to water, but his joy was somewhat checked when he noticed how thin she was.  The fox’s quick ears heard the sound of his paws, though they were soft as velvet, and turning her head she said politely:  ‘Is that you, neighbour?  What a strange place to meet in!  I hope you are quite well?’  ‘Quite well as regards my health,’ answered the wolf, whose eye glistened greedily, ‘at least, as well as one can be when one is very hungry.  But what is the matter with you?  A fortnight ago you were as plump as heart could wish!’  ‘I have been ill--very ill,’ replied the fox, ‘and what you say is quite true.  A worm is fat in comparison with me.’  ‘He is.  Still, you are good enough for me; for “to the hungry no bread is hard.”’  ‘Oh, you are always joking!  I’m sure you are not half as hungry as I!’  ‘That we shall soon see,’ cried the wolf, opening his huge mouth and crouching for a spring.  ‘What are you doing?’ exclaimed the fox, stepping backwards.  ‘What am I doing?  What I am going to do is to make my supper off you, in less time than a cock takes to crow.’  ‘Well, I suppose you must have your joke,’ answered the fox lightly, but never removing her eye from the wolf, who replied with a snarl which showed all his teeth:  ‘I don’t want to joke, but to eat!’  ‘But surely a person of your talents must perceive that you might eat me to the very last morsel and never know that you had swallowed anything at all!’  ‘In this world the cleverest people are always the hungriest,’ replied the wolf.  ‘Ah! how true that is; but--’  ‘I can’t stop to listen to your “buts” and “yets,”’ broke in the wolf rudely; ‘let us get to the point, and the point is that I want to eat you and not talk to you.’  ‘Have you no pity for a poor mother?’ asked the fox, putting her tail to her eyes, but peeping slily out of them all the same.  ‘I am dying of hunger,’ answered the wolf, doggedly; ‘and you know,’ he added with a grin, ‘that charity begins at home.’  ‘Quite so,’ replied the fox; ‘it would be unreasonable of me to object to your satisfying your appetite at my expense.  But if the fox resigns herself to the sacrifice, the mother offers you one last request.’  ‘Then be quick and don’t waste my time, for I can’t wait much longer. What is it you want?’  ‘You must know,’ said the fox, ‘that in this village there is a rich man who makes in the summer enough cheeses to last him for the whole year, and keeps them in an old well, now dry, in his courtyard.  By the well hang two buckets on a pole that were used, in former days, to draw up water.  For many nights I have crept down to the palace, and have lowered myself in the bucket, bringing home with me enough cheese to feed the children.  All I beg of you is to come with me, and, instead of hunting chickens and such things, I will make a good meal off cheese before I die.’  ‘But the cheeses may be all finished by now?’  ‘If you were only to see the quantities of them!’ laughed the fox. ‘And even if they were finished, there would always be ME to eat.’  ‘Well, I will come.  Lead the way, but I warn you that if you try to escape or play any tricks you are reckoning without your host-- that is to say, without my legs, which are as long as yours!’  All was silent in the village, and not a light was to be seen but that of the moon, which shone bright and clear in the sky.  The wolf and the fox crept softly along, when suddenly they stopped and looked at each other; a savoury smell of frying bacon reached their noses, and reached the noses of the sleeping dogs, who began to bark greedily.  ‘Is it safe to go on, think you?’ asked the wolf in a whisper.  And the fox shook her head.  ‘Not while the dogs are barking,’ said she; ‘someone might come out to see if anything was the matter.’  And she signed to the wolf to curl himself up in the shadow beside her.  In about half an hour the dogs grew tired of barking, or perhaps the bacon was eaten up and there was no smell to excite them.  Then the wolf and the fox jumped up, and hastened to the foot of the wall.  ‘I am lighter than he is,’ thought the fox to herself, ‘and perhaps if I make haste I can get a start, and jump over the wall on the other side before he manages to spring over this one.’  And she quickened her pace.  But if the wolf could not run he could jump, and with one bound he was beside his companion.  ‘What were you going to do, comrade?’  ‘Oh, nothing,’ replied the fox, much vexed at the failure of her plan.  ‘I think if I were to take a bit out of your haunch you would jump better,’ said the wolf, giving a snap at her as he spoke.  The fox drew back uneasily.  ‘Be careful, or I shall scream,’ she snarled.  And the wolf, understanding all that might happen if the fox carried out her threat, gave a signal to his companion to leap on the wall, where he immediately followed her.  Once on the top they crouched down and looked about them.  Not a creature was to be seen in the courtyard, and in the furthest corner from the house stood the well, with its two buckets suspended from a pole, just as the fox had described it.  The two thieves dragged themselves noiselessly along the wall till they were opposite the well, and by stretching out her neck as far as it would go the fox was able to make out that there was only very little water in the bottom, but just enough to reflect the moon, big, and round and yellow.  ‘How lucky!’ cried she to the wolf.  ‘There is a huge cheese about the size of a mill wheel.  Look! look! did you ever see anything so beautiful!’  ‘Never!’ answered the wolf, peering over in his turn, his eyes glistening greedily, for he imagined that the moon’s reflection in the water was really a cheese.  ‘And now, unbeliever, what have you to say?’ and the fox laughed gently.  ‘That you are a woman--I mean a fox--of your word,’ replied the wolf.  ‘Well, then, go down in that bucket and eat"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3027"],["title","The Orange Fairy Book (#8)"],["body","fill,’ said the fox.  ‘Oh, is that your game?’ asked the wolf, with a grin.  ‘No! no!  The person who goes down in the bucket will be you!  And if you don’t go down your head will go without you!’  ‘Of course I will go down, with the greatest pleasure,’ answered the fox, who had expected the wolf’s reply.  ‘And be sure you don’t eat all the cheese, or it will be the worse for you,’ continued the wolf.  But the fox looked up at him with tears in her eyes.  ‘Farewell, suspicious one!’ she said sadly.  And climbed into the bucket.  In an instant she had reached the bottom of the well, and found that the water was not deep enough to cover her legs.  ‘Why, it is larger and richer than I thought,’ cried she, turning towards the wolf, who was leaning over the wall of the well.  ‘Then be quick and bring it up,’ commanded the wolf.  ‘How can I, when it weighs more than I do?’ asked the fox.  ‘If it is so heavy bring it in two bits, of course,’ said he.  ‘But I have no knife,’ answered the fox.  ‘You will have to come down yourself, and we will carry it up between us.’  ‘And how am I to come down?’ inquired the wolf.  ‘Oh, you are really very stupid!  Get into the other bucket that is nearly over your head.’  The wolf looked up, and saw the bucket hanging there, and with some difficulty he climbed into it.  As he weighed at least four times as much as the fox the bucket went down with a jerk, and the other bucket, in which the fox was seated, came to the surface.  As soon as he understood what was happening, the wolf began to speak like an angry wolf, but was a little comforted when he remembered that the cheese still remained to him.  ‘But where is the cheese?’ he asked of the fox, who in her turn was leaning over the parapet watching his proceedings with a smile.  ‘The cheese?’ answered the fox; ‘why I am taking it home to my babies, who are too young to get food for themselves.’  ‘Ah, traitor!’ cried the wolf, howling with rage.  But the fox was not there to hear this insult, for she had gone off to a neighbouring fowl-house, where she had noticed some fat young chickens the day before.  ‘Perhaps I did treat him rather badly,’ she said to herself.  ‘But it seems getting cloudy, and if there should be heavy rain the other bucket will fill and sink to the bottom, and his will go up--at least it may!’  [From Cuentos Populares, por Antonio de Trueba.]         How Ian Direach Got the Blue Falcon    Long ago a king and queen ruled over the islands of the west, and they had one son, whom they loved dearly.  The boy grew up to be tall and strong and handsome, and he could run and shoot, and swim and dive better than any lad of his own age in the country.  Besides, he knew how to sail about, and sing songs to the harp, and during the winter evenings, when everyone was gathered round the huge hall fire shaping bows or weaving cloth, Ian Direach would tell them tales of the deeds of his fathers.  So the time slipped by till Ian was almost a man, as they reckoned men in those days, and then his mother the queen died.  There was great mourning throughout all the isles, and the boy and his father mourned her bitterly also; but before the new year came the king had married another wife, and seemed to have forgotten his old one.  Only Ian remembered.  On a morning when the leaves were yellow in the trees of the glen, Ian slung his bow over his shoulder, and filling his quiver with arrows, went on to the hill in search of game.  But not a bird was to be seen anywhere, till at length a blue falcon flew past him, and raising his bow he took aim at her.  His eye was straight and his hand steady, but the falcon’s flight was swift, and he only shot a feather from her wing.  As the sun was now low over the sea he put the feather in his game bag, and set out homewards.  ‘Have you brought me much game to-day?’ asked his stepmother as he entered the hall.  ‘Nought save this,’ he answered, handing her the feather of the blue falcon, which she held by the tip and gazed at silently.  Then she turned to Ian and said:  ‘I am setting it on you as crosses and as spells, and as the fall of the year!  That you may always be cold, and wet and dirty, and that your shoes may ever have pools in them, till you bring me hither the blue falcon on which that feather grew.’  ‘If it is spells you are laying I can lay them too,’ answered Ian Direach; ‘and you shall stand with one foot on the great house and another on the castle, till I come back again, and your face shall be to the wind, from wheresoever it shall blow.’  Then he went away to seek the bird, as his stepmother bade him; and, looking homewards from the hill, he saw the queen standing with one foot on the great house, and the other on the castle, and her face turned towards whatever tempest should blow.  On he journeyed, over hills, and through rivers till he reached a wide plain, and never a glimpse did he catch of the falcon.  Darker and darker it grew, and the small birds were seeking their nests, and at length Ian Direach could see no more, and he lay down under some bushes and sleep came to him.  And in his dream a soft nose touched him, and a warm body curled up beside him, and a low voice whispered to him:  ‘Fortune is against you, Ian Direach; I have but the cheek and the hoof of a sheep to give you, and with these you must be content.’  With that Ian Direach awoke, and beheld Gille Mairtean the fox.  Between them they kindled a fire, and ate their supper.  Then Gille Mairtean the fox bade Ian Direach lie down as before, and sleep till morning.  And in the morning, when he awoke, Gille Mairtean said:  ‘The falcon that you seek is in the keeping of the Giant of the Five Heads, and the Five Necks, and the Five Humps.  I will show you the way to his house, and I counsel you to do his bidding, nimbly and cheerfully, and, above all, to treat his birds kindly, for in this manner he may give you his falcon to feed and care for.  And when this happens, wait till the giant is out of his house; then throw a cloth over the falcon and bear her away with you.  Only see that not one of her feathers touches anything within the house, or evil will befall you.’  ‘I thank you for your counsel,’ spake Ian Direach, ‘and I will be careful to follow it.’  Then he took the path to the giant’s house.  ‘Who is there?’ cried the giant, as someone knocked loudly on the door of his house.  ‘One who seeks work as a servant,’ answered Ian Direach.  ‘And what can you do?’ asked the giant again.  ‘I can feed birds and tend pigs; I can feed and milk a cow, and also goats and sheep, if you have any of these,’ replied Ian Direach.  ‘Then enter, for I have great need of such a one,’ said the giant.  So Ian Direach entered, and tended so well and carefully all the birds and beasts, that the giant was better satisfied than ever he had been, and at length he thought that he might even be trusted to feed the falcon.  And the heart of Ian was glad, and he tended the blue falcon till his fathers shone like the sky, and the giant was well pleased; and one day he said to him:  ‘For long my brothers on the other side of the mountain have besought me to visit them, but never could I go for fear of my falcon.  Now I think I can leave her with you for one day, and before nightfall I shall be back again.’  Scarcely was the giant out of sight next morning when Ian Direach seized the falcon, and throwing a cloth over her head hastened with her to the door.  But the rays of the sun pierced through the thickness of the cloth, and as they passed the doorpost she gave a spring, and the tip of one of her feathers touched the post, which gave a scream, and brought the giant back in three strides.  Ian Direach trembled as he saw him; but the giant only said:  ‘If you wish for my falcon you must first bring me the White Sword of Light that is in the house of the Big Women of Dhiurradh.’  ‘And where do they live?’ asked Ian.  But the giant answered:  ‘Ah, that is for you to discover.’  And Ian dared say no more, and hastened down to the waste.  There, as he hoped, he met his friend Gille Mairtean the fox, who bade him eat his supper and lie down to sleep.  And when he had wakened next morning the fox said to him:  ‘Let us go down to the shore of the sea.’  And to the shore of the sea they went.  And after they had reached the shore, and beheld the sea stretching before them, and the isle of Dhiurradh in the midst of it, the soul of Ian sank, and he turned to Gille Mairtean and asked why he had brought him thither, for the giant, when he had sent him, had known full well that without a boat he could never find the Big Women.  ‘Do not be cast down,’ answered the fox, ‘it is quite easy!  I will change myself into a boat, and you shall go on board me, and I will carry you over the sea to the Seven Big Women of Dhiurradh.  Tell them that you are skilled in brightening silver and gold, and in the end they will take you as servant, and if you are careful to please them they will give you the White Sword of Light to make bright and shining.  But when you seek to steal it, take heed that its sheath touches nothing inside the house, or ill will befall you.’  So Ian Direach did all things as the fox had told him, and the Seven Big Women of Dhiurradh took him for their servant, and for six weeks he worked so hard that his seven mistresses said to each other: ‘Never has a servant had the skill to make all bright and shining like this one. Let us give him the White Sword of Light to polish like the rest.’  Then they brought forth the White Sword of Light from the iron closet where it hung, and bade him rub it till he could see his face in the shining blade; and he did so.  But one day, when the Seven Big Women were out of the way, he bethought him that the moment had come for him to carry off the sword, and, replacing it in its sheath, he hoisted it on his shoulder.  But just as he was passing through the door the tip of the sheath touched it, and the door"]]]
