(#0)"],["body","Earth's espionage ring was a headache, so the Martian Security Chief     offered ten thousand credits for a key agent. But even for a price--   SPIES DIE HARD!  _By Arnold Marmor_   \"This man is a spy for Earth,\" a voice droned, as the telecaster vibrated and a photo of Harry Horn flashed on the screen. \"Ten thousand credits for this man, dead or alive. Contact Lazar of the Security Police. Harry Horn. Thirty-four, five feet, eleven inches, one hundred and seventy-two pounds.\"  Lynn Brickel snapped off the humming machine. She frowned. Horn had been high in the Martian Security Police, one of Lazar's top men. Now Horn turned out to be a spy for Earth. Why hadn't she been told? Was Green losing his trust in her? Hadn't she helped McLean and Sanderson escape from Mars?  Her short tunic shimmered as she began to pace the floor. She stopped short as a hum splashed through the room. She went quickly to the door and pressed a red button on the wall.  But the vibration of the elevator did not reach her ears. Puzzled, she opened the door, stepped into the marble hall. She shrugged, started to return to her apartment when the sound of footsteps on the stairs halted her. She waited.  He came into view. Harry Horn. There was no mistaking his face. It had flashed on and off the telecaster throughout the day.  \"Brickel?\" he said, coming up to her.  His white coveralls were spotted with grime. There was a dark bruise on his right cheek.  \"Yes,\" she said.  \"I'm Harry Horn.\"  \"I know.\"  \"You've got to help me.\" His voice was urgent, pleading. He brushed past her, into her room. She walked in after him, shut and locked the door, leaned her back against it.  \"You can't stay here,\" she said.  \"Are you alone?\"  \"Yes,\" she said. \"I'm alone.\"  He went through the apartment, returned to the front room. \"I had to make sure.\" He sank into the low divan, covered his face with his hands.  She walked toward him. \"You can't stay here,\" she repeated.  He looked up at her, his eyes frightened. \"Do you have any idea of what Lazar will do to me once he gets his fat hands around my throat? He won't kill me right away.\"  \"Why come to me?\"  \"You can help me.\"  \"What can I do?\"  \"You can help me get away. A turbo-engine space ship. That's all I need. It's small and fast.\"  \"But why come to me? You haven't explained.\"  \"You helped McLean and Sanderson.\"  \"How do you know this?\"  \"We're both in the same organization but not in the same unit. The leader of my unit instructed me to go to you.\"  \"I see. Who is your leader?\"  \"I can't tell you. You know that. I wouldn't ask you your leader's name.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lynn shrugged slim shoulders. \"It wouldn't make any difference. He is not stationed on Mars.\"  Horn jumped to his feet. \"You will help me?\"  \"If I can.\"  \"Can you get me the ship?\"  \"I suppose. But we'll have to wait for night. It is dangerous to do anything now. Ten thousand credits. Lazar wants you awful bad. He offered five for both McLean and Sanderson.\"  \"I was very close to Lazar in the Security Police. I know too much.\"  \"We all make mistakes.\"  \"I envy your logic. But I can't see it that way. I was considered too good an agent to make a mistake.\"  \"It's too late to cry over it now. When it is dark I'll contact--a friend--and have the space ship ready.\"  Horn grinned. \"You're still not sure of me?\"  \"It isn't that. But you don't belong to my unit. We can't name names to outsiders.\"  \"You're right, of course. You've been well trained.\"  \"Are you hungry?\"  \"Yes.\"  She set food in front of him and watched him eat.  \"What is Lazar like?\" she asked. \"I have heard of him.\"  \"Cruel,\" he said. \"A sadist. Death is the easy way out when you're in Lazar's hands.\"  \"It will soon be dark,\" she said.  He stood up, his hunger satisfied. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"was it difficult getting Sanderson and McLean out of Mars?\"  \"No,\" she said. \"Not difficult at all.\"  \"Good.\" He went to the interphone. He dialed, spoke, \"You may come up now.\"  \"What are you doing?\" her face paled.  He turned to her, smiling. \"Lazar was wondering how Sanderson and McLean escaped. You were on the master list of suspects. I was waiting for you to confess.\"  Lynn stiffened. \"It--it was a trick.\"  \"That's right, Brickel. Too bad. You're too pretty to die.\"  \"That--that was a message to Lazar.\"  \"Yes. He'll be here shortly.\"  Lynn slipped her hand in the pocket of her tunic, brought out a small blaster.  \"Don't be a fool,\" Horn said. \"Maybe you'll be spared. Why take your life? Just tell all you know?\"  Lynn smiled. \"I wasn't thinking of taking my life. But yours.\"  Horn frowned. \"Don't be an idiot.\" He advanced toward her.  Lynn shook her head slowly. \"Now it's my turn to be clever.\"  Horn's face went wild. \"You can't escape Lazar! Listen to me--\"  She blasted him.         *       *       *       *       *  Lynn opened the door.  Lazar stood there, fat and ugly. There were two men of the Security Police with him.  \"Come in,\" she invited.  They came in. She shut the door. Lazar looked down at the dead Harry Horn.  \"You said dead or alive,\" Lynn reminded Lazar. \"You owe me ten thousand credits.\"  \"What happened?\" Lazar snapped at her. His flesh-bedded eyes studied her.  \"He came to me for help. I had to bide my time. I told him I'd help him. I was waiting for the chance to get to you. He was by the interphone a few minutes ago. It was the chance I needed. I pulled my blaster, covered him. He made a dash for freedom so I had to kill him.\"  \"This is crazy,\" one of the men said. \"Horn must have had her confession. But now what do we do for evidence?\"  \"Shut up!\" Lazar snapped.  \"Your word is good, isn't it, Lazar?\" Lynn said.  \"What do you mean?\"  \"The ten thousand credits. As a loyal citizen I've earned them.\"  \"You'll get your credits,\" Lazar snarled, frustration in his eyes.  \"I know I will,\" Lynn said, smiling.

SCHMITZ  ILLUSTRATED BY SCHELLING   When he felt the sudden sharp tingling on his skin which came from the alarm device under his wrist watch, Dr. Halder Leorm turned unhurriedly from the culture tray he was studying, walked past the laboratory technician to the radiation room, entered it and closed the door behind him. He slipped the instrument from his wrist, removed its back plate, and held it up to his eye.  He was looking into the living room of his home, fifty miles away in another section of Orado's great city of Draise. A few steps from the entry, a man lay on his back on the carpeting, eyes shut, face deeply flushed, apparently unconscious. Halder Leorm's mouth tightened. The man on the carpet was Dr. Atteo, his new assistant, assigned to the laboratory earlier in the week. Beyond Atteo, the entry from the residence's delivery area and car port stood open.  Fingering the rim of the tiny scanner with practiced quickness, Halder Leorm shifted the view to other sections of the house, finally to the car port. An empty aircar stood in the port; there was no one in sight.  Halder sighed, replaced the instrument on his wrist, and glanced over at a wall mirror. His face was pale but looked sufficiently composed. Leaving the radiation room, he picked up his hat, said to the technician, \"Forgot to mention it, Reef, but I'll have to head over to central laboratories again.\"  [Illustration]  Reef, a large, red-headed young man, glanced around in mild surprise. \"They've got a nerve, calling you across town every two days!\" he observed. \"Whose problem are you supposed to solve now?\"  \"I wasn't informed. Apparently, something urgent has come up and they want my opinion on it.\"  \"Yeah, I bet!\" Reef scratched his head, glanced along the rows of culture trays. \"Well ... nothing here at the moment I can't handle, even if Atteo doesn't show up. Will you be back before evening?\"  \"I wouldn't count on it,\" Halder said. \"You know how those conferences tend to go.\"  \"Uh-huh. Well, Dr. Leorm, if I don't see you before tomorrow, give my love to your beautiful wife.\"  Halder smiled back at him from the door. \"Will do, Reef!\" He let the door slide shut behind him, started towards the exit level of the huge pharmaceutical plant. Reef had acted in a completely normal manner. If, as seemed very probable, \"Dr. Atteo\" was a Federation agent engaged in investigating Dr. Halder Leorm, Halder's co-workers evidently had not been apprised of the fact. Still, Halder thought, he must warn Kilby instantly. It was quite possible that an attempt to arrest him would be made before he left the building.  He stepped into the first ComWeb booth on his route, and dialed Kilby's business number. His wife had a desk job in one of the major fashion stores in the residential section of Draise, and--which was fortunate just now--a private office. Her face appeared almost immediately on the screen before him, a young face, soft-looking, with large, gray eyes. She smiled in pleased surprise. \"'Lo, Halder!\"  \"'Lo, Kilby.... Did you forget?\"  Kilby's smile became inquiring. \"Forget what?\"  \"That we're lunching together at Hasmin's today.\"  Halder paused, watching the color drain quickly from Kilby's cheeks.  \"Of course!\" she whispered. \"I did forget. Got tied up in ... and ... I'll leave right now! All right?\"  Halder smiled. She was past the first moment of shock and would be able to handle herself. After all, they had made very precise preparations against the day when they might discover that the Federation's suspicions had turned, however tentatively, in their direction.  \"That'll be fine,\" he said. \"I'm calling from the lab and will leave at once\"--he paused almost imperceptibly--\"if I'm not held up. Meet you at Hasmin's, in any case, in around twenty minutes.\"  Kilby's eyes flickered for an instant. If Halder didn't make it away, she was to carry out her own escape, as planned. That was the understanding. She gave him a tremulous smile. \"And I'm forgiven?\"  \"Of course.\" Halder smiled back.         *       *       *       *       *  The guards at the check-out point were not men he knew, but Halder walked through the ID-scanning band without incident, apparently without arousing interest. Beyond, to the left, was a wide one-way portal to a tube station. His aircar was in the executive parking area on the building's roof, but the escape plan called for both of them to abandon their private cars, which were more than likely to be traps, and use the public transportation systems in starting out.  Halder entered the tube station, went to a rented locker, opened it and took out two packages, one containing a complete change of clothing and a mirror, the other half a dozen canned cultures of as many varieties of microlife--highly specialized strains of life, of which the pharmaceutical concern that employed Dr. Halder Leorm knew no more than it did of the methods by which they had been developed.  Halder carried the packages into a ComWeb booth which he locked and shielded for privacy. Then he opened both packages and quickly removed his clothing. Opening the first of the cultures, he dipped one of the needles into it and, watching himself in the mirror, made a carefully measured injection in each side of his face. He laid the needle down and opened the next container, aware of the enzyme reaction that had begun to race through him.  Three minutes later, the mirror showed him a dark-skinned stranger with high cheek bones, heavy jaw, thick nose, slightly slanted eyes, graying hair. Halder disposed of the mirror, the clothes he had been wearing and the remaining contents of the second package. Unchecked, the alien organisms swarming in his blood stream now would have gone on to destroy him in a variety of unpleasant ways. But with their work of disguise completed, they were being checked.  He emerged presently from a tube exit in uptown Draise, on the terrace of a hotel forty stories above the street level. He didn't look about for Kilby, or rather the woman Kilby would turn into on her way here. The plan called for him to arrive first, to make sure he hadn't been traced, and then to see whether she was being followed.  She appeared five minutes later, a slightly stocky lady now, perhaps ten years under Halder's present apparent age, dark-skinned as he was, showing similar racial characteristics. She flashed her teeth at him as she came up, sloe eyes flirting.  \"Didn't keep you waiting, did I?\" she asked.  Halder growled amiably, \"What do you think? Let's grab a cab and get going.\" Nobody had come out of the tube exit behind her.  Kilby nodded understandingly; she had remembered not to look back. She was talking volubly about some imaginary adventure as they started down the terrace stairs towards a line of aircabs, playing her part, high-piled golden hairdo bobbing about. A greater contrast to the slender, quiet, gray-eyed girl, brown hair falling softly to her shoulders, with whom Halder had talked not more than twenty minutes ago would have been difficult to devise. The disguises might have been good enough, he thought, to permit them to remain undetected in Draise itself.  But the plan didn't call for that. There were too many things at stake.  Kilby slipped into the cab ahead of him without a break in her chatter.  Her voice stopped abruptly as Halder closed the cab door behind him, activating the vehicle's one-way vision shield. Kilby was leaning across the front seat beside the driver, turning off the comm box. She straightened, dropped down into the back seat beside Halder, biting her lip. The driver's head sagged sideways as if he had fallen asleep; then he slid slowly down on the seat and vanished from Halder's sight.  \"Got him instantly, eh?\" Halder asked, switching on the passenger controls.  \"Hm-m-m!\" Kilby opened her purse, slipped the little gun which had been in the palm of her left hand into it, reached out and gripped Halder's hand for an instant. \"You drive, Halder,\" she said. \"I'm so nervous I could scream! I'm scared cold! What happened?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Halder lifted the cab out from the terrace, swung it skywards. \"We were right in wondering about Dr. Atteo,\" he said. \"Half an hour ago, he attempted to go through our home in our absence. We'll have to assume he's a Federation agent. The entry trap knocked him out, but the fat's probably in the fire now. The Federation may not have been ready to make an arrest yet, but after this there'll be no hesitation. We'll have to move fast if we intend to keep ahead of Atteo's colleagues.\"  Kilby drew in an unsteady breath. \"You warned Rane and Santin?\"  Halder nodded. \"I sent the alert signal to their apartment ComWeb in the capital. Under the circumstances, I didn't think a person-to-person call would be advisable. They'll have time to pack and get out to the ranch before we arrive. We'll give them the details then.\"  \"Did you reset the trap switch at the house entry?\"  Halder slowed the cab, turning it into one of the cross-city traffic lines above Draise. \"No,\" he said. \"Knocking out a few more Federation agents wouldn't give us any advantage. It'll be eight or nine hours before Atteo will be able to talk; and, with any luck at all, we'll be clear of the planet by that time.\"  The dark woman who was Kilby and a controlled devil's swarm of microlife looked over at him and asked in Kilby's voice, \"Halder, do you think we should still go on trying to find the others now?\"  \"Of course. Why stop?\"  Kilby hesitated, said, \"It took you three months to find me. Four months later, we located Rane Rellis ... and Santin, at almost the same time. Since then we've drawn one blank after another. A year and a half gone, and a year and a half left.\"  She paused, and Halder said nothing, knowing she was fighting to"]]]
