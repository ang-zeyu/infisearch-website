What would spies be doing in the Mafia?\"  \"Learning Italian,\" Boyd said instantly.  \"Don't be silly,\" Malone said. \"If there were that many spies in this country, the Russians wouldn't have to fight at all. They could _vote_ the Communists into power--and by a nice big landslide, too.\"  \"Wait a minute,\" Boyd said. \"If there aren't so many spies, then how is all this getting done?\"  Malone beamed. \"That's the question,\" he said. \"And I think I have the answer.\"  \"You do?\" Boyd said. After a second he said: \"Oh, no.\"  \"Suppose you tell me,\" Malone said.  Boyd opened his mouth. Nothing emerged. He shut it. A second passed and he opened it again. \"Magic?\" he said weakly.  \"Not exactly,\" Malone said cheerfully. \"But you're getting warm.\"  Boyd shut his eyes. \"I'm not going to stand for it,\" he announced. \"I'm not going to take any more.\"  \"Any more what?\" Malone said. \"Tell me what you have in mind.\"  \"I won't even consider it,\" Boyd said. \"It haunts me. It gets into my dreams. Now, look, Ken: I can't even see a pitchfork any more without thinking of Greek letters.\"  Malone took a breath. \"Which Greek letter?\" he said.  \"You know very well,\" Boyd said. \"What a pitchfork looks like. _Psi_. And I'm not even going to think about it.\"  \"Well,\" Malone said equably, \"you won't have to. If you'd rather start with the Russian spy end of things, you can do that.\"  \"What I'd rather do,\" Boyd said, \"is resign.\"  \"Next year,\" Malone said instantly. \"For now, you can wait around until the dossiers come up--they're for the Senate Office Building technicians, and they're on the way. You can go over them, and start checking on any known Russian agents in the country for contacts. You can also start checking on the dossiers, and in general for any hanky-panky.\"  Boyd blinked. \"Hanky-panky?\" he said.  \"It's a perfectly good word,\" Malone said, offended. \"Or two words. Anyhow, you can start on that end, and not worry about anything else.\"  \"It's going to haunt me,\" Boyd said.  \"Well,\" Malone said, \"eat lots of ectoplasm and get enough sleep, and everything will be fine. After all, I'm going to have to do the real end of the work--the psionics end. I may be wrong, but--\"  He was interrupted by the phone. He flicked the switch and Andrew J. Burris' face appeared on the screen.  \"Malone,\" Burris said instantly, \"I just got a complaint from the State Department that ties in with your work. Their translator has been acting up.\"  Malone couldn't say anything for a minute.  \"Malone,\" Burris went on. \"I said--\"  \"I heard you,\" Malone said. \"And it doesn't have one.\"  \"It doesn't have one what?\" Burris said.  \"A pig-Latin circuit,\" Malone said. \"What else?\"  Burris' voice was very calm. \"Malone,\" he said, \"what does pig-Latin have to do with anything?\"  \"You said--\"  \"I said one of the State Department translators was acting up,\" Burris said. \"If you want details--\"  \"I don't think I can stand them,\" Malone said.  \"Some of the Russian and Chinese releases have come through with the meaning slightly altered,\" Burris went on doggedly. \"And I want you to check on it right away. I--\"  \"Thank God,\" Malone said.  Burris blinked. \"What?\"  \"Never mind,\" Malone said. \"Never mind. I'm glad you told me, Chief. I'll get to work on it right away, and--\"  \"You do that, Malone,\" Burris said. \"And stop calling me Chief! Do I look like an Indian? Do I have feathers in my hair?\"  \"Anything,\" Malone said grandly, \"is possible.\" He broke the connection in a hurry.   III  The summer sun beat down on the white city of Washington, D. C. as if it had mistaken its instructions slightly, and was convinced that the city had been put down somewhere in the Sahara. The sun seemed confused, Malone thought. If this were the Sahara, obviously there was no reason whatever for the Potomac to be running through it. The sun was doing its best to correct this small error, however, by exerting even more heat in a valiant attempt to dry up the river.  Its attempt was succeeding, at least partially. The Potomac was still there, but quite a lot of it was not in the river bed any more. Instead, it had gone into the air, which was so humid by now that Malone was willing to swear that it was splashing into his lungs at every inhalation. Resisting an impulse to try the breast-stroke, he stood in the full glare of the straining sun, just outside the Senate Office Building. He looked across at the Capitol, squinting his eyes manfully against the glare of its dome in the brightness.  The Capitol was, at any rate, some relief from the sight of Thomas Boyd and a group of agents busily grilling two technicians. That was going on in the Senate Office Building, and Malone had come over to watch the proceedings. Everything had been set up in what Malone considered the most complicated fashion possible. A big room had been turned into a projection chamber, and films were being run off over and over. The films, taken by hidden cameras watching the computer-secretaries, had caught two technicians red-handed punching errors into the machines. Boyd had leaped on this evidence, and he and his crew were showing the movies to the technicians and questioning them under bright lights in an effort to break down their resistance.  But it didn't look as though they were going to have any more success than the sun was having, turning Washington into the Sahara. After all, Malone told himself, wiping his streaming brow, there were no Pyramids in Washington. He tried to discover whether that made any sense, but it was too much work. He went back to thinking about Boyd.  The technicians were sticking to their original stories, that the mistakes had been honest ones. It sounded like a sensible idea to Malone; after all, people did make mistakes. And the FBI didn't have a single shred of evidence to prove that the technicians were engaged in deliberate sabotage. But Boyd wasn't giving up. Over and over he got the technicians to repeat their stories, looking for discrepancies or slips. Over and over he ran off the films of their mistakes, looking for some clue, some shred of evidence.  Even the sight of the Capitol, Malone told himself sadly, was better than any more of Boyd's massive investigation techniques.  He had come out to do some thinking. He believed, in spite of a good deal of evidence to the contrary, that his best ideas came to him while walking. At any rate, it was a way of getting away from four walls and from the prying eyes and anxious looks of superiors. He sighed gently, crammed his hat onto his head and started out.  Only a maniac, he reflected, would wear a hat on a day like the one he was swimming through. But the people who passed him as he trudged onward to no particular destination didn't seem to notice; they gave him a fairly wide berth, and seemed very polite, but that wasn't because they thought he was nuts, Malone knew. It was because they knew he was an FBI man.  That was the result of an FBI regulation. All agents had to wear hats. Malone wasn't sure why, and his thinking on the matter had only dredged up the idea that you had to have a hat in case somebody asked you to keep something under it. But the FBI was firm about its rulings. No matter what the weather, an agent wore a hat. Malone thought bitterly that he might just as well wear a red, white and blue luminous sign that said _FBI_ in great winking letters, and maybe a hooting siren, too. Still, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not supposed to be a secret organization--no matter what occasional critics might say. And the hats, at least as long as the weather remained broiling, were enough proof of that for anybody.  Malone could feel water collecting under his hat and soaking his head. He removed the hat quickly, wiped his head with a handkerchief and replaced the hat, feeling as if he had become incognito for a few seconds. The hat was back on now, feeling official but terrible, and about the same was true of the fully-loaded Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum revolver which hung in his shoulder holster. The harness chafed at his shoulder and chest and the weight of the gun itself was an added and unwelcome burden.  But even without the gun and the hat, Malone did not feel exactly chipper. His shirt and undershirt were no longer two garments, but one, welded together by seamless sweat and plastered heavily and not too skillfully to his skin. His trouser legs clung damply to calves and thighs, rubbing as he walked, and at the knees each trouser leg attached and detached itself with the unpleasant regularity of a wet bastinado. Inside Malone's shoes, his socks were completely awash, and he seemed to squish as he walked. It was hard to tell, but there seemed to be a small fish in his left shoe. It might, he told himself, be no more than a pebble or a wrinkle in his sock. But he was willing to swear that it was swimming upstream.  And the forecast, he told himself bitterly, was for continued warm.  He forced himself to take his mind off his own troubles and get back to the troubles of the FBI in general, such as the problem at hand. It was an effort, but he frowned and kept walking, and within a block he was concentrating again on the _psi_ powers.         *       *       *       *       *  _Psi_, he told himself, was behind the whole mess. In spite of Boyd's horrified refusal to believe such a thing, Malone was sure of it. Three years ago, of course, he wouldn't have considered the notion either. But since then a great many things had happened, and his horizons had widened. After all, capturing a double handful of totally insane, if perfectly genuine telepaths, from asylums all over the country, was enough by itself to widen quite a few stunned horizons. And then, later, there had been the gang of juvenile delinquents. They had been perfectly normal juvenile delinquents, stealing cars and bopping a stray policeman or two. It just happened, though, that they had solved the secret of instantaneous"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30434"],["title","Occasion for Disaster (#6)"],["body","leportation, too. This made them just a trifle unusual.  In capturing them, Malone, too, had learned the teleportation secret. Unlike Boyd, he thought, or Burris, the idea of psionic power didn't bother him much. After all, the psionic spectrum--if it was a spectrum at all--was just as much a natural phenomenon as gravity, or magnetism.  It was just a little hard for some people to get used to.  And, of course, he didn't fully understand _how_ it worked, or _why_. This put him in the position, he told himself, of an Australian aborigine. He tried to imagine an Australian aborigine in a hat on a hot day, decided the aborigine would have too much sense, and got back off the subject again.  However, he thought grimly, there was this Australian aborigine. And he had a magnifying glass, which he'd picked up from the wreck of some ship. Using that--assuming that experience, or a friendly missionary, taught him how--he could manage to light a fire, using the sun's thermonuclear processes to do the job. Malone doubted that the aborigine knew anything about thermonuclear processes, but he could start a fire with them.  As a matter of fact, he told himself, the aborigine didn't understand oxidation, either. But he could use that fire, when he got it going. In spite of his lack of knowledge, the aborigine could use that nice, hot, burning fire ...  Hurriedly, Malone pried his thoughts away from aborigines and heat, and tried to focus his mind elsewhere. He didn't understand psionic processes, he thought; but then, nobody did, really, as far as he knew. But he could use them.  And, obviously, somebody else could use them, too.  Only what kind of force was being used? What kind of psionic force would it take to make so many people in the United States goof up the way they were doing?  That, Malone told himself, was a good question, a basic and an important question. He was proud of himself for thinking of it.  Unfortunately, he didn't have the answer.  But he thought he knew a way of getting one.  It was perfectly true that nobody knew much about how psionics worked. For that matter, nobody knew very much about how gravity worked. But there was still some information--and, in the case of psionics, Malone knew where it was to be found.  It was to be found in Yucca Flats, Nevada.  It was, of course, true that Nevada would probably be even hotter than Washington, D. C. But there was no help for that, Malone told himself sadly; and, besides, the cold chill of the expert himself would probably cool things off quite rapidly. Malone thought of Dr. Thomas O'Connor, the Westinghouse psionics expert and frowned. O'Connor was not exactly what might be called a friendly man.  But he did know more about psionics than anyone else Malone could think of. And his help had been invaluable in solving the two previous psionic cases Malone had worked on.  For a second he thought of calling O'Connor, but he brushed that thought aside bravely. In spite of the heat of Yucca Flats, he would have to talk to the man personally. He thought again of O'Connor's congealed personality, and wondered if it would really be effective in combating the heat. If it were, he told himself, he would take the man right back to Washington with him, and plug him into the air-conditioning lines.  He sighed deeply, thought about a cigar and decided regretfully against it, here on the public street where he would be visible to anyone. Instead, he looked around him, discovered that he was only a block from a large, neon-lit drugstore and headed for it. Less than a minute later he was in a phone booth.         *       *       *       *       *  The operators throughout the country seemed to suffer from heat prostration, and Malone was hardly inclined to blame them. But, all the same, it took several minutes for him to get through to Dr. O'Connor's office, and a minute or so more before he could convince a security-addled secretary that, after all, he would hardly blow O'Connor to bits over the long-distance phone.  Finally the secretary, with a sigh of reluctance, said she would see if Dr. O'Connor were available. Malone waited in the phone booth, opening the door every few seconds to breathe. The booth was air-conditioned, but remained for some mystical reason an even ten degrees above the boiling point of Malone's temper.  Finally Dr. O'Connor's lean, pallid face appeared on the screen. He had not changed since Malone had last seen him. He still looked, and acted, like one of Malone's more disliked law professors.  \"Ah,\" the scientist said in a cold, precise voice. \"Mr. Malone. I am sorry for our precautions, but you understand that security must be served.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said.  \"Being an FBI man, of course you would,\" Dr. O'Connor went on, his face changing slightly and his voice warming almost to the boiling point of nitrogen. It was obvious that the phrase was Dr. O'Connor's idea of a little joke, and Malone smiled politely and nodded. The scientist seemed to feel some friendliness toward Malone, though it was hard to tell for sure. But Malone had brought him some fine specimens to work with--telepaths and teleports, though human, being no more than specimens to such a very precise scientific mind--and he seemed grateful for Malone's diligence and effort in finding such fascinating objects of study.  That Malone certainly hadn't started out to find them made, it appeared, very little difference.  \"Well, then,\" O'Connor said, returning to his normal, serious tone, \"what can I do for you, Mr. Malone?\"  \"If you have the time, doctor,\" Malone said respectfully, \"I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes.\" He had the absurd feeling that O'Connor was going to tell him to stop by after class, but the scientist only nodded.  \"Your call is timed very well,\" he said. \"As it happens, Mr. Malone, I do have a few seconds to spare just now.\"  \"Fine,\" Malone said.  \"I should be glad to talk with you,\" O'Connor said, without looking any more glad than ever.  \"I'll be right there,\" Malone said. O'Connor nodded again, and blanked out. Malone switched off and took a deep, superheated breath of phone booth air. For a second he considered starting his trip from outside the phone booth, but that was dangerous--if not to Malone, then to innocent spectators. Psionics was by no means a household word, and the sight of Malone leaving for Nevada might send several citizens straight to the wagon. Which was not a place, he thought judiciously, for anybody to be on such a hot day.  He closed his eyes for a fraction of a second. In that time he reconstructed from memory a detailed, three-dimensional, full-color image of Dr. O'Connor's office in his mind. It was perfect in detail; he checked it over mentally and then, by a special effort of will, he gave himself the psychic push that made the transition possible.  When he opened his eyes, he was in O'Connor's office, standing in front of the scientist's wide desk. He hoped nobody had been looking into the phone booth at the instant he had disappeared; but he was reasonably sure he'd been unobserved. People didn't go around peering into phone booths, after all, and he had seen no one.  O'Connor looked up without surprise. \"Ah,\" he said. \"Sit down, Mr. Malone.\" Malone looked around for the chair, which was an uncomfortably straight-backed affair, and sat down in it gingerly. Remembering past visits to O'Connor, he was grateful for even the small amount of relaxation the hard wood afforded him. O'Connor had only recently unbent to the point of supplying a spare chair in his office for visitors, and, apparently, especially for Malone. Perhaps, Malone thought, it was more gratitude for the lovely specimens.  Malone still felt uncomfortable, but tried bravely not to show it. He felt slightly guilty, too, as he always did when he popped into O'Connor's office without bothering to stay spacebound. By law, after all, he knew he should check in and out at the main gate of the huge, ultra-top-secret government reservation whenever he visited Yucca Flats. But that meant wasting a lot of time and going through a lot of trouble. Malone had rationalized it out for himself that way, and had got just far enough to do things the quick and easy way, and not quite far enough to feel undisturbed about it. After all, he told himself grimly, anything that saved time and trouble increased the efficiency of the FBI, so it was all to the good.  He swallowed hard. \"Dr. O'Connor--\" he began.  O'Connor looked up again. \"Yes?\" he said. He'd had plenty of practice in watching people appear and disappear, between Malone and the specimens Malone had brought him; he was beyond surprise or shock by now.  \"I came here to talk to you,\" Malone began again.  O'Connor nodded, a trifle impatiently. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I know that.\"  \"Well--\" Malone thought fast. Presenting the case to O'Connor was impossible; it was too complicated, and it might violate governmental secrecy somewhere along the line. He decided to wrap it up in a hypothetical situation. \"Doctor,\" he said, \"I know that all the various manifestations of the _psi_ powers were investigated and named long before responsible scientists became interested in the subject.\"  \"That,\" O'Connor said with some reluctance, \"is true.\" He looked sad, as if he wished they'd waited on naming some of the psionic manifestations until he'd been born and started investigating them. Malone tried to imagine a person doing something called O'Connorizing, and decided he was grateful for history.  \"Well, then--\" he said.  \"At least,\" O'Connor cut in, \"it is true in a rather vague and general way. You see, Mr. Malone, any precise description of a psionic manifestation must wait until a metalanguage has grown up to encompass it; that is, until understanding and knowledge have reached the point where careful and accurate description can take place.\"  \"Oh,\" Malone said helplessly. \"Sure.\" He wondered if what O'Connor had said meant anything, and decided "]]]
