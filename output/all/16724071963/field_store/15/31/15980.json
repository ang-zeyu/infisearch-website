This action together with the Keithian controversy, the disturbances over Blackwell, and the clamors of Church of England people that Penn was absent and neglecting his province, that the Quakers would make no military defense, and that the province might at any time fall into the hands of France, came to the ears of King William, who was already ill disposed toward Penn and distrusted him as a Jacobite. It seemed hardly advisable to allow a Jacobite to rule a British colony. Accordingly a royal order suspended Penn's governmental authority and placed the province under Benjamin Fletcher, Governor of New York. He undertook to rule in dictatorial fashion, threatening to annex the province to New York, and as a consequence the Assembly had plenty of trouble with him. But two years later, 1694, the province was returned to Penn, who now appointed as Governor William Markham, who had served as lieutenant-governor under Fletcher.  Markham proceeded to be high-handed with the Assembly and to administer the government in the imperialistic style of Fletcher. But the Assembly soon tamed him and in 1696 actually worried out of him a new constitution, which became known as Markham's Frame, proved much more popular than the one Penn had given, and allowed the Assembly much more power. Markham had no conceivable right to assent to it and Penn never agreed to it; but it was lived under for the next four years until Penn returned to the province. While it naturally had opponents, it was largely regarded as entirely valid, and apparently with the understanding that it was to last until Penn objected to it.  Penn had always been longing to return to Pennsylvania and live there for the rest of his life; but the terrible times of the Revolution of 1688 in England and its consequences had held him back. Those difficulties had now passed. Moreover, William III had established free government and religious liberty. No more Quakers were imprisoned and Penn's old occupation of securing their protection and release was gone.  In the autumn of 1699 he sailed for Pennsylvania with his family and, arriving after a tedious three months' voyage, was well received. His political scrapes and mistakes in England seemed to be buried in the past. He was soon at his old enjoyable life again, traveling actively about the country, preaching to the Quakers, and enlarging and beautifying his country seat, Pennsbury, on the Delaware, twenty miles above Philadelphia. As roads and trails were few and bad he usually traveled to and from the town in a barge which was rowed by six oarsmen and which seemed to give him great pride and pleasure.  Two happy years passed away in this manner, during which Penn seems to have settled, not however without difficulty, a great deal of business with his people, the Assembly, and the Indian tribes. Unfortunately he got word from England of a bill in Parliament for the revocation of colonial charters and for the establishment of royal governments in their place. He must needs return to England to fight it. Shortly before he sailed the Assembly presented him with a draft of a new constitution or frame of government which they had been discussing with him and preparing for some time. This he accepted, and it became the constitution under which Pennsylvania lived and prospered for seventy-five years, until the Revolution of 1776.  This new constitution was quite liberal. The most noticeable feature of it was the absence of any provision for the large elective council or upper house of legislation, which had been very unpopular. The Assembly thus became the one legislative body. There was incidental reference in the document to a governor's council, although there was no formal clause creating it. Penn and his heirs after his death always appointed a small council as an advisory body for the deputy governor. The Assembly was to be chosen annually by the freemen and to be composed of four representatives from each county. It could originate bills, control its own adjournments without interference from the Governor, choose its speaker and other officers, and judge of the qualifications and election of its own members. These were standard Anglo-Saxon popular parliamentary rights developed by long struggles in England and now established in Pennsylvania never to be relaxed. Finally a clause in the constitution permitted the Lower Counties, or Territories, under certain conditions to establish home rule. In 1705 the Territories took advantage of this concession and set up an assembly of their own.  Immediately after signing the constitution, in the last days of October, 1701, Penn sailed for England, expecting soon to return. But he became absorbed in affairs in England and never saw his colony again. This was unfortunate because Pennsylvania soon became a torment to him instead of a great pleasure as it always seems to have been when he lived in it. He was a happy present proprietor, but not a very happy absentee one.  The Church of England people in Pennsylvania entertained great hopes of this proposal to turn the proprietary colonies into royal provinces. Under such a change, while the Quakers might still have an influence in the Legislature, the Crown would probably give the executive offices to Churchmen. They therefore labored hard to discredit the Quakers. They kept harping on the absurdity of a set of fanatics attempting to govern a colony without a militia and without administering oaths of office or using oaths in judicial proceedings. How could any one's life be safe from foreign enemies without soldiers, and what safeguard was there for life, liberty, and property before judges, jurors, and witnesses, none of whom had been sworn? The Churchmen kept up their complaints for along time, but without effect in England. Penn was able to thwart all their plans. The bill to change the province into a royal one was never passed by Parliament. Penn returned to his court life, his preaching, and his theological writing, a rather curious combination and yet one by which he had always succeeded in protecting his people. He was a favorite with Queen Anne, who was now on the throne, and he led an expensive life which, with the cost of his deputy governor's salary in the colony, the slowness of his quitrent collections, and the dishonesty of the steward of his English estates, rapidly brought him into debt. To pay the government expense of a small colonial empire and at the same time to lead the life of a courtier and to travel as a preacher would have exhausted a stronger exchequer than Penn's.  The contests between the different deputy governors, whom Penn or his descendants sent out, and the Quaker Legislature fill the annals of the province for the next seventy years, down to the Revolution. These quarrels, when compared with the larger national political contests of history, seem petty enough and even tedious in detail. But, looked at in another aspect, they are important because they disclose how liberty, self-government, republicanism, and many of the constitutional principles by which Americans now live were gradually developed as the colonies grew towards independence. The keynote to all these early contests was what may be called the fundamental principle of colonial constitutional law or, at any rate, of constitutional practice, namely, that the Governor, whether royal or proprietary, must always be kept poor. His salary or income must never become a fixed or certain sum but must always be dependent on the annual favor and grants of a legislature controlled by the people. This belief was the foundation of American colonial liberty. The Assemblies, not only in Pennsylvania but in other colonies, would withhold the Governor's salary until he consented to their favorite laws. If he vetoed their laws, he received no salary. One of the causes of the Revolution in 1776 was the attempt of the mother country to make the governors and other colonial officials dependent for their salaries on the Government in England instead of on the legislatures in the colonies.  So the squabbles, as we of today are inclined to call them, went on in Pennsylvania--provincial and petty enough, but often very large and important so far as the principle which they involved was concerned. The Legislature of Pennsylvania in those days was a small body composed of only about twenty-five or thirty members, most of them sturdy, thrifty Quakers. They could meet very easily anywhere--at the Governor's house, if in conference with him, or at the treasurer's office or at the loan office, if investigating accounts. Beneath their broad brim hats and grave demeanor they were as Anglo-Saxon at heart as Robin Hood and his merry men, and in their ninety years of political control they built up as goodly a fabric of civil liberty as can be found in any community in the world.  The dignified, confident message from a deputy governor, full of lofty admonitions of their duty to the Crown, the province, and the proprietor, is often met by a sarcastic, stinging reply of the Assembly. David Lloyd, the Welsh leader of the anti-proprietary party, and Joseph Wilcox, another leader, became very skillful in drafting these profoundly respectful but deeply cutting replies. In after years, Benjamin Franklin attained even greater skill. In fact, it is not unlikely that he developed a large measure of his world famous aptness in the use of language in the process of drafting these replies. The composing of these official communications was important work, for a reply had to be telling and effective not only with the Governor but with the people who learned of its contents at the coffeehouse and spread the report of it among all classes. There was not a little good-fellowship in their contests; and Franklin, for instance, tells us how he used to abuse a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30434"],["title","Occasion for Disaster (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:    This etext was produced from Analog Science Fact & Fiction November 1960,   December 1960, January 1961, February 1961.

He threw his hands in the air and looked baffled and confused.  Kenneth J. Malone tried to appear sympathetic. \"What what is?\"  Burris frowned and drummed his fingers on his big desk. \"Malone,\" he said, \"make sense. And don't stutter.\"  \"Stutter?\" Malone said. \"You said you didn't know what it was. And I wanted to know what it was.\"  \"That's just it,\" Burris said. \"I don't know.\"  Malone sighed and repressed an impulse to scream. \"Now, wait a minute, Chief--\" he started.  Burris frowned again. \"Don't call me Chief,\" he said.  Malone nodded, \"O.K.,\" he said. \"But--if you don't know what it is, you must have some idea of what you don't know. I mean, is it larger than a breadbox? Does it perform helpful tasks? Is it self-employed?\"  \"Malone,\" Burris sighed, \"you ought to be on television.\"  \"But--\"  \"Let me explain,\" Burris said. His voice was calmer now, and he spoke as if he were enunciating nothing but the most obvious and eternal truths. \"The country,\" he said, \"is going to Hell in a handbasket.\"  Malone nodded again. \"Well, after all, Chief--\" he started.  \"Don't call me Chief,\" Burris said wearily.  \"Anything you say,\" Malone agreed peacefully. He eyed the Director of the FBI warily. \"After all, it isn't anything new,\" he went on. \"The country's always been going to Hell in a handbasket, one way or another. Look at Rome.\"  \"Rome?\" Burris said.  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Rome was always going to Hell in a handbasket, and finally it--\" He paused. \"Finally it did, I guess,\" he said.  \"Exactly,\" Burris said. \"And so are we. Finally.\" He passed a hand over his forehead and stared past Malone at a spot on the wall. Malone turned and looked at the spot, but saw nothing of interest. \"Malone,\" Burris said, and the FBI Agent whirled around again.  \"Yes, Ch--Yes?\" he said.  \"This time,\" Burris said, \"it isn't the same old story at all. This time it's different.\"  \"Different?\" Malone said.  Burris nodded. \"Look at it this way,\" he said. His eyes returned to the FBI Agent. \"Suppose you're a congressman,\" he went on, \"and you find evidence of inefficiency in the government.\"  \"All right,\" Malone said agreeably. He had the feeling that if he waited around a little while everything would make sense, and he was willing to wait. After all, he wasn't on assignment at the moment, and there was nothing pressing waiting for him. He was even between romances.  If he waited long enough, he told himself, Andrew J. Burris might say something worth hearing. He looked attentive and eager. He considered leaning over the desk a little, to look even more eager, but decided against it; Burris might think he looked threatening. There was no telling.  \"You're a congressman,\" Burris said, \"and the government is inefficient. You find evidence of it. What do you do?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Malone blinked and thought for a second. It didn't take any longer than that to come up with the old, old answer. \"I start an investigation,\" he said. \"I get a committee and I talk to a lot of newspaper editors and magazine editors and maybe I go on television and talk some more, and my committee has a lot of meetings--\"  \"Exactly,\" Burris said.  \"And we talk a lot at the meetings,\" Malone went on, carried away, \"and get a lot of publicity, and we subpoena famous people, just as famous as we can get, except governors or presidents, because you can't--they tried that back in the '50s, and it didn't work very well--and that gives us some more publicity, and then when we have all the publicity we can possibly get--\"  \"You stop,\" Burris said hurriedly.  \"That's right,\" Malone said. \"We stop. And that's what I'd do.\"  \"Of course, the problem of inefficiency is left exactly where it always was,\" Burris said. \"Nothing's been done about it.\"  \"Naturally,\" Malone said. \"But think of all the lovely publicity. And all the nice talk. And the subpoenas and committees and everything.\"  \"Sure,\" Burris said wearily. \"It's happened a thousand times. But, Malone, that's the difference. It isn't happening this time.\"  There was a short pause. \"What do you mean?\" Malone said at last.  \"This time,\" Burris said, in a tone that sounded almost awed, \"they want to keep it a secret.\"  \"A secret?\" Malone said, blinking. \"But that's ... that's not the American way.\"  Burris shrugged. \"It's un-congressman-like, anyhow,\" he said. \"But that's what they've done. Tiptoed over to me and whispered softly that the thing has to be investigated quietly. Naturally, they didn't give me any orders--but only because they know they can't make one stick. They suggested it pretty strongly.\"  \"Any reasons?\" Malone said. The whole idea interested him strangely. It was odd--and he found himself almost liking odd cases, lately. That is, he amended hurriedly, if they didn't get _too_ odd.  \"Oh, they had reasons, all right,\" Burris said. \"It took a little coaxing, but I managed to pry some loose. You see, every one of them found inefficiency in his own department. And every one knows that other men are investigating inefficiency.\"  \"Oh,\" Malone said.  \"That's right,\" Burris said. \"Every one of them came to me to get me to prove that the goof-ups in his particular department weren't his fault. That covers them in case one of the others happens to light into the department.\"  \"Well, it must be _somebody's_ fault,\" Malone said.  \"It isn't theirs,\" Burris said wearily. \"I ought to know. They told me. At great length, Malone.\"  Malone felt a stab of honest pity. \"How many so far?\" he said.  \"Six,\" Burris said. \"Four representatives, and two senators.\"  \"Only two?\" Malone said.  \"Well,\" Burris said, \"the Senate is so much smaller. And, besides, we may get more. As a matter of fact, Senator Lefferts is worth any six representatives all by himself.\"  \"He is?\" Malone said, puzzled. Senator Lefferts was not one of his favorite people. Nor, as far as he knew, did the somewhat excitable senator hold any place of honor in the heart of Andrew J. Burris.  \"I mean his story,\" Burris said. \"I've never heard anything like it--at least, not since the Bilbo days. And I've only heard about those,\" he added hurriedly.  \"What story?\" Malone said. \"He talked about inefficiency--\"  \"Not exactly,\" Burris said carefully. \"He said that somebody was out to get him--him, personally. He said somebody was trying to discredit him by sabotaging all his legislative plans.\"  \"Well,\" Malone said, feeling that some comment was called for, \"three cheers.\"  \"That isn't the point,\" Burris snapped. \"No matter how we felt about Senator Lefferts or his legislative plans, we're sworn to protect him. And he says 'they' are out to get him.\"  \"They?\" Malone said.  \"You know,\" Burris said, shrugging. \"The great 'they.' The invisible enemies all around, working against him.\"  \"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Paranoid?\" He had always thought Senator Lefferts was slightly on the batty side, and the idea of real paranoia didn't come as too much of a surprise. After all, when a man was batty to start out with ... and he even _looked_ like a vampire, Malone thought confusedly.  \"As far as paranoia is concerned,\" Burris said, \"I checked with one of our own psych men, and he'll back it up. Lefferts has definite paranoid tendencies, he says.\"  Malone said, \"That's that.\"  Burris shook his head. \"It isn't that simple,\" he said. \"You see, Malone, there's some evidence that somebody _is_ working against him.\"  \"The American public, with any luck at all,\" Malone said.  \"No,\" Burris said. \"An enemy. Somebody sabotaging his plans. Really.\"  Malone shook his head. \"You're crazy,\" he said.  Burris looked shocked. \"Malone, I'm the Director of the FBI,\" he said. \"And if you insist on being disrespectful--\"  \"Sorry,\" Malone murmured. \"But--\"  \"I am perfectly sane,\" Burris said slowly. \"It's Senator Lefferts who's crazy. The only trouble is, he has evidence to show he's not.\"  Malone thought about odd cases, and suddenly wished he were somewhere else. Anywhere else. This one showed sudden signs of developing into something positively bizarre. \"I see,\" he said, wondering if he did.  \"After all,\" Burris said, in a voice that attempted to sound reasonable, \"a paranoid has just as much right to be persecuted as anybody else, doesn't he?\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Everybody has rights. But what do you want me to do about that?\"  \"About their rights?\" Burris said. \"Nothing, Malone. Nothing.\"  \"I mean,\" Malone said patiently, \"about whatever it is that's going on.\"  Burris took a deep breath. His hands clasped behind his head, and he looked up at the ceiling. He seemed perfectly relaxed. That, Malone knew, was a bad sign. It meant that there was a dirty job coming, a job nobody wanted to do, and one Burris was determined to pass off on him. He sighed and tried to feel resigned.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well,\" the FBI"]]]
