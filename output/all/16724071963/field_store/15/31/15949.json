Said Saltbush, 'Here's our bird!'   But Rooster Hall, and his cronies two, drove home without a word.    The passing stranger within his gates that camps with old Rooster Hall   Must talk about something else than fowls, if he wishes to talk at all.   For the record lies in the local Court, and filed in its deepest vault,   That Peter Hall, of the Take 'Em Down, was tried for a fierce assault   On a stranger man, who, in all good faith, and prompted by what he heard,   Had asked old Hall if a British Game could beat an Australian bird;   And old McCrae, who was on the Bench, as soon as the case was tried,   Remarked, 'Discharged with a clean discharge -- the assault was justified!'     Hay and Hell and Booligal      'You come and see me, boys,' he said;   'You'll find a welcome and a bed    And whisky any time you call;   Although our township hasn't got   The name of quite a lively spot --    You see, I live in Booligal.    'And people have an awful down   Upon the district and the town --    Which worse than hell itself they call;   In fact, the saying far and wide   Along the Riverina side    Is \"Hay and Hell and Booligal\".    'No doubt it suits 'em very well   To say it's worse than Hay or Hell,    But don't you heed their talk at all;   Of course, there's heat -- no one denies --   And sand and dust and stacks of flies,    And rabbits, too, at Booligal.    'But such a pleasant, quiet place,   You never see a stranger's face --    They hardly ever care to call;   The drovers mostly pass it by;   They reckon that they'd rather die    Than spend a night in Booligal.    'The big mosquitoes frighten some --   You'll lie awake to hear 'em hum --    And snakes about the township crawl;   But shearers, when they get their cheque,   They never come along and wreck    The blessed town of Booligal.    'But down in Hay the shearers come   And fill themselves with fighting-rum,    And chase blue devils up the wall,   And fight the snaggers every day,   Until there is the deuce to pay --    There's none of that in Booligal.    'Of course, there isn't much to see --   The billiard-table used to be    The great attraction for us all,   Until some careless, drunken curs   Got sleeping on it in their spurs,    And ruined it, in Booligal.    'Just now there is a howling drought   That pretty near has starved us out --    It never seems to rain at all;   But, if there SHOULD come any rain,   You couldn't cross the black-soil plain --    You'd have to stop in Booligal.'         .    .    .    .    .    'WE'D HAVE TO STOP!'  With bated breath   We prayed that both in life and death    Our fate in other lines might fall:   'Oh, send us to our just reward   In Hay or Hell, but, gracious Lord,    Deliver us from Booligal!'     A Walgett Episode      The sun strikes down with a blinding glare,    The skies are blue and the plains are wide,   The saltbush plains that are burnt and bare    By Walgett out on the Barwon side --   The Barwon river that wanders down   In a leisurely manner by Walgett Town.    There came a stranger -- a 'Cockatoo' --    The word means farmer, as all men know   Who dwell in the land where the kangaroo    Barks loud at dawn, and the white-eyed crow   Uplifts his song on the stock-yard fence   As he watches the lambkins passing hence.    The sunburnt stranger was gaunt and brown,    But it soon appeared that he meant to flout   The iron law of the country town,    Which is -- that the stranger has got to shout:   'If he will not shout we must take him down,'   Remarked the yokels of Walgett Town.    They baited a trap with a crafty bait,    With a crafty bait, for they held discourse   Concerning a new chum who of late    Had bought such a thoroughly lazy horse;   They would wager that no one could ride him down   The length of the city of Walgett Town.    The stranger was born on a horse's hide;    So he took the wagers, and made them good   With his hard-earned cash -- but his hopes they died,    For the horse was a clothes-horse, made of wood! --   'Twas a well-known horse that had taken down   Full many a stranger in Walgett Town.    The stranger smiled with a sickly smile --    'Tis a sickly smile that the loser grins --   And he said he had travelled for quite a while    In trying to sell some marsupial skins.   'And I thought that perhaps, as you've took me down,   You would buy them from me, in Walgett Town!'    He said that his home was at Wingadee,    At Wingadee where he had for sale   Some fifty skins and would guarantee    They were full-sized skins, with the ears and tail   Complete, and he sold them for money down   To a venturesome buyer in Walgett Town.    Then he smiled a smile as he pouched the pelf,    'I'm glad that I'm quit of them, win or lose:   You can fetch them in when it suits yourself,    And you'll find the skins -- on the kangaroos!'   Then he left -- and the silence settled down   Like a tangible thing upon Walgett Town.     Father Riley's Horse      'Twas the horse thief, Andy Regan, that was hunted like a dog    By the troopers of the Upper Murray side,   They had searched in every gully -- they had looked in every log,    But never sight or track of him they spied,   Till the priest at Kiley's Crossing heard a knocking very late    And a whisper 'Father Riley -- come across!'   So his Rev'rence in pyjamas trotted softly to the gate    And admitted Andy Regan -- and a horse!    'Now, it's listen, Father Riley, to the words I've got to say,    For its close upon my death I am to-night.   With the troopers hard behind me I've been hiding all the day    In the gullies keeping close and out of sight.   But they're watching all the ranges till there's not a bird could fly,    And I'm fairly worn to pieces with the strife,   So I'm taking no more trouble, but I'm going home to die,    'Tis the only way I see to save my life.    'Yes, I'm making home to mother's, and I'll die o' Tuesday next    An' be buried on the Thursday -- and, of course,   I'm prepared to meet my penance, but with one thing I'm perplexed    And it's -- Father, it's this jewel of a horse!   He was never bought nor paid for, and there's not a man can swear    To his owner or his breeder, but I know,   That his sire was by Pedantic from the Old Pretender mare    And his dam was close related to The Roe.    'And there's nothing in the district that can race him for a step,    He could canter while they're going at their top:   He's the king of all the leppers that was ever seen to lep,    A five-foot fence -- he'd clear it in a hop!   So I'll leave him with you, Father, till the dead shall rise again,    'Tis yourself that knows a good 'un; and, of course,   You can say he's got by Moonlight out of Paddy Murphy's plain    If you're ever asked the breeding of the horse!    'But it's getting on to daylight and it's time to say good-bye,    For the stars above the East are growing pale.   And I'm making home to mother -- and it's hard for me to die!    But it's harder still, is keeping out of gaol!   You can ride the old horse over to my grave across the dip    Where the wattle bloom is waving overhead.   Sure he'll jump them fences easy -- you must never raise the whip    Or he'll rush 'em! -- now, good-bye!' and he had fled!    So they buried Andy Regan, and they buried him to rights,    In the graveyard at the back of Kiley's Hill;   There were five-and-twenty mourners who had five-and-twenty fights    Till the very boldest fighters had their fill.   There were fifty horses racing from the graveyard to the pub,    And their riders flogged each other all the while.   And the lashins of the liquor!  And the lavins of the grub!    Oh, poor Andy went to rest in proper style.    Then the races came to Kiley's -- with a steeplechase and all,    For the folk were mostly Irish round about,   And it takes an Irish rider to be fearless of a fall,    They were training morning in and morning out.   But they never started training till the sun was on the course    For a superstitious story kept 'em back,   That the ghost of Andy Regan on a slashing chestnut horse,    Had been training by the starlight on the track.    And they read the nominations for the races with surprise    And amusement at the Father's little joke,   For a novice had been entered for the steeplechasing prize,    And they found that it was Father Riley's moke!   He was neat enough to gallop, he was strong enough to stay!    But his owner's views of training were immense,   For the Reverend Father Riley used to ride him every day,    And he never saw a hurdle nor a fence.    And the priest would join the laughter; 'Oh,' said he, 'I put him in,    For there's five and twenty sovereigns to be won.   And the poor would find it useful, if the chestnut chanced to win,    And he'll maybe win when all is said and done!'   He had called him Faugh-a-ballagh, which is French for clear the course,    And his colours were a vivid shade of green:   All the Dooleys and O'Donnells were on Father Riley's horse,    While the Orangemen were backing Mandarin!    It was Hogan, the dog poisoner -- aged man and very wise,    Who was camping in the racecourse with his swag,   And who ventured the opinion, to the township's great surprise,    That the race would go to Father Riley's nag.   'You can talk about your riders -- and the horse has not been schooled,    And the fences is terrific, and the rest!   When the field is fairly going, then ye'll see ye've all been fooled,    And the chestnut horse will battle with the best.    'For there's some has got condition, and they think the race is sure,    And the chestnut horse will fall beneath the weight,   But the hopes of all the helpless, and the prayers of all the poor,    Will be running by his side to keep him straight.   And it's what's the need of schoolin' or of workin' on the track,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/304"],["title","Rio Grande's Last Race, and Other Verses (#4)"],["body"," the saints are there to guide him round the course!   I've prayed him over every fence -- I've prayed him out and back!    And I'll bet my cash on Father Riley's horse!'         .    .    .    .    .    Oh, the steeple was a caution!  They went tearin' round and round,    And the fences rang and rattled where they struck.   There was some that cleared the water -- there was more fell in and drowned,    Some blamed the men and others blamed the luck!   But the whips were flying freely when the field came into view,    For the finish down the long green stretch of course,   And in front of all the flyers -- jumpin' like a kangaroo,    Came the rank outsider -- Father Riley's horse!    Oh, the shouting and the cheering as he rattled past the post!    For he left the others standing, in the straight;   And the rider -- well they reckoned it was Andy Regan's ghost,    And it beat 'em how a ghost would draw the weight!   But he weighed it, nine stone seven, then he laughed and disappeared,    Like a Banshee (which is Spanish for an elf),   And old Hogan muttered sagely, 'If it wasn't for the beard    They'd be thinking it was Andy Regan's self!'    And the poor of Kiley's Crossing drank the health at Christmastide    Of the chestnut and his rider dressed in green.   There was never such a rider, not since Andy Regan died,    And they wondered who on earth he could have been.   But they settled it among 'em, for the story got about,    'Mongst the bushmen and the people on the course,   That the Devil had been ordered to let Andy Regan out    For the steeplechase on Father Riley's horse!     The Scotch Engineer      With eyes that searched in the dark,   Peering along the line,   Stood the grim Scotchman, Hector Clark,   Driver of 'Forty-nine',   And the veldt-fire flamed on the hills ahead,   Like a blood-red beacon sign.    There was word of a fight to the north,   And a column hard-pressed,   So they started the Highlanders forth,   Without food, without rest.    But the pipers gaily played,   Chanting their fierce delight,   And the armoured carriages rocked and swayed,   Laden with men of the Scotch Brigade,   Hurrying up to the fight,   And the grim, grey Highland engineer,   Driving them into the night.    Then a signal light glowed red,   And a picket came to the track.   'Enemy holding the line ahead,   Three of our mates we have left for dead,   Only we two got back.'   And far to the north through the still night air,   They heard the rifles crack.    And the boom of a gun rang out,   Like the sound of a deep appeal,   And the picket stood in doubt   By the side of the driving-wheel.    But the Engineer looked down,   With his hand on the starting-bar,   'Ride ye back to the town,   Ye know what my orders are,   Maybe they're wanting the Scotch Brigade   Up on those hills afar.    'I am no soldier at all,   Only an engineer,   But I could not bear that the folk should say,   Over in Scotland -- Glasgow way --   That Hector Clark stayed here   With the Scotch Brigade till the foe were gone,   With ever a rail to run her on.   Ready behind!  Stand clear!    'Fireman, get you gone   Into the armoured train,   I will drive her alone;   One more trip -- and perhaps the last --   With a well-raked fire and an open blast --   Hark to the rifles again.'         .    .    .    .    .    On through the choking dark,   Never a lamp nor a light,   Never an engine spark,   Showing her hurried flight.   Over the lonely plain   Rushed the great armoured train,   Hurrying up to the fight.    Then with her living freight   On to the foe she came,   And the rifles snapped their hate,   And the darkness spouted flame.    Over the roar of the fray   The hungry bullets whined,   As she dashed through the foe that lay   Loading and firing blind,   Till the glare of the furnace burning clear   Showed them the form of the engineer,   Sharply and well defined.    Through!  They were safely through!   Hark to the column's cheer!   Surely the driver knew   He was to halt her here;   But he took no heed of the signals red,   And the fireman found, when he climbed ahead,   There on the floor of his engine -- dead,   Lay the Scotch Engineer!     Song of the Future      'Tis strange that in a land so strong,   So strong and bold in mighty youth,   We have no poet's voice of truth   To sing for us a wondrous song.    Our chiefest singer yet has sung   In wild, sweet notes a passing strain,   All carelessly and sadly flung   To that dull world he thought so vain.    'I care for nothing, good nor bad,   My hopes are gone, my pleasures fled,   I am but sifting sand,' he said:   What wonder Gordon's songs were sad!    And yet, not always sad and hard;   In cheerful mood and light of heart   He told the tale of Britomarte,   And wrote the Rhyme of Joyous Guard.    And some have said that Nature's face   To us is always sad; but these   Have never felt the smiling grace   Of waving grass and forest trees   On sunlit plains as wide as seas.    'A land where dull Despair is king   O'er scentless flower and songless bird!'   But we have heard the bell-birds ring   Their silver bells at eventide,   Like fairies on the mountain side,   The sweetest note man ever heard.    The wild thrush lifts a note of mirth;   The bronzewing pigeons call and coo   Beside their nests the long day through;   The magpie warbles clear and strong   A joyous, glad, thanksgiving song,   For all God's mercies upon earth.    And many voices such as these   Are joyful sounds for those to tell,   Who know the Bush and love it well,   With all its hidden mysteries.    We cannot love the restless sea,   That rolls and tosses to and fro   Like some fierce creature in its glee;   For human weal or human woe   It has no touch of sympathy.    For us the bush is never sad:   Its myriad voices whisper low,   In tones the bushmen only know,   Its sympathy and welcome glad.    For us the roving breezes bring   From many a blossom-tufted tree --   Where wild bees murmur dreamily --   The honey-laden breath of Spring.         .    .    .    .    .    We have no tales of other days,   No bygone history to tell;   Our tales are told where camp-fires blaze   At midnight, when the solemn hush   Of that vast wonderland, the Bush,   Hath laid on every heart its spell.    Although we have no songs of strife,   Of bloodshed reddening the land,   We yet may find achievements grand   Within the bushman's quiet life.    Lift ye your faces to the sky   Ye far blue mountains of the West,   Who lie so peacefully at rest   Enshrouded in a haze of blue;   'Tis hard to feel that years went by   Before the pioneers broke through   Your rocky heights and walls of stone,   And made your secrets all their own.    For years the fertile Western plains   Were hid behind your sullen walls,   Your cliffs and crags and waterfalls   All weatherworn with tropic rains.    Between the mountains and the sea,   Like Israelites with staff in hand,   The people waited restlessly:   They looked towards the mountains old   And saw the sunsets come and go   With gorgeous golden afterglow,   That made the West a fairyland,   And marvelled what that West might be   Of which such wondrous tales were told.    For tales were told of inland seas   Like sullen oceans, salt and dead,   And sandy deserts, white and wan,   Where never trod the foot of man,   Nor bird went winging overhead,   Nor ever stirred a gracious breeze   To wake the silence with its breath --   A land of loneliness and death.    At length the hardy pioneers   By rock and crag found out the way,   And woke with voices of to-day,   A silence kept for years and years.    Upon the Western slope they stood   And saw -- a wide expanse of plain   As far as eye could stretch or see   Go rolling westward endlessly.   The native grasses, tall as grain,   Were waved and rippled in the breeze;   From boughs of blossom-laden trees   The parrots answered back again.   They saw the land that it was good,   A land of fatness all untrod,   And gave their silent thanks to God.    The way is won!  The way is won!   And straightway from the barren coast   There came a westward-marching host,   That aye and ever onward prest   With eager faces to the West,   Along the pathway of the sun.    The mountains saw them marching by:   They faced the all-consuming drought,   They would not rest in settled land:   But, taking each his life in hand,   Their faces ever westward bent   Beyond the farthest settlement,   Responding to the challenge cry   Of 'better country further out.'    And lo a miracle! the land   But yesterday was all unknown,   The wild man's boomerang was thrown   Where now great busy cities stand.   It was not much, you say, that these   Should win their way where none withstood;   In sooth there was not much of blood   No war was fought between the seas.    It was not much! but we who know   The strange capricious land they trod --   At times a stricken, parching sod,   At times with raging floods beset --   Through which they found their lonely way,   Are quite content that you should say   It was not much, while we can feel   That nothing in the ages old,   In song or story written yet   On Grecian urn or Roman arch,   Though it should ring with clash of steel,   Could braver histories unfold   Than this bush story, yet untold --   The story of their westward march.         .    .    .    .    .    But times are changed, and changes rung   From old to new -- the olden days,   The old bush life and all its ways   Are passing from us all unsung.   The freedom, and the hopeful sense   Of toil that brought due recompense,   Of room for all, has passed away,   And lies forgotten with the dead.   Within our streets men cry for bread   In cities built but yesterday.    About us stretches wealth of land,   A boundless wealth of virgin soil   As yet unfruitful and untilled!   Our willing workmen, strong and skilled   Within our cities idle stand,   And cry aloud for leave "]]]
