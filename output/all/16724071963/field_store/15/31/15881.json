LANGART         _Given psi powers like clairvoyance and telepathy, solving      problems of sabotage would be easy, of course. That is, it      seems that way at first thought!_                         Illustrated by van Dongen         *       *       *       *       *     The man in the pastel blue topcoat walked with steady purpose, but without haste, through the chill, wind-swirled drizzle that filled the air above the streets of Arlington, Virginia. His matching blue cap-hood was pulled low over his forehead, and the clear, infrared radiating face mask had been flipped down to protect his chubby cheeks and round nose from the icy wind.  No one noticed him particularly. He was just another average man who blended in with all the others who walked the streets that day. No one recognized him; his face did not appear often in public places, except in his own state, and, even so, it was a thoroughly ordinary face. But, as he walked, Senator John Peter Gonzales was keeping a mental, fine-webbed, four-dimensional net around him, feeling for the slightest touch of recognition. He wanted no one to connect him in any way with his intended destination.  It was not his first visit to the six-floor brick building that stood on a street in a lower-middle-class district of Arlington. Actually, government business took him there more often than would have been safe for the average man-on-the-street. For Senator Gonzales, the process of remaining incognito was so elementary that it was almost subconscious.  Arriving at his destination, he paused on the sidewalk to light a cigarette, shielding it against the wind and drizzle with cupped hands while his mind made one last check on the surroundings. Then he strode quickly up the five steps to the double doors which were marked: _The Society For Mystical And Metaphysical Research, Inc._  Just as he stepped in, he flipped the face shield up and put on an old-fashioned pair of thick-lensed, black-rimmed spectacles. Then, his face assuming a bland smile that would have been completely out of place on Senator Gonzales, he went from the foyer into the front office.  \"Good afternoon, Mrs. Jesser,\" he said, in a high, smooth, slightly accented voice that was not his own. \"I perceive by your aura that you are feeling well. Your normal aura-color is tinged with a positive golden hue.\"  Mrs. Jesser, a well-rounded matron in her early forties, rose to the bait like a porpoise being hand-fed at a Florida zoo. \"_Dear_ Swami Chandra! How perfectly wonderful to see you again! You're looking _very_ well your-_self_.\"  The Swami, whose Indian blood was of the Aztec rather than the Brahmin variety, nonetheless managed to radiate all the mystery of the East. \"My well-being, dear Mrs. Jesser, is due to the fact that I have been communing for the past three months with my very good friend, the Fifth Dalai Lama. A most refreshingly wise person.\" Senator Gonzales was fond of the Society's crackpot receptionist, and he knew exactly what kind of hokum would please her most.  \"Oh, I _do_ hope you will find time to tell me _all_ about it,\" she said effusively. \"Mr. Balfour isn't in the city just now,\" she went on. \"He's lecturing in New York on the history of flying saucer sightings. Do you realize that this is the fortieth anniversary of the first saucer sighting, back in 1944?\"  \"The first _photographed_ sighting,\" the Swami corrected condescendingly. \"Our friends have been watching and guiding us for far longer than that, and were sighted many times before they were photographed.\"  Mrs. Jesser nodded briskly. \"Of course. You're right, as always, Swami.\"  \"I am sorry to hear,\" the Swami continued smoothly, \"that I will not be able to see Mr. Balfour. However, I came at the call of Mr. Brian Taggert, who is expecting me.\"  Mrs. Jesser glanced down at her appointment sheet. \"He didn't mention an appointment to me. However--\" She punched a button on the intercom. \"Mr. Taggert? Swami Chandra is here to see you. He says he has an appointment.\"  Brian Taggert's deep voice came over the instrument. \"The Swami, as usual, is very astute. I have been thinking about calling him. Send him right up.\"  \"You may go up, Swami,\" said Mrs. Jesser, wide-eyed. She watched in awe as the Swami marched regally through the inner door and began to climb the stairs toward the sixth floor.         *       *       *       *       *  One way to hide an ex-officio agency of the United States Government was to label it truthfully--_The Society For Mystical And Metaphysical Research_. In spite of the fact that the label was literally true, it sounded so crackpot that no one but a crackpot would bother to look into it. As a consequence, better than ninety per cent of the membership of the Society was composed of just such people. Only a few members of the \"core\" knew the organization's true function and purpose. And as long as such scatter-brains as Mrs. Jesser and Mr. Balfour were in there pitching, no one would ever penetrate to the actual core of the Society.  The senator had already pocketed the exaggerated glasses by the time he reached the sixth floor, and his face had lost its bland, overly-wise smile. He pushed open the door to Taggert's office.  \"Have you got any ideas yet?\" he asked quickly.  Brian Taggert, a heavily-muscled man with dark eyes and black, slightly wavy hair, sat on the edge of a couch in one corner of the room. His desk across the room was there for paperwork only, and Taggert had precious little of that to bother with.  He took a puff from his heavy-bowled briar. \"We're going to have to send an agent in there. Someone who can be on the spot. Someone who can get the feel of the situation first hand.\"  \"That'll be difficult. We can't just suddenly stick an unknown in there and have an excuse for his being there. Couldn't Donahue or Reeves--\"  Taggert shook his head. \"Impossible, John. Extrasensory perception can't replace sight, any more than sight can replace hearing. You know that.\"  \"Certainly. But I thought we could get enough information that way to tell us who our saboteur is. No dice, eh?\"  \"No dice,\" said Taggert. \"Look at the situation we've got there. The purpose of the Redford Research Team is to test the Meson Ultimate Decay Theory of Dr. Theodore Nordred. Now, if we--\"  Senator Gonzales, walking across the room toward Taggert, gestured with one hand. \"I know! I know! Give me _some_ credit for intelligence! But we _do_ have one suspect, don't we? What about _him_?\"  Taggert chuckled through a wreath of smoke. \"Calm down, John. Or are you trying to give me your impression of Mrs. Jesser in a conversation with a saucerite?\"  The senator laughed and sat down in a nearby chair. \"All right. Sorry. But this whole thing is lousing up our entire space program. First off, we nearly lose Dr. Ch'ien, and, with him gone, the interstellar drive project would've been shot. Now, if this sabotage keeps up, the Redford project _will_ be shot, and that means we might have to stick to the old-fashioned rocket to get off-planet. Brian, we _need_ antigravity, and, so far, Nordred's theory is our only clue.\"  \"Agreed,\" said Taggert.  \"Well, we're never going to get it if equipment keeps mysteriously burning itself out, breaking down, and just generally goofing up. This morning, the primary exciter on the new ultracosmotron went haywire, and the beam of sodium nuclei burned through part of the accelerator tube wall. It'll take a month to get it back in working order.\"  Taggert took his pipe out of his mouth and tapped the dottle into a nearby ash disposal unit. \"And you want to pick up our pet spy?\"  Senator Gonzales scowled. \"Well, I'd certainly call him our prime suspect.\" But there was a certain lack of conviction in his manner.  Brian Taggert didn't flatly contradict the senator. \"Maybe. But you know, John, there's one thing that bothers me about these accidents.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"The fact that we have not one shred of evidence that points to sabotage.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In a room on the fifth floor, directly below Brian Taggert's office, a young man was half sitting, half reclining in a thickly upholstered adjustable chair. He had dropped the back of the chair to a forty-five degree angle and lifted up the footrest; now he was leaning back in lazy comfort, his ankles crossed, his right hand holding a slowly smoldering cigarette, his eyes contemplating the ceiling. Or, rather, they seemed to be contemplating something _beyond_ the ceiling.  It was pure coincidence that the focus of his thoughts happened to be located in about the same volume of space that his eyes seemed to be focused on. If Brian Taggert and Senator Gonzales had been in the room below, his eyes would still be looking at the ceiling.  In repose, his face looked even younger than his twenty-eight years would have led one to expect. His close-cropped brown hair added to the impression of youth, and the well-tailored suit on his slim, muscular body added to the effect. At any top-flight university, he could have passes for a well-bred, sophisticated, intelligent student who had money enough to indulge himself and sense enough not to overdo it.  He was beginning to understand the pattern that was being woven in the room above--beginning to feel it in depth.  Senator Gonzalez was mildly telepathic, inasmuch as he could pick up thoughts in the prevocal stage--the stage at which thought becomes definitely organized into words, phrases, and sentences. He could go a little deeper, into the selectivity stage, where the linking processes of logic took over from the nonlogical but rational processes of the preconscious--but only if he knew the person"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30304"],["title","Psichopath (#1)"],["body","ell. Where the senator excelled was in detecting emotional tone and manipulating emotional processes, both within himself and within others.  Brian Taggert was an analyzer, an originator, a motivator--and more. The young man found himself avoiding too deep a probe into the mind of Brian Taggert; he knew that he had not yet achieved the maturity to understand the multilayered depths of a mind like that. Eventually, perhaps....  Not that Senator Gonzales was a child, nor that he was emotionally or intellectually shallow. It was merely that he was not of Taggert's caliber.  The young man absently took another drag from his cigarette. Taggert had explained the basic problem to him, but he was getting a wider picture from the additional information that Senator Gonzales had brought.  Dr. Theodore Nordred, a mathematical physicist and one of the top-flight, high-powered, original minds in the field, had shown that Einstein's final equations only held in a universe composed entirely of normal matter. Since the great Einstein had died before the Principle of Parity had been overthrown in the mid-fifties, he had been unable to incorporate the information into his Unified Field Theory. Nordred had been able to show, mathematically, that Einstein's equations were valid only for a completely \"dexter,\" or right-handed universe, or for a completely \"sinister\" or left-handed universe.  Although the universe in which Man lived was predominantly dexter--arbitrarily so designated--it was not completely so. It had a \"sinister\" component amounting to approximately one one-hundred-thousandth of one per cent. On the average, one atom out of every ten million in the universe was an atom of antimatter. The distribution was unequal of course; antimatter could not exist in contact with ordinary matter. Most of it was distributed throughout interstellar space in the form of individual atoms, freely floating in space, a long way from any large mass of normal matter.  But that minute fraction of a per cent was enough to show that the known universe was not totally Einsteinian. In a purely Einsteinian universe, antigravity was impossible, but if the equations of Dr. Theodore Nordred were actually a closer approximation to true reality than those of Einstein, then antigravity _might_ be a practical reality.  And that was the problem the Redford Research Team was working on. It was a parallel project to the interstellar drive problem, being carried on elsewhere.         *       *       *       *       *  The \"pet spy,\" as Taggert had called him, was Dr. Konrad Bern, a middle-aged Negro from Tanganyika, who was convinced that only under Communism could the colored races of the world achieve the technological organization and living standard of the white man. He had been trained as a \"sleeper\"; not even the exhaustive investigations of the FBI had turned up any relationship between Bern and the Soviets. It had taken the telepathic probing of the S.M.M.R. agents to uncover his real purposes. Known, he constituted no danger.  There was no denying that he was a highly competent, if not brilliant, physicist. And, since it was quite impossible for him to get any information on the Redford Project into the hands of the opposition--it was no longer fashionable to call Communists \"the enemy\"--there was no reason why he shouldn't be allowed to contribute to the American efforts to bridge space.  Three times in the five months since Bern had joined the project, agents of the Soviet government had made attempts to contact the physicist. Three times the FBI, warned by S.M.M.R. agents, had quietly blocked the contact. Konrad Bern had been effectively isolated.  But, at the project site itself, equipment failure had become increasingly more frequent, all out of proportion to the normal accident rate in any well-regulated laboratory. The work of the project had practically come to a standstill; the ultra-secret project reports to the President were beginning to show less and less progress in the basic research, and more and more progress in repairing damaged equipment. Apparently, though, increasing efficiency in repair work was self-neutralizing; repairing an instrument in half the time merely meant that it could break down twice as often.  It had to be sabotage. And yet, not even the S.M.M.R. agents could find any trace of intentional damage nor any thought patterns that would indicate deliberate damage.  And Senator John Peter Gonzales quite evidently did _not_ want to face the implications of _that_ particular fact.  \"We're going to have to send an agent in,\" Taggert repeated.  (_That's my cue_, thought the young man on the fifth floor as he crushed out his cigarette and got up from the chair.)  \"I don't know how we're going to manage it,\" said the senator. \"What excuse do we have for putting a new man on the Redford team?\"  Brian Taggert grinned. \"What they need is an expert repair technician--a man who knows how to build and repair complex research instruments. He doesn't have to know anything about the purpose of the team itself, all he has to do is keep the equipment in good shape.\"  Senator Gonzalez let a slow smile spread over his face. \"You've been gulling me, you snake. All right; I deserved it. Tell him to come in.\"  As the door opened, Taggert said: \"Senator Gonzales, may I present Mr. David MacHeath? He's our man, I think.\"         *       *       *       *       *  David MacHeath watched a blue line wriggle its way erratically across the face of an oscilloscope. \"The wave form is way off,\" he said flatly, \"and the frequency is slithering all over the place.\"  He squinted at the line for a moment then spoke to the man standing nearby. \"Signal Harry to back her off two degrees, then run her up slowly, ten minutes at a time.\"  The other man flickered the key on the side of the small carbide-Welsbach lamp. The shutters blinked, sending pulses of light down the length of the ten-foot diameter glass-walled tube in which the men were working. Far down the tube, MacHeath could see the answering flicker from Harry, a mile and a half away in the darkness.  MacHeath watched the screen again. After a few seconds, he said: \"O.K.! Hold it!\"  Again the lamp flashed.  \"Well, it isn't perfect,\" MacHeath said, \"but it's all we can do from here. We'll have to evacuate the tube to get her in perfect balance. Tell Harry to knock off for the day.\"  While the welcome message was being flashed, MacHeath shut off the testing instruments and disconnected them. It was possible to compensate a little for the testing equipment, but a telephone, or even an electric flashlight, would simply add to the burden.  Bill Griffin shoved down the key on the lamp he was holding and locked it into place. The shutters remained open, and the lamp shed a beam of white light along the shining walls of the cylindrical tube. \"How much longer do you figure it'll take, Dave?\" he asked.  \"Another shift, at least,\" said MacHeath, picking up the compact, shielded instrument case. \"You want to carry that mat?\"  [Illustration]  Griffin picked up the thick sponge-rubber mat that the instrument case had been sitting on, and the two men started off down the tube, walking silently on the sponge-rubber-soled shoes which would not scratch the glass underfoot.  \"Any indication yet as to who our saboteur is?\" Griffin asked.  \"I'm not sure,\" MacHeath admitted. \"I've picked up a couple of leads, but I don't know if they mean anything or not.\"  \"I wonder if there _is_ a saboteur,\" Griffin said musingly. \"Maybe it's just a run of bad luck. It could happen, you know. A statistical run of--\"  \"You don't believe that, any more than I do,\" MacHeath said.  \"No. But I find it even harder to believe that a materialistic philosophy like Communism could evolve any workable psionic discipline.\"  \"So do I,\" agreed MacHeath.  \"But it can't be physical sabotage,\" Griffin argued. \"There's not a trace of it--anywhere. It _has_ to be psionic.\"  \"Right,\" said MacHeath, grinning as he saw what was coming next.  \"But we've already eliminated that. So?\" Griffin nodded firmly as if in full agreement with himself. \"So we follow the dictum of the Master: 'Eliminate the impossible; whatever is left, no matter how improbable, is the truth.' And, since there is absolutely nothing left, there is no truth. At the bottom, the whole thing is merely a matter of mental delusion.\"  \"Sherlock Holmes would be proud of you, Bill,\" MacHeath said. \"And so am I.\"  Griffin looked at MacHeath oddly. \"I wish I was a halfway decent telepath, I'd like to know what's going on in your preconscious.\"  \"You'd have to dig deeper than that, I'm afraid,\" MacHeath said ruefully. \"As soon as my subconscious has solved the problem, I'll let you know.\"  \"I've changed my mind,\" said Griffin cheerfully. \"I don't envy your telepathy. I don't envy a guy who has to TP his own subconscious to find out what he's thinking.\"  MacHeath chuckled softly as he turned the bolt that opened the door in the \"gun\" end of the stripped-nuclei accelerator. The seals broke with a soft hiss. Evidently, the barometric pressure outside the two-mile-long underground tube had changed slightly during the time they had been down there.  \"It'll be a week before we can test it,\" MacHeath said in a tired voice. \"Even after we get it partly in balance. It'll take that long to evacuate the tube and sweep it clean.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was the first sentence he had spoken in the past hour or so, and it was purely for the edification of the man who was standing on the other side of the air lock, although neither Griffin nor MacHeath had actually seen him as yet.  Griffin was not a telepath in the sense that the S.M.M.R. used the word, but to a non-psionicist, he would have appeared to be one. Membership in the \"core\" group of the _Society for Mystical and Metaphysical Research_ required, above all, _understanding_. And, with that understanding, a conversation between"]]]
