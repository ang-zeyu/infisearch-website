Ninety-two years ago, a Federation survey ship disappeared in that sector of the galaxy. Aboard it was a man named Ohl Cantrall, an outstanding scientist of the period. We know now that this ship was captured by the Great Satogs, and that Cantrall, his staff, and his crew, were subjected to extensive experimentation by them, and eventually were killed.  \"The experimentation had been designed to provide Kalechi's master-biologists with models towards which to work. They proposed to utilize the high mutability of their species to develop a Satog type that would be the exact physical counterpart of a human being and could live undetected on our worlds for the several years required to prepare for the attack. They were amazingly successful. Each group of cells in the long series which began moving towards an approximation of the human pattern was developed only far enough to initiate the greatest favorable shift possible at that point in its genetic structure. Cell generations may have followed each other within hours in this manner, for over six decades.  \"The goal of the experiment, the last generation issued in Kalechi's laboratories, were Satog copies of embryonic human beings. This stage was comprised of approximately twelve hundred individuals who were now permitted to mature and were schooled individually in complete isolation by Satog teachers. They were indoctrinated with their purpose in life ... the destruction of our populations ... and trained fully in the manner of accomplishing it.  \"Eventually, each was shipped to a Federation world. Cover identities as obscure Federation citizens with backgrounds and records had been prepared. The final instructions given these agents were simple. They were to do nothing to draw attention to themselves, make no attempt to contact one another. They were to create their stocks of lethal organisms, provide methods of distribution and, on a selected day, three Federation years away, release the floods of death.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The voice paused briefly, went on. \"It is a sobering reflection that this plan--an attack by a comparatively minor race with one specialized skill on the greatest human civilization in history--might very well have been appallingly successful. But the Great Satogs failed, in part because of the very perfection of their work.  \"From the human beings on board Ohl Cantrall's captured survey ship the Satog scientists selected Cantrall himself and two female technicians on his staff as the models to be followed in developing Kalechi's pseudohumanity. In the twelve hundred members of the group sent to the Federation ninety years later, these three identity-patterns are recognizable. They appear in varying degrees of combination, but an occasional individual will show only one or the other of the three patterns involved.  \"Ohl Cantrall was regarded as a great man in his time, and his identification pattern is on record. That was the detail which first revealed the plot. When three duplicates of that particular pattern--and a considerable number of approximate duplicates--turned up simultaneously in identification banks at widely separated points in the Federation, it aroused more than scientific curiosity. Our security system has learned to look with suspicion on apparent miracles. The unsuspecting 'Cantralls' were located and apprehended at once; the threat to the Federation was disclosed; and an intensive though unpublicized search for the scattered group of Kalechi agents began immediately....\"  The voice paused again.  The Satog image above the pit vanished. A clear light sprang up in the big room. Simultaneously, Halder felt the nightmare immobility draining from him and the sensation of dreamlike unreality fade from his mind. He turned to the right, found Kilby's eyes already on him, saw the Rellis couple sitting beyond her ... Rane, no longer disguised, looking like a mirror image of Halder.  They were still fastened to their chairs. Halder's gaze shifted back quickly to the center of the room. Where the pit had been, the flooring was now level, carrying a massive, polished table. Behind the table sat a heavily built, white-haired man with a strong face, harsh mouth, in the formal black and gold robes of a Councilman of the Federation.  \"I am Councilman Mavig.\" The voice was the one that had spoken in the dark; it came now from the man at the table. \"I am in charge of the operation against the Kalechi agents, and it is my duty to inform them, after their arrest and examination, of the disposition that must be made of them.\"  He hesitated, twisting his mouth thoughtfully, almost as if unwilling to continue. \"You four have been thoroughly examined,\" he stated at last. \"Most of the work has been done while you were still unconscious. A final check of your emotional reactions was being made throughout the stress situation just ended, in which you listened to a replay of a report on the Kalechi matter. That part is now concluded.\"  Mavig paused, scowled, cleared his throat. \"I find,\" he went on, \"that some aspects of this affair still strain my credulity! More than half of your group have been captured by now; the remainder are at large but under observation. The danger is past. The activities of the Great Satogs of Kalechi will receive our very close scrutiny for generations to come. They shall be given no opportunity to repeat such a trick; nor--after they have been made aware of the measures we are preparing against them--will they feel the slightest inclination to try it.  \"Now, as to yourselves. After we had tracked down the first dozen or so of you, a startling pattern began to emerge. You were not following Kalechi's careful instructions. In one way and another--in often very ingenious ways--you were attempting primarily to establish contact with one another. When captured and examined while unconscious by the various interrogation instruments of our psychologists you told us your reasons for doing this.\"  Councilman Mavig shook his head. \"The interrogation machines are supposed to be infallible,\" he remarked. \"Possibly they are. But I am not a psychologist, and for a long time I refused to accept the reports they returned. But still ...\"  He sighed. \"Well, as to what is to happen with you. You will be sent to join the previously arrested members of your group, and will remain with them until the last of you is in our hands, has been examined, and ...\"  Mavig paused again.  \"You see, we can accuse you of no crime!\" he said irritably. \"As individuals and as a group, your intention from the beginning has been to prevent the crime against the Federation from being committed. The Great Satogs simply did too good a job. You have been given the most searching physical examinations possible. They show uniformly that your genetic pattern is stable, and that in no detail can it be distinguished from a wholly human one of high order.  \"You appreciate, I imagine, where that leaves the Federation! When imitation is carried to the point of identity ...\" Federation Councilman Mavig shook his head once more, concluded, \"It is utterly absurd, in direct contradiction to everything we have understood to date! You've regarded yourselves as human beings, and believed that your place was among us. And we can only agree.\"     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Analog Science Fact & Fiction_ July     1962.

I am sitting on the edge of what passes for a bed. It is made of loosely woven strips of steel, and there is no mattress, only an extra blanket of thin olive-drab. It isn't comfortable; but of course they expect to make me still more uncomfortable.  They expect to take me out of this precinct jail to the District prison and eventually to the death house.  Sure, there will be a trial first, but that is only a formality. Not only did they catch me with the smoking gun in my hand and Connaught bubbling to death through the hole in his throat, but I admitted it.  I--knowing what I was doing, with, as they say, malice aforethought--deliberately shot to death Laurence Connaught.  They execute murderers. So they mean to execute me.  Especially because Laurence Connaught had saved my life.  Well, there are extenuating circumstances. I do not think they would convince a jury.  Connaught and I were close friends for years. We lost touch during the war. We met again in Washington, a few years after the war was over. We had, to some extent, grown apart; he had become a man with a mission. He was working very hard on something and he did not choose to discuss his work and there was nothing else in his life on which to form a basis for communication. And--well, I had my own life, too. It wasn't scientific research in my case--I flunked out of med school, while he went on. I'm not ashamed of it; it is nothing to be ashamed of. I simply was not able to cope with the messy business of carving corpses. I didn't like it, I didn't want to do it, and when I was forced to do it, I did it badly. So--I left.  Thus I have no string of degrees, but you don't need them in order to be a Senate guard.         *       *       *       *       *  Does that sound like a terribly impressive career to you? Of course not; but I liked it. The Senators are relaxed and friendly when the guards are around, and you learn wonderful things about what goes on behind the scenes of government. And a Senate guard is in a position to do favors--for newspapermen, who find a lead to a story useful; for government officials, who sometimes base a whole campaign on one careless, repeated remark; and for just about anyone who would like to be in the visitors' gallery during a hot debate.  Larry Connaught, for instance. I ran into him on the street one day, and we chatted for a moment, and he asked if it was possible to get him in to see the upcoming foreign relations debate. It was; I called him the next day and told him I had arranged for a pass. And he was there, watching eagerly with his moist little eyes, when the Secretary got up to speak and there was that sudden unexpected yell, and the handful of Central American fanatics dragged out their weapons and began trying to change American policy with gunpowder.  You remember the story, I suppose. There were only three of them, two with guns, one with a hand grenade. The pistol men managed to wound two Senators and a guard. I was right there, talking to Connaught. I spotted the little fellow with the hand grenade and tackled him. I knocked him down, but the grenade went flying, pin pulled, seconds ticking away. I lunged for it. Larry Connaught was ahead of me.  The newspaper stories made heroes out of both of us. They said it was miraculous that Larry, who had fallen right on top of the grenade, had managed to get it away from himself and so placed that when it exploded no one was hurt.  For it did go off--and the flying steel touched nobody. The papers mentioned that Larry had been knocked unconscious by the blast. He was unconscious, all right.  He didn't come to for six hours and when he woke up, he spent the next whole day in a stupor.  I called on him the next night. He was glad to see me.  \"That was a close one, Dick,\" he said. \"Take me back to Tarawa.\"  I said, \"I guess you saved my life, Larry.\"  \"Nonsense, Dick! I just jumped. Lucky, that's all.\"  \"The papers said you were terrific. They said you moved so fast, nobody could see exactly what happened.\"  He made a deprecating gesture, but his wet little eyes were wary. \"Nobody was really watching, I suppose.\"  \"I was watching,\" I told him flatly.  He looked at me silently for a moment.  \"I was between you and the grenade,\" I said. \"You didn't go past me, over me, or through me. But you were on top of the grenade.\"  He started to shake his head.  I said, \"Also, Larry, you fell _on_ the grenade. It exploded underneath you. I know, because I was almost on top of you, and it blew you clear off the floor of the gallery. Did you have a bulletproof vest on?\"         *       *       *       *       *  He cleared his throat. \"Well, as a matter of--\"  \"Cut it out, Larry! What's the answer?\"  He took off his glasses and rubbed his watery eyes. He grumbled, \"Don't you read the papers? It went off a yard away.\"  \"Larry,\" I said gently, \"I was there.\"  He slumped back in his chair, staring at me. Larry Connaught was a small man, but he never looked smaller than he did in that big chair, looking at me as though I were Mr. Nemesis himself.  Then he laughed. He surprised me; he sounded almost happy. He said, \"Well, hell, Dick--I had to tell somebody about it sooner or later. Why not you?\"  I can't tell you all of what he said. I'll tell most of it--but not the part that matters.  I'll never tell _that_ part to _anybody_.  Larry said, \"I should have known you'd remember.\" He smiled at me ruefully, affectionately. \"Those bull sessions in the cafeterias, eh? Talking all night about everything. But you remembered.\"  \"You claimed that the human mind possessed powers of psychokinesis,\" I said. \"You argued that just by the mind, without moving a finger or using a machine, a man could move his body anywhere, instantly. You said that nothing was impossible to the mind.\"  I felt like an absolute fool saying those things; they were ridiculous notions. Imagine a man _thinking_ himself from one place to another! But--I had been on that gallery.  I licked my lips and looked to Larry Connaught for confirmation.  \"I was all wet,\" Larry laughed. \"Imagine!\"  I suppose I showed surprise, because he patted my shoulder.  He said, becoming sober, \"Sure, Dick, you're wrong, but you're right all the same. The mind alone can't do anything of the sort--that was just a silly kid notion. But,\" he went on, \"_but_ there are--well, techniques--linking the mind to physical forces--simple physical forces that we all use every day--that can do it all. Everything! Everything I ever thought of and things I haven't found out yet.  \"Fly across the ocean? In a second, Dick! Wall off an exploding bomb? Easily! You saw me do it. Oh, it's work. It takes energy--you can't escape natural law. That was what knocked me out for a whole day. But that was a hard one; it's a lot easier, for instance, to make a bullet miss its target. It's even easier to lift the cartridge out of the chamber and put it in my pocket, so that the bullet can't even be fired. Want the Crown Jewels of England? I could get them, Dick!\"  I asked, \"Can you see the future?\"  He frowned. \"That's silly. This isn't supersti--\"  \"How about reading minds?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Larry's expression cleared. \"Oh, you're remembering some of the things I said years ago. No, I can't do that either, Dick. Maybe, some day, if I keep working at this thing-- Well, I can't right now. There are things I can do, though, that are just as good.\"  \"Show me something you can do,\" I asked.  He smiled. Larry was enjoying himself; I didn't begrudge it to him. He had hugged this to himself for years, from the day he found his first clue, through the decade of proving and experimenting, almost always being wrong, but always getting closer.... He _needed_ to talk about it. I think he was really glad that, at last, someone had found him out.  He said, \"Show you something? Why, let's see, Dick.\" He looked around the room, then winked. \"See that window?\"  [Illustration]  I looked. It opened with a slither of wood and a rumble of sash weights. It closed again.  \"The radio,\" said Larry. There was a _click_ and his little set turned itself on. \"Watch it.\"  It disappeared and reappeared.  \"It was on top of Mount Everest,\" Larry said, panting a little.  The plug on the radio's electric cord picked itself up and stretched toward the baseboard socket, then dropped to the floor again.  \"No,\" said Larry, and his voice was trembling, \"I'll show you a hard one. Watch the radio, Dick. I'll run it without plugging it in! The electrons themselves--\"  He was staring intently at the little set. I saw the dial light go on, flicker, and hold steady; the speaker began to make scratching noises. I stood up, right behind Larry, right over him.  I used the telephone on the table beside him. I caught him right beside the ear and he folded over without a murmur. Methodically, I hit him twice more, and then I was sure he wouldn't wake up for at least an hour. I rolled him over and put the telephone back in its cradle.  I ransacked his apartment. I found it in his desk: All his notes. All the information. The secret of how to do the things he could do.  I picked up the telephone and called the Washington police. When I heard the siren outside, I took out my service revolver and shot him in the throat. He was dead before they came in.         *       *       *       *       *  For, you see, I knew Laurence Connaught. We were friends. I would have trusted him with my life. But this was more than just a life.  Twenty-three words told how to do the things that Laurence Connaught did. Anyone who could read could do them. Criminals, traitors, lunatics--the formula would work for anyone.  Laurence Connaught was an honest man and an idealist, I think. But what would happen to any man when he became God?
