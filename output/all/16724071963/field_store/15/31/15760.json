The bicycle clattered in the street.  \"Howdy, partner!\" the tall man said. \"The rustlers are headin' for the plateau! We'll take the short gash and head 'em off at the canyon!\"  \"Ramrod Jones?\" Gary chirped.  \"Here's the truck I haul Quizz-kid, the I.Q. Horse, in! Let's get after the rustlers!\" Jones said.  \"Gee, I've seen all your pictures, Ramrod,\" Gary said. \"_Silver City Raiders_, _Rustlers of Silver City_, _Silver City Rustlers_--\"  The great cowboy lifted the newsboy into the _Honeychile_ truck.         *       *       *       *       *  Pink and rose clouds drifted through a brightening sky as the _Honeychile Bakery_ truck careened along a narrow road badly in need of rock and grading. From the road, the truck rattled into a rutted track through dewy woods and skidded swaying to a stop at the side of a long, low, grassy hill.  The tall creature dressed in black, red-spotted fur stepped from the cab. An opening appeared in the hillside. Four machines--dull metal eggs balancing on single tractor treads--rolled silently through the opening. Jointed steel arms darted from recesses in the eggs. One machine opened the truck doors.  The creature walked up a ramp inside the hill and entered a shimmering metallic compartment.  \"Greetings, Eo. I have returned.\"  Eo, who wore a suit of white fur, hummed, \"None too soon, Za. We miscalculated dawn. What success?\"  \"An excellent group,\" Za said. He stretched and reclined on a transparent slab. \"The servants are unloading the vehicle. I captured a young male, a mature male, an aged male, some sort of official or guardian male, a mature female, and an aged female.\"  \"Let's view them,\" Eo said. \"You can rest after we're away.\"  The tall creatures entered a second compartment furnished with a large table upon which the silent machines deposited inanimate bodies. \"Extraordinary!\" said Eo, staring at Miss Betsy Tapp. \"These things have reached a peak of mammalian development!\"  \"Her correct garments are in this bundle,\" Za explained. \"The servants are bringing the properties now. I secured a signaling device and a box used in an extremely primitive system of communication. Also, I brought the quaint muscle-powered vehicle ridden by the young male. The photographs should be sufficient for other details.\"  \"Any difficulty?\" Eo asked as the machines dumped Patrolman Whedbee on the table.  \"The language was the greatest obstacle,\" Za said. \"The same word has many different meanings, or many different words have the same meaning. Rather crude.\"  \"Did you use bait, or force?\"  \"Bait,\" Za said. \"It's much simpler. This is a completely selfish, egocentric breed. Most of them have one thing in mind which they want solely for themselves. Their sending power is weak, but that one selfish desire is powerful enough to be received. I merely dangled it before their minds, and they were hooked.\" He tapped the foot of Calvin C. Kear. \"I killed this one's female companion. She awoke and screamed. The males and females pair off and live together for years. Strange custom! Breeding seems to be only one reason for the mutual bondage.\"  Za pointed to Mrs. Jane Huprich. \"The old female may be an exception to the selfishness. I couldn't decide whether she most wanted to be relieved of cleaning floors by primitive methods, or wanted her male offspring to be released from some structure where he had been secured for reasons I couldn't determine.\"  The machines deposited the Reverend Enos Shackelford and then lined up in a precise row. \"This thing is dead!\" Eo buzzed.  Za shook his head. \"That was the only genuine exception. He confused me till I forgot his proper clothing, but some can be devised from the other samples. He seems to have been a witch-doctor. His mind was cluttered with myths and superstitions from an ancient text. I don't understand him, Eo, and wish I had time to study the phenomena. He was different from the others. He believed in something and considered himself lowly and humble. The minds of the others were in constant confusion. They believed, actually, in nothing. Somehow, he saw me, Eo. I was forced to kill him.\"  \"No harm done,\" Eo decided. He faced the machines and said, \"Destroy the vehicle, draw in the camouflage net, prepare for take-off.\" The machines rolled from the compartment, and the two creatures followed.  \"Seal it,\" Eo said. \"I'll plasticize them when we're in space. Fine work, Za. I can see the plaque now: 'Mounted by Eo, Collected by Za. Typical Street Corner on Planet _Earth_, Star _Sol_.' The directors will surely give the group a prominent place in the Galactic Museum of Natural History!\"  \"Yes,\" Za agreed, glancing back at the Reverend Enos Shackelford. \"This planet was a fortunate stopover.\"   _The End_     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and     Fantasy_ August 1953.

His vision went beyond the Congress of the United States, past the balmy June day to another day that was coming. A day when the Army would have its destined place of authority.  He drew a deep breath and delivered what was perhaps the shortest speech ever heard in the hallowed halls of Congress:  \"The General Staff of the U.S. Army requests Congress to abolish the archaic branch of the armed forces known as the U.S. Navy.\"  The aging Senator from Georgia checked his hearing aid to see if it was in operating order, while the press box emptied itself in one concerted rush and a clatter of running feet that died off in the direction of the telephone room. A buzz of excited comment ran through the giant chamber. One by one the heads turned to face the Naval section where rows of blue figures stirred and buzzed like smoked-out bees. The knot of men around a paunchy figure heavy with gold braid broke up and Admiral Fitzjames climbed slowly to his feet.  Lesser men have quailed before that piercing stare, but General Wingrove was never the lesser man. The admiral tossed his head with disgust, every line of his body denoting outraged dignity. He turned to his audience, a small pulse beating in his forehead.  \"I cannot comprehend the general's attitude, nor can I understand why he has attacked the Navy in this unwarranted fashion. The Navy has existed and will always exist as the first barrier of American defense. I ask you, gentlemen, to ignore this request as you would ignore the statements of any person ... er, slightly demented. I should like to offer a recommendation that the general's sanity be investigated, and an inquiry be made as to the mental health of anyone else connected with this preposterous proposal!\"  The general smiled calmly. \"I understand, Admiral, and really don't blame you for being slightly annoyed. But, please let us not bring this issue of national importance down to a shallow personal level. The Army has facts to back up this request--facts that shall be demonstrated tomorrow morning.\"  Turning his back on the raging admiral, General Wingrove included all the assembled solons in one sweeping gesture.  \"Reserve your judgment until that time, gentlemen, make no hasty judgments until you have seen the force of argument with which we back up our request. It is the end of an era. In the morning the Navy joins its fellow fossils, the dodo and the brontosaurus.\"  The admiral's blood pressure mounted to a new record and the gentle thud of his unconscious body striking the floor was the only sound to break the shocked silence of the giant hall.         *       *       *       *       *  The early morning sun warmed the white marble of the Jefferson Memorial and glinted from the soldiers' helmets and the roofs of the packed cars that crowded forward in a slow-moving stream. All the gentlemen of Congress were there, the passage of their cars cleared by the screaming sirens of motorcycle policemen. Around and under the wheels of the official cars pressed a solid wave of government workers and common citizens of the capital city. The trucks of the radio and television services pressed close, microphones and cameras extended.  The stage was set for a great day. Neat rows of olive drab vehicles curved along the water's edge. Jeeps and half-tracks shouldered close by weapons carriers and six-bys, all of them shrinking to insignificance beside the looming Patton tanks. A speakers' platform was set up in the center of the line, near the audience.  At precisely 10 a.m., General Wingrove stepped forward and scowled at the crowd until they settled into an uncomfortable silence. His speech was short and consisted of nothing more than amplifications of his opening statement that actions speak louder than words. He pointed to the first truck in line, a 2Â½-ton filled with an infantry squad sitting stiffly at attention.  The driver caught the signal and kicked the engine into life; with a grind of gears it moved forward toward the river's edge. There was an indrawn gasp from the crowd as the front wheels ground over the marble parapet--then the truck was plunging down toward the muddy waters of the Potomac.  The wheels touched the water and the surface seemed to sink while taking on a strange glassy character. The truck roared into high gear and rode forward on the surface of the water surrounded by a saucer-shaped depression. It parked two hundred yards off shore and the soldiers, goaded by the sergeant's bark, leapt out and lined up with a showy _present arms_.  The general returned the salute and waved to the remaining vehicles. They moved forward in a series of maneuvers that indicated a great number of rehearsal hours on some hidden pond. The tanks rumbled slowly over the water while the jeeps cut back and forth through their lines in intricate patterns. The trucks backed and turned like puffing ballerinas.  The audience was rooted in a hushed silence, their eyeballs bulging. They continued to watch the amazing display as General Wingrove spoke again:  \"You see before you a typical example of Army ingenuity, developed in Army laboratories. These motor units are supported on the surface of the water by an intensifying of the surface tension in their immediate area. Their weight is evenly distributed over the surface, causing the shallow depressions you see around them.  \"This remarkable feat has been accomplished by the use of the _Dornifier_. A remarkable invention that is named after that brilliant scientist, Colonel Robert A. Dorn, Commander of the Brooke Point Experimental Laboratory. It was there that one of the civilian employees discovered the Dorn effect--under the Colonel's constant guidance, of course.  \"Utilizing this invention the Army now becomes master of the sea as well as the land. Army convoys of trucks and tanks can blanket the world. The surface of the water is our highway, our motor park, our battleground--the airfield and runway for our planes.\"  Mechanics were pushing a Shooting Star onto the water. They stepped clear as flame gushed from the tail pipe; with the familiar whooshing rumble it sped down the Potomac and hurled itself into the air.  \"When this cheap and simple method of crossing oceans is adopted, it will of course mean the end of that fantastic medieval anachronism, the Navy. No need for billion-dollar aircraft carriers, battleships, drydocks and all the other cumbersome junk that keeps those boats and things afloat. Give the taxpayer back his hard-earned dollar!\"  Teeth grated in the Naval section as carriers and battleships were called \"boats\" and the rest of America's sea might lumped under the casual heading of \"things.\" Lips were curled at the transparent appeal to the taxpayer's pocketbook. But with leaden hearts they knew that all this justified wrath and contempt would avail them nothing. This was Army Day with a vengeance, and the doom of the Navy seemed inescapable.  The Army had made elaborate plans for what they called \"Operation Sinker.\" Even as the general spoke the publicity mills ground into high gear. From coast to coast the citizens absorbed the news with their morning nourishment.  \"... Agnes, you hear what the radio said! The Army's gonna give a trip around the world in a B-36 as first prize in this limerick contest. All you have to do is fill in the last line, and mail one copy to the Pentagon and the other to the Navy ...\"  The Naval mail room had standing orders to burn all the limericks when they came in, but some of the newer men seemed to think the entire thing was a big joke. Commander Bullman found one in the mess hall:      _The Army will always be there,     On the land, on the sea, in the air.     So why should the Navy     Take all of the gravy ..._  to which a seagoing scribe had added:      _And not give us ensigns our share?_  The newspapers were filled daily with photographs of mighty B-36's landing on Lake Erie, and grinning soldiers making mock beachhead attacks on Coney Island. Each man wore a buzzing black box at his waist and walked on the bosom of the now quiet Atlantic like a biblical prophet.  Radio and television also carried the thousands of news releases that poured in an unending flow from the Pentagon Building. Cards, letters, telegrams and packages descended on Washington in an overwhelming torrent. The Navy Department was the unhappy recipient of deprecatory letters and a vast quantity of little cardboard battleships.  The people spoke and their representatives listened closely. This was an election year. There didn't seem to be much doubt as to the decision, particularly when the reduction in the budget was considered.  It took Congress only two months to make up its collective mind. The people were all pro-Army. The novelty of the idea had fired their imaginations.  They were about to take the final vote in the lower house. If the amendment passed it would go to the states for ratification, and their votes were certain to follow that of Congress. The Navy had fought a last-ditch battle to no avail. The balloting was going to be pretty much of a sure thing--the wet water Navy would soon become ancient history.  For some reason the admirals didn't look as unhappy as they should.         *       *       *       *       *  The Naval Department had requested one last opportunity to address the Congress. Congress had patronizingly granted permission, for even the doomed man is allowed one last speech. Admiral Fitzjames, who had recovered from his choleric attack, was the appointed speaker.  \"Gentlemen of the Congress of the United States. We in the Navy have a fighting tradition. We 'damn the torpedoes' and sail"]]]
