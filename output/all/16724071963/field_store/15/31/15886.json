Don't you see what happened? Each part of a screamer has to be checked separately, right?\"  Al-Amin nodded.  \"Why? Because the things burn out if you check them as a complete unit. It's like checking a .50 caliber cartridge. The only way you can check a cartridge is to shoot it in a gun. If it works, then you know it works. Period. The only trouble is that you've wasted the cartridge. You know that _that_ one is good, but you've ruined it.  \"Same way with a screamer. If you test it as a unit, you'll ruin it. So you test it a part at a time. All the parts check out nicely because the test mechanisms are built to check each part.\"  Smith squinted. \"Well, sure. If you check out the whole screamer, you'll ruin it. So what?\"  \"So suppose you were going to check out a cartridge,\" Jayjay said. \"You don't fire it; you check each part separately. You check the brass case. It's all right; the tests show that it won't burst under firing pressure. You check the primer; the tests show that it will explode when hit by the gun's hammer. You check the powder; the tests show that the powder will burn nicely when the flame from the primer hits it. You check the bullet; the tests show that the slug will be expelled at the proper velocity when the powder is ignited.  \"So you assume that the cartridge will function when fired.  \"But will it?\"  \"Why wouldn't it?\" Smith asked.  \"Because the flame from the exploding primer can't reach the powder, that's why!\" Jayjay snapped. \"Some jerk has redesigned the primer so that the flame misses the propellant!\"  \"How could that happen?\" Hull asked blankly.  \"How? Because Designer _A_ decided that the male plug on the screamer should have one more turn on its threads, but he forgot to tell Designer _B_, who designs the female plug, that the two should match. The testing equipment is designed to test each part, so each part tests out fine. The only trouble is that the thing doesn't test out as a whole.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Captain Al-Amin nodded slowly. \"That's right. The test showed that the oxyhydrogen section worked fine. It showed that the starter worked fine. It showed that the radiowave broadcaster worked fine. But it didn't show that they'd work together.\"  Smith said a short, five-letter word. It was French; the Anglo-Saxon equivalent has only four letters. \"What good does all this theorizing do us?\" he added. \"The question is: How do we fix the thing?\"  \"Well, can't you put another turn on the thread?\" Hull asked.  \"Oh, sure,\" Smith said sarcastically. \"You give me a lathe and the proper tools, and I'll make you all the connections you want. Hell, if I had the proper tools, I could turn us out a new spaceship, and we could all go home in comfort.\"  \"Couldn't you drill out the metal with that drill?\" Hull asked plaintively.  \"No!\" Smith said harshly. \"How do you expect me to get a quarter-inch bit into a space less than a sixteenth of an inch in diameter?\"  Hull wasn't used to machinist's terms. \"How big is an inch?\"  \"Two point five four oh oh oh five centimeters,\" Smith said in a nasty tone of voice. \"Does that help you any?\"  \"I'm just trying to help!\" Hull snapped. \"You've got no call to get sarcastic with me!\"  Smith said the French word again.  \"Enough!\" the captain barked. \"Smith, control your tongue! That sort of thing won't help us.\" He jerked his head around. \"Mr. Kelvin, do you have any suggestions?\"  Jayjay played another card. \"No. Not yet. I'm thinking.\"  \"Smith? Any ideas?\" The tone of the Arab's voice left no doubt that he meant business.  \"No, sir. Without a properly equipped machine shop, there's nothing we can do.\"  \"How so?\"  \"Because that's a precision job, sir. The threads are tapered so that the fit will be gas-tight. That's why the threads have a ten-thousandth of an inch of soft polyethylene covering the hard steel, so that when the threads are tight, the polyethylene will act as a seal. Everything in that connection is a precision fitted job. The ends of the tubes are made to be slightly mashed together, so that the seals will be tight--they're coated with polyethylene, too. If the oxygen and hydrogen mix, the efficiency of the fuel cell goes down to zero, and you run the chance of an explosion.\"  \"Show me,\" Al-Amin said.  Smith took a pencil out of his pocket and began drawing a cross section of the connection on the top of the nearby table.  \"Look here, captain, this is the way the two are supposed to fit. But they don't, because the male plug can't get far enough into the female socket to make the connection. Like this, see?\"  The captain nodded.  \"Well,\" Smith continued, \"there's a thirty-second of an inch clearance there. If the female had one more turn of thread, the fit would be prefect. As it is, we get no connection. So the screamer doesn't function.\"  Al-Amin looked at the drawing. \"Odd that there's never been any complaint about this error before.\"  Jayjay turned another ace. \"Not so odd, really.\"  All heads turned toward Jayjay.  \"What does that mean?\" Smith asked.  \"Just what I said.\" Jayjay turned another card. \"A screamer is supposed to call for help, isn't it? It's only used in a dire emergency. Then the only test of the whole unit comes when the occupants of the spaceship are in danger--as we are. If the things don't work, how could there be any complaint? If we can't get ours to work, will we complain? To whom?  \"How many ships have been reported missing in the past year or so? All of them presumed lost because of meteor strikes, eh? If a ship is lost and doesn't signal, we presume that it was totally destroyed. If it wasn't, they'd have signaled. As _Mister_ Smith says: See?\"  There was a long silence.  Jayjay Kelvin turned the last card, saw that he had lost, and began shuffling the deck.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I think I've got it,\" Smith said excitedly, several hours later.  Captain Al-Amin glanced around. Hull was dozing fitfully a few inches above the couch. Jayjay Kelvin was still methodically playing solitaire.  \"Keep your voice down,\" the captain ordered. \"No use giving our passengers false hopes. What do you mean, you've got it?\"  \"Simple. Real simple. All we have to do is file off the last thread of the male plug. Then it will fit into the female.\" Smith's voice was a hoarse whisper.  \"Won't work,\" said Jayjay Kelvin from across the room.  Smith blew up. \"How do you know?\" he roared. \"You sit over there making wiseacre remarks and do nothing! Play cards, that's all! What do you know about things like this, _Mister_ Joseph Kelvin? What does a businessman know about mechanical equipment?\"  \"Enough,\" Jayjay said quietly. \"Enough to know that, if you try to file off the final thread of the male plug, you'll do an uneven job. And that will mean leakage.\"  \"What do you mean, an uneven job?\" Smith was still furious.  \"Trimming off the end of the male plug would have to be done on a lathe,\" Jayjay said, without looking up from his cards. \"Otherwise, the fit would be wrong, and the gases would mix. And we would all go _phfft!_ when the mixture blew.\"  Smith started to say something, but Jayjay went right on talking. \"Even if we had a lathe, the male plug doesn't turn, so you'd be out of luck all the way. You can't take the screamers apart without wrecking them--not without a machine shop. You're going to have to work on that female connection. She's got a sleeve on her that will turn. Now, if--\" Jayjay's voice faded off into silence, and his manipulations of the cards became purely mechanical.  \"Huh!\" Smith said softly. \"Just because he's related to Kelvin Associates, he thinks he's hot--\" He said the French word again.  \"Is he right?\" Captain Al-Amin asked sharply.  \"Well--\" Smith rubbed his nose with a forefinger. \"Well, yes. I was wrong. We can't do it with a file. It would have to be turned on a lathe, and we don't have a lathe. And we don't have any measuring instruments, either. This is a precision job, as I said. And we don't have a common ruler aboard, much less a micrometer. Any makeshift job will be a failure.\"  Captain Al-Amin brooded over that for a moment. Then he looked at Jayjay again. \"Mr. Kelvin.\"  \"Yes, captain?\" Jayjay didn't look up from the cards in his hands.  \"_Are_ you related to Kelvin Associates?\"  \"In a way.\"  Al-Amin bit at his lower lip. \"Mr. Kelvin, you registered aboard this ship as Joseph Kelvin. May I ask if your middle name is James?\"  After a short pause, Jayjay said: \"Yes. It is.\"  \"Are you _the_ J. J. Kelvin?\"  \"Yup. But I'd rather you didn't mention it when we get to Pluto.\"  Smith's jaw had slowly sagged during that conversation. Then he closed his mouth with a snap. \"You're Jayjay Kelvin?\" he asked, opening his mouth again.  \"That's right.\"  \"Then I apologize.\"  \"Accepted,\" said Jayjay. He wished that Smith hadn't apologized.  \"Why didn't you say so in the first place?\" Captain Al-Amin asked.  \"Because I didn't want it known that I was going to Pluto,\" Kelvin said. \"And--after the accident happened--I kept quiet because I know human nature.\"  Jeffry Hull, who had awakened during the argument, looked at Jayjay and said: \"What's human nature got to do with it, Mr. Kelvin?\"  \"Nothing, except that if I'd told everyone I was J. J. Kelvin, all of you would have been sitting around waiting for me to solve the problem instead of thinking about it yourselves.\"  Hull nodded thoughtfully. \"It makes sense, Mr. Kelvin. If they'd known that you were ... well ... Mister Spaceship Himself, they'd have let you do all the thinking. And that would have left you high and dry, wouldn't it?\"  Jayjay put the deck of cards in his pocket. \"You're a pretty good sociologist, after all, Mr. Hull. You're right. Face any group with Authority--with a capital _A_--and they quit thinking for themselves. And if they do, then the poor slob of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30308"],["title","Hanging (#5)"],["body","Authority doesn't have anything to tickle his own brains, so everybody loses.\"  \"Well, _do_ you have an answer?\" Captain Al-Amin asked.  Jayjay shook his head. \"Not yet. I think I've got one coming up, but I wish you two would go on talking while I think.\"  \"I'll try,\" Smith said wryly.         *       *       *       *       *  The problem was both simple and complex. The female socket lacked one single turn of thread to make a perfect connection. A few hundredths of an inch separated success from disaster.  Five men, including the unconscious Vandenbosch, were only a fraction of an inch away from death.  Jayjay Kelvin listened to Smith talk for another half hour, throwing in objections when necessary, but offering no opinions.  \"All we have to do,\" Smith said at last, \"is get rid of that little bit of metal beyond the thread in the female socket. But there's no way to get it out. We can't use a chisel because the force would warp the threads. Besides, we couldn't get a chisel in there.\"  \"And we don't have a chisel,\" Captain Al-Amin added. \"We don't have any tools at all.\"  \"Except,\" said Jayjay, \"an electric hand drill and a quarter-inch bit.\"  \"Well, sure,\" said Smith. \"But what good will that do us?\"  \"If we rigged a belt between the drill's motor and the sleeve of the female socket, the sleeve would rotate as if it were on a lathe, wouldn't it?\"  Smith blinked. \"Sure. Yeah! Hey!\" His face brightened. Then it looked sad again. \"But what good would that do us?\"  \"You said that all we have between us and success is a fraction of an inch of metal. If we can remove that fraction of an inch, we're successful.\"  \"But how can you put a thread into that socket?\" Smith asked.  Jayjay beamed as though it were his birthday. \"We don't have to put a thread in there. All we have to do is give the thread on the male plug room to move in. All we have to do is clear away that metal. So we'll use the drill motor to turn the sleeve as if it were on a lathe.\"  Smith still didn't look enthusiastic. \"All right. We have a lathe. But what are we going to use for tools? What are we going to cut the metal with?\"  Jayjay's smile became broader. \"Carbon steel. What else?\"  \"Oh?\" said Smith. \"And where do we get these tools, Mr. Kelvin? From the circumambient ether?\"  \"Not at all,\" said Jayjay. \"Did you ever chip flint?\"  \"What?\"  \"Never mind. All we have to do is use that quarter-inch bit.\"  Smith still looked confused. \"I don't get it. A bit that big won't fit in.\"  \"We simply crack a piece off that hard carbon steel,\" Jayjay said. \"We can make a lathe tool that will fit into the small space between the inner and outer tubes. The fractured edge will be sharp enough to take out the excess metal. The male plug can move in, and we'll have contact.\"  \"Well, I'll be--\" Smith used another French word.  Captain Atef Al-Amin cast his eyes upwards. \"_Creatio ex nihilo_,\" he said softly.         *       *       *       *       *  When the Interplanetary Police ship took the five men and the cargo from the wreck of the _Persephone_, the major in command of the ship, who knew that he had rescued the great J. J. Kelvin, asked him: \"Mr. Kelvin, what do you plan to do when you return to Ceres City?\"  And Jayjay, who knew that both he and the major were speaking for the newsfacs and for posterity, said:  \"I'm going to make sure that Kelvin Associates learns to make emergency equipment properly. We will never again put faulty equipment aboard a ship.\"  The major looked perplexed. \"What?\"  \"I'm going to have some designer's head!\" said Jayjay Kelvin.
