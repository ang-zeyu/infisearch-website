We're into the big cave! Now another hundred feet.\"  The cable was moving slowly. In the middle of Riley's call of \"Fifty-two-eight,\" a jangling bell told that the bottom of the pyrometer carrier had touched.  \"Up with it,\" Smithy ordered. \"Make it snappy. We'll see if we've got another cargo of gold.\"  There was an undeniable thrill in this reaching to a tremendous distance underground, this groping about in a deep-hidden cave, where molten gold was to be found. What had they tapped?--he asked himself. He saw visions of some vast pool of hot, liquid gold. Perhaps Dean would have to change his plans. They could rig up some kind of a bailer; they could bring out thousands of dollars at a time.  He was watching for the first sight of the metal carrier, far more interested in what might be clinging to it than in the record of the pyrometer it held. He saw it emerge--then he stared in disbelief at the stubby mass at the cable's end, where all that remained of the long tube he had sent down was a dangling two feet of discolored metal, warped and distorted. The lower part, a full twenty feet in length, had been fused cleanly off.  Dean Rawson was there to watch the next attempt. Again Riley's roaring bass rolled out the count, but this time the call stopped at fifty-two-seven. The jangling bell told that the carrier had touched.  \"Divil a bit do I understand this,\" Riley was calling. \"We're right at the point where we dropped through into the clear. Right at the roof of the big cave--fifty-two-seven, it says--and no lower do we go. The bottom of the hole is plugged!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Rawson made no reply. He was scowling while he stared speculatively at the mouth of the twenty-inch bore--a vertical tunnel that led from the drilling floor down, down to some inner vault. \"Molten gold,\" he was thinking. \"It melted a cylinder of the new Krieger alloy--melted it when its melting point is way higher than that of any rock that we've hit. And now the bore is closed....\"  He was trying vainly to project his mental vision through those miles of hard rock to see what manner of mystery this was into which he had probed. He shook his head slowly in baffled speculation, then spoke sharply.  \"Drill it out!\" he ordered. \"We're into a hot spot sure enough, though I can't just figure out the how of it. But we'll tame it, Smithy. Send down the drill. Clean it out. Then we'll poke around down there and get the answer to all this.\"  Five days were needed to send down the big drill with a new drill-head replacing the other too fouled with gold for any use. The tubular sections, a hundred feet in length, were hooked together and lowered one by one. Each joint meant the coupling of the air-pipe as well. Air, mixed with water from the outer jacket, must come foaming up through the central core to bring the powdered rock to the surface.  Five days, then one hour of boring, and another five days to pull out the drill before Rawson could hope for his answer. But he found it in the severed shaft of the great drill where the head had been melted completely off. The big stem that would have resisted all but electric furnace heat, and been cut through like a tallow candle in the blast of an oxy-acetylene flame.     CHAPTER III  _Red Drops_   The flat-roofed shack of yellow boards that was Dean Rawson's \"office\" had a second canopy roof built above it and extending out on all sides like a wooden umbrella. Thick pitch fried almost audibly from the fir boards when the sun drove straight from overhead, but beneath their shelter the heat was more bearable.  By an open window, where a hot breeze stirred sluggishly, Rawson sat in silent contemplation of the camp. His face was as copper-colored as an Apache's and as motionless. His eyes were fixed unwaveringly upon a distant derrick and the blasted stub of a big drill that hung unmoving above the concrete floor.  But the man's eyes did not consciously record the details of that scene. He saw nothing of the derrick or of the heat waves that made the steel seem writhingly alive; he was looking at something far more distant, something many miles away, something vague and mysterious, hidden miles beneath the surface of the earth.  \"Heat,\" he said at last, as if talking in a dream. \"Heat, terrific temperatures--but I can't make it out; I can't see it!\"  The younger, broad-shouldered man, whose khaki shirt, thrown open at the neck showed a chest tanned to the black-brown of his face, stopped his restless pacing back and forth in the hot room.  \"Yes?\" he asked with a touch of irritation in his tone. \"There's plenty of heat there--heat enough to melt off the shaft of that high-temp alloy! What the devil's the use of wondering about the heat, Dean? What gets me is this: the shaft has been plugged again. Now, what kind of....\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dean Rawson's face had not moved a muscle during the other's outburst. His eyes were still fixed on that place that was so far away, yet which he tried to bring close in his mind, close enough to see, to comprehend the mystery that should be so plain.  \"Lava wouldn't do it!\" he said softly. \"No melted stone would melt the Krieger alloy, unless it was under pressure, which this was not. There was no blast coming out of our shaft. Yet we dipped into that gold; we stuck the drill right down into it. But what did we go into the next time? What did we dip into?\"  He swung quickly, violently, toward Smithy who was facing him from the middle of the room. He aimed one finger at him as if it were a pistol, and his words cracked out as sharply as if they came from a gun:  \"That tube you sent down--that piece of casing! How was it burned? Were there straggling ends, frozen gobs of metal? Did it look like an old-fashioned molasses candy bar that's been melted? Did it?\"  \"Why, no,\" said Smithy. \"It hadn't dripped any; it was cut off nice and clean.\"  \"Cut!\" Rawson almost shouted the word. \"You said it, Smithy. So was the shaft of the drill. And if you ever saw a piece of this alloy being melted you know that it's as gummy as a pot of old paint. It was cut, Smithy! Dipping into that melted gold threw us off the track; we were thinking of ramming the drill down into a mess of lava. But we didn't. It was cut off by a blast of flame so much hotter than lava that melted rock would seem cold!\"  \"And that helps us a lot, doesn't it,\" asked Smithy, scornfully, \"when the flame melts the end of the shaft shut as fast as we open it?\"  Dean Rawson's lean, muscular hands took Smithy's broad shoulders and spun the younger man around. \"Cheer up,\" Dean told him. \"We've got it licked. Why it doesn't blow out of that shaft like hell out for noon is more than I can see; but the heat's there! We've won!\"  \"But--\" Smithy began. Rawson sent him spinning toward the door in a good-natured showing of strength that his assistant had not yet guessed.  \"Soup!\" he ordered. \"Break out the nitroglycerine, Smithy. Get that Swede, Hanson, on the job; he's a shooter. He knows his stuff. We'll blow open the bottom end of our shaft so it'll never go shut!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Hanson knew his stuff and did it. But he met Rawson's inquiring eyes with a puzzled shake of his head when the open mouth of the twenty-inch bore gave faint echo of the deep explosion and followed after a time with only a feeble puff of air.  \"Like a cannon, she should have gone,\" Hanson stated. \"And she yoost go _phht_!\"  \"It's open down below,\" said Rawson briefly. \"This is a different kind of a well from the kind you've been shooting.\"  To the waiting Riley he said: \"Hook a bailer onto that cable and send it down. See what you can tell about the hole.\"  Again ten miles of cable hissed smoothly down the gaping throat. Then it slowed.  \"Fifty-two-seven,\" said Riley, \"and she's open. Seven twenty-five! Seven fifty, and we're on bottom!\"  \"Up,\" Rawson ordered, \"if there's anything left of the bailer. It's probably melted into scrap.\"  But strangely it was not. It hung from the dangling cable spinning lazily until Riley stepped in to check its motion.  There was a check valve in the bottom--a door that opened inwardly, to take in water and fragments of rock when need arose. Riley, disregarding the possible heat of the twirling bailer, reached for it with bare hands. He drew them back, then held them before him--and a hundred watching eyes saw what had been unseen before: the slow dropping of red liquid from the bailer's end. The same drops were falling from Riley's hands that had touched that end.  \"Blood!\" The word came from the foreman's throat in one horrified gasp. It ran in a whispering echo from one to another of the watching crew. From far across the hot sands came the rattle of a truck that brought the first of many loads of cement and steel for Rawson's buildings. Its driver was singing lustily:      \"Hark to what I say:     You're pokin' through the crust of hell     And braggin' too damn loud of it,     For, when you get to hell, you'll find     The devil there to pay!\"  But Rawson, looking dazedly into Smithy's eyes, said only: \"It's cold--the bailer's cold. There's no heat there.\"     CHAPTER IV  _The Light in the Crater_   \"Of course it wasn't blood!\" said Smithy explosively. \"But try to tell the men that. See how far you get. 'Devils!' That's been their talk since yesterday when Riley got smeared up--and now that the bailer's gone we can't prove a thing.\"  Again he was pacing restlessly back and forth in the little board shack that was Rawson's field head-quarters. Rawson, seated by the window, was looking at tables of comparative melting points. He glanced up sharply.  \"You haven't found it yet?\" he questioned. \"A forty-foot bailer! Now that's a nice easy little thing to mislay.\"  Riley had followed the excited Smithy into"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29965"],["title","Two Thousand Miles Below (#4)"],["body"," room; he stood silently by the door until he caught Rawson's questioning glance.  \"Forty feet or forty inches,\" he said, \"'tis gone! 'Twas there by the derrick last night, and this marnin'--\"  \"That's fine,\" Rawson interrupted with heavy sarcasm. \"I haven't enough down below ground to keep my mind occupied--I need a few mysteries up top. Now do you really expect me to believe that a thing like that bailer has been carried off?\"  This time it was Smithy who interrupted. \"You can just practise believing on that, Dean,\" he said. \"When you get so you can believe a forty-foot bailer can vanish into thin air, then you'll be ready for what I've got. This is what I came in to tell you: that one truckload of steel grillage beams for the turbine footings--they were put out where we surveyed for the first power house--dumped on the sand....\"  \"Well?\" questioned Rawson, as Smithy paused. His look was daring Smithy to say what he knew was coming.  \"Five tons of steel beams,\" said Smithy softly, \"gone--just like that! Just a hollow in the sand!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The big figure of the Irish foreman was still beside the door. Rawson saw one clumsy hand make the sign of the Cross; then Riley held that hand before him and stared at it in horror. \"Divils' blood,\" he whispered. \"And I dipped my hands in it. Saints protect us all!\"  \"That will be all of that!\" Dean Rawson's usually quiet voice was as full of crackling emphasis as if it had been charged with electrical energy. \"If anyone thinks that I have gone this far, just to be scared out by some dirty sabotage....  \"I see it all. I don't know how they did it, but it's all come since the gold was found. Someone else wants it. They think they can scare off the men, maybe take a pot-shot at me, come back here and clean up later on, pull up gold by the pailful, I suppose--\"  Riley leaped forward and banged his big fist down on the table. \"Right ye are!\" he shouted, until loitering men in the open \"street\" outside stared curiously. \"Divils they are, but they're the kind of divils we know how to handle. And now I'll tell ye somethin' else, sir: I know where they are hidin'.  \"There was no work for anyone last night, but I'm used to bein' up. I couldn't sleep. I was wanderin' around, thinkin' of nothin' at all out of the way, and I thought I saw some shadows, like it might be men, way off on the sand. Then later over to the old ghost town, d'ye mind! I saw a light, a queer, green sort of light. Sure, a fool I was callin' meself at the time, but now I believe it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dean Rawson had crossed the room while the man was still speaking. He dragged a wooden case from beneath his cot and smashed at the lid with a wrecking bar. Then he reached inside and drew forth a blue-black .45.  He tossed the pistol to Riley. \"Know how to use one of these?\" he asked. The manner in which the big Irishman snapped open the side ejection was sufficient answer. Dean handed another gun to Smithy, then pulled out more and laid them on his cot together with a little pile of cartridge boxes.  \"You're all right, Riley,\" he said. \"Just keep your head. Don't let your damned superstitions run away with you, and I wouldn't ask for a better man to stand alongside of in a scrap.\"  The foreman beamed with pleasure: Rawson went on in crisp sentences:  \"Take these guns. Take plenty of ammunition. Pick five or six men you know you can depend on. Mount guard around this camp to-night. I'll post an order saying you're in charge--and I'm telling you now to use those guns on anything you see.  \"Smithy,\" he said to the other man who had been quietly listening, \"you and I are going to start for town. Only Riley will know that we're gone for the night. We'll have a little listening post of our own up here in the hills.\"  But Rawson postponed their going. More material was arriving; one casting in particular needed all the men and Rawson's supervision to place it on the sand where an erection crew could swing it into place at some later date. And then, when he and Smithy had driven away from camp with the distant city as their announced destination, Rawson still did not go directly to the mountain grade. He swung off instead where rolling sand-hills blocked all view from the camp, and he headed the car into a gusty wind that brought whirling clouds of dust; they almost obscured the crumbling walls at the volcano's base.  The ghost towns that are found here and there in the forsaken wilderness of the West are depressing to one who walks their empty streets. Little Rhyolite was no exception. In gray, ghostly walls, empty windows stared steadily, disconcertingly like sockets of dead eyes in tattered, weatherbeaten skulls.         *       *       *       *       *  Dean and Smithy walked among the roofless ruins. Lizards, the color of the cold, gray walls, slipped from sight on silent, clinging feet. Once a sidewinder, almost invisible against the sand, looped away from the intruders with smooth deliberation.  \"No marks here,\" said Rawson at last. \"Even an Indian can't read sign in this ashy sand when the wind has dusted it off.\"  He turned his head from a whirl of fine ash where the wind, sweeping around a wall of stone, was scouring at a sand dune's sloping side.  \"Dean,\" said Smithy, \"old Riley may have been looking for banshees when he saw these lights. Superstitious old cuss, Riley! Maybe there wasn't anything here. But, Dean, there's some confoundedly funny things happening around here.\"  \"Are you telling me?\" Rawson asked grimly. \"But we want to remember one thing,\" he added: \"We've punched a hole in the ground, and we've got into a place that is hot enough to melt Krieger alloy one minute and is stone cold the next. That's disturbing enough, but we don't want to get that mixed up with what's happening up top. There's dirty work going on--\"  He stopped. His eyes, that had never ceased to search for some mark of special meaning, had come to rest upon an object half hidden in the sand. He stooped and picked it up.  \"Now what the devil is this?\" Smithy began. But Rawson was staring at the smooth lava block that was in his hand. It was tapered; it was pierced through with a straight, smooth hole, and its base was round and ringed as if it had been held in a clamp.  \"That,\" he said at last, \"was brought in from outside. Outside, Smithy--get that.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dean Rawson's face was wreathed in a sudden smile of pure pleasure. \"No, I don't know what the darn thing is,\" he admitted. \"And I don't care. But I know that someone, or some bunch of someones--outsiders--are trying to horn in. I might even go so far as to say that I suspect the power monopoly gentlemen. I think they have started in on us, plan to run off our men, interfere in every way and drive me out of the field with the boring a failure. Smithy, I begin to think I'm going to enjoy this job!\"  Again the hot wind, only beginning to cool with the setting of the sun, swept around the building where they stood and tore at the hill of sand. \"Come on,\" said Rawson. \"It's getting dark. We'll get up to our lookout--\"  \"Hold on!\" called Smithy sharply.  Rawson turned. Smithy was rubbing his eyes when the whirl of wind-borne sand had passed; he was staring at the sand dunes.  \"I'm seeing things, I guess,\" he said. \"I thought for a minute there was a hole there, and the sand was slipping. I'm getting as bad as Riley.\"  The two went back through the gathering shadows to their waiting car. And Smithy's involuntary shiver told Rawson that he was not the only one to feel a sense of relief at the sound of the exhaust as their car took them away from the dead bones of a dead city in a barren, trackless waste.         *       *       *       *       *  The shoulder of rock, where the mountain road swung out, gave a comprehensive view of camp and desert and the encircling mountains. Above in a vault of black was the dazzling array of stars as the desert lands know them; so low they were, the ragged, broken tops of the three ancient craters seemed touching the warm velvet of the sky on which the stars were hung. Beyond their smooth slopes a spreading glow gave promise of the rising moon.  Rawson headed the car downgrade in readiness for a quick return; he ran it close to the inner wall of rock out of which the road had been carved, then seated himself on the outer rim without thought of the thousand-foot sheer drop beneath his dangling legs. With a glass he was sweeping the foreground where the scattered lights of the camp were like vagrant reflections of the stars thrown back to them from the dead sea of sand.  \"Riley's on the job,\" he told Smithy when he passed over the glass later on. \"And I've got my pocket portable.\" He took the little radio receiver from his pocket as he spoke. \"Riley will signal me from my office if he sees anything.\"  The moon had cleared the mountains; its flood of light poured across their rugged heights and filled the bowl of Tonah Basin as some master of a great theatrical switchboard might have flooded a dark stage with magic illumination, half concealing, transforming whatever things it touched.  All the hard brilliance of sunlit sands was gone. The rolling dunes were softly mellow; the more distant mountains were dream-peaks. Half real, they seemed, and half imagined in a veil of haze. Even the buildings, the scattered piles of material, the gaunt skeleton of the derrick--their stark blackness of outline and clear-cut shadow were gone; the whole land was drenched in the mystery and magic of a desert moon.         *       *       *       *       *  Rawson and the man beside him were silent. Even a mind perplexed by unanswerable problems must pause before the witchery of nature's softer moods.  \"If Riley were here,\" said Smithy softly at last, \"he wouldn't be seeing any devils. Fairies, pixies, the 'little people'--he'd be seeing them dancing.\"  Rawson shot his"]]]
