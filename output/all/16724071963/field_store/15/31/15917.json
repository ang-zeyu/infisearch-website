No, Mr. Hackett and Secret Service will have to get the truth out of the girl by some other means. At any rate, it is out of our hands.”  Larry came to his feet. “Well, then, I’ll resume my vacation, eh?”  His chief took up a report from his desk an frowned at it, his attention already passing to other matters. He grunted, “Clear it with LaVerne, please. Tell her I said to take another week to make up for our intruding on you in this manner.”                    -------------------------------------  In the back of his head, Larry Woolford had misgivings. For one thing, where had the kid, who on the face of her performance was no great brain even as sixteen or seventeen old’s go, picked up such ideas as the fact that people developed prejudices against words like revolution and propaganda?  However, he was clear of it now. Let Steve Hackett and his people take over. He, Lawrence Woolford, was due for a quick return to Astor, Florida and the bass fishing on the St. John’s River.  He stopped at LaVerne’s desk and gave her his address to be, now that his vacation was resumed.  She said, smiling up at him. “Right. The boss already told me to get in touch with Secret Service and let them know we’re pulling out. What happened to Susan Self?”  Larry looked at her. “How’d you know about Susan?”  Her tone was deprecating. “Remember? You had me cut some tapes on you and that hulking Steve Hackett grilling the poor kid.”  Larry snorted. “Poor kid, yet. With her tastes for living-it-up, and that father she has, she’ll probably spend the rest of her life getting in Steve’s hair as a counterfeit pusher.”  “What are they going to do with her? She’s just a child.”  The agent shrugged. “I feel sorry for her, too, LaVerne. Steve’s got her in a suite at the Greater Washington Hilton, until things are cleared up. They don’t want the newspapers to get wind of this until they’ve got that inventor father of hers and whatever he’s cooked up to turn out perfect reproductions of Uncle Sam’s money. Look, I won’t be leaving until tomorrow. What’d you say we go out on the town tonight?”  “Why, Larry Woolford! How nice of you to ask me. Poor Little, Non-U me. What do you have in mind? I understand Mort Lenny’s at one of the night clubs.”  Larry winced. “You know what he’s been saying about the administration.”  She smiled sweetly at him.  Larry said, “Look, we could take in the Brahms concert, then—”  “Do you like Brahms? I go for popular music myself. Preferably the sort of thing they wrote back in the 1930s. Something you can dance to, something you know the words to. Corny, they used to call it. Remember ‘Sunny Side of the Street,’ and ‘Just the Way You Look Tonight’.”  Larry winced again. He said, “Look, I admit, I don’t go for concerts either but it doesn’t hurt you to—”  “I know,” she said sweetly. “It doesn’t hurt for a bright young bureaucrat to be seen at concerts.”  “How about Dixieland?” he said. “It’s all the thing now.”  “I like corn. Besides, my wardrobe is all out of style. Paris, London, and Rome just got in a huddle a couple of weeks ago and antiquated everything I own. You wouldn’t want to be seen with a girl a few weeks out of date, would you?”  “Oh, now, LaVerne, get off my back.” He thought about it. “Look, you must have _something_ you could wear.”  “Get out of here, you vacant minded conformist! I _like_ Mort Lenny, he makes me laugh; I _hate_ vodka martinis, they give me sour stomach; I don’t _like_ the current women’s styles, nor the men’s either.” LaVerne spun back to her auto-typer and began to dictate into it.  Larry glared down at her. “All right. O.K. What _do_ you like?”  She snapped back irrationally, “I like what _I_ like.”  He laughed at her in ridicule.  This time she glared at him. “That makes more sense than you’re capable of assimilating, Mr. Walking Status Symbol. My likes and dislikes aren’t dictated by someone else. If I like corny music, I’ll listen to it and the devil with Brahms or Dixieland or anything else that somebody else tells me is all the thing!”  He turned on his heel angrily. “O.K., O.K., it takes all sorts to make a world, weirds and all.”  “One more label to hang on people,” she snarled after him. “Everything’s labels. Be sure and never come to any judgments of your own!”  What a woman! He wondered why he’d ever bothered to ask her for a date. There were so many women in this town you waded through them, and here he was exposing himself to be seen in public with a girl everybody in the department knew was as weird as they came. It didn’t do your standing any good to be seen around with the type. He wondered all over again why the Boss tolerated her as his receptionist-secretary.  He got his car from the parking lot and drove home at a high level. Ordinarily, the distance being what it was, he drove in the lower and slower traffic levels but now his frustration demanded some expression.                    -------------------------------------  Back at his suburban auto-bungalow, he threw all except the high priority switch and went on down into his small second cellar den. He didn’t really feel like a night on the town anyway. A few vodka martinis under his belt and he’d sleep late and he wanted to get up in time for an early start for Florida. Besides, in that respect he agreed with the irritating wench. Vermouth was never meant to mix with Polish vodka. He wished that Sidecars would come back.  In his den, he shucked off his jacket, kicked off his shoes and shuffled into Moroccan slippers. He went over to his current reading rack and scowled at the paperbacks there. His culture status books were upstairs where they could be seen. He pulled out a western, tossed it over to the cocktail table that sat next to his chair, and then went over to the bar.  Up above in his living room, he had one of the new autobars. You could dial any one of more than thirty drinks. Autobars were all the rage. The Boss had one that gave a selection of a hundred. But what difference did it make when nobody but eccentric old-timers or flighty blondes drank anything except vodka martinis? He didn’t like autobars anyway. A well mixed drink is a personal thing, a work of competence, instinct and art, not something measured to the drop, iced to the degree, shaken or stirred to a mathematical formula.  Out of the tiny refrigerator he brought a four-ounce cube of frozen pineapple juice, touched the edge with his thumbnail and let the ultra thin plastic peel away. He tossed the cube into his mixer, took up a bottle of light rum and poured in about two ounces. He brought an egg from the refrigerator and added that. An ounce of whole milk followed and a teaspoon of powdered sugar. He flicked the switch and let the conglomeration froth together.  He poured it into a king-size highball glass and took it over to his chair. Vodka martinis be damned, he liked a slightly sweet long drink.  He sat down in the chair, picked up the book and scowled at the cover. He ought to be reading that Florentine history of Machiavelli’s, especially if the Boss had got to the point where he was quoting from the guy. But the heck with it, he was on vacation. He didn’t think much of the Italian diplomat of the Renaissance anyway; how could you be that far back without being dated?  He couldn’t get beyond the first page or two.  And when you can’t concentrate on a Western, you just can’t concentrate.  He finished his drink, went over to his phone and dialed _Department of Records_ and then _Information_. When the bright young thing answered, he said, “I’d like the brief on an Ernest Self who lives on Elwood Avenue, Baltimore section of Greater Washington. I don’t know his code number.”  She did things with switches and buttons for a moment and then brought a sheet from a delivery chute. “Do you want me to read it to you, sir?”  “No, I’ll scan it,” Larry said.  Her face faded to be replaced by the brief on Ernest Self.  It was astonishingly short. _Records_ seemed to have slipped up on this occasion. A rare occurrence. He considered requesting the full dossier, then changed his mind. Instead he dialed the number of the _Sun-Post_ and asked for its science columnist.  Sam Sokolski’s puffy face eventually faded in.  Larry said to him sourly, “You drink too much. You can begin to see the veins breaking in your nose.”  Sam looked at him patiently.  Larry said, “How’d you like to come over and toss back a few tonight?”  “I’m working. I thought you were on vacation.”  Larry sighed. “I am,” he said. “O.K., so you can’t take a night off and lift a few with an old buddy.”  “That’s right. Anything else, Larry?”  “Yes. Look, have you ever heard of an inventor named Ernest Self?”  “Sure I’ve heard of him. Covered a hassle he got into some years ago. A nice guy.”  “I’ll bet,” Larry said. “What does he invent, something to do with printing presses, or something?”  “Printing presses? Don’t you remember the story about him?”  “Brief me,” Larry said.  “Well—briefly does it—it got out a couple of years ago that some of our rocketeers had bought a solid fuel formula from an Italian research outfit for the star probe project. Paid them a big hunk of Uncle’s change for it. So Self sued.”  Larry said, “You’re being _too_ brief. What d’ya mean, he sued? Why?”  “Because he claimed he’d submitted the same formula to the same agency a full eighteen months earlier and they’d turned him down.”  “Had he?”  “Probably.”  Larry didn’t get it. “Then why’d they turn him down?”  Sam said, “Oh, the government boys had a good alibi. Crackpots turn up all over the place and you have to brush them off. Every cellar scientist who comes along and says he’s got a new super-fuel developed from old coffee grounds can’t be given the welcome mat. Something was wrong with his math or something and they didn’t pay much attention to him. Wouldn’t even let him demonstrate it. But it was the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30339"],["title","Status Quo (#5)"],["body"," formula, all right.”  Larry Woolford was scowling. “Something wrong with his math? What kind of a degree does he have?”  Sam grinned in memory. “I got a good quote on that. He doesn’t have any degree. He said he’d learned to read by the time he’d reached high school and since then he figured spending time in classrooms was a matter of interfering with his education.”  “No wonder they turned him down. No degree at all. You can’t get anywhere in science like that.”  Sam said, “The courts rejected his suit but he got a certain amount of support here and there. Peter Voss, over at the university, claims he’s one of the great intuitive scientists, whatever that is, of our generation.”  “Who said that?”  “Professor Voss. Not that it makes any difference what he says. Another crackpot.”  After Sam’s less than handsome face was gone from the phone, Larry walked over to the bar with his empty glass and stared at the mixer for several minutes. He began to make himself another flip, but cut it short in the middle, put down the ingredients and went back to the phone to dial _Records_ again.  He went through first the brief and then the full dossier on Professor Peter Luther Voss. Aside from his academic accomplishments, particularly in the fields of political economy and international law, and the dozen or so books accredited to him, there wasn’t anything particularly noteworthy. A bachelor in his fifties. No criminal record of any kind, of course, and no military career. No known political affiliations. Evidently a strong predilection for Thorstein Veblen’s theories. And he’d been a friend of Henry Mencken back when that old nonconformist was tearing down contemporary society seemingly largely for the fun involved in the tearing.  On the face of it, the man was no radical, and the term “crackpot” which Sam had applied was hardly called for.  Larry Woolford went back to the bar and resumed the job of mixing his own version of a rum flip.  But his heart wasn’t in it. _The Professor_, Susan had said.                    -------------------------------------  Before he’d gone to bed the night before, Larry Woolford had ordered a seat on the shuttle jet for Jacksonville and a hover-cab there to take him to Astor, on the St. Johns River. And he’d requested to be wakened in ample time to get to the shuttleport.  But it wasn’t the saccharine pleasant face of the Personal Service operator which confronted him when he grumpily answered the phone in the morning. In fact, the screen remained blank.  Larry decided that sweet long drinks were fine, but that anyone who took several of them in a row needed to be candied. He grumbled into the phone, “All right, who is it?”  A Teutonic voice chuckled and said, “You’re going to have to decide whether or not you’re on vacation, my friend. At this time of day, why aren’t you at work?”  Larry Woolford was waking up. He said, “What can I do for you, Distelmayer?” The German merchant-of-espionage wasn’t the type to make personal calls.  “Have you forgotten so soon, my friend?” the other chuckled. “It was I who was going to do you a favor.” He hesitated momentarily, before adding, “In possible return for future—”  “Yeah, yeah,” Larry said. He was fully awake now.  The German said slowly, “You asked if any of your friends from, ah, abroad were newly in the country. Frol Eivazov has recently appeared on the scene.”  Eivazov! In various respects, Larry Woolford’s counterpart. Hatchetman for the _Chrezvychainaya Komissiya_. Woolford had met him on occasion when they’d both been present at international summit meetings, busily working at counter-espionage for their respective superiors. Blandly shaking hands with each other, blandly drinking toasts to peace and international co-existence, blandly sizing each other up and wondering if it’d ever come to the point where one would _blandly_ treat the other to a hole in the head, possibly in some dark alley in Havana or Singapore, Leopoldville or Saigon.  Larry said sharply, “Where is he? How’d he get in the country?”  “My friend, my friend,” the German grunted good-humoredly. “You know better than to ask the first question. As for the second, Frol’s command of American-English is at least as good as your own. Do you think his _Komissiya_ less capable than your own department and unable to do him up suitable papers so that he could be, perhaps, a ‘returning tourist’ from Europe?”  Larry Woolford was impatient with himself for asking. He said now, “It’s not important. If we want to locate Frol and pick him up, we’ll probably not have too much trouble doing it.”  “I wouldn’t think so,” the other said humorously. “Since 1919, when they were first organized, the so-called Communists in this country, from the lowest to the highest echelons, have been so riddled with police agents that a federal judge in New England once refused to prosecute a case against them on the grounds that the party was a United States government agency.”  Larry was in no frame of mind for the other’s heavy humor. “Look, Hans,” he said, “what I want to know is what Frol is over here for.”  “Of course you do,” Hans Distelmayer said, unable evidently to keep note of puzzlement from his voice. “Larry,” he said, “I assume your people know of the new American underground.”  “_What_ underground?” Larry snapped.  The professional spy chief said, his voice strange, “The Soviets seem to have picked up an idea somewhere, possibly through their membership in this country, that something is abrewing in the States. That a change is being engineered.”  Larry stared at the blank phone screen.  “What kind of a change?” he said finally. “You mean a change to the Soviet system?” Surely not even the self-deluding Russkies could think it possible to overthrow the American socio-economic system in favor of the Soviet brand.  “No, no, no,” the German chuckled. “Of course not. It’s not of their working at all.”  “Then what’s Frol Eivazov’s interest, if they aren’t engineering it?”  Distelmayer rumbled his characteristic chuckle with humor. “My dear friend, don’t be naive. Anything that happens in America is of interest to the Soviets. There is delicate peace between you now that they have changed their direction and are occupying themselves largely with the economic and agricultural development of Asia and such portions of the world as have come under their hegemony, and while you put all efforts into modernizing the more backward countries among your satellites.”  Larry said automatically, “Our allies aren’t satellites.”  The spy-master went on without contesting the statement. “There is immediate peace but surely governmental officials on both sides keep careful watch on the internal developments of the other. True, the current heads of the Soviet Complex would like to see the governments of all the Western powers changed—but only if they are changed in the direction of communism. They are hardly interested in seeing changes made which would strengthen the West in the, ah, Battle For Men’s Minds.”  Larry snorted his disgust. “What sort of change in government would strengthen the United States in—”  The German interrupted smoothly, “Evidently, that’s what Frol seems to be here for, Larry. To find out more about this movement and—”  “This _what_?” Larry blurted.  “The term seems to be _movement_.”  Larry Woolford held a long silence before saying, “And Frol is actually here in this country to buck this ... this movement.”  “Not necessarily,” the other said impatiently. “He is here to find out more about it. Evidently Peking and Moscow have heard just enough to make them nervous.”  Larry said, “You have anything more, Hans?”  “I’m afraid that’s about it.”  “All right,” Larry said. He added absently, “Thanks, Hans.”  “Thank me some day with deeds, not with words,” the German chuckled.                    -------------------------------------  Larry Woolford looked at his watch and grimaced. He was either going to get going now or forget about doing any fishing in Florida this afternoon.  Grudgingly, he dialed the phone company’s Personal Service and said to the impossibly cheerful blonde who answered, “Where can I find Professor Peter Voss who teaches over at the University in Baltimore? I don’t want to talk with him, just want to know where he’ll be an hour from now.”  While waiting for his information, he dressed, deciding inwardly that he hated his job, the department in which he was employed, the Boss and Greater Washington. On top of that, he hated himself. He’d already been taken off this assignment, why couldn’t he leave it lay?  The blonde rang him back. Professor Peter Voss was at home. He had no classes today. She gave him the address.  Larry Woolford raised his car from his auto-bungalow in the Brandywine suburb and headed northwest at a high level for the old Baltimore section of the city.  The Professor’s house, he noted, was of an earlier day and located on the opposite side of Paterson Park from Elwood avenue, the street on which Susan Self and her father had resided. That didn’t necessarily hold significance, the park was a large one and the Professor’s section a well-to-do neighborhood, while Self’s was just short of a slum these days.  He brought his car down to street level, and parked before the scholar’s three-story, brick house. Baltimore-like, it was identical to every other house in the block; Larry wondered vaguely how anybody ever managed to find his own place when it was very dark out.  There was an old-fashioned bell at the side of the entrance and Larry Woolford pushed it. There was no identification screen in the door, evidently the inhabitants had to open up to see who was calling, a tiring chore if you were on the far side of the house and the caller nothing more than a salesman.  It was obviously the Professor himself who answered.  He was in shirtsleeves, tieless and with age-old slippers on his stockingless feet. He evidently hadn’t bothered to shave this morning and he held "]]]
