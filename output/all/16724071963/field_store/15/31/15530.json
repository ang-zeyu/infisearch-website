Service to the customer is our job and we know it well.\"  Carrin wavered visibly.  \"And after you're gone, sir, they'll all belong to your son.\"  That was true, Carrin thought. His son would have all the marvelous things that filled the house. And after all, it was only thirty years out of a life expectancy of a hundred and fifty.  He signed with a flourish.  \"Excellent!\" Pathis said. \"And by the way, has your home got an A. E. Master-operator?\"  It hadn't. Pathis explained that a Master-operator was new this year, a stupendous advance in scientific engineering. It was designed to take over all the functions of housecleaning and cooking, without its owner having to lift a finger.  \"Instead of running around all day, pushing half a dozen different buttons, with the Master-operator all you have to do is push _one_! A remarkable achievement!\"  Since it was only five hundred and thirty-five dollars, Carrin signed for one, having it added to his son's debt.  Right's right, he thought, walking Pathis to the door. This house will be Billy's some day. His and his wife's. They certainly will want everything up-to-date.  Just one button, he thought. That _would_ be a time-saver!         *       *       *       *       *  After Pathis left, Carrin sat back in an adjustable chair and turned on the solido. After twisting the Ezi-dial, he discovered that there was nothing he wanted to see. He tilted back the chair and took a nap.  The something on his mind was still bothering him.  \"Hello, darling!\" He awoke to find his wife was home. She kissed him on the ear. \"Look.\"  She had bought an A. E. Sexitizer-negligee. He was pleasantly surprised that that was all she had bought. Usually, Leela returned from shopping laden down.  \"It's lovely,\" he said.  She bent over for a kiss, then giggled--a habit he knew she had picked up from the latest popular solido star. He wished she hadn't.  \"Going to dial supper,\" she said, and went to the kitchen. Carrin smiled, thinking that soon she would be able to dial the meals without moving out of the living room. He settled back in his chair, and his son walked in.  \"How's it going, Son?\" he asked heartily.  \"All right,\" Billy answered listlessly.  \"What'sa matter, Son?\" The boy stared at his feet, not answering. \"Come on, tell Dad what's the trouble.\"  Billy sat down on a packing case and put his chin in his hands. He looked thoughtfully at his father.  \"Dad, could I be a Master Repairman if I wanted to be?\"  Mr. Carrin smiled at the question. Billy alternated between wanting to be a Master Repairman and a rocket pilot. The repairmen were the elite. It was their job to fix the automatic repair machines. The repair machines could fix just about anything, but you couldn't have a machine fix the machine that fixed the machine. That was where the Master Repairmen came in.  But it was a highly competitive field and only a very few of the best brains were able to get their degrees. And, although the boy was bright, he didn't seem to have an engineering bent.  \"It's possible, Son. Anything is possible.\"  \"But is it possible for me?\"  \"I don't know,\" Carrin answered, as honestly as he could.  \"Well, I don't want to be a Master Repairman anyway,\" the boy said, seeing that the answer was no. \"I want to be a space pilot.\"  \"A space pilot, Billy?\" Leela asked, coming in to the room. \"But there aren't any.\"  \"Yes, there are,\" Billy argued. \"We were told in school that the government is going to send some men to Mars.\"  \"They've been saying that for a hundred years,\" Carrin said, \"and they still haven't gotten around to doing it.\"  \"They will this time.\"  \"Why would you want to go to Mars?\" Leela asked, winking at Carrin. \"There are no pretty girls on Mars.\"  \"I'm not interested in girls. I just want to go to Mars.\"  \"You wouldn't like it, honey,\" Leela said. \"It's a nasty old place with no air.\"  \"It's got some air. I'd like to go there,\" the boy insisted sullenly. \"I don't like it here.\"  \"What's that?\" Carrin asked, sitting up straight. \"Is there anything you haven't got? Anything you want?\"  \"No, sir. I've got everything I want.\" Whenever his son called him 'sir,' Carrin knew that something was wrong.  \"Look, Son, when I was your age I wanted to go to Mars, too. I wanted to do romantic things. I even wanted to be a Master Repairman.\"  \"Then why didn't you?\"  \"Well, I grew up. I realized that there were more important things. First I had to pay off the debt my father had left me, and then I met your mother--\"  Leela giggled.  \"--and I wanted a home of my own. It'll be the same with you. You'll pay off your debt and get married, the same as the rest of us.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Billy was silent for a while, then he brushed his dark hair--straight, like his father's--back from his forehead and wet his lips.  \"How come I have debts, sir?\"  Carrin explained carefully. About the things a family needed for civilized living, and the cost of those items. How they had to be paid. How it was customary for a son to take on a part of his parent's debt, when he came of age.  Billy's silence annoyed him. It was almost as if the boy were reproaching him. After he had slaved for years to give the ungrateful whelp every luxury!  \"Son,\" he said harshly, \"have you studied history in school? Good. Then you know how it was in the past. Wars. How would you like to get blown up in a war?\"  The boy didn't answer.  \"Or how would you like to break your back for eight hours a day, doing work a machine should handle? Or be hungry all the time? Or cold, with the rain beating down on you, and no place to sleep?\"  He paused for a response, got none and went on. \"You live in the most fortunate age mankind has ever known. You are surrounded by every wonder of art and science. The finest music, the greatest books and art, all at your fingertips. All you have to do is push a button.\" He shifted to a kindlier tone. \"Well, what are you thinking?\"  \"I was just wondering how I could go to Mars,\" the boy said. \"With the debt, I mean. I don't suppose I could get away from that.\"  \"Of course not.\"  \"Unless I stowed away on a rocket.\"  \"But you wouldn't do that.\"  \"No, of course not,\" the boy said, but his tone lacked conviction.  \"You'll stay here and marry a very nice girl,\" Leela told him.  \"Sure I will,\" Billy said. \"Sure.\" He grinned suddenly. \"I didn't mean any of that stuff about going to Mars. I really didn't.\"  \"I'm glad of that,\" Leela answered.  \"Just forget I mentioned it,\" Billy said, smiling stiffly. He stood up and raced upstairs.  \"Probably gone to play with his rockets,\" Leela said. \"He's such a little devil.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Carrins ate a quiet supper, and then it was time for Mr. Carrin to go to work. He was on night shift this month. He kissed his wife good-by, climbed into his Jet-lash and roared to the factory. The automatic gates recognized him and opened. He parked and walked in.  Automatic lathes, automatic presses--everything was automatic. The factory was huge and bright, and the machines hummed softly to themselves, doing their job and doing it well.  Carrin walked to the end of the automatic washing machine assembly line, to relieve the man there.  \"Everything all right?\" he asked.  \"Sure,\" the man said. \"Haven't had a bad one all year. These new models here have built-in voices. They don't light up like the old ones.\"  Carrin sat down where the man had sat and waited for the first washing machine to come through. His job was the soul of simplicity. He just sat there and the machines went by him. He pressed a button on them and found out if they were all right. They always were. After passing him, the washing machines went to the packaging section.  The first one slid by on the long slide of rollers. He pressed the starting button on the side.  \"Ready for the wash,\" the washing machine said.  Carrin pressed the release and let it go by.  That boy of his, Carrin thought. Would he grow up and face his responsibilities? Would he mature and take his place in society? Carrin doubted it. The boy was a born rebel. If anyone got to Mars, it would be his kid.  But the thought didn't especially disturb him.  \"Ready for the wash.\" Another machine went by.  Carrin remembered something about Miller. The jovial man had always been talking about the planets, always kidding about going off somewhere and roughing it. He hadn't, though. He'd committed suicide.  \"Ready for the wash.\"  Carrin had eight hours in front of him, and he loosened his belt to prepare for it. Eight hours of pushing buttons and listening to a machine announce its readiness.  \"Ready for the wash.\"  He pressed the release.  \"Ready for the wash.\"  Carrin's mind strayed from the job, which didn't need much attention in any case. He wished he had done what he had longed to do as a youngster.  It would have been great to be a rocket pilot, to push a button and go to Mars.                                                       --ROBERT SHECKLEY     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ December 1952.

True, the Robot Equality     Act had been passed--but so what?_       the  velvet   glove   _by ... Harry Harrison_    New York was a bad town for robots this year. In fact,  all over the country it was bad for robots....   Jon Venex fitted the key into the hotel room door. He had asked for a large room, the largest in the hotel, and paid the desk clerk extra for it. All he could do now was pray that he hadn't been cheated. He didn't dare complain or try to get his money back. He heaved a sigh of relief as the door swung open, it was bigger than he had expected--fully three feet wide by five feet long. There was more than enough room to work in. He would have his leg off in a jiffy and by morning his limp would be gone.  There was the usual adjustable hook on the back wall. He slipped it through the recessed ring in the back of his neck and kicked himself up until his feet hung free of the floor. His legs relaxed with a rattle as he cut off all power from his waist down.  The overworked leg motor would have to cool down before he could work on it, plenty of time to skim through the newspaper. With the chronic worry of the unemployed, he snapped it open at the want-ads and ran his eye down the _Help Wanted--Robot_ column. There was nothing for him under the Specialist heading, even the Unskilled Labor listings were bare and unpromising. New York was a bad town for robots this year.  The want-ads were just as depressing as usual but he could always get a lift from the comic section. He even had a favorite strip, a fact that he scarcely dared mention to himself. \"Rattly Robot,\" a dull-witted mechanical clod who was continually falling over himself and getting into trouble. It was a repellent caricature, but could still be very funny. Jon was just starting to read it when the ceiling light went out.  It was ten P.M., curfew hour for robots. Lights out and lock yourself in until six in the morning, eight hours of boredom and darkness for all except the few night workers. But there were ways of getting around the letter of a law that didn't concern itself with a definition of visible light. Sliding aside some of the shielding around his atomic generator, Jon turned up the gain. As it began to run a little hot the heat waves streamed out--visible to him as infra-red rays. He finished reading the paper in the warm, clear light of his abdomen.  The thermocouple in the tip of his second finger left hand, he tested the temperature of his leg. It was soon cool enough to work on. The waterproof gasket stripped off easily, exposing the power leads, nerve wires and the weakened knee joint. The wires disconnected, Jon unscrewed the knee above the joint and carefully placed it on the shelf in front of him. With loving care he took the replacement part from his hip pouch. It was the product of toil, purchased with his savings from three months employment on the Jersey pig farm.  Jon was standing on one leg testing the new knee joint when the ceiling fluorescent flickered and came back on. Five-thirty already, he had just finished in time. A shot of oil on the new bearing completed the job; he stowed away the tools in the pouch and unlocked the door.  The unused elevator shaft acted as waste chute, he slipped his newspaper through a slot in the door as he went by. Keeping close to the wall, he picked his way carefully down the grease-stained stairs. He slowed his pace at the 17th floor as two other mechs turned in ahead of him. They were obviously butchers or meat-cutters; where the right hand should have been on each of them there stuck out a wicked, foot-long knife. As they approached the foot of the stairs they stopped to slip the knives into the plastic sheaths that were bolted to their chestplates. Jon followed them down the ramp into the lobby.  The room was filled to capacity with robots of all sizes, forms and colors. Jon Venex's greater height enabled him to see over their heads to the glass doors that opened onto the street. It had rained the night before and the rising sun drove red glints from the puddles on the sidewalk. Three robots, painted snow white to show they were night workers, pushed the doors open and came in. No one went out as the curfew hadn't ended yet. They milled around slowly talking in low voices.  The only human being in the entire lobby was the night clerk dozing behind the counter. The clock over his head said five minutes to six. Shifting his glance from the clock, Jon became aware of a squat black robot waving to attract his attention. The powerful arms and compact build identified him as a member of the Diger family, one of the most numerous groups. He pushed through the crowd and clapped Jon on the back with a resounding clang.  \"Jon Venex! I knew it was you as soon as I saw you sticking up out of this crowd like a green tree trunk. I haven't seen you since the old days on Venus!\"  Jon didn't need to check the number stamped on the short one's scratched chestplate. Alec Diger had been his only close friend during those thirteen boring years at Orange Sea Camp. A good chess player and a whiz at Two-handed Handball, they had spent all their off time together. They shook hands, with the extra squeeze that means friendliness.  \"Alec, you beat-up little grease pot, what brings you to New York?\"  \"The burning desire to see something besides rain and jungle, if you must know. After you bought out, things got just too damn dull. I began working two shifts a day in that foul diamond mine, and then three a day for the last month to get enough credits to buy my contract and passage back to earth. I was underground so long that the photocell on my right eye burned out when the sunlight hit it.\"  He leaned forward with a hoarse confidential whisper, \"If you want to know the truth, I had a sixty-carat diamond stuck behind the eye lens. I sold it here on earth for two hundred credits, gave me six months of easy living. It's all gone now, so I'm on my way to the employment exchange.\" His voice boomed loud again, \"And how about _you_?\"  Jon Venex chuckled at his friend's frank approach to life. \"It's just been the old routine with me, a run of odd jobs until I got side-swiped by a bus--it fractured my knee bearing. The only job I could get with a bad leg was feeding slops to pigs. Earned enough to fix the knee--and here _I_ am.\"  Alec jerked his thumb at a rust-colored, three-foot-tall robot that had come up quietly beside him. \"If you think you've got trouble take a look at Dik here, that's no coat of paint on him. Dik Dryer, meet Jon Venex an old buddy of mine.\"  Jon bent over to shake the little mech's hand. His eye shutters dilated as he realized what he had thought was a coat of paint was a thin layer of rust that coated Dik's metal body. Alec scratched a shiny path in the rust with his fingertip. His voice was suddenly serious.  \"Dik was designed for operation in the Martian desert. It's as dry as a fossil bone there so his skinflint company cut corners on the stainless steel.  \"When they went bankrupt he was sold to a firm here in the city. After a while the rust started to eat in and slow him down, they gave Dik his contract and threw him out.\"  The small robot spoke for the first time, his voice grated and scratched. \"Nobody will hire me like this, but I can't get repaired until I get a job.\" His arms squeaked and grated as he moved them. \"I'm going by the Robot Free Clinic again today, they said they might be able to do something.\"  Alec Diger rumbled in his deep chest. \"Don't put too much faith in those people. They're great at giving out tenth-credit oil capsules or a little free wire--but don't depend on them for anything important.\"  It was six now, the robots were pushing through the doors into the silent streets. They joined the crowd moving out, Jon slowing his stride so his shorter friends could keep pace. Dik Dryer moved with a jerking, irregular motion, his voice as uneven as the motion of his body.  \"Jon--Venex, I don't recognize your family name. Something to do--with Venus--perhaps.\"  \"Venus is right, Venus Experimental--there are only twenty-two of us in the family. We have waterproof, pressure-resistant bodies for working down on the ocean bottom. The basic idea was all right, we did our part, only there wasn't enough money in the channel-dredging contract to keep us all working. I bought out my original contract at half price and became a free robot.\"  Dik vibrated his rusted diaphragm. \"Being free isn't all it should be. I some--times wish the Robot Equality Act hadn't been passed. I would just l-love to be owned by a nice rich company with a machine shop and a--mountain of replacement parts.\"  \"You don't really mean that, Dik,\" Alec Diger clamped a heavy black arm across his shoulders. \"Things aren't perfect now, we know that, but it's certainly a lot better than the old days, we were just hunks of machinery then. Used twenty-four hours a day until we were worn out and then thrown in the junk pile. No thanks, I'll take my chances with things as they are.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jon and Alec turned into the employment exchange, saying good-by to Dik who went on slowly down the street. They pushed up the crowded ramp and joined the line in front of the registration desk. The bulletin board next to the desk held a scattering of white slips announcing job openings. A clerk was pinning up new additions.  Venex scanned them with his eyes, stopping at one circled in red.      ROBOTS NEEDED IN THESE CATEGORIES.
