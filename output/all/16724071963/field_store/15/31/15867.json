But fools won't, and men are mostly fools, you know. When did you get to Cairo?\"  \"About five minutes before you saw me putting out the fire. I came down the river on the big tow boat.\"  \"Where's your baggage?\"  \"On my back. I have no other clothes. I'll buy some when I earn some money.\"  \"Where have you been since the surrender?\"  \"Making my way West.\"  \"How?\"  \"On foot to Wheeling. Then on the tow boat.\"  \"What fare did they make you pay?\"  \"None. I worked my way as a stoker--fireman they call it out here.\"  \"No wages? Just passage and grub?\"  \"That was all.\"  \"What have you got on your wheel house?\"  \"I fear I don't understand.\"  \"Oh, that's river slang. You know every side-wheel steamer has a statement of her destination painted on her wheel house. I meant to ask what are your plans?\"  \"To find work and do it.\"  \"What kind of work?\"  \"Any kind that's honest.\"  \"You are educated, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, in a way. I'm an A. M. and a graduate in law.\"  \"Know anything about business?\"  \"No, but I shall learn.\"  \"If you can, you mean?\"  \"Oh, I can. A capable man can learn anything if he really wants to.\"  \"I don't know about that. But I'll gamble on the proposition that you can.\"  \"Thank you.\"  \"No thanks are needed. I wasn't complimenting. I was just expressing an opinion.\"  Scribbling a memorandum on a scrap of paper, Captain Hallam handed it to Duncan, saying:  \"Give that to the cashier as you go out, and get your wages. Then you'd better get your breakfast. I recommend you, while you're poor, to eat at the little booths along the levee, where they sell very good sandwiches and coffee cheap. After breakfast, if you choose to come back here I'll try to find something for you to do. Oh, I forgot. You were up all night, so you'll want to sleep.\"  There was an interrogative note in the last sentence. Captain Hallam was \"sizing up\" his man, and he closely scrutinized Duncan's face as the answer came.  \"Oh, I'm used to night duty. I'm ready for a day's work if you can give me one. As for breakfast, I've had it.\"  \"Then you had money?\"  \"A very little; but I didn't spend any of it. I sawed and split a load of wood for the keeper of a booth, and he gave me some bread and ham and coffee for my work.\"  \"Oh, that's the way you managed it. Very well. Come back here in two hours anyhow.\"  After the young man had passed out, Captain Hallam said to one of his partner brothers:  \"That fellow is a good sort. He has sand in his gizzard. When he comes back set him at work at something or other--several things in succession in fact--and find out what he can do.\"  Such was Guilford Duncan's mustering into the new service of work.     VIII  ON DUTY   During the next four or five days Guilford Duncan was kept busy with various small employments, some of them out of doors and some of them in the office. During this time Captain Hallam did not again engage him in conversation, but Duncan knew that the man of business was closely observing his work. He was not slow to discover that he was giving satisfaction. He saw that with each day the work assigned him was of a kind that required a higher intelligence than that of the day before.  Every evening the cashier paid him his day's wages, thus reminding him that he was not a salaried employee of the house, but a man working for wages from day to day.  Out of his first wages he had purchased a change of very cheap underwear, a towel, and a cake of soap. Every morning about daylight he went to a secluded spot on the levee, for a scrub and a swim. Then he washed out his towel and placed it with his other small belongings, in a storage place he had discovered in a great lumber pile.  One morning when he entered the office Captain Hallam gave him several business letters to answer from memoranda scribbled upon them by clerks or others. He gave him also a memorandum in his own handwriting, saying:  \"Cut that down if you can and make a telegram of it. I'll be back in half an hour or so. Have it ready for me.\"  The case was this: A huge steamboat lay at the levee, loaded almost to the water's edge with grain which Captain Hallam was more than anxious to hurry to New Orleans to meet a sudden temporary and very marked advance in that market. That morning the boat had been \"tied up\"--as the phrase went--that is to say, she had been legally attached for debt, at the suit of a firm in St. Louis. Until the attachment should be removed the boat must lie at Cairo, in charge of a sheriff's officer. Captain Hallam wished to secure her immediate release, and to that end he purposed sending the telegram.  When he returned to the office Duncan handed him for inspection and signature the letters he had written.  \"Here is the telegram, also,\" he said, \"but, if you will pardon the impertinence, I think you had better not send it--at least in the form you have given it.\"  \"What's the matter?\" quickly snapped Hallam.  \"It binds you to more than I think you intend.\"  \"Go on! Explain!\"  \"Why, I cannot help seeing that if you send this dispatch you will make yourself legally responsible, not only for the claim for which the boat is now attached, but also for every claim against her that may exist anywhere. There may be none such, or there may be many. In any case I do not think you intend to assume them all.\"  \"Go on! The boat must be got away. What do you advise?\"  \"That you go on her bond for this claim--which seems to me so clearly illegal that I think you can never be held upon the bond--and----\"  \"Remind me, when this is over, that you are to come to my house to-night for consultation on that point. Now go on.\"  \"Well, by going on her bond for this claim, instead of asking the creditors to release the boat on your promise as made in the telegram, you can secure her immediate release, making yourself liable, at worst, for no more than the six hundred dollars claimed.\"  \"But if I do that, what is to prevent another tie-up at Memphis and another at Vicksburg and others wherever the boat may happen to land. She's in debt up to the top of her smokestacks, all along the river.\"  \"As you own the cargo, and she can't carry another ton, why should you let her stop at all? I suppose the captain would do as you desire in that matter. You might request him to run through without any landings.\"  \"Request be hanged. I'll tell him what to do and he'll do it. He knows where cargoes come from. Can you get the papers ready?\"  \"I can, sir.\"  \"All right. Do it at once.\" Then turning to a shipping clerk he sent for the captain of the steamer, to whom he said:  \"Get up steam at once. You are to leave in less than an hour. How much coal have you?\"  The captain told him.  \"Take two light barges of coal in tow, one on each side, and draw on them for fuel. When they're empty cast them loose with two men on each to land them. You can pick them up on your return trip. You are to steam to New Orleans without a landing anywhere. You understand?\"  The captain understood. By this time the papers were ready and after half an hour spent in legal formalities the released steamboat cast loose from the wharf and backed out into the river.  Then Captain Hallam turned to Guilford Duncan and said:  \"I've an idea that you'll do. If you like I'll put you at regular work at a monthly salary, and we'll see how we get on together.\"  \"I should like that.\"  \"Very well. Now, where are you boarding?\"  \"Nowhere. I get what I want to eat at the booths down along the levee.\"  \"But where do you sleep?\"  \"Among the big lumber piles down there on Fourth street.\"  Captain Hallam looked at the young man for a moment with something like admiration in his eyes. Presently he said:  \"You'll do. You've got grit and you'll 'make the riffle,' sure. But you must live more regularly, now that you are to have a salary. I know what it means to live as you've been doing. I used to do it myself. I could tell to a cent the nutritive value of a pegged pie or a sewed one, and at a single glance I could guess the probable proportions of the dog and cat in a sausage. That sort of thing's all right for a little while, but not for long, and as for the sleeping among lumber piles, it's risky. I used to sleep in an empty sugar hogshead by preference, but sleeping out of doors may give you rheumatism.\"  \"I've been doing it for four years,\" answered Duncan, smiling, \"and I still have the use of my limbs.\"  \"Yes, of course. I didn't think of that. But you must live better now. There's a well-furnished room above the office. It was my brother's quarters before he got married, and it is very comfortable. You can take it for your own. Give Dutch John, the scrub boy, half a dollar a week to take care of it for you and that's all the rent you need pay. As for your meals, most young men in Cairo feed their faces at the hotel. But that's expensive and what the proprietor calls his 'kuzene' is distinctly bad. There's a lady, however,--Mrs. Deming,--who furnishes very good 'square meals,' I hear, over in Walnut street. You'd better try there, I think. She's what you would call a gentlewoman, but she needs all the money you'll pay her.\"  Duncan wondered a little what a 'square meal' might be, but he was getting somewhat used to the prevalence in the West of those figurative forms of expression which we call slang. So he took it for granted that \"square meals\" were for some reason preferable to meals of any other geometrical form, and answered simply that he would look up Mrs. Deming's house after business hours should be over.  \"Remember,\" said Captain Hallam as he passed out of the office, \"you are to see me at my house to-night. Better come to supper--say at seven--and after supper we'll talk over that law point you mentioned, and other things.\"  Duncan wondered a little that Captain Hallam should give him so intimate an invitation when he knew so little of him. Everybody else in the office understood.

For whom, then, are prefaces written?  When an author publishes a book ‘out of his own head,’ he writes the preface for his own pleasure.  After reading over his book in print--to make sure that all the ‘u’s’ are not printed as ‘n’s,’ and all the ‘n’s’ as ‘u’s’ in the proper names--then the author says, mildly, in his preface, what he thinks about his own book, and what he means it to prove--if he means it to prove anything--and why it is not a better book than it is.  But, perhaps, nobody reads prefaces except other authors; and critics, who hope that they will find enough in the preface to enable them to do without reading any of the book.  This appears to be the philosophy of prefaces in general, and perhaps authors might be more daring and candid than they are with advantage, and write regular criticisms of their own books in their prefaces, for nobody can be so good a critic of himself as the author--if he has a sense of humour.  If he has not, the less he says in his preface the better.  These Fairy Books, however, are not written by the Editor, as he has often explained, ‘out of his own head.’  The stories are taken from those told by grannies to grandchildren in many countries and in many languages-- French, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Gaelic, Icelandic, Cherokee, African, Indian, Australian, Slavonic, Eskimo, and what not. The stories are not literal, or word by word translations, but have been altered in many ways to make them suitable for children.  Much has been left out in places, and the narrative has been broken up into conversations, the characters telling each other how matters stand, and speaking for themselves, as children, and some older people, prefer them to do.  In many tales, fairly cruel and savage deeds are done, and these have been softened down as much as possible; though it is impossible, even if it were desirable, to conceal the circumstance that popular stories were never intended to be tracts and nothing else. Though they usually take the side of courage and kindness, and the virtues in general, the old story-tellers admire successful cunning as much as Homer does in the Odyssey.  At least, if the cunning hero, human or animal, is the weaker, like Odysseus, Brer Rabbit, and many others, the story-teller sees little in intellect but superior cunning, by which tiny Jack gets the better of the giants.  In the fairy tales of no country are ‘improper’ incidents common, which is to the credit of human nature, as they were obviously composed mainly for children. It is not difficult to get rid of this element when it does occur in popular tales.  The old puzzle remains a puzzle--why do the stories of the remotest people so closely resemble each other?  Of course, in the immeasurable past, they have been carried about by conquering races, and learned by conquering races from vanquished peoples.  Slaves carried far from home brought their stories with them into captivity.  Wanderers, travellers, shipwrecked men, merchants, and wives stolen from alien tribes have diffused the stories; gipsies and Jews have passed them about; Roman soldiers of many different races, moved here and there about the Empire, have trafficked in them.  From the remotest days men have been wanderers, and wherever they went their stories accompanied them.  The slave trade might take a Greek to Persia, a Persian to Greece; an Egyptian woman to Phoenicia; a Babylonian to Egypt; a Scandinavian child might be carried with the amber from the Baltic to the Adriatic; or a Sidonian to Ophir, wherever Ophir may have been; while the Portuguese may have borne their tales to South Africa, or to Asia, and thence brought back other tales to Egypt.  The stories wandered wherever the Buddhist missionaries went, and the earliest French voyageurs told them to the Red Indians.  These facts help to account for the sameness of the stories everywhere;  and the uniformity of human fancy in early societies must be the cause of many other resemblances.  In this volume there are stories from the natives of Rhodesia, collected by Mr. Fairbridge, who speaks the native language, and one is brought by Mr. Cripps from another part of Africa, Uganda.  Three tales from the Punjaub were collected and translated by Major Campbell. Various savage tales, which needed a good deal of editing, are derived from the learned pages of the ‘Journal of the Anthropological Institute.’  With these exceptions, and ‘The Magic Book,’ translated by Mrs. Pedersen, from ‘Eventyr fra Jylland,’ by Mr. Ewald Tang Kristensen (Stories from Jutland), all the tales have been done, from various sources, by Mrs. Lang, who has modified, where it seemed desirable, all the narratives.

He was not like other children, for he was very tall and strong; over his shoulder he carried a big sack, and in his hand an iron hammer.  He could also speak like a grown man, but usually he was very silent.  One day his mother said to him: ‘My child, by what name shall we know you?’  And he answered: ‘Call all the head men of Senna here to the river’s bank.’ And his mother called the head men of the town, and when they had come he led them down to a deep black pool in the river where all the fierce crocodiles lived.  ‘O great men!’ he said, while they all listened, ‘which of you will leap into the pool and overcome the crocodiles?’ But no one would come forward.  So he turned and sprang into the water and disappeared.  The people held their breath, for they thought: ‘Surely the boy is bewitched and throws away his life, for the crocodiles will eat him!’ Then suddenly the ground trembled, and the pool, heaving and swirling, became red with blood, and presently the boy rising to the surface swam on shore.  But he was no longer just a boy!  He was stronger than any man and very tall and handsome, so that the people shouted with gladness when they saw him.  ‘Now, O my people!’ he cried, waving his hand, ‘you know my name--I am Makoma, “the Greater”; for have I not slain the crocodiles into the pool where none would venture?’  Then he said to his mother: ‘Rest gently, my mother, for I go to make a home for myself and become a hero.’  Then, entering his hut he took Nu-endo, his iron hammer, and throwing the sack over his shoulder, he went away.  Makoma crossed the Zambesi, and for many moons he wandered towards the north and west until he came to a very hilly country where, one day, he met a huge giant making mountains.  ‘Greeting,’ shouted Makoma, ‘you are you?’  ‘I am Chi-eswa-mapiri, who makes the mountains,’ answered the giant; ‘and who are you?’  ‘I am Makoma, which signifies “greater,”’ answered he.  ‘Greater than who?’ asked the giant.  ‘Greater than you!’ answered Makoma.  The giant gave a roar and rushed upon him.  Makoma said nothing, but swinging his great hammer, Nu-endo, he struck the giant upon the head.  He struck him so hard a blow that the giant shrank into quite a little man, who fell upon his knees saying: ‘You are indeed greater than I, O Makoma; take me with you to be your slave!’  So Makoma picked him up and dropped him into the sack that he carried upon his back.  He was greater than ever now, for all the giant’s strength had gone into him; and he resumed his journey, carrying his burden with as little difficulty as an eagle might carry a hare.  Before long he came to a country broken up with huge stones and immense clods of earth.   Looking over one of the heaps he saw a giant wrapped in dust dragging out the very earth and hurling it in handfuls on either side of him.  ‘Who are you,’ cried Makoma, ‘that pulls up the earth in this way?’  ‘I am Chi-dubula-taka,’ said he, ‘and I am making the river-beds.’  ‘Do you know who I am?’ said Makoma.  ‘I am he that is called “greater”!’  ‘Greater than who?’ thundered the giant.  ‘Greater than you!’ answered Makoma.  With a shout, Chi-dubula-taka seized a great clod of earth and launched it at Makoma.  But the hero had his sack held over his left arm and the stones and earth fell harmlessly upon it, and, tightly gripping his iron hammer, he rushed in and struck the giant to the ground. Chi-dubula-taka grovelled before him, all the while growing smaller and smaller; and when he had become a convenient size Makoma picked him up and put him into the sack beside Chi- eswa-mapiri.  He went on his way even greater than before, as all the river-maker’s power had become his; and at last he came to a forest of bao- babs and thorn trees.  He was astonished at their size, for every one was full grown and larger than any trees he had ever seen, and close by he saw Chi-gwisa-miti, the giant who"]]]
