If the objects which have been described constitute the didactic material for the beginnings of a methodical education of the auditory sense, I have no desire to limit to them an educational process which is so important and already so complex in its practise, whether in the long established methods of treatment for the deaf, or in modern physiological musical education. In fact, I also use resonant metal tubes, small bars of wood which emit musical notes, and strings (little harps), upon which the children seek to recognize the tones they have already learned with the exercise of the bells. The pianoforte may also be used for the same purpose. In this way the difference in _timbre_ comes to be perceived together with the differences in tone. At the same time various exercises, already mentioned, such as the marches played on the piano for rhythmic exercises, and the simple songs sung by the children themselves, offer extensive means for the development of the musical sense.                    *       *       *       *       *  To quicken the child's attention in special relation to sounds there is a most important exercise which, contrary to all attempts made up to this time in the practise of education, consists not in producing but in eliminating, as far as possible, all sounds from the environment. My \"lesson of silence\" has been very widely applied, even in schools where the rest of my method has not found its way, for the sake of its practical effect upon the discipline of the children.  The children are taught \"not to move\"; to inhibit all those motor impulses which may arise from any cause whatsoever, and in order to induce in them real \"immobility,\" it is necessary to initiate them in the _control_ of all their movements. The teacher, then, does not limit herself to saying, \"Sit still,\" but she gives them the example herself, showing them how to sit absolutely still; that is, with feet still, body still, arms still, head still. The respiratory movements should also be performed in such a way as to produce no sound.  The children must be taught how to succeed in this exercise. The fundamental condition is that of finding a comfortable position, _i.e._, a position of equilibrium. As they are seated for this exercise, they must therefore make themselves comfortable either in their little chairs or on the ground. When immobility is obtained, the room is half-darkened, or else the children close their eyes, or cover them with their hands.  It is quite plain to see that the children take a great interest in the \"Silence\"; they seem to give themselves up to a kind of spell: they might be said to be wrapped in meditation. Little by little, as each child, watching himself, becomes more and more still, the silence deepens till it becomes absolute and can be felt, just as the twilight gradually deepens whilst the sun is setting.  Then it is that slight sounds, unnoticed before, are heard; the ticking of the clock, the chirp of a sparrow in the garden, the flight of a butterfly. The world becomes full of imperceptible sounds which invade that deep silence without disturbing it, just as the stars shine out in the dark sky without banishing the darkness of the night. It is almost the discovery of a new world where there is rest. It is, as it were, the twilight of the world of loud noises and of the uproar that oppresses the spirit. At such a time the spirit is set free and opens out like the corolla of the convolvulus.  And leaving metaphor for the reality of facts, can we not all recall feelings that have possessed us at sunset, when all the vivid impressions of the day, the brightness and clamor, are silenced? It is not that we miss the day, but that our spirit expands. It becomes more sensitive to the inner play of emotions, strong and persistent, or changeful and serene.      \"It was that hour when mariners feel longing,      And hearts grow tender.\"                (Dante, trans. Longfellow.)  The lesson of silence ends with a general calling of the children's names. The teacher, or one of the children, takes her place behind the class or in an adjoining room, and \"calls\" the motionless children, one by one, by name; the call is made in a whisper, that is, without vocal sound. This demands a close attention on the part of the child, if he is to hear his name. When his name is called he must rise and find his way to the voice which called him; his movements must be light and vigilant, and so controlled _as to make no noise_.  When the children have become acquainted with _silence_, their hearing is in a manner refined for the perception of sounds. Those sounds which are too loud become gradually displeasing to the ear of one who has known the pleasure of silence, and has discovered the world of delicate sounds. From this point the children gradually go on to perfect themselves; they walk lightly, take care not to knock against the furniture, move their chairs without noise, and place things upon the table with great care. The result of this is seen in the grace of carriage and of movement, which is especially delightful on account of the way in which it has been brought about. It is not a grace taught externally for the sake of beauty or regard for the world, but one which is born of the pleasure felt by the spirit in immobility and silence. The soul of the child wishes to free itself from the irksomeness of sounds that are too loud, from obstacles to its peace during work. These children, with the grace of pages to a noble lord, are serving their spirits.  This exercise develops very definitely the social spirit. No other lesson, no other \"situation,\" could do the same. A profound silence can be obtained even when more than fifty children are crowded together in a small space, provided that _all_ the children know how to keep still and want to do it; but one disturber is enough to take away the charm.  Here is demonstration of the cooperation of all the members of a community to achieve a common end. The children gradually show increased power of _inhibition_; many of them, rather than disturb the silence, refrain from brushing a fly off the nose, or suppress a cough or sneeze. The same exhibition of collective action is seen in the care with which the children move to avoid making a noise during their work. The lightness with which they run on tiptoe, the grace with which they shut a cupboard, or lay an object on the table, these are qualities that must be _acquired by all_, if the environment is to become tranquil and free from disturbance. One rebel is sufficient to mar this achievement; one noisy child, walking on his heels or banging the door, can disturb the peaceful atmosphere of the small community.     LANGUAGE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD   The special importance of the sense of hearing comes from the fact that it is the sense organ connected with speech. Therefore, to train the child's attention to follow sounds and noises which are produced in the environment, to recognize them and to discriminate between them, is to prepare his attention to follow more accurately the sounds of articulate language. The teacher must be careful to pronounce clearly and completely the sounds of the word when she speaks to a child, even though she may be speaking in a low voice, almost as if telling him a secret. The children's songs are also a good means for obtaining exact pronunciation. The teacher, when she teaches them, pronounces slowly, separating the component sounds of the word pronounced.  But a special opportunity for training in clear and exact speech occurs when the lessons are given in the nomenclature relating to the sensory exercises. In every exercise, when the child has _recognized_ the differences between the qualities of the objects, the teacher fixes the idea of this quality with a word. Thus, when the child has many times built and rebuilt the tower of the pink cubes, at an opportune moment the teacher draws near him, and taking the two extreme cubes, the largest and the smallest, and showing them to him, says, \"This is large\"; \"This is small.\" The two words only, _large_ and _small_, are pronounced several times in succession with strong emphasis and with a very clear pronunciation, \"This is _large_, large, large\"; after which there is a moment's pause. Then the teacher, to see if the child has understood, verifies with the following tests: \"Give me the large one. Give me the _small_ one.\" Again, \"The large one.\" \"Now the small one.\" \"Give me the large one.\" Then there is another pause. Finally, the teacher, pointing to the objects in turn asks, \"What is this?\" The child, if he has learned, replies rightly, \"Large,\" \"Small.\" The teacher then urges the child to repeat the words always more clearly and as accurately as possible. \"What is it?\" \"Large.\" \"What?\" \"Large.\" \"Tell me nicely, what is it?\" \"Large.\"  _Large_ and _small_ objects are those which differ only in size and not in form; that is, all three dimensions change more or less proportionally. We should say that a house is \"large\" and a hut is \"small.\" When two pictures represent the same objects in different dimensions one can be said to be an enlargement of the other.  When, however, only the dimensions referring to the section of the object change, while the length remains the same, the objects are respectively \"thick\" and \"thin.\" We should say of two posts of equal height, but different cross-section, that one is \"thick\" and the other is \"thin.\" The teacher, therefore, gives a lesson on the brown prisms similar to that with the cubes in the three \"periods\" which I have described:  _Period 1. Naming._ \"This is thick. This is thin.\"  _Period 2. Recognition._ \"Give me the _thick_. Give me the _thin_.\"  _Period 3. The Pronunciation of the Word._ \"What is this?\"  There is a way of helping the child to recognize differences in dimension and to place the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29643"],["title","Death of a Spaceman (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Illustrator: Ernest Schroeder]    DEATH     OF A       SPACEMAN  BY WALTER M. MILLER, JR.       _The manner in which a man has lived is often the key to the way he     will die. Take old man Donegal, for example. Most of his adult life     was spent in digging a hole through space to learn what was on the     other side. Would he go out the same way?_   Old Donegal was dying. They had all known it was coming, and they watched it come--his haggard wife, his daughter, and now his grandson, home on emergency leave from the pre-astronautics academy. Old Donegal knew it too, and had known it from the beginning, when he had begun to lose control of his legs and was forced to walk with a cane. But most of the time, he pretended to let them keep the secret they shared with the doctors--that the operations had all been failures, and that the cancer that fed at his spine would gnaw its way brainward until the paralysis engulfed vital organs, and then Old Donegal would cease to be. It would be cruel to let them know that he knew. Once, weeks ago, he had joked about the approaching shadows.  \"Buy the plot back where people won't walk over it, Martha,\" he said. \"Get it way back under the cedars--next to the fence. There aren't many graves back there yet. I want to be alone.\"  \"Don't _talk_ that way, Donny!\" his wife had choked. \"You're not dying.\"  His eyes twinkled maliciously. \"Listen, Martha, I want to be buried face-down. I want to be buried with my back to space, understand? Don't let them lay me out like a lily.\"  \"Donny, _please_!\"  \"They oughta face a man the way he's headed,\" Donegal grunted. \"I been up--_way_ up. Now I'm going straight down.\"  Martha had fled from the room in tears. He had never done it again, except to the interns and nurses, who, while they insisted that he was going to get well, didn't mind joking with him about it.  Martha can bear my death, he thought, can bear pre-knowledge of it. But she couldn't bear thinking that he might take it calmly. If he accepted death gracefully, it would be like deliberately leaving her, and Old Donegal had decided to help her believe whatever would be comforting to her in such a troublesome moment.  \"When'll they let me out of this bed again?\" he complained.  \"Be patient, Donny,\" she sighed. \"It won't be long. You'll be up and around before you know it.\"  \"Back on the moon-run, maybe?\" he offered. \"Listen, Martha, I been planet-bound too long. I'm not too old for the moon-run, am I? Sixty-three's not so old.\"  That had been carrying things too far. She knew he was hoaxing, and dabbed at her eyes again. The dead must humor the mourners, he thought, and the sick must comfort the visitors. It was always so.  But it was harder, now that the end was near. His eyes were hazy, and his thoughts unclear. He could move his arms a little, clumsily, but feeling was gone from them. The rest of his body was lost to him. Sometimes he seemed to feel his stomach and his hips, but the sensation was mostly an illusion offered by higher nervous centers, like the \"ghost-arm\" that an amputee continues to feel. The wires were down, and he was cut off from himself.         *       *       *       *       *  He lay wheezing on the hospital bed, in his own room, in his own rented flat. Gaunt and unshaven, gray as winter twilight, he lay staring at the white net curtains that billowed gently in the breeze from the open window. There was no sound in the room but the sound of breathing and the loud ticking of an alarm clock. Occasionally he heard a chair scraping on the stone terrace next door, and the low mutter of voices, sometimes laughter, as the servants of the Keith mansion arranged the terrace for late afternoon guests.  With considerable effort, he rolled his head toward Martha who sat beside the bed, pinch-faced and weary.  \"You ought to get some sleep,\" he said.  \"I slept yesterday. Don't talk, Donny. It tires you.\"  \"You ought to get more sleep. You never sleep enough. Are you afraid I'll get up and run away if you go to sleep for a while?\"  She managed a brittle smile. \"There'll be plenty of time for sleep when ... when you're well again.\" The brittle smile fled and she swallowed hard, like swallowing a fish-bone. He glanced down, and noticed that she was squeezing his hand spasmodically.  There wasn't much left of the hand, he thought. Bones and ugly tight-stretched hide spotted with brown. Bulging knuckles with yellow cigaret stains. My hand. He tried to tighten it, tried to squeeze Martha's thin one in return. He watched it open and contract a little, but it was like operating a remote-control mechanism. Goodbye, hand, you're leaving me the way my legs did, he told it. I'll see you again in hell. How hammy can you get, Old Donegal? You maudlin ass.  \"Requiescat,\" he muttered over the hand, and let it lie in peace.  Perhaps she heard him. \"Donny,\" she whispered, leaning closer, \"won't you let me call the priest now? Please.\"  He rattled a sigh and rolled his head toward the window again. \"Are the Keiths having a party today?\" he asked. \"Sounds like they're moving chairs out on the terrace.\"  \"Please, Donny, the priest?\"  He let his head roll aside and closed his eyes, as if asleep. The bed shook slightly as she quickly caught at his wrist to feel for a pulse.  \"If I'm not dying, I don't need a priest,\" he said sleepily.  \"That's not right,\" she scolded softly. \"You know that's not right, Donny. You know better.\"  Maybe I'm being too rough on her? he wondered. He hadn't minded getting baptized her way, and married her way, and occasionally priest-handled the way she wanted him to when he was home from a space-run, but when it came to dying, Old Donegal wanted to do it his own way.         *       *       *       *       *  He opened his eyes at the sound of a bench being dragged across the stone terrace. \"Martha, what kind of a party are the Keiths having today?\"  \"I wouldn't know,\" she said stiffly. \"You'd think they'd have a little more respect. You'd think they'd put it off a few days.\"  \"Until--?\"  \"Until you feel better.\"  \"I feel fine, Martha. I like parties. I'm glad they're having one. Pour me a drink, will you? I can't reach the bottle anymore.\"  \"It's empty.\"  \"No, it isn't, Martha, it's still a quarter full. I know. I've been watching it.\"  \"You shouldn't have it, Donny. Please don't.\"  \"But this is a party, Martha. Besides, the doctor says I can have whatever I want. Whatever I want, you hear? That means I'm getting well, doesn't it?\"  \"Sure, Donny, sure. Getting well.\"  \"The whiskey, Martha. Just a finger in a tumbler, no more. I want to feel like it's a party.\"  Her throat was rigid as she poured it. She helped him get the tumbler to his mouth. The liquor seared his throat, and he gagged a little as the fumes clogged his nose. Good whiskey, the best--but he couldn't take it any more. He eyed the green stamp on the neck of the bottle on the bed-table and grinned. He hadn't had whiskey like that since his space-days. Couldn't afford it now, not on a blastman's pension.         *       *       *       *       *  He remembered how he and Caid used to smuggle a couple of fifths aboard for the moon-run. If they caught you, it meant suspension, but there was no harm in it, not for the blastroom men who had nothing much to do from the time the ship acquired enough velocity for the long, long coaster ride until they started the rockets again for Lunar landing. You could drink a fifth, jettison the bottle through the trash lock, and sober up before you were needed again. It was the only way to pass the time in the cramped cubicle, unless you ruined your eyes trying to read by the glow-lamps. Old Donegal chuckled. If he and Caid had stayed on the run, Earth would have a ring by now, like Saturn--a ring of Old Granddad bottles.  \"You said it, Donny-boy,\" said the misty man by the billowing curtains. \"Who else knows the gegenschein is broken glass?\"  Donegal laughed. Then he wondered what the man was doing there. The man was lounging against the window, and his unzipped space rig draped about him in an old familiar way. Loose plug-in connections and hose-ends dangled about his lean body. He was freckled and grinning.  \"Caid,\" Old Donegal breathed softly.  \"What did you say, Donny?\" Martha answered.  Old Donegal blinked hard and shook his head. Something let go with a soggy snap, and the misty man was gone. I'd better take it easy on the whiskey, he thought. You got to wait, Donegal, old lush, until Nora and Ken get here. You can't get drunk until they're gone, or you might get them mixed up with memories like Caid's.  Car doors slammed in the street below. Martha glanced toward the window.  \"Think it's them? I wish they'd get here. I wish they'd hurry.\"  Martha arose and tiptoed to the window. She peered down toward the sidewalk, put on a sharp frown. He heard a distant mutter of voices and occasional laughter, with group-footsteps milling about on the sidewalk. Martha murmured her disapproval and closed the window.  \"Leave it open,\" he said.  \"But the Keiths' guests are starting to come. There'll be such a racket.\" She looked at him hopefully, the way she did when she prompted his manners before company came.  Maybe it wasn't decent to listen in on a party when you were dying, he thought. But that wasn't the reason. Donegal, your chamber-pressure's dropping off. Your brains are in your butt-end, where a spacer's brains belong, but your butt-end died last month. She wants the window closed for her own sake, not yours.  \"Leave it closed,\" he grunted. \"But open it again before the moon-run blasts off. I want to listen.\"  She smiled and nodded, glancing at the clock. \"It'll be an hour and a half yet. I'll watch the time.\"  \"I hate that clock. I wish you'd throw it out. It's loud.\"  \"It's your medicine-clock, Donny.\" She came back to sit down at his bedside again. She sat in silence. The clock filled the room with its clicking pulse.  \"What time are they coming?\""]]]
