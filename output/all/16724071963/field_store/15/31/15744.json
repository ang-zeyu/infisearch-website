As   covered with a casing and as left uncovered, it is the   sphere surrounded by Lokāloka [the mountain range which   formed the boundary of the universe in puranic geography].   By the application of water is made ascertainment of the   revolution of time. One may construct a sphere-instrument   combined with quicksilver: this is a mystery; if plainly   described, it would be generally intelligible in the   world. Therefore let the supreme sphere be constructed   according to the instruction of the preceptor [guru]. In   each successive age this construction, having become lost,   is, by the Sun's favour, again revealed to some one or   other, at his pleasure. So also, one should construct   instruments in order to ascertain time. When quite alone,   one should apply quicksilver to the wonder-causing   instrument. By the gnomon, staff, arc, wheel, instruments   for taking the shadow of various kinds.... By   water-instruments, the vessel, by the peacock, man,   monkey, and by stringed sand-receptacles one may determine   time accurately. Quicksilver-holes, water, and cords, and   oil and water, mercury and sand are used in these: these   applications, too, are difficult.      Sūrya Siddhānta_, xiii, 15-22,       E. Burgess' translation, New Haven, 1860.  [Illustration: Figure 9.--ANTIKYTHERA MACHINE, PARTIAL RECONSTRUCTION BY THEOPHANIDIS (see footnote 16).]    A self-revolving instrument [or swayanvaha yantra]: Make a   wheel of light wood and in its circumference put hollow   spokes all having bores of the same diameter, and let them   be placed at equal distances from each other; and let   them also be placed at an angle verging somewhat from the   perpendicular: then half fill these hollow spokes with   mercury; the wheel thus filled will, when placed on an   axis supported by two posts, revolve of itself.    Or scoop out a canal in the tire of the wheel and then   plastering leaves of the Tȧla tree over this canal with   wax, fill one half of this canal with water and the other   half with mercury, till the water begins to come out, and   then cork up the orifice left open for filling the wheel.   The wheel will then revolve of itself, drawn around by the   water.    Description of a syphon: Make up a tube of copper or other   metal, and bend it in the form of an Ankus'a or elephant   hook, fill it with water and stop up both ends. And then   putting one end into a reservoir of water let the other   end remain suspended outside. Now uncork both ends. The   water of the reservoir will be wholly sucked up and fall   outside.    Now attach to the rim of the before described   self-revolving wheel a number of water-pots, and place the   wheel and these pots like the water wheel so that the   water from the lower end of the tube flowing into them on   one side shall set the wheel in motion, impelled by the   additional weight of the pots thus filled. The water   discharge from the pots as they reach the bottom of the   revolving wheel, should be drawn off into the reservoir   before alluded to by means of a water-course or pipe.    The self-revolving machine [mentioned by _Lalla_, etc.]   which has a tube with its lower end open is a vulgar   machine on account of its being dependant, because that   which manifests an ingenious and not a rustic contrivance   is said to be a machine.    And moreover many self-revolving machines are to be met   with, but their motion is procured by a trick. They are   not connected with the subject under discussion. I have   been induced to mention the construction of these, merely   because they have been mentioned by former astronomers.     _Siddhānta Siromaṇi_, xi, 50-57, L. Wilkinson's       translation, revised by Bȧpu̇ deva S(h)ȧstri,       Calcutta, 1861.  Before proceeding to an investigation of the content of these texts it is of considerable importance to establish dates for them, though there are many difficulties in establishing any chronology for Hindu astronomy. The _Sūrya Siddhānta_ is known to date, in its original form, from the early Middle Ages, _ca._ 500. The section in question is however quite evidently an interpolation from a later recension, most probably that which established the complete text as it now stands; it has been variously dated as _ca._ 1000 to _ca._ 1150 A.D. The date of the _Siddhānta Siromaṇi_ is more certain for we know it was written in about 1150 by Bhāskara (born 1114). Thus both these passages must have been written within a century of the great clock-tower made by Su Sung. The technical details will lead us to suppose there is more than a temporal connection.  We have already noted that the armillary spheres and celestial globes described just before these extracts are more similar in design to Chinese than to Ptolemaic practice. The mention of mercury and of sand as alternatives to water for the clock's fluid is another feature very prevalent in Chinese but absent in the Greek texts. Both texts seem conscious of the complexity of these devices and there is a hint (it is lost and revealed) that the story has been transmitted, only half understood, from another age or culture. It should also be noted that the mentions of cords and strings rather than gears, and the use of spheres rather than planispheres would suggest we are dealing with devices similar to the earliest Greek models rather than the later devices, or with the Chinese practice.  A quite new and important note is injected by the passage from the Bhāskara text. Obviously intrusive in this astronomical text we have the description of two \"perpetual motion wheels\" together with a third, castigated by the author, which helps its perpetuity by letting water flow from a reservoir by means of a syphon and drop into pots around the circumference of the wheel. These seem to be the basis also, in the extract from the _Sūrya Siddhānta_, of the \"wonder-causing instrument\" to which mercury must be applied.  In the next sections we shall show that this idea of a perpetual motion device occurs again in conjunction with astronomical models in Islam and shortly afterwards in medieval Europe. At each occurrence, as here, there are echoes of other cultures. In addition to those already mentioned we find the otherwise mysterious \"peacock, man and monkey,\" cited as parts of the jackwork of astronomical clocks of Islam, associated with the weight drive so essential to the later horology in Europe.  We have already seen that in classical times there were already two different types of protoclocks; one, which may be termed \"nonmathematical,\" designed only to give a visual aid in the conception of the cosmos, the other, which may be termed \"mathematical\" in which stereographic projection or gearing was employed to make the device a quantitative rather than qualitative representation. These two lines occur again in the Islamic culture area.  Nonmathematical protoclocks which are scarcely removed from the classical forms appear continuously through the Byzantine era and in Islam as soon as it recovered from the first shocks of its formation. Procopius (died _ca._ 535) describes a monumental water clock which was erected in Gaza _ca._ 500.[17] It contained impressive jackwork, such as a Medusa head which rolled its eyes every hour on the hour, exhibiting the time through lighted apertures and showing mythological interpretations of the cosmos. All these effects were produced by Heronic techniques, using hydraulic power and puppets moved by strings, rather than with gearing.  Again in 807 a similarly marvelous exhibition clock made of bronze was sent by Harun-al-Rashid to the Emperor Charlemagne; it seems to have been of the same type, with automata and hydraulic works. For the succeeding few centuries, Islam was in its Golden Age of development of technical astronomy (_ca._ 950-1150) and attention may have been concentrated on the more mathematical protoclocks. Towards the end of the 12th century, however, there was a revival of the old tradition, mainly at the court of the Emperor Saladin (1146-1173) when a great automaton water clock, more magnificent than any hitherto, was erected in Damascus. It was rebuilt, after 1168, by Muḥammad b. 'Alī b. Rustum, and repaired and improved by his son, Fakhr ad-dīn Riḍwān b. Muḥammad,[18] who is most important as the author of a book which describes in considerable technical detail the construction of this and other protoclocks. Closely associated with his book one also finds texts dealing with perpetual-motion devices, which we shall consider later.  During the century following this horological exuberance in Damascus, the center of gravity of Islamic astronomy shifted from the East to the Hispano-Moorish West. At the same time there comes more evidence that the line of mathematical protoclocks had not been left unattended. This is suggested by a description given by Trithemius of another royal gift from East to West which seems to have been different from the automata and hydraulic devices of the tradition from Procopius to Riḍwān:[19]    In the same year [1232] the Saladin of Egypt sent by his   ambassadors as a gift to the emperor Frederic a valuable   machine of wonderful construction worth more than five   thousand ducats. For it appeared to resemble internally a   celestial globe in which figures of the sun, moon, and   other planets formed with the greatest skill moved, being   impelled by weights and wheels, so that performing their   course in certain and fixed intervals they pointed out the   hour night and day with infallible certainty; also the   twelve signs of the zodiac with certain appropriate   characters, moved with the firmament, contained within   themselves the course of the planets.  [Illustration: Figure 10.--CALENDRICAL GEARING DESIGNED BY AL-BIRUNI, _ca._ A.D. 1000. The gear train count is 40-10+7-59+19-59+24-48. The gear of 48"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30001"],["title","On the Origin of Clockwork, Perpetual Motion Devices, and the Compass (#5)"],["body","makes 19 (annual) rotations while that of 19-59 shows 118 double lunations of 29+30=59 days. The gear of 40 shows a (lunar) rotation in exactly 28 days, and the center pinions 7+10 rotate in exactly one week. After Wiedemann (see footnote 20).]  The phrase \"resembled internally\" is of especial interest in this passage; it may perhaps arise as a mistranslation of the technical term for stereographic projection of the sphere, and if so the device might have been an anaphoric clock or some other astrolabic device.  This is made more probable by the existence of a specifically Islamic concentration on the astrolabe, and on its planetary companion instrument, the equatorium, as devices for mechanizing computation by use of geometrical analogues. The ordinary planispheric astrolabe, of course, was known in Islam from its first days until almost the present time. From the time of al-Biruni (_ca._ 1000)--significantly, perhaps, he is well known for his travel account of India--there is remarkable innovation.  Most cogent to our purpose is a text, described for the first time by Wiedemann,[20] in which al-Biruni explains how a special train of gearing may be used to show the revolutions of the sun and moon at their relative rates and to demonstrate the changing phase of the moon, features of fundamental importance in the Islamic (lunar) calendrical system. This device necessarily uses gear wheels with an odd number of teeth (_e.g._, 7, 19, 59) as dictated by the astronomical constants involved (see fig. 10). The teeth are shaped like equilateral triangles and square shanks are used, exactly as with the Antikythera machine. Horse-headed wedges are used for fixing; a tradition borrowed from the horse-shaped _Farās_ used to fasten the traditional astrolabe. Of special interest for us is the lunar phase diagram, which is just the same in form and structure as the lunar volvelle that occurs later in horology and is still so commonly found today, especially as a decoration for the dial of grandfather clocks.  [Illustration: Figure 11.--GEARED ASTROLABE BY MUḤAMMAD B. ABĪ BAKR OF ISFAHAN, A.D. 1221-1222. (_Photo courtesy of Science Museum, London._)]  Biruni's calendrical machine is the earliest complicated geared device on record and it is therefore all the more significant that it carries a feature found in later clocks. From the manuscript description alone one could not tell whether it was designed for automatic action or merely to be turned by hand. Fortunately this point is made clear by the most happy survival of an intact specimen of this very device, without doubt the oldest geared machine in existence in a complete state.  [Illustration: Figure 12.--GEARING FROM ASTROLABE SHOWN IN FIGURE 11. The gear train count is as follows: 48-13+8-64+64-64+10-60. The pinion of 8 has been incorrectly replaced by a more modern pinion of 10. The gear of 48 should make 13 (lunar) rotations while the double gear of 64+64 makes 6 revolutions of double months (of 29-30 days) and the gear of 60 makes a single turn in the hegiral year of 354 days. (_Photo courtesy of Science Museum, London._)]  This landmark in the history of science and technology is now preserved at the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford, England.[21] It is an astrolabe, dated 1221-22 and signed by the maker, Muḥammad b. Abī Bakr (died 1231-32) of Isfahan, Persia (see figs. 11 and 12). The very close resemblance to the design of Biruni is quite apparent, though the gearing has been simplified very cleverly so that only one wheel has an odd number of teeth (13), the rest being much easier to mark out geometrically (_e.g._, 10, 48, 60, and 64 teeth). The lunar phase volvelle can be seen through the circular opening at the back of the astrolabe. It is quite certain that no automatic action is intended; when the central pivot is turned, by hand, probably by using the astrolabe rete as a \"handle,\" the calendrical circles and the lunar phase are moved accordingly. Using one turn for a day would be too slow for useful re-setting of the instrument, in practice a turn corresponds more nearly to an interval of one week.  [Illustration: Figure 13.--ASTROLABE CLOCK, REGULATED BY A MERCURY DRUM, from the Alfonsine _Libros del saber_ (see footnote 22).]  In addition to this geared development of the astrolabe, the same period in Islam brought forth a new device, the equatorium, a mechanical model designed to simulate the geometrical constructions used for finding the positions of the planets in Ptolemaic astronomy. The method may have originated already in classical times, a simple device being described by Proclus Diadochus (_ca._ 450), but the first general, though crude, planetary equatorium seems to have been described by Abulcacim Abnacahm (_ca._ 1025) in Granada; it has been handed down to us in the archaic Castilian of the Alfonsine _Libros del saber_.[22] The sections of this book, dealing with the _Laminas de las VII Planetas_, describe not only this instrument but also the improved modification introduced by Azarchiel (born _ca._ 1029, died _ca._ 1087).  No Islamic examples of the equatorium have survived, but from this period onward, there appears to have been a long and active tradition of them, and ultimately they were transmitted to the West, along with the rest of the Alfonsine corpus. More important for our argument is that they were the basis for the mechanized astronomical models of Richard of Wallingford (_ca._ 1320) and probably others, and for the already mentioned great astronomical clock of de Dondi. In fact, the complicated gearwork and dials of de Dondi's clock constitute a series of equatoria, mechanized in just the same way as the calendrical device described by Biruni.  It is evident that we are coming nearer now to the beginning of the true mechanical clock, and our last step, also from the Alfonsine corpus of western Islam, provides us with an important link between the anaphoric clock, the weight drive, and a most curious perpetual-motion device, the mercury wheel, used as an escapement or regulator. The Alfonsine book on clocks contains descriptions of five devices in all, four of them being due to Isaac b. Sid (two sundials, an automaton water-clock and the present mercury clock) and one to Samuel ha-Levi Adulafia (a candle clock)--they were probably composed just before _ca._ 1276-77.  [Illustration: Figure 14.--ISLAMIC PERPETUAL MOTION WHEEL, after manuscript cited by Schmeller (see footnote 26).]  The mercury clock of Isaac b. Sid consists of an astrolabe dial, rotated as in the anaphoric clock, and fitted with 30 leaf-shaped gear teeth (see fig. 13). These are driven by a pinion of 6 leaves mounted on a horizontal axle (shown very diagrammatically in the illustration) and at the other end of this axle is a wheel on which is mounted the special mercury drum which is powered by a normal weight drive.  It is the mercury drum which forms the most novel feature of this device; the fluid, constrained in 12 chambers so as to just fill 6 of them, must slowly filter through small holes in the constraining walls. In practice, of course, the top mercury surfaces will not be level, but higher on the right so as to balance dynamically the moment of the applied weight on its driven rope. This curious arrangement shows point of resemblance to the Indian \"mercury-holes,\" to the perpetual-motion devices found in the medieval European tradition and also in the texts associated with Riḍwān, which we shall next examine.  [Illustration: Figure 15.--ANOTHER PERPETUAL MOTION WHEEL, after the text cited in figure 14.]  It is of the greatest interest to our theme that the Islamic contributions to horology and perpetual motion seem to form a closely knit corpus. A most important series of horological texts, including those of Riḍwān and al-Jazarī, have been edited by Wiedemann and Hauser.[23] Other Islamic texts give versions of the water clocks and automata of Archimedes and of Hero and Philo of Alexandria.[24] In at least three cases[25] these texts are found also associated with texts describing perpetual-motion wheels and other hydraulic devices. Three manuscripts of this type have been published in German translation by Schmeller.[26] The devices include a many chambered wheel (see fig. 14) similar to the Alfonsine mercury \"escapement,\" a wheel of slanting tubes constructed like the noria (see fig. 15), wheels of weights swinging on arms as described by Villard of Honnecourt, and a remarkable device which seems to be the earliest known example of a weight drive. This latter machine is a pump, in which a chain of buckets is used to raise water by passing over a pulley which is geared to a drum powered by a falling weight (see fig. 16); perhaps for balance, the whole arrangement is made in duplicate with common axles for the corresponding parts.  [Illustration: Figure 16.--ISLAMIC PUMP POWERED BY A WEIGHT DRIVE, after the text cited in figure 14.]  The Islamic tradition of water clocks did not involve the use of gears, though very occasionally a pair is used to turn power through an angle when this is dictated by the use of a water wheel in the automata. In the main, everything is worked by floats and strings or by hydraulic or pneumatic forces, as in Heros devices. The automata are very elaborate, with figures of men, monkeys, peacocks, etc., symbolizing the passage of hours.   MEDIEVAL EUROPE  Echoes from nearly all the developments already noted from other parts of the world are found to occur in medieval Europe, often coming through channels of communication more precisely determinable than those hitherto mentioned. Before the influx of Islamic learning at the time of transmission of the Toledo Tables (12th century) and the Alfonsine Tables (which reached Paris _ca._ 1292), there are occasional references to the most primitive mechanized \"visual aids\" in astronomy.  The most famous of these occurs in an historical account by Richer of Rheims about his "]]]
