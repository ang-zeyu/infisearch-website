There was never post of danger but we sought it         In the fighting, through the fire, and through the flood.        There was never prize so costly but we bought it,         Though we paid for its purchase with our blood.         Was there any road too rough for us to travel?         Was there any path too far for us to tread?        You can track us by the blood drops on the gravel         On the roads that we milestoned with our dead!         And for you, oh our young and anxious mother,         O'er your great gains keeping watch and ward,        Neither fearing nor despising any other,         We will hold your possessions with the sword.              .    .    .    .    .    Then they passed to the place of world-long sleeping,    The grey-clad figures with their dead,   To the sound of their women softly weeping    And the Dead March moaning at their head:   And the Nations, as the grim procession ended,    Whispered, 'Child!  But ye have seen the price we pay,   From War may we ever be defended,    Kneel ye down, new-made Sister -- Let us Pray!'     The Old Australian Ways      The London lights are far abeam    Behind a bank of cloud,   Along the shore the gaslights gleam,    The gale is piping loud;   And down the Channel, groping blind,    We drive her through the haze   Towards the land we left behind --   The good old land of 'never mind',    And old Australian ways.    The narrow ways of English folk    Are not for such as we;   They bear the long-accustomed yoke    Of staid conservancy:   But all our roads are new and strange,    And through our blood there runs   The vagabonding love of change   That drove us westward of the range    And westward of the suns.    The city folk go to and fro    Behind a prison's bars,   They never feel the breezes blow    And never see the stars;   They never hear in blossomed trees    The music low and sweet   Of wild birds making melodies,   Nor catch the little laughing breeze    That whispers in the wheat.    Our fathers came of roving stock    That could not fixed abide:   And we have followed field and flock    Since e'er we learnt to ride;   By miner's camp and shearing shed,    In land of heat and drought,   We followed where our fortunes led,   With fortune always on ahead    And always further out.    The wind is in the barley-grass,    The wattles are in bloom;   The breezes greet us as they pass    With honey-sweet perfume;   The parakeets go screaming by    With flash of golden wing,   And from the swamp the wild-ducks cry   Their long-drawn note of revelry,    Rejoicing at the Spring.    So throw the weary pen aside    And let the papers rest,   For we must saddle up and ride    Towards the blue hill's breast;   And we must travel far and fast    Across their rugged maze,   To find the Spring of Youth at last,   And call back from the buried past    The old Australian ways.    When Clancy took the drover's track    In years of long ago,   He drifted to the outer back    Beyond the Overflow;   By rolling plain and rocky shelf,    With stockwhip in his hand,   He reached at last, oh lucky elf,   The Town of Come-and-help-yourself    In Rough-and-ready Land.    And if it be that you would know    The tracks he used to ride,   Then you must saddle up and go    Beyond the Queensland side --   Beyond the reach of rule or law,    To ride the long day through,   In Nature's homestead -- filled with awe   You then might see what Clancy saw    And know what Clancy knew.     The Ballad of the 'Calliope'          By the far Samoan shore,       Where the league-long rollers pour   All the wash of the Pacific on the coral-guarded bay,       Riding lightly at their ease,       In the calm of tropic seas,   The three great nations' warships at their anchors proudly lay.        Riding lightly, head to wind,       With the coral reefs behind,   Three Germans and three Yankee ships were mirrored in the blue;       And on one ship unfurled       Was the flag that rules the world --   For on the old 'Calliope' the flag of England flew.        When the gentle off-shore breeze,       That had scarcely stirred the trees,   Dropped down to utter stillness, and the glass began to fall,       Away across the main       Lowered the coming hurricane,   And far away to seaward hung the cloud wrack like a pall.        If the word had passed around,       'Let us move to safer ground;   Let us steam away to seaward' -- then this tale were not to tell!       But each Captain seemed to say       'If the others stay, I stay!'   And they lingered at their moorings till the shades of evening fell.        Then the cloud wrack neared them fast,       And there came a sudden blast,   And the hurricane came leaping down a thousand miles of main!       Like a lion on its prey,       Leapt the storm fiend on the bay,   And the vessels shook and shivered as their cables felt the strain.        As the surging seas came by,       That were running mountains high,   The vessels started dragging, drifting slowly to the lee;       And the darkness of the night       Hid the coral reefs from sight,   And the Captains dared not risk the chance to grope their way to sea.        In the dark they dared not shift!       They were forced to wait and drift;   All hands stood by uncertain would the anchors hold or no.       But the men on deck could see       If a chance of hope might be --   There was little chance of safety for the men who were below.        Through that long, long night of dread,       While the storm raged overhead,   They were waiting by their engines, with the furnace fires aroar.       So they waited, staunch and true,       Though they knew, and well they knew,   They must drown like rats imprisoned if the vessel touched the shore.        When the grey dawn broke at last,       And the long, long night was past,   While the hurricane redoubled, lest its prey should steal away,       On the rocks, all smashed and strewn,       Were the German vessels thrown,   While the Yankees, swamped and helpless, drifted shorewards down the bay.        Then at last spoke Captain Kane,       'All our anchors are in vain,   And the Germans and the Yankees they have drifted to the lee!       Cut the cables at the bow!       We must trust the engines now!   Give her steam, and let her have it, lads, we'll fight her out to sea!'        And the answer came with cheers       From the stalwart engineers,   From the grim and grimy firemen at the furnaces below;       And above the sullen roar       Of the breakers on the shore   Came the throbbing of the engines as they laboured to and fro.        If the strain should find a flaw,       Should a bolt or rivet draw,   Then -- God help them! for the vessel were a plaything in the tide!       With a face of honest cheer,       Quoth an English engineer,   'I will answer for the engines that were built on old Thames side!        'For the stays and stanchions taut,       For the rivets truly wrought,   For the valves that fit their faces as a glove should fit the hand.       Give her every ounce of power,       If we make a knot an hour   Then it's way enough to steer her and we'll drive her from the land.'        Like a foam flake tossed and thrown,       She could barely hold her own,   While the other ships all helplessly were drifting to the lee.       Through the smother and the rout       The 'Calliope' steamed out --   And they cheered her from the Trenton that was foundering in the sea.        Aye! drifting shoreward there,       All helpless as they were,   Their vessel hurled upon the reefs as weed ashore is hurled.       Without a thought of fear       The Yankees raised a cheer --   A cheer that English-speaking folk should echo round the world.     Do They Know      Do they know?  At the turn to the straight    Where the favourites fail,   And every atom of weight    Is telling its tale;   As some grim old stayer hard-pressed    Runs true to his breed,   And with head just in front of the rest    Fights on in the lead;   When the jockeys are out with the whips,    With a furlong to go;   And the backers grow white to the lips --    Do you think THEY don't know?    Do they know?  As they come back to weigh    In a whirlwind of cheers,   Though the spurs have left marks of the fray,    Though the sweat on the ears   Gathers cold, and they sob with distress    As they roll up the track,   They know just as well their success    As the man on their back.   As they walk through a dense human lane,    That sways to and fro,   And cheers them again and again,    Do you think THEY don't know?     The Passing of Gundagai      'I'll introdooce a friend!' he said,    And if you've got a vacant pen   You'd better take him in the shed   And start him shearing straight ahead,    He's one of these here quiet men.    'He never strikes -- that ain't his game;    No matter what the others try   HE goes on shearing just the same.   I never rightly knew his name --    We always call him \"Gundagai\"!'    Our flashest shearer then had gone    To train a racehorse for a race,   And while his sporting fit was on   He couldn't be relied upon,    So 'Gundagai' shore in his place.    Alas for man's veracity!    For reputations false and true!   This 'Gundagai' turned out to be,   For strife and all-round villainy,    The very worst I ever knew!    He started racing Jack Devine,    And grumbled when I made him stop.   The pace he showed was extra fine,   But all those pure-bred ewes of mine    Were bleeding like a butcher's shop.    He cursed the sheep, he cursed the shed,    From roof to rafter, floor to shelf;   As for my mongrel ewes, he said,   I ought to get a razor blade    And shave the blooming things myself.    On Sundays he controlled a 'school',    And played 'two-up' the livelong day;   And many a young"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/304"],["title","Rio Grande's Last Race, and Other Verses (#8)"],["body","fool   He shore of his financial wool;    And when he lost he would not pay.    He organised a shearers' race,    And 'touched' me to provide the prize.   His packhorse showed surprising pace   And won hands down -- he was The Ace,    A well-known racehorse in disguise.    Next day the bruiser of the shed    Displayed an opal-tinted eye,   With large contusions on his head.   He smiled a sickly smile, and said    He'd 'had a cut at \"Gundagai\"!'    But just as we were getting full    Of 'Gundagai' and all his ways,   A telegram for 'Henry Bull'   Arrived.  Said he, 'That's me -- all wool!    Let's see what this here message says.'    He opened it, his face grew white,    He dropped the shears and turned away.   It ran, 'Your wife took bad last night;   Come home at once -- no time to write,    We fear she may not last the day.'    He got his cheque -- I didn't care    To dock him for my mangled ewes;   His store account -- we 'called it square'.   Poor wretch! he had enough to bear,    Confronted by such dreadful news.    The shearers raised a little purse    To help a mate, as shearers will,   'To pay the doctor and the nurse,   And if there should be something worse --    To pay the undertaker's bill.'    They wrung his hand in sympathy,    He rode away without a word,   His head hung down in misery.   A wandering hawker passing by    Was told of what had just occurred.    'Well! that's a curious thing,' he said,    'I've known that feller all his life --   He's had the loan of this here shed!   I know his wife ain't nearly dead,    Because he HASN'T GOT A WIFE!'         .    .    .    .    .    You should have heard the whipcord crack    As angry shearers galloped by,   In vain they tried to fetch him back.   A little dust along the track    Was all they saw of 'Gundagai'.     The Wargeilah Handicap      Wargeilah town is very small,    There's no cathedral nor a club,   In fact the township, all in all,    Is just one unpretentious pub;   And there, from all the stations round,   The local sportsmen can be found.    The sportsmen of Wargeilah side    Are very few but very fit:   There's scarcely any sport been tried    But what they held their own at it   In fact, to search their records o'er,   They held their own and something more.    'Twas round about Wargeilah town    An English new-chum did infest:   He used to wander up and down    In baggy English breeches drest --   His mental aspect seemed to be   Just stolid self-sufficiency.    The local sportsmen vainly sought    His tranquil calm to counteract,   By urging that he should be brought    Within the Noxious Creatures Act.   'Nay, harm him not,' said one more wise,   'He is a blessing in disguise!    'You see, he wants to buy a horse,    To ride, and hunt, and steeplechase,   And carry ladies, too, of course,    And pull a cart and win a race.   Good gracious! he must be a flat   To think he'll get a horse like that!    'But since he has so little sense    And such a lot of cash to burn,   We'll sell him some experience    By which alone a fool can learn.   Suppose we let him have The Trap   To win Wargeilah Handicap!'    And here, I must explain to you    That, round about Wargeilah run,   There lived a very aged screw    Whose days of brilliancy were done:   A grand old warrior in his prime --   But age will beat us all in time.    A trooper's horse in seasons past    He did his share to keep the peace,   But took to falling, and at last    Was cast for age from the Police.   A publican at Conroy's Gap   Then bought and christened him The Trap.    When grass was good, and horses dear,    He changed his owner now and then   At prices ranging somewhere near    The neighbourhood of two pound ten:   And manfully he earned his keep   By yarding cows and ration sheep.    They brought him in from off the grass    And fed and groomed the old horse up;   His coat began to shine like glass --    You'd think he'd win the Melbourne Cup.   And when they'd got him fat and flash   They asked the new-chum -- fifty -- cash!    And when he said the price was high,    Their indignation knew no bounds.   They said, 'It's seldom you can buy    A horse like that for fifty pounds!   We'll refund twenty if The Trap   Should fail to win the handicap!'    The deed was done, the price was paid,    The new-chum put the horse in train:   The local sports were much afraid    That he would sad experience gain,   By racing with some shearer's hack,   Who'd beat him half-way round the track.    So, on this guileless English spark    They did most fervently impress   That he must keep the matter dark,    And not let any person guess   That he was purchasing The Trap   To win Wargeilah Handicap.    They spoke of 'spielers from The Bland',    And 'champions from the Castlereagh',   And gave the youth to understand    That all of these would stop away,   And spoil the race, if they should hear   That they had got The Trap to fear.    'Keep dark!  They'll muster thick as flies    When once the news gets sent around   We're giving such a splendid prize --    A Snowdon horse worth fifty pound!   They'll come right in from Dandaloo,   And find -- that it's a gift to you!'         .    .    .    .    .    The race came on -- with no display,    Nor any calling of the card,   But round about the pub all day    A crowd of shearers, drinking hard,   And using language in a strain   'Twere flattery to call profane.    Our hero, dressed in silk attire --    Blue jacket and a scarlet cap --   With boots that shone like flames of fire,    Now did his canter on The Trap,   And walked him up and round about,   Until the other steeds came out.    He eyed them with a haughty look,    But saw a sight that caught his breath!   It was!  Ah John!  The Chinee cook!    In boots and breeches!  Pale as death!   Tied with a rope, like any sack,   Upon a piebald pony's back!    The next, a colt -- all mud and burrs!    Half-broken, with a black boy up,   Who said, 'You gim'me pair o' spurs,    I win the bloomin' Melbourne Cup!'   These two were to oppose The Trap   For the Wargeilah Handicap!    They're off!  The colt whipped down his head,    And humped his back and gave a squeal,   And bucked into the drinking shed,    Revolving like a Cath'rine wheel!   Men ran like rats!  The atmosphere   Was filled with oaths and pints of beer!    But up the course the bold Ah John    Beside The Trap raced neck and neck:   The boys had tied him firmly on,    Which ultimately proved his wreck,   The saddle turned, and, like a clown,   He rode some distance upside down.    His legs around the horse were tied,    His feet towards the heavens were spread,   He swung and bumped at every stride    And ploughed the ground up with his head!   And when they rescued him, The Trap   Had won Wargeilah Handicap!    And no enquiries we could make    Could tell by what false statements swayed   Ah John was led to undertake    A task so foreign to his trade!   He only smiled and said, 'Hoo Ki!   I stop topside, I win all 'li!'    But never, in Wargeilah Town,    Was heard so eloquent a cheer   As when the President came down,    And toasted, in Colonial Beer,   'The finest rider on the course!   The winner of the Snowdon Horse!'    'You go and get your prize,' he said,    'He's with a wild mob, somewhere round   The mountains near The Watershed;    He's honestly worth fifty pound,   A noble horse, indeed, to win,   But none of US can run him in!    'We've chased him poor, we've chased him fat,    We've run him till our horses dropped,   But by such obstacles as that    A man like you will not be stopped,   You'll go and yard him any day,   So here's your health!  Hooray!  Hooray!'         .    .    .    .    .    The day wound up with booze and blow    And fights till all were well content,   But of the new-chum, all I know    Is shown by this advertisement --   'For Sale, the well-known racehorse Trap,   He won Wargeilah Handicap!'     Any Other Time      All of us play our very best game --    Any other time.   Golf or billiards, it's all the same --    Any other time.   Lose a match and you always say,   'Just my luck!  I was 'off' to-day!   I could have beaten him quite half-way --    Any other time!'    After a fiver you ought to go --    Any other time.   Every man that you ask says 'Oh,    Any OTHER time.   Lend you a fiver!  I'd lend you two,   But I'm overdrawn and my bills are due,   Wish you'd ask me -- now, mind you do --    Any other time!'    Fellows will ask you out to dine --    Any other time.   'Not to-night, for we're twenty-nine --    Any other time.   Not to-morrow, for cook's on strike,   Not next day, I'll be out on the bike --   Just drop in whenever you like --    Any other time!'    Seasick passengers like the sea --    Any other time.   'Something . . I ate . . disagreed . . with me!    Any other time   Ocean-trav'lling is . . simply bliss,   Must be my . . liver . . has gone amiss . .   Why, I would . . laugh . . at a sea . . like this --    Any other time.'         .    .    .    .    .    Most of us mean to be better men --    Any other time:   Regular upright characters then --    Any other time.   Yet somehow as the years go by   Still we gamble and drink and lie,   When it comes to the last we'll want to die --    Any other time!     The Last Trump      'You led the trump,' the old man said    With fury in his eye,   'And yet you hope my girl to wed!   Young man! your hopes of love are fled,    'Twere better she should die!    'My sweet young daughter sitting there,    So innocent and plump!   You don't suppose that she would care   To wed an outlawed man who'd dare    To lead the thirteenth trump!    'If you had drawn their leading spade    It meant a certain win!   But no!  By Pembroke's mighty shade   The thirteenth trump you went and played    And let their diamonds in!    'My girl!  Return at my command    His presents in a lump!   Return his ring!  For understand   No man is fit to hold"]]]
