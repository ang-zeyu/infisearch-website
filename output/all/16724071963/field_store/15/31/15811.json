Those of you who have carefully followed the preceding discussion are almost sure to expect that we should retain the principle of relativity, which appeals so convincingly to the intellect because it is so natural and simple. The law of the propagation of light _in vacuo_ would then have to be replaced by a more complicated law conformable to the principle of relativity. The development of theoretical physics shows, however, that we cannot pursue this course. The epoch-making theoretical investigations of H. A. Lorentz on the electrodynamical and optical phenomena connected with moving bodies show that experience in this domain leads conclusively to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena, of which the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo is a necessary consequence. Prominent theoretical physicists were therefore more inclined to reject the principle of relativity, in spite of the fact that no empirical data had been found which were contradictory to this principle.  At this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena. As a result of an analysis of the physical conceptions of time and space, it became evident that _in reality there is not the least incompatibilitiy between the principle of relativity and the law of propagation of light_, and that by systematically holding fast to both these laws a logically rigid theory could be arrived at. This theory has been called the _special theory of relativity_ to distinguish it from the extended theory, with which we shall deal later. In the following pages we shall present the fundamental ideas of the special theory of relativity.   VIII.  ON THE IDEA OF TIME IN PHYSICS  Lightning has struck the rails on our railway embankment at two places _A_ and _B_ far distant from each other. I make the additional assertion that these two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously. If I ask you whether there is sense in this statement, you will answer my question with a decided “Yes.” But if I now approach you with the request to explain to me the sense of the statement more precisely, you find after some consideration that the answer to this question is not so easy as it appears at first sight.  After some time perhaps the following answer would occur to you: “The significance of the statement is clear in itself and needs no further explanation; of course it would require some consideration if I were to be commissioned to determine by observations whether in the actual case the two events took place simultaneously or not.” I cannot be satisfied with this answer for the following reason. Supposing that as a result of ingenious considerations an able meteorologist were to discover that the lightning must always strike the places _A_ and _B_ simultaneously, then we should be faced with the task of testing whether or not this theoretical result is in accordance with the reality. We encounter the same difficulty with all physical statements in which the conception “simultaneous” plays a part. The concept does not exist for the physicist until he has the possibility of discovering whether or not it is fulfilled in an actual case. We thus require a definition of simultaneity such that this definition supplies us with the method by means of which, in the present case, he can decide by experiment whether or not both the lightning strokes occurred simultaneously. As long as this requirement is not satisfied, I allow myself to be deceived as a physicist (and of course the same applies if I am not a physicist), when I imagine that I am able to attach a meaning to the statement of simultaneity. (I would ask the reader not to proceed farther until he is fully convinced on this point.)  After thinking the matter over for some time you then offer the following suggestion with which to test simultaneity. By measuring along the rails, the connecting line _AB_ should be measured up and an observer placed at the mid-point M of the distance _AB_. This observer should be supplied with an arrangement (_e.g._ two mirrors inclined at 90°) which allows him visually to observe both places _A_ and _B_ at the same time. If the observer perceives the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then they are simultaneous.  I am very pleased with this suggestion, but for all that I cannot regard the matter as quite settled, because I feel constrained to raise the following objection: “Your definition would certainly be right, if only I knew that the light by means of which the observer at _M_ perceives the lightning flashes travels along the length _A_ → _M_ with the same velocity as along the length _B_ → _M_. But an examination of this supposition would only be possible if we already had at our disposal the means of measuring time. It would thus appear as though we were moving here in a logical circle.”  After further consideration you cast a somewhat disdainful glance at me—and rightly so—and you declare: “I maintain my previous definition nevertheless, because in reality it assumes absolutely nothing about light. There is only _one_ demand to be made of the definition of simultaneity, namely, that in every real case it must supply us with an empirical decision as to whether or not the conception that has to be defined is fulfilled. That my definition satisfies this demand is indisputable. That light requires the same time to traverse the path _A_ → _M_ as for the path _B_ → _M_ is in reality neither a _supposition nor a hypothesis_ about the physical nature of light, but a _stipulation_ which I can make of my own freewill in order to arrive at a definition of simultaneity.”  It is clear that this definition can be used to give an exact meaning not only to _two_ events, but to as many events as we care to choose, and independently of the positions of the scenes of the events with respect to the body of reference[7] (here the railway embankment). We are thus led also to a definition of “time” in physics. For this purpose we suppose that clocks of identical construction are placed at the points _A, B_ and _C_ of the railway line (co-ordinate system) and that they are set in such a manner that the positions of their pointers are simultaneously (in the above sense) the same. Under these conditions we understand by the “time” of an event the reading (position of the hands) of that one of these clocks which is in the immediate vicinity (in space) of the event. In this manner a time-value is associated with every event which is essentially capable of observation.    [7] We suppose further that, when three events _A, B_ and _C_ occur in  different places in such a manner that, if _A_ is simultaneous with  _B_, and _B_ is simultaneous with _C_ (simultaneous in the sense of  the above definition), then the criterion for the simultaneity of the  pair of events _A, C_ is also satisfied. This assumption is a physical  hypothesis about the law of propagation of light; it must certainly be  fulfilled if we are to maintain the law of the constancy of the  velocity of light _in vacuo_.   This stipulation contains a further physical hypothesis, the validity of which will hardly be doubted without empirical evidence to the contrary. It has been assumed that all these clocks _go at the same rate_ if they are of identical construction. Stated more exactly: When two clocks arranged at rest in different places of a reference-body are set in such a manner that a _particular_ position of the pointers of the one clock is _simultaneous_ (in the above sense) with the _same_ position, of the pointers of the other clock, then identical “settings” are always simultaneous (in the sense of the above definition).   IX.  THE RELATIVITY OF SIMULTANEITY  Up to now our considerations have been referred to a particular body of reference, which we have styled a “railway embankment.” We suppose a very long train travelling along the rails with the constant velocity v and in the direction indicated in Fig 1. People travelling in this train will with a vantage view the train as a rigid reference-body (co-ordinate system); they regard all events in reference to the train. Then every event which takes place along the line also takes place at a particular point of the train. Also the definition of simultaneity can be given relative to the train in exactly the same way as with respect to the embankment. As a natural consequence, however, the following question arises:  image001   Are two events (_e.g._ the two strokes of lightning _A_ and _B_) which are simultaneous _with reference to the railway embankment_ also simultaneous _relatively to the train?_ We shall show directly that the answer must be in the negative.  When we say that the lightning strokes _A_ and _B_ are simultaneous with respect to be embankment, we mean: the rays of light emitted at the places _A_ and _B_, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at the mid-point _M_ of the length _A_ → _B_ of the embankment. But the events _A_ and _B_ also correspond to positions _A_ and _B_ on the train. Let _M′_ be the mid-point of the distance _A_ → _B_ on the travelling train. Just when the flashes (as judged from the embankment) of lightning occur, this point _M′_ naturally coincides with the point _M_ but it moves towards the right in the diagram with the velocity v of the train. If an observer sitting in the position _M′_ in the train did not possess this velocity, then he would remain permanently at M, and the light rays emitted by the flashes of lightning _A_ and _B_ would reach him simultaneously, _i.e._ they would meet just where he is situated. Now in reality (considered with reference to the railway embankment) he is hastening towards the beam of light coming from _B_, whilst he is riding on ahead of the beam of light coming from _A_. Hence the observer will see the beam of light emitted from _B_ earlier than he will see that emitted from _A_. Observers who take the railway train as their reference-body must therefore come to the conclusion"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30155"],["title","Relativity: The Special and General Theory (#4)"],["body","the lightning flash _B_ took place earlier than the lightning flash _A_. We thus arrive at the important result:  Events which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not simultaneous with respect to the train, and _vice versa_ (relativity of simultaneity). Every reference-body (co-ordinate system) has its own particular time; unless we are told the reference-body to which the statement of time refers, there is no meaning in a statement of the time of an event.  Now before the advent of the theory of relativity it had always tacitly been assumed in physics that the statement of time had an absolute significance, _i.e._ that it is independent of the state of motion of the body of reference. But we have just seen that this assumption is incompatible with the most natural definition of simultaneity; if we discard this assumption, then the conflict between the law of the propagation of light _in vacuo_ and the principle of relativity (developed in Section VII) disappears.  We were led to that conflict by the considerations of Section VI, which are now no longer tenable. In that section we concluded that the man in the carriage, who traverses the distance _w per second_ relative to the carriage, traverses the same distance also with respect to the embankment _in each second_ of time. But, according to the foregoing considerations, the time required by a particular occurrence with respect to the carriage must not be considered equal to the duration of the same occurrence as judged from the embankment (as reference-body). Hence it cannot be contended that the man in walking travels the distance _w_ relative to the railway line in a time which is equal to one second as judged from the embankment.  Moreover, the considerations of Section VI are based on yet a second assumption, which, in the light of a strict consideration, appears to be arbitrary, although it was always tacitly made even before the introduction of the theory of relativity.   X.  ON THE RELATIVITY OF THE CONCEPTION OF DISTANCE  Let us consider two particular points on the train [8] travelling along the embankment with the velocity _v_, and inquire as to their distance apart. We already know that it is necessary to have a body of reference for the measurement of a distance, with respect to which body the distance can be measured up. It is the simplest plan to use the train itself as reference-body (co-ordinate system). An observer in the train measures the interval by marking off his measuring-rod in a straight line (_e.g._ along the floor of the carriage) as many times as is necessary to take him from the one marked point to the other. Then the number which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down is the required distance.    [8] _e.g._ the middle of the first and of the hundredth carriage.   It is a different matter when the distance has to be judged from the railway line. Here the following method suggests itself. If we call _A′_ and _B′_ the two points on the train whose distance apart is required, then both of these points are moving with the velocity v along the embankment. In the first place we require to determine the points _A_ and _B_ of the embankment which are just being passed by the two points _A′_ and _B′_ at a particular time t—judged from the embankment. These points _A_ and _B_ of the embankment can be determined by applying the definition of time given in Section VIII. The distance between these points A and B is then measured by repeated application of the measuring-rod along the embankment.  _A priori_ it is by no means certain that this last measurement will supply us with the same result as the first. Thus the length of the train as measured from the embankment may be different from that obtained by measuring in the train itself. This circumstance leads us to a second objection which must be raised against the apparently obvious consideration of Section VI. Namely, if the man in the carriage covers the distance _w_ in a unit of time—_measured from the train_,—then this distance—_as measured from the embankment_ is not necessarily also equal to _w_.   XI.  THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION  The results of the last three sections show that the apparent incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle of relativity (Section VII) has been derived by means of a consideration which borrowed two unjustifiable hypotheses from classical mechanics; these are as follows:  (1) The time-interval (time) between two events is independent of the condition of motion of the body of reference.   (2) The space-interval (distance) between two points of a rigid body is independent of the condition of motion of the body of reference.   If we drop these hypotheses, then the dilemma of Section VII disappears, because the theorem of the addition of velocities derived in Section VI becomes invalid. The possibility presents itself that the law of the propagation of light _in vacuo_ may be compatible with the principle of relativity, and the question arises: How have we to modify the considerations of Section VI in order to remove the apparent disagreement between these two fundamental results of experience? This question leads to a general one. In the discussion of Section VI we have to do with places and times relative both to the train and to the embankment. How are we to find the place and time of an event in relation to the train, when we know the place and time of the event with respect to the railway embankment? Is there a thinkable answer to this question of such a nature that the law of transmission of light _in vacuo_ does not contradict the principle of relativity? In other words: Can we conceive of a relation between place and time of the individual events relative to both reference-bodies, such that every ray of light possesses the velocity of transmission _c_ relative to the embankment and relative to the train? This question leads to a quite definite positive answer, and to a perfectly definite transformation law for the space-time magnitudes of an event when changing over from one body of reference to another.  Before we deal with this, we shall introduce the following incidental consideration. Up to the present we have only considered events taking place along the embankment, which had mathematically to assume the function of a straight line. In the manner indicated in Section II we can imagine this reference-body supplemented laterally and in a vertical direction by means of a framework of rods, so that an event which takes place anywhere can be localised with reference to this framework. Similarly, we can imagine the train travelling with the velocity _v_ to be continued across the whole of space, so that every event, no matter how far off it may be, could also be localised with respect to the second framework. Without committing any fundamental error, we can disregard the fact that in reality these frameworks would continually interfere with each other, owing to the impenetrability of solid bodies. In every such framework we imagine three surfaces perpendicular to each other marked out, and designated as “co-ordinate planes” (“co-ordinate system”). A co-ordinate system _K_ then corresponds to the embankment, and a co-ordinate system _K′_ to the train. An event, wherever it may have taken place, would be fixed in space with respect to _K_ by the three perpendiculars _x, y, z_ on the co-ordinate planes, and with regard to time by a time value _t_. Relative to _K′, the same event_ would be fixed in respect of space and time by corresponding values _x′, y′, z′, t′_, which of course are not identical with _x, y, z, t_. It has already been set forth in detail how these magnitudes are to be regarded as results of physical measurements.  image002   Obviously our problem can be exactly formulated in the following manner. What are the values _x′, y′, z′, t′_, of an event with respect to _K′_, when the magnitudes _x, y, z, t_, of the same event with respect to _K_ are given? The relations must be so chosen that the law of the transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied for one and the same ray of light (and of course for every ray) with respect to _K_ and _K′_. For the relative orientation in space of the co-ordinate systems indicated in the diagram (Fig. 2), this problem is solved by means of the equations:  image003   _y′_ = _y_  _z′_ = _z_   image004   This system of equations is known as the “Lorentz transformation.”[9]    [9] A simple derivation of the Lorentz transformation is given in  Appendix I.   If in place of the law of transmission of light we had taken as our basis the tacit assumptions of the older mechanics as to the absolute character of times and lengths, then instead of the above we should have obtained the following equations:  _x′_ = _x_ – _vt_   _y′_ = _y_   _z′_ = _z_   _t′_ = _t_   This system of equations is often termed the “Galilei transformation.” The Galilei transformation can be obtained from the Lorentz transformation by substituting an infinitely large value for the velocity of light _c_ in the latter transformation.  Aided by the following illustration, we can readily see that, in accordance with the Lorentz transformation, the law of the transmission of light _in vacuo_ is satisfied both for the reference-body _K_ and for the reference-body _K′_. A light-signal is sent along the positive _x_-axis, and this light-stimulus advances in accordance with the equation  _x_ = _ct_,   _i.e._ with the velocity _c_. According to the equations of the Lorentz transformation, this simple relation between _x_ and _t_ involves a relation between _x′_ and _t′_. In point of fact, if we substitute for _x_ the value _ct_ in the first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation, we obtain:  image005   from which, by division, the expression  _x′_ = _ct′_   immediately follows. If referred to the system _K′_, the propagation of light takes place according to this equation. We thus see that the"]]]
