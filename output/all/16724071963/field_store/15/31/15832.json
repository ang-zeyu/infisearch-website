Things are so heavy here, somehow. So their first thought was to drive my enslaved people to the casting and laying of the metal squares and the metal beams that connect them, in order to make things weigh less.\"  \"But how do the plates function?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Greca did not know this, save vaguely. She tried to express her little knowledge of the scientific achievements of the savage Rogans. After some moments Brand turned to Dex and said:  \"As near as I can get it, the Rogans, by this peculiar red metal alloy, manage to trap and divert the permanent lines of force, the magnetic field, of Jupiter itself. So the whole red spot is highly magnetized, which somehow upsets natural gravitational attraction. I suppose it is responsible for the discoloration of the ground, too.\"  He turned to question the girl further about this, but she had got nervously to her feet already.  \"I'll be taken away soon,\" she said. \"I was brought in here only to urge you to eat the food. I must be interpreter, since the Rogans speak not with the mind, and I know their hateful tongue.\"  \"Why are they so anxious for us to eat?\" demanded Dex with an uneasy frown.  \"So you will be strong, and endure for a long time the--the ordeal they have in store for you,\" faltered the girl at last. \"They intend to force from you the secret of the power that drove your ship here, so they too may have command of space.\"  \"But I don't understand,\" frowned Brand. \"They must already have a means of space navigation. They came here to Jupiter from the satellites.\"  \"Their vessels are crude, clumsy things. The journey from the nearest satellite is the limit of their flying range. They have nothing like your wonderful little ships, and they want to know how to build and power them.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She gazed sorrowfully at them and went on: \"You see, yours is the fourth space ship to visit their kingdom; and that makes them fearful because it shows they are vulnerable to invasion. They want to stop that by invading your planet first. Besides their fear, there is their greed. Their looking-tubes reveal that yours is a fruitful and lovely sphere, and they are insatiable in their lust for new territories. Thus they plan to go to your planet as soon as they are able, and kill or enslave all the people there as they have killed and enslaved my race.\"  \"They'll have a job on their hands trying to do that!\" declared Dex stoutly.  But Brand paled. \"They can do it!\" he snapped. \"Look at those death-tubes of theirs. We have no arms to compete with that.\" He turned to Greca. \"So the Rogans plan to force the secret of our motors from us by torture?\"  She nodded, and caught his hand in hers.  \"Yes. They will do with you as they did with the six who came before you--and who died before surrendering the secret.\"  \"So! We know now what happened to Journeyman and the others!\" burst out Dex. \"I'll see 'em in hell before I'll talk!\"  \"And me,\" nodded Brand. \"But that doesn't cure the situation. As long as ships disappear in this red inferno, so long will the Old Man keep sending others to find out what's wrong. The Rogans will capture them as easily as they captured us. And eventually someone will happen along who'll weaken under torture. Then--\"         *       *       *       *       *  He stopped. A dread vision filled his mind of Earth depopulated by the feebly ferocious Rogans, of rank on rank of Earth's vast armies falling in stricken rows at the shock of the Rogans' tubes.  Greca caught the vision. She nodded. \"Yes, that is what would happen if they found ways of reaching your globe.\"  \"But, God, Brand, we can't allow that!\" cried Dex. \"We've got to find a way to spike the guns of these walking gas-pipes, somehow!\"  Brand sighed heavily. \"We are two against hundreds of thousands. We are bare-handed, and the Rogans have those damned tubes. Anyway, we are on the verge of death at this very moment. What under heaven can we do to spike their guns?\"  He was silent a moment: and in the silence the steady hum from the domed building outside came to his ears.  \"What's in that big, round topped building, Greca?\" he asked quietly.  \"I do not know, exactly,\" replied the girl. \"There is some sort of machinery in it, and to it go connecting beams from all the square metal plates everywhere. That is all I know.\"  Brand started to question her further, but her time was up. The two guards poked their loathsome pumpkin heads in the doorway and contemptuously beckoned her out. She answered resignedly, in the piping Rogan tongue, and went with them. But she turned to wave shyly, commiseratingly at the two men; and the expression in her clear blue eyes as they rested on Brand made his heart contract and then leap on with a mighty bound.  \"We have in ally in her,\" murmured Brand. \"Though God only knows if that will mean anything to us....\"     CHAPTER IV  _In the Tower_   \"What I can't figure out,\" said Dex, striding up and down the big bare room, \"is why we're needed to tell them about the atomic motor. They've got our ship, and three others besides. I should think they could learn about the motor just by taking it apart and studying it.\"  Brand grinned mirthlessly, recalling the three years of intensive study it had taken him to learn the refinements of atomic motive power. \"If you'd ever qualified as a space navigator, Dex, you'd know better. The Rogans are an advanced race; their control of polar magnetism and the marvelously high-powered telescopes Greca mentions prove that; but I doubt if they could ever analyze that atomic motor with no hint as to how it works.\"  Silence descended on them again, in which each was lost in his own thoughts.  How many hours had passed, the Earthmen did not know. They had spent the time in fruitless planning to escape from their tower room and go back to the ship again. Though how they could get away in the ship when the Rogans seemed able to propel it where-ever they wished against the utmost power of their motor, they did not attempt to consider.  One of Jupiter's short nights had passed, however--a night weirdly made as light as day by red glares from the plates, which seemed to store up sunlight, among their other functions--and the tiny sun had risen to slant into their window at a sharp angle.  Suddenly they heard the familiar drawing of the great bolts outside their door. It was opened, and a dozen or more of the Rogans came in, with Greca cowering piteously in their midst and attempting to communicate her distress to Brand.         *       *       *       *       *  At the head of the little band of Rogans was one the prisoners had not seen before. He was of great height, fully two feet taller than the others; and he carried himself with an air that proclaimed his importance.  The tall one turned to Greca and addressed a few high-pitched, squeaky words to her. She shook her head; whereupon, at a hissed command, two of the Rogans caught her by the wrists and dragged her forward.  \"They have come to question you,\" Greca lamented to Brand. \"And they want to do it through me. But I will not! I will not!\"  Brand smiled at her though his lips were pale.  \"You are powerless to struggle,\" he said. \"Do as they ask. You cannot help us by refusing, and, in any case, I can promise that they won't learn anything from us.\"  The tall Rogan teetered up to the prisoners on his gangling legs, and stared icily at them. Crouched beside him, her lovely body all one mute appeal to the Earthmen to forgive her for the part she was forced to play, was Greca.  At length the Rogan leader spoke. He addressed his sibilant words to Greca, though his stony eyes were kept intently on the Earthmen.  \"He says,\" exclaimed Greca telepathically, \"to inform you first that he is head of all the Rogan race on this globe, and that all on this globe must do as he commands.\"  Brand nodded to show he understood the message.  \"He says he is going to ask you a few questions, and that you are to answer truthfully if you value your lives:\"  \"First, he wants to know what the people of your world are like. Are they all the same as you?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dex started to reply to that; but Brand flung him a warning look. \"Tell him we are the least of the Earth people,\" he answered steadily. \"Tell him we are of an inferior race. Most of those on Earth are giants five times as large as we are, and many times more powerful.\"  Greca relayed the message in the whistling, piping Rogan tongue. The tall one stared, then hissed another sentence to the beautiful interpreter.  \"He wants to know,\" said Greca, \"if there are cities on your globe as large and complete as this one.\"  \"There are cities on Earth that make this look like a--a--\" Brand cast about for understandable similes--\"like a collection of animal burrows.\"  \"He says to describe your planet's war weapons,\" was the next interpretation. And here Brand let himself go.  With flights of fancy he hadn't known he was capable of, he described great airships, steered automatically and bristling with guns that discharged explosives powerful enough to kill everything within a range of a thousand miles. He told of billions of thirty-foot giants sheathed in an alloy that would make them invulnerable to any feeble rays the Rogans might have developed. He touched on the certain wholesale death that must overtake any hostile force that tried to invade the planet.  \"The Rogan shock-tubes are toys compared with the ray-weapons of Earth,\" he concluded. \"We have arms that can nullify the effects of yours and kill at the same instant. We have--\"  But here the Rogan leader turned impatiently away. Greca had been translating sentence by sentence. Now the tall one barked out a few syllables in a squeaky voice.  \"He says he knows you are lying,\" sighed Greca. \"For if you on Earth have tubes"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30214"],["title","The Red Hell of Jupiter (#5)"],["body"," effective than theirs why weren't you equipped with them on your expedition here to the red kingdom?\"  Brand bit his lips. \"Check,\" he muttered. \"The brute has a brain in that ugly head.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Rogan leader spoke for a long time then; and at each singsong word, Greca quivered as though lashed by a whip. At length she turned to Brand.  \"He has been telling what his hordes can do, answering your boasts with boasts of his own. His words are awful! I won't tell you all he said. I will only say that he is convinced his shock-tubes are superior to any Earth arms, and that he states he will now illustrate their power to you to quell your insolence. I don't know what he means by that....\"  But she and the Earthmen were soon to find out.  The Rogan leader stepped to the window and arrogantly beckoned Brand and Dex to join him there. They did; and the leader gazed out and down as though searching for something.  He pointed. The two Earthmen followed his leveled arm with their eyes and saw, a hundred yards or so away, a bent and dreary figure trudging down the metal paving of the street. It was a figure like those to be seen on Earth, which placed it as belonging to Greca's race.  The tall leader drew forth one of the shock-tubes. Seen near at hand, it was observed to be bafflingly simple in appearance. It seemed devoid of all mechanism--simply a tube of reddish metal with a sort of handle formed of a coil of heavy wire.  The Rogan pointed the tube at the distant figure.  Greca screamed, and screamed again. Coincident with her cry, as though the sound of it had felled him, the distant slave dropped to the pavement.         *       *       *       *       *  That was all. The tube had merely been pointed: as far as Brand could see, the Rogan's \"hand\" had not moved on the barrel of the tube, nor even constricted about the coil of wire that formed its handle. Yet that distant figure had dropped. Furthermore, fumes of greasy black smoke now began to arise from the huddled body; and in less than thirty seconds there was left no trace of it on the gleaming metal pavement.  \"So that's what those things are like at full power!\" breathed Dex. \"My God!\"  The Rogan leader spoke a few words. Greca, huddled despairingly on the floor, crushed by this brutal annihilation of one of her country-men before her very eyes, did not translate. But translation was unnecessary. The Rogan's icy, triumphant eyes, the very posture of his grotesque body, spoke for him.  \"That,\" he was certainly saying, \"is what will happen to any on your helpless planet who dare oppose the Rogan will!\"  He whipped out a command to the terror-stricken girl. She rose from her crouching position on the floor; and at length formulated the Rogan's last order:  \"You will explain the working of the engine that drove your space ship here.\"  Dex laughed. It was a short bark of sound, totally devoid of humor, but very full of defiance. Brand thrust his hands into the pockets of his tunic, spread his legs apart, and began to whistle.         *       *       *       *       *  A quiver that might have been of anger touched the Rogan leader's repulsive little mouth. He glared balefully at the uncowed Earthmen and spoke again, evidently repeating his command. The two turned their backs to him to indicate their refusal to obey.  At that, the tall leader pointed to Dex. In an instant three of the guards had wound their double pairs of arms around his struggling body. Brand sprang to help him, but a touch of the mysterious discharge from the leader's tube sent him writhing to the floor.  \"It's no use, Brand,\" said Dex steadily. He too had stopped struggling, and now stood quietly in the slimy coils of his captors' arms. \"I might as well go along with them and get it over with. I probably won't see you again. Good luck!\"  He was borne out of the room. The Rogan leader turned to Brand and spoke.  \"He says that if your comrade does not tell him what he wants to know, your turn will come next,\" sobbed Greca. \"Oh! Why does not The Great White One strike these monsters to the dust!\"  She ran to Brand and pressed her satiny cheek to his. Then she was dragged roughly away.  The great door clanged shut. The heavy outer fastenings clicked into place. Dex had gone to experience whatever it was that Journeyman and the rest had experienced in this red hell. And Brand was left behind to reflect on what dread torments this might comprise; and to pray desperately that no matter what might be done to his shrinking body he would be strong enough to refuse to betray his planet.     CHAPTER V  _The Torture Chamber_   Swiftly Dex was carried down the long ramp to the ground floor, the arms of his captors gripping him with painful tightness. Heading the procession was the immensely tall, gangling Rogan leader, clutching Greca by the wrist and dragging her indifferently along to be his mouthpiece.  They did not stop at the street level; they continued on down another ramp, around a bend, descending an even steeper incline toward the bowels of Jupiter. Their descent ended at last before a huge metal barrier which, at a signal from the leader, drew smoothly up into the ceiling to disclose a gigantic, red-lit chamber underlying the foundations of the building.  In fear and awe, Dex gazed around that huge room.  It resembled in part a nightmare rearrangement of such a laboratory as might be found on Earth; and in part a torture chamber such as the most ferocious of savages might have devised had they been scientifically equipped to add contrivances of supercivilization to the furthering of their primitive lust for cruelty.  There were great benches--head-high to the Earthman--to accommodate the height of the Rogan workmen. There were numberless metal instruments, and glass coils, and enormous retorts; and in one corner an orange colored flame burnt steadily on a naked metal plate, seeming to have no fuel or other source of being.  There was a long rack of cruelly pointed and twisted instruments. Under this was a row of long, delicate pincers, with coils on the handles to indicate that they might be heated to fiendish precision of temperatures. There were gleaming metal racks with calibrated slide-rods and spring dials to denote just what pull was being exerted on whatever unhappy creature might be stretched taut on them. There were tiny cones of metal whose warped, baked appearance testified that they were little portable furnaces that could be placed on any desired portion of the anatomy, to slowly bake the selected disk of flesh beneath them.         *       *       *       *       *  Dex shuddered; and a low moan came from Greca, whose clear blue eyes had rested on the contents of this vast room before in her capacity as hostage and interpreter for the inhuman Rogans.  And now another sense of Dex's began to register perception on his brain.  A peculiar odor came to his nostrils. It was a musky, fetid odor, like that to be smelled in an animal cage; but it was sharper, more acrid than anything he had ever smelled on Earth. It smelled--ah, he had it!--_reptilian_. As though somewhere nearby a dozen titanic serpents were coiled ready to spring!  Looking about, Dex saw a six-foot square door of bars in one wall of the laboratory--like the barred entrance to a prison cell. It was from the interstices of this door that the odor seemed to emanate; but he had no chance to make sure, for now the Rogan leader approached him.  \"I will first show you,\" he said, through his mouthpiece, Greca, \"what happens to those who oppose our orders. We have a slave who tried to run away into the surrounding jungles three suns ago....\"  A man was dragged into the chamber. He was slightly taller and more stockily muscled than an Earthman might be; but otherwise, in facial conformation and general appearance, he might have come here straight from New York City. Dex felt a great pang of sympathy for him. He was so plainly one of humankind, despite the fact that he had been born on a sphere four hundred million miles from Dex's.  The fellow was paralyzed with horror. His eyes, wide and glazed, darted about the torture room like those of a trapped animal. And yet he made no move to break away from the clutch of the two Rogans who held him. He knew he was helpless, that wild-eyed glance told Dex. Knew it so thoroughly that not even his wildest terror could inspire him to try to make a break for freedom, or strike back at the implacable Rogan will.         *       *       *       *       *  At a nod from the leader, the man was stripped to the waist. Here Dex started in amazement. The man's broad chest was seamed and crisscrossed by literally hundreds of tiny lateral scars, some long healed, and some fresh incisions.  He was dragged to a metal plate set upright in the wall, and secured to it by straps of metal. Evidently the miserable being knew what this portended, for he began to scream--a monotonous, high-pitched shriek that didn't stop till he was out of breath.  The Rogan leader stared at him icily, then depressed a small lever set in the wall beside him. The plate against which the captive was bound began to shine softly with a blue light. The slave twisted in his bonds, screaming again. Rhythmic shudders jerked at his limbs. His lips turned greenish white. The shudders grew more pronounced till it seemed as though he were afflicted with a sort of horrible St. Vitus dance. Then the tall Rogan pulled back the lever. The slave hung away from his supporting shackles, limp and unconscious.  Dex moistened his lips. An electric shock? No, it was something more terrible than that. Some other manifestation of the magnetic power the Rogans had harnessed--a current, perhaps, that depolarized partly the atoms of the body structure? He could only guess. But the convulsed face of the unfortunate victim showed that the torment, whatever it was, was devilish to the last degree!  \"That will be the next"]]]
