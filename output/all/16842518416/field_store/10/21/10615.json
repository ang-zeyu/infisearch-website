He can play a ripping good game when he likes, but then he does not always like. However, as I said, we will give him another trial.\"  Half an hour later the subject of the conversation arrived. He was in the first form on the classical side, and was going up at the next examination for Sandhurst. Easton was one of the monitors, but seldom asserted his authority or put himself out in any way to perform the duties of the office. He was dressed with scrupulous care, and no one from his appearance would have said that he had just come off a railway journey. He nodded all round in a careless way as he came in, and there was none of the boisterous friendliness that had marked the meeting of most of the others.  \"Affected ass!\" Skinner growled to Rupert who was next to him.  \"You are a prejudiced beggar, Skinner,\" Rupert laughed. \"You know very well he is not an ass, and I am not at all sure he is affected. I suppose it is the way he has been brought up. There is no saying what you might have been yourself if you had had nurses and people about you who always insisted on your turning out spick-and-span. Well, Easton, what have you been doing with yourself since we saw you last?\"  \"I have been on the Continent most of the time,\" Easton said, in the quiet, deliberate tone that was so annoying to Skinner. \"Spent most of the time in Germany: had a week at Munich, and the same time in Dresden doing the picture-gallery.\"  \"That must have been a treat,\" Skinner said sarcastically.  \"Yes, it was very pleasant. The worst of it is, standing about so long makes one's feet ache.\"  \"I wonder you did not have a bath-chair, Easton; delicate people go about in them, you know.\"  \"It would be a very pleasant way, Skinner, only I don't think I could bring myself to it.\"  There was a laugh at his taking Skinner's suggestion seriously.  \"What have you been doing, Skinner?\"  \"I have been up in Scotland climbing hills, and getting myself in good condition for football,\" Skinner replied shortly.  \"Ah, football? Yes, I suppose we shall be playing football this term.\"  There was another laugh, excited principally by the angry growl with which Skinner greeted this indifference to what was to him the principal feature of the year.  \"I shouldn't mind football,\" Easton went on, after looking round as if unable to understand what the others were laughing at, \"if it wasn't for the dirt. Of course it is annoying to be kicked in the shins and to be squeezed horribly in the greases, but it is the dirt I object to most. If one could but get one's flannels and jerseys properly washed every time it would not matter so much, but it is disgusting to have to put on things that look as if they had been rolled in mud.\"  \"I wonder you play at all, Easton,\" Skinner said angrily.  \"Well, I wonder myself sometimes,\" Easton said placidly. \"I suppose it is a relic of our original savage nature, when men did not mind dirt, and lived by hunting and fighting and that sort of thing.\"  \"And had never learned the nuisance of stiff shirts and collars, and never heard of such a thing as a tailor, and did not part their hair in the middle, Easton, and had never used soap,\" Skinner broke in.  \"No; it must have been beastly,\" Easton said gravely. \"I am very glad that I did not live in those days.\"  \"Ah, you would have suffered horribly if you had, wouldn't you?\"  \"Well, I don't know, Skinner; I suppose I should have done as other people did. If one does not know the comfort of a wash and a clean shirt, one would not miss it, you see. I have sometimes thought--\"  \"Oh, never mind what you thought,\" Skinner broke in out of all patience. \"Come, let us go for a walk; it is no use stopping here all this fine afternoon. Let us take a good long spin. I can see half you fellows are out of condition altogether, and the sooner we begin work the better. Will you come, Easton? After lolling about looking at pictures a twelve-mile spin will do you good.\"  \"Thank you, Skinner; I don't know that I want any good done to me. I should not mind a walk, if it is to be a walk; but a walk with you generally means rushing across ploughed fields and jumping into ditches, and getting one's self hot and uncomfortable, and splashing one's self from head to foot. It is bad enough in flannels, but it is downright misery in one's ordinary clothes. But I don't mind a game at rackets, if anyone is disposed for it.\"  \"I will play you,\" Mossop said. \"I want to get my hand in before the racket matches come off.\"  So they went and put on their flannels and racket shoes, while the rest of the party started for a long walk with Skinner.  \"I am glad he has not come,\" the football captain said as they started; \"he drives me out of all patience.\"  \"I don't think you have much to drive out of you, Skinner,\" Rupert Clinton laughed. \"I believe Easton puts about half of it on, on purpose to excite you. I am sure just now I saw a little amusement in his face when he was talking so gravely.\"  \"He will find he has got in the wrong box,\" Skinner said angrily, \"if he tries to chaff me.\"  A quiet smile was exchanged among the others, for Easton was tall and well built and had the reputation of being the best boxer in the school; and although Skinner was tough and wiry, he would have stood no chance in an encounter with him.  \"Well, how did you get on, Mossop?\" Scudamore asked as they sat down to tea.  \"Easton beat me every game. I had no idea that he was so good. He says he does not intend to play for the racket, but if he did he would have a first-rate chance. I was in the last ties last year and I ought to have a good chance this, but either I am altogether out of practice or he is wonderfully good. I was asking him, and he said in his lazy way that they had got a decent racket-court at his place, and that he had been knocking the balls about a bit since he came home.\"  \"If he is good enough to win,\" Pinkerton, the captain of the house, said, \"he ought to play for the honour of the house. He has never played in any matches here before. I did not know he played at all.\"  \"That is the way with Easton,\" Edgar Clinton said; \"he is good all round, only he never takes trouble to show it. He could have been in the college cricket eleven last year if he liked, only he said he could not spare the time. Though Skinner doesn't think so, I believe he is one of the best in our football team; when he chooses to exert himself he is out and out the best chess player in the house; and I suppose he is safe to pass in high for Sandhurst.\"  \"He is a queer fellow,\" Pinkerton said, \"one never knows what he can do and what he can't. At the last exam Glover said that the papers he sent in were far and away the best, but that he had only done the difficult questions and hadn't sent in any answers at all to the easy ones, so that instead of coming in first he was five or six down the list. I believe myself he did not want to beat me, because if he had he would have been head of the house, and that would have been altogether too much trouble for him. Glover wanted him to go up for the last Indian Civil, and told him he was sure that he could get in if he tried, but Easton said he wasn't fond of heat and had no fancy for India.\"  \"I suppose he was afraid to take the starch out of his collars,\" Edgar laughed. \"Ah! here he is; late as usual.\"  Easton strolled quietly in and took his place, looking annoyingly fresh and clean by the side of those who had accompanied Skinner on his walk, and who, in spite of vigorous use of clothes brushes, showed signs of cross-country running.  \"Have you had a pleasant walk?\" he asked calmly.  \"Very pleasant,\" Skinner said, in a tone that defied contradiction. \"A delightful walk; just the thing for getting a little into condition.\"  There was a murmur of assent among the boys who had accompanied him, but there was no great heartiness in the sound; for indeed Skinner had pressed them all to a much higher rate of speed than was pleasant in their ordinary clothes, although they would not have minded it in flannels.  \"You all look as if you had enjoyed it,\" Easton said, regarding them one by one with an air of innocent approval; \"warmed yourselves up a bit, I should say. I remark a general disappearance of collars, and Rupert Clinton's face is scratched as if he had been having a contest with some old lady's cat.\"  \"I went head-foremost into a hedge,\" Rupert laughed. \"My foot slipped in the mud just as I was taking off, and I took a regular header into it.\"  \"And what is the matter with your hand, Wordsworth?\"  \"A beast of a dog bit me. We were going across a field, and the brute came out from a farmhouse. My wind had gone, and I happened to be last and he made at me. Some fool has written in a book that if you keep your eyes fixed upon a dog he will never bite you. I fixed my eye on him like a gimlet but it did not act, and he came right at me and sprang at me and knocked me down and got my hand in his mouth, and I don't know what would have happened if Skinner hadn't pulled a stick out of the hedge, and rushed back and hit him such a lick across the back that he went off yelping. Then the farmer let fly with a double-barrelled gun from his garden; but luckily we were pretty well out of reach, though two or three shots hit Scudamore on the cheek and ear and pretty nearly drew blood. He wanted to go back to fight the farmer, but as the fellow would have reloaded by the time he got there, and there was the dog into the bargain, we lugged him off.\"  \"Quite an adventurous afternoon,\" Easton said in a tone of cordial admiration, which elicited a growl from Skinner.  \"You wish you had been with us, don't you?\" he said, with what was meant to be a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21986"],["title","The Dash for Khartoum: A Tale of the Nile Expedition (#6)"],["body",".  \"No, rackets was quite hard work enough for me; and I don't see much fun in either taking a header into a hedge, being bitten by a farmer's dog, or being peppered by the man himself. Still, no doubt these things are pleasant for those who like them. What has become of Templar?\"  \"He fell into a ditch,\" Wordsworth said; \"and he just was in a state. He had to go up to the matron for a change of clothes. He will be here in a minute, I expect.\"  \"Quite a catalogue of adventures. If I had known beforehand that there was going to be so much excitement I might have been tempted to go with you. I am afraid, Mossop, I have kept you out of quite a good thing.\"  \"There, shut up Easton!\" Pinkerton said, for he saw that Skinner was at the point of explosion; \"let us have peace and quiet this first night. You have got the best of it, there is no doubt. Skinner would admit that.\"  \"No I wouldn't,\" Skinner interrupted.  \"Never mind whether you would or not, Skinner, it clearly is so. Now, let us change the conversation. For my part I cannot make out why one fellow cannot enjoy football and that sort of thing, and another like to lie on his back in the shade, without squabbling over it. If Skinner had his own way he would never sit quiet a minute, if Easton had his he would never exert himself to walk across the room. It is a matter of taste. I like half and half, but I do not want to interfere with either of your fancies. Now, it is about time to set to work. I expect there are a good many holiday tasks not perfect.\"  There was a chorus of assent, and the senior boys went off to their private studies, and the juniors to the large study, where they worked under the eye of the house-master.  Skinner's mournful anticipations as to the effect of the want of weight in the football team were speedily verified. The trial matches were almost all lost, the team being fairly borne down by the superior weight of their opponents. There was general exasperation at these disasters, for River-Smith's House had for some years stood high, and to be beaten in match after match was trying indeed. Skinner took the matter terribly to heart, and was in a chronic state of disgust and fury. As Easton observed to Edgar Clinton:  \"Skinner is becoming positively dangerous. He is like a Scotch terrier with a sore ear, and snaps at every one who comes near him.\"  \"Still it is annoying,\" Edgar, who thoroughly sympathized with Skinner, said.  \"Well, yes, it is annoying. I am annoyed myself, and it takes a good deal to annoy me. I think we ought to do some thing.\"  \"Well, it seems to me that we have been doing all we can,\" Edgar said. \"I am sure you have, for it was only yesterday Skinner was holding you up as an example to some of us. He said, 'You ought all to be ashamed of yourselves. Why, look at that lazy beggar Easton, he works as hard as the whole lot of you put together. If it was not for him I should say we had better chuck it altogether.'\"  \"I observe that Skinner has been a little more civil to me lately,\" Easton said. \"Yes, I do my best. I object to the whole thing, but if one does play one does not like being beaten. I think we had better have a talk over the matter together.\"  \"But we are always talking over the matter,\" Edgar objected. \"All the fellows who had a chance of turning out well have been tried, and I am sure we play up well together. Every one says that we are beaten just because we cannot stand their rushes.\"  That afternoon the house was badly beaten by the Greenites in the trial match, and as there was a special rivalry between Green's and River-Smith's the disgust not only of the members of the team but of the whole house was very great. Seven of the seniors met after tea in Skinner's study to discuss the situation.  \"I don't see any thing to be done,\" Skinner said, after various possible changes in the team had been discussed; \"it is not play we want, it is weight. The Greenites must average at least a stone and a half heavier than we do. I have nothing to say against the playing. We simply cannot stand against them; we go down like nine-pins. No, I suppose we shall lose every match this season. But I don't see any use in talking any more about it. I suppose no one has anything further to suggest.\"  \"Well, yes, I have a few words to say,\" Easton, who had been sitting on the table and had hitherto not opened his lips, remarked in a quiet voice.  \"Well, say away.\"  \"It seems to me,\" Easton went on without paying any regard to the snappishness of Skinner's tone, \"that though we cannot make ourselves any heavier, weight is not after all the only thing. I think we might make up for it by last. When fellows are going to row a race they don't content themselves with practice, they set to and train hard. It seems to me that if we were to go into strict training and get ourselves thoroughly fit, it ought to make a lot of difference. We might lose goals in the first half of the play, but if we were in good training we ought to get a pull in the second half. By playing up all we knew at first, and pumping them as much as possible, training ought to tell. I know, Skinner, you always said we ought to keep ourselves in good condition; but I mean more than that, I mean strict training--getting up early and going for a three or four mile run every morning, taking another run in the afternoon, cutting off pudding and all that sort of thing, and going in for it heart and soul. It is no use training unless one does a thing thoroughly.\"  \"Well, one could but try,\" Skinner said. \"There is no reason why one shouldn't train for football just as one does for rowing or running. You are the last fellow I should have expected to hear such a proposal from, Easton, but if you are ready to do it I am sure every one else will be.\"  There was a cordial exclamation of assent from the others.  \"Well, of course it will be a horrible nuisance,\" Easton said regretfully; \"but if one does go in for a thing of this sort it seems to me that it must be done thoroughly. And besides, it is very annoying just at the ticklish point of a game, when you would give anything to be able to catch the fellow ahead of you with the ball, to find that your lungs have given out, and that you haven't a cupful of wind left.\"  \"I believe, Easton, that you are a downright humbug,\" Scudamore said; \"and that while you pretend to hate anything like exertion, you are just as fond of it as Skinner is.\"  \"Well, at any rate,\" Skinner broke in, \"we will try Easton's suggestion. From to-night the team shall go into strict training. I will see River-Smith now and get leave for us to go out at six o'clock every morning. We will settle about the afternoon work afterwards. Of course pudding must be given up, and there must be no buying cakes or things of that sort. New bread and potatoes must be given up, and we must all agree never to touch anything to drink between meals. We will try the thing thoroughly. It will be a month before we play our next match with Green's. If we can but beat them I do not care so much about the others. There are two or three houses we should have no chance with if we were to train as fine as a university eight.\"  The rest of the team were at once informed of the determination that had been arrived at. Had it emanated only from Skinner several of the members might have protested against the hardship of going into training for football, but the fact that Easton had proposed it weighed with them all. If he was ready to take such trouble over the matter no one else could reasonably object, and the consequence was that, although not without a good deal of grumbling at being got up before daylight, the whole team turned out in their flannels and two thick jerseys punctually at six o'clock.  \"Here is an egg and half cupful of milk for each of you,\" Skinner said as they gathered below. \"Look sharp and beat up your egg with the milk. Here is a mouthful of biscuit for each. River-Smith said he did not like our going out without taking something before we started, and Cornish, who rowed in the trials at Cambridge, told me that egg and milk was the best thing to take.\"  Five minutes later, comforted by the egg and milk, the party started.  \"We don't want to go at racing speed,\" Skinner said; \"merely a good steady trot to make the lungs play. We don't want to pull ourselves down in weight. I don't think, after the last month's work, we have any fat among us. What we want is wind and last. To-morrow we will turn out with the heaviest boots we have got instead of running shoes. When we can run four miles in them, we ought to be able to keep up pretty fairly through the hardest game of football.\"  There was a good deal of lagging behind towards the last part of the run, a fact that Skinner pointed out triumphantly as a proof of want of condition, but after a wash and change of clothes all the party agreed that they felt better for the run.  Mr. River-Smith was as much concerned as the boys at the defeats of the house at football, and when they sat down to breakfast the members of the team found that a mutton-chop was provided for each of them. Strict orders had been issued that nothing was to be said outside the house of the football team going into training; and as, for the afternoon's exercise, it was only necessary that every member of the team should take part in football practice, and play up to the utmost, the matter remained a secret. In the first two or three matches played the training made no apparent difference.  \"You must not be disheartened at that,\" Mr. Cornish, who was the \"housemaster,\" told them. \"Fellows always get weak when they first begin to train. You will find the benefit presently.\"  And this was the case. They won the fourth match, which was against a comparatively weak team. This, however, encouraged them, and they were victorious in the next two contests, although in the second their opponents were considered a strong team, and their victory had been"]]]
