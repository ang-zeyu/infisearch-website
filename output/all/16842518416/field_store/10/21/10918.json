For some months he had been paying marked attention to Miss Holland, whom he had known in a general way for a long time, and, while she did not encourage him, she had not thought it necessary to dismiss him, for she found him most entertaining, as he was regarded as one of the best non-professional violinists in New York. They had spent many agreeable evenings together over their music, she playing the accompaniments on the piano.  His views on public questions were as set and conservative as were his views on medicine, and she never attempted to discuss those matters with him; the fact that she could not do so was somewhat a relief to her when she desired to get away from her public activities.  Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, Dr. Morris and Miss Holland, and the two young men with other ladies of their acquaintance, joined in the last dance and then started for the cloakrooms together.     CHAPTER V  HYPNOTISM USED FOR AN ANÆSTHETIC   Mrs. Ramsey and Miss Holland emerged from the dressing-rooms after a trifling delay, and found Hilda's party and Dr. Morris waiting in the foyer. Just as they were about making their way to their respective motors they heard a sudden commotion and wild cries from the street, and a crowd of people surged in, crying that a child had been killed by an automobile. Both Dr. Earl and Dr. Morris rushed toward the street as a man came in carrying a little girl of perhaps ten years of age, bleeding profusely from the mouth and the scalp, with one leg evidently broken. The mother of the child, a comely woman of thirty, followed, wringing her hands. Her excitement verged on hysteria, but at the sight of Dr. Morris she controlled herself by a mighty effort.  \"To the hospital, to the hospital, Dr. Earl,\" peremptorily exclaimed Dr. Morris, as Dr. Earl threw aside his coat and, rolling back his sleeves and directing the man to place the child on a table in one of the ante-rooms, began to examine the character of the injuries.  \"Oh, don't take my poor child to the hospital. I know she will die if she goes there; bring her home; it is only a few blocks,\" the mother pleaded with Dr. Morris, whom she seemed to know.  \"Don't waste time here. Where is the telephone? I will call an ambulance immediately.\"  \"I don't want her taken to the hospital,\" said the woman sullenly.  \"This is no place to operate on a hysterical child,\" Morris answered. \"She need not be kept in the hospital, but she should certainly be taken there. I know Dr. Earl will agree with me.\"  In the meantime, Earl had completed his examination. Silvia Holland was watching him anxiously. As Morris spoke he looked up and caught her eye.  \"It is only a simple fracture, and the scalp wounds are slight. I suppose we could get along, if we can get hot water and the necessary appliances,\" he said dubiously, and then added, turning to the woman, \"Dr. Morris is quite right, madame, in advising the hospital, and I assure you there is no danger.\"  The woman turned pleading eyes to Silvia. \"She's all I have, and I can't let her be taken away from me. Couldn't we go home? It is only a few blocks away, and I know I can make her comfortable. Oh, please, please don't let them take her away!\"  Miss Holland looked at Dr. Earl and put her arm around the woman protectingly. \"If it isn't any worse than that,\" she said hesitatingly, \"don't you think you could do as she asks? Setting a simple fracture isn't a very complicated operation, is it?\"  Earl smiled. \"Oh, no,\" he said, \"it can be done in a comparatively few minutes.\"  \"Then why not do it,\" she said, \"and spare the mother all this protracted agony, and get the child home?\"  \"Because there are no appliances here to administer an anæsthetic or do anything else properly,\" answered Morris impatiently, \"and no one can tell from a cursory examination whether or not there are other injuries, to say nothing of the danger from septicæmia if the work is done in a clumsy, slipshod manner.\"  Earl colored, and Miss Holland replied with some spirit that even the absence of the usual accessories need not imply clumsiness of method, and again asked Earl if he could not manage where they were. He turned to the mother.  \"If you insist upon it, I have no doubt that I can do all that is necessary without bad results. As to the anæsthetic, we can dispense with that.\"  \"I will have nothing to do with the case under these circumstances,\" Morris said angrily.  The woman hesitated, and then said firmly, \"I should prefer the other gentleman to take charge. I won't have her taken to the hospital.\"  \"Very well,\" said Earl, and taking a notebook from his pocket he wrote out a list of necessary appliances, bandages, alcohol, antiseptic solutions, surgeon's scissors, needles, silk and thread, and giving it to Frank bade him hurry to the drug-store around the corner which carried surgical supplies and procure them, and also to bring a box that would do for splints.  \"I must have an assistant,\" he said, and without a word, Miss Holland improvised an apron from some of the bunting that was in evidence everywhere, and put herself at his disposal. He sent all the others out of the room, and bent over the child for a few minutes. What did he do? Miss Holland watched, but could not tell. The moaning ceased, the little limbs relaxed, and the child fell into a quiet sleep.  The mother stood just outside the door, listening with strained attention, and after two or three impatient turns about the foyer, Morris joined her.  \"You can do as you please so far as I am concerned,\" he said in a low tone, \"but I warn you that you are taking big risks. Allie is nervous and excitable at any time, and to-night she is close to hysterics, and she won't get over the shock of even a simple operation in a hurry, especially if he is fool enough to attempt it without an anæsthetic.\"  The woman wavered for a moment, and then turned away without a word, and shrugging his shoulders Morris strode down toward the entrance. A moment later Silvia Holland came out of the ante-room.  \"You can go in now,\" she said, \"only don't disturb your child; she is sleeping and you must be very quiet. Did you see Dr. Morris? Oh, there he is.\"  Mindful of the amenities of life, she hurried to his side. His face was dark with something more than anger, and did not lighten as she laid the tips of her fingers on his arm.  \"I know you will excuse me, Orrin,\" she said gently. \"You mustn't be angry with me, but I really feel as if I ought to see this through; the poor woman needs me. You will forgive me?\"  He looked at her with sudden passion. \"Oh, yes, I forgive _you_,\" he said, with unmistakable emphasis on the pronoun, and was gone. Silvia Holland looked after him for a moment, conscious that, accustomed as she was to his moods, this was quite a new one, and then joined Dr. Earl, who had come into the foyer to say goodnight to the Ramseys and Frank Earl, who had returned with the surgical appliances and found nothing more that he could do. \"By the way, old man,\" Dr. Earl called to his brother-in-law, \"send the machine back if you don't mind,\" and with a word of thanks he re-entered the ante-room, followed by Miss Holland, and closed the door against further interruption.  There was a sink in the room, with hot and cold water, and he directed Miss Holland to cleanse the basin and implements in the boiling water, and follow this up by dipping them in an antiseptic solution; in the meantime he ripped the box to pieces, and selected two strips, which he whittled into splints, shaping them to the child's leg, and working with great rapidity. The bandages, cotton and other things were laid out upon the table, and then he took the basin and a cloth and washed the wounds on the head, putting back the tousled locks as carefully and tenderly as a woman.  \"Ordinarily,\" he said to his assistant, \"I should have done this first, but my examination showed that this injury is very slight. Of course she has bled profusely, but it has come from the nose, and it looks pretty bad, but there is nothing serious. Half a dozen stitches will be ample for the scalp. Thread that needle with the silk, please. Now let me have it.\" He took it from her, and in a moment the cuts on the head were sewed, and he was pulling the leg into place, applying the cotton, the splints and bandages, working deftly and silently. \"The other needle with the thread, please,\" he said, not looking up, and Miss Holland handed it to him. Presently he raised his head and threw back his shoulders.  \"It is all done,\" he said simply, and called the mother. \"I shall return in a quarter of an hour,\" he said, \"and bring her out of this sleep. Do not try to rouse her, for you cannot. Do you not think, Miss Holland, that it would be well for me to get a nurse to assist in taking the little one home? I can 'phone when I return these instruments.\"  \"Your machine is coming back, isn't it?\" Miss Holland answered. \"It seems to me that with what help her mother and I can render that we shall manage.\"  \"Excellently,\" he said. \"Then you will be on guard until my return; see that the child is not disturbed. I shall be gone but a few minutes.\"  He readjusted his attire, and taking up his hat strode out of the building, unconscious until he reached the door that half a dozen energetic reporters were eagerly asking particulars. Finding him unwilling to tell them anything more than the vaguest generalities, the more resourceful returned to the improvised operating-room, and before Silvia Holland knew it they had the story from her enthusiastic lips, supplemented by a few facts gathered from the woman. For thus are first-page sensations secured and created.  Silvia noticed that the woman spoke with visible reluctance, and she herself passed over the controversy between Dr. Morris and Dr. Earl, anxious to spare her friend any unnecessary annoyance.  \"I am sorry, Mrs. Bell,\" she said contritely. \"I didn't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22285"],["title","An American Suffragette (#6)"],["body","at first that we were being interviewed.\"  \"Oh, there is no harm done,\" the woman said quietly. \"I hope the doctor will not mind; won't he be back pretty soon?\"  Almost as she spoke, his tall form was seen making its way through the besieging ranks of the Fourth Estate. He waved them aside good humoredly, but refusing to be interviewed, he took the child in his strong arms and, followed by her mother and Miss Holland, made his way to the auto. While she was in a profound sleep when he returned, she wakened instantly when he commanded her to do so, and the cool night air evidently refreshed her greatly as they drove to Mrs. Bell's home. Dr. Earl carried the little one upstairs, gave her mother explicit directions, and promising to call early the following day to adjust a cast, left the apartment with Miss Holland.     CHAPTER VI  SOME STRENUOUS ANTI-SUFFRAGISTS   Several of the New York papers carried lurid headlines and more or less sensational accounts of the accident to the child and the treatment administered by Dr. Earl, as well as a tribute to the heroism of the volunteer nurse. All of them contained a report of some character of these occurrences.  When Dr. Earl called at the home of his fiancée, according to appointment, to take her and her mother to luncheon the next day, he found Leonora in a sullen mood, and it did not take him long to discover that he was not in high favor at this particular hour.  He greeted her with a kiss, but hers in return was perfunctory. He was not compelled to wait long for an explanation, for she poured out her feelings without any questioning.  \"Oh, Jack, dear, how could you mix up with that suffrage crowd! Don't you know that mamma is vice-president of the Anti-Woman Suffrage League? She is so annoyed! And that horrid Silvia Holland--why, Jack, she is a downright socialist. Don't you know she was arrested in England for trying to break into parliament with a lot of other suffragettes, and she was arrested here only last month for defying the police and taking sides with a lot of girls who refused to work in the factories where they were employed! Even when in school she was horrid. When they wouldn't let her make a suffrage speech on the school grounds one night she took the girls to a neighboring graveyard and spoke from a flat monument! And to think the papers have you mixed up with her, and our wedding soon to be announced! Oh, it's terrible!\" and she buried her face in the sofa pillows.  Had this scene occurred with any one else, Jack felt certain he could not have restrained his laughter, for he could see Miss Holland delivering an exhortation to the schoolgirls from a tombstone in a cemetery by night. But he understood the prejudices of a certain element of New York society, and while the past twenty-four hours had led him, somewhat, to believe that this progressive democratic wave sweeping over the world had engulfed all New Yorkers, he now realized how sadly mistaken he had been.  With infinite tact he told her that his sister had taken their party to the ball--pointed out his own duty when the injured child had been brought in from the street, and how he had not even suggested that Miss Holland should assist him. He saw that the present was no time for a discussion of the merits of the case or a pronouncement of his own views, but he distinctly realized, with something of a jolt, it is true, that a wide gulf separated the Bourbon element of America's supposed democracy from the advancing column of her real and inspired democracy, and he wondered whether it were at all possible to tunnel under or bridge over this gulf. He lightly changed the subject.  \"I have just discovered that I can get my old offices on East 53rd Street, as the year's lease expires the first of next month, and the agents heeded my letter asking them to wait for me. So I shall feel quite at home in the old quarters,\" he said.  She smiled at this, but was not quite ready to drop the former subject. \"Jack, dear, did you take Miss Holland home at one o'clock in the morning?\"  He laughed at her this time, as he bent to kiss her. \"I really believe you are jealous, you little nymph. Of course I took her home. She could not stay there all night, and there was no one else to take her.\"  She looked very serious. \"No, I don't know what jealousy is,\" she slowly and emphatically said, \"but I don't want to know people who do the things that Miss Holland does, and I don't want you to know them.\"  \"My dear child,\" he said, taking her hands in his and catching her eyes with his own steady glance. \"I must know whoever is thrown into my path either in a professional or a social way. All people are intensely interesting to me, for we are, after all, but one great family of human beings, trying to carve out lives that are worth while, and this we can do better by getting the best there is from each other.\" He hesitated a moment, still looking steadily at her. She quivered slightly, but he was dimly conscious of the colossal character of the will she was summoning to her aid. Then very slowly, but with all the earnestness of his nature, he added, \"You must get away from these views, for they are dwarfing and not becoming to you, and if you do not we shall be very unhappy. Miss Holland is a remarkable young woman. She is destined to fill a great place in our American social and political life. She is well worthy of your friendship.\"  She withdrew her hands, but still kept her eyes fixed on his. Her brow contracted and with emphasis she said: \"Miss Holland has forfeited her place in our set by her conduct; why, Jack, you don't know how she is criticized by our friends or you would not suggest such a thing.\"  He arose with a shrug of his shoulders. Fortunately, Mrs. Kimball appeared at this moment and they motored to the Plaza for luncheon, which was a somewhat formal and unsatisfactory affair, in spite of all his efforts to make it otherwise. The young man could not but feel that Mrs. Kimball shared her daughter's views--was, in fact, their author--and that in the eyes of his future mother-in-law he had been guilty of a breach of etiquette far more serious than an infraction of the moral law. He left them with the understanding that he would accompany them to the theatre in the evening.     CHAPTER VII  CHRISTIAN SCIENCE AND SURGERY   The days of a militant suffragette are full to overflowing, and Silvia Holland was not able to see Mrs. Bell and her little daughter early the following morning as she had planned. It must have been well toward the middle of the afternoon when she entered the modest apartment, and going to the bed, visible in the alcove, kissed the child and put a great, dewy bunch of violets in her hand. She took them, and hugged them tight in her thin little arms, while her eyes looked into Silvia's wonderingly, and her mother turned away to hide the sudden tears.  The apartment was well though not expensively furnished, and both mother and child had the unmistakable air of good birth and refinement. As Silvia glanced at Mrs. Bell she was conscious of something in her face at once baffling and appealing. She had the indefinable look of one who dwells with a sorrow for which there is no cure.  \"Are you quite sure there is nothing I can do for either of you to-day?\" Silvia asked, a trifle diffidently, for she did not want to offend by overzeal.  \"You and Dr. Earl have placed us under so many obligations that we can never hope to repay them,\" Mrs. Bell said quietly. \"If I do not speak more freely of what I feel, it is because I have no words for its expression.\"  \"Don't speak or think of obligations,\" Silvia said lightly, \"and here is my card, so that if at any time I might be of service to you I hope you will not hesitate to call on me. I live at the Whittier Studios.\" The card which she gave Mrs. Bell read:                              SILVIA HOLLAND,                     Attorney and Counsellor-at-Law,                         City Investment Building,                             New York City.  Mrs. Bell looked at it curiously. \"Oh, it isn't possible that you are _that_ Miss Holland, _the_ Miss Holland!\" she said incredulously.  Silvia laughed. \"Don't I look as if I could say 'Gentlemen of the jury' with sufficient gravity?\" she said. \"Probably I shall do better when we say 'Ladies of the jury,' too.\"  \"You look like what you are, a beautiful and fashionable lady,\" Mrs. Bell answered. \"Surely no one would ever take you for a professional woman.\"  \"Must a fashionable lady be a listless parasite? Even if she wishes merely to be a queen of society, would she not be more queenly if she knew the trials and afflictions of others, and, better still, knew how to help them? Would she be less a queen if she were not dependent upon some man for her daily bread----\"  A sudden flash of something, she could not tell whether it was pain or rebellion or despair, crossed Mrs. Bell's face, and Silvia hesitated and then went on rather hurriedly, as if, knowing she had struck a false note, she sought to distract the other woman's thought from it. \"I am trying to demonstrate the glorious mission that belongs to woman when she fills her predestined sphere of economic independence and political freedom.\"  \"Political freedom will come first and easiest,\" said the woman slowly. She raised her eyes, filled with trouble, and looked full into Silvia's. \"The other is the greater boon, and will be harder to win. Some day I may need to consult a lawyer; there is no one I would so gladly trust; it is a personal matter and may adjust itself, if not----\"  \"If not, telephone to make sure that I am in, and I shall be glad to see you at any time,\" answered Silvia.  There was the sound of a quick, firm step in the hall, and the bell rang. Mrs. Bell opened the door and admitted Dr. Earl. After a few questions and the exchange of greetings, he went over to the bedside of his small patient. He found the child doing admirably, and glanced "]]]
