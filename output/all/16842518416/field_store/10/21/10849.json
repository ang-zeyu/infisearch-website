I've a hunch you killed that sphere.\"  \"I've thought of that, but how could I? I didn't touch him.\"  \"Maybe you don't have to touch 'em to kill 'em. We don't know what they are, except they're different--\"  \"We don't know the real natures of anything, as far as that goes. Man's a mixture of chemicals, but that doesn't explain him. The spheres are a mixture of energies--we can observe that much, but it still doesn't explain them. Where are they from? Why did they come here? What are their primary objectives?\"  \"Primary objectives? That's a military term, ain't it?\"  \"Partly military, and partly scientific. We know the secondary objective of the spheres. It's the same as man's or any other living creature. The spheres are alive and their objective is to keep on living, but that isn't their primary motif. The primary objective is the difference between a good man and a bad one. Whatever is more important to a man than life itself is his primary objective.\"  \"Life's pretty important,\" Masters said, solemnly.  \"Yes, but life isn't everything. Any man, no matter how yellow or mean he is, has some ideal he's willing to die for--or at least he's willing to risk dying to attain. Look at Norden. He's hard, cold-blooded and he doesn't think twice about putting a bomb in a plant to wipe out scores of lives. He dared me to kill him, rather than help us. His code as a spy is his primary objective. Look at Pember. He must have been frightened by the spheres, but we had to force him to leave his post. We've shown him that his duty now is with us--he realizes that the spheres are the immediate enemy of his country and he'll do his best fighting them. And you and I have ideals--we know each other too well to list them.\"  \"I getcha so far, but what about Orkins?\"  \"The man's not afraid of death, but afraid of the unknown. Men like him commit suicide rather than face reality. He wants security. He's afraid of uncertainty. He lives in an unreal, imaginary world and when uncertainty, which is reality, intrudes, he is completely lost.\"  \"You make me feel sorry for the poor devil.\"  \"That's because you understand why he's funky. Primary objectives make men do what they do--but understanding Orkins doesn't solve our problem.\"  \"No. What are the spheres? Are they alive? If so, they must want something. What do they want?\"  \"A conquest of the human race?\" Taylor pondered. \"Maybe. But it isn't likely. They can't gain much by conquering us. It wouldn't do man any good to stage a conquest of earthworms and swordfish, since neither could pay taxes. The spheres are as different from man as man from an angle-worm. Are we a menace to the spheres? Apparently the only time we really menace them is when we crawl into a hole like a rabbit--maybe there's something in that that will help us, but I don't think that's why they kill us. Are we a nuisance? If so, why? Are we a food? There is energy in sunlight and chemicals in the human body. A creature of energy would feed on something like sunlight, not chemicals. His menu would be electric wires, storage batteries--\"  \"Great Scott, Captain!\" Masters interrupted. \"Let's get away from this car. There's a battery in it--food for the spheres!\"  Masters looked nervously up at the circling globes. Taylor, deep in thought, did not stir. Instead, he continued his speculation:  \"Maybe they kill us for sport.\"  He was thinking of small boys torturing frogs; of Roman emperors at the circus; of sportsmen exterminating game; of the mob watching the guillotine on the streets of Paris. It was Zarathustra who said that when gazing at tragedies, bull fights and crucifixions, man has felt his happiest; and when man invented hell, he made hell his heaven on earth. Couldn't this be a characteristic of all life? Couldn't the spheres be cruel and ruthless, too?  Man, the mighty hunter, had become the prey.  A sphere detached itself from the group and circled toward the car.  \"I guess you're right, Masters,\" Taylor decided as he watched the spheres. \"We'd better move.\"     CHAPTER IV  PREY   Masters unlocked the handcuffs of the two men in the car. He disposed of his short-wave set in a ditch, for it, too, had batteries which might attract the spheres.  \"Get out of the car, Orkins,\" he ordered.  \"Watch him, Masters,\" Taylor warned. \"If he starts yelling, choke him.\"  \"But not too hard,\" Masters added. \"If we're going to be rabbits, human values will change. Men who run into holes will live to eat turnips, those who bare their teeth won't. Orkins might be the forefather of a new race--a helluva race. Come on, Orkins. Get out. Hurry up, Father Abraham, or I'll drag you out.\"  Orkins, cringing, emerged.  Taylor took charge of Norden, who followed Orkins out of the machine.  \"I hate your guts, Norden,\" he said. \"You're a dirty, lousy rat and you ought to be shot. But after all, you're a man. You've courage and I admire it, as much as I hate the way you use it. Overseas there's a war between countries. Here there's another war between humanity and a species of alien monsters. Whether we like it or not, we're allies.\"  Norden's undershot jaw moved in a grin.  \"I know about the spheres, Captain,\" Norden replied. \"I overheard your remarks to Mr. Masters. I've listened to Orkins' babble.\"  \"Will you help us?\"  \"I will bargain with you.\"  \"For your life? You know I can't do anything about that. I'll do my best--I'll speak a good word at your trial, try to save you from the firing squad, but I'm only a captain. That's all I can do. I haven't the power to do anything more.\"  \"Then I will not help.\"  \"Do you know what we're up against?\"  \"It looks pretty bad, doesn't it, Captain? But consider my hopeless case.\"  \"We have a chance, Norden. I know, more than any other living man perhaps, what those spheres are. I've seen them close at hand. Any hope of defeating them rests in us, using the meager knowledge I've gained from contact. What happens to your fatherland after the spheres finish on this side of the ocean depends on whether we conquer them, or they exterminate us.\"  Norden stopped smiling.  \"When you put it that way, Captain, how could I refuse?\" he asked. \"I'll cooperate, not to help you, but to help the fatherland.\"  The moonlight showed a gleam in Norden's deep-set eyes that Taylor did not like.         *       *       *       *       *  They moved to a wooded spot in a nearby field. There was a feeling of semi-security as they settled down to rest under the trees. Orkins' moans of fear were silenced by sleep. Norden sat motionless and Taylor could not tell whether he was asleep or awake. Pember removed his pack and used it for a pillow. Masters snored peacefully on the grass.  Only Taylor remained awake. A sphere floated overhead. Taylor, watching, saw the leaves of the tree stir restlessly as the invisible feelers probed toward the earth.  It was a reddish-orange orb, like the setting sun. Taylor once more got the impression of deeply embedded eyes glowering beneath the shining surface.  Were the eyes an illusion? Did the creatures really have eyes, like those of higher forms of animal life? Illusion or not, the eyes seemed to be there, intense, glaring and savage. They seemed to peer into the depths of Taylor's soul.  Taylor sat motionless, almost positive he was under observation. He expected to feel the jerk of the electric shock of the feeler. Instead, the sphere drifted on. The eyes had not seen.  A moment later flame streaked down from the sphere toward the parking lot. There was a roar as a gasoline tank exploded and flame shot skyward.  \"There goes the battery!\" Taylor muttered.  The others were roused by the explosion. Orkins sobbed hysterically. Masters, Pember and Norden watched the roaring flame.  \"We'll never escape them!\" Orkins moaned. \"They'll find us sooner or later. They can sense us.\"  \"They're not infallible,\" Taylor said. \"Remember I got away from them in the tunnel.\" He turned knowingly toward the others. \"Perhaps, if we dug a cave--\"  \"Sure!\" said Masters. \"It's a good idea.\"  \"Yes, sir!\" Pember said with a nod. He pulled his trench tool from his pack and handed it to Orkins. \"Maybe you'd like to dig, Mr. Orkins. It'll keep your mind off them things.\"  Orkins seized the small shovel almost instantly. Taylor half-smiled. He had made the suggestion for Orkins' benefit. The cave probably would never be finished. One deep enough to offer a refuge for five men could hardly be dug in a practical length of time.  Dawn was not far off and the spheres were drifting over the town. Already streets were filled with panic-stricken people. The appearance of the strange balls of fire brought residents from their homes in the middle of the night. Some fled in terror, believing a new type of raider had been invented by the enemy. Others stood watching.  The spheres circled. Taylor watched them, realizing he could do nothing to stop what would happen. There was no way to warn these helpless people that the spheres dealt death in a most sudden and violent form.  Something nagged at Taylor's mind. Why had the sphere gone out when he crept into the tunnel? What had caused it to die? Had the sphere been grounded, trying to reach him under the surface of the earth? Not likely, otherwise the creatures would not be able to attack a man standing on the ground. The bolt, besides, was not electricity, like lightning, but heat, which is not grounded easily.  Where had the spheres come from? They surely were not of this world. On the basis of biological evolution they could not be the children of any life known to science. Had they evolved suddenly, by accident? Some scientists thought all life had grown by accident; the right combination of circumstances had occurred and a chemical action had followed. Had the right combination for the spheres come about as the result of the war "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22226"],["title","The Whispering Spheres (#3)"],["body","the releasing of untold amounts of energy?  But even if life had begun on earth by accident, all other types had taken ages to develop. These spheres, thinking creatures, could not have evolved overnight.  These seemingly invincible creatures could not have come from this world. Biological development comes through struggle and survival. An invincible creature does not have to worry about its existence--in fact, struggle was necessary to develop an invincible being. These spheres must be from another world. Refugees, perhaps, from another, even more powerful race; or maybe they were seeking a new world to conquer.  One was circling overhead again. The leaves rustled. Taylor thought he heard a choked-off scream. Orkins. He gritted his teeth grimly.  There was only one link of hope in Taylor's chain of thought. There must always be a check to every form of life. Terrestrial plagues of insects were followed suddenly by flocks of birds. In western states an increase in the number of jackrabbits always is a forerunner of an increase in the number of coyotes. But the jackrabbits carried parasites fatal to the coyotes. If man was a rabbit, then perhaps he harbored the check to these creatures of flame.  What check would limit the whispering spheres? No germ, surely. What possible check was there except man's nature? What part of man's nature? That was the answer Taylor wanted to know.  His chain of thought was suddenly interrupted.  Pember was coming on the run. The private saluted the captain.  \"Something's wrong, sir! Orkins is throwing a fit.\"  \"Can't you quiet him? The spheres are near.\"  \"Norden held his hand over Orkins' mouth, but it made Orkins worse. I--I think it's serious, sir.\"  Taylor followed Pember to the place where Orkins had been digging. Norden was there, bending over Orkins, who lay on the ground. Masters, standing behind Norden, shook his head.  \"He's dead,\" Norden said, straightening.  \"He was scared to death by the spheres,\" Masters said. \"No one harmed him, except to hold a hand over his mouth. He wasn't choked. He could have breathed through his nostrils--\"  \"Wait--\"  Taylor held up his hand. Something clicked in his brain.  Masters had said something about the spheres that fitted. He said, _Maybe you don't have to touch 'em to kill 'em._ Figuratively speaking, Orkins hadn't been seriously touched either.  The answer!     CHAPTER V  AN ESCAPE   Taylor ordered Pember and Norden to bury Orkins where he had been digging, then the officer took Masters aside.  \"We've got a weapon,\" Taylor announced.  Masters grunted:  \"Yeah? Indians had bows and arrows, too. Look at what happened to them.\"  \"This is different. A new weapon. We can beat the spheres through their emotions.\"  \"You mean fear, love, hate--all that stuff? How do you know these spheres have emotions?\"  \"What is life but a series of sensations and emotions? If the spheres are alive, they must have something which correspond to emotions. The emotions may be different from ours, but they'll be emotions just the same. Orkins died of fear. Of course, you can call it heart attack, but fear brought it on. That sphere that had me cornered in the plant died, too. Do you see?\"  \"Was the sphere afraid of you or the tunnel?\"  \"Don't be flippant. The emotion wasn't fear. It might not have been any emotion we have, but an emotion that we'd expect a creature made of energy to have. An emotion of frustration! It had me cornered. I escaped. The energy sphere met resistance. When energy meets resistance it changes!\"  \"I don't get it.\"  \"Look, Masters. If the spheres are mixtures of energies, like we are mixtures of chemicals, death means extinction, just as biological death means the extinction of the chemical action in our lives. Theologians say we don't die--that there's a change and we go on existing in a spiritual life. Now let's take a peep at what science tells us about energy: Newton says energy is never extinguished. When it ceases in one form, it changes to another. What happens when you run electricity through a resistance coil?\"  \"It turns to heat, of course!\"  \"And when you enclose light where it can't escape?\"  \"It turns to heat!\" Masters' face brightened. \"And if you pen up heat, it turns to light. I learned that in school. Resistance causes a change. But what do the spheres turn to?\"  \"Radio energy, Masters! Something absolutely harmless to man. These living, energy spheres will change to radio energy when they meet resistance. Frustration is resistance. Frustration is an emotion. An overwhelming emotion for the spheres! The sphere is frustrated--meets resistance--it disappears. In other words, it dies!\"         *       *       *       *       *  From the city came screams and cries. The spheres had attacked at last.  The men in the wooded field could see the darting balls sending their searing bolts down on the heads of hapless victims. The crashing roar of the slaughter sounded like distant thunderstorms.  Streets were jammed with panic-stricken human beings, fleeing from the unknown menace which slashed with bolts of heat energy.  From the hole in the factory roof poured more spheres to join the destruction.  \"They breed fast, the devils!\" said Masters.  A figure in khaki approached Taylor. It was Pember with blood running from a cut on the side of his head. He saluted briskly.  \"Norden escaped, sir!\" he blurted. \"The dirty so-and-so cracked me over the head with the trench tool and got away!\"  \"I never thought he'd turn yellow,\" Masters said. \"Well, maybe it's a good thing he's gone. I never trusted him anyhow.\"  \"Which way did he go?\" Taylor asked.  \"He went toward the factory, sir!\" Pember replied. \"He didn't knock me out. Just a glancing blow. I was too dazed to stop him, but I saw him running toward the factory.\"  \"He'd rather take it that way than the firing squad, I guess,\" Masters decided.  \"Masters,\" Taylor said. \"We overlooked something. Norden knows something we don't know. He was around Orkins most of the time after we left the plant. He listened to what Orkins said. Orkins was in the factory when the spheres first appeared. I overlooked Orkins as having an answer to the problem. I thought I knew it all, but I was wrong! Orkins knew more than I know about the spheres.\"  \"Sure! I should have thought of it, too. How did Orkins get away when everyone else got killed? I never asked that. I just took it for granted that he got away by accident. Orkins might have known enough to help Norden get the spheres on his side!\"  Taylor already was running toward the factory. At his heels came Masters and Pember.     CHAPTER VI  INFERNO   They found no sign of Norden as they approached the factory. Several times they had to take cover in ditches and weeds as whispering spheres floated overhead in search of prey. But they escaped the electrical feelers which stirred the grass and brush around them.  Pember recovered his Garand rifle, which had been left near the sentry box during the retreat.  Taylor led the group into the tunnel, with Masters following and Pember bringing up the rear.  The din of the slaughter in the town and the shrill whistle of the spheres was blotted out underground. They reached the far end, where the ladder led upward to the sphere-haunted factory.  Taylor ascended. He could hear the shrill whistle of spheres dinning through the bleak building. He peeped into the forge room. The first flush of dawn was streaming through the windows.  Norden was there, creeping along the barrels of some naval guns toward the casting room.  Norden halted at the door. He took a deep breath. From his lips came a shrill, whispering whistle, a close imitation of the call of the spheres.  An orange light was reflected from the room beyond.  Still whistling, Norden stepped back a few paces. Through the door, floating toward the spy came an orange sphere.  Taylor watched, expecting to see a bolt of heat lash out toward the spy. But the sphere pulsed slowly, as if half pleased by the sound Norden made with his lips.  So this is how Orkins escaped from the plant, Taylor thought. Orkins had imitated the creatures. They had spared him as a pet, like a man keeps a talking parrot.  Norden stood very still, whistling while the sphere approached. A little tentacle of flame reached out toward him.  Taylor expected to see Norden disappear in a flash of fire, but the flame seemed to caress. A soft glow seemed to diffuse from the man's clothing and body.  The sphere, too, seemed to change, growing softer and more mellow. It wasn't a tangible substance, but something ethereal, like the flicker of flame over an open hearth. Some tremendous force seemed to hold the sphere in globular shape.  Taylor could see the chimerical eyes peering through the surface of the sphere. He looked into the depths of those eyes and still could not be sure they were not an illusion. The intensity of the creatures' intelligence seemed to shine from within, giving the impression of staring, haunting eyes. They were not organs of sight, but they were the windows of the mind. They were the source of those tenuous flames that seemed to caress Norden.  As Taylor looked at the eyes he felt plunged into the pathless depths of a vast, powerful brain. He was in contact with an infinity of intelligence far beyond limits of human comprehension. It was a surging intelligence of energy, abysmal, vaporous and limitless, transcending the dimensions, out-reaching boundless time, overshadowing matter.  The eyes made Taylor forget he was a man. His own mind seemed merged in the intellectual energy floating among the monster machines of the forge room. Dimly, he was conscious that this power was not directed at him, but at Norden who stood, still whistling, in front of the globe.  The sphere was whistling, too, and the sound transformed itself into music of the stars.  A discordant note rose in the song from Norden's imitation of the voice. Norden was shrieking hatred for Taylor's nation,"]]]
