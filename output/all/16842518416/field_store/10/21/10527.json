We aimed the water at the hedge, and we didn't see Ness and Aleck until they let out a yell.\"  \"But I saw two of you playing the water in that direction,\" cried Dick Rover. \"You were one of them, Jack.\"  \"Oh, well, Dad, what was the harm after they were all wet?\" pleaded his son. \"They'd have to change their clothing anyway.\"  \"That's just it,\" added Andy Rover quickly, with his eyes twinkling from merriment. \"A little more water won't hurt a person when he's already soaked. It's just like spoiling a rotten egg--it can't be done,\" and at this reply, both Dick Rover and his brother, the fun-loving Tom, had to turn away their faces to hide their amusement. Nevertheless, Dick sobered his face almost instantly as he answered:  \"Well, these pranks around the farm have got to stop. You'll have your grandfather and Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha all upset, not to say anything about your sisters and your mothers. It's a fortunate thing that they went down to the town to do some shopping. Otherwise I think all of you would be in for quite some punishment.\"  \"Oh! Then you're not going to punish us, are you?\" broke in Randy Rover quickly. \"That's fine! I knew you wouldn't mind our having a little fun.\"  \"Don't be so fast, young man,\" returned his father. \"Your Uncle Dick may be too lenient. I am rather of the opinion that you and your brother, if not your cousins, have got to be taken in hand.\"  \"Oh, please, Massa Tom, don' go fo' to punish 'em,\" burst out old Aleck Pop. \"I--I don't s'pose dey meant any great ha'm, even do dey did t'row dat stream of wattah right in dis yere coon's mouf;\" and he smiled broadly, showing a row of ivories, rather the worse for wear.  \"I think all of you boys had better go into the house and get some dry clothing on before your mothers put in an appearance,\" suggested Dick Rover. \"If they see you like this, all dripping wet, they'll certainly be worried.\"  \"All right, Dad; I'll do it,\" answered Jack, quickly. And then he motioned to his cousins. \"Come on, let's see how fast we can make the change;\" and off into the big farmhouse rushed the boys, clattering up the back stairs one after the other, to the two big rooms which they occupied.  \"Some boys!\" was Sam Rover's comment, as he shook his head doubtfully.  \"They are certainly growing older--and wilder,\" returned Dick Rover.  \"We've got to take them in hand--that is dead certain!\" said Tom Rover, with conviction. \"Why! if I don't do something with Andy and Randy pretty soon, they'll be as--as----\"  \"As bad as you were, Tom, at their age,\" finished Dick Rover, with a smile.  \"Now you've said something, Dick,\" affirmed Sam Rover. \"Andy isn't quite so bad when it comes to playing tricks, although he certainly says some awfully funny things, but when it comes to doing things Randy continually puts me in mind of Tom.\"  \"Oh, say! To hear you fellows talk, you'd think that I was the worst boy that ever lived,\" grumbled Tom Rover. \"What did I ever do to raise such a rumpus as this?\"  \"Phew! What did he ever do to raise such a rumpus as this?\" mocked Sam Rover. \"Well, what didn't he do? When father went to Africa and disappeared and we came down here to good old Valley Brook Farm, wasn't he the constant torment of Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha, and the hired girl, and all the rest of the community until, in sheer despair, uncle had to send us off to Putnam Hall? And when we went to the Hall, who was the first one to get into trouble--exploding a giant firecracker on the campus? Answer me that, will you?\"  \"Ancient history,\" murmured Tom Rover, dryly. But then, of a sudden his eyes began to twinkle. \"No use talking, though, we certainly did have some good times in those days, didn't we?\" he continued. \"Do you remember how we got the best of old Josiah Crabtree?\"  \"Yes. And how we got the best of a whole lot of our enemies,\" added Sam Rover.  \"Yes, and what gloriously good times we did have at Putnam Hall and at Brill College,\" came from Dick Rover, with a sigh. \"Sometimes I wish all those happy days could be lived over again.\"  \"When you think of those days, Dick, just think of what great times are in store for our boys,\" said Sam. \"I only trust they have as good times as we had.\"  \"I guess they'll know how to take care of themselves all right enough,\" was Tom Rover's comment. \"But, just the same, we can't permit them to become too wild. Sending them to that private school in New York City doesn't seem to have done them so very much good, although, of course, I admit they are well educated for their age.\"  \"I know where I'm going to send Jack when the proper time comes,\" answered Dick Rover.  \"Where?\" came from his brothers.  \"I'm going to send him to Colby Hall, the military academy which our old school chum, Larry Colby, has opened. Larry sent me some of his literature some time ago; and I have heard from several people that it's already a first-class institution of learning--every bit as good as Putnam Hall.\"  \"Well, if it's half as good as dear old Putnam Hall it must be some school,\" said Tom Rover. \"And there's no reason why Larry Colby shouldn't be able to run a first-class military academy. He was a good scholar and a first-class cadet when he was at Putnam Hall.\"  \"After Larry left Putnam Hall he went to travel in Europe,\" continued Dick. \"Then he went through college, and immediately after that he joined the militia of New York State and there worked his way up until he now sports the title of colonel.\"  \"Colonel Colby, eh? That's going some,\" was Tom's comment.  \"His school is patterned after West Point, as was Putnam Hall, and I understand he has a West Point officer there to instruct the cadets in military tactics.\"  \"Well, that's the sort of school our boys will need,\" answered Tom Rover. \"The stricter it is the better it will be for them.\"  \"I think it would be a good scheme to send them to Larry Colby's school,\" was Sam's comment. \"As Larry knows us so well he would probably take an especial interest in our boys.\"  \"Yes. But I wouldn't want him to show our lads any special favors,\" broke in Tom, quickly. \"If the boys went there, I should want them to stand on their own feet, just as we did when we went to Putnam Hall.\"  \"That's the talk, Tom! No favoritism!\" cried Dick. \"The only way to make a boy thoroughly self-reliant is to make him take his own part.\"  \"If we are going to send them off to boarding school, they might as well go this Fall as any other time,\" remarked Sam Rover. \"Have you any idea when the term at Colby Hall begins, Dick?\"  \"About the middle of September.\"  \"It's the middle of August now. That would give us a full month in which to make arrangements and for them in which to get ready.\"  \"Have you ever said anything to the twins about going to boarding school, Tom?\" questioned Sam.  \"Oh, yes. They understand that they are to go to some place sooner or later. Fred understands it, too, doesn't he?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And I told Jack only a short while ago that he must get ready to think of leaving home,\" put in Dick Rover. \"Of course, it will be rather hard on the boys at first. They have never been away from us at all except the two weeks when they were out in that boys' camp.\"  \"They'll have to get used to it, just as we got used to it when father went off to Africa and Uncle Randy sent us to Putnam Hall. Perhaps we had better tell them----\"  Sam Rover broke off short as a series of shrieks in a high-pitched feminine voice issued from the pantry of the big farmhouse. An instant later a hired girl, followed by a middle-aged cook, came flying forth from the kitchen doorway.  \"Oh, save me! Save me!\" cried the hired girl, clutching her skirts tightly around her ankles, \"Save me!\"  \"Oh, Mr. Rover! Mr. Rover! It's those dreadful boys! I won't stay here another minute!\" screamed the cook, flourishing a big spoon in one hand and a dish-cloth in the other. \"It's outrageous! That's what it is! I'm going to pack my trunk and leave this house right away!\"  \"What's the matter?\" demanded Tom Rover, quickly.  \"Are you hurt?\" came anxiously from Dick.  \"What have the boys done now?\" questioned Sam.  \"What have they done?\" wailed the hired girl. \"I just went into the pantry and opened the closet door and out jumped about a thousand mice at me!\"  \"Yes! and they are running all over the house!\" broke in the cook savagely. \"One of 'em ran right over my foot and tried to bite me! I'm going to pack my trunk and leave! I won't stay here another minute!\"     CHAPTER II  SOMETHING OF THE PAST   At the announcement of the hired girl that their sons had let loose in the farmhouse a thousand mice--more or less--the three Rover brothers looked at each other enquiringly.  \"Another joke--and so soon!\" gasped Sam Rover.  \"That certainly is the limit!\" broke out Dick Rover, as he started for the house.  \"If I find Andy and Randy have been up to another trick right on top of this water-hose nonsense, I'll give them a tanning they won't forget in a hurry,\" added Tom Rover; and then he and Sam followed Dick up the back porch and into the kitchen.  To the readers of the former volumes in these two \"Rover Boys Series,\" Dick, Tom and Sam Rover will need no special introduction. For the benefit of others, however, let me state that the sober-minded and determined Dick was the oldest of the three, with the fun-loving Tom coming next and sturdy Sam being the youngest. They were the sons of one Anderson Rover, who, when not traveling, made his home at Valley Brook Farm, in New York State, living there with his brother Randolph Rover and wife Martha.  While Dick, Tom, and Sam were quite young, and while their father was off exploring in the interior of Africa, the three Rovers had been sent to Putnam Hall Military Academy, where they had made a few enemies and likewise a host of friends, including a manly and straight-forward cadet named"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21894"],["title","The Rover Boys at Colby Hall; or, The Struggles of the Young Cadets (#2)"],["body","Colby. After many adventures both at school and in various portions of the globe, they had graduated from Putnam Hall with honor and then entered Brill College.  At that time, Mr. Anderson Rover, who had long since returned from Africa, was not in the best of health. He had numerous business interests both in Wall Street, New York City, and in the West to take care of, and presently it was found necessary that Dick leave college and take charge of business matters for his parent. In this task Dick was soon aided by Tom, leaving Sam the only member of the family to graduate from Brill.  While at Putnam Hall the three Rovers had become acquainted with three charming girls, Dora Stanhope and her cousins, Nellie and Grace Laning. This acquaintance had ripened into loving intimacy; and when Dick went into business he took Dora Stanhope for his life-long partner. A little later Tom was married to Nellie Laning, and, after he had left Brill and joined his brothers in conducting their father's various business enterprises, Sam married Grace Laning.  With the aid of Mr. Anderson Rover and some others, The Rover Company was organized with offices on Wall Street, New York City. The company dealt in stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investments; and Dick was now president, with Tom secretary and Sam treasurer. The company had been prosperous from the start, although on several occasions enemies had done their best to give the concern a black eye.  When they were first married, Dick and his beautiful wife Dora had begun housekeeping in a cosy apartment in the metropolis, and they had presently been followed by Tom and Sam. But two years later the three brothers had a chance to buy a beautiful plot of ground on Riverside Drive facing the noble Hudson River, and on this they built three fine houses adjoining each other, Dick living in the middle house with Tom on one side and Sam on the other.  Before the happy young folks moved into the new homes, Dick and Dora were blessed with a little son, who later on was named John, after Mr. John Laning. Later still, this couple had a daughter, whom they named Martha, after Aunt Martha of Valley Brook Farm. Little Jack, as he was called in those days, was a wonderfully bright and clever lad with many of the clear-minded qualities which had made his father so successful in life.  About the time young Jack was presented with a baby sister, Tom and Nellie Rover came forward with twin boys, one of whom was named Anderson, after his grandfather, and the other Randolph, after his uncle. Andy and Randy, as they were always called for short, were exceedingly bright, each taking after his father, Andy always saying things that were more or less funny and Randy playing tricks whenever he got the chance. They were truly chips off the old block, and Tom knew it, although outwardly he professed to be ignorant of the fact.  \"Those twins will be some boys when they grow up,\" was old Anderson Rover's comment, when the lads were less than five years old. \"They're just as full of fun now as Tom ever dared to be.\"  \"So they are,\" answered his brother Randolph. \"My! my! what will they ever do with them when they get a little older?\"  \"I sha'n't mind,\" said Aunt Martha, her eyes beaming brightly. \"That is, if they are really and truly as good-hearted as Tom has always been. He certainly was the worst of the lot when it came to playing jokes, but no lad ever had a better heart than Tom--not one!\"  About the time that Tom began to boast about his twins, Sam and Grace came along with a beautiful little girl, whom they named Mary, after Mrs. Laning. About a year later the girl was followed by a boy, and this sturdy little chap was named Fred, after Sam's old school chum, Fred Garrison.  Living so close together, the four boys and the two girls were brought up almost like one big family. The girls were all but inseparable, and the boys could generally be found together, either studying, playing, or having a good time.  When the time came to set the children to studying, Martha and Mary were placed in a private school for girls located but a short distance from their homes. It was thought best, however, at the start to send the boys to a public school, and this was done. For three years matters went along very well, and during that time The Rover Company prospered far beyond the expectations of those in charge. But then Andy and Randy, becoming a little older, began to exhibit their talent for playing tricks, and usually they were seconded in these efforts by Jack and Fred. Once or twice all of the boys were reported by the school principal for this, and each time the lads were remonstrated with by their fathers in such a manner that, as young Andy expressed it, \"it was far more comfortable to sit down standing up than it was any other way.\"  \"I think I'll have to do something with those twins,\" said Tom Rover to his wife, after the boys had been reported for more tricks. \"The school they go to doesn't seem to be strict enough.\" And thereupon he had sent the boys to a private establishment further uptown.  Jack and Fred had begged their parents that they might be allowed to do likewise; and at this private school the four cousins had been kept until the close of the Spring term the preceding June. To the credit of this school it must be said that the boys advanced rapidly in their studies. Their deportment, however, was apparently no better than it had been before, and as a consequence Tom Rover was more worried than ever, while Dick and Sam began to wonder secretly whether it would not be advisable to separate their sons from the mischievous twins.  One day Dick broached this subject to his offspring. At once young Jack set up a wild remonstrance.  \"Oh, Dad! don't take me away from Andy and Randy and Fred!\" he pleaded. \"Why, we are just like brothers! I wouldn't know how to get along without 'em.\"  \"But I'm afraid Andy and Randy are leading you into bad habits,\" returned Dick Rover.  \"I don't think so, Dad. Anyway, I've heard folks say that Andy and Randy are no worse than their father used to be--and you never wanted to be separated from Uncle Tom, did you?\"  At this question Dick Rover's face took on a sudden sober look. \"No; I never wanted to be separated from your uncle, that's true,\" he said. \"But I tell you what we did used to do. When his pranks got too wild I and your Uncle Sam used to hold him in.\"  \"All right then, Dad. I'll tell Fred about this, and we'll see what we can do towards holding in Andy and Randy;\" and there, after some more talk along the same line, the matter was allowed to rest.  Young Jack was as good as his word, and during the remainder of that Spring term at the private school in New York City, Andy and Randy were as well behaved as could possibly be expected from two red-blooded lads.  It had been planned by the Rovers that the Summer should be spent by all the young folks and their mothers at Valley Brook Farm, the fathers to come down from time to time, and especially over the week ends. Since Dick, Tom, and Sam had become married the farm had been enlarged by the purchase of two hundred additional acres. The farmhouse, too, had been made larger, with the old portion remodeled, and a water system from the rapidly-growing town of Dexter's Corners, as well as electric lighting, had been installed. A telephone had been put in some years previous.  At first after their arrival at their grandfather's home, the four boys had been content to take it easy, spending their time roaming the fields, helping to gather the fruit, of which there was great abundance, and in going fishing and swimming. But then Andy and Randy had found time growing a little heavy on their hands, and one prank had been followed by another. Some of the tricks had been played on Jack and Fred, and they, of course, had done their best to retaliate, and this had, on more than one occasion, brought forth a forceful, but good-natured, pitched battle, and the fathers and the others present had had all they could do to hold the boys in check.  \"I never saw such boys,\" was Mary Rover's comment to her brother Fred. \"Why can't you behave yourselves just as Martha and I do?\"  \"Oh, girls never have any good times,\" answered Fred. \"They just sit around and primp up and read, and do things like that.\"  \"Indeed!\" and Mary tossed her curly head. \"I think we have just as good times as you boys, every bit; but we don't have to be rough about it;\" and then she ran off to play a game of lawn tennis with her cousin Martha.  The time was the middle of August, and as the summer was proving to be an unusually warm one, all the older Rovers were glad enough to take it easy on the farm, they having earlier in the season been down to the seashore for a couple of weeks. Dick, Tom and Sam had each taken a week off at various times, and all managed to get down to the farm early every Saturday afternoon, to remain until Sunday night or Monday morning.  And it was late on a Saturday afternoon, when the ladies and the girls had gone to Dexter's Corners to do some shopping, and while the fathers were busy reading and writing, that the events occurred with which the present story opens.  As Dick Rover ran into the farmhouse he heard a slight scream coming from the sitting-room. The scream was followed by exclamations from two men, and then a wild thumping as if someone was hitting the floor with a cane.  \"It's a mouse--several of 'em!\" came in the voice of Grandfather Rover.  \"Oh, my! oh, my! wherever did they come from?\" exclaimed old Aunt Martha.  \"Never mind where they came from, I'll fix 'em,\" asserted old Randolph Rover, and then followed another thumping as he rushed around between the chairs and behind the sofa, trying to slaughter some of the scampering mice with his heavy walking stick.  \"Where are they? Where are those mice?\" demanded Tom Rover, giving a hasty glance around the kitchen.  \"There is one--under the sink!\""]]]
