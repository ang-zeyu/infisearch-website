Besides the hydrogen series we here find the He-lines (396, 403, 412, 414, 447, 471, 493 μμ).  To this type belong all the bright stars (β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η and others) in Orion with the exception of Betelgeuze. Further, Spica and many other bright stars.  On plate III ε Orionis is taken as representative of this type.  _Type A_ (Sirius type) is characterized by the great intensity of the hydrogen lines (compare plate III). The helium lines have vanished. Other lines visible but faintly.  The greater part of the stars visible to the naked eye are found here. There are 1251 stars brighter than the 6th magnitude which belong to this type. Sirius, Vega, Castor, Altair, Deneb and others are all A-stars.  _Type F_ (Calcium type). The hydrogen lines still rather prominent but not so broad as in the preceding type. The two calcium lines H and K (396.9, 393.4 μμ) strongly pronounced.  Among the stars of this type are found a great many bright stars (compare the third chapter), such as Polaris, Canopus, Procyon.  _Type G_ (Sun type). Numerous metallic lines together with relatively faint hydrogen lines.  To this class belong the sun, Capella, α Centauri and other bright stars.  _Type K._ The hydrogen lines still fainter. The K-line attains its maximum intensity (is not especially pronounced in the figure of plate III).  This is, next to the A-type, the most numerous type (1142 stars) among the bright stars.  We find here γ Andromedæ, β Aquilæ, Arcturus, α Cassiopeiæ, Pollux and Aldebaran, which last forms a transition to the next type.  _Type M._ The spectrum is banded and belongs to SECCHI's third type. The flutings are due to titanium oxide.  Only 190 of the stars visible to the naked eye belong to this type. Generally they are rather faint, but we here find Betelgeuze, α Herculis, β Pegasi, α Scorpii (Antares) and most variables of long period, which form a special sub-type _Md_, characterized by bright hydrogen lines together with the flutings.  Type M has two other sub-types Ma and Mb.  _Type N_ (SECCHI's fourth type). Banded spectra. The flutings are due to compounds of carbon.  Here are found only faint stars. The total number is 241. All are red. 27 stars having this spectrum are variables of long period of the same type as Md.  The spectral types may be summed up in the following way:--      White stars:--SECCHI's type I:--Harvard B and A,     Yellow  \"  :--   \"      \"  II:--   \"    F, G and K,     Red     \"  :--   \"      \" III:--   \"    M,      \"      \"  :--   \"      \"  IV:--   \"    N.  The Harvard astronomers do not confine themselves to the types mentioned above, but fill up the intervals between the types with sub-types which are designated by the name of the type followed by a numeral 0, 1, 2, ..., 9. Thus the sub-types between A and F have the designations A0, A1, A2, ..., A9, F0, &c. Exceptions are made as already indicated, for the extreme types O and M.   11. _Spectral index._ It may be gathered from the above description that the definition of the types implies many vague moments. Especially in regard to the G-type are very different definitions indeed accepted, even at Harvard.[6] It is also a defect that the definitions do not directly give _quantitative_ characteristics of the spectra. None the less it is possible to substitute for the spectral classes a continuous scale expressing the spectral character of a star. Such a scale is indeed implicit in the Harvard classification of the spectra.  Let us use the term _spectral index_ (_s_) to define a number expressing the spectral character of a star. Then we may conveniently define this conception in the following way. Let A0 correspond to the spectral index _s_ = 0.0, F0 to _s_ = +1.0, G0 to _s_ = +2.0, K0 to _s_ = +3.0 M0 to _s_ = +4.0 and B0 to _s_ = -1.0. Further, let A1, A2, A3, &c., have the spectral indices +0.1, +0.2, +0.3, &c., and in like manner with the other intermediate sub-classes. Then it is evident that to all spectral classes between B0 and M there corresponds a certain spectral index _s_. The extreme types O and N are not here included. Their spectral indices may however be determined, as will be seen later.  Though the spectral indices, defined in this manner, are directly known for every spectral type, it is nevertheless not obvious that the series of spectral indices corresponds to a continuous series of values of some attribute of the stars. This may be seen to be possible from a comparison with another attribute which may be rather markedly graduated, namely the colour of the stars. We shall discuss this point in another paragraph. To obtain a well graduated scale of the spectra it will finally be necessary to change to some extent the definitions of the spectral types, a change which, however, has not yet been accomplished.   12. We have found in §9 that the light-radiation of a star is described by means of the total intensity (_I_), the mean wave-length (λ_0) and the dispersion of the wave-length (σ_λ). λ_0 and σ_λ may be deduced from the spectral observations. It must here be observed that the observations give, not the intensities at different wave-lengths but, the values of these intensities as they are apprehended by the instruments employed--the eye or the photographic plate. For the derivation of the true curve of intensity we must know the distributive function of the instrument (L. M. 67). As to the eye, we have reason to believe, from the bolometric observations of LANGLEY (1888), that the mean wave-length of the visual curve of intensity nearly coincides with that of the true intensity-curve, a conclusion easily understood from DARWIN's principles of evolution, which demand that the human eye in the course of time shall be developed in such a way that the mean wave-length of the visual intensity curve does coincide with that of the true curve (λ = 530 μμ), when the greatest visual energy is obtained (L. M. 67). As to the dispersion, this is always greater in the true intensity-curve than in the visual curve, for which, according to §10, it amounts to approximately 60 μμ. We found indeed that the visual intensity curve is extended, approximately, from 400 μμ to 760 μμ, a sixth part of which interval, approximately, corresponds to the dispersion σ of the visual curve.  In the case of the photographic intensity-curve the circumstances are different. The mean wave-length of the photographic curve is, approximately, 450 μμ, with a dispersion of 16 μμ, which is considerably smaller than in the visual curve.   13. Both the visual and the photographic curves of intensity differ according to the temperature of the radiating body and are therefore different for stars of different spectral types. Here the mean wave-length follows the formula of WIEN, which says that this wave-length varies inversely as the temperature. The total intensity, according to the law of STEPHAN, varies directly as the fourth power of the temperature. Even the dispersion is dependent on the variation of the temperature--directly as the mean wave-length, inversely as the temperature of the star (L. M. 41)--so that the mean wave-length, as well as the dispersion of the wave-length, is smaller for the hot stars O and B than for the cooler ones (K and M types). It is in this manner possible to determine the temperature of a star from a determination of its mean wave-length (λ_0) or from the dispersion in λ. Such determinations (from λ_0) have been made by SCHEINER and WILSING in Potsdam, by ROSENBERG and others, though these researches still have to be developed to a greater degree of accuracy.   14. _Effective wave-length._ The mean wave-length of a spectrum, or, as it is often called by the astronomers, the _effective_ wave-length, is generally determined in the following way. On account of the refraction in the air the image of a star is, without the use of a spectroscope, really a spectrum. After some time of exposure we get a somewhat round image, the position of which is determined precisely by the mean wave-length. This method is especially used with a so-called _objective-grating_, which consists of a series of metallic threads, stretched parallel to each other at equal intervals. On account of the diffraction of the light we now get in the focal plane of the objective, with the use of these gratings, not only a fainter image of the star at the place where it would have arisen without grating, but also at both sides of this image secondary images, the distances of which from the central star are certain theoretically known multiples of the effective wave-lengths. In this simple manner it is possible to determine the effective wave-length, and this being a tolerably well-known function of the spectral-index, the latter can also be found. This method was first proposed by HERTZSPRUNG and has been extensively used by BERGSTRAND, LUNDMARK and LINDBLAD at the observatory of Upsala and by others.   15. _Colour-index._ We have already pointed out in §9 that the colour may be identified with the mean wave-length (λ_0). As further λ_0 is closely connected with the spectral index (_s_), we may use the spectral index to represent the colour. Instead of _s_ there may also be used another expression for the colour, called the colour-index. This expression was first introduced by SCHWARZSCHILD, and is defined in the following way.  We have seen that the zero-point of the photographic scale is chosen in such a manner that the visual magnitude _m_ and the photographic magnitude _m′_ coincide for stars of spectral index 0.0 (A0). The photographic magnitudes are then unequivocally determined. It is found that their values systematically differ from the visual magnitudes, so that for type B (and O) the photographic magnitudes are smaller than the visual, and the contrary for the other types. The difference is greatest for the M-type (still greater for the N-stars, though here for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22157"],["title","Lectures on Stellar Statistics (#4)"],["body"," present only a few determinations are known), for which stars if amounts to nearly two magnitudes. So much fainter is a red star on a photographic plate than when observed with the eye.  _The difference between the photographic and the visual magnitudes is called the colour-index (_c_)._ The correlation between this index and the spectral-index is found to be rather high (_r_ = +0.96). In L. M. II, 19 I have deduced the following tables giving the spectral-type corresponding to a given colour-index, and inversely.

This may be considered as known (taking into account the high coefficient of correlation between _s_ and _c_) as soon as we know the spectral type of the star. We may conclude directly that the number of stars having a photographic magnitude brighter than 6.0 is considerably smaller than the number of stars visually brighter than this magnitude. There are, indeed, 4701 stars for which _m_ < 6.0 and 2874 stars having _m′_ < 6.0.   16. _Radial velocity of the stars._ From the values of α and δ at different times we obtain the components of the proper motions of the stars perpendicular to the line of sight. The third component (_W_), in the radial direction, is found by the DOPPLER principle, through measuring the displacement of the lines in the spectrum, this displacement being towards the red or the violet according as the star is receding from or approaching the observer.  The velocity _W_ will be expressed in siriometers per stellar year (sir./st.) and alternately also in km./sec. The rate of conversion of these units is given in §5.   17. Summing up the remarks here given on the apparent attributes of the stars we find them referred to the following principal groups:--  I. _The position of the stars_ is here generally given in galactic longitude (_l_) and latitude (_b_). Moreover their equatorial coordinates (α and δ) are given in an abridged notation (αδ), where the first four numbers give the right ascension in hours and minutes and the last two numbers give the declination in degrees, the latter being printed in italics if the declination is negative.  Eventually the position is given in galactic squares, as defined in §2.  II. _The apparent motion of the stars_ will be given in radial components (_W_) expressed in sir./st. and their motion perpendicular to the line of sight. These components will be expressed in one component (_u_0_) parallel to the galactic plane, and one component (_v_0_) perpendicular to it. If the distance (_r_) is known we are able to convert these components into components of the linear velocity perpendicular to the line of sight (_U_ and _V_).  III. _The intensity of the light_ of the stars is expressed in magnitudes. We may distinguish between the _apparent_ magnitude (_m_) and the _absolute_ magnitude (_M_), the latter being equal to the value of the apparent magnitude supposing the star to be situated at a distance of one siriometer.  The apparent magnitude may be either the _photographic_ magnitude (_m′_), obtained from a photographic plate, or the _visual_ magnitude (_m_) obtained with the eye.  The difference between these magnitudes is called the _colour-index_ (_c_ = _m′_-_m_).  IV. _The characteristics of the stellar radiation_ are the mean wave-length (λ_0) and the dispersion (σ) in the wave-length. _The mean wave-length_ may be either directly determined (perhaps as _effective_ wave-length) or found from the spectral type (spectral index) or from the colour-index.  There are in all eight attributes of the stars which may be found from the observations:--the spherical position of the star (_l_, _b_), its distance (_r_), proper motion (_u_0_ and _v_0_), radial velocity (_W_), apparent magnitude (_m_ or _m′_), absolute magnitude (_M_), spectral type (_Sp_) or spectral index (_s_), and colour-index (_c_). Of these the colour-index, the spectral type, the absolute magnitude and also (to a certain degree) the radial velocity may be considered as independent of the place of the observer and may therefore be considered not as only apparent but also as _absolute_ attributes of the stars.  Between three of these attributes (_m_, _M_ and _r_) a mathematical relation exists so that one of them is known as soon as the other two have been found from observations.

In this chapter I shall give a short account of the publications in which the most complete information on the attributes of the stars may be obtained, with short notices of the contents and genesis of these publications. It is, however, not my intention to give a history of these researches. We shall consider more particularly the questions relating to the position of the stars, their motion, magnitude, and spectra.   19. _Place of the stars._ _Durchmusterungs._ The most complete data on the position of the stars are obtained from the star catalogues known as “Durchmusterungs”. There are two such catalogues, which together cover the whole sky, one--visual--performed in Bonn and called the _Bonner Durchmusterung_ (B. D.), the other--photographic--performed in Cape _The Cape Photographic Durchmusterung_ (C. P. D.). As the first of these catalogues has long been--and is to some extent even now--our principal source for the study of the sky and is moreover the first enterprise of this kind, I shall give a somewhat detailed account of its origin and contents, as related by ARGELANDER in the introduction to the B. D.  B. D. was planned and performed by the Swedish-Finn ARGELANDER (born in Memel 1799). A scholar of BESSEL he was first called as director in Åbo, then in Hälsingfors, and from there went in 1836 to Bonn, where in the years 1852 to 1856 he performed this great _Durchmusterung_. As instrument he used a FRAUENHOFER comet-seeker with an aperture of 76 mm, a focal length of 650 mm, and 10 times magnifying power. The field of sight had an extension of 6°.  In the focus of the objective was a semicircular piece of thin glass, with the edge (= the diameter of the semicircle) parallel to the circle of declination. This edge was sharply ground, so that it formed a narrow dark line perceptible at star illumination. Perpendicular to this diameter (the “hour-line”) were 10 lines, at each side of a middle line, drawn at a distance of 7′. These lines were drawn with black oil colour on the glass.  The observations are performed by the observer A and his assistant B. A is in a dark room, lies on a chair having the eye at the ocular and can easily look over 2° in declination. The assistant sits in the room below, separated by a board floor, at the _Thiede_ clock.  From the beginning of the observations the declination circle is fixed at a certain declination (whole degrees). All stars passing the field at a distance smaller than one degree from the middle line are observed. Hence the name “Durchmusterung”. When a star passes the “hour line” the magnitude is called out by A, and noted by B together with the time of the clock. Simultaneously the declination is noted by A in the darkness. On some occasions 30 stars may be observed in a minute.  The first observation was made on Febr. 25, 1852, the last on March 27, 1859. In all there were 625 observation nights with 1841 “zones”. The total number of stars was 324198.  The catalogue was published by ARGELANDER in three parts in the years 1859, 1861 and 1862[7] and embraces all stars between the pole and 2° south of the equator brighter than 9m.5, according to the scale of ARGELANDER (his aim was to register all stars up to the 9th magnitude). To this scale we return later. The catalogue is arranged in"]]]
