Navigation was obviously done by compass on this almost featureless desert. The car was equipped with an electrically operated gyrocompass, of no use to him now. But he did use it to check the direction of Hovedstad, as he remembered it from the map, and found it lined up perfectly with the tracks the car had cut into the sand. It had come directly from the city. They could find their way by back-tracking.  Time was slipping away. He would have liked to bury Ihjel and the men from the car, but the night hours were too valuable to be wasted. The best he could do was put the three corpses in the car, for protection from the Disan animals. He locked the door and threw the key as far as he could into the blackness. Lea had slipped into a restless sleep and he carefully shook her awake.  \"Come,\" Brion said. \"We have a little walking to do.\"     VII   With the cool air and firmly packed sand under foot, walking should have been easy. Lea spoiled that. The concussion seemed to have temporarily cut off the reasoning part of her brain, leaving a direct connection to her vocal cords. As she stumbled along, only half conscious, she mumbled all of her darkest fears that were better left unvoiced. Occasionally there was relevancy in her complaints. They would lose their way, never find the city, die of thirst, freezing, heat or hunger. Interspersed and entwined with these were fears from her past that still floated, submerged in the timeless ocean of her subconscious. Some Brion could understand, though he tried not to listen. Fears of losing credits, not getting the highest grade, falling behind, a woman alone in a world of men, leaving school, being lost, trampled among the nameless hordes that struggled for survival in the crowded city-states of Earth.  There were other things she was afraid of that made no sense to a man of Anvhar. Who were the alkians that seemed to trouble her? Or what was canceri? Daydle and haydle? Who was Manstan, whose name kept coming up, over and over, each time accompanied by a little moan?  Brion stopped and picked her up in both arms. With a sigh she settled against the hard width of his chest and was instantly asleep. Even with the additional weight he made better time now, and he stretched to his fastest, kilometre-consuming stride to make good use of these best hours.  Somewhere on a stretch of gravel and shelving rock he lost the track of the sand car. He wasted no time looking for it. By carefully watching the glistening stars rise and set he had made a good estimate of the geographic north. Dis didn't seem to have a pole star; however, a boxlike constellation turned slowly around the invisible point of the pole. Keeping this positioned in line with his right shoulder guided him on the westerly course he needed.  When his arms began to grow tired he lowered Lea gently to the ground; she didn't wake. Stretching for an instant, before taking up his burden again, Brion was struck by the terrible loneliness of the desert. His breath made a vanishing mist against the stars; all else was darkness and silence. How distant he was from his home, his people, his planet! Even the constellations of the night sky were different. He was used to solitude, but this was a loneliness that touched some deep-buried instinct. A shiver that wasn't from the desert cold touched lightly along his spine, prickling at the hairs on his neck.  It was time to go on. He shrugged the disquieting sensations off and carefully tied Lea into the jacket he had been wearing. Slung like a pack on his back, it made the walking easier. The gravel gave way to sliding dunes of sand that seemed to continue to infinity. It was a painful, slipping climb to the top of each one, then an equally difficult descent to the black-pooled hollow at the foot of the next.  With the first lightening of the sky in the east he stopped, breath rasping in his chest, to mark his direction before the stars faded. One line scratched in the sand pointed due north, a second pointed out the course they should follow. When they were aligned to his satisfaction he washed his mouth out with a single swallow of water and sat on the sand next to the still form of the girl.  Gold fingers of fire searched across the sky, wiping out the stars. It was magnificent; Brion forgot his fatigue in appreciation. There should be some way of preserving it. A quatrain would be best. Short enough to be remembered, yet requiring attention and skill to compact everything into it. He had scored high with his quatrains in the Twenties. This would be a special one. Taind, his poetry mentor, would have to get a copy.  \"What are you mumbling about?\" Lea asked, looking up at the craggy blackness of his profile against the reddening sky.  \"Poem,\" he said. \"Shhh. Just a minute.\"  It was too much for Lea, coming after the tension and dangers of the night. She began to laugh, laughing even harder when he scowled at her. Only when she heard the tinge of growing hysteria did she make an attempt to break off the laughter. The sun cleared the horizon, washing a sudden warmth over them. Lea gasped.  \"Your throat's been cut! You're bleeding to death!\"  \"Not really,\" he said, touching his fingertips lightly against the blood-clotted wound that circled his neck. \"Just superficial.\"  Depression sat on him as he suddenly remembered the battle and death of the previous night. Lea didn't notice his face; she was busy digging in the pack he had thrown down. He had to use his fingers to massage and force away the grimace of pain that twisted his mouth. Memory was more painful than the wound. How easily he had killed! Three men. How close to the surface of the civilized man the animal dwelled! In countless matches he had used those holds, always drawing back from the exertion of the full killing power. They were part of a game, part of the Twenties. Yet when his friend had been killed he had become a killer himself. He believed in nonviolence and the sanctity of life--until the first test, when he had killed without hesitation. More ironic was the fact he really felt no guilt, even now. Shock at the change, yes. But no more than that.  \"Lift your chin,\" Lea said, brandishing the antiseptic applicator she had found in the medicine kit. He lifted his chin obligingly and the liquid drew a cool, burning line across his neck. Antibio pills would do a lot more good, since the wound was completely clotted by now, but he didn't speak his thoughts aloud. For the moment Lea had forgotten herself in taking care of him. He put some of the antiseptic on her scalp bruise and she squeaked, pulling back. They both swallowed the pills.  \"That sun is hot already,\" Lea said, peeling off her heavy clothing. \"Let's find a nice cool cave or an air-cooled saloon to crawl into for the day.\"  \"I don't think there are any here. Just sand. We have to walk--\"  \"I know we have to walk,\" she interrupted. \"There's no need for a lecture about it. You're as seriously cubical as the Bank of Terra. Relax. Count ten and start again.\" Lea was making empty talk while she listened to the memory of hysteria tittering at the fringes of her brain.  \"No time for that. We have to keep going.\" Brion climbed slowly to his feet after stowing everything in the pack. When he sighted along his marker at the western horizon he saw nothing to mark their course, only the marching dunes. He helped Lea to her feet and began walking slowly towards them.  \"Just hold on a second,\" Lea called after him. \"Where do you think you're going?\"  \"In that direction,\" he said, pointing. \"I hoped there would be some landmarks, but there aren't. We'll have to keep on by dead reckoning. The sun will keep us pretty well on course. If we aren't there by night the stars will be a better guide.\"  \"All this on an empty stomach? How about breakfast? I'm hungry--and thirsty.\"  \"No food.\" He shook the canteen that gurgled emptily. It had been only partly filled when he found it. \"The water's low and we'll need it later.\"  \"I need it now,\" she said shortly. \"My mouth tastes like an unemptied ashtray and I'm dry as paper.\"  \"Just a single swallow,\" he said after the briefest hesitation. \"This is all we have.\"  Lea sipped at it with her eyes closed in appreciation. Then he sealed the top and returned it to the pack without taking any himself. They were sweating as they started up the first dune.  The desert was barren of life; they were the only things moving under that merciless sun. Their shadows pointed the way ahead of them, and as the shadows shortened the heat rose. It had an intensity Lea had never experienced before, a physical weight that pushed at her with a searing hand. Her clothing was sodden with perspiration, and it trickled burning into her eyes. The light and heat made it hard to see, and she leaned on the immovable strength of Brion's arm. He walked on steadily, apparently ignoring the heat and discomfort.  \"I wonder if those things are edible--or store water?\" Brion's voice was a harsh rasp. Lea blinked and squinted at the leathery shape on the summit of the dune. Plant or animal, it was hard to tell. It was the size of a man's head, wrinkled and grey as dried-out leather, knobbed with thick spikes. Brion pushed it up with his toe and they had a brief glimpse of a white roundness, like a shiny taproot, going down into the dune. Then the thing contracted, pulling itself lower into the sand. At the same instant something thin and sharp lashed out through a fold in the skin, striking at Brion's boot and withdrawing. There was a scratch on the hard plastic, beaded with drops of green liquid.  \"Probably poison,\" he said, digging his toe into the sand. \"This thing is too mean to fool with--without a good reason. Let's keep going.\"  It was before noon when Lea fell down. She really wanted to go on, but her body wouldn't obey. The thin soles of her shoes were no protection against the burning sand and her feet were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21876"],["title","Mary Louise and the Liberty Girls (#0)"],["body","Louise and the Liberty Girls  By Edith Van Dyne  Author of \"Mary Louise,\" \"Mary Louise in the Country,\" \"Mary Louise Solves a Mystery,\" \"The Aunt Jane's Nieces Series,\" etc.   Frontispiece by Alice Casey  The Reilly & Lee Co. Chicago   Copyright, 1918 by The Reilly & Britton Co. --- _Made in the U.S.A._    _Mary Louise and the Liberty Girls_    JUST A WORD  The object of this little story is not especially to encourage loyalty and devotion to one's country, for these are sentiments firmly enshrined in the hearts of all true American girls. It is rather intended to show what important tasks girls may accomplish when spurred on by patriotism, and that none is too humble to substantially serve her country.  Organizations of Liberty Girls are possible in every city and hamlet in America, and are effective not only in times of war but in times of peace, for always their Country needs them--always there is work for their busy hands.  One other message the story hopes to carry--the message of charity towards all and malice towards none. When shadows are darkest, those who can lighten the gloom are indeed the blessed ones.

The masses completely filled the big public square. The flaring torches, placed at set intervals, lighted fitfully the faces of the people--faces sober, earnest, thoughtful--all turned in the direction of the speakers' platform.  Mr. Peter Conant, the Chairman, a prominent attorney of Dorfield, was introducing the orator of the evening, Colonel James Hathaway, whose slender, erect form and handsome features crowned with snow-white hair, arrested the attention of all.  \"You have been told,\" began the old colonel in a clear, ringing voice, \"of our Nation's imperative needs. Money must be provided to conduct the great war on which we have embarked--money for our new army, money for ship-building, money for our allies. And the people of America are permitted to show their loyalty and patriotism by subscribing for bonds--bonds of the rich and powerful United States--that all may participate in our noble struggle for the salvation of democracy and the peace of the world. These bonds, which you are asked to buy, bear interest; you will be investing in the Corporation of Right, Justice and Freedom, with the security of the Nation as your shield. As a stockholder in this noblest of corporations you risk nothing, but you gain the distinction of personally assisting to defeat Civilization's defiant and ruthless enemy.\"  Loud applause interrupted the speaker. On one of the rows of seats at the back of the stand sat Mary Louise Burrows, the granddaughter of Colonel Hathaway, with several of her girl friends, and her heart leaped with pride to witness the ovation accorded her dear \"Gran'pa Jim.\"  With well chosen words the old gentleman continued his discourse, stating succinctly the necessity of the Liberty Bond issue and impressing upon his hearers the righteousness of the cause for which this money was required.  \"The allotment of Dorfield,\" he added, \"is one million dollars, seemingly a huge sum for our little city to raise and invest, but really insignificant when apportioned among those who can afford to subscribe. There is not a man among you who cannot without hardship purchase at least one fifty-dollar bond. Many of you can invest thousands. Yet we are approaching our time limit and, so far, less than two hundred thousand dollars' worth of these magnificent Liberty Bonds have been purchased in our community! But five days remain to us to subscribe the remaining eight hundred thousand dollars, and thereby preserve the honor of our fair city. That eight hundred thousand dollars will be subscribed! We _must_ subscribe it; else will the finger of scorn justly be pointed at us forever after.\"  Another round of applause. Mr. Conant, and Mr. Jaswell, the banker, and other prominent members of the Liberty Loan Committee began to look encouraged and to take heart.  \"Of course they'll subscribe it!\" whispered Mary Louise to her friend Alora Jones. \"The thing has looked like a failure, lately, but I knew if Gran'pa Jim talked to the slackers, they'd see their plain duty. Gran'pa Jim knows how to stir them to action.\"  Gradually the applause subsided. The faces of the multitude that thronged about the stand seemed to Mary Louise stern and resolved, determined to prove their loyalty and devotion to their country.  And now Mr. Jaswell advanced and seated himself at a table, while Mr. Conant requested those present to come forward and enter their subscriptions for the bonds. He urged them to subscribe generously, in proportion to their means, and asked them not to crowd but to pass in line across the platform as swiftly as possible.  \"Let us raise that entire eight hundred thousand to-night!\" shouted the Colonel, in clarion tones. Then the band struck up a popular war tune, and the banker dipped a pen in ink and held it ready for the onslaught of signers.  But no one came forward. Each man looked curiously at his neighbor but stood fast in his place. The city, even to its furthermost suburbs, had already been systematically canvassed by the Committee and their efforts had resulted in a bare two hundred thousand dollars. Of this sum, Colonel Hathaway had himself subscribed twenty-five thousand. Noting the hesitation of his townsmen, the old gentleman again arose and faced them. The band had stopped playing and there was an ominous silence.  \"Let me encourage you,\" said Colonel Hathaway, \"by taking another twenty-five thousand dollars' worth of these wonderful bonds. Put me down for that amount, Mr. Jaswell. Now, then, who are the patriots eager to follow my lead!\"  There was applause--somewhat more mild in character--but none came forward. Alora's father, Jason Jones, who had already signed for fifty thousand dollars, rose and added another twenty-five thousand to that sum. This act elicited another ripple of applause; more questioning looks were exchanged between those assembled, but there were no further offers to subscribe.  The hearts of the committeemen fell. Was this meeting, on which they had so greatly depended, destined to prove a failure, after all?  Jake Kasker, the owner of \"Kasker's Clothing Emporium,\" finally made his way to the platform and mounting the steps faced his townspeople. There was a little murmur of surprise and a sudden tension. The man had been distrusted in Dorfield, of late.  \"You all know what I think about this war,\" said Kasker in a loud voice and with a slight German accent. \"I don't approve of it, whatever anyone says, and I think we were wrong to get into it, anyhow.\"  A storm of hisses and cries of \"Shame!\" saluted him, but he waited stolidly for the demonstration to subside. Then he continued:  \"But, whatever I think about the war, I want to tell you that this flag that now waves over my head is as much _my_ flag as it is _yours,_ for I'm an American citizen. Where that flag goes, Jake Kasker will follow, no matter what fools carry the standard. If they don't think I'm too old to go to France, I'll pack up and go to-morrow. That's Jake Kasker--with a Dutch name but a Yankee heart. Some of you down there got Yankee names an' hearts that make the Kaiser laugh. I wouldn't trade with you! Now, hear this: I ain't rich; you know that; but I'll take two thousand dollars' worth of Liberty Bonds.\"  Some one laughed, jeeringly. Another shouted:  \"Make it three thousand, Jake!\"  \"I will,\" said Kasker; \"and, if there ain't enough of you war-crazy, yellow-hearted patriots in Dorfield to take what we got to take, then I'll make it five thousand. But if I have to do that--an' I can't afford it, but I'll do it!--it's me, Jake Kasker, that'll cry 'Shame!' and hiss like a goose whenever you slackers pass my door.\"  There was more laughter, a few angry shouts, and a movement toward the platform. The German signed the paper Mr. Jaswell placed before him and withdrew. Soon there was a line extending from the banker's table to the crowd below, and the signatures for bonds were slowly but steadily secured.  Colonel Hathaway faced the German clothier, who stood a few paces back, a cynical grin upon his features.  \"Thank you, Kasker,\" said the old gentleman, in a cold voice. \"You have really helped us, although you should have omitted those traitorous words. They poisoned a deed you might have been proud of.\"  \"We don't agree, Colonel,\" replied Kasker, with a shrug. \"When I talk, I'm honest; I say what I think.\" He turned and walked away and Colonel Hathaway looked after him with an expression of dislike.  \"I wonder why he did it?\" whispered Mary Louise, who had overheard the exchange of words and marked Kasker's dogged opposition.  \"He bought the bonds as a matter of business,\" replied Laura Hilton. \"It's a safe investment, and Kasker knows it. Besides that, he may have an idea it would disarm suspicion.\"  \"Also,\" added Alora Jones, \"he took advantage of the opportunity to slam the war. That was worth something to a man like Kasker.\"   CHAPTER II MARY LOUISE TAKES COMMAND  When Mary Louise entered the library the next morning she found her grandfather seated at the table, his head resting on"]]]
