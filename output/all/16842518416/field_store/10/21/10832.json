You rate it, too, after what you've done and the bonehead treatment you got--but especially for not selling out.\"     XII   The night editor read the bulletin just off the teletype.  \"Well, what do you know!\" he said. \"We just recognized Mastodonia.\"  He looked at the copy chief.  \"Where the hell is Mastodonia?\" he asked.  The copy chief shrugged. \"Don't ask me. You're the brains in this joint.\"  \"Well, let's get a map for the next edition,\" said the night editor.     XIII   Tabby, the saber-tooth, dabbed playfully at Cooper with his mighty paw.  Cooper kicked him in the ribs--an equally playful gesture.  Tabby snarled at him.  \"Show your teeth at me, will you!\" said Cooper. \"Raised you from a kitten and that's the gratitude you show. Do it just once more and I'll belt you in the chops.\"  Tabby lay down blissfully and began to wash his face.  \"Some day,\" warned Hudson, \"that cat will miss a meal and that's the day you're it.\"  \"Gentle as a dove,\" Cooper assured him. \"Wouldn't hurt a fly.\"  \"Well, one thing about it, nothing dares to bother us with that monstrosity around.\"  \"Best watchdog there ever was. Got to have something to guard all this stuff we've got. When Wes gets back, we'll be millionaires. All those furs and ginseng and the ivory.\"  \"_If_ he gets back.\"  \"He'll be back. Quit your worrying.\"  \"But it's been five years,\" Hudson protested.  \"He'll be back. Something happened, that's all. He's probably working on it right now. Could be that he messed up the time setting when he repaired the unit or it might have been knocked out of kilter when Buster hit the helicopter. That would take a while to fix. I don't worry that he won't come back. What I can't figure out is why did he go and leave us?\"  \"I've told you,\" Hudson said. \"He was afraid it wouldn't work.\"  \"There wasn't any need to be scared of that. We never would have laughed at him.\"  \"No. Of course we wouldn't.\"  \"Then what _was_ he scared of?\" Cooper asked.  \"If the unit failed and we knew it failed, Wes was afraid we'd try to make him see how hopeless and insane it was. And he knew we'd probably convince him and then all his hope would be gone. And he wanted to hang onto that, Johnny. He wanted to hang onto his hope even when there wasn't any left.\"  \"That doesn't matter now,\" said Cooper. \"What counts is that he'll come back. I can feel it in my bones.\"  And here's another case, thought Hudson, of hope begging to be allowed to go on living.  God, he thought, I wish I could be that blind!  \"Wes is working on it right now,\" said Cooper confidently.     XIV   He was. Not he alone, but a thousand others, working desperately, knowing that the time was short, working not alone for two men trapped in time, but for the peace they all had dreamed about--that the whole world had yearned for through the ages.  For to be of any use, it was imperative that they could zero in the time machines they meant to build as an artilleryman would zero in a battery of guns, that each time machine would take its occupants to the same instant of the past, that their operation would extend over the same period of time, to the exact second.  It was a problem of control and calibration--starting with a prototype that was calibrated, as its finest adjustment, for jumps of 50,000 years.  Project Mastodon was finally under way."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22217"],["title","My Reminiscences (#0)"],["body","Team at https://www.pgdp.net             *       *       *       *       *      +------------------------------------------------------------+     | Transcriber's Note:                                        |     |                                                            |     | Obvious typographical errors have been corrected in        |     | this text.

Published April, 1917.     TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE   These Reminiscences were written and published by the Author in his fiftieth year, shortly before he started on a trip to Europe and America for his failing health in 1912. It was in the course of this trip that he wrote for the first time in the English language for publication.  In these memory pictures, so lightly, even casually presented by the author there is, nevertheless, revealed a connected history of his inner life together with that of the varying literary forms in which his growing self found successive expression, up to the point at which both his soul and poetry attained maturity.  This lightness of manner and importance of matter form a combination the translation of which into a different language is naturally a matter of considerable difficulty. It was, in any case, a task which the present Translator, not being an original writer in the English language, would hardly have ventured to undertake, had there not been other considerations. The translator's familiarity, however, with the persons, scenes, and events herein depicted made it a temptation difficult for him to resist, as well as a responsibility which he did not care to leave to others not possessing these advantages, and therefore more liable to miss a point, or give a wrong impression.  The Translator, moreover, had the author's permission and advice to make a free translation, a portion of which was completed and approved by the latter before he left India on his recent tour to Japan and America.  In regard to the nature of the freedom taken for the purposes of the translation, it may be mentioned that those suggestions which might not have been as clear to the foreign as to the Bengali reader have been brought out in a slightly more elaborate manner than in the original text; while again, in rare cases, others which depend on allusions entirely unfamiliar to the non-Indian reader, have been omitted rather than spoil by an over-elaboration the simplicity and naturalness which is the great feature of the original.  There are no footnotes in the original. All the footnotes here given have been added by the Translator in the hope that they may be of further assistance to the foreign reader.

He takes in and leaves out according to his taste. He makes many a big thing small and small thing big. He has no compunction in putting into the background that which was to the fore, or bringing to the front that which was behind. In short he is painting pictures, and not writing history.  Thus, over Life's outward aspect passes the series of events, and within is being painted a set of pictures. The two correspond but are not one.  We do not get the leisure to view thoroughly this studio within us. Portions of it now and then catch our eye, but the greater part remains out of sight in the darkness. Why the ever-busy painter is painting; when he will have done; for what gallery his pictures are destined--who can tell?  Some years ago, on being questioned as to the events of my past life, I had occasion to pry into this picture-chamber. I had thought to be content with selecting some few materials for my Life's story. I then discovered, as I opened the door, that Life's memories are not Life's history, but the original work of an unseen Artist. The variegated colours scattered about are not reflections of outside lights, but belong to the painter himself, and come passion-tinged from his heart; thereby unfitting the record on the canvas for use as evidence in a court of law.  But though the attempt to gather precise history from memory's storehouse may be fruitless, there is a fascination in looking over the pictures, a fascination which cast its spell on me.  The road over which we journey, the wayside shelter in which we pause, are not pictures while yet we travel--they are too necessary, too obvious. When, however, before turning into the evening resthouse, we look back upon the cities, fields, rivers and hills which we have been through in Life's morning, then, in the light of the passing day, are they pictures indeed. Thus, when my opportunity came, did I look back, and was engrossed.  Was this interest aroused within me solely by a natural affection for my own past? Some personal feeling, of course, there must have been, but the pictures had also an independent artistic value of their own. There is no event in my reminiscences worthy of being preserved for all time. But the quality of the subject is not the only justification for a record. What one has truly felt, if only it can be made sensible to others, is always of importance to one's fellow men. If pictures which have taken shape in memory can be"]]]
