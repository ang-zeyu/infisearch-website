Several new plays, which none of them had heard of before, were introduced. The boys and girls all liked them very well, and the time passed away most rapidly.  Just before they were going to supper, an old man, with a fiddle in his hand, tottered into the garden, and down the lawn. He was a very queer-looking old man. He had long white hair, and a long white beard.  He was dressed in old, worn-out, soldier clothes, in part, and had a sailor's hat upon his head, so that they could not tell whether he was a soldier or a sailor.  As he approached the children, they began to laugh with all their might; and he certainly was a very funny old man. His long beard and hair, his tattered finery, and his hobbling walk, would have made almost any one laugh--much more a company of children as full of fun as those who were attending the birthday party.  \"Children,\" said the old man, as he took off his hat and made a low bow, \"I heard there was a party here, and I came to play the fiddle for you. All the boys and girls like a fiddle, because it is so merry.\"  \"O mother! what did send that old man here?\" cried Flora.  \"He came of himself, I suppose,\" replied Mrs. Lee, laughing.  \"I think it is too bad to laugh at an old man like him,\" added Flora.  \"It would be, if he were in distress; but don't you see he is as merry as any of the children?\"  \"Play us some tunes,\" said the children.  \"I will, my little dears;\" and the old man raised the fiddle. \"Let's see--I will play 'Napoleon's Grand March.'\"  The fiddler played, but he behaved so queerly that the children laughed so loud they could hardly hear the music.  \"Why, that's 'Yankee Doodle,'\" said Henry Vernon; and they all shouted at the idea of calling that tune \"Napoleon's Grand March.\"  \"Now I will play you the solo to the opera of 'La Sonnambula,'\" said the old man.  \"Whew!\" said Henry.  The old man fiddled again, with the same funny movements as before.  \"Why, that's 'Yankee Doodle' too!\" exclaimed Henry.  \"I guess he don't know any other tune.\"  \"You like that tune so well, I will play you 'Washington's March;'\" and the funny old fiddler, with a great flourish, began to play again; but still it was \"Yankee Doodle.\"  And so he went on saying he would play many different tunes, but he played nothing but \"Yankee Doodle.\"  \"Can't you tell us a story now?\" asked Charley Green.  \"O, yes, my little man, I can tell you a story. What shall it be?\"  \"Are you a soldier or a sailor?\"  \"Neither, my boy.\"  \"The story! the story!\" shouted the boys, very much excited.  \"Some years ago I was in New York,\" the old man commenced.  \"Did you see me there?\" demanded Tommy Woggs.  \"Well, my little man, I don't remember that I saw you.\"  \"O, I was there;\" and Tommy thrust his hands down to the bottom of his pockets, and strutted up the space between the children and the comical old fiddler.  \"I did see a very nice-looking little gentleman----\"  \"That was me,\" pompously added Tommy.  \"He was stalking up Broadway. He thought every body was looking at and admiring him; but such was not the case. He looked just like--just like----\"  \"Like me?\" asked Tommy.  \"Like a sick monkey,\" replied the fiddler.  \"Go on with your story.\"  \"I will, children. Several years ago I was in New York. It is a great city; if you don't believe it, ask Master Tommy Woggs.\"  \"You tell the truth, Mr. Fiddler. It is a great city, and I have been all over it, and can speak from observation,\" replied Master Woggs.  \"The story!\" shouted the children.  \"I was walking up Broadway. This street is always crowded with people, as well as with carts and carriages.\"  \"I have seen that street,\" said Tommy.  \"Now you keep still a few minutes, Tommy, if you can,\" interposed Mrs. Lee.  \"At the corner of Wall Street----\"  \"I know where that is,\" exclaimed Tommy.  \"At the corner of Wall Street there was a man with a kind of cart, loaded with apples and candy, which he was selling to the passers-by. Suddenly there came a stage down the street, and ran into the apple cart.\"  \"I saw the very same thing done,\" added Tommy, with his usual self-important air.  \"Keep still, Tom Woggs,\" said Charley Green.  \"The apples were scattered all over the sidewalk; yet the man picked up all but one of them, though he was very angry with the driver of the stage for running against his cart.\"  \"Why didn't he pick up the other apple?\" asked Henry.  \"A well-dressed man, with big black whiskers, picked that up. 'Give it to me,' said the apple man. 'I will not,' replied the man with whiskers. The apple merchant was as mad as he could be; and then the man with black whiskers put his hand in his pocket and drew out a knife. The blade was six inches long.\"  \"O, dear me!\" exclaimed Flora.  \"Raising the knife, he at once moved towards the angry apple merchant, and--and----\"  \"Well, what?\" asked several, eagerly.  \"And cut a piece out of the apple, and put it in his mouth.\"  The children all laughed heartily, for they were sure the man with the whiskers was going to stab the apple merchant.  \"He then took two cents from his pocket, paid for the apple, and went his way,\" continued the old man. \"Now, there is one thing more I can do. I want to run a race with these boys.\"  \"Pooh! You run a race!\" sneered Charley.  \"I can beat you.\"  \"Try it, and see.\"  The old man and Charley took places, and were to start at the word from Henry. But when it was given, the fiddler hobbled off, leaving Charley to follow at his leisure.  When the old man had got half way round the lawn, Charley started, sure he could catch him long before he reached the goal. But just as the boy was coming up with the man, the latter began to run, and poor Charley found, much to his surprise, that he ran very fast. He was unable to overtake him, and consequently lost the race.  The children were much astonished when they saw the old man run so fast. He appeared to have grown young all at once. But he offered to race with any of the boys again; and half a dozen of them agreed to run with him.  \"I guess I will take my coat off this time,\" said the fiddler.  As he threw away the coat, he slipped off the wig and false beard he wore; and the children found, to their surprise, that the old man was Mr. Lee, who had dressed himself up in this disguise to please them.  The supper was now ready, and all the children were invited to the tent. They had played so hard that all of them had excellent appetites, and the supper was just as nice as a supper could be.  It was now nearly dark, and the children had to go home; but all of them declared the birthday party of Flora was the best they ever attended.  \"Only to think,\" said Flora, when she went to bed that night, \"the old fiddler was my father!\"     LIZZIE.       Mother, what ails our Lizzie dear,       So cold and still she lies?     She does not speak a word to-day,       And closed her soft blue eyes.     Why won't she look at me again,       And laugh and play once more?     I cannot make her look at me       As she used to look before.      Her face and neck as marble white,       And, O, so very cold!     Why don't you warm her, mother dear,       Your cloak around her fold?     Her little hand is cold as ice,       Upon her waveless breast,--     So pure, I thought I could see through       The little hand I pressed.      Your darling sister's dead, my child;       She cannot see you now;     The damps of death are gath'ring there       Upon her marble brow.     She cannot speak to you again,       Her lips are sealed in death;     That little hand will never move,       Nor come that fleeting breath.      All robed in white, and decked with flowers,       We'll lay her in the tomb;     The flower that bloomed so sweetly here,       No more on earth will bloom;     But in our hearts we'll lay her up,       And love her all the more,     Because she died in life's spring time,       Ere earth had won her o'er.      Nay, nay, my child, she is not dead,       Although she slumbers there,     And cold and still her marble brow,       And free from pain and care.     She slept, and passed from earth to heaven,       And won her early crown:     An angel now she dwells above,       And looks in triumph down.      She is not dead, for Jesus died       That she might live again.     \"Forbid them not,\" the Saviour said,       And blessed dear sister then.     Her little lamp this morn went out       On earth's time-bounded shore;     But angels bright in heaven this morn       Relighted it once more.      Some time we, too, shall fall asleep,       To wake in heaven above,     And meet our angel Lizzie there       In realms of endless love.     We'll bear sweet sister in our hearts,       And then there'll ever be     An angel there to keep our souls       From sin and sorrow free."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21909"],["title","A Military Genius (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images generously made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

In commencing the attempt to portray a very remarkable career I had hoped for the coöperation of the person concerned so far, at least, as the supervision of any statements I might find it necessary to make. But it was decided by her friends that it would not be well for her at present to be troubled with new projects, or even informed of them. It was at first a serious disappointment to me and seemed to increase my difficulties, but as I was allowed access to sources of family information I have been enabled to present a sketch, slight and inadequate, but authentic, and greatly desired by many distant friends. With continued improvement in health I trust that the wishes of Miss Carroll's friends may be better met by an autobiography taking the place of the present meager and imperfect sketch.  It should be at once understood that this is not a plea for Miss Carroll.  Her work has but to be fairly presented to speak for itself.  Her claim was settled once and forever by the evidence given before the first Military Committee of 1871, met to consider the claim, and reporting, through Senator Howard, unanimously endorsing every fact. The Assistant Secretary of War, Thomas A. Scott, the Chairman of the Committee for the Conduct of the War, Benjamin F. Wade, and Judge Evans, of Texas, testifying in a manner that was conclusive. These men knew what they were talking about and human testimony could no farther go. Congress, through its committees, has again and again endorsed the claim, and never denied it, being \"adverse\" only to award as involving national recognition.  Our great generals have left us one by one without ever antagonizing the claim, and General Grant advised Miss Carroll to continue to push her claim for recognition.  But this work is to be considered rather in the light of an historical research bearing on questions of the day.  Are our present laws and customs just toward women? Are women ever preëminently fitted for high offices in the State? Is it for our honor and advantage when so fitted to avail ourselves of the whole united intellect and moral power of men and women side by side in peril and in duty? Such a life as this gives to all these questions the authoritative answer of established facts.  NEW YORK, _April 21st, 1891_. (Summer address, Lawrence, Long Island, N. Y.)  Miss Carroll's address is 931 New Hampshire Avenue, Washington, D. C.     A SEARCH FOR THE DOCUMENTS.   Arriving as a stranger in Washington, knowing nothing of libraries and document rooms, Secretaries offices, and War departments, I was at first greatly at a loss. For many years I had had in my possession two very important documents, the last memorial of 1878 and the report of the Military Committee thereon under General Bragg in 1881. With these two in my hand I proceeded to consult the Descriptive Catalogue of the Congressional Library. To my surprise, I found that these two very important documents had been omitted from the index. Calling attention to the fact, we looked them up in the body of the volume and Mr. Spofford immediately added them in pencil together with the other important documents, in Miss Carroll's favor, which had also been omitted. When I made my way to the Senate document room I found that this important Miss. Doc. 58 had been omitted there also, having been set down under another name. Looking it up in the volume of Miscellaneous Documents I again obtained the admission by Mr. Amzi Smith. In the list at the Secretaries office Miss. Doc. 58 was also omitted together with the last report by a Military Committee, under General Bragg, endorsing the claim in the most thorough going way. The index ending with an intermediate report mistakenly designated as _adverse_, though the previous reports were not thus heralded as favorable.  After the first report, as made by Senator Howard and the repeated endorsements made by Wilson and Williams of succeeding Congresses, these two documents are by far the most important and interesting.  The memorial of '78, containing additional evidence explaining some things, otherwise unaccountable, and making some very singular revelations. It is a mine of wealth for the future historian. At the Secretary's office I showed the documents and stated that their exclusion must have been unfavorable to the presentation of the case. I was not equally fortunate in obtaining their immediate admission, but trust the mistake has since been rectified.  The report marked as \"adverse\" would be more truly described as \"admission of the incontestable nature of the evidence in support of the claim,\" admitting the services in every particular and being \"adverse\" only to award involving national recognition.  At the Secretary's office I obtained permission to see the file of the 41st Congress, 2d. session. There I saw the first short memorial with the plan of campaign attached as described by Thomas Scott. Then my investigations were temporarily ended by the outside of a document being shown me stating that the papers had been withdrawn by Samuel Hunt, thus agreeing with the statement made by him in Miss. Doc. 58, that they had been stolen from his desk while the committee were examining the claim.  I found it very difficult to obtain the earlier documents. \"Supply exhausted\" being the answer that has long been given, but all can be looked up in the bound volumes.  When, at length, fairly started in my work I was disturbed by a rumor that Miss Carroll's papers, formerly placed on file at the War Department, were no longer to be found there. I set out as far as possible to investigate. Provided with an excellent letter of introduction to the Secretary of War I made my way, on March 6, 1891, to the vast building of the War Department and sent in my letter with a list of the documents I wanted to see. Miss Carroll's Military papers, given in the Miss. Doc. 58, and a list of letters from the same memorial by Wade, Scott, and Evans.  The "]]]
