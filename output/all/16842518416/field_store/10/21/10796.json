But you would be wrong, for if you dropped those marbles a thousand, yes, a million times, the pattern would be different each time. After tens of billions of experiments you might be able to find the proportion of patterns, but the result would never be of practical use.  \"It's the same way with the weather. We know well enough how to do the things that would enable us to prophesy a long time in advance what the weather is going to be, but the problem approaches impossibility because there are too many factors that enter into the calculation. We're learning all the time, but it's a big piece of work and needs big men to do it. That's why, Anton, I can't tell you why this particular district had more rain this year than it has had for several seasons past.\"  Anton, pegging away on his crutch beside the Forecaster, looked up at him with an added eagerness in his eyes.  \"And yet all those things are going on, right where I can see them!\" he exclaimed.  \"Yes,\" the Weather Man answered. \"Some men can explore distant countries, and we envy them; some men can explore the greatest and the smallest things in the world with marvellous scientific instruments and we envy them, too; but every day and all day, and every night and all night, we are surrounded by the World of the Weather, less explored, less known than even the most remote corner of the earth. Why, Anton, if you could simply follow all the various causes that brought about this flood that made you homeless, you would have a story of adventure that would make the most daring explorer green with envy.\"  \"But you do predict floods and rains, Mr. Levin,\" Ross put in. \"Father told me, a week ago, that warnings for this flood had been sent out by the Weather Bureau.\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" the Weather Man answered. \"I should say that weather warnings issued by the Bureau save half a billion dollars to the country every year and prevent the loss of hundreds of lives. All those are short-range predictions. Very few of them cover much more than a week in advance, except, perhaps, a West Indian Hurricane which has been reported from the Antilles, or a flood on the Mississippi which is caused by heavy rains in the upper reaches of the streams flowing into it.\"  \"Well, that's prophesying, isn't it?\"  \"Yes, and no,\" was the reply. \"It's predicting, and it's due to observation. If a storm is moving eastward, with a heavy rainfall, and we've had telegraphic dispatches from all the towns in the west through which it has passed, it's not hard to figure the speed at which the storm is traveling, and it's a sure prediction to tell a city to the eastward of that storm that rain can be expected at about a certain date. Or, if there's a high flood wave at St. Louis, and we know the speed of the Mississippi current, we can notify Greenville, Vicksburg, and New Orleans at what time the trouble is likely to come to them. If no more rain is falling at Greenville and the river is going down there, we can notify Vicksburg that the flood danger is passing away. That's the observational end of the work, and in that line, the Weather Bureau of the United States is the best in the world.\"  The weather expert was proceeding to explain in detail the manner of collecting these observations, when suddenly Anton clutched him by the arm.  \"What's that, Mr. Levin?\" he cried.  The Forecaster looked ahead, then glanced down at the boy with a smile.  \"What does it look like?\" he asked.  \"Why,\" said Anton, \"it looks like a circus tent; you know, the one that was here the week before last.\"  \"It is the circus tent,\" the Forecaster replied. \"When I found that there were a couple of thousand people to be fed and looked after, the only shelter I could think of, that was big enough, was the circus tent. So, late last night, I sent a wagon up there, asking for the loan of the tent for a day or two. And what do you suppose the circus folk did?\"  \"Sent it?\"  \"They sent it, with two of their wagons, a lot of food, their cooking kit, and the two cooks who travel with the circus. What's more, Anton, you remember those two clowns in the show who were so funny?\"  \"You bet I do!\" exclaimed the lad, his eyes shining.  \"They volunteered to come down and help as waiters. They're doing it, too, and it's a right good thing, for every one around in the place is roaring with laughter half the time. Folks work a lot better when they're cheerful.\"  A perfect gale of merriment, which greeted the boys as they neared the tent, showed the truth of the Forecaster's statement. He had greatly understated the work of the circus. Nearly all the performers were there, busily helping the distressed.  \"They're a right kindly folk, the circus people, as a rule,\" remarked the Forecaster.  \"Are they all here?\" queried Anton. \"Goliath, the strong man, the Flying Squirrel Brothers, Androcles, the lion tamer, Princess Tiny and the rest?\"  \"Yes, most of them,\" the Forecaster answered. \"Goliath is in charge of one of the gangs I've got at work on the river front, and the darkies are so proud of being under him that they're working like fury. The Flying Squirrel Brothers--cracker-jack mechanics, both of them--have been fixing up some tackle and machinery that we needed, but I think Androcles stayed back with his lions. I suppose he thought the lions wouldn't do us any good. But if you're not too hungry to wait just for a second--\"  He paused.  \"What?\" queried Anton excitedly.  \"Yes, there they are!\" the Forecaster answered, gazing along the levee.  Both boys followed his glance.  Vast, bulky shadows stood outlined against the distant Arkansas shore and the clearing sky. Unreal they seemed, until it was evident that they were moving.  There, shuffling along with that heavy rolling gait which is unlike that of any other animal in the world, came two colossal elephants.  Anton shrieked with delight.  \"Elephants! Real elephants!\" he cried. \"Oh, Mr. Levin, I haven't ever seen an elephant quite close.\"  He started off up the levee, but the Forecaster called him back.  \"Have your breakfast first, Anton,\" he said; \"you've got all day to look at the elephants. They're the best workers I've got. I'd like to have a gang of them at work on the levee all the time.\"  This sentiment was not shared by Rex. At the first sight of the huge creatures, Lassie had given a low growl. Rex stood silent, with a stillness that Ross knew to be ominous, and just as the Forecaster finished speaking, with an angry growl, he started off to do battle against the elephants. It was a sight to see him, with his hair bristling, rushing forward to dispute the passage of these huge brutes who dared to approach the vicinity of Lassie and the puppies. Only the sharp commands of Ross availed to bring him back, and throughout breakfast he lay well in advance of the tent, watching, and growling loudly every time the elephants passed, dragging the flat sleds loaded with sand bags to the cave-in a few hundred yards beyond.  \"I've been wondering,\" began Anton, using the expression most often on his lips, \"why there are so many floods on the Mississippi. Why is it? Lots of rivers I know don't have these awful floods every year.\"  \"I've wondered, too,\" said Ross.  The Weather Man looked at the two boys, then took a cigar out of his pocket.  \"I can't stay away from the levee very long,\" he said, \"but I need a cigar after breakfast, anyway, and I'll tell you why the Mississippi is one of the worst flood rivers in the world and why the safeguarding of the Mississippi is the biggest piece of work to be done in the United States. It's a bigger piece of work than the Panama Canal, and a more difficult piece of work. It means millions of dollars every year to the people of the United States.\"  \"Why is it such a hard job?\"  \"The Mississippi River,\" the Forecaster began, \"is two and a half thousand miles in length; the longest river in the world.\"  \"Longer than the Amazon?\" asked Anton.  \"Yes, a great deal. Besides, it is navigable for nearly two thousand miles, clear from St. Paul, Minnesota, to the Gulf. It drains two-fifths of the area of the United States. To put it another way, all the rain and snow that falls between New York State and Montana sooner or later makes its way into the Mississippi River, except for the rain that is used up by plants and animals or that is evaporated before it reaches the river or that drains by underground seepage to the ocean. So you see what a vast amount of water it must carry. Now, boys,\" he continued, \"what kind of banks has the river around here, rock or earth?\"  \"Mud!\" answered Ross, tersely.  \"Right,\" the Forecaster agreed, \"and it is mud nearly all the way along. But do you know what mud is?\"  This was rather a poser, but finally Anton said slowly,  \"It's a mixture of earth and water, isn't it?\"  The Forecaster looked shrewdly at the boy.  \"You've hit it just right,\" he said, \"mud is earth or soil that has been washed down by the river. That's what makes the bottom of the river so irregular and why it's always shifting. You can see for yourselves, boys, that if the bottom of the Mississippi is just made of light mud, light enough to be carried down as muddy water for hundreds of miles, any little change in the current of the river will stir up that mud again and scoop out a hole. If it happens to be near a bank, the bank will be eaten away and, naturally, will cave right in.\"  \"About how much mud does the Mississippi carry down, Mr. Levin?\" Anton asked.  \"In flood time, as much as a thousand tons a minute will be carried past here.\"  Ross whistled.  \"A thousand tons a minute!\" he exclaimed. \"Why, I should think that would fill up the river in no time.\"  \"It would,\" the Weather Man answered, \"if the river stood still. In flood time, however, the water is flowing rapidly and takes the mud clear down to the delta. That's why there is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22156"],["title","The Boy with the U. S. Weather Men (#7)"],["body","so much new land being made at the mouth of the river. You could buy a piece of land under water now, Ross, if you wanted, and be quite sure that in twenty years' time there would be land there for a farm.\"  \"But a thousand tons a minute!\" the boy repeated, \"that seems huge!\"  \"It is pretty big,\" the Forecaster agreed, \"but I'll show you where it comes from. You know, boys, generally the land slopes down in the direction of the river, doesn't it?\"  \"Yes,\" assented the two boys, \"it's supposed to. But it doesn't here. The lie of the land is away from the river.\"  \"That's just exactly the point,\" the Forecaster declared. \"The banks of the Mississippi range in height from about twenty to forty feet above extreme low water. As the river, in times of flood, rises as high as forty to fifty feet above low water, unless there were levees, the river would overflow its banks every spring or flood time.\"  \"It does, quite often, even yet,\" commented Ross, looking on the flooded scene around him.  \"Well,\" said the Weather Man, \"the present levee system only dates back to the end of the Civil War, although there were levees built during the first settlement of New Orleans, two centuries ago. Remember, though, that the Mississippi has been flowing down its present bed for several hundred thousand years, with a flood every spring, so that the overflow has had its effect. Of course, before the land was broken up by farming, there wasn't as much earth carried down into the river to make mud as there is now.  \"When the Mississippi River, with its heavy sediment, overflows the banks into the swamps, it's easy to see that the current will be slower in the flooded area than in the main bed of the river.\"  \"Of course,\" agreed Ross, \"but what has that got to do with it?\"  \"A great deal,\" the Forecaster replied succinctly. \"The faster a river flows, the more sediment it can carry without allowing it to drop to the bottom; the slower it flows, the more readily is the sediment dropped. If you put some mud in a glass of water and keep stirring it with a spoon, the mud will never sink to the bottom. Even if you let it stand perfectly still, it will take several days before the finest particles sink to the bottom of the glass and the water becomes clear.\"  \"Yes,\" agreed Anton, \"I've often wondered why.\"  \"Well,\" the Weather Man continued, \"if you look closely at the mud in the bottom of the glass, you'll see that the bigger particles are at the bottom and then those a little smaller and so on up, until your top layer is made of a mud composed of particles so fine that you'd have to get a microscope to see them.\"  \"I don't quite see why,\" said Ross. \"I know bigger things are heavier, but why should a big bit of earth sink more quickly than a small bit, when they're both made of just exactly the same stuff?\"  The Weather Man looked at him.  \"Some of these days,\" he said, \"remind me to talk to you about sunlight and dust, and I'll tell you a heap of things you don't know. Right now, get this idea in your head. The larger a piece of matter is, the smaller is the surface in proportion to the bulk. A feather of swan's down will float in a high wind, but if you roll that feather into a ball, it will fall. Why? You haven't made it any heavier. You've only reduced the amount of surface which was borne up by the air. It's the same way with mud, the bigger pieces sink first because they have less surface in proportion to their weight.\"  \"Yes,\" answered Ross, \"I can see that now.\"  \"Very good, then,\" the Forecaster continued, \"when the Mississippi overflowed its banks and the water got out of the current of the main stream, so that it flowed more gently, the sediment began to fall, the larger pieces first and those that were finer until it was only at the most distant point from the river that the finest mud settled. This has gone on, year after year, for thousands of years.  \"Therefore, you see, the lands nearest the river are higher than those farther away. In two big basins, the St. Francis and the Yazoo basins, the slope and the drainage is away from the river, instead of towards it.\"  \"In that case, then,\" said Anton thoughtfully, \"the Mississippi runs in a groove on the top of a hill.\"  \"That's it exactly,\" the Forecaster said, \"and some of the most fertile fields lie in the lowlands made of the fine mud at the bottom of this hill. It's just like that hollow where your house was, Anton. The flood hasn't done much damage south of here because all the waters poured down into that fine plantation land where your place was located.\"  \"What I don't see,\" said Ross, \"is why the Government doesn't build a really high levee all the way along the river. I don't mean just a few feet higher, but a regular wall 'way higher than the river ever goes. I mean a regular stone wall, twice as high as any levee that we've got now. I should think that would make the river behave.\"  \"It would and it wouldn't,\" replied the Weather Man. \"What are you going to build that wall on? On the ground?\"  \"I suppose so,\" said Ross. \"I hadn't thought much about that.\"  \"Indeed you hadn't,\" his friend replied. \"You've got to remember, Ross, that the Mississippi doesn't run in a straight line; it bends and twists like a snake. In the bends the current strikes on the outwardly curving bank, and, as you know, the water is always deep there. This causes a rapid caving and erosion of the bank. At the foot of each bend, the main flow crosses to the other side, where it strikes the bank which has become concave there, and eats into that bank just as, a few hundred yards higher, it has been eating into the opposite one.\"  \"I know you've always got to pilot a boat first on one side of the river and then on the other,\" said Ross thoughtfully.  \"You have. And, if you remember, you'll see that it is generally on the side nearest to the concave shore that the boats pass.\"  \"Yes,\" agreed Ross thoughtfully, \"I guess it is.\"  \"Now, you can easily see,\" the Forecaster continued, \"that the river might keep its own channel clean if it flowed straight down with a current of equal strength. But, as the current crosses from side to side, it slackens speed at each of these crossings. Therefore, as the current becomes slower, it drops some of the heavier particles of sand or mud, forming a bar at every bend, sometimes so high as to prevent navigation.\"  \"That's what the dredges are for, isn't it?\" asked Ross.  \"Yes. The Government has twelve large dredges at work all the time, keeping the navigation channel open.\"  \"I don't see, yet, why the stone wall idea wouldn't work,\" protested Ross.  \"I'm just showing you,\" was the reply. \"If you built your heavy wall on the bank, the water would strike the concave bank at one of these crossings, eat away the earth under the wall and your wall would topple in. Then the current would cross the stream, undermine the bank on the other side and your masonry would crumble there, too. So much for the wall.\"  \"Suppose you sunk that wall, away down deep, below the level of the bottom of the river?\" suggested Ross.  \"That might work,\" the expert replied, \"but it would cost more money than the United States could afford to spend. Besides, Ross, where would you build this wall? Right on the bank?\"  \"Of course.\"  \"But the Mississippi is half a mile wide at some places and three miles wide at others. If the river were absolutely walled in, you'd have swift currents at one place and slow in another. Then your channel would fill up in the wide places and you'd be as badly off as before.\"  \"Make it all the same width, then,\" said Ross.  \"Build two-thirds of the whole two thousand miles by some underwater system, constructing the wall under water? If you had ever read of the difficulty of building one lighthouse foundation, my boy, you wouldn't talk so glibly about building huge retaining masses of masonry under water.\"  \"Suppose it were done, that way, Mr. Levin,\" put in Anton, \"would that settle it all?\"  \"You mean--suppose there was a high masonry wall, making a canal equal in width and height from St. Louis to the Gulf, would that turn the Mississippi into a permanent ship channel? Is that what you mean?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"No, it wouldn't,\" the expert replied. \"What are you going to do with all the little streams that flow into the Mississippi? Think for a minute, boys. You can see that wherever you narrow the banks, the river channel has got to be made deeper to accommodate the water, hasn't it?\"  \"Yes,\" both boys agreed, \"it has.\"  \"In other words, suppose that before you put up this huge masonry wall, the flood crest was fifty feet at Memphis, then, after the wall was built, the flood crest would be seventy-five or a hundred.\"  \"Suppose it were,\" said Ross, \"the wall would hold it in.\"  \"So you think. There are the tributaries to consider. Take the Yazoo, for example. It flows into the main river until the Mississippi reaches the fifty-foot flood level. If you raise the flood level of the Mississippi to seventy-five feet, the water in the main river will be twenty-five feet higher than the water which used to run into it at the fifty-foot level, won't it?\"  Ross whistled.  \"I see where you're coming to,\" he said; \"I'd never have thought of that. Go ahead, Mr. Levin.\"  \"With the water in the main stream twenty-five feet higher than in the tributary, due to your retaining wall, boy, instead of the water in the Yazoo River flowing into the Mississippi, all the water above the fifty-foot level in the Mississippi would flow into the Yazoo. The Yazoo couldn't hold the water, and as the stream backed up, it would overflow its banks. All the low valleys would be flooded in exactly the same way that they were before, only, instead of the floods coming directly through a break in the levee or over the banks of the Mississippi, they would come over the banks of the Yazoo. That would be true of every small river that flows into the Mississippi, and there are scores of them.\"  \"What can be "]]]
