Notwithstanding this solemn compact, a portion of the States did,     without the consent of the others, form a new compact; and there is     nothing to show, or by which it can be shown, that this right has     been, or can be, diminished so long as the States continue     sovereign._  \"The right's the right of self-government--and it's inherent and inalienable!--We fought for it--when didn't we fight for it? When we cease to fight for it, then chaos and night!--Go on, go on!\"      _The Confederation was assented to by the Legislature for each     State; the Constitution by the people of each State, for such State     alone. One is as binding as the other, and no more so.      The Constitution, it is true, established a government, and it     operates directly on the individual; the Confederation was a league     operating primarily on the States. But each was adopted by the State     for itself; in the one case by the Legislature acting for the State;     in the other by the people, not as individuals composing one nation,     but as composing the distinct and independent States to which they     respectively belong.      The foundation, therefore, on which it was established, was FEDERAL,     and the State, in the exercise of the same sovereign authority by     which she ratified for herself, may for herself abrogate and annul.      The operation of its powers, whilst the State remains in the     Confederacy, is NATIONAL; and consequently a State remaining in the     Confederacy and enjoying its benefits cannot, by any mode of     procedure, withdraw its citizens from the obligation to obey the     Constitution and the laws passed in pursuance thereof.      But when a State does secede, the Constitution and laws of the     United States cease to operate therein. No power is conferred on     Congress to enforce them. Such authority was denied to the Congress     in the convention which framed the Constitution, because it would be     an act of war of nation against nation--not the exercise of the     legitimate power of a government to enforce its laws on those     subject to its jurisdiction.      The assumption of such a power would be the assertion of a     prerogative claimed by the British Government to legislate for the     Colonies in all cases whatever; it would constitute of itself a     dangerous attack on the rights of the States, and should be promptly     repelled._  There was a great thunder of assent. \"That is our doctrine--bred in the bone--dyed in the weaving! Jefferson, Madison, Marshall, Washington, Henry--further back yet, further back--back to Magna Charta!\"      _These principles, resulting from the nature of our system of     confederate States, cannot admit of question in Virginia.      In 1788 our people in convention, by their act of ratification,     declared and made known that the powers granted under the     Constitution, being derived from the people of the United States,     may be resumed by them whenever they shall be perverted to their     injury and oppression.      From what people were these powers derived? Confessedly from the     people of each State, acting for themselves. By whom were they to be     resumed or taken back? By the people of the State who were then     granting them away. Who were to determine whether the powers granted     had been perverted to their injury or oppression? Not the whole     people of the United States, for there could be no oppression of the     whole with their own consent; and it could not have entered into the     conception of the Convention that the powers granted could not be     resumed until the oppressor himself united in such resumption.      They asserted the right to resume in order to guard the people of     Virginia, for whom alone the Convention could act, against the     oppression of an irresponsible and sectional majority, the worst     form of oppression with which an angry Providence has ever afflicted     humanity.      Whilst therefore we regret that any State should, in a matter of     common grievance, have determined to act for herself without     consulting with her sister States equally aggrieved, we are     nevertheless constrained to say that the occasion justifies and     loudly calls for action of some kind....      In view therefore of the present condition of our country, and the     causes of it, we declare almost in the words of our fathers,     contained in an address of the freeholders of Botetourt, in     February, 1775, to the delegates from Virginia to the Continental     Congress, \"That we desire no change in our government whilst left to     the free enjoyment of our equal privileges secured by the     CONSTITUTION; but that should a tyrannical SECTIONAL MAJORITY, under     the sanction of the forms of the CONSTITUTION, persist in acts of     injustice and violence toward us, they only must be answerable for     the consequences.\"      That liberty is so strongly impressed upon our hearts that we cannot     think of parting with it but with our lives; that our duty to God,     our country, ourselves and our posterity forbid it; we stand,     therefore, prepared for every contingency._      RESOLVED THEREFORE, _That in view of the facts set out in the     foregoing preamble, it is the opinion of this meeting that a     convention of the people should be called forthwith; that the State     in its sovereign character should consult with the other Southern     States, and agree upon such guarantees as in their opinion will     secure their equality, tranquillity and rights_ WITHIN THE UNION.  The applause shook the air. \"Yes, yes! within the Union! They're not quite mad--not even the black Republicans! We'll save the Union!--We made it, and we'll save it!--Unless the North takes leave of its senses.--Go on!\"      _And in the event of a failure to obtain such guarantees, to adopt     in concert with the other Southern States_, OR ALONE, _such measures     as may seem most expedient to protect the rights and ensure the     safety of the people of Virginia_.  The reader made an end, and stood with dignity. Silence, then a beginning of sound, like the beginning of wind in the forest. It grew, it became deep and surrounding as the atmosphere, it increased into the general voice of the county, and the voice passed the Botetourt Resolutions.     CHAPTER II  THE HILLTOP   On the court house portico sat the prominent men of the county, lawyers and planters, men of name and place, moulders of thought and leaders in action. Out of these came the speakers. One by one, they stepped into the clear space between the pillars. Such a man was cool and weighty, such a man was impassioned and persuasive. Now the tense crowd listened, hardly breathing, now it broke into wild applause. The speakers dealt with an approaching tempest, and with a gesture they checked off the storm clouds. \"_Protection for the manufacturing North at the expense of the agricultural South_--an old storm centre! _Territorial Rights_--once a speck in the west, not so large as a man's hand, and now beneath it, the wrangling and darkened land! _The Bondage of the African Race_--a heavy cloud! Our English fathers raised it; our northern brethren dwelled with it; the currents of the air fixed it in the South. At no far day we will pass from under it. In the mean time we would not have it _burst_. In that case underneath it would lie ruined fields and wrecked homes, and out of its elements would come a fearful pestilence! _The Triumph of the Republican Party_--no slight darkening of the air is that, no drifting mist of the morning! It is the triumph of that party which proclaims the Constitution a covenant with death and an agreement with hell!--of that party which tolled the bells, and fired the minute guns, and draped its churches with black, and all-hailed as saint and martyr the instigator of a bloody and servile insurrection in a sister State, the felon and murderer, John Brown! The Radical, the Black Republican, faction, sectional rule, fanaticism, violation of the Constitution, aggression, tyranny, and wrong--all these are in the bosom of that cloud!--_The Sovereignty of the State._ Where is the tempest which threatens here? _Not_ here, Virginians! but in the pleasing assertion of the North, 'There is no sovereignty of the State!' 'A State is merely to the Union what a county is to a State.' O shades of John Randolph of Roanoke, of Patrick Henry, of Mason and Madison, of Washington and Jefferson! O shade of John Marshall even, whom we used to think too Federal! The Union! We thought of the Union as a golden thread--at the most we thought of it as a strong servant we had made between us, we thirteen artificers--a beautiful Talus to walk our coasts and cry 'All's well!' We thought so--by the gods, we think so yet! That _is_ our Union--the golden thread, the faithful servant; not the monster that Frankenstein made, not this Minotaur swallowing States! _The Sovereignty of the State!_ Virginia fought seven years for the sovereignty of Virginia, wrung it, eighty years ago, from Great Britain, and has not since resigned it! Being different in most things, possibly the North is different also in this. It may be that those States have renounced the liberty they fought for. Possibly Massachusetts--the years 1803, 1811, and 1844 to the contrary--does regard herself as a county. Possibly Connecticut--for all that there was a Hartford Convention!--sees herself in the same light. Possibly. 'Brutus saith 't is so, and Brutus is an honourable man!' But Virginia has not renounced! Eighty years ago she wrote a certain motto on her shield. To-day the letters burn bright! Unterrified then she entered this league from which we hoped so much. Unterrified to-morrow, should a slurring hand be laid upon that shield, will she leave it!\"  Allan Gold, from the schoolhouse on Thunder"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22066"],["title","The Long Roll (#2)"],["body","n, listened with a swelling heart, then, amid the applause which followed the last speaker, edged his way along the crowded old brick pavement to where, not far from the portico, he made out the broad shoulders, the waving dark hair, and the slouch hat of a young man with whom he was used to discuss these questions. Hairston Breckinridge glanced down at the pressure upon his arm, recognized the hand, and pursued, half aloud, the current of his thought. \"I don't believe I'll go back to the university. I don't believe any of us will go back to the university.--Hello, Allan!\"  \"I'm for the preservation of the Union,\" said Allan. \"I can't help it. We made it, and we've loved it.\"  \"I'm for it, too,\" answered the other, \"in reason. I'm not for it out of reason. In these affairs out of reason is out of honour. There's nothing sacred in the word _Union_ that men should bow down and worship it! It's the thing behind the word that counts--and whoever says that Massachusetts and Virginia, and Illinois and Texas are united just now is a fool or a liar!--Who's this Colonel Anderson is bringing forward? Ah, we'll have the Union now!\"  \"Who is it?\"  \"Albemarle man, staying at Lauderdale.--Major in the army, home on furlough.--Old-line Whig. I've been at his brother's place, near Charlottesville--\"  From the portico came a voice. \"I am sure that few in Botetourt need an introduction here. We, no more than others, are free from vanity, and we think we know a hero by intuition. Men of Botetourt, we have the honour to listen to Major Fauquier Cary, who carried the flag up Chapultepec!\"  Amid applause a man of perhaps forty years, spare, bronzed, and soldierly, entered the clear space between the pillars, threw out his arm with an authoritative gesture, and began to speak in an odd, dry, attractive voice. \"You are too good!\" he said clearly. \"I'm afraid you don't know Fauquier Cary very well, after all. He's no hero--worse luck! He's only a Virginian, trying to do the right as he sees it, out yonder on the plains with the Apaches and the Comanches and the sage brush and the desert--\"  There was an interruption. \"How about Chapultepec?\"--\"And the Rio Grande?\"--\"Didn't we hear something about a fight in Texas?\"  The speaker laughed. \"A fight in Texas? Folk, folk, if you knew how many fights there are in Texas--and how meritorious it is to keep out of them! No; I'm only a Virginian out there.\" He regarded the throng with his magnetic smile, his slight and fine air of gaiety in storm. \"As you know, I am by no means the only Virginian, and they are heroes, the others, if you like!--real, old-line heroes, brave as the warriors in Homer, and a long sight better men! I am happy to report to his kinsmen here that General Joseph E. Johnston is in health--still loving astronomy, still reading du Guesclin, still studying the Art of War. He's a soldier's soldier, and that, in its way, is as fine a thing as a poet's poet! I see men before me who are of the blood of the Lees. Out there by the Rio Grande is a Colonel Robert E. Lee, of whom Virginia may well be proud! There are few heights in those western deserts, but he carries his height with him. He's marked for greatness. And there are 'Beauty' Stuart, and Dabney Maury, the best of fellows, and Edward Dillon, and Walker and George Thomas, and many another good man and true. First and last, there's a deal of old Virginia following Mars, out yonder! We've got Hardee, too, from Georgia, and Van Dorn from Mississippi, and Albert Sidney Johnston from Kentucky--no better men in Homer, no better men! And there are others as soldierly--McClellan with whom I graduated at West Point, Fitz-John Porter, Hancock, Sedgwick, Sykes, and Averell. McClellan and Hancock are from Pennsylvania, Fitz-John Porter is from New Hampshire, Sedgwick from Connecticut, Sykes from Delaware, and Averell from New York. And away, away out yonder, in the midst of sage brush and Apaches, when any of us chance to meet around a camp-fire, there we sit, while coyotes are yelling off in the dark, there we sit and tell stories of home, of Virginia and Pennsylvania, of Georgia and New Hampshire!\"  He paused, drew himself up, looked out over the throng to the mountains, studied for a moment their long, clean line, then dropped his glance and spoke in a changed tone, with a fiery suddenness, a lunge as of a tried rapier, quick and startling.  \"Men of Botetourt! I speak for my fellow soldiers of the Army of the United States when I say that, out yonder, we are blithe to fight with marauding Comanches, with wolves and with grizzlies, but that we are not--oh, we are not--ready to fight with each other! Brother against brother--comrade against comrade--friend against friend--to quarrel in the same tongue and to slay the man with whom you've faced a thousand dangers--no, we are not ready for that!  \"Virginians! I will not believe that the permanent dissolution of this great Union is come! I will not believe that we stand to-day in danger of internecine war! Men of Botetourt, go slow--go slow! The Right of the State--I grant it! I was bred in that doctrine, as were you all. Albemarle no whit behind Botetourt in that! The Botetourt Resolutions--amen to much, to very much in the Botetourt Resolutions! South Carolina! Let South Carolina go in peace! It is her right! Remembering old comradeship, old battlefields, old defeats, old victories, we shall still be friends. If the Gulf States go, still it is their right, immemorial, incontrovertible!--The right of self-government. We are of one blood and the country is wide. God-speed both to Lot and to Abraham! On some sunny future day may their children draw together and take hands again! So much for the seceding States. But Virginia,--but Virginia made possible the Union,--let her stand fast in it in this day of storm! in this Convention let her voice be heard--as I know it will be heard--for wisdom, for moderation, for patience! So, or soon or late, she will mediate between the States, she will once again make the ring complete, she will be the saviour of this great historic Confederation which our fathers made!\"  A minute or two more and he ended his speech. As he moved from between the pillars, there was loud applause. The county was largely Whig, honestly longing--having put on record what it thought of the present mischief and the makers of it--for a peaceful solution of all troubles. As for the army, county and State were proud of the army, and proud of the Virginians within it. It was amid cheering that Fauquier Cary left the portico. At the head of the steps, however, there came a question. \"One moment, Major Cary! What if the North declines to evacuate Fort Sumter? What if she attempts to reinforce it? What if she declares for a _compulsory_ Union?\"  Cary paused a moment. \"She will not, she will not! There are politicians in the North whom I'll not defend! But the people--the people--the people are neither fools nor knaves! They were born North and we were born South and that is the chief difference between us! A _Compulsory_ Union! That is a contradiction in terms. Individuals and States, harmoniously minded, unite for the sweetness of Union and for the furtherance of common interests. When the minds are discordant, and the interests opposed, one may be bound to another by Conquest--not otherwise! What said Hamilton? _To coerce a State would be one of the maddest projects ever devised!_\" He descended the court house steps to the grassy, crowded yard. Here acquaintances claimed him, and here, at last, the surge of the crowd brought him within a yard of Allan Gold and his companion. The latter spoke. \"Major Cary, you don't remember me. I'm Hairston Breckinridge, sir, and I've been once or twice to Greenwood with Edward. I was there Christmas before last, when you came home wounded--\"  The older man put out a ready hand. \"Yes, yes, I do remember! We had a merry Christmas! I am glad to meet you again, Mr. Breckinridge. Is this your brother?\"  \"No, sir. It's Allan Gold, from Thunder Run.\"  \"I am pleased to meet you, sir,\" said Allan. \"You have been saying what I should like to have been able to say myself.\"  \"I am pleased that you are pleased. Are you, too, from the university?\"  \"No, sir. I couldn't go. I teach the school on Thunder Run.\"  \"Allan knows more,\" said Hairston Breckinridge, \"than many of us who are at the university. But we mustn't keep you, sir.\"  In effect they could do so no longer. Major Cary was swept away by acquaintances and connections. The day was declining, the final speaker drawing to an end, the throng beginning to shiver in the deepening cold. The speaker gave his final sentence; the town band crashed in determinedly with \"Home, Sweet Home.\" To its closing strains the county people, afoot, on horseback, in old, roomy, high-swung carriages, took this road and that. The townsfolk, still excited, still discussing, lingered awhile round the court house or on the verandah of the old hotel, but at last these groups dissolved also. The units betook themselves home to fireside and supper, and the sun set behind the Alleghenies.  Allan Gold, striding over the hills toward Thunder Run, caught up with the miller from Mill Creek, and the two walked side by side until their roads diverged. The miller was a slow man, but to-day there was a red in his cheek and a light in his eye. \"Just so,\" he said shortly. \"They must keep out of my mill race or they'll get caught in the wheel.\"  \"Mr. Green,\" said Allan, \"how much of all this trouble do you suppose is really about the negro? I was brought up to wish that Virginia had never held a slave.\"  \"So were most of us. You don't hold any.\"  \"No.\"  \"No more I don't. No more does Tom Watts. Nor Anderson West. Nor the Taylors. Nor five sixths of the farming folk about here. Nor seven eighths of the townspeople. We don't own a negro, and I don't know that we ever did own one. Not long ago I asked Colonel Anderson a lot of questions about the "]]]
