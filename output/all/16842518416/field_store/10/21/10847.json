And Josie isn't a female detective, as yet; she is only training to be one, because her father has won fame in that profession.\"  \"Josie O'Gorman,\" said the Colonel, meditatively, \"is a wonderfully clever girl. I believe she is better, even now, than a score of average male sleuths. Perhaps it will be a desirable thing for her to come here, for she will be shrewd enough to decide, in a short time, whether or not your suspicions are justified. In the latter case, you will be relieved of your worries. Will you abide by Josie's decision?\"  \"Will you, Gran'pa Jim?\"  \"I have considerable confidence in the girl's judgment.\"  \"Then I will write to her at once.\"  She went to her desk and wrote the following note:  Dear Josie: We are at the dropping-off-place of the world, a stagnant little village of a dozen houses set in an oasis that is surrounded by the desert of civilization. And here, where life scarcely throbs, I've scented a mystery that has powerfully impressed me and surely needs untangling. It will be good practice for you, Josie, and so I want you to pack up at once and come to us on a good long visit. We're delightfully situated and, even if the mystery dissolves into thin air under the sunshine of your eyes, I know you will enjoy the change and our dreamy, happy existence in the wilds of nowhere. Gran'pa Jim wants you, too, as he thinks your coming will do me good, and his judgment is never at fault. So drop me a postal to say when you will arrive and I will meet you at Chargrove Station with our car. Affectionately your friend, Mary Louise Burrows.  Gran'pa Jim read this note and approved it, so next morning Mary Louise walked to the village and deposited it in the postoffice, which located in the front room of Jim Bennett's little residence and was delightfully primitive. Jim was \"jus' makin' up the mail bag,\" he said, so her letter was in time to catch the daily train and would be in Washington, where Josie lived, in the quickest possible time.  Josie O'Gorman was about the same age as Mary Louise and she was the only child of John O'Gorman, famed as one of the cleverest detectives in the Secret Service. Josie was supposed to have inherited some of her father's talent; at least her fond parent imagined so. After carefully training the child almost from babyhood, O'Gorman had tested Josie's ability on just one occasion, when she had amply justified her father's faith in her. This test had thrown the girl into association with Mary Louise and with Colonel Hathaway, both of whom greatly admired her cleverness, her clear head and shrewd judgment. Mary Louise, especially, had developed a friendship for the embryo girl detective and had longed to know her more intimately. So she congratulated herself on the happy thought of inviting Josie to Cragg's Crossing and was delighted that the vague mystery surrounding the Cragg family offered an adequate excuse to urge the girl to come to her. There seemed nothing in the way of such a visit, for Officer O'Gorman, however pleased he might be at his daughter's success in her first detective case, declared Josie yet too young to enter active service and insisted that she acquire further age and experience before he would allow her to enter her chosen profession in earnest. \"One swallow,\" he said, \"doesn't make a summer, and the next bird you fly might prove a buzzard, my dear. Take your time, let your wits mature, and you'll be the better for it in the end.\"  So Mary Louise waited impatiently for Josie's reply, meantime seeing as much of Ingua as she could and trying to cement the growing friendship between them. Ingua responded eagerly to her advances and as old Mr. Cragg was away from home the greater part of the day there was much crossing of the stepping-stones by both girls and more than one \"afternoon tea\" in the pavilion.  \"Do you know,\" said Ingua one day, in confidential mood, \"I haven't had the devils since that time I started to run away and you stopped me? P'r'aps it's because I'm not as hungry as I used to be; but, anyhow, I'm glad I stayed. Gran'dad's been good, too, 'though he's got the 'wakes' ag'in.\"  \"What are the 'wakes'?\" asked Mary Louise.  \"Can't sleep nights. Goes t' bed on time, ye know, but gits up ag'in an' dresses himself an' walks.\"  \"In the house?\"  \"No, walks out o' doors. Sometimes he'll come in at jes' daylight; sometimes not till break-fas' is ready.\"  \"And doesn't that make him cross, Ingua?\"  \"Not a bit. It seems to chirk him up. Yist'day mornin', when he come in, he was feelin' so chipper he give me a cent, an' told me to buy somethin' useful. I guess that's the first cent he ever give me. I've _took_ money o' his'n, but he never _give_ me none afore.\"  \"Oh, Ingua! I hope you haven't stolen money?\"  \"Nope. Jes' took it. It ain't easy, 'cause he knows ev'ry cent he's got, an' it ain't often he leaves it where I kin git it. P'r'aps he knows it's me, but when I lie out of it he can't do noth'n' but growl-- an' growlin' don't hurt any.\"  Mary Louise was greatly distressed. This reckless disregard of property rights was of course the direct result of the child's environment, but must be corrected. Ingua resented direct chiding and it was necessary to point out to her the wickedness of stealing in the gentlest possible manner.  \"How much money have you taken from your grandfather?\" she asked.  \"Oh, not much. A nickel, now an' then. He wouldn't stan' for losin' any more, ye see. P'r'aps, altogether, I've swiped twenty-five cents. But once Ned Joselyn give me a dollar, an' Ol' Swallertail knowed it, an' made me give it to him to save for me. That were the last I ever saw o' that dollar, Mary Louise, so I ain't even with Gran'dad yet.\"  \"Do you think,\" remarked Mary Louise, \"there is ever any excuse for stealing?\"  The girl stared at her, coloring slightly.  \"Do ye mean Gran'dad, er _me?_\"  \"I mean you. He didn't steal your dollar, dear; he merely took it so you wouldn't spend it foolishly.\"  \"An' I merely took them nickels so's I could, spend 'em foolish. There's no fun in spendin' money, seems to me, unless you squander it reckless. That's what I done with them nickels. Candy an' chewin' gum tastes better when you know it's swiped.\"  Mary Louise sighed. It was so hard to show little Ingua the error of her ways.  \"As fer stealin'--out an' out _stealin',\"_ continued the girl, with a proud toss of her head, \"we Craggs ain't never took noth'n' that don't belong to us from nobody. What a Cragg takes from a Cragg is a Cragg's business, an' when we takes someth'n' from somebody else I'll ask ye to tell me 'bout it.\"  \"Where are you going, Ingua?\"  \"Home.\"  \"You're not offended, I hope.\"  \"No, but I got work to do. I ain't done my breakfas' dishes yet.\"  Mary Louise musingly watched the girl cross the river. On the opposite bank she turned to wave her hand and then ran into the cottage. Ingua's code of honor was a peculiar one. Her pride in the Craggs seemed unaccountable, considering she and her grandfather were the only two of the family in existence--except that wandering mother of hers.  But the recent conversation had uncovered a new phase of the mystery. Old Swallowtail was nervous over something; he could not sleep at night, but roamed the roads while others with clear consciences slumbered. There must be some powerful reason to account for the old man's deserting his bed in this manner. What could it be?  When she walked over to the postoffice the girl found the long-looked-for letter from Josie O'Gorman. It said:  Dear Mary Louise: How good you are! I positively need a change of scene and a rest, so I'm coming. To-morrow--by the train to Chargrove. The mystery you hint at will help me to rest. Dad doesn't want me to grow rusty and he has some odd theories I'd like to work out. I haven't an idea what your \"mystery\" is, of course, but if it enables me to test any one of the O'Gorman theories (a theory is merely a stepping-stone to positive information) I shall bless you forever. And that reminds me: I'm coming as a sewing girl, to help you fix over some summer gowns. You're anxious to give me the work, because I need it, but as we're rather chummy I'm half servant and half companion. (I hate sewing and make the longest stitches you ever saw!) Moreover, I'm Josie Jessup. I'm never an O'Gorman while I'm working on a mystery; it wouldn't do at all. Explain this to dear old Gran'pa Jim.  Between the receipt of this script and to-morrow's train jot down in regular order everything you know concerning the aforesaid mystery. Make it brief; no speculations or suspicions, just facts. Then I won't waste any time getting busy.  Can you hear the rumble of my train? While you're reading this I'm on my way!  Josie  \"Good!\" murmured Mary Louise, as she folded the letter. \"I feel better already. Whatever the mystery of Old Swallowtail may be, Josie is sure to solve it.\"    CHAPTER VIII THE RED-HEADED GIRL  Sol Jerrems the storekeeper, coming in from the back room where he had been drawing molasses for Farmer Higgins, found perched on top the sugar-barrel a chunky, red-haired, freckle-faced young girl whom he had never seen before. She seemed perfectly at home in his store and sat with her knees drawn up to her chin and her arms encircling her legs, eyeing soberly the two or three farmers who had come to the Crossing to \"trade.\"  \"If the head o' thet bar'l busts in, you'll be a fine mess,\" remarked Sol.  The girl nodded but did not move from her position. Sol waited on his customers, at times eyeing the strange girl curiously. When the farmers had gone with their purchases he approached the barrel and examined his visitor with speculative care.  \"Want anything?\"  \"Spool o' red cotton, number thirty.\"  \"Ain't got no red.\"  \"Green'll do.\"  \"Ain't got green. Only black an' white.\"  \"All right.\"  \"Want"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22225"],["title","Mary Louise in the Country (#8)"],["body"," black or white?\"  \"No.\"  Sol leaned against the counter. He wasn't busy; the girl seemed in no hurry; it was a good time to gossip and find out all about the strange creature perched on his sugar-barrel.  \"Where'd ye come from?\" he inquired.  \"City,\" tossing her head toward the north.  \"What for?\"  \"To do sewing for the Hathaways folks. Mary Louise, you know.\"  Sol pricked up his ears. The Hathaways were newcomers, about whom little was known. He wanted to know more, and here was a girl who could give him inside information.  \"Knowed the Hathaways in the city?\"  \"Kind o'. Sewed on Mary Louise's spring dresses. How long you been here?\"  \"Me? Why, I come here more'n twenty years ago. What does the Colonel do in the city?\"  \"Never asked him. Why do they call this place Cragg's Crossing?\"  \"I didn't name it. S'pose 'cause ol' Cragg used to own all the land, an' the roads crossed in the middle o' his farm.\"  \"What Cragg was that?\"  \"Eh? Why, father to Ol' Swallertail. Ever seen Ol' Swallertail?\"  \"No.\"  \"Wal, he's a sight fer sore eyes. First time anybody sees him they either laughs er chokes. The movin'-pictur' folks would go crazy over him. Ever seen a movin'-pictur'?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I did, too, when I was in the city las' year. Ol' Swallertail 'minds me of 'em. Goes 'round dressed up like George Washington when he crossed the Delaware.\"  \"Crazy?\"  \"That way, yes; other ways, not a bit. Pretty foxy gent, is Ol' Swallertail.\"  \"Why?\"  Sol hesitated, reflecting. These questions were natural, in a stranger, but to explain old Hezekiah Cragg's character was not a particularly easy task.  \"In the fust place, he drives a hard bargain. Don't spend money, but allus has it. Keeps busy, but keeps his business to himself.\"  \"What is his business?\"  \"Didn't I say he kep' it to himself?\"  \"But he owns all the land around here.\"  \"Not now. He owns jest a half-acre, so far's anybody knows, with a little ol' hut on it thet a respect'ble pig wouldn't live in. It's jes' acrost the river from the place where you're workin'.\"  \"Then what has become of his land?\"  \"It's stayed jes' where it allus was, I guess,\" with a chuckle at his own wit, \"but Ol' Swaller-tail sold it, long ago. Ol' Nick Cragg, his father afore him, sold a lot of it, they say, and when he died he left half his ready money an' all his land to Hezekiah--thet's Ol' Swallertail--an' the other half o' his money to his second son, Peter.\"  \"Where is Peter?\" asked the girl quickly.  \"Went back to Ireland, years ago, and never's be'n heard of since. The Craggs was Irish afore they got to be Americans, but it seems Pete hankered fer th' Ol' Sod an' quit this country cold.\"  \"So the Craggs are Irish, eh?\" mused the girl in a casual tone. And then she yawned, as if not greatly interested. But Sol was interested, so long as he was encouraged to talk.  \"I be'n told, by some o' the ol' settlers,\" he went on, \"thet ol' Nick Cragg were born in Ireland, was a policeman in New York--where he made his first money--an' then come here an' bought land an' settled down. They ain't much difference 'tween a policeman an' a farmer, I guess. If the story's true, it proves Ol' Swallertail has Irish blood in him yit, though fer that matter he's lived here long enough to be jes' American, like the rest of us. After he come inter the property he gradual-like sold off all the land, piece by piece, till he ain't got noth'n left but thet half-acre. Sold most of it afore I come here, an' I be'n at the Crossing more'n twenty year.\"  \"If the land brought a fair price, Old Swallowtail ought to be rich,\" remarked the girl.  \"Then he ain't what he orter be. Folks says he specilated, years ago, an' got stung. I know him pretty well--as well as anybody knows him-- an' my opinion is he ain't got more'n enough to bury him decent.\"  \"Thought you said he drives a hard bargain?\"  \"Young woman,\" said Sol earnestly, \"the man don't live as kin make money specilatin'. The game's ag'in him, fust an' last, an' the more brains he's got the harder he'll git stung.\"  \"But I thought you said Mr. Cragg has a business.\"  \"An' I said nobody knows what it is. When Ned Joselyn used to come here the two was thick, an' Ned were a specilater through an' through. Some thinks it was him as got Cragg's wad, an' some says he lost it all, an' his wife's money, too. Anyhow, Joselyn lit out fer good an' when he were gone Ann Kenton cried like a baby an' ol' Swallertail 's been dumb as a clam ever since.\"  \"What makes you think Cragg has a business?\" persisted the girl.  \"He keeps an office, over the store here, an' he has a sign on the door thet says 'Real Estate.' But he ain't got no real estate, so that ain't why he shuts himself in the office day after day--an' even Sundays. He's got some other business. Ev'ry night, afore he goes home, he takes a bunch o' letters to Mrs. Bennett's postoffice, an' ev'ry mornin' he goes there an' gits another bunch o' letters that's come to him in the mail. If that don't mean some sort o' business, I don't know what'n thunder it _does_ mean.\"  \"Nor I,\" said the girl, yawning again. \"What about Ned Joselyn? Was he nice?\"  \"Dressed like a dandy, looked like a fool, acted like the Emp'ror o' Rooshy an' pleased ev'rybody by runnin' away. That is, ev'rybody but his wife an' Ol' Swallertail.\"  \"I see. Who else lives over your store?\"  \"I live there myself; me an' my fambly, in the back part. One o' the front rooms I rents to Ol' Swallertail, an' he pays the rent reg'lar. The other front room Miss Huckins, the dressmaker, lives in.\"  \"Oh. I'm a dressmaker, too. Guess I'll go up and see her. Is she in?\"  \"When she's out, she leaves the key with me, an' the key ain't here. Say, girl, what's yer name?\"  \"Josie.\"  \"Josie what?\"  \"Jessup. Pa was a drayman. Ever hear of him?\"  \"No. But about the Hathaways; what has--\"  \"And you've got no red thread? Or green?\"  \"Only black an' white. Does the Colonel--\"  \"Can't use black or white,\" said the girl, deliberately getting off the barrel. \"Guess I'll go up and ask Miss Huckins if she has any red.\"  Out she walked, and old Sol rubbed his wrinkled forehead with a bewildered look and muttered:  \"Drat the gal! She's pumped me dry an' didn't tell me a word about them Hathaway folks. She worse'n ol' Eben, the nigger help. Seems like nobody wants t' talk about the Hathaways, an' that means there's somethin' queer about 'em. But this red-headed sewin'-girl is a perfec' innercent an' I'll git her talkin' yet, if she stays here long.\"  Meantime Josie mounted the stairs, which were boarded in at one end of the building, being built on the outside to economize space, and entered the narrow upper hallway. A chatter of children's voices in the rear proclaimed that portion to be the quarters of the Jerrems family. Toward the front was a door on which, in dim letters, was the legend: \"H. Cragg. Real Estate.\"  Here the girl paused to listen. No sound came from the interior of H. Cragg's apartment. Farther along she found a similar door on which was a card reading: \"Miss Huckins, Dressmaker and Milliner.\" Listening again, she heard the sound of a flatiron thumping an ironing board.  She knocked, and the door was opened by a little middle-aged woman who held a hot flatiron in one hand. She was thin; she was bright-eyed; her hair was elaborately dressed with little ringlets across the forehead and around the ears, so Josie at once decided it was a wig.  Seeing a stranger before her, Miss Huckins looked her over carefully from head to foot, while Josie smiled a vacuous, inconsequent smile and said in a perfunctory way:  \"Good morning.\"  \"Come in,\" returned Miss Huckins, with affable civility. \"I don't think I know you.\"  \"I'm Josie Jessup, from the city. I'm in your line, Miss Huckins--in a way, that is. I've come here to do some sewing for Mary Louise Burrows, who is the granddaughter of Colonel Hathaway, who has rented the Kenton Place. Nice weather, isn't it?\"  Miss Huckins was not enthusiastic. Her face fell. She had encouraged sundry hopes that the rich little girl would employ her to do whatever sewing she might need. So she resumed the pressing of a new dress that was spread over her ironing-board and said rather shortly:  \"Anything I can do for you?\"  \"I want to use some red thread and the storekeeper doesn't keep it in stock. Queer old man, that storekeeper, isn't he?\"  \"I don't call him queer. He's honest as the day is long and makes a good landlord. Country stores don't usually keep red thread, for it is seldom used.\"  \"He has been talking to me about old Mr. Cragg, who has an office next door to you. I'm sure you'll admit that Mr. Cragg is queer, if the storekeeper isn't.\"  \"A man like Mr. Cragg has the right to be queer,\" snapped the dressmaker, who did not relish this criticism of the natives by a perfect stranger. \"He is very quiet and respectable and makes a very satisfactory neighbor.\"  Josie, seated in a straight, wood-bottomed chair, seemed not at all chagrined by her reception. She watched the pressing for a time silently.  \"That's a mighty pretty gown,\" she presently remarked, in a tone of admiration. \"I don't suppose I shall ever be able to make anything as nice as that. I--I'm not good at planning, you know,\" with modest self-deprecation. \"I only do plain sewing and mending.\"  The stern features of Miss Huckins relaxed a bit. She glanced at the girl, then at her work, and said more pleasantly than she had before spoken:  \"This dress is for Mary Donovan, who lives two miles north of here. She's to be married next Saturday--if they get the haying over with by that time--and this is part of her trousseau. I've made her two other dresses and trimmed two hats for her--a straw shape and a felt Gainsboro. The Donovans are pretty well-to-do.\"  Josie nodded with appreciation.  \"It's nice she can get such elegant things so near home, isn't it? Why, she couldn't do as well in the city--not _half_ as well!\"  Miss Huckins held up the gown and gazed at it with unmistakable pride. \"I"]]]
