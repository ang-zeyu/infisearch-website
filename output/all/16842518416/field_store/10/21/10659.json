Bring a bit of bailing wire,   A pocketful of nails,   And half a dozen wiener-wursts   For every man that sails.    Tell Terry Tagg, when you go by,   Be sure to bring his dog.   All aboard for Bombay   On a floating cedar log!    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    WATER     There's water in the rain barrel,   And water in the well,   There's lots of water in the pond   Where Hannah Hawkins fell.    There's water in the ocean,   And water in the skies,   And when a fellow blubbers   He gets water in his eyes.    But in the Barca desert   Where the hippodoodles play,   The water in the rivers   Just dries up and blows away.       OLD MOLLY IS LOWING     Old Molly is lowing and lowing   'Way down in the old meadow lot.   I've given her water and clover,   And all of the apples I've got;   But she won't eat a thing that I give her,   And never drinks even a sup,   For they've taken her baby to market   And some one has eaten it up.   I'd just like to go to the city   And cut them all up into halves   And feed them to sharks and to lions--   Those people that eat little calves.    [Illustration]       SNOWFLAKES     The snowflakes are falling by ones and by twos;   There's snow on my jacket, and snow on my shoes;   There's snow on the bushes, and snow on the trees--   It's snowing on everything now, if you please.    [Illustration: THE SNOWFLAKES ARE FALLING BY ONES AND BY TWOS]       DIPPY-DIPPY-DAVY     Dippy-Dippy-Davy,   Half the Royal Navy   In the dampness and the dark   Was driving off a savage shark   To Dippy-Dippy-Davy.       [Illustration]    WHEN I'M AS RICH   AS UNCLE CLAUS     When I'm as rich as Uncle Claus,   With whiskers on my chin,   I'm going to have a great big house   To put my people in.    I'll never let them wander out   Or ride with me to town;   They'll come a-running when I shout   And tremble when I frown.    I'll have some men in soldier tents,   A pirate and his mate,   And wildcats all around the fence,   And mad dogs on the gate.       RINKY-TATTLE     Rinky-tattle, rinky-tattle,   Rinky-tattle--who?   Little Tommy Taylor   Is a rinky-tattle too.    [Illustration]       TWENTY LITTLE SNOWFLAKES     Twenty little snowflakes climbing up a wire.   \"Now, listen,\" said their mother, \"don't you climb up any higher.   The sun will surely catch you, and scorch you with his fire.\"   But the naughty little snowflakes didn't mind a word she said,   Each tried to clamber faster than his fellow just ahead;   They thought that they'd be back in time enough to go to bed.   But they found out that their mother wasn't quite the dunce they         thought her,   The sun bobbed up--remember this, my little son and daughter--   And turned those twenty snowflakes into twenty drops of water.       [Illustration]    SLIPPERY SLIM     Slippery Slim, a garter snake,   Leaned against a garden rake   And smiled a sentimental smile   At Tilly Toad, on the gravel pile,   Till that bashful miss was forced to hop   And hide her face in a carrot-top.       [Illustration: THROUGH FOG AND RAIN I RUN MY TRAIN]    THE FREIGHTER     Through fog and rain   I run my train   Wherever the track is laid,   And over the road   I carry a load   Whenever the freight is paid.    A kaddy of tea   For Genessee,   For Troy an empty crate,   A man in brown   For Uniontown   To help them celebrate.       NO ONE AT HOME     No one at home in the hen-house,   And no one at home in the barn,   Old Brindle has gone to the neighbor's   To borrow a skein of brown yarn,   To borrow yarn for the darning   Of socks for her wee spotted calf--    The little rollicking rascal   Has never enough by half.   And Speckle is down by the willow   Washing her chicks in the lake,   While old Daddy Cockle is lying   Abed with a bad toothache.       PATTERS AND TATTERS     Patters had a gallant band,   An army made of clay.   But Tatters took the garden hose   And washed them all away.    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    CROWN THE KING WITH CARROT TOPS     Crown the king with carrot tops,   Dress him in sateen,   Give him lots of licorice drops,   With suckers in between.    For he's a king with lots of power   And awful, awful fierce,   He kills a pirate every hour   And washes in his tears.    He rides a charger ten feet high,   A dashing, dappled gray;   Has ginger pop and lemon pie   For breakfast every day.    So get a royal canopy,   The finest ever seen,   And whiskers for his majesty,   And tresses for the queen.       THE CANADA GOOSE     A Canada goose   On the South Palouse   Is singing her summer song.   Her words are wise,   And she greets the skies   With a voice like a steamer gong:   \"If you harbor your wealth   And keep your health,   You'll always be rich and strong.\"       [Illustration]    HIPPERTY, CLICKERTY, CLACKERTY, BANG     Hipperty, clickerty, clackerty, bang,   Get in a corner as fast as you can!   The sideboard is tipsy, the table is mad,   The chairs have lost all the sense that they had.   So hipperty, clickerty, clackerty, bang,   Get in a corner as fast as you can!       [Illustration]    SONNY     A sailor gave his sonny   Nearly half a pint of money   And sent him out to buy a ton of coal;   But he met a poor old miser   Who told him it were wiser   To bury all his money in a hole.    A sailor gave his sonny   Nearly half a pint of money   And told him he should buy a suit of clothes;   But he saw a pretty maiden   With all kinds of posies laden,   And he gave her all his money for a rose.    Then the sailor gave his sonny   Nearly half a pint of money   To buy a little garden and a house;   But he found him the next day,   In a shop on Yesler Way,   A-buying cheese and crackers for a mouse.    [Illustration: HE GAVE HER ALL HIS MONEY FOR A ROSE]       THE STOVE     A stove is a thing that gets awfully hot,   And fries up your meat, or whatever you've got.   It's made out of iron and hinges and screws,   And filled up with shakers, and dampers, and flues.   It's not very long and it's not very wide;   It's got black'ning on top and ashes inside.       [Illustration]    THE THUNDER BABY     Have you heard of the Thunder Baby   Way up in the big blue sky?   You've seen his cradle, maybe,   And maybe you've heard him cry.    Most of the time he's sleeping,   Rolled up in a big white cloud,   But when he's awake and hungry   He bellows awfully loud.    And when he's crying, sometimes   You can hear his teardrops fall   With a patter, patter, patter,   Against the garden wall.    But when he's madder'n mischief,   He rolls, and growls, and spits,   And kicks the clouds all forty ways,   And gives the weather fits.    Then tears come down in bucketfuls,   And children dance for joy,   Till the sun comes out and soundly spanks   Her Thunder Baby Boy.    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    HINKY, PINKY, PEARLY EARL     Hinky, pinky, pearly earl,   Twenty nobles and a churl;   Some are fat and some are lean,   One in red and one in green--   Prior, priest, and pearly earl,   Twenty nobles and a churl.       [Illustration]    TIPSY TOM     Tipsy Tom, the naughty fellow,   Dressed his wife in pink and yellow,   Set her in an apple tree,   And said: \"Now catch a bumblebee.\"       JOLLY JINKS     Jolly Jinks, the sailor man,   Went to sea in an oyster can.   But he found the water wet,   Fishes got into his net,   So he pulled his boat to shore   And vowed he'd sail the seas no more.       TRANSFORMATION     Auntie Ellen found her poodle--   Mercy! Goodness sake!--   Playing with the mully-wumps   Down along the lake.    And when she called him tenderly   He didn't want to come;   It took her over half an hour   To get the rascal home.    She washed him well with shaving-soap,   Pumice stone and lye,   She showered him and she scoured him   And she hung him up to dry.    And now he sits there quite serene,   The sweetest poodle ever seen.    [Illustration: TRANSFORMATION]       [Illustration]    THE THIEF CHASE     Bricks and bones!   Sticks and stones!   I chased a thief through twenty zones.    I found his hat   On Ararat,   And hurried on as quick as scat.    In a day or two   I found his shoe   Where he had sailed for Timbuktu.    I met the goat   That ate his coat   Upon the road to Terre Haute.    At last all worn   And quite forlorn   I chased him up the Matterhorn.       SOMEBODY     Somebody give me a peanut,   Somebody give me a pear;   I want to go down to the circus   And feed all the animals there.    [Illustration]       CONSOLATION     A dime and a dollar   Took me by the collar   And whispered this word in my ear:    \"We must leave you to-morrow,   But prithee don't sorrow,   We'll come back to see you next year.\"       THE ROBIN AND THE SQUIRREL     Said the Robin to the Squirrel,   \"How d' you do?\"   Said the Squirrel to the Robin,   \"How are you?\"   \"Oh, I've got some cherry pies,   And a half a dozen flies,   And a kettle full of beetles on to stew.\"    [Illustration]    Said the Squirrel to the Robin,   \"How d' you do?\"   Said the Robin to the Squirrel,   \"How are you?\"   \"I've a nest that's nice and neat,   And a wife that can't be beat,   And I'm every bit as happy now as you.\"       THE KING HAD A PLATTER     The King had a platter   Of brisket and batter,   The Prince had a Bellington bun,   The Queen had a rose   To put to her nose   As soon as the dinner was done.       [Illustration]    RAIN     The lightning split the sky in two   And set the clouds to leaking   Just as dear old Pastor Brown   Began his Sunday speaking.    He told about the awful rain   That fell in Noah's day,   And one by one the happy smiles   Began to fade away.    In half an hour the people all   Put on their rubber coats,   And when he finished everyone   Was out and building boats.       OLD FATHER McNETHER     Old Father McNether   He sorts out the weather   And takes what he pleases, I'm told,   With a big turkey-feather   He"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22014"],["title","The Peter Patter Book of Nursery Rhymes (#4)"],["body","the weather,   And makes it blow hot and blow cold.    [Illustration: OLD FATHER McNETHER]       JERRY WAS A JOKER     Jerry was a joker.   He carried off the poker   And dressed it up from head to heel   In clover-tops and orange-peel   And fed it bones and barley meal.   Poor old Rusty Poker!       [Illustration]    KING KOKEM     King Kokem lay snoozing upon his brass bed--   Oh, play an old tune on your fiddle!   With shoes on his feet, and a crown on his head--   Oh, tune up your rusty old fiddle!    He dreamed of a land where the lions were tame,   Where they fried their lamb-chops on a griddle,   Where they called all the parrots and monkeys by name--   Oh, play us a tune on your fiddle!    He dreamed of a sea filled with raspberry pop,   With a cocoanut isle in the middle,   Where the stones and the boulders had icing on top--   Go strike up a tune on your fiddle!    He dreamed of a sky where the moonbeams all danced   While a comet was telling a riddle,   Where the stars and the planets and sun-dogs all pranced   While the moon played his fiddle de diddle.    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    OLD MISSUS SKINNER     Old Missus Skinner   Had dumplings for dinner   And sat on a very high stool;   When she cut thru the hide   There was nothing inside,   Which I'm sure was not often the rule.       [Illustration: OH MOTHER, OH MOTHER, COME QUICKLY AND SEE]    OH, MOTHER     Oh, Mother, Oh, Mother,   Come quickly and see,   The house and the farmyard   Have gone on a spree.    The pig's in the pantry,   The chickens are out,   The parrot is perched   On the tea kettle spout.    And mercy, Oh, mercy,   Oh, what shall I do?   A rat has run off   With my very best shoe.       CELLA REE AND TOMMY TO     Two funny friends that you all know   Are Cella Ree and Tommy To.   About as queer as friends can be,   Are Tommy To and Cella Ree.   For hours they sit there grim and stable   Side by side upon the table.   Tom is red and Cella pale,   His blushes are of no avail;   She sits, in spite of his endeavor,   As firm and undisturbed as ever,   A funny pair, you must agree,   This Tommy To and Cella Ree.    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    IF I WERE RICHER     If I were richer   I'd buy a pitcher   With scenery on it.   'Jolica ware--   Storks here and there,   And a funny affair   With ladies on it.    In half a minute   I'd mix up in it   A wonderful drink--   Peppermint, ice,   Lemons and spice--   Taste pretty nice,   What do you think?       THE ARMY OF THE QUEEN     O the Army of the Queen,   The Army of the Queen,   Some are dressed in turkey-red   And some are dressed in green;   A colonel and a captain,   A corporal in between,   Their guns are filled with powder   And their swords are bright and keen;   So toot your little trumpet   For the Army of the Queen.    [Illustration: TOOT YOUR LITTLE TRUMPET FOR THE ARMY OF THE QUEEN]       ROMULUS     Romulus, Romulus,   Father of Rome,   Ran off with a wolf   And he wouldn't come home.    When he grew up   He founded a city   With an eagle, a bear,   And a tortoise-shell kitty.       [Illustration]    THE HERO     My dad was a soldier and fought in the wars,   My grandfather fought on the sea,   And the tales of their daring and valor of course   Put the sand and the ginger in me.    I'm not scared of tigers or any wild beast,   I could fight with a lion all right,   I wouldn't be 'fraid of a bear in the least--   Excepting, perhaps, in the night.    But sister, she's skeery as skeery can be,   She's even afraid of the bark of a tree.       PENSIVE PERCY     Percy when a little boy   Was quiet as a mouse,   He never set the barn afire   Nor battered down the house.    He used to sit for hours and hours   Just gazing at the moon,   And feeding little fishes   Sarsaparilla from a spoon.    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    MOON, O MOON IN THE EMPTY SKY     Moon, O Moon in the empty sky,   Why do you swing so low?   Pretty moon with the silver ring   And the long bright beams where the fairies cling,   Where do you always go?    I go to the land of the Siamese,   Ceylon and the Great Plateau,   Over the seas where Sinbad sailed,   Where Moses crossed and Pharaoh failed,--   There's where I always go.       [Illustration: RAG-MAN, RAG-MAN, TAGGY, TAGGY, RAG-MAN]    THE RAG-MAN     \"Rag-man, rag-man,   Taggy, taggy, rag-man,   Tell us what you've got there in your sack.\"    \"Oh--it's full of rimes and riddles,   Jingles, jokes, and hi-de-diddles--   This bundle that I carry on my back.\"    \"O tell us, funny rag-man,   Grinny, skinny rag-man,   Where did you pick up your funny rimes?\"    \"Some were dancing with corn-flowers,   Some were hiding in church-towers,   And sprinkled helter-skelter by the chimes.\"    \"Rag-man, rag-man,   Nice old taggy rag-man,   Sing us just one jingle, tingle song.\"    \"Why, my dears, I've got a plenty,   Sing you one? I'll sing you twenty--   I've been hoping you would ask me all along.\"       WHENEVER I GO OUT TO WALK     Whenever I go out to walk,   All the geese begin to gawk;   And when I start to wander back,   All the ducks begin to quack.    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    A FREE SHOW     Mister McCune   Can whistle a tune,    Old Uncle Strong   Can sing us a song,    Benjamin Biddle   Can play on the fiddle,    Captain O'Trigg   Can dance us a jig,    And I, if I'm able,   Will tell you a fable.       BILLY BUMPKINS     Heigho, Billy Bumpkins,   How d' you grow your pumpkins?   \"At six o'clock I sows 'em,   At ten o'clock I hoes 'em,   An' jes before I goes to bed   I puts 'em in the pumpkin shed.\"    Tell us, Billy Bumpkins,   How d' you sell your pumpkins?   \"I lends 'em to the ladies,   I gives 'em to the babies,   An' trades a hundred for a kiss   To any pretty little miss.\"    [Illustration]       BLUE FLAMES AND RED FLAMES     Blue flames and red flames   In a world all dark;   Blue flames and red flames,   And a tiny spark   Hurrying to heaven, lest it should be late;   Lest the cautious seraphim close the shining gate,   And leave the little wanderer forevermore to fly   Like an orphan angel through the endless sky.       TIMOTHY GRADY     Poor little Timothy Grady   Screwed up his face at a lady,   And, jiminy jack!   It wouldn't come back.   The louder he hollered   The tighter it grew,   His eyes are all red   And his lips are all blue.   Oh, mercy me, what in the world will he do?   Poor little Timothy Grady!       CAPTAIN TICKLE AND HIS NICKEL     Captain Tickle had a nickel   In a paper sack,   He threw it in the river   And he couldn't get it back.   Captain Tickle spent his nickel   For a rubber ball,   And when he cut it open   There was nothing there at all.    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    GRANDMOTHER GRUNDY     O Grandmother Grundy,   Now what would you say   If the katydids carried   Your glasses away--    Carried them off   To the top of the sky   And used them to watch   The eclipses go by?       NEEDLES AND PINS     Needles and pins, hooks and eyes!   I saw a doughnut in the skies.   Flipperjinks the circus clown   Climbed a tree and got it down.    [Illustration: NEEDLES AND PINS, HOOKS AND EYES!]       A TOE RIME     Tassle is a captain,   Tinsel is a mayor,   Tony is a baker-boy   With 'lasses in his hair,   Tipsy is a sailor,   With anchors on his chest,   And Tiny is the baby boy   Who bosses all the rest.       HARRY HOOKER     Harry Hooker had a book   And couldn't find a teacher.   But still he managed very well,   He climbed a box and rang a bell   And turned into a preacher.       [Illustration]    JELLY JAKE AND BUTTER BILL     [Illustration]    Jelly Jake and Butter Bill   One dark night when all was still   Pattered down the long, dark stair,   And no one saw the guilty pair;   Pushed aside the pantry-door   And there found everything galore,--   Honey, raisins, orange-peel,   Cold chicken aplenty for a meal,   Gingerbread enough to fill   Two such boys as Jake and Bill.   Well, they ate and ate and ate,   Gobbled at an awful rate   Till I'm sure they soon weighed more   Than double what they did before.   And then, it's awful, still it's true,   The floor gave way and they went thru.   Filled so full they couldn't fight.   Slowly they sank out of sight.   Father, Mother, Cousin Ann,   Cook and nurse and furnace man   Fished in forty-dozen ways   After them, for twenty days;   But not a soul has chanced to get   A glimpse or glimmer of them yet.   And I'm afraid we never will--   Poor Jelly Jake and Butter Bill.    [Illustration]       CUT UP A CAPER     Cut up a caper,   You've got a paper   And I've got a widget of string.   You be the army   And let nothing harm me   For I am the captain and king.    [Illustration]       [Illustration: WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A TREAT]    EAT, EAT, EAT     Here come the sweet potatoes   And here's the Sunday meat,   I guess we must be ready now   To eat, eat, eat.    I'm going to have the nicey plate   And Daddy's leather seat,   And wear my patent-leather shoes   To eat, eat, eat.    My Daddy's talking all about   The war, and some old fleet,   I wonder if he never, never,   Never wants to eat.    We're going to have some apple-cake,   We're going to have a treat.   O hurry, hurry, Daddy,   Let us eat, eat, eat.       [Illustration]    HETTY HUTTON     Hetty Hutton,   Here's a button,   Sew it on your dress.    Willie Waller,   Here's a dollar,   Maybe more or less.    Mister Shuster,   Here's a rooster,   Put him in a pen.    Mister Saxon,   Get an ax an'   Let him out again.       [Illustration]    A BIG, FAT POTATO     A big, fat potato lay down on a clod   In the shade of some burdock and tall goldenrod,   And he dreamed he were king of the whole garden plot,   With a palace and throne, and a crown with a lot   Of jewels and diamonds and gold till it shone   Like the front of a show when the lights are turned on.   He had to be minded by all of the plants;   When he whistled the radishes knew they must dance;   When he"]]]
