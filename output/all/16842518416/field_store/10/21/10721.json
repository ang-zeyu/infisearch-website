[Music]  From every stormy wind that blows, From every swelling tide of woes, There is a calm, a sure retreat-- Our refuge is the Mercy-seat.  There is a place where Jesus sheds The oil of gladness on our heads, A place than all beside more sweet-- We seek the blood-bought Mercy-seat.  There is a spot where spirits blend, Where friend holds fellowship with friend; Though sundered far, by faith we meet, Around one common Mercy-Seat.  Ah! whither could we flee for aid, When hunted, scourged, oppressed, dismayed,-- Or how our bloody foes defeat, Had suffering slaves no Mercy-Seat!  Oh! let these hands forget their skill, These tongues be silent, cold, and still, These throbbing hearts forget to beat, If we forget the Mercy-Seat.     Friend of the Friendless.   God of my life! to thee I call, Afflicted at thy feet I fall; When the great water-floods prevail, Leave not my trembling heart to fail.  Friend of the friendless and the faint! Where should I lodge my deep complaint? Where but with thee, whose open door Invites the helpless and the poor?  Did ever mourner plead with thee, And thou refuse that mourner's plea? Does not thy word still fixed remain, That none shall seek thy face in vain?  Poor though I am, despised, forgot, Yet God, my God forgets me not; And he is safe, he must succeed, For whom the Lord vouchsafes to plead.     WAKE YE NUMBERS!  Words by Lewis. Air, \"Strike the Cymbals.\"   [Music]  Wake ye numbers! from your slumbers   Hear the song of freedom pour! By its shaking, fiercely breaking,   Every chain upon our shore. Flags are waving, all tyrants braving,   Proudly, freely, o'er our plains; Let no minions check our pinions,   While a single grief remains. Proud oblations, thou Queen of nations!   Have been poured upon they waters;   Afric's bleeding sons and daughters, Now before us, loud implore us,   Looking to Jehovah's throne, Chains are wearing, hearts despairing,   Will ye hear a nation's moan? Soothe their sorrow, ere the morrow   Change their aching hearts to stone: Then the light of nature's smile Freedom's realm shall bless the while; And the pleasure mercy brings Flow from all her latent springs; Delight shall spread, shall spread her shining wings,     Rejoicing, Rejoicing, Rejoicing.  Daily, nightly, burning brightly,   Glory's pillar fills the air; Hearts are waking, chains are breaking,   Freedom bids her sons prepare: O'er the ocean, in proud devotion,   Incense rises to the skies; From our mountains, o'er our fountains,   See, our Eagle proudly flies! What deploring impedes his soaring?   Millions still in bondage sighing!   Long in deep oppression lying! Shall their story mar our glory?   Must their life in sorrow flow? Tears are falling! fetters galling!   Listen to the cry of woe! Still oppressing! never blessing!   Shall their grief no ending know? Yes! our nation yet shall feel; Time shall break the chain of steel; Then the slave shall nobly stand; Peace shall smile with lustre bland; Glory shall crown our happy land--     Forever.     COMFORT FOR THE BONDMAN.  Air--\"Indian Philosopher.\"   [Music]  Come on, my partners in distress, My comrades in this wilderness,   Who groan beneath your chains; A while forget your griefs and fears, And look beyond this vale of tears,   To yon celestial plains.  Beyond the bounds of time and space, Look forward to that heavenly place,   Which mortals never trod; On faith's strong eagle pinions rise, Work out your passage to the skies,   And scale the mount of God.  If, like our Lord, we suffer here, We shall before his face appear,   And at his side sit down; To patient faith the prize is sure, For all who to the end endure   Shall wear a glorious crown.  Thrice blessed, exalted, blissful hope! It lifts our fainting spirits up,   It brings to life the dead; Our bondage here will soon be past, Then we shall rise and reign at last,   Triumphant with our Head.     Come and see the Works of God.   Lift up to God the shout of joy, Let all the earth its powers employ,   To sound his glorious praise; Say, unto God--\"How great art thou! Thy foes before thy presence bow!   How gracious are thy ways!  \"To thee all lands their homage bring, They raise the song, they shout, they sing   The honors of thy name.\" Come! see the wondrous works of God; How dreadful is his vengeful rod!   How wide extends his fame!  He made a highway through the sea, His people, long-enslaved, to free,   And give them Canaan's land; Through endless years his reign extends, His piercing eye to earth he bends--   Ye despots! fear his hand.  O! bless our God, lift up your voice Ye people! sing aloud--rejoice--   His mighty praise declare; The Lord hath made our bondage cease, Broke off our chains, brought sure release,   And turned to praise our prayer.     HARK! A VOICE FROM HEAVEN.  Words by Oliver Johnson. Music--\"Zion.\"   [Music]  Hark! a voice from heaven proclaiming,   Comfort to the mourning slave; God has heard him long complaining,   And extends his arm to save;     Proud oppression   Soon shall find a shameful grave;     Proud oppression,   Soon shall find a shameful end.  See, the light of truth is breaking   Full and clear on every hand; And the voice of mercy speaking,   Now is heard through all the land:     Firm and fearless,   See the friends of freedom stand.  Lo! the nation is arousing   From its slumber long and deep; And the friends of God are waking,   Never, never more to sleep,     While a bondman,   In his chains remains to weep.  Long, too long, have we been dreaming   O'er our country's sin and shame: Let us now, the time redeeming,   Press the helpless captive's claim--     Till exulting,   He shall cast aside his chain.     THE PLEASANT LAND WE LOVE.  Words by N.P. Willis. Air, Carrier Dove.   [Music]  Joy to the pleasant land we love,   The land our fathers trod! Joy to the land for which they won   \"Freedom to worship God.\" For peace on all its sunny hills,   On every mountain broods, And sleeps by all its gushing rills,   And all its mighty floods.  The wife sits meekly by the hearth,   Her infant child beside; The father on his noble boy   Looks with a fearless pride. The grey old man, beneath the tree,   Tales of his childhood tells; And sweetly in the hush of morn   Peal out the Sabbath bells.  And we ARE free--but is there not   One blot upon our name? Is our proud record written fair   Upon the scroll of fame? Our banner floateth by the shore,   Our flag upon the sea; But when the fettered slave is loosed,   We shall be truly free!     The Freed Slave.   Yet once again, once more again,   My bark bounds o'er the wave; They know not, who ne'er clanked the chain,   What 'tis to be a slave: To sit alone, beside the wood,   And gaze upon the sky: This may, indeed, be solitude,   But 'tis not slavery.  Fatigued with labor's noontide task,   To sigh in vain for sleep; Or faintly smile, our griefs to mask,   When 't would be joy to weep; To court the shade of leafy bower,   Thirst for the freedom wave, But to obtain denied the power--   This is to be a slave!  Son of the sword! on honor's field   'Tis thine to find a grave; Yet, when from life's worst ill 'twould shield,   It comes not to the slave. The lightsome to the heavy heart,   The laugh changed to the sigh; To live from all we love apart--   Oh! this is slavery.     The Liberty Flag.  ALTERED FROM J.H. AIKMAN.   Fling abroad its folds to the cooling breeze,   Let it float at the mast-head high; And gather around, all hearts resolved,   To sustain it there or die: An emblem of peace and hope to the world,   Unstained let it ever be; And say to the world, where'er it waves,   Our flag is the flag of the free!  That banner proclaims to the list'ning earth,   That the reign of base tyrants is o'er, The galling chain of the cruel lord,   Shall enslave mankind no more: An emblem of hope to the poor and crushed,   O place it where all may see; And shout with glad voice as you raise it high,   Our flag is the flag of the free!  Then on high, on high let that banner wave,   And lead us the foe to meet, Let it float in triumph o'er our heads,   Or be our winding sheet; And never, oh, never be it furled,   'Till it wave o'er earth and sea; And all mankind shall swell the shout   Our flag is the flag of the free.     MARCH TO THE BATTLEFIELD.  Parody by G.W.C. Air \"Oft in the stilly night.\"   [Music]  March to the battlefield,   The foe is now before us; Each heart is freedom's shield,   And heaven is smiling o'er us. The woes and pains of slavery's chains,   That bind three millions under; In proud disdain we'll burst their chain,   And tear each link asunder.  Who for his country brave,   Would fly from her invader? Who his base life to save   Would traitor like degrade her? Our hallowed cause--   Our homes and laws, 'Gainst tyrant hosts sustaining,   We'll win a crown of bright renown, Or die, man's rights maintaining,     March to the battlefield, &c.     Oft in the Chilly Night.  BY PIERPONT.

THE REUNION                    256     CHAPTER I  _A Peasant's Hut in Russia_   In the last volume of the Red Cross series the four American girls spent six months in tragic little Belgium. There, in an American hospital in Brussels, devoted to the care, not of wounded soldiers, but of ill Belgians, three of the girls lived and worked.  But Eugenia went alone to dwell in a house in the woods because the cry of the children in Belgium made the strongest appeal to her. The house was a lonely one, supposed to be haunted, yet in spite of this Eugenia moved in. There the money of the girl whom her friend had once believed \"poor as a church mouse\" fed and cared for her quickly acquired family.  In Eugenia's haunted house were other sojourners furnishing the mystery of this story and endangering her liberty, almost her life. They were a Belgian officer and his family whom the Red Cross girl kept in hiding. Somehow the officer had managed to return to his own country from the fighting line in Belgium. After securing the papers he desired from the enemy, by Eugenia's aid, he was enabled to return once more to King Albert and the Allied armies. Thus Eugenia was left alone to bear the brunt of the German displeasure after the discovery of her misdeeds. She was imprisoned in Brussels, and became dangerously ill. Finally, because she was an American, Eugenia was made to leave the country, rather than to suffer the punishment which would have been hers had she belonged to another nationality.  But the four American Red Cross girls also had the companionship of Dick Thornton during their stay in the once lovely capital of Belgium.  Dick had not recovered the use of his arm, but in spite of this had come to Brussels to help with the work of the American Relief society.  Here his once friendly relation with Barbara Meade no longer existed. Because of her change of attitude he apparently grew more attached to Nona Davis.  However, at the close of the story, when Barbara is taking Eugenia back to southern France, she and Dick unexpectedly meet aboard a fog-bound ship. And in the darkness the light finally shines when Dick and Barbara discover at last that their feeling for each other is stronger than friendship.  Later, near \"the pool of truth\" not far from the \"Farmhouse with the Blue Front Door,\" Eugenia Peabody again meets Captain Henri Castaigne, the young French officer whom she had once nursed back to health. A short time afterwards he and Eugenia are married.  Later the three other American Red Cross girls decide to continue their nursing of the wounded soldiers of the Allied armies in far-off Russia.  One cold October afternoon three American girls were standing in the stone courtyard of a great Russian fortress near the border line of Poland.  Situated upon a cone-shaped hill, the fort itself had been built like the three sides of a square, with the yard as the center. Along the fourth side ran a cement wall with a single iron gate.  Evidently the three girls were engaged in Red Cross work, for they wore the familiar service uniforms. One of them had on a heavy coat and cap, but the other two must have just come out of doors for a few moments.  Indeed, their first words revealed this fact.  \"I really don't feel that you should be starting upon this expedition alone, Nona,\" Mildred Thornton argued. She was a tall girl, with heavy, flaxen hair and quiet, steel-gray eyes. She was gazing anxiously about her, for Russia was a new and strange world to the three American Red Cross nurses, who had arrived at their present headquarters only a few weeks before.  Nearly a year had passed since the four friends separated in Belgium. Then Mildred and Nona Davis had remained at their posts to care for the homeless Belgian children, while Barbara Meade and Eugenia Peabody returned to southern France.  Now at the close of Mildred Thornton's speech to Nona, Barbara Meade frowned. She was poised on one foot as if expecting to flee at any moment.  \"I quite agree with you, Mildred,\" she protested. \"Nona's message was far too mysterious and vague to consider answering. We must not forget that we are now in a country and among a people whom we don't understand in the least. Besides, I promised both Dick and Eugenia that we would be more careful. How I wish one or the other of them were here to advise us!\"  Shivering, Barbara, who was the youngest and smallest of the girls, slipped her arm through Mildred's.  A few yards before them sentries were marching slowly up and down, with their rifles resting on their shoulders, while a double row guarded a single wide gate. Every now and then a common soldier passed on his way to the performance of some special duty. Gray and colorless, the afternoon had a peculiar dampness as if the wind had blown across acres of melting snow.  Nevertheless in reply to her friends' objections Nona Davis shook her head.  \"Yes, I realize you may both be right, and yet so urgent was my message that I feel compelled to do what was asked of me. But don't worry about me, I have the letter with the directions safe in my pocket. Good-by.\"  Then before either of the other girls could find time to argue the point a second time, the young southern girl had kissed each of them and turned away. Later they saw her give the password at the gate and the sentry allow her to pass out.  Before her lay a stretch of sparsely settled country divided by a wide and much traveled road. Several miles further along a wide river crossed the land, but near at hand there were only small farms and meagre clumps of pine woods.  After a few more words of disapproval, Barbara Meade shrugged her shoulders, and then she and Mildred re-entered the small curved doorway of the Russian fort. The left wing was being used as a hospital for the wounded, while the rest of the great fortification was crowded with officers and soldiers.  These men were being held in reserve to await the threatened invasion of the oncoming German hosts. Warsaw had fallen and one by one the ancient Russian fortifications once deemed invincible had given way before the German guns. But here at Grovno, under the command of the great General Alexis, the Russians were to make a final stand.  However, without thinking of anything save personal matters, Nona Davis first set out along the main traveled road. Now and then she was compelled to step aside to let a great ox cart go past; these carts were filled with provisions being brought into the fort. Occasionally a covered car rattled past loaded with munitions of war, or a heavy piece of artillery drawn on low trucks. But one would like to have seen a far greater quantity of supplies of all kinds being brought to the old fortress. It was an open secret that the supply of munitions was not what it should be, and yet Grovno was expected to withstand all attacks.  But the young American girl was not reflecting upon the uncertainties of war during her walk. Neither did she feel any nervousness because of the newness of her surroundings, for the country in the rear of the fortifications was chiefly inhabited by Russian women and children and a few old men.  Nona walked on quickly and with a speed and careless grace that covered the ground without apparent effort.  She was looking extremely well, but above all other things Nona Davis appeared supremely interested. For some reason, still unknown to her, she had been more stirred and excited by the coming into Russia than any country she had yet seen. She both admired and feared the Russian people, with their curious combination of poetry and stupidity, of dullness and passion. Before returning to her own land she meant to try and understand them better. For somewhere she had read that the future art of the world was to come forth from Russia. It is the Slavic temperament and not the Anglo-Saxon that best expresses itself in music and literature.  Nona's errand this afternoon was a curious and puzzling one, fraught with unnecessary mystery.  Four days before, a Russian boy about twelve years old had appeared at the gate of the fortress at Grovno, bearing a note addressed to Miss Nona Davis. Oddly enough, although the note was written in perfect English, it was not signed. In spite of this it requested that the American girl come to a small house about a mile and a half away to see a former friend.  But who the friend could be, not one of the three girls could imagine. Yet they scarcely talked of anything else. Nona had no acquaintances in Russia save the people she had met in connection with her work, and there was no one in her past whom she could possibly"]]]
