Now the sides were growing slippery from the rain, so the ascent became more difficult than ever.  \"We're in a pickle,\" sighed Sam.  \"Oh, we've got to get out somehow,\" answered his big brother. \"We can't stay here forever.\"  The opening was almost square, with three sides of rough rock. In trying to climb up some of the rocks Tom gave one a shove and it slid from sight, revealing an opening beyond.  \"Hullo! another hole!\" cried the youth, leaping back in consternation. \"Why, the old mountain is fairly honeycombed with them.\"  \"I was never on this side of the mountain before,\" said Dick. \"They used to tell some queer stories about this side.\"  \"Didn't they say some parts were haunted?\" asked Sam.  \"Yes, and it was said that, years ago, many travelers coming this way disappeared.\"  \"Well, why shouldn't they, with so many holes around?\" came from Tom. \"If we get out alive we'll be lucky.\"  With great care they got down on their hands and knees and examined the opening beyond the rocks.  \"I believe it's a big cave,\" announced Dick a few minutes later. \"And if it is, I'm rather inclined to look around inside. Perhaps it will lead to some opening on the mountainside where we can get out.\"     CHAPTER III  A MYSTERIOUS CAVE   At first Sam and Tom demurred to entering the cave--which looked dark and forbidding. But Dick insisted that he was going ahead, and rather than be left behind they went along.  \"We'll light some kind of a torch,\" said the eldest Rover. \"Got some matches?\"  \"Yes, I brought along a pocketful,\" answered Sam. \"Didn't know but what we'd want to build a campfire this noon.\"  \"We'll want one now--to dry our clothing by,\" said Tom. \"Let us pick up the driest of the sticks.\"  This they did, and having entered the cave, they made a good-sized blaze. This sent a ruddy glow around the cavern, and as the boys moved about fantastic shadows went dancing on the rocky walls, adding to the weirdness of the scene.  From the fire each of the youths provided himself with a torch, and thus equipped they moved around the cave with care, taking precautions not to fall into any more holes. They soon found the opening on the mountainside long and narrow and running downward.  \"We don't want to get lost,\" cautioned Sam.  \"Oh, we can always go back to the fire,\" answered Dick.  \"Unless it goes out on us.\"  \"It won't burn itself out for an hour--I saw to that before we left it.\"  As the boys advanced into the cave they came across a heap of bones. Dick examined them carefully.  \"Skeletons?\" queried Sam, and his voice trembled slightly.  \"Yes--of lambs and pigs,\" was the dry answer. \"Somebody has been making this a rendezvous and living on the fat of the land.\"  \"Maybe that accounts for Jerry Burden's losses,\" suggested Tom. \"He said he lost a lamb last spring, and two pigs.\"  \"Yes, and old Richard Feltham lost a pig and some chickens,\" added Dick. \"Maybe this has been a hangout for tramps.\"  \"Do you think they are here still?\" questioned Sam. \"We don't want to have any trouble.\"  \"I am sure I don't know, Sam. But this proves one thing.\"  \"That we can get out of the cave?\"  \"Exactly. See, here is an old coat and a pair of old shoes. Somebody has been in the habit of coming here--and he wasn't in the habit of getting in the way we got in.\"  They moved on, and soon reached a larger opening. Here they found a bit of old harness and, further on, where the ground was soft, the tracks of wagon wheels.  \"Somebody has been in the habit of driving right in here!\" exclaimed Tom. \"We are sure to get out!\" and his face showed his relief.  \"Hark! what's that?\" cried Sam, and shrank back as a strange rumbling was heard. \"Is it an earthquake, or a landslide?\"  \"It's thunder, that's all,\" said Dick, a minute later, as they listened.  \"To be sure--the storm was on us when we fell into the first hole,\" answered the youngest Rover.  \"Perhaps we can be glad we are under shelter--if the storm is going to be a bad one,\" came from Tom. \"But, come on, I want to see daylight again.\"  He moved on and then gave a cry of astonishment.  \"Look!\"  His brothers did so. On one side of the cave were piled thirty or forty packing cases. The majority of them were empty, but three, directed to one Jackson Dwight, Carwell, were full and nailed up.  \"Well, I never!\" murmured Sam. \"Dick----\"  \"The freight thieves!\" ejaculated the eldest Rover. \"Don't you remember what was in the paper before we went south, and what was in again only yesterday? They have been missing freight from Carwell and Boxton and half a dozen other stations for over a year. The thieves must have brought their stuff here and then taken some of it from the packing cases and carted it away again.\"  \"It certainly looks like it,\" answered Tom. \"Only three full cases left. I wonder when these were taken?\"  \"Most likely only a short time ago,\" said Dick. \"The cases look new.\"  \"Do you suppose any of the freight thieves are around? If they are we want to keep out of their way--if they are desperate characters.\"  They moved on, and then Dick called a sudden halt.  \"I can see daylight ahead,\" he said. \"And somebody is moving around. Let us put out the torches.\"  His suggestion was speedily followed, and the three Rover boys advanced with caution. At its outer end the cave became broader while the roof was only about ten feet high.  \"Hullo, here's another surprise,\" whispered Dick, as they came closer to the opening. \"Look at that!\"  He pointed to one side of the cave and there the others saw an automobile runabout standing and on the seat two men dressed for a tour. They were talking to a third man, who was lounging against a front wheel, smoking a brier-root pipe.  \"Maybe they are the freight thieves,\" whispered Tom. \"Let us get out of sight and listen to what they have to say.\"  It was an easy matter to keep out of sight, for the walls of the cave were very uneven at this point. They got behind a projection, and by crawling up a rocky ledge managed to reach a point above and to one side of the runabout and not over a dozen feet from it.  \"Then you weren't going to stop here, Merrick?\" asked the man leaning against the wheel.  \"Not now, Dangler,\" was the reply of the man with the pipe. \"The storm drove us in here.\"  \"When do you expect to meet this Randolph Rover?\"  \"Very soon.\"  \"He ought to be easy--he is so simple minded.\"  \"Oh, I think we can work him right enough,\" put in the third man, who was tall and thin-cheeked.  \"Well, if you do, don't forget that I get my share, Pike,\" said the man called Dangler.  \"Haven't you always gotten your share?\" demanded Pike.  \"I suppose I have.\"  \"And haven't we given you the information whenever any valuable freight was coming this way?\" put in the man called Merrick.  \"Yes, and got your full share of the proceeds, while I ran the risk,\" growled Dangler. \"It's getting dangerous--I'm going to quit--after the next big haul,\" went on the man with the pipe.  \"All right--as you wish,\" answered Merrick. \"I wish this storm would let up. The road will be something fierce for our runabout.\"  \"And bad for my wagon,\" growled Dangler in return.  The boys listened to the conversation with deep interest. The reference to their uncle amazed them, and they wondered what the two men in the runabout had in mind to do. By their talk it was evident they meant to accomplish something unlawful.  \"They are going to play Uncle Randolph some trick,\" whispered Sam. \"We must get home and warn him.\"  \"What we ought to do is to have the whole crowd arrested,\" answered Tom. \"They are all implicated in the theft of freight.\"  \"That's the talk,\" said Dick. \"The question is, How can we do it? We are no match for those three men, and more than likely they are armed.\"  After this the three men conversed in such a low tone the boys could not hear a quarter of what was said. But they learned enough to know that Merrick and Pike were going to meet their uncle and play him false in some way, and they heard the words \"traction bonds\" and \"coupons\" several times.  \"Uncle Randolph had ten thousand dollars' worth of traction company bonds,\" said Dick. \"He bought them only a short while ago. They pay five and a half per cent. interest and he thought them a first-class investment.\"  \"Oh, we'll have to warn him,\" said Sam. \"He is so open-hearted he would trust most anybody.\"  Merrick had descended from the runabout and gone out of the cave. Now he came back, said something to the others, and started up the auto. In another moment he had the machine turned around. Then it spun out of the cave and down a fairly good road in the direction of Carwell. The man named Dangler followed the runabout to the road and watched it disappear around a turn bordered by trees. The storm was now rolling away to the westward and the rain had ceased.  \"They have gone!\" cried Tom. \"Where to?\"  \"Perhaps to our farm--to see Uncle Randolph,\" answered Sam. \"We ought to follow them as quickly as we can.\"  \"I think we had better capture the fellow left behind,\" said Dick. \"We ought to be able to do it.\"  \"That's the talk,\" said Tom. \"Sure we can do it, being three to one.\"  Dangler watched the runabout and then gazed up and down the mountain for several minutes. Then of a sudden he started in a direction opposite to that taken by the machine.  \"He is going away!\" cried Sam.  \"Come on after him!\" called his big brother, and ran from the cave with the others at his heels. Just as he did this Dangler glanced back and saw them.  \"Hey, you!\" he cried in consternation.  \"Stop!\" called out Dick. \"We want you.\"  At this command Dangler was more amazed than ever. But of a sudden he appeared to realize something of what had happened and commenced to run.  \"Stop!\" cried Tom and Sam, but at this the man only ran the faster.  \"Come on--we've got to catch that rascal!\" exclaimed Dick, and started to sprint. The others followed as quickly as they could, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22163"],["title","The Rover Boys on the Farm; or, Last Days at Putnam Hall (#3)"],["body","a rapid chase along the mountain road ensued. But if the boys could run so could the freight robber, and he made the best possible use of his legs until he gained a side trail. Then he darted into this, and when the Rover boys came up he had disappeared.  \"Where is he?\" panted Sam.  \"He took to this path, but he isn't in sight,\" answered Dick. He was almost winded himself.  \"Come on, he must be somewhere around,\" put in Tom, and ran down the path several hundred feet. Then he tripped over a fallen log and went headlong in the bushes and wet grass. He got up looking tired out and cross.  \"We've missed him,\" announced Dick, rather dismally. \"It's a pity, too. He deserves to be put under arrest.\"  \"I think we had better get home and warn Uncle Randolph,\" returned Sam. \"If we don't there is no telling what that fellow Merrick and that Pike may do.\"     CHAPTER IV  AT THE FARM   The others considered Sam's advice good, and after another look around for Dangler, they turned in the direction of home. They were a good three miles from the farm and had to cross the river above the falls, thus adding half a mile more to the journey. It was wet and muddy walking and they had not covered over a mile when Tom called a halt.  \"I am about fagged out,\" he announced. \"Wonder if we can't hire a buggy at the next farmhouse.\"  \"We can try anyway,\" answered Dick.  Directly after crossing the river they came to a small farmhouse, and walked around to the kitchen, where they saw an old woman shelling peas.  \"We can't let you have any carriage,\" she said. \"The men folks are to town and they've got the horses.\"  The boys were about to turn away when Dick thought of something.  \"By the way, do you know a man named Dangler?\" he asked.  \"Sure, I do,\" was the answer.  \"Does he live around here?\"  \"I guess he lives where he pleases. He is an old bachelor and comes and goes as he likes. He used to have a cottage down the pike, but it burnt down last winter.\"  \"Then you haven't any idea where he is stopping now?\"  \"No.\"  \"Do you know a man named Merrick and another man named Pike?\" went on the eldest Rover boy.  At this the old woman shook her head.  \"Never heard tell of them,\" she said.  \"Has this Dangler any relatives around here?\" asked Tom.  \"None that I know of.\"  \"Do you know what kind of man he is?\" asked Sam.  \"I never talk about my neighbors,\" answered the old woman, and drew up her thin lips and went on shelling peas.  Feeling it would be useless to ask any more questions, the three boys journeyed wearily on to the next farmhouse. This belonged to a fat German named Gus Schmidt, who knew the Rovers fairly well.  \"Yah, I let you haf a carriage alretty,\" said Gus Schmidt. \"Put you must pring him back to-morrow, hey?\"  \"We will,\" answered Dick.  \"I vos hear some putty goot stories apout you Rofer poys,\" went on Mr. Schmidt, while he was hooking up his horse. \"You vos on der Mississippi Rifer, hey?\"  \"We were,\" answered Sam.  \"Und you vos go owid on der blains und catch some counterfeiters, hey?\"  \"Yes, we had something to do with it,\" came from Tom.  \"Und den you vos go py der Gulluf of Mexico alretty und find a steampoat vos has nopotty got on it,\" pursued Gus Schmidt. \"Ach, it vos vonderful vot vos habben to somepody, ain't it?\"  \"Didn't you ever have anything happen to you, Mr. Schmidt?\" asked Sam.  \"Only vonce, und dot vos enough. I peen in New York, und der poys call me names. Den I run after dem, und da vos go py a cellar full of vater. I vos run on a poard, und der poys turn dot poard----\"  \"And you fell into the water,\" finished Tom.  \"Not much! I chumped back to der sidevalk,\" answered Gus Schmidt, and then laughed heartily at his little joke.  The three Rover boys were soon in the carriage and on the way to the farm. The horse that had been loaned to them was a speedy animal and they made good time despite the muddiness of the road. The brief storm had been a severe one, and in one spot the roadbed was considerably washed out.  The boys took the carriage around to the barn and left it in charge of Jack Ness, the man of all work. Then they hurried to the house.  \"Oh, boys, I am so glad that you are back!\" exclaimed Mrs. Rover, on seeing them. \"I suppose you are wet through. Better dry your clothing at once, or change them, and I'll get you some hot tea to drink.\"  \"We are all right, Aunt Martha,\" answered Dick. \"We were under shelter during the worst of the storm. Is Uncle Randolph around?\"  \"No, he went to Carwell on business. I am worried about him, for I am afraid he got caught in the storm, for he drove over.\"  \"What did he go for?\" questioned Tom, quickly.  \"Oh, it was a private matter.\"  \"About some traction company bonds?\" asked Sam, who could not hold back his curiosity.  \"Yes. But how do you happen to know about it?\" demanded his aunt, in astonishment.  \"We found something out to-day, aunty,\" said Dick. \"It's a queer piece of business. Do you know where Uncle Randolph was going?\"  \"You mean in Carwell?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I think to the hotel.\"  \"Hum,\" mused the eldest of the Rover boys. \"Wonder if I can get him on the telephone?\" For a telephone line had been put up from Oak Run to the farm.  \"Why, Dick, is there anything wrong?\" demanded Mrs. Rover, turning pale.  \"I hope not, Aunt Martha. We'll soon know. Don't worry, please.\"  \"Your uncle was very much disturbed when he went away.\"  \"I am going to try to telephone to him at once,\" said Dick.  The telephone was on a landing of the stairs, where the bell could readily be heard upstairs and down, and Dick lost no time in taking down the receiver and calling up the office at Oak Run.  \"I want to get the hotel at Carwell,\" he told the operator. \"This is 685 W,\" he added.  \"I cannot give you Carwell,\" was the answer.  \"Why not?\"  \"The lightning struck down some of our poles and the line is out of commission.\"  This was dismaying news and for the moment Dick was nonplussed. Then he spoke to the operator again.  \"Can you reach Farleytown?\"  \"Yes, but the line from Farleytown to Carwell is down, too,\" came over the wire.  \"Can you reach Deeming's Corners?\"  \"No. Can't get to Carwell in any way at all,\" was the decided answer, and Dick hung up the receiver much crestfallen.  \"The storm has knocked the telephone service into a cocked hat,\" he explained to the others. \"The only way for us to reach Carwell is to drive there.\"  \"Then let us do that, and right away!\" cried Tom, who had been talking to his aunt. \"Uncle Randolph took those ten thousand dollars worth of traction company bonds with him, and Aunt Martha says the bonds were unregistered, so anybody could use them.\"  \"Do you think somebody is going to steal the bonds?\" asked the aunt.  \"Two men are up to some game,--that is as much as we know,\" said Dick, thinking it unwise to keep his aunt in the dark any longer. \"And we know the men are rascals,\" he added.  \"Oh, will they--they attack your uncle?\"  \"I don't think they are that kind,\" said Sam. \"I think they'll try to get the bonds away by some slick game.\"  The aunt hated to see the boys go on a mission of possible peril and yet she wanted to have her husband warned. The lads ran down to the barn and had Jack Ness hitch up a fresh team to a buckboard. It was now growing dark.  \"Take good care of yourselves,\" cried Mrs. Rover, as they drove off. \"If the telephone and telegraph poles are down on the road see that you do not run into any of them.\"  They were driving to the gateway of the big farm when they saw Alexander Pop running after them, flourishing something in his hand. Aleck was a colored man who had once worked at Putnam Hall, but who was now attached to the Rover household.  \"I was jess a-thinkin' that maybe yo' boys wasn't armed,\" he said. \"If yo' ain't, don't yo' want dis pistol?\" And he held up a weapon he had purchased while on the river trip with them.  \"I didn't think there would be any shooting,\" answered Dick. \"But now you've brought it, I might as well take the pistol along,\" and he placed the weapon in his pocket.  \"Perhaps yo' would like to hab dis chicken along?\" went on the colored man. He delighted to be with the Rover boys on every possible occasion.  \"No, the buckboard is crowded now,\" answered Dick. \"You do what you can to quiet Mrs. Rover.\"  \"Yes, tell her not to worry about us,\" added Tom.  \"And don't mention the pistol,\" called Sam, as the turnout moved on again.  After leaving the vicinity of the farm, the boys had a distance of thirteen miles to cover. Part of the road lay through the valley which had given the farm its name, but then it ran up and over a series of hills, and through several patches of woods. Under the trees it was dark, and they had to slacken their speed for fear of accident.  \"Danger ahead!\" cried Sam presently, and Dick, who was driving, brought the team to a halt. Across the road lay an uprooted tree.  \"Can't drive around that,\" announced Sam, after an inspection. \"And it will be hard work dragging it out of the way.\"  \"We'll drive over it,\" announced Dick. \"Hold tight, if you don't want to be bounced off.\"  He called to the horses, and the team moved forward slowly. They had not been out of the stable for several days and were inclined to dance and prance. They stepped in among the tree branches and then one animal reared and tried to back.  \"Get up there, Dan!\" cried Dick. \"None of that tomfoolery! Get up, I say!\"  The other horse wanted to go ahead, and he dragged his mate deeper into the tree limbs. Then, without warning, the balky animal made a leap, cleared the tree, and started down the road at breakneck speed.  \"Look out, the team is running away!\" yelled Sam, and then stopped short, for he as well as the others were in danger of being thrown from the buckboard.     CHAPTER V  RANDOLPH ROVER'S STORY   It was a time of peril, and all of the Rover boys realized this fully. The buckboard was a strong one, but the road had been washed out so much by the storm that it was very uneven, and the jouncing threatened"]]]
