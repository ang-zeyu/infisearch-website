The princess was glad he was riding, for she privately accompanied him in the disguise of a wasp; and a wasp, of course, could not have kept up with him in his Seven-league Boots.  \"Hang that wops!\" said Prince Ricardo several times, buffeting it with his pocket-handkerchief when it buzzed in his ear and round his horse's head.  {\"Hang that wops!\" said Prince Ricardo: p129.jpg}  Meanwhile, King Prigio had taken his precautions, which were perfectly simple.  When he thought Ricardo was getting near the place, the king put on his Wishing Cap, sat down before the magic crystal ball, and kept his eye on the proceedings, being ready to wish the right thing to help Ricardo at the right moment.  He left the window wide open, smoked his cigar, and seemed the pattern of a good and wise father watching the conduct of a promising son.  The prince rode and rode, sometimes taking up Pepper on his saddle; passing through forests, sleeping at lonely inns, fording rivers, till one day he saw that the air was becoming Yellow.  He knew that this showed the neighbourhood of Jaunia, or Daunia, the country of the Yellow Dwarf.  He therefore drew bridle, placed his rose-coloured spectacles on his nose and put spurs to his horse, for the yellow light of Jaunia makes people melancholy and cowardly.  As he pricked on, his horse stumbled and nearly came on its nose.  The prince noticed that a steel chain had been drawn across the road.  \"What caitiff has dared!\" he exclaimed, when his hat was knocked off by a well-aimed orange from a neighbouring orange-tree, and a vulgar voice squeaked:  \"Hi, Blinkers!\"  There was the Yellow Dwarf, an odious little figure, sitting sucking an orange in the tree, swinging his wooden shoes, and grinning all over his wrinkled face.  \"Well, young Blinkers!\" said the Dwarf, \"what are you doing on my grounds?  You're a prince, by your look.  Yah! down with kings!  I'm a man of the people!\"  \"You're a dwarf of the worst description, that's what _you_ are,\" said Ricardo; \"and let me catch you, and I'll flog the life out of you with my riding-whip!\"  The very face of the Dwarf, even seen through rose-coloured spectacles, made him nearly ill.  \"Yes, when you can catch me,\" said the Dwarf; \"but that's not to-day, nor yet to-morrow.  What are you doing here?  Are you an ambassador, maybe come to propose a match for me?  I'm not proud, I'll hear you.  They say there's a rather well-looking wench in your parts, the Princess Jaqueline--\"  \"Mention that lady's name, you villain,\" cried Dick, \"and I'll cut down your orange-tree!\" and he wished he had brought the Sword of Sharpness, for you cannot prod down a tree with the point of a rapier.  \"Fancy her yourself?\" said the Dwarf, showing his yellow teeth with a detestable grin; while Ricardo turned quite white with anger, and not knowing how to deal with this insufferable little monster.  \"I'm a widower, I am,\" said the Dwarf, \"though I'm out of mourning,\" for he wore a dirty clay-coloured Yellow jacket.  \"My illustrious consort, the Princess Frutilla, did not behave very nice, and I had to avenge my honour; in fact, I'm open to any offers, however humble.  Going at an alarming sacrifice!  Come to my box\" (and he pointed to a filthy clay cottage, all surrounded by thistles, nettles, and black boggy water), \"and I'll talk over your proposals.\"  \"Hold your impudent tongue!\" said Dick.  \"The Princess Frutilla was an injured saint; and as for the lady whom I shall not name in your polluting presence, I am her knight, and I defy you to deadly combat!\"  We may imagine how glad the princess was when (disguised as a wasp) she heard Dick say he was her knight; not that, in fact, he had thought of it before.  \"Oh! you're for a fight, are you?\" sneered the Dwarf.  \"I might tell you to hit one of your own weight, but I'm not afraid of six of you.  Yah! mammy's brat!  Look here, young Blinkers, I don't want to hurt you.  Just turn old Dobbin's head, and trot back to your mammy, Queen Rosalind, at Pantouflia.  Does she know you're out?\"  \"I'll be into _you_, pretty quick,\" said Ricardo.  \"But why do I bandy words with a miserable peasant?\"  \"And don't get much the best of them either,\" said the Dwarf, provokingly.  \"But I'll fight, if you will have it.\"  The prince leaped from his horse, leaving Pepper on the saddle-bow.  No sooner had he touched the ground than the Dwarf shouted:  \"Hi! to him, Billy! to him, Daniel! at him, good lions, at him!\" and, with an awful roar, two lions rushed from a neighbouring potato-patch and made for Ricardo.  These were not ordinary lions, history avers, each having two heads, each being eight feet high, with four rows of teeth; their skins as hard as nails, and bright red, like morocco. {135}  The prince did not lose his presence of mind; hastily he threw the cake of crocodiles' eggs, millet-seed, and sugar-candy to the lions.  This is a dainty which lions can never resist, and running greedily at it, with four tremendous snaps, they got hold of each other by their jaws, and their eight rows of teeth were locked fast in a grim and deadly _struggle for existence_!  The Dwarf took in the affair at a glance.  \"Cursed be he who taught you this!\" he cried, and then whistled in a shrill and vulgar manner on his very dirty fingers.  At his call rushed up an enormous Spanish cat, ready saddled and bridled, and darting fire from its eyes.  To leap on its back, while Ricardo sprang on his own steed, was to the active Dwarf the work of a moment.  Then clapping spurs to its sides (his spurs grew naturally on his bare heels, horrible to relate, like a cock's spurs) and taking his cat by the head, the Dwarf forced it to leap on to Ricardo's saddle.  The diamond sword which slew the king of the Golden Mines--that invincible sword which hews iron like a reed--was up and flashing in the air!  At this very moment King Prigio, seeing, in the magic globe, all that passed, and despairing of Ricardo's life, was just about to wish the dwarf at Jericho, when through the open window, with a tremendous whirr, came a huge vulture, and knocked the king's wishing cap off!  Wishing was now of no use.  This odious fowl was the Fairy of the Desert, the Dwarf's trusted ally in every sort of mischief.  The vulture flew instantly out of the window; and ah! with what awful anxiety the king again turned his eyes on the crystal ball only a parent's heart can know.  Should he see Ricardo bleeding at the feet of the abominable dwarf?  The king scarcely dared to look; never before had he known the nature of fear.  However, look he did, and saw the dwarf un-catted, and Pepper, the gallant Dandie Dinmont, with his teeth in the throat of the monstrous Spanish cat.  No sooner had he seen the cat leap on his master's saddle-bow than Pepper, true to the instinct of his race, sprang at its neck, just behind the head--the usual place,--and, with an awful and despairing mew, the cat (Peter was its name) gave up its life.  The dwarf was on his feet in a moment, waving the diamond sword, which lighted up the whole scene, and yelling taunts.  Pepper was flying at his heels, and, with great agility, was keeping out of the way of the invincible blade.  \"Ah!\" screamed the Dwarf as Pepper got him by the ankle.  \"Call off your dog, you coward, and come down off your horse, and fight fair!\"  At this moment, _bleeding yellow blood_, dusty, mad with pain, the dwarf was a sight to strike terror into the boldest.  Dick sprang from his saddle, but so terrific was the appearance of his adversary, and so dazzling was the sheen of the diamond sword, that he put his hand in his pocket, drew out, as he supposed, the sham Cap of Darkness, and placed it on his head.  \"Yah! who's your hatter?\" screamed the infuriated dwarf.  \"_I_ see you!\" and he disengaged, feinted in carte, and made a lunge in seconde at Dick which no mortal blade could have parried.  The prince (thanks to his excellent training) just succeeded in stepping aside, but the dwarf recovered with astonishing quickness.  \"Coward, _lache_, poltroon, runaway!\" he hissed through his clenched teeth, and was about to make a thrust in tierce which must infallibly have been fatal, when the Princess Jaqueline, in her shape as a wasp, stung him fiercely on the wrist.  With an oath so awful that we dare not set it down, the dwarf dropped the diamond sword, sucked his injured limb, and began hopping about with pain.  In a moment Prince Ricardo's foot was on the blade of the diamond sword, which he passed thrice through the body of the Yellow Dwarf.  Squirming fearfully, the little monster expired, his last look a defiance, his latest word an insult:  \"Yah!  Gig-lamps!\"  Prince Ricardo wiped the diamond blade clean from its yellow stains.  {The fight with the Yellow Dwarf: p141.jpg}  \"Princess Frutilla is avenged!\" he cried.  Then pensively looking at his fallen foe, \"Peace to his ashes,\" he said; \"he died in harness!\"  Turning at the word, he observed that the two lions were stiff and dead, locked in each other's gory jaws!  At that moment King Prigio, looking in the crystal ball, gave a great sigh of relief.  \"All's well that ends well,\" he said, lighting a fresh cigar, for he had allowed the other to go out in his excitement, \"but it was a fight!  I am not satisfied,\" his Majesty went on reflecting, \"with this plan of changing the magical articles.  The first time was of no great importance, and I could not know that the boy would start on an expedition without giving me warning.  But, in to-day's affair he owes his safety entirely to himself and Pepper,\" for he had not seen the wasp. \"The Fairy of the Desert quite baffled me: it was terrible.  I shall restore the right fairy things to-night.  As to the Fairy of the Desert,\" he said, forgetting that his Wishing Cap was on, \"I wish she were dead!\"  A hollow groan and the sound of a heavy body falling interrupted the king."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21995"],["title","Philosophy and Religion (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's note:     Page numbers in this book are indicated by numbers enclosed    in curly braces, e.g. {99}.

Fellow of the British Academy Fellow and Tutor of New College, Oxford        London: Duckworth & Co. 3 Henrietta St. Covent Garden 1909 All rights reserved     {v}  GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE SERIES  Man has no deeper or wider interest than theology; none deeper, for however much he may change, he never loses his love of the many questions it covers; and none wider, for under whatever law he may live he never escapes from its spacious shade; nor does he ever find that it speaks to him in vain or uses a voice that fails to reach him.  Once the present writer was talking with a friend who has equal fame as a statesman and a man of letters, and he said, 'Every day I live, Politics, which are affairs of Man and Time, interest me less, while Theology, which is an affair of God and Eternity, interests me more.' As with him, so with many, though the many feel that their interest is in theology and not in dogma.  Dogma, they know, is but a series of resolutions framed by a council or parliament, which they do not respect any the more because the parliament was composed of ecclesiastically-minded persons; while the theology which so interests them is a discourse touching God, though the Being so named is the God man conceived as not only related to himself and his world but also as rising ever higher with the notions of the self and the world.  Wise books, not in dogma but in theology, may therefore be described as the supreme {vi} need of our day, for only such can save us from much fanaticism and secure us in the full possession of a sober and sane reason.  Theology is less a single science than an encyclopaedia of sciences; indeed all the sciences which have to do with man have a better right to be called theological than anthropological, though the man it studies is not simply an individual but a race.  Its way of viewing man is indeed characteristic; from this have come some of its brighter ideals and some of its darkest dreams.  The ideals are all either ethical or social, and would make of earth a heaven, creating fraternity amongst men and forming all states into a goodly sisterhood; the dreams may be represented by doctrines which concern sin on the one side and the will of God on the other.  But even this will cannot make sin luminous, for were it made radiant with grace, it would cease to be sin.  These books then,--which have all to be written by men who have lived in the full blaze of modern light,--though without having either their eyes burned out or their souls scorched into insensibility,--are intended to present God in relation to Man and Man in relation to God. It is intended that they begin, not in date of publication, but in order of thought, with a Theological Encyclopaedia which shall show the circle of sciences co-ordinated under the term Theology, though all will be viewed as related to its central or main idea.  This relation of God to human knowledge will then be looked at through mind as a communion of Deity with humanity, or God in fellowship {vii} with concrete man.  On this basis the idea of Revelation will be dealt with. Then, so far as history and philology are concerned, the two Sacred Books, which are here most significant, will be viewed as the scholar, who is also a divine, views them; in other words, the Old and New Testaments, regarded as human documents, will be criticised as a literature which expresses relations to both the present and the future; that is, to the men and races who made the books, as well as to the races and men the books made.  The Bible will thus be studied in the Semitic family which gave it being, and also in the Indo-European families which gave to it the quality of the life to which they have attained.  But Theology has to do with more than sacred literature; it has also to do with the thoughts and life its history occasioned. Therefore the Church has to be studied and presented as an institution which God founded and man administers.  But it is possible to know this Church only through the thoughts it thinks, the doctrines it holds, the characters and the persons it forms, the people who are its saints and embody its ideals of sanctity, the acts it does, which are its sacraments, and the laws it follows and enforces, which are its polity, and the young it educates and the nations it directs and controls. These are the points to be presented in the volumes which follow, which are all to be occupied with theology or the knowledge of God and His ways.  A. M. F.   'O.'     {ix}  PREFACE  These Lectures were delivered in Cambridge during the Lent Term of last year, on the invitation of a Committee presided over by the Master of Magdalene, before an audience of from three hundred to four hundred University men, chiefly Under-graduates.  They were not then, and they are not now, intended for philosophers or even for beginners in the systematic study of philosophy, but as aids to educated men desirous of thinking out for themselves a reasonable basis for personal Religion.  The Lectures--especially the first three--deal with questions on which I have already written.  I am indebted to the Publisher of _Contentio Veritatis_ and the other contributors to that volume for raising no objection to my publishing Lectures which might possibly be regarded as in part a condensation, in part an expansion of my Essay on 'The ultimate basis of Theism.'  I have dealt more systematically with many of the problems here discussed in an Essay upon 'Personality in God and Man' contributed to _Personal Idealism_ (edited by Henry {x} Sturt) and in my 'Theory of Good and Evil.'  Some of the doctrinal questions touched on in Lecture VI. have been more fully dealt with in my volume of University Sermons, _Doctrine and Development_.  Questions which were asked at the time and communications which have since reached me have made me feel, more even than I did when I was writing the Lectures, how inadequate is the treatment here given to many great problems.  On some matters much fuller explanation and discussion will naturally be required to convince persons previously unfamiliar with Metaphysic: on others it is the more advanced student of Philosophy who will complain that I have only touched upon the fringe of a vast subject.  But I have felt that I could not seriously expand any part of the Lectures without changing the whole character of the book, and I have been compelled in general to meet the demand for further explanation only by the above general reference to my other books, by the addition of a few notes, and by appending to each chapter some suggestions for more extended reading.  These might of course have been indefinitely enlarged, but a long list of books is apt to defeat its own purpose: people with a limited time at their disposal want to know which book to make a beginning upon.  The Lectures are therefore published for the most {xi} part just as they were delivered, in the hope that they may suggest lines of thought which may be intellectually and practically useful.  I trust that any philosopher who may wish to take serious notice of my views--especially the metaphysical views expressed in the first few chapters--will be good enough to remember that the expression of them is avowedly incomplete and elementary, and cannot fairly be criticized in much detail without reference to my other writings.  I am much indebted for several useful suggestions and for valuable assistance in revising the proofs to one of the hearers of the Lectures, Mr. A. G. Widgery, Scholar of St. Catherine's College, Cambridge, now Lecturer in University College, Bristol.  H. RASHDALL.  NEW COLLEGE, OXFORD,   Jan. 6, 1909.     {xii}  CONTENTS   LECTURE I  MIND AND MATTER, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   1  1.  Is Materialism possible?  There is no immediate     knowledge of Matter; what we know is always     Self + Matter.  The idea of a Matter which can exist     by itself is an inference: is it a reasonable one?  2.  No.  For all that we know about Matter implies Mind.     This is obvious as to secondary qualities (colour,     sound, etc.); but it is no less true of primary     qualities (solidity, magnitude, etc.).  Relations,     no less than sensations, imply Mind, . . . . . . . . . . .   8  3.  This is the great discovery of Berkeley, though he did     not adequately distinguish between sensations and     intellectual relations,  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  12  4.  But Matter certainly does not exist merely for _our_     transitory and incomplete knowledge: if it cannot exist     apart from Mind, there must be a universal Mind in which     and for which all things exist, _i.e._ God,  . . . . . . .  16  5.  But Theism is possible without Idealism.  The     impossibility of Materialism has generally been     recognized (_e.g._ by Spinoza, Spencer, Haeckel).     If the ultimate Reality is not Matter, it must be     utterly unlike anything we know, or be Mind.  The     latter view more probable, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  19  6.  It is more reasonable to explain the lower by the     higher than _vice versâ_,  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  26   LECTURE II  THE UNIVERSAL CAUSE, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  29  1.  We have been led by the idealistic argument to     recognize the necessity of a Mind which _thinks_ the     world.  Insufficiency of this view.  {xiii}  2.  In our experiences of external Nature we meet with     nothing but succession, never with Causality.  The     Uniformity of Nature is a postulate of Physical     Science, not a necessity of thought.  The idea of     Causality derived from our consciousness of Volition."]]]
