He says the census this year gives Virginia one million and fifty thousand white people, and of these the fifty thousand hold slaves and the one million don't. The fifty thousand's mostly in the tide-water counties, too,--mighty little of it on this side the Blue Ridge! Ain't anybody ever accused Virginians of not being good to servants! and it don't take more'n half an eye to see that the servants love their white people. For slavery itself, I ain't quarrelling for it, and neither was Colonel Anderson. He said it was abhorrent in the sight of God and man. He said the old House of Burgesses used to try to stop the bringing in of negroes, and that the Colony was always appealing to the king against the traffic. He said that in 1778, two years after Virginia declared her Independence, she passed the statute prohibiting the slave trade. He said that she was the first country in the civilized world to stop the trade--passed her statute thirty years before England! He said that all our great Revolutionary men hated slavery and worked for the emancipation of the negroes who were here; that men worked openly and hard for it until 1832. Then came the Nat Turner Insurrection, when they killed all those women and children, and then rose the hell-fire-for-all, bitter-'n-gall Abolition people stirring gunpowder with a lighted stick, holding on like grim death and in perfect safety fifteen hundred miles from where the explosion was due! And as they denounce without thinking, so a lot of men have risen with us to advocate without thinking. And underneath all the clamour, there goes on, all the time, quiet and steady, a freeing of negroes by deed and will, a settling them in communities in free States, a belonging to and supporting Colonization Societies. There are now forty thousand free negroes in Virginia, and Heaven knows how many have been freed and established elsewhere! It is our best people who make these wills, freeing their slaves, and in Virginia, at least, everybody, sooner or later, follows the best people. 'Gradual manumission, Mr. Green,' that's what Colonel Anderson said, 'with colonization in Africa if possible. The difficulties are enough to turn a man's hair grey, but,' said he, 'slavery's knell has struck, and we'll put an end to it in Virginia peacefully and with some approach to wisdom--if only they'll stop stirring the gunpowder!'\"  The miller raised his large head, with its effect of white powder from the mill, and regarded the landscape. \"'We're all mighty blind, poor creatures,' as the preacher says, but I reckon one day we'll find the right way, both for us and for that half million poor, dark-skinned, lovable, never-knew-any-better, pretty-happy-on-the-whole, way-behind-the-world people that King James and King Charles and King George saddled us with, not much to their betterment and to our certain hurt. I reckon we'll find it. But I'm damned if I'm going to take the North's word for it that she has the way! Her old way was to sell her negroes South.\"  \"I've thought and thought,\" said Allan. \"People mean well, and yet there's such a dreadful lot of tragedy in the world!\"  \"I agree with you there,\" quoth the miller. \"And I certainly don't deny that slavery's responsible for a lot of bitter talk and a lot of red-hot feeling; for some suffering to some negroes, too, and for a deal of harm to almost all whites. And I, for one, will be powerful glad when every negro, man and woman, is free. They can never really grow until they are free--I'll acknowledge that. And if they want to go back to their own country I'd pay my mite to help them along. I think I owe it to them--even though as far as I know I haven't a forbear that ever did them wrong. Trouble is, don't any of them want to go back! You couldn't scare them worse than to tell them you were going to help them back to their fatherland! The Lauderdale negroes, for instance--never see one that he isn't laughing! And Tullius at Three Oaks,--_he'd_ say he couldn't possibly think of going--must stay at Three Oaks and look after Miss Margaret and the children! No, it isn't an easy subject, look at it any way you will. But as between us and the North, it ain't the main subject of quarrel--not by a long shot it ain't! The quarrel's that a man wants to take all the grist, mine as well as his, and grind it in his mill! Well, I won't let him--that's all. And here's your road to Thunder Run.\"  Allan strode on alone over the frozen hills. Before him sprang the rampart of the mountains, magnificently drawn against the eastern sky. To either hand lay the fallow fields, rolled the brown hills, rose the shadowy bulk of forest trees, showed the green of winter wheat. The evening was cold, but without wind and soundless. The birds had flown south, the cattle were stalled, the sheep folded. There was only the earth, field and hill and mountain, the up and down of a narrow road, and the glimmer of a distant stream. The sunset had been red, and it left a colour that flared to the zenith.  The young man, tall, blond, with grey-blue eyes and short, fair beard, covered with long strides the frozen road. It led him over a lofty hill whose summit commanded a wide prospect. Allan, reaching this height, hesitated a moment, then crossed to a grey zigzag of rail fence, and, leaning his arms upon it, looked forth over hill and vale, forest and stream. The afterglow was upon the land. He looked at the mountains, the great mountains, long and clean of line as the marching rollers of a giant sea, not split or jagged, but even, unbroken, and old, old, the oldest almost in the world. Now the ancient forest clothed them, while they were given, by some constant trick of the light, the distant, dreamy blue from which they took their name. The Blue Ridge--the Blue Ridge--and then the hills and the valleys, and all the rushing creeks, and the grandeur of the trees, and to the east, steel clear between the sycamores and the willows, the river--the upper reaches of the river James.  The glow deepened. From a farmhouse in the valley came the sound of a bell. Allan straightened himself, lifting his arms from the grey old rails. He spoke aloud.              Breathes there the man with soul so dead,--  The bell rang again, the rose suffused the sky to the zenith. The young man drew a long breath, and, turning, began to descend the hill.  Before him, at a turn of the road and overhanging a precipitous hollow, in the spring carpeted with bloodroot, but now thick with dead leaves, lay a giant oak, long ago struck down by lightning. The branches had been cut away, but the blackened trunk remained, and from it as vantage point one received another great view of the rolling mountains and the valleys between. Allan Gold, coming down the hill, became aware, first of a horse fastened to a wayside sapling, then of a man seated upon the fallen oak, his back to the road, his face to the darkening prospect. Below him the winter wind made a rustling in the dead leaves. Evidently another had paused to admire the view, or to collect and mould between the hands of the soul the crowding impressions of a decisive day. It was, apparently, the latter purpose; for as Allan approached the ravine there came to him out of the dusk, in a controlled but vibrant voice, the following statement, repeated three times: \"We are going to have war.--We are going to have war.--We are going to have war.\"  Allan sent his own voice before him. \"I trust in God that's not true!--It's Richard Cleave, there, isn't it?\"  The figure on the oak, swinging itself around, sat outlined against the violet sky. \"Yes, Richard Cleave. It's a night to make one think, Allan--to make one think--to make one think!\" Laying his hand on the trunk beside him, he sprang lightly down to the roadside, where he proceeded to brush dead leaf and bark from his clothing with an old gauntlet. When he spoke it was still in the same moved, vibrating voice. \"War's my _metier_. That's a curious thing to be said by a country lawyer in peaceful old Virginia in this year of grace! But like many another curious thing, it's true! I was never on a field of battle, but I know all about a field of battle.\"  He shook his head, lifted his hand, and flung it out toward the mountains. \"I don't want war, mind you, Allan! That is, the great stream at the bottom doesn't want it. War is a word that means agony to many and a set-back to all. Reason tells me that, and my heart wishes the world neither agony nor set-back, and I give my word for peace. Only--only--before this life I must have fought all along the line!\"  His eyes lightened. Against the paling sky, in the wintry air, his powerful frame, not tall, but deep-chested, broad-shouldered, looked larger than life. \"I don't talk this way often--as you'll grant!\" he said, and laughed. \"But I suppose to-day loosed all our tongues, lifted every man out of himself!\"  \"If war came,\" said Allan, \"it couldn't be a long war, could it? After the first battle we'd come to an understanding.\"  \"Would we?\" answered the other. \"Would we?--God knows! In the past it has been that the more equal the tinge of blood, the fiercer was the war.\"  As he spoke he moved across to the sapling where was fastened his horse, loosed him, and sprang into the saddle. The horse, a magnificent bay, took the road, and the three began the long descent. It was very cold and still, a crescent moon in the sky, and lights beginning to shine from the farmhouses in the valley.  \"Though I teach school,\" said Allan, \"I like the open. I like to do things with my hands, and I like to go in and out of the woods. Perhaps, all the way behind us, I was a hunter, with a taste for books! My grandfather was a scout in the Revolution, and his father was a ranger.... God knows, _I_ don't want war! But if it comes I'll go. We'll all go, I reckon.\"  \"Yes, we'll all go,\" said Cleave. \"We'll need to go.\"  The one rode, the other walked in silence for a time; then said the first, \"I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22066"],["title","The Long Roll (#4)"],["body"," shall ride to Lauderdale after supper and talk to Fauquier Cary.\"  \"You and he are cousins, aren't you?\"  \"Third cousins. His mother was a Dandridge--Unity Dandridge.\"  \"I like him. It's like old wine and blue steel and a cavalier poet--that type.\"  \"Yes, it is old and fine, in men and in women.\"  \"He does not want war.\"  \"No.\"  \"Hairston Breckinridge says that he won't discuss the possibility at all--he'll only say what he said to-day, that every one should work for peace, and that war between brothers is horrible.\"  \"It is. No. He wears a uniform. He cannot talk.\"  They went on in silence for a time, over the winter road, through the crystal air. Between the branches of the trees the sky showed intense and cold, the crescent moon, above a black mass of mountains, golden and sharp, the lights in the valley near enough to be gathered.  \"If there should be war,\" asked Allan, \"what will they do, all the Virginians in the army--Lee and Johnston and Stuart, Maury and Thomas and the rest?\"  \"They'll come home.\"  \"Resigning their commissions?\"  \"Resigning their commissions.\"  Allan sighed. \"That would be a hard thing to have to do.\"  \"They'll do it. Wouldn't you?\"  The teacher from Thunder Run looked from the dim valley and the household lamps up to the marching stars. \"Yes. If my State called, I would do it.\"  \"This is what will happen,\" said Cleave. \"There are times when a man sees clearly, and I see clearly to-day. The North does not intend to evacuate Fort Sumter. Instead, sooner or later, she'll try to reinforce it. That will be the beginning of the end. South Carolina will reduce the fort. The North will preach a holy war. War there will be--whether holy or not remains to be seen. Virginia will be called upon to furnish her quota of troops with which to coerce South Carolina and the Gulf States back into the Union. Well--do you think she will give them?\"  Allan gave a short laugh. \"No!\"  \"That is what will happen. And then--and then a greater State than any will be forced into secession! And then the Virginians in the army will come home.\"  The wood gave way to open country, softly swelling fields, willow copses, and clear running streams. In the crystal air the mountain walls seemed near at hand, above shone Orion, icily brilliant. The lawyer from a dim old house in a grove of oaks and the school-teacher from Thunder Run went on in silence for a time; then the latter spoke.  \"Hairston Breckinridge says that Major Cary's niece is with him at Lauderdale.\"  \"Yes. Judith Cary.\"  \"That's the beautiful one, isn't it?\"  \"They are all said to be beautiful--the three Greenwood Carys. But--Yes, that is the beautiful one.\"  He began to hum a song, and as he did so he lifted his wide soft hat and rode bareheaded.  \"It's strange to me,\" said Allan presently, \"that any one should be gay to-day.\"  As he spoke he glanced up at the face of the man riding beside him on the great bay. There was yet upon the road a faint after-light--enough light to reveal that there were tears on Cleave's cheek. Involuntarily Allan uttered an exclamation.  The other, breaking off his chant, quite simply put up a gauntleted hand and wiped the moisture away. \"Gay!\" he repeated. \"I'm not gay. What gave you such an idea? I tell you that though I've never been in a war, I know all about war!\"     CHAPTER III  THREE OAKS   Having left behind him Allan Gold and the road to Thunder Run, Richard Cleave came, a little later, to his own house, old and not large, crowning a grassy slope above a running stream. He left the highway, opened a five-barred gate, and passed between fallow fields to a second gate, opened this and, skirting a knoll upon which were set three gigantic oaks, rode up a short and grass-grown drive. It led him to the back of the house, and afar off his dogs began to give him welcome. When he had dismounted before the porch, a negro boy with a lantern took his horse. \"Hit's tuhnin' powerful cold, Marse Dick!\"  \"It is that, Jim. Give Dundee his supper at once and bring him around again. Down, Bugle! Down, Moira! Down, Baron!\"  The hall was cold and in semi-darkness, but through the half-opened door of his mother's chamber came a gush of firelight warm and bright. Her voice reached him--\"Richard!\" He entered. She was sitting in a great old chair by the fire, idle for a wonder, her hands, fine and slender, clasped over her knees. The light struck up against her fair, brooding face. \"It is late!\" she said. \"Late and cold! Come to the fire. Ailsy will have supper ready in a minute.\"  He came and knelt beside her on the braided rug. \"It is always warm in here. Where are the children?\"  \"Down at Tullius's cabin.--Tell me all about it. Who spoke?\"  Cleave drew before the fire the chair that had been his father's, sank into it, and taking the ash stick from the corner, stirred the glowing logs. \"Judge Allen's Resolutions were read and carried. Fauquier Cary spoke--many others.\"  \"Did not you?\"  \"No. They asked me to, but with so many there was no need. People were much moved--\"  He broke off, sitting stirring the fire. His mother watched the deep hollows with him. Closely resembling as he did his long dead father, the inner tie, strong and fine, was rather between him and the woman who had given him birth. Wedded ere she was seventeen, a mother at eighteen, she sat now beside her first-born, still beautiful, and crowned by a lovely life. She had kept her youth, and he had come early to a man's responsibilities. For years now they had walked together, caring for the farm, which was not large, for the handful of servants, for the two younger children, Will and Miriam. The eighteen years between them was cancelled by their common interests, his maturity of thought, her quality of the summer time. She broke the silence. \"What did Fauquier Cary say?\"  \"He spoke strongly for patience, moderation, peace--I am going to Lauderdale after supper.\"  \"To see Judith?\"  \"No. To talk to Fauquier.... Maury Stafford is at Silver Hill.\" He straightened himself, put down the ash stick, and rose to his feet. \"The bell will ring directly. I'll go upstairs for a moment.\"  Margaret Cleave put out a detaining hand. \"One moment--Richard, are you quite, quite sure that she likes Maury Stafford so well?\"  \"Why should she not like him? He's a likable fellow.\"  \"So are many people. So are you.\"  Cleave gave a short and wintry laugh. \"I? I am only her cousin--rather a dull cousin, too, who does nothing much in the law, and is not even a very good farmer! Am I sure? Yes, I am sure enough!\" His hand closed on the back of her chair; the wood shook under the sombre energy of his grasp. \"Did I not see how it was last summer that week I spent at Greenwood? Was he not always with her?--supple and keen, easy and strong, with his face like a picture, with all the advantages I did not have--education, travel, wealth!--Why, Edward told me--and could I not see for myself? It was in the air of the place--not a servant but knew he had come a-wooing!\"  \"But there was no engagement then. Had there been we should have known it.\"  \"No engagement then, perhaps, but certainly no discouragement! He was there again in the autumn. He was with her to-day.\" The chair shook again. \"And this morning Fauquier Cary, talking to me, laughed and said that Albemarle had set their wedding day!\"  His mother sighed. \"Oh, I am sorry--sorry!\"  \"I should never have gone to Greenwood last summer--never have spent there that unhappy week! Before that it was just a fancy--and then I must go and let it bite into heart and brain and life--\" He dropped his hand abruptly and turned to the door. \"Well, I've got to try now to think only of the country! God knows, things have come to that pass that her sons should think only of her! It is winter time, Mother; the birds aren't mating now--save those two--save those two!\"  Upstairs, in his bare, high-ceiled room, his hasty toilet made, he stood upon the hearth, beside the leaping fire, and looked about him. Of late--since the summer--everything was clarifying. There was at work some great solvent making into naught the dross of custom and habitude. The glass had turned; outlines were clearer than they had been, the light was strong, and striking from a changed angle. To-day both the sight of a face and the thought of an endangered State had worked to make the light intenser. His old, familiar room looked strange to him to-night. A tall bookcase faced him. He went across and stood before it, staring through the diamond panes at the backs of the books. Here were his Coke and Blackstone, Vattel, Henning, Kent, and Tucker, and here were other books of which he was fonder than of those, and here were a few volumes of the poets. Of them all, only the poets managed to keep to-night a familiar look. He took out a volume, old, tawny-backed, gold-lettered, and opened it at random--              Her face so faire, as flesh it seemed not,             But hevenly pourtraict of bright angels hew,             Cleare as the sky, withouten blame or blot--  A bell rang below. Youthful and gay, shattering the quiet of the house, a burst of voices proclaimed \"the children's\" return from Tullius's cabin. When, in another moment, Cleave came downstairs, it was to find them both in wait at the foot, illumined by the light from the dining-room door. Miriam laid hold of him. \"Richard, Richard! tell me quick! Which was the greatest, Achilles or Hector?\"  Will, slight and fair, home for the holidays from Lexington and, by virtue of his cadetship in the Virginia Military Institute, an authority on most things, had a movement of impatience. \"Girls are so stupid! Tell her it was Hector, and let's go to supper! She'll believe you.\"  Within the dining-room, at the round table, before the few pieces of tall, beaded silver and the gilt-banded china, while Mehalah the waitress brought the cakes from the kitchen and the fire burned softly on the hearth below the Saint Memin of a general and law-giver, talk"]]]
