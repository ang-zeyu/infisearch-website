The child was borne off to a far distant clime, While the mother was left in anguish to pine; But reason departed, and she sank broken hearted,           In sorrow and woe.  That poor mourning mother, of reason bereft, Soon ended her sorrows and sank cold in death: Thus died that slave mother, poor heart broken mother,           In sorrow and woe.  Oh! list ye kind mothers to the cries of the slave; The parents and children implore you to save; Go! rescue the mothers, the sisters and brothers,           From sorrow and woe.     HEARD YE THAT CRY.  From \"Wind of the Winter night.\"   [Music]  Heard ye that cry! Twas the wail of a slave, As he sank in despair, to the rest of the grave; Behold him where bleeding and prostrate he lies, Unfriended he lived, and unpitied he died.  The white man oppressed him--the white man for gold, Made him toil amidst tortures that cannot be told; He robbed him, and spoiled him, of all that was dear, And made him the prey of affliction and fear.  But his anguish was seen, and his wailings were heard, By the Lord God of Hosts; whose vengeance deferred, Gathers force by delay, and with fury will burst, On his impious oppressor--the tyrant accurst!  Arouse ye, arouse ye! ye generous and brave, Plead the rights of the poor--plead the cause of the slave; Nor cease your exertions till broken shall be The fetters that bind him, and the slave shall be free.     Sleep on my Child.  BY R.J.H.   Sleep on, my child, in peaceful rest, While lovely visions round thee play; No care or grief has touched thy breast, Thy life is yet a cloudless day.  Far distant is my childhood's home-- No mother's smiles--no father's care! Oh! how I'd love again to roam, Where once my little playmates were!  Sleep on, thou hast not felt the chain; But though 'tis yet unmingled joy, I may not see those smiles again, Nor clasp thee to my breast, my boy.  And must I see thee toil and bleed! Thy manly soul in fetters tied; 'Twill wring thy mother's heart indeed-- Oh! would to God that I had died!  That soul God's own bright image bears-- But oh! no tongue thy woes can tell; Thy lot is cast in blood and tears, And soon these lips must say--farewell!     ZAZA--THE FEMALE SLAVE.  Words by Miss Ball. Music by G.W.C.   [Music]  O my country, my country! how long I for thee, Far over the mountain, far over the sea. Where the sweet Joliba kisses the shore, Say, shall I wander by thee never more? Where the sweet Joliba kisses the shore, Say, shall I wander by thee never more? O my country, my country! how long I for thee, Far over the mountain, far over the sea.          Say, O fond Zurima,           Where dost thou stay?         Say, doth another           List to thy sweet lay?         Say, doth the orange still           Bloom near our cot?         Zurima, Zurima,           Am I forgot? O, my country, my country! how long I for thee, Far over the mountain, far over the sea.          Under the baobab           Oft have I slept,         Fanned by sweet breezes           That over me swept.         Often in dreams           Do my weary limbs lay         'Neath the same baobab,           Far, far away, O my country, my country, how long I for thee, Far over the mountain, far over the sea.          O for the breath           Of our own waving palm,         Here, as I languish,           My spirit to calm--         O for a draught           From our own cooling lake,         Brought by sweet mother,           My spirit to wake. O my country, my country, how long I for thee, Far over the mountain, far over the sea.     PRAYER FOR THE SLAVE.  Tune--Hamburgh.   [Music]  Oh let the pris'ner's mournful sighs   As incense in thy sight appear! Their humble wailings pierce the skies,   If haply they may feel thee near.  The captive exiles make their moans,   From sin impatient to be free; Call home, call home, thy banished ones!   Lead captive their captivity!  Out of the deep regard their cries,   The fallen raise, the mourners cheer, Oh, Son of Righteousness, arise,   And scatter all their doubts and fear.  Stand by them in the fiery hour,   Their feebleness of mind defend; And in their weakness show thy power,   And make them patient to the end.  Relieve the souls whose cross we bear,   For whom thy suffering members mourn: Answer our faith's effectual prayer;   And break the yoke so meekly borne!     Remembering that God is just.   Oh righteous God! whose awful frown   Can crumble nations to the dust, Trembling we stand before thy throne,   When we reflect that thou art just.  Dost thou not see the dreadful wrong,   Which Afric's injured race sustains? And wilt thou not arise ere long,   To plead their cause, and break their chains?  Must not thine anger quickly rise   Against the men whom lust controls, Who dare thy righteous laws despise   And traffic in the blood of souls?     THE FUGITIVE.  Words by L.M.C. Air \"Bonny Doon.\"   [Music]  A noble man of sable brow Came to my humble cottage door, With cautious, weary step and slow, And asked if I could feed the poor; He begged if I had ought to give, To help the panting fugitive.  I told him he had fled away From his kind master, friends, and home; That he was black--a slave astray, And should return as he had come; That I would to his master give The straying villain fugitive.  He fell upon his trembling knee And claimed he was a brother man, That I was bound to set him free, According to the gospel plan; And if I would God's grace receive, That I must help the fugitive.  He showed the stripes his master gave, The festering wound--the sightless eye, The common badges of the slave, And said he would be free, or die; And if I nothing had to give, I should not stop the fugitive.  He owned his was a sable skin, That which his Maker first had given; But mine would be a darker sin, That would exclude my soul from heaven: And if I would God's grace receive, I should relieve the fugitive.  I bowed and took the stranger in, And gave him meat, and drink, and rest, I hope that God forgave my sin, And made me with that brother blest; I am resolved, long as I live, To help the panting fugitive.     AM I NOT A MAN AND BROTHER?  Words by A.C.L. Air--\"Bride's Farewell.\"   [Music]  Am I not a man and brother?   Ought I not, then, to be free? Sell me not one to another,   Take not thus my liberty. Christ our Saviour, Christ our Saviour,   Died for me as well as thee.  Am I not a man and brother?   Have I not a soul to save? Oh, do not my spirit smother,   Making me a wretched slave: God of mercy, God of mercy,   Let me fill a freeman's grave!  Yes, thou art a man and brother,   Though thou long hast groaned a slave, Bound with cruel cords and tether   From the cradle to the grave! Yet the Saviour, yet the Saviour,   Bled and died all souls to save.  Yes, thou art a man and brother,   Though we long have told thee nay: And are bound to aid each other,   All along our pilgrim way. Come and welcome, come and welcome,   Join with us to praise and pray!     Am I not a Sister?  BY A.C.L.   Am I not a sister, say?   Shall I then be bought and sold In the mart and by the way,   For the white man's lust and gold? Save me then from his foul snare, Leave me not to perish there!  Am I not a sister say,   Though I have a sable hue! Lo! I have been dragged away,   From my friends and kindred true, And have toiled in yonder field, There have long been bruised and peeled!  Am I not a sister, say?   Have I an immortal soul? Will you, sisters, tell me nay?   Shall I live in lust's control, To be chattled like a beast, By the Christian church and priest?  Am I not a sister, say?   Though I have been made a slave? Will you not then for me pray,   To the God whose power can save, High and low, and bond and free? Toil and pray and vote for me!     YE HERALDS OF FREEDOM.  Music by Kingsley.   [Music]  Ye heralds of freedom, ye noble and brave, Who dare to insist on the rights of the slave; Go onward, go onward, your cause is of God, And he will soon sever the oppressor's strong rod.  The finger of slander may now at you point, That finger will soon lose the strength of its joint; And those who now plead for the rights of the slave, Will soon be acknowledged the good and the brave.  Though thrones and dominions, and kingdoms and powers, May now all oppose you, the victory is yours; The banner of Jesus will soon be unfurled, And he will give freedom and peace to the world.  Go under his standard and fight by his side, O'er mountains and billows you'll then safely ride. His gracious protection will be to you given, And bright crowns of glory he'll give you in heaven.     I would not live alway.  BY PIERPONT.   I would not live alway; I ask not to stay, Where I must bear the burden and heat of the day: Where my body is cut with the lash or the cord, And a hovel and hunger are all my reward.  I would not live alway, where life is a load To the flesh and the spirit:--since there's an abode For the soul disenthralled, let me breathe my last And repose in thine arms, my deliverer, Death!--  I would not live alway to toil as a slave: Oh no, let me rest, though I rest in my grave; For there, from their troubling, the wicked shall And, free from his master, the slave be at peace.     OUR PILGRIM FATHERS.  Words by Pierpont. Music from \"Minstrel Boy,\" by G.W.C.   [Music]  Our Pilgrim Fathers--where are they?   The waves that brought them o'er, Still roll in the bay, and throw their spray   As they break along the shore; Still roll in the bay, as they rolled that day,   When the Mayflower moored below; When the sea around was black with storms,   And white the shore with snow.  The mists that wrapped the Pilgrim's sleep,   Still brood upon the tide; And his rocks yet keep their watch by the deep,   To stay its waves of pride.

The Pilgrim exile--sainted name!   The hill, whose icy brow Rejoiced when he came in the morning's flame,   In the morning's flame burns now. And the moon's cold light, as it lay that night,   On the hill-side and the sea, Still lies where he laid his houseless head;   But the Pilgrim--where is he?  The Pilgrim Fathers are at rest;   When Summer's throned on high, And the world's warm breast is in verdure dressed,   Go, stand on the hill where they lie. The earliest ray of the golden day,   On that hallowed spot is cast; And the evening sun as he leaves the world,   Looks kindly on that spot last.  The Pilgrim _spirit_ has not fled--   It walks in noon's broad light; And it watches the bed of the glorious dead,   With the holy stars, by night. It watches the bed of the brave who have bled,   And shall guard this ice-bound shore, Till the waves of the bay, where the Mayflower lay,   Shall foam and freeze no more.     STANZAS FOR THE TIMES.  Words by J.G. Whittier. Music by G.W.C.   [Music]  Is this the land our fathers loved,   The freedom which they toiled to win? Is this the soil whereon they moved?   Are these the graves they slumber in? Are we the sons by whom are borne, The mantles which the dead have won?  And shall we crouch above these graves,   With craven soul and fettered lip? Yoke in with marked and branded slaves,   And tremble at the driver's whip? Bend to the earth our pliant knees, And speak--but as our masters please?  Shall outraged Nature cease to feel?   Shall Mercy's tears no longer flow? Shall ruffian threats of cord and steel--   The dungeon's gloom--th' assassin's blow, Turn back the spirit roused to save The Truth--our Country--and the Slave?  Of human skulls that shrine was made,   Round which the priests of Mexico Before their loathsome idol prayed--   Is Freedom's altar fashioned so? And must we yield to Freedom's God As offering meet, the negro's blood?  Shall tongues be mute, when deeds are wrought   Which well might shame extremest Hell? Shall freemen lock th' indignant thought?   Shall Mercy's bosom cease to swell? Shall Honor bleed?--Shall Truth succumb? Shall pen, and press, and soul be dumb?  No--by each spot of haunted ground,   Where Freedom weeps her children's fall-- By Plymouth's rock--and Bunker's mound--   By Griswold's stained and shattered wall-- By Warren's ghost--by Langdon's shade-- By all the memories of our dead!  By their enlarging souls, which burst   The bands and fetters round them set-- By the free Pilgrim spirit nursed   Within our inmost bosoms, yet,-- By all above--around--below-- Be ours the indignant answer--no!  No--guided by our country's laws,   For truth, and right, and suffering man, Be ours to strive in Freedom's cause,   As Christians may--as freemen can! Still pouring on unwilling ears That truth oppression only fears.     TO THOSE I LOVE.  Words by Miss E.M. Chandler. Music from an old air by G.W.C.   [Music]  Oh, turn ye not displeased away, though I should sometimes seem Too much to press upon your ear, an oft repeated theme; The story of the negro's wrongs is heavy at my heart, And can I choose but wish from you a sympathizing part?  I turn to you to share my joy,--to soothe me in my grief-- In wayward sadness from your smiles, I seek a sweet relief: And shall I keep this burning wish to see the slave set free, Locked darkly in my secret heart, unshared and silently?  If I had been a friendless thing--if I had never known, How swell the fountains of the heart beneath affection's tone, I might have, careless, seen the leaf torn rudely from its stem, But clinging as I do to you, can I but feel for them?  I could not brook to list the sad sweet music of a bird, Though it were sweeter melody than ever ear hath heard, If cruel hands had quenched its light, that in the plaintive song, It might the breathing memory of other days prolong.  And can I give my lip to taste the life-bought luxuries, wrung From those on whom a darker night of anguish has been flung-- Or silently and selfishly enjoy my better lot, While those whom God hath bade me love, are wretched and forgot?  Oh no!--so blame me not, sweet friends, though I should sometimes seem Too much to press upon your ear an oft repeated theme; The story of the negro's wrongs hath won me from my rest,-- And I must strive to wake for him an interest in your breast!     WE'RE COMING! WE'RE COMING!  Air, \"Kinloch of Kinloch.\"   [Music]  We're coming, we're coming, the fearless and free, Like the winds of the desert, the waves of the sea! True sons of brave sires who battled of yore, When England's proud lion ran wild on our shore! We're coming, we're coming, from mountain and glen, With hearts to do battle for freedom again; Oppression is trembling as trembled before, The Slavery which fled from our fathers of yore.  We're coming, we're coming, with banners unfurled, Our motto is FREEDOM, our country the world; Our watchword is LIBERTY--tyrants beware! For the liberty army will bring you despair! We're coming, we're coming, we'll come from afar, Our standard we'll nail to humanity's car; With shoutings we'll raise it, in triumph to wave, A trophy of conquest, or shroud for the brave.  Then arouse ye, brave hearts, to the rescue come on! The man-stealing army we'll surely put down; They are crushing their millions, but soon they must yield, For _freemen_ have _risen_ and taken the field. Then arouse ye! arouse ye! the fearless and free, Like the winds of the desert, the waves of the sea; Let the north, west, and east, to the sea-beaten shore, _Resound_ with a _liberty triumph_ once more.     ROUSE UP, NEW ENGLAND.  Words by a Yankee. Music by G.W.C.   [Music]  Rouse up, New England! Buckle on your mail of proof sublime, Your stern old hate of tyranny, your deep contempt of crime; A traitor plot is hatching now, more full of woe and shame, Than ever from the iron heart of bloodiest despot came.  Six slave States added at a breath! One flourish of a pen, And fetters shall be riveted on millions more of men! One drop of ink to sign a name, and slavery shall find For all her surplus flesh and blood, a market to her mind!  A market where good Democrats their fellow men may sell! O, what a grin of fiendish glee runs round and round thro' hell! How all the damned leap up for joy and half forget their fire, To think men take such pains to claim the notice of God's ire.  Is't not enough that we have borne the sneer of all the world, And bent to those whose haughty lips in scorn of us are curled? Is't not enough that we must hunt their living chattels back, And cheer the hungry bloodhounds on, that howl upon their track?  Is't not enough that we must bow to all that they decree,-- These cotton and tobacco lords, these pimps of slavery? That we must yield our conscience up to glut Oppression's maw, And break our faith with God to keep the letter of Man's law?  But must we sit in silence by, and see the chain and whip Made firmer for all time to come in Slavery's bloody grip! Must we not only half the guilt and all the shame endure, But help to make our tyrant's throne of flesh and blood secure?  Is water running in our veins? Do we remember still Old Plymouth rock, and Lexington, and glorious Bunker Hill? The debt we owe our Father's graves? and to the yet unborn, Whose heritage ourselves must make a thing of pride or scorn?  Grey Plymouth rock hath yet a tongue, and Concord is not dumb, And voices from our father's graves, and from the future come; They call on us to stand our ground, they charge us still to be Not only free from chains ourselves, but foremost to make free!  Awake, New England! While you sleep the foes advance their lines; Already on your stronghold's wall their bloody banner shines; Awake! and hurl them back again in terror and despair, The time has come for earnest deeds, we've not a man to spare.     RISE, FREEMEN, RISE.  Music by G.W.C.   [Music]  Rise, freemen rise! the call goes forth,   Attend the high command; Obedience to the word of God,   Throughout this guilty land:   Throughout this guilty land.  Rise, free the slave; oh, burst his chains,   And cast his fetters down; Let virtue be your country's pride,   Her diadem and crown.  Then shall the day at length arrive,   When all shall equal be, And Freedom's banner, waving high,   Proclaim that all are free.     Remember Me.   O Thou, from whom all goodness flows!   I lift my heart to thee; In all my wrongs, oppressions, woes,   Dear Lord! remember me.  Afflictions sore obstruct my way,   And ills I cannot flee; Lord! let my strength be as my day,   And still remember me.  Oppressed with scourges, bonds, and grief,   This feeble body see; Oh! give my burdened soul relief,   Hear, and remember me.     A BEACON HAS BEEN LIGHTED.  Parody by G.W.C. Air, \"Blue-eyed Mary.\"   [Music]  A beacon has been lighted,   Bright as the noonday sun; On worlds of mind benighted,   Its rays are pouring down; Full many a shrine of error,   And many a deed of shame, Dismayed, has shrunk in terror,   Before the lighted flame.  Chorus.      Victorious, on, victorious!     Proud beacon onward haste;     Till floods of light all glorious,     Illume the moral waste.  Oppression foul has foundered,   The demon gasps for breath; His rapid march is downward,   To everlasting death. Old age and youth united,   His works shall prostrate hurl, And soon himself, affrighted,   Shall hurry from this world.     Victorious, on, victorious, &c.  Proud liberty untiring,   Strikes at the monster's heart; Beneath her blows expiring,   He dreads her well-aimed dart. Her blows--we'll pray \"God speed\" them,   Oppression to despoil; And how we fought for freedom,   Let future ages tell.     Victorious, on, victorious, &c.     OUR COUNTRYMEN IN CHAINS.  Words by Whittier. \"Beatitude,\" by T. Hastings.   [Music]  Our fellow countrymen in chains,   Slaves"]]]
