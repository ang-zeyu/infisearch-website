THE SECOND MAN  Isn't that English bacon awful stuff to get down?   THE FIRST MAN  It certainly is: all meat and gristle. I wonder what an Englishman would say if you put him next to a plate of genuine, crisp, _American_ bacon.   THE SECOND MAN  I guess he would yell for the police--or choke to death.   THE FIRST MAN  Did you like the German cooking on the _Kronprinz_?   THE SECOND MAN  Well, I did and I didn't. The chicken à la Maryland was very good, but they had it only once. I could eat it every day.   THE FIRST MAN  Why didn't you order it?   THE SECOND MAN  It wasn't on the bill.   THE FIRST MAN  Oh, bill be damned! You might have ordered it anyhow. Make a fuss and you'll get what you want. These foreigners have to be bossed around. They're used to it.   THE SECOND MAN  I guess you're right. There was a fellow near me who set up a holler about his room the minute he saw it--said it was dark and musty and not fit to pen a hog in--and they gave him one twice as large, and the chief steward bowed and scraped to him, and the room stewards danced around him as if he was a duke. And yet I heard later that he was nothing but a Bismarck herring importer from Hoboken.   THE FIRST MAN  Yes, that's the way to get what you want. Did you have any nobility on board?   THE SECOND MAN  Yes, there was a Hungarian baron in the automobile business, and two English sirs. The baron was quite a decent fellow: I had a talk with him in the smoking room one night. He didn't put on any airs at all. You would have thought he was an ordinary man. But the sirs kept to themselves. All they did the whole voyage was to write letters, wear their dress suits and curse the stewards.   THE FIRST MAN  They tell me over here that the best eating is on the French lines.   THE SECOND MAN  Yes, so I hear. But some say, too, that the Scandinavian lines are best, and then again I have heard people boosting the Italian lines.   THE FIRST MAN  I guess each one has its points. They say that you get wine free with meals on the French boats.   THE SECOND MAN  But I hear it's fourth-rate wine.   THE FIRST MAN  Well, you don't have to drink it.   THE SECOND MAN  That's so. But, as for me, I can't stand a Frenchman. I'd rather do without the wine and travel with the Dutch. Paris is dead compared with Berlin.   THE FIRST MAN  So it is. But those Germans are awful sharks. The way they charge in Berlin is enough to make you sick.   THE SECOND MAN  Don't tell _me_. I have been there. No longer ago than last Tuesday--or was it last Monday?--I went into one of those big restaurants on the Unter den Linden and ordered a small steak, French fried potatoes, a piece of pie and a cup of coffee--and what do you think those thieves charged me for it? Three marks fifty. That's eighty-seven and a half cents. Why, a man could have got the same meal at home for a dollar. These Germans are running wild. American money has gone to their heads. They think every American they get hold of is a millionaire.   THE FIRST MAN  The French are worse. I went into a hotel in Paris and paid ten francs a day for a room for myself and wife, and when we left they charged me one franc forty a day extra for sweeping it out and making the bed!   THE SECOND MAN  That's nothing. Here in Innsbruck they charge you half a krone a day _taxes_.   THE FIRST MAN  What! You don't say!   THE SECOND MAN  Sure thing. And if you don't eat breakfast in the hotel they charge you a krone for it anyhow.   THE FIRST MAN  Well, well, what next? But, after all, you can't blame them. We Americans come over here and hand them our pocket-books, and we ought to be glad if we get anything back at all. The way a man has to tip is something fearful.   THE SECOND MAN  Isn't it, though! I stayed in Dresden a week, and when I left there were six grafters lined up with their claws out. First came the port_eer_. Then came----   THE FIRST MAN  How much did you give the port_eer_?   THE SECOND MAN  Five marks.   THE FIRST MAN  You gave him too much. You ought to have given him about three marks, or, say, two marks fifty. How much was your hotel bill?   THE SECOND MAN  Including everything?   THE FIRST MAN  No, just your bill for your room.   THE SECOND MAN  I paid six marks a day.   THE FIRST MAN  Well, that made forty-two marks for the week. Now the way to figure out how much the port_eer_ ought to get is easy: a fellow I met in Baden-Baden showed me how to do it. First, you multiply your hotel bill by two, then you divide it by twenty-seven, and then you knock off half a mark. Twice forty-two is eighty-four. Twenty-seven into eighty-four goes about three times, and half from three leaves two and a half. See how easy it is?   THE SECOND MAN  It _looks_ easy, anyhow. But you haven't got much time to do all that figuring.   THE FIRST MAN  Well, let the port_eer_ wait. The longer he has to wait the more he appreciates you.   THE SECOND MAN  But how about the others?   THE FIRST MAN  It's just as simple. Your chambermaid gets a quarter of a mark for every day you have been in the hotel. But if you stay less than four days she gets a whole mark anyhow. If there are two in the party she gets half a mark a day, but no more than three marks in any one week.   THE SECOND MAN  But suppose there are two chambermaids? In Dresden there was one on day duty and one on night duty. I left at six o'clock in the evening, and so they were both on the job.   THE FIRST MAN  Don't worry. They'd have been on the job anyhow, no matter when you left. But it's just as easy to figure out the tip for two as for one. All you have to do is to add fifty per cent. and then divide it into two halves, and give one to each girl. Or, better still, give it all to one girl and tell her to give half to her pal. If there are three chambermaids, as you sometimes find in the swell hotels, you add another fifty per cent. and then divide by three. And so on.   THE SECOND MAN  I see. But how about the hall porter and the floor waiter?   THE FIRST MAN  Just as easy. The hall porter gets whatever the chambermaid gets, plus twenty-five per cent.--but no more than two marks in any one week. The floor waiter gets thirty pfennigs a day straight, but if you stay only one day he gets half a mark, and if you stay more than a week he gets two marks flat a week after the first week. In some hotels the hall porter don't shine shoes. If he don't he gets just as much as if he does, but then the actual \"boots\" has to be taken care of. He gets half a mark every two days. Every time you put out an extra pair of shoes he gets fifty per cent. more for that day. If you shine your own shoes, or go without shining them, the \"boots\" gets half his regular tip, but never less than a mark a week.   THE SECOND MAN  Certainly it seems simple enough. I never knew there was any such system.   THE FIRST MAN  I guess you didn't. Very few do. But it's just because Americans don't know it that these foreign blackmailers shake 'em down. Once you let the port_eer_ see that you know the ropes, he'll pass the word on to the others, and you'll be treated like a native.   THE SECOND MAN  I see. But how about the elevator boy? I gave the elevator boy in Dresden two marks and he almost fell on my neck, so I figured that I played the sucker.   THE FIRST MAN  So you did. The rule for elevator boys is still somewhat in the air, because so few of these bum hotels over here have elevators, but you can sort of reason the thing out if you put your mind on it. When you get on a street car in Germany, what tip do you give the conductor?   THE SECOND MAN  Five pfennigs.   THE FIRST MAN.  Naturally. That's the tip fixed by custom. You may almost say it's the unwritten law. If you gave the conductor more, he would hand you change. Well, how I reason it out is this way: If five pfennigs is enough for a car conductor, who may carry you three miles, why shouldn't it be enough for the elevator boy, who may carry you only three stories?   THE SECOND MAN  It seems fair, certainly.   THE FIRST MAN  And it _is_ fair. So all you have to do is to keep account of the number of times you go up and down in the elevator, and then give the elevator boy five pfennigs for each trip. Say you come down in the morning, go up in the evening, and average one other round trip a day. That makes twenty-eight trips a week. Five times twenty-eight is one mark forty--and there you are.   THE SECOND MAN  I see. By the way, what hotel are you stopping at?   THE FIRST MAN  The Goldene Esel.   THE SECOND MAN  How is it?   THE FIRST MAN  Oh, so-so. Ask for oatmeal at breakfast and they send to the livery stable for a peck of oats and ask you please to be so kind as to show them how to make it.   THE SECOND MAN  My hotel is even worse. Last night I got into such a sweat under the big German feather bed that I had to throw it off. But when I asked for a single blanket they didn't have any, so I had to wrap up in bath towels.   THE FIRST MAN  Yes, and you used up every one in town. This morning, when I took a bath, the only towel the chambermaid could find wasn't bigger than a wedding invitation. But while she was hunting around I dried off, so no harm was done.   THE SECOND MAN  Well, that's what a man gets for running around in such one-horse countries. In Leipzig they sat a nigger down beside me at the table. In Amsterdam they had cheese for breakfast. In Munich the head waiter had never heard of buckwheat cakes. In Mannheim they charged me ten pfennigs extra for a cake of soap.   THE FIRST MAN  What do you think of the railroad trains over here?   THE SECOND MAN  Rotten. That compartment system is all wrong. If nobody comes into your compartment it's lonesome, and if anybody _does_ come in it's too damn sociable. And if you try to stretch out and get some sleep, some ruffian begins singing in the next compartment, or the conductor keeps butting in and jabbering at you.
