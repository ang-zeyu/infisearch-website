Dutton Jones rasped out rather sharply, jarring on the generally studious air of the eighth-grade room of the Central Grammar School.  \"What were you doing, Master Prescott?\" repeated the stern voice of the principal.  Dick Prescott had glanced up, somewhat startled and confused. By this time every boy's and girl's eyes had turned away from text-books toward Dick Prescott.  \"I was whispering, sir,\" confessed Dick.  \"Oh, was that all?\" demanded the somewhat ironical voice of Mr. E. Dutton Jones, more commonly known as \"Old Dut.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"To whom were you whispering?\"  \"To Master Hazelton.\"  \"If I am intruding on no confidences, what were you whispering about?\" continued Old Dut.  \"I----\" began Dick, and then his face turned still more red under the curious gaze of some fifty boys and girls. \"I was telling Master Hazelton a funny story.\"  \"Do you think it was very funny?\" inquired Old Dut.  \"The story? Yes, sir.\"  The broad grin that promptly spread over Harry Hazelton's face seemed to confirm Dick's claim as to the humorous quality of the story.  \"Master Prescott,\" adjudged the principal, \"you may rise in your seat and tell the story to the whole class, myself included. On this dull, rainy day I feel certain that we all need a good laugh.\"  A smile that grew to a titter in some quarters of the room greeted Dick as he struggled half-shamefacedly to his feet.  \"Go on with the story,\" encouraged Old Dut. \"Or, rather, begin at the beginning. That's the right way to serve up a story.\"  \"I--I'd rather not tell the story, sir,\" protested young Prescott.  \"Why not?\" demanded the principal sharply.  \"Well, because, sir--I'd rather not. That's all.\"  Principal Jones frequently employed that grilling way of questioning one of his pupils, and his implied sarcasm had a very effective way of making young offenders squirm before the class.  Whispering, in itself, is not a criminal offense, yet it often has a sad effect on the discipline of a schoolroom, and of late Old Dut had been much annoyed by whisperers.  \"So you won't tell us all that choice story, eh, Master Prescott?\" insisted the principal, half coaxingly.  \"On account of its being such a very personal one I'd rather not, sir,\" Dick answered, still standing by his desk. \"I might hurt some one's feelings.\"  \"Too bad!\" murmured Old Dut. \"And just after we had all been enlivened by the hope of hearing something really funny! I know your rare quality of humor, Master Prescott, and I had promised myself a treat. My own disappointment in the matter may be cured, but what about the boys and girls of this class? I know that they are all still eager to hear a really funny story.\"  Old Dut paused, glancing impressively about the room. Dick, shifting first to one foot and then to the other, had not yet succeeded in parting with much of the fiery color that had flamed up to his cheeks, temples and forehead.  \"Master Prescott,\" announced the principal, \"the class shall not be deprived of its expected treat. I will tell a story, and I think you will find some of the elements of humor in it. Will you kindly step this way?\"  Dick went forward, head up and chest thrown out, a look almost of defiance in his clear, blue eyes as a titter ran around the room.  \"Stand right here beside me,\" coaxed Old Dut. \"Now, let me see if I can remember the story. Yes; I believe I can. It runs something like this.\"  Then Old Dut began his story. It was a very ordinary one that had to do with a boy's disobedience of his father's commands. But it had a \"woodshed\" end to it.  \"So,\" continued Old Dut, \"Johnson took his boy out to the shed. There, with a sigh as though his heart were breaking, the old man seated himself on the chopping block. He gathered his son across his knee--about like this.\"  Here Principal Jones suddenly caught Dick Prescott and brought that lad across his own knee. The expectant class now tittered loudly.  \"I can't tell this story unless I have quiet,\" announced Old Dut, glancing up and around the room with a reproachful look.  Then, after clearing his throat, the principal resumed:  \"'Johnny,' said the old man huskily, 'I know what my duty in the matter really is. I ought to give you a good spanking, like this (_whack!_). But I haven't the heart to give you such a blow as you deserve. (Whack!) But the next time (whack!), I'm going to give you (whack!) just such a good one (whack! whack!) as you deserve. (Whack! whack!) So, remember, Johnny (whack!), and don't let me catch you (whack!) disobeying me again. (Whack! whack!).\"  Each \"whack\" Old Dut emphasized by bringing down his own broad right hand on Dick's unprotected body.  A few flashing eyes there were in the young audience, and a few sympathetic glances from the girls, but, for the most part, the class was now in a loud roar of laughter.  \"That's the story,\" announced Old Dut, gently restoring Dick Prescott to his feet. \"I think you all see the point to it. Perhaps there's a moral to it, also. I really don't know.\"  Pallor due to a sense of outraged dignity now struggled for a place in the red that covered Dick Prescott's face.  \"You may go to your seat, Master Prescott.\"  Dick marched there, without a glance backward.  \"Now, that we've had our little indulgence in humor,\" announced Old Dut dryly, \"we will all return to our studies.\"  There was silence again in the room, during which the rain outside began to come down in a flood.  \"I'll get the fellows to-night--for that--and we'll carry Old Dut's front gate off and throw it in the river!\" ran vengefully through Dave Darrin's mind.  \"Old Dut needn't look for his late posies to bloom until the frost comes this year,\" reflected Greg Holmes, while he pored, apparently, over the many-colored map of Asia. \"I'll get some of the fellows out to-night, and we'll make a wreck scene in Old Dut's flower beds.\"  Dick said nothing, even to himself, as he picked up his much-thumbed book on physiology and turned the pages. He was smarting not only from the indignity to which he had been treated, but quite as much from the masterful way in which Old Dut had punctuated that \"funny story\" with his broad right hand.  Once in a while Old Dut cast a sly glance in Dick's direction.  \"That young man will bear watching,\" mused the principal, as he caught a sudden flash in Prescott's eye, as the latter glanced up.  The recitation in arithmetic soon came along. This was one of Dick's favorite studies, and, wholly forgetting his late experience, so it seemed, he covered himself with glory in his blackboard demonstration of an intricate problem in interest and discount.  Then the class settled down to twenty minutes' more study.  \"Master Prescott,\" broke in Old Dut's voice, at last, \"did you think my story a funny one?\"  \"Pretty fair, sir,\" answered Dick, looking up and straight into the eyes of the principal.  \"Only 'pretty fair,' eh? Could you tell me a funnier story?\"  \"I'm pretty sure I could, yes, sir,\" answered Dick, with great promptness. \"Only--_I don't believe I'm big enough yet!_\"  There was a moment's hush. Then the class caught the spirit of the answer. A few titters sounded, cautiously--to be followed instantly by an explosion of laughter. Even Old Dut had to join in the laugh.  \"That young man will bear watching,\" thought the principal grimly. \"He's my best pupil, and one of the most mischievous. I'd rather have any youngster mischievous than stupid.\"  Glancing at the clock, Principal Jones swung around, running a finger down a line of push buttons in the wall back of his seat. In this fashion did he announce to the schoolrooms of the seven lower grades that morning recess time had come. Then he swung back.  \"Attention, class!\" he called. Tap! sounded a bell. The eighth-grade boys and girls rose, standing by their seats.  Tap! At the second bell the lines filed out in orderly fashion to the coatrooms, at the sides of the schoolroom.  But many of the young people soon came back. It was raining heavily outdoors on this September morning. True, the boys' and girls' basements served as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22307"],["title","The Grammar School Boys of Gridley; or, Dick & Co. Start Things Moving (#1)"],["body","in bad weather, but the basements were always crowded at such times, and many of the young people preferred to pass the recess time in the schoolroom.  \"Old Dut's getting rather too fresh these days,\" growled Greg Holmes to his chum. Then whispered in Dick's ear:  \"We'll get hunk with him to-night. Some of us will go around and play the wreck scene in his flower gardens.\"  \"Nothing doing,\" retorted Dick briefly.  \"I know a good one,\" whispered Dave Darrin, his dark eyes flashing with anticipated mischief. \"We'll switch Old Dut's new gate off and play Moses in the bulrushes at the river bank.\"  \"Say,\" demanded Dick, gazing curiously at his tempters, \"since when have you thought I don't know enough to pay back my own grudges!\"  \"Have you got a scheme?\" demanded Tom Reade eagerly, while Harry Hazelton and Dan Dalzell, sure that Dick had a \"corker\" of a scheme, grinned as happily as though they had already seen it put through with a rush.  \"Have you got a scheme?\" insisted Dave.  \"Maybe,\" replied Dick evasively.  \"Any of you fellows going down to the basement?\" asked Hazelton after a moment.  \"What's the use?\" questioned Dick. \"Tramp down three flights of stairs, and then climb the flights again in ten minutes.\"  With that Dick sauntered into the schoolroom. Old Dut was seated at his desk, a half dozen of the girls standing about, eating apples or candy, and talking with the principal.  \"Only girls over there by Prin's desk,\" thought Dick with some dissatisfaction. He wandered about for a few minutes, but at last went up to Old Dut's desk as though being reluctantly drawn there by some magnet.  \"Get next,\" nudged Dave Darrin, poking Hazelton in the side. As Dave sauntered over to the desk Harry followed. Tom Reade seemed interested in the scene. Greg Holmes and Dan Dalzell strolled over, arm in arm.  Seeing such an invasion of boys, the girls gave back for a few feet, though they did not quit the scene.  \"Funny the Detroits didn't win the championship this year, isn't it?\" Dick asked innocently.  \"The Detroits haven't any show,\" returned Darrin half disgustedly. \"They've got nearly a month to play yet, but the Detroits are no good this year.\"  \"If all the Detroits were in a class with Pendleton, their new pitcher, this year,\" Dick contended, \"the Detroits would show class enough.\"  Old Dut looked up with interest. A thoroughly skilled and capable teacher, he had always believed in encouraging sports and athletics.  \"That Pendleton fellow is more than a wonder with a ball,\" Dick went on warmly. \"I saw him pitch a game against the New Yorks this summer, and I dreamed about it for a week after.\"  \"What's Pendleton's strong point?\" followed up Dave Darrin.  \"Everything in the pitching line,\" Dick answered.  \"But what is his best point of all, Prescott?\" broke in Old Dut.  Even that experienced school principal had tumbled into the trap that Dick Prescott had so ingeniously laid for him.  \"Well, sir,\" replied Dick, wheeling around to the principal, every trace of resentment gone from his young face, \"I should say that Pendleton's most noticeable trick is the way he twists and handles the ball when he's getting ready to drive in his curve. I watched Pendleton's work that day, and I think I stole the principle on which he uses his right wrist.\"  \"Show me,\" unsuspiciously invited Old Dut.  Dick started to curve an imaginary ball in his right hand, then glanced over the principal's desk. A small, but thick, heavy book lay there.  \"Well, I should say,\" Prescott resumed, \"that Pendleton handles the ball about like this.\"  Picking up the book, Dick used both hands in trying to give it the right preliminary curve.  \"But his delivery is, of course, the great feature,\" the lad went on. \"When Pendleton has the ball curved just right, he raises his right and lets it go like this!\"  Dick was facing the bevy of girls. They were so certain he was going to hurl the book in their direction that they scattered with little cries of alarm.  So forcefully had young Prescott prepared for the throw that the book did leave his hand, though the boy made a frantic effort--apparently--to recover the missile.  Not toward the retreating girls, however, did the book fly. It spun nearly at right angles, and----  Smack! it went, full into the face of Principal E. Dutton Jones.  \"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir!\" cried Dick in a voice ringing with remorse. \"That must hurt you very much, sir.\"  \"It is nothing,\" replied Old Dut gamely, though the unexpected shock had nearly taken his breath. Then he put one hand up to his injured face. \"Why, I believe my nose is bleeding,\" he added, making a quick dive for his handkerchief.  In truth the nose was bleeding. Old Dut made a specialty of low-cut vests and white, immaculate shirt-fronts. Before the handkerchief was in place, three bright, crimson drops had fallen, rendering the shirt-front a gruesome sight to look at.  \"Oh, sir, I hope you will excuse me,\" followed up Dick.  \"Oh, yes; certainly,\" dryly returned the principal, as he rose and made for his private room. There was a handbowl in there, with hot and cold water, and the principal of the Central Grammar School of Gridley was soon busy repairing his personal appearance.  No sooner had he vanished behind the open door than Dave Darrin, Tom Reade, Dan Dalzell, Greg Holmes, Harry Hazelton and several other boys grinned broadly in their huge delight. Dick Prescott, however, admirable actor that he was, still wore a look of concern on his rather fine young face.  \"One thing I've learned to-day, which I ought to have known before,\" grimly mused Old Dut, as he sopped a wet towel to his injured nose. \"Dick Prescott doesn't need any guardian. He can look out for himself!\"  \"Wasn't it awful?\" repeated a girl's voice out in the schoolroom.  \"No,\" replied her companion. \"I don't think it was. After what he did it served him just right!\"  \"I'm getting the usual sympathy that is awarded to the vanquished,\" smiled Old Dut to himself. \"That's Laura Bentley's voice. She didn't laugh when I was having my innings with Dick. She flushed up and looked indignant.\"  Before Old Dut felt that he was in shape to present himself, all of the eight grades had received seven minutes' additional recess.  At last studies were resumed. Old Dut, however, noted that whenever one of the boys or girls looked up and caught sight of his expansive, crimsoned shirt-front, a smile always followed.     CHAPTER II  A BRUSH ON THE STREET   By the time that the noon dismissal bell rang the rain had ceased, and the sun was struggling out.  Out in the coatroom Dick snatched his hat from the nail as though he were in haste to get away.  \"I'll race you home, as far as we go together,\" proposed Dave Darrin.  \"Go you!\" hovered on the tip of Prescott's tongue, but just then another thought popped into Dick's mind. It was a manly idea, and he had learned to act promptly on such impulses.  \"Wait a moment,\" he answered Darrin. \"I've got something to do.\"  With that Dick marched back into the schoolroom. Old Dut, looking up from the books that he was placing in a tidy pile on the platform desk, smiled.  \"I came back to ask, sir, if your nose pains?\"  Old Dut shot a keen glance at young Prescott, for long experience had taught the school-teacher that malice sometimes lurks behind the most innocent question from a boy. Then he answered:  \"I'm glad to be able to report, Master Prescott, that my nose is causing me no trouble whatever.\"  \"I'm very glad of that, sir. I've been a bit uncomfortable, since recess, thinking that perhaps my--that my act had broken your nose, and that you were just too game to let any one know. I'm glad no real harm was done, sir.\"  Then Dick turned, anxious to get out into the open as quickly as possible.  \"One moment, Master Prescott!\"  Dick wheeled about again.  \"Are you sure that the book-throwing was an accident?\"  \"I--I am afraid it wasn't, sir,\" Dick confessed, reddening.  \"Then, if you threw the book into my face on purpose, why did you do it!\"  \"I was a good deal provoked, Mr. Jones.\"  \"Oh! Provoked over the funny story that I told you this forenoon?\"  \"Not over the story, sir; but your manner of telling it.\"  Old Dut had hard work to keep back the smile that struggled for an appearance on his face.  \"Revenge, was it, Master Prescott?\"  \"Well, I felt that it was due me, Mr. Jones, to get even for the show that you made of me before the class.\"  \"Master Prescott, we won't go into the details of whether I was justified in illustrating my story this morning in the manner that I did, or whether you were right in coming back at me after the fashion that you did. But I am going to offer one thought for your consideration. It is this--that the man who devotes too much thought to 'getting even' with other folks is likely to let slip a lot of good, solid chances for getting ahead in the world. I don't blame any fellow for protecting his own rights and dignity, but just think over what I said, won't you, about the chap who spends too much of his time thinking up ways to get even with others?\"  \"There's a good idea in that, sir,\" Dick assented.  \"Of course you've heard, Master Prescott, that 'revenge is sweet?'\"  \"Yes; I have.\"  \"And I believe, Master Prescott, that the saying is often true. But did it ever strike you, in this connection, that sweet things often make one sick at his stomach? I believe this is just as true of revenge as it is of other sweets. And now run along, or you won't have time to do justice to the pudding that your mother has undoubtedly been baking for you this morning.\"  As Dick hastened from the room he found Dave Darrin waiting for him. Out in the corridor beyond these two encountered Holmes, Dalzell, Hazelton and Reade, for these six boys of the \"top grade\" generally stuck together in all things concerning school life.  \"Was Old Dut blowing you up for showing him how to pitch a book?\" inquired Greg.  \"No; Old Dut doesn't seem to hold that in for me very hard,\" "]]]
