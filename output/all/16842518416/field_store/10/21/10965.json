A rose-coloured mist swam before George's eyes. His spirits, so low but a few moments back, soared like a good niblick shot out of the bunker of Gloom. The years fell away from him till, in an instant, from being a rather poorly preserved, liverish greybeard of sixty-five or so, he became a sprightly lad of twenty-one in a world of springtime and flowers and laughing brooks. In other words, taking it by and large, George felt pretty good. The impossible had happened; Heaven had sent him an adventure, and he didn't care if it snowed.  It was possibly the rose-coloured mist before his eyes that prevented him from observing the hurried approach of a faultlessly attired young man, aged about twenty-one, who during George's preparations for ensuring privacy in his cab had been galloping in pursuit in a resolute manner that suggested a well-dressed bloodhound somewhat overfed and out of condition. Only when this person stopped and began to pant within a few inches of his face did he become aware of his existence.  \"You, sir!\" said the bloodhound, removing a gleaming silk hat, mopping a pink forehead, and replacing the luminous superstructure once more in position. \"You, sir!\"  Whatever may be said of the possibility of love at first sight, in which theory George was now a confirmed believer, there can be no doubt that an exactly opposite phenomenon is of frequent occurrence. After one look at some people even friendship is impossible. Such a one, in George's opinion, was this gurgling excrescence underneath the silk hat. He comprised in his single person practically all the qualities which George disliked most. He was, for a young man, extraordinarily obese. Already a second edition of his chin had been published, and the perfectly-cut morning coat which encased his upper section bulged out in an opulent semi-circle. He wore a little moustache, which to George's prejudiced eye seemed more a complaint than a moustache. His face was red, his manner dictatorial, and he was touched in the wind. Take him for all in all he looked like a bit of bad news.  George had been educated at Lawrenceville and Harvard, and had subsequently had the privilege of mixing socially with many of New York's most prominent theatrical managers; so he knew how to behave himself. No Vere de Vere could have exhibited greater repose of manner.  \"And what,\" he inquired suavely, leaning a little further out of the cab, \"is eating you, Bill?\"  A messenger boy, two shabby men engaged in non-essential industries, and a shop girl paused to observe the scene. Time was not of the essence to these confirmed sightseers. The shop girl was late already, so it didn't matter if she was any later; the messenger boy had nothing on hand except a message marked \"Important: Rush\"; and as for the two shabby men, their only immediate plans consisted of a vague intention of getting to some public house and leaning against the wall; so George's time was their time. One of the pair put his head on one side and said: \"What ho!\"; the other picked up a cigar stub from the gutter and began to smoke.  \"A young lady just got into your cab,\" said the stout young man.  \"Surely not?\" said George.  \"What the devil do you mean--surely not?\"  \"I've been in the cab all the time, and I should have noticed it.\"  At this juncture the block in the traffic was relieved, and the cab bowled smartly on for some fifty yards when it was again halted. George, protruding from the window like a snail, was entertained by the spectacle of the pursuit. The hunt was up. Short of throwing his head up and baying, the stout young man behaved exactly as a bloodhound in similar circumstances would have conducted itself. He broke into a jerky gallop, attended by his self-appointed associates; and, considering that the young man was so stout, that the messenger boy considered it unprofessional to hurry, that the shop girl had doubts as to whether sprinting was quite ladylike, and that the two Bohemians were moving at a quicker gait than a shuffle for the first occasion in eleven years, the cavalcade made good time. The cab was still stationary when they arrived in a body.  \"Here he is, guv'nor,\" said the messenger boy, removing a bead of perspiration with the rush message.  \"Here he is, guv'nor,\" said the non-smoking Bohemian. \"What oh!\"  \"Here I am!\" agreed George affably. \"And what can I do for you?\"  The smoker spat appreciatively at a passing dog. The point seemed to him well taken. Not for many a day had he so enjoyed himself. In an arid world containing too few goes of gin and too many policemen, a world in which the poor were oppressed and could seldom even enjoy a quiet cigar without having their fingers trodden upon, he found himself for the moment contented, happy, and expectant. This looked like a row between toffs, and of all things which most intrigued him a row between toffs ranked highest.  \"R!\" he said approvingly. \"Now you're torkin'!\"  The shop girl had espied an acquaintance in the crowd. She gave tongue.  \"Mordee! Cummere! Cummere quick! Sumfin' hap'nin'!\" Maudie, accompanied by perhaps a dozen more of London's millions, added herself to the audience. These all belonged to the class which will gather round and watch silently while a motorist mends a tyre. They are not impatient. They do not call for rapid and continuous action. A mere hole in the ground, which of all sights is perhaps the least vivid and dramatic, is enough to grip their attention for hours at a time. They stared at George and George's cab with unblinking gaze. They did not know what would happen or when it would happen, but they intended to wait till something did happen. It might be for years or it might be for ever, but they meant to be there when things began to occur.  Speculations became audible.  \"Wot is it? 'Naccident?\"  \"Nah! Gent 'ad 'is pocket picked!\"  \"Two toffs 'ad a scrap!\"  \"Feller bilked the cabman!\"  A sceptic made a cynical suggestion.  \"They're doin' of it for the pictures.\"  The idea gained instant popularity.  \"Jear that? It's a fillum!\"  \"Wot o', Charlie!\"  \"The kemerer's 'idden in the keb.\"  \"Wot'll they be up to next!\"  A red-nosed spectator with a tray of collar-studs harnessed to his stomach started another school of thought. He spoke with decision as one having authority.  \"Nothin' of the blinkin' kind! The fat 'un's bin 'avin' one or two around the corner, and it's gorn and got into 'is 'ead!\"  The driver of the cab, who till now had been ostentatiously unaware that there was any sort of disturbance among the lower orders, suddenly became humanly inquisitive.  \"What's it all about?\" he asked, swinging around and addressing George's head.  \"Exactly what I want to know,\" said George. He indicated the collar-stud merchant. \"The gentleman over there with the portable Woolworth-bargain-counter seems to me to have the best theory.\"  The stout young man, whose peculiar behaviour had drawn all this flattering attention from the many-headed and who appeared considerably ruffled by the publicity, had been puffing noisily during the foregoing conversation. Now, having recovered sufficient breath to resume the attack, he addressed himself to George once more.  \"Damn you, sir, will you let me look inside that cab?\"  \"Leave me,\" said George, \"I would be alone.\"  \"There is a young lady in that cab. I saw her get in, and I have been watching ever since, and she has not got out, so she is there now.\"  George nodded approval of this close reasoning.  \"Your argument seems to be without a flaw. But what then? We applaud the Man of Logic, but what of the Man of Action? What are you going to do about it?\"  \"Get out of my way!\"  \"I won't.\"  \"Then I'll force my way in!\"  \"If you try it, I shall infallibly bust you one on the jaw.\"  The stout young man drew back a pace.  \"You can't do that sort of thing, you know.\"  \"I know I can't,\" said George, \"but I shall. In this life, my dear sir, we must be prepared for every emergency. We must distinguish between the unusual and the impossible. It would be unusual for a comparative stranger to lean out of a cab window and sock you one, but you appear to have laid your plans on the assumption that it would be impossible. Let this be a lesson to you!\"  \"I tell you what it is--\"  \"The advice I give to every young man starting life is 'Never confuse the unusual with the impossible!' Take the present case, for instance. If you had only realized the possibility of somebody some day busting you on the jaw when you tried to get into a cab, you might have thought out dozens of crafty schemes for dealing with the matter. As it is, you are unprepared. The thing comes on you as a surprise. The whisper flies around the clubs: 'Poor old What's-his-name has been taken unawares. He cannot cope with the situation!'\"  The man with the collar-studs made another diagnosis. He was seeing clearer and clearer into the thing every minute.  \"Looney!\" he decided. \"This 'ere one's bin moppin' of it up, and the one in the keb's orf 'is bloomin' onion. That's why 'e 's standin' up instead of settin'. 'E won't set down 'cept you bring 'im a bit o' toast, 'cos he thinks 'e 's a poached egg.\"  George beamed upon the intelligent fellow.  \"Your reasoning is admirable, but--\"  He broke off here, not because he had not more to say, but for the reason that the stout young man, now in quite a Berserk frame of mind, made a sudden spring at the cab door and clutched the handle, which he was about to wrench when George acted with all the promptitude and decision which had marked his behaviour from the start.  It was a situation which called for the nicest judgment. To allow the assailant free play with the handle or even to wrestle with him for its possession entailed the risk that the door might open and reveal the girl. To bust the young man on the jaw, as promised, on the other hand, was not in George's eyes"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2233"],["title","A Damsel in Distress (#6)"],["body"," practical policy. Excellent a deterrent as the threat of such a proceeding might be, its actual accomplishment was not to be thought of. Gaols yawn and actions for assault lie in wait for those who go about the place busting their fellows on the jaw. No. Something swift, something decided and immediate was indicated, but something that stopped short of technical battery.  George brought his hand round with a sweep and knocked the stout young man's silk hat off.  The effect was magical. We all of us have our Achilles heel, and--paradoxically enough--in the case of the stout young man that heel was his hat. Superbly built by the only hatter in London who can construct a silk hat that is a silk hat, and freshly ironed by loving hands but a brief hour before at the only shaving-parlour in London where ironing is ironing and not a brutal attack, it was his pride and joy. To lose it was like losing his trousers. It made him feel insufficiently clad. With a passionate cry like that of some wild creature deprived of its young, the erstwhile Berserk released the handle and sprang in pursuit. At the same moment the traffic moved on again.  The last George saw was a group scene with the stout young man in the middle of it. The hat had been popped up into the infield, where it had been caught by the messenger boy. The stout young man was bending over it and stroking it with soothing fingers. It was too far off for anything to be audible, but he seemed to George to be murmuring words of endearment to it. Then, placing it on his head, he darted out into the road and George saw him no more. The audience remained motionless, staring at the spot where the incident had happened. They would continue to do this till the next policeman came along and moved them on.  With a pleasant wave of farewell, in case any of them might be glancing in his direction, George drew in his body and sat down.  The girl in brown had risen from the floor, if she had ever been there, and was now seated composedly at the further end of the cab.    CHAPTER 4.  \"Well, that's that!\" said George.  \"I'm so much obliged,\" said the girl.  \"It was a pleasure,\" said George.  He was enabled now to get a closer, more leisurely and much more satisfactory view of this distressed damsel than had been his good fortune up to the present. Small details which, when he had first caught sight of her, distance had hidden from his view, now presented themselves. Her eyes, he discovered, which he had supposed brown, were only brown in their general colour-scheme. They were shot with attractive little flecks of gold, matching perfectly the little streaks of gold which the sun, coming out again on one of his flying visits and now shining benignantly once more on the world, revealed in her hair. Her chin was square and determined, but its resoluteness was contradicted by a dimple and by the pleasant good-humour of the mouth; and a further softening of the face was effected by the nose, which seemed to have started out with the intention of being dignified and aristocratic but had defeated its purpose by tilting very slightly at the tip. This was a girl who would take chances, but would take them with a smile and laugh when she lost.  George was but an amateur physiognomist, but he could read what was obvious in the faces he encountered; and the more he looked at this girl, the less he was able to understand the scene which had just occurred. The thing mystified him completely. For all her good-humour, there was an air, a manner, a something capable and defensive, about this girl with which he could not imagine any man venturing to take liberties. The gold-brown eyes, as they met his now, were friendly and smiling, but he could imagine them freezing into a stare baleful enough and haughty enough to quell such a person as the silk-hatted young man with a single glance. Why, then, had that super-fatted individual been able to demoralize her to the extent of flying to the shelter of strange cabs? She was composed enough now, it was true, but it had been quite plain that at the moment when she entered the taxi her nerve had momentarily forsaken her. There were mysteries here, beyond George.  The girl looked steadily at George and George looked steadily at her for the space of perhaps ten seconds. She seemed to George to be summing him up, weighing him. That the inspection proved satisfactory was shown by the fact that at the end of this period she smiled. Then she laughed, a clear pealing laugh which to George was far more musical than the most popular song-hit he had ever written.  \"I suppose you are wondering what it's all about?\" she said.  This was precisely what George was wondering most consumedly.  \"No, no,\" he said. \"Not at all. It's not my business.\"  \"And of course you're much too well bred to be inquisitive about other people's business?\"  \"Of course I am. What was it all about?\"  \"I'm afraid I can't tell you.\"  \"But what am I to say to the cabman?\"  \"I don't know. What do men usually say to cabmen?\"  \"I mean he will feel very hurt if I don't give him a full explanation of all this. He stooped from his pedestal to make enquiries just now. Condescension like that deserves some recognition.\"  \"Give him a nice big tip.\"  George was reminded of his reason for being in the cab.  \"I ought to have asked before,\" he said. \"Where can I drive you?\"  \"Oh, I mustn't steal your cab. Where were you going?\"  \"I was going back to my hotel. I came out without any money, so I shall have to go there first to get some.\"  The girl started.  \"What's the matter?\" asked George.  \"I've lost my purse!\"  \"Good Lord! Had it much in it?\"  \"Not very much. But enough to buy a ticket home.\"  \"Any use asking where that is?\"  \"None, I'm afraid.\"  \"I wasn't going to, of course.\"  \"Of course not. That's what I admire so much in you. You aren't inquisitive.\"  George reflected.  \"There's only one thing to be done. You will have to wait in the cab at the hotel, while I go and get some money. Then, if you'll let me, I can lend you what you require.\"  \"It's much too kind of you. Could you manage eleven shillings?\"  \"Easily. I've just had a legacy.\"  \"Of course, if you think I ought to be economical, I'll go third-class. That would only be five shillings. Ten-and-six is the first-class fare. So you see the place I want to get to is two hours from London.\"  \"Well, that's something to know.\"  \"But not much, is it?\"  \"I think I had better lend you a sovereign. Then you'll be able to buy a lunch-basket.\"  \"You think of everything. And you're perfectly right. I shall be starving. But how do you know you will get the money back?\"  \"I'll risk it.\"  \"Well, then, I shall have to be inquisitive and ask your name. Otherwise I shan't know where to send the money.\"  \"Oh, there's no mystery about me. I'm an open book.\"  \"You needn't be horrid about it. I can't help being mysterious.\"  \"I didn't mean that.\"  \"It sounded as if you did. Well, who is my benefactor?\"  \"My name is George Bevan. I am staying at the Carlton at present.\"  \"I'll remember.\"  The taxi moved slowly down the Haymarket. The girl laughed.  \"Yes?\" said George.  \"I was only thinking of back there. You know, I haven't thanked you nearly enough for all you did. You were wonderful.\"  \"I'm very glad I was able to be of any help.\"  \"What did happen? You must remember I couldn't see a thing except your back, and I could only hear indistinctly.\"  \"Well, it started by a man galloping up and insisting that you had got into the cab. He was a fellow with the appearance of a before-using advertisement of an anti-fat medicine and the manners of a ring-tailed chimpanzee.\"  The girl nodded.  \"Then it was Percy! I knew I wasn't mistaken.\"  \"Percy?\"  \"That is his name.\"  \"It would be! I could have betted on it.\"  \"What happened then?\"  \"I reasoned with the man, but didn't seem to soothe him, and finally he made a grab for the door-handle, so I knocked off his hat, and while he was retrieving it we moved on and escaped.\"  The girl gave another silver peal of laughter.  \"Oh, what a shame I couldn't see it. But how resourceful of you! How did you happen to think of it?\"  \"It just came to me,\" said George modestly.  A serious look came into the girl's face. The smile died out of her eyes. She shivered.  \"When I think how some men might have behaved in your place!\"  \"Oh, no. Any man would have done just what I did. Surely, knocking off Percy's hat was an act of simple courtesy which anyone would have performed automatically!\"  \"You might have been some awful bounder. Or, what would have been almost worse, a slow-witted idiot who would have stopped to ask questions before doing anything. To think I should have had the luck to pick you out of all London!\"  \"I've been looking on it as a piece of luck--but entirely from my viewpoint.\"  She put a small hand on his arm, and spoke earnestly.  \"Mr. Bevan, you mustn't think that, because I've been laughing a good deal and have seemed to treat all this as a joke, you haven't saved me from real trouble. If you hadn't been there and hadn't acted with such presence of mind, it would have been terrible!\"  \"But surely, if that fellow was annoying you, you could have called a policeman?\"  \"Oh, it wasn't anything like that. It was much, much worse. But I mustn't go on like this. It isn't fair on you.\" Her eyes lit up again with the old shining smile. \"I know you have no curiosity about me, but still there's no knowing whether I might not arouse some if I went on piling up the mystery. And the silly part is that really there's no mystery at all. It's just that I can't tell anyone about it.\"  \"That very fact seems to me to constitute the makings of a pretty fair mystery.\"  \"Well, what I mean is, I'm not a princess in disguise trying to escape from anarchists, or anything like those things you read about in books. I'm just in a perfectly simple piece of trouble. You would be bored to death if I told you about it.\"  \"Try me.\"  She shook her head.  \"No"]]]
