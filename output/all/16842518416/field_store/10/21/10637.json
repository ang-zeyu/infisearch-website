She had turned herself into an artificial fly (a small black gnat), and Dick might set to his sport again.  \"What a trump that girl is,\" he said aloud.  \"Clever, too!\" and he began casting.  He got a trout every cast, great big ones, over a pound, and soon he had a basketful.  But he began to feel rather bored.  \"There's not much fun taking them,\" he said, \"when they are so silly.\"  At that very moment he noticed that the fly was off his cast, and Jaqueline was sitting at the oars.  \"You see, Ricardo,\" she said, \"I was right after all.  There is not much pleasure in sport that is easy and certain.  Now, apply this moral to dragon-killing with magic instruments.  It may be useful when one is obliged to defend oneself, but surely a prince ought not to give his whole time to nothing else!\"  Dick had no answer ready, so he only grumbled:  \"You're always preaching at me, Jack; everybody always is.  I seem to have been born just to be preached at.\"  Some people are; and it does grow rather tedious in the long run.  But perhaps what Jaqueline said may have made some impression on Ricardo, for he stuck to his books for weeks, and was got into decimal fractions and Euclid.  All this, of course, pleased the king very much, and he began to entertain hopes of Ricardo's becoming a wise and learned prince, and a credit to his illustrious family.  Things were not always to go smoothly, far from it; and it was poor Jaqueline who fell into trouble next.  She had been very ready to lecture Dick, as we saw, and took a good deal of credit to herself for his steadiness.  But one day King Prigio happened to meet Jaqueline's maid, Rosina, on the stairs; and as Rosina was a pretty girl, and the king was always kind to his dependents, he stopped to have a chat with her.  \"Why, Rosina, what a pretty little silver cross you are wearing,\" he said, and he lifted a curious ornament which hung from a chain on Rosina's neck.  It consisted of seven drops of silver, set like this:  {The drops: p72.jpg}   \"May I look at it?\" his Majesty asked, and Rosina, all in a flutter, took it off and gave if to him.  \"H'm!\" said the king.  \"Very curious and pretty!  May I ask you where you got this, Rosina?\"  {\"H'm!\" said the king.  \"Very curious and pretty!\": p73.jpg}  Now Rosina generally had her answer ready, and I am very sorry to say that she did not always speak the truth when she could think of anything better.  On this occasion she was anxious to think of something better, for fear of getting Jaqueline into a scrape about the chemical experiment in her bedroom.  But Rosina was fluttered, as we said, by the royal kindness, and she could think of nothing but to curtsy, and say:  \"Please, your Majesty, the princess gave me the drops.\"  \"Very interesting,\" said the king.  \"There is a little white moon shining in each of them!  I wonder if they shine in the dark?\"  He opened the door of a cupboard which had no windows, where the housemaid kept her mops and brooms, and shut himself in.  Yes, there was no mistake; the darkness was quite lighted up with the sheen of the seven little moons in the silver.  The king looked rather grave.  \"If you can trust me with this cross till to-morrow, Rosina, I should like to have it examined and analysed.  This is no common silver.\"  Of course Rosina could only curtsy, but she was very much alarmed about the consequences to her mistress.  After luncheon, the king asked Jaqueline to come into his study, as he often did, to help him with his letters.  When they had sat down his Majesty said:  \"My dear Jaqueline, I never interfere with your pursuits, but I almost doubt whether _Cornelius Agrippa_ is a good book for a very young lady to read.  The Fairy Paribanou, I am sure, taught you nothing beyond the ordinary magical accomplishments suited to your rank; but there are a great many things in the _Cornelius_ which I think you should not study till you are older and wiser.\"  \"What does your Majesty mean?\" said poor Jaqueline, feeling very uncomfortable; for the king had never lectured her before.  \"Why,\" said his Majesty, taking the silver cross out of his pocket, \"did you not give this to Rosina?\"  \"Yes, sire, I did give her the drops.  She had them made up herself.\"  \"Then give it back to her when you see her next.  I am glad you are frank, Jaqueline.  And you know, of course, that the drops are not ordinary silver?  They are moon silver, and that can only be got in one way, so far as I know, at least--when one spills the water when he, or she, is drinking the moon.  Now, there is only one book which tells how that can be done, and there is only one reason for doing it; namely, to find out what is some other person's secret.  I shall not ask you _whose_ secret you wanted to find out, but I must request you never to do such a thing again without consulting me.  You can have no reason for it, such as a great king might have whose enemies are plotting against his country.\"  \"Oh, sire, I will tell you everything!\" cried Jaqueline.  \"No, don't; I don't want to know.  I am sure you will make no use of your information which you think I should not approve of.  But there is another thing--that eclipse of the moon!  Oh, Jaqueline, was it honourable, or fair to the astronomers and men of science, to say nothing about it?  Their European reputations are seriously injured.\"  Poor Jaqueline could only cry.  \"Never mind,\" said his Majesty, comforting her.  \"There is no great harm done yet, and perhaps they would not believe you if you did explain; but just think, if some people ceased to believe in Science, what would they have left to believe in?  But you are young, of course, and cannot be expected to think of everything.\"  \"I never thought about it at all,\" wept Jaqueline.  \"'Evil is wrought by want of thought,'\" said the king, quoting the poet. \"Now run away, dry your tears, and I think you had better bring me that book, and I'll put it back in one of the locked-up shelves.  Later, when you are older, we shall see about it.\"  The princess flew to her room, and returned with her book.  And the king kissed her, and told her to go and see if her Majesty meant to take a drive.  \"I'll never deceive him again, never . . . unless it is _quite_ necessary,\" said the princess to herself.  \"Indeed, it is not so easy to deceive the king.  What a lot he has read!\"  In fact, King Prigio had been very studious when a young man, before he came to the throne.  \"Poor child!\" thought the king.  \"No doubt she was trying her fortune, wondering if Ricardo cares for her a little.  Of course I could not let her tell me _that_, poor child!\"  In this guess, as we know, his Majesty was mistaken, which seldom happened to him.  \"I wonder who she is?\" the king went on speaking to himself.  \"That great booby, Ricardo, saved her from wild birds, which were just going to eat her.  She was fastened to a mountain top, but _where_? that's the question.  Ricardo never has any notion of geography.  It was across the sea, he noticed _that_; but which sea,--Atlantic, Pacific, the Black Sea, the Caspian, the Sea of Marmora, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, the German Ocean, the Mediterranean?  Her ornaments were very peculiar; there was a broad gold sun on her breast.  I must look at them again some day. She said she was being sacrificed to wild birds (which her people worshipped), because there was some famine, or war, or trouble in the country.  She said she was a Daughter of the Sun; but that, of course, is absurd, unless--By Jove!  I believe I have it,\" said the king, and he went into the royal library and was looking for some old Spanish book, when his secretary came and said that the Russian Ambassador was waiting for an interview with his Majesty.  \"Dismal old Muscovite!\" sighed the king.  \"A monarch has not a moment to himself for his private studies.  Ah, Prigio! why wert thou not born to a private station?  But Duty before everything,\" and wreathing his royal countenance in smiles, his Majesty prepared to give Count Snoreonski an audience.  It was all about the attitude of Pantouflia in the event of a Polish invasion of Russia.  The king reassured Count Snoreonski, affirming that Pantouflia, while deeply regretting the disturbed relations between two States in whose welfare she was deeply interested, would ever preserve an attitude of benevolent neutrality, unless her own interests were threatened.  \"I may give your message to my august mistress, the Czarina?\" said the ambassador.  \"By all means, adding an expression of my tender interest in her Majesty's health and welfare,\" said the king, presenting the count at the same time with a magnificent diamond snuffbox containing his portrait.  The old count was affected to tears, and withdrew, while King Prigio said:  \"I have not lost a day; I have made an amiable but very stupid man happy.\"  Such are, or rather such were, the toils of monarchs!     CHAPTER V. Prince Ricardo Crosses the Path of History.   {Hand reaching for a crown with wings: p83.jpg}  \"I say, Jack,\" said Prince Ricardo one morning, \"here's a queer letter for me!\"  King Prigio had gone to a distant part of his dominions, on business of importance, and the young people were sitting in the royal study.  The letter, which Ricardo handed to Jaqueline, was written on a great broad sheet of paper, folded up without any envelope, as was the custom then, and was sealed with a huge seal in red wax.  \"I don't know the arms,\" Ricardo said.  \"Oh, Ricardo, how you _do_ neglect your Heraldry!  Old Green Stocking is in despair over your ignorance.\"  Now Green Stocking was the chief herald of Pantouflia, just like Blue Mantle in England.  \"Why, these are the Royal Arms of England, you great ignorant Dick!\"  \"But Rome isn't in England, is it?--and the post-mark is 'Roma': that's Rome in some lingo, I expect.  It is in Latin, anyhow, I know.  _Mortuus est Romae_--'He died at Rome.'  It's "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21994"],["title","Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia: Being the Adventures of Prince Prigio's Son (#5)"],["body","the Latin Grammar.  Let's see what the fellow says, anyhow,\" added Ricardo, breaking the seal.  \"He begins, 'Prins and dear Cousin!'  I say, Jaqueline, he spells it 'Prins;' now it is P-R-I-N-C-E.  He _must_ be an ignorant fellow!\"  \"People in glass houses should not throw stones, Dick,\" said Jaqueline.  \"He signs himself 'Charles, P. W.,'\" said Ricardo, looking at the end. \"Who on earth can he be?  Why does he not put 'P. W. Charles,' if these are his initials?  Look here, it's rather a long letter; you might read it to us, Jack!\"  The princess took the epistle and began:  \"How nice it smells, all scented!  The paper is gilt-edged, too.\"  \"Luxurious beggar, whoever he is,\" said Ricardo.  \"Well, he says: 'Prins and dear Cousin,--You and me' (oh, what grammar!) 'are much the same age, I being fifteen next birthday, and we should be better _ackwainted_.  All the wurld has herd of the fame of Prins Ricardo, whose name is _feerd_, and his _sord_ dreded, wherever there are Monsters and Tirants.  Prins, you may be less well informed about my situation.  I have not killed any Dragguns, there being nun of them here; but I have been _under fiar_, at Gaeta.'  Where's Gaeta, Dick?\"  \"Never heard of it,\" said Ricardo.  \"Well, it is in Italy, and it was besieged lately.  He goes on: 'and I am told that I did not misbehave myself, nor disgrace _the blud of Bruce_.'\"  \"I've heard of Robert Bruce,\" said Dick; \"he was the man who did not kill the spider, but he cracked the head of Sir Harry Bohun with one whack of his axe.  I remember _him_ well enough.\"  \"Well, your correspondent seems to be a descendant of his.\"  \"That's getting more interesting,\" said Dick.  \"I wish my father would go to war with somebody.  With the Sword of Sharpness I'd make the enemy whistle!  Drive on, Jack.\"  \"'As a prins in distress, I apeal to your valler, so renouned in Europe. I am kept out of my own; my royal father, King Gems,'--well, this is the worst spelling I ever saw in my life!  He means King _James_,--'my royal father, King Gems, being druv into exile by a crewl Usurper, the Elector of Hannover.  King Gems is _old_, and likes a quiat life; but I am determined to make an effort, if I go alone, and Europe shall here of Prince Charles.  Having heard--as who has not?--of your royal Highness's courage and sordsmanship, I throw myself at your feet, and implore you to asist a prins in distres.  Let our sords be drawn together in the caus of freedom and an outraged country, my own.  \"'I remain, \"'Prins and dear Cuzen, \"'CHARLES, P. W.'  \"P. W. means Prince of Wales,\" added Jaqueline.  \"He is turned out of England you know, and lives at Rome with his father.\"  \"I like that chap,\" said Prince Ricardo.  \"He does not spell very well, as you say, but I sometimes make mistakes myself; and I like his spirit. I've been looking out for an adventure; but the big game is getting shy, and my sword rusts in his scabbard.  I'll tell you what, Jack--I've an idea!  I'll put him on the throne of his fathers; it's as easy as shelling peas: and as for that other fellow, the Elector, I'll send him back to Hanover, wherever that may be, and he can go on electing, and polling his vote in peace and quietness, at home.  Just wait till I spot the places.\"  The prince ran up to the turret, fetched the magic spy-glass, and looked up London, Rome, and Hanover, as you would in a map.  \"Well, Dick, but how do you mean to do it?\"  \"Do it?--nothing simpler!  I just take my Seven-league Boots, run over to Rome, pick up Prince Charles, put him on the magic carpet, fly to London, clap the Cap of Darkness on him so that nobody can see him, set him down on the throne of his fathers; pick up the Elector, carry him over to his beloved Hanover, and the trick is done--what they call a bloodless revolution in the history books.\"  \"But if the English don't like Prince Charles when they get him?\"  \"Like him? they're sure to like him, a young fellow like that!  Besides, I'll take the sword with me in case of accidents.\"  \"But, Dick, it is your father's rule that you are never to meddle in the affairs of other countries, and never to start on an expedition when he is not at home.\"  \"Oh, he won't mind this time!  There's no kind of danger; and I'm sure he will approve of the _principle_ of the thing.  Kings must stick up for each other.  Why, some electing characters might come here and kick _us_ out!\"  \"Your father is not the sort of king who is kicked out,\" said Jaqueline.  But there was no use in talking to Dick.  He made his simple preparations, and announced that he would be back in time for luncheon.  What was poor Jaqueline to do?  She was extremely anxious.  She knew, as we saw, what King Prigio had intended about changing the fairy things for others that would not work.  She was certain Dick would get himself into a scrape; how was she to help him?  She made up her mind quickly, while Dick was putting his things together.  She told the queen (it was the nearest to the truth she could think of) that she \"was going for a turn with Dick.\"  Then she changed herself into a mosquito--a kind of gnat that bites--and hid herself under a fold of Dick's coat.  Of course he knew nothing about her being there.  Then he started off in his Seven- league Boots, and before you could say \"Jack Robinson\" he was in Rome, in the grounds of a splendid palace called the Villa Borghese.  There he saw an elderly gentleman, in a great curled wig, sound asleep on a seat beneath a tree.  The old gentleman had a long, pale, melancholy face, and across his breast was a broad blue ribbon with a star.  Ah! how changed was King James from the handsome Prince who had loved fair Beatrix Esmond, thirty years ago!  Near him were two boys, not quite so old as Prince Ricardo.  The younger was a pretty dark boy, with a funny little roundabout white wig.  He was splendidly dressed in a light-blue silk coat; a delicate little lace scarf was tied round his neck; he had lace ruffles falling about his little ringed hands; he had a pretty sword, with a gold handle set with diamonds--in fact, he was the picture of a little dandy.  The other lad had a broad Scotch bonnet on, and no wig; beautiful silky yellow locks fell about his shoulders.  He had laid his sword on the grass.  He was dressed in tartan, which Ricardo had never seen before; and he wore a kilt, which was also new to Ricardo, who wondered at his bare legs--for he was wearing shoes with no stockings.  In his hand he held a curious club, with a long, slim handle, and a head made heavy with lead, and defended with horn.  With this he was aiming at a little white ball; and suddenly he swung up the club and sent the ball out of sight in the air, over several trees.  Prince Ricardo stepped up to this boy, took off his cap, and said:  \"I think I have the honour of addressing the Prince of Wales?\"  Prince Charles started at the sight of a gentleman in long riding-boots, girt with a broadsword, which was not then generally worn, and carrying a Persian rug under his arm.  \"That is what I am called, sir,\" he said, \"by those who give me the title which is mine by right.  May I inquire the reason which offers me the pleasure of this unexpected interview?\"  \"Oh, I'm Ricardo of Pantouflia!\" says Dick.  \"I had a letter from you this morning, and I believe you wanted to see me.\"  \"From Pantouflia, sir,\" said Prince Charles; \"why, that is hundreds of leagues away!\"  \"It is a good distance,\" said Dick; \"but a mere step when you wear Seven- league Boots like mine.\"  \"My dear prince,\" said Charles, throwing himself into his arms with rapture, and kissing him in the Italian fashion, which Dick did not half like, \"you are, indeed, worthy of your reputation; and these are the celebrated Seven-league Boots?  Harry,\" he cried to his brother, \"come here at once and let me present you to his Royal Highness, our illustrious ally, Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia.  The Duke of York--Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia.  Gentlemen, know each other!\"  The prince bowed in the most stately manner.  \"I say,\" said Dick, who was seldom at all up to the standard of royal conversation, \"what's that game you were playing?  It's new to me.  You sent the ball a tremendous long shot.\"  \"The game is called golf, and is the favourite pastime of my loyal Scottish subjects,\" said Prince Charles.  \"For that reason, that I may be able to share the amusements of my people, whom I soon hope to lead to a glorious victory, followed by a peaceful and prosperous reign, I am acquiring a difficult art.  I'm practising walking without stockings, too, to harden my feet,\" he said, in a more familiar tone of voice.  \"I fancy there are plenty of long marches before me, and I would not be a spear's length behind the hardiest Highlander.\"  \"By Jove!  I respect you,\" said Dick, with the greatest sincerity; \"but I don't think, with me on your side, you will need to make many marches.  It will all be plain sailing.\"  \"Pray explain your plan,\" said Prince Charles.  \"The task of conquering back the throne of my fathers is not so simple as you seem to suppose.\"  \"I've done a good many difficult things,\" said Dick, modestly.  \"The conqueror of the magician, Gorgonzola, and the Giant Who never Knew when he had Enough, need not tell me that,\" said Prince Charles, with a courteous allusion to two of Ricardo's most prodigious adventures.  \"Oh!  I've very little to be proud of, really,\" said Dick, blushing; \"anyone could do as much with my fairy things, of which, no doubt, you have heard.  With a Sword of Sharpness and a Cap of Darkness, and so forth, you have a great pull over almost anything.\"  \"And you really possess those talismans?\" said the prince.  \"Certainly I do.  You see how short a time I took in coming to your call from Pantouflia.\"  \"And has Holy Church,\" asked the Duke of York, with anxiety, \"given her sanction and her blessing to those instruments of an art, usually, in her wisdom, forbidden?\"  \"Oh, never mind Holy Church, Harry!\""]]]
