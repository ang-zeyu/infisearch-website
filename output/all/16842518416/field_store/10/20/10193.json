But you have only given me your opinion of men as yet; you have still to say what you think of Eda's acknowledged predilection for idleness.\"  \"Well,\" replied Mrs Stanley, \"I think that my sagacious teaching, as you are pleased to call it, has taken pretty firm root already, and that Eda's speech is one of the first bright, beautiful blossoms, from which we may look for much fruit hereafter; for to make one's self and one's fellow-creatures happy, _because such is the will of God_, seems to me a simple and comprehensive way of stating the whole duty of man.\"  Stanley's eyes opened a little at this definition.  \"Hum! _multum in parvo_; it may be so,\" he said; and casting down his eyes, he was soon lost in a profound reverie, while the canoe continued to progress forward by little impulsive bounds, under the rapid stroke of the paddles.  Eda rested her fair cheek on the shaggy brow of Chimo, and accompanied him to the land of nod, until the sun began to sink behind the icebergs on the seaward horizon, where a dark line indicated an approaching breeze.  Massan cast an uneasy glance at this from time to time.  At length he called to his friend in the bow, \"Hello, Prince! will it come stiff; think ye?\"  \"No,\" replied Prince, rising and shading his eyes with his hand; \"it'll be only a puff; but that's enough to drive the ice down on us, an' shut up the open water.\"  \"It's my 'pinion,\" said Massan, \"that we should hold away for the p'int yonder, an' camp there.\"  Dick Prince nodded assent, and resumed his paddle.  As he did so the report of a gun came sharply over the water.  \"Ha!\" exclaimed Stanley, looking out ahead; \"what's that?\"  \"Only Mr Frank,\" said Massan; \"he's dowsed two birds.  I see'd them splash into the water.\"  \"That's right,\" said Stanley; \"we shall have something fresh for the kettle to-night.  And, by the way, we'll need all we can kill, for we haven't much provision to depend on, and part of it must be reserved in case of accidents, so that if Frank does not do his duty, we shall have to live on birch bark, Massan.\"  \"That would be rayther tough.  I'm afeerd,\" replied the steersman, laughing.  \"I've tried the tail o' a deer-skin coat afore now, an' it wasn't much to boast of; but I niver tried a birch-bark steak.  I doubt it would need a power o' chewin?\"  By this time the two large canoes had drawn gradually nearer to the leading one.  As they approached, Frank ordered his men to cease paddling.  \"Well, Frank, what success?\" said Stanley, as they came up.  \"There's our supper,\" cried Frank, tossing a large duck into the canoe; \"and there's a bite for the men,\" he added, sending a huge gray goose into the midst of them.  \"I saw a herd of reindeer on the other side of the point; but the ice closed up the passage, and prevented me from getting within range.  It will stop our further progress for to-night too; so I waited to advise you to camp here.\"  \"There it comes!\" cried Dick Prince.  \"Jump out on the ice, lads, and unload as fast as you can.\"  As Dick spoke he sprang on to a field of ice which was attached to the shore, and drawing the canoe alongside, began hastily to remove the cargo.  His example was instantly followed by the men, who sprang over the gunwales like cats; and in less than five minutes the cargoes were scattered over the ice.  Meanwhile, the breeze which Massan had observed continued to freshen, and the seaward ice bore rapidly down on the shore, gradually narrowing and filling up the lanes of water among which the travellers had been hitherto wending their way.  Dick Prince's sudden action was caused by his observing a large, solid field, which bore down on them with considerable rapidity.  His warning was just in time, for the goods were scarcely landed and the three canoes lifted out of the water, when the ice closed in with a crash that would have ground the frail barks to pieces, and the passage was closed up.  So completely was every trace of water obliterated, that it seemed as though there never had been any there before.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  SHOWS HOW THE PARTY MADE THEMSELVES AT HOME IN THE BUSH--TALK ROUND THE CAMP FIRE--A FLASH OF TEMPER--TURNING IN.  The spot where they were thus suddenly arrested in their progress was a small bay, formed by a low point which jutted from the mainland, and shut out the prospect in advance.  There was little or no wood on the point, except a few stunted willows, which being green and small would not, as La Roche the cook remarked, \"make a fire big enough to roast the wing of a mosquito.\"  There was no help for it, however.  The spot on which Massan had resolved to encamp for the night was three miles on the other side of the point, and as the way was now solid ice instead of water, there was no possibility of getting there until a change of wind should drive the ice off the shore.  Moreover, it was now getting dark, and it behoved them to make their preparations with as much speed as possible.  Accordingly, Massan and Prince shouldered one canoe, Francois and Gaspard carried the other, and the light one was placed on the shoulders of Bryan the blacksmith; La Roche took the provision-basket and cooking utensils under his special charge; while the three Esquimau interpreters and the two Indian guides busied themselves in carrying the miscellaneous goods and baggage into camp.  As for Chimo, he seated himself quietly on a lump of ice, and appeared to superintend the entire proceedings; while his young mistress and her mother, accompanied by Frank and Stanley, crossed the ice to the shore, to select a place for their encampment.  But it was some time ere a suitable place could be found, as the point happened to be low and swampy, and poor Eda's first experience of a life in the woods was stepping into a hole which took her up to the knees in mud and water.  She was not alone, however, in misfortune, for just at the same moment Bryan passed through the bushes with his canoe, and staggered into the same swamp, exclaiming as he did so, in a rich brogue which many years' residence among the French half-breeds of Rupert's Land had failed to soften, \"Thunder an' turf! such a blackguard counthry I niver did see.  Och, Bryan dear, why did ye iver lave yer native land?\"  \"Pourquoi, why, mon boy? for ver' goot raison,\" cried La Roche, in a horrible compound of French and broken English, as he skipped lightly past, with a loud laugh, \"for ver' goot raison--dey was tired of you to home, vraiment.  You was too grande raskale; dey could not keep you no longer.\"  \"Thrue for ye, La Roche,\" replied the blacksmith, \"thrue for ye, boy; they sartinly could not keep me on nothin', an' as the murphies was all sp'iled wi' the rot, I had to lave or starve.\"  At last, after a long search, Frank Morton found a spot pretty well adapted for their purpose.  It was an elevated plot of gravel, which was covered with a thin carpet of herbage, and surrounded by a belt of willows which proved a sufficient shelter against the wind.  A low and rather shaggy willow-tree spread its branches over the spot, and gave to it a good deal of the feeling and appearance of shelter, if not much of the reality.  This was of little consequence, however, as the night proved fine and comparatively mild, so that the black vault of heaven, spangled with hosts of brilliant stars, amply compensated for the want of a leafy canopy.  Under the willow-tree, Frank and La Roche busied themselves in spreading a very small white tent for Mr Stanley and his family.  Frank himself, although entitled from his position in the Company's service to the luxury of a tent, scorned to use one, preferring to rough it like the men, and sleep beneath the shelter of the small canoe.  Meanwhile, Mr Stanley proceeded to strike a light with his flint and steel; and Bryan, having deposited his burden near the tent, soon collected a sufficiency of driftwood to make a good fire.  Edith and her mother were not idle in the midst of this busy scene.  They collected a few bundles of dried twigs to make the fire light more easily, and after the blaze was casting its broad glare of light over the camp, and the tent was pitched, they assisted La Roche in laying the cloth for supper.  Of course, in a journey like this, none but necessary articles were taken, and these were of the most homely character.  The kettle was the tea-pot, the cups were tin pannikins, and the table-cloth was a large towel, while the table itself was the ground, from the damp of which, however, the party in the tent were protected by an ample oil-cloth.  When all the things were carried up, and the men assembled, the camp presented the following appearance: in the centre of the open space, which nature had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21707"],["title","Ungava (#8)"],["body","in the form of a circle, blazed the fire; and a right jovial, sputtering, outrageous fire it was, sending its sparks flying in all directions, like the artillery of a beleaguered fortress in miniature, and rolling its flames about in fierce and wayward tongues, that seemed bent on licking in and swallowing up the entire party, but more especially La Roche, who found no little difficulty in paying due attention to his pots and kettles.  Sometimes the flames roared fiercely upwards, singeing off the foliage of the overhanging willow as they went, and then, bursting away from their parent fire, portions of them floated off for a few seconds on the night air.  On the weather side of this fire stood Mr Stanley's tent, under the willow-tree, as before described, its pure white folds showing strongly against the darkness of the sky beyond.  The doorway, or curtain of the tent, was open, displaying the tea-equipage within, and the smiling countenances of Stanley and his wife, Frank and Eda, who, seated on blankets and shawls around the towel, were preparing to make an assault on the fat duck before mentioned.  This duck had been split open and roasted on a piece of stick before the blaze, and now stood with the stumps of its wings and legs extended, as if demanding urgently to be eaten--a demand which Chimo, who crouched near the doorway, could scarce help complying with.  To the right of the tent was placed the small canoe, bottom up, so as to afford a partial protection to the bedding which Oostesimow was engaged in spreading out for Frank and himself and his comrade Ma-Istequan. Facing this, at the other side of the fire, and on the left of the tent, the largest canoe was turned up in a similar manner, and several of the men were engaged in covering the ground beneath it with a layer of leaves and branches, above which they spread their blankets; while others lounged around the fire and smoked their beloved pipes, or watched with impatient eyes the operations of Bryan, who, being accustomed to have familiar dealings with the fire, had been deemed worthy of holding the office of cook to the men, and was inducted accordingly.  It is due to Bryan to say that he fully merited the honour conferred upon him; for never, since the days of Vulcan, was there a man seen who could daringly dabble in the fire as he did.  He had a peculiar sleight-of-hand way of seizing hold of and tossing about red-hot coals with his naked hand, that induced one to believe he must be made of leather.  Flames seemed to have no effect whatever on his sinewy arms when they licked around them; and as for smoke, he treated it with benign contempt.  Not so La Roche: with the mercurial temperament of his class he leaped about the fire, during his culinary operations, in a way that afforded infinite amusement to his comrades, and not unfrequently brought him into violent collision with Bryan, who usually received him on such occasions with a strong Irish growl, mingled with a disparaging or contemptuous remark.  Beyond the circle of light thrown by the fire was the belt of willows which encompassed the camp on all sides except towards the sea, where a narrow gap formed a natural entrance and afforded a glimpse of the ocean with its fields and hummocks of ice floating on its calm bosom and glancing in the faint light of the moon, which was then in its first quarter.  \"How comfortable and snug everything is!\" said Mrs Stanley, as she poured out the tea, while her husband carved the duck.  \"Yes, isn't it, Eda?\" said Frank, patting his favourite on the head, as he held out her plate for a wing.  \"There, give her a bit of the breast too,\" he added.  \"I know she's ravenously hungry, for I saw her looking at Chimo, just before we landed, as if she meant to eat him for supper without waiting to have him cooked.\"  \"O Frank, how can you be so wicked?\" said Eda, taking up her knife and fork and attacking the wing with so much energy as almost to justify her friend's assertion.  \"Snug, said you, Jessie? yes, that's the very word to express it,\" said Stanley.  \"There's no situation that I know of (and I wasn't born yesterday) that is so perfectly snug, and in all respects comfortable, as an encampment in the woods on a fine night in spring or autumn.\"  \"Or winter,\" added Frank, swallowing a pannikin of tea at a draught, nodding to Chimo, as much as to say, \"Do that if you can, old fellow,\" and handing it to Mrs Stanley to be replenished.  \"Don't omit winter-- cold, sharp, sunny winter.  An encampment in the snow, in fine weather, is as snug as this.\"  \"Rather cold, is it not?\" said Mrs Stanley.  \"Cold! not a bit,\" replied Frank, making a reckless dive with his hand into the biscuit-bag; \"if you have enough wood to get up a roaring fire, six feet long by three broad and four deep, with a bank of snow five feet high all around ye, a pine-tree with lots of thick branches spreading overhead to keep off the snow, and two big green blankets to keep out the frost--(another leg of that widgeon, please)--you've no notion how snug it is, I assure you.\"  \"Hum!\" ejaculated Stanley, with a dubious smile, \"you forgot to add--a youthful, robust frame, with the blood careering through the veins like wildfire, to your catalogue of requisites.  No doubt it is pleasant enough in its way; but commend me to spring or autumn for thorough enjoyment, when the air is mild, and the waters flowing, and the woods green and beautiful.\"  \"Why don't you speak of summer, papa?\" said Eda, who had been listening intently to this conversation.  \"Summer, my pet! because--\"  \"Allow me to explain,\" interrupted Frank, laying down his knife and fork, and placing the forefinger of his right hand in his left palm, as if he were about to make a speech.  \"Because, Eda, because there is such a thing as heat--long-continued, never-ending, sweltering heat.  Because there are such reprehensible and unutterably detestable insects as mosquitoes, and sand-flies, and bull-dogs; and there is such a thing as being bitten, and stung, and worried, and sucked into a sort of partial madness; and I have seen such sights as men perpetually slapping their own faces, and scratching the skin off their own cheeks with their own nails, and getting no relief thereby, but rather making things worse; and I have, moreover, seen men's heads swelled until the eyes and noses were lost, and the mouths only visible when opened, and their general aspect like that of a Scotch haggis; and there is a time when all this accumulates on man and beast till the latter takes to the water in desperation, and the former takes to intermittent insanity, and that time is--_summer_.--Another cup, please, Mrs Stanley.  'Pon my conscience, it creates thirst to think of it.\"  At this stage the conversation of the party in the tent was interrupted by a loud peal of laughter mingled with not a few angry exclamations from the men.  La Roche, in one of his frantic leaps to avoid a tongue of flame which shot out from the fire with a vicious velocity towards his eyes, came into violent contact with Bryan while that worthy was in the act of lifting a seething kettle of soup and boiled pork from the fire.  Fortunately for the party whose supper was thus placed in jeopardy, Bryan stood his ground; but La Roche, tripping over a log, fell heavily among the pannikins, tin plates, spoons, and knives, which had been just laid out on the ground in front of the canoe.  \"Ach! mauvais chien,\" growled Gaspard, as he picked up and threw away the fragments of his pipe, \"you're always cuttin' and jumpin' about like a monkey.\"  \"Oh! pauvre crapaud,\" cried Francois, laughing; \"don't abuse him, Gaspard.  He's a useful dog in his way.\"  \"Tare an' ages! you've done it now, ye have.  Bad luck to ye! wasn't I for iver tellin' ye that same.  Shure, if it wasn't that ye're no bigger or heavier than a wisp o' pea straw, ye'd have druve me and the soup into the fire, ye would.  Be the big toe o' St. Patrick, not to mintion his riverince the Pope--\"  \"Come, come, Bryan,\" cried Massan, \"don't speak ill o' the Pope, an' down wi' the kettle.\"  \"The kittle, is it?  Sorra a kittle ye'll touch, Massan, till it's cool enough to let us all start fair at wance.  Ye've got yer mouth and throat lined wi' brass, I believe, an' would ate the half o't before a soul of us could taste it!\"  \"Don't insult me, you red-faced racoon,\" retorted Massan, while he and his comrades circled round the kettle, and began a vigorous attack on the scalding mess; \"my throat is not so used to swallowin' fire as your own.  I never knowed a man that payed into the grub as you do.--Bah! how hot it is.--I say, Oolibuck, doesn't it remember you o' the dogs o' yer own country, when they gits the stone kettle to clean out?\"  Oolibuck's broad visage expanded with a chuckle as he lifted an enormous wooden spoonful of soup to his ample mouth.  \"Me tink de dogs of de Innuit [Esquimaux] make short work of dis kettle if 'e had 'im.\"  \"Do the dogs of the Huskies eat with their masters?\" inquired Francois, as he groped in the kettle with his fork in search of a piece of pork.  \"Dey not eat _wid_ der masters, but dey al'ays clean hout de kettle,\" replied Moses, somewhat indignantly.  \"Ha!\" exclaimed Massan, pausing for a few minutes to recover breath; \"yes, they always let the dogs finish off the feast.  Ye must know, comrades, that I've seed them do it myself--anyways I've seed a man that knew a feller who said he had a comrade that wintered once with the Huskies, which is pretty much the same thing.  An' he said that sometimes when they kill a big seal, they boil it whole an' have a rig'lar feast.  Ye must understand, mes garcons, that the Huskies make thumpin' big kettles out o' a kind o' soft stone they find in them parts, an' some o' them's big enough to boil a whole seal in.
