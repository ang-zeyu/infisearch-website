So much has been ascertained by scientific investigation of the winds, that we can now distinctly map out the great belts or currents which pass right round the world.  We can tell in which parallels winds with easting, and in which those with westing, in them, will be most frequently found; and by directing our course to such places, we can to a certain extent count upon profiting by the winds that will be most suitable.  Before the facts of atmospheric circulation were known, mariners sailed by chance.  If they happened to get into the belt of wind that suited them, their voyages were favourable; if they got into the wrong region, their voyages were unfavourable,--that was all.  But they had no idea that there was any possibility of turning the tables, and, by a careful investigation of the works of the Creator, coming at last to such knowledge as would enable them to reduce winds and waves, in a great degree, to a state of slavery, instead of themselves being at their mercy.  The world may be said to be encircled by a succession of belts of wind, which blow not always in the same direction, but almost invariably with the same routine of variations.  A vessel sailing from north to south encounters these belts in succession.  To mariners of old, these varying winds seemed to blow in utter confusion.  To men of the present time, their varied action is counted on with some degree of certainty.  The reason why men were so long in discovering the nature of atmospheric circulation was, that they were not sufficiently alive to the immense value of united effort.  They learned wisdom chiefly from personal experience--each man for himself; and in the great majority of cases, stores of knowledge, that would have been of the utmost importance to mankind, were buried with the individuals who had laid them up. Moreover, the life of an individual was too short, and his experience too limited, to enable him to discover any of the grand laws of Nature; and as there was no gathering together of information from all quarters, and all sorts of men, and all seasons (as there is now), the knowledge acquired by individuals was almost always lost to the world.  Thus men were ever learning, but never arriving at a knowledge of the truth.  May we not here remark, that this evil was owing to another evil-- namely, man's ignorance of, or indifference to, the duty of what we may term human communication?  As surely as gravitation is an appointed law of God, so surely is it an appointed duty that men shall communicate their individual knowledge to each other, in order that the general knowledge of the species may advance and just in proportion to the fidelity with which men obey this duty--the care and ability with which they collate and systematise and investigate their knowledge--will be the result of their efforts.  In order to make the above remarks more clear as regards atmospheric phenomena, let us suppose the case of a sailor who makes the same voyage every year, but not precisely at the same time each year (and it must be remembered that the rigid punctuality at starting which now holds good did not exist in former times).  In his first voyage he had to cross, say, four of the wind-belts.  While crossing belt number one, he experiences south-west winds chiefly, and, being an observant man, notes the fact.  In belt number two he encounters westerly winds.  In number three he is in a region of variable winds and calms.  In this region the winds blow all round the compass, averaging about three months from each quarter.  But our sailor does not know that; he does not stay there all the year to make notes; he passes on, having recorded his experience. In crossing belt number four, he finds the prevailing winds to be easterly.  Next year he sets forth again but merchants are not always punctual. The lading cannot be completed in time, or adverse winds render the setting sail unadvisable.  At length, after a month or six weeks' delay, he proceeds on his voyage, and finds belt number one perhaps much the same as last year.  He congratulates himself on his good fortune, and notes his observations; but in belt number two, the wind is somewhat modified, owing to its being later in the season,--it is rather against him.  In number three it is right in his teeth, whereas last year it was quite in his favour.  In number four, which we will suppose is the trade-wind belt (of which more hereafter), he finds the wind still easterly.  Here, then, is the groundwork of confusion in our sailor's mind.  He has not the remotest idea that in belt number one the wind blows chiefly, but not always, in one particular direction; that in number four it blows invariably in one way; and that in number three it is regularly irregular.  In fact, he does not know that such belts exist at all, and his opportunities of observing are not sufficiently frequent or prolonged to enable him to ascertain anything with certainty.  Now, when we remember that in this imperfect experience of his he is still further misled by his frequently encountering _local_ vicissitudes--such as storms and calms resulting from local and temporary causes--we see how confusion becomes worse confounded.  No doubt he does gather some few crumbs of knowledge; but he is called on, perhaps, to change his scene of action.  Another ship is given to him, another route entered on, and he ceases altogether to prosecute his inquiries in the old region.  Or old age comes on; and even although he may have been beginning to have a few faint glimmerings as to laws and systems in his mind, he has not the power to make much of these.  He dies; his knowledge is, to a very large extent, lost, and his log-books disappear, as all such books do, nobody knows or cares where.  Now this state of things has been changing during the last few years. Log-books are collected in thousands.  The experiences of many men, in reference to the same spots in the same years, months, and even hours, are gathered, collated, and compared; and the result is, that although there are conflicting elements and contradictory appearances, order has been discovered in the midst of apparent confusion, and scientific men have been enabled to pierce through the chaos of littlenesses by which the world's vision has been hitherto obscured, and to lay bare many of those grand progressions of nature which move unvaryingly with stately step through space and time, as the river, with all its minor eddies and counter-currents, flows with unvarying regularity to the ocean.

Before proceeding to speak of the power and the dreadful effects of wind, it is necessary to say a word or two about the trade-winds.  It is supposed that the \"trades\" derived their name from the fact of their being favourable to navigation, and, therefore, to trade.  They consist of two belts of wind, one on each side of the equator, which blow always in the same direction.  In the last chapter it was explained that the heated atmosphere at the equator rises, and that the cooler atmosphere from the poles rushes in to supply its place.  That which rushes from the south pole is, of course, a south wind, that from the north pole a north wind; but, owing to the Earth's motion on its axis from west to east, the one becomes a north-east, the other a south-east wind.  These are the north-east and the South-east \"trades.\"  They blow regularly--sometimes gently, sometimes fiercely--all the year round.  Between the two is a belt of calms and changeable breezes, varying from 150 to 500 miles broad-- according to the time of the year--where there are frequent and violent squalls, of very short duration, accompanied with heavy rains.  This region is called by seamen the \"doldrums,\" and considerable trouble and difficulty do ships experience in crossing it.  It has already been explained that about latitude 30 degrees, the upper current of wind from the south descends.  At the same point the upper current from the north also descends.  They cut through each other, and the point where these two cut each other is the northern limit of the north-east trade-winds.  The same explanation holds in regard to the southern limit of the south-east trades.  In the accompanying diagram the arrows within the circle point out the direction of the north-east and the south-east \"trades\" between the tropics of cancer and capricorn, and also the counter currents to the north and south of these, while the arrows around the circle show how counter currents meet and rise, or descend, and produce the calm belts.  We have hitherto enlarged chiefly on the grand currents of the atmosphere, and on those modifying causes and effects which are perpetual.  Let us now turn to the consideration of those winds which are produced by local causes, and the effects of which are partial.  And here we are induced to revert to the Gulf Stream, which has been already referred to as a _local_ disturber of the regular flow of the atmosphere.  This immense body of heated water, passing through cold regions of the sea, has the effect of causing the most violent storms. The hurricanes of the West Indies are among the most violent in the world.  We have read of one so violent that it \"forced the Gulf Stream back to its sources, and piled up the water in the Gulf to the height of thirty feet.  A vessel named the _Ledbnry Snow_ attempted to ride it out.  When it abated, she found herself high up on the dry land, having let go her anchor among the tree-tops of Elliott's quay!  The Florida quays were inundated many feet; and it is said the scene presented in the Gulf Stream was never surpassed in awful"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21756"],["title","Philosopher Jack (#0)"],["body","JACK, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  TREATS OF OUR HERO AND OTHERS.  If the entire circuit of a friend's conversation were comprised in the words \"Don't\" and \"Do,\"--it might perhaps be taken for granted that his advice was not of much value; nevertheless, it is a fact that Philosopher Jack's most intimate and valuable--if not valued--friend never said anything to him beyond these two words.  Nor did he ever condescend to reason.  He listened, however, with unwearied patience to reasoning, but when Jack had finished reasoning and had stated his proposed course of action, he merely said to him, \"Don't,\" or \"Do.\"  \"For what end was I created?\" said the philosopher, gloomily.  Wise and momentous question when seriously put, but foolish remark, if not worse, when flung out in bitterness of soul!  Jack, whose other name was Edwin, and his age nineteen, was a student. Being of an argumentative turn of mind, his college companions had dubbed him Philosopher.  Tall, strong, active, kindly, hilarious, earnest, reckless, and impulsive, he was a strange compound, with a handsome face, a brown fluff on either cheek, and a moustache like a lady's eyebrow.  Moreover, he was a general favourite, yet this favoured youth, sitting at his table in his own room, sternly repeated the question--in varied form and with increased bitterness--\"Why was I born at all?\"  Deep wrinkles of perplexity sat on his youthful brow.  Evidently he could not answer his own question, though in early life his father had carefully taught him the \"Shorter Catechism with proofs,\" while his good old mother had enforced and exemplified the same.  His taciturn friend was equally unable, or unwilling, to give a reply.  After prolonged meditation, Jack relieved his breast of a deep sigh and re-read a letter which lay open on his desk.  Having read it a third time with knitted brows, he rose, went to the window, and gazed pathetically on the cat's parade, as he styled his prospect of slates and chimney cans.  \"So,\" said he at last, \"my dreams are over; prospects gone; hopes collapsed--all vanished like the baseless fabric of a vision.\"  He turned from the cat's parade, on which the shades of evening were descending, to the less romantic contemplation of his empty fire-grate.  \"Now,\" said he, re-seating himself at his table and stretching his long legs under it, \"the question is, What am I to do? shall I kick at fate, throw care, like physic, to the dogs, cut the whole concern, and go to sea?\"  \"Don't,\" said his taciturn friend, speaking distinctly for the first time.  \"Or,\" continued Jack, \"shall I meekly bow to circumstances, and struggle with my difficulties as best I may?\"  \"Do,\" replied his friend, whose name, by the way, was Conscience.  For a long time the student sat gazing at the open letter in silence. It was from his father, and ran thus:--    \"Dear Teddie,--It's a long time now that I've been thinkin' to write   you, and couldn't a-bear to give you such a heavy disappointment but   can't putt it off no longer, and, as your mother, poor soul, says,   it's the Lord's will and can't be helped--which, of course, it   shouldn't be helped if that's true--but--well, howsomever, it's of no   use beatin' about the bush no longer.  The seasons have been bad for   some years past, and it's all I've been able to do to make the two   ends meet, with your mother slavin' like a nigger patchin' up the   child'n's old rags till they're like Joseph's coat after the wild   beast had done its worst on it--though we _are_ given to understand   that the only wild beasts as had to do with that coat was Joseph's own   brothers.  Almost since ever I left the North of England--a small   boy--and began to herd cattle on the Border hills, I've had a strange   wish to be a learned man, and ever since I took to small farmin', and   perceived that such was not to be my lot in life, I've had a powerful   desire to see my eldest son--that's you, dear boy--trained in   scientific pursoots, all the more that you seemed to have a natural   thirst that way yourself.  Your mother, good soul, in her own broad   tongue--which I've picked up somethin' of myself through livin' twenty   year with her--was used to say she `wad raither see her laddie trained   in ways o' wisdom than o' book-learnin',' which I'm agreed to myself,   though it seems to me the two are more or less mixed up.  Howsomever,   it's all up now, my boy; you'll have to fight your own battle and pay   your own way, for I've not got one shillin' to rub on another, except   what'll pay the rent; and, what with the grey mare breakin' her leg   an' the turnips failin', the look-out ahead is darkish at the best.\"  The letter finished with some good advice and a blessing.  To be left thus without resources, just when the golden gates of knowledge were opening, and a few dazzling gleams of the glory had pierced his soul, was a crushing blow to the poor student.  If he had been a true philosopher, he would have sought counsel on his knees, but his philosophy was limited; he only took counsel with himself and the immediate results were disastrous.  \"Yes,\" said he, with an impulsive gush, \"I'll go to sea.\"  \"Don't,\" said his quiet friend.  But, regardless of this advice, Edwin Jack smote the table with his clenched fist so violently that his pen leapt out of its ink-bottle and wrote its own signature on one of his books.  He rose in haste and rang the bell.  \"Mrs Niven,\" he said to his landlady, \"let me know how much I owe you. I'm about to leave town--and--and won't return.\"  \"Ech!  Maister Jack; what for?\" exclaimed the astonished landlady.  \"Because I'm a beggar,\" replied the youth, with a bitter smile, \"and I mean to go to sea.\"  \"Hoots!  Maister Jack, ye're jokin'.\"  \"Indeed I am very far from joking, Mrs Niven; I have no money, and no source of income.  As I don't suppose you would give me board and lodging for nothing, I mean to leave.\"  \"Toots! ye're haverin',\" persisted Mrs Niven, who was wont to treat her \"young men\" with motherly familiarity.  \"Tak' time to think o't, an' ye'll be in anither mind the morn's mornin'.  Nae doot ye're--\"  \"Now, my good woman,\" interrupted Jack, firmly but kindly, \"don't bother me with objections or advice, but do what I bid you--there's a good soul; be off.\"  Mrs Niven saw that she had no chance of impressing her lodger in his present mood; she therefore retired, while Jack put on a rough pilot-cloth coat and round straw hat in which he was wont at times to go boating.  Thus clad, he went off to the docks of the city in which he dwelt; the name of which city it is not important that the reader should know.  In a humble abode near the said docks a bulky sea-captain lay stretched in his hammock, growling.  The prevailing odours of the neighbourhood were tar, oil, fish, and marine-stores.  The sea-captain's room partook largely of the same odours, and was crowded with more than an average share of the stores.  It was a particularly small room, with charts, telescopes, speaking-trumpets, log-lines, sextants, portraits of ships, sou'-westers, oil-cloth coats and leggings on the walls; model ships suspended from the beams overhead; sea-boots, coils of rope, kegs, and handspikes on the floor; and great shells, earthenware ornaments, pagodas, and Chinese idols on the mantel-piece.  In one corner stood a child's crib.  The hammock swung across the room like a heavy cloud about to descend and overwhelm the whole.  This simile was further borne out by the dense volumes of tobacco smoke in which the captain enveloped himself, and through which his red visage loomed over the edge of the hammock like a lurid setting sun.  For a few minutes the clouds continued to multiply and thicken.  No sound broke the calm that prevailed, save a stertorous breathing, with an occasional hitch in it.  Suddenly there was a convulsion in the clouds, and one of the hitches developed into a tremendous cough.  There was something almost awe-inspiring in the cough.  The captain was a huge and rugged man.  His cough was a terrible compound of a choke, a gasp, a rend, and a roar.  Only lungs of sole-leather could have weathered it. Each paroxysm suggested the idea that the man's vitals were being torn asunder; but not content with that, the exasperated mariner made matters worse by keeping up a continual growl of indignant remonstrance in a thunderous undertone.  \"Hah! that _was_ a splitter.  A few more hug--sh! ha! like that will burst the biler entirety.  Polly--hallo!\"  The lurid sun appeared to listen for a moment, then opening its mouth it shouted, \"Polly--ahoy!\" as if it were hailing the maintop of a seventy-four.  Immediately there was a slight movement in one corner of the room, and straightway from out a mass of marine-stores there emerged a fairy!  At least, the little girl, of twelve or thereabouts, who suddenly appeared, with rich brown tumbling hair, pretty blue eyes, faultless figure, and ineffable sweetness in every lineament of her little face, might easily have passed for a fairy or an angel.  \"What! caught you napping?\" growled the captain in the midst of a paroxysm.  \"Only a minute, father; I couldn't help it,\" replied Polly, with a little laugh, as she ran to the fireplace and took up a saucepan that simmered there.  \"Here, look alive! shove along! hand it up!  I'm chokin'!\"  The child held the saucepan as high as she could towards the hammock. The captain, reaching down one of his great arms, caught it and took a steaming draught.  It seemed to relieve him greatly.  \"You're a trump for gruel, Polly,\" he growled, returning the saucepan. \"Now then, up with the pyramid, and give us a nor'-wester.\"  The child returned the saucepan to the fireplace, and then actively placed a chair nearly underneath the hammock.  Upon the chair she set a stool, and on the top she perched herself.  Thus she was enabled to grasp the lurid sun by two enormous whiskers, and, putting her lips out, gave it a"]]]
