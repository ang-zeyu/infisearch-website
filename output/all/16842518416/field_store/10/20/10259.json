They are suitable for evening services.  After this time there followed in England, in the wake of Handel, a degradation of style which is now completely discredited. Diatonic flow, with tediously orthodox modulation, overburdened with conventional graces, describe these innumerable and indistinguishable productions. And just as the old tunes were related to the motets and madrigals, so are these to the verse-anthems and glees of their time. These weak ditties, in the admired manner of Lord Mornington, were typically performed by the genteel pupils of the local musician, who, gathered round him beneath the laughing cherubs of the organ case, warbled by abundant candlelight to their respectful audience with a graceful execution that rivalled the weekday performances of _Celia's Arbour_ and the _Spotted Snakes_. Good tunes may be written at any time, for style is independent of fashion; but there are very few exceptions to the complete and unregretted disappearance of all the tunes of this date.  We have then nothing left for us to do but to review the material which the revival of music in the last fifty years has given us in the way of hymns.  This last group divides naturally into two main heads; first the restoration of old hymns of all kinds, with their plain, severer manner, in reaction against the abused graces; and secondly the appearance of a vast quantity of new hymns.  Concerning the restoration of the old hymns, we cannot be too grateful to those who pointed the right way, and, according to their knowledge and the opportunities of the taste of their day, did the best that they could. But, as our remarks under the heads of Plain-song and Reformation hymns will show, this knowledge, taste, and opportunity were insufficient, and all their work requires to be done afresh.  We are therefore left to the examination of the modern hymns. In place of this somewhat invidious task, I propose to make a few remarks on the general question of the introduction of modern harmony into ecclesiastical music, with reference of course to hymns only. It cannot escape the attention of any one that the modern church music has for one chief differentiation the profuse employment of pathetic chords, the effect of which is often disastrous to the feelings.  Comparing a modern hymn-tune in this style with some fine setting of an old tune in the diatonic ecclesiastical manner, one might attribute the superiority of the old music entirely to its harmonic system; but I think this would be wrong.  It is a characteristic of all early art to be _impersonal_[19]. As long as an art is growing, artists are engaged in rivalry to develop the new inventions in a scientific manner, and individual personality is not called out. With the exhaustion of the means in the attainment of perfection a new stage is reached, in which individual expression is prominent, and seems to take the place of the scientific impersonal interest which aimed at nothing but beauty: so that the chief distinction between early and late art is that the former is impersonal, the latter personal.  Turning now to the subject of ecclesiastical music, and comparing thus Palestrina with Beethoven or Mozart, is it not at once apparent that Palestrina has this distinct advantage, namely, that he seems not to interfere at all with, or add anything to, the sacred words? His early musical art is impersonal, what the musicians call 'pure music'; and if he is setting the phrases of the Liturgy or Holy Scriptures, we are not aware of any adjunct; it seems rather as if the sacred words had suddenly become musical. Not so with Mozart or Beethoven; we may prefer their music, but it has interfered with the sacred words, it has, in fact, added a personality.  It must of course be conceded that this gives a very strong if not logically an almost unassailable position to those who would confine sacred music to the ecclesiastical style. But it seems to me ridiculous to suppose that genius cannot use all good means with reserve and dignity; and if the modern church music will not stand comparison in respect of dignity and solemnity with the old, the fault must rather lie in the manner in which the new means are used, than in the means themselves; nor would I myself concede that there is no place in church for music which is tinged with a human personality; I should be rather inclined to reckon the great musicians among the prophets, and to sympathize with any one who might prefer the personality of Beethoven (as revealed in his works) to that of a good many canonized seers. What is logical is that we should be careful as to what personality we admit, and see that the modern means are used with reserve.  Now if we examine our modern hymn-tunes, do we find any sign of that reserve of means which we should expect of genius, or any style which we could attribute to the personality of a genius? Let any one in doubt try the following experiment: copy out some 'favourite tune' in the 'admired manner' of the present day, and show it to some musician who may happen not to know it, and ask him if it is not by Brahms; then see how he will receive any further remarks that you may make to him on the subject of music.  These new tunes are in fact, for the most part, the indistinguishable products of a school given over to certain mannerisms, and might be produced _ad libitum_, as indeed they are; just as were the tunes of the Lord Mornington school before described: and though the composers and compilers of these modern tunes would be the first to deride the exploded fashion, their own fashion is more foolish, and promises to be as fugitive[20].  I have said very little in this essay on the words of hymns. I will venture to add one or two judgements here. _First_, that in the Plain-song period, words and music seem pretty equal and well matched. _Secondly_, that in the Reformation period, and for some time onwards, the musicians did far better than the sacred poets, and have left us a remainder of admirable music, for which it is our duty to find words. _Thirdly_, that the excuse which some musicians have offered for the sentimentality of their modern tunes, namely, that the words are so sentimental, is not without point as a criticism of modern hymn-words, but is of no value whatever as a defence of their practice. The interpretative power of music is exceedingly great, and can force almost any words (as far as their sentiment is concerned) into a good channel.  And if music be introduced at all into public worship it must be most jealously and scrupulously guarded. It is a confusion of thought to suppose that because--as St. Augustin would tell us--it is not a vital matter to religion whether it employ music or not, therefore it can be of little consequence what sort of music is used: and the attitude of indifference towards it, which has seemed to me to be almost a point of correct ecclesiastical manners, must be the expression of a convinced despair, which, in the present state of things, need not surprise. Devout persons are naturally afraid of secular ideals, and shrink from the notion of art intruding into the sanctuary; and, especially if they have never learned music, they will share St. Augustin's jealousy of it; and it is the more difficult to remove their objections, when what they are innocently suffering in the name of art curdles the artist's blood with horror, and keeps him away from church. The artist too, to whom we might look for help, is the _rara avis in terris_, and, in regard to his sympathy with the clergy, would often be thought by them to deserve the rest of the hexameter; but it is really to his credit that he is loth to meddle with church music. Its social vexations, its eye to the market, its truckling to vulgar taste and ready subservience to a dominant fashion, which can never (except under the rarest combination of circumstances) be good;--all this is more than enough to hold him off. Where then is the appeal? _Quis custodiet_?  The unwillingness of the clergy[21] to know anything about music might be got over if the music could be set on a proper basis; and in the present lack of authority and avowed principles, it would be well if such of our cathedral precentors and organists as have the matter at heart would consult and work together with the purpose of instructing pastors and people by the exhibition of what is good. This is what we might expect of our religious musical foundations, which are justifying the standing condemnation of utilitarian economists so long as the stipendiaries are content indolently to follow the fortuitous traditions of the books that lie in the choir, supplemented by the penny-a-sheet music of the common shops. In the Universities, too, it should be impossible for an undergraduate not to gain acquaintance with good ecclesiastical music, and this is not ensured by an occasional rare performance of half a dozen old masterpieces which are preserved in heartless compliment to antiquity. It is to such bodies that we must first look for help and guidance to give our church music artistic importance: for let no one think that the church can put the artistic question on one side. There is no escape from art; art is only the best that man can do, and his second, third, fourth or fifth best are only worse efforts in the same direction, and in proportion as they fall short of the best the more plainly betray their artificiality. To refuse the best for the sake of something inferior of the same kind can never be a policy; it is rather an uncorrected bad habit, that can only be excused by ignorance; and ignorance on the question of music is every day becoming less excusable; and the growing interest and intelligence which all classes are now showing should force on religion a better appreciation of her most potent ally. Music being the universal expression of the mysterious and supernatural, the best that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21722"],["title","A Practical Discourse on Some Principles of Hymn-Singing (#5)"],["body","has ever attained to, is capable of uniting in common devotion minds that are only separated by creeds, and it comforts our hope with a brighter promise of unity than any logic offers. And if we consider and ask ourselves what sort of music we should wish to hear on entering a church, we should surely, in describing our ideal, say first of all that it must be something different from what is heard elsewhere; that it should be a sacred music, devoted to its purpose, a music whose peace should still passion, whose dignity should strengthen our faith, whose unquestioned beauty should find a home in our hearts, to cheer us in life and death; a music worthy of the fair temples in which we meet, and of the holy words of our liturgy; a music whose expression of the mystery of things unseen never allowed any trifling motive to ruffle the sanctity of its reserve. What power for good such a music would have!  Now such a music our Church has got, and does not use; we are content to have our hymn-manuals stuffed with the sort of music which, merging the distinction between sacred and profane, seems designed to make the worldly man feel at home, rather than to reveal to him something of the life beyond his knowledge; compositions full of cheap emotional effects and bad experiments made to be cast aside, the works of the purveyors of marketable fashion, always pleased with themselves, and always to be derided by the succeeding generation.   Example is better than precept; and my own venture as a compiler of a hymn-book has made it possible for me to say much that otherwise I should not have said. In _The Yattendon Hymnal_, printed by Mr. Horace Hart at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, and to be had of Mr. Frowde, price 20_s._, will be found a hundred hymns with their music, chosen for a village choir. The music in this book will show what sort of a hymnal might be made on my principles, while the notes at the end of the volume will illustrate almost every point in this essay which requires illustration, besides many others. As a complement to this essay and for advertisement of the Hymnal I here give the prefaces of that book, which are as follows:--   [1]_Confess._ ix. 6.  [2]_Ibid._ ix. 7.  [3]This is perhaps rather a quality proper to the sensation.  [4]'Et vix eis praebeo congruentem [locum].' which might only mean 'I   cannot find the right place for them.'  [5]_Confess._ x. 13.  [6]St. Augustin does not allow that a vague emotion can be religious; it   must be directed. Few would agree to this.  [7]I assume 'favourite hymn' to mean a sung hymn. The interest of the   record must lie in its being of a heightened emotion of the same kind   as that described by St. Augustin in his own case, _What tears I shed_,   &c.  [8]It was not an uncommon practice on the Continent (say from 1540 to   1840), to print books of hymns to be sung to the current secular airs;   and the names or first lines of these airs were set above the   hymn-words as the musical direction. M. Douen, in his _Clément Marot et   le Psautier Huguenot_, vol. i, ch. 22, has given an account of some of   these books; and any one who wishes to follow this branch of the   subject may read his chapter. He does not notice the later Italian   _Laude Spirituali_, which might have supplied incredible monsters to   his museum.  [9]Besides, the main fault of these books, from which we should have to   quote, is the _association_ of the music, and this is really an   accident, the question before us being the _character_ of the music; so   that we should require musical illustration, for though the common   distinction between sacred and secular music is in the main just, yet   the line cannot be drawn at the original intention, or historical   origin of the music: the true differentiation lies in the character of   the music, the associated sentiment being liable to change. If we were   to banish from our hymn-books all the tunes which we know to have a   secular origin, we should have to part with some of the most sacred and   solemn compositions; and where would the purist obtain any assurance   that the tunes which he retained had a better title? In the sixteenth   century, when so many fine hymn-melodies were written, a musician was   working in the approved manner if he adapted a secular melody, or at   least borrowed a well-known opening phrase: and since the melodies of   that time were composed mainly in conjunct movement, such initial   similarities were unavoidable; for one may safely say that it very soon   became impossible, under such restrictions, to invent a good opening   phrase which had not been used before. The secular airs, too, of that   time were often as fit for sacred as profane use; and if I had to find   a worthy melody for a good new hymn, I should seek more hopefully among   them than in the sacred music of our own century.  [10]I may give the following experience without offence. When I was an   undergraduate there was a song from a comic opera by Offenbach so much   in favour as to be _de rigueur_ at festive meetings. Now there was at   the same time a counterpart of this song popular at evensong in the   churches: it was sung to 'Hark, hark, my soul.' I believe it is called   _L'encens des fleurs_. They seemed to me both equally nauseating: it   was certainly an accident that determined which should be sung at   worship and which at wine.  [11]_The Art of Music_, by C Hubert H. Parry. London, 1893, 1st edit. p.   48.  [12]And give Croft the advantage of his original rhythm, not the   mis-statement in _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, No. 414.  [13]It would be very damaging to my desire to convince, if I should seem   to deny that the mistaken practice of these hymn-book compilers was   based on the solid ground of secular common-sense. If anything is true   of rhythm it is this, that the common mind likes common rhythms, such   as the march or waltz, whereas elaboration of rhythm appeals to a   trained mind or artistic faculty. I should say that the popularity of   common rhythms is due to the shortness of human life, and that if men   were to live to be 300 years old they would weary of the sort of music   which Robert Browning describes so well--      'There 's no keeping one's haunches still,     There 's no such pleasure in life.'    But hymn-melodies must not be put on that level. It is desirable to   have in church something different from what goes on outside, and (as I   say in the text) a hymn-tune need not appeal to the lowest   understanding on first hearing. The simple free rhythms, too, are   perfectly natural; they were free-born.  [14]I need only instance Orlando Gibbons' tune called 'Angels.' The   original is a most ingenious combination of rhythms; and its masterly   beauty could not be guessed from the inane form into which it is   degraded in _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, No. 8.  [15]I omit, for want of space, mention of the late Plain-song melodies   (which would give a good many excellent tunes); and, for want of   knowledge, the Italian tunes.  [16]Comparing the English with the French Genevan Psalter, I do not think   my judgement is too severe on our own. It had a few fine tunes original   to it; best of all the cxxxvii (degraded in _Hymns Ancient and   Modern_). This is of such exceptional beauty that I believe it must   have been written by Bourgeois for Whittingham. Next perhaps is lxxvii   (called 81st in _H. A. M._), the original of which, in Day, 1566, is a   fine tune, degraded already in Este, 1592, which version _H. A. M._   follows: it is said to have come from Geneva. Besides these, xxv and   xliv, which are the only other tunes from this source in _H. A. M._,   are very favourable examples, and I do not think that they will rescue   the book. Nor can I believe that these old English D.C.M. tunes were   ever much used. They are too much alike for many of them to have been   committed to memory, while all the editions which I happen to have seen   are full of misprints, and the four-line tunes which drove them out   were early in the field, and increased rapidly.  [17]When one turns the pages of that most depressing of all books ever   compiled by the groaning creature, Julian's hymn-dictionary, and sees   the thousands of carefully tabulated English hymns, by far the greater   number of them not only pitiable as efforts of human intelligence, but   absolutely worthless as vocal material for melodic treatment, one   wishes that all this effort had been directed to supply a real want. E.   g. the two Wesleys between them wrote thirteen octavo volumes, of some   400 pages each, full of closely printed hymns. One must wish that   Charles Wesley at least (who showed in a few instances how well he   could do) had, instead of reeling off all this stuff, concentrated his   efforts to produce only what should be worthy of his talents and useful   to posterity.  [18]If old tunes are modernized out of a fine rhythm, a curious result   would be likely to come about; viz. that modern tunes might be written   in the old rhythm for the sake of novelty, while the old were being   sung in the more modern way for the sake of uniformity.  [19]This fact is of course generally recognized. The explanation in the   text is one which was elaborately illustrated by the Slade Professor at   Oxford, in his last course of lectures on painting.  [20]There is one point which I cannot pass over. It has become the   practice in modern books to put marks of musical expression to the   words, directing the congregation when to sing loud or soft. This   implies a habit of congregational performance the description of which   would make a companion picture to the organ gallery of 1830. It seems   to me a practice of inconceivable degradation: one asks in trembling if   it is to be extended to the Psalms. It is just as if the congregation   were school-children singing to please a musical inspector, and he a   stupid one.  [21]It must be due to "]]]
