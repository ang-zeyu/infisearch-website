However, as she had evidently forgotten all about it, and as I cannot resist the temptation to elucidate complex subjects when opportunity offers, I began:--  \"It is a machine, mother, which--\"  \"Which bursts,\" interrupted Bella, with a little laugh.  \"But that is no explanation, dear,\" returned my mother; \"at least not a distinctive one, for guns burst sometimes, and soap-bubbles burst, and eggs burst occasionally.\"  \"Bella,\" said Nicholas, who spoke English perfectly, though with a slightly foreign accent, \"never interrupt a philosopher.  Allow Jeff to proceed with his definition.\"  \"Well, a torpedo,\" said I, \"is an infernal machine--\"  \"Jeff,\" said my mother, seriously, \"don't--\"  \"Mother, I use the word advisedly and dispassionately.  It is a term frequently given to such engines, because of their horrible nature, which suggests the idea that they were originated in the region of Satanic influence.  A torpedo, then, is a pretty large case, or box, or cask, or reservoir, of one form or another, filled with gunpowder, or gun-cotton, or dynamite, which is used chiefly under water, for blowing-up purposes.  Sometimes men use torpedoes to blow up rocks, and sunken wrecks; and sometimes, I grieve to say it, they blow up ships and sailors.\"  \"Dreadful! my dear,\" said my mother; \"nevertheless I should like to go with you on this excursion, and see what devices men invent for the purpose of killing each other.\"  \"Very well, that's settled,\" said I.  \"Now, as to the other letter about the yacht.  I will buy it, mother, and go on a cruise to the Mediterranean, on one condition, namely, that you and Nicholas and Bella go with me.\"  \"Impossible!\" exclaimed my mother, firmly; \"I never could bear the sea.\"  \"But you've had little experience of it,\" said I.  \"Well, not much--but I cannot bear it.\"  \"Now, mother,\" said I, coaxingly, \"here is Bella dying to go to sea, I know.  Nicholas has loads of time, and cannot be left behind, and I wish very much to go; but all will fall to the ground if you refuse to accompany us.  We cannot leave you in this house alone.  The sea air will certainly do you good, and if it does not, we can land, you know, at Lisbon, Gibraltar, Nice,--anywhere, and return home overland.\"  \"Well, then, I will go,\" returned my pliant mother.  \"That's right,\" said I, sitting down to write.  \"Now, then, all of you get ready to go to London this afternoon.  We shall spend a day or two there, because, before leaving, I must see the first Lord of the Admiralty on particular business.  Afterwards we shall run down to Portsmouth by the afternoon express, spend the night there, and so be ready to face the torpedoes in the morning.\"    CHAPTER THREE.  AN INTERVIEW WITH MEN IN POWER.  There is something peculiarly exhilarating in bright sunshine and calm weather.  This is no doubt a truism; but there are some truths of which one never tires, and in regard to which one feels ever-recurring freshness.  Who ever wearied of a balmy breeze, or a bright sunrise? Even a glorious noon cannot pall upon us unless it be too hot.  When bright sunshine is associated with good health, pleasant company, a successful courtship, and the prospect of light on a favourite study, the reader will understand how it was that my mother and I, with Nicholas and Bella, formed a peculiarly happy quartette as we perambulated the streets of London prior to my visit to the Admiralty.  It was a Friday forenoon, and there were many holiday-keepers hastening to trains.  At the corner of one of the main thoroughfares a crowd partly blocked the road.  The cause of it became apparent to us when the head and arched neck of a black charger appeared, and then the white plume and polished cuirass of a Life Guardsman.  We stood on a door-step, so that Bella might see the troop.  As they passed before us, with that stately bearing of man and horse which has always seemed to me peculiar to the Life Guards, and the sun flashed in dazzling gleams from breasts and helmets, I glanced at my friend Naranovitsch.  His soldierlike form was drawn up to its full height, while the flashing eye, flushed countenance, distended nostrils, and compressed but slightly smiling lips told, I thought, of a strong feeling of martial joy.  Doubtless he was thinking at the moment of his own regiment, to which he had been but recently appointed, and of his comrades-in-arms.  \"Fine-looking fellows!\"  I whispered.  \"Splendid! glorious!\" he said, in a deep, low voice.  Bella looked quickly up at him, displaying an anxious, sorrowing face, and bright eyes, dimmed with ill-suppressed tears.  \"You are not ill, Bella?\" he whispered, bending down with a look of tenderness, not unmixed with surprise.  \"No; oh, no,\" she replied, in a low tone; \"but the sight of the Guards has made me very sad.\"  I knew full well the cause of her emotion, but the crowded street was not a suitable place for explanation.  \"Come, follow me,\" I said, and walked quickly along in the direction of the Strand, where I turned abruptly into one of those quiet courts which form, as it were, harbours of refuge from the rattle and turmoil of the great city.  Here, sauntering slowly round the quiet precincts of the court, with the roar of the street subdued to a murmur like that of a distant cataract, Bella told Nicholas, in tones of the deepest pathos, how a German lady, Elsie Goeben, one of her dearest friends, had been married to the handsomest and best of men in one of the Prussian cavalry regiments.  How, only six months after their union, the Franco-Prussian war broke out, and Elsie's husband Wilhelm was sent with his regiment to the frontier; how in many engagements he had distinguished himself; and how, at last, he was mortally wounded during one of the sorties at the siege of Metz.  \"They did not find him till next day,\" continued my sister, \"for he had fallen in a part of the field so far in advance of the ground on which his dead comrades lay, that he had been overlooked.  He was riddled with bullets, they say, and his noble face, which I had so often seen beaming with affection on his young wife, was so torn and disfigured that his friends could scarcely recognise him.  He was still alive when found, and they knew his voice.  When they raised him, he merely exclaimed, `_At last_, thank God!' with a deep sigh, as if of relief.  The words were few, but they had terrible significance, for they told of a long, long night of agony and dreadful solitude; but he was not quite alone,\" my sister added, in a low voice, \"for he was a Christian.  He died before reaching the tents of his division.\"  Bella's voice faltered as she said, after a moment's pause, \"Dear Elsie never recovered the shock.  She joined her husband in heaven two months afterwards.\"  \"Truly,\" said I, \"war is a terrible curse.\"  \"I hate it!  I detest it!\" cried Bella, with a sudden tone and look of energy, that was all the more impressive because of her natural character being gentle and retiring.  I saw that Nicholas was surprised and pained.  He would fain have comforted Bella, but knew not what to say, for he had been trained to talk of \"martial glory,\" and to look on war through the medium of that halo of false glitter with which it has been surrounded by too many historians in all ages.  The young Russian had hitherto dwelt chiefly on one aspect of war.  He had thought of noble and heroic deeds in defence of hearth and home, and all that man holds sacred.  To fight for his country was to Nicholas an idea that called up only the thoughts of devotion, self-sacrifice in a good cause, duty, fidelity, courage, romance; while, in regard to the minor things of a warrior's life, a hazy notion of dash, glitter, music, and gaiety floated through his brain.  Of course he was not _ignorant_ of some of the darker shades of war.  History, which told him of many gallant deeds, also recorded numberless dreadful acts.  But these latter he dismissed as being disagreeable and unavoidable accompaniments of war.  He simply accepted things as he found them, and, not being addicted to very close reasoning, did not trouble himself much as to the rectitude or wisdom of war in the abstract.  Neither did he distinguish between righteous and unrighteous war--war of self-defence and war of aggression.  Sufficient for him that he served his country faithfully.  This was a good general principle, no doubt, for a youthful officer; but as one who expected to rise to power and influence in his native land, something more definite would ultimately be required of him.  As yet, he had neither experienced the excitement, beheld the miseries, nor bathed in the so-called \"glory\" of war; and now that a corner of the dark cloud was unexpectedly flung over him in Bella's sorrow, he felt deeply sympathetic but helpless.  A sad look, however, and a gentle pressure of the hand that rested on his arm, was quite sufficient for Bella.  To relieve my friend from his embarrassment, I pulled out my watch and urged that we should walk in the direction of the Admiralty, as the hour for my interview had nearly arrived.  At Charing-Cross we parted, and I proceeded on my mission with the plan of my torpedo, which Nicholas styled the \"infernal machine,\" in my pocket, and a rather anxious heart in my breast, for although I was quite certain that my invention was superior to all others, inasmuch as it fulfilled several conditions which were not fulfilled by other torpedoes, I did not feel sure that the Lords of the Admiralty would take the same view of it that I did.  Besides, the machine had only been tried as a model, and might not act perfectly when tested in actual warfare.  But, of course, I knew that my inventive powers would readily overcome each weak point as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21705"],["title","In the Track of the Troops (#4)"],["body"," cropped into view in practice.  I met with a very gracious reception from the first Lord.  Beside him were seated two elderly gentlemen, whom I judged to be brother Lords.  It were needless to recount all that passed during that memorable interview.  Suffice it to say, that after I had given a most careful and clear explanation of my invention, to which the three Lords listened with marked attention, the first Lord said, with a bland smile--  \"But what, Mr Childers, is the peculiar point of superiority over other torpedoes which you claim for yours?\"  I confess that the question damped me a little, for I had been remarkably explicit in my explanations, which lasted nearly an hour. However, with the utmost alacrity, I went again over the chief points.  \"You observe, my Lord,\" said I, pointing to my drawing, which lay spread out on the table, \"that this watch-work arrangement in the heart of the machine is so intimately connected with that lever and screw on its exterior, that in passing out of the case from which it is launched into the sea, the machinery is set in motion, and the first act of the torpedo is to set or regulate itself for the special purpose for which it is designed.  Thus it may be styled an automatic torpedo.  The celebrated Whitehead fish-torpedo, beautiful and cleverly contrived though it be, can only advance straight to its object at a certain depth below the surface; but mine, as you see, by this arrangement of the main pneumatic engine, which connects the watch-work regulator with an eccentric wheel or fin outside, causes the torpedo to describe a curve of any size, and in any direction, during its progress.  Thus, if you wish to hit an enemy's vessel, but cannot venture to fire because of a friendly ship happening to lie between, you have only to set the eccentric indicator to the required curve, and send the torpedo on its mission of destruction right under the bottom of the friendly ship; or by laying the torpedo on its side, it will easily go round it, and afterwards hit the enemy.\"  \"Ah!  I see,\" said the first Lord, with a grave nod; \"you have at last succeeded in making that which has so long been held impossible; an instrument which will shoot round the corner.\"  \"Well, a--; yes, my Lord, although I confess it had not struck me in that light before.  But,\" I continued, feeling my enthusiasm rise as the first Lord became more appreciative, \"the weapon may be used even in attacking fortresses from the sea, for by making what I may call the inverted trajectory of the curve very high, the torpedo may be made to rush under the surface of the water, gradually curve upwards, then shoot right out of its native element, and go straight into a fort or town on a hill, at least a hundred feet above the level of the sea.\"  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed the first Lord.  I observed that the other two Lords were gazing at me, with looks from which were banished every expression except that of intense surprise. Regarding this as a sign that the merits of my invention were beginning to tell on them, I went on--  \"Yes, my Lord, the action of the thing is absolutely certain, if the distance of the object aimed at be ascertained to a nicety, and the arrangements of the watch-work indicator adjusted to those of the eccentric wheel and the pneumatic engine with mathematical precision. This, of course, in these days of thorough education, can be easily done by even the youngest officer in a ship.  I should have mentioned, however, that if it were required to send the torpedo into a citadel or fortress on a hill, it would be necessary to use a stronger explosive than any yet known,--gun-cotton and dynamite being too weak, and nitro-glycerine too dangerous, therefore inadmissible.\"  \"Ha!\" exclaimed the first Lord, \"and where is such an explosive to be found?\"  \"In my laboratory down in Devonshire, my Lord,\" I answered, with a look of diffidence, feeling uncertain how he would take the announcement.  For a few moments he contemplated me in perfect silence, and I observed that the other two Lords smiled.  I felt perplexed, but the awkwardness of the moment was quickly removed by the first Lord asking what my new compound was made of.  \"That, my Lord,\" said I, \"is a secret.\"  \"Just so, and you wish to sell your secret to Government?\"  \"No, my Lord,\" I replied, with dignity; \"I wish to let my Government possess any slight gift which it lies in my power to present to it, in addition to that of a loyal heart; but I cannot afford to let my secret be known, unless I have some assurance that it shall be held inviolable.\"  \"That assurance you have,\" said the first Lord, \"but I should have supposed that to so loyal a subject the character of the British Admiralty would have been sufficient guarantee, and that nothing further would have been required from me.\"  \"I do _not_ require further assurance, my Lord,\" said I, hastily; \"I merely wish you to understand how important it is that secrecy should be observed.  I will reveal it to you.\"  Here I rose and whispered in the first Lord's ear.  He turned pale, as I sat down, and whispered to the other two Lords, who looked very grave, from which I augured good fortune to my invention.  At the same time I was surprised, for my communication to him was in no way alarming, though connected with explosives.  Presently the first Lord touched a bell.  A servant in uniform appeared, and after a few words, disappeared.  I was puzzled, but silent.  \"Mr Childers,\" said the first Lord, \"I shall give your invention my best attention; but I must tell you that there are many others in this country, as well as yourself, who are exerting their minds to discover the most effectual method of spreading wholesale devastation among their fellow-creatures, and--\"  \"Forgive my interrupting you, my Lord,\" I exclaimed, with a look of horror, \"but I repudiate entirely any intention to destroy my fellow-creatures.  My motives in this matter have been purely scientific.\"  \"I have no doubt of it,\" returned the first Lord, with a smile, \"nevertheless the tendency of your labours is towards destruction; and my reference to the fact is merely for the purpose of informing you that there are many other inventors who have claimed my attention to their designs, and that you must not expect an immediate decision in regard to yours.\"  With this I was politely bowed out, and as I passed down the corridor, I could not help feeling disappointed at the rather faint success of my visit.  The idea, too, that I was a would-be destroyer of my species had never before occurred to me, my whole soul and faculties having hitherto been engrossed in the simple idea of perfecting a chemical explosive and a mechanical contrivance.  Thus, unintentionally, do we sometimes lend ourselves to that from which our hearts revolt.  I noticed, too, that the servant who had been summoned by the first Lord while we were discussing the torpedo, was particularly attentive to me, and very careful in seeing me off the premises; and then, for the first time, it flashed across my mind that I had been taken for a madman.  I was so tickled with the idea, that I burst into a sudden fit of hearty laughter, an act which induced a little boy, a policeman, and an old woman, who chanced to be passing, to imbibe the erroneous view of the first Lord.  However, although grievously disheartened, I was not subdued.  Hope, which tells so many flattering tales, told me that after proper consideration the Admiralty would infallibly perceive the value of my invention; and in regard to the destruction of my fellow-creatures, I consoled myself with the reflection that torpedoes were much more calculated for defensive than offensive warfare.  Before quitting this subject, I may state that from that day to this, I have never heard from the Admiralty in reference to my invention.  This fact gives me no pain now, although it did at first.  I will explain why.  There is a friend of mine--a grave, kindly, young man, yet withal sarcastic and eccentric--who met me immediately after my visit to the Admiralty.  He is a strange being this friend, who crops up at all sorts of unexpected times, and in divers places, when one least expects him. His name is U. Biquitous.  \"My dear Childers,\" said he, when I had explained matters, \"you are a victim;--you are the victim of self-delusion.  You were victimised by self-delusion when I first met you, at the time you thought you had discovered perpetual motion.  Your torpedo, as you have just described it to me, is an impossibility, and you yourself are--\"  \"An ass?\" said I, looking up in his face.  \"No, by no means,\" returned Biquitous, earnestly; \"but you are an enthusiast without ballast.  Enthusiasm is a fine, noble quality.  The want of ballast is a grievous misfortune.  Study mechanics, my boy, a little more than you have yet done, before venturing on further inventions, and don't theorise too much.  You have been revelling of late in the regions of fancy.  Take my advice, and don't do it.\"  \"I wont,\" said I, fervently, \"but I cannot give up my cherished pursuits.\"  \"There is no reason that you should,\" returned my friend, grasping my hand, \"and my earnest advice to you is to continue them; but lay in some ballast if possible.\"  With these cheery words ringing in my ears, I rejoined my mother and sister, and went off to Portsmouth.  It is well, however, to state here that my personal investigations in the matter of explosives had at this time received a death-blow.  I went, indeed, with intense interest to see the display of our national destructive powers at Portsmouth, but I never again ventured to add my own little quota to the sum of human knowledge on such subjects; and the reader may henceforth depend upon it, that in all I shall hereafter write, there shall be drawn a distinct and unmistakable line between the region of fact and fancy.
