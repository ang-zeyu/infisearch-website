Poor Nelly, whose heart had been gradually sinking, fairly broke down; she hid her face in her brother's bosom, and wept.  \"Come now, don't do that, dear Nell,\" said Roy, tenderly, \"I'll tell you what we shall do--we'll camp in the snow!  We have often done it close to the house, you know, for fun, so we'll do it now in earnest.\"  \"But it's so dark and cold,\" sobbed Nelly, looking round with a shudder into the dark recesses of the forest, which were by that time enshrouded by the gathering shades of night; \"and I'm _so_ hungry too!  Oh me! what _shall_ we do?\"  \"Now _don't_ get so despairing,\" urged Roy, whose courage rose in proportion as his sister's sank; \"it's not such an awful business after all, for father is sure to scour the woods in search of us, an' if we only get a comfortable encampment made, an' a roarin' fire kindled, why, we'll sit beside it an' tell stories till they find us.  They'll be sure to see the fire, you know, so come--let's to work.\"  Roy said this so cheerfully that the child felt a little comforted, dried her eyes, and said she would \"help to make the camp.\"  This matter of making an encampment in the snow, although laborious work, was by no means a novelty to these children of the backwoods. They had often been taught how to do it by Cousin Walter and Larry O'Dowd, and had made \"playing at camps\" their chief amusement in fine winter days.  When, therefore, they found themselves compelled to \"camp-out\" from necessity, neither of them was at a loss how to proceed. Roy drew a circle in the snow, about three yards in diameter, at the foot of a large tree, and then both set to work to dig a hole in this space, using their snow-shoes as shovels.  It took an hour's hard work to reach the ground, and when they did so the piled-up snow all round raised the walls of this hole to the height of about six feet.  \"Now for bedding,\" cried Roy, scrambling over the walls of their camp and going into the woods in search of a young pine-tree, while Nelly sat down on the ground to rest after her toil.  It was a dark night, and the woods were so profoundly obscured, that Roy had to grope about for some time before he found a suitable tree. Cutting it down with the axe which always hung at his girdle, he returned to camp with it on his shoulder, and cut off the small soft branches, which Nelly spread over the ground to the depth of nearly half a foot.  This \"pine-brush,\" as it is called, formed a soft elastic couch.  The fire was the next business.  Again Roy went into the bush and gathered a large bundle of dry branches.  \"Now, Nelly, do you break a lot of the small twigs,\" said Roy, \"and I'll strike a light.\"  He pulled his firebag from his belt as he spoke, and drew from it flint, steel, and tinder.  No one ever travels in the wilds of which we write without such means of procuring fire.  Roy followed the example of his elder companions in carrying a firebag, although he did not, like them, carry tobacco and pipe in it.  Soon the bright sparks that flew from the flint caught on the tinder. This was placed in a handful of dry grass, and whirled rapidly round until it was fanned into a flame.  Nelly had prepared another handful of dry grass with small twigs above it.  The light was applied, the fire leaped up, more sticks were piled on, and at last the fire roared upward, sending bright showers of sparks into the branches overhead, lighting the white walls of the camp with a glow that caused them to sparkle as with millions of gems, and filling the hearts of the children with a sensation of comfort and gladness, while they stood before the blaze and warmed themselves, rubbing their hands and laughing with glee.  No one, save those who have experienced it, can form any conception of the cheering effect of a fire in the heart of a dark wood at night.  Roy and Nelly quite forgot their lost condition for a short time, in the enjoyment of the comforting heat and the bright gladsome blaze.  The brother cut firewood until he was rendered almost breathless, the sister heaped on the wood until the fire roared and leaped high above their heads.  Strange though it may appear to some, the snow did not melt. The weather was too cold for that; only a little of that which was nearest the fire melted--the snow walls remained hard frozen all round. Roy soon sat down to rest, as close to the fire as he could without getting scorched; then Nelly seated herself by his side and nestled her head in his breast.  There they sat, telling stories and gazing at the fire, and waiting for \"father to come.\"  Meanwhile Robin and his comrade ranged the forest far and near in desperate anxiety.  But it was a wide and wild country.  The children had wandered far away; a high ridge of land hid their fire from view. Moreover, Robin, knowing the children's usual haunts, had chanced to go off in the wrong direction.  When night set in the hunters returned to Fort Enterprise to procure ammunition and provisions, in order to commence a more thorough and prolonged search.  Poor Mrs Gore still sat beside the cold and untasted feast, and there the hunters left her, while they once more plunged into the pathless wilderness to search for the lost ones on that luckless New Year's Day.    CHAPTER FIVE.  CARRIED OFF.  While Robin Gore and his companions were anxiously searching the woods around Fort Enterprise for the lost children, a war-party of savages was making its way swiftly towards the Fort.  A chief of the Indians, named Hawk, who was a shrewd as well as a bad man, had suspected Wapaw's intentions in quitting the camp of his people alone and in such unnecessary haste.  This man had great influence over his fellows, and easily prevailed on them to set off on their murderous expedition against the Fort of the \"pale-faces\" without delay.  Being well supplied with food, they travelled faster than their starving comrade, and almost overtook him.  They finally encamped within a short distance of the Fort the day after Wapaw's arrival, and prepared to assault it early next morning.  \"If the wicked skunk has got there before us,\" said Hawk to his fellows, as they prepared to set out before daybreak, \"the pale-faces will be ready for us, and we may as well go back to our wigwams at once; but if that badger's whelp has been slow of foot, we shall hang the scalps of the pale-faces at our belts, and eat their food this day.\"  The polite titles above used by Hawk were meant to refer to Wapaw.  Indians are not naturally loquacious.  No reply was made to Hawk's remark, except that one man with a blackened face, and a streak of red ochre down the bridge of his nose, said, \"Ho!\" and another with an equally black face, and three red streaks on each of his cheeks, said, \"Hum!\" as the war-party put on their snowshoes and prepared to start.  They had not gone far when Hawk came to a sudden pause, and stood transfixed and motionless like a dark statue.  His comrades also stopped abruptly and crouched.  No question was asked, but Hawk pointed to a spark of fire, which every Indian in the band had observed the instant their leader had paused.  Silently they crept forward, with guns cocked and arrows fitted to the bowstrings, until they all stood round an encampment where the fire was still smouldering, and in the centre of which lay a little boy and girl, fast asleep and shuddering with cold.  Poor Roy and Nelly had told each other stories until their eyes would not remain open; then they fell asleep, despite their efforts to keep awake, and, as the fire sank low, they began to shiver with the cold. Lucky was it for them that the Indians discovered them, else they had certainly been frozen to death that night.  Hawk roused them with little ceremony.  Roy, by an impulse which would appear to be natural to those who dwell in wild countries, whether young or old, seized his axe, which lay beside him, as he leaped up.  Hawk grinned, and took the axe from him at once, and the poor boy, seeing that he was surrounded by dark warriors, offered no resistance, but sought to comfort Nelly, who was clinging to him and trembling with terror.  Immediately the savages sat down in the encampment, and began an earnest discussion, which the children watched with great eagerness.  They evidently did not agree, for much gesticulation and great vehemence characterised their debate.  Some pointed towards the Fort, and touched their tomahawks, while others pointed to the woods in the direction whence they had come, and shook their heads.  Not a few drew their scalping knives partially from their sheaths, and, pointing to the children, showed clearly that they wished to cut their career short without delay, but several of the more sedate members of the party evidently objected to this.  Finally, Hawk turned to Roy, and said something to him in the Indian tongue.  Roy did not understand, and attempted to say so as well as he could by signs, and the use of the few words of the Cree language which his father had taught him.  In the course of his speech (if we may use that term), he chanced to mention Wapaw's name.  \"Ho! ho! ho!\" said one and another of the Indians, while Hawk grinned horribly.  A variety of questions were now put to poor Roy, who, not understanding, of course could not answer them.  Hawk, however, repeated Wapaw's name, and pointed towards the Fort with a look of inquiry, to which Roy replied by nodding his head and repeating \"Wapaw\" once or twice, also pointing to the Fort; for he began to suspect these must be Wapaw's comrades, who had come to search for him.  He therefore volunteered a little additional information by means of signs; rubbed his stomach, looked dreadfully rueful, rolled himself as if in agony on the ground, and then, getting up, pretended to eat and look happy!  By all of which he meant to show how that Wapaw had been on the borders of starvation, but had been happily saved therefrom.  Indians in council might teach a useful"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21703"],["title","Silver Lake (#4)"],["body","to our members of parliament, for they witnessed this rather laughable species of pantomime with profound gravity and silence.  When Roy concluded, they nodded their heads, and said, \"Ho! ho!\" which, no doubt, was equivalent to \"Hear hear!\"  After a little more discussion they rose to depart, and made signs to the children to get up and follow.  Roy then pointed out the broken state of his snow-shoe, but this difficulty was overcome by Hawk, who threw it away, and made him put on his sister's snow-shoes.  A stout young warrior was ordered to take Nelly on his back, which he did without delay, and the whole party left the encampment, headed by their chief.  The children submitted cheerfully at first, under the impression that the Indians meant to convey them to the Fort.  Great, however, was their horror when they were taken through the woods by a way which they knew to be quite in the opposite direction.  When Roy saw this he stopped and looked back, but an Indian behind him gave him a poke with the butt of his gun, which there was no resisting. For a moment the lad thought of trying to break away, run home, and tell his father of Nelly's fate; but a second thought convinced him that this course was utterly impracticable.  As for Nelly, she was too far from her brother in the procession to hold converse with him; and, as she knew not what to do, say, think, she was reduced to the miserable consolation of bedewing with her tears the shoulders of the young warrior who carried her.  The storm which had commenced the day before still continued, so that, in the course of a few hours, traces of the track of the war-party were almost obliterated, and the chance of their being followed by Robin and his friends was rendered less and less likely as time ran on.  All that day they travelled without halt, and when they stopped at night to encamp, Roy was nearly dead from exhaustion.  \"My poor Nell,\" said he, drawing his sobbing sister close to him, as they sat near the camp fire, after having eaten the small quantity of dried venison that was thrown to them by their captors, \"don't despair; father will be sure to hunt us down, if it's in the power of man to do it.\"  \"I don't despair,\" sobbed Nelly; \"but oh! what will darling mother do when she finds that we're lost, and I'm so afraid they'll kill us.\"  \"No fear o' that, Nell; it's not worth their while.  Remember, too, what mother often told us--that--that--what is it she used to read so often out of the Bible?  I forget.\"  \"I think it was, `Call upon Me in the time of trouble, and I will deliver thee.'  I've been thinkin' of that, Roy, already.\"  \"That's right, Nell; now, come, cheer up!  Have you had enough to eat?\"  \"Yes,\" said Nelly, with a loud yawn, which she did not attempt to check.  Roy echoed it, as a matter of course, (who ever did see anyone yawn without following suit?) and then the two lay down together, spread over themselves an old blanket which one of the Indians had given them, and fell asleep at once.  Day succeeded day, night followed night, and weeks came and went, yet the Indians continued their journey through the snow-clad wilderness. Roy's snow-shoes had been picked up and repaired by one of the savages, and Nelly was made to walk a good deal on her own snowshoes; but it is justice to the Indians to say that they slackened their pace a little for the sake of the children, and when Nelly showed symptoms of being fatigued, the stout young warrior who originally carried her took her on his shoulders.  At length the encampment of the tribe was reached, and Nelly was handed over to Hawk's wife to be her slave.  Soon after that, the tents were struck, and the whole tribe went deeper into the northern wilds. Several gales arose and passed away, completely covering their footprints, so that no tracks were left behind them.    CHAPTER SIX.  THE CAMP, THE ATTACK, AND THE ESCAPE.  It were vain to attempt a description of the varied condition of mind into which the brother and sister fell when they found themselves actually reduced to a state of slavery in an Indian camp, and separated from their parents, as they firmly believed, for ever.  Nelly wept her eyes almost out of their sockets at first.  Then she fell into a sort of apathetic state, in which, for several days, she went about her duties almost mechanically, feeling as if it were all a horrible dream, out of which she would soon awake, and find herself at home with her \"darling mother\" beside her.  This passed, however, and she had another fit of heart-breaking sorrow, from which she found relief by recalling some of the passages in God's Word, which her mother had taught her to repeat by heart; especially that verse in which it is said, \"that Jesus is a friend who sticketh closer than a brother.\"  And this came to the poor child's mind with peculiar power, because her own brother Roy was so kind, and took such pains to comfort her, and to enter into all her girlish feelings and sympathies, that she could scarcely imagine it possible for anyone to stick closer to her in all her distress than he did.  As for Roy, he was not given to the melting mood.  His nature was bold and manly.  Whatever he felt, he kept it to himself, and he forgot more than half his own sorrow in his brotherly efforts to assuage that of Nelly.  Both of them were active and willing to oblige, so that they did not allow their grief to interfere with their work, a circumstance which induced their captors to treat them with forbearance, and even kindness. Nelly sobbed and worked; gradually, the sobbing decreased, and the work was carried on with vigour, so that she soon became quite expert at skinning rabbits, boiling meat, embroidering mocassins, smoking deerskins, chopping firewood into small pieces, and many other details of Indian household economy; while Roy went out with the hunters, and became a very Nimrod, insomuch that he soon excelled all the lads of his own age, and many of those who were older, in the use of the bow, the snow-shoes, the spear, the axe, and the gun.  But all this, and what they did and said in the Indian camp during that winter, and what was said and done to them, we do not mean to write about, having matter of deeper interest to tell.  Winter passed away, and spring came.  But little do those who dwell in England know of the enchantment of returning spring in the frozen wilderness of North America.  The long, long winter, seems as though it would _never_ pass away.  The intense frost seals up all the sweet odours of the woods for so many months, that the nostrils become powerfully sensitive, and, as it were, yearn for something to smell. The skin gets so used to frost, that a balmy breeze is thought of as a thing of the past, or well-nigh forgotten.  Spring in those regions comes suddenly.  It came on our wanderers with a gush.  One night the temperature rose high above the freezing point; next day all the sights and sounds of Nature's great awakening were in full play.  The air fanned their cheeks like a summer breeze; the strange unwonted sound of tinkling and dropping water was heard; scents, as of green things, were met and inhaled greedily.  As the thirsty Bedouin drinks from the well in the oasis, so did Roy and Nelly drink in the delicious influences of melting nature.  And they thought of those words which say, that the wilderness shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.  The rejoicing had commenced, the blossoming would soon follow.  But warlike and wicked men were even then preparing to desecrate the beautiful land.  A war-party of enemies had come down upon the tribe, with whom they dwelt.  Scouts had brought in the news.  All was commotion and excitement in the camp.  Goods and chattels were being packed up.  The women and children were to be sent off with these, under an escort, to a place of greater security, while the Braves armed for the fight.  In the middle of all the confusion, Roy took Nelly aside, and, with a look of mystery, said--  \"Nell, dear, I'm goin' to run away.  Stay, now, don't stare so like an owl, but hold your sweet tongue until I have explained what I mean to do.  You and I have picked up a good deal of useful knowledge of one sort or another since we came here, and I'm inclined to think we are quite fit to take to the woods and work our way back to Fort Enterprise.\"  \"But isn't it an _awful_ long way?\" said Nelly.  \"It is, but we have an _awful_ long time to travel; haven't we all our lives before us?  If our lives are long, we'll manage it; if they are short, why, we won't want to manage it, so we need not bother our heads about that?\"  \"But the way home,\" suggested Nelly, \"do you know it?\"  \"Of course I know it; that is to say, I know, from that ugly thief Hawk, that it lies somewhere or other to the south-west o' this place, some hundreds of miles off; how many hundreds does not much matter, for we have got the whole of the spring, summer, and fall before us.\"  \"But what if we don't get home in the fall?\"  \"Then we shall spend the winter in the woods, that's all.\"  Nelly laughed, in spite of her anxieties, at the confident tone in which her brother spoke; and, being quite unable to argue the matter farther, she said that she was ready to do whatever Roy pleased, having perfect confidence in his wisdom.  \"That's right, Nell; now, you get ready to start at a moment's notice. When the Injuns attack the camp, we'll give 'em the slip.  Put all you want to take with you on a toboggan, [see note 1] and meet me at the crooked tree when the camp moves.\"  That night the camp was struck, and the women and children departed, under a strong escort.  Almost at the same time the enemy came down on their prey, but they met men prepared for them.  In the dark, Nelly crept to the crooked tree, dragging the toboggan after her.  She was met by Roy, who took the sledge-line and her hand and led her into the dark forest, while the savages were fighting and yelling like fiends in the"]]]
