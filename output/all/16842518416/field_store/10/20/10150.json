I know that well.  Good-bye.\"  They shook hands again, and were soon striding over the snow to their respective homes.    CHAPTER TWO.  CONFLICTING ELEMENTS AND A CATASTROPHE.  Hoary winter passed away, and genial spring returned to rejoice the land.  In a particularly amiable frame of mind, old Ravenshaw went out one morning to smoke.  Everything had gone well that morning.  Breakfast had been punctual; appetite good; rheumatics in abeyance; the girls lively; and Miss Trim less of a torrent than was her wont.  Mrs Ravenshaw's intellect had more than once almost risen to the ordinary human average, and Master Tony had been better--perhaps it were more correct to say less wicked-- than usual.  Old Ravenshaw was what his friends styled a heavy smoker, so was his kitchen chimney; but then the chimney had the excuse of being compelled to smoke, whereas its owner's insane act was voluntary.  Be not afraid, reader.  We have no intention of entering into an argument with smokers.  They are a pigheaded generation.  We address those who have not yet become monomaniacs as regards tobacco.  In order to the full enjoyment of his pipe, the old gentleman had built on a knoll what Elsie styled a summer-house.  Regardless of seasons, however--as he was of most things--her father used this temple at all seasons of the year, and preferred to call it a smoking box.  Now, as this smoking-box, with its surroundings, had much to do with the issues of our story, we bring it under particular notice.  It resembled a large sentry-box, and the willow-clad knoll on which it stood was close to the river.  Being elevated slightly above the rest of the country, a somewhat extended view of river and plain was obtainable therefrom. Samuel Ravenshaw loved to contemplate this view through the medium of smoke.  Thus seen it was hazy and in accord with his own idea of most things.  The sun shone warmly into the smoking-box.  It sparkled on the myriad dew-drops that hung on the willows, and swept in golden glory over the rolling plains.  The old gentleman sat down, puffed, and was happy.  The narcotic influence operated, and the irascible demon in his breast fell sound asleep.  How often do bright sunshine and profound calm precede a storm?  Is not that a truism--if not a newism.  The old gentleman had barely reduced himself to quiescence, and the demon had only just begun to snore, when a cloud, no bigger than a man's body, arose on the horizon.  Gradually it drew near, partially obscured the sky, and overshadowed the smoking-box in the form of Angus Macdonald, the father of Ian.  (The demon ceased snoring!)  \"Coot tay to you, sir,\" said Angus.  \"You will pe enchoyin' your pipe this fine mornin'.\"  \"Yes, Angus, I am,\" replied Ravenshaw, with as much urbanity as he could assume--and it wasn't much, for he suspected the cause of his neighbour's visit--\"you'd better sit down and light your own.\"  Angus accepted the invitation, and proceeded to load with much deliberation.  Now it must be known that the Highlander loved the view from that knoll as much as did his neighbour.  It reminded him of the old country where he had been born and bred on a hill-top.  He coveted that willow knoll intensely, desiring to build a house on it, and, being prosperous, was willing to give for it more than its value, for his present dwelling lay somewhat awkwardly in the creek, a little higher up the river, so that the willows on the knoll interfered vexatiously with his view.  \"It's a peautiful spote this!\" observed Angus, after a few preliminary puffs.  \"It is,\" answered the old trader curtly, (and the demon awoke).  Angus made no rejoinder for a few minutes, but continued to puff great clouds with considerable emphasis from his compressed lips.  Mr Ravenshaw returned the fire with interest.  \"It'll no pe for sellin' the knowl, ye are?\" said Angus.  The demon was fairly roused now.  \"No, Angus Macdonald,\" said the trader sternly, \"I'll _not_ sell it. I've told you already more than once, and it is worse than ill-judged, it is impertinent of you to come bothering me to part with my land.\"  \"Ho! inteed!\" exclaimed Angus, rising in wrath, and cramming his pipe into his vest pocket; \"it is herself that will pe pothering you no more spout your dirty land, Samyool Ruvnshaw.\"  He strode from the spot with a look of ineffable scorn, and the air of an offended chieftain.  Old Ravenshaw tried to resume his tranquillity, but the demon was self-willed, and tobacco had lost its power.  There were more clouds, however, in store for him that morning.  It so fell out that Ian Macdonald, unable to bear the suspense of uncertainty any longer, and all ignorant of his father's visit to the old trader, had made up his mind to bring things to a point that very morning by formally asking permission to pay his addresses to Elsie Ravenshaw.  Knowing the old man's habits, he went straight to the smoking-box.  If he had set out half an hour sooner he would have met his own father and saved himself trouble.  As it was, they missed each other.  Mr Ravenshaw had only begun to feel slightly calmed when Ian presented himself, with a humble, propitiatory air.  The old man hated humility in every form, even its name.  He regarded it as a synonym for hypocrisy. The demon actually leaped within him, but the old man had a powerful will.  He seized his spiritual enemy, throttled, and held him down.  \"Good-morning, Mr Ravenshaw.\"  \"Good-morning.\"  Nothing more was said by either for a few minutes.  Ian was embarrassed. He had got up a set speech and forgotten it.  He was shy, but he was also resolute.  Drawing himself up suddenly he said, with an earnest, honest look, \"Mr Ravenshaw, I love your daughter,\" (there was only one daughter in Ian's estimation!) \"and I come to ask leave to woo her.  If, by earnest devotion and--\"  \"Ian Macdonald,\" interrupted the old gentleman, in a voice of suppressed anger, \"you may save yourself and me the trouble of more talk on this subject.  Your father has just been here wanting me to sell him this knoll.  Now, look here,\" (he rose, and stepping out of the smoking-box, pointed to Angus Macdonald's house, which was full in view), \"you see that house, young man.  Mark what I say.  I will sell this knoll to your father, and give my daughter to you, when you take that house, and with your own unaided hands place it on the top of this knoll!\"  This was meant by the old trader as a bitterly facetious way of indicating the absolute hopelessness of the case.  Ian accepted it in that light, for he was well aware that Samuel Ravenshaw's firmness--or obstinacy--was insurmountable.  He did not despair, however; true love never does that; but he felt tremendously cast down.  Without a word or look of reproach he turned and walked slowly away.  Once again the old trader sought comfort in his pipe, but found none. Besides feeling extremely indignant; with the Macdonalds, father and son, for what he styled their presumption, he was now conscious of having treated both with undue severity.  Dashing his pipe on the ground, he thrust both hands into his coat pockets, and returned towards his dwelling.  On the way he unfortunately met Petawanaquat in one of his fields, leaning composedly over a gate.  That intelligent redskin had not yet finished his inquiries at the missionary village.  He had appeared more than once at Willow Creek, and seemed to hover round the old trader like a moth round a candle.  The man was innocent of any evil intent on this occasion, but Ravenshaw would have quarrelled with an angel just then.  \"What are you doing here?  Be off!\" he said sternly.  The Indian either did not or would not understand, and the old man, seizing him by the arm, thrust him violently through the gateway.  All the hot blood of the Petawanaquats, from Adam downwards, seemed to leap through the red man's veins and concentrate in his right hand as he turned fiercely on the trader and drew his scalping-knife.  Quick as lightning Ravenshaw hit out with his fist, and knocked the Indian down, then, turning on his heel, walked away.  For a moment Petawanaquat lay stunned.  Recovering, he arose, and his dark glittering eyes told of a purpose of deadly revenge.  The trader was still in sight.  The Indian picked up his gun, glided swiftly behind a tree, and took a long steady aim.  Just then little Tony rushed from the house and leaped into his father's arms, where he received an unusually warm embrace, for the trader wanted some sort of relief for his feelings.  The Indian's finger was pressing the trigger at the moment.  Death was very near Samuel Ravenshaw just then, but the finger relaxed and the gun was lowered.  A more terrible form of revenge had flashed into the mind of the savage.  Gliding quietly from his position, he entered the willows and disappeared.  Meanwhile Angus Macdonald returned in no very amiable mood to his own house.  It was a small house; had been built by its owner, and was, like most of the other houses of the colony at that time, a good solid log structure--a sort of Noah's ark on a small scale.  It stood on a flat piece of mother earth, without any special foundation except a massive oblong wooden frame to which all the superstructure was attached.  You might, if strong enough, have grasped it by the ridge-pole and carried it bodily away without tearing up any foundation or deranging the fabric.  It was kept in order and managed by an elderly sister of Angus, named Martha, for Angus was a widower.  His only son Ian dwelt in the school-house, a mile farther up the river."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21697"],["title","The Red Man's Revenge: A Tale of The Red River Flood (#3)"],["body","  Martha's strong point was fowls.  We are too ignorant of that subject to go into particulars.  We can only say that she was an adept at fowls. Martha's chickens were always tender and fat, and their eggs were the largest and freshest in Red River.  We introduce these fowls solely because one of them acted a very important part on a very critical occasion.  As well might the geese who saved Rome be omitted from history as Martha Macdonald's Cochin-China hen which--well, we won't say what just yet.  That hen was frightfully plain.  Why Cochin-China hens should have such long legs and wear feather trousers are questions which naturalists must settle among themselves.  Being a humorous man, Angus had named her Beauty.  She was a very cross hen, and her feather unmentionables fitted badly.  Moreover, she was utterly useless, and never laid an egg, which was fortunate, for if she had laid one it would have been an egregious monstrosity.  She was obviously tough.  If they had slain her for the table they would have had to cut her up with a hand-saw, or grind her into meal to fit her for use.  Besides all this, Beauty was a widow.  When her husband died--probably of disgust--she took to crowing on her own account.  She received Angus with a crow when he entered the house after his interview with Ravenshaw, and appeared to listen intently as he poured his sorrows into his sister's ear.  \"It's up at the knowl I've peen, Martha, an' I left Samyool Ruvnshaw there in a fery pad temper--fery pad inteed.  He'll come oot of it, whatever.\"  \"An' he'll not be for sellin' you the knowl?\" asked Martha.  \"No, he won't,\" replied Angus.  From this point they went off into a very long-winded discussion of the pros and cons of the case, which, however, we will spare the reader, and return to Willow Creek.  The bed of the creek, near to the point where it joined the Red River, was a favourite resort of Master Tony.  Thither he went that same afternoon to play.  Having observed the child's habits, Petawanaquat paddled his canoe to the same point and hid it and himself among the overhanging bushes of the creek.  In the course of his gambols Tony approached the place.  One stroke of the paddle sent the light birch-bark canoe like an arrow across the stream.  The Indian sprang on shore.  Tony gave him one scared look and was about to utter an appalling yell, when a red hand covered his mouth and another red hand half throttled him.  Petawanaquat bundled the poor child into the bottom of his canoe, wrapped a leather coat round his head, spread a buffalo robe over him, gave him a smart rap on the head to keep him quiet, and paddled easily out into the stream.  Steadily, but not too swiftly, he went down the river, down the rapids, and past the Indian settlement without attracting particular notice.  Once the buffalo robe moved; the paddle descended on it with a sounding whack, and it did not move again. Before night closed, the Indian was paddling over the broad bosom of Lake Winnipeg.  Of course, Tony was soon missed; his haunts were well known; Miss Trim traced his footprints to the place where he had been seized, saw evidences of the struggle, the nature of which she correctly guessed, and came shrieking back to the house, where she went off into hysterics, and was unable to tell anything about the matter.  Fortunately, Victor was there; he also traced the footsteps.  Instead of returning home he ran straight to the school-house, which he reached out of breath.  \"Come, Ian, come!\" he gasped.  \"Tony's been carried off--Petawanaquat! Bring your canoe and gun; all the ammunition you can lay hands on!\"  Ian asked for no explanations; he ran into the house, shouldered a small bag of pemmican, gave his gun and ammunition to Victor, told his assistant to keep the school going till his return, and ran with his friend down to the river, where his own birch canoe lay on the bank.  A few minutes sufficed to launch it.  Both Ian and Victor were expert canoe-men.  Straining their powers to the utmost, they were soon far down the Red River, in hot pursuit of the fugitive.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE PURSUIT BEGINS.  There is something delightfully exhilarating in a chase, whether it be after man or beast.  How the blood careers!  How the nerves tingle!  But you know all about it, reader.  We have said sufficient.  There was enough of righteous indignation in Victor's bosom to have consumed Petawanaquat, and ground enough to justify the fiercest resolves.  Was not the kidnapper a redskin--a low, mean, contemptible savage?  Was not the kidnapped one his brother--his \"own\" brother?  And such a brother!  One of a thousand, with mischief enough in him, if rightly directed, to make half a dozen ordinary men!  The nature of the spirit which animated Victor was obvious on his compressed lips, his frowning brows, his gleaming eyes.  The strength of his muscles was indicated by the foam that fled from his paddle.  Ian Macdonald was not less excited, but more under self-control than his friend.  There was a fixed look in his plain but pleasant face, and a tremendous sweep in his long arms as he plied the paddle, that told of unfathomed energy.  The canoe being a mere egg-shell, leaped forward at each quick stroke \"like a thing of life.\"  There was no time to lose.  They knew that, for the Indian had probably got a good start of them, and, being a powerful man, animated by the certainty of pursuit sooner or later, would not only put his strength but his endurance to the test.  If they were to overtake him it must be by superhuman exertion.  Lake Winnipeg was twenty miles off.  They must catch up the Indian before he reached it, as otherwise it would be impossible to tell in which direction he had gone.  They did not pause to make inquiries of the settlers on the banks by the way, but they hailed several canoes, whose occupants said they had seen the Indian going quietly down stream some hours before--alone in his canoe!  \"Never mind, Vic, push on,\" said Ian; \"of course he would make Tony lie flat down.\"  The end of the settlement was passed, and they swept on into the wilderness beyond.  Warming to their work, they continued to paddle hour after hour--steadily, persistently, with clockwork regularity of stroke, but never decreasing force.  To save time they, as it were, cut off corners at the river-bends, and just shaved the points as they went by.  \"Have a care, Ian!\" exclaimed Victor, at one of these places, as his paddle touched the bottom.  \"We don't draw much water, to be sure, but a big stone might--hah!\"  A roar of dismay burst from the youth and his companion as the canoe rasped over a stone.  We have said that the birch canoe was an egg-shell.  The word is scarcely figurative.  The slightest touch over a stone has a tendency to rip the bark of such a slender craft, or break off the resinous gum with which the seams are pitched.  Water began to pour in.  \"Too bad!\" exclaimed Victor, flinging his paddle ashore, as he stepped over the side into water not much above his ankles, and pulled the canoe slowly to land.  \"An illustration of the proverb, `The more haste the less speed,'\" sighed Ian, as he stepped into the water and assisted in lifting the canoe tenderly to dry ground.  \"Oh, it's all very well for you to take it philosophically, but you know our chance is gone.  If it was _your_ brother we were after you wouldn't be so cool.\"  \"He is Elsie's brother,\" replied Ian, \"and that makes me quite as keen as if he were my own, besides keeping me cool.  Come, Vic, don't be cross, but light the fire and get out the gum.\"  While he spoke Ian was actively untying a bundle which contained awls and wattape, a small pliable root, with which to repair the injury.  The gum had to be melted, so that Victor found some relief to his feelings in kindling a fire.  The break was not a bad one.  With nimble fingers Ian sewed a patch of bark over it.  While that was being done, Victor struck a light with flint and steel, and soon had a blazing firebrand ready.  \"Hand it here, Vic,\" said Ian.  He covered the stitches with melted gum, blew the charcoal red-hot, passed it here and there over the old seams where they exhibited signs of leakage, and in little more than half an hour had the canoe as tight as a bottle.  Once more they embarked and drove her like an arrow down stream.  But precious time had been lost, and it was dark when they passed from the river and rested on the bosom of the mighty fresh-water sea.  \"It's of no use going on without knowing which shore the redskin has followed,\" said Ian, as he suddenly ceased work and rested his paddle on the gunwale.  \"It's of no use to remain where we are,\" replied the impatient Victor, looking back at his comrade.  \"Yes, it is,\" returned Ian, \"the moon will rise in an hour or so and enable us to make observations; meanwhile we can rest.  Sooner or later we shall be compelled to rest.  It will be a wise economy of time to do so now when nothing else can be done.\"  Victor was so tired and sleepy by that time that he could scarcely reply.  Ian laughed quietly, and shoved the canoe among some reeds, where it lay on a soft bed.  At the same time he advised his companion to go to sleep without delay.  More than half asleep already, he obeyed in silence, waded to the shore, and sat down on a bank to take off his moccasins.  In this position and act he fell asleep.  \"Hallo!\" exclaimed Ian, coming up with the paddles and pemmican bag; \"too soon, Vic, too soon, lad,\" (he tumbled him over on the bank); \"come, one mouthful of grub first, then off with the moccasins, and down we go.\"  Victor picked himself up with a yawn.  On ordinary occasions a backwoodsman pays some little attention to the comforts of his encampment, but our heroes were in no condition to mind such trifles. They pulled off their wet moccasins, indeed, and put on dry ones, but having done that they merely groped in the dark for the flattest piece of ground in the"]]]
