Everything in fact that could be done by a commander who knew his duty had been done for the safety of the ship--so would the captain have said probably, had he lived to be questioned as to the management of his vessel.  But everything had _not_ been done.  The lead, strange to say, had not been hove.  It was ready to heave, but the order was delayed. Unaccountable fatality!  The only safe guide that remained to the good ship on that wild night was held in abeyance.  It was deemed unnecessary to heave it yet, or it was troublesome, and they would wait till nearer the land.  No one now can tell the reasons that influenced the captain, but _the lead was not used_.  Owing to similar delay or neglect, hundreds upon hundreds of ships have been lost, and thousands of human lives have been sacrificed!  The ship passed like a dark phantom over the very head of the miner who was at work many fathoms below the bottom of the sea.  \"Land, ho!\" came suddenly in a fierce, quick shout from the mast-head.  \"Starboard! starboard--hard!\" cried the captain, as the roar of breakers ahead rose above the yelling of the storm.  Before the order was obeyed or another word spoken the ship struck, and a shriek of human terror followed, as the foremast went by the board with a fearful crash.  The waves burst over the stern, sweeping the decks fore and aft.  Wave after wave lifted the great ship as though it had been a child's toy, and dashed her down upon the rocks.  Her bottom was stove in, her planks and timbers were riven like matchwood.  Far down below man was destroying the flinty rock, while overhead the rock was destroying the handiwork of man!  But the destruction in the one case was slow, in the other swift.  A desperate but futile effort was made by the crew to get out the boats, and the passengers, many of whom were women and children, rushed frantically from the cabin to the deck, and clung to anything they could lay hold of, until strength failed, and the waves tore them away.  One man there was in the midst of all the terror-stricken crew who retained his self-possession in that dread hour.  He was a tall, stern old man with silver locks--an Indian merchant, one who had spent his youth and manhood in the wealthy land collecting gold--\"making a fortune,\" he was wont to say--and who was returning to his fatherland to spend it.  He was a thinking and calculating man, and in the anticipation of some such catastrophe as had actually overtaken him, he had secured some of his most costly jewels in a linen belt.  This belt, while others were rushing to the boats, the old man secured round his waist, and then sprang on deck, to be swept, with a dozen of his fellow-passengers, into the sea by the next wave that struck the doomed vessel.  There was no one on that rugged coast to lend a helping hand. Lifeboats did not then, as now, nestle in little nooks on every part of our dangerous coasts.  No eye was there to see nor ear to hear, when, twenty minutes after she struck, the East-Indiaman went to pieces, and those of her crew and passengers who had retained their hold of her uttered their last despairing cry, and their souls returned to God who gave them.  It is a solemn thought that man may with such awful suddenness, and so unexpectedly, be summoned into the presence of his Maker.  Thrice happy they who, when their hearts grow chill and their grasps relax as the last plank is rending, can say, \"Neither death, nor life, nor any other creature, is able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"  The scene we have described was soon over, and the rich cargo of the East-Indiaman was cast upon the sea and strewn upon the shore, affording much work for many days to the coastguard, and greatly exciting the people of the district--most of whom appeared to entertain an earnest belief in the doctrine that everything cast by storms upon their coast ought to be considered public property.  Portions of the wreck had the name \"Trident\" painted on them, and letters found in several chests which were washed ashore proved that the ship had sailed from Calcutta, and was bound for the port of London.  One little boy alone escaped the waves.  He was found in a crevice of the cliffs the following day, with just enough vitality left to give a few details of the wreck.  Although all possible care was bestowed on him, he died before night.  Thus sudden and complete was the end of as fine a ship as ever spread her canvas to the breeze.  At night she had been full of life--full of wealth; in the morning she was gone--only a few bales and casks and broken spars to represent the wealth, and stiffened corpses to tell of the life departed.  So she came and went, and in a short time all remnants of her were carried away.  One morning, a few weeks after the night of the storm, Maggot the smith turned himself in his bed at an early hour, and, feeling disinclined to slumber, got up to look at the state of the weather.  The sun was just rising, and there was an inviting look about the morning which induced the man to dress hastily and go out.  Maggot was a powerfully-built man, rough in his outer aspect as well as in his inner man, but by no means what is usually termed a bad man, although, morally speaking, he could not claim to be considered a good one.  In fact, he was a hearty, jolly, reckless fisherman, with warm feelings, enthusiastic temperament, and no principle; a man who, though very ready to do a kind act, had no particular objection to do one that was decidedly objectionable when it suited his purpose or served his present interest.  He was regarded by his comrades as one of the greatest madcaps in the district.  Old Maggot was, as we have said, a blacksmith to trade, but he had also been bred a miner, and was something of a fisherman as well, besides being (like most of his companions) an inveterate smuggler.  He could turn his hand to almost anything, and was \"everything by turns, but nothing long.\"  Sauntering down to Priests Cove, on the south of Cape Cornwall, with his hands in his pockets and his sou'-wester stuck carelessly on his shaggy head, he fell in with a comrade, whom he hailed by the name of John Cock.  This man was also a fisherman, _et cetera_, and the bosom friend and admirer of Maggot.  \"Where bound to this mornin', Jack?\" inquired Maggot.  \"To fish,\" replied John.  \"I go with 'ee, booy,\" said Maggot.  This was the extent of the conversation at that time.  They were not communicative, but walked side by side in silence to the beach, where they launched their little boat and rowed out to sea.  Presently John Cock looked over his shoulder and exclaimed--\"Maggot, I see summat.\"  \"Do 'ee?\"  \"Iss do I.\"  \"What do un look like?\"  \"Like a dead corp.\"  \"Aw, my dear,\" said Maggot, \"lev us keep away.  It can do no good to we.\"  Acting on this opinion the men rowed past the object that was floating on the sea, and soon after began to fish; but they had not fished long when the dead body, drifted probably by some cross-current, appeared close to them again.  Seeing this they changed their position, but ere long the body again appeared.  \"P'raps,\" observed Maggot, \"there's somethin' in its pockets.\"  As the same idea had occurred to John Cock, the men resolved to examine the body, so they rowed up to it and found it to be that of an elderly man, much decomposed, and nearly naked.  A very short examination sufficed to show that the pockets of such garments as were still upon it were empty, and the men were about to let it go again, when Maggot exclaimed--  \"Hold fast, Jack, I see somethin' tied round the waist of he; a sort o' belt it do seem.\"  The belt was quickly removed and the body released, when it sank with a heavy plunge, but ere long reappeared on the surface.  The fishermen rowed a considerable distance away from it, and then shipped their oars and examined the belt, which was made of linen.  Maggot sliced it up as he would have ripped up a fish, and laid bare, to the astonished gaze of himself and his friend, a number of glittering gems of various colours, neatly and firmly embedded in cotton, besides a variety of rings and small brooches set with precious stones.  \"Now, I tell 'ee,\" said Maggot, \"'tis like as this here will make our fortin', or else git we into trouble.\"  \"Why, whatever shud we git into trouble 'bout it for?\" said John Cock. \"'Tis like as not they ain't real--only painted glass, scarce wuth the trouble o' car'in' ashore.\"  \"Hould thy tongue, thee g'eat chucklehead,\" replied Maggot; \"a man wouldn't go for to tie such stuff round his waist to drown hisself with, I do know, if they worn't real.  Lev us car' 'em to Maister Donnithorne.\"  John Cock replied with a nod, and the two men, packing up the jewels, pulled in-shore as fast as possible.  Hauling their boat beyond the reach of the surf, they hastened to St. Just, and requested a private audience of Mr Donnithorne.  [See note 1.]  That excellent gentleman was not unaccustomed to give private audiences to fishermen, and, as has been already hinted at the beginning of this tale, was reported to have private dealings with them also--of a very questionable nature.  He received the two men, however, with the hearty air of a man who knows that the suspicions entertained of him by the calumnious world are false.  \"Well, Maggot,\" said Mr Donnithorne, \"what is your business with me? You are not wont to be astir so early, if all be true that is reported of 'ee.\"  \"Plaise, sur,\" said Maggot, with a glance at Rose Ellis, who sat sewing near the window, \"I'm come to talk 'bout private matters--if--\"  \"Leave us, Rose dear, for a little,\" said the old gentleman.  As soon as she was out of the room Maggot locked the door, a proceeding which surprised Mr Donnithorne not a little, but his surprise was much greater when the man drew a small parcel from the breast of his rough coat, and, unrolling it, displayed the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21726"],["title","Deep Down, a Tale of the Cornish Mines (#8)"],["body","jewels of which he had so unexpectedly become possessed.  \"Where got you these?\" inquired Mr Donnithorne, turning them over carefully.  \"Got 'em in the say--catched 'em, sure 'nough,\" said Maggot.  \"Not with a baited hook, I warrant,\" said the old gentleman.  \"Come, my son, let's hear all about it.\"  Maggot explained how he had obtained the jewels, and then asked what they were worth.  \"I can't tell that,\" said Mr Donnithorne, shaking his head gravely. \"Some of them are undoubtedly of value; the others, for all I know, may not be worth much.\"  \"Come now, sur,\" said Maggot, with a confidential leer, \"it's not the fust time we have done a bit o' business.  I 'spose I cud claim salvage on 'em?\"  \"I don't know that,\" said the old gentleman; \"you cannot tell whom they belonged to, and I suspect Government would claim them, if--But, by the way, I suppose you found no letters--nothing in the shape of writing on the body?\"  \"Nothin' whatsomever.\"  \"Well, then, I fear that--\"  \"Come now, sur,\" said Maggot boldly; \"'spose you gives John and me ten pounds apaice an' kape 'em to yourself to make what 'ee can of 'em?\"  Mr Donnithorne shook his head and hesitated.  Often before had he defrauded the revenue by knowingly purchasing smuggled brandy and tobacco, and by providing the funds to enable others to smuggle them; but then the morality of that day in regard to smuggling was very lax, and there were men who, although in all other matters truly honest and upright, could not be convinced of the sinfulness of smuggling, and smiled when they were charged with the practice, but who, nevertheless, would have scorned to steal or tell a downright lie.  This, however, was a very different matter from smuggling.  The old gentleman shrank from it at first, and could not meet the gaze of the smuggler with his usual bold frank look.  But the temptation was great.  The jewels he suspected were of immense value, and his heart readily replied to the objections raised by his conscience, that after all there was no one left to claim them, and he had a much better right to them, in equity if not in law, than Government; and as to the fellows who found them--why, the sum they asked would be a great and rich windfall to them, besides freeing them from all further trouble, as well as transferring any risk that might accrue from their shoulders to his own.  While the old gentleman was reasoning thus with himself, Maggot stood anxiously watching his countenance and twisting the cloth that had enclosed the jewellery into a tight rope, as he shifted his position uneasily.  At length old Mr Donnithorne said--  \"Leave the jewels with me, and call again in an hour from this time. You shall then have my answer.\"  Maggot and his friend consented to this delay, and left the room.  No sooner were they gone than the old gentleman called his wife, who naturally exclaimed in great surprise on beholding the table covered with such costly trinkets--  \"Where _ever_ did you get these, Tom?\"  Mr Donnithorne explained, and then asked what she thought of Maggot's proposal.  \"Refuse it,\" said she firmly.  \"But, my dear--\"  \"Don't `but' about it, Tom.  Whenever a man begins to `but' with sin, it is sure to butt him over on his back.  Have nothing to do with it, _I_ say.\"  \"But, my dear, it is not dishonest--\"  \"I don't know that,\" interrupted Mrs Donnithorne vigorously; \"you think that smuggling is not dishonest, but I do, and so does the minister.\"  \"What care _I_ for the minister?\" cried the old gentleman, losing his temper; \"who made _him a_ judge of my doings?\"  \"He is an expounder of God's Word,\" said Mrs Donnithorne firmly, \"and holds that `Thou shalt not steal' is one of the Ten Commandments.\"  \"Well, well, he and I don't agree, that's all; besides, has he never expounded to you that obedience to your husband is a virtue? a commandment, I may say, which you are--\"  \"Mr Donnithorne,\" said the lady with dignity, \"I am here at your request, and am now complying with your wishes in giving my opinion.\"  \"There, there, Molly,\" said the subdued husband, giving his better half a kiss, \"don't be so sharp.  You ought to have been a lawyer with your powerful reasoning capacity.  However, let me tell you that you don't understand these matters--\"  \"Then why ask my advice, Tom?\"  \"Why, woman, because an inexplicable fatality leads me to consult you, although I know well enough what the upshot will be.  But I'm resolved to close with Maggot.\"  \"I knew you would,\" said Mrs Donnithorne quietly.  The last remark was the turning-point.  Had the good lady condescended to be _earnest_ in her entreaties that the bargain should not be concluded, it is highly probable her husband would have given in; but her last observation nettled him so much that he immediately hoisted a flag of defiance, nailed it to the mast, and went out in great indignation to search for Maggot.  That individual was not far off.  The bargain was completed, the jewels were locked up in one of the old gentleman's secret repositories, and the fishermen, with ten pounds apiece in their pockets, returned home.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.  It may be well here to inform the reader that the finding of the jewels as here described, and the consequences which followed, are founded on fact.    CHAPTER SIX.  TREATS OF THE MINER'S COTTAGE, WORK, AND COSTUME.  Maggot's home was a disordered one when he reached it, for his youngest baby, a fat little boy, had been seized with convulsions, and his wife and little daughter Grace, and son Zackey, and brother-in-law David Trevarrow, besides his next neighbour Mrs Penrose, with her sixteen children, were all in the room, doing their best by means of useless or hurtful applications, equally useless advice, and intolerable noise and confusion, to cure, if not to kill, the baby.  Maggot's cottage was a poor one, his furniture was mean, and there was not much of it; nevertheless its inmates were proud of it, for they lived in comparative comfort there.  Mrs Maggot was a kind-hearted, active woman, and her husband--despite his smuggling propensities--was an affectionate father.  Usually the cottage was kept in a most orderly condition; but on the present occasion it was, as we have said, in a state of great confusion.  \"Fetch me a bit of rag, Grace,\" cried Mrs Maggot, just as her husband entered.  \"Here's a bit, old 'ooman,\" said Maggot, handing her the linen cloth in which the jewels had been wrapped up, and which he had unconsciously retained in his hands on quitting Mr Donnithorne--\"Run, my dear man,\" he added, turning to John Cock, \"an' fetch the noo doctor.\"  John darted away, and in a quarter of an hour returned with Oliver Trembath, who found that the baby had weathered the storm by the force of its own constitution, despite the adverse influences that were around it.  He therefore contented himself with clearing the place of intruders, and prescribing some simple medicine.  \"Are you going to work?\" inquired Oliver of David Trevarrow, observing that the man was about to quit the cottage.  \"Iss, sur--to Botallack.\"  \"Then I will accompany you.  Captain Dan is going to show me over part of the mine to-day.  Good-morning, Mrs Maggot, and remember my directions if this should happen to the little fellow again.\"  Leaving the cottage the two proceeded through the town to the north end of it, accompanied by Maggot, who said he was going to the forge to do a bit of work, and who parted from them at the outskirts of the town.  \"Times are bad with you at the mines just now, I find,\" said Oliver as they walked along.  \"Iss sur, they are,\" replied Trevarrow, in the quiet tone that was peculiar to him; \"but, thank God, we do manage to live, though there are some of us with a lot o' child'n as finds it hard work.  The Bal [The mine] ain't so good as she once was.\"  \"I suppose that you have frequent changes of fortune?\" said Oliver.  The miner admitted that this was the case, for that sometimes a man worked underground for several weeks without getting enough to keep his family, while at other times he might come on a bunch of copper or tin which would enable him to clear 50 pounds or more in a month.  \"If report says truly,\" observed Oliver, \"you have hit upon a `keenly lode,' as you call it, not many days ago.\"  \"A do look very well now, sur,\" replied the miner, \"but wan can never tell.  I did work for weeks in the level under the say without success, so I guv it up an went to Wheal Hazard, and on the back o' the fifty-fathom level I did strike 'pon a small lode of tin 'bout so thick as my finger.  It may get better, or it may take the bit in its teeth and disappear; we cannot tell.\"  \"Well, I wish you good luck,\" said Oliver; \"and here comes Captain Dan, so I'll bid you good-morning.\"  \"Good-morning, sur,\" said the stout-limbed and stout-hearted man, with a smile and a nod, as he turned off towards the moor-house to put on his mining garments.  Towards this house a number of men had been converging while Oliver and his companion approached it, and the former observed, that whatever colour the men might be on entering it, they invariably came out light red, like lobsters emerging from a boiling pot.  In Botallack mine a large quantity of iron is mingled with the tin ore. This colours everything in and around the mine, including men's clothes, hands, and faces, with a light rusty-red.  The streams, of course, are also coloured with it, and the various pits and ponds for collecting the fluid mud of tin ore seem as if filled with that nauseous compound known by the name of \"Gregory's Mixture.\"  In the moor-house there were rows of pegs with red garments hung thereon to dry, and there were numerous broad-shouldered men dressing and undressing--in every stage of the process; while in a corner two or three were washing their bodies in a tank of water.  These last were men who had been at work all night, and were cleansing"]]]
