Yes, love is a woman's whole life.  Some modern women might object to this. They might say that this was true of the woman of the past, who was excluded from all other avenues of human activity. The woman of the present day has other interests besides those of Love. But I claim that this is true of only a small percentage of women; and in even this small minority of women, social, scientific and artistic activities cannot take the place of love; no matter how busy and successful these women may be, they will tell you if you enjoy their confidence that they are unhappy, if their love life is unsatisfactory. Nothing, nothing can fill the void made by the lack of love. The various activities may help to cover up the void, to protect it from strange eyes, they cannot fill it. For essentially woman is made for love. Not exclusively, but essentially, and a woman who has had no love in her life has been a failure. The few exceptions that may be mentioned only emphasize the rule.  But not only psychically is a woman's love and sex life more important than a man's, physically she is also much more cognizant of her sex and much more hampered by the manifestation of her sex nature than man is. To take but one function, menstruation. From the age 13 or 14 to the age of forty-five or fifty it is a monthly reminder to woman that she is a woman, that she is a creature of sex; and, while to many women this periodically recurring function is only a source of some annoyance or discomfort, to a great number it is a cause of pain, headache, suffering, or complete disability. Man has no such phenomenon to annoy him practically his whole life.  But more important are the results of love-union, of sex relations. A man after a sexual relation is just as free as he was before. A woman, if the relation has resulted in a pregnancy, which is generally the case, unless special pains are taken it should not so result, has nine troublesome months before her, months of discomfort if not of actual suffering; she then has an extremely trying and painful ordeal, that of childbirth, and then there is another trying period, the period of lactation or of nursing and of bringing up the baby. The penalty seems almost too great.  And when the woman is on the point of ceasing to menstruate she does not do so smoothly and comfortably. She has to go through a period called the menopause, which may last one or two years and which may bring discomforts and dangers of its own. Man does not have to go through such a distinct period of demarcation separating his sexual from his non-sexual life. Altogether it cannot be denied that woman is much more a slave of her sex nature than man is of his. Yes, Nature has handicapped woman much more heavily than she has man.  In short, both in view of the fact that sexual ignorance with its possible missteps has much more disastrous consequences for the girl than it has for the boy, and in view of the fact that the sex instinct and its physical and psychic manifestations occupy a much more important part in woman's life than they do in the life of man, we consider the necessity of sex instruction much greater in the case of woman than in the case of man. I do not wish to be misunderstood as underestimating the need of sex instruction for the male--only I consider the need even greater in the case of the female.     CHAPTER TWO  THE FEMALE SEX ORGANS: THEIR ANATOMY   The Internal Sex Organs--The Ovaries--The Fallopian Tubes--The   Uterus--The Divisions of the Uterus--Anteversion, Anteflexion,   Retroversion, Retroflexion, of the Uterus--Endometritis--The   Vagina--The Hymen--Imperforate Hymen--The External Genitals--The   Vulva, Labia Majora, Labia Minora, the Mons Veneris, the   Clitoris, the Urethra--The Breasts--The Pelvis--The Difference   Between the Male and Female Pelvis.   The organs which primarily distinguish one sex from the other are the sex organs. It is by the aid of the sex organs that children are begotten and brought into the world, that the race is _reproduced_ and perpetuated. It is for this reason that the sex organs are also called the Reproductive Organs.  The first thing we must do is to become familiar with the _structure_ and _location_ of the sex organs; in other words, we must get a fair idea of their _Anatomy_.  The female sex organs, also called the reproductive or generative organs, are divided into internal and external. The internal are the most important and consist of: the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, uterus or womb, and vagina. The external sex organs of the female are: the vulva, hymen, and clitoris. Among the external organs are also generally included the mons Veneris and the breasts or mammary glands.   SUBCHAPTER A  THE INTERNAL SEX ORGANS      [Illustration: OVARY.]  =The Ovaries.= The ovaries are the essential organs of reproduction. For it is they that generate the eggs, or _ova_, or _ovules_, which, after becoming _fertilized_ or _fecundated_ by the spermatozoa of the male, develop into children. Without the ovaries of the female, the same as without the testicles of the male (to which they correspond), no children could be begotten, and the entire human race would quickly disappear from our planet. The ovaries are two in number; they are embedded in the _broad ligaments_ which support the womb in the pelvis, one on each side of the womb. They are of a grayish or whitish pink color, and are about an inch and a half long, three-quarters of an inch wide, and one-third of an inch thick. They weigh from one-eighth to one-quarter of an ounce. Their surface is either smooth or rough and puckered. Think of a large blanched almond and you will have a pretty fair idea of the size and shape of an ovary.  =The Fallopian Tubes.= The Fallopian tubes (so called from Fallopius, a great anatomist, who discovered them; also called oviducts: egg conductors, because they conduct the eggs from the ovary into the uterus) are two very thin tubes, extending one from each upper angle of the womb to the ovaries; but at their ovarian end they expand into a fringed and trumpet-shaped extremity. The fringes are referred to as _fimbria_. They are about five inches long and only about one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter; the function of the tubes is to catch the ova as they burst forth from the ovaries and to convey them to the uterus. Taking into consideration the very narrow _lumen_, or _caliber_, of the Fallopian tubes, it is easy to understand why even a very slight inflammation is apt to clog them up, to seal their mouths or openings, thus rendering the woman _sterile_, or incapable of having children. For, if the Fallopian tubes are \"clogged\" up, the eggs, or ova, have no way of reaching the uterus.  The Greek name for the Fallopian tube is salpinx (salpinx in Greek means tube). An inflammation of the Fallopian tube is therefore called salpingitis. (A salpingitis has the same effect in causing sterility in the female as has an epididymitis in the male.) Salpingectomy is the cutting away of the whole or of a piece of the Fallopian tube (corresponds to vasectomy in the male).  =The Uterus.= The uterus or womb is the organ in which the fertilized ovum, or egg, grows and develops into a child. It is a hollow muscular organ, about the size of a pear, with thick walls, capable under the influence of pregnancy of great expansion and growth. The broad part of the pear is called the _body_ of the uterus; the lower narrow part is called the _neck_ of the uterus, or _cervix_. The uterus in the adult girl or woman is about three inches long, two inches broad in its upper part and nearly an inch thick. It weighs from an ounce to an ounce and a half. When the uterus is in a pregnant condition, it increases enormously, both in size and in weight, as we will see in a future chapter. The cavity of the uterus is somewhat triangular in shape; at each upper angle is the small opening communicating with the Fallopian tube; the upper portion of the uterus is called the fundus; the external opening of the womb, situated in the center of the cervix, is called the mouth of the womb, or the _os_, or external os.     [Illustration: 1. OPENINGS INTO THE FALLOPIAN TUBES. 2. MOUTH OF    THE WOMB.]  The uterus is situated in the center of the pelvis, between the bladder and the rectum. It is supported by certain ligaments, the chief of which are the broad ligaments; but, on account of general weakness, too hard physical labor, or lifting heavy weights, the ligaments may stretch, and the uterus may sink down low in the vagina, and we then have the condition known as prolapse of the womb. Or, the womb may turn forward, when we have a condition of _anteversion_. If the womb is _bent_ (or _flexed_) forward on itself the condition is called _anteflexion_. If the womb is turned backwards, the condition is called _retroversion_; if it is bent or flexed backward upon itself the condition is called _retroflexion_. An extreme degree of anteversion or anteflexion, or retroversion or retroflexion, may interfere with impregnation, as the spermatozoa may find it difficult or impossible to reach the opening of the womb--the external os.      [Illustration: (Female Reproductive Organs)]  The entire cavity of the uterus is lined by a mucous membrane;[1] this mucous membrane is called the endometrium (endo--within; metra--uterus). An inflammation of the endometrium is called _endometritis_. It is the endometrium that is principally concerned in menstruation--that is, it is from it that the monthly discharge of blood comes.  =The Vagina= [vagina in Latin--a sheath]. The vagina is the tube or canal which serves as a passage-way between the uterus and the outside of the body. It extends from the external genitals or vulva to the neck of the womb, embracing the latter for some distance. It is a strong, fibromuscular canal, lined with mucous"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21840"],["title","Woman (#5)"],["body","ne. It is not smooth inside, but arranged in folds, or _rugæ_, so that when necessary, as during childbirth, it can stretch enormously and permit the passage of a child's head. The length of the vaginal canal is between three and five inches, but it is in general much more capacious in women that have borne one or more children than in those who have not borne any.  Near the vaginal entrance are situated two small glands; they are about the size of a pea, and secrete mucus. They are called Bartholin's glands; occasionally they become inflamed and give a good deal of trouble.      [Illustration: ANTEVERSION OF THE UTERUS.]      [Illustration: ANTEFLEXION OF THE UTERUS.]      [Illustration: RETROVERSION OF THE UTERUS.]      [Illustration: RETROFLEXION OF THE UTERUS.]  =The Hymen= [hymen in Greek--a membrane]. The external opening of the vagina, in virgins, that is, in girls or women who have not had sexual intercourse, is almost entirely closed by a membrane called the hymen. The vulgar name for hymen is \"maidenhead.\" The hymen may be of various shapes, and of different consistency. In some girls it is a very thin membrane, which tears very readily; in others it is quite tough. On the upper margin or in the center of the hymen there is an opening which permits any secretion from the vagina and the blood from the uterus to come through. In rare cases there is no opening in the hymen, that is, the vagina is entirely closed. Such a hymen is called _imperforate_ (not perforated). When the girl begins to menstruate, the blood cannot come out and it accumulates in the vagina. In such cases the hymen must be opened or slit by a doctor. In some cases the hymen is congenitally absent; that is, the girl is born without any hymen. While the hymen is usually ruptured during the first intercourse, it, in some cases, being elastic and stretchable, persists untorn after sexual intercourse. It will therefore be seen that just as the presence of the hymen is no absolute proof of virginity, so is the absence of the hymen no absolute proof that the girl has had sexual relations, She might have been born without any hymen, or it might have been ruptured by vaginal examination, by a vaginal douche, by scratching to relieve itching, or by some accident.  The remains of the hymen after it is ruptured shrink and form little elevations which can be easily felt; they are known as caruncles. [In Latin, _carunculæ myrtiformes_, which means in English myrtleberry-shaped caruncles; caruncle is a small fleshy elevation; derived from _caro_, which in Latin means flesh.]   SUBCHAPTER B  THE EXTERNAL GENITALS  =The Vulva.= The external genitals of the female are called the _vulva_. The vulva consists of the labia majora (meaning the larger lips), which are on the outside and which in the grown-up girl are covered with hair, and the labia minora (the smaller lips), which are on the inside and which are usually only seen when the labia majora are taken apart.  [Vulva in Latin means folding-door. The ancients Were fond of giving fancy names to things.]  =The Mons Veneris.= The elevation above the vulva, which during puberty becomes covered with hair, is called by the fanciful name, _mons Veneris_, or Venus' mountain. It is usually well padded with fatty tissue.  =The Clitoris.= The clitoris is a small body about an inch in length, situated beneath the mons Veneris and partly or entirely covered by the upper borders of the labia minora.  =The Urethra.= Between the clitoris above and the opening of the vagina below is situated the opening of the _urethra_, or the urinary meatus, through which the urine passes. Many women are so ignorant, or, let us say innocent, that they think the urine passes out through the vagina. This is not so. The vagina has nothing to do with the process of urination.  Again enumerating the female sex organs, but in the reverse order, from before backward, or from out inward, we have: The mons Veneris and the labia majora, or the external lips of the vulva; these are the plainly visible parts of the female genital organs. When the labia majora are taken apart we see the labia minora; when the labia majora and minora are taken apart we can see or feel the clitoris and the hymen, or the remains of the hymen. We then have the vagina, a large, stretchable musculo-membranous canal, in the upper portion of which the neck of the womb, or the cervix, can be seen (when a speculum is used), or felt by the finger. Only the cervix, or neck of the womb, can be seen, but the rest of the womb, the broader portion, can be easily felt and examined by one hand in the vagina and the other hand over the abdomen. Continuous with the uterus are the Fallopian tubes, and below the trumpet-shaped ends of the Fallopian tubes are the ovaries, embedded in the broad ligaments, one on each side.  =The Breasts.= The breasts, also called mammary glands, or mammæ [mamma in Latin, breast], may be considered as accessory organs of reproduction. They are of no importance in the male, in whom they are usually rudimentary, but they are of great importance in the female. They manufacture milk, which is necessary for the proper nutrition of the infant, and they add a great deal to the beauty and attractiveness of the woman. They are thus a help to the woman in getting a mate or a husband. The projecting elevation of the breast, which the child takes in his mouth when nursing, is called the nipple; the darker colored area surrounding the nipple is called the areola.      [Illustration: THE PELVIS OF THE MALE.]      [Illustration: THE PELVIS OF THE FEMALE.]   SUBCHAPTER C  THE PELVIS  The internal sex organs are situated in the lower part of the abdominal cavity, the part that is called the _pelvis_, or pelvic cavity. The meaning of the word pelvis in Latin is basin. The pelvis, also referred to as the pelvic girdle or pelvic arch, forms a bony basin, and is composed of three powerful bones: the sacrum, consisting of five vertebræ fused together and constituting the solid part of the spine, or vertebral column, in the back, and the two hipbones, one on each side. The two hipbones meet in front, forming the _pubic arch_.  The hipbones are called in Latin the ossa innominata (nameless bones) and each hipbone is composed of three bones: the ilium, the ischium, and the os pubis. The thighs are attached to the hipbones, and to the hipbones are also attached the large _gluteal_ muscles, which form the buttocks, or the \"seat.\"  The pelvis of the female differs considerably from the pelvis of the male. The female pelvis is shallower and wider, less massive, the margins of the bones are more widely separated, thus giving greater prominence to the hips; the sacrum is shorter and less curved, and the pubic arch is wider and more rounded. All this is necessary in order to permit the child's head to pass through. If the female pelvis were exactly like the male pelvis, a full-term living child could never pass through it. The two illustrations show the differences between the male and female pelvis very clearly.  Note particularly the differences in the pubic arches: in the male pelvis it is really more of an angle than an arch. Also note how much longer and more solid the sacrum (with its attached bone, called the coccyx[2]) is in the male pelvis. The differences in the pelves (the plural of pelvis is pelves) of the male and female become fully marked at puberty, but they are present as early as the fourth month of intra-uterine life.  FOOTNOTES:  [1] Mucous membrane--briefly a membrane which secretes mucus or some other fluid.  [2] The coccyx consists of three rudimentary vertebræ; it is the vestige of an organ which we once possessed in common with many other animals, namely--a tail.     CHAPTER THREE  THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE FEMALE SEX ORGANS   Function of the Ovaries--Internal Secretion of the   Ovaries--Function of the Internal Secretion--Number of Ova in the   Ovaries--The Graafian Follicles--Ovulation--Corpora   Lutea--Function of the Fallopian Tubes--Function of the   Vagina--Functions of the Vulva, Clitoris and Mons   Veneris--Function of the Breasts--Besides Secreting Milk Breast   Has Sexual Function--The Orgasm--Pollutions in Women--Secondary   Sex Characters--Differences Between Woman and Man.   The importance of an organ depends upon its _function_, upon what it does, and not so much upon what it is. It is important to know the size, structure and location of an organ, but it is still more important to know its function; in other words, for our purpose it is more important to know the _physiology_ than the anatomy of the sex organs.   SUBCHAPTER A  FUNCTION OF THE OVARIES  Like the testicles in man, so the ovaries in woman are the essential sexual organs. They are the fundamental organs, without which the other sexual organs are useless. Also like the testicles in man, the ovaries have two distinct functions, manufacturing two distinct substances. One function is to manufacture eggs; this, called the oögenetic or egg-producing function, is its _racial_ function; without it the race could not perpetuate itself. But the ovary has also an _individual_ function. Besides the ova, the ovary manufactures what we call an _internal_ secretion which is absorbed by the blood, and which is of the greatest importance to the woman herself. While the manufacture of ova begins only at puberty, with menstruation, and closes at the menopause, the manufacture of the internal secretion lasts throughout the woman's entire life. This secretion, which consists of various chemical substances, has a tremendous influence not only on the development of the woman's body, but also on her feelings.  First of all it is necessary for the development of the woman's special characteristics, or _secondary sexual characters_. Without that internal secretion of the ovaries, a woman would look more or less like a man; she would not develop her beautiful rounded form, her pretty long hair, her breasts,"]]]
