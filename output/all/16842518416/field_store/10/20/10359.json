They were decidedly and unaccountably amiable.  They not only permitted the white men to land, but assisted them in warping the ship into a place of shelter, as well as in landing provisions and stores.  Fletcher Christian, whatever his faults may have been, seems to have had peaceful tendencies.  He had not only secured the friendship of the Otaheitans by his just and considerate treatment of them while engaged in barter, but he now managed to conciliate some of the chiefs of Toubouai.  As a precaution, however, he set about building an entrenched fortress, in the labours connected with which he took his full share of work with the men.  While the building was in progress the natives, despite the friendly chiefs, threw off the mask of good-will, which had doubtless been put on for the purpose of getting the white men into their power.  Strong in overwhelming numbers, they made frequent attacks on the mutineers, which these latter, being strong in arms, successfully repelled.  It soon became evident that warfare, not peace, was to be the lot of the residents on Toubouai, and, finally, it was agreed that the _Bounty_ should be got ready for sea, and the whole party should return to Otaheite.  The resolution was soon carried into effect, and the mutineers ere long found themselves once again drawing near to the island.  As they approached it under full sail, for the wind was light, the men stood looking at it, commenting on its beauty and the amiableness of its people, but Fletcher Christian stood apart by himself, with his back to the shore, gazing in the opposite direction.  Edward Young went up to him.  \"If this breeze holds, sir, we shall soon be at anchor in our old quarters.\"  The midshipman spoke in the respectful tone of one addressing his superior officer.  Indeed, although Christian had, by his rash and desperate act of mutiny, forfeited his position, and lowered himself to a level with the worst of his associates, he never lost their respect. It is recorded that they styled him _Mister_ Christian to the end.  \"At anchor!\" said Christian, in a tone of deepest despondency.  \"Ah, Edward Young, there is no anchorage for us now in this world!  We may anchor in Matavai Bay to-night, but it will only be to up anchor and off again in a few days.\"  \"Come, come, sir,\" said Young, heartily, \"don't give way to despondency. You know we were driven to act as we did, and it can't be helped now.\"  \"_We_ were driven!  My poor fellow,\" returned Christian, laying a hand on the midshipman's shoulder, \"_you_ had no part in this miserable business.  It is I who have drawn you all into it, but--well, well, as you say, it can't be helped now.  We must make the best of it,--God help us!\"  He spoke in a low, soft tone of profound sadness, and continued his wistful gaze over the stern of the _Bounty_.  Presently he looked quickly round, and, taking Young's arm, began to pace the deck while he spoke to him.  \"As you say, Edward, we shall anchor once more in Matavai Bay, but I am firmly resolved not to remain there.\"  \"I'm sorry to hear it, sir,\" said Young, \"for most of the men are as firmly resolved to stay, and you know several of them are resolute, not to say desperate, characters.\"  \"I am quite aware of that, but I shall make a proposal to them, which I think they will accept.  I will first of all propose to leave Otaheite for some safer place of refuge, and when they object to that, I will propose to divide the whole of the ship's stores and property among us all, landing that portion which belongs to those who elect to remain on the island, and sailing away with the rest, and with those who choose to follow my fortunes, to seek a more distant and a safer home.\"  \"That may perhaps suit them,\" said Young.  \"Suit _them_,\" rejoined Christian, with a quick glance; \"then _you_ don't count yourself one of them?\"  \"No,\" returned the midshipman with a frank look, \"I will follow you now, sir, to the end.  How far I am guilty is a question that does not concern me at present.  If the British Government gets hold of me, my fate is sealed.  I am in the same boat with yourself, Mr Christian, and I mean to stick by it.\"  There was a strange spasm on Christian's countenance, as if of conflicting emotions, while he grasped the youth's hand and squeezed it.  \"Thank you, Edward, thank you.  Go now and see the anchor cleared to let go.\"  He descended quickly to the cabin, while the unfortunate midshipman went forward to give the order.  When the proposal just referred to was made the following day, after landing at Otaheite, it was at once agreed to.  Peter Heywood, Stewart, Morrison, and others who had taken no active part in the mutiny, were glad to have the prospect of being enabled, sooner or later, to make a voluntary surrender of themselves, while the thoughtless and reckless among the men were well pleased to have done with uncertain wanderings, and to be allowed to settle among their amiable native friends.  Preparations for instant departure were made by Christian and those who chose to follow his lead.  The contents of the _Bounty_ were landed and fairly divided; then the vessel was got ready for her final voyage. Those who resolved to sail in her were as follows:--    Fletcher Christian, formerly acting lieutenant--age 24.   Edward Young, midshipman--age 22.   John Adams, seaman--age 22.   William McCoy, seaman--age 25.   Matthew Quintal, seaman--age 21.   John Williams, seaman--age 25.   Isaac Martin, seaman--age 30.   John Mills, gunner's mate--age 40.   William Brown, botanist's assistant--age 27.  All these had married native women of Otaheite, who agreed to forsake home and kindred and follow the fortunes of their white husbands.  There were also six native men who consented to accompany them.  Their names were Talaloo, Ohoo, Timoa, Nehow, Tetaheite, and Menalee.  Three of these had wives, and one of the wives had a baby girl by a former husband.  The European sailors named the infant Sally.  She was a round light-brown embodiment of gleeful impudence, and had barely reached the staggering age of infancy when taken on board the _Bounty_ to begin her strange career.  Thus the party consisted of twenty-eight souls--namely, nine mutineers, six native men, twelve native women, and the light-brown baby.  It was a pleasant bright morning in September 1790 when Fletcher Christian and his followers bade farewell to Otaheite.  For some time the breeze was light, and the _Bounty_ hovered round the Island as if loath to leave it.  In the dusk of evening a boat put off from her, pulled to the shore, and Christian landed, alone, near the house of a chief who had become the special friend of Peter Heywood and Stewart. With the two midshipmen he spent some time in earnest conversation.  \"I could not leave you,\" he said in conclusion, \"without relieving my mind of all that I have just said about the mutiny, because you are sure to be sent for and taken to England as soon as the intelligence of this sad affair reaches.  I advise you to go off at once to the first ship that may appear, and give yourselves up to the commander.\"  \"Such is our intention,\" said Heywood.  \"Right,\" rejoined Christian; \"you are both innocent.  No harm can come to you, for you took no part in the mutiny.  For me, my fate is fixed. I go to search for some remote and uninhabited island, where I hope to spend the remainder of my days without seeing the face of any Europeans except those who accompany me.  It is a dreary thought, lads, to lose country and kindred and friends for _ever_ by the act of one dark hour. Now, remember, Heywood, what I have told you to tell my friends.  God knows I do not plead guiltless; I am alone responsible for the mutiny, and I exonerate all, even my adherents, from so much as suggesting it to me; nevertheless, there are some who love me in England, to whom I would beg of you to relate the circumstances that I have told you.  These may extenuate though they cannot justify the crime I have committed.  I assure you, most solemnly, that almost up to the last I had no intention of doing more than making my own escape from the ship which the injustice and brutality of Bligh had made a place of torment to me. When you called me, Stewart, to relieve the watch, my brain seemed on fire, and it was when I found the two officers both asleep, who should have been on duty, that I suddenly made up my mind to take the ship. Now,\" concluded Christian, grasping the hands of the youths, \"I must say farewell.  I have done you grievous wrong.  God forgive me, and bless you.  Good-bye, Peter; good-bye, Stewart, good-bye.\"  He turned abruptly, stepped into his boat, and was rowed out to sea.  The young midshipmen, with moistened eyes, stood silently watching the boat until it reached the ship.  Then they saw the _Bounty_ steering away to the northward.  Before daylight was quite gone she had disappeared on the distant horizon.  Thus did Fletcher Christian and his comrades pass from the sight and ken of man, and they were not heard of after that for more than twenty years!  But you and I, reader, have a special privilege to follow up these mutineers.  Before doing so, however, let us note briefly what became of their comrades left on Otaheite.  These, to the number of sixteen, soon distributed themselves among the houses of their various friends, and proceeded to make themselves quite at home.  Some of them, however, were not disposed to take up a permanent abode there.  Among these was the boatswain's mate, James Morrison, a man of superior mental power and energy, who kept an interesting and graphic journal of events.  [See note.] He, with the armourer, cooper, carpenter's mate, and others, set to work to construct a small vessel, in which they meant to sail to Batavia, whence they hoped to procure a passage to England.  The natives opposed this at first, but on being told "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21747"],["title","The Lonely Island: The Refuge of the Mutineers (#4)"],["body","the vessel was only meant for pleasure trips round the island, they ceased their opposition, and watched with great wonder at the process of ship-building, which was carried on industriously from day to day.  During the progress of the work there was witnessed an interesting ceremony, which, according to custom, was annually performed by the chief of the district and a vast concourse of natives.  It shows how deeply the celebrated Captain Cook had gained the reverence and love of the people of Otaheite.  A picture of the circumnavigator, which had been presented to the islanders by the captain of a merchant vessel, was brought out with great ceremony and held up before the people, who, including their queen, Eddea, paid homage to it.  A ceremonial dance was also performed in its honour, and a long oration was pronounced by a leading chief, after which the portrait was returned to the care of an old man, who was its appointed custodian.  Long and earnestly did the white men labour at their little ship, and with equal, if not superior, earnestness did the natives flock from all parts of the island to see the wonderful work advance, bringing supplies of provisions to the whites as a sort of payment for admission to the show.  The vessel was completed and launched after months of toil, but its sails of matting were found to be so untrustworthy that the plan of proceeding in it to Batavia had to be given up.  Meanwhile, two of the worst of the mutineers, named Thompson and Churchill, came to a tragical end.  The former insulted a member of the family with whom he resided, and was knocked down.  He left them in high dudgeon, and went to that part of the island where the vessel above referred to was being built.  One day a canoe from a distant district touched there, and the owner landed with his wife and family, carrying his youngest child in his arms.  Thompson angrily ordered him to go away, but the man did not obey the order, whereupon Thompson seized his musket and shot father and child with the same bullet.  For this murder he was shunned with abhorrence by his comrades, and obliged to go off to another part of the island, accompanied by Churchill.  These two took up their abode with a chief who was a _tayo_, or sworn friend, of the latter.  This chief died shortly afterwards, leaving no children behind him; and Churchill, being his _tayo_, succeeded to his possessions and dignity, according to the custom of the country.  He did not, however, enjoy his new position long, for Thompson, from jealousy or some other cause, shot him.  The natives were so incensed at this that they arose _en masse_ and stoned Thompson to death.  While these events were occurring, a messenger of retribution was speeding over the sea to Otaheite.  On the morning of 23rd March 1791, exactly sixteen months after the landing of the mutineers, H.M.S. _Pandora_, Captain Edwards, sailed into Matavai Bay.  Before she had anchored, Coleman the armourer swam off to her, and Peter Heywood and Stewart immediately followed and surrendered themselves.  These, and all the mutineers, were immediately put in irons, and thrown into a specially prepared prison on the quarter-deck, named the \"Pandora's Box,\" in which they were conveyed to England.  We have not space to recount the stirring incidents of this remarkable and disastrous voyage, and the subsequent trial of the mutineers.  Let it suffice to say, that the _Pandora_, after spending three months in a fruitless search for the _Bounty_, was wrecked on the homeward voyage, and a large number of the crew and some of the prisoners were drowned, among whom was poor Stewart the midshipman.  The remainder of the crew were saved in the ship's boats, after performing a voyage which, as to its length and the sufferings endured, rivals that previously made by Bligh.  Thereafter, on reaching England, the mutineers were tried by court-martial; some were honourably acquitted, others were condemned to death but afterwards pardoned, and ultimately only three were executed.  Among those who were condemned, but afterwards pardoned as being unquestionably innocent, was Peter Heywood, whose admirable defence and correspondence with his family, especially that between himself and his charming sister Nessy, form a most interesting feature in the records of the trial; but all this must be passed over in silence, while we resume the thread of our story.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note.  Part of this journal is quoted in an excellent account of the _Mutineers of the Bounty_, by Lady Belcher.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE LONELY ISLAND SIGHTED.  It is pleasant to turn for a time from the dark doings of evil men to the contemplation of innocent infancy.  We return to the _Bounty_, and solicit the reader's attention to a plump brown ball which rolls about that vessel's deck, exhibiting a marked tendency to gravitate towards the lee scuppers.  This brown ball is Sally, the Otaheitan infant.  Although brown, Sally's face is extremely pretty, by reason of the regularity of her little features, the beauty of her little white teeth, and the brilliancy of her large black eyes, to say nothing of her luxuriant hair and the gleeful insolence of her sweet expression.  We cannot say how many, or rather how few, months old the child is, but, as we have already remarked, she is a staggerer.  That is to say, she has begun to assert the independence of her little brown legs, and progresses, even when on shore, with all the uncertainty of a drunken woman.  Of course, the ship's motion does not tend to remedy this defect.  Sally's chief delight is wallowing.  No matter what part of the ship's deck she may select for her operations--whether the scuppers, the quarter-deck, or the forecastle--she lays her down straightway for a luxurious wallow.  If the spot be dirty, she wallows it clean; if it be clean, she wallows it dirty.  This might seem an awkward habit to an English mother; but it is a matter of supreme indifference to Sally's mother, who sits on a gun-carriage plaiting a mat of cocoa-nut fibre, for Sally, being naked, requires little washing.  A shower of rain or a dash of spray suffices to cleanse her when at sea.  On shore she lives, if we may say so, more in the water than on the land.  The day is fine, and the breeze so light that it scarce ruffles the face of the great ocean, though it manages to fill the topsails of the _Bounty_, causing her to glide quietly on.  Some of the mutineers are seated on the deck or bulwarks, patching a canvas jacket or plaiting a grass hat.  Others are smoking contemplatively.  John Adams is winding up the log-line with McCoy.  Edward Young stands gazing through a telescope at something which he fancies is visible on the horizon, and Fletcher Christian is down in the cabin poring over Carteret's account of his voyage in the Pacific.  There were goats on board.  One of these, having become a pet with the crew, was allowed to walk at liberty, and became a grand playmate for Sally.  Besides the goats, Christian had taken care to procure a number of hogs and poultry from Otaheite; also a supply of young breadfruit-trees and other vegetable products of the island, wherewith to enrich his new home when he should find it.  All the animals were confined in cribs and pens with the exception of Sally's playmate.  \"Take care!\" exclaimed John Adams as he left the quarter-deck with his hands in his pockets; \"your mate'll butt you overboard, Sal, if you don't look-out.\"  There was, indeed, some fear of such a catastrophe, for the precocious infant had a tendency to scramble on any object which enabled her to look over the low bulwarks, and the goat had a propensity to advance on its hind legs with a playful toss of its head and take its playmate by surprise, in truth, what between the fore-hatch, the companion-hatch, and the low bulwarks, it may be said that Sally led a life of constant and imminent danger.  She was frequently plucked by the men out of the very jaws of death, and seemed to enjoy the fun.  While attempting to avoid one of the goat's playful assaults, Sally stumbled up against Matthew Quintal, deranged the work on which he was engaged, and caused him to prick his hand with a sail-needle, at which William McCoy, who was beside him, laughed.  \"Get out o' that, you little nigger!\" exclaimed Quintal, angrily, giving the child a push with his foot which sent her rolling to the side of the ship, where her head came in contact with an iron bolt.  Sally opened her mouth, shut her eyes, and howled.  Quintal had probably not intended to hurt the child, but he expressed no regret.  On the contrary, seeing that she was not much injured, he laughed in concert with McCoy.  These two, Quintal and McCoy, were emphatically the bad men of the party.  They did not sympathise much, if at all, with human suffering-- certainly not with those whom they styled \"niggers;\" but there was one witness of the act whose heart was as tender towards the natives as Quintal's was hard.  \"If you ever dare to touch her so again,\" said Young, striding up to Quintal, \"I'll kick you into the pig-sty.\"  The midshipman seemed to be the last man on board whose natural disposition would lead him to utter such a threat, and Quintal was quite taken aback; but as Young was a powerful fellow, perfectly capable of carrying his threat into execution, and seemed, moreover, thoroughly roused, the former thought it best to hold his tongue, even though lugubrious Isaac Martin chuckled audibly, and Ohoo, one of the natives, who stood near, displayed his fine teeth from ear to ear.  Lifting up Sally with much tenderness, Young carried her to her mother, who, after a not very careful examination of the bruised head, set her down on the deck, where she immediately began to wallow as before. Rising on her brown little feet, she staggered forward a few paces, and then seated herself without bending her knees."]]]
