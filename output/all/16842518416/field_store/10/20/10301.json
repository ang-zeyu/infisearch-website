Then, if you insist on gathering and carrying along with you such pocket-loads of specimens, plants, rocks, etcetera, as you've brought in this evening, I'll have to build a sort of Noah's ark, or omnibus on sledge-runners, to carry them.\"  \"And suppose I don't insist on carrying these things, what then?\"  \"Well,\" replied the Captain, \"in that case I would--well, let me see--a little more of the bubble, Benjy.\"  \"Wouldn't you rather some of the squeak?\" asked the boy.  \"Both, lad, both--some of everything.  Well, as I was saying--and you've a right to know what's running in my head, seeing that you have to help me carry out the plans--I'll give you a rough notion of 'em.\"  The Captain became more serious as he explained his plans.  \"The Eskimos, you know,\" he continued, \"have gone by what I may call the shore ice, two days' journey in advance of this spot, taking our dogs along with them.  It was my intention to have proceeded to the same point in our yacht, and there, if the sea was open, to have taken on board that magnificent Eskimo giant, Chingatok, with his family, and steered away due north.  In the event of the pack being impassable, I had intended to have laid the yacht up in some safe harbour; hunted and fished until we had a stock of dried and salted provisions, enough to last us two years, and then to have started northward in sledges, under the guidance of Chingatok, with a few picked men, leaving the rest and the yacht in charge of the mate.  The wreck of the _Whitebear_ has, however, forced me to modify these plans.  I shall now secure as much of our cargo as we have been able to save, and leave it here _en cache_--\"  \"What sort of cash is that, father?\" asked Benjy.  \"You are the best linguist among us, Leo, tell him,\" said the Captain, turning to his nephew.  \"`_En cache_' is French for `in hiding,'\" returned Leo, with a laugh.  \"Why do you speak French to Englishmen, father?\" said Benjy in a pathetic tone, but with a pert look.  \"'Cause the expression is a common one on this side the Atlantic, lad, and you ought to know it.  Now, don't interrupt me again.  Well, having placed the cargo in security,\" (\"_En cache_,\" muttered Benjy with a glance at Butterface.) \"I shall rig up the sledges brought from England, load them with what we require, and follow up the Eskimos.  You're sure, Anders, that you understood Chingatok's description of the place?\"  The interpreter declared that he was quite sure.  \"After that,\" resumed the Captain, \"I'll act according to the information the said Eskimos can give me.  D'ye know, I have a strong suspicion that our Arctic giant Chingatok is a philosopher, if I may judge from one or two questions he put and observations he made when we first met.  He says he has come from a fine country which lies far--very far--to the north of this; so far that I feel quite interested and hopeful about it.  I expect to have more talk with him soon on the subject.  A little more o' the bubble, lad; really, Butterface, your powers in the way of cookery are wonderful.\"  \"Chingatok seems to me quite a remarkable fellow for an Eskimo,\" observed Leo, scraping the bottom of the kettle with his spoon, and looking inquiringly into it.  \"I, too, had some talk with him--through Anders--when we first met, and from what he said I can't help thinking that he has come from the remote north solely on a voyage of discovery into what must be to him the unknown regions of the south.  Evidently he has an inquiring mind.\"  \"Much like yourself, Leo, to judge from the way you peer into that kettle,\" said Benjy; \"please don't scrape the bottom out of it.  There's not much tin to mend it with, you know, in these regions.\"  \"Brass will do quite as well,\" retorted Leo, \"and there can be no lack of that while you are here.\"  \"Come now, Benjy,\" said Alf, \"that insolent remark should put you on your mettle.\"  \"So it does, but I won't open my lips, because I feel that I should speak ironically if I were to reply,\" returned the boy, gazing dreamily into the quiet countenance of the steward.  \"What are _you_ thinking of, you lump of charcoal?\"  \"Me, massa? me tink dere 'pears to be room for more wittles inside ob me; but as all de grub's eated up, p'r'aps it would be as well to be goin' an' tacklin' suffin' else now.\"  \"You're right, Butterface,\" cried the Captain, rousing himself from a reverie.  \"What say you, comrades?  Shall we turn in an' have a nap? It's past midnight.\"  \"I'm not inclined for sleep,\" said Alf, looking up from some of the botanical specimens he had collected.  \"No more am I,\" said Leo, lifting up his arms and stretching his stalwart frame, which, notwithstanding his youth, had already developed to almost the full proportions of a powerful man.  \"I vote that we sit up all night,\" said Benjy, \"the sun does it, and why shouldn't we?\"  \"Well, I've no objection,\" rejoined the Captain, \"but we must work if we don't sleep--so, come along.\"  Setting the example, Captain Vane began to shoulder the bags and boxes which lay scattered around with the energy of an enthusiastic railway porter.  The other members of the party were not a whit behind him in diligence and energy.  Even Benjy, delicate-looking though he was, did the work of an average man, besides enlivening the proceedings with snatches of song and a flow of small talk of a humorous and slightly insolent nature.    CHAPTER SIX.  FUTURE PLANS DISCUSSED AND DECIDED.  Away to the northward of the spot where the _Whitebear_ had been wrecked there stretched a point of land far out into the Arctic Ocean.  It was about thirty miles distant, and loomed hugely bluff and grand against the brilliant sky, as if it were the forefront of the northern world. No civilised eyes had ever beheld that land before.  Captain Vane knew that, because it lay in latitude 83 north, which was a little beyond the furthest point yet reached by Arctic navigators.  He therefore named it Cape Newhope.  Benjy thought that it should have been named Butterface-beak, because the steward had been the first to observe it, but his father thought otherwise.  About three miles to the northward of this point of land the Eskimos were encamped.  According to arrangement with the white men they had gone there, as we have said, in charge of the dogs brought by Captain Vane from Upernavik, as these animals, it was thought, stood much in need of exercise.  Here the natives had found and taken possession of a number of deserted Eskimo huts.  These rude buildings were the abodes to which the good people migrated when summer heat became so great as to render their snow-huts sloppily disagreeable.  In one of the huts sat Chingatok, his arms resting on his knees, his huge hands clasped, and his intelligent eyes fixed dreamily on the lamp-flame, over which his culinary mother was bending in busy sincerity.  There were many points of character in which this remarkable mother and son resembled each other.  Both were earnest--intensely so-- and each was enthusiastically eager about small matters as well as great.  In short, they both possessed great though uncultivated minds.  The hut they occupied was in some respects as remarkable as themselves. It measured about six feet in height and ten in diameter.  The walls were made of flattish stones, moss, and the bones of seals, whales, narwhals, and other Arctic creatures.  The stones were laid so that each overlapped the one below it, a very little inwards, and thus the walls approached each other gradually as they rose from the foundation; the top being finally closed by slabs of slate-stone.  Similar stones covered the floor--one half of which floor was raised a foot or so above the other, and this raised half served for a seat by day as well as a couch by night.  On it were spread a thick layer of dried moss, and several seal, dog, and bear skins.  Smaller elevations in the corners near the entrance served for seats.  The door was a curtain of sealskin. Above it was a small window, glazed, so to speak, with strips of semi-transparent dried intestines sewed together.  Toolooha's cooking-lamp was made of soapstone, formed like a clam-shell, and about eight inches in diameter; the fuel was seal-oil, and the wick was of moss.  It smoked considerably, but Eskimos are smoke-proof.  The pot above it, suspended from the roof, was also made of soapstone. Sealskins hung about the walls drying; oily mittens, socks and boots were suspended about on pegs and racks of rib-bones.  Lumps of blubber hung and lay about miscellaneously.  Odours, not savoury, were therefore prevalent--but Eskimos are smell-proof.  \"Mother,\" said the giant, raising his eyes from the flame to his parent's smoke-encircled visage, \"they are a most wonderful people, these Kablunets.  Blackbeard is a great man--a grand man--but I think he is--\"  Chingatok paused, shook his head, and touched his forehead with a look of significance worthy of a white man.  \"Why think you so, my son?\" asked the old woman, sneezing, as a denser cloud than usual went up her nose.  \"Because he has come here to search for _nothing_.\"  \"Nothing, my son?\"  \"Yes--at least that is what he tried to explain to me.  Perhaps the interpreter could not explain.  He is not a smart man, that interpreter. He resembles a walrus with his brain scooped out.  He spoke much, but I could not understand.\"  \"Could not understand?\" repeated Toolooha, with an incredulous look, \"let not Chingatok say so.  Is there _anything_ that passes the lips of man which he cannot understand?\"  \"Truly, mother, I once thought"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21734"],["title","The Golden Dream: Adventures in the Far West (#0)"],["body","Golden Dream, by R.M. Ballantyne  ________________________________________________________________________  Robert Michael Ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894.  He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, and in 1841 he became a clerk with the Hudson Bay Company, working at the Red River Settlement in Northen Canada until 1847, arriving back in Edinburgh in 1848.  The letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life, and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters.  Three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade, \"The Young Fur Traders\", \"Ungava\", \"The Hudson Bay Company\", and were based on his experiences with the H.B.C.  In this period he also wrote \"The Coral island\" and \"Martin Rattler\", both of these taking place in places never visited by Ballantyne.  Having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books, he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about.  With these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers.  He researched the Cornish Mines, the London Fire Brigade, the Postal Service, the Railways, the laying down of submarine telegraph cables, the construction of light-houses, the light-ship service, the life-boat service, South Africa, Norway, the North Sea fishing fleet, ballooning, deep-sea diving, Algiers, and many more, experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time, and he lived as they lived.  He was a very true-to-life author, depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail.  His young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books, and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen, sometimes four in a year, all very good reading.  The rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life, but the quality never failed.  He published over ninety books under his own name, and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym \"Comus\".  For today's taste his books are perhaps a little too religious, and what we would nowadays call \"pi\".  In part that was the way people wrote in those days, but more important was the fact that in his days at the Red River Settlement, in the wilds of Canada, he had been a little dissolute, and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave, as he felt he had been.  Some of his books were quite short, little over 100 pages.  These books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents, having less pocket-money.  These books are particularly well-written and researched, because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money.  They were published as six series, three books in each series.

ADVENTURES IN THE FAR WEST.  THE CAUSE OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR.  Ned Sinton gazed at the scene before him with indescribable amazement! He had often witnessed strange things in the course of his short though chequered life, but he had never seen anything like this.  Many a dream of the most extravagant nature had surrounded his pillow with creatures of curious form and scenes of magic beauty, but never before, either by actual observation or in nightly vision, had Ned Sinton beheld a scene so wonderful as that which now lay spread out before him.  Ned stood in the centre of a cavern of vast dimensions--so vast, and so full of intense light, that instead of looking on it as a huge cave, he felt disposed to regard it as a small world.  The sides of this cavern were made of pure gold, and the roof--far above his head--was spangled all over with glittering points, like a starry sky.  The ground, too, and, in short, everything within the cave, was made of the same precious metal.  Thousands of stalactites hung from the roof like golden icicles. Millions of delicate threads of the same material also depended from the star-spangled vault, each thread having a golden ball at the end of it, which, strange to say, was transparent, and permitted a bright flame within to shine through, and shed a yellow lustre over surrounding objects.  All the edges, and angles, and points of the irregularly-formed walls were of burnished gold, which reflected the rays of these pendant lamps with dazzling brilliancy, while the broad masses of the frosted walls shone with a subdued light.  Magnificent curtains of golden filigree fell in rich voluminous folds on the pavement, half concealing several archways which led into smaller caverns, similar to the large one.  Altogether it was a scene of luxurious richness and splendour that is utterly indescribable.  But the thing that amazed Ned Sinton most was, that the company of well-dressed ladies and gentlemen who moved about in these splendid halls, and ate golden ices, or listened to the exquisite strains of music that floated on the atmosphere, were all as yellow as guineas! Ned could by no means understand this.  In order to convince himself that there was no deception in the matter, he shook hands with several of the people nearest to him, and found that they were cold and hard as iron; although, to all appearance, they were soft and pliable, and could evidently move about with perfect freedom.  Ned was very much puzzled indeed.  One would have thought he must have believed himself to be dreaming.  Not a bit of it.  He knew perfectly well that he was wide-awake.  In fact, a doubt upon that point never crossed his mind for a moment.  At length he resolved to ask the meaning of it all, and, observing a stout old gentleman, with a bland smile on his yellow countenance, in the act of taking a pinch of golden snuff from a gold snuff-box, he advanced and accosted him.  \"Pray, sir,\" began Ned, modestly, \"may I take the liberty of asking you what is the meaning of all this?\"  \"All what, sir?\" inquired the old gentleman, in a deep metallic voice.  \"This golden cave, with its wonderful lamps, and especially these golden people; and--excuse me, sir, for remarking on the circumstance--you seem to be _made of gold_ yourself.  I have often heard the term applied to extremely rich persons, but I really never expected to see a man who was literally `worth his weight in gold.'\"  The old gentleman laughed sarcastically at this sally, and took an enormous pinch of gold-dust.  As he did not seem inclined to be communicative, however, Ned said again, \"What is the meaning of it all? can you explain what has done it?\"  Smiling blandly at his interrogator, this gentleman of precious metal placed his head a little on one side, and tapped the lid of his snuff-box, but said nothing.  Then he suddenly exclaimed, at the full pitch of his voice, \"California, my boy!  That's what's done it, Edward! _California for ever_!  Ned, hurrah!\"  As the deep tones of his voice rang through the star-spangled vault, the company took up the shout, and with \"California for ever!\" made the cavern ring again.  In the excess of their glee the gentlemen took off their hats, and the ladies their wreaths and turbans, and threw them in the air.  As many of them failed to catch these portions of costume in their descent, the clatter caused by their fall on the golden pavement was very striking indeed.  \"Come here, my lad,\" said the old gentleman, seizing Ned Sinton by the arm, and laughing heartily as he dragged him towards an immense mirror of burnished gold; \"look at yourself there.\"  Ned looked, and started back with horror on observing that he himself had been converted into gold.  There could be no mistake whatever about it.  There he stood, staring at himself like a yellow statue.  His shooting-jacket was richly chased with alternate stripes of burnished and frosted work; the buttons on his vest shone like stars; his pantaloons were striped like the coat; his hair was a mass of dishevelled filigree; and his hands, when, in the height of his horror, he clasped them together, rang like a brass-founder's anvil.  For a few moments he stood before the mirror speechless.  Then a feeling of intense indignation unaccountably took possession of him, and he turned fiercely on the old gentleman, exclaiming--  \"_You_ have done this, sir!  What do you mean by it? eh!\"  \"You're quite mistaken, Ned.  I didn't do it.  California has done it. Ha! ha! my boy, you're done for!  Smitten with the yellow fever, Neddy? California for ever!  See here--\"  As he spoke, the old gentleman threw out one leg and both arms, and began to twirl round, after the fashion of a peg-top, on one toe.  At first he revolved slowly, but gradually increased his speed, until no part of him could be distinctly observed.  Ned Sinton stood aghast. Suddenly the old gentleman shot upwards like a rocket, but he did not quit the ground; he merely elongated his body until his head stuck against the roof of the cave.  Then he ceased to revolve, and remained in the form of a golden stalactite--his head surrounded by stars and his toe resting on the ground!  While Ned stood rooted to the spot, turning the subject over in his mind, and trying to find out by what process of chemical or mechanical action so remarkable a transformation could have been accomplished, he became aware that his uncle, old Mr Shirley, was standing in the middle of the cave regarding him with a look of mingled sarcasm and pity.  He observed, too, that his uncle was not made of gold, like the people around him, but was habited in a yeomanry uniform.  Mr Shirley had been a yeoman twenty years before his nephew was born.  Since that time his proportions had steadily increased, and he was now a man of very considerable rotundity--so much so, that his old uniform fitted him with excessive tightness; the coat would by no means"]]]
