There is no other island that I know of in these regions.  Besides, this one seems the very thing we want.  It has wood and water in abundance; fruits and roots of many kinds; a splendid soil, if we may believe our eyes, to say nothing of Brown's opinion; bad anchorage for ships, great difficulty and some danger in landing even in fine weather, and impossible to land at all, I should think, in bad; beautiful little valleys and hills; rugged mountains with passes so difficult that a few resolute men might defy a host, and caves to which we might retreat and sell our lives dearly if hard pushed.  What more could we wish for?\"  In a short time they reached the little narrow strip of shingly beach where the boat had been left in charge of Quintal.  Here they had to encounter the great difficulty of forcing their way through the surf which had borne them shoreward in such grand style.  The chief danger lay in the liability of the boat to be caught by the bow, turned broadside to the great tumbling billows, and overturned.  Safety and success lay in keeping the boat's bow straight \"end-on\" to the seas, and pulling hard.  To accomplish this, Fletcher Christian again took an oar to steer with, in preference to the rudder.  Besides being the most powerful man of the party, he was the best boatman, and the most agile in his movements.  \"Steady, now!\" he said, as the boat lay in the seething foam partially sheltered by a rock, while the men sat with oars out, ready for instant action.  A bigger wave than usual had just hurled itself with a thunderous roar on the reverberating cliffs, and the great sheet of foaming water had just reached that momentary pause which indicated the turning-point previous to the backward rush, when Christian shouted--  \"Give way!\"  The boat leaped out, was kept end-on by a powerful stroke of the steersman, rushed on the back-draught as if down a cataract, and met the succeeding billow fairly.  The bow was thrown up so high that it seemed as if the boat were standing on end, and must inevitably be thrown right over, but the impetus given by the willing men forced her half through and half over the crest of the watery mountain.  \"With a will, boys, with a will!\" cried Christian.  Another moment and they slid down the billow's back into the trough between the seas.  A few more energetic strokes carried them over the next wave.  After that the danger was past, and in less than half-an-hour they were once more on board the _Bounty_.    CHAPTER FIVE.  THE LANDING OF THE LIVESTOCK IN BOUNTY BAY.  Preparations were now made for landing.  The bay which they had discovered, and was the only one on the island, lay on its northern side.  Into it they succeeded in running the _Bounty_, and cast anchor. Soon the women, with little Sally, were landed and sent up to the table-land above, to make some sort of encampment, under the charge of midshipman Young.  The ship was warped close up to the cliffs, so close that she ran the end of her bowsprit against them and broke it off. Here there was a narrow ledge that seemed suitable for a landing-place. Night put a stop to their labours on board.  While some lighted fires and encamped on the shore, others remained in the ship to guard her and to be ready for the debarkation that was to take place in the morning.  And a strange debarkation it was.  It had been found that there was a rise of eight feet in the tide.  This enabled Christian to lay the ship in such a position that it was possible to extend several long planks from the bow to the beach.  Fortunately the weather was fine, otherwise the landing would have been difficult if not disastrous.  When all was complete, the goats were collected and driven over the bow to the shore.  The procession was headed by an old billy-goat, who looked supremely philosophical as he went slowly along the rough gangway.  \"It minds one o' pirates makin' the crew of a merchantman walk the plank,\" remarked John Williams, as he assisted to urge the unwilling flock along.  \"Quite like a menadgeree,\" suggested Mills.  \"More like old Noah comin' out o' the ark,\" said Williams, \"on the top o' Mount--Mount--what was its name?  I forget.\"  \"Mount Sy-nee,\" suggested Quintal.  \"Not at all; it was Mount Arrowroot,\" said Isaac Martin, with the air of an oracle.  \"Clear the way, lads, for the poultry,\" shouted midshipman Young.  A tremendous cackling in rear rendered further orders inaudible as well as unnecessary, while the men stood aside from the opening to the gangway of planks.  A considerable number of fowls had been taken on board at Otaheite, and these, besides being bewildered and uncertain as to the point to which they were being driven, and the precise duty that was required of them, were infected with the general obstinacy of the rest of the animal kingdom.  At last, however, a splendid cock was persuaded to enter the gangway, down which he ran, and flew shrieking to the shore, followed by the rest of his kindred.  \"Now for the hogs,\" said Quintal, to whose domineering spirit the work was congenial.  But the hogs were not to be managed as easily as the goats and fowls had been.  With native obstinacy and amazing energy they refused to do what they were bid, and shrieked defiance when force was attempted.  The noise was further increased by the butting of a few goats and the cackling of some poultry, which had got mixed up with them.  First of all they declined to leave the enclosures, out of which they had tried pertinaciously to escape all the voyage.  By way of overcoming this difficulty, Christian ordered the enclosures to be torn down, and the planks with which they had been formed were used as persuaders to urge the refractory creatures on.  As each poke or slap produced a series of horrible yells, it may be understood that the operation was accompanied with noise.  At last some of the men, losing patience, rushed at the hogs, seized them by ears and tails, and forcibly dragged them to the gangway.  McCoy and Quintal distinguished themselves in this service, hurling their animals on the planks with such violence that several of them fell over into the sea, and swam towards the shore in the surf from which they were rescued by the Otaheitan men, who danced about in the water, highly enjoying this part of their labour.  A profound calm seemed to succeed a wild storm when the last of the unruly pigs had left the ship.  \"We've got 'em all out at last,\" said one of the men, with a sigh, wiping the perspiration from his forehead with his sleeve.  \"Bad luck to them,\" growled another, tying up a slight wound received in the conflict.  \"We've done with the live stock, anyhow, and that's a comfort,\" said a third.  \"Done with the live stock!\" exclaimed Martin.  \"Why, the worst lot has yet to come.\"  \"That must be yourself, then, Martin, my boy,\" said Brown.  \"I wish it was, Brown,\" retorted Martin; \"but you've forgotten the cats.\"  \"So we have!\" exclaimed everybody.  \"And you may be sure they'll give us some trouble,\" said Christian. \"Come, let's go at 'em at once.\"  This estimate of the cats was fully justified by what followed.  A considerable number of these useful creatures, black, white, and grey, had been brought from Otaheite for the purpose of keeping down the rats, with which many of the South Sea Islands are afflicted.  During the voyage most of them had retired to the privacy of the hold, where they found holes and corners about the cargo, and came out only at night, like evil spirits, to pick up a precarious livelihood.  During the recent conflict a few had found insecure refuge in holes and corners about the deck, where yelling and fugitive pigs had convulsed them with horror; and one, a huge grey cat, having taken madly to the rigging, rushed out to the end of the foresail-yard, where it was immediately roused to frenzy by a flock of astonished gulls.  Now, these cats had to be rummaged out of their retreats by violence, in which work all the white men in the ship had to take part amid a chorus of awful skirling, serpentlike fuffing, ominous and deadly growling, and, generally, hideous caterwauling, that no pen, however gifted, could adequately describe.  \"_I_ see 'im,\" cried Mills, with his head thrust down between a nail-cask and a bundle of Otaheitan roots.  \"Where?\" from John Adams, who, with heels and legs in the air, and head and shoulders down somewhere about the keel, was poking a long stick into total darkness.  \"There, right under you, with a pair of eyes blazing like green lamps.\"  A poke in the right direction caused a convulsion in the bowels of the cargo like a miniature earthquake.  It was accompanied by a fearful yell.  \"I've touched him at last,\" said Adams, quietly.  \"Look-out there, Brown, he's goin' to scramble up the bulkhead.\"  \"There goes another,\" shouted Martin, whose head was so far down among the cargo that his voice had a muffled sound.  There was no occasion to ask where this time, for, with a wild shriek, a large black fellow left its retreat, sprang up the hatchway, and sought refuge in the rigging.  At the same moment there came a sepulchral moan from a cat whose place of refuge was invaded by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21747"],["title","The Lonely Island: The Refuge of the Mutineers (#8)"],["body","ntal.  The moan was followed by a cry, loud and deep, that would have done credit to a mad baby.  \"Isn't it appalling to see creeturs so furious?\" said Adams, solemnly, as he drew his head and shoulders out of the depths.  \"They're fiendishly inclined, no doubt,\" said Christian, who stood hard by with a stick, ready to expedite the process of ejection when a cat ventured to show itself.  At last, with infinite trouble the whole body of the enemy were routed from the hold, and the hatches fastened down to prevent a return.  But the end was not yet gained, for the creatures had found various refuges on deck, and some had taken to the rigging.  \"Come out o' that,\" cried Martin, making a poke at the big grey cat, like a small tiger, which had fled to the foretop.  With a ferocious caterwaul and fuff the creature sprang down the shrouds on the opposite side as if it had been born and bred a sailor. Unfortunately it made a wild leap at a pendant rope in passing, missed it, and came down on the deck with a prodigious flop.  Only one of its nine lives, apparently, was damaged.  With the other eight it rushed to the opening in the bow, and soon gained the shore, where it immediately sprang to the leafy head of a cocoa-nut palm.  At the same moment a black-and-white cat was sent flying in the same direction by Young. Quintal, indulging his savage nature, caught one of the cats by the neck and tried to strangle it into subjection, but received such punishment with teeth and claws that he was fain to fling it into the sea.  It swam ashore, emerged a melancholy \"drookit\" spectacle, and dashed into the nearest underwood.  Thus, one by one, the cats were hunted out of the _Bounty_, and introduced to their future home.  The last to give in was, appropriately, an enormous black Tom, which, with deadly yellow eyes, erect hair, bristling tail, curved back, extended claws, and flattened ears, rushed fuffing and squealing from one refuge to another, until at last, giving way to the concentrated attack of the assembled crew, it burst through the opening, scurried down the gangway, and went like a shot into the bushes, a confirmed maniac,--if not worse.    CHAPTER SIX.  SETTLING DOWN AND EXPLORATION.  The first few days were devoted by the mutineers to conveying ashore every article that was likely to prove useful.  Not only were chests, boxes, tools, bedding, culinary implements, etcetera, removed from the vessel, but the planks that formed the bulkheads, much of the cordage, and all the loose spars and removable iron-work were carried ashore.  In short, the vessel was completely gutted.  When this was finished, a council was called to decide what should be done with the _Bounty_ herself, for although Christian was the acknowledged leader of the party, he took no important step without consulting his comrades.  \"You see it is useless,\" he said, \"to think of venturing again to sea in the _Bounty_; we are too short-handed for that.  Besides, we could not find a more suitable island than this.  I therefore propose that we should burn the ship, to prevent her being seen by any chance vessel that may pass this way.  If she were observed, men might be tempted to land, and of course they would tell that we were here, and His Majesty would soon have a cruiser out in search of us.  What say you?\"  \"I say wait a bit and consider,\" replied Young.  \"Ditto,\" said Adams.  Some of the others thought with Christian.  Quintal, in particular, who seemed to live in a chronic state of objection to being hanged, was strong for destroying the vessel.  Eventually, after a good deal of delay and much discussion, the good ship _Bounty_ finished her career by being burned to the water's edge in Bounty Bay.  This occurred on the 23rd January 1790.  The lower part of the vessel, which would not burn, was towed out into deep water and sunk, so that not a vestige of her remained.  And now all was bustling activity.  A spot some few hundred yards farther inland than that selected as their camping-ground on the day of arrival, was fixed on as suitable for their permanent location.  It was beautifully situated, and pleasantly sheltered by trees, through between the stems of which the sea was visible.  To this spot everything was conveyed, and several of the most powerful of the men began to clear the ground, and fell the trees with axes.  One morning, soon after landing, a party was organised to traverse the island and investigate its character and resources.  As they were not yet quite sure that it was uninhabited, this party was a strong one and well armed.  It consisted of Christian, Adams, Brown, Martin, and four of the Otaheitans.  Edward Young stayed at the encampment with the remaining men and the women.  \"In which direction shall we go?\" asked Christian, appealing to Brown.  The botanist hesitated, and glanced round him.  \"If I might make so bold, sir,\" said Isaac Martin, \"I would suggest that we go right up to the top o' the mountains.  There's nothin' like a bird's-eye view for fillin' the mind wi' right notions o' form, an' size, an' character.\"  Following this advice, they traversed the lower ground, which was found very prolific everywhere.  Then they ascended the undulating slopes of the mountain-sides until they reached the rugged and bare rocks of the higher ground.  On the way they found further and indisputable evidence of the island having been inhabited at some previous and probably long past era. Among these evidences were spear-heads, and axes of stone, and several warlike weapons.  \"Hallo! here's a circumstance,\" exclaimed Martin, stopping in front of an object which lay on the ground.  On closer examination the \"circumstance\" turned out to be an image made of a hard and coarse red stone.  \"It is evidently an idol,\" said Christian; \"and here are some smooth round stones, resembling those used by the Otaheitans in war.\"  Not far from the spot, and in other places as they advanced, the exploring party found heaps of stone chips, as well as more images and tools.  \"I've been thinking,\" said Brown, turning for a moment to look down at the sea, which now lay spread out far below them like a blue plain, \"I've been thinking that the proof of people having been here long ago lies not only in these stones, axes, spears, and images, but also in the fact that we find the cocoa-nut trees, bananas, plantains, breadfruit-trees, as well as yams and sweet potatoes, grow chiefly in the sunny and sheltered parts of the island, and gathered together as if they had been planted there.\"  \"Here's the best proof of all,\" exclaimed Martin, who had a tendency to poke about, with his long nose advanced, as if scenting out things.  They looked at the spot to which Martin pointed, and there saw a human skeleton in the last stage of decay, with a large pearl shell under the skull.  Not far-off more human bones were discovered.  \"That's proof positive,\" said Brown.  \"Now, I wonder why these natives came here, and why they went away.\"  \"P'r'aps they didn't come, but was born'd here,\" suggested Martin; \"an' mayhap they didn't go away at all, but died here.\"  \"True, Martin,\" said Adams; \"and that shell reminds me of what Captain Bligh once told me, that the natives o' the Gambier Islands, which must lie to wind'ard o' this, have a custom of puttin' a shell under the heads of the dead in this fashion.  Moreover, he told me that these same Gambier chaps, long ago, used to put the people they vanquished in war on rafts, and turn 'em adrift to sink or swim, or fetch what land they might.  No doubt some of these people got drifted here.\"  As he spoke the party emerged from a somewhat rugged pass, close to the highest peak of the mountain-ranges.  A few minutes' scramble brought them to the summit, whence they obtained a magnificent view of the entire circuit of the island.  We have said that the peak is just over a thousand feet high.  From this commanding position the Pacific was seen with a boundless horizon all round.  Not a speck of land visible save the rocky isle on which they stood.  Not a sail to mark the vast expanse of water, which, from that height, seemed perfectly flat and smooth, though a steady breeze was blowing, and the islet was fringed with a pure white ring of foam.  Not a cloud even to break the monotony of the clear sky, and no sound to disturb the stillness of nature save the plaintive cries, mellowed by distance, of the myriads of sea-fowl which sailed round the cliffs, or dipped into the water far below.  \"Solitude profound,\" said Christian, in a low voice, breaking the silence which had fallen on the party as they gazed slowly round them.  Just then a loud and hideous yell issued from, apparently; the bowels of the earth, and rudely put to flight the feeling of profound solitude. The cry, although very loud, had a strangely muffled sound, and was repeated as if by an echo.  The explorers looked in each other's faces inquiringly, and not without an expression of awe.  \"Strange,\" said Adams; \"an' it sounded very like some one in distress.\"  It was observed suddenly that Isaac Martin was absent.  \"But the voice was not like his,\" said Brown.  The mysterious cry was repeated at the moment, and Christian ran quickly in the direction whence it seemed to come.  As they neared a rugged mass of rocks which lay close to the peak on which they had been standing, the cry lost much of its mystery, and finally assumed the tones of Martin's voice.  \"Hallo! hi! murder! help!  O my leg!  Mr Christian, Adams, Brown, this way.  Help! ho! hi!\"  What between the muffled sound and the echo, Martin created a noise that would have set his friends into fits of laughter if they had not been greatly alarmed.  In a few seconds the party reached what seemed to be a dark hole, out of which the poor man's left leg was seen protruding.  Christian and Adams grasped it.  Brown and one of the Otaheitans lent a hand, and Martin was quickly dragged out of danger and set on his legs.  \"I"]]]
