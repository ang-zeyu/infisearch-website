An opening in one side of each formed a door, through which entrance could be made by creeping.  On the roofs of these curious dwellings many of the natives were seated, evidently awaiting the result of the deputation's conference with the white men.  The main object that the Indians appeared to have in view was the obtaining of fire-arms, and it was observed that they cast longing eyes upon the rifles which leaned on the trees beside the fire.  Rance therefore advised every man to look carefully after his weapons, while he talked with the chief, and told him that he had no guns or ammunition to spare.  In order to please him, however, he gave him an old rusty carbine, which was bent in the barrel, and nearly useless, in exchange for a few fresh fish.  \"My white brother is liberal,\" said the delighted savage in bad Spanish, as he surveyed the weapon with admiration, \"but it is necessary to have black powder and balls.\"  \"I have none to spare,\" replied Rance, \"but the settlements of the white men are not far off.  Besides, the Indian chief is wise.  He does not require to be told that white men come here continually, searching for gold, and that they bring much powder and ball with them.  Let gold be offered, and both may be obtained.\"  The chief took this remark for a hint, and at once offered some gold-dust in exchange for powder and shot, but Rance shook his head, knowing that, if obtained, the ammunition would in all probability be used against himself.  The chief was therefore obliged to rest content in the mean time with the harmless weapon.  Meanwhile, another party of seven or eight Indians had gone towards Frank and Joe, and by signs made them to understand that there was something worth shooting on the other side of a cliff not fifty yards off.  Our hero and his nautical friend were both of unsuspicious natures, and being much amused by the ludicrous gesticulations of the savages in their efforts to enlighten them, as well as curious to ascertain what it could be that was on the other side of the cliff, they accompanied them in that direction.  The moment they had passed out of sight of the camp a powerful savage leaped on Frank from behind, and, grasping him round the throat with both arms, endeavoured to throw him, while another Indian wrenched the rifle out of his hand.  At the same moment Joe Graddy was similarly seized.  The savages had, however, underrated the strength of their antagonists.  Frank stooped violently forward, almost to the ground, and hurled the Indian completely over his head.  At the same time he drew a revolver from his belt, fired at and wounded the other Indian, who dropped the rifle, and doubled like a hare into the bushes.  The others fled right and left, as Frank sprang forward and recovered his weapon-- all save the one whose unhappy lot it had been to assault Joe Graddy, and who was undergoing rapid strangulation, when Frank ran to his rescue.  \"Have mercy on him, Joe!\" he cried.  \"Marcy! why should I have marcy on such a dirty--lie still, then,\" said Joe sternly, as he pressed his knee deeper into the pit of the Indian's stomach, and compressed his throat with both hands until his tongue protruded, and both eyes seemed about to start from their sockets.  \"Come, come, Joe; you volunteered to be my servant, so you are bound to obey me.\"  Saying this, Frank seized the angry tar by the collar, and dragged him forcibly off his victim, who, after a gasp or two, rose and limped away.  \"He has got quite enough,\" continued Frank, \"to keep you vividly in his remembrance for the rest of his life, so we must hasten to the camp, for I fear that the Indians won't remain friendly after this unfortunate affair.\"  Grunting out his dissatisfaction pretty freely, Joe accompanied his friend to the camp-fire, where their comrades were found in a state of great alarm about their safety.  They had heard the shots and shouts, and were on the point of hastening to the rescue.  The chief and his companions, meanwhile, were making earnest protestations that no evil was intended.  When Frank and Joe appeared, Rance turned angrily on the chief, and ordered him and his men to quit the camp instantly.  This they hesitated to do for a little, and the chief made fresh efforts to calm the irritated guide, but Rance knew that he had to deal with treacherous men, and repeated his order to be off at the same time throwing forward his rifle in a threatening manner.  Whereupon the chief flew into a violent rage, and, after using a good deal of abusive language, returned to his village, where he immediately summoned a council of war, and, by his violent gesticulations and frequent looking and pointing towards the camp, left no doubt on the minds of the travellers as to his intentions.  Rance therefore made the best preparations possible in the circumstances to repel an attack.  Their position was very critical, for the Indians numbered about a hundred men, while their own party consisted only of six.  But they had the one great advantage over their enemies--the possession of fire-arms, and felt much confidence in consequence.  \"Get out all your weapons, big and little,\" said Rance, as he loaded his rifle, \"and fire 'em off to begin with.  It will show them that we are well prepared.\"  Accordingly they commenced letting off their pieces, and what with rifles, double shot-guns, double and single barrelled pistols, and revolvers, they made up the formidable number of fifty-three discharges, which had a very warlike effect when fired in quick and regular succession.  Carrying these in their hands, and disposed round their persons, intermixed with short swords and long bowie-knives, the whole party mounted guard, bristling like human hedge-hogs, and, placed at equal intervals on each side of the camp, marched about for an hour or two, without seeing or hearing anything more of their enemies.  At last their mule became a little restive, putting them on the alert, and shortly afterwards an arrow whizzed past Joe's ear.  He instantly presented his carbine in the direction whence it came, and fired.  The shot was answered by a perfect shower of arrows, which pierced the clothes of some of the white men, and slightly wounded Douglas in the left arm, but fortunately did no further damage.  The discharge was followed by a quick movement in the bushes, rendered audible by the crushing of dried leaves and breaking of branches.  This guided the whites in their aim, and a volley was poured into the bush, followed by several random shots from revolvers.  Soon after all noise was hushed, and a brief examination of the surrounding bushes was made, but it could not be ascertained that any damage had been done to the Indians, who always make it a point, when possible, to carry off their dead to prevent their being scalped--a dishonour they fear almost as much as death.  \"Now, one half of us may sleep,\" said Rance, when the party was again collected round the fire.  \"Sleep!\" exclaimed Frank.  \"Ay, there's nothing more to fear from the rascals to-night, if we keep a good look-out--and that may be done as effectively by three of us as by six.  If we each get a wink of an hour or two, we shall be quite fit to travel or to fight in the morning.  So let me advise you to lose no time about it.--Not badly hurt, sir, I hope?\" he added, addressing Douglas.  \"Nothing to speak of,\" answered the Scot, \"only a graze of the skin.\"  \"Well, get away to rest.  You can take the second watch, and it is not likely they will disturb you before morning.  If they do, you won't require to be called, so keep your weapons handy.\"  As Rance prophesied, so it turned out.  The Indians had got an unexpectedly severe repulse, and did not attempt to interfere with the travellers during the night, but in the morning they were found to have posted themselves on the opposite banks of the stream, evidently with the intention of disputing the further progress of the party.  Nothing now but prompt determination could save them from being cut off by overwhelming numbers, for if they were to hesitate, or waver in the least, the Indians would be encouraged to make an attack.  They therefore calmly and deliberately blew up the fire, boiled their kettle and had breakfast, after which the mule was loaded, and the party prepared to cross the stream.  Before doing so, however, Rance and Jeffson, being the best marksmen, advanced to the edge of the bank with two of the largest rifles and took aim at the Indians, hoping by that means to frighten them away without being obliged to shed more blood.  In this they failed, for, the distance being fully five hundred yards, the natives evidently believed that it was impossible for a ball to tell at such a distance.  On seeing Rance point his rifle at them they set up a yell of derision.  There was nothing for it, therefore, but to fire.  This Rance did, and one of the Indians fell.  Jeffson also fired and hit the chief, who reeled, but did not fall.  The savages immediately began a hurried retreat, and the travellers refrained from firing, in order to convince them that all they desired was to be allowed to go on their way unmolested.  The crossing of the stream was then effected.  On mounting the opposite bank it was found that the Indians had taken up their position, fully armed, on the top of their huts, with an air of quiet resolution that showed they apprehended an attack, and were prepared to defend their homes to the death.  This, however, they were not called upon to do, for the travellers turned off to the right, and pursued their way as if nothing had happened.  But two of the Indians had been badly hit, perhaps killed, and the thought of this dwelt much on the minds of Frank and his friend Joe all that day.  Another thing that distressed them much was the well-known custom of the natives to take their revenge at the first favourable opportunity.  It was a rule among them to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21727"],["title","Digging for Gold: Adventures in California (#7)"],["body","two lives of white men for every redskin killed, and they were known not to be particular as to who the whites might be,--sufficient for them that they were of the offending and hated race.  The fact that the innocent might thus suffer for the guilty was to them a matter of perfect indifference.  The route over which the whites travelled that day chanced to be unusually picturesque and beautiful.  The path, or \"trail,\"--for there was scarcely anything worthy the name of path,--wound through a sycamore and white-oak grove that fringed the river, the sloping banks of which were covered with an infinite variety of shrubs and evergreens, bearing flowers and blossoms of most delicate beauty and exquisite fragrance, amidst which tangled festoons of the indigenous vine drooped with pendant bunches of purple grapes.  Arbutus shrubs of immense size were seen, and the landscape was in some places interspersed thickly with manzanita rushes, the crimson berries of which are much in favour with the Indians, also with the grizzly bear!  Some of the plains they crossed were studded with magnificent oaks, devoid of underwood, such as one is accustomed to see in noblemen's parks in England.  But all this beauty and luxuriance made comparatively little impression on Frank and Joe, for they could not forget that human life had probably been sacrificed that day--a thought which filled them with sincere regret that it had ever entered into their hearts to go digging for gold.    CHAPTER SIX.  ARRIVAL AT THE GOLD-FIELDS, AND LESSONS IN GOLD-WASHING RECEIVED.  At last Bigbear Gully was reached, and our travellers--especially those of them who, being new to the work, were all enthusiasm--pressed eagerly forward, anxious to begin without delay.  Bigbear Gully--so named because of a huge grizzly bear that had been shot there at the commencement of digging operations--was a wild and somewhat gloomy but picturesque mountain gorge, the first sight of which, with its lights and shadows, stupendous cliffs and clumps of wood clinging to the hill-sides, called forth a burst of delight and admiration from Frank Allfrey, whose mind at once leaped with loving desire to the brush and the colour-box; but as these implements were at that time packed among the baggage on the mule's back, and as the love of art was not sufficiently strong in the guide to induce him to permit of a moment's delay in the journey, our hero was fain to content himself with visions of future indulgence in his favourite study.  The \"diggings,\" which they first got sight of in the afternoon of a fine and sunny but cool day, were at the mouth of a deep gorge at the lower end of the gully, having an abrupt mountain acclivity about eight hundred feet high on one side, and on the other a plain bounded by mountains.  Here numbers of tents of all sizes and various shapes were pitched on the slopes and near the banks of the river that brawled down the centre of the little valley.  No sooner had the travellers entered the camp than the diggers left their work and flocked round them to ask the news, and, more particularly, to ascertain what provisions had been brought to the valley,--for the necessaries of life at that time were getting scarce, and the party from which Frank and his companions had separated, strange to say, had not arrived.  Great anxiety was manifested by the diggers on hearing of this separation, because on the safe and speedy arrival of that party they depended almost for their existence, and deep as well as loud were the expressions of disappointment and discontent when they were told that, if all had gone well, they should have been at the gully some days before.  Soon, however, the diggers had exhausted their queries and returned to their work, leaving the new arrivals to look after their own affairs. This they proceeded to do promptly.  \"Now, friends,\" said Jeffson, \"our journeying together has come to an end, and it remains for you to settle whether you shall keep together and work in company, or separate.  As for me, my business compels me to leave you.  Yonder white tent, which you see about half a mile up the river, belongs to me and my partner.  It is the great economico-universal store of Jeffson and Company, which supplies diggers liberally on the most moderate terms, giving credit as long as it seems advisable to do so.  When Jeffson is absent, Company takes charge of the concern, and it is my opinion that Company will be kind o' glad to-night to see the head of the firm come back safe and sound with fresh supplies.  You see, gentlemen, I feel it sort of incumbent on me to make you a farewell speech as a fellow-traveller, because I mean to become a host for to-night, and ask you to come up to the store and partake of our hospitality.  I am quite sure that you will acquit me of the unworthy motive of wishing to attract you as customers, when I tell you that I am already certain of your custom, seeing that there is no other store in the gully, and I guess you won't be inclined to go down to Sacramento for supplies for some time to come.\"  There was a general laugh at this, followed by a hearty expression of thanks from all the party, who forthwith adjourned to the store, where they found \"Company\" (who was an Irishman named Quin) barely able to keep his legs, in consequence of a violent attack of dysentery which had reduced him to a mere shadow.  The poor man could scarcely refrain from shedding tears of joy at the sight of his partner, who, to do him justice, was almost as much affected by sorrow at the miserable appearance presented by his friend.  \"Sure it's dead I am intirely--all but,\" said Quin, as he wrung Jeffson's hand again and again; \"if ye'd bin a day later it's my belaif I'd have gone under the sod.\"  \"Well, you do look like it, Quin,\" said Jeffson, stepping back to take a more critical view of him.  \"What on airth pulled all the flesh off yer bones in this fashion?\"  \"Sickness, no less.  Faix, there's more than me is in the same fix.  Jim Dander, down at the cross creek, has got so thin that it's of no manner o' use looking at him sideways, he's not quite visible till he turns his flat front to ye.  And Foxey is all but gone; and there's many a man besides as is on the road to the grave, if not there already.  Sure, the doctor's the only man that makes money now, though he kills more than he cures.  The baste called to try his hand on mysilf, but I flung my big boots at his head, an' saw no more of him.\"  \"That's a bad account of things,\" said Jeffson; \"however, here I am back again with fresh supplies, so cheer up, man, and we'll weather the storm yet.  I've brought some fellow-travellers, you see, and hope you will receive them hospitably.\"  \"That must not be,\" said Frank Allfrey, advancing, \"it would be unfair to put your friend to unnecessary trouble, considering the state of weakness to which--\"  \"Waikness, is it?\" exclaimed Quin, seizing Frank's hand and shaking it; \"well, now, it's little I thought I'd iver live to be called waik! Howsever, it's too thrue, but me moral strength is wonderful, so you're heartily welcome, if ye can slaip on a plank floor an' ait salt-pork an' paise.  There, now, don't be botherin' a sick man wid yer assurances. Just make yerselves at home, gintlemen, an' the head o' the firm will git yer supper ready.\"  Saying this, the poor man, who was quite worn out with excitement and the exertion of welcoming his partner, flung himself on his couch with a deep sigh.  As Jeffson also pressed his friends to remain, they made no further objection.  While supper was being prepared, Frank and Joe went out to look at the diggers.  \"Now,\" said the former as they sauntered along the bank of the river, \"the question that you and I must settle at once is, are we two to work by ourselves, or are we to join with our late friends, and work in company?\"  \"Jine 'em, say I,\" replied Joe.  \"I'm fond of Meyer, and I like the Scotchman too, though he is rather fond of argification; besides, it strikes me that from what we have heard of diggers' ways, we shall be the better of being a strong party.\"  \"Four men don't form a very strong party, Joe; however, I agree with you.  It would be well that we four should stick together.  So, that's settled, and now we shall go and ask yonder fellow in the red shirt and big boots something about our prospects.\"  The scene in the midst of which they now found themselves was curious, interesting, and suggestive.  For two miles along its course the banks of the river were studded with tents, and on each side of it were diggers, working at short distances apart, or congregated together, according to the richness of the deposits.  About twenty feet was the space generally allowed at that time to a washing machine.  Most of the diggers worked close to the banks of the stream, others partially diverted its course to get at its bed, which was considered the richest soil.  At one place a company of eighty men had banded together for the purpose of cutting a fresh channel for the river--a proceeding which afterwards resulted in a fierce and fatal affray with the men who worked below them.  Elsewhere on the sides of the mountains and in \"gulches\" formed by torrents, men toiled singly and in twos or threes, with picks, shovels, washing-pans, and cradles.  All were very busy, but all were not equally hopeful, for, while some had been successful in finding the precious metal, others had failed, and were very desponding.  \"Have you had good fortune to-day?\" asked Frank, stopping at the edge of the hole in which the miner with the red shirt toiled.  \"Not very good,\" replied the man, whose voice betokened him an Englishman.  He was an immensely powerful, good-looking fellow, and paused in his work to reply to Frank's question with a hearty air.  \"Have you to dig very deep?\" inquired Frank.  \"Not very,\" he replied; \"the depth varies in different parts of the diggings.  Here it is seldom necessary to go"]]]
