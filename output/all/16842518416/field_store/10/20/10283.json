His father is, or was, a bird-fancier and seller of penny articles on the streets, besides being a professional pugilist.  You will be the better for protection there, sir.  I would advise you not to go alone.  If you can wait for five or ten minutes,\" added Giles, \"I shall be off duty and will be happy to accompany you.\"  Sir Richard agreed to wait.  Within the time mentioned Giles was relieved, and, entering a cab with his friends, drove towards Whitechapel.  They had to pass near our policeman's lodgings on the way.  \"Would you object, sir, stopping at my house for five minutes?\" he asked.  \"Certainly not,\" returned the knight, \"I am in no hurry.\"  Number 666 stopped the cab, leaped out and disappeared through a narrow passage.  In less than five minutes a very tall gentlemanly man issued from the same passage and approached them.  Little Di opened her blue eyes to their very uttermost.  It was _her_ policeman in plain clothes!  She did not like the change at all at first, but before the end of the drive got used to him in his new aspect--all the more readily that he seemed to have cast off much of his stiffness and reserve with his blue skin.  Near the metropolitan railway station in Whitechapel the cab was dismissed, and Giles led the father and child along the crowded thoroughfare until they reached Commercial Street, along which they proceeded a short distance.  \"We are now near some of the worst parts of London, sir,\" said Giles, \"where great numbers of the criminal and most abandoned characters dwell.\"  \"Indeed,\" said Sir Richard, who did not seem to be much gratified by the information.  As for Di, she was nearly crying.  The news that _her_ boy was a thief and was born in the midst of such naughty people had fallen with chilling influence on her heart, for she had never thought of anything but the story-book \"poor but honest parents!\"  \"What large building is that?\" inquired the knight, who began to wish that he had not given way to his daughter's importunities, \"the one opposite, I mean, with placards under the windows.\"  \"That is the well-known Home of Industry, instituted and managed by Miss Macpherson and a staff of volunteer workers.  They do a deal of good, sir, in this neighbourhood.\"  \"Ah! indeed,\" said Sir Richard, who had never before heard of the Home of Industry.  \"And, pray, what particular industry does this Miss Mac-- what did you call her?\"  \"Macpherson.  The lady, you know, who sends out so many rescued waifs and strays to Canada, and spends all her time in caring for the poorest of the poor in the East-End and in preaching the gospel to them.  You've often seen accounts of her work, no doubt, in the _Christian_?\"  \"Well--n-no.  I read the _Times_, but, now you mention it, I have some faint remembrance of seeing reference to such matters.  Very self-denying, no doubt, and praiseworthy, though I must say that I doubt the use of preaching the gospel to such persons.  From what I have seen of these lowest people I should think they were too deeply sunk in depravity to be capable of appreciating the lofty and sublime sentiments of Christianity.\"  Number 666 felt a touch of surprise at these words, though he was too well-bred a policeman to express his feelings by word or look.  In fact, although not pre-eminently noted for piety, he had been led by training, and afterwards by personal experience, to view this matter from a very different standpoint from that of Sir Richard.  He made no reply, however, but, turning round the corner of the Home of Industry, entered a narrow street which bore palpable evidence of being the abode of deepest poverty.  From the faces and garments of the inhabitants it was also evidently associated with the deepest depravity.  As little Di saw some of the residents sitting on their doorsteps with scratched faces, swelled lips and cheeks, and dishevelled hair, and beheld the children in half-naked condition rolling in the kennel and extremely filthy, she clung closer to her father's side and began to suspect there were some phases of life she had never seen--had not even dreamt of!  What the knight's thoughts were we cannot tell, for he said nothing, but disgust was more prominent than pity on his fine countenance.  Those who sat on the doorsteps, or lolled with a dissipated air against the door-posts, seemed to appreciate him at his proper value, for they scowled at him as he passed.  They recognised Number 666, however, (perhaps by his bearing), and gave him only a passing glance of indifference.  \"You said it would be dangerous for me to come here by myself,\" said Sir Richard, turning to Giles, as he entered another and even worse street. \"Are they then so violent?\"  \"Many of them are among the worst criminals in London, sir.  Here is the court of which you are in search: Roy's Court.\"  As he spoke, Ned Frog staggered out of his own doorway, clenched his fists, and looked with a vindictive scowl at the strangers.  A second glance induced him to unclench his fists and reel round the corner on his way to a neighbouring grog-shop.  Whatever other shops may decay in that region, the grog-shops, like noxious weeds, always flourish.  The court was apparently much deserted at that hour, for the men had not yet returned from their work--whatever that might be--and most of the women were within doors.  \"This is the house,\" continued Giles, descending the few steps, and tapping at the door; \"I have been here before.  They know me.\"  The door was opened by Hetty, and for the first time since entering those regions of poverty and crime, little Di felt a slight rise in her spirits, for through Hetty's face shone the bright spirit within; albeit the shining was through some dirt and dishevelment, good principle not being able altogether to overcome the depressing influences of extreme poverty and suffering.  \"Is your mother at home, Hetty!\"  \"Oh! yes, sir.  Mother, here's Mr Scott.  Come in, sir.  We are so glad to see you, and--\"  She stopped, and gazed inquiringly at the visitors who followed.  \"I've brought some friends of Bobby to inquire for him.  Sir Richard Brandon--Mrs Frog.\"  Number 666 stood aside, and, with something like a smile on his face, ceremoniously presented Wealth to Poverty.  Wealth made a slightly confused bow to Poverty, and Poverty, looking askance at Wealth, dropt a mild courtesy.  \"Vell now, I'm a Dutchman if it ain't the hangel!\" exclaimed a voice in the corner of the small room, before either Wealth or Poverty could utter a word.  \"Oh! it's _my_ boy,\" exclaimed Di with delight, forgetting or ignoring the poverty, dirt, and extremely bad air, as she ran forward and took hold of Bobby's hand.  It was a pre-eminently dirty hand, and formed a remarkable contrast to the little hands that grasped it!  The small street boy was, for the first time in his life, bereft of speech!  When that faculty returned, he remarked in language which was obscure to Di:--  \"Vell, if this ain't a go!\"  \"What is a go?\" asked Di with innocent surprise.  Instead of answering, Bobby Frog burst into a fit of laughter, but stopped rather suddenly with an expression of pain.  \"Oh! 'old on!  I say.  This won't do.  Doctor 'e said I musn't larf, 'cause it shakes the leg too much.  But, you know, wot's a cove to do ven a hangel comes to him and axes sitch rum questions?\"  Again he laughed, and again stopped short in pain.  \"I'm _so_ sorry!  Does it feel _very_ painful?  You can't think how constantly I've been thinking of you since the accident; for it was all my fault.  If I hadn't jumped up in such a passion, the pony wouldn't have run away, and you wouldn't have been hurt.  I'm so _very, very_ sorry, and I got dear papa to bring me here to tell you so, and to see if we could do anything to make you well.\"  Again Bobby was rendered speechless, but his mind was active.  \"Wot!  I ain't dreamin', am I?  'As a hangel _really_ come to my bedside all the vay from the Vest-end, an' brought 'er dear pa'--vich means the guv'nor, I fancy--all for to tell me--a kid whose life is spent in `movin' on'--that she's wery, wery, sorry I've got my leg broke, an' that she's bin an' done it, an' she would like to know if she can do hanythink as'll make me vell!  But it ain't true.  It's a big lie!  I'm dreamin', that's all.  I've been took to hospital, an' got d'lirious-- that's wot it is.  I'll try to sleep!\"  With this end in view he shut his eyes, and remained quite still for a few seconds, and when Di looked at his pinched and pale face in this placid condition, the tears _would_ overflow their natural boundary, and sobs _would_ rise up in her pretty throat, but she choked them back for fear of disturbing her boy.  Presently the boy opened his eyes.  \"Wot, are you there yet?\" he asked.  \"Oh yes.  Did you think I was going away?\" she replied, with a look of innocent surprise.  \"I won't leave you now.  I'll stay here and nurse you, if papa will let me.  I have slept once on a shake-down, when I was forced by a storm to stay all night at a juv'nile party.  So if you've a corner here, it will do nicely--\"  \"My dear child,\" interrupted her amazed father, \"you are talking nonsense.  And--do keep a little further from the bed.  There may be-- you know--infection--\"  \"Oh! you needn't fear infection here, sir,\" said Mrs Frog, somewhat sharply.  \"We are poor enough, God knows, though I _have_ seen better times, but we keep ourselves pretty clean, though we can't afford to spend much on soap when food is so dear, and money so scarce--so _very_ scarce!\"  \"Forgive me, my good woman,\" said Sir Richard, hastily, \"I did not mean to offend, but circumstances would seem to favour the idea--of--of--\"  And here Wealth--although a bank director and chairman of several boards, and capable of making a neat, if weakly, speech on economic laws and the currency when occasion required--was dumb before Poverty.

IN WHICH THE TALE BEGINS SOMEWHAT FURIOUSLY.  By the early light of a bright summer morning, long, long ago, two small boats were seen to issue from one of the fiords or firths on the west coast of Norway, and row towards the skerries or low rocky islets that lay about a mile distant from the mainland.  Although the morning was young, the sun was already high in the heavens, and brought out in glowing colours the varied characteristics of a mountain scene of unrivalled grandeur.  The two shallops moved swiftly towards the islands, their oars shivering the liquid mirror of the sea, and producing almost the only sound that disturbed the universal stillness, for at that early hour Nature herself seemed buried in deep repose.  A silvery mist hung over the water, through which the innumerable rocks and islands assumed fantastic shapes, and the more distant among them appeared as though they floated in air.  A few seagulls rose startled from their nests, and sailed upwards with plaintive cries, as the keels of the boats grated on the rocks, and the men stepped out and hauled them up on the beach of one of the islets.  A wild uncouth crew were those Norsemen of old!  All were armed, for in their days the power and the means of self-defence were absolutely necessary to self-preservation.  Most of them wore portions of scale armour, or shirts of ring mail, and headpieces of steel, though a few among them appeared to have confidence in the protection afforded by the thick hide of the wolf, which, converted into rude, yet not ungraceful, garments, covered their broad shoulders.  All, without exception, carried sword or battle-axe and shield.  They were goodly stalwart men every one, but silent and stern.  It might have been observed that the two boats, although bound for the same islet, did not row in company.  They were beached as far from each other as the little bay into which they ran would admit of, and the crews stood aloof in two distinct groups.  In the centre of each group stood a man who, from his aspect and bearing, appeared to be superior to his fellows.  One was in the prime of life, dark and grave; the other in the first flush of manhood, full grown, though beardless, fair, and ruddy.  Both were taller and stouter than their comrades.  The two men had met there to fight, and the cause of their feud was-- Love!  Both loved a fair Norse maiden in Horlingdal.  The father of the maid favoured the elder warrior; the maid herself preferred the younger.  In those days, barbarous though they undoubtedly were, law and justice were more respected and more frequently appealed to in Norway than in almost any other country.  Liberty, crushed elsewhere under the deadweight of feudalism, found a home in the bleak North, and a rough but loving welcome from the piratical, sea-roving!  She did not, indeed, dwell altogether scathless among her demi-savage guardians, who, if their perceptions of right and wrong were somewhat confused, might have urged in excuse that their light was small.  She received many shocks and frequent insults from individuals, but liberty was sincerely loved and fondly cherished by the body of the Norwegian people, through all the period of those dark ages during which other nations scarce dared to mention her name.  Nevertheless, it was sometimes deemed more convenient to settle disputes by the summary method of an appeal to arms than to await the issue of a tedious and uncertain lawsuit such an appeal being perfectly competent to those who preferred it, and the belief being strong among the fiery spirits of the age that Odin, the god of war, would assuredly give victory to the right.  In the present instance it was not considered any infringement of the law of liberty that the issue of the combat would be the disposal of a fair woman's hand, with or without her heart.  Then, as now, women were often forced to marry against their will.  Having gone to that island to fight--an island being a naturally circumscribed battlefield whose limits could not conveniently be transgressed--the two champions set to work at once with the cool businesslike promptitude of men sprung from a warlike race, and nurtured from their birth in the midst of war's alarms.  Together, and without speaking, they ascended the rock, which was low and almost barren, with a small extent of turf in the centre, level, and admirably suited to their purpose.  Here they faced each other; the one drew his sword, the other raised his battle-axe.  There was no sentiment in that combat.  The times and the men were extremely matter-of-fact.  The act of slaying gracefully had not yet been acquired; yet there was much of manly grace displayed as each threw himself into the position that nature and experience had taught him was best suited to the wielding of his peculiar weapon.  For one instant each gazed intently into the face of the other, as if to read there his premeditated plan of attack.  At that moment the clear blue eye of the younger man dilated, and, as his courage rose, the colour mounted to his cheek.  The swart brow of the other darkened as he marked the change; then, with sudden spring and shout, the two fell upon each other and dealt their blows with incredible vigour and rapidity.  They were a well-matched pair.  For nearly two hours did they toil and moil over the narrow limits of that sea-girt rock--yet victory leaned to neither side.  Now the furious blows rained incessant on the sounding shields; anon the din of strife ceased, while the combatants moved round each other, shifting their position with elastic step, as, with wary motion and eagle glances, each sought to catch the other off his guard, and the clash of steel, as the weapons met in sudden onset, was mingled with the shout of anger or defiance.  The sun glanced on whirling blade and axe, and sparkled on their coats of mail as if the lightning flash were playing round them; while screaming seamews flew and circled overhead, as though they regarded with intelligent interest and terror the mortal strife that was going on below.  Blood ere long began to flow freely on both sides; the vigour of the blows began to abate, the steps to falter.  The youthful cheek grew pale; the dark warrior's brow grew darker, while heaving chests, labouring breath, and an occasional gasp, betokened the approaching termination of the struggle.  Suddenly the youth, as if under the influence of a new impulse, dropped his shield, sprang forward, raised himself to his full height, grasped his axe with both hands, and, throwing it aloft (thus recklessly exposing his person), brought it down with terrific violence on the shield of his adversary.  The action was so sudden that the other, already much exhausted, was for the moment paralysed, and failed to take advantage of his opportunity. He met but failed to arrest the blow with his shield.  It was crushed down upon his head, and in another moment the swarthy warrior lay stretched upon the turf.  Sternly the men conveyed their fallen chief to his boat, and rowed him to the mainland, and many a week passed by ere he recovered from the effects of the blow that felled him.  His conqueror returned to have his wounds dressed by the bride for whom he had fought so long and so valiantly on that bright summer morning.  Thus it was that King Haldor of Horlingdal, surnamed the Fierce, conquered King Ulf of Romsdal, acquired his distinctive appellation, and won Herfrida the Soft-eyed for his bride.  It must not be supposed that these warriors were kings in the ordinary acceptation of that term.  They belonged to the class of \"small\" or petty kings, of whom there were great numbers in Norway in those days, and were merely rich and powerful free-landholders or udallers.  Haldor the Fierce had a large family of sons and daughters.  They were all fair, strong, and extremely handsome, like himself.  Ulf of Romsdal did not die of his wounds, neither did he die of love. Disappointed love was then, as now, a terrible disease, but not necessarily fatal.  Northmen were very sturdy in the olden time.  They almost always recovered from that disease sooner or later.  When his wounds were healed, Ulf married a fair girl of the Horlingdal district, and went to reside there, but his change of abode did not alter his title.  He was always spoken of as Ulf of Romsdal.  He and his old enemy Haldor the Fierce speedily became fast friends; and so was it with their wives, Astrid and Herfrida, who also took mightily to each other.  They span, and carded wool, and sewed together oftentimes, and discussed the affairs of Horlingdal, no doubt with mutual advantage and satisfaction.  Twenty years passed away, and Haldor's eldest son, Erling, grew to be a man.  He was very like his father--almost a giant in size; fair, very strong, and remarkably handsome.  His silken yellow hair fell in heavy curls on a pair of the broadest shoulders in the dale.  Although so young, he already had a thick short beard, which was very soft and curly.  His limbs were massive, but they were so well proportioned, and his movements so lithe, that his great size and strength were not fully appreciated until one stood close by his side or fell into his powerful grasp.  Erling was lion-like, yet he was by nature gentle and retiring.  He had a kindly smile, a hearty laugh, and bright blue eyes.  Had he lived in modern days he would undoubtedly have been a man of peace.  But he lived \"long long ago\"--therefore he was a man of war.  Being unusually fearless, his companions of the valley called him Erling the Bold.  He was, moreover, extremely fond of the sea, and often went on viking cruises in his own ships, whence he was also styled Erling the Sea-king, although he did not at that time possess a foot of land over which to exercise kingly authority.  Now, it must be explained here that the words Sea-king and Viking do not denote the same thing.  One is apt "]]]
