Still the bare hope of this induced them to rise in haste.  After a hurried breakfast on the remnants of the previous night's supper, they proceeded along the coast for several miles, carefully searching the shores of every bay.  About noon they halted.  A few scraps of the dried meat still remained, and on these they dined, sitting on a grassy slope, while they consulted as to their future proceedings.  \"What is now to be done?\" asked the captain of Bladud, after they had been seated in silence for some minutes.  \"I would rather hear your opinion first,\" returned his friend.  \"You must still continue to act as captain, for it is fitting that age should sit at the helm, while I will act the part of guide and forester, seeing that I am somewhat accustomed to woodcraft.\"  \"And the remainder of our band,\" said little Maikar, wiping his mouth after finishing the last morsel, \"will sit in judgment on your deliberations.\"  \"Be it so,\" returned Bladud.  \"Wisdom, it is said, lies in small compass, so we should find it in you.\"  Captain Arkal, whose knitted brows and downcast eyes showed that his thoughts were busy, looked up suddenly.  \"It is not likely,\" he said, \"that any ships will come near this coast, for the gale has driven us far out of the usual track of trading ships, and there are no towns here, large or small, that I know of.  It would be useless, therefore, to remain where we are in the hope of being picked up by a passing vessel.  To walk back to our home in the east is next to impossible, for it is not only far distant, but there lie between us and Hellas far-reaching gulfs and bays, besides great mountain ranges, which have never yet been crossed, for their tops are in the clouds and covered, summer and winter, with eternal snow.\"  \"Then no hope remains to us,\" said Maikar, with a sigh, \"except to join ourselves to the wild people of the land--if there be any people at all in it--and live and die like savages.\"  \"Patience, Maikar, I have not yet finished.\"  \"Besides,\" interpolated Bladud, \"a wise judge never delivers an opinion until he has heard both sides of a question.\"  \"Now, from my knowledge of the lie of coast-lands, I feel sure that the Isles of the Cassiterides must lie there,\" continued the captain, pointing westward, \"and if we travel diligently, it is not unlikely that we shall come down upon the coast of this land almost opposite to them. There we may find, or perhaps make, a boat in which we could cross over--for the sea at that part is narrow, and the white cliffs of the land will be easily distinguished.  Once there, I have no doubt that we shall find a ship belonging to one of my countrymen which will take Maikar and me back to our homes, while you, prince, will doubtless be able to return to your father's court on foot.\"  It will be seen from this speech that the Phoenician captain included the southern shore of England in his idea of the Cassiterides.  His notion of the direction in which the islands lay, however, was somewhat incorrect, being founded partly on experience, but partly also on a misconception prevalent at the time that the islands referred to lay only a little way to the north of Spain.  \"Your plan seems to me a good one,\" said Bladud, after some thought, \"but I cannot help thinking that you are not quite right in your notion as to the direction of the tin islands.  When I left Albion, I kept a careful note of our daily runs--being somewhat curious on such points-- and it is my opinion that they lie _there_.\"  He pointed almost due north.  The captain smiled and shook his head. Bladud looked at Maikar, who also smiled and shook his head.  \"If you want my opinion,\" said the little man, gravely, \"it is that when two great, good and wise men differ so widely, it is more than likely the truth lies somewhere between them.  In _my_ judgment, therefore, the Cassiterides lie yonder.\"  He pointed with an air of confidence in a north-west direction.  \"It does seem to me,\" said Bladud, \"that Maikar is right, for as you and I seem to be equally confident in our views, captain, a middle course may be the safest.  However, if you decide otherwise, I of course submit.\"  \"Nay,\" returned the captain, \"I will not abuse the power you have given me.  Let us decide the matter by lot.\"  \"Ay, let us draw lots,\" echoed Maikar, \"and so shove the matter off our shoulders on to the shoulders of chance.\"  \"There is, there can be, no such thing as chance,\" said Bladud in a soliloquising tone.  \"However, let it be as you wish.  I recognise the justice of two voices overriding one.\"  Lots were drawn accordingly, and the longest fell to the little seaman. Without further discussion, therefore, the course suggested by him was adopted.  \"And now, comrades,\" said the prince, rising and drawing his knife-- which, like his sword, had been procured in Egypt, and was of white metal--\"we must set to work to make bows and arrows, for animals are not wont to walk up to man and request to be killed and cooked, and it won't be long before Maikar is shouting for food.\"  \"Sorry am I that the good javelin of my grandfather went down in the carcase of the pirate chief,\" remarked the captain, also rising, \"for it seems to me by the way you handled it, Bladud, that you could have killed deer with it as well as men.\"  \"I have killed deer with such before now, truly, but the arrow is handier and surer.\"  \"Ay, in a sure hand, with a good eye to direct it,\" returned Arkal, \"but I make no pretence to either.  A ship, indeed, I can manage to hit--when I am cool, which is not often the case in a fight--and if there are men in it, my shafts are not quite thrown away, but as to deer, boars, and birds, I can make nothing of them.  If I mistake not, Maikar is not much better than myself with the bow.\"  \"I am worse,\" observed the little man quietly.  \"Well then,\" said Bladud, with a laugh, \"you must make me hunter to the party.\"  While conversing thus they had entered the forest, and soon found trees suitable to their purpose, from which they cut boughs,--using their swords as hatchets.  We have already shown that the prince had brought his sword, shield, and knife on shore with him.  Captain Arkal and Maikar had also saved their swords and knives, these having been attached to their girdles at the time they leaped from the wreck.  They were somewhat inferior weapons to those worn by Bladud, being made of bronze.  The swords of the seamen, unlike that of the prince, were short and double-edged, shaped somewhat like those used long afterwards by the Romans, and they made up in weight for what they lacked in sharpness.  It did not take many hours for the party, under the direction of the prince, to form three strong and serviceable bows, with several arrows, the latter being feathered with dropped plumes, and shod with flint, according to the fashion of the times.  Bowstrings had to be made at first out of the tough fibrous roots of a tree, split into threads and plaited together.  \"Of course they are not so good as deer-sinews for the purpose,\" remarked Bladud, stringing one of the bows and fitting an arrow to it, \"but we must be content until we kill a deer or some other animal. Perhaps we shall have an opportunity soon.\"  The remark seemed to have been prophetic, for, as the last word passed his lips, a fawn trotted out of a glade right in front of the party and stood as if paralysed with surprise.  The captain and Maikar were reduced to much the same condition, for they made no attempt to use their bows.  \"Ho!--\" exclaimed the former, but he got no further, for at the moment Bladud's bow twanged, and an arrow quivered in the breast of the fawn, which fell dead without a struggle.  \"Well done!\" exclaimed the captain heartily.  \"If such luck always attends you, prince, we shall fare well on our journey.\"  \"It was not altogether luck,\" returned the other.  \"See you that spot on the bark of yonder tree--about the size of Maikar's mouth as it now gapes in astonishment?\"  \"I see it, clear enough--just over the--\"  He stopped abruptly, for while he was yet speaking an arrow quivered in the centre of the spot referred to.  After that the captain talked no more about \"luck,\" and Maikar, shutting his mouth with a snap, as if he felt that no words could do justice to his feelings, sprang up and hastened to commence the operation of flaying and cutting up the fawn.  Having thus provided themselves with food, they spent the rest of the day in preparing it for the journey by drying it in the sun; in making tough and serviceable bowstrings out of the sinews of the fawn, fitting on arrow-heads and feathers, and otherwise arranging for a prolonged march through a country which was entirely unknown to them, both as to its character and its inhabitants.  \"It comes into my head,\" said the captain, \"that Maikar and I must provide ourselves with shields and spears of some sort, for if the people of the land are warlike, we may have to defend ourselves.\"  \"That is as you say,\" returned the prince, rising as he spoke and going towards a long straight bough of a neighbouring tree, on which he had fixed a critical gaze.  With one sweep of his heavy sword he severed it from the stem and returned to his companions.  \"Have you taken an ill-will at that tree, or were you only testing the strength of your arm?\" asked Maikar.  \"Neither, my friend; but I must have a javelin to make my equipment complete, and I would advise you and the captain to provide yourselves with like weapons, for we may meet with four-footed as well as two-legged foes in these parts.  I will show you how to point the things with flint.\"  \"That is well said,\" returned the seaman, rising and going into the woods in search of a suitable branch, followed by the captain.  It was late that night before the weapons were shaped"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21757"],["title","The Hot Swamp (#7)"],["body","pointed with flint and all ready for a start on the following morning--the only thing wanting to complete their armament being a couple of shields.  \"We are sure to meet with a wild boar or a bull before long, or it may be a bear,\" said Maikar, \"and the hides of any of these will serve our purpose well.\"  \"That is, if we use them well,\" remarked the captain.  \"No one said otherwise,\" retorted Maikar.  \"Some people are so full of wise thoughts that they blurt them out, without reason, apparently to get rid of them.\"  \"Just so, Maikar, therefore blurt out no more, but hold thy tongue and go to sleep.  Good-night.\"  CHAPTER SEVEN.  CONVERSE AND ADVENTURES BY THE WAY.  Day was just beginning to break in the east when the prince raised his head from the bundle of leaves that had formed his pillow, and looked sleepily around him.  His companions lay still, sound asleep and sprawling, in all the _abandon_ characteristic of the heroes of antiquity.  Some of these characteristics were wonderfully similar to those of modern heroes.  For instance, the captain lay flat on his back with his mouth wide open, and a musical solo proceeding from his nose; while Maikar lay on his side with his knees doubled up, his arms extended at full length in front of him, and his hands tightly clasped as if, while pleading with some one for mercy, he was suddenly petrified and had fallen over on his side.  Rising softly, Bladud took up his bow and quiver, and, buckling on his sword, left the encampment without disturbing the sleepers.  He had not proceeded more than a mile when he startled several wild turkeys or birds of that species from their rest.  One of these he instantly brought down.  Following them up he soon shot another, and returned to camp, where he found his comrades as he had left them--the musical nose being if anything more emphatic than before.  Although naturally a grave man, Bladud was by no means destitute of a sense of humour, or disinclined on occasion to perpetrate a practical joke.  After contemplating the sleepers for a moment he retired a few paces and concealed himself in the long grass, from which position he pitched one of the huge birds into the air, so that it fell on the captain's upturned visage.  The snore changed at once into a yell of alarm, as the mariner sprang up and grasped his sword, which, of course, lay handy beside him.  Electrified by the yell, Maikar also leaped to his feet, sword in hand.  \"What d'ye mean by that?\" cried the captain, turning on him fiercely.  \"What mean _you_ by it?\" replied Maikar with equal ferocity.  He had barely uttered the words, when the second turkey hit him full in the face and tumbled him over the ashes of the fortunately extinguished fire.  \"Come, come!\" interposed the prince, stepping forward with a deprecating smile; \"there should be no quarrelling among friends, especially at the beginning of a long journey.  See, I have fetched your breakfast for you.  Instead of tumbling on the fire and putting it out, Maikar, I think it would be wiser to see if there is a spark left and blow it into a flame.  Quick!  I am hungry.\"  It need hardly be said that these orders were received with a laugh and a prompt obedience on the part of the little man.  \"Yes--there is fire,\" he said, blowing with tremendous energy until flame was produced.  \"And, do you know, there is something within me that has a loud voice, but only utters one word--`Food! food! food!' There, now, you may get the birds ready, for the fire will be ready for them in two winks.\"  There was no occasion, however, to give this advice to his friends, for already the birds had been plucked, split open at the breast, laid flat, and their interiors scraped out in a summary manner.  The plucking was not, indeed, all that could be wished, but what fingers failed to do a singe in the flames accomplished to the perfect satisfaction of men who were in no way particular.  Sharp-pointed sticks were then thrust through the expanded carcases, and they were stuck up in front of the blaze to roast.  Underdone meat is an abomination to some, a luxury to others--reminding one of that very ancient proverb, \"Tastes differ.\"  We cannot say whether on this occasion the uniformity of action in our heroes was the result of taste or haste, but certain it is that before the fowls were only half-roasted on one side, they were turned over so as to let the fire get at the other, and breakfast was begun while the meat was yet frightfully underdone.  Thereafter the three men arose, like giants refreshed--if we may say so, for Maikar was indeed mentally, though not physically, a giant--buckled on their swords, slung bows and quivers on their backs, along with the turkey remains, and took up shields and javelins.  Having laid their course by the stars the night before, they set out on their journey through the unknown wilderness.  The part of the country through which they passed at the beginning of the march was broken and diversified by hill and dale; in some places clothed with forests, in others covered with grass, on which many wild animals were seen browsing.  These, however, were remarkably timid, and fled at the first sign of the approaching travellers, so that it was impossible to get within bow-shot of them.  \"From this I judge that they are much hunted,\" said Bladud, halting on a ridge to note the wild flight, of a herd of deer which had just caught eight of them.  \"If so, we are likely to fall in with the hunters before long, I fear,\" remarked the captain.  \"Why do you fear?\" asked Maikar.  \"Because they may be numerous and savage, and may take a fancy to make slaves of us, and as we number only three we could not resist their fancy without losing our lives.\"  \"That would be a pity,\" returned Maikar, \"for we have only one life to lose.\"  \"No; we have three lives to lose amongst us,\" objected the captain.  \"Which makes one each, does it not?\" retorted the seaman.  \"True, Maikar, and we must lose them all, and more if we had them, rather than become slaves.\"  \"You are right, captain.  We never, _never_ shall be slaves,\" said Bladud.  They say that history repeats itself.  Perhaps sentiment does the same. At all events, the British prince gave utterance that day to a well-known sentiment, which has been embalmed in modern song and shouted by many a Briton with tremendous enthusiasm--though not absolute truth.  \"Captain Arkal,\" said the little seaman, as they jogged quietly down the sunny slope of a hill, at the bottom of which was a marsh full of rushes, \"how do you manage to find your way through such a tangled country as this?\"  \"By observing the stars,\" answered the captain.  \"But I have observed the stars since I was a little boy,\" objected Maikar, \"and I see nothing but a wild confusion of shining points.  How can these guide you?  Besides, there are no stars in the daytime.\"  \"True, Maikar; but we have the sun during the day.\"  Maikar shook his head perplexedly.  \"Listen,\" said the captain, \"and I will try to enlighten your dark mind; but don't object else you'll never understand.  All stars are not alike--d'ye understand that?\"  \"Any fool could understand that!\"  \"Well, then, of course _you_ can understand it.  Now, you have noticed, no doubt, that some stars are in groups, which groups may alter their position with regard to other groups, but which never change with regard to each other.\"  \"Each other,\" repeated Maikar, checking off each statement with a nod and a wave of his javelin.  \"Well,\" continued the captain, \"there's one group of stars--about six-- plainly to be seen on most fine nights, two stars of which are always pretty much in a line with a little star a short way in front of them-- d'ye see?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, that star shows exactly where the cold regions lie--over _there_ (extending his arm and pointing), and of course if you know that the cold regions lie _there_, you know that the hot regions must lie at your back--there, and it follows that the Pillars of Hercules lie _there_ (pointing west), and home lies somewhere about _there_ (pointing eastward).\"  \"Stop!\" cried Maikar in great perplexity--for although a seaman he was densely ignorant.  \"Hot regions, _there_, cold, _there_, home and the Pillars, _there_, and _there_, and _there_ (thrusting his arms out in all directions).  I've no more idea of where you've got me to now than-- than--\"  \"Oh, never mind,\" interrupted the captain, \"it doesn't matter, as you are not our guide.  But, ho! look! look! down in the hollow there--among the rushes.  What's that?\"  \"A boar!\" said Bladud, in a low whisper, as he unslung his bow.  \"Come, now, it will take all our united force to slay that brute, for, if I have not lost my power of judging such game, I'm pretty sure that he's a very big old boar with formidable tusks.\"  While the prince was speaking, his comrades had also prepared their weapons, and looked to their guide for directions.  These were hastily but clearly given.  As the boar was evidently asleep in his lair, it was arranged that the three friends should stalk him, as the broken ground was specially favourable for such a mode of attack.  \"We will advance together,\" said Bladud, \"with our bows ready.  I will lead; you follow close.  When we get within range you will do as you see me do, and be sure that you aim at the brute's side--not at his head. Send your arrows with all the force you can.  Then drop the bows and get your javelins ready.\"  With eager looks the captain and little sailor nodded assent.  They were much excited, having often heard tales of boar-hunting, though neither of them had ever taken part in that work.  A few minutes' walk brought them to the edge of the rushes, where they had a fair view of the monstrous animal as it lay fully extended on its side, and not more than thirty yards distant.  \"Take him just behind the fore-leg,\" whispered Bladud, as he drew his bow.  His companions followed his example.  Two of the bows twanged"]]]
