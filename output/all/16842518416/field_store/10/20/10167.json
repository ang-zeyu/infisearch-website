Ballantyne  ________________________________________________________________________  As so often with Ballantyne's books there are really several tales all told in parallel in this book.  There is the story of the seaman Gaff and his son Billy, there is the story of Mrs  Gaff, there is Haco Barepoles, there is Captain Bingley and his son Gildart, there is the Stuart family.  All these characters are very well drawn, and their lives merge together and move apart to a surprising degree.  With a fundamentally Christian message, this book also depicts the work of the Shipwrecked Mariners and Fishermen Institution.  Although there are incidents at sea, most of the action takes place in the small fishing village of Wreckumoft, and the town of Athenbury.  One of the great values of Ballantyne's books is the insight he gives into life in Britain in the nineteenth century, not just the day-to-day lives of the actors, but the motives that propel them, and the upbringing that these actors had.  We are, however, mystified by the title, which made one think that the book might be something to do with ballooning!  Robert Michael Ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894.  He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, and in 1841 he became a clerk with the Hudson Bay Company, working at the Red River Settlement in Northen Canada until 1847, arriving back in Edinburgh in 1848.  The letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life, and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters.  Three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade, \"The Young Fur Traders\", \"Ungava\", \"The Hudson Bay Company\", and were based on his experiences with the HBC.  In this period he also wrote \"The Coral island\" and \"Martin Rattler\", both of these taking place in places never visited by Ballantyne.  Having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books, he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about.  With these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers.  He researched the Cornish Mines, the London Fire Brigade, the Postal Service, the Railways, the laying down of submarine telegraph cables, the construction of light-houses, the light-ship service, the life- boat service, South Africa, Norway, the North Sea fishing fleet, ballooning, deep-sea diving, Algiers, and many more, experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time, and he lived as they lived.  He was a very true-to-life author, depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail.  His young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books, and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen, sometimes four in a year, all very good reading.  The rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life, but the quality never failed.  He published over ninety books under his own name, and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym \"Comus\".  For today's taste his books are perhaps a little too religious, and what we would nowadays call \"pi\".  In part that was the way people wrote in those days, but more important was the fact that in his days at the Red River Settlement, in the wilds of Canada, he had been a little dissolute, and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave, as he felt he had been.  Some of his books were quite short, little over 100 pages.  These books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents, having less pocket-money.  These books are particularly well-written and researched, because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money.  They were published as six series, three books in each series.

THE COTTAGE AND ITS INMATES.  The family board was spread; the family kettle--an unusually fat one-- was singing on the fire, and the family chimney was roaring like a lion by reason of the wind, which blew a hurricane outside, and shook the family mansion, a small wooden hut, to its foundations.  The hour was midnight.  This fact was indicated by the family clock--a Dutch one, with a face which had once been white, but was now become greenish yellow, probably from horror at the profanity of the artist who had painted a basket of unrecognisable fruit above it, an irate cockatoo below it, and a blue church with a pink steeple as near to the centre of it as the hands would admit of.  The family circle, consisting of a stout good-looking woman of thirty or thereabouts, and a little boy and girl, were of the fisher class, obviously so to the senses of sight and smell.  They sat by the fire.  It was an unusual hour for supper, but then it was an unusually wild night, and the frequent glance cast by the woman at the Dutch clock with the horrified countenance, showed clearly that the board was not spread for the family meal, but that they waited up for some absent one.  I have said that the family circle sat by the fire, but this is not strictly correct.  One member of it, the little boy, stood in the middle of the room, howling!--howling so violently that his fat face had changed from its wonted bright red to deep purple.  Looking at him--as he stood there arrayed in his uncle's red night-cap, his own night-shirt, which was also a day-shirt and much too small, and his father's pea-jacket, which was preposterously too large--one could not avoid the alarming surmise that there _might_ be such a thing as juvenile apoplexy, and that that boy was on the point of becoming a living, if not a dead, example of the terrible disease.  Oh! it was a sweet child, a charming infant, altogether a delightful creature to look upon, that son of Stephen Gaff, as it stood there yelling like a hyena, stamping like a mad bull, washing its dirty hands in tears on its dirtier cheeks, cramming its little knuckles into its swollen eyes as if it sought to burst the organs of vision in their sockets, and presenting, generally, an appearance of rampant rage and woe that baffles all capacity of conception, and therefore defies all power of description.  This cherub's name was Billy,--Billy Gaff; more familiarly known amongst his friends as \"The Bu'ster,\" owing to his tendency to explode into tears, or laughter, or mischief, or fun, as the case might be.  He was about eleven years of age.  My own name, reader, is Bingley.  Having retired on half-pay from the Royal Navy, I reside in a pleasant cottage in the suburbs of the well-known and important seaport town of Wreckumoft, situate on the east coast of England.  My front windows command a magnificent view of the sea; my back windows command an equally magnificent view of landscape. I have a magnificent wife, and she commands the household, myself included.  There was a time--I reflect on it with melancholy pride and subdued satisfaction--when I commanded a British seventy-four.  I command nothing now but my temper.  That, however, is a stronghold from which nothing terrestrial can drive me.  My friends style me \"The Captain,\" but I am not the hero of this tale. No, by no means.  I am altogether unheroic in my nature, commonplace in my character.  If a novelist were to describe me, he would write me down a stout little old gentleman, with a bald head and a mild countenance; mentally weak in expression, active in habits, and addicted to pipes and loose clothing.  Do not imagine that this is my account of myself; no, it is an ideal resulting from the oft-repeated assurances of my wife, who is a strong-minded woman, a few inches taller than myself, somewhat raw-boned and much more powerful, physically, though less rotund.  In fact, if I were to attempt a brief comprehensive description of her, I would say, without the most distant feeling of disrespect of course, that she is square and skinny--singularly so!  Mrs Bingley's contempt for my intellect is excelled, I might almost say redeemed, by her love for myself.  How she manages to separate between myself and my intellect I have never been able to understand; but then she _is_ strong-minded, which perhaps accounts for her seeing farther into this millstone than I can.  She tells me, not unfrequently, that I am weak-minded.  She even goes the length at times of calling me imbecile; but she is a dear good affectionate woman, and I have no sympathy with the insolent remark I once overheard made by an acquaintance of mine, to the effect that it was a pity Mrs Bingley had not been born with a man's hat and trousers on--no, none whatever.  Before dismissing myself, descriptively at least, (for, being an honorary agent of the Shipwrecked Fishermen and Mariners' Society, and an actor in some of the scenes which I am about to describe, I cannot conveniently dismiss myself altogether); before dismissing myself, I say, it may be as well to explain that my strong-minded wife, in concert with a number of variously-minded women, (all more or less strong), and a good many weak and otherwise minded men, have come to form their opinion of me in consequence of my holding rather strongly a few opinions of my own--to the effect that there are a good many wrong things in this world, (admittedly wrong things); a good many muddles; a good many glaring and outrageous abuses and shameful things the continuance of which reflects discredit on the nation, and the wiping out or putting right of which ought, by all means, to be set about earnestly and at once.  Now, curiously enough, it is the idea conveyed in the last two words--at once--which sticks in the throats of my strong-minded opponents!  They agree with me as to the existence of the evils, they honestly deplore them,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21702"],["title","Shifting Winds: A Tough Yarn (#1)"],["body","they charge me with mental imbecility when I suggest that things should be put right _at once_.  They counsel delay, and when the dispute reaches a certain stage they smile at me with contempt, or pity, or they storm, according to individual temperament, and usually wind up with a rasping reiteration of their original opinions, highly peppered and salted, and an assurance that I have been born at least a century before my time.  If the men of the next century are destined to do good, \"as their hands find opportunity,\" without previous delay until thousands of opportunities are lost and gone for ever; if those who put their hands to a piece of work shall carry it out with vigour in their _own_ lifetime; if those who counsel delay shall mean due time for full consideration by _themselves_, and shall _not_ mean an extended procrastination which shall free themselves from worry, and leave their work to be handed down as a legacy to their children, who shall likewise hand it down to _their_ children, and so on _ad infinitum_ until \"delay\" shall become a synonym for death and destruction to tens of thousands of better men than themselves,--if this shall be the sentiment and practice of the men of next century, then I confess that my sympathies are with them, and I really suspect that I must have got into the wrong century by mistake.  But as the position is irremediable now, I suppose I must, in an imbecile sort of fashion, go on my way rejoicing--if I can-- sorrowing if I cannot rejoice.  Mrs Bingley having more than once threatened to scratch my face when I have ventured to express the last sentiment, it may be perhaps as well to change the subject and return to Billy Gaff, the charming child, _alias_ the Bu'ster.  Billy deserves to be somewhat particularly introduced, because, besides being an actor in this tale, he was a boy of strong character.  If I were to sum him up and reduce the total to a concentrated essence, the result would be a sentence to the following effect:--Billy Gaff had a will of his own!  Perhaps I should say a very strong will of his own. For instance, he, on several different occasions, willed to screw off the spout of the family tea-pot, a pewter one, and, having willed to do it, he did it.  Again he willed, more than once, to smash a pane of glass in the solitary window of the family mansion, and he _did_ smash a pane of glass in that window; nay, more, in consequence of being heartily whacked for the deed, he immediately willed to smash, _and_ smashed, a second pane, and was proceeding to will and smash a third when he was caught up by his mother, beaten almost into the condition of a mummy, and thrust under the clothes of the family bed, which immediately creaked as if with convulsions, and tossed its blankets about in apparent agony.  On the present occasion the Bu'ster had awakened out of a sound sleep to the conviction that he was hungry.  Observing the loaf on the table, he immediately willed to have a second supper, and arising, donned his father's pea-jacket, in order to enjoy the meal more thoroughly.  It was the sudden removal of the said loaf by his mother to an unreachable shelf that induced the youthful Billy to stand in the middle of the room and howl, as already described.  He was still engaged in emulating the storm, and Mrs Gaff, utterly indifferent to him, had cast another glance at the horrified clock, and remarked to her little girl Tottie, that \"Uncle John must have found work on the shore, for he was long of coming,\" when a heavy tread was heard in the little porch outside the door.  \"Hold yer noise,\" said Mrs Gaff sternly.  Billy obeyed, not by any means in consequence of the command, but because he was curious to know who was about to enter, and meant to resume yelling immediately after his curiosity on this point should be satisfied.  The door opened, and a strong-built seaman stepped into the room, and looked at the family with a quiet smile on his sunburnt face.  His hair and garments were dripping with water, as if he had just walked out of the sea.  On beholding him the family rose and stood for a moment speechless. Billy sat down on the floor in that prompt manner which is peculiar to young children when they lose their balance; simultaneously with the shock of being seated the word \"faither\" burst from his lips.  Mrs Gaff uttered a suppressed cry, and ran into the wet man's arms.  Tottie and the Bu'ster each ran at a leg, and hugging it violently, squeezed a cataract of salt water into their respective bosoms.  \"Stephen, lad, is't you?\" said the wife, raising her head for a moment and looking up in the man's face.  \"Ay, dear lass, wrecked again; but safe home, thank God.\"  Mrs Gaff was not wont to give way to the melting mood, but she could not restrain a few tears of joy.  Tottie, observing this, cried from sympathy; and the Bu'ster, not to be outdone, willed, began, and carried into execution, a series of true British cheers, that could not have been surpassed, perhaps could not have been equalled, by any boy of his age in or out of the Royal Navy.    CHAPTER TWO.  WRECKED, RESCUED, AND RESUSCITATED--MRS. NIVEN RECEIVES A SURPRISE, ALSO THE GIFT OF A CHILD.  On the same dark tempestuous night of which I write, a little ship was wrecked on the east coast of England.  She had sailed from the antipodes, had weathered many a gale, had crossed the great ocean in safety, had sighted the lights and the cliffs of \"home,\" and was dashed to pieces at last on the rocks within two hours' sail of the port to which she was bound.  Hundreds of ships, great and small, were wrecked on the coasts of Britain during that memorable gale.  The little ship to which I refer was one of the many in regard to which the newspapers said, \"she was dashed to pieces, and all hands perished.\"  But in this particular case all hands had not perished: two lives had been spared, unknown to journalists and coastguardsmen.  It was the dead of night when the vessel struck.  The spot was lonely, at least a mile distant from human habitations.  No anxious eyes on shore saw her quiver as each successive billow lifted her up and hurled her cruelly down; no sorrowing ear heard the shriek of despair that rose above the yelling storm, when, in little more than ten minutes, the vessel broke up, and left the crew and passengers to perish within sight of their native land.  There was one man among the number who did not shriek, who did not despair.  He was not a hero of romance whose soul raised him above the fear of sudden death--no, he was only a true-hearted British tar, whose frame was very strong, whose nerves were tightly strung and used to danger.  He had made up his mind to save his life if he could; if he should fail--what then?  He never thought of \"what then,\" because, in regard to terrestrial matters, he had not been accustomed to cast his thoughts so far in advance of present exigencies.  Just before the ship broke up, this man was standing on the lee bulwark, holding by the shrouds of the mainmast, the lower part of which was still standing.  A lady and gentleman clung to each other, and to the rigging close beside him.  They were husband and wife.  Both were comparatively young, and up to that night had been full of hope and high spirits.  The husband with his right arm encircled his wife, and grasped the rigging; with his left, he pressed their little girl to his breast over which flowed the fair hair of the little one, drenched and dishevelled.  The father was a brave man and strong, but his face was very pale, for he felt that courage and strength could not avail to save both wife and child in such a raging sea.  An occasional upward glance of his eye seemed to indicate that he sought comfort from God in his extremity.  \"You'll never manage 'em both, sir; let me have the child,\" said the strong seaman, suddenly grasping the little girl, and attempting to unlock her arms which were tightly clasped round her father's neck.  The father hesitated, but a terrific wave was rushing towards the doomed ship.  Without even the comfort of a hurried kiss he resigned the child. The young mother stretched out her arms towards her, uttering a piteous cry.  At that moment the ship rose on the billow's crest as if it were no heavier than a flake of the driving foam--a crash followed--it was gone, and the crew were left struggling in the sea.  The struggle was short with most of them.  Previous exposure and anxiety had already quite exhausted all but the strongest among the men, and even these were unable to withstand the influence of the ice-cold water more than a few seconds.  Some were struck by portions of the wreck and killed at once.  Others sank without an effort to save themselves.  A few swam with unnatural vigour for a yard or two, and then went down with a gurgling cry; but in a very few minutes the work of death was complete.  All were gone except the strong seaman, who clasped the little child in his left arm and buffeted the billows with his right.  Once and again were they overwhelmed; but as often did they rise above the foam to continue the battle.  It was a terrible fight.  A piece of wreck struck the man on his back and well-nigh broke it; then a wave arched high above them, fell with a crash, and drove them nearly to the bottom, so that the child was rendered insensible, and the strong man was nearly choked before he rose again to the surface to gasp the precious air.  At last a wave broke behind them, caught them on its crest, and hurled them on a beach of sand.  To cling to this while the water retired was the fiercest part of the conflict--the turning-point in the battle.  The wave swept back and left the man on his hands and knees.  He rose and staggered forward a few paces ere the next wave rushed upon him, compelling him to fall again on hands and knees and drive his bleeding fingers deep down into the shingle.  When the water once more retired, he rose and stumbled on till"]]]
