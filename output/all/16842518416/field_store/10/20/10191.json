Edith was by no means a beautiful child, but miserable indeed must have been the taste of him who would have pronounced her plain-looking.  Her features were not regular; her nose had a strong tendency to what is called snubbed, and her mouth was large; but to counterbalance these defects she had a pair of large, deep-blue eyes, soft, golden hair, a fair, rosy complexion, and an expression of sweetness at the corners of her mouth that betrayed habitual good-nature.  She was quick in all her movements, combined with a peculiar softness and grace of deportment that was exceedingly attractive.  \"Would you like to go, my pet,\" said her father, \"to a country far, far away in the north, where there are high mountains and deep valleys, inhabited by beautiful reindeer, and large lakes and rivers filled with fish; where there is very little daylight all the long winter, and where there is scarcely any night all the long, bright summer?  Would my Eda like to go there?\"  The child possessed that fascinating quality of being intensely interested in all that was said to her.  As her father spoke, her eyes gradually expanded and looked straight into his, while her head turned slowly and very slightly to one side.  As he concluded, she replied, \"Oh! very, very, _very_ much indeed,\" with a degree of energy that made both her parents laugh.  \"Ah, my darling! would that my lazy men were endued with some of your spirit,\" said Stanley, patting the child's head.  \"Is Prince a lazy man, papa?\" inquired Edith anxiously.  \"No, certainly, Prince is not.  Why do you ask?\"  \"Because I love Prince.\"  \"And do you not love all the men?\"  \"No,\" replied Edith, with some hesitation; \"at least I don't love them _very_ much, and I hate one.\"  \"Hate one!\" echoed Mrs Stanley.  \"Come here, my darling.\"  Eda slipped from her father's knee and went to her mother, feeling and looking as if she had said something wrong.  Mrs Stanley was not one of those mothers who, whenever they hear of their children having done anything wrong, assume a look of intense, solemnised horror, that would lead an ignorant spectator to suppose that intelligence had just been received of some sudden and appalling catastrophe.  She knew that children could not be deceived by such pieces of acting.  She expressed on her countenance precisely what she felt--a slight degree of sorrow that her child should cherish an evil passion, which, she knew, existed in her heart in common with all the human race, but which she expected, by God's help and blessing, to subdue effectually at last.  Kissing Eda's forehead she said kindly,--\"Which of them do you hate, darling?\"  \"Gaspard,\" replied the child.  \"And why do you hate him?\"  \"Because he struck my dog,\" said Eda, while her face flushed and her eyes sparkled; \"and he is always rude to everybody, and very, _very_ cruel to the dogs.\"  \"That is very wrong of Gaspard; but, dearest Eda, do you not remember what is written in God's Word,--`Love your enemies?'  It is wrong to _hate_ anybody.\"  \"I know that, mamma, and I don't wish to hate Gaspard, but I can't help it.  I wish if I didn't hate him, but it _won't_ go away.\"  \"Well, my pet,\" replied Mrs Stanley, pressing the child to her bosom, \"but you must pray for him, and speak kindly to him when you meet him, and that will perhaps put it away.  And now let us talk of the far-off country that papa was speaking about.  I wonder what he has to tell you about it.\"  Stanley had been gazing out of the window during the foregoing colloquy, apparently inattentive, though, in reality, deeply interested in what was said.  Turning round, he said--  \"I was going to tell Eda that you had arranged to follow me to that country next year, and that perhaps you would bring her along with you.\"  \"Nay, George, you mistake.  I did not arrange to do so--you only proposed the arrangement; but, to say truth, I don't like it, and I can't make up my mind to let you go without us.  I cannot wait till next year.\"  \"Well, well, Jessie, I have exhausted all my powers of persuasion.  I leave it entirely to yourself to do as you think best.\"  At this moment the sound of deep voices was heard in the hall, which was separated from Stanley's quarters by a thin partition of wood.  In a few seconds the door opened, and George Barney, the Irish butler and general factotum to the establishment, announced that the \"min wos in the hall awaitin'.\"  Giving Eda a parting kiss, Stanley rose and entered the hall, where Francois, Massan, Gaspard, and several others were grouped in a corner. On their bourgeois entering, they doffed their bonnets and bowed.  \"Well, lads,\" began Stanley, with a smile, \"you've thought better of it, I hope, and have come to volunteer for this expedition--\" He checked himself and frowned, for he saw by their looks that they had come with quite a different intention.  \"What have you to say to me?\" he continued abruptly.  The men looked uneasily at each other, and then fixed their eyes on Francois, who was evidently expected to be spokesman.  \"Come, Francois, speak out,\" said Stanley; \"if you have any objections, out with them; you're free to say what you please here.\"  As he spoke, and ere Francois could reply, Frank Morton entered the room.  \"Ah!\" he exclaimed, as he deposited his rifle in a corner and flung his cap on the table, \"in time, I see, to help at the council!\"  \"I was just asking Francois to state his objections to going,\" said Stanley, as his young friend took his place beside him.  \"Objections!\" repeated Frank; \"what objections can bold spirits have to go on a bold adventure?  The question should have been, `Who will be first to volunteer?'\"  At this moment the door of Stanley's apartment opened, and his wife appeared leading Eda by the hand.  \"Here are two volunteers,\" she said, with a smile; \"pray put us at the head of your list.  We will go with you to any part of the world!\"  \"Bravo!\" shouted Frank, catching up Eda, with whom he was a great favourite, and hugging her tightly in his arms.  \"Nay, but, wife, this is sheer folly.  You know not the dangers that await you--\"  \"Perhaps not,\" interrupted Mrs Stanley; \"but _you_ know them, and that is enough for me.\"  \"Indeed, Jessie, I know them not.  I can but guess at them.--But, ah! well, 'tis useless to argue further.  Be it so; we shall head the list with you and Eda.\"  \"And put my name next,\" said a deep-toned voice from behind the other men.  All turned round in surprise.  \"Dick Prince!\" they exclaimed; \"you here?\"  \"Ay, lads,\" said a tall man of about forty, who was not so remarkable for physical development (though in this respect he was by no means deficient) as for a certain decision of character that betrayed itself in every outline of his masculine, intelligent countenance--\"ay, lads, I'm here; an' sorry am I that I've jist comed in time to hear that you're sich poor-spirited rascals as to hang back when ye should jump for'ard.\"  \"But how came you so opportunely, Prince?\" inquired Stanley.  \"I met an Injin, sir, as told me you was goin' off; so I thought you might want me, and comed straight back.  And now, sir, I'm ready to go; and so is Francois,\" he continued, turning to that individual, who seized his hand and exclaimed, \"That am I, my boy--to the moon if ye like!\"  \"And Massan, too,\" continued Prince.  \"All right; book me for Nova Zembla,\" replied that worthy.  \"So, so,\" cried Mr Stanley, with a satisfied smile.  \"I see, lads, that we're all of one mind now.  Is it not so?  Are we agreed?\"  \"Agreed! agreed!\" they replied with one voice.  \"That's well,\" he continued.  \"Now then, lads, clear out and get your kits ready.--And ho!  Barney, give these men a glass of grog.--Prince, I shall want to talk with you this evening.  Come to me an hour hence.-- And now,\" he added, taking Eda by the hand, \"come along, my gentle volunteers; let's go to supper.\"    CHAPTER FOUR.  EXPLANATORY, BUT NOT DRY!--MURDEROUS DESIGNS THWARTED BY VIGOROUS TREATMENT--THE CATTLE PAY FOR IT!--PREPARATIONS FOR A LONG, LONG VOYAGE.  In order to render our story intelligible, it is necessary here to say a few words explanatory of the nature and object of the expedition referred to in the foregoing chapters.  Many years previous to the opening of our tale, it was deemed expedient, by the rulers of the Hudson's Bay Fur Company, to effect, if possible, a reconciliation or treaty of peace between the Muskigon Indians of James's Bay and the Esquimaux of Hudson's Straits.  The Muskigons are by no means a warlike race; on the contrary, they are naturally timid, and only plucked up courage to make war on their northern neighbours in consequence of these poor people being destitute of firearms, while themselves were supplied with guns and ammunition by the fur-traders. The Esquimaux, however, are much superior to the Muskigon Indians physically, and would have held their adversaries in light esteem had they met on equal terms, or, indeed, on any terms at all; but the evil was that they never met.  The Indians always took them by surprise, and from behind the rocks and bushes sent destruction into their camps with the deadly bullet; while their helpless foes could only reply with the comparatively harmless arrow and spear.  Thus the war was in fact an annual raid of murderers.  The conceited Muskigons returned to their wigwams in triumph, with bloody scalps hanging at their belts; while the Esquimaux pushed farther into their ice-bound fastnesses, and told their comrades, with lowering brows and heaving bosoms, of the sudden attack, and of the wives and children who had been butchered in cold blood, or led captive to the tents of the cowardly red men.  At such times those untutored inhabitants of the frozen regions vowed vengeance on the Indians, and cursed in their hearts the white men who supplied them"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21707"],["title","Ungava (#4)"],["body","the deadly gun.  But the curse was unmerited.  In the councils of the fur-traders the subject of Esquimau wrongs had been mooted, and plans for the amelioration of their condition devised. Trading posts were established on Richmond Gulf and Little Whale River; but owing to circumstances which it is unnecessary to detail here, they turned out failures, and were at length abandoned.  Still, those in charge of the districts around Hudson's Bay and Labrador continued to use every argument to prevail on the Indians to cease their murderous assaults on their unoffending neighbours, but without much effect.  At length the governor of East Main--a territory lying on the eastern shores of James's Bay--adopted an argument which proved eminently successful, at least for one season.  His fort was visited by a large band of Muskigons from Albany and Moose districts, who brought a quantity of valuable furs, for which they demanded guns and ammunition, making no secret of their intention to proceed on an expedition against their enemies the Esquimaux.  On hearing of this, the governor went out to them, and, in a voice of extreme indignation, assured them that they should not have an ounce of supplies for such a purpose.  \"But we will pay you for what we ask.  We are not beggars!\" exclaimed the astonished Indians, into whose calculations it had never entered that white traders would refuse good furs merely in order to prevent the death of a few Esquimaux.  \"See,\" cried the angry governor, snatching up the nearest bale of furs--\"see, that's all I care for you or your payment!\" and hurling the pack at its owner's head, he felled him therewith to the ground.  \"No,\" he continued, shaking his fist at them, \"I'll not give you as much powder or shot as would blow off the tail of a rabbit, if you were to bring me all the skins in Labrador!\"  The consequence of this vigorous conduct was that the Indians retired crestfallen--utterly discomfited.  But in the camp that night they plotted revenge.  In the darkness of the night they slaughtered all the cattle around the establishment, and before daybreak were over the hills and far away in the direction of their hunting-grounds, loaded with fresh beef sufficient for the supply of themselves and their families for the winter!  It was a heavy price to pay; but the poor Esquimaux remained unmolested that year, while the Indians received a salutary lesson.  But the compulsory peace was soon broken, and it became apparent that the only effectual way to check the bloodthirsty propensity of the Indians was to arm their enemies with the gun.  The destruction of the first expedition to the Esquimaux, and the bad feeling that existed in the minds of the natives of Richmond Gulf consequent thereon, induced the fur-traders to fix on another locality for a new attempt.  It was thought that the remote solitudes of Ungava Bay, at the extreme north of Labrador,--where the white man's axe had never yet felled the stunted pines of the north, nor the ring of his rifle disturbed its echoes,--would be the spot best suited for the erection of a wooden fort.  Accordingly, it was appointed that Mr George Stanley should select a coadjutor, and proceed with a party of picked men to the scene of action as early in the spring as the ice would permit, and there build a fort as he best could, with the best materials he could find; live on whatever the country afforded in the shape of food; establish a trade in oil, whalebone, arctic foxes, etcetera, etcetera, if they were to be got; and bring about a reconciliation between the Esquimaux and the Indians of the interior, if that were possible.  With the careful minuteness peculiar to documents, Stanley's instructions went on to point out that he was to start from Moose--with two half-sized canoes, each capable of carrying ten _pieces_ or packages of 90 pounds weight each, besides the crew--and _bore_ through the ice, if the ice would allow him, till he should reach Richmond Gulf; cross this gulf, and ascend, if practicable, some of the rivers which fall into it from the height of land supposed, but not positively known, to exist somewhere in the interior.  Passing this height, he was to descend by the rivers and lakes (if such existed) leading to the eastward, until he should fall upon a river reported to exist in these lands, and called by the natives _Caniapuscaw_, or South River, down which he was to proceed to the scene of his labours, Ungava Bay; on reaching which he was considerately left to the unaided guidance of his own discretion!  Reduced to their lowest term and widest signification, the instructions directed our friend to start as early as he could, with whom he chose, and with what he liked; travel as fast as possible over _terra incognita_ to a land of ice-- perhaps, also, of desolation--and locate himself among bloody savages. It was hoped that there would be found a sufficiency of trees wherewith to build him a shelter against a prolonged winter; in the meantime he might enjoy a bright arctic summer sky for his canopy!  But it was known, or at least supposed, that the Esquimaux were fierce and cruel savages, if not cannibals.  Their very name implies something of the sort.  It signifies _eaters of raw flesh_, and was bestowed on them by their enemies the Muskigons.  They call themselves _Innuit_-men, or warriors; and although they certainly do eat raw flesh when necessity compels them--which it often does--they asserted that they never did so from choice.  However, be this as it may, the remembrance of their misdeeds in the first expeditions was fresh in the minds of the men in the service of the fur-traders, and they evinced a decided unwillingness to venture into such a country and among such a people,--an unwillingness which was only at length overcome when Mrs Stanley and her little daughter heroically volunteered to share the dangers of the expedition in the manner already narrated.  Stanley now made vigorous preparations for his departure.  Some of the men had already been enrolled, as we have seen, and there were more than enough of able and active volunteers ready to complete the crews.  \"Come hither, lads,\" he cried, beckoning to two men who were occupied on the bank of the river, near the entrance to Moose Fort, in repairing the side of a canoe.  The men left their work and approached.  They were both Esquimaux, and good stout, broad-shouldered, thick-set specimens of the race they were. One was called Oolibuck, [_This name is spelt as it should be pronounced.  The correct spelling is Ouligbuck_], the other Augustus; both of which names are now chronicled in the history of arctic adventure as having belonged to the well-tried and faithful interpreters to Franklin, Back, and Richardson, in their expeditions of north-west discovery.  \"I'm glad to see you busy at the canoe, boys,\" said Stanley, as they came up.  \"Of course you are both willing to revisit your countrymen.\"  \"Yes, sir, we is.  Glad to go where you choose send us,\" answered Oolibuck, whose broad, oily countenance lighted up with good-humour as he spoke.  \"It will remind you of your trip with Captain Franklin,\" continued Stanley, addressing Augustus.  \"Me no like to 'member dat,\" said the Esquimau, with a sorrowful shake of the head.  \"Me love bourgeois Franklin, but tink me never see him more.\"  \"I don't know that, old fellow,\" returned Stanley, with a smile. \"Franklin is not done with his discoveries yet; there's a talk of sending off another expedition some of these days, I hear, so you may have a chance yet.\"  Augustus's black eyes sparkled with pleasure as he heard this.  He was a man of strong feeling, and during his journeyings with our great arctic hero had become attached to him in consequence of the hearty and unvarying kindness and consideration with which he treated all under his command.  But the spirit of enterprise had been long slumbering, and poor Augustus, who was now past the prime of life, feared that he should never see his kind master more.  \"Now I want you, lads, to get everything in readiness for an immediate start,\" continued Stanley, glancing upwards at the sky; \"if the weather holds, we shan't be long off paying your friends a visit.  Are both canoes repaired?\"  \"Yes, sir, they is,\" replied Oolibuck.  \"And the baggage, is it laid out?  And--\"  \"Pardon, monsieur,\" interrupted Massan, walking up, and touching his cap.  \"I've jest been down at the point, and there's a rig'lar nor'-wester a-comin' down.  The ice is sweepin' into the river, an' it'll be choked up by to-morrow, I'm afraid.\"  Stanley received this piece of intelligence with a slight frown, and looked seaward, where a dark line on the horizon and large fields of ice showed that the man's surmise was likely to prove correct.  \"It matters not,\" said Stanley, hastily; \"I've made arrangements to start to-morrow, and start we shall, in spite of ice or wind, if the canoes will float!\"  Massan, who had been constituted principal steersman of the expedition, in virtue of his well-tried skill and indomitable energy, felt that the tone in which this was said implied a want of confidence in his willingness to go under _any_ circumstances, so he said gravely--  \"Pardon, monsieur; I did not say we could not start.\"  \"True, true, Massan; don't be hurt.  I was only grumbling at the weather,\" answered Stanley, with a laugh.  Just then the first puff of the coming breeze swept up the river, ruffling its hitherto glassy surface.  \"There it comes,\" cried Stanley, as he quitted the spot.  \"Now, Massan, see to it that the crews are assembled in good time on the beach to-morrow.  We start at daybreak.\"  \"Oui, monsieur,\" replied Massan, as he turned on his heel and walked away.  \"Parbleu! we shall indeed start to morrow, an it please you, if all the ice and wind in the polar regions was blowed down the coast and crammed into the river's mouth.  C'est vrai!\"    CHAPTER FIVE.  ICE LOOKS UNPROPITIOUS--THE START--AN"]]]
