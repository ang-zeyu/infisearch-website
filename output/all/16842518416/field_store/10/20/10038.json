Here Emma Goldman found friends ready to aid her.  Justus Schwab, one of the finest representatives of the German revolutionary period of that time, and Dr. Solotaroff were indefatigable in the care of the patient.  Here, too, she met Edward Brady, the new friendship subsequently ripening into close intimacy.  Brady had been an active participant in the revolutionary movement of Austria and had, at the time of his acquaintance with Emma Goldman, lately been released from an Austrian prison after an incarceration of ten years.  Physicians diagnosed the illness as consumption, and the patient was advised to leave New York.  She went to Rochester, in the hope that the home circle would help restore her to health.  Her parents had several years previously emigrated to America, settling in that city. Among the leading traits of the Jewish race is the strong attachment between the members of the family, and, especially, between parents and children.  Though her conservative parents could not sympathize with the idealist aspirations of Emma Goldman and did not approve of her mode of life, they now received their sick daughter with open arms.  The rest and care enjoyed in the parental home, and the cheering presence of the beloved sister Helene, proved so beneficial that within a short time she was sufficiently restored to resume her energetic activity.  There is no rest in the life of Emma Goldman.  Ceaseless effort and continuous striving toward the conceived goal are the essentials of her nature.  Too much precious time had already been wasted.  It was imperative to resume her labors immediately.  The country was in the throes of a crisis, and thousands of unemployed crowded the streets of the large industrial centers.  Cold and hungry they tramped through the land in the vain search for work and bread.  The Anarchists developed a strenuous propaganda among the unemployed and the strikers.  A monster demonstration of striking cloakmakers and of the unemployed took place at Union Square, New York.  Emma Goldman was one of the invited speakers.  She delivered an impassioned speech, picturing in fiery words the misery of the wage slave's life, and quoted the famous maxim of Cardinal Manning: \"Necessity knows no law, and the starving man has a natural right to a share of his neighbor's bread.\"  She concluded her exhortation with the words: \"Ask for work.  If they do not give you work, ask for bread.  If they do not give you work or bread, then take bread.\"  The following day she left for Philadelphia, where she was to address a public meeting.  The capitalist press again raised the alarm.  If Socialists and Anarchists were to be permitted to continue agitating, there was imminent danger that the workingmen would soon learn to understand the manner in which they are robbed of the joy and happiness of life.  Such a possibility was to be prevented at all cost.  The Chief of Police of New York, Byrnes, procured a court order for the arrest of Emma Goldman.  She was detained by the Philadelphia authorities and incarcerated for several days in the Moyamensing prison, awaiting the extradition papers which Byrnes intrusted to Detective Jacobs.  This man Jacobs (whom Emma Goldman again met several years later under very unpleasant circumstances) proposed to her, while she was returning a prisoner to New York, to betray the cause of labor.  In the name of his superior, Chief Byrnes, he offered lucrative reward.  How stupid men sometimes are! What poverty of psychologic observation to imagine the possibility of betrayal on the part of a young Russian idealist, who had willingly sacrificed all personal considerations to help in labor's emancipation.  In October, 1893, Emma Goldman was tried in the criminal courts of New York on the charge of inciting to riot.  The \"intelligent\" jury ignored the testimony of the twelve witnesses for the defense in favor of the evidence given by one single man--Detective Jacobs.  She was found guilty and sentenced to serve one year in the penitentiary at Blackwell's Island.  Since the foundation of the Republic she was the first woman--Mrs. Surratt excepted--to be imprisoned for a political offense.  Respectable society had long before stamped upon her the Scarlet Letter.  Emma Goldman passed her time in the penitentiary in the capacity of nurse in the prison hospital.  Here she found opportunity to shed some rays of kindness into the dark lives of the unfortunates whose sisters of the street did not disdain two years previously to share with her the same house.  She also found in prison opportunity to study English and its literature, and to familiarize herself with the great American writers.  In Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Thoreau, and Emerson she found great treasures.  She left Blackwell's Island in the month of August, 1894, a woman of twenty-five, developed and matured, and intellectually transformed. Back into the arena, richer in experience, purified by suffering. She did not feel herself deserted and alone any more.  Many hands were stretched out to welcome her.  There were at the time numerous intellectual oases in New York.  The saloon of Justus Schwab, at Number Fifty, First Street, was the center where gathered Anarchists, litterateurs, and bohemians.  Among others she also met at this time a number of American Anarchists, and formed the friendship of Voltairine de Cleyre, Wm. C. Owen, Miss Van Etton, and Dyer D. Lum, former editor of the ALARM and executor of the last wishes of the Chicago martyrs.  In John Swinton, the noble old fighter for liberty, she found one of her staunchest friends.  Other intellectual centers there were: SOLIDARITY, published by John Edelman; LIBERTY, by the Individualist Anarchist, Benjamin R. Tucker; the REBEL, by Harry Kelly; DER STURMVOGEL, a German Anarchist publication, edited by Claus Timmermann; DER ARME TEUFEL, whose presiding genius was the inimitable Robert Reitzel.  Through Arthur Brisbane, now chief lieutenant of William Randolph Hearst, she became acquainted with the writings of Fourier.  Brisbane then was not yet submerged in the swamp of political corruption.  He sent Emma Goldman an amiable letter to Blackwell's Island, together with the biography of his father, the enthusiastic American disciple of Fourier.  Emma Goldman became, upon her release from the penitentiary, a factor in the public life of New York.  She was appreciated in radical ranks for her devotion, her idealism, and earnestness.  Various persons sought her friendship, and some tried to persuade her to aid in the furtherance of their special side issues.  Thus Rev. Parkhurst, during the Lexow investigation, did his utmost to induce her to join the Vigilance Committee in order to fight Tammany Hall.  Maria Louise, the moving spirit of a social center, acted as Parkhurst's go-between.  It is hardly necessary to mention what reply the latter received from Emma Goldman.  Incidentally, Maria Louise subsequently became a Mahatma.  During the free silver campaign, ex-Burgess McLuckie, one of the most genuine personalities in the Homestead strike, visited New York in an endeavor to enthuse the local radicals for free silver.  He also attempted to interest Emma Goldman, but with no greater success than Mahatma Maria Louise of Parkhurst-Lexow fame.   In 1894 the struggle of the Anarchists in France reached its highest expression.  The white terror on the part of the Republican upstarts was answered by the red terror of our French comrades.  With feverish anxiety the Anarchists throughout the world followed this social struggle.  Propaganda by deed found its reverberating echo in almost all countries.  In order to better familiarize herself with conditions in the old world, Emma Goldman left for Europe, in the year 1895.  After a lecture tour in England and Scotland, she went to Vienna where she entered the ALLGEMEINE KRANKENHAUS to prepare herself as midwife and nurse, and where at the same time she studied social conditions.  She also found opportunity to acquaint herself with the newest literature of Europe: Hauptmann, Nietzsche, Ibsen, Zola, Thomas Hardy, and other artist rebels were read with great enthusiasm.  In the autumn of 1896 she returned to New York by way of Zurich and Paris.  The project of Alexander Berkman's liberation was on hand. The barbaric sentence of twenty-two years had roused tremendous indignation among the radical elements.  It was known that the Pardon Board of Pennsylvania would look to Carnegie and Frick for advice in the case of Alexander Berkman.  It was therefore suggested that these Sultans of Pennsylvania be approached--not with a view of obtaining their grace, but with the request that they do not attempt to influence the Board.  Ernest Crosby offered to see Carnegie, on condition that Alexander Berkman repudiate his act.  That, however, was absolutely out of the question.  He would never be guilty of such forswearing of his own personality and self-respect.  These efforts led to friendly relations between Emma Goldman and the circle of Ernest Crosby, Bolton Hall, and Leonard Abbott.  In the year 1897 she undertook her first great lecture tour, which extended as far as California.  This tour popularized her name as the representative of the oppressed, her eloquence ringing from coast to coast.  In California Emma Goldman became friendly with the members of the Isaak family, and learned to appreciate their efforts for the Cause.  Under tremendous obstacles the Isaaks first published the FIREBRAND and, upon its suppression by the Postal Department, the FREE SOCIETY.  It was also during this tour that Emma Goldman met that grand old rebel of sexual freedom, Moses Harman.  During the Spanish-American war the spirit of chauvinism was at its highest tide.  To check this dangerous situation, and at the same time collect"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],["title","Anarchism and Other Essays (#4)"],["body","for the revolutionary Cubans, Emma Goldman became affiliated with the Latin comrades, among others with Gori, Esteve, Palaviccini, Merlino, Petruccini, and Ferrara.  In the year 1899 followed another protracted tour of agitation, terminating on the Pacific Coast.  Repeated arrests and accusations, though without ultimate bad results, marked every propaganda tour.  In November of the same year the untiring agitator went on a second lecture tour to England and Scotland, closing her journey with the first International Anarchist Congress at Paris.  It was at the time of the Boer war, and again jingoism was at its height, as two years previously it had celebrated its orgies during the Spanish-American war.  Various meetings, both in England and Scotland, were disturbed and broken up by patriotic mobs.  Emma Goldman found on this occasion the opportunity of again meeting various English comrades and interesting personalities like Tom Mann and the sisters Rossetti, the gifted daughters of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, then publishers of the Anarchist review, the TORCH.  One of her life-long hopes found here its fulfillment: she came in close and friendly touch with Peter Kropotkin, Enrico Malatesta, Nicholas Tchaikovsky, W. Tcherkessov, and Louise Michel.  Old warriors in the cause of humanity, whose deeds have enthused thousands of followers throughout the world, and whose life and work have inspired other thousands with noble idealism and self-sacrifice.  Old warriors they, yet ever young with the courage of earlier days, unbroken in spirit and filled with the firm hope of the final triumph of Anarchy.  The chasm in the revolutionary labor movement, which resulted from the disruption of the INTERNATIONALE, could not be bridged any more. Two social philosophies were engaged in bitter combat.  The International Congress in 1889, at Paris; in 1892, at Zurich, and in 1896, at London, produced irreconcilable differences.  The majority of Social Democrats, forswearing their libertarian past and becoming politicians, succeeded in excluding the revolutionary and Anarchist delegates.  The latter decided thenceforth to hold separate congresses.  Their first congress was to take place in 1900, at Paris.  The Socialist renegade, Millerand, who had climbed into the Ministry of the Interior, here played a Judas role.  The congress of the revolutionists was suppressed, and the delegates dispersed two days prior to their scheduled opening.  But Millerand had no objections against the Social Democratic Congress, which was afterwards opened with all the trumpets of the advertiser's art.  However, the renegade did not accomplish his object.  A number of delegates succeeded in holding a secret conference in the house of a comrade outside of Paris, where various points of theory and tactics were discussed.  Emma Goldman took considerable part in these proceedings, and on that occasion came in contact with numerous representatives of the Anarchist movement of Europe.  Owing to the suppression of the congress, the delegates were in danger of being expelled from France.  At this time also came the bad news from America regarding another unsuccessful attempt to liberate Alexander Berkman, proving a great shock to Emma Goldman.  In November, 1900, she returned to America to devote herself to her profession of nurse, at the same time taking an active part in the American propaganda.  Among other activities she organized monster meetings of protest against the terrible outrages of the Spanish government, perpetrated upon the political prisoners tortured in Montjuich.  In her vocation as nurse Emma Goldman enjoyed many opportunities of meeting the most unusual and peculiar characters.  Few would have identified the \"notorious Anarchist\" in the small blonde woman, simply attired in the uniform of a nurse.  Soon after her return from Europe she became acquainted with a patient by the name of Mrs. Stander, a morphine fiend, suffering excruciating agonies.  She required careful attention to enable her to supervise a very important business she conducted,--that of Mrs. Warren.  In Third Street, near Third Avenue, was situated her private residence, and near it, connected by a separate entrance, was her place of business. One evening, the nurse, upon entering the room of her patient, suddenly came face to face with a male visitor, bull-necked and of brutal appearance.  The man was no other than Mr. Jacobs, the detective who seven years previously had brought Emma Goldman a prisoner from Philadelphia and who had attempted to persuade her, on their way to New York, to betray the cause of the workingmen.  It would be difficult to describe the expression of bewilderment on the countenance of the man as he so unexpectedly faced Emma Goldman, the nurse of his mistress.  The brute was suddenly transformed into a gentleman, exerting himself to excuse his shameful behavior on the previous occasion.  Jacobs was the \"protector\" of Mrs. Stander, and go-between for the house and the police.  Several years later, as one of the detective staff of District Attorney Jerome, he committed perjury, was convicted, and sent to Sing Sing for a year.  He is now probably employed by some private detective agency, a desirable pillar of respectable society.  In 1901 Peter Kropotkin was invited by the Lowell Institute of Massachusetts to deliver a series of lectures on Russian literature. It was his second American tour, and naturally the comrades were anxious to use his presence for the benefit of the movement.  Emma Goldman entered into correspondence with Kropotkin and succeeded in securing his consent to arrange for him a series of lectures.  She also devoted her energies to organizing the tours of other well known Anarchists, principally those of Charles W. Mowbray and John Turner. Similarly she always took part in all the activities of the movement, ever ready to give her time, ability, and energy to the Cause.  On the sixth of September, 1901, President McKinley was shot by Leon Czolgosz at Buffalo.  Immediately an unprecedented campaign of persecution was set in motion against Emma Goldman as the best known Anarchist in the country.  Although there was absolutely no foundation for the accusation, she, together with other prominent Anarchists, was arrested in Chicago, kept in confinement for several weeks, and subjected to severest cross-examination.  Never before in the history of the country had such a terrible man-hunt taken place against a person in public life.  But the efforts of police and press to connect Emma Goldman with Czolgosz proved futile.  Yet the episode left her wounded to the heart.  The physical suffering, the humiliation and brutality at the hands of the police she could bear. The depression of soul was far worse.  She was overwhelmed by realization of the stupidity, lack of understanding, and vileness which characterized the events of those terrible days.  The attitude of misunderstanding on the part of the majority of her own comrades toward Czolgosz almost drove her to desperation.  Stirred to the very inmost of her soul, she published an article on Czolgosz in which she tried to explain the deed in its social and individual aspects.  As once before, after Berkman's act, she now also was unable to find quarters; like a veritable wild animal she was driven from place to place.  This terrible persecution and, especially, the attitude of her comrades made it impossible for her to continue propaganda.  The soreness of body and soul had first to heal.  During 1901-1903 she did not resume the platform.  As \"Miss Smith\" she lived a quiet life, practicing her profession and devoting her leisure to the study of literature and, particularly, to the modern drama, which she considers one of the greatest disseminators of radical ideas and enlightened feeling.  Yet one thing the persecution of Emma Goldman accomplished.  Her name was brought before the public with greater frequency and emphasis than ever before, the malicious harassing of the much maligned agitator arousing strong sympathy in many circles.  Persons in various walks of life began to get interested in her struggle and her ideas.  A better understanding and appreciation were now beginning to manifest themselves.  The arrival in America of the English Anarchist, John Turner, induced Emma Goldman to leave her retirement.  Again she threw herself into her public activities, organizing an energetic movement for the defense of Turner, whom the Immigration authorities condemned to deportation on account of the Anarchist exclusion law, passed after the death of McKinley.  When Paul Orleneff and Mme. Nazimova arrived in New York to acquaint the American public with Russian dramatic art, Emma Goldman became the manager of the undertaking.  By much patience and perseverance she succeeded in raising the necessary funds to introduce the Russian artists to the theater-goers of New York and Chicago.  Though financially not a success, the venture proved of great artistic value.  As manager of the Russian theater Emma Goldman enjoyed some unique experiences.  M. Orleneff could converse only in Russian, and \"Miss Smith\" was forced to act as his interpreter at various polite functions.  Most of the aristocratic ladies of Fifth Avenue had not the least inkling that the amiable manager who so entertainingly discussed philosophy, drama, and literature at their five o'clock teas, was the \"notorious\" Emma Goldman.  If the latter should some day write her autobiography, she will no doubt have many interesting anecdotes to relate in connection with these experiences.  The weekly Anarchist publication, FREE SOCIETY, issued by the Isaak family, was forced to suspend in consequence of the nation-wide fury that swept the country after the death of McKinley.  To fill out the gap Emma Goldman, in co-operation with Max Baginski and other comrades, decided to publish a monthly magazine devoted to the furtherance of Anarchist"]]]
