When, a year ago, we gathered   Joy was in his mild blue eye; But a golden cord is severed,   And our hopes in ruin lie.  CHORUS.  We shall meet, but we shall miss him;   There will be one vacant chair; We shall linger to caress him   When we breathe our evening prayer.  At our fireside, sad and lonely,   Often will the bosom swell At remembrance of the story   How our noble Willie fell; How he strove to bear our banner   Through the thickest of the fight, And upheld our country's honor   In the strength of manhood's might.--CHORUS.  True, they tell us wreaths of glory   Evermore will deck his brow; But this soothes the anguish only   Sweeping o'er our heart strings now. Sleep, today, O early fallen!   In thy green and narrow bed; Dirges from the pine and cypress   Mingle with the tears we shed.--CHORUS.  [Illustration: GEN. NATHAN KIMBALL.]     NEARER, MY GOD, TO THEE.  KEY OF G.   [Illustration: MAJ. GEN. E.O.C. ORD.]  Nearer, my God, to Thee,   Nearer to Thee! E'en though it be a cross   That raiseth me! Still all my song shall be, Nearer my God, to Thee,   Nearer to Thee!  Though, like a wanderer,   The sun gone down, Darkness be over me,   My rest a stone, Yet in my dreams I'd be Nearer, my God, to Thee,   Nearer to Thee!  There let the way appear   Steps unto heaven; All that Thou sendest me   In mercy given; Angels to beckon me Nearer, my God, to Thee,   Nearer to Thee!  Then, with my waking thoughts   Bright with Thy praise, Out of my stony griefs   Bethel I'll raise; So by my woes to be Nearer, my God, to Thee,   Nearer to Thee!  [Illustration: ADMIRAL DAVID D.

CARR.]  In the prison cell I sit, thinking, mother, dear, of you,   And our bright and happy home so far away, And the tears they fill my eyes, spite of all that I can do,   Tho' I try to cheer my comrades and be gay.  CHORUS.  Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching;   Cheer up, comrades, they will come, And beneath the starry flag   We shall breathe the air again Of the Free-land in our own beloved home.  [Illustration: FIRST CORPS.]  In the battle front we stood when the fiercest charge was made,   And they swept us off a hundred men or more; But before we reached their lines they were beaten back dismayed,   And we hear the cry of victory o'er and o'er.--CHORUS.  So within the prison cell we are waiting for the day   That shall come to open wide the iron door, And the hollow eye grows bright and the poor heart almost gay   As we think of seeing friends and home once more.--CHORUS.

The men will cheer, the boys will shout, The ladies they will all turn out, And we'll all feel gay   When Johnny comes marching home.  The old church bell will peal with joy,   Hurrah, hurrah! To welcome our darling boy,   Hurrah, hurrah! The village lads and lassies say With roses they will strew the way, And we'll all feel gay   When Johnny comes marching home.  Get ready for the Jubilee,   Hurrah, hurrah! We'll give the hero three times three,   Hurrah, hurrah! The laurel wreath is ready now To place upon his loyal brow, And we'll all feel gay   When Johnny comes marching home.  Let love and friendship on that day,   Hurrah, hurrah! Their choicest treasures then display,   Hurrah, hurrah! And let each one perform some part To fill with joy the warrior's heart, And we'll all feel gay   When Johnny comes marching home.

[Illustration: 11TH AND 12TH CORPS.]  I'se gwine back to Dixie,   I'se gwine no more to wander, My heart's turned back to Dixie,   I can't stay here no longer; I've left the old plantation,   My home and my relation, My heart's turned back to Dixie   And I must go.  CHORUS.  I'se gwine back to Dixie, I'se gwine back to Dixie,   I'se gwine where the orange blossoms grow, For I hear the children calling, I see their sad tears falling, Me heart's turned back to Dixie,   And I must go.  I've hoed in fields of cotton,   I've worked upon the river, I used to say if I got off   I'd go back there, no never; But time has changed the old man,   His head is bending low, His heart's turned back to Dixie,   And he must go.--CHORUS.  I'se traveling back to Dixie,   My step is slow and feeble, I pray the Lord to help me,   And keep me from all evil; And should my strength forsake me,   Then kind friends come and take me; My heart's turned back to Dixie,   And I must go.--CHORUS.

Sing after the words--\"But the greatest of these is Charity.\"   Meek and lowly, pure and holy,   Chief among the blessed three; Turning sadness into gladness,   Heaven-born art thou Charity. Pity dwelleth in thy bosom,   Kindness reigneth o'er thy heart; Gentle thoughts alone can sway thee,   Judgment with thee hath no part.  CHORUS.

CHORUS.  Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah!   We all go marching on.  Held by fraternity in bonds that are sure, Drawn close in charity by ties that are pure, Filled with a loyalty that ever shall endure,   We still go marching on.  CHORUS.--Glory, glory, hallelujah, etc.  Elbow to elbow we stood through the fight, Elbow to elbow we stand here tonight, Elbow to elbow till heaven is in sight,   We all go marching on.  CHORUS.--Glory, glory, hallelujah, etc.  [Illustration: EIGHTH CORPS.]     CLOSING ODE.  Air--\"AULD LANG SYNE.\"   Shall we forget those far-off days   Which made us comrades all? Shall we forget how swift the feet   That ran at duty's call? Shall we forget the honored dead   That sleep beneath the sod, Who gave their lives for liberty,   Our country, and our God?
