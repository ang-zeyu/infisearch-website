CHAPTER FIVE.  PLOTS AND COUNTER-PLOTS ALREADY.  It is not necessary, neither would it be profitable, to give in full detail what Ujarak said to the gaping crowd.  Enough to know that, like other statesmen, he made the most of his subject, and fully impressed his audience with the belief that this first of Kablunets who had ever visited these ice-bound regions had been mysteriously, yet irresistibly, drawn there through his, Ujarak's, influence, with the assistance of his torngak or familiar spirit.  One man there was in that assembly, however, who seemed to be not very deeply touched by the wizard's eloquence.  Yet he did not express unbelief by his looks, but received all that was said with profound gravity.  This was Angut, the reputed angekok, to whom reference has been made in a previous chapter.  Although a thorough Eskimo in dress and in cast of feature, there was a refinement, a gravity, a kindliness, and a _something_ quite indescribable about this man, which marked him out as an exceptional character among his fellows.  As we have said elsewhere, he was not unusually large, though he was unusually strong, for his power lay rather in a well-knit and splendidly proportioned than a bulky frame. Ujarak was taller and broader, yet did not possess half his muscular strength.  Ujarak knew this, and had hitherto avoided coming into collision with him.  But there was also a moral strength and enthusiasm in Angut, which placed him on a platform high above not only Ujarak, but all the other men of his time and country.  In short, he was one of those far-seeing and thoughtful characters, who exist in all countries, in all ranks and conditions of life, civilised and savage, and who are sometimes styled \"Nature's gentlemen.\"  Despite his surroundings, temptations, examples, trials, and worries, Angut was at all times unvaryingly urbane, kind, sedate, equable, obliging, honest, and self-sacrificing.  It mattered not that other men spoke freely--sometimes even a little boastfully--of their exploits. Angut never did so of his, although no other man could hold a candle-- perhaps we should say a lamp--to him in the matter of daring.  It signified not that Eskimos in general were in the habit of treating friendless widows and orphans ill, even robbing as well as neglecting them, Angut always treated well those with whom he had to do.  Other men might neglect people in distress, but he helped and defended them; and it was a matter of absolute indifference to him what \"people\" thought of his conduct.  There is a modified \"Mrs Grundy\" even in Eskimo land, but Angut despised her.  Indeed she was the only creature or thing in his limited world that this good man did despise.  He puzzled his countrymen very much, for they could not understand him.  Other men they could put to shame, or laugh out of their ideas and plans, or frighten into submission--at least into conformity.  Not so Angut.  He was immovable, like an ancient iceberg; proof against threats, wheedling, cajoling, terrifying, sarcasm--proof against everything but kindness.  He could not stand before that.  He went down before it as bergs go down before the summer sun.  Angut was shrewd also and profound of thought, insomuch that, mentally, he stood high above his kinsfolk.  He seemed to see through his fellows as if their bosoms and brains had been made of glass, and all their thoughts visible.  Ujarak knew this also, and did not like it.  But no one suffered because of Angut's superior penetration, for he was too amiable to hurt the feelings of a mosquito.  After all that we have said, the reader will perhaps be prepared to expect that Angut never opened his mouth save to drop words of love and wisdom.  Not so.  Angut was modest to excess.  He doubted his own wisdom; he suspected his own feelings; he felt a strong tendency to defer to the opinion of others, and was prone rather to listen than to speak.  He was fond of a joke too, but seldom perpetrated one, and was seldom severe.  While Ujarak was speaking, Angut listened with that look of unmoved gravity with which he always met a new thing or idea, and which effectually concealed his real feelings, though the concealment was unintentional.  But when at last the wizard came to the most distasteful part of his discourse, namely the message from Reginald Rooney, that, on the occasion of his visit to the camp, he would take up his abode with Angut, that hero's countenance lighted up with surprise, not unmingled with pleasure.  \"Is Ujarak sure that the Kablunet said this?\" asked Angut.  \"Quite sure,\" replied the wizard.  \"Huk!\" exclaimed Angut, by which exclamation you may be sure that he meant to express much satisfaction.  \"But,\" continued the wizard, \"the Kablunet is ill.  He is thin; he is weak.  He wants rest.  I have consulted with my torngak, who tells me he will get better soon if we do not trouble him.\"  At this point Ujarak glanced at Angut, but that worthy's countenance had resumed its look of impenetrable gravity.  \"We must not worry him or go near him for some days,\" continued the wizard.  \"We must let him alone.  And this will not try our patience, for my torngak tells me that seals have come.  Yesterday I went to the house of the great Fury under the sea, and wrestled with her; and my torngak and I overcame her, and set many of the seals and other animals free.\"  \"Huk!\" exclaimed the assembly, in gratified surprise.  Lest the reader should feel some surprise also, we may as well explain what the Greenlanders believed in former times.  They held, (perhaps they still hold), that there were two great spirits--the one was good, named Torngarsuk; the other was bad, and a female--a Fury--without a name.  This malevolent woman was supposed to live in a great house under the ocean, in which by the power of her spells she enthralled and imprisoned many of the sea monsters and birds, thus causing scarcity of food among the Eskimos.  The angekoks claimed to have the power of remedying this state of things by paying a visit to the abode of the Fury.  When an angekok has sufficient courage to undertake this journey, his torngak, after giving him minute instructions how to act, conducts him under the earth or sea, passing on the way through the kingdom of those good souls who spend their lives in felicity and ease.  Soon they come to a frightful vacuity--a sort of vasty deep--over which is suspended a narrow wheel, which whirls round with great rapidity.  This awful abyss is bridged by a rope, and guarded by seal sentinels.  Taking the angekok by the hand, his torngak leads him on the rope over the chasm and past the sentinels into the palace of the Fury.  No sooner does the wicked creature spy the unwelcome visitors than, trembling and foaming with rage, she immediately sets on fire the wing of a sea-fowl, with the stench of which she hopes to suffocate angekok and torngak together, and make both of them captives.  The heroes, however, are prepared for this.  They seize the Fury before she has succeeded in setting fire to the wing, pull her down, and strip her of those amulets by the occult powers of which she has enslaved the inhabitants of ocean.  Thus the spell is broken, for the time at least, and the creatures, being set free, ascend to their proper abodes at the surface of the sea!  After this explanation the reader will easily understand the flutter of excitement that passed through the assembly, for, although feasting at that moment on a walrus, they had suffered much during the latter part of that winter from the scarcity of animals of all kinds.  But Angut did not flutter.  That peculiar man was an incorrigible sceptic.  He merely smiled, and, chucking a rotund little boy beside him under the chin, said, \"What think ye of that, my little ball of fat?\" or some Eskimo equivalent for that question.  Our intelligent wizard had not, however, ventured on these statements without some ground to go on. The fact is, that, being a close observer and good judge of the weather, he had perceived a change of some sort coming on.  While on his way to the hut of Okiok he had also observed that a few seals were playing about on the margin of some ice-floes, and from other symptoms, recognisable only by angekoks, he had come to the conclusion that it would be safe as well as wise at that time to prophesy a period of plenty.  \"Now I would advise,\" he said, in concluding his discourse, \"that we should send off a hunting party to the south, for I can tell you that seals will be found there--if the young men do not put off time on the way.\"  This last proviso was a judicious back-door of escape.  Slight delays, he knew, were almost inevitable, so that, if the hunt should prove a failure, he would have little difficulty in accounting for it, and saving his credit.  The most of his credulous and simple-minded hearers did not reflect on the significance of the back-door remark, but Angut did, and grinned a peculiar grin at the little fat boy, whom he chucked a second time under the chin.  Ujarak noted the grin, and did not like it.  Among the people there who gave strongest expression to their joy at the prospect of the good living in store for them, were several young and middle-aged females who sat in a corner grouped together, and conveyed their approval of what was said to each other by sundry smirks and smiles and nods of the head, which went far to prove that they constituted a little coterie or clique.  One of these was the wife of Simek, the best hunter of the tribe.  Her name was Pussimek.  She was round and short, comely and young, and given to giggling.  She had a baby--a female baby--named after her, but more briefly, Pussi, which resembled her in all respects except size.  Beside her sat the mother of Ippegoo.  We know not her maiden name, but as her dead husband had been called by the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21696"],["title","Red Rooney: The Last of the Crew (#8)"],["body","name as the son, we will style her Mrs Ippegoo.  There was also the mother of Arbalik, a youth who was celebrated as a wonderful killer of birds on the wing--a sort of Eskimo Robin Hood--with the small spear or dart.  The mother of Arbalik was elderly, and stern--for an Eskimo.  She was sister to the great hunter Simek.  Kannoa, a very old dried-up but lively woman with sparkling black eyes, also formed one of the group.  \"Won't we be happy!\" whispered Pussimek, when Ujarak spoke in glowing terms of the abundance that was in prospect.  She followed up the whisper by hugging the baby.  \"Yes, a good time is coming,\" said the mother of Ippegoo, with a pleasant nod.  \"We will keep the cooking-lamps blazing night and--\"  \"And stuff,\" rejoined Pussimek, with a giggle, \"till we can hold no more.\"  \"Do you want to grow fatter?\" asked the mother of Arbalik in a sharp tone, which drew forth a smothered laugh all round, for Pussimek had reached that condition of _embonpoint_ which rendered an increase undesirable.  \"I would not object to be fatter,\" replied the wife of Simek, with perfect good-humour, for Eskimos, as a rule, do not take offence easily.  \"Stuff, stuff,\" murmured Kannoa, nodding her old head contemplatively; \"that's what I'm fond of; stuff--stuff--stuff.\"  \"All your stuffing will never make _you_ fat,\" said the stern and rather cynical mother of Arbalik.  She paid no attention to Kannoa's reply--which, to do her justice, was very mild--for, at the moment, Arbalik himself rose to address the assembly.  He was a fine specimen of an Eskimo--a good-looking young savage; slim and wiry, with a nose not too flat, and only a little turned up; a mouth that was well shaped and pleasant to look at, though very large, and absolutely cavernous when in the act of yawning; and his eyes looked sharp and eager, as if always on the outlook for some passing bird, with a view to transfixion.  \"The words of Ujarak are wise,\" he said.  \"I was down at the high bluffs yesterday, and saw that what he says is true, for many seals are coming up already, and birds too.  Let us go out to the hunt.\"  \"We would like much to see this wonderful Kablunet,\" remarked the jovial big hunter Simek, with a bland look at the company, \"but Ujarak knows best.  If the Kablunet needs rest, he must have it.  If he needs sleep, he must have it.  If he wants food, he must have it.  By all means let him have it.  We will not disturb him.  What the torngak of Ujarak advises we will do.\"  Several of the other leading men also spoke on this occasion--some inclining to accept the wizard's advice; others, who were intolerably anxious to see the Kablunet, rather inclining to the opinion that they should remain where they were till he recovered strength enough to be able to pay his contemplated visit.  Ippegoo spoke last.  Indeed, it was not usual for him to raise his voice in council, but as he had been the first to carry the important news, and was known to be an ardent admirer and pupil of Ujarak, he felt that he was bound to back his patron; and his arguments, though not cogent, prevailed.  \"Let us not doubt the wisdom of the angekok,\" he said.  \"His torngak speaks.  It is our business to obey.  We have starved much for some moons; let us now feast, and grow fat and strong.\"  \"Huk!\" exclaimed the auditors, who had been touched on their weakest point.  \"But Angut has not yet uttered his mind,\" said the jovial Simek, turning with a bland expression to the man in question; \"he is an angekok, though he will not admit it.  Has not his familiar spirit said anything to him?\"  Angut looked gravely at the speaker for a moment or two, and shook his head.  Dead silence prevailed.  Then in a voice that was unusually soft and deep he said: \"I am no angekok.  No torngak ever speaks to me.  The winds that whistle round the icebergs and rush among the hummocks on the frozen sea speak to me sometimes; the crashing ice-cliffs that thunder down the glens speak to me; the noisy rivulets, the rising sun and moon and winking stars all speak to me, though it is difficult to understand what they say; but no familiar spirit ever speaks to me.\"  The man said this quietly, and in a tone of regret, but without the slightest intention of expressing poetical ideas, or laying claim to originality of thought.  Yet his distinct denial of being an angekok or wise man, and his sentiments regarding the voices of Nature, only confirmed his countrymen in their belief that he was the greatest angekok they had ever seen or heard of.  \"But surely,\" urged Simek, \"if so many spirits speak to you, they must tell you _something_?\"  \"They tell me much,\" replied Angut in a contemplative tone, \"but nothing about hunting.\"  \"Have you no opinion, then, on that subject?\"  \"Yes, I have an opinion, and it is strong.  Let all the hunters go south after seals without delay; but I will not go.  I shall go among the icebergs--alone.\"  \"He will go to hold converse with his numerous torngaks,\" whispered old Kannoa to Pussimek.  \"He will go to visit Okiok, and see the Kablunet, and court Nunaga,\" thought the jealous and suspicious Ujarak.  And Ujarak was right; yet he dared not follow, for he feared the grave, thoughtful man, in spite of his determination to regard and treat him with lofty disdain.  Utterly ignorant of the wizard's feelings towards him--for he was slow to observe or believe in ill-will towards himself when he felt none to any one else--Angut set off alone next morning in the direction that led to the great glacier, while his countrymen harnessed their dogs, loaded their sledges with lines and weapons, and went away southward on a hunting expedition.  Wishing the latter all success, we will follow the fortunes of Angut, the eccentric angekok.  Had you and I, reader, been obliged to follow him in the body, we should soon have been left far behind; fortunately, spirit is more powerful and fleet than matter!  Without rest or halt, the stalwart Eskimo journeyed over the ice until he reached the residence of Okiok.  The dogs knew his step well, and gave no noisy sign of his approach, though they rose to welcome him with wagging tails, and rubbed their noses against his fur coat as he patted their heads.  Creeping into the hut, he presented himself unexpectedly.  Okiok bade him silent welcome, with a broad grin of satisfaction.  Nunaga did the same, with a pleased smile and a decided blush.  The other inmates of the hut showed similar friendship, and Tumbler, trying to look up, fell over into an oil-puddle, with a loud crow of joy.  They all then gazed suddenly and simultaneously, with mysterious meaning, at Red Rooney, who lay coiled up, and apparently sound asleep, in the innermost corner.  Angut also gazed with intense interest, though nothing of the sleeping man was visible save the point of his nose and a mass of curling brown hair protruding from his deerskin coverings.  Seating himself quietly between Nunaga and Nuna, and taking the oily Tumbler on his knee, the visitor entered into a low-toned conversation respecting this great event of their lives--the arrival of a real live Kablunet!  They also talked of Kablunets in general, and their reported ways and manners.  It is to be noted here that they did not talk in whispers.  Okiok and Nuna had indeed begun the conversation thus, but had been immediately checked by Angut, whose intelligence had long ago taught him that no sound is so apt to awaken a sleeper as the hiss of a whisper; and that a steady, low-toned hum of conversation is more fitted to deepen than interrupt slumber.  \"Is he _very_ thin?\" asked Angut, who had been somewhat impressed by Ujarak's description of the stranger, and his evident desire that no one should go near him.  \"He is not fat,\" answered Okiok, \"but he has not been starving long; sleeping and stuffing will soon make him strong.  Don't you think so, Norrak?  You saw him at his worst, when we found him on the ice.\"  Thus appealed to, Okiok's eldest son laid down the piece of blubber with which he had been engaged, nodded his head several times, and said, \"Yes, he will be able to run, and jump soon.\"  \"And he speaks our language _well_,\" said Okiok, with a look of great interest.  \"I know it,\" returned his friend; \"Ujarak told us about that.  It is because of that, that I have come at once to see him.\"  Nunaga winced here, for she had timidly hoped that Angut had come to see _her_!  \"I would not,\" continued the visitor, \"that Ujarak should be the first to speak to him, for he will poison his ears.\"  \"Yes, Ujarak is a dreadful liar,\" said Okiok solemnly, but without the slightest touch of ill feeling.  \"An awful liar,\" remarked Nuna softly.  Nunaga smiled, as though acquiescing in the sentiment, but said nothing.  Just as they gave utterance to this decided opinion as to the character of the wizard, Red Rooney turned round, stretched himself, yawned, and sat up.    CHAPTER SIX.  ANGUT AND ROONEY HOLD CONVERSE ON MANY THINGS.  At first Rooney did not observe that there was a visitor in the hut, but, when his eyes alighted on him, he rose at once, for he felt that he was in the presence of a man possessed of intelligence vastly superior to that of the ordinary natives.  It was not so much that Angut's presence was commanding or noble, as that his grave expression, broad forehead, and earnest gaze suggested the idea of a man of profound thought.  The angekok who had been so graphically described to him by Okiok at once recurred to Rooney's mind.  Turning to his host, he said, with a bland expression--  \"I suppose this is your friend Angut, the angekok?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Okiok.  While the mysterious foreigner was speaking, Angut gazed at him with looks and feelings of awe, but when he stepped forward, and frankly held out his hand, the Eskimo looked puzzled.  A whispered word from his host, however, sufficed to explain.  Falling in at once with the idea, he grasped the offered hand, and gave it a squeeze of good-will that"]]]
