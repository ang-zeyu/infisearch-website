I was the worst of them all.\"  There was something terrible in the tone and manner in which this was uttered, as if the breast of the speaker were torn with conflicting feelings.  \"She must have met wi' the missionaries some time or other,\" whispered Reuben.  \"Is the old woman the only one of all the tribe left alive?\" asked Swiftarrow.  \"Ay, the only one--no, not the _only_ one; my son is yet alive.  He went to set a bear-trap not _very_ long since; but he should have come back before now.  He will be back soon.\"  The deep sigh which followed proved that the poor old woman was hoping against hope.  \"How long is't since he left you, mother?\" asked Lawrence eagerly.  \"Two suns have risen and set since he left, and he had not far to go.\"  \"Father, I'll go seek for this man,\" said Lawrence; \"something may have befallen him.\"  Reuben made no objection, and the youth set off immediately in a direction which was pointed out by the old woman.  After he was gone his father and the Indian shifted one of the cleanest looking of the empty tents to a considerable distance from the spot where the terrible work of death had been done, and removing the old woman from the neighbourhood of the pestilential atmosphere, placed her therein, kindled a fire and cooked her a little food, of which she evidently stood much in need.  Meanwhile Lawrence sped through the pathless forest with the light step of a strong youth and the precision of a practised hunter.  About four miles from the Indian camp he came upon the track of a bear, the footprints of which proved that it was an unusually large one.  He followed it up closely, and was led by it to a spot where some trees had been cut down, and not far from which he saw what appeared to him to be the remains of a trap.  Almost at the same moment of his making this discovery he heard a growl, and saw the bear itself--a monster of the brown species, which differs from the ordinary black bear of America in being more carnivorous and much larger, as well as more savage and bold. No sooner did it see the youth than it rushed upon him with great fury. A piece of broken line was drawn tight round its neck, and another piece round its fore-leg, while four arrows stuck in its shoulder and side, showing plainly that it had broken loose from a snare and had been attacked by man.  But Lawrence had no time to think on these things.  He had barely time to throw forward and cock his gun when the bear was upon him.  It rose on its hind-legs, and in doing so towered high above the youth, who, whatever his feelings might have been, looked undismayed. With an unflinching eye he took aim at the monster's heart, and shot it dead.  So close was it to him that he singed the hair on its breast and had to leap to one side to avoid being struck as it fell.  Reloading quickly, the young hunter advanced towards the trap, where his worst fears were realised, for near to it he found the body of an Indian torn limb from limb, and mostly eaten, except the head, which remained entire.  It was evident that the poor man, having set several snares for bears, had gone to visit them, and found this brown bear caught by the head and leg.  He seemed to have tried to kill it with arrows, but must have been afraid to go near enough to use his weapons with effect, and the enraged animal, having broken the snare, flew upon him and tore him to pieces.  Brown bears of this kind are very powerful.  One traveller in these regions saw the footprints of a large one, which, having seized a moose-deer in a river, dragged it for a quarter of a mile along the sandy banks, and afterwards devoured it all except part of the hind-quarters; and the moose which had been treated in this unceremonious way, judging from the size and hardness of the bones, must have been upwards of a year old, when it would weigh as much as an ox of the same age.  Collecting the scattered remnants of the unfortunate Indian, who was no other than the old woman's son, Lawrence covered them over with leaves and sticks.  He then skinned the bear and cut off its claws, which he carried away as trophies, along with one or two choice steaks cut from the creature's flank.  He also collected the weapons and part of the dress of the Indian, with which he returned to the camp.  \"Heyday!  Lawrence, what have you got there, lad?\" said Reuben, as his son came up and threw the bundle on the ground.  \"A brown bear, father.\"  \"Well done!\" exclaimed Reuben, with a look of pride, for although his son had shot many a black bear in the forest, he had never before stood face to face with such a monster as that whose skin and claws now lay at his feet.  \"It would have been well, father,\" said Lawrence gravely, \"if the man who first saw this had owned a gun.  His arrows were no better than needles in such a hide.  See here!\"  He drew from his breast the bloody portions of dress which had belonged to the slaughtered Indian.  \"The son of the old woman has gone to the happy hunting-grounds,\" said Swiftarrow, referring to the heaven of the Indian, as he lifted and examined the dress.  \"Ay, ay,\" said Reuben sadly, \"'tis the chances of the wilderness.  You'd better tell the poor old creetur', Swiftarrow; you understand her ways and lingo better than me.\"  Silently the Indian went to the old woman, and laid the bloody garments before her.  At first she did not understand what had happened. Suddenly the truth flashed upon her, and she looked quickly up into the grave countenance of the Indian, but death and sorrow appeared to have already done their worst on her, for she neither spoke nor wept for some time.  She took up the shreds of cloth and turned them over tenderly; but neither sign nor groan escaped her.  Evidently she had been already so stunned by the horrors which had surrounded her for some time, that this additional blow did not tell--at least, not at first--but Reuben observed, while trying to comfort her some time afterwards, that a few tears were coursing slowly down her withered cheeks.  That night, round the camp-fire, the pioneers held earnest counsel, and resolved, sadly but firmly, that their projected journey must be given up for that season.  \"It's a hard thing to do,\" said Reuben, as he lay at full length before the fire after supper, \"to give up our plans after comin' so far; but it ain't possible to carry that old 'ooman along with us an' it's not to be thought of to leave her behind to starve, so there's nothin' for it but to go back an' take her wi' us to the settlements.  I would feel like a murderer if I was to leave one o' God's creeturs to perish in the wilderness.  What think you, Lawrence?\"  \"I think you are right, father,\" replied the youth, with a deep sigh.  \"An' what says Swiftarrow?\"  \"Go back,\" was the Indian's prompt and laconic answer.  \"Well, then, we're all agreed, so we'll turn back on our trail to-morrow; but I shall try again next year if I'm above ground.  I once know'd a Yankee who had what he called a motto, an' it was this, `Never give in, 'xcept w'en yer wrong.'  I think I'll take to that motto.  It seems to me a good 'un.\"  In proof, we presume, of his sincerity, Reuben Guff rolled himself in his blanket, stretched his feet towards the fire, pillowed his head on a bundle of moss, and at once _gave in_ to the seductive influences of sleep; an example which was so irresistible that his companions followed it without delay.    CHAPTER THREE.  INTRODUCES THE KING OF PIONEERS.  Discarding space and ignoring time, we seize you by the hand, reader, and bound away with you still deeper into the northern wilderness, away into that remote region which, at the time we write of, was the _ultima thule_ of the fur-traders of Canada,--beyond which lay the great unknown world, stretching to the pole.  Here, amid the grand scenery of the Rocky Mountains, lies the Athabasca Lake, also styled the Lake of the Hills.  We prefer the latter name, as being more romantic.  This is no pretty pond such as we in England are wont to visit and delight in during our summer holidays.  It is a great sheet of water; a grand fresh-water sea, 200 miles long and 15 miles broad--a fitting gem for the bosom of the mighty region on which it glitters.  A year has fled since the period of our last chapter, and here, in a birch-bark canoe on the waters of the Lake of the Hills, we find our pioneers--Reuben Guff, his son Lawrence, and his Indian friend Swiftarrow.  There is also a young Indian woman in the canoe-- Swiftarrow's wife.  The kind-hearted red man adopted the old woman who had been rescued on their previous trip, but, not finding her a good substitute for his own mother, he bethought him of adding a young squaw to his establishment. While he meditated on this step, the old woman died.  About the same time Reuben Guff made proposals to him to join him on a second \"v'yage of diskivery.\"  The Indian agreed; got married off-hand, and took his bride along with him.  We now find them all four at the Lake of the Hills.  It may be as well to observe, in passing, that Indian brides are usually more robust than those of civilised communities.  They are quite competent to follow their lords on the most arduous canoe voyages, and, besides being able to wield the paddle with great dexterity, are exceedingly useful in managing what may be styled the domestic matters of the camp.  They also keep up a constant supply of the Indian's indispensable foot-gear--moccasins--which are so slender in their nature that a pair may be completely worn-out in a single day of hard hunting.  The brown bride, therefore, was not a hindrance to the party, but a useful member of it, as well as a pleasant companion.  True, her companionship consisted chiefly in answering \"yes\" and \"no\" when spoken to, and in smiling pleasantly at all times; but this was sufficient to satisfy the moderate demands of her male friends "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21691"],["title","The Pioneers (#3)"],["body","her intellectual resources.  \"Fort Chipewyan at _last_,\" said Reuben, resting his paddle across the canoe and looking earnestly towards the horizon; \"I hope we ain't too late after all our pushin' on.  It would be hard to find that Monsieur Mackenzie had started.\"  \"Too much ice in the lake,\" said Swiftarrow.  \"He has not gone yet.\"  \"I'm not so sure o' that,\" observed Lawrence.  \"If reports be true, Monsieur Mackenzie is not the man to wait until the ice is all off the lakes and nothin' but plain sailin' lies before him.\"  \"That's true, lad,\" replied Reuben, resuming his paddle.  \"I wonder,\" he murmured to himself, as he gazed wistfully towards the unknown north, \"I wonder if the big river is really there, an' if it _do_ jine the sea?\"  That same question was put to himself that same evening--though not for the first time--by one of the inhabitants of Fort Chipewyan.  The fort was a mere group of two or three log-huts.  In the largest of these huts sat a man whose strongly-marked handsome countenance gave evidence of a bold enterprising spirit and a resolute will.  He pored over a map for some time, carefully tracing a few pencil-lines into the blank spaces on the paper, and then murmured, in words which were almost identical with those of Reuben Guff, \"I wonder if it joins the Polar Sea?\"  This man was the true pioneer, or, rather, the king of pioneers, to whom Guff gave place without a murmur, for Reuben was a modest man; and the moment he heard that one of the gentlemen of the Canadian fur-trading company had taken up his favourite hobby, and meant to work out the problem, he resolved, as he said, \"to play second fiddle,\" all the more that the man who thus unwittingly supplanted him was a mountaineer of the Scottish Highlands.  \"It's of no manner of use, you see,\" he said to Swiftarrow, when conversing on the subject, \"for me to go off on a v'yage o' diskivery w'en a gentleman like Monsieur Mackenzie, with a good edication an' scienteefic knowledge and the wealth of a fur company at his back, is goin' to take it in hand.  No; the right thing for Reuben Guff to do in the circumstances is to jine him an' play second fiddle--or third, if need be.\"  Alexander Mackenzie--while seated in the lowly hut of that solitary outpost poring over his map, trying to penetrate mentally into those mysterious and unknown lands which lay just beyond him--saw, in imagination, a great river winding its course among majestic mountains towards the shores of the ice-laden polar seas.  He also saw the lofty peaks and snow-clad ridges of that mighty range which forms the back-bone of the American continent, and--again in imagination--passed beyond it and penetrated the vast wilderness to the Pacific, thus adding new lands to the British Crown, and opening up new sources of wealth to the fur company of which he was one of the most energetic members.  He saw all this in imagination, we say, but he did _not_, at that time, see his name attached to one of the largest American rivers, classed with the names of the most noted discoverers of the world, and himself knighted.  Still less, if possible, did he see, even in his wildest flights of fancy, that the book of travels which he was destined to write, would be translated into French by the order of Napoleon the First, for the express purpose of being studied by Marshal Bernadotte, with the view of enabling that warrior to devise a roundabout and unlooked-for attack on Canada--in rear, as it were--from the region of the northern wilderness--a fact which is well worthy of record!  [See Appendix for an interesting letter on the subject.]  None of these things loomed on the mind of the modest though romantic and enterprising man, for at that time he was only at the beginning of his career of discovery.  It may not be out of place here to say a word or two as to the early career of the hero whose footsteps we are about to follow.  He was a Highlander, to begin with; and possessed all the fire and determination peculiar to that race.  At an early period of life he was led to engage in commercial enterprises in the country north-west of Lake Superior, joined the North-West Fur Company of Canada in 1784, and went into the Indian country the following spring.  It is not necessary to say more than that Alexander Mackenzie proved himself to be a first-rate fur-trader at a time when the fur-trade was carried on under great difficulties and amid severe privations.  For many years he was in charge of Fort Chipewyan, the remote establishment to which we have just conducted our reader.  Seven years before his coming on the scene, the Lake of the Hills had not been visited by white men, and was known only through Indian report.  When Mackenzie became ruler of the district, all beyond the lake was _terra incognita_.  His spirit was one which thirsted to explore the unknown.  He was eminently fitted both to hold an advanced post and to invade new regions, being robust in constitution, powerful in frame, inquisitive in mind, and enterprising in spirit.  Frequently had he arrived at Fort Chipewyan with ninety or a hundred men without any provision for their sustenance for the winter save their fishing-nets and guns.  He was therefore accustomed to live from hand to mouth, and to depend on his own exertions and resources in a country where the winter is upwards of eight months long and the severity of the climate extreme.  It was in June 1789 that he made preparations to start on his first voyage of discovery.  Rising from the table at which he had been studying his projected route, Mackenzie turned, with the air of a man who has made up his mind, and said to a clerk who was smoking beside the fireplace--  \"Le Roux, if we cannot prevail on these Indians to accompany us, I have determined to start without them.  Has the small canoe been gummed?\"  \"It has,\" answered Le Roux, \"but I would advise delay for a day or two. If we give them time, the Indians may change their minds; besides, the ice has not yet sufficiently cleared away.\"  Mackenzie paced the room impatiently, and his eyes flashed for one moment with impatience.  They were deep blue eyes that could beam with melting tenderness or sparkle with suppressed passion--it is but just to add that passion in his case was usually suppressed, for he was a lover of peace, as most truly great and powerful men usually are:  \"Let us see now,\" he said, sitting down in front of Le Roux, \"how our resources stand.  In my canoe there will be the four Canadians and the German.  Then there's our Indian friend, English Chief and his two wives, who will embark in the second-sized canoe.  The two young Indians whom we want to accompany us with their wives must make up their minds to-night, else I will start without them.  Your own canoe with goods for trade and provisions, will not be fully loaded; I shall therefore place in it the provisions that we can't carry, and when we come to the place where you are to stop and trade, and where I shall bid you farewell, we shall doubtless have eaten our lading down sufficiently to take the whole on board.  See, by the way, that the goods and trinkets to be given in presents as we go along are not placed in the wrong canoe.\"  \"They are already laid with the other goods, and also the nets and ammunition by themselves,\" said Le Roux, rising and laying down his pipe.  At that moment Reuben Guff entered with his friends.  The surprise of Mackenzie was great on beholding them, but greater still was his delight when he learned their errand.  The young Indians were forthwith told that their services would not now be required, and our friends-- including Swiftarrow's wife, Darkeye--were at once added to the exploring party.  Next day the expedition set forth from Fort Chipewyan and swept over the broad breast of the Lake of the Hills.  We will not trace their course over known ground.  Suffice it to say that their troubles began at once.  Soon after leaving the lake they came to a rapid part of the river which flows out of it, where they were obliged to land and carry canoes and goods to the still water further down, but here the ice was still unthawed on the banks, rendering the process of reloading difficult.  Soon after they came to a place called the _Portage_ _d'Embarras_, which is occasioned by driftwood filling up the channel of the river.  There they entered the Slave River, where there is a portage or carrying-place named the Mountain, the landing at which is very steep and close to the fall.  Below this fall there is a mile of dangerous rapids--and here they met with their first disaster.  Reuben and Swiftarrow having landed with part of the cargo of the small canoe, had left it in charge of Darkeye,--so named because of her large and lustrous eyes, which, however, were the only good points about her, for she was ill-favoured and clumsy, though strong of frame and a diligent worker.  While she was moving from one point of rock to another that appeared to her more convenient for landing, the canoe was caught by an eddy and swept in a moment out into the strong current, down which it sped with fearful velocity towards the falls.  Darkeye was quite collected and cool, but she happened to dip her paddle on the edge of a sunk rock with such vigour that the canoe overturned.  Upon the heights above her husband saw the accident, and stood rooted for a moment in helpless dismay to the spot.  It chanced that Lawrence Guff was at the time the only man near the unfortunate woman, who, although she swam like an otter, could not gain the bank.  Seeing this, the youth sprang towards a jutting rock that almost overhung the fall, and entering the rushing stream so deeply that he could barely retain his foothold, caught the woman by the hair of the head as she was sweeping towards the edge of the fall.  The two swayed for a few seconds on the verge of destruction; then Swiftarrow came bounding down the bank like a deer, and, catching Lawrence"]]]
