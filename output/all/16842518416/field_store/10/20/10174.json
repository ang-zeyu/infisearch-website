Enough for us to know that their warfare prevented any pursuit of the young fugitives.  Weeks passed, and Roy and Nelly wandered on; all fear of pursuit soon left them.  Ducks, geese, and other waterfowl, came in myriads with the spring.  Roy had brought with him his gun (the one he was wont to use in hunting), and bow and quiver.  They fed on the fat of the land.  Summer advanced, and game became less plentiful; still, there was more than sufficient to supply them with abundance of food.  Autumn approached; the wild fowl that had passed northward in spring, began to return southward, and again the wants of the young wanderers were superabundantly supplied.  The pole-star was Roy's guide.  At night he laid his course by it; and by the sun during the day, making constant allowance, of course, for the sun's rate of travelling through the sky, and taking advantage of all prominent landmarks on the way.  Time sped on; many weary miles were travelled, but no sign of Fort Enterprise was to be seen.  Day after day, week after week, month after month they wandered, and still found themselves in the heart of an unknown wilderness.  Occasionally they observed signs of Indians, and carefully kept out of sight at such times, as you may easily believe.  At last there came a day when hard frost set in.  It was the first touch of another winter.  Roy and Nelly did not betray their feelings to each other, but their hearts sank as they thought of what lay before them. The frost was short-lived, however; towards noon the air became delightfully warm, and their spirits revived.  On reaching the summit of an eminence, up which they had toiled for several hours, they beheld a small lake, in which the silvery clouds were clearly reflected.  The day was calm; the sun unusually brilliant; the autumnal foliage most gorgeous in colour.  It was like a scene in fairy-land!  \"Splendid!\" exclaimed Roy, sitting down beside his sister on the trunk of a fallen tree.  \"Oh! _how_ beautiful,\" cried Nelly.  \"It's so like silver,\" said Roy.  \"Silver Lake,\" murmured Nelly.  Roy seemed to think the name appropriate, for he echoed the words, \"Yes, Silver Lake.\"  And there brother and sister sat, for a long time, on the fallen tree, in silent admiration of the scene.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.  A small Indian sledge, dragged on the snow, either by hand or by dog with loops at the sides for lashing the loading of the sledge upon it.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  THE ENCAMPMENT ON SILVER LAKE.  When Roy and Nelly sat down to gaze in admiration on Silver Lake, they little thought how long a period they should have to spend on its shores.  The lake was a small sheet of water not more than half a mile broad, embosomed among low hills, which, though not grand, were picturesque in outline, and wooded to their tops.  It occupied the summit of an elevated region or height-of-land--a water-shed, in fact--and Roy afterwards discovered that water flowed from both the north-east and south-west sides of the table-land, in the midst of which it lay.  These fountain-heads, separated by little more than half a mile from each other, were the sources of streams, which, flowing in opposite directions through hundreds of miles of wild, beautiful, and uncultivated wilderness, found their way, on the one hand, into Hudson's Bay, on the other hand, into the Atlantic through the great rivers and lakes of Canada.  The waters of the lake were strikingly clear and pellucid.  When the young wanderer first came upon the scene, not a zephyr stirred the leaves of the forest; the blue sky was studded with towering masses of white clouds which glowed in sunshine, and these reflected in the glassy water--as if far, far down in its unfathomable depths--produced that silvery effect which prompted Nelly to utter the name which we have adopted.  Small though the Silver Lake was, it boasted two islets, which like twin babes lay side by side on their mother's fair breast, their reflected images stretching down into that breast as if striving to reach and grasp its heart!  \"Couldn't we stay here a short time?\" asked Nelly, breaking the silence in a tone that indicated anxiety, hope, and enthusiasm, \"only for a very _little_ time,\" she added, coaxingly.  Roy looked grave and sagacious.  Boys, as well as men, like to be leant upon and trusted by the fair sex--at least in things masculine--and Nelly had such boundless faith in her brother's capacity to protect her and guide her through the forest, that she unwittingly inspired him with an exuberant amount of courage and self-reliance.  The lad was bold and fearless enough by nature.  His sister's confidence in him had the effect of inducing him to think himself fit for anything!  He affected, therefore, at times, a look of grave sagacity, befitting, as he thought, so important and responsible a character.  \"I've just been thinking,\" said he--  \"Oh! don't _think_, but say yes!\" interrupted Nelly.  \"Well, I'm going to say yes, but I meant to give you my reasons for sayin' so.  In the first place, my powder and shot is gettin' low.  You see I did not bring away very much from the Injun camp, and we've been using it for so many months now that it won't last much longer, so I think it would not be a bad plan to stop here awhile and fish and shoot and feed up--for you need rest, Nelly--and then start fresh with a well-loaded sledge.  I'll save some powder by using the bow we made the other day.\"  \"But you forget it's broken.\"  \"So it is--never mind, we can make another--there's a tree that will make a first-rater down in the hollow, d'ye see it, Nell?\"  \"Where--oh yes--just by the grassy place where the rock juts out into the water with the sun shining on it? what a _nice_ place to build a hut!\"  \"Just so,\" said Roy, smiling at the girl's enthusiasm, \"that's the spot, and that's the very thought that jumped bang into my brain as you spoke. By the way, does a thought jump _into_ a man's brain or _out_ of it, I wonder?\"  \"Out of it, of course,\" cried Nelly, with a laugh.  \"I'm not so sure of that, Nell.  I send it rather slowly out through my mouth, but I think it jumps _into_ my brain.  I wonder how it gets in; whether by the eyes, or ears, or mouth--perhaps it goes up the nose.\"  \"What stuff you do talk!\" cried Nelly.  \"D'ye think so,\" said Roy with a grin, \"well, that bein' the case, let's go and fix our camp, for the sun is not given to sitting up all night in these parts, so we must work while it shines.\"  With hurried steps and eager looks, (for Roy, despite his affected coolness, was as enthusiastic about the new plan as his sister,) they descended to the margin of Silver Lake, and began to make their encampment on the sunny spot before referred to.  It turned out to be most suitable for their purpose, having a gentle slope towards the margin of the lake, which was fringed with a beach of pure white pebbles, and being well sheltered in the rear by umbrageous trees.  The point of rocks close at hand formed a natural jetty, which, Roy observed, would be useful as a landing-place when he got his raft under way; the turf was soft, a matter of some importance, as it was to form their couch at night, and a small stream trickled down from one of the numerous springs which welled up at the foot of the nearest hill.  Solitary and remote from the usual haunts of men as this lake was, there was no feeling of solitude about it at the time we write of.  The entire region was alive with wild fowl of many kinds.  Wild geese trumpeted their advent as they came from the far north, _en route_ for the far south, and settled on the bosom of Silver Lake to take a night's lodging there.  Ducks, from the same region, and bound for the same goal--though with less stately and regular flight--flew hither and thither with whistling wings, ever and anon going swash into the water as a tempting patch of reeds invited them to feed, or a whim of fancy induced them to rest.  Wild swans occasionally sailed in all their majesty on its waters, while plover of every length of limb and bill, and every species of plaintive cry, waded round its margin, or swept in clouds over the neighbouring swamps.  Sometimes deer would trot out of the woods and slake their thirst on its shore, and the frequent rings that broke its smooth surface told of life in the watery depths below.  The whole air was filled with gushing sounds of wild melody, as though bird and beast were uniting in a hymn of praise to the beneficent Creator who had provided the means of, and given the capacity for, so much enjoyment.  Having decided on a suitable spot for their temporary resting-place, Roy's first care was to construct a hut.  This was neither a work of time nor difficulty.  In a couple of hours it was finished.  He commenced the work by felling about a dozen young fir-trees not much thicker than a man's wrist, from which he chopped the branches, thus leaving them bare poles about nine feet long.  While he was thus employed, his sister cleared the spot on which their dwelling was to stand, and, having an eye to the picturesque, so arranged that the opening of the hut should command an uninterrupted view of the lake.  On going into the \"bush\" to the place where Roy was at work, she found him cutting down his sixth tree, and the ground was strewn with the flat branches of those already cut.  \"Come along, Nelly--how hot I am--carry these branches into camp, lass, an' go ahead, for I've got supper to kill yet.\"  Nelly made no direct reply, but muttered to herself something that sounded very like, \"Oh, what fun!\" as she filled her tiny arms with pine branches, and, hugging them to her heaving breast, staggered to the camp.  When she had carried all the branches, Roy had cut all the poles, so he proceeded to set them up.  Tying three poles together at the top, and using the pliant roots of a tree for the purpose, he set"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21703"],["title","Silver Lake (#6)"],["body","up in the form of a tripod.  Against these three all the other poles were piled, crossing each other at the top, and spreading out at the base so as to enclose a circle of about six feet in diameter.  Being numerous, the poles were pretty close together, thus affording good support to the branches which were afterwards piled on them.  Pine branches are flat, spreading, and thick, so that when laid above each other to a depth of several inches they form a very good shelter from dew and light rain. The hut was entirely covered with such branches, which were kept in their places by other poles leaning upon and pressing them down.  The floor of the hut was also covered with pine \"brush.\"  \"Now for supper, Nelly,\" said Roy, seizing his bow, when the hut was completed, and splicing its broken part with a strip of deerskin cut from the lines of the sledge.  \"Get a goose, Roy, and pick out a nice fat one,\" cried Nelly, laughing, \"I'll have the fire ready when you come back.\"  \"I'll try,\" said Roy, and he did try, but tried in vain.  Although a good shot, he was not sufficiently expert with the bow to shoot wild fowl on the wing, so he returned to the hut empty-handed.  \"We must make a new bow, Nell,\" said he, sitting down by the fire, \"I can do nothin' wi' this, and it won't do to use the gun for anythin' but deer.  Meanwhile let's have the remains of our dinner for supper.  Come, cheer up, old 'ooman; we shall feast on the fat of the land to-morrow!\"  The stars were shining in the sky, and winking at their reflections down in the depths of Silver Lake, and the lake itself lay, as black as ink, under the shadow of the hills, when the brother and sister spread their blanket above them that night, and sank, almost immediately, into profound slumber.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  HUNTING, AND OTHER MATTERS, ON SILVER LAKE.  Sunrise is a gladsome event almost at all times; we say \"almost,\" because there are times when sunrise is _not_ particularly gladsome.  In the arctic regions of Norway, for instance, we have seen it rise only twenty minutes after it set, and the rising and setting were so much mingled, that no very strong feelings of any kind were awakened. Moreover, we were somewhat depressed at the time, in consequence of having failed to reach those latitudes where the sun does not set at all for several weeks in summer, but shines night and day.  To the sick, sunrise brings little comfort; too often it is watched for with weariness, and beheld, at last, with a feeling of depression at the thought that another day of pain has begun.  But to the healthy, and especially to the young, sunrise is undoubtedly, on most occasions, a gladsome event.  At least Nelly Gore thought so when she awoke and beheld, from the floor of the hut where she lay, a flood of yellow glory gushing through a valley, turning Silver Lake into gold, tipping the trees with fire, and blazing full in Roy's face, which was at that moment turned up to the sky with the mouth open, and the nose snoring.  \"Oh, _how_ beautiful!\" screamed Nelly, in the exuberance of her delight.  \"Hallo! murder! come on, ye black varmints,\" shouted Roy, as he sprang up and seized the axe which lay at his side.  \"Oh, it's only _you_, what a yell you do give, Nelly! why, one would think you were a born Injun; what is't all about, lass?  Ye-a-ow! how sleepy I am--too late to have another nap, I suppose, eh?\"  \"Oh yes, lazy thing! get up and come out quick!\" cried the other, as she sprang up and ran out of the hut to enjoy the full blaze of the sunshine, and the fresh morning air.  That morning Nelly could do little but ramble about in a wild sort of fashion, trying to imagine that she was queen of the world around her! She sobered down, however, towards noon, and went diligently about the work which Roy had given her to do.  She had the internal arrangements of the hut to complete and improve, some pairs of mocassins to mend, and several arrows to feather, besides other matters.  Meanwhile Roy went out to hunt.  Determined not to use his fast-diminishing ammunition, except on large game, and anxious to become more expert with the bow, he set to work the first thing that day, and made a new bow.  Armed with this and a dozen arrows, he sallied forth.  Some of his arrows were pointed with ivory, some with iron, and some had no points at all, but blunt heavy heads instead.  These latter were, and still are, used by Indians in shooting game that is tame and easily killed.  Grouse of various kinds, for instance, if hit with full force from a short range by a blunt-headed arrow, will be effectually stunned, especially if hit on the head.  At first Roy walked along the shores of the lake, but was not very successful, because the ducks and geese were hid among reeds, and rose suddenly with a distracting _whirr_, usually flying off over the water. To have let fly at these would have cost him an arrow every shot, so, after losing one, he wisely restrained himself.  After a time, he turned into the woods, resolving to try his fortune where his arrows were not so likely to be lost.  He had not gone far, when a tree-grouse sprang into the air and settled on a neighbouring pine.  Roy became excited, for he was anxious not to return to the hut empty-handed a second time.  He fitted a sharp-headed arrow to the string, and advanced towards the bird cautiously.  His anxiety to make little noise was so great, that he tripped over a root and fell with a hideous crash into the middle of a dead bush, the branches of which snapped like a discharge of little crackers.  Poor Roy got up disgusted, but on looking up found that the grouse was still sitting there, filled apparently with more curiosity than alarm.  Seeing this he advanced to within a few yards of the bird, and, substituting a blunt arrow for the sharp one, discharged it with vigour.  It hit the grouse on the left eye, and brought it to the ground like a stone.  \"Good, that's `number one,'\" muttered the lad as he fastened the bird to his belt; \"hope `number two' is not far off.\"  \"Number two\" was nearer than he imagined, for four other birds of the same kind rose a few yards ahead of him, with all the noise and flurry that is characteristic of the species.  They settled on a tree not far off, and looked about them.  \"Sit there, my fine fellows, till I come up,\" muttered Roy.  (The lad had a habit of speaking to himself while out hunting.)  They obeyed the order, and sat until he was close to them.  Again was the blunt arrow fitted to the string; once more it sped true to its mark, and \"number two\" fell fluttering to the ground.  Now, the grouse of North America is sometimes a very stupid creature. It literally sits still to be shot, if the hunter is only careful to fire first at the lowest bird of the group.  If he were to fire at the topmost one, its fluttering down amongst the others would start them off.  Roy was aware of this fact, and had aimed at the bird that sat lowest on the tree.  Another arrow was discharged, and \"number three\" lay sprawling on the ground.  The blunt arrows being exhausted, he now tried a sharp one, but missed.  The birds stretched their necks, turned their heads on one side, and looked at the lad, as though to say, \"It won't do,--try again!\"  Another shaft was more successful.  It pierced the heart of \"number four,\" and brought it down like a lump of lead.  \"Number five\" seemed a little perplexed by this time, and made a motion as though it were about to fly off, but an arrow caught it in the throat, and cut short its intentions and its career.  Thus did Roy bag, or rather belt, five birds consecutively.  [See note one.]  Our hero was not one of those civilised sportsmen who slaughter as much game as they can.  He merely wanted to provide food for a day or two. He therefore turned his steps homeward--if we may be allowed the expression--being anxious to assist his sister in making the hut comfortable.  As he walked along, his active mind ran riot in many eccentric channels. Those who take any interest in the study of mind, know that it is not only the mind of a romantic boy that does this, but that the mind of man generally is, when left to itself, the veriest acrobat, the most unaccountable harlequin, that ever leaped across the stage of fancy.  Roy's mind was now in the clouds, now on the earth.  Anon it was away in the far-off wilderness, or scampering through the settlements, and presently it was deep down in Silver Lake playing with the fish.  Roy himself muttered a word or so, now and then, as he walked along, which gave indication of the whereabouts of his mind at the time.  \"Capital fun,\" said he, \"only it won't do to stay too long.  Poor mother, how she'll be wearin' for us!  Hallo! ducks, you're noisy coons, wonder why you get up with such a bang.  Bang! that reminds me of the gun.  No more banging of you, old chap, if my hand keeps in so well with the bow.  Eh! duck, what's wrong?\"  This latter question was addressed to a small duck which seemed in an anxious state of mind, to judge from its motions.  Presently a head, as if of a fish, broke the surface of the lake, and the duck disappeared!  \"Oh the villain,\" exclaimed Roy, \"a fish has bolted him!\"  After this the lad walked on in silence, looking at the ground, and evidently pondering deeply.  \"Nelly,\" said he, entering the hut and throwing the grouse at her feet, \"here is dinner, supper, and breakfast for you, and please get the first ready as fast as you can, for I'm famishing.\"  \"Oh, how nice! how did you get them?\"  \"I'll tell you presently, but my head's full of a notion about catching ducks just now.\"  \"Catching ducks, Roy, what is the notion?\"  \"Never mind, Nelly, I han't scratched it out o' my brain yet, but I'll tell 'ee after dinner, and we'll try the plan to-morrow mornin'.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.
