Meanwhile the mate, who was accustomed to his captain's habits, and needed no instructions, had caused the sailors to lay their shields and swords out of sight at their feet, so that they might approach the pirates in the character of simple traders who were completely cowed by the appearance of the foe.  To increase this aspect of fear, the sail was lowered as they drew near, and the oars were used to complete the distance that yet intervened between the two vessels.  This humble and submissive approach did not, however, throw the pirates quite off their guard.  They stood to their arms and prepared to spring on board their victim when close enough.  As the pirate vessel lay motionless on the water she presented her broadside to the trader.  The captain took care to steer so that this relative position should be maintained.  The pirate chief, a huge man in rude armour, with a breast-plate of thick bull-hide and a shield of the same on his left arm, gave orders to pull the oars on one side of his vessel so that the two might be brought alongside.  They were about fifty yards apart at the moment.  Before the order could be carried into effect, however, Arkal uttered a low hiss.  Instantly the double banks of oars bent almost to the breaking point, and the _Penelope_ leaped forward like a sentient creature.  Each man seized sword and shield and sprang up, and Bladud, forgetting both helmet and shield in the hurry of the moment, poised the mighty javelin which had so astonished its owner's enemies in days gone by, and in another moment hurled it shrieking through the air.  It flew straight as a thunderbolt at the pirate chief; pierced through shield and breastplate, and came out at his back, sending him headlong into the arms of his horrified crew.  The whole incident was so sudden that the pirates had scarcely time to recover from their surprise when the bow of the _Penelope_ crashed into the side of their vessel and stove it in, for the trader, like some of the war-vessels of the period, was provided with a ram for this very purpose.  As the _Penelope_ recoiled from the shock, a yell of rage burst from the pirates, and a volley of javelins and stones followed, but, owing to the confusion resulting from the shock, these were ill-directed, and such of them as found their mark were caught on the shields.  Before another discharge could be made, the pirate vessel heeled over and sank, leaving her crew of miscreants struggling in the sea.  Some of them--being, strange to say, unable to swim--were drowned.  Others were killed in the water, while a few, taking their swords in their teeth, swam to the trader and made desperate attempts to climb on board.  Of course they failed, and in a few minutes nothing remained of the pirate vessel to tell of the tragedy that had been enacted, except an oar or two and a few spars left floating on the sea.  \"Would that all the sea-robbers in these parts could be as easily and thoroughly disposed of,\" remarked the captain, as he gave orders to re-hoist the sail.  \"Ho!  Bladud, my worthy prince, come aft here.  What detains you?\"  But Bladud did not answer to the call.  A stone from the enemy had fallen on his defenceless head and knocked him down insensible.  Four of the men now raised him up.  As they did so, one of the men--the small seaman, Maikar--was found underneath him in a state of semi-consciousness.  While they carried Bladud aft, the little sailor began to gasp and sneeze.  \"Not killed, I see,\" remarked the mate, looking into his face with some anxiety.  \"No, not quite,\" sighed Maikar, drawing a long breath, and raising himself on one elbow, with a slightly dazed look, \"but I never was so nearly burst in all my life.  If an ox had fallen on me he could not have squeezed me flatter.  Do, two of you, squeeze me the other way, to open me out a little; there's no room in me left to breathe--scarcely room to think.\"  \"Oh! your battles are not yet over, I see,\" said the mate, going off to the stern of the vessel, where he found Bladud just recovering consciousness and smiling at the remarks of the captain, who busied himself in stanching the wound, just over his frontal bone, from which blood was flowing freely.  \"H'm! this comes of sheer recklessness.  I told you to take off your helmet, but I did not tell you to keep it off.  Man, you launched that javelin well!--better than I could have done it myself.  Indeed, I doubt if my old grandfather could have done it with such telling effect-- straight through and through.  I saw full a hand-breadth come out at the villain's back.  What say you, mate?  Little Maikar wounded?\"  \"No, not wounded, but nearly burst, as he says himself; and no wonder, for Bladud fell upon him.\"  \"Didn't I tell you, mate,\" said the captain, looking up with a grin, \"that nothing will kill little Maikar?  Go to, man, you pretend to be a judge of men; yet you grumbled at me for engaging him as one of our crew.  Do you feel better now, prince?\"  \"Ay, greatly better, thank you,\" replied Bladud, putting his hand gently on the bandages with which the captain had skilfully bound his head.  \"That is well.  I think, now, that food will do you service.  What say you?\"  \"Nay, with your leave, I prefer sleep,\" said the prince, stretching himself out on the deck.  \"A little rest will suffice, for my head is noted for its thickness, and my brain for its solidity--at least so my good father was wont to say; and I've always had great respect for his opinion.\"  \"Ah, save when it ran counter to your own,\" suggested Arkal; \"and especially that time when you ran away from home and came out here in the long ship of my trading friend.\"  \"I have regretted that many a time since then, and I am now returning home to offer submission.\"  \"D'you think that he'll forgive you?\"  \"I am sure he will, for he is a kind man; and I know he loves me, though he has never said so.\"  \"I should like to know that father of yours.  I like your description of him--so stern of face, yet so kind of heart, and with such an unchangeable will when he sees what is right.  But what _is_ right, and what is wrong?\"  \"Ay--what is--who can tell?  Some people believe that the gods make their will known to man through the Delphic Oracle.\"  \"Boh!\" exclaimed the captain with a look of supreme contempt.  The turn of thought silenced both speakers for a time; and when Captain Arkal turned to resume the conversation, he found that his friend was sound asleep.  CHAPTER THREE.  ON THE VOYAGE.  Weather has always been, and, we suppose, always will be, capricious. Its uncertainty of character--in the Levant, as in the Atlantic, in days of old as now, was always the same--smiling to-day; frowning to-morrow; playful as a lamb one day; raging like a lion the next.  After the rough handling experienced by the _Penelope_ at the beginning of her voyage, rude Boreas kindly retired, and spicy breezes from Africa rippled the sea with just sufficient force to intensify its heavenly blue, and fill out the great square-sail so that there was no occasion to ply the oars.  One dark, starlight but moonless night, a time of quiet talk prevailed from stem to stern of the vessel as the grizzled mariners spun long yarns of their prowess and experiences on the deep, for the benefit of awe-stricken and youthful shipmates whose careers were only commencing.  \"You've heard, no doubt, of the great sea-serpent?\" observed little Maikar, who had speedily recovered from the flattening to which Bladud had subjected him, and was busy enlivening a knot of young fellows in the bow of the ship.  \"Of course we have!\" cried one; \"father used to tell me about it when I was but a small boy.  He never saw it himself, though he had been to the Tin Isles and Albion more than once; but he said he had met with men who had spoken with shipmates who had heard of it from men who had seen it only a few days before, and who described it exactly.\"  \"Ah!\" remarked another, \"but I have met a man who had seen it himself on his first voyage, when he was quite a youth; and he said it had a bull's head and horns, with a dreadful long body all over scales, and something like an ass's tail at the end.\"  \"Pooh!--nonsense!\" exclaimed little Maikar, twirling his thumbs, for smoking had not been introduced into the world at that period--and thumb-twirling would seem to have served the ancient world for leisurely pastime quite as well, if not better--at least we are led to infer so from the fact that Herodotus makes no mention of anything like a vague, mysterious sensation of unsatisfied desire to fill the mouth with smoke in those early ages, which he would certainly have done had the taste for smoke been a natural craving, and thumb-twirling an unsatisfactory occupation.  This absolute silence of the \"Father of History,\" we think, almost proves our point.  \"Nonsense!\" repeated little Maikar.  \"The youth of the man who told you about the serpent accounts for his wild description, for youth is prone to strange imaginings and--\"  \"It seems to me,\" interrupted a grave man, who twirled his thumbs in that slow, deliberate way in which a contemplative man smokes--\"it seems to me that there's no more truth about the great sea-serpent than there is about the golden fleece.  I don't believe in either of them.\"  \"Don't you?  Well, all I can say is,\" returned the little man, gazing fixedly in the grave comrade's face, \"that I saw the great sea-serpent with my own eyes!\"  \"No! did you?\" exclaimed the group, drawing their heads closer together with looks of expectancy.  \"Ay, that did I, mates; but you mustn't expect wild descriptions about monsters with bulls' horns and asses' tails from me.  I like truth, and the truth is, that the brute was so far away at the time we saw it, that not a man of us could tell exactly what it was like, and when we tried the description, we were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21757"],["title","The Hot Swamp (#3)"],["body"," so different, that we gave it up; but we were all agreed on this point, that it certainly _was_ the serpent.\"  The listeners seemed rather disappointed at this meagre account and sudden conclusion of what had bidden fair to become a stirring tale of the sea; but Maikar re-aroused their expectations by stating his firm belief that it was all nonsense about there being only one sea-serpent.  \"Why, how could there be only one?\" he demanded, ceasing to twirl, in order that he might clench his fist and smite his knee with emphasis. \"Haven't you got a grandfather?\" he asked, turning suddenly to the grave man.  \"Certainly, I've got two of them if you come to that,\" he answered, taken rather aback by the brusque and apparently irrelevant nature of the question.  \"Just so--two of them,\" repeated the little man, \"and don't you think it likely that the sea serpent must have had two grandfathers also?\"  \"Undoubtedly--and two grandmothers as well.  Perhaps he's got them yet,\" replied the grave man with a contemplative look over the side, where the rippling sea gleamed with phosphoric brilliancy.  \"Exactly so,\" continued Maikar in an eager tone, \"and of course these also must have had two grandfathers besides a mother each, and it is more than likely that the great sea-serpent himself is the father of a large family.\"  \"Which implies a wife,\" suggested one of the seamen.  \"Not necessarily,\" objected an elderly seaman, who had once been to the lands lying far to the north of Albion, and had acquired something of that tendency to object to everything at all times which is said to characterise the people of the far North.  \"Not necessarily,\" he repeated, \"for the serpent may be a bachelor with no family at all.\"  There was a short laugh at this, and an illogical man of the group made some irrelevant observation which led the conversation into a totally different channel, and relegated the great sea-serpent, for the time being, to oblivion!  While the men were thus engaged philosophising in the bow, Bladud and the captain were chatting in subdued voices in the stern.  \"It is impossible,\" said the latter, in reply to a remark made by the former, \"it is impossible for me to visit your father's court this year, though it would please me much to do so, but my cargo is intended for the south-western Cassiterides.  To get round to the river on the banks of which your home stands would oblige me to run far towards the cold regions, into waters which I have not yet visited--though I know them pretty well by hearsay.  On another voyage I may accomplish it, but not on this one.\"  \"I am sorry for that, Arkal, because things that are put off to another time are often put off altogether.  But the men of the Tin Isles often visit my father's town in their boats with copper and tin, and there are tracks through the forest which horses can traverse.  Could you not visit us overland?  It would not be a journey of many weeks, and your trusty mate might look after the ship in your absence.  Besides, the diggers may not have enough of the metal ready to fill your ship, so you may be idle a long time.  What say you?\"  Captain Arkal frowned, as was his wont when considering a knotty question, and shook his head.  \"I doubt if I should be wise to venture so much,\" he said; \"moreover, we are not yet at the end of our voyage.  It is of little use troubling one's-self about the end of anything while we are only at the beginning.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" rejoined Bladud, \"to consider the possible end while yet at the beginning, seems not unreasonable, though, undoubtedly, we may never reach the end.  Many a fair ship sets sail and never returns.\"  \"Ay, that is true, as I know to my cost,\" returned the captain, \"for this is not my first venture.  A long time ago I loaded a ship about the size of this one, and sent her under command of one of my best friends to the Euxine sea for gold.  I now think that that old story about Jason and his ship _Argo_ sailing in search of the golden fleece was running too strong in my youthful brain.  Besides that, of course I had heard the report that there is much gold in that direction, and my hopes were strong, for you know all the world runs after gold.  Anyhow, my ship sailed and I never saw her or my friend again.  Since then I have contented myself with copper and tin.\"  A slight increase in the wind at that moment caused the captain to dismiss his golden and other memories, and look inquiringly to windward.  \"A squall, methinks?\" said Bladud.  \"No, only a puff,\" replied his friend, ordering the steersman to alter the course a little.  The squall or puff was only strong enough to cause the _Penelope_ to make a graceful bow to the controlling element and cleave the sparkling water with her prow so swiftly that she left a gleaming wake as of lambent fire astern.  It was short-lived, however, and was followed by a calm which obliged little Maikar and his comrades to cease their story-telling and ply their fifty oars.  Thus the pace was kept going, though not quite so swiftly as if they were running before a stiff breeze.  \"The gods are propitious,\" said the captain; \"we are going to have a prosperous voyage.\"  \"How many gods are propitious?\" asked Bladud.  \"That is a question much too deep for me to answer.\"  \"But not too deep to think of--is it?\"  \"Of what use would be my thinking?\" returned the captain, lightly.  \"I leave such matters to the learned.\"  \"Now, mate,\" he added, turning to his subordinate, \"I'm going to rest a while.  See that you keep an open eye for squalls and pirates.  Both are apt to come down on you when you least expect them.\"  But neither squalls nor pirates were destined to interfere with the _Penelope_ during the greater part of that voyage.  Day after day the skies were clear, the sea comparatively smooth, and the winds favourable.  Sometimes they put ashore, when the weather became stormy and circumstances were favourable.  On such occasions they lighted camp-fires under the trees, the ruddy light of which glowed with a grand effect on the picturesque sailors as they sat, stood, or reclined around them.  At other times they were obliged to keep more in the open sea, and occasionally met with traders like themselves returning home, with whom, of course, they were glad to fraternise for a time and exchange views.  Once only did they meet with anything like a piratical vessel, but as that happened to be late in the evening, they managed, by plying the oars vigorously, and under the shade of night, to escape a second encounter with those robbers of the sea.  Thus, in course of time, the length of the great inland sea was traversed, the southern coast of what is now known as France was reached, and the captain's prophecy with regard to a prosperous voyage was thus far fulfilled.  CHAPTER FOUR.  THE STORM AND WRECK.  It was near daybreak on the morning of a night of unclouded splendour when the mate of the _Penelope_ aroused his chief with the information that appearances to windward betokened a change of some sort in the weather.  \"If there is a change at all it must be for the worse,\" said Arkal, raising himself on one elbow, rubbing his eyes, yawning, and then casting a glance over the side where the rippling foam told that the wind was increasing.  Raising his eyes to the windward horizon, he threw aside the sheepskin blanket that covered him and rose up quickly.  \"There is indeed a change coming.  Rouse the men and reduce the sail, mate.  Bestir you!  The squalls are sudden here.\"  The orders were obeyed with promptitude.  In a few minutes the sail was reduced to its smallest size, and all loose articles about the vessel were made fast.  \"You expect a gale, captain?\" asked Bladud, who was aroused by the noise of the preparations.  \"Ay--or something like one.  When a cloud like that rises up on the horizon there is usually something more than a puff coming.  You had better keep well under the lee of the bulwarks when it strikes us.\"  Bladud's nautical experience had already taught him what to expect and how to act in the circumstance that threatened.  Standing close to the side of the ship, he laid hold of a stanchion and looked out to windward, as most of the crew were by that time doing.  Captain Arkal himself took the helm.  The increasing daylight showed them that the bank of cloud was spreading quickly over the sky towards the zenith, while a soft hissing sound told of the approaching wind.  Soon the blackness on the sea intensified, and white gleams as of flashing light showed where the waves were torn into foam by the rushing wind.  With a warning to \"hold on fast!\" the captain turned the vessel's head so as to meet the blast.  So fierce was it that it cut off the crests of the wavelets, blowing the sea almost flat for a time, and producing what is known as a white squall.  The sail was kept fluttering until the fury of the onset was over, then the wind was allowed to fill it; the _Penelope_ bent down until the sea began to bubble over the lee bulwarks, and in a few moments more she was springing over the fast rising waves like a nautical racehorse.  Every moment the gale increased, obliging the mariners to show but a corner of the sail.  Even this had at last to be taken in, and, during the whole of that dismal day and of the black night which followed, the _Penelope_ drove helplessly before the wind under a bare pole. Fortunately the gale was favourable, so that they were enabled to lay their course, but it required all the skill and seamanship of Captain Arkal to prevent their being pooped and swamped by the waves that rolled hissing after them as if hungering mightily to swallow them up.  To have the right man in the right place at such times of imminent danger is all-important, not only to the safety of the craft, but to the peace of mind of those whose lives are in jeopardy.  All on board the little vessel during that hurricane felt much comforted by the knowledge that their captain was"]]]
