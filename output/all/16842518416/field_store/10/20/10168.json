For some time he lay there in a state of half-consciousness until his strength began to revive; then he arose, thanking God in an audible voice as he did so, and carried the child to a spot which was sheltered in some degree by a mass of cliff from the blinding spray and furious gale.  Here he laid her with her face downwards on a grassy place, and proceeded to warm his benumbed frame.  Vitality was strong in the sailor.  It needed only a few seconds' working of the human machine to call it into full play.  He squeezed the water out of his jacket and trousers, and then slapped his arms across his chest with extreme violence, stamping his feet the while, so that he was speedily in a sufficiently restored condition to devote his attention with effect to the child, which still lay motionless on the grass.  He wrung the water out of her clothes, and chafed her feet, hands, and limbs, rapidly yet tenderly, but without success.  His anxiety while thus employed was very great; for he did not know the proper method to adopt in the circumstances, and he felt that if the child did not revive within a few minutes, all chance of her recovery would be gone.  The energy of his action and the anxiety of his mind had warmed his own frame into a glow.  It suddenly occurred to him that he might make use of this superabundant heat.  Opening the little frock in front, he placed the child's breast against his own, and held it there, while with his right hand he continued to chafe her limbs.  In a few minutes he felt a flutter of the heart, then a gentle sigh escaped from the blue lips; the eyelids quivered, and finally the child revived.  \"D'ye feel gettin' better, Emmie?\" said the man, in a low, soft voice.  A faint \"yes\" was all the reply.  The seaman continued his efforts to instil warmth into the little frame. Presently the same question was repeated, and the child looking up, said--  \"Is that 'oo, Gaff?\"  \"Ay, dear, 'tis me.\"  \"Where am I--where's mamma?\" inquired Emmie, looking round in some degree of alarm.  \"Hush, dear; don't speak just now.  I've just brought 'ee ashore fro' the wreck, an' am goin' to tak 'ee home.  Try to sleep, dear.\"  Gaff wrapped his jacket round the child, and hurried away in search of the highroad.  He knew the place well.  He had been wrecked on a reef within two miles of his native hamlet, and within three of the town of Wreckumoft.  He soon found the road, and broke from a fast walk into a run.  The child lay quietly in his arms, either being too much exhausted to speak, or having fallen asleep.  The man muttered to himself as if in perplexity--  \"It'll never do to tak 'er home wi' me.  She'd remember us, and that would let the secret out.  No, I'll tak 'er straight there.\"  Gaff reached his native village as he came to this resolve.  It was all astir.  Three ships had been cast on the rocks there within a hundred yards of each other.  The lifeboat was out; the rocket apparatus had that moment arrived from the neighbouring town, and was being dragged on its waggon through the village to the scene of danger.  All the men, and many of the women and children of the place, were on the beach, while eager groups of those who could not face the storm were collected in doorways and sheltered places, awaiting news from the shore.  Many of these had anxious faces, for they knew their kinsmen, the fishermen of the place, to be bold, daring fellows, who would not hesitate to risk life and limb to save a fellow-creature from death.  Stopping a moment at the outskirts of the village, Gaff laid down his burden, and tied a large blue cotton kerchief round his neck, so as to cover his mouth and chin.  By pulling his sou'wester cap well over his eyes, he concealed his face so effectually that little more than the point of his nose was visible.  Not satisfied, however, with his disguise, he climbed a fence and struck into a bypath, which enabled him to avoid the village altogether.  Setting off at a quick pace, he soon regained the highroad beyond the village, and did not pause until he came to a large iron gate which opened into the shrubbery in front of a handsome villa.  He went straight up to the front door and rang the bell.  Of course, at such an hour, the family had retired to rest, and it is probable that in ordinary circumstances Gaff would have had to wait a considerable time before an answer should have been given to his summons.  But on this night, the only son and heir of the family, Kenneth by name, knowing that wrecks were likely to occur on the coast, and being of a bold, romantic, restless disposition, had mounted his horse and ridden away, accompanied by his groom, in search of adventure.  The housekeeper of the family, usually styled Mrs Niven, being devotedly attached to this son and heir, had resolved to sit up all night and await his return.  Mrs Niven had prophesied confidently for the previous ten years, that \"Master Kenneth was certain to be drownded sooner or later, if 'e didn't come to die before;\" and being fully persuaded of the truth of her prophetic powers, she conscientiously waited for and expected the fulfilment of her own prophecy.  At the moment when Gaff rang the bell she was awaiting it in a chair in front of a good fire, with her feet on the fender and sound asleep.  It would be more correct to say that Mrs Niven was in a state of mixed sleep and suffocation, for her head hung over the back of the chair, and, being very stout, there was only just sufficient opening in the wind-pipe to permit of her breath passing stertorously through her wide-open mouth.  The first summons passed unheard; the second caused Mrs Niven to open her eyes and shut her mouth, but she could not rise by reason of a crick in her neck.  An angry shout, however, of \"why don't you answer the bell?\" from the master of the family, caused her to make a violent struggle, plunge her head into her lap, by way of counteracting the crick, rush up-stairs, and fling open the door.  \"I know'd it,\" exclaimed Mrs Niven wildly, on beholding a wet sailor with a bundle in his arms; \"I always said he would be--goodness me! it's only his trunk,\" she added in horror, on observing that the bundle was a rough jacket without head or legs!  \"Clap a stopper on your jaw, woman,\" said Gaff impatiently.  \"Is this Seaside Villa--Mr Stuart's?\"  \"It is,\" replied Mrs Niven, trembling violently.  Gaff quickly removed the jacket, kissed the child's pale cheek, and laid her in Mrs Niven's ready arms.  \"She ain't dead surely, sir?\" inquired the housekeeper.  \"No, bin saved from a wreck an' half drownded!  She'll come to in a bit--tak' care of 'er.\"  Gaff turned on his heel as he hastily uttered these words, ran down the garden walk and disappeared, leaving Mrs Niven standing at the open door in a state of speechless amazement, with the unconscious Emmie in her arms and pressed, by reason of an irresistible impulse of motherly sympathy, to her bosom.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE COTTAGE AT COVE INVADED--DAN HORSEY SPEAKS \"TOORKO\" TO RUSSIANS, AND FAILS TO ENLIGHTEN THEM.  Retracing his steps hastily to the village of Cove, Stephen Gaff sought out his own humble cottage, which, during his absence on his frequent voyages, was left under the charge of his fisherman brother-in-law, John Furby.  Presenting himself at the door, he created the family sensation which has been described at the end of the first chapter.  The first violent demonstrations of surprise and joy over, Mrs Gaff dragged her husband into a small closet, which was regarded by the household in the light of a spare room, and there compelled him to change his garments.  While this change was being made the volatile Bu'ster, indignant at being bolted out, kicked the door with his heel until he became convinced that no good or evil could result from the process.  Then his active mind reverted to the forbidden loaf, and he forthwith drew a chair below the shelf on which it lay.  Upon the chair he placed a three-legged stool, and upon the stool an eight-inch block, which latter being an unstable foundation, caused Billy to lose his balance when he got upon it.  The erection instantly gave way, and fell with a hideous crash.  Tottie, who stood near, gazing at her brother's misdeeds, as was her wont, in awe-stricken admiration, was overwhelmed in the debris.  Nothing daunted, the Bu'ster \"returned to the charge,\" and fell a second time,--with the loaf, however, in his arms.  \"Hah!\" exclaimed Mrs Gaff, issuing from the spare room, and rushing at her offspring with uplifted hand.  \"Stop, lass,\" said Stephen, arresting her, and catching up the boy, whom he placed on his knee as he sat down in a chair beside the fire.  \"How are 'ee, Billy, my lad?\"  Billy, glaring defiance at his mother, who returned the glare with interest in the shape of a united shake of the fist and head, replied that he was \"fuss'rate.\"  Tottie having immediately claimed, and been put in possession of the other knee, divided her father's attention, and while the goodwife busied herself in preparing the supper, which had been originally intended for \"Uncle John,\" a quick fire of question and reply of the most varied and unconnected sort was kept up by the trio at the fire, in tones, and accompanied by hugs and gestures, which proved beyond all doubt that Stephen Gaff was a father of the right kind, and that the little ones hailed him as an inestimable addition to their household joys.  It would be unjust to Mrs Gaff were I to permit the reader to suppose that she was a disagreeable contrast to the father.  She was true-hearted and loving, but she had been born and bred in the midst of a class of people whose manners are as rough as their calling, and was by no means tender or considerate.  A terrific scream, or a knock-down slap, from Mrs Gaff, was regarded both by giver and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21702"],["title","Shifting Winds: A Tough Yarn (#3)"],["body","in much the same light as is a mild reproof in more polite society.  \"Wrecked again, Stephen,\" said Mrs Gaff, pausing in her occupation, and recurring to the remark made by her husband when he first entered the room, \"where have 'ee bin wrecked this time?\"  \"A'most at the door, lass, on the Black Rock.\"  \"Ay, an' was all the rest saved?\" inquired the wife.  \"No, none of 'em.  A' lost save one, a little child.\"  \"A child, lad!\" exclaimed the wife in surprise; \"what have 'ee done wi' it?\"  \"Took it to its friends.\"  As he said this the sailor gave his wife a look which induced her to refrain from further questioning on that subject.  \"An' who saved ye, Stephen?\"  \"God saved me,\" replied the man, earnestly.  \"True, lad; but was there none o' the boys there to lend a hand?\"  \"No, none.  It puzzled me a bit,\" said Stephen, \"for the lads are wont to be on the look-out on a night like this.\"  \"It needn't puzzle ye, then,\" replied the wife, as she set a chair for her husband at the table, and poured out a cup of tea, \"for there's bin two sloops an' a schooner on the rocks off the pier-head for three hours past, an' a' the lads are out at them,--Uncle John among the rest. They've made him coxswain o' the new lifeboat since ye last went to sea.\"  Stephen set down the cup, which he had just raised to his lips, untasted, and rose hastily.  \"Wrecks at the pier-head, lass,\" he exclaimed, \"and you let me sit here idle!\"  \"Don't go, Stephen,\" entreated Mrs Gaff; \"you're not fit to do anything after sitch a night, an' its o'er late.\"  The man paid no attention to the remonstrance, but buttoned up his coat, and seized his cap.  Mrs Gaff promptly locked the door with an air of thorough determination, put the key in her bosom, and crossed her arms thereon tightly.  Stephen smiled slightly as he turned, raised the window, and leaped through it into the road, followed by a vociferous cheer from Billy, whose spirit was wildly stirred by the boldness and success of the movement, and mightily rejoiced at the discomfiture of his mother.  Mrs Gaff relieved her feelings by slapping the Bu'ster's face, and was about to close the window when her husband quietly stepped through it again, saying--  \"Open the door, lass, you've no need to fear; I'll remain now.\"  There was a trampling of many feet outside.  The door had scarcely been unlocked when they were in the passage.  Next moment four fishermen entered, bearing the figure of a man in their arms.  \"He an't drownded, lass, only swownded,\" said one of the men to Mrs Gaff, with the view of relieving the good woman's anxiety, as they laid a seaman on the bed.  \"Look alive now, old girl, an' git hot blankets an' bottles.\"  While Mrs Gaff obeyed in silent haste, the room was filled with men, some of whom supported or half-carried others, whose drooping heads, torn garments, and haggard faces, showed that they had just been rescued from the angry sea.  None of them were more than partially clothed; some were nearly naked.  With excited haste the fishermen crowded the wrecked men round the fire, and spread blankets and sails, or whatever came first to hand, on the floor for those who were most exhausted to lie down upon, while Stephen Gaff poured hot tea and hot grog indiscriminately into cups, saucers, pannikins, and soup-plates, and urged them to drink with rough but kindly hospitality.  The wrecked men, (there were twelve of them), were Russians, and as a matter of course could not understand a word that was said to them, although some of the fishermen asked them, with as much earnestness as if their lives depended on the answer, \"Who--they--wos--an'--whar'-- they--com'd--fro'?\"  Receiving for reply a stare and a shake of the head from such of the men as were able to attend, one of the fishermen tried them again with great precision and slowness of speech, and with much solemnity of manner, \"What--part--o' the arth--d'ye hail fro',--lads?\"  No answer, accompanied by a stare and a shake.  \"Oh, it's o' no use,\" cried one, \"let the poor lads a-be.\"  \"Hallo!  Dan,\" cried another, as a man forced his way through the crowded room towards the fire, \"you've bin in Toorkey, I believe; I say, try them fellers wi' a screed o' Toorko.  P'raps they'll make _that_ out.\"  The individual addressed was very different from the men amongst whom he stood.  He was a thin, slightly-made, yet strong and active young man, in a very short grey coat, a very long striped vest, and very tight corduroy trousers--a sort of compound of footman and jockey.  In truth, Daniel Horsey was both; being at once valet and groom to the romantic Kenneth, whose fate it was, (according to the infallible Mrs Niven), to be \"drownded.\"  Dan's first inquiry was as to whether any one had seen his master, and the tones in which the question was put betokened him, beyond all doubt, a son of the Green Isle.  Being told that no one had seen his master, he was about to leave the hut in quest of him when he was collared by several stout men, and placed forcibly in front of a Russian with a huge red beard, who appeared to be the least exhausted of the party.  \"Come now, Dan, say somethin' to them Roosians.\"  \"Arrah! d'ye think I'll spake a word av ye stick yer great ugly fists into my jooglar veins like that?  Hands off,\" he cried indignantly, \"or niver a taste o' spaitch ye'll git from me, bad or good.  Besides, what duv _I_ know about Roosian?\"  \"Ye've bin in Toorkey, han't ye?\" inquired a fisherman.  \"Troth I have, an' what o' that?\" replied Dan, as his captors released their hold of his collar.  \"Ye can speak Toorko, can't ye?\"  \"Maybe I can,\" he replied cautiously.  \"Well, I'm told that Toorkey lies to the suthard o' Roosia, just as England lies to the suthard o' Scotland, an' so, mayhap, they'll understand a bit Toorko.\"  \"Faix, av they don't understand Thoorko better nor the English understand Scotch, it's little speed I'll come wi' them,\" said Dan with a leer.  \"Howsomediver, I'll give 'em a trial.  I say, Mr Red-beard, hubba doorum bobble moti squorum howko joski tearum thaddi whak?  Come, now, avic, let's hear what ye've got to say to that.  An' mind what ye spake, 'cause we won't stand no blarney here.\"  Dan uttered this with immense volubility and assurance, and the fishermen regarded him with deepening respect, as they awaited the Russian's answer.  He replied by a stare and a shake of the head as before.  \"Hookum daddy,\" resumed Dan, stooping to gaze earnestly into the man's face, and placing the thumb of his right hand into the palm of his left, by way of emphasising his remark, \"Hookum daddy, saringo spolli-jaker tooraloo be japers bang falairo--och!\" he added, turning away with a look of disgust, \"he don't understand a word.  I would try him wi' Frinch, but it's clear as ditch wather that he's half drownded still.\"  Convinced that Dan Horsey's \"Toorko\" was of no use, the fishermen at length allowed him to retire.    CHAPTER FOUR.  THE RESCUE.  While this scene was enacting in the cottage, I was hasting up from the beach, where the lifeboat men had rendered good service that night.  As the honorary agent for the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society, I had been summoned by a special messenger as soon as it was known that vessels were on the rocks off the entrance to our harbour.  I was accompanied by my niece, Lizzie Gordon, who always joined me on such occasions, carrying with her a basket in which were a flask of brandy, another of port wine, a bottle of smelling salts, and several small articles which she fancied might be of use in cases of emergency.  We had called at the Sailors' Home in passing, to see that they were astir there, and ready to receive shipwrecked people.  We afterwards remained on the beach, under the lee of a boathouse, while the lifeboat men saved the crews of the wrecked vessels.  The work was nobly done!  John Furby, the coxswain, with a sturdy crew of volunteers--twelve in all--were ready for action, with cork life-belts and oilskin coats on, when the team of four stout horses came tearing along the sands dragging the lifeboat after them, assisted and cheered on by a large crowd of men and boys.  No unnecessary delay occurred.  Opposite the first wreck, the carriage was wheeled round, so that the bow of the boat pointed to the sea.  The crew sprang into their seats, and, shipping the oars, sat ready and resolute.  Immense breakers thundered on the beach, and rushed inland in fields of gurgling foam that looked like phosphoric light in the darkness.  Into this the carriage was thrust as far as it could be with safety by many strong and willing hands.  Then the men in the surf seized the launching lines, by means of which the boat could be propelled off its carriage. A peculiar adaptation of the mechanism enabled them, by _pulling backward_, to force the boat _forward_.  For a moment they stood inactive as a towering wave rolled in like a great black scroll coming out of the blacker background, where the sound of the raging storm could be heard, but where nothing could be seen, save the pale red light which proved that the wreck still held together.  The sea flew up, almost overwhelming the carriage.  John Furby, standing at his post by the steering oar, with the light of the small boat-lamp shining up into his rugged face, gave the word in a clear, strong voice.  \"Hurrah!\" shouted the men on shore, as they ran up the beach with the ends of the launching ropes.  The boat sprang into the surf, the crew bent to their oars with all their might, and kept pace with the rush of the retreating billow, while the sea drew them out as if it were hungry to swallow them.  The lifeboat met the next breaker end-on; the men, pulling vigorously, cleft it, and, passing beyond, gained the deep water and disappeared from view.  The minutes that followed appeared like hours, but our patience was not long tried.  The boat soon re-appeared, coming in on the crest of a towering wave, with six saved seamen in her.  As she struck"]]]
