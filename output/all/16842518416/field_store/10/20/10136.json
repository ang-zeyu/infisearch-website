The place was so open that concealment was not possible.  The steeds of both men had somehow got rid of their hobbles and galloped away.  A feeling of despair came over the Indian at this discovery.  It was quickly followed by a stern resolve.  He was famed as being the fleetest and most enduring brave of his tribe.  He would _run_ home.  Without saying a word to his friend, he tightened his belt, and started off like a hound loosed from the leash.  Little Tim ran a few hundred yards after him at top speed, but suddenly pulled up.  \"Pooh!  It's useless,\" he exclaimed.  \"I might as well run after a streak o' greased lightnin'.  Well, well, women have much to answer for! Who'd iver have thowt to see Whitewing shook off his balance like that? It strikes me I'll sarve him best by lookin' after the nags.\"  While the trapper soliloquised thus he ran back to the camp to get one of the Indian horses, wherewith to go off in search of his own and that of his friend.  He found the Indians busy making preparations to ride to the rescue of their Bald Eagle allies; but quick though these sons of the prairie were, they proved too slow for Little Tim, who leaped on the first horse he could lay hold of, and galloped away.  Meanwhile Whitewing ran with the fleet, untiring step of a trained runner whose heart is in his work; but the way was long, and as evening advanced even his superior powers began to fail a little.  Still he held on, greatly overtaxing his strength.  Nothing could have been more injudicious in a prolonged race.  He began to suspect that it was unwise, when he came to a stretch of broken ground, which in the distance was traversed by a range of low hills.  As he reached these he reduced the pace a little, but while he was clambering up the face of a rather precipitous cliff, the thought of the Blackfoot band and of the much-loved one came into his mind; prudence went to the winds, and in a moment he was on the summit of the cliff, panting vehemently--so much so, indeed, that he felt it absolutely necessary to sit down for a few moments to rest.  While resting thus, with his back against a rock, in the attitude of one utterly worn out, part of the missionary's text flashed into his mind: \"the race that is set before us.\"  \"Surely,\" he murmured, looking up, \"this race is set before me.  The object is good.  It is my duty as well as my desire.\"  The thought gave an impulse to his feelings; the impulse sent his young blood careering, and, springing up, he continued to run as if the race had only just begun.  But ere long the pace again began to tell, producing a sinking of the heart, which tended to increase the evil. Hour after hour had passed without his making any perceptible abatement in the pace, and the night was now closing in.  This however mattered not, for the full moon was sailing in a clear sky, ready to relieve guard with the sun.  Again the thought recurred that he acted unwisely in thus pressing on beyond his powers, and once more he stopped and sat down.  This time the text could not be said to flash into his mind, for while running, it had never left him.  He now deliberately set himself to consider it, and the word \"patience\" arrested his attention.  \"Let us run with patience,\" he thought.  \"I have not been patient.  But the white man did not mean this kind of race at all; he said it was the whole race of life.  Well, if so, _this_ is part of that race, and it _is_ set before me.  Patience! patience!  I will try.\"  With childlike simplicity the red man rose and began to run slowly.  For some time he kept it up, but as his mind reverted to the object of his race his patience began to ooze out.  He could calculate pretty well the rate at which the Blackfoot foes would probably travel, and knowing the exact distance, perceived that it would be impossible for him to reach the camp before them, unless he ran all the way at full speed.  The very thought of this induced him to put on a spurt, which broke him down altogether.  Stumbling over a piece of rough ground, he fell with such violence that for a moment or two he lay stunned.  Soon, however, he was on his legs again, and tried to resume his headlong career, but felt that the attempt was useless.  With a deep irrepressible groan, he sank upon the turf.  It was in this hour of his extremity that the latter part of the preacher's text came to his mind: \"looking unto Jesus.\"  Poor Whitewing looked upwards, as if he half expected to see the Saviour with the bodily eye, and a mist seemed to be creeping over him.  He was roused from this semi-conscious state by the clattering of horses' hoofs.  The Blackfoot band at once occurred to his mind.  Starting up, he hid behind a piece of rock.  The sounds drew nearer, and presently he saw horsemen passing him at a considerable distance.  How many he could not make out.  There seemed to be very few.  The thought that it might be his friend the trapper occurred, but if he were to shout, and it should turn out to be foes, not only would his own fate but that of his tribe be sealed.  The case was desperate; still, anything was better than remaining helplessly where he was.  He uttered a sharp cry.  It was responded to at once in the voice of Little Tim, and next moment the faithful trapper galloped towards Whitewing leading his horse by the bridle.  \"Well, now, this is good luck,\" cried the trapper, as he rode up.  \"No,\" replied the Indian gravely, \"it is not _luck_.\"  \"Well, as to that, I don't much care what you call it--but get up.  Why, what's wrong wi' you?\"  \"The run has been very long, and I pressed forward impatiently, trusting too much to my own strength.  Let my friend help me to mount.\"  \"Well, now I come to think of it,\" said the trapper, as he sprang to the ground, \"you have come a tremendous way--a most awful long way--in an uncommon short time.  A fellow don't think o' that when he's mounted, ye see.  There now,\" he added, resuming his own seat in the saddle, \"off we go.  But there's no need to overdrive the cattle; we'll be there in good time, I warrant ye, for the nags are both good and fresh.\"  Little Tim spoke the simple truth, for his own horse which he had discovered along with that of his friend some time after parting from him, was a splendid animal, much more powerful and active than the ordinary Indian horses.  The steed of Whitewing was a half-wild creature of Spanish descent, from the plains of Mexico.  Nothing more was spoken after this.  The two horsemen rode steadily on side by side, proceeding with long but not too rapid strides over the ground: now descending into the hollows, or ascending the gentle undulations of the plains; anon turning out and in to avoid the rocks and ruts and rugged places; or sweeping to right or left to keep clear of clumps of stunted wood and thickets, but never for a moment drawing rein until the goal was reached, which happened very shortly before the break of day.  The riding was absolute rest to Whitewing, who recovered strength rapidly as they advanced.  \"There is neither sight nor sound of the foe here,\" murmured the Indian.  \"No, all safe!\" replied the trapper in a tone of satisfaction, as they cantered to the summit of one of the prairie waves, and beheld the wigwams of Bald Eagle shining peacefully in the moonlight on the plain below.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE SURPRISE AND COMBAT.  How frequently that \"slip 'twixt the cup and the lip\" is observed in the affairs of this life!  Little Tim, the trapper, had barely pronounced the words \"All safe,\" when an appalling yell rent the air, and a cloud of dark forms was seen to rush over the open space that lay between the wigwams of the old chief Bald Eagle and a thicket that grew on its westward side.  The Blackfoot band had taken the slumbering Indians completely by surprise, and Whitewing had the mortification of finding that he had arrived just a few minutes too late to warn his friends.  Although Bald Eagle was thus caught unprepared, he was not slow to meet the enemy. Before the latter had reached the village, all the fighting men were up, and armed with bows, scalping-knives, and tomahawks.  They had even time to rush towards the foe, and thus prevent the fight from commencing in the midst of the village.  The world is all too familiar with the scenes that ensued.  It is not our purpose to describe them.  We detest war, regarding it in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred as unnecessary.  Sufficient to say here that the overwhelming numbers of the Blackfoot Indians were too much for their enemies.  They soon began to overpower and drive them back towards the wigwams, where the poor women and children were huddled together in terror.  Before this point had arrived, however, Whitewing and Little Tim were galloping to the rescue.  The former knew at a glance that resistance on the part of his friends would be hopeless.  He did not therefore gallop straight down to the field of battle to join them, but, turning sharply aside with his friend, swept along one of the bottoms or hollows between the undulations of the plain, where their motions could not be seen as they sped along.  Whitewing looked anxiously at Little Tim, who, observing the look, said:--  \"I'm with 'ee, Whitewing, niver fear.\"  \"Does my brother know that we ride to death?\" asked the Indian in an earnest tone.  \"Yer brother don't know nothin' o' the sort,\" replied the trapper, \"and, considerin' your natur', I'd have expected ye to think that Manitou might have some hand in the matter.\"  \"The white man speaks wisely,\" returned the chief, accepting the reproof with a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21694"],["title","The Prairie Chief (#2)"],["body","look.  \"We go in His strength.\"  And once again the latter part of the preacher's text seemed to shoot through the Indian's brain like a flash of light--\"looking unto Jesus.\"  Whitewing was one of those men who are swift to conceive and prompt in action.  Tim knew that he had a plan of some sort in his head, and, having perfect faith in his capacity, forbore to advise him, or even to speak.  He merely drew his hunting-knife, and urged his steed to its utmost speed, for every moment of time was precious.  The said hunting-knife was one of which Little Tim was peculiarly fond.  It had been presented to him by a Mexican general for conspicuous gallantry in saving the life of one of his officers in circumstances of extreme danger.  It was unusually long and heavy, and, being double-edged, bore some resemblance to the short, sword of the ancient Romans.  \"It'll do some execution before I go down,\" thought Tim, as he regarded the bright blade with an earnest look.  But Tim was wrong.  The blade was not destined to be tarnished that day.  In a very few minutes the two horsemen galloped to the thicket which had concealed the enemy.  Entering this they dashed through it as fast as possible until they reached the other side, whence they could see the combatants on the plain beyond.  All along they had heard the shouts and yells of battle.  For one moment Whitewing drew up to breathe his gallant steed, but the animal was roused by that time, and it was difficult to restrain him. His companion's horse was also nearly unmanageable.  \"My brother's voice is strong.  Let him use it well,\" said the chief abruptly.  \"Ay, ay,\" replied the little trapper, with an intelligent chuckle; \"go ahead, my boy.  I'll give it out fit to bu'st the bellows.\"  Instantly Whitewing shot from the wood, like the panther rushing on his prey, uttering at the same time the tremendous war-cry of his tribe. Little Tim followed suit with a roar that was all but miraculous in its tone and character, and may be described as a compound of the steam-whistle and the buffalo bull, only with something about it intensely human.  It rose high above the din of battle.  The combatants heard and paused.  The two horsemen were seen careering towards them with furious gesticulations.  Red Indians seldom face certain death. The Blackfoot men knew that an attack by only two men would be sheer insanity; the natural conclusion was that they were the leaders of a band just about to emerge from the thicket.  They were thus taken in rear.  A panic seized them, which was intensified when Little Tim repeated his roar and flourished the instrument of death, which he styled his \"little carving-knife.\"  The Blackfeet turned and fled right and left, scattering over the plains individually and in small groups, as being the best way of baffling pursuit.  With that sudden access of courage which usually results from the exhibition of fear in a foe, Bald Eagle's men yelled and gave chase. Bald Eagle himself, however, had the wisdom to call them back.  At a council of war, hastily summoned on the spot, he said--  \"My braves, you are a parcel of fools.\"  Clearing his throat after this plain statement, either for the purpose of collecting his thoughts or giving his young warriors time to weigh and appreciate the compliment, he continued--  \"You chase the enemy as thoughtlessly as the north wind chases the leaves in autumn.  My wise chief Whitewing, and his friend Leetil Tim-- whose heart is big, and whose voice is bigger, and whose scalping-knife is biggest of all--have come to our rescue _alone_.  Whitewing tells me there is no one at their backs.  If our foes discover their mistake, they will turn again, and the contempt which they ought to pour on themselves because of their own cowardice they will heap on _our_ heads, and overwhelm us by their numbers--for who can withstand numbers?  They will scatter us like small dust before the hurricane.  Waugh!\"  The old man paused for breath, for the recent fight had taken a good deal out of him, and the assembled warriors exclaimed \"Waugh!\" by which they meant to express entire approval of his sentiments.  \"Now it is my counsel,\" he continued, \"that as we have been saved by Whitewing, we should all shut our mouths, and hear what Whitewing has got to say.\"  Bald Eagle sat down amid murmurs of applause, and Whitewing arose.  There was something unusually gentle in the tone and aspect of the young chief on this occasion.  \"Our father, the ancient one who has just spoken words of wisdom,\" he said, stretching forth his right hand, \"has told you the truth, yet not quite the truth.  He is right when he says that Leetil Tim and I have come to your rescue, but he is wrong when he says we come alone.  It is true that there are no men at our backs to help us, but is not Manitou behind us--in front--around?  It was Manitou who sent us here, and it was He who gave us the victory.\"  Whitewing paused, and there were some exclamations of approval, but they were not so numerous or so decided as he could have wished, for red men are equally unwilling with white men to attribute their successes directly to their Creator.  \"And now,\" he continued, \"as Bald Eagle has said, if our foes find out their mistake, they will, without doubt, return.  We must therefore take up our goods, our wives, and our little ones, and hasten to meet our brothers of Clearvale, who are even now on their way to help us.  Our band is too small to fight the Blackfeet, but united with our friends, and with Manitou on our side for our cause is just, we shall be more than a match, for them.  I counsel, then, that we raise the camp without delay.\"  The signs of approval were much more decided at the close of this brief address, and the old chief again rose up.  \"My braves,\" he said, \"have listened to the words of wisdom.  Let each warrior go to his wigwam and get ready.  We quit the camp when the sun stands there.\"  He printed to a spot in the sky where the sun would be shining about an hour after daybreak, which was already brightening the eastern sky.  As he spoke the dusky warriors seemed to melt from the scene as if by magic, and ere long the whole camp was busy packing up goods, catching horses, fastening on dogs little packages suited to their size and strength, and otherways making preparation for immediate departure.  \"Follow me,\" said Whitewing to Little Tim, as he turned like the rest to obey the orders of the old chief.  \"Ay, it's time to be lookin' after her,\" said Tim, with something like a wink of one eye, but the Indian was too much occupied with his own thoughts to observe the act or appreciate the allusion.  He strode swiftly through the camp.  \"Well, well,\" soliloquised the trapper as he followed, \"I niver did expect to see Whitewing in this state o' mind.  He's or'narily sitch a cool, unexcitable man.  Ah! women, you've much to answer for!\"  Having thus apostrophised the sex, he hurried on in silence, leaving his horse to the care of a youth, who also took charge of Whitewing's steed.  Close to the outskirts of the camp stood a wigwam somewhat apart from the rest.  It belonged to Whitewing.  Only two women were in it at the time the young Indian chief approached.  One was a good-looking young girl, whose most striking feature was her large, earnest-looking, dark eyes.  The other was a wrinkled old woman, who might have been any age between fifty and a hundred, for a life of exposure and hardship, coupled with a somewhat delicate constitution, had dried her up to such an extent that, when asleep, she might easily have passed for an Egyptian mummy.  One redeeming point in the poor old thing was the fact that all the deep wrinkles in her weather-worn and wigwam-smoked visage ran in the lines of kindliness.  Her loving character was clearly stamped upon her mahogany countenance, so that he who ran might easily read.  With the characteristic reserve of the red man, Whitewing merely gave the two women a slight look of recognition, which was returned with equal quietness by the young woman, but with a marked rippling of the wrinkles on the part of the old.  There still remained a touch of anxiety caused by the recent fight on both countenances.  It was dispelled, however, by a few words from Whitewing, who directed the younger woman to prepare for instant flight.  She acted with prompt, unquestioning obedience, and at the same time the Indian went to work to pack up his goods with all speech.  Of course Tim lent efficient aid to tie up the packs and prepare them for slinging on horse and dog.  \"I say, Whitewing,\" whispered Tim, touching the chief with his elbow, and glancing at the young woman with approval--for Tim, who was an affectionate fellow and anxious about his friend's welfare, rejoiced to observe that the girl was obedient and prompt as well as pretty--\"I say, is that her?\"  Whitewing looked with a puzzled expression at his friend.  \"Is that _her_--_the_ girl, you know?\" said Little Tim, with a series of looks and nods which were intended to convey worlds of deep meaning.  \"She is my sister--Brighteyes,\" replied the Indian quietly, as he continued his work.  \"Whew!\" whistled the trapper.  \"Well, well,\" he murmured in an undertone, \"you're on the wrong scent this time altogether, Tim.  Ye think yerself a mighty deal cliverer than ye are.  Niver mind, the one that he says he loves more nor life'll turn up soon enough, no doubt. But I'm real sorry for the old 'un,\" he added in an undertone, casting a glance of pity on the poor creature, who bent over the little fire in the middle of the tent, and gazed silently yet inquiringly at what was going on.  \"She'll niver be able to stand a flight like this.  The mere joltin' o' the nags 'ud shake her old bones a'most out of her skin. There are some Redskins now, that would leave her to starve, but Whitewing'll niver do that.  I know him better.  Now then\"--aloud--\"have ye anything more for me to do?\"  \"Let my brother help"]]]
