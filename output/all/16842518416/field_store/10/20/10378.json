There the retail trader squatted, smoked his pipe, and calmly awaited the decrees of Fate!  One of these small traders he noted particularly while his conductor stopped to converse with a friend.  He was an old man, evidently a descendant of Ishmael, and clothed in what seemed to be a ragged cast-off suit that had belonged to Abraham or Isaac.  He carried his shop on his arm in the shape of a basket, out of which he took a little bit of carpet, and spread it close to where they stood.  On this he sat down and slowly extracted from his basket, and spread on the ground before him, a couple of old locks, several knives, an old brass candlestick, an assortment of rusty keys, a flat-iron, and half a dozen other articles of household furniture.  Before any purchases were made, however, the janissary moved on, and Foster had to follow.  Passing through two or three tortuous and narrow lanes, which, however, were thickly studded with shops--that is, with holes in the wall, in which merchandise was displayed outside as well as in--they came to a door which was strictly guarded.  Passing the guards, they found themselves in a court, beyond which they could see another court which looked like a hall of justice--or injustice, as the case might be.  What strengthened Foster in the belief that such was its character, was the fact that, at the time they entered, an officer was sitting cross-legged on a bench, smoking comfortably, while in front of him a man lay on his face with his soles turned upwards, whilst an executioner was applying to them the punishment of the bastinado.  The culprit could not have been a great offender, for, after a sharp yell or two, he was allowed to rise and limp away.  Our hero was led before the functionary who looked like a judge.  He regarded the middy with no favour.  We should have recorded that Foster, when blown out to sea, as already described, had leaped on the pirate's deck without coat or vest.  As he was still in this dismantled condition, and had neither been washed nor combed since that event occurred, his appearance at this time was not prepossessing.  \"Who are you, and where do you come from?\" was the first question put by an interpreter.  Of course Foster told the exact truth about himself.  After he had done so, the judge and interpreter consulted together, glancing darkly at their prisoner the while.  Then the judge smiled significantly and nodded his head.  The interpreter turned to a couple of negroes who stood ready to execute any commands, apparently, and said a few words to them.  They at once took hold of Foster and fastened a rope to his wrist.  As they did so, the interpreter turned to the poor youth and said--  \"What you tell is all lies.\"  \"Indeed, indeed, it is not,\" exclaimed the midshipman fervently.  \"Go!\" said the interpreter.  A twitch from the rope at the same moment recalled our hero to his right mind; and the remembrance of the poor wretch who had just suffered the bastinado, and also of Peter the Great's oft-repeated reference to \"whacking,\" had the effect of crushing the spirit of rebellion which had just begun to arise in his breast.  Thus he was conducted ignominiously into the street and back to the market-square, where he was made to stand with a number of other men, who, like himself, appeared to be slaves.  For what they were there waiting he could not tell, but he was soon enlightened, as after half an hour, a dignified-looking Moor in flowing apparel came forward, examined one of the captives, felt his muscles, made him open his mouth, and otherwise show his paces, after which he paid a sum of money for him and a negro attendant led him away.  \"I'm to be sold as a slave,\" Foster involuntarily groaned aloud.  \"Like all the rest of us,\" growled a stout sailor-like man, who stood at his elbow.  Foster turned quickly to look at him, but a sudden movement in the group separated them after the first glance at each other.  By way of relieving his overcharged feelings he tried to interest himself in the passers-by.  This, however, he found very difficult, until he observed a sturdy young Cabyle coming along with two enormous feathery bundles suspended over his right shoulder, one hanging before, the other behind.  To his surprise these bundles turned out to be living fowls, tied by the legs and hanging with their heads down.  There could not, he thought, have been fewer than thirty or forty birds in each bundle, and it occurred to him at once that they had probably been carried to market thus from some distance in the country.  At all events, the young Cabyle seemed to be dusty and warm with walking.  He even seemed fatigued, for, when about to pass the group of slaves, he stopped to rest and flung down his load.  The shock of the fall must have snapped a number of legs, for a tremendous cackle burst from the bundles as they struck the ground.  This raised the thought in Foster's mind that he could hope for no mercy where such wanton cruelty was not even deemed worthy of notice by the bystanders; but the sound of a familiar voice put all other thoughts to flight.  \"Dis way, massa, you's sure to git fuss-rate fellers here.  We brought 'im in on'y yesterday--all fresh like new-laid eggs.\"  The speaker was Peter the Great.  The man to whom he spoke was a Moor of tall stature and of somewhat advanced years.  Delighted more than he could express, in his degraded and forlorn condition, at this unlooked-for meeting with his black friend, Foster was about to claim acquaintance, when the negro advanced to the group among whom he stood, exclaiming loudly--  \"Here dey am, massa, dis way.\"  Then turning suddenly on Foster with a fierce expression, he shouted, \"What you lookin' at, you babby-faced ijit?  Hab you nebber seen a handsome nigger before dat you look all t'under-struck of a heap?  Can't you hold your tongue, you chatterin' monkey?\" and with that, although Foster had not uttered a syllable, the negro fetched him a sounding smack on the cheek, to the great amusement of the bystanders.  Well was it then for our middy that it flashed into his mind that Peter the Great, being the most astounding \"hyperkrite\" on earth, was at work in his deceptive way, else would he have certainly retaliated and brought on himself swift punishment--for slaves were not permitted to resent injuries or create riots.  As it was, he cast down his eyes, flushed scarlet, and restrained himself.  \"Now, massa,\" continued the negro, turning to the fine, sailor-like man who had spoken to Foster a few minutes before, \"here's a nice-lookin' man.  Strong an' healfy--fit for anyt'ing no doubt.\"  \"Ask him if he understands gardening,\" said the Moor.  We may remark, in passing, that Peter the Great and his owner had a peculiar mode of carrying on conversation.  The latter addressed his slave in the Lingua Franca, while Peter replied in his own nigger English, which the Moor appeared to understand perfectly.  Why they carried it on thus we cannot explain, but it is our duty to record the fact.  \"Understand gardening!\" exclaimed the sailor, in supreme contempt, \"I should think not.  Wot d'you take me for, you black baboon!  Do I look like a gardener?  Ploughin' an' diggin' I knows nothin' about wotsomever, though I _have_ ploughed the waves many a day, an' I'm considered a fust-rate hand at diggin' into wittles.\"  \"Oh! massa, das de man for your money!  Buy him, quick!\" cried the negro, with a look of earnest entreaty at his master.  \"He say he's ploughed many a day, an''s a fuss-rate hand at diggin'.  _Do_ buy 'im!\"  But the Moor would not buy him.  Either he understood the sailor's language to some extent, or that inveterate obstinacy of which Peter had made mention as being part of his character was beginning to assert itself.  \"Ask this one what he knows about it,\" said the Moor, pointing to a thin young man, whose sprightly expression showed that he had not yet fully realised what fate was in store for him in the pirates' stronghold.  \"Wich is it you mean, massa, dis one?\" said Peter, purposely mistaking and turning to Foster.  \"Oh! you needn't ask about _him_.  He not wuff his salt.  I could tell him at a mile off for a lazy, useless feller. Gib more trouble dan he's wuff.  Dere now, dis looks a far better man,\" he added, laying hold of the thin sprightly youth and turning him round. \"What d'ye t'ink ob dis one?\"  \"I _told_ you to ask that one,\" replied the Moor sharply.  \"Can you do gardenin', you feller?\" asked Peter.  \"Oui, oui--un peu,\" replied the youth, who happened to be French, but understood English.  \"None ob your wee-wees an' poo-poos to me.  Can't you speak English?\"  \"Oui, yes, I gardin ver' leetle.\"  \"Jus' so.  Das de man for us, massa, if you won't hab de oder.  I likes de look ob 'im.  I don't t'ink he'll be hard on de wittles, an' he's so t'in dat he won't puspire much when he works in de sun in summer.  Do buy _him_, massa.\"  But \"massa\" would not buy him, and looked hard for some time at our hero.  \"I see how it am,\" said the negro, growing sulky.  \"You set your heart on dat useless ijit.  Do come away, massa, it 'ud break my heart to lib wid sich a feller.\"  This seemed to clinch the matter, for the Moor purchased the objectionable slave, ordered Peter the Great to bring him along, and left the market-place.  \"Didn't I tell you I's de greatest hyperkrite as ever was born?\" said Peter, in a low voice, when sufficiently far in rear to prevent being overheard by his master.  \"You certainly did,\" replied Foster, who felt something almost like satisfaction at this change in his fate; \"you are the most perfect hypocrite that I ever came across, and I am not sorry for it.  Only I hope you won't deceive your friends.\"  \"Honour bright!\" said the negro, with a roll of the eyes and a solemnity of expression that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21751"],["title","The Middy and the Moors: An Algerine Story (#6)"],["body","far more than words could express.  \"Can you tell me,\" asked the middy, as they walked along, \"what has become of that fine-looking girl that was captured with her father and mother by your captain?\"  \"Don't say _my_ captain, sar,\" replied Peter sternly.  \"He no captain ob mine.  I was on'y loaned to him.  But I knows nuffin ob de gall.  Bery likely she's de Dey's forty-second wife by dis time.  Hush! look sulky,\" he added quickly, observing that his master was looking back.  Poor Foster found himself under the necessity of following his black friend's lead, and acting the \"hyperkrite,\" in order to prevent their friendship being discovered.  He did it with a bad grace, it is true, but felt that, for his friend's sake if not his own, he was bound to comply.  So he put on an expression which his cheery face had not known since that period of infancy when his frequent demands for sugar were not gratified.  Wheels worked within wheels, however, for he felt so disgusted with the part he had to play that he got into the sulks naturally!  \"Fuss-rate!\" whispered Peter, \"you's a'most as good as myself.\"  By this time they had reached one of the eastern gates of the city.  It was named Bab-Azoun.  As they passed through it the negro told his brother-slave that the large iron hooks which ornamented the wall there were used for the purpose of having criminals cast on them; the wretched victims being left to hang there, by whatever parts of their bodies chanced to catch on the hooks, till they died.  Having reached the open country outside the walls, they walked along a beautiful road, from which were obtained here and there splendid views of the surrounding country.  On one side lay the blue Mediterranean, with its picturesque boats and shipping, and the white city descending to the very edge of the sea; on the other side rose the wooded slopes of a suburb named Mustapha, with numerous white Moorish houses in the midst of luxuriant gardens, where palms, bananas, cypresses, aloes, lemon-trees, and orange groves perfumed the balmy air, and afforded grateful shade from the glare of the African sun.  Into one of those gardens the Moor at last turned and led the way to a house, which, if not in itself beautiful according to European notions of architecture, was at least rendered cheerful with whitewash, and stood in the midst of a beauty and luxuriance of vegetation that could not be surpassed.  Opening a door in this building, the Turk entered.  His slaves followed, and Foster, to his surprise, found what may be styled a miniature garden in the courtyard within.    CHAPTER FOUR.  OUR MIDDY IS PUT TO WORK--ALSO PUT ON HIS \"WORD-OF-HONOUR,\" AND RECEIVES A GREAT SHOCK OF SURPRISE.  George Foster soon found that his master and owner, Ben-Ahmed, was a stern and exacting, but by no means an ill-natured or cruel, man.  He appeared to be considerably over sixty years of age, but showed no signs of abated vigour.  In character he was amiable and just, according to his light, but dignified and reticent.  His first act, after seating himself cross-legged on a carpet in a marble and tessellated recess, was to call for a hookah.  He smoked that for a few minutes and contemplated the courtyard on which the recess opened.  It was a pleasant object of contemplation, being filled with young orange-trees and creeping plants of a tropical kind, which were watered by a stone fountain in the centre of the court.  This fountain also served to replenish a marble bath, to cool the sultry air, and to make pleasant tinkling music.  Of course the nose was not forgotten in this luxurious assemblage of things that were gratifying to ear and eye. Flowers of many kinds were scattered around, and sweet-scented plants perfumed the air.  Ben-Ahmed's next act, after having lighted his pipe, was to summon Peter the Great and his new slave--the former to act as interpreter, for it was a peculiarity of this Moor that though he appeared to understand English he would not condescend to speak it.  After asking several questions as to our hero's name, age, and calling in life, he told Peter to inform Foster that escape from that country was impossible, that any attempt to escape would be punished with flogging and other torture, that perseverance in such attempts would result in his being sent to work in chains with the Bagnio slaves and would probably end in death from excessive toil, torture, and partial starvation.  Having said this, the Moor asked several questions--through the negro, and always in the Lingua Franca.  \"Massa bids me ax,\" said Peter, \"if you are a gentleman, an' if you know it am de custom in England for gentleman-pris'ners to give dere word-ob-honour dat dey not run away, an' den go about as if dey was free?\"  \"Tell him that every officer in the service of the King of England is considered a gentleman.\"  \"Come now, sar,\" interrupted Peter sternly, \"you know das not true.  I bin in England myself--cook to a French rest'rung in London--an' I nebber hear dat a _pleece_ officer was a gentleman!\"  \"Well, I mean every commissioned officer in the army and navy,\" returned Foster, \"and when such are taken prisoner I am aware that they are always allowed a certain amount of freedom of action on giving their word of honour that they will not attempt to escape.\"  When this was explained to Ben-Ahmed, he again said a few words to the negro, who translated as before.  \"Massa say dat as you are a gentleman if you will gib your word-ob-honour not to escape, he will make you free.  Not kite free, ob course, but free to work in de gardin widout chains; free to sleep in de out-house widout bein' locked up ob nights, an' free to enjoy you'self w'en you gits de chance.\"  Foster looked keenly at the negro, being uncertain whether or not he was jesting, but the solemn features of that arch \"hyperkrite\" were no index to the working of his eccentric mind--save when he permitted them to speak; then, indeed, they were almost more intelligible than the plainest language.  \"And what if I refuse to pledge my word for the sake of such freedom?\" asked our hero.  \"W'y, den you'll git whacked, an' you'll 'sperience uncommon hard times, an' you'll change you mind bery soon, so I t'ink, on de whole, you better change 'im at once.  Seems to me you's a remarkably obs'nit young feller!\"  With a sad feeling that he was doing something equivalent to locking the door and throwing away the key, Foster gave the required promise, and was forthwith conducted into the garden and set to work.  His dark friend supplied him with a new striped cotton shirt--his own having been severely torn during his recent adventures--also with a pair of canvas trousers, a linen jacket, and a straw hat with a broad rim; all of which fitted him badly, and might have caused him some discomfort in other circumstances, but he was too much depressed just then to care much for anything.  His duty that day consisted in digging up a piece of waste ground.  To relieve his mind, he set to work with tremendous energy, insomuch that Peter the Great, who was looking on, exclaimed--  \"Hi! what a digger you is!  You'll bust up altogidder if you goes on like dat.  De moles is nuffin' to you.\"  But Foster heeded not.  The thought that he was now doomed to hopeless slavery, perhaps for life, was pressed home to him more powerfully than ever, and he felt that if he was to save himself from going mad he must work with his muscles like a tiger, and, if possible, cease to think. Accordingly, he went on toiling till the perspiration ran down his face, and all his sinews were strained.  \"Poor boy!\" muttered the negro in a low tone, \"he's tryin' to dig his own grave.  But he not succeed.  Many a man try dat before now and failed.  Howsomeber, it's blowin' a hard gale wid him just now--an' de harder it blow de sooner it's ober.  Arter de storm comes de calm.\"  With these philosophic reflections, Peter the Great went off to his own work, leaving our hero turning over the soil like a steam-plough.  Strong though Foster was--both of muscle and will--he was but human after all.  In course of time he stopped from sheer exhaustion, flung down the spade, and, raising himself with his hands stretched up and his face turned to the sky, he cried--  \"God help me! what shall I do?\"  Then, dropping his face on his hands, he stood for a considerable time quite motionless.  \"What a fool I was to promise not to try to escape!\" he thought, and a feeling of despair followed the thought, but a certain touch of relief came when he reflected that at any time he could go boldly to his master, withdraw the promise, and take the consequences.  He was still standing like a statue, with his hands covering his face, when he felt a light touch on his shoulder.  It was the negro who had returned to see how he was getting on.  \"Look yar, now, Geo'ge,\" he said in quite a fatherly manner, \"dis'll neber do.  My massa buy you to work in de gardin, not to stand like a statoo washin' its face widout soap or water.  We don't want no more statoos.  Got more'n enuff ob marble ones all around.  Besides, you don't make a good statoo--leastwise not wid dem slop clo'es on.  Now, come yar, Geo'ge.  I wants a little combersation wid you.  I'll preach you a small sarmin if you'll allow me.\"  So saying, Peter led his assistant slave into a cool arbour, where Ben-Ahmed was wont at times to soothe his spirits with a pipe.  \"Now, look yar, Geo'ge, dis won't do.  I say it once and for all--dis _won't do_.\"  \"I know it won't, Peter,\" replied the almost heart-broken middy, with a sad smile, \"you're very kind.  I know you take an interest in me, and I'll try to do better, but I'm not used to spade-work, you know, and--\"  \"Spade-work!\" shouted Peter, laying his huge black hand on Foster's shoulder, and giving him a squeeze that made him wince, \"das not what I mean.  Work! w'y you's done more'n a day's work in one hour, judging by de work ob or'nary slabes.  No, das not it.  What's"]]]
