His first impulse was to shout for deliverance, but his manhood returned to him, and he restrained himself.  Groping his way cautiously along the passage or tunnel, which descended at first steeply, he came to a part which he could feel was regularly built over with an arch of brickwork or masonry, and the sound of running water overhead told him that this was a tunnel under the rivulet.  As he advanced the tunnel widened a little, and began to ascend.  After creeping what he judged to be a hundred yards or so, he thought he could see a glimmer of light like a faint star in front of him.  It was the opening to which Betty had referred.  He soon reached it and emerged into the fresh air.  As he raised himself, and drew a long breath of relief, the words of his deliverer seemed to start up before him in letters of fire--  \"Use your freedom to escape from death--but _much more, to escape from sin_.\"  \"I will, so help me God!\" he exclaimed, clasping his hands convulsively and looking upward.  In the strength of the new-born resolution thus induced by the Spirit of God, he fell on his knees and tried to pray. Then he rose and sat down to think, strangely forgetful of the urgent need there was for flight.  Meanwhile Gashford and his men proceeded to question Paul Bevan and his daughter.  The party included, among others, Fred Westly, Paddy Flinders, and Crossby.  Gashford more than suspected the motives of the first two in accompanying him, but did not quite see his way to decline their services, even if he had possessed the power to do so.  He consoled himself, however, with the reflection that he could keep a sharp eye on their movements.  \"No, no, Bevan,\" he said, when the man brought out a case-bottle of rum and invited him to drink, \"we have other work on hand just now.  We have traced that young thief Brixton to this hut, and we want to get hold of him.\"  \"A thief, is he?\" returned Bevan, with a look of feigned surprise. \"Well, now, that _is_ strange news.  Tom Brixton don't look much like a thief, do he?\"  (appealing to the by-standers).  \"There must be some mistake, surely.\"  \"There's no mistake,\" said Gashford, with an oath.  \"He stole a bag o' gold from my tent.  To be sure he dropped it in his flight so I've got it back again, but that don't affect his guilt.\"  \"But surely, Mister Gashford,\" said Bevan slowly, for, having been hurriedly told in a whisper by Betty what she had done for Tom, he was anxious to give his friend as much time as possible to escape, \"surely as you've come by no loss, ye can afford to let the poor young feller off this time.\"  \"No, we can't,\" shouted Gashford, fiercely.  \"These mean pilferers have become a perfect pest at the diggin's, an' we intend to stop their little game, we do, by stoppin' their windpipes when we catch them. Come, don't shilly-shally any longer, Paul Bevan.  He's here, and no mistake, so you'd better hand him over.  Besides, you owe us something, you know, for coming to your help agin the redskins in the nick of time.\"  \"Well, as to that I _am_ much obliged, though, after all, it wasn't to help me you came.\"  \"No matter,\" exclaimed the other impatiently, \"you know he is here, an' you're bound to give him up.\"  \"But I _don't_ know that he's here, an' I _can't_ give him up, cause why? he's escaped.\"  \"Escaped! impossible, there is only one bridge to this mound, and he has not crossed that since we arrived, I'll be bound.  There's a sentry on it now.\"  \"But an active young feller can jump, you know.\"  \"No, he couldn't jump over the creek, unless he was a human flea or a Rocky Mountain goat.  Come, since you won't show us where he is, we'll take the liberty of sarchin' your premises.  But stay, your daughter's got the name o' bein' a religious gal.  If there's any truth in that she'd be above tellin' a lie.  Come now, Betty, tell us, like a good gal, is Tom Brixton here?\"  \"No, he is not here,\" replied the girl.  \"Where is he, then?\"  \"I do not know.\"  \"That's false, you _do_ know.  But come, lads, we'll sarch, and here's a cellar to begin with.\"  He laid hold of the iron ring of the trap-door, opened it, and seizing a light descended, followed by Bevan, Crossby, Flinders, and one or two others.  Tossing the lumber about he finally rolled aside the barrels ranged beside the wall, until the entrance to the subterranean way was discovered.  \"Ho! ho!\" he cried, lowering the light and gazing into it.  \"Here's something, anyhow.\"  After peering into the dark hole for some time he felt with his hand as far as his arm could reach.  \"Mind he don't bite!\" suggested Paddy Flinders, in a tone that drew a laugh from the by-standers.  \"Hand me that stick, Paddy,\" said Gashford, \"and keep your jokes to a more convenient season.\"  \"Ah! then 'tis always a convanient season wid me, sor,\" replied Paddy, with a wink at his companions as he handed the stick.  \"Does this hole go far in?\" he asked, after a fruitless poking about with the stick.  \"Ay, a long way.  More'n a hundred yards,\" returned Bevan.  \"Well, I'll have a look at it.\"  Saying which Gashford pushed the light as far in as he could reach, and then, taking a bowie-knife between his teeth, attempted to follow.  We say attempted, because he was successful only in a partial degree. It must be remembered that Gashford was an unusually large man, and that Tom Brixton had been obliged to use a little force in order to gain an entrance.  When, therefore, the huge bully had thrust himself in about as far as his waist he stuck hard and fast, so that he could neither advance nor retreat!  He struggled violently, and a muffled sound of shouting was heard inside the hole, but no one could make out what was said.  \"Och! the poor cratur,\" exclaimed Paddy Flinders, with a look of overdone commiseration, \"what'll we do for 'im at all at all?\"  \"Let's try to pull him out,\" suggested Crossby.  They tried and failed, although as many as could manage it laid hold of him.  \"Sure he minds me of a stiff cork in a bottle,\" said Flinders, wiping the perspiration from his forehead, \"an' what a most awful crack he'll make whin he does come out!  Let's give another heave, boys.\"  They gave another heave, but only caused the muffled shouting inside to increase.  \"Och! the poor cratur's stritchin' out like a injin-rubber man; sure he's a fut longer than he used to be--him that was a sight too long already,\" said Flinders.  \"Let's try to shove him through,\" suggested the baffled Crossby.  Failure again followed their united efforts--except as regards the muffled shouting within, which increased in vigour and was accompanied by no small amount of kicking by what of Gashford remained in the cellar.  \"I'm afeared his legs'll come off altogether if we try to pull harder than we've done,\" said Crossby, contemplating the huge and helpless limbs of the victim with a perplexed air.  \"What a chance, boys,\" suddenly exclaimed Flinders, \"to pay off old scores with a tree-mendous wallopin'!  We could do it aisy in five or six minutes, an' then lave 'im to think over it for the rest of his life.\"  As no one approved of Paddy's proposal, it was finally resolved to dig the big man out and a pick and shovel were procured for the purpose.  Contrary to all expectations, Gashford was calm, almost subdued, when his friends at last set him free.  Instead of storming and abusing every one, he said quietly but quickly, \"Let us search the bush now.  He can't be far off yet, and there's moonlight enough.\"  Leading the way, he sprang up the cellar stair, out at the hut-door, and across the bridge, followed closely by his party.  \"Hooroo!\" yelled Paddy Flinders, as if in the irrepressible ardour of the chase, but in reality to give Brixton intimation of the pursuit, if he should chance to be within earshot.  The well-meant signal did indeed take effect, but it came too late.  It found Tom still seated in absorbed meditation.  Rudely awakened to the consciousness of his danger and his stupidity, he leaped up and ran along the path that Betty had described to him.  At the same moment it chanced that Crossby came upon the same path at its river-side extremity, and in a few moments each ran violently into the other's arms, and both rolled upon the ground.  The embrace that Crossby gave the youth would have been creditable even to a black bear, but Tom was a match for him in his then condition of savage despair.  He rolled the rough digger over on his back, half strangled him, and bumped his shaggy head against the conveniently-situated root of a tree.  But Crossby held on with the tenacity of sticking-plaster, shouting wildly all the time, and before either could subdue the other, Gashford and his men coming up stopped the combat.  It were vain attempting to describe the conflict of Brixton's feelings as they once more bound his arms securely behind him and led him back to Paul Bevan's hut.  The thought of death while fighting with man or beast had never given him much concern, but to be done to death by the rope as a petty thief was dreadful to contemplate, while to appear before the girl he loved, humiliated and bound, was in itself a sort of preliminary death.  Afterwards, when confined securely in the cellar and left to himself for the night, with a few pine branches as a bed, the thought of home and mother came to him with overwhelming power, and finally mingled with his dreams.  But those dreams, however pleasant they might be at first and in some respects, invariably ended with the branch of a tree and a rope with a noose dangling at the end thereof, and he awoke again and again with a choking sensation, under the impression that the noose was already tightening on his throat.  The agony endured that night while alone in the dark cellar was terrible, for Tom knew the temper of the diggers too well to doubt his fate.

The following story is intended to illustrate one of the many phases of the fur-trader's life in those wild regions of North America which surround Hudson's Bay.  Most of its major incidents are facts--fiction being employed chiefly for the purpose of weaving these facts into a readable form.  If this volume should chance to fall into the hands of any of those who acted a part in the first settlement of Ungava, we trust that they will forgive the liberty that has been taken with their persons and adventures, remembering that transpositions, modifications, and transformations are necessary in constructing a tale out of the \"raw material.\"  We take this opportunity of expressing to the Leader of the adventurous band our grateful acknowledgements for his kindness in placing at our disposal the groundwork on which this story has been reared.  R.M.  Ballantyne.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE FOREST, AND THE LEADERS OF THE FOLORN-HOPE--A GOOD SHOT--A CONSULTATION--AN ICE-FLOE, AND A NARROW CHANCE OF ESCAPE IN A SMALL WAY.  \"Hallo! where are you!\" shouted a voice that rang through the glades of the forest like the blast of a silver trumpet, testifying to lungs of leather and a throat of brass.  The ringing tones died away, and naught was heard save the rustling of the leafy canopy overhead, as the young man, whose shout had thus rudely disturbed the surrounding echoes, leaned on the muzzle of a long rifle, and stood motionless as a statue, his right foot resting on the trunk of a fallen tree, and his head bent slightly to one side, as if listening for a reply.  But no reply came.  A squirrel ran down the trunk of a neighbouring pine, and paused, with tail and ears erect, and its little black eyes glittering as if with surprise at the temerity of him who so recklessly dared to intrude upon and desecrate with his powerful voice the deep solitudes of the wilderness.  They stood so long thus that it seemed as though the little animal and the man had been petrified by the unwonted sound.  If so, the spell was quickly broken.  The loud report of a fowling-piece was heard at a short distance.  The squirrel incontinently disappeared from the spot on which it stood, and almost instantaneously reappeared on the topmost branch of a high tree; while the young man gave a smile of satisfaction, threw the rifle over his shoulder, and, turning round, strode rapidly away in the direction whence the shot proceeded.  A few minutes' walk brought him to the banks of a little brook, by the side of which, on the projecting root of a tree, sat a man, with a dead goose at his feet and a fowling-piece by his side.  He was dressed in the garb of a hunter; and, from the number of gray hairs that shone like threads of silver among the black curls on his temples, he was evidently past the meridian of life--although, from the upright bearing of his tall, muscular frame, and the quick glance of his fearless black eye, it was equally evident that the vigour of his youth was not yet abated.  \"Why, Stanley,\" exclaimed the young man as he approached, \"I've been shouting till my throat is cracked, for at least half an hour.  I verily began to think that you had forsaken me altogether.\"  \"In which case, Frank,\" replied the other, \"I should have treated you as you deserve, for your empty game-bag proves you an unworthy comrade in the chase.\"  \"So, so, friend, do not boast,\" replied the youth with a smile; \"if I mistake not, that goose was winging its way to the far north not ten minutes agone.  Had I come up half an hour sooner, I suspect we should have met on equal terms; but the fact is that I have not seen hair or feather, save a tree-squirrel, since I left you in the morning.\"  \"Well, to say truth, I was equally unfortunate until I met this luckless goose, and fired the shot that brought him down and brought you up.  But I've had enough o' this now, and shall back to the fort again.  What say you?  Will you go in my canoe or walk?\"  The young man was silent for a few seconds; then, without replying to his companion's question, he said,--\"By-the-bye, is it not to-night that you mean to make another attempt to induce the men to volunteer for the expedition!\"  \"It is,\" replied Stanley, with a alight frown.  \"And what if they still persist in refusing to go?\"  \"I'll try once more to shame them out of their cowardice.  But if they won't agree, I'll compel them to go by means of more powerful arguments than words.\"  \"'Tis not cowardice; you do the men injustice,\" said Frank, shaking his head.  \"Well, well, I believe I do, lad; you're right,\" replied Stanley, while a smile smoothed out the firm lines that had gathered round his lips for a few seconds.  \"No doubt they care as little for the anticipated dangers of the expedition as any men living, and they hesitate to go simply because they know that the life before them will be a lonely one at such an out-o'-the-way place as Ungava.  But we can't help that, Frank; the interests of the Company must be attended to, and so go they _must_, willing or not willing.  But I'm annoyed at this unexpected difficulty, for there's a mighty difference between men who volunteer to go and men who go merely because they must and can't help it.\"  The young man slowly rubbed the stock of his rifle with the sleeve of his coat, and looked as if he understood and sympathised with his friend's chagrin.  \"If Prince were only here just now,\" said he, looking up, \"there would be no difficulty in the matter.  These fellows only want a bold, hearty comrade to step forward and show them the way, and they will follow to the North Pole if need be.  They look upon our willingness to go as a mere matter of course, though I don't see why we should be expected to like banishment more than themselves.  But if Prince were--\"  \"Well, well, Prince is _not_ here, so we must do the best we can without him,\" said Stanley.  As he spoke, the trumpet note of a goose was heard in the distance.  \"There he goes!--down with you!\" exclaimed Frank, darting suddenly behind the stump of the tree, while his companion crouched beside him, and both began to shout at the top of their voices in imitation of the goose.  The bird was foolish enough to accept the invitation immediately, although, had it been other than a goose, it would have easily recognised the sound as a wretched counterfeit of the goose language.  It flew directly towards them, as geese always do in spring when thus enticed, but passed at such a distance that the elder sportsman was induced to lower his piece.  \"Ah! he's too far off.  You'd better give him a shot with the rifle, Frank; but you're sure to miss.\"  \"To hit, you mean,\" cried his companion, flushing with momentary indignation at this disparaging remark.  At the same moment he took a rapid aim and fired.  For a few yards the goose continued its forward flight as if unhurt; then it wavered once or twice, and fell heavily to the ground.  \"Bravo, boy!\" cried Stanley.  \"There, don't look nettled; I only jested with you, knowing your weakness on the score of rifle-shooting.  Now, pick up your bird, and throw it into the canoe, for I must away.\"  Frank finished reloading his piece as his friend spoke, and went to pick up the goose; while the other walked down to the edge of the rivulet, and disengaged a light birch-bark canoe from the long grass and sedges that almost hid it from view.  \"Make haste, Frank!\" he shouted; \"there's the ice coming up with the flood-tide, and bearing down on the creek here.\"  At a short distance from the spot where the sportsmen stood, the streamlet already alluded to mingled its waters with a broad river, which, a few miles farther down, flows into James's Bay.  As every one knows, this bay lies to the south of Hudson's Bay, in North America. Here the river is about two miles wide; and the shores on either side being low, it has all the appearance of an extensive lake.  In spring, after the disruption of the ice, its waters are loaded with large floes and fields of ice; and later in the season, after it has become quite free from this wintry encumbrance, numerous detached masses come up with every flood-tide.  It was the approach of one of these floes that called forth Stanley's remark.  The young man replied to it by springing towards the canoe, in which his companion was already seated.  Throwing the dead bird into it, he stooped, and gave the light bark a powerful shove into the stream, exclaiming, as he did so, \"There, strike out, you've no time to lose, and I'll go round by the woods.\"  There was indeed no time to lose.  The huge mass of ice was closing rapidly into the mouth of the creek, and narrowing the only passage through which the canoe could escape into the open water of the river beyond.  Stanley might, indeed, drag his canoe up the bank, if so disposed, and reach home by a circuitous walk through the woods; but by doing so he would lose much time, and be under the necessity of carrying his gun, blanket, tin kettle, and the goose, on his back.  His broad shoulders were admirably adapted for such a burden, but he preferred the canoe to the woods on the present occasion.  Besides, the only risk he ran was that of getting his canoe crushed to pieces.  So, plunging his paddle vigorously in the water, he shot through the lessening channel like an arrow, and swept out on the bosom of the broad river just as the ice closed with a crash upon the shore and ground itself to powder on the rocks.  \"Well done!\" shouted Frank, with a wave of his cap, as he witnessed the success of his friend's exploit.  \"All right,\" replied Stanley, glancing over his shoulder.  In another moment the canoe disappeared behind a group of willows that grew on the point at the river's mouth, and the young man was left alone.  For a few minutes he stood contemplating the point behind which his companion had disappeared; then giving a hasty glance at the priming of his rifle, he threw it across his"]]]
