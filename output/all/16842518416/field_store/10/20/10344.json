On the horizon the clouds were so black that the shrieking sea-birds passed athwart them like flakes of snow.  Low muttering thunder was heard at intervals; and as night drew on, gleams of lightning flashed in the obscurity.  During one of these flashes Jeff thought he saw a vessel labouring heavily.  He could not be quite sure, for by that time spray, borne on the whistling wind, was blinding him.  Suddenly a red flash was seen, followed by a report.  It was a signal of distress.  Every thought and feeling save that of duty was instantly banished from the mind of our coastguardsman, as he hurried away to give the alarm and join in the rescue.    CHAPTER FOUR.  A WRECK AND RESCUE.  Terrible was the gale which burst that night upon the shores of old England, and awful the fate that awaited many of the vessels which were nearing port at the time.  Better far for many of them had they met the foe in the open field of what seamen term blue water, for no place is so dangerous as the shallow waters off the coast when the storm-fiend is abroad.  Perhaps it may be news to some readers that the losses of this country by shipwreck form a perennial drain of life and wealth as regular and certain as the recurrence of the seasons.  Nearly two thousand ships, two millions sterling, and little short of a thousand lives are lost each year on the shores of the United Kingdom--sometimes more, sometimes less,--each and every year.  We give round numbers, because they are more easily remembered.  On the particular night of which we write, many a gallant ship was driving over the sea, making for her port, nearing home and friends, rushing to her doom!  Passengers and crews alike had by that time, doubtless, become so familiar with whistling gales and heaving seas, that they had ceased to fear them; but some among them had yet to learn, when too late, that the dangers of the deep are insignificant compared with the perils of the shore.  Among these hapless ships was one to which we direct the reader's particular attention.  She was a large ship, with a crew of between twenty and thirty men, bound from China to the Thames.  She carried no passengers, and was commanded by our friend, Captain Millet.  No captain in the mercantile navy of Britain was better qualified than he to take his ship across the trackless main, and, if need be, carry her safely into port; but seamanship and knowledge of channels and bars and currents avail nothing when the sails and cordage of a ship are unseaworthy and her timbers worn out.  The owners of the _North Star_ cared little for human lives.  They were economists of the strictest kind.  Hence her condition was bad.  The gale overtook the _North Star_ when she was not far from the coast where nestled her captain's native town of Cranby.  A pilot had been signalled for in vain, for the night was thick as well as stormy.  At last one was obtained, and all went fairly well until the vessel was off the black rocks on which the eyes of Jeff Benson had been resting for some time.  Fearing that he was too near that point of danger, the pilot gave orders to go about.  While the vessel was in stays, one of the ropes parted, and she missed.  At the same moment a squall came down on her, and carried away the main and fore-topmasts with the jib-boom. Instantly the vessel was unmanageable, and drifted bodily towards the rocks.  Captain Millet and his men toiled like heroes to clear away the wreckage, and orders were given to fire the signal-gun.  As we have seen, our coastguardsman was swift to carry the alarm to his station, and without delay the lifeboat was launched.  At the same time orders were given to get ready the coastguard boat, in case its services should be required.  The regular crew of the lifeboat had, as usual, been on the alert, and the bright blue boat of mercy was at once run down to the beach, until her carriage reached the edge of the foaming sea.  \"Now, lads, jump in!\" shouted the coxswain.  It was found, however, when they had taken their places and seized the oars, that two of the crew were missing.  Volunteers were instantly called for, and Jeff, with his friend David Bowers, answered to the call.  They put on the cork life-belts, took the vacant seats, and grasped the oars.  Then the transporting carriage, with the boat and crew on it, was pushed by many willing hands as far into the sea as possible, the men bending forward with the oars out, ready to pull at a moment's notice.  The launching ropes were already manned.  At another signal from the coxswain, the boat plunged into the boiling surf, the oars were dipped, ten strong backs were bent, and away they shot on their errand of mercy--drenched and filled by the first great billow through which they cut their way, but not swamped, for the water ran out through the discharging tubes as fast as it came in.  An hour of hard toil brought them within sight of the wreck.  Keeping well to windward, the coxswain cast anchor, and the bowman, taking a turn or two of the cable round the bollard, allowed the boat to drop down to the wreck, stern foremost.  \"Can't you get round to leeward of the wreck?\" asked Jeff, who sat near the stern of the boat, keeping a firm grasp of his oar, which the rushing and breaking seas well-nigh forced out of his hands.  \"No, not as the rocks lie,\" replied the coxswain curtly.  On drawing a few yards nearer, it became evident that no boat could live in the seething caldron of rocks and foam that lay under the lee of the wreck.  Their only chance lay in approaching from the weather side, which was not only a difficult and dangerous operation, but was rendered doubly so by the violent swaying of the wreck from side to side.  The roaring of the gale and thunder of the seas, combined with the darkness and the hurtling spray, rendered it impossible for the men in the life-boat to distinguish anything clearly, until close to the wreck. Then it was seen that the whole crew had taken to the rigging of the mainmast--the topmast of which had been carried away by the fall of the foremast and mizzen.  A lusty cheer told that the shipwrecked men were still strong in hope, though their situation was terrible; for every lurch of the hull shook the swaying top so violently as almost to tear even the strong seamen from their grasp.  \"Jeff,\" said Bowers, who sat on the same thwart with his friend, \"did ye not recognise a voice in that cheer?\"  \"Ay, that I did,\" returned Jeff, with feelings of great anxiety.  \"'Twas uncommon like Captain Millet.\"  \"Look out for the rope!\" roared one of the lifeboat men, as he swung and discharged the loaded stick with a line attached.  The heave was successful.  The men on the maintop of the wreck caught the line, and by means of it passed a stout warp between the mast and the boat, down which they began to shin like squirrels, for the prompt appearance of their rescuers had not left time for the exhaustion of their strength.  \"Is your vessel the _North Star_, commanded by Captain Millet?\" shouted Jeff in the ear of the first arrival, for the noise of raging elements rendered ordinary tones almost useless.  \"Ay, she is,\" replied the man; \"but you won't see _him_ till the last of us is safe aboard.\"  \"Hallo!  Captain Millet!\" cried Jeff, with a roar that almost equalled the elements.  \"Ay, ay, is that you, Jeff?\" came back in a similar roar (but greatly softened by distance) from the swirling spray-clouds that raged above the wreck.  \"Cheer up, Captain; we'll save you all right,\" returned our coastguardsman in another enthusiastic roar, which of itself did something to cheer up all who heard it.  About a dozen of the sailors had been got into the lifeboat, when a tremendous rending sound was heard, followed by a loud cry of alarm, as the mast broke off a few feet above the deck, and plunged, with the men still upon it, into the boiling sea.  To add to the confusion and terror, some part of the cordage caught the lifeboat, and completely sank as well as overturned it.  To an ignorant observer it might have seemed that all hope was gone-- that every man must perish.  But this was not so.  The buoyant qualities of the magnificent lifeboat brought it to the surface like a cork the instant it was freed.  Its self-righting qualities turned it on its keel.  The self-acting discharging tubes emptied it in less than two minutes; and the crew, supported by their cork life-belts, caught the life-lines festooned round the boat's side for this very purpose, and clambered into her.  Of the men of the wreck who had been tumbled into the sea along with them, some clung to their rescuers, whose belts could easily sustain two.  Others were able to lay hold of the boat, and a few held on to the floating wreckage till they were saved.  Suddenly the voice of Captain Millet was heard, \"Hold on, lads; don't go without me.  My foot's jammed here, and I can't--\"  He stopped abruptly, for the head of the mast plunged under water at the moment, taking the captain along with it.  Without a word Jeff rose and sprang into the sea at the spot where his friend had disappeared.  Almost at the same moment the end of the mast re-appeared, and struck our hero on the side with terrible violence.  In spite of the blow, however, he was able to free the captain, who was caught by several strong arms, and hauled inboard at the same moment that his rescuer laid hold of one of the hanging life-lines.  While they were still heaving at the captain, David Bowers heard Jeff's voice--  \"Your hand, Davy!\"  The stout coastguardsman was not slow to obey and he received a grip like that of a drowning man; but his mate made no other effort to save himself.  \"Help here, two of you,\" cried Bowers.  Another moment, and six brawny arms embraced Jeff, and lifted him into the boat.  \"Not hurt, I hope, Jeff?\"  \"Not much, Davy--at least not to speak of; only I'm a bit stunned.  Just let me lie here.  One o' the _North Star's_ men can take "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21743"],["title","Jeff Benson, or the Young Coastguardsman (#5)"],["body","oar.\"  There was no time for delicate attentions or inquiries in the circumstances, for the wreck of the mainmast had already given the boat, strong though it was, some damaging lunges as it shot wildly to and fro in the mad sea.  \"All there?\" demanded the coxswain of the saved men, who had been rapidly counting their numbers.  \"All here, thank God!\" answered Captain Millet.  \"Haul off, lads!\"  The men laid hold of the hawser, and hauled with a will--not a moment too soon, for the wreck was breaking up, and the sea around was strewn with heavy timbers.  Having hauled the boat up to her anchor, the latter was got in, and the oars were shipped.  These last being made fast to the boat with strong lines, had not been lost in all the turmoil, though two of them were broken.  They were replaced, however, by spare oars; and then the lifeboat, being pulled out of danger, hoisted her scrap of sail and scudded away gaily before the wind for the shore with her rescued freight.  Of course the news spread like wildfire that the lifeboat had come in with the crew of the wrecked _North Star_--some said the whole crew, others, part of the crew; for verbal reports of this kind never do coincide after travelling a short way.  \"Jeff, I must go straight to my sister, and be first wi' the news,\" said Captain Millet on landing.  \"You said my Rosebud is with her just now?\"  \"Yes, I'll go with 'ee, captain.\"  \"Come along, then, lad; but I fear you've got hurt.  You're sure it isn't broken ribs?\"  \"Oh, nothing to speak of,\" replied the youth, with a light laugh.  \"First however, I must telegraph to the owners,\" said the captain.  This duty performed, and his men comfortably housed in a neighbouring inn, Captain Millet and Jeff went off to the cottage.  It was about two in the morning when they reached it.  No one had yet been there.  In his excited state of mind, the captain, who had no nerves, thundered at the door.  If there was one thing that Miss Millet had a horror of, it was housebreakers.  She leaped out of bed, and began to dress in terror, having roused Rose, who slept with her.  \"Burglars never thunder like that, auntie,\" suggested Rose, as she hastily threw on her garments.  Miss Millet admitted the force of the argument and then, somewhat relieved, concluded that it must be tipsy men.  Under this impression she raised the window-sash--her bedroom being on the upper floor--and looked timidly out.  \"Go away, bad, naughty men!\" she said, in a remonstrative tone.  \"If you don't I shall send for the police!\"  \"Why, Molly, don't you know me?\"  \"Brother!\" shrieked Miss Millet.  \"Father!\" exclaimed the Rosebud.  Need we say that, after a few more hurried touches to costume, the door was opened, and the untimely visitors were admitted?  Need we add that when Rose, with a little cry of joy, leaped into her father's arms and received a paternal hug, she leaped out of them again with a little shriek of surprise?  \"Father, you're all wet! a perfect sponge!\"  \"True, darling, I forgot!  I've just been wrecked, and rescued by the lifeboat through God's great mercy, 'long with all my crew; and there,\" he added, pointing to Jeff, \"stands the man that saved my life.\"  If Rose loved the young coastguardsman before, she absolutely idolised him now.  Something of the feeling must have betrayed itself on her fair face, for Jeff made a step towards her, as if under an irresistible impulse to seize her hand.  But at that moment he experienced an agonising sensation of pain, and, staggering backwards, sat down--almost fell--upon the sofa.  \"Nothing--nothing,\" he replied, to the anxious inquiries of Miss Millet. \"Only a little pain, caused by the rap I got from that mast.  Come now, auntie, don't fuss about me, but sit down and hear what the captain has got to say.\"    CHAPTER FIVE.  MISS MILLET RECEIVES A SURPRISE, ROSEBUD A DISAPPOINTMENT, AND OUR HERO ANOTHER BLOW.  Miss Millet was one of those cheery, unselfish, active-minded women who are not easily thrown off their balance--deranged, as the French say--by untoward circumstances.  The arrival of any two friends at two in the morning would have failed to disturb the good nature or weaken the hospitality of that amiable creature.  Her joy, therefore, at the sudden, though untimely, appearance of her brother and friend was not marred by selfish considerations; and although she was eager to bear what the captain had to say, she would not let him begin until he and Jeff had retired to an attic chamber and put on dry habiliments.  How male attire came to be so handy in a spinster's house is easily accounted for by the fact that her regard for the memory of her departed father was so great as to have induced her to leave his hat and stick in the passage in their wonted places after his death, and to leave undisturbed the chest of drawers which contained the greater part of his wardrobe.  Nothing short of absolute necessity would have induced Miss Millet to disturb these sacred relics; but she knew that death might result from sitting in drenched clothes, and her well-balanced mind at once pointed out that here was a case which demanded a sacrifice.  She therefore bowed to the inevitable, and handed her brother the key of the chest of drawers.  As the late Mr Millet had been a large man, the result was that her visitors were admirably fitted out--the only disadvantage being that the captain had to turn up the legs of the trousers and the cuffs of the coat.  Meanwhile Miss Millet lighted a gas-stove, which she had always ready for invalid purposes, and Rose arranged the table, so that when their visitors returned to the parlour, they were greeted with the sight of food and the singing of the tea-kettle.  \"I can offer you brandy, brother,\" said the little hostess, \"_as a medicine_!\"  \"Thankee, Molly--not even as a medicine,\" said the captain, with a benignant look; \"tea is better in the circumstances.  I can speak from a vast amount of experience.  But of course I speak only for myself.  I don't know what Jeff's principles--\"  \"My principles,\" interrupted the coastguardsman, \"are to leave every man to judge for himself.  My judgment for myself is, that, as I don't require strong drink, I'm much better without it.\"  \"My principles go much further than that,\" said Miss Millet who was an enthusiastic total abstainer.  \"The Bible justifies me in denying myself the use of wine and all spirituous liquors _for my brother's sake_, so that I may set him an example, and also have more weight when I reason with him, and try to get him to adopt my views.\"  \"Why, Molly, to hear you talk like that about giving up drink for your brother's sake, one would think that I had bin a tippler all my life!\"  \"You know that I refer to my brother--man, brother.\"  \"Ah, of course--of course; and also your sister-woman, I suppose,\" cried the captain, seizing the loaf and beginning to cut it into inch-and-a-half slices.  \"What's _your_ opinion, Rosebud, on the drink question?\"  Rose, whose cheeks emulated her namesake flower, replied that, never having tasted wine or spirits in her life, or thought upon the drink question at all, she had no opinion to express.  \"Long may you continue in that innocent and humble state of mind, my Rosebud,\" cried the captain, with a laugh which caused him to choke on his first mouthful of tea.  After recovering himself and wiping his eyes, he said--  \"Now, Moll, I must tell you all about the wreck;\" on which he launched out into a graphic description of what the reader already knows.  You may be sure that he did not underrate the services and heroism of Jeff, who sat wonderfully silent during the recital, and only acknowledged references to himself with a faint smile.  \"But, brother,\" exclaimed Miss Millet, with sudden energy when he had finished, \"what will the consequences of this wreck be?\"  \"The consequences, my dear, will be that the owners will lose a good many thousand pounds, for neither ship nor cargo were insured.  An' it sarves 'em right for the vessel was not fit to go to sea; an' they knew it, but were too graspin' to go to the expense o' refittin'.  Besides, they've bin what they call so lucky in past years that they thought, I fancy, there was no fear o' their luck departin'.\"  \"But I was not thinking of the owners, brother; I was thinking of the consequences to yourself.\"  \"Why, as to that, Molly, as I've lost my ship, I'm pretty safe to lose my situation; for, from what I know of the owners, they are sure to lay all the blame they can upon my shoulders, so that I won't find it easy to get another ship.  Worse than all, I had made a little private adventure of my own, which was very successful, and the result o' which I was bringin' home in gold-dust; and now every nugget o' that is at the bottom o' the sea.  So you see, Molly, it's loss an' disaster everywhere--nothin' but a black horizon all round.\"  Jeff glanced quickly at Miss Millet.  This seemed to bear somewhat on their recent discussions.  Miss Millet as quickly returned the glance.  \"I know what you are thinking, Jeff,\" she said, with an intelligent look.  \"Well, auntie,\" returned the youth, \"it does seem hard to think that any good can come out of all this--doesn't it?\"  \"Young man,\" said the captain, regarding Jeff with an almost stern look, \"if a savage were taken into a factory and shown the whirling wheels and bands and rollers working in all directions, and saw filthy old rags boiled and mixed up with grass and evil-smelling substances, and torn to shreds and reduced to pulp in the midst of dirt and clattering noise and apparent confusion; and if that savage were to say, `Surely nothin' good can come out of all this!' wouldn't you--knowin' that great rolls of fair and spotless paper were to come out of it--pronounce that savage a fool, or, at least, a presumptuous fellow?\"  \"True, captain; I accept the rebuke,\" said Jeff, with a short laugh and a swift glance at Rose, who, however, was gazing demurely at her tea-cup, "]]]
