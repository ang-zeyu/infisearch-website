He knew of such places chiefly from books or hearsay, or had gathered merely the superficial knowledge that comes through the opening of a swing-door.  For the first time in his life he stood inside a low drinking-shop, breathing its polluted atmosphere and listening to its foul language.  His first impulse was to retreat, but false shame, the knowledge that he had no friend in Portsmouth, or place to go to, that the state of his purse forbade his indulging in more suitable accommodation, and a certain pride of character which made him always determine to carry out what he had resolved to do--all these considerations and facts combined to prevent his acting on the better impulse.  He doggedly followed his guide to a small round table and sat down.  Prudence, however, began to operate within him.  He felt that he had done wrong; but it was too late now, he thought, to retrace his steps. He would, however, be on his guard; would not encourage the slightest familiarity on the part of any one, and would keep his eyes open.  For a youth who had seen nothing of the world this was a highly commendable resolve.  \"What'll you drink?\" asked Mr Sloper.  Miles was on the point of saying \"Coffee,\" but, reflecting that the beverage might not be readily obtainable in such a place, he substituted \"Beer.\"  Instead of calling the waiter, Mr Sloper went himself to the bar to fetch the liquor.  While he was thus engaged, Miles glanced round the room, and was particularly struck with the appearance of a large, fine-looking sailor who sat at the small table next to him, with hands thrust deep into his trousers-pockets, his chin resting on his broad chest, and a solemn, owlish stare in his semi-drunken yet manly countenance.  He sat alone, and was obviously in a very sulky frame of mind--a condition which he occasionally indicated through a growl of dissatisfaction.  As Miles sat wondering what could have upset the temper of a tar whose visage was marked by the unmistakable lines and dimples of good-humour, he overheard part of the conversation that passed between the barman and Mr Sloper.  \"What! have they got hold o' Rattling Bill?\" asked the former, as he drew the beer.  \"Ay, worse luck,\" returned Sloper.  \"I saw the sergeant as I came along lead him over to Miss Robinson's trap--confound her!\"  \"Don't you go fur to say anything agin Miss Robinson, old man,\" suddenly growled the big sailor, in a voice so deep and strong that it silenced for a moment the rest of the company.  \"Leastways, you may if you like, but if you do, I'll knock in your daylights, an' polish up your figur'-head so as your own mother would mistake you fur a battered saucepan!\"  The seaman did not move from his semi-recumbent position as he uttered this alarming threat, but he accompanied it with a portentous frown and an owlish wink of both eyes.  \"What! have _you_ joined the Blue Lights?\" asked Sloper, with a smile, referring to the name by which the religious and temperance men of the army were known.  \"No, I ha'n't.  Better for me, p'r'aps, if I had.  Here, waiter, fetch me another gin-an'-warer.  An' more o' the gin than the warer, mind. Heave ahead or I'll sink you!\"  Having been supplied with a fresh dose of gin and water, the seaman appeared to go to sleep, and Miles, for want of anything better to do, accepted Sloper's invitation to play a game of dominoes.  \"Are the beds here pretty good?\" he asked, as they were about to begin.  \"Yes, first-rate--for the money,\" answered Sloper.  \"That's a lie!\" growled the big sailor.  \"They're bad at any price-- stuffed wi' cocoa-nuts and marline-spikes.\"  Mr Sloper received this observation with the smiling urbanity of a man who eschews war at all costs.  \"You don't drink,\" he said after a time, referring to Miles's pot of beer, which he had not yet touched.  Miles made no reply, but by way of answer took up the pot and put it to his lips.  He had not drunk much of it when the big seaman rose hurriedly and staggered between the two tables.  In doing so, he accidentally knocked the pot out of the youth's hand, and sent the contents into Mr Sloper's face and down into his bosom, to the immense amusement of the company.  That man of peace accepted the baptism meekly, but Miles sprang up in sudden anger.  The seaman turned to him, however, with a benignantly apologetic smile.  \"Hallo! messmate.  I ax your parding.  They don't leave room even for a scarecrow to go about in this here cabin.  I'll stand you another glass. Give us your flipper!\"  There was no resisting this, it was said so heartily.  Miles grasped the huge hand that was extended and shook it warmly.  \"All right,\" he said, laughing.  \"I don't mind the beer, and there's plenty more where that came from, but I fear you have done some damage to my fr--\"  \"Your _friend_.  Out with it, sir.  Never be ashamed to acknowledge your friends,\" exclaimed the shabby man, as he wiped his face.  \"Hold on a bit,\" he added, rising; \"I'll have to change my shirt.  Won't keep you waitin' long.\"  \"Another pot o' beer for this 'ere gen'lem'n,\" said the sailor to the barman as Sloper left the room.  Paying for the drink, he returned and put the pot on the table.  Then, turning to Miles, he said in a low voice and with an intelligent look--  \"Come outside for a bit, messmate.  I wants to speak to 'ee.\"  Miles rose and followed the man in much surprise.  \"You'll excuse me, sir,\" he said, when a few yards away from the door; \"but I see that you're green, an' don't know what a rascally place you've got into.  I've been fleeced there myself, and yet I'm fool enough to go back!  Most o' the parties there--except the sailors an' sodgers--are thieves an' blackguards.  They've drugged your beer, I know; that's why I capsized it for you, and the feller that has got hold o' you is a well-known decoy-duck.  I don't know how much of the ready you may have about you, but this I does know, whether it be much or little, you wouldn't have a rap of it in the mornin' if you stayed the night in this here house.\"  \"Are you sure of this, friend?\" asked Miles, eyeing his companion doubtfully.  \"Ay, as sure as I am that my name's Jack Molloy.\"  \"But you've been shamming drunk all this time.  How am I to know that you are not shamming friendship now?\"  \"No, young man,\" returned the seaman with blinking solemnity.  \"I'm not shammin' drunk.  I on'y wish I was, for I'm three sheets in the wind at this minute, an' I've a splittin' headache due i' the mornin'.  The way as you've got to find out whether I'm fair an' above-board is to look me straight in the face an' don't wink.  If that don't settle the question, p'r'aps it'll convince you w'en I tells you that I don't care a rap whether you go back to that there grog-shop or not.  Only I'll clear my conscience--leastways, wot's left of it--by tellin' ye that if you do-- you--you'll wish as how you hadn't--supposin' they leave you the power to wish anything at all.\"  \"Well, I believe you are a true man, Mister Molloy--\"  \"Don't Mister me, mate,\" interrupted the seaman.  \"My name's Jack Molloy, at your service, an' that name don't require no handle--either Mister or Esquire--to prop it up.\"  The way in which the sailor squared his broad shoulders when he said this rendered it necessary to prop himself up.  Seeing which, Miles afforded the needful aid by taking his arm in a friendly way.  \"But come, let us go back,\" he said.  \"I must pay for my beer, you know.\"  \"Your beer is paid for, young man,\" said Molloy, stopping and refusing to move.  \"_I_ paid for it, so you've on'y got to settle with _me_. Besides, if you go back you're done for.  And you've no call to go back to say farewell to your dear friend Sloper, for he'll on'y grieve over the loss of your tin.  As to the unpurliteness o' the partin'--he won't break his heart over that.  No--you'll come wi' me down to the _Sailors' Welcome_ near the dock-gates, where you can get a good bed for sixpence a night, a heavy blow-out for tenpence, with a splendid readin'-room, full o' rockin' chairs, an' all the rest of it for nothin'.  An there's a lavatory--that's the name that they give to a place for cleanin' of yourself up--a lavatory--where you can wash yourself, if you like, till your skin comes off!  W'en I first putt up at the _Welcome_, the messmate as took me there said to me, says he, `Jack,' says he, `you was always fond o' water.'  `Right you are,' says I.  `Well,' says he, `there's a place in the _Sailors' Welcome_ where you can wash yourself all day, if you like, for nothing!'  \"I do b'lieve it was that as indooced me to give in.  I went an' saw this lavatory, an' I was so took up with it that I washed my hands in every bason in the place--one arter the other--an' used up ever so much soap, an'--would you believe it?--my hands wasn't clean after all!  Yes, it's one the wery best things in Portsm'uth, is Miss Robinson's Welcome--\"  \"Miss Robinson again!\" exclaimed Miles.  \"Ay--wot have you got to find fault wi' Miss Robinson?\" demanded the sailor sternly.  \"No fault to find at all,\" replied Miles, suffering himself to be hurried away by his new friend; \"but wherever I have gone since arriving in Portsmouth her name has cropped up!\"  \"In Portsmouth!\" echoed the sailor.  \"Let me tell you, young man, that wherever you go all over the world, if there's a British soldier there, Miss Sarah Robinson's name will be sure to crop up.  Why, don't you know that she's `The Soldiers' Friend'?\"  \"I'm afraid I must confess to ignorance on the point--yet, stay, now you couple her name with `The Soldier's Friend,' I have got a faint remembrance of having heard it before.  Have I not heard of a Miss Weston, too, in connection with a work of some sort among sailors?\"  \"Ay, no doubt ye have.  She has a grand Institoot in Portsm'uth too, but she goes in for sailors _only_--all over the kingdom--w'ereas Miss Robinson goes in for soldiers an' sailors both, though mainly for the soldiers."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21719"],["title","Blue Lights: Hot Work in the Soudan (#4)"],["body","set agoin' the _Sailors' Welcome_ before Miss Weston began in Portsm'uth, an' so she keeps it up, but there ain't no opposition or rivalry.  Their aims is pretty much alike, an' so they keep stroke together wi' the oars.  But I'll tell you more about that when you get inside.  Here we are!  There's the dock-gates, you see, and that's Queen Street, an' the _Welcome's_ close at hand.  It's a teetotal house, you know.  All Miss Robinson's Institoots is that.\"  \"Indeed!  How comes it, then, that a man--excuse me--`three sheets in the wind,' can gain admittance?\"  \"Oh! as to that, any sailor or soldier may get admittance, even if he's as drunk as a fiddler, if he on'y behaves his-self.  But they won't supply drink on the premises, or allow it to be brought in--'cept inside o' you, of coorse.  Cause why? you can't help that--leastwise not without the help of a stomach-pump.  Plenty o' men who ain't abstainers go to sleep every night at the _Welcome_, 'cause they find the beds and other things so comfortable.  In fact, some hard topers have been indooced to take the pledge in consekince o' what they've heard an' seen in this _Welcome_, though they came at first only for the readin'-room an' beds.  Here, let me look at you under this here lamp.  Yes.  You'll do.  You're something like a sea-dog already.  You won't object to change hats wi' me?\"  \"Why?\" asked Miles, somewhat amused.  \"Never you mind that, mate.  You just putt yourself under my orders if you'd sail comfortably before the wind.  I'll arrange matters, an' you can square up in the morning.\"  As Miles saw no particular reason for objecting to this fancy of his eccentric friend, he exchanged his soft cap for the sailor's straw hat, and they entered the _Welcome_ together.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE \"SAILORS' WELCOME\"--MILES HAS A NIGHT OF IT AND ENLISTS--HIS FRIEND ARMSTRONG HAS AN AGREEABLE SURPRISE AT THE SOLDIERS' INSTITUTE.  It was not long before our hero discovered the reason of Jack Molloy's solicitude about his appearance.  It was that he, Miles, should pass for a sailor, and thus be in a position to claim the hospitality of the _Sailors' Welcome_,--to the inner life of which, civilians were not admitted, though they were privileged, with the public in general, to the use of the outer refreshment-room.  \"Come here, Jack Molloy,\" he said, leading his friend aside, when he made this discovery.  \"You pride yourself on being a true-blue British tar, don't you?\"  \"I does,\" said Jack, with a profound solemnity of decision that comported well with his character and condition.  \"And you would scorn to serve under the French flag, or the Turkish flag, or the Black flag, or any flag but the Union Jack, wouldn't you?\"  \"Right you are, mate; them's my sentiments to a tee!\"  \"Well, then, you can't expect _me_ to sail under false colours any more than yourself,\" continued Miles.  \"I scorn to sail into this port under your straw hat, so I'll strike these colours, bid you good-bye, and make sail for another port where a civilian will be welcome.\"  Molloy frowned at the floor for some moments in stern perplexity.  \"You've took the wind out o' my sails entirely, you have,\" he replied at last; \"an' you're right, young man, but I'm troubled about you.  If you don't run into this here port you'll have to beat about in the offing all night, or cast anchor in the streets, for I don't know of another lodgin' in Portsm'uth w'ere you could hang out except them disrepitible grog-shops.  In coorse, there's the big hotels; but I heerd you say to Sloper that you was bound to do things cheap, bein' hard up.\"  \"Never mind, my friend,\" said Miles quickly.  \"I will manage somehow; so good-night, and many thanks to you for the interest you have taken in--\"  \"Avast, mate! there's no call to go into action in sitch a hurry.  This here _Sailors' Welcome_ opens the doors of its bar an' refreshment-room, an' spreads its purvisions before all an' sundry as can afford to pay its moderate demands.  It's on'y the after-cabin you're not free to.  So you'll have a bit supper wi' me before you set sail on your night cruise.\"  Being by that time rather hungry as well as fatigued, Miles agreed to remain for supper.  While they were engaged with it, he was greatly impressed with the number of sailors and marines who passed into the reading-room beyond the bar, or who sat down at the numerous tables around to have a hearty supper, which they washed down with tea and coffee instead of beer or gin--apparently with tremendous appetite and much satisfaction.  \"Look ye here,\" said Jack Molloy, rising when their \"feed\" was about concluded, \"I've no doubt they won't object to your taking a squint at the readin'-room, though they won't let you use it.\"  Following his companion, Miles passed by a glass double door into an enormous well-lighted, warm room, seventy feet long, and of proportionate width and height, in which a goodly number of men of the sea were busy as bees--some of them reading books or turning over illustrated papers and magazines, others smoking their pipes, and enjoying themselves in rocking-chairs in front of the glowing fire, chatting, laughing, and yarning as free-and-easily as if in their native fo'c's'ls, while a few were examining the pictures on the walls, or the large models of ships which stood at one side of the room.  At the upper end a full-sized billiard-table afforded amusement to several players, and profound interest to a number of spectators, who passed their comments on the play with that off-hand freedom which seems to be a product of fresh gales and salt-water.  A door standing partly open at the upper end of this apartment revealed a large hall, from which issued faintly the sound of soft music.  \"Ain't it snug? and there's no gamblin' agoin' on there,\" remarked Molloy, as they returned to their table; \"that's not allowed--nor drinkin', nor card-playin', but that's all they putt a stop to.  She's a wise woman is Miss Robinson.  She don't hamper us wi' no rules.  Why, bless you, Jack ashore would never submit to rules!  He gits more than enough o' them afloat.  No; it's liberty hall here.  We may come an' go as we like, at all hours o' the day and night, an' do exactly as we please, so long as we don't smash up the furnitur', or feed without payin', or make ourselves a gineral noosance.  They don't even forbid swearin'.  They say they leave the matter o' lingo to our own good taste and good sense.  An' d'you know, it's wonderful what an' amount o' both we've got w'en we ain't worried about it!  You'll scarce hear an oath in this house from mornin' to evenin', though you'll hear a deal o' snorin' doorin' the night!  That's how the place takes so well, d'ee see?\"  \"Then the _Welcome_ is well patronised, I suppose?\"  \"Patronised!\" exclaimed the seaman; \"that's so, an' no mistake.  Why, mate--But what's your name?  I've forgot to ax you that all this time!\"  \"Call me Miles,\" said our hero, with some hesitation.  \"_Call_ you Miles!  _Ain't_ you Miles?\"  \"Well, yes, I am; only there's more of my name than that, but that's enough for your purpose, I daresay.\"  \"All right.  Well, Miles, you was askin' how the house is patronised. I'll tell 'ee.  They make up about two hundred an' twenty beds in it altogether, an' these are chock-full a'most every night.  One way or another they had forty-four thousand men, more or less, as slep' under this roof last year--so I've bin told.  That's patronisin', ain't it? To say nothin' o' the fellers as comes for--grub, which, as you've found, is good for the money, and the attendants is civil.  You see, they're always kind an' attentive here, 'cause they professes to think more of our souls than our bodies--which we've no objection to, d'ee see, for the lookin' arter our souls includes the lookin' arter our bodies!  An' they don't bother us in no way to attend their Bible-readin's an' sitchlike.  There they are in separate rooms; if you want 'em you may go; if you don't, you can let 'em alone.  No compulsion, which comes quite handy to some on us, for I don't myself care much about sitchlike things.  So long's my body's all right, I leaves my soul to look arter itself.\"  As the seaman said this with a good-natured smile of indifference, there sprang to the mind of his young companion words that had often been impressed on him by his mother: \"What shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\" but he made no reference to this at the time.  \"Hows'ever,\" continued Molloy, \"as they don't worrit us about religion, except to give us a good word an' a blessin' now an' again, and may-hap a little book to read, we all patronises the house; an it's my opinion, if it was twice as big as it is, we'd fill it chock-full.  I would board as well as sleep in it myself--for it's full o' conveniences, sitch as lockers to putt our things in, an' baths, and what not, besides all the other things I've mentioned--but the want o' drink staggers me.  I can't git along without a drop o' drink.\"  Miles thought that his nautical friend appeared to be unable to get along without a good many drops of drink, but he was too polite to say so.  \"Man alive!\" continued Jack Molloy, striking his huge fist on his thigh with emphasis; \"it's a wonderful place is this _Welcome_!  An' it's a lively place too.  Why, a fellow hanged his-self in one o' the bunks overhead not long ago.\"  \"You don't mean that?\" exclaimed Miles, rather shocked.  \"In course I does.  But they heard 'im gaspin', an cut him down in time to save him.  It was drink they say as made him do it, and they got him to sign the pledge arterwards.  I believe he's kep' it too.  Leastwise I know many a hard drinker as have bin indooced to give it up and stuck to it--all through comin' here to have a snooze in a comfortable hunk. They give the bunks names--cubicles they calls 'em in the lump. Separately, there's the `Commodore Goodenough Cot,' an' the `Little Nellie Cot,' an' the `Sunshine"]]]
