Everything in and around the ship, that night, breathed of harmony and peace-- though there was little knowledge among them of Him who is the Prince of Peace.  We say \"little\" knowledge, because Christianity had only just begun to dawn among the Norsemen at that time, and there were some on board of that discovery-ship who were tinged with the first rays of that sweet light which, in the person of the Son of God, was sent to lighten the world and to shine more and more unto the perfect day.  \"Now,\" said Karlsefin, at the conclusion of one of his stories, \"that is the saga of Halfdan the Black--at least it is part of his saga; but, friends, it seems to me that we must begin a saga of our own, for it is evident that if we are successful in this venture we shall have something to relate when we return to Greenland, and we must all learn to tell our saga in the same words, for that is the only way in which _truth_ can be handed down to future generations, seeing that when men are careless in learning the truth they are apt to distort it so that honest men are led into telling lies unwittingly.  They say that the nations of the south have invented a process whereby with a sharp-pointed tool they fashion marks on skins to represent words, so that once put down in this way a saga never changes.  Would that we Norsemen understood that process!\" said Karlsefin meditatively.  \"It seems to me,\" said Biarne, who reclined on the deck, leaning against the weather-bulwarks and running his fingers playfully through Olaf's fair curls, \"It seems to me that it were better to bestow the craft of the skald on the record of our voyage, for then the measure and the rhyme would chain men to the words, and so to the truth--that is, supposing they get truth to start with!  Come, Karlsefin, begin our voyage for us.\"  All present seemed to agree to that proposal, and urged Karlsefin to begin at once.  The skipper--for such indeed was his position in the ship--though a modest man, was by no means bashful, therefore, after looking round upon the moonlit sea for a few minutes, he began as follows:--    \"When western waves were all unknown,   And western fields were all unsown,   When Iceland was the outmost bound   That roving viking-keels had found--   Gunbiorn then--Ulf Kraka's son--   Still farther west was forced to run   By furious gales, and there saw land   Stretching abroad on either hand.   Eric of Iceland, called the Red,   Heard of the news and straightway said--   `This western land I'll go and see;   Three summers hence look out for me.'   He went; he landed; stayed awhile,   And wintered first on `Eric's Isle;'   Then searched the coast both far and wide,   Then back to Iceland o'er the tide.   `A wondrous land is this,' said he,   And called it Greenland of the sea.   Twenty and five great ships sailed west   To claim this gem on Ocean's breast.   With man and woman, horn and hoof,   And bigging for the homestead roof.   Some turned back--in heart but mice--   Some sank amid the Northern ice.   Half reached the land, in much distress,   At Ericsfiord and Heriulfness.   Next, Biarne--Heriulf's doughty son--   Sought to trace out the aged one.  [His father.]   From Norway sailed, but missed his mark;   Passed snow-topped Greenland in the dark;   And came then to a new-found land--   But did not touch the tempting strand;   For winter winds oppressed him sore   And kept him from his father's shore.   Then Leif, the son of Eric, rose   And straightway off to Biarne goes,   Buys up his ship, takes all his men,   Fares forth to seek that land again.   Leif found the land; discovered more,   And spent a winter on the shore;   Cut trees and grain to load the ship,   And pay them for the lengthened trip.   Named `Hella-land' and `Markland' too,   And saw an island sweet with dew!   And grapes in great abundance found,   So named it Vinland all around.   But after that forsook the shore,   And north again for Greenland bore.   And now--we cross the moonlit seas   To search this land of grapes and trees   Biarne, Thorward, Karlsefin--   Go forth this better land to win,   With men and cattle not a few,   And household gear and weapons too;   And, best of all, with women dear,   To comfort, counsel, check, and cheer.   Thus far we've made a prosp'rous way,   God speed us onward every day!\"  They all agreed that this was a true account of the discovery of Vinland and of their own expedition as far as it had gone, though Gudrid said it was short, and Freydissa was of opinion that there was very little in it.  \"But hold!\" exclaimed Biarne, suddenly raising himself on his elbows; \"Karlsefin, you are but a sorry skald after all.\"  \"How so?\" asked the skipper.  \"Why, because you have made no mention of the chief part of our voyage.\"  \"And pray what may that be?\"  \"Stay, I too am a skald; I will tell you.\"  Biarne, whose poetical powers were not of the highest type, here stretched forth his hand and said:--    \"When Biarne, Thorward, Karlsefin,   This famous voyage did begin,   They stood upon the deck one night,   And there beheld a moving sight.   It made the very men grow pale,   Their shudder almost rent the sail!   For lo! they saw a mighty whale!   It drew a shriek from Olaf brave,   Then plunged beneath the briny wave,   And, while the women loudly shouted,   Up came its blundering nose and spouted.   Then underneath our keel it went,   And glared with savage fury pent,   And round about the ship it swum,   Striking each man and woman dumb.   Stay--one there was who found a tongue   And still retained her strength of lung.   Freydissa, beauteous matron bold,   Resolved to give that whale a scold!   But little cared that monster fish   To gratify Freydissa's wish;   He shook his tail, that naughty whale,   And flourished it like any flail,   And, ho! for Vinland he made sail!\"  \"Now, friends, was not that a great omission on the part of Karlsefin?\"  \"If the whale had brought his flail down on your pate it would have served you right, Biarne,\" said Freydissa, flushing, yet smiling in spite of herself.  \"I think it is capital,\" cried Olaf, clapping his hands--\"quite as good as the other poem.\"  Some agreed with Olaf, and some thought that it was not quite in keeping with Karlsefin's composition, but, after much debate, it was finally ruled that it should be added thereto as part and parcel of the great Vinland poem.  Hence it appears in this chronicle, and forms an interesting instance of the way in which men, for the sake of humorous effect, mingle little pieces of fiction with veritable history.  By the time this important matter was settled it was getting so late that even the most enthusiastic admirer among them of moonlight on a calm sea became irresistibly desirous of going to sleep.  They therefore broke up for the night; the women retired to their cabin, and none were left on deck except the steersman and the watch.  Long before this the saga-tellers on the forecastle had retired; the monotone and the soft lowing of the cattle had ceased; man and beast had sought and found repose, and nothing was heard save the ripple of the water on the ship's sides as she glided slowly but steadily over the sleeping sea.    CHAPTER SIX.  CHANGES IN WIND AND WEATHER PRODUCE CHANGES IN TEMPER AND FEELING--LAND DISCOVERED, AND FREYDISSA BECOMES INQUISITIVE.  There are few things that impress one more at sea than the rapidity of the transitions which frequently take place in the aspect and the condition of vessel, sea, and sky.  At one time all may be profoundly tranquil on board; then, perhaps, the necessity for going \"about ship\" arises, and all is bustle; ropes rattle, blocks clatter and chirp, yards creak, and seamen's feet stamp on the deck, while their voices aid their hands in the hauling of ropes; and soon all is quiet as before.  Or, perhaps, the transition is effected by a squall, and it becomes more thorough and lasting.  One moment everything in nature is hushed under the influence of what is appropriately enough termed a \"dead calm.\"  In a few seconds a cloud-bank appears on the horizon and one or two cats-paws are seen shooting over the water.  A few minutes more and the sky is clouded, the glassy sea is ruffled, the pleasant light sinks into a dull leaden grey, the wind whistles over the ocean, and we are--as far as feeling is concerned--transported into another, but by no means a better, world.  Thus it was with our adventurers.  The beautiful night merged into a \"dirty\" morning, the calm into a breeze so stiff as to be almost a gale, and when Olaf came out of the cabin, holding tight to the weather-bulwarks to prevent himself from being thrown into the lee-scuppers, his inexperienced heart sank within him at the dreary prospect of the grey sky and the black heaving sea.  But young Olaf came of a hardy seafaring race.  He kept his feelings to himself; and staggered toward Karlsefin, who still stood at his post. Olaf thought he had been there all night, but the truth was that he had been relieved by Biarne, had taken a short nap, and returned to the helm.  Karlsefin was now clad in a rough-weather suit.  He wore a pair of untanned sealskin boots and a cap of the same material, that bore a strong resemblance in shape and colour to the sou'-westers of the present day, and his rough heavy coat, closed up to the chin, was in texture and form not unlike to the pilot-cloth jackets of modern seamen--only it had tags and loops instead of buttons and button-holes. With his legs wide apart, he stood at the tiller, round which there was a single turn of a rope from the weather-bulwarks to steady it and himself.  The boy was clad in miniature costume of much the same cut and kind, and proud was he to stagger about the deck with his little legs"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21753"],["title","The Norsemen in the West (#8)"],["body","wide apart, in imitation of Thorward and Biarne, both of whom were there, and had, he observed, a tendency to straddle.  \"Come hither, Olaf; and learn a little seamanship,\" said Karlsefin, with a good-humoured smile.  Olaf said he would be glad to do that, and made a run towards the tiller, but a heavy plunge of the ship caused him to sheer off in quite a different direction, and another lurch would have sent him head-foremost against the lee-bulwarks had not Biarne, with a laugh, caught him by the nape of the neck and set him against Karlsefin's left leg, to which he clung with remarkable tenacity.  \"Ay, hold on tight to that, boy,\" said the leg's owner, \"and you'll be safe.  A few days will put you on your sea-legs, lad, and then you won't want to hold on.\"  \"Always hold your head up, Olaf, when you move about aboard ship in rough weather,\" said Biarne, pausing a minute in his perambulation of the deck to give the advice, \"and look overboard, or up, or away at the horizon--anywhere except at your feet.  You can't see how the ship's going to roll, you know, if you keep looking down at the deck.\"  Olaf acted on this advice at once, and then began to question Karlsefin in regard to many nautical matters which it is not necessary to set down here, while Biarne and Thorward leaned on the bulwarks and looked somewhat anxiously to windward.  Already two reefs of the huge sail had been taken in, and Biarne now suggested that it would be wise to take in another.  \"Let it be done,\" said Karlsefin.  Thorward ordered the men to reef; and the head of the ship was brought up to the wind so as to empty the sail while this was being done.  Before it was quite accomplished some of the women had assembled on the poop.  \"This is not pleasant weather,\" observed Gudrid, as she stood holding on to her husband.  \"We must not expect to have it all plain sailing in these seas,\" replied Karlsefin; \"but the dark days will make the bright ones seem all the brighter.\"  Gudrid smiled languidly at this, but made no reply.  Freydissa, who scorned to receive help from man, had vigorously laid hold of the bulwarks and gradually worked her way aft.  She appeared to be very much out of sorts--as indeed all the women were.  There was a greenish colour about the parts of their cheeks that ought to have been rosy, and a whitey blue or frosted appearance at the points of their noses, which damaged the beauty of the prettiest among them.  Freydissa became positively plain--and she knew it, which did not improve her temper.  Astrid, though fair and exceedingly pretty by nature, had become alarmingly white; and Thora, who was dark, had become painfully yellow.  Poor Bertha, too, had a washed-out appearance, though nothing in the way of lost colour or otherwise could in the least detract from the innocent sweetness of her countenance.  She did not absolutely weep, but, being cold, sick, and in a state of utter wretchedness, she had fallen into a condition of chronic whimpering, which exceedingly exasperated Freydissa.  Bertha was one of those girls who are regarded by _some_ of their own sex with a species of mild contempt, but who are nevertheless looked upon with much tenderness by men, which perhaps makes up to them for this to some extent.  Gudrid was the least affected among them all by that dire malady, which appears to have been as virulent in the tenth as it is in the nineteenth century, and must have come in with the Flood, if not before it.  \"Why don't you go below,\" said Freydissa testily, \"instead of shivering up here?\"  \"I get so sick below,\" answered Bertha, endeavouring to brighten up, \"that I thought it better to try what fresh air would do for me.\"  \"H'm! it doesn't appear to do much for you,\" retorted Freydissa.  As she spoke a little spray broke over the side of the ship and fell on the deck near them.  Karlsefin had great difficulty in preventing this, for a short cross-sea was running, and it was only by dint of extremely good and careful steering that he kept the poop-deck dry.  In a few minutes a little more spray flew inboard, and some of it striking Bertha on the head ran down her shoulders.  Karlsefin was much grieved at this, but Freydissa laughed heartily.  Instead of making Bertha worse, however, the shock had the effect of doing her a little good, and she laughed in a half-pitiful way as she ran down below to dry herself.  \"It serves you right,\" cried Freydissa as she passed; \"I wish you had got more of it.\"  Now Karlsefin was a man whose temper was not easily affected, and he seldom or never took offence at anything done or said to himself; but the unkindness of Freydissa's speech to poor Bertha nettled him greatly.  \"Get behind me, Gudrid,\" he said quickly.  Gudrid obeyed, wondering at the stern order, and Karlsefin gave a push to the tiller with his leg.  Next moment a heavy sea struck the side of the ship, burst over the bulwarks, completely overwhelmed Freydissa, and swept the deck fore and aft--wetting every one more or less except Gudrid, who had been almost completely sheltered behind her husband.  A sail which had been spread over the waist of the ship prevented much damage being done to the men, and of course all the water that fell on the forecastle and poop ran out at the scupper-holes.  This unexpected shower-bath at once cleared the poop of the women. Fortunately Thora and Astrid had been standing to leeward of Biarne and Thorward, and had received comparatively little of the shower, but Freydissa went below with streaming hair and garments,--as Biarne remarked,--like an elderly mermaid!  \"You must have been asleep when that happened,\" said Thorward to Karlsefin in surprise.  \"He must have been sleeping, then, with his eyes open,\" said Biarne, with an amused look.  Karlsefin gazed sternly towards the ship's head, and appeared to be attending with great care to the helm, but there was a slight twinkle in his eye as he said--\"Well, it _was_ my intention to wash the decks a little, but more spray came inboard than I counted on.  'Tis as dangerous to play with water, sometimes, as with fire.\"  \"There is truth in that,\" said Biarne, laughing; \"and I fear that this time water will be found to have kindled fire, for when Freydissa went below she looked like the smoking mountain of Iceland--as if there was something hot inside and about to boil up.\"  Karlsefin smiled, but made no reply, for the gale was increasing every moment, and the management of the ship soon required the earnest attention of all the seamen on board.  Fortunately it was a short-lived gale.  When it had passed away and the sea had returned to something like its former quiescent state, and the sun had burst through and dissipated the grey clouds, our female voyagers returned to the deck and to their wonted condition of health.  Soon after that they came in sight of land.  \"Now, Biarne,\" said Karlsefin, after the look-out on the forecastle had shouted \"Land ho!\" \"come, give me your opinion of this new land that we have made.--Do you mind the helm, Thorward, while we go to the ship's head.\"  The two went forward, and on the forecastle they found Olaf; flushed with excitement, and looking as if something had annoyed him.  \"Ho, Olaf! you're not sorry to see land, are you?\" said Biarne.  \"Sorry! no, not I; but I'm sorry to be cheated of my due.\"  \"How so, boy?\"  \"Why, _I_ discovered the land first, and that fellow there,\" pointing to the man on look-out, \"shouted before me.\"  \"But why did you not shout before _him_?\" asked Karlsefin, as he and Biarne surveyed the distant land with keen interest.  \"Just because he took me unawares,\" replied the boy indignantly.  \"When I saw it I did not wish to be hasty.  It might have turned out to be a cloud, or a fog-bank, and I might have given a false alarm; so I pointed it out to him, and asked what he thought; but instead of answering me he gaped with his ugly mouth and shouted `Land ho!'  I could have kicked him.\"  \"Nay, Olaf; that is not well said,\" observed Karlsefin, very gravely; \"if you _could_ have kicked him you _would_ have kicked him.  Why did you not do it?\"  \"Because he is too big for me,\" answered the boy promptly.  \"So, then, thy courage is only sufficient to make thee kick those who are small enough,\" returned Karlsefin, with a frown.  \"Perhaps if you were as big as he you would be afraid to kick him.\"  \"That would not I,\" retorted Olaf.  \"It is easy for you to say that, boy, when you know that he _would_ not strike you now, and that there is small chance of your meeting again after you have grown up to prove the truth of what you say.  It is mere boasting, Olaf; and, mark me, you will never be a brave man if you begin by being a boastful boy.  A truly brave and modest man--for modesty and bravery are wont to consort together--never says he will strike until he sees it to be right to do so.  Sometimes he does not even go the length of speaking at all, but, in any case, having made up his mind to strike, he strikes at once, without more ado, let the consequences be what they will.  But in my opinion it is best not to strike at all.  Do you know, Olaf; my boy, some of the bravest men I ever knew have never struck a blow since they came to manhood, excepting, of course, when compelled to do so in battle; and _then_ they struck such blows as made shields and helmets fly, and strewed the plain with their foes.\"  \"Did these men never boast when they were boys?\" asked Olaf; with a troubled air.  Karlsefin relaxed into a smile as he said, \"Only when they were very little boys, and very foolish; but they soon came to see how contemptible it is to threaten and not perform; so they gave up threatening, and when performance came to be necessary they found that threats were needless.  Now, Olaf, I want you to be a bold, brave man, and I must lull you through the foolish boasting period as quickly as possible, therefore I tell you these things.  Think on them, my boy.\"  Olaf was evidently much relieved "]]]
