They had just rounded one of those rocky bluffs which so frequently interrupted their view during their upward journey, and had come upon a scene which they could not find words adequately to describe.  As interjectional phrases alone could indicate something of their emotions to each other, so fragmentary sentences alone will convey a faint semblance of the truth to the intelligence of the reader.  Mountains, glens, and mighty cliffs; hideous precipices and yawning gulfs; snow-clad summits high above them, and rock-riven gorges far below.  Distance upon distance ranging backward and upward to infinity, where all was mingled with cloudland; sunlit here, darkest shadowed there--wildness, weirdness, grandeur, and magnificence everywhere!  In the immediate foreground the serpentine path wound upward among rugged rocks, and the riders, picking their steps, as it were, midway up the face of a stupendous precipice, looked upward on the left at an apparently summitless wall, and downward on the right into an almost bottomless valley, through which a river roared as if mad with joy at having escaped its glacier-prison; though its roaring was softened well-nigh to silence by distance, while in appearance it seemed little larger than a silver thread.  \"I could almost believe that to be a giant's castle,\" remarked Lawrence, pointing to the opposite side of the ravine, where a huge perpendicular mountain of porphyry was so broken into turrets, towers, and battlements, that it was difficult, except for its size, to believe it other than the work of man.  There were even holes and formations about it that had the appearance of antique windows, gates, and drawbridges!  \"Yes, it is a strange place,\" said the guide, checking his mule; \"moreover, we must spend the night under its shadow, for it is impossible to reach a better place of shelter to-night; and, by good fortune, yonder is something fresh for supper.\"  Pedro pointed to a spot about seven or eight hundred yards distant, where a group of guanacos stood gazing at the intruders with profound attention.  \"How will you get near enough for a shot?\" asked Lawrence; \"they will be gone before you can get across the ravine, and there is little or no cover.\"  \"You shall see,\" said Pedro, cocking his rifle.  \"But--but no weapon short of a cannon will carry so far--at least with accuracy,\" exclaimed Lawrence in surprise, for at the time of which we write breech-loaders and the long-range weapons of precision had not been introduced in those regions.  Indeed, the armies of South America, and of Europe also, still slew each other with the familiar Brown Bess and the clumsy flint-lock at that time.  Pedro paid no attention to the remark, but, dismounting, slowly raised the rifle to his shoulder.  The guide was one of those men who seem to live in advance of their age.  He had thought out, and carried out in a rough-and-ready manner, ideas which have since been scientifically reduced to practice.  Being well aware that any projectile is drawn downward in its flight by the law of gravitation, and that if you want to hit a distant point you must aim considerably above it, he had, by careful experiment, found out how high above an object at a given distance one must aim in order to hit, and, by constant practice in judging distance, as well as in taking aim above his mark, he had attained to such skill as a long-range marksman that his friends almost believed it impossible for game to get beyond the range of his deadly weapon, and foes never felt easy till they were entirely out of his sight.  The comparative slowness, too, of the flint-lock in discharging a rifle, had necessitated in him a degree of steadiness, not only while taking aim, but even after pulling the trigger, which rendered him what we might term statuesque in his action as he levelled his piece.  For a few seconds the rock beside him was not more steady.  Then the cliffs burst into a fusillade of echoes, and the guanacos leaped wildly up the mountain-side, leaving one of their number on the rocks behind them.  It was some time before the young Englishman could get over his astonishment at this feat, for Pedro had pointed his weapon so high that he did not appear to be aiming at the animal at all, and he maintained an animated discussion with the mountaineer until they reached a part of the pass which proved to be somewhat dangerous.  And here they met with a party of muleteers crossing the mountains in the opposite direction.  They were still far above them when first observed descending the same steep and narrow road.  \"We will wait here till they pass,\" said the guide, pulling up at a point where the width of the track was considerable.  \"I see by the escort that they carry something of value--probably bars of silver from one of the mines.  They have reached the worst part of the pass.  I shouldn't wonder to see one of the mules go over--they often do.\"  \"And always get killed, I suppose,\" said Lawrence.  \"Not always.  Now and then they have wonderful escapes, but many hundreds have been lost here.  See!\"  As he spoke one of the baggage-mules of the party touched the cliff with its load.  This caused the animal to stagger; his hind-legs actually went over the precipice, and the loose stones began to roll away from under his hoofs.  With his fore-feet, however, still on the narrow track, he held on bravely, even sticking his nose on the ground, so that he had the appearance of holding on by his teeth!  Two of the peons rushed to render assistance, but before they reached him he had slipped, and rolled down the awful slope which ended in a sheer perpendicular precipice.  Here he bounded off into space, and next moment fell, baggage and all, with a tremendous splash into the river.  It seemed impossible that the poor animal could have escaped with life, but in another moment his head reappeared above water, and he made a brave struggle to gain the bank.  The current, however, was too strong for him.  Down he went below the foaming water, his scraggy tail making a farewell flourish as he disappeared.  But again his head appeared, and once again he struggled for the bank.  This time with success, for he had been swept into a shallow in which he was able to maintain his foothold and slowly drag himself out of the river.  When in safety, he stood with drooping head and tail, as if in a state of the most thorough dejection at having made such an exhibition of himself.  \"Clebber beast!\" shouted Quashy, who had stood with his ten fingers expanded, his great mouth open, and his whole emotional soul glaring out of his monstrous eyes.  \"Well done!\" echoed Lawrence, who was scarcely less pleased than his servant.  The party now drew near, and very striking was their appearance--the variously coloured mules, following the bell-mare which went in advance as a leader, winding slowly down the crooked path, and the peons in their picturesque costumes shouting, laughing, or singing wild snatches of song as they were moved by fury, fun, or fancy.  The men, who numbered a dozen or so, and were well-armed, were apparently relieved to find that our travellers were not bandits, in regard to whom their questions showed that they felt some anxiety.  They had witnessed Pedro's shot from the heights above, and looked upon him with no little surprise and much respect as they commented on his power with the rifle.  A few questions were asked, a few compliments paid, and then the two parties, passing each other, proceeded on their respective ways.  Crossing the mountain torrent at a rather dangerous ford, towards evening Pedro led his companions to a spot not far from the ramparts of what Lawrence styled the giant's castle.  It was not an inviting spot at first.  There was little pasture for the wearied mules on the almost naked rocks, and the stunted trees and gnarled roots told eloquently of the severity of winter in those high regions.  There was, however, a good spring of water and an over-arching rock, which promised some degree of refreshment and shelter, and when firewood was collected, a ruddy blaze sent up, the kettle put on to boil, and several fine cuts of the guanaco set up to roast, the feelings of sadness which had at first influenced Lawrence were put to flight, and he felt more satisfaction in his lodging than he could have experienced if it had been a palatial hotel with its confined air and feather beds and cloying luxuries.  There was a species of natural recess in the cliff which Pedro screened off as a chamber for Manuela, while she assisted Quashy to prepare the supper.  \"There's nothing like fresh mountain air,\" exclaimed Lawrence, with a glow of enthusiasm, after the first attack on the guanaco steaks had subsided.  \"Specially when the said air happens to be quiet and warm, and the night fine and the stars bright and the company pleasant,\" added the guide.  Quashy had a habit, when his risible faculties were only gently tickled, of shutting his eyes, throwing back his head, opening his great mouth wide, and indulging in a silent laugh.  Having done so on the present occasion, he shut his mouth with a snap and opened his eyes.  \"Ho yis,\" he said in a low tone, \"bery nice when it all plisent like now, but it am anoder t'ing when de fresh mountain air goes howlerin' an' bowlerin' about like a wild beast, an' when it snowses an frozes fit to cut off your noses an' shribel up de bery marrow in your bones!

THE WILD KARROO.  A solitary horseman--a youth in early manhood--riding at a snail's pace over the great plains, or karroo, of South Africa.  His chin on his breast; his hands in the pockets of an old shooting-coat; his legs in ragged trousers, and his feet in worn-out boots.  Regardless of stirrups, the last are dangling.  The reins hang on the neck of his steed, whose head may be said to dangle from its shoulders, so nearly does its nose approach the ground.  A felt hat covers the youth's curly black head, and a double-barrelled gun is slung across his broad shoulders.  We present this picture to the reader as a subject of contemplation.  It was in the first quarter of the present century that the youth referred to--Charlie Considine by name--rode thus meditatively over that South African karroo.  His depression was evidently not due to lack of spirit, for, when he suddenly awoke from his reverie, drew himself up and shook back his hair, his dark eyes opened with something like a flash.  They lost some of their fire, however, as he gazed round on the hot plain which undulated like the great ocean to the horizon, where a line of blue indicated mountains.  The truth is that Charlie Considine was lost--utterly lost on the karroo!  That his horse was in the same lost condition became apparent from its stopping without orders and looking round languidly with a sigh.  \"Come, Rob Roy,\" said the youth, gathering up the reins and patting the steed's neck, \"this will never do.  You and I must not give in to our first misfortune.  No doubt the want of water for two days is hard to bear, but we are strong and young both of us.  Come, let's try at least for a sheltering bush to sleep under, before the sun goes down.\"  Animated by the cheering voice, if not by the words, of its rider, the horse responded to the exhortation by breaking into a shuffling canter.  After a short time the youth came in sight of what appeared to be a herd of cattle in the far distance.  In eager expectation he galloped towards them and found that his conjectures were correct.  They were cattle in charge of one of that lowest of the human race, a Bushman.  The diminutive, black-skinned, and monkey-faced creature was nearly naked. He carried a sheepskin kaross, or blanket, on his left shoulder, and a knobbed stick, or \"kerrie,\" in his right hand.  \"Can you speak English?\" asked Considine as he rode up.  The Bushman looked vacant and made no reply.  \"Where is your master's house?\" asked the youth.  A stare was the only answer.  \"Can't you speak, you dried-up essence of stupidity!\" exclaimed Charlie with impatience.  At this the Bushman uttered something with so many klicks, klucks, and gurgles in it that his interrogator at once relinquished the use of the tongue, and took to signs, but with no better success, his efforts having only the effect of causing the mouth of the Bushman to expand from ear to ear.  Uttering a few more klicks and gurgles, he pointed in the direction of the setting sun.  As Considine could elicit no fuller information he bade him a contemptuous farewell and rode away in the direction indicated.  He had not gone far when a dark speck became visible on the horizon directly in front.  \"Ho!  Rob,\" he exclaimed, \"that looks like something--a bush, is it?  If so, we may find water there, who knows--eh?  No, it can't be a bush, for it moves,\" he added in a tone of disappointment.  \"Why, I do believe it's an ostrich!  Well, if we can't find anything to drink, I'll try to get something to eat.\"  Urging his jaded steed into a gallop, the youth soon drew near enough to discover that the object was neither bush nor ostrich, but a horseman.  The times of which we write were unsettled.  Considine, although \"lost,\" was sufficiently aware of his whereabouts to understand that he was near the north-eastern frontier of Cape Colony.  He deemed it prudent, therefore, to unsling his gun.  On drawing nearer he became convinced from the appearance of the stranger that he could not be a Kafir.  When close enough to perceive that he was a white man, mounted and armed much like himself, he re-slung his gun, waved his cap in token of friendship, and galloped forward with the confidence of youth.  The stranger proved to be a young man of about his own age--a little over twenty--but much taller and more massive in frame.  He was, indeed, a young giant, and bestrode a horse suitable to his weight.  He was clad in the rough woollen and leathern garments worn by the frontier farmers, or boers, of that period, and carried one of those long heavy flint-lock guns, or \"roers,\" which the Dutch-African colonist then deemed the most effective weapon in the universe.  \"Well met!\" exclaimed Considine heartily, as he rode up.  \"Humph! that depends on whether we meet as friends or foes,\" replied the stranger, with a smile on his cheerful countenance that accorded ill with the caution of his words.  \"Well met, I say again, whether we be friends or foes,\" returned Considine still more heartily, \"for if we be friends we shall fraternise; if we be foes we shall fight, and I would rather fight you for love, hate, or fun, than die of starvation in the karroo.\"  \"What is your name, and where do you come from?\" demanded the stranger.  \"One question at a time, if you please,\" answered the youth.  \"My name is Charles Considine.  What is yours?\"  \"Hans Marais.\"  \"Well, Mr Marais, I come from England, which is my native home.  In the coming I managed to get wrecked in Table Bay, landed at Capetown, joined a frontier farmer, and came up here--a long and roughish journey, as probably you know, and as my garments testify.  On the way I lost my comrades, and in trying to find them lost myself.  For two days nothing in the shape of meat or drink has passed my lips, and my poor horse has fared little better in the way of drink, though the karroo-bush has furnished him with food enough to keep his bones together.  So now, you have my biography in brief, and if you be a man possessed of any powers of sympathy, you will know what to do.\"  The young Dutchman held out his huge hand, which Considine grasped and shook warmly.  \"Come,\" he said, while a slight smile played on his bronzed countenance; \"I have nothing here to give you, but if you will come with me to yon koppie you shall have both meat and drink.\"  The koppie to which he referred was a scarce discernible knoll on the horizon.  Hans Marais seemed to be a man of few words, for he turned and galloped away, without for some time uttering another syllable to his companion. As for Considine, the thought of once more feasting on any sort of meat and drink was so fascinating, in his then ravenous condition, that he cared for nought else, and followed his guide in silence.  Soon the herbage on the plain became more luxuriant, and in half an hour the two horsemen found themselves riding among scattered groups of mimosa bushes, the thorns of which were from three to five inches long, while their sweet fragrance scented the whole atmosphere.  On reaching the ridge of one of the undulations of the plain, Hans Marais drew rein and gazed intently towards the distant horizon.  At the same time Considine's horse pricked up its ears, pawed the ground, and exhibited unwonted signs of a desire to advance.  \"Hallo, Rob!\" exclaimed its master, \"what's wrong with you?\"  \"Your horse has been gifted by his Maker with a power,\" said Hans, \"which has been denied to man.  He scents water.  But before he shall taste it he must help me to procure fresh meat.  Do you see the boks on that koppie?\"  \"Do you mean those white specks like ostrich eggs on the hillock to the right of the big bush?\"  \"The same.  These are springboks.  Ride away down by that hollow till you get somewhat in their rear, and then drive them in the direction of that clump of bushes on our left, just under the sun.\"  Without waiting for a reply Hans rode off at a gallop, and Considine proceeded to obey orders.  A few minutes sufficed to bring him close to the springboks, which beautiful antelopes no sooner observed him than, after one brief gaze of surprise, they bounded away in the direction of the bushes indicated by Hans,--conscious apparently of their superior fleetness, for they seemed in no great haste, but leaped about as if half in play, one and another taking an occasional spring of six feet or more into the air.  As they passed the bushes towards which Considine drove them, a white puff was seen to burst from them, and the huge roer of Hans Marais sent forth its bellowing report.  It seemed as if the entire flock of boks had received an electric shock, so high did they spring into the air.  Then they dashed off at full speed, leaving one of their number dead upon the plain.  When Considine came up he found that Hans had already disembowelled the springbok, and was in the act of fastening the carcase on his horse behind the saddle.  Remounting immediately, the hunter galloped towards a mound, on the top of which the bushes formed a dense brake.  Skirting this till he reached the other side, he pulled up, exclaiming--  \"There, you'll find good water in the hollow; go drink, while I prepare supper on the koppie.\"  Considine went off at once.  Indeed, he could not have done otherwise, for his impatient horse took the bit in its mouth and galloped towards a small pool of water, which was so yellow with mud that it resembled thin pea-soup.  Thirsty though he was, the youth could not help smiling at his new friend's idea of \"good\" water, but he was not in a condition to be fastidious.  Jumping out of the saddle, he lay down on his breast, dipped his lips into the muddy liquid, and drank with as much enjoyment as if the beverage had been nectar--or Bass.  Rob Roy also stood, in a state of perfect bliss, in the middle of the pool, sucking the water in with unwearied vigour.  It seemed as if man and horse had laid a wager"]]]
