As she spoke, she drew from a box at her side a very neat gold watch and chain, and placed it in Dick's hands.  Our hero was so astonished at first that he could scarcely believe that this valuable present was intended for him.  \"Is it for me?\" he asked, hesitatingly.  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Rockwell, smiling pleasantly. \"I hope you will find it of service.\"  \"It is too much,\" said Dick. \"I do not deserve it.\"  \"You must let me be the judge of that,\" said the lady, kindly. \"Here is the key; I nearly forgot to give it to you. I suppose you know how to wind it up?\"  \"Yes,\" said Dick. \"I understand that. I am _very_ much obliged to you.\"  \"You are very welcome. Whenever you look at it, let it remind you that under all circumstances you can rely upon the friendship of Johnny's parents.\"  Dick slipped the watch into a watch-pocket in his vest, for which he had never before had any use, and attached the chain to his button-hole.  \"How beautiful it is!\" he said, in tones of admiration.  \"It was bought at Ball & Black's,\" said Mrs. Rockwell. \"If it should not keep good time, or anything should happen to it, I advise you to take it there, and they will repair it for you.\"  Dick perceived by his new watch that it was nearly ten o'clock, and rose to go. He was kindly invited to renew his visit, and promised to do so. Just as he was leaving the room, Mr. Rockwell handed a sealed envelope to Dick, saying, \"Put this in your pocket, Richard. It will be time enough to open it when you get home.\"  Dick sped home much more quickly than he had come. He thought with delight of Fosdick's surprise when he should see the new watch and chain, and also with pardonable exultation of the sensation he would produce at the table when he carelessly drew out his watch to see what time it was.  When he reached his boarding-house, and went upstairs, he found Fosdick sitting up for him.  \"Well, Dick, what sort of a time did you have?\" he asked.  \"Tip-top,\" said Dick.  \"Who did you see?\"  \"Mr. and Mrs. Rockwell, and two children,--Johnny, the one I fished out of the water, and his sister, Grace. Johnny's a jolly little chap, and his sister is a nice girl.\"  \"Halloa, what's that?\" asked Fosdick, suddenly espying the watch-chain.  \"What do you think of my new watch?\" asked Dick, drawing it out.  \"Do you mean to say it is yours?\"  \"Yes. Mrs. Rockwell gave it to me.\"  \"It's a regular beauty. Mr. Henderson has got one that he paid a hundred dollars for; but it isn't as nice as yours.\"  \"Seems to me I have no end of luck,\" said Dick. \"I'll be a young man of fortun' before I know it.\"  \"People will think you are now, when they see you wear such a watch as that.\"  \"Johnny Nolan'd think I stole it, if he should see it,\" said Dick. \"Poor chap! I wish some luck would come to him. I saw him to-day lookin' just as I used to before I met Frank.\"  \"There's some difference between then and now, Dick.\"  \"Yes. I was a rough chap in them days.\"  \"In those days, Dick.\"  \"In those days, and I don't know but I am now, but I'm trying to improve. With you to help me, I think I'll grow up respectable.\"  \"I hope we both will, Dick. But who's that letter from that you've just taken out of your pocket?\"  \"Oh, I forgot. Mr. Rockwell handed it to me just before I came away, and told me not to open it till I got home. P'r'aps it says that he hasn't no more occasion for my valuable services.\"  \"That isn't very likely, considering the present you have brought home. But open it; I am curious to see what is in it.\"  The envelope was cut open, and a piece of paper dropped out.  Fosdick picked it up, and to his inexpressible amazement ascertained that it was a check on the Park Bank for the sum of one thousand dollars made payable to Richard Hunter, or order.  \"A thousand dollars!\" repeated Dick, overwhelmed with astonishment; \"you're only foolin' me. P'r'aps it's ten dollars.\"  \"No, it's a thousand dollars. Read it yourself if you don't believe it.\"  \"I wish you'd pinch me, Fosdick,\" said Dick, seriously.  \"Certainly, if you wish it.\"  \"That's enough,\" said Dick, hastily. \"I only wanted to make sure I wasn't dreamin'. I can't believe I'm worth a thousand dollars.\"  \"You're a lucky fellow, Dick,\" said Fosdick, \"and you deserve your luck. I'm heartily glad of it.\"  \"About the best luck I ever had was in meeting you,\" said Dick, affectionately. \"I'm goin' to give you half the money.\"  \"No, you're not, Dick. Thank you all the same,\" said Fosdick, decidedly. \"It was meant for you, and you must keep it. I'll get along well enough. If I don't, I know you'll help me.\"  \"But I wish you'd take half the money.\"  \"No, Dick, it wouldn't be right. But your new watch says it's getting late, and we had better go to bed.\"  It was some time before Dick fell asleep. His good luck had so excited him that he found it difficult to calm down sufficiently to sink into a quiet slumber.     CHAPTER VI.  MR. GILBERT IS ASTONISHED.   When Dick woke up in the morning the first thing he thought of was his watch, the next the check which he had received from Mr. Rockwell.  \"I'll go to the bank this morning, and get my money,\" said he.  \"How are you going to invest it, Dick?\" asked Fosdick.  \"I don't know,\" said Dick. \"I'll put it in the savings bank till I decide. That'll make more'n eleven hundred dollars. I didn't use to think I ever'd be worth that, when I slept in boxes and old wagons.\"  \"Eleven hundred dollars at six per cent. interest will yield you sixty-six dollars a year.\"  \"So it will,\" said Dick, \"and all without working. I tell you what, Fosdick, at this rate I'll soon be a man of fortune.\"  \"Yes, if you can make a thousand dollars a day.\"  \"I wonder what old Gilbert'll say when he sees it,\" said Dick.  \"Who's he?\"  \"He's the book-keeper. He aint very fond of me.\"  \"What has he against you?\"  \"He thinks I don't treat him with proper respect,\" said Dick. \"Besides he tried to get his cousin Roswell Crawford in, but he couldn't.\"  \"Then it seems both of us have interfered with Roswell.\"  \"He's got a place now. I guess he's the senior partner by the way he talks.\"  The breakfast-bell rang, and the boys went down to breakfast. Clifton was down already, and was standing in front of stove. Being an observing young man he at once noticed Dick's watch-chain.  \"Halloa, Hunter!\" said he; \"I didn't know you had a watch.\"  \"I didn't know it myself till last night,\" said Dick.  \"Where did you get it?\"  \"It came from Ball & Black's,\" said our hero, willing to mystify him.  \"That's a nice chain,--solid gold, eh?\"  \"Do you think I'd wear anything else?\" asked Dick, loftily.  \"Will you allow me to look at the watch?\"  \"Certainly,\" said Dick, drawing it from his pocket, and submitting it to Clifton's inspection.  \"It's a regular beauty,\" said the young man, enthusiastically. \"Do you mind telling how much you paid for it?\"  \"How much do you think?\"  \"A hundred dollars?\"  \"It cost all of that,\" said Dick, confidently. \"If you see one for sale at that price, just let me know, and I'll buy it for a speculation.\"  \"You must be getting a pretty good salary to buy such a watch as that.\"  \"Pretty good,\" said Dick, carelessly.  Mr. Clifton was rather a shallow young man, who was fond of show, and had a great respect for those who were able to make it. When Dick first came to the boarding-house he looked down upon him as a boy; but now that he proved to be the possessor of an elegant gold watch and chain, and might, therefore, be regarded as in prosperous circumstances, he conceived a high respect for him. The truth was that Clifton himself only got two dollars a week more than Dick, yet he paid eight dollars a week for board, and spent the rest in dress. His reputation among tailors was not the best, being always more ready to order new clothes than to pay for them.  While they were talking the rest of the boarders entered, and breakfast commenced. Miss Peyton was there, of course.  \"How did you find your friends in Madison Avenue last evening, Mr. Hunter?\" she inquired.  \"They were all up and dressed,\" said Dick. \"They sent their partic'lar regards to you.\"  \"Oh, you wicked story-teller!\" simpered Miss Peyton; \"just as if I'd believe such nonsense. Have they got a nice house?\"  \"Beautiful,\" said Dick. \"I haven't seen any like it since I called on Queen Victoria last year.\"  \"How is the house furnished?\"  \"Well,\" said Dick, \"as near as I can remember, there's diamonds worked in the carpet, and all the tables and chairs is of gold. They'd be rather hard to set on if it twan't for the velvet cushions.\"  \"Aint you afraid to tell such stories, Mr. Hunter? Mr. Fosdick, you will have to talk to your friend.\"  \"I am afraid it wouldn't do much good, Miss Peyton, if you fail to cure him.\"  \"Mr. Hunter has just been investing in a handsome watch,\" remarked Clifton, passing his cup for a second cup of coffee.  \"Oh, do let me look at it! I dote on watches,\" said Miss Peyton.  \"Certainly,\" said Dick; and he detached the chain from his button-hole, and passed the watch across the table.  \"It's a perfect little love,\" said Miss Peyton, enthusiastically. \"Isn't it, Mrs. Browning?\"  \"It is very beautiful, certainly,\" said the landlady. She could not help feeling surprised that Dick, who, it will be remembered, had represented himself at his first visit to be in limited circumstances, and now occupied one of her cheapest rooms, could afford to purchase an article which was evidently so costly.  \"Where did you buy it, Mr. Hunter?\" asked another boarder.  \"I did not buy it at all,\" said Dick, deciding to let it be known how it came into his possession. \"It was given to me.\"  \"Perhaps you'll mention my name to the person that gave it to you,\" said Mr. Clifton. \"If he's got any more to dispose of in that way, I should like to come in for one.\"  \"How do you know but it may have come from a _lady_ friend, Mr. Clifton?\" said Miss Peyton, slyly.  \"How is that, Hunter?\"  \"I haven't had any presents"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21632"],["title","Fame and Fortune; or, The Progress of Richard Hunter (#7)"],["body","any of my lady friends yet,\" said Dick. \"Perhaps I may some time.\"  \"You don't mean anybody in particular, of course, Mr. Hunter?\" said Miss Peyton.  \"Oh, no, of course not.\"  This conversation may seem scarcely worth recording, but it will serve to illustrate the character of Dick's fellow-boarders. Miss Peyton was rather silly and affected, but she was good-natured, and Dick felt more at home with her than he would have done had she been a lady like Mrs. Rockwell, for instance. It got to be the custom with Dick and Fosdick to remain in the parlor a short time after supper, or rather dinner, for this was the third meal, and Fosdick joined the young lady in singing. Dick unfortunately had not been gifted by nature with a voice attuned to melody, and he participated only as a listener, in which capacity he enjoyed the entertainment.  After breakfast Dick set out for the store as usual. He felt unusually happy and independent as he walked along. The check in his pocket made him feel rich. He wondered how it would be best to invest his money so as to yield him the largest return. He wisely decided to take Mr. Murdock, the head clerk, into his confidence, and ask his advice upon this point.  When Dick arrived at the store neither Mr. Gilbert nor Mr. Murdock had yet arrived. Half an hour later the latter came, and five minutes after him the book-keeper.  The latter noticed that the morning paper appeared to have been disturbed, and, glad of any opportunity to find fault with Dick, said, angrily, \"So you've been reading the paper instead of minding your work, have you? I'll report you to Mr. Rockwell.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Dick, \"you're very kind. Are you sure I read the paper? Is there any news missin' out of it?\"  \"You're an impudent boy,\" said the book-keeper, provoked. He wanted to overawe Dick; but somehow Dick wouldn't be overawed. Evidently he did not entertain as much respect for the book-keeper as that gentleman felt to be his due. That a mere errand-boy should bandy words with a gentleman in his position seemed to Mr. Gilbert highly reprehensible.  \"You're an impudent boy!\" repeated Gilbert, sharply, finding Dick did not reply to his first charge.  \"I heard you make that remark before,\" said Dick, quietly.  Now there was nothing out of the way in Dick's tone, which was perfectly respectful, and he only stated a fact; but the book-keeper became still more angry.  \"Who rumpled that paper?\" he asked.  \"Suppose you ask Mr. Murdock?\" said Dick.  \"Did he come in here?\" asked Gilbert, cooling down, for it was against Dick that his charge was made, and not against the head clerk. As to the paper, he really cared nothing.  \"Yes,\" said Dick.  \"Then it's all right. I supposed you had been idling your time over the paper. Go and ask Mr. Murdock what time it is. I left my watch at home.\"  \"It's half past eight,\" said Dick, drawing out his watch.  Up to this time the book-keeper had not noticed Dick's watch-chain. Now that his attention was drawn not only to that, but to the beautiful gold watch which Dick carried, he was not a little surprised.  \"Whose watch is that?\" he asked, abruptly.  \"Mine,\" said Dick, briefly, rather enjoying the book-keeper's surprise.  \"How did you come by it?\"  \"Honestly,\" said Dick.  \"Is it gold, or only plated?\"  \"It's gold.\"  \"Humph! Did you buy it, or was it given you?\"  \"Well,\" said Dick, \"I didn't buy it.\"  \"Did you say it was yours?\"  \"Yes.\"  Gilbert looked at Dick in surprise. Our hero was becoming more and more an enigma to him. That a boy in Dick's position should have a gold watch given him, especially now that he had learned from his cousin Roswell the nature of Dick's former employment, seemed indeed wonderful.  \"Let me look at your watch a minute,\" he said.  Dick handed it to him.  \"It seems to be a very good one,\" he said.  \"Yes,\" said Dick; \"I aint proud. It's as good as I want to wear.\"  \"It looks entirely out of place on such a boy as you,\" said the book-keeper, sharply.  \"Perhaps it would look better on you,\" suggested our hero, innocently.  \"Yes, it would be more appropriate for me to wear than you. You're not old enough to be trusted with a watch; least of all with such a good one as that.\"  \"Perhaps you'd be kind enough to mention it to the one that gave it to me.\"  \"Whoever gave it to you didn't show much judgment,\" said Gilbert, in the same pleasant way. \"Who was it?\"  \"It was Mrs. Rockwell.\"  If a bombshell had exploded in the office, it could hardly have taken Gilbert more by surprise.  \"Who did you say?\" he repeated, thinking his ears might have deceived him.  \"Mrs. Rockwell,\" said Dick, once more.  The book-keeper could hardly suppress a low whistle.  \"When did she give it to you?\"  \"Last evening.\"  \"Were you up there?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Did Mr. Rockwell invite you?\"  \"Yes.\"  Just then Dick was called away by Mr. Murdock, who had some work for him to do.  \"There's something mighty queer in all this,\" thought the book-keeper. \"What Mr. Rockwell can see in that boy, I don't understand. He's an impudent young rascal, and I'll get him turned off if it's a possible thing.\"     CHAPTER VII.  A FINANCIAL DISCUSSION.   In the course of the morning Dick called at the Park Bank, and presented the check which was made payable to himself. His employer had accompanied him to the bank on a previous day, and introduced him to the cashier as one who was authorized to receive and pay over money for the firm. Dick therefore found no difficulty in obtaining his money, though the fact that the check was made payable to him created some surprise.  \"Your salary seems to be a large one,\" said the teller, as he handed our hero ten bills of a hundred dollars each.  \"Yes,\" said Dick, \"my services are very valooable.\"  On leaving the bank, Dick went to the savings bank, and presented his book.  \"How much do you wish to deposit?\"  \"A thousand dollars,\" said Dick, briefly.  The bank officer looked at him in surprise.  \"How much did you say?\" he repeated.  \"A thousand dollars.\"  \"No nonsense, young man! My time is too valuable,\" said the other, impatiently.  He was justified in his incredulity, since Dick's deposits hitherto had been in sums of from one to five dollars.  \"If you don't want to take the money, I can go somewhere else,\" said our hero, who was now on his dignity. \"I have a thousand dollars to deposit. Here it is.\"  The bank officer took the money, and counted it over in considerable surprise.  \"Business is improving,--isn't it?\" he said.  \"Yes,\" said Dick. \"I made all that money in one day.\"  \"If you should want a partner, call round and see me.\"  \"All right. I won't forget.\"  Dick took the bank-book, and, putting it in his inside coat-pocket, buttoned up his coat, and hurried back to the store. His reflections were of a very agreeable nature, as he thought of his large deposit in the savings bank, and he could not help feeling that he had been born under a lucky star.  Nothing of consequence transpired in the store that day. Dick was attentive to his duties. He was determined to learn the business as rapidly as possible, not only because he felt grateful to Mr. Rockwell for his kindness, but also because he knew that this was the best thing for his future prospects. Mr. Murdock, who has already been mentioned, was of service to him in this respect. He was himself an excellent business man, and very conscientious in the discharge of his duties. He required the same fidelity of others. He had observed Dick closely, and was attracted towards him by his evident desire to give satisfaction, as well as by his frank, open face. He resolved to help him along, more especially when he saw the manner in which he was treated by the book-keeper. To tell the truth, Mr. Gilbert was not a favorite with Mr. Murdock. He understood his business, to be sure, and, so far as Mr. Murdock knew, kept the books correctly. But personally he was not agreeable, and the head salesman doubted whether his integrity was what it should have been. So, altogether, he made up his mind to help Dick on as well as he could, and take pains to instruct him in the business.  Dick, on his side, was pleased with Mr. Murdock, and determined to make him a confidant in the matter of his sudden accession of fortune.  He took an opportunity, therefore, during the day, to say to him, \"Mr. Murdock, I want to ask your advice about something.\"  \"Well, my lad, what is it?\" said his friend, kindly. \"If it's about choosing a wife, I don't know whether my advice will be good for much.\"  \"It isn't that,\" said Dick. \"Next year'll be soon enough for that.\"  \"So I should think. Well, if it's nothing of that sort, what is it?\"  \"It's about investing some money. I thought you might be able to advise me.\"  \"How much is it?\" asked Mr. Murdock, supposing the sum could not be more than fifty or sixty dollars.  \"Eleven hundred dollars,\" said Dick.  \"How much?\" demanded the salesman, in surprise.  \"Eleven hundred dollars.\"  \"Is it your own?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Of course you couldn't have earned so much. Was it left to you?\"  \"I'll tell you all about it,\" said Dick. \"I wouldn't tell Mr. Gilbert, and I don't mean he shall know it, but I'd just as lieves tell you. Do you know why Mr. Rockwell gave me this place?\"  \"No; I've wondered a little, not at that, but at his giving you so much higher pay than boys usually receive.\"  \"Then I'll tell you.\"  Dick proceeded to give an account of the manner in which he had rescued little Johnny from drowning, as related in the adventures of \"Ragged Dick.\"  \"It was a brave act,\" said Mr. Murdock.  \"It was nothing at all,\" said Dick, modestly. \"I could swim like a duck, and I didn't mind the wetting.\"  \"But you ran the risk of drowning.\"  \"I didn't think of that.\"  \"If you had been a coward or a selfish boy, it would have been the first thing you would have thought of. So Mr. Rockwell gave you this place in acknowledgment of your service. I am glad he did. You deserve it.\"  \"He has done more,\" said Dick. Then he related the events of "]]]
