They do not know we are here.\"  \"Brave Uraso! I hope he will not get into danger,\" said George. \"There they are now; see them on the ridge to--\"  A shot from the direction of Muro now awoke them to action. The moment that sound reached the oncoming savages, they halted, and huddled together, evidently in confusion at the meaning of the new alarm.  \"Ah! they are puzzled!\" Then, after a pause, he continued: \"I hope Muro is not in trouble! I do not understand why his messenger has not returned.\"  Within ten minutes of the report of the gun which has just been referred to, the messenger sent by John, came in and stated that it was impossible for him to reach Muro, as the hill directly to the east was alive with warriors.  It was now Muro's turn to get the sympathy of the boys, and both of them turned to John, who still seemed unperturbed.  \"We will march directly to the east,\" he announced. \"Every man must hold his gun ready for instant firing. Move forward quietly, as you have been doing. We must go to the assistance of Muro. Uraso will take care of the rear.\"  They glided along the crest, directly behind John, and as they passed over the hill, it was evident that the natives were out in force.  \"I wonder whether they have captured Muro?\" asked Harry.  \"No; he is all right. You may depend on it that he will not be taken without a warning shot is given.\"  \"But we heard a shot.\"  \"True; but that was the messenger.\"  From the manner in which the natives in their front were scurrying to and fro, it was apparent to John's practiced mind, they had no idea of the approach of John and his party. It was plain that they knew of Muro, or, at least of some one beyond the second hill, where John inferred Muro must have gone, because all their energies appeared to be directed toward that point.  \"I am afraid they are after Muro, but I am sure if he finds himself in danger he will fire a shot to warn us. In such a situation we must attract their attention. I will detail the first squad to accompany me. All those remaining will conceal themselves, and under no circumstances show yourselves, or let your presence be known, unless you are attacked. We will go to the point beyond the two large trees, and make the demonstration there, thus drawing them away from Muro.\"  John with the six men designated hurried over the intervening ground, just as two shots, undoubtedly from Muro, broke the quiet, and placed the watchers on the alert. In less than ten minutes the boys heard a volley to the right, and almost instantly the opposite slope was alive with natives running to and fro in all directions, and the most peculiar cries were heard, while in the distance there was a singular rhythmic sound as though drums were being beaten, in regular time.  It sounded very weird and fascinating. The drums, if such they were, had different keys, and their companions did not appear to be able to give any information about them.  While thus waiting for John to appear, the watchers were surprised to see the force which was between Uraso and themselves, rushing alongside the hill, and directly toward their place of concealment. Here was a problem, not contemplated by John, and the boys consulted the men with them.  Harry said: \"I will do what has always been our custom, that is first show ourselves, and indicate that we do not wish to be enemies, and try to gain their confidence.\"  \"I think some of the men should try to talk to them. It is possible that they may be acquainted with their language. You remember the one we captured could understand what Muro said,\" suggested George.  It should be stated that after they landed on the island, four days previously, they had made a short excursion into the interior, where they were attacked by a tribe, of which one of the men was captured, after being wounded, and then taken by the Professor on board the _Pioneer_, and carried to Wonder Island.  The savages came forward apparently without knowing of the existence of our party, and when within two hundred feet Harry, and Tarra, one of the most intelligent of the islanders, stepped forward, and waved their hands.  The natives stopped in astonishment. Tarra spoke to them, but they were mute. Then Tarra turned to Harry, and rubbed his nose, and made a sign of friendship. After some hesitation the leader, who was, from all appearance a chief, answered, that they demanded the delivery to them of the wounded man. After this was interpreted Harry assured him that the man would be restored safe and sound, as soon as he was cured.  At this information the Chief told Tarra that he lied, and that he had been taken for the purpose of being sacrificed. He was assured that such was not the case, as they did not believe in sacrificing human beings.  The Chief then demanded that they leave the island at once, or they would kill all of them. Tarra laughed at this announcement, and his demeanor was such as to astound the natives. \"You do not know what you say,\" said Tarra. \"The white people who are with us have fire guns, which kill when they speak,\" and he held up one of them, and the boys were amused to see how quickly they began to waver and look about for shelter.  \"We have not come here to injure you,\" said Tarra. \"We want to be friends.\"  This appeal did not affect the Chief, but seeing his men disappear he silently withdrew to the north. They had scarcely gone before Uraso and his men appeared in the tall grass beyond, and were most heartily welcomed by the boys.  Uraso laughed as he related their experience. He said that the band came up, after John and the party left, and in order to make as big a showing as possible he and his companions hid in the grass, being separated from each other twenty feet or more, thus making a line over a hundred feet in length.  The savages did not know that the entire line was occupied only by seven men. To all appearances the waving of the grass at the different points along the line, indicated to them the presence of a large force. As a result they started for the east, instead of going to the south, as Uraso had calculated they would do, and which indeed they would have done had they not heard the peculiar savage-made signals of the party which was hunting Muro.  The movement of the band in that direction drove them directly toward the watchers who had been left behind by John, and for them to meet a second party, immediately after they left Uraso, must have been a most astonishing thing to them.  But the savages were still more confounded, when, after leaving the boys, they learned from the signals that a third party (the one with John), was still further to the east.  The first evidence the boys had, that the last party had reached the main band of savages, was the recurrence of the same peculiar sounds that were heard during the night.  \"They are telling them that we are all over the island. They are worried about the situation,\" said Uraso. \"John purposely took the men forward in order to create the impression that our people might be found everywhere.\"  \"Did you hear the shots that Muro fired?\" asked George.  \"Yes; they were on all sides of him, undoubtedly, but I am satisfied he is all right now.\"  \"What makes you think so?\"  \"For the reason that the natives are retreating, and dare not attack him. The last signs were those indicating danger. They were entirely different from those sent out last night.\"  The peculiar drum beats ceased. Only occasionally could the plaintive signal cry be heard, and after waiting for more than half hour, the boys were delighted to see John and Muro appear on the distant hill, accompanied by the men who were detailed with him.  Muro's story was an interesting one. He went directly east for a distance of nearly two miles, passing between two different parties, who were, of course, unaware of his presence. He sent the messenger back when he met the first natives, and when this messenger was on his way back he found the savages before him, and they made a rush which he stopped by the shot which John and the boys heard.  After he had passed the second lot of natives he ascended the second hill, and beheld, far in the east, the open sea. This, he knew, was a matter of prime importance to them, as he felt assured it could not be more than five miles distant.  While investigating the shore line, in order to select some particular marking point, by means of which they might be able to direct the _Pioneer_, he was surrounded by the natives. Not that they knew he was at that particular place, but, as he was now near the rocky headland which he was seeking, it occurred to him that they might be going on the same mission, and before he could extricate himself a small band intercepted him.  He told them that they were friends and not enemies, and tried to win them over by promises of reward. For some reason or other they declined to treat with him, and he then had to resort to the rifle to impress them with the invisible power which he possessed.  This was done by the two shots which the boys heard. They were of course awed by the explosion, and by the effect of the shots, and since it did not seem to bring about the desired results, he coolly marched away, and told them that they dared not follow him.  His bravery undoubtedly proved his salvation, for they were too much astounded to move at his audacity. He did not go far, because he knew that his safety lay in keeping himself concealed, since he felt assured that it would not be long before John would resort to some device to attract their attention.  His calculations were justified, for within a quarter of an hour he heard the volley which John ordered, and in an in creditable short space of time the woods were cleared of the watching natives, who, undoubtedly, were on the alert to capture him.  \"The boys "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21810"],["title","The Wonder Island Boys: Treasures of the Islands (#5)"],["body","with me to the foot of the hill,\" said John. \"I knew Muro would fire three shots if he were in danger. When we were half way up the hill, we saw the natives stealthily moving around the hill, as though trying to encircle the position among the rocks. It was enough to indicate to me that Muro was the one they were stalking.  \"We did not shoot at the natives, but intended it merely as a warning. It was sufficient, for they made for cover at once, and within ten minutes we heard Muro's signal, and found him safe.\"  \"But isn't that fine about the sea?\" said Harry with enthusiasm.  \"Yes; and that means we must now send a message to the landing place. Muro, did you see enough of the shore line to enable you to describe it?\" asked John.  \"I was not near enough to tell exactly, but I believe it is directly east of our landing place, but, of course, on the opposite side of the island,\" was his response.  \"That will be near enough. Our work is on this side of the island. As soon as we have quieted down a little you will hear some news,\" said John as he glanced at the boys significantly.  The runner was directed to proceed to the landing place, and to remain there during the night. He was then to return the first thing in the morning, and would find the party camped at the rocky height beyond.  Without waiting for further explanations, and details of experiences, they started for the place where they might find some shelter from the numerous foes, and at which place they might be able to formulate a plan to get into communication with the natives.  It was late in the afternoon when they gained the rocky heights, and saw the wild nature of the surroundings.  \"How did you know this place was here?\" asked Harry.  [Illustration: _Fig. 1. The Marimba._]  \"I was here day before yesterday, and it was from this place we started when we heard your first guns in the battle you had with the natives,\" was John's answer.  \"But how does it happen that you did not see the ocean?\"  \"Well, are you able to see the ocean anywhere from this point?\" he was asked.  The question was a natural one, for when Muro came over the last hill to the south the sea was visible, but the rocky point was to the north, and thus out of range.  \"Did you hear the singular drum-like sounds this afternoon?\"  \"They were drums,\" answered John, \"and most peculiar ones, too. I have not seen the ones used by the natives here, but they have the same resonant sounds made by certain African tribes, and also by some South American savages.\"  \"What is it like?\" was Harry's next question.  \"They are made of flat pieces of wood, very thin, laid over open-topped gourds. The gourds are, of course, dried, and the dryer they are, the more resonant the sound.\"  \"Why, that is something like the Xylophone.\"  \"Exactly so. That instrument is of savage origin. Instead of gourds some tribes use calabashes, which grow to enormous size, and they are highly prized owing to the quality of the sound they produce when used in this way.\"  \"But the ones we heard had different tones.\"  \"They use wooden strips of different lengths, exactly like the Xylophone. They are called Marimbas, balafongs and sansas, by the various tribes.\"  While George, Harry and Uraso, were scouting to the north they unexpectedly came around the corner of a hill, from which they could see a beautiful valley running to the north, and directly opposite, on a little plateau, was a type of mountain deer, standing like a sentinel near the precipitous edge, while below were dozens feeding.  The boys dared not shoot at them, but they remembered the place, and made up their minds that as soon as they had made friends of the natives they would have a hunt in this section.     CHAPTER III  CAPTURE OF THE VILLAGE   The most trying time for all adventurers and explorers, is after night has set in. During the daytime there is always plenty to take up one's attention and energies, but as the sun goes down the world seems to contract into a very small space, and when enemies are near the burden of waiting is a doubly trying one.  The boys had spent many such nights. Whenever John or the Professor were about these hours were always enjoyed, because like all healthy boys, they were ever on the alert to ask questions which happened to be suggested by the experiences of the day.  Now, it is a singular thing, that there is no selfishness in education. True education is charitable. Those who crave it with the most eagerness, are always the foremost in wishing to impart it to others. The honest learner does not resent the listening ear of his fellow pupils.  Uraso and Muro, the two chiefs, who were the first to conceive the advantages of education at the hands of John and the Professor, were always on the alert at the evening meetings, whenever their duties permitted it, and hundreds of the natives of Wonder Island craved the privilege of hearing the conversations which took place on all sorts of topics.  In Unity, the capital of Wonder Island, schools had been established and were flourishing, and all the children were pupils, so that within another generation there would be a tremendous change for the better among those people.  There was nothing more enjoyable to the boys than to see the intense interest manifested by the common natives, when night came on, and they expected one of the treats which they knew would be in store for them.  On these occasions George and Harry were usually the questioners, but many times they saw that some of the men seemed to desire additional information, and by degrees the boys encouraged them to put the questions, and to seek inquiries.  This had a very stimulating effect. John was delighted at the spirit thus developed, and he gave it a still broader range by refusing sometimes to answer the questions, and thus inviting answers from the men themselves.  Thus discussion developed. It taught them to begin to think for themselves. If men know that the ready answer is always at hand, it prevents the mind from expanding. The evenings, therefore, were seasons of enjoyment, alike to the men as well as to the boys.  After they had reached the cove in the rocks, and all the dispositions had been made for the night, John warned the men that while the natives were no doubt, in consternation, the utmost care must be observed to prevent any surprises.  The moon had not yet arisen, but there was a beautiful clear sky. The great Southern Cross hung in the heavens like a giant lantern. On one side, and on line with each other, shone the two brightest stars in the heavens, the first being the Dog Star Sirius, and the next in order, Canopus, the one white, and the other a yellowish white.  Then, on the other side of the Great Cross, sparkled Antares, the brilliant red star, of the first magnitude, while Spica, another star made up a most remarkable combination of heavenly orbs.  George had always been impressed with the appearance and the arrangement of the stars, and he was struck by the intense interest which all savages manifested in astronomy.  \"Your observations are correct,\" said John, when the discussion began. \"Almost all of the savage rites, their feasts and religious ceremonials, have something to do with the appearances and the movements of the heavenly bodies.\"  \"I suppose the grouping of the stars, when they named these groups of the planets after animals, and the like, was done by the ancients, and really meant something in a religious way,\" ventured Harry.  \"It is difficult really to determine the origin of what is called the Zodiac. From the evidence attainable it was known to the Babylonians, over 2300 years before the Christian era. They divided the heavens into twelve parts, each cluster of stars representing some fanciful animal or being, such as the Lion, or the Bear, or the Dragon.\"  \"Isn't it funny that the tribes here, as well as some on Wonder Island have an idea that the dark moon is caused by the Great Spirit trying to hide it in anger?\" asked George.  \"It is singular when it is considered that the same superstition is found in many, many tribes, on different continents, and it induces the belief that this idea had one common origin, and that the people all sprang from one source, or, that the different peoples worked out the ideas independently of each other.\"  This statement caused considerable discussion, the natives being of the opinion that the idea was worked out by the different peoples and could not have been spread broadcast by one set of people.  \"Why do you think it could not have come from one race?\" asked George, as Uraso urged.  \"Because,\" he answered, \"how did the people in olden times cross the big ocean? Even now, people like my own, dare not venture on the sea, for any distance from shore.\"  \"But,\" said John, \"the surface of the earth was not originally like it is now. In many places over the earth, new lands have appeared,--that is, they come up out of the sea, and other lands have disappeared. We have records of islands, and parts of continents, hundreds of times larger than Wonder Island, which have disappeared in a single day. One of those, near Japan, sank, and engulfed over 200,000 people.\"  \"You surprise me,\" said Muro.  \"Furthermore, there is pretty conclusive evidence that the continents of Europe and America, were once joined, or that there was an immense continent, called Atlantis between the eastern and western hemispheres.\"  \"I read something on that subject some time ago, in which the writer denied that such a thing was possible,\" said Harry.  [Illustration: _Fig. 2. The Atlantean Plateau._]  \"I am aware of that, but there are some things which are difficult to explain, unless the two hemispheres were once united, or, at any rate, were close enough together to permit travel from one part to the other.\"  \"What evidence is there on that point?\"  \"Well, in the first place, the root of the languages in Central America, and in Mexico, are the same as in the"]]]
