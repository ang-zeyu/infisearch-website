The whole is under the direction and superintendence of a chief factor, or chief trader.  As the winter is very long (nearly eight months), and the summer very short, all the transport of goods to, and returns from, the interior must necessarily be effected as quickly as possible.  The consequence is, that great numbers of men and boats are constantly arriving from the inland posts, and departing again, during the summer; and as each brigade is commanded by a chief factor, trader, or clerk, there is a constant succession of new faces, which, after a long and dreary winter, during which the inhabitants never see a stranger, renders the summer at York Factory the most agreeable part of the year.  The arrival of the ship from England, too, delights those inhabitants of the wilderness with letters from _home_, which can only be received twice a year-- namely, at the time now alluded to, by the ship; and again in December, when letters and accounts are conveyed throughout the interior by means of sledges drawn by men.  The fort (as all establishments in the Indian country, whether small or great, are sometimes called) is a large square, I should think about six or seven acres, enclosed within high stockades, and planted on the banks of Hayes River, nearly five miles from its mouth.  The houses are all of wood, and, of course, have no pretension to architectural beauty; but their clean, white appearance and regularity have a pleasing effect on the eye.  Before the front gate stand four large brass field-pieces; but these warlike instruments are only used for the purpose of saluting the ship with blank cartridge on her arrival and departure, the decayed state of the carriages rendering it dangerous to load the guns with a full charge.  The country, as I said before, is flat and swampy, and the only objects that rise very prominently above the rest, and catch the wandering eye, are a lofty \"outlook,\" or scaffolding of wood, painted black, from which to watch for the arrival of the ship; and a flagstaff, from whose peak, on Sundays, the snowy folds of St. George's flag flutter in the breeze.  Such was York Factory in 1841; and as this description is sufficient to give a general idea of the place, I shall conclude it, and proceed with my narrative.  Mr Grave, the chief factor then in charge, received us very kindly, and introduced us to some of the gentlemen standing beside him on the wharf. Mr Carles, being also a chief factor, was taken by him to the _commissioned gentlemen's house_; while Wiseacre and I, being apprentice clerks, were shown the young gentlemen's house--or, as the young gentlemen themselves called it, Bachelors' Hall--and were told to make ourselves at home.  To Bachelors' Hall, then, we proceeded, and introduced ourselves.  The persons assembled there were--the accountant, five clerks, the postmaster, and one or two others.  Some of them were smoking, and some talking; and a pretty considerable noise they made. Bachelors' Hall, indeed, was worthy of its name, being a place that would have killed any woman, so full was it of smoke, noise, and confusion.  After having made ourselves acquainted with everybody, I thought it time to present a letter of introduction I had to Mrs Grave, the wife of the gentleman in charge, who received me very kindly.  I was much indebted to this lady for supplying me with several pairs of moccasins for my further voyage, and much useful information, without which I should have been badly off indeed.  Had it not been for her kindness, I should in all probability have been allowed to depart very ill provided for the journey to Red River, for which I was desired to hold myself in readiness.  Young Wiseacre, on the other hand, learned that he was to remain at York Factory that winter, and was placed in the office the day after our arrival, where he commenced _work_ for the first time.  We had a long and sage conversation upon the subject the same evening, and I well remember congratulating him, with an extremely grave face, upon his having now begun to _do for himself_.  Poor fellow! his subsequent travels in the country were long and perilous.  But let us pause here a while.  The reader has been landed in a new country, and it may be well, before describing our voyage to Red River, to make him acquainted with the peculiarities of the service, and the people with whom he will in imagination have to associate.    CHAPTER THREE.  DESCRIPTION OF THE HUDSON BAY COMPANY--THEIR FORTS AND ESTABLISHMENTS-- FOOD--ARTICLES OF TRADE AND MANNER OF TRADING.  In the year 1669, a Company was formed in London, under the direction of Prince Rupert, for the purpose of prosecuting the fur-trade in the regions surrounding Hudson Bay.  This Company obtained a charter from Charles the Second, granting to them and their successors, under the name of \"The Governor and Company of Adventurers trading into Hudson's Bay,\" the sole right of trading in all the country watered by rivers flowing into Hudson Bay.  The charter also authorised them to build and fit out men-of-war, establish forts, prevent any other company from carrying on trade with the natives in their territories, and required that they should do all in their power to promote Discovery.  Armed with these powers, then, the Hudson Bay Company established a fort near the head of James Bay.  Soon afterwards, several others were built in different parts of the country; and before long the Company spread and grew wealthy, and eventually extended their trade far beyond the chartered limits.  With the internal economy of the Company under the superintendence of Prince Rupert, however, I am not acquainted; but as it will be necessary to the reader's forming a correct idea of the peculiarities of the country and service, that he should know something of its character under the direction of Sir George Simpson, I shall give a brief outline of its arrangements.  Reader, you will materially assist me in my description if you will endeavour to draw the following landscape on the retina of your mind's eye.  Imagine an immense extent of country, many hundred miles broad and many hundred miles long, covered with dense forests, expanded lakes, broad rivers, wide prairies, swamps, and mighty mountains: and all in a state of primeval simplicity--undefaced by the axe of civilised man, and untenanted by aught save a few roving hordes of Red Indians and myriads of wild animals.  Imagine amid this wilderness a number of small squares, each enclosing half a dozen wooden houses and about a dozen men, and between each of these establishments a space of forest varying from fifty to three hundred miles in length; and you will have a pretty correct idea of the Hudson Bay Company's territories, and of the number of and distance between their forts.  The idea, however, may be still more correctly obtained by imagining populous Great Britain converted into a wilderness and planted in the middle of Rupert's Land.  The Company, in that case, would build _three_ forts in it--one at the Land's End, one in Wales, and one in the Highlands; so that in Britain there would be but three hamlets, with a population of some thirty men, half a dozen women, and a few children!  The Company's posts extend, with these intervals between, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, and from within the Arctic Circle to the northern boundaries of the United States.  Throughout this immense country there are probably not more ladies than would suffice to form half a dozen quadrilles; and these--poor banished creatures!--are chiefly the wives of the principal gentlemen connected with the fur-trade.  The rest of the female population consists chiefly of half-breeds and Indians; the latter entirely devoid of education, and the former as much enlightened as can be expected from those whose life is spent in such a country.  Even these are not very numerous; and yet without them the men would be in a sad condition, for they are the only tailors and washer-women in the country, and make all the mittens, moccasins, fur caps, deer-skin coats, etcetera, etcetera, worn in the land.  There are one or two favoured spots, however, into which a missionary or two have penetrated; and in Red River Settlement (the only colony in the Company's territories) there are several churches and clergymen, both Protestant and Roman Catholic.  The country is divided into four large departments: the Northern department, which includes all the establishments in the far north and frozen regions; the Southern department, including those to the south and east of this, the post at the head of James Bay, and along the shores of Lake Superior; the Montreal department, including the country in the neighbourhood of Montreal, up the Ottawa River, and along the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Esquimaux Bay; and the Columbia department, which comprehends an immense extent of country to the west of the Rocky Mountains, including the Oregon territory, which, although the Hudson Bay Company still trade in it, now belongs to the Americans.  These departments are divided into a number of districts, each under the direction of an influential officer; and these again are subdivided into numerous establishments, forts, posts, and outposts.  The name of _fort_, as already remarked, is given to all the posts in the country; but some of them certainly do not merit the name--indeed, few of them do.  The only two in the country that are real, _bona fide_ forts, are Fort Garry and the Stone Fort in the colony of Red River, which are surrounded by stone walls with bastions at the corners.  The others are merely defended by wooden pickets or stockades; and a few,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21758"],["title","Hudson Bay (#6)"],["body","the Indians are quiet and harmless, are entirely destitute of defence of any kind.  Some of the chief posts have a complement of about thirty or forty men; but most of them have only ten, five, four, and even _two_, besides the gentleman in charge.  As in most instances these posts are planted in a wilderness far from men, and the inhabitants have only the society of each other, some idea may be formed of the solitary life led by many of the Company's servants.  The following is a list of the forts in the four different departments, as correctly given as possible; but, owing to the great number in the country, the constant abandoning of old and establishing of new forts, it is difficult to get at a perfectly correct knowledge of their number and names:--  NORTHERN DEPARTMENT.    York Fort (the depot).   Churchill.   Severn.   Oxford House.   Trout Lake House.   Norway House.   Nelson River House.   Berens River House.   Red River Colony.   Fort Garry.   Stone Fort.

Flat-head Post.   Nisqually.   Alexandria.   Fort Chilcotin.   Fort James.   Fort Fluz Cuz.   Babine Lake.   And an agency in the Sandwich Islands.  There are seven different grades in the service.  First, the labourer, who is ready to turn his hand to anything; to become a trapper, fisherman, or rough carpenter at the shortest notice.  He is generally employed in cutting firewood for the consumption of the establishment at which he is stationed, shovelling snow from before the doors, mending all sorts of damages to all sorts of things, and, during the summer months, in transporting furs and goods between his post and the nearest depot.  Next in rank is the interpreter.  He is, for the most part, an intelligent labourer, of pretty long standing in the service, who, having picked up a smattering of Indian, is consequently very useful in trading with the natives.  After the interpreter comes the postmaster; usually a promoted labourer, who, for good behaviour or valuable services, has been put upon a footing with the gentlemen of the service, in the same manner that a private soldier in the army is sometimes raised to the rank of a commissioned officer.  At whatever station a postmaster may happen to be placed, he is generally the most useful and active man there.  He is often placed in charge of one of the many small stations, or outposts, throughout the country.  Next are the apprentice clerks--raw lads, who come out fresh from school, with their mouths agape at the wonders they behold in Hudson Bay.  They generally, for the purpose of appearing manly, acquire all the bad habits of the country as quickly as possible, and are stuffed full of what they call fun, with a strong spice of mischief.  They become more sensible and sedate before they get through the first five years of their apprenticeship, after which they attain to the rank of clerks.  The clerk, after a number of years' service (averaging from thirteen to twenty), becomes a chief trader (or half-shareholder), and in a few years more he attains the highest rank to which any one can rise in the service, that of chief factor (or shareholder).  It is a strange fact that three-fourths of the Company's servants are Scotch Highlanders and Orkneymen.  There are very few Irishmen, and still fewer English.  A great number, however, are half-breeds and French Canadians, especially among the labourers and _voyageurs_.  From the great extent, and variety of feature, in the country occupied by the fur-traders, they subsist, as may be supposed, on widely different kinds of food.  In the prairie, or plain countries, animal food is chiefly used, as there thousands of deer and bisons wander about, while the woods are stocked with game and wild-fowl.  In other places, however, where deer are scarce and game not so abundant, fish of various kinds are caught in the rivers and lakes; and in other parts of the country they live partly upon fish and partly upon animal food. Vegetables are very scarce in the more northern posts, owing to the severity of the winter, and consequent shortness of summer.  As the Company's servants are liable, on the shortest notice, to be sent from one end of the continent to another, they are quite accustomed to change of diet;--one year rejoicing in buffalo-humps and marrow-bones, in the prairies of the Saskatchewan, and the next devouring hung white-fish and scarce venison, in the sterile regions of Mackenzie River, or varying the meal with a little of that delectable substance often spoken of by Franklin, Back, and Richardson as their only dish--namely, _tripe-de-roche_, a lichen or moss which grows on the most barren rocks, and is only used as food in the absence of all other provisions.  During the first years of the Company, they were much censured for not carrying out the provision contained in the royal charter, that they should prosecute Discovery as much as possible; and it was even alleged that they endeavoured to prevent adventurers, not connected with themselves, from advancing in their researches.  There is every reason to believe, however, that this censure was undeserved.  A new company, recently formed in a wild country, could not at first be expected to have time or funds to advance the arduous and expensive cause of Discovery.  With regard to their having impeded the attempts of others, it is doubtful whether any one in the service ever did so; but even had such been the case, the unauthorised and dishonourable conduct of one or two of their servants does not sanction the condemnation of the whole Company.  Besides, the cause of Discovery was effectively advanced in former days by Herne, and in later years by Dease and Simpson, Dr Rae, and others; so that, whatever might have been the case at first, there can be no doubt that the Company have done much for the cause of late years.  The trade carried on by the Company is in peltries of all sorts, oil, dried and salted fish, feathers, quills, etcetera.  A list of some of their principal articles of commerce is subjoined:--    Beaver-skins.   Bear-skins, Black.   Bear-skins, Brown.   Bear-skins, White or Polar.   Bear-skins, Grizzly.   Badger-skins.   Buffalo or Bison Robes (see note below).   Castorum, a substance procured from the body of the beaver.   Deer-skins, Rein.   Deer-skins, Red.   Deer-skins, Moose or Elk.   Deer-skins, parchment.   Feathers of all kinds.   Fisher-skins.   Fox-skins, Black.   Fox-skins, Silver.   Fox-skins, Cross.   Fox-skins, Red.   Fox-skins, White.   Fox-skins, Blue.   Goose-skins.   Ivory (tusks of the Walrus).   Lynx-skins.   Marten-skins.   Musquash-skins.   Otter-skins.   Oil, Seal.   Oil, Whale.   Swan-skins.   Salmon, salted.   Seal-skins.   Wolf-skins   Wolverine-skins.  Note.  The hide of the bison--or, as it is called by the fur-traders, the buffalo--when dressed on one side and the hair left on the other, is called a robe.  Great numbers are sent to Canada, where they are used for sleigh wrappers in winter.  In the Indian county they are often used instead of blankets.  The most valuable of the furs mentioned in the above list is that of the _black fox_.  This beautiful animal resembles in shape the common fox of England, but it is much larger, and jet-black, with the exception of one or two white hairs along the back-bone and a pure white tuft on the end of the tail.  A single skin sometimes brings from twenty-five to thirty guineas in the British market; but, unfortunately, they are very scarce. The _silver fox_ differs from the black fox only in the number of white hairs with which its fur is sprinkled; and the more numerous the white hairs, the less valuable does it become.  The _cross fox_ is a cross between the black or silver and the red fox.  The _red fox_ bears a much inferior fur to the other kinds; yet it is a good article of trade, as this species is very numerous.  These four kinds of foxes are sometimes produced in the same litter, the mother being a red fox.  The _white fox_ is of less value than the red, and is also very numerous, particularly on the shores of Hudson Bay.  The variety termed the _blue fox_ is neither numerous nor valuable.  It is of a dirty bluish-grey colour, and seldom makes its appearance at the Company's posts.  Beaver, in days of yore, was the staple fur of the country; but, alas! the silk hat has given it its death-blow, and the star of the beaver has now probably set for ever--that is to say, with regard to men; probably the animals"]]]
