Every moment the position of the ship was becoming more dangerous as the advancing tide drove her in among the small rocks at the back of the sea-wall, and no boat could live in the terrible surge that was fast breaking up the vessel.  The crew, four in number, along with the pilot, took to the fore-rigging, and in a short time the beach was strewn with pieces of the wreck--the bulwarks were nearly all destroyed--the boat washed overboard--and the deck broken up.  Though only forty yards from the pier, not the least assistance could be rendered to the crew, whose faces were quite distinguishable as they clung to the swaying rigging.  At twenty minutes past six the fore-mast cracked, and its living freight had hardly time to crawl down to the only bulwark above water (for the schooner now lay on her beam-ends with her bilge towards the sea), when it fell by the board.  In about five minutes more the main-topmast was snapped by the gale as if it had been a reed, while the bowsprit and other gear were carried away, leaving nothing but the gutted hull with the mainmast standing.  Another hour of awful suspense passed, during which the five men lashed themselves to the bulwark, the sea every other minute breaking over their heads in huge masses.  At half-past seven, one of the sailors, a young man, was washed from the wreck, but fortunately succeeded in catching the floating rigging, by which he was able to regain his former position. Another young heroic sailor seemed to be the life of the whole company in this trying emergency, and his efforts to keep up the spirits of his companions were signally successful.  About eight o'clock the waves broke over the ship with renewed violence, but still those on the shore could return no answer in the affirmative to the piercing cry that came from the wreck, \"Can't we get a boat?\"  The voice was that of the gallant sailor already referred to; the others were too much exhausted to utter a word.  McIntosh, the pilot from Burghead, expired from sheer cold and exhaustion.  None who saw him perish soon forgot the fearful agony of his daughter as she bade her father farewell from the parapet of the breakwater.  After renewed efforts a boat was got over the breakwater, and at great risk succeeded in saving the other men, who were in a very exhausted condition.'  \"And now, dear madam,\" pursued the old gentleman, tying up his papers, \"I will not run the risk of wearying you with more details, but come to the point at once by soliciting from you a contribution towards the establishment of a lifeboat on the coast here, where I am sure you must be well aware there is very great need for one.\"  \"I am sure there is,\" said Mrs Foster, opening her box; \"alas!  I fear the wind is rising even now.  The rattling of the window-frames will bring what you have told me to remembrance ever after this night.  How much does it require to establish a lifeboat?\"  \"Between five and six hundred pounds,\" replied Mr Summers.  \"After which about twenty pounds annually will suffice to maintain it in working order.\"  \"So much!\" exclaimed Mrs Foster.  \"I fear that you will find it difficult to raise so large a sum.\"  \"I trust not, but if we raise a pretty large proportion of it, the Lifeboat Institution will make up the balance.  Perhaps\"--here the old gentleman paused and looked dubiously at Mrs Foster--\"perhaps you would like to know the precise nature of the objects for which the Lifeboat Institution has been founded.  Will you do me the favour to listen for five minutes longer?  The operations of the Institution are of deep importance to the national welfare.\"  Mrs Foster at once expressed her willingness to listen, and the old gentleman, re-opening his bundle of papers, selected one from which he read sundry interesting details regarding the National Lifeboat Institution.  It need scarcely be said, that with such a sympathetic mind to address as that of Mrs Foster, Mr Summers prolonged his visit for another hour, and it is perhaps equally unnecessary to say that the worthy lady found a suitable object on which to bestow the sovereign which had perplexed her so much at an earlier part of the evening.  She not only gave the money with the air of a \"cheerful giver,\" but she begged Mr Summers to send her as many papers on the subject of lifeboats and wrecks as he happened to be possessed of, and promised to become an active agent in pleading with her friends in behalf of the object he had in view.  The wind was rising while the party in Sandhill Cottage were thus engaged.  It came in ominous and heavy gusts, rattling the window-frames and moaning in the chimneys to such an extent that Mrs Laker, who was of a timid and superstitious nature, was fain to sit outside the parlour door in order to be near the other inmates of the cottage.  \"About a thousand lives lost in each year on the shores of this kingdom!\" thought Mrs Foster, as she lay in bed that night listening to the rising storm with feelings of awe and solemnity which she had never before experienced.  If Mrs Foster had been acquainted with the subject in detail, she might have had further food for solemn reflection in the fact that the greater part of those lives were lost _unnecessarily_; that their loss was owing not nearly so much to the direct providence of God as to the incompetence, the ignorance, the false economy, and the culpable carelessness of man.  Mrs Foster's head lay on a soft pillow while the tempest raged around her humble dwelling.  She little thought that one around whom her heart-strings were entwined was out on the wild sea that night, exposed to its utmost fury and in urgent need of the aid of that species of boat which had filled her thoughts that evening, and still continued to influence her dreams.    CHAPTER FIVE.  THE GALE--FALSE ECONOMY AND ITS RESULTS--A WRECK ON THE GOODWIN SANDS.  What seamen style a \"whole gale\" seemed to be brewing when the \"Nancy\" tripped her anchor and shook out her sails.  Sailors have a quiet, matter-of-fact, and professional way of talking about the weather.  Landsmen would be surprised (perhaps something more!) if exposed to what Jack calls a stiff breeze, or a capful of wind.  A \"whole gale\" may sound peculiar to some ears, but if the said gale were to sound _in_ the same ears, the hearers would be apt to style it, in consternation, \"a most tremendous hurricane!\"  On board the \"Nancy,\" Bax and Bluenose had some suspicion that _something_ was brewing, but whether a \"whole gale,\" or \"half a gale,\" or a \"stiff breeze,\" they could not be expected to divine, not being possessed of supernatural gifts.  Had they been possessed of a good barometer they would have been able to foretell what was coming without supernatural gifts; but Messrs. Denham, Crumps, and Company were economical in their tendencies, and deemed barometers superfluous.  Being, to some extent, ignorant of nautical affairs (as well as of scientific), and being to a large extent indifferent to the warning voices of those who knew better, they thought fit to intrust the \"Nancy\" to the unaided wisdom of the intelligent young seaman who commanded her.  Of course, being acute men of business, they took every \"needful\" precaution, and being men of experience, they were not blind to the fact that many vessels were annually lost; they therefore insured schooner and cargo to their full value.  Having done so, Messrs. Denham, Crumps, and Company felt at ease.  If the \"Nancy\" should happen to go down--no matter; it would perhaps be a more rapid and satisfactory way of terminating a doubtful venture!  It was just possible that in the event of the \"Nancy\" going down _lives_ might be lost, and other lives rendered desolate.  What then?  The \"Firm\" had nothing to do with that! The lives embarked in the \"Nancy\" did not belong to Denham, Crumps, and Company.  If they should go to the bottom, there would be nothing to lose, and nothing to pay; perhaps a trifle to the widows and children, that was all!  In regard to this also they felt quite at ease.  On the strength of such views and opinions the tackling of the \"Nancy\" was allowed to become rotten; the cables and the anchors of the \"Nancy\" were economically weak and insufficient; the charts of the \"Nancy\" were old and inaccurate, and the \"Nancy\" herself was in all respects utterly unseaworthy.  It could scarcely be expected, however, that the operations of Nature were to be suspended because of the unprepared condition of this vessel; not to mention hundreds of others in similar condition.  The gale continued to \"brew.\"  A stiff breeze carried the \"Nancy\" down the Thames towards the open sea; then a sudden calm left her to float without progressive motion on the water.  As evening approached the breeze sprang up again and freshened.  Then it chopped round to the east, and when night fell it began to blow hard right in the teeth of the little vessel.  Bax was a good and a bold seaman.  He knew the coast well, and hoped, in due course, to double the North Foreland, and find shelter in the Downs. He knew the channels and buoys thoroughly, and had often run the same course in stormy weather.  But the gale which now began to buffet the little schooner was of more than ordinary violence.  It was one of those fierce hurricanes which, once in a year, or, it may be, once in three or four years, bursts upon our island, strews the coast with wrecks, fills many homes and hearts with desolation, and awakens the inhabitants of the inland counties to a slight sense of the terrible scenes that are of constant occurrence on the shores which form the bulwark of their peaceful homes.  \"We shall have rough weather to-night, I fear,\" observed Mr Burton, coming on deck some time after sunset, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21744"],["title","The Lifeboat (#8)"],["body","Bax; \"doubtless you know the channels well, young sir?\"  \"I do,\" replied the sailor, with a peculiar smile.  \"Twelve years' experience has not been altogether thrown away on me.  I have sailed these waters in old Jeph's lugger since I was a little boy.\"  \"Is that old Jeph the smuggler, sometimes called the mad philosopher, from the circumstance of his mind being much taken up with odd notions about lifeboats?\" inquired the missionary.  \"The same,\" replied Bax, \"though I'll go bound for it there's not an honester man in Deal than old Jeph is now, whatever he may have done in the smuggling way when he was young.  I have known him only as a good old man; and in regard to these same notions he has about lifeboats, it's my firm belief that we'll see his plans, or something like them, carried out before long.  He's not so mad as folk think, and certainly not half so mad as the people who give no thought whatever to these subjects.\"  Bax said this warmly, for there was a strong bond of sympathy between him and his old friend, whom he could not bear to hear mentioned in a slighting manner.  \"I meant not to say a word against old Jeph,\" replied Mr Burton, quickly.  \"I merely spoke of him in the way in which seamen in these parts commonly refer to him.  It pleases me much to hear so good a character of him from one who, I have no doubt, has had good opportunity of judging.\"  Here Guy Foster, who was standing near the binnacle, turned round and said earnestly:--  \"I can testify to the fact that old Jeph is a good Christian man; at least if love to our Saviour, and anxiety for the salvation of souls, is to be accepted as evidence.\"  The missionary said that there was no better evidence than that, and was about to question Bax further in regard to the old man who bore such a peculiar character, when a loud peal of thunder drew the attention of all to the threatening aspect of the weather.  \"Heave the lead, Bill!\" cried Bax to one of the men.  \"Ha! that's wot I've been lookin' for,\" observed Bluenose, spitting his quid over the lee bulwarks, and replacing it with a fresh one.  \"I've never got no confidence in a skipper as don't keep his lead a-goin' in shoal water.  Specially in sich waters as them 'ere, wot shifts more or less with every gale.\"  The command to heave the lead was followed by an order to reduce sail, and as the gale freshened and the night closed in, this order was repeated more than once, until the schooner was beating to windward under the smallest possible amount of canvas.  An anxious expression rested on Bax's face as he stood by the steersman, glancing alternately at the sails and at the horizon where clouds of the blackest kind were gathering.  \"Does your barometer indicate very bad weather?\" inquired Mr Burton.  \"I have no barometer,\" replied Bax, bitterly.  The missionary looked surprised, and Guy Foster bit his lip, for he felt that this piece of false economy was a blot on the firm to which he belonged.  In order to change the subject, he inquired for Lucy, who, since the time of her rescue, had remained in bed.  \"My daughter does well, thanks be to God!\" said Burton.  \"I think that no evil will flow from her accident, for she was but a short time in the water; thanks to _you_, friend Bax.\"  \"And to my 'prentice, Tommy Bogey,\" said Bax, with an arch smile which was peculiar to him when he felt humorously disposed.  The smile fled, however, and was replaced by an anxious look, as Tommy himself came aft and reported that the schooner had sprung a leak.  Bax instantly went below, and returned with the assurance that the leak was trifling.  \"The `Nancy' is a sorry old hulk,\" said he, \"but half an hour more on this tack, and I'll 'bout ship and run for the Downs, where we will be comparatively safe.\"  The gale had by this time increased so much that the little craft lay over with her lee bulwarks almost under water at times.  Little fear would her gallant commander have felt had she been tight, and trim and sound; but he knew that her rigging was old, and one of her masts unsound, and he felt that the best seamanship could be of no avail whatever against her numerous defects.  His experienced eye told him that a storm of no ordinary severity was coming, and he trembled for the life of the young girl who had been so unexpectedly placed under his care.  Had the dangers attendant upon an unseaworthy vessel and the difficulty of navigating the channels of these celebrated Sands, been all that Bax had to fear, he would have felt comparatively at ease; but the economical spirit of Denham, Crumps, and Company had supplied him with anchors and chains which he feared were neither new enough nor sufficiently powerful to hold his vessel after she had gained her anchorage-ground.  In these circumstances, he resolved to run for the shelter of Ramsgate Harbour.  Before he could carry out his intentions the wind chopped round to the north, and for some time blew so hard as to threaten the capsizing of the schooner.  The cross sea also rendered her almost unmanageable, so that, ere long, she was driven to leeward of the outer lightship that marks the north end of the Goodwins.  Again the wind shifted a few points to the eastward, and soon the \"Nancy\" was flying like a racehorse towards the shore.  Pilots and seamen alone can properly comprehend the peculiar dangers that attend the navigation of this part of our coast.  It would only perplex a landsman to be told in detail the proceedings of the \"Nancy\" and her crew after this point.  Suffice it to say that Bax handled her with consummate skill, and did all that man could do for the safety of his vessel, and the human lives that were dependent on his knowledge and care.  \"Is your daughter dressed?\" inquired Bax of Mr Burton, as a fiercer gust than usual nearly laid the schooner on her beam-ends, and deluged the decks with water.  \"No, she sleeps soundly, and I am loth to disturb her.  Do you think we are in much danger?\"  \"In none, if the schooner were seaworthy, but in much, seeing that she has not got a sound plank or spar.  Go down, sir, and get her dressed at once; and, harkee, let her put on every wrap she happens to have with her.\"  The missionary needed no second bidding.  He went below to rouse and assist Lucy, while Bluenose, Guy, and the rest of those on board, held on to ropes, and belaying pins, and awaited the result in silence.  The noise of the wind, and the peals of thunder that seemed to tear the heavens asunder, rendered conversation impossible.  They all felt that a few minutes would decide whether this terrible rush landward would terminate in safety or disaster, and they knew that everything, as far as human skill had to do with it, depended on Bax.  With a look of calm, sober gravity the young seaman stood grasping the weather-shrouds of the mainmast, and looking intently towards the light-ship called the Gull Light, which is anchored off the North-sand-head.  During this period of suspense the lead was kept constantly going, and reported almost every half-minute.  Precious, significant, half-minutes those, as much so as are the last few grains of sand in the hour-glass!  \"Keep her away two points,\" cried Bax.  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" answered the steersman.  At that moment a violent gust snapped the topsail-yard, and the sail was instantly blown to ribbons. The dashing of this spar about carried away the foretop-mast, and almost as a necessary consequence, the jib with the jib-boom went along with it.  The schooner instantly became unmanageable, and was driven bodily to leeward.  Seizing an axe, Bax, with the prompt assistance of the crew and his friends, soon cleared away the wreck, and once more got the head of his vessel round towards the Gull Light, the lanterns of which were seen faintly gleaming through the murky atmosphere.  But it was too late. The breakers of the North-sand-head were already roaring under their lee, and also right ahead of them.  \"Port! port! hard a-port!\" shouted Bax.  \"Port it is,\" replied the steersman, with that calm professional sing-song tone peculiar to seamen.  At that instant, the schooner struck the sand, passed over the first line of breakers, and rushed onwards to certain destruction.  \"Bring Lucy on deck,\" cried Bax.  Mr Burton ran below to obey, but the words had scarce been spoken when Guy Foster entered the cabin, and seizing the trembling girl in his arms, bore her gently but swiftly to the deck.  Here the scene that met her gaze was truly awful.  It seemed as if above and below there were but one wild chaos of waters over which brooded a sky of ebony.  The schooner had by this time got into the hideous turmoil of shallow water, the lurid whiteness of which gleamed in the dark like unearthly light.  As yet the vessel was rushing fiercely through it, the rudder had been carried away by the first shock, and she could not be steered.  Just as Lucy was placed by Bax in a position of comparative shelter under the lee of the quarter-rails, the \"Nancy\" struck a second time with fearful violence; she remained hard and fast on the sands, and the shock sent her foremast overboard.  If the condition of the little vessel was terrible before, its position now was beyond description awful.  The mad seas, unable to hurl her onward, broke against her sides with indescribable fury, and poured tons of water on the deck; so that no one could remain on it.  Having foreseen this, Bax had prepared for it.  He had warned all on board to keep close by the main shrouds, and take to the mast when the schooner should strike.  He himself bore Lucy aloft in his strong arms as if she had been a little child, and placed her on the main cross-trees.  Here she clung with a convulsive grasp to the main-topmast, while Guy secured her in her position with a rope.  Sitting down on the cross-trees and holding on to them by his legs--a matter of no little difficulty, as the vessel was rolling violently from side to side, Bax began to strip off"]]]
