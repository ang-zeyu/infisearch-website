George was the first one to get a hatchet. He soon chopped a way through, and Uraso was the first to crawl into the enclosure, followed by George.  The latter staggered back, as he saw the scene before him. The enclosure was fully fifteen feet high, and occupied a space, probably, twenty feet each way. It was constructed of a species of bamboo, exceedingly hard, two rows of these paling being driven into the ground close together, so that it was impossible to see through the stockade at any point.  Within there was absolutely nothing but the bare ground, and a mass of indescribable filth, as may be imagined. Here, lying on the earth, were five men, with little or no clothing, covered with dirt and vermin. Two of them were in fairly good condition, an evidence that they had not long been prisoners.  [Illustration: \"_'Stop!' cried John, 'It will be death for any one to touch him'_\" [See p. 52]]  The other three were emaciated, and what surprised the boys most was the long, matted and tangled beard of one of the three. The moment John saw that form he turned to the boys and fairly shrieked: \"This is a white man. Cut down that fence, so the men can be taken out, and the moment they are removed set fire to this place.\"  The boys could not understand John's vehement expression.  \"Shall we burn the village?\" asked Harry.  \"Oh, no! Burn only this enclosure, and don't let a vestige of it remain.\"  His orders were quickly carried out. Meanwhile, not a quarter of a mile away, were the Chief and the owners of the village, who, upon seeing the smoke and the flames, appeared to be frantic. No doubt they regarded it as a sign that the village was doomed, but they were soon reassured by the time the stockade was finally consumed, and the few watchers reported to the Chief that nothing but the prison had been destroyed.  \"We have destroyed the Bastille,\" remarked John, \"and must now take care of the prisoners.\" They found that it was indeed a white man who had been rescued. He was frightfully emaciated, and too weak to talk.  This was also the condition of the two natives. The other two were soon restored, after receiving nourishment, and were ready to tell their story. They had been taken two weeks previously in a battle with the tribe to the north.  Through these men they learned that there were only two tribes on the island, and that this was by far the largest, in point of numbers. There had been continual war between the two people, and the only thing which saved his tribe from extermination was the fact that they lived in the mountain regions, and were thus protected.  This information was very welcome to John and the boys. The mountains seemed to have a fascination for them,--and then, the caves, how could they forget them now?  For three hours the Chief and his people waited in the distance. John did not pay any attention to them, apparently. Shortly thereafter two of his men came in, dragging one of the former patients.  \"We saw him trying to steal away,\" said one of the men.  \"Was he going toward his people?\" asked John.  \"Yes.\"  \"Then let him go, by all means, and tell him that we would be glad to have the Chief and his people return.\"  The poor fellow was astonished to learn that he was free. He was as much surprised at this as at the care which they had bestowed to cure him. He passed through the village, looking about him with furtive glances, but, at the command of John, no one paid any attention to him.  When he reached the Chief there was a long consultation, and it was evident that a momentous change was taking place. The Chief could be seen constantly glancing toward the village, and soon the self-imposed messenger returned and approached John.  \"The Chief is willing to see you, and will come to you, if you wish it.\" This was imparted to John, and the latter responded:  \"I will go with you.\"  He called the two chiefs Muro and Uraso, and the boys, and told them he would go with the messenger to the Chief, alone, and that they should have no fear for him.  Accompanied by the messenger, John walked boldly to the Chief, and going up, pressed his nose against him, in token of eternal friendship, and then motioned him to go back to the village.  The Chief was astounded, first, at the bravery of John in thus coming to him, and in then vowing eternal friendship.  There is something very peculiar in the characteristics of savages which forbids them from violating a peace pledge, or a treaty of friendship when entered into with the rites that they acknowledge. The most formal of these rites, is that of rubbing noses together.  How the custom originated, is not known. It is something like the kiss, in so far as it is a visible token of either love, friendship, or esteem. It is seldom that the savage violates the pledge which is thus given. John knew this, and felt assured the great Chief would respect it.  When the latter came into the village, the first sight that met his eyes, was the demolished stockade. He looked at it for a moment, in silence. Then some of the old men came forward, and began to tell him the wondrous tales of kindness.  The Chief went to his own home, and when he saw that everything was untouched, and that none of the people was harmed, he could not understand the actions of the White Chief, and so expressed his astonishment to Uraso and Muro. When he was told that the latter were Chiefs of two tribes on Wonder Island, he was still more surprised.  \"Do you not fight each other?\" he asked.  Uraso smiled, as he answered: \"Why should we fight? There is no pleasure in killing, or in causing suffering. We used to think about those things as you do.\"  \"What made you think otherwise?\"  \"The White Chief told us it was wrong, and we have found that his words were true.\"  \"Where is this place where your tribe may be found?\"  \"It is on the other side of the sea, over there,\" answered Uraso, pointing to the west.  \"Will it take long to get there?\"  \"It takes only one sun, and the White Chief would be so happy to take you there and show you the great village, and to see the people and the Chiefs who live together in happiness, and to learn from the people themselves how they enjoy their homes, and make the many curious things that the White Chief has brought over for you.\"  The Chief looked about him, and finally said: \"I want to see the White Chief.\"  John had purposely refrained from going to the Chief's home, but Uraso accompanied him at John's request, because he was the more diplomatic, and wielded a stronger influence than Muro, owing to his remarkable personality.  John was glad of the opportunity, and the boys, as usual, were also present. The Chief's eyes followed the two boys, as they entered. He smiled at them, as John came up and greeted him.  Uraso told John what they had talked about, and that the Chief was interested in his story of Wonder Island.  \"Our Great Chief will welcome you to Wonder Island,\" said John.  The Chief looked at John for a moment, and then his eyes wandered to Uraso, as he answered: \"Is there still a greater Chief? Is there a man more powerful than this Chief?\"  Uraso laughed, as did John. \"Tell him,\" said John, \"that our Chief is powerful, because he is wise.\"  He did not seem to understand this, and asked for more information. Uraso told him that the white man did not regard the strong man as the greatest, but that the wisest man was always the Chief.  Here was certainly a new philosophy. \"But,\" he inquired, \"then how can he rule his people, if he is not strong?\"  \"The people willingly submit to his will because they know what he says is best for them.\"  \"But does not the Chief sometimes tell them lies, and does he not often deceive them?\"  \"Yes; but when they do so then the people choose another Chief in his place.\"  \"And after they have killed the first Chief, and have taken another, and he lies, do they also kill him?\"  \"No; they do not kill the Chiefs, but they only put others in their places.\"  \"Then they are not wise Chiefs?\"  \"No; they are wise only when they do what is right.\"  \"Do what is right! What do you mean by that? How can the Chief do anything but right?\"  \"Do you think,\" asked Uraso, \"that the Chief has a right to lie or deceive?\"  \"Yes, he can do that, but not his people. It is wrong for them to do so.\"  \"But the white man believes that it is just as wrong for the Chief to lie and to deceive, as for the people to do so.\"  The Chief was silent for a long time, and John purposely permitted him to reflect on the new dispensation. While thus musing on the new theory, a woman carrying a child appeared at the door. John saw her, and, stepping out, took the child from her arms. She permitted it, and when the Chief appeared she fell down and explained that the White Chief had been very kind to her.  John took some medicine from a small vial, and administered it, the Chief meanwhile looking on in astonishment. Here was a great White Chief, looking out for the comfort of one of the poorest of his people.  Uraso knew his thoughts. This woman was the poorest and the lowest in the tribe, and John, without stopping to make any inquiries as to her condition, or position in life, had aided her and her old mother.  Evidently the new doctrine was something so extraordinary, that it was worth investigating. Uraso saw the embarrassment in the mind of the Chief, and after speaking a few words, withdrew.  As they left the Chief's quarters the boys roamed through the village. The stories of the sufferers which John had aided, the scrupulous care with which the men guarded the homes of the villagers while they were absent, had a most telling effect.  The warriors from Wonder Island mingled with the villagers. It was singular that there was not an expression of hatred. They fraternized, and related stories of Wonder Island, and the people told them about their own island.  The boys met many of their own ages, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21823"],["title","The Butterfly's Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast (#0)"],["body","Butterfly's Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast, by R.M.

Many of these, and certainly the earlier ones, were written under the pseudonym of Comus, but this one went out under his own name, perhaps because by the time it was published in 1874 his own name had become much more celebrated than that of his pseudonym.  It was written for very young children, and very amusing they must have found it, with its characters being the little insects and small mammals of the fields and woods, who assemble together for a feast.  Naturally they must have become vegetarian for the day! Anyway, they put away their warring instincts, and had a good time together, though one or two incidents caused by the over exuberant during the dancing, threatened to cause serious mishaps, though all were avoided.  It's a tiny book, perhaps a twentieth of the size of one of Ballantyne's novels for older children, but it is certainly fun.  ________________________________________________________________________  THE BUTTERFLY'S BALL AND THE GRASSHOPPER'S FEAST, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE. The Butterfly's Ball--by RM Ballantyne    CHAPTER ONE.  THE BUTTERFLY'S BALL AND THE GRASSHOPPER'S FEAST.    Come, take up your hats, and away let us haste   To the Butterfly's ball and the Grasshopper's feast;   For the trumpeter Gadfly has summoned his crew,   And the revels are now only waiting for you.    On the smooth-shaven grass by the side of the wood,   Beneath a broad oak that for ages has stood,   See the children of earth, and the tenants of air,   For an evening's amusement together repair.    And there came the Beetle, so blind, and so black,   Who carried the Emmet, his friend, on his back;   And there came the Gnat, and the Dragonfly too,   And all their relations, green, orange, and blue.    And there came the Moth, with her plumage of down,   And the Hornet, with jacket of yellow and brown,   Who with him the Wasp, his companion, did bring--   They promised that evening to lay by their sting.    Then the sly little Dormouse peeped out of his hole,   And led to the feast his blind cousin the Mole;   And the Snail, with her horns peeping out from her shell,   Came fatigued with the distance, the length of an ell.    A Mushroom the table, and on it was spread   A Water-dock leaf, which their table-cloth made;   The viands were various, to each of their taste,   And the Bee brought the honey to sweeten the feast.    With steps more majestic the Snail did advance,   And he promised the gazers a minuet dance;   But they all laughed so loudly, he pulled in his head,   And went, in his own little chamber, to bed.    Then, as evening gave way to the shadows of night,   Their watchman, the Glow-worm, came out with his light.   So home let us hasten, while yet we can see,   For no watchman is waiting for you or for me.  The Butterfly's Ball--by RM Ballantyne    CHAPTER TWO.  THE BUTTERFLY'S BALL AND THE GRASSHOPPER'S FEAST.    Come, take up your hats, and away let us haste   To the Butterfly's ball and the Grasshopper's feast;   For the trumpeter Gadfly has summoned his crew,   And the revels are now only waiting for you.    On the smooth-shaven grass by the side of the wood,   Beneath a broad oak that for ages has stood,   See the children of earth, and the tenants of air,   For an evening's amusement together repair.  It was very early one delightful morning in summer, when the trumpeter Gadfly sounded his horn, inviting all the insects in the forest to the Butterfly's ball and the Grasshopper's feast.  The sun shone brightly, the air was mild and soft, and the scent of the wild flowers delicious, so that not one of the insects thought of staying at home.  Butterflies, Beetles, Bees, Wasps, Snails, Grasshoppers, Ants, all put on their best coats and frocks, all, put on their sweetest smiles, and all hurried off, in little bands, to the ball, talking and laughing, and humming and buzzing, by the way, as if they were the happiest creatures in the wide world.  Even the old Beetle, that had been run over by a cart-wheel and squeezed nearly to death, got out of bed when he heard what was going on, and limped along with the rest, though he had been confined to the house for six months before.  One or two Butterflies, that were never known to go out except in the very finest weather,--and even then, carefully wrapped up,--determined to venture.  They were long in making up their minds about it.  One thought it looked a very little like rain; another feared that the light breeze might give them a cold.  However, they put on a great many cloaks, and went.  From all directions they came, and assembled on a smooth, grassy spot, under an old oak-tree, where the revels were to take place.  Some crawled slowly along the ground, some bounded quickly over hill and dale, some came running and tumbling, jumping and hitting against things in their haste; some came swiftly through the air, and alighted so suddenly as to tumble head over heels; others flew quietly to the scene and fluttered lightly about, admiring the gay company they were about to join.    And there came the Beetle, so blind, and so black,   Who carried the Emmet, his friend, on his back;   And there came the Gnat, and the Dragonfly too,   And all their relations, green, orange, and blue.  The Black Beetle was the first to make his appearance.  He carried his dear friend the Emmet on his back, and a sad journey they had of it, to be sure!  Being very blind, the Beetle was constantly falling over twigs, knocking his shins against the edges of leaves, and tumbling into ditches, so that the poor Emmet had many terrible falls, and once the great beetle fell on the top of him and crushed him a good deal.  But it was very pleasant to see how cheerful they were under all this.  On getting up after a fall, the beetle always laughed so boisterously that the tears ran down his cheeks, and his black sides nearly cracked; while the little Emmet said gaily, \"Ah! my friend, accidents will happen! not hurt, I hope?  Come, get along once more;\" and then he jumped up on his friend's back again, and away they went as merrily as ever.  A Gnat and a Dragonfly, with a great many of their relations, arrived about the same time with the Beetle.  They looked quite charming in their brilliant dresses, the colours of which were chiefly green, orange, and blue.  A large Blue-bottle Fly, with a very light waistcoat, and a hat stuck on one side of his head, said that the Dragonflies were lovely, and that Miss Gnat was quite killing.  This was an odd thing to say, but Mr Blue-bottle meant by it, that she was very beautiful. Indeed, it was said that he fell in love with Miss Gnat, for he danced with nobody else during the whole afternoon.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------    And there came the Moth, with her plumage of down,   And the Hornet, with jacket of yellow and brown,   Who with him the Wasp, his companion, did bring--   They promised that evening to lay by their sting.  The Moth was sound asleep when the Gadfly blew his trumpet.  She had sat up too late the night before, and, owing to having indulged this bad habit, had overslept herself the following morning.  However, she tried by her activity to make up for lost time; she saw the other insects hurrying past her house in crowds, so she threw on her clothes as fast as possible.  The Moth was prettily dressed in a soft garment of down, and as she was a modest creature, every one loved her. On leaving home, she observed the Wasp and the Hornet passing.  They were dressed in rich suits of brown and yellow.  At sight of them she was a little frightened, and endeavoured to run back to her house until they should pass by; but they caught sight of her, and immediately gave chase, screaming out loudly, \"Oh! dear Mrs Moth, pray don't be alarmed. We have laid by our stings for to-day, and won't hurt you.\"  They soon caught her, although she ran as fast as she could.  So the Wasp and the Hornet each offered her an arm, and obliged her to walk between them while they danced along, shouting, and singing, and winking waggishly to the friends they passed on the road.  The poor Moth blushed very much at being seen by all her friends in the company of two such wild creatures. A Caterpillar and a Long-legged Beetle, besides one or two other insects that chanced to be near, laughed very heartily on seeing what had happened.  But the Moth soon recovered her spirits; and when they arrived at the oak-tree, she was walking along with a sprightly step, first talking to the Hornet and then chatting to the Wasp, as if they were her dearest friends.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Then the sly little Dormouse peeped out of his hole,   and led to the feast his blind cousin the Mole;   And the Snail, with her horns peeping out from her shell,   Came fatigued with the distance, the length of an ell.  \"Come along, you lazy fellow,\" cried the little Dormouse, knocking with his ivory-headed cane at the door of a mole-hill.  \"Ay, ay, cousin,\" shouted the Mole, \"I'll be there in a minute.\"  So the Dormouse stood impatiently tapping his boots till the Mole should be ready.  The Dormouse was dressed in the height of fashion, and thought himself a rather handsome fellow.  Some people said that he was conceited, and indeed a Spider that was near at hand plainly told him so; but, whether this was true or not, there is no doubt that he was a very kind little fellow, because he came to lead his poor blind cousin to the feast.  \"What a time you have been, old boy,\" he said, as the Mole appeared, dusting the earth off his coat and white hat.  The Mole answered that he had been very busy all morning making a new tunnel between his bed-room and drawing-room.  He then"]]]
