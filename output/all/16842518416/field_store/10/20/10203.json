It is well that mankind cannot pry into the secrets of futurity.  At all events, it is certain that if the crew of the _Water Wagtail_ had known what was in store for them when they set sail from Bristol, one fine spring morning at the beginning of the sixteenth century, most of them would have remained at home--though it is not improbable that, even with full knowledge of coming events, some of the romantic among them, and a few of the reckless, might have decided to go on.  Undoubtedly Paul Burns would have scorned to draw back, for he was a \"hero of romance;\" an enthusiast of the deepest dye, with an inquiring mind, a sanguine disposition, and a fervent belief in all things great and good and grand.  He was also a six-footer in his socks, a horse in constitution, a Hercules in frame, with a hook nose and a hawk eye and a strong jaw--and all the rest of it.  Paul had a good brain, too, and was well educated--as education went in those days.  Yes, there can be little doubt that even though Paul Burns had been able to see into the future, he would have deliberately chosen to go on that voyage.  So would Oliver Trench, for Oliver worshipped Paul!  He loved him as if he had been an elder brother.  He admired him, afar off, as a rare specimen of human perfection.  He looked up to him, physically as well as mentally, for Oliver was at that time little more than a boy of medium size, but bold as a bull-dog and active as a weasel.  Yes, we are safe to say that a revelation of the disasters, dangers, sufferings, etcetera, in store, would not have deterred Oliver Trench.  He would have gone on that voyage simply because Paul Burns went.  That was reason enough for him.  The devotion of Ruth to Naomi was mild compared with that of Oliver to Paul--if words are a test of feelings--for Ruth's beautiful language could not compare with the forcible expressions with which Oliver assured his friend that he would stick to him, neck or nothing, through thick and thin, to the latest hour of life!  As for the rest of the crew--Big Swinton, Little Stubbs, George Blazer, Squill, and the like--it was well, as we have said, that they could not see into the future.  There were forty of them, all told, including the cook and the cabin-boy.  We do not include Paul Burns or Oliver Trench, because the former was naturalist to the expedition--a sort of semi-scientific freelance; and the latter, besides being the master's, or skipper's, son, was a free-and-easy lance, so to speak, whose duties were too numerous to mention, and too indefinite to understand.  Most of the men were what is expressed by the phrase \"no better than they should be.\" Some of them, indeed, were even worse than that.  The wars of the period had rendered it difficult to obtain good seamen at that particular time, so that merchant skippers had to content themselves with whatever they could get.  The crew of the _Water Wagtail_ was unusually bad, including, as it did, several burglars and a few pickpockets, besides loafers and idlers; so that, before leaving Bristol, a friend of the skipper, whose imagination was lively, styled it a crew of forty thieves.  The coast of Norway was the destination of the _Water Wagtail_.  She never reached the coast of--but we must not anticipate.  What her object was in reference to Norway we cannot tell.  Ancient records are silent on the point.  The object of Paul Burns was to gather general information.  At that period the world was not rich in general information.  To discover, to dare, to do--if need were, to die--was the intention of our big hero. To be similarly circumstanced in a small way was our little hero's ambition.  \"Goin' to blow,\" remarked Skipper Trench, on the evening of the day on which he sailed, as he paced the deck with his hands in his pockets, and, as his son Oliver said, his \"weather-eye\" open.  It seemed as though the weather, having overheard the prophecy, was eager to fulfil it, for a squall could be seen bearing down on the ship even while the words were being uttered.  \"Close reef to-o-o-p-s'ls!\" roared Master Trench, with the energy of a man who means what he says.  We are not sure of the precise nautical terms used, but the result was a sudden and extensive reduction of canvas; and not a moment too soon, for the operation had scarcely been completed when the squall struck the ship, almost capsized her, and sent her careering over the billows \"like a thing of life.\"  This was the first of a succession of squalls, or gales, which blew the _Water Wagtail_ far out upon the Atlantic Ocean, stove in her bulwarks, carried away her bowsprit and foretopmast, damaged her skylights, strained her rudder, and cleared her decks of loose hamper.  After many days the weather moderated a little and cleared up, enabling Master Trench to repair damages and shape his course for Norway.  But the easterly gales returned with increased violence, undid all the repairs, carried away the compass, and compelled these ancient mariners to run westward under bare poles--little better than a wreck for winds and waves to play with.  In these adverse circumstances the skipper did what too many men are apt to do in their day of sorrow--he sought comfort in the bottle.  Love of strong drink was Master Trench's weakest point.  It was one of the few points on which he and his friend Burns disagreed.  \"Now, my dear man,\" said Paul, seating himself one evening at the cabin table and laying his hand impressively on his friend's arm, \"do let me lock up this bottle.  You can't navigate the ship, you know, when you've got so much of that stuff under your belt.\"  \"O yes, I can,\" said the skipper, with an imbecile smile, for his friend had a winning way with him that conciliated even while he rebuked. \"Don't you fear, Paul, I--I'm all right!\"  The half-offended idiotic expression of the man's face was intensely ludicrous, but Paul could not see the ludicrous at that time.  He only saw his usually sedate, manly, generous friend reduced to a state of imbecility.  \"Come, now, Master Trench,\" he said persuasively, taking hold of the case-bottle, \"let me put it away.\"  \"N-no, I won't\" said the captain sharply, for he was short of temper.  The persuasive look on Paul's face suddenly vanished.  He rose, grasped the bottle firmly, went to the open hatch, and sent it whizzing up into the air with such force that it went far over the stern of the ship and dropped into the sea, to the unutterable amazement of the man at the helm, who observed the bottle's unaccountable flight with an expression of visage all his own.  There is no accounting for the rapid transitions of thought and feeling in drunken men.  The skipper sprang up, clenched his right hand, and gazed in fierce astonishment at his friend, who advanced towards him with a benignant smile, quite regardless of consequences.  Even in the act of striking, the captain restrained his arm and opened his hand. Paul met it with a friendly grasp, while the faces of both men expanded in smiling goodwill.  \"Y-you're a trump, P-Paul,\" said the captain.  \"I--I--won't drink a-another d'op!\"  And Master Trench kept his word.  From that day forth, till circumstances rendered drinking impossible, he drank nothing stronger than water.  Soon after this event the weather improved, damages were again repaired, and the skipper--in whom there was much of the spirit of the old vikings--once more laid his course for Norway, resolving to steer, as the said vikings were wont to do, by the stars.  But a spirit of mutiny was abroad in the forecastle by that time.  If hard work, hard fare, and hard fortune are trying even to good men and true, what must they be to bad men and false?  \"Here's how it lays, men,\" said Big Swinton, in a subdued voice, to a knot of friends around him.  \"Blowin' hard as it has bin ever since we left England, it stands to reason that we must have pretty nigh got across the western sea to that noo land discovered by that man wi' the queer name--I can't remember rightly--\"  \"Columbus, you mean,\" cried George Blazer.  \"Why, my father sailed with Columbus on his first voyage.\"  \"No, it wasn't Columbus,\" returned Swinton, in a sharp tone, \"an' you needn't speak as if we was all deaf, Blazer.  It was John Cabot I was thinkin' of, who, with his son Sebastian, discovered land a long way to the nor'ard o' Columbus's track.  They called it Newfoundland.  Well, as I was sayin', we must be a long way nearer to that land than to Norway, an' it will be far easier to reach it.  Moreover, the Cabots said that the natives there are friendly and peaceable, so it's my opinion that we should carry on as we go till we reach Newfoundland, an' see whether we can't lead a jollier life there than we did in Old England.\"  \"But it's _my_ opinion,\" suggested Little Stubbs, \"that the skipper's opinion on that point will have to be found out first, Swinton, for it's of more importance than yours.  You ain't skipper _yet_, you know.\"  \"That's so, Stubbs,\" said Squill, with a nod.  \"Let your tongues lie still,\" retorted Swinton, in an undertoned growl. \"Of course I know I'm not skipper yet, but if you men have the courage of rabbits I'll be skipper before another sun rises--or whoever you choose to appoint.\"  A sudden silence ensued for a few moments, for, although there had been mutinous whisperings before, no one had, up to that time, ventured to make a distinct proposal that action should be taken.  \"What! steal the ship?\" exclaimed a huge black-bearded fellow named Grummidge.  \"Nay--I'll have no hand in that.\"  \"Of course not; we have no intention to _steal_ the ship,\" retorted Swinton, before any one else had time to express an opinion; \"we are all upright honourable men here.  We only mean to take the _loan_ of her. After all we have suffered we are entitled surely to a pleasure-trip, and when that's over we can return the ship to the owners--if "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21710"],["title","The Crew of the Water Wagtail (#1)"],["body","disposed.  You'll join us in that, Grummidge, won't you?  And we'll make you skipper--or first mate, if you're too modest to take command.\"  This sally was received with a subdued laugh, and with marks of such decided approval, that Grummidge was carried with the current--at all events, he held his tongue after that.  An earnest undertoned discussion followed, and it was finally arranged that Big Swinton should sound Master Trench about the propriety of running to Newfoundland instead of returning on their track to Norway. The seaman was not slow to act.  That afternoon, while at the helm, he made the suggestion to the skipper, but met with a sharp rebuke and an order to attend to his duty.  No word did Big Swinton reply, but that very night he entered the cabin with a dozen men and seized the skipper, his son, and Paul Burns, while they slept.  Of course, being greatly outnumbered, they were overcome and bound.  The two officers of the vessel were also seized by another party on deck, and all the five were imprisoned in the hold.  Next morning they were brought on deck, and made to stand in a row before Big Swinton, who had, in the meantime, been appointed by the mutineers to the command of the ship.  \"Now, Master Trench,\" said Swinton, \"we are no pirates.  We have no desire to kill you, so that whether you are killed or not will depend on yourself.  If you agree to navigate this ship to Newfoundland--good; if not we will heave you overboard.\"  \"Heave away then,\" growled the skipper, his nature being such that the more he was defied the more defiant he became.  \"Well, Master Trench, you shall have your way.  Get the plank ready, boys,\" said Swinton, turning to the men.  \"Now stand aside and let the first mate choose.\"  The same question being put to the two mates, they returned similar answers, and were ordered to prepare to walk the plank.  \"You don't understand navigation, I fancy, Master Burns,\" said Swinton to Paul, \"but as you can set broken bones, and things of that sort, we will spare you if you agree to serve us.\"  \"Thank you,\" replied Paul, with quiet urbanity.  \"I prefer to accompany Master Trench, if you have no objection.\"  There was a slight laugh at the coolness of this reply, which enraged the new skipper.  \"Say you so?\" he exclaimed, jumping up.  \"Come, then, shove out the plank, lads, and bring them on one at a time.\"  \"Stop!\" cried little Oliver, at this point.  \"You've forgot _me_.\"  \"No, my little man, I haven't,\" returned Swinton, with a cynical smile. \"You shall accompany your amiable father; but first I'll give you a fair chance,\" he added, in a bantering tone: \"will _you_ navigate the ship?\"  \"Yes, I will,\" answered Oliver promptly.  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed the new skipper, taken aback by the boy's boldness, and at a loss for a reply.  \"Yes, indeed,\" retorted Oliver, \"only put me in command, with an auger, and I'll navigate the ship to the bottom of the sea, with you and all your cowardly crew on board of her!\"  \"Well said, little master,\" cried Grummidge, while a general laugh of approval went round.  Seeing that there was a symptom of better feeling among some of the men, Master Trench was about to make an appeal to them, when--  \"Land ho!\" was shouted by the look-out in stentorian tones.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE ADVENTURERS LAND ON THE ISLAND.  The excitement caused by the sight of land was tremendous.  Nearly every one ran to the bow or leaped on the bulwarks, and the prisoners were left unguarded.  Seeing this, Grummidge quietly cut their bonds unobserved, and then hurried forward to gaze with the rest.  Even the man at the tiller left his post for a moment to get a better view of the land.  On returning, he found Master Trench occupying his place, and Paul Burns standing beside him with a handspike in his grasp.  Oliver had also armed himself with a marlinespike in default of a better weapon.  \"Go for'ard, my man,\" said the skipper, in a quiet voice, \"an' tell your mates to get ready the anchor and stand by the cable.  Haste ye, if you value life.\"  The man slunk away without a word.  \"We seem far from land yet, Master Trench; why such haste?\" asked Paul.  \"Look over the stern,\" was the skipper's curt reply.  Paul and Oliver both did so, and saw that another squall was bearing down on them.  \"Is it Newfoundland?\" asked Paul.  \"Ay, and an ugly coast to make in a squall.  Hallo! there--if ye would not be food for fishes lay aloft and take in all sail!\"  The skipper, as his wont was, gave the order in a stern tone of command, and resigned the tiller to Grummidge, who came aft at the moment.  The men saw with surprise that a heavy squall was bearing down on them from the eastward.  Mutiny flew, as it were, out at the hawseholes, while discipline re-entered by the cabin windows.  Even Big Swinton was cowed for the moment.  It may be that the peculiar way in which Paul Burns eyed him and toyed with the handspike had some effect on him.  Possibly he was keenly alive to the danger which threatened them.  At all events, he went to work like the rest!  And there was occasion for haste.  Before the sails were properly secured, the squall struck them; the foremast was snapped off close to the deck; for a time the ship became unmanageable and drifted rapidly towards the land.  \"Is that a small island that I see on the weather bow, Olly?\" said the skipper to his son.  \"Look, your eyes are better than mine.\"  \"Yes, father.  It looks like a small one.\"  \"Steer for that, Grummidge.  We'll take shelter in its lee.\"  The sails were braced, and the direction of the vessel was changed, while the wreck of the foremast was being cleared away; but, just as they were drawing near to the island, the wind chopped round, and the hoped-for shelter they were approaching became suddenly a lee shore.  \"Nothing can save us now,\" muttered Grummidge, \"the _Water Wagtail_ is going to her doom.\"  \"You're right, my man.  Before another hour goes by, she will have wagged her tail for the last time,\" said Master Trench, somewhat bitterly.  They were both right.  In less than an hour after that the ship was hurled upon the outlying rocks of a low island.  Shaken and strained as she had been during her disastrous voyage, it took but a short time to break her up, but the bow had been thrust high between two rocks and remained fast.  Circumstances do not change character, but they often bring it to the front.  Heroes and poltroons may remain unknown until a sudden incident or change of condition reveals them.  As the crew of the wrecked ship clustered on the fragment of the bow, and gazed on the tumultuous flood of foaming water that seethed between them and the shore, their hearts failed them for fear.  Some sternly compressed their lips, and looked like men who had made up their minds to \"die game.\"  A few even looked defiant, as if daring Fate to do her worst, though the pallor of their countenances gave the lie to the expression of their features; but many of them, in the terror of the moment, cried aloud for mercy, and wildly promised amendment if their lives should be spared.  A few were composed and grave.  Brave men, though bad.  Possibly some of these prayed.  If so, they had the sense to do it silently to Him who knows the secrets of all hearts.  \"No man can cross that and live,\" said the skipper, in a low, sad tone.  \"It is my intention to try, Master Trench,\" said Paul Burns, grasping the end of a light line and tying it round his waist.  Little Oliver looked quickly and anxiously at his friend.  His heart sank, for he saw at a glance that it was not possible to follow him. The deed, if done at all, must be done by his friend alone.  Great, therefore, was the rebound of joy in the boy's heart when Paul said--  \"Now, Olly, attend to me.  My life, under God, may depend on close attention to my signals and the management of the line.  I can trust your father and the men to haul me back to the ship if need be, but I will trust only you to pay out and read my signals.  Observe, now, let there be no _slack_ to the line; keep it just taut but without any pull on it, so that you may _feel_ the signals at once.  One pull means _pay out faster_, two pulls mean _haul me aboard_, three pulls is _all right and fix the big hawser to the line so that I may haul it ashore_.  Now, Olly, I trust to you to read my signals and act promptly.\"  Oliver's heart was too full to speak.  He looked at his friend with swimming eyes and nodded his head.  \"Men,\" said Paul to the crew, \"let me beg you to obey the boy's orders smartly.  If God wills it so, we shall all be saved.\"  He leaped over the side as he concluded.  Another moment and he was seen to rise and buffet the plunging waters manfully.  Great as was the muscular strength of the young man, it seemed absolute feebleness to those who looked on; nevertheless he made headway towards the shore, which was strewn with great boulders with a low cliff behind them.  It was among these boulders that his chief danger and difficulty lay, for his strong frame would have been as nothing if dashed against them.  Quickly he was lost to view in the hurly-burly of foam and spray.  With the utmost care did Oliver Trench perform his duty.  It required both vigour of hand and delicacy of touch to keep the line right, but it was manipulated by hands whose vigour and touch were intensified by love.  \"Ease off!\" he cried, looking back impatiently at the strong fellows who held the slack of the line.  The men obeyed so readily that the line ran out too fast and the boy had much ado to check it.  Just as he got it sufficiently taut, he felt what seemed to him like _two_ pulls--\"haul me in!\"  Could it be?  He was not certain.  In an agony of anxiety he held on, and was about to give the signal to haul in, when his father, who watched his every movement, instantly said, \"Give him another second or two, Olly.\"  Just then there was a strong single pull at the line.  \"Pay out!--faster!\" shouted Oliver, and, at the "]]]
