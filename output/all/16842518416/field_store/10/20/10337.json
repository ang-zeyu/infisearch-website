There's no hurry, Dom,\" answered Otto, who, if truth must be told, was not very anxious to escape too soon from his present romantic position, and thought that it would be time enough to attract the attention of any passing vessel when they grew tired of their solitude.  \"Besides,\" he continued, with that tendency to self-defence which is so natural to fallen humanity, \"I'm not a squirrel to run up the straight stem of a branchless tree, fifty feet high or more.\"  \"No, my boy, you're not a squirrel, but, as I have often told you, you are a monkey--at least, monkey enough to accomplish your ends when you have a mind to.\"  \"Now, really you are too hard,\" returned Otto, who was busily employed as he spoke in boring a hole through a cocoa-nut to get at the milk, \"you know very well that the branch of the neighbouring tree by which we managed to reach the branches of the signal-tree has been blown away, so that the thing is impossible, for the stem is far too big to be climbed in the same way as I get up the cocoa-nut trees.\"  \"That has nothing to do with the question,\" retorted Dominick, \"you _said_ you would try.\"  Otto looked with an injured expression at his sister and asked what she thought of a man being required to attempt impossibilities.  \"Not a man--a monkey,\" interjected his brother.  \"Whether man or monkey,\" said Pauline, in her quiet but decided way, \"if you promised to attempt the thing, you are bound to try.\"  \"Well, then, I will try, and here, I drink success to the trial.\"  Otto applied the cocoa-nut to his lips, and took a long pull.  \"Come along, now, the sooner I prove the impossibility the better.\"  Rising at once, with an injured expression, the boy led the way towards a little eminence close at hand, on the top of which grew a few trees of various kinds, the tallest of these being the signal-tree, to which Dominick had fixed one of the half-burnt pieces of sheeting, brought from the wreck.  The stem was perfectly straight and seemingly smooth, and as they stood at its foot gazing up to the fluttering little piece of rag that still adhered to it, the impossibility of the ascent became indeed very obvious.  \"Now, sir, are you convinced?\" said Otto.  \"No, sir, I am not convinced,\" returned Dominick.  \"You said you would try.\"  Without another word Otto grasped the stem of the tree with arms and legs, and did his best to ascend it.  He had, in truth, so much of the monkey in him, and was so wiry and tough, that he succeeded in getting up full twelve or fourteen feet before being utterly exhausted.  At that point, however, he stuck, but instead of slipping down as he had intended, and again requesting to know whether his brother was convinced, he uttered a sharp cry, and shouted--  \"Oh!  I say, Dom, what am I to do?\"  \"Why, slip down, of course.\"  \"But I can't.  The bark seems to be made of needle-joints, all sticking upwards.  If I try to slip, my trousers vill remain behind, and--and--I can't hold on much longer!\"  \"Let go then, and drop,\" said Dominick, stepping close to the tree.  \"Oh no, don't!\" cried Pauline, with a little shriek; \"if you do you'll-- you'll--\"  \"Bust!  Yes, I know I shall,\" shouted Otto, in despair.  \"No fear,\" cried Dominick, holding out his arms, \"let go, I'll cat--\"  He was stopped abruptly by receiving a shock from his little brother which sent him sprawling on his back.  He sprang up, however, with a gasp.  \"Why, boy, I had no idea you were so heavy,\" he exclaimed, laughing.  \"Now, don't you go boasting in future, you prime minister, that I can't knock you down,\" said Otto, as he gathered himself up.  \"But I say, you're not hurt, are you?\" he added, with a look of concern, while Pauline seized one of Dominick's hands and echoed the question.  \"Not in the least--only a little wind knocked out of me.  Moreover, I'm not yet convinced that the ascent of that tree is an impossibility.\"  \"You'll have to do it yourself, then,\" said Otto; \"and let me warn you beforehand that, though I'm very grateful to you, I won't stand under to catch you.\"  \"Was it not you who said the other night at supper that whatever a fellow resolved to do he could accomplish, and added that, where there's a will, there's a way?\"  \"I rather think it was you, Dom, who gave expression to those boastful sentiments.\"  \"It may be so.  At all events I hold them.  Come, now, lend a hand and help me.  The work will take some time, as we have no other implements than our gully-knives, but we'll manage it somehow.\"  \"Can I not help you?\" asked Pauline.  \"Of course you can.  Sit down on the bank here, and I'll give you something to do presently.\"  Dominick went, as he spoke, to a small tree, the bark of which was long, tough, and stringy.  Cutting off a quantity of this, he took it to his sister, and showed her how to twist some of it into stout cordage. Leaving her busily at work on this, he went down to the nearest bamboo thicket and cut a stout cane.  It took some time to cut, for the bamboo was hard and the knife small for such work.  From the end of the cane he cut off a piece about a foot in length.  \"Now, Otto, my boy, you split that into four pieces, and sharpen the end of each piece, while I cut off another foot of the bamboo.\"  \"But what are you going to do with these bits of stick?\" asked Otto, as he went to work with a will.  \"You shall see.  No use in wasting time with explanations just now.  I read of the plan in a book of travels.  There's nothing like a good book of travels to put one up to numerous dodges.\"  \"I'm not so sure o' that,\" objected the boy.  \"I have read _Robinson Crusoe_ over and over, and over again, and I don't recollect reading of his having made use of pegs to climb trees with.\"  \"Your memory may be at fault, perhaps.  Besides, Robinson's is not the only book of travels in the world,\" returned Dominick, as he hacked away at the stout bamboo.  \"No; but it is certainly the best,\" returned Otto, with enthusiasm, \"and I mean to imitate its hero.\"  \"Don't do that, my boy,\" said Dominick; \"whatever you do, don't imitate. Act well the part allotted to you, whatever it may be, according to the promptings of your own particular nature; but don't imitate.\"  \"Humph!  I won't be guided by your wise notions, Mr Premier.  All I know is, that I wish my clothes would wear out faster, so that I might dress myself in skins of some sort.  I would have made an umbrella by this time, but it never seems to rain in this country.\"  \"Ha!  Wait till the rainy season comes round, and you'll have more than enough of it.  Come, we've got enough of pegs to begin with.  Go into the thicket now; cut some of the longest bamboos you can find, and bring them to me; six or eight will do--slender ones, about twice the thickness of my thumb at the ground.\"  While Otto was engaged in obeying this order, his brother returned to the signal-tree.  \"Well done, Pina,\" he said; \"you've made some capital cordage.\"  \"What are you going to do now, brother?\"  \"You shall see,\" said Dominick, picking up a heavy stone to use as a hammer, with which he drove one of the hard, sharp pegs into the tree, at about three feet from the ground.  We have said the peg was a foot long.  As he fixed it in the tree about three inches deep, nine inches of it projected.  On this he placed his foot and raised himself to test its strength.  It bore his weight well.  Above this first peg he fixed a second, three feet or so higher, and then a third about level with his face.  \"Ah!  I see,\" exclaimed Otto, coming up at that moment with several long bamboos.  \"But, man, don't you see that if one of these pegs should give way while you're driving those above it, down you come by the run, and, if you should be high up at the time, death will be probable--lameness for life, certain.\"  Dominick did not condescend to answer this remark, but, taking one of the bamboos, stood it up close to the tree, not touching, but a few inches from the trunk, and bound it firmly with the cord to the three pegs.  Thus he had the first three rounds or rungs of an upright ladder, one side of which was the tree, the other the bamboo.  Mounting the second of these rungs he drove in a fourth peg, and fastened the bamboo to it in the same way, and then, taking another step, he fixed a fifth peg.  Thus, step by step, he mounted till he had reached between fifteen and twenty feet from the ground, where the upright bamboo becoming too slender, another was called for and handed up by Otto.  This was lashed to the first bamboo, as well as to three of the highest pegs, and the operation was continued.  When the thin part of the second long bamboo was reached, a third was added; and so the work progressed until the ladder was completed, and the lower branches of the tree were gained.  Long before that point, however, Otto begged to be allowed to continue and finish the work, which his brother agreed to, and, finally, the signal flag was renewed, by the greater part of an old hammock being lashed to the top of the tree.  But weeks and months passed away, and the flag continued to fly without attracting the attention of any one more important, or more powerful to deliver them, than the albatross and the wild sea-mew.  During this period the ingenuity and inventive powers of the party were taxed severely, for, being utterly destitute of tools of any kind, with the exception of the gully-knives before mentioned, they found it extremely difficult to fashion any sort of implement.  \"If we had only an axe or a saw,\" said Otto one morning, with a groan of despair, \"what a difference it would make.\"  \"Isn't there a proverb,\" said Pauline, who at the time was busy making cordage while Otto "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21742"],["title","Jarwin and Cuffy (#0)"],["body","AND CUFFY, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  ADRIFT ON THE OCEAN.  On a certain morning, not very long ago, the sun, according to his ancient and admirable custom, rose at a very early hour, and casting his bright beams far and wide over the Pacific, lighted up the yellow sands and the verdant hills of one of the loveliest of the islands of that mighty sea.  It was early morning, as we have said, and there was plenty of life-- animal as well as vegetable--to be seen on land and sea, and in the warm, hazy atmosphere.  But there were no indications of man's presence in that beautiful scene.  The air was perfectly calm, yet the gentle swell of the ocean terminated in great waves, which came rolling in like walls of glass, and fell on the coral-reef like rushing snow-wreaths with a roar as loud as thunder.  Thousands of sea-birds screamed and circled in the sky.  Fish leaped high out of their native element into the air, as if they wished to catch the gulls, while the gulls, seemingly smitten with a similar desire, dived into the water as if they wished to catch the fish.  It might have been observed, however, that while the fish never succeeded in catching the gulls, the latter very frequently caught the fish, and, without taking the trouble to kill them, bolted them down alive.  Cocoanut-palms cast the shadows of their long stems and graceful tops upon the beach, while, farther inland, a dense forest of tropical plants--bread-fruit trees, bananas, etcetera--rose up the mountain-sides.  Here and there open patches might be seen, that looked like fields and lawns, but there were no cottages or villas.  Droves of pigs rambled about the valleys and on the hill-sides, but they were wild pigs.  No man tended them.  The bread-fruits, the cocoanuts, the bananas, the plantains, the plums, all were beautiful and fit for food, but no man owned them or used them, for, like many other spots in that sea of coral isles and savage men, the island was uninhabited.  In all the wide expanse of ocean that surrounded that island, there was nothing visible save one small, solitary speck on the far-off horizon. It might have been mistaken for a seagull, but it was in reality a raft--a mass of spars and planks rudely bound together with ropes.  A boat's mast rose from the centre of it, on which hung a rag of sail, and a small red flag drooped motionless from its summit.  There were a few casks on the highest part of the raft, but no living soul was visible. Nevertheless, it was not without tenants.  In a hollow between two of the spars, under the shadow of one of the casks, lay the form of a man. The canvas trousers, cotton shirt, blue jacket, and open necktie, bespoke him a sailor, but it seemed as though there were nothing left save the dead body of the unfortunate tar, so pale and thin and ghastly were his features.  A terrier dog lay beside him, so shrunken that it looked like a mere scrap of door-matting.  Both man and dog were apparently dead, but they were not so in reality, for, after lying about an hour quite motionless, the man slowly opened his eyes.  Ah, reader, it would have touched your heart to have seen those eyes! They were so deep set, as if in dark caverns, and so unnaturally large. They gazed round in a vacant way for a few moments, until they fell on the dog.  Then a gleam of fire shot through them, and their owner raised his large, gaunt, wasted frame on one elbow, while he gazed with a look of eagerness, which was perfectly awful, at his dumb companion.  \"Not dead _yet_!\" he said, drawing a long sigh.  There was a strange, incongruous mixture of satisfaction and discontent in the remark, which was muttered in a faint whisper.  Another gleam shot through the large eyes.  It was not a pleasant look. Slowly, and as if with difficulty, the man drew a clasp-knife from his pocket, and opened it.  As he did so, his brows lowered and his teeth became clenched.  It was quite plain what he meant to do.  As he held the open knife over the dog's head, he muttered, \"Am I to die for the sake of a _dog_!\"  Either the terrier's slumbers had come to an end naturally, at a fortunate moment, or the master's voice had awakened it, for it opened its eyes, raised its head, and looked up in the sailor's face.  The hand with the knife drooped a little.  The dog rose and licked it.  Hunger had done its work on the poor creature, for it could hardly stand, yet it managed to look in its master's face with that grave, simple gaze of self-forgetting love, which appears to be peculiar to the canine race. The savage glare of the seaman's eyes vanished.  He dropped the knife.  \"Thanks, Cuffy; thanks for stoppin' me.  It would have been _murder_! No, no, my doggie, you and I shall die together.\"  His voice sank into a murmur, partly from weakness and partly from the ideas suggested by his concluding words.  \"Die together!\" he repeated, \"surely it ain't come to that _yet_.  Wot, John Jarwin, you're not goin' to give in like that, are you? to haul down your colours on a fine day with a clear sky like this overhead? Come, cheer up, lad; you're young and can hold out a good while yet. Hey, old dog, wot say _you_?\"  The dog made a motion that would, in ordinary circumstances, have resulted in the wagging of its tail, but the tail was powerless to respond.  At that moment a gull flew towards the raft; Jarwin watched it eagerly as it approached.  \"Ah,\" he muttered, clasping his bony hand as tightly over his heart as his strength would allow and addressing the gull, \"if I only had hold of _you_, I'd tear you limb from limb, and drink your blood!\"  He watched the bird intently as it flew straight over him.  Leaning back, he continued slowly to follow its flight, until his head rested on the block of wood which had served him for a pillow.  The support felt agreeable, he forgot the gull, closed his eyes, and sank with a deep sigh into a slumber that strongly resembled death.  Presently he awoke with a start, and, once more raising himself, gazed round upon the sea.  No ship was to be seen.  How often he had gazed round the watery circle with the same anxious look only to meet with disappointment!  The hills of the coral island were visible like a blue cloud on the horizon, but Jarwin's eyes were too dim and worn out to observe them.  \"Come,\" he exclaimed, suddenly, scrambling to his feet, \"rouse up, Cuffy; you an' I ain't a-goin' to die without a good fight for life. Come along, my hearty; we'll have another glass of grog--Adam's grog it is, but it has been good grog to you an' me, doggie--an' then we shall have another inspection o' the locker; mayhap there's the half of a crumb left.\"  The comparatively cheery tone in which the sailor said this seemed to invigorate the dog, for it rose and actually succeeded in wriggling its tail as it staggered after its master--indubitable sign of hope and love not yet subdued!  Jarwin went to a cask which still contained a small quantity of fresh water.  Three weeks before the point at which we take up his story, a storm had left him and his dog the sole survivors on the raft of the crew of a barque which had sprung a leak, and gone to the bottom.  His provision at the time was a very small quantity of biscuit and a cask of fresh water.  Several days before this the last biscuit had been consumed but the water had not yet failed.  Hitherto John Jarwin had husbanded his provisions, but now, feeling desperate, he drank deeply of the few remaining drops of that liquid which, at the time, was almost as vital to him as his life-blood.  He gave a full draught also to the little dog.  \"Share and share alike, doggie,\" he said, patting its head, as it eagerly lapped up the water; \"but there's no wittles, Cuffy, an' ye don't care for baccy, or ye should be heartily welcome to a quid.\"  So saying, the sailor supplied his own cheek with a small piece of his favourite weed, and stood up on the highest part of the raft to survey the surrounding prospect.  He did so without much hope, for \"hope deferred\" had at last made his heart sick.  Suddenly his wandering gaze became fixed and intense.  He shaded his eyes with one hand, and steadied himself against the mast with the other.  There could be no doubt of it!  \"Land ho!\" he shouted, with a degree of strength that surprised himself, and even drew from Cuffy the ghost of a bark.  On the strength of the discovery Jarwin and his dumb friend immediately treated themselves to another glass of Adam's grog.  But poor Jarwin had his patience further tried.  Hours passed away, and still the island seemed as far off as ever.  Night drew on, and it gradually faded from his view.  But he had unquestionably seen land; so, with this to comfort him, the starving tar lay down beside his dog to spend another night--as he had already spent many days and nights--a castaway on the wide ocean.  Morning dawned, and the sailor rose with difficulty.  He had forgotten, for a moment, the discovery of land on the previous night, but it was brought suddenly to his remembrance by the roar of breakers near at hand.  Turning in the direction whence the sound came, he beheld an island quite close to him, with heavy \"rollers\" breaking furiously on the encircling ring of the coral-reef.  The still water between the reef and the shore, which was about a quarter of a mile wide, reflected every tree and crag of the island, as if in a mirror.  It was a grand, a glorious sight, and caused Jarwin's heart to swell with emotions that he had never felt before; but his attention was quickly turned to a danger which was imminent, and which seemed to threaten the total destruction of his raft, and the loss of his life.  A very slight breeze--a mere zephyr--which had carried him during the night towards the island, was now bearing him straight, though slowly, down on the reef, where, if he had once got involved in the breakers, the raft must certainly have been dashed to pieces; and he knew full well, that in his"]]]
