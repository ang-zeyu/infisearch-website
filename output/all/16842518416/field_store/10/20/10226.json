But Heywood's father had done him some service at a time when he was ill and in difficulties, so, as the youth was very anxious to go, he resolved to repay this good turn of the father by doing a kindness to the son.  Heywood turned out but a poor backwoodsman, but he proved to be a pleasant, amusing companion, and as Jasper and the Indian were quite sufficient for the management of the light canoe, and the good gun of the former was more than sufficient to feed the party, it mattered nothing to Jasper that Heywood spent most of his time seated in the middle of the canoe, sketching the scenery as they went along.  Still less did it matter that Heywood missed everything he fired at, whether it was close at hand or far away.  At first Jasper was disposed to look upon his young companion as a poor useless creature; and the Indian regarded him with undisguised contempt. But after they had been some time in his company, the opinions of these two men of the woods changed; for they found that the artist was wise, and well informed on many subjects of which they were extremely ignorant; and they beheld with deep admiration the beautiful and life-like drawings and paintings which he produced in rapid succession.  Such was the romantic youth who had, for the sake of seeing and painting the wilderness, joined himself to these rough sons of the forest, and who now sat in the centre of the canoe swaying his arms about and shouting with excitement as they quickly drew near to the swimming herd of deer.  \"Keep yourself still,\" said Jasper, looking over his shoulder, \"ye'll upset the canoe if ye go on like that.\"  \"Give me the axe, give me the axe, I'll kill him!\" cried Heywood.  \"Take your pencil and draw him,\" observed the hunter, with a quiet laugh.  \"Now, Arrowhead, two good strokes of the paddle will do--there-- so.\"  As he spoke the canoe glanced up alongside of an affrighted deer, and in the twinkling of an eye Jasper's long knife was in its heart, and the water was dyed with blood.  This happened quite near to the opposite shore of the lake, so that in little more than half an hour after it was killed the animal was cut up and packed, and the canoe was again speeding towards the upper end of the lake, where the party arrived just as night began to fling its dark mantle over the wilderness.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE ENCAMPMENT.  Camping out in the woods at night is truly a delightful thing, and the pleasantest part of it, perhaps, is the lighting of the fire.  Light is agreeable to human eyes and cheering to the human heart.  Solomon knew and felt that when he penned the words, \"A pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.\"  And the rising of the sun is scarcely more grateful to the feelings than the lighting of a fire on a dark night. So our friends thought and felt, when the fire blazed up, but they were too busy and too hungry at the time to think about the state of their feelings.  The Indian was hungry.  A good fire had to be made before the venison could be roasted, so he gave his whole attention to the felling of dry trees and cutting them up into logs for the fire.  Jasper was also hungry, and a slight shower had wetted all the moss and withered grass, so he had enough to do to strike fire with flint and steel, catch a spark on a little piece of tinder, and then blow and coax the spark into a flame.  The artist was indeed free to indulge in a little meditation; but he had stumbled in the dark on landing, and bruised his shins, so he could only sit down on a rock and rub them and feel miserable.  But the fire soon caught; branches were heaped up, great logs were piled on, forked tongues of flame began to leap up and lick the branches of the overhanging trees.  The green leaves looked rich and warm; the thick stems looked red and hot; the faces and clothes of the men seemed as if about to catch fire as they moved about the encampment preparing supper. In short, the whole scene was so extremely comfortable, in reality as well as in appearance, that Heywood forgot his bruised shins and began to rub his hands with delight.  In a very short time three juicy venison-steaks were steaming before the three travellers, and in a much shorter time they had disappeared altogether and were replaced by three new ones.  The mode of cooking was very simple.  Each steak was fixed on a piece of stick and set up before the fire to roast.  When one side was ready, the artist, who seemed to have very little patience, began to cut off pieces and eat them while the other side was cooking.  To say truth, men out in those regions have usually such good appetites that they are not particular as to the cooking of their food.  Quantity, not quality, is what they desire.  They generally feel very much like the Russian, of whom it is said, that he would be content to eat sawdust if only he _got_ _plenty_ _of_ _it_!  The steaks were washed down with tea.  There is no other drink in Rupert's Land.  The Hudson's Bay Company found that spirits were so hurtful to the Indians that they refused to send them into the country; and at the present day there is no strong drink to be had for love or money over the length and breadth of their territories, except at those places where other fur-traders oppose them, and oblige them, in self-defence, to sell fire-water, as the Indians call it.  Tea is the great--the only--drink in Rupert's Land!  Yes, laugh as ye will, ye lovers of gin and beer and whisky, one who has tried it, and has seen it tried by hundreds of stout stalwart men, tells you that the teetotaller is the best man for real hard work.  The three travellers drank their tea and smacked their lips, and grinned at each other with great satisfaction.  They could not have done more if it had been the best of brandy and they the jolliest of topers!  But the height of their enjoyment was not reached until the pipes were lighted.  It was quite a sight to see them smoke!  Jasper lay with his huge frame extended in front of the blaze, puffing clouds of smoke thick enough to have shamed a small cannon.  Arrowhead rested his back on the stump of a tree, stretched his feet towards the fire, and allowed the smoke to roll slowly through his nostrils as well as out at his mouth, so that it kept curling quietly round his nose, and up his cheeks, and into his eyes, and through his hair in a most delightful manner; at least so it would seem, for his reddish-brown face beamed with happy contentment.  Young Heywood did not smoke, but he drew forth his sketch-book and sketched his two companions; and in the practice of his beloved art, I have no doubt, he was happier than either.  \"I wonder how many trading-posts the Hudson's Bay Company has got?\" said Heywood, as he went on with his work.  \"Hundreds of 'em,\" said Jasper, pressing the red-hot tobacco into the bowl of his pipe with the end of his little finger, as slowly and coolly as if his flesh were fire-proof.  \"I don't know, exactly, how many they've got.  I doubt if anybody does, but they have them all over the country.  You've seen a little of the country now, Heywood; well, what you have seen is very much like what you will see as long as you choose to travel hereaway.  You come to a small clearing in the forest, with five or six log houses in it, a stockade round it, and a flagstaff in the middle of it; five, ten, or fifteen men, and a gentleman in charge. That's a Hudson's Bay Company's trading-post.  All round it lie the wild woods.  Go through the woods for two or three hundred miles and you'll come to another such post, or fort, as we sometimes call 'em.  That's how it is all the country over.  Although there are many of them, the country is so uncommon big that they may be said to be few and far between.  Some are bigger and some are less.  There's scarcely a settlement in the country worthy o' the name of a village except Red River.\"  \"Ah!  Red River,\" exclaimed Heywood, \"I've heard much of that settlement--hold steady--I'm drawing your _nose_ just now--have you been there, Jasper?\"  \"That have I, lad, and a fine place it is, extendin' fifty miles or more along the river, with fine fields, and handsome houses, and churches, and missionaries and schools, and what not; but the rest of Rupert's Land is just what you have seen; no roads, no houses, no cultivated fields--nothing but lakes, and rivers, and woods, and plains without end, and a few Indians here and there, with plenty of wild beasts everywhere.  These trading-posts are scattered here and there, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from Canada to the Frozen Sea, standin' solitary-like in the midst of the wilderness, as if they had dropped down from the clouds by mistake and didn't know exactly what to do with themselves.\"  \"How long have de Company lived?\" inquired Arrowhead, turning suddenly to Jasper.  The stout hunter felt a little put out.  \"Ahem!  I don't exactly know; but it must have been a long time, no doubt.\"  \"Oh, I can tell you that,\" cried Heywood.  \"You?\" said Jasper in surprise.  \"Ay; the Company was started nearly two hundred years ago by Prince Rupert, who was the first Governor, and that's the reason the country came to be called Rupert's Land.  You know its common name is `the Hudson's Bay Territory,' because it surrounds Hudson's Bay.\"  \"Why, where did you learn that?\" said Jasper, \"I thought I knowed a-most everything about the Company; but I must confess I never knew that about Prince Rupert before.\"  \"I learned it from books,\" said the artist.  \"Books!\" exclaimed Jasper, \"I never learned nothin' from books--more's the pity.  I git along well enough in the trappin' and shootin' way without 'em; but I'm sorry I never learned to read.  Ah!  I've a great opinion of books--so I have.\"  The worthy hunter shook his head solemnly as he said this in a low voice, more to himself than to his companions, and he continued to mutter and shake "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21715"],["title","Away in the Wilderness (#2)"],["body","head for some minutes, while he knocked the ashes out of his pipe.  Having refilled and relighted it, he drew his blanket over his shoulder, laid his head upon a tuft of grass, and continued to smoke until he fell asleep, and allowed the pipe to fall from his lips.  The Indian followed his example, with this difference, that he laid aside his pipe, and drew the blanket over his head and under his feet, and wrapped it round him in such a way that he resembled a man sewed up in a sack.  Heywood was thus compelled to shut his sketch-book; so he also wrapped himself in his blanket, and was soon sound asleep.  The camp-fire gradually sank low.  Once or twice the end of a log fell, sending up a bright flame and a shower of sparks, which, for a few seconds, lighted up the scene again and revealed the three slumbering figures.  But at last the fire died out altogether, and left the encampment in such thick darkness that the sharpest eye would have failed to detect the presence of man in that distant part of the lone wilderness.    CHAPTER FOUR.  MOSQUITOES--CAMP-FIRE TALK.  There is a certain fly in the American forests which is worthy of notice, because it exercises a great influence over the happiness of man in those regions.  This fly is found in many other parts of the world, but it swarms in immense numbers in America, particularly in the swampy districts of that continent, and in the hot months of summer.  It is called a mosquito--pronounced _moskeeto_--and it is, perhaps, the most tormenting, the most persevering, savage, vicious little monster on the face of the earth.  Other flies go to sleep at night; the mosquito never does.  Darkness puts down other flies--it seems to encourage the mosquito.  Day and night it persecutes man and beast, and the only time of the twenty-four hours in which it seems to rest is about noon, when the heat puts _it_ down for a little.  But this period of rest strengthens it for a renewal of war during the remainder of the day and night.  In form the mosquito very much resembles the gnat, but is somewhat larger.  This instrument of torture is his nose, which is quite as long as his body, and sharper than the finest needle.  Being unable to rest because of the mosquitoes, Heywood resolved to have a chat.  \"Come, Jasper,\" said he, looking up into his companion's grave countenance, \"although we have been many weeks on this journey now, you have not yet told me what has brought you here, or what the end of your trip is going to be.\"  \"I've come here a-hunting,\" said Jasper, with the look and tone of a man who did not wish to be questioned.  \"Nay, now, I know that is not the reason,\" said Heywood, smiling; \"you could have hunted much nearer home, if you had been so minded, and to as good purpose.  Come, Jasper, you know I'm your friend, and that I wish you well.  Let me hear what has brought you so far into the wilderness-- mayhap I can give you some good advice if you do.\"  \"Well, lad, I don't mind if I do.  Though, for the matter of good advice, I don't feel much in need of any just at this time.\"  Jasper shook the ashes out of his pipe, and refilled it as he spoke; then he shook his head once or twice and smiled, as if his thoughts amused him.  Having lighted the pipe, he stretched himself out in a more comfortable way before the blaze, and said--  \"Well, lad, I'll tell ye what it is--it's the old story; the love of woman has brought me here.\"  \"And a very good old story it is,\" returned Heywood, with a look of interest.  \"A poor miserable set of creatures we should be without that same love of woman.  Come, Jasper, I'm glad to hear you're such a sensible fellow.  I know something about that subject myself.  There's a pretty blue-eyed girl, with golden hair, down away in Canada that--\" Heywood stopped short in his speech and sighed.  \"Come, it ain't a hopeless case, is it?\" said Jasper, with a look of sympathy.  \"I rather fear it is; but I hope not.  Ah, what should we do without hope in this world?\"  \"That's true,\" observed Jasper, with much gravity, \"we could not get on at all without hope.\"  \"But come, Jasper,\" said the artist, \"let's hear about your affair, and I'll tell you about mine some other time.\"  \"Well, there is not much to tell, but I'll give ye all that's of it. You must know, then, that about two years ago I was in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, at one o' their outposts in the McKenzie's River district.  We had little to eat there and little to do, and I felt so lonesome, never seein' a human bein' except the four or five men at the fort an' a few Indians, that I made up my mind to quit.  I had no reason to complain o' the Company, d'ye see.  They always treated me handsomely, and it was no fault o' theirs that the livin' in that district was poor and the post lonesome.  \"Well, on my way down to Lake Winnipeg, I fell in with a brigade o' boats goin' to the Saskatchewan district, and we camped together that night.  One o' the guides of the Saskatchewan brigade had his daughter with him.  The guide was a French-Canadian, and his wife had been a Scotch half-caste, so what the daughter was is more than I can tell; but I know what she looked like.  She just looked like an angel.  It wasn't so much that she was pretty, but she was so sweet, and so quiet lookin', and so innocent!  Well, to cut the matter short, I fell in love at once. D'ye know what it is, Heywood, to fall in love at first sight?\"  \"Oh! don't I?\" replied the artist with sudden energy.  \"An' d'ye know,\" continued Jasper, \"what it is to be fallen-in-love-with, at first sight?\"  \"Well, no, I'm not so sure about that,\" replied Heywood sadly.  \"I do, then,\" said Jasper, \"for that sweet critter fell in love with me right off--though what she saw in me to love has puzzled me much. Howsoever, she did, and for that I'm thankful.  Her name is Marie Laroche.  She and I opened our minds to each other that night, and I took the guide, her father, into the woods, and told him I wanted his daughter; and he was agreeable; but he would not hear of my takin' her away then and there.  He told me I must go down to Canada and get settled, and when I had a house to put his daughter in, I was to come back into the wilderness here and be married to her, and then take her home--so here I am on my way to claim my bride.  But there's one thing that puzzles me sorely.\"  \"What is that?\" asked Heywood.  \"I've never heard from Marie from that day to this,\" said Jasper.  \"That is strange,\" replied the other; \"but perhaps she cannot write.\"  \"That's true.  Now, you speak of it, I do believe she can't write a line; but, then, she might have got some one to write for her.\"  \"Did you leave your address with her?\"  \"How could I, when I had no address to leave?\"  \"But did you ever send it to her?\"  \"No, I never thought of that,\" said Jasper, opening his eyes very wide. \"Come, that's a comfort--that's a good reason for never havin' heard from her.  Thankee, lad, for putting me up to it.  And, now, as we must be up and away in another hour, I'll finish my nap.\"  So saying, Jasper put out his pipe and once more drew his blanket over him.  Heywood followed his example, and while he lay there gazing up at the stars through the trees, he heard the worthy hunter muttering to himself, \"That's it; that accounts for my not hearin' from her.\"  A sigh followed the words, very soon a snore followed the sigh, and ere many minutes had passed away, the encampment was again buried in darkness and repose.    CHAPTER FIVE.  JOURNEYING IN THE WILDERNESS.  It seemed to Heywood that he had not been asleep more than five minutes, when he was aroused by Jasper laying his heavy hand on his shoulder.  On rubbing his eyes and gazing round him, he found that the first streak of dawn was visible in the eastern sky, that the canoe was already in the water, and that his companions were ready to embark.  It is usually found that men are not disposed to talk at that early hour.  Heywood merely remarked that it was a fine morning, to which Jasper replied by a nod of his head.  Nothing more was said.  The artist rolled up his blanket in a piece of oiled-cloth, collected his drawing materials and put them into their bag, got into his place in the centre of the canoe, and immediately went to sleep, while Jasper and the Indian, taking their places in the bow and stern, dipped the paddles into the water and shot away from the shore.  They looked mysterious and ghostly in the dim morning light; and the whole scene around them looked mysterious and ghostly too, for the water in the lake seemed black, and the shores and islands looked like dark shadows, and a pale thin mist rolled slowly over the surface of the water and hung overhead.  No sound was heard except the light plash of the paddles as the two backwoodsmen urged their little canoe swiftly along.  By degrees the light of day increased, and Jasper awakened Heywood in order that he might behold the beautiful scenery through which they passed.  They were now approaching the upper end of the lake, in which there were innumerable islands of every shape and size--some of them not more than a few yards in length, while some were two or three hundred yards across, but all were clothed with the most beautiful green foliage and shrubbery.  As the pale yellow of the eastern sky began to grow red, ducks and gulls bestirred themselves.  Early risers among them first began to chirp, and scream, and whistle their morning song,--for there are lazy ones among the birds, just as there are among men.  Sometimes, when the canoe rounded a point of rocks a flock of geese were found floating peacefully among the sedges, sound asleep, with their heads under their wings.  These would leap into the air and fly off in great alarm, with much difficulty and tremendous splutter, reminding one of the proverb, \"The more haste the less speed.\"  At other times they would come upon a flock of ducks so suddenly, that they had no time to take wing,"]]]
