Moreover, young man, if it's not yours, why did you bring it into the carriage with you?\"  \"_I_ did not bring it into the carriage,\" said Edwin, firmly, and with increasing indignation.  \"I came down to this train with a lady, who is now in it, and who can vouch for it that I brought no luggage of any kind with me.  I--\"  At this moment the elderly gentleman with brown top-coat and spectacles bustled up to the carriage, recognised his rug, and claimed it, with a good deal of fuss and noise.  \"Where are you travelling to?\" demanded Blunt, with a touch of sarcasm in his tone.  Poor Gurwood's countenance fell.  He became somewhat pale, and said, in a much less resolute voice, \"You have no right to ask that question; but since you suspect me, I may tell you that I am going to Langrye.\"  \"Show your ticket,\" said the guard, looking in at that moment.  A glance showed the unhappy youth that Captain Lee was regarding him with surprise and Emma with intense pity.  Desperation gave him courage. He turned abruptly to the captain, and said--  \"I regret deeply, sir, that we part with such a foul suspicion hanging over me.  Come,\" he added sternly to Blunt, \"I will go with you, and shall soon prove myself innocent.\"  He leaped to the platform, closely accompanied by Blunt.  \"Where do you intend to take me?\" he asked, turning to his guardian, whom he now knew to be a detective.  \"Here, step this way,\" said Blunt, leading his prisoner towards the rear of the train.  \"Such a nice-looking young man, too, who'd 'ave thought it!\" whispered one of the many heads that were thrust out at the carriage-windows to look at him as he passed.  \"Get in here,\" said Blunt, holding open the door of an empty second-class compartment of the same train; \"we shan't want a ticket for this part of the journey.\"  \"But the lady I mentioned,\" said poor Edwin, \"she can--\"  \"You can see her at Langrye, young man; come, get in,\" said Blunt, sternly, \"the train's just starting.\"  Edwin's blood boiled.  He turned to smite the acute-visaged man to the earth, but encountering the serene gaze of the magnificent guard who stood close beside him, he changed his mind and sprang into the carriage.  Blunt followed, the door was banged and locked, the signal was given and the train moved on.  \"Why do you take me to Langrye instead of back to town?\" asked Edwin, after proceeding some distance in silence.  \"Because we have an hour to wait for the up train, and it's pleasanter waiting there than here,\" replied Blunt; \"besides, I have business at Langrye; I want to see one of my friends there who is looking after light-fingered gentry.\"  As this was said significantly Edwin did not deign a reply, but, leaning back in a corner, gazed out at the window and brooded over his unhappy fate.  Truly he had something to brood over.  Besides being in the unpleasant position which we have described, he had quite recently lost his only relative, a \"rich uncle,\" as he was called, who had brought Edwin up and had led him to believe that he should be his heir.  It was found, however, on the examination of the old gentleman's affairs, that his fortune was a myth, and that his house, furniture, and personal effects would have to be sold in order to pay his debts.  When all was settled, Edwin Gurwood found himself cast upon his own resources with good health, a kind but wayward disposition, a strong handsome frame, a middling education, and between three and four hundred pounds in his pocket.  He soon found that this amount of capital melted with alarming rapidity under the influence of a good appetite and expensive tastes, so he resolved at once to commence work of some kind.  But what was he to turn to?  His uncle had allowed him to do as he pleased.  Naturally it pleased the energetic and enthusiastic boy to learn very little of anything useful, to read an immense amount of light literature, and to indulge in much open-air exercise.  Bitterly did he now feel, poor fellow, that this course, although somewhat pleasing at the time, did not fit him to use and enjoy the more advanced period of life.  He had disliked and refused to sit still even for an hour at a time in boyhood; it now began to dawn upon him that he was doomed for life to the greatest of all his horrors, the top of a three-legged stool!  He had hated writing and figures, and now visions of ledgers, cash-books, invoice-books and similar literature with endless arithmetical calculations began to float before his mental vision.  With intense regret he reflected that if he had only used reasonably well the brief period of life which as yet lay behind him, he might by that time have been done with initial drudgery and have been entering on a brilliant career in one of the learned professions.  As to the army and navy, he was too old to get into either, even if he had possessed interest, which he did not.  Sternly did he reproach his departed uncle when he brooded over his wrongs, and soliloquised thus:--\"You ought to have known that I was a fool, that I could not be expected to know the fact, or to guide myself aright in opposition to and despite of my own folly, and you ought to have forced me to study when I declined to be led--bah! it's too late to say all this now. Come, if there is any manhood in me worthy of the name, let me set to work at once and make the most of what is left to me!\"  Edwin reflected with complacency on the fact that one part of what was left to him was a tall strong frame and broad shoulders, but his judgment told him that though these were blessings not to be despised, and for which he had every reason to be thankful, he ought not to plume himself too much on them, seeing that he shared them in common with numerous prize-fighters and burglars, besides which they could not prove of very much value professionally unless he took to mining or coal-heaving.  He also reflected sadly on the fact that beyond the three R's, a little Latin and French, and a smattering of literary knowledge, he was little better than a red Indian.  Being, as we have said, a resolute fellow, he determined to commence a course of study without delay, but soon found that the necessity of endeavouring to obtain a situation and of economising his slender fortune interfered sadly with his efforts.  However, he persevered.  In the time of his prosperity, young Gurwood had made many friends, but a touch of pride had induced him to turn aside from these--although many of them would undoubtedly have been glad to aid him in his aims--to quit the house of his childhood and betake himself to the flourishing town of Clatterby, where he knew nobody except one soft amiable little school-fellow, whom in boyish days he had always deemed a poor, miserable little creature, but for whom nevertheless he entertained a strong affection.  We need scarcely say that this was Joseph Tipps, the clerk at Langrye station.    CHAPTER FIVE.  AN ACCIDENT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.  Locomotives and telegraphy are mere snails compared to thought.  Let us therefore use our advantage, reader, stride in advance of the 6:30 p.m. train (which by the way has now become a 7:45 p.m. train), and see what little Joseph Tipps is doing.  There he stands--five feet four in his highest-heeled boots--as sterling and warm-hearted a little man as ever breathed.  He was writing at a little desk close to a large window, which, owing to the station being a temporary one and its roof low, was flimsy, and came nearer to the ground than most windows do.  Mr Tipps wrote somewhat nervously.  He inherited his mother's weakness in this respect; and, besides, his nerves had been a little shaken, by the sudden illness, with which his sister had been seized that day, at his lodgings.  Outside on the platform a few people lounged, waiting the arrival of the expected train.  Among them was one whose bulky frame and firm strongly-lined countenance spoke of much power to dare and do.  He was considerably above the middle height and somewhere about middle age. His costume was of that quiet unobtrusive kind which seems to court retirement, and the sharp glance of his eyes seemed to possess something of the gimblet in their penetrating power.  This was no less a personage than Mr Sharp, the inspector of police on the Grand National Trunk Railway.  Mr Inspector Sharp had evidently an eye for the beautiful, for he stood at the farther extremity of the platform gazing in rapt attention at the sun, which just then was setting in a flood of golden light.  But Mr Sharp had also a peculiar faculty for observing several things at once.  Indeed, some of his friends, referring to this, were wont to remark that he was a perfect Argus, with eyes in his elbows and calves and back of his head.  It would seem, indeed, that this, or something like it, must really have been the case, for he not only observed and enjoyed the sunset but also paid particular attention to the conversation of two men who stood not far from him, and at the same time was cognisant of the fact that behind him, a couple of hundred yards or more up the line, a goods engine was engaged in shunting trucks.  This process of shunting, we may explain for the benefit of those who don't know, consists in detaching trucks from trains of goods and shoving them into sidings, so that they may be out of the way, until their time comes to be attached to other trains, which will convey them to their proper destination, or to have their contents, if need be, unloaded and distributed among other trucks.  Shunting is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21740"],["title","The Iron Horse (#8)"],["body"," a tedious process, involving much hauling, pushing, puffing, and whistling, on the part of the engine, and uncoupling of trucks and shifting of points on the part of pointsmen and porters.  There is considerable danger, too, in the process,--or rather there _was_ danger before the introduction of the \"block system,\" which now, when it is adopted, renders accidents almost impossible,--of which system more shall be said hereafter.  The danger lies in this, that shunting has frequently to be done during intervals between the passing of passenger-trains, and, on lines where passenger and goods traffic is very great, these intervals are sometimes extremely brief.  But, strange to say, this danger is the mother of safety, for the difficulty of conducting extensive traffic is so great, that a combination of all but perfect systems of signalling, telegraphing, and organisation is absolutely needful to prevent constant mishap.  Hence the marvellous result that, in the midst of danger, we are in safety, and travelling by railway is really less dangerous than travelling by stage-coach used to be in days of old.  Yes, timid reader, we assure you that if you travel daily by rail your chances of coming to grief are very much fewer than if you were to travel daily by mail coach.  Facts and figures prove this beyond all doubt, so that we are entitled to take the comfort of it. The marvel is, not that loss of life is so great, but that it is so small.  Do you doubt it, reader?  Behold the facts and figures--wonder, be thankful and doubt no more!  A \"Blue Book\" (Captain Tyler's General Report to the Board of Trade on Railway Accidents during the year 1870) tells us that the number of passengers killed on railways last year was ninety.  The number of passenger journeys performed was 307 millions, which gives, in round numbers, one passenger killed for every three and a half millions that travelled.  In the best mail and stage-coaching days the yearly number of travellers was about two millions.  The present railway death-rate applied to this number amounts to a little more than one-half of a unit!  Will any one out of Bedlam have the audacity to say that in coaching days only half a passenger was killed each year?  We leave facts to speak for themselves, and common-sense to judge whether men were safer then than they are now.  But to return.  When Mr Sharp was looking at the distant waggons that were being shunted he observed that the engine which conducted the operation was moved about with so much unnecessary fuss and jerking that he concluded it must be worked by a new, or at all events a bad, driver. He shook his head, therefore, pulled out his watch, and muttered to himself that it seemed to him far too near the time of the arrival of a train to make it safe to do such work.  The calculations, however, had been made correctly, and the train of trucks would have been well out of the way, if the driver had been a smarter man.  Even as things stood, however, there should have been no danger, because the distant signal was turned to danger, which thus said to any approaching train, \"Stop! for your life.\"  But here occurred one of these mistakes, or pieces of carelessness, or thoughtlessness, to which weak and sinful human nature is, and we suppose always will be, liable.  Perhaps the signalman thought the goods train had completed its operation, or fancied that the express was not so near as it proved to be, or he got confused--we cannot tell; there is no accounting for such things, but whatever the cause, he turned off the danger-signal half a minute too soon, and set the line free.  Suddenly the down train came tearing round the curve.  It was at reduced speed certainly, but not sufficiently reduced to avoid a collision with the trucks on a part of the line where no trucks should be.  Our friend John Marrot was on the look-out of course, and so was his mate.  They saw the trucks at once.  Like lightning John shut off the steam and at the same instant touched his whistle several sharp shrieks, which was the alarm to the guard to turn on _his_ brakes.  No men could have been more prompt or cool.  Joe Turner and Will Garvie had on full brake-power in a second or two.  At the same time John Marrot instantly reversing the engine, let on full steam--but all in vain.  Fire flew in showers from the shrieking wheels--the friction on the rails must have been tremendous, nevertheless the engine dashed into the goods train like a thunderbolt with a stunning crash and a noise that is quite indescribable.  The police superintendent, who was all but run over, stood for a few seconds aghast at the sight and at the action of the engine.  Not satisfied with sending one of its own carriages into splinters, the iron horse made three terrific plunges or efforts to advance, and at each plunge a heavy truck full of goods was, as it were, pawed under its wheels and driven out behind, under the tender, in the form of a mass of matchwood--all the goods, hard and soft, as well as the heavy frame of the truck itself being minced up together in a manner that defies description.  It seemed as though the monster had been suddenly endued with intelligence, and was seeking to vent its horrid rage on the thing that had dared to check its pace.  Three loaded trucks it crushed down, over-ran, and scattered wide in this way, in three successive plunges, and then, rushing on a few yards among chaotic _debris_, turned slowly on its side, and hurled the driver and fireman over the embankment.  The shock received by the people at the station was tremendous.  Poor Tipps, standing at his desk, was struck--nervously--as if by electricity.  He made one wild involuntary bolt right through the window, as if it had been made of tissue paper, and did not cease to run until he found himself panting in the middle of a turnip-field that lay at the back of the station.  Turning round, ashamed of himself, he ran back faster than he had run away, and leaping recklessly among the _debris_, began to pull broken and jagged timber about, under the impression that he was rescuing fellow-creatures from destruction!  Strange to say no one was killed on that occasion--no one was even severely hurt, except the driver.  But of course this was not known at first and the people who were standing about hurried, with terrible forebodings, to lend assistance to the passengers.  Mr Sharp seemed to have been smitten with feelings somewhat similar to those of Tipps, for, without knowing very well how or why, he suddenly found himself standing up to the armpits in _debris_, heaving might and main at masses of timber.  \"Hallo! lift away this beam, will you?\" shouted a half-smothered voice close beside him.  It came from beneath the carriage that we have described as having been broken to splinters.  Sharp was a man of action.  He hailed a porter near him and began with energy and power to tear up and hurl aside the boards.  Presently on raising part of the broken framework of the carriage a man struggled to his feet and, wiping away the blood that flowed from a wound in his forehead, revealed the countenance of Edwin Gurwood to the astonished Tipps.  \"What!  Edwin!\" he exclaimed.  \"Ay--don't stand there, man.  Your mother is in the train.\"  Poor Tipps could not speak--he could only gasp the word, \"Where?\"  \"In a third-class, behind--there, it is safe, I see.\"  His friend at once leaped towards the vehicle pointed out, but Edwin did not follow, he glanced wildly round in search of another carriage.  \"You are hurt--Mr Gurwood, if I mistake not,--lean on me,\" said Mr Sharp.  \"It's nothing--only a scratch.  Ha! that's the carriage, follow me,\" cried Edwin, struggling towards a first-class carriage, which appeared considerably damaged, though it had not left the rails.  He wrenched open the door, and, springing in, found Captain Lee striving in vain to lift his daughter, who had fainted.  Edwin stooped, raised her in his arms, and, kicking open the door on the opposite side, leaped down, followed by the captain.  They quickly made their way to the station, where they found most of the passengers, hurt and unhurt, already assembled, with two doctors, who chanced to be in the train, attending to them.  Edwin laid his light burden tenderly on a couch and one of the doctors immediately attended to her.  While he was applying restoratives Mr Blunt touched Edwin on the elbow and requested him to follow him.  With a feeling of sudden anger Gurwood turned round, but before he could speak his eye fell on Mrs Tipps, who sat on a bench leaning on her son's breast, and looking deadly pale but quite composed.  \"My dear Mrs Tipps,\" exclaimed the youth, stepping hastily forward, \"I hope--I trust--\"  \"Oh, Edwin--thank you, my dear fellow,\" cried Joseph, grasping his hand and shaking it.  \"She is not hurt, thank God--not even a scratch--only a little shaken.  Fetch a glass of water, you'll find one in the booking-office.\"  Gurwood ran out to fetch it.  As he was returning he met Captain Lee leading his daughter out of the waiting-room.  \"I sincerely hope that your daughter is not hurt,\" he said, in earnest tones.  \"Perhaps a little water might--\"  \"No, thank you,\" said the captain somewhat stiffly.  \"The carriage is waiting, sir,\" said a servant in livery, coming up at the moment and touching his hat.  Emma looked at Edwin for a second, and, with a slight but perplexed smile of acknowledgment, passed on.  Next moment the carriage drove away, and she was gone.  Edwin at the same time became aware of the fact that the pertinacious Blunt was at his side.  Walking quickly into the waiting-room he presented the glass of water to Mrs Tipps, but to his surprise that eccentric lady rose hastily and said,--\"Thank you, Mr Gurwood, many thanks, but I am better.  Come, Joseph--let us hasten to our darling Netta.  Have you sent for a fly?\"  \"There is one waiting, mother--take my arm.  Many, many thanks for your kindness in coming"]]]
