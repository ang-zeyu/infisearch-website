As it was, they were able to draw off in time and reach another part of the mound where a thick bush effectually concealed them from view.  From this point, when the clouds cleared away, the camp could be clearly seen in the vale below.  Even the forms of the women and children were distinguishable, but not their faces.  \"It won't be easy to get at them by surprise,\" whispered the trapper. \"Their position is strong, and they keep a bright lookout; besides, the moon won't be down for some hours yet--not much before daybreak.\"  \"Whitewing will take the prey from under their very noses,\" returned the Indian.  \"That won't be easy, but I've no doubt you'll try, an' sure, Little Tim's the man to back ye, anyhow.\"  At that moment a slight rustling noise was heard.  Looking through the bush, they saw the Blackfoot sentinel approaching.  Instantly they sank down into the grass, where they lay so flat and still that it seemed as if they had vanished entirely from the scene.  When the sentinel was almost abreast of them, a sound arose from the camp which caused him to stop and listen.  It was the sound of song. The missionary--the only _man_ the Blackfoot Indians had not slain-- having finished supper, had gathered some of the women and children round him, and, after an earnest prayer, had begun a hymn of praise.  At first the Blackfoot chief was on the point of ordering them to cease, but as the sweet notes arose he seemed to be spell-bound, and remained a silent and motionless listener.  The sentinel on the mound also became like a dark statue.  He had never heard such tones before.  After listening a few minutes in wonder, he walked slowly to the end of the mound nearest to the singers.  \"Now's our chance, Whitewing,\" said the trapper, rising from his lair.  The Indian made no reply, but descended the slope as carefully as he had ascended it, followed by his friend.  In a short time they were back at the spot where the horses had been left in charge of Brighteyes.  Whitewing took his sister aside, and for a few minutes they conversed in low tones.  \"I have arranged it all with Brighteyes,\" said the Indian, returning to the trapper.  \"Didn't I tell 'ee,\" said Tim, with a low laugh, \"that women was good at helpin' men in time o' war?  Depend upon it that the sex must have a finger in every pie; and, moreover, the pie's not worth much that they haven't got a finger in.\"  To these remarks the young chief vouchsafed no answer, but gravely went about making preparations to carry out his plans.  While tying the three horses to three separate trees, so as to be ready for instant flight, he favoured his friend with a few explanations.  \"It is not possible,\" he said, \"to take more than three just now, for the horses cannot carry more.  But these three Brighteyes will rescue from the camp, and we will carry them off.  Then we will return with our braves and have all the rest--if Manitou allows.\"  The trapper looked at his friend in surprise.  He had never before heard him make use of such an expression as the last.  Nevertheless, he made no remark, but while the three were gliding silently over the prairie again towards the Blackfoot camp he kept murmuring to himself: \"You're a great puzzle, Whitewing, an' I can't make ye out nohow.  Yet I make no doubt yer right.  Whativer ye do comes right somehow; but yer a great puzzle--about the greatest puzzle that's comed across my tracks since I was a squallin' little babby-boy!\"    CHAPTER FOUR.  CIRCUMVENTING THE BLACKFEET.  On reaching the neighbourhood of the Blackfoot camp, Whitewing, and his companions crept to the top of the eminence which overlooked it, taking care, however, to keep as far away as possible from the sentinel who still watched there.  Brighteyes proved herself to be quite as expert as her male companions in advancing like a snake through the long grass, though encumbered with a blanket wrapped round her shoulders.  The use of this blanket soon became apparent.  As the three lay prone on their faces looking down at the camp, from which the sound of voices still arose in subdued murmurs, the young chief said to his sister--  \"Let the signal be a few notes of the song Brighteyes learned from the white preacher.  Go.\"  Without a word of reply, the girl began to move gently forward, maintaining her recumbent position as she went, and gradually, as it were, melted away.  The moon was still shining brightly, touching every object with pale but effective lights, and covering hillocks and plains with correspondingly dark shadows.  In a few minutes Brighteyes had crept past the young sentinel, and lay within sight--almost within ear shot of the camp.  Much to her satisfaction she observed that the Indians had not bound their captives.  Even the missionary's hands were free.  Evidently they thought, and were perhaps justified in thinking, that escape was impossible, for the horses of the party were all gathered together and hobbled, besides being under a strong guard; and what chance could women and children have, out on the plains on foot, against mounted men, expert to follow the faintest trail?  As for the white man, he was a man of peace and unarmed, as well as ignorant of warriors' ways.  The captives were therefore not only unbound, but left free to move about the camp at will, while some of their captors slept, some fed, and others kept watch.  The missionary had just finished singing a hymn, and was about to begin to read a portion of God's Word when one of the women left the group, and wandered accidentally close to the spot where Brighteyes lay.  It was Lightheart.  \"Sister,\" whispered Brighteyes.  The girl stopped abruptly, and bent forward to listen, with intense anxiety depicted on every feature of her pretty brown face.  \"Sister,\" repeated Brighteyes, \"sink in the grass and wait.\"  Lightheart was too well trained in Indian ways to speak or hesitate.  At once, but slowly, she sank down and disappeared.  Another moment, and Brighteyes was at her side.  \"Sister,\" she said, \"Manitou has sent help.  Listen.  We must be wise and quick.\"  From this point she went on to explain in as few words as possible that three fleet horses were ready close at hand to carry off three of those who had been taken captive, and that she, Lightheart, must be one of the three.  \"But I cannot, will not, escape,\" said Lightheart, \"while the others and, the white preacher go into slavery.\"  To this Brighteyes replied that arrangements had been made to rescue the whole party, and that she and two others were merely to be, as it were, the firstfruits of the enterprise.  Still Lightheart objected; but when her companion added that the plan had been arranged by her affianced husband, she acquiesced at once with Indian-like humility.  \"I had intended,\" said Brighteyes, \"to enter the Blackfoot camp as if I were one of the captives, and thus make known our plans; but that is not now necessary.  Lightheart will carry the news; she is wise, and knows how to act.  Whitewing and Leetil Tim are hid on yonder hillock like snakes in the grass.  I will return to then, and let Lightheart, when she comes, be careful to avoid the sentinel there--\"  She stopped short, for at the moment a step was heard near them.  It was that of a savage warrior, whose sharp eye had observed Lightheart quit the camp, and who had begun to wonder why she did not return.  In another instant Brighteyes flung her blanket round her, whispered to her friend, \"Lie close,\" sprang up, and, brushing swiftly past the warrior with a light laugh--as though amused at having been discovered-- ran into camp, joined the group round the missionary, and sat down. Although much surprised, the captives were too wise to express their feelings.  Even the missionary knew enough of Indian tactics to prevent him from committing himself.  He calmly continued the reading in which he had been engaged, and the Blackfoot warrior returned to his place, congratulating himself, perhaps, on having interrupted the little plan of one intending runaway.  Meanwhile Lightheart, easily understanding her friend's motives, crept in a serpentine fashion to the hillock, where she soon found Whitewing-- to the intense but unexpressed joy of that valiant red man.  \"Will Leetil Tim go back with Lightheart to the horses and wait, while his brother remains here?\" said the young chief.  \"No, Little Tim _won't_,\" growled the trapper, in a tone of decision that surprised his red friend.  \"Brighteyes is in the Blackfoot camp,\" he continued, in growling explanation.  \"True,\" returned the Indian, \"but Brighteyes will escape; and even if she fails to do so now, she will be rescued with the others at last.\"  \"She will be rescued with _us_, just _now_,\" returned Little Tim in a tone so emphatic that his friend looked at him with an expression of surprise that was unusually strong for a redskin warrior.  Suddenly a gleam of intelligence broke from his black eyes, and with the soft exclamation, \"Wah!\" he sank flat on the grass again, and remained perfectly still.  Brighteyes found that it was not all plain sailing when she had mingled with her friends in the camp.  In the first place, the missionary refused absolutely to quit the captives.  He would remain with them, he said, and await God's will and leading.  In the second place, no third person had been mentioned by her brother, whose chief anxiety had been for his bride and the white man, and it did not seem to Brighteyes creditable to quit the camp after all her risk and trouble without some trophy of her prowess.  In this dilemma she put to herself the question, \"Whom would Lightheart wish me to rescue?\"  Now, there were two girls among the captives, one of whom was a bosom friend of Lightheart; the other was a younger sister.  To these Brighteyes went, and straightway ordered them "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21694"],["title","The Prairie Chief (#6)"],["body","prepare for flight. They were of course quite ready to obey.  All the preparation needed was to discard the blankets which Indian women are accustomed to wear as convenient cloaks by day.  Thus unhampered, the two girls wandered about the camp, as several of the others had occasionally been doing. Separating from each other, they got into the outskirts in different directions.  Meanwhile a hymn had been raised, which facilitated their plans by attracting the attention of the savage warriors.  High above the rest, in one prolonged note, the voice of Brighteyes rang out like a silver flute.  \"There's the signal,\" said Little Tim, as the sweet note fell on his listening ear.  Rising as he spoke, the trapper glided in a stooping posture down the side of the hillock, and round the base of it, until he got immediately behind the youthful sentinel.  Then lying down, and creeping towards him with the utmost caution, he succeeded in getting so near that he could almost touch him.  With one cat-like bound, Little Tim was on the Indian's back, and had him in his arms, while his broad horny hand covered his mouth, and his powerful forefinger and thumb grasped him viciously by the nose.  It was a somewhat curious struggle that ensued.  The savage was much bigger than the trapper, but the trapper was much stronger than the savage.  Hence the latter made fearful and violent efforts to shake the former off; while the former made not less fearful, though seemingly not quite so violent, efforts to hold on.  The red man tried to bite, but Tim's hand was too broad and hard to be bitten.  He tried to shake his nose free, but unfortunately his nose was large, and Tim's grip of it was perfect.  The savage managed to get just enough of breath through his mouth to prevent absolute suffocation, but nothing more.  He had dropped his tomahawk at the first onset, and tried to draw his knife, but Tim's arms were so tight round him that he could not get his hand to his back, where the knife reposed in his belt.  In desperation he stooped forward, and tried to throw his enemy over his head; but Tim's legs were wound round him, and no limpet ever embraced a rock with greater tenacity than did Little Tim embrace that Blackfoot brave.  Half choking and wholly maddened, the savage suddenly turned heels over head, and fell on Tim with a force that ought to have burst him.  But Tim didn't burst!  He was much too tough for that.  He did not even complain!  Rising again, a sudden thought seemed to strike the Indian, for he began to run towards the camp with his foe on his back.  But Tim was prepared for that.  He untwined one leg, lowered it, and with an adroit twist tripped up the savage, causing him to fall on his face with tremendous violence.  Before he could recover, Tim, still covering the mouth and holding tight to the nose, got a knee on the small of the savage's back and squeezed it smaller.  At the same time he slid his left hand up to the savage's windpipe, and compressed it.  With a violent heave, the Blackfoot sprang up.  With a still more violent heave, the trapper flung him down, bumped his head against a convenient stone, and brought the combat to a sudden close.  Without a moment's loss of time, Tim gagged and bound his adversary.  Then he rose up with a deep inspiration, and wiped his forehead, as he contemplated him.  \"All this comes o' your desire not to shed human blood, Whitewing,\" he muttered.  \"Well, p'raps you're right--what would ha' bin the use o' killin' the poor critturs.  But it was a tough job!\"--saying which, he lifted the Indian on his broad shoulders, and carried him away.  While this fight was thus silently going on, hidden from view of the camp by the hillock, Whitewing crept forward to meet Brighteyes and the two girls, and these, with Lightheart, were eagerly awaiting the trapper.  \"My brother is strong,\" said Whitewing, allowing the faintest possible smile to play for a moment on his usually grave face.  \"Your brother is tough,\" returned Little Tim, rubbing the back of his head with a rueful look; \"an' he's bin bumped about an' tumbled on to that extent that it's a miracle a whole bone is left in his carcass. But lend a hand, lad; we've got no time to waste.\"  Taking the young Blackfoot between them, and followed by the silent girls, they soon reached the thicket where the horses had been left. Here they bound their captive securely to a tree, and gave him a drink of water with a knife pointed at his heart to keep him quiet, after which they re-gagged him.  Then Whitewing led Lightheart through the thicket towards his horse, and took her up behind him.  Little Tim took charge of Brighteyes.  The young sister and the bosom friend mounted the third horse, and thus paired, they all galloped away.  But the work that our young chief had cut out for himself that night was only half accomplished.  On reaching the rendezvous which he had appointed, he found the braves of his tribe impatiently awaiting him.  \"My father sees that we have been successful,\" he said to Bald Eagle, who had been unable to resist the desire to ride out to the rendezvous with the fighting men.  \"The great Manitou has given us the victory thus far, as the white preacher said he would.\"  \"My son is right.  Whitewing will be a great warrior when Bald Eagle is in the grave.  Go and conquer; I will return to camp with the women.\"  Thus relieved of his charge, Whitewing, who, however, had little desire to achieve the fame prophesied for him, proceeded to fulfil the prophecy to some extent.  He divided his force into four bands, with which he galloped off towards the Blackfoot camp.  On nearing it, he so arranged that they should attack the camp simultaneously at four opposite points. Little Tim commanded one of the bands, and he resolved in his own mind that his band should be the last to fall on the foe.  \"Bloodshed _may_ be avoided,\" he muttered to himself; \"an' I hope it will, as Whitewing is so anxious about it.  Anyhow, I'll do my best to please him.\"  Accordingly, on reaching his allotted position, Tim halted his men, and bided his time.  The moon still shone over prairie and hill, and not a breath of air stirred blade or leaf.  All in nature was peace, save in the hearts of savage man.  The Blackfoot camp was buried in slumber.  Only the sentinels were on the alert.  Suddenly one of these--like the war-horse, who is said to scent the battle from afar--pricked his ears, distended his nostrils, and listened.  A low, muffled, thunderous sort of pattering on the plain in front.  It might be a herd of buffaloes.  The sentinel stood transfixed.  The humps of buffaloes are large, but they do not usually attain to the size of men!  The sentinel clapped his hand to his mouth, and gave vent to a yell which sent the blood spirting through the veins of all, and froze the very marrow in the bones of some!  Prompt was the reply and turn-out of the Blackfoot warriors. Well used to war's alarms, there was no quaking in their bosoms.  They were well named \"braves.\"  But the noise in the camp prevented them from hearing or observing the approach of the enemy on the other side till almost too late.  A whoop apprised the chief of the danger.  He divided his forces, and lost some of his self-confidence.  \"Here comes number three,\" muttered Little Tim, as he observed the third band emerge from a hollow on the left.  The Blackfoot chief observed it too, divided his forces again, and lost more of his self-confidence.  None of the three bands had as yet reached the camp, but they all came thundering down on it at the same time, and at the same whirlwind pace.  \"Now for number four,\" muttered Little Tim.  \"Come boys, an' at 'em!\" he cried, unconsciously paraphrasing the Duke of Wellington's Waterloo speech.  At the some time he gave utterance to what he styled a Rocky Mountain trapper's roar, and dashed forward in advance of his men, who, in trying to imitate the roar, intensified and rather complicated their own yell.  It was the last touch to the Blackfoot chief, who, losing the small remnant of his self-confidence, literally \"sloped\" into the long grass, and vanished, leaving his men to still further divide themselves, which they did effectually by scattering right and left like small-shot from a blunderbuss.  Great was the terror of the poor captives while this brief but decisive action lasted, for although they knew that the assailants were their friends, they could not be certain of the issue of the combat. Naturally, they crowded round their only male friend, the missionary.  \"Do not fear,\" he said, in attempting to calm them; \"the good Manitou has sent deliverance.  We will trust in Him.\"  The dispersion of their foes and the arrival of friends almost immediately followed these words.  But the friends who arrived were few in number at first, for Whitewing had given strict orders as to the treatment of the enemy.  In compliance therewith, his men chased them about the prairie in a state of gasping terror; but no weapon was used, and not a man was killed, though they were scattered beyond the possibility of reunion for at least some days to come.  Before that eventful night was over the victors were far from the scene of victory on their way home.  \"It's not a bad style o' fightin',\" remarked Little Tim to his friend as they rode away; \"lots o' fun and fuss without much damage.  Pity we can't do all our fightin' in that fashion.\"  \"Waugh!\" exclaimed Whitewing; but as he never explained what he meant by \"waugh,\" we must leave it to conjecture.  It is probable, however, that he meant assent, for he turned aside in passing to set free the Blackfoot who had been bound to a tree.  That red man, having expected death, went off with a lively feeling of surprise, and at top speed, his pace being slightly accelerated by a shot--wide of the mark and at long range--from Little Tim.  Three weeks after these events a number of Indians were baptised by our missionary."]]]
