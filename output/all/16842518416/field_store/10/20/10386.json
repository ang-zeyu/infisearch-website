In the evening we found him coming home in a state of great excitement, having found fruit which, he said, was grapes.  The sight and taste of the fruit, to which he was used in his own land, had excited him to such an extent that we thought he was drunk, and for some time he would do nothing but laugh and devour grapes, and talk German, which none of us understood.  At last he spoke Norse, and told us that he had found vines and grapes in great abundance.  We found that this was true--at least we found a berry which was quite new to us.  We went off next day, and, gathering enough to load our boat, brought them away with us.  From this circumstance I called it Vinland.  Two years after that my brother Thorwald went to Vinland, wintered three years there, was killed by the Skraelingers, and his men returned to Greenland.  Then my youngest brother, Thorstein, who was Gudrid's husband, went off to Vinland to fetch home the body of our brother Thorwald, but was driven back by stress of weather.  He was taken ill soon after that, and died.  Since then Gudrid has dwelt with my household, and glad we are to have her. This is the whole story of Vinland; so if you want to know more about it you must e'en go on a voyage of discovery for yourself.\"  \"I should like nothing better,\" replied Karlsefin, \"if I could only--\"  At that moment the door was burst violently open, and a man with bloodshot eyes and labouring breath rushed in exclaiming, \"The Skraelinger! the Skraelinger are upon us!\"    CHAPTER THREE.  DARK WAR-CLOUDS LOWER, BUT CLEAR AWAY WITHOUT A SHOWER--VOICES AND LEGS DO GOOD SERVICE.  \"Up, carls, buckle on your war-gear!\" cried Leif, rising hastily on hearing the announcement with which the last chapter ended.  \"Run, Thorward, call out our men,\" whispered Karlsefin; \"I will stay to learn what Leif means to do.  Bring them all up to the door.\"  Thorward was gone almost before the sentence was finished.  Leif and his house-carls, of whom there were ten present at the time, did not take long to busk them for the fight.  The Norse of old were born, bred, and buried--if they escaped being killed and cut to pieces--in the midst of alarms.  Their armour was easily donned, and not very cumbrous.  Even while Leif was giving the first order to his men, Gudrid had run to the peg on which hung his sword and helmet, and brought him these implements of war.  \"My men and I shall be able to render you some service, Leif,\" said Karlsefin; \"what do you intend to do?\"  \"Do!\" exclaimed Leif with a grim laugh, as he buckled on his sword, \"why, I shall give the Skraelingers a tremendous fright, that is all. The rascals!  They knew well that we were short-handed just now, and thought to take advantage of us; but hah! they do not seem to be aware that we chance to have stout visitors with us to-night.  So, lads, follow me.\"  Biarne, meanwhile, had darted out on the first alarm, and assembled all the men in the settlement, so that when Leif, Karlsefin, and the housemen issued out of the cottage they found about a dozen men assembled, and others running up every moment to join them.  Before these were put in array most of the men of Karlsefin's ship, numbering forty, and those belonging to Thorward, numbering thirty, came up, so that when all were mustered they were little if at all short of one hundred stout warriors.  The moon came out brightly at the time, and Leif chuckled as he watched Biarne put the men hastily into marching order.  \"Methought you said that war was distasteful,\" observed Karlsefin, in some surprise.  \"So it is, so it is, friend,\" replied Leif, still laughing in a low tone; \"but there will be no war to-night.  Leave your bows behind you, lads,\" he added, addressing the men; \"you won't want them; shield and sword will be enough.  For the matter of that, we might do without both. Now, lads, follow my leading, and do as I bid you; advance with as little noise as may be.\"  So saying, Leif led the way out of the little hamlet towards the extremity of the ridge or spur of the mountains that sheltered Ericsfiord from the north-west.  Towards that same extremity another band of men were hastening on the other side of the ridge.  It was a band of our hairy friends whom the Norsemen called Skraelingers.  Truly there was something grand in the look and bearing of the tall man with the flat face, as he led his band to attack the warlike Norsemen, and there was something almost sublime in the savage, resolute aspect of the men who followed him--each being armed with a large walrus spear, and each being, moreover, an adept in the use of it.  Flatface (in default of a better, let that name stick to him) had ascertained beyond a doubt that the entire available force of Norsemen in Ericsfiord had, in consequence of fishing and other expeditions, been reduced to barely thirty fighting men.  He himself could muster a band of at least one hundred and fifty good men and true--not to mention hairy, a hundred and fifty seals having unwillingly contributed their coats to cover these bloodthirsty Skraelingers.  The Norsemen, Flatface knew, were strong men and bold, besides being large, but he resolved to take them by surprise, and surely (he argued with himself) a hundred and fifty brave men with spears will be more than a match for thirty sleepy men unarmed and in bed!  Flatface had screwed himself up with such considerations; made a few more inflammatory speeches to his men, by way of screwing them up also, and then, a little before midnight, set forth on his expedition.  Now it chanced that there was a man among the Norsemen who was a great hunter and trapper.  His name was Tyrker--the same Tyrker mentioned by Leif as being the man who had found grapes in Vinland.  Leif said he was a German, but he said so on no better authority than the fact that he had originally come to Norway from the south of Europe.  It is much more probable that he was a Turk, for, whereas the Germans are known to be a well-sized handsome race of fair men, this Tyrker was an ugly little dark wiry fellow, with a high forehead, sharp eyes, and a small face; but he was extremely active, and, although an elderly man, few of the youths in Ericsfiord could beat him at feats requiring dexterity.  But, whether German or Turk, Tyrker was an enthusiastic trapper of white, or arctic foxes.  These creatures being very numerous in that part of Greenland, he was wont to go out at all hours, late and early, to visit his traps.  Hence it happened that, on the night in question, Tyrker found himself in company with two captured arctic foxes at, the extremity of the mountain spur before referred to.  He could see round the corner of the spur into the country beyond, but as the country there was not attractive, even at its best, he paid no attention to it.  He chanced, however, to cast upon it one glance after setting his traps, just as he was about to return home.  That glance called forth a steady look, which was followed by a stare of surprise, and the deep guttural utterance of the word \"zz-grandimaghowl!\" which, no doubt, was Turkish, at that ancient date, for \"hallo!\"  It was the band of hairy creatures that had met his astonished sight. Tyrker shrank behind the spur and peeped round it for a few seconds to make quite sure.  Then, turning and creeping fairly out of sight, he rose and bounded back to the hamlet, as though he had been a youth of twenty.  As we have seen, he arrived, gasping, in time to warn his friends.  Between the hamlet and the spur where Tyrker's traps were set there were several promontories, or projections from the cliffs, all of which had to be passed before the spur came in view.  Leif led his men past the first and second of these at a run.  Then, believing that he had gone far enough, he ordered his band to draw close up under the cliffs, where the shadow was deepest, saying that he would go alone in advance to reconnoitre.  \"And mark me, lads,\" he said, \"when I give a loud sneeze, do you give vent to a roar that will only stop short of splitting your lungs; then give chase, and yell to your hearts' content as you run; but see to it that ye keep together and that no man runs past _me_.  There is plenty of moonlight to let you see what you're about.  If any man tries to overshoot me in the race I'll hew off his head.\"  This last remark was no figure of speech.  In those days men were but too well accustomed to hewing off heads.  Leif meant to have his orders attended to, and the men understood him.  On reaching the second projection of cliff after leaving his men, Leif peeped round cautiously and beheld the advancing Skraelingers several hundred yards off.  He returned at once to his men and took up a position at their head in the deep shadow of the cliffs.  Although absolutely invisible themselves, the Norsemen could see the Skraelingers quite plainly in the moonlight, as they came slowly and with great caution round each turn of the footpath that led to the hamlet.  There was something quite awe-inspiring in the manner of their approach.  Evidently Flatface dreaded a surprise, for he put each leg very slowly in advance of the other, and went on tiptoe, glancing quickly on either side between each step.  His followers--in a compact body, in deep silence and with bated breath--followed his steps and his example.  When they came to the place where the men crouched in ambush, Leif took up a large stone and cast it high over their heads.  So quietly was this done that none even of his own party heard him move or saw the stone, though they heard it fall with a _thud_ on the sand beyond.  The Skraelingers heard it too, and stopped abruptly--each man on one leg, with the other leg and his arms more or less extended, just as if he had been suddenly petrified.  So in truth he had been--with horror!  To meet an open enemy, however powerful, would have been a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21753"],["title","The Norsemen in the West (#4)"],["body","compared with that slow nervous advance in the midst of such dead silence!  As nothing followed the sound, however, the suspended legs began to descend slowly again towards the ground, when Leif sneezed!  If Greenland's icy mountains had become one monstrous polar bear, whose powers of voice, frozen for prolonged ages, had at last found vent that night in one concentrated roar, the noise could scarcely have excelled that which instantly exploded from the Norsemen.  The effect on the Skraelingers was almost miraculous.  A bomb-shell bursting in the midst of a hundred and fifty Kilkenny cats could not have been more effective, and the result would certainly have borne some marks of resemblance.  Each hairy creature sprang nearly his own height into the air, and wriggled while there, as if impatient to turn and fly before reaching the ground.  Earth regained, the more active among them overshot and overturned the clumsy, whereby fifty or sixty were instantly cast down, but these rose again like spring-jacks and fled, followed by a roar of laughter from their foes, which, mingled as it was with howls and yells, did infinitely more to appal the Skraelingers than the most savage war-cry could have done.  But they were followed by more than laughter.  The Norsemen immediately gave chase--still yelling and roaring as they ran, for Leif set the example, and his followers remembered his threat.  Karlsefin and Biarne kept one on each side of Leif, about a pace behind him.  \"If they fight as well as they run,\" observed the former, \"they must be troublesome neighbours.\"  \"They are not bad fighters,\" replied Leif; \"but sometimes they deem it wise to run.\"  \"Not unlike to other people in that respect,\" said Biarne; \"but it seems to me that we might overhaul them if we were to push on.\"  He shot up to Leif as he spoke, but the latter checked him.  \"Hold back, Biarne; I mean them no harm, and wish no bloodshed--only they must have a good fright.  The lads, no doubt, would like to run in and make short work of them; but I intend to breathe the lads, which will in the end do just as well as fighting to relieve their feelings.-- Enough.  It is ill talking and running.\"  They were silent after that, and ran thus for fully an hour, at nearly the top of their speed.  But Leif sometimes checked his men, and sometimes urged them on, so that they fancied he was chasing with full intent to run the Skraelingers down.  When the fugitives showed signs of flagging, he uttered a tremendous roar, and his men echoed it, sending such a thrill to the hearts of the Skraelingers that they seemed to recover fresh wind and strength; then he pushed after them harder than ever, and so managed that, without catching or killing one, he terrified them almost out of their wits, and ran them nearly to death.  At last they came to a place where there was an abrupt bend in the mountains.  Here Leif resolved to let them go.  When they were pretty near the cliff round which the path turned, he put on what, in modern sporting phraseology, is termed a spurt, and came up so close with the flying band that those in rear began to glance despairingly over their shoulders.  Suddenly Leif gave vent to a roar, into which he threw all his remaining strength.  It was taken up and prolonged by his men.  The horror-struck Skraelingers shrieked in reply, swept like a torrent round the projecting cliff, and disappeared!  Leif stopped at once, and held up his hand.  All his men stopped short also, and though they heard the Skraelingers still howling as they fled, no one followed them any farther.  Indeed, most of the Norsemen were panting vehemently, and rather glad than otherwise to be allowed to halt.  There were, however, two young men among them--tall, strong-boned, and thin, but with broad shoulders, and grave, earnest, though not exactly handsome countenances--who appeared to be perfectly cool and in good wind after their long run.  Leif noticed them at once.  \"Yonder youths seem to think little of this sort of thing,\" he said to Karlsefin.  \"You are right, Leif; it is mere child's play to them.  These are the two Scots--the famous runners--whom I was charged by King Olaf to present to you.  Why, these men, I'll engage to say, could overtake the Skraelingers even yet, if they chose.\"  \"Say you so?\" cried Leif.  \"Do they speak Norse?\"  \"Yes; excellently well.\"  \"Their names?\"  \"The one is Heika, the other Hake.\"  \"Ho!  Hake and Heika, come hither,\" cried Leif, beckoning to the men, and hastening round the point, where the Skraelingers could be seen nearly a mile off, and still running as if all the evil spirits of the North were after them.  \"See there, carls; think you that ye could overtake these rascals?\"  The Scots looked at each other, nodded, smiled, and said they thought they could.  \"Do it, then.  Let them see how you can use your legs, and give them a shout as you draw near; but have a care: do them no hurt, and see that they do no injury to you.  Take no arms; your legs must suffice on this occasion.\"  The Scots looked again at each other, and laughed, as if they enjoyed the joke; then they started off like a couple of deer at a pace which no Norseman legs had ever before equalled, or even approached.  Leif, Biarne, and the men gazed in speechless wonder, much to the amusement of Karlsefin and Thorward, while Hake and Heika made straight for the flying band and came up with them.  They shouted wildly as they drew near.  The Skraelingers looked back, and seeing only two unarmed men, stopped to receive them.  \"As the saying goes,\" remarked Biarne, \"a stern chase is a long one; but to-night proves the truth of that other saying, that there is no rule without an exception.\"  \"What are they doing now?\" cried Leif, laughing.  \"See--they are mad!\"  Truly it seemed as if they were; for, after separating and coursing twice completely round the astonished natives, the two Scots performed a species of war-dance before them, which had a sort of fling about it, more easily conceived than described.  In the middle of this they made a dart at the group so sudden and swift that Hake managed to overturn Flatface with a tremendous buffet, and Heika did the same to his second in command with an energetic cuff.  The Skraelingers were taken so thoroughly by surprise that the Scots had sheered off and got out of reach before a spear could be thrown.  Of course a furious rush was made at them, but the hairy men might as well have chased the wind.  After tormenting and tantalising them a little longer, the Scots returned at full speed to their friends, and the Skraelingers, glad to be rid of them, hastened to seek the shelter of the gloomy gorge from which they had originally issued, \"like a wolf on the fold.\"    CHAPTER FOUR.  IMPORTANT EVENTS TRANSPIRE, WHICH END IN A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY.  Some weeks afterwards, Karlsefin and Gudrid went down to walk together on the sea-beach.  It would appear that lovers were as fond of rambling together in those olden times as they are in these modern days.  It was evening when they went to ramble thus--another evidence of similarity in taste between the moderns and ancients.  \"Karlsefin,\" said Gudrid, stopping at the margin of the fiord, and looking pensively towards the horizon, where golden clouds and air and sea appeared to mingle harmoniously, \"I wonder that you, with good ships and many stout men and plenty of means, should choose to remain in this barren spot, instead of searching out the famous Vinland and making a settlement there.\"  \"This barren spot is very bright to me, Gudrid; I have no desire to leave it yet a while.  Since you and I were betrothed the ocean has lost its attractions.  Besides, would you have me set out on a voyage of discovery at the beginning of winter.\"  \"Nay; but you do not even talk about going when spring comes round.\"  \"Because I have other things to talk of, Gudrid.\"  \"I fear me that you are a lazy man,\" returned the widow, with a smile, \"and will prove but a sorry husband.  Just think,\" she added, with sudden animation, \"what a splendid country it must be; and what a desirable change for all of us.  Thick and leafy woods like those of old Norway, instead of these rugged cliffs and snow-clad hills.  Fields of waving grass and rye, instead of moss-covered rocks and sandy soil. Trees large enough to build houses and merchant-ships, instead of willow bushes that are fit for nothing except to save our poor cattle from starvation when the hay crop runs out; besides, longer sunshine in winter and more genial warmth all the year round, instead of howling winds and ice and snow.  Truly I think our adopted home here has been woefully misnamed.\"  \"And yet I love it, Gudrid, for I find the atmosphere genial and the sunshine very bright.\"  \"Foolish man!\" said Gudrid, with a little laugh.  \"And then,\" she added, recurring to her theme, \"there are grapes,--though, to be sure, I know not what these are, never having tasted them.  Biarne says they are very good--do you think so too?\"  \"They are magnificent,\" answered Karlsefin.  \"In southern lands, where Tyrker comes from, they have a process whereby they can make a drink from grapes, which maddens youth and quickens the pulse of age,-- something like our own beer.\"  \"It does not please me to hear that,\" replied Gudrid gravely; \"some of our carls are too fond of beer.  When old Heriulf was sick, a little of it did him good, and when Eric the Red was in his last days he seemed to gather a little strength and comfort from beer; but I never could perceive that it ever did anything to young men except make them boast, and talk nonsense, and look foolish,--or, what is worse, quarrel and fight.\"  \"Right, Gudrid, right,\" said Karlsefin; \"my opinion at least is the same as yours, whether it be right or wrong.  There is some reason in applying heat to cold, but it seems to me unnecessary to add heat to warmth, artificial strength to natural vigour, and it is dangerous sometimes"]]]
