After that the line ran steadily for a few seconds, and no signals came. Then it ceased to run, and poor Oliver's fears began to rush in upon him again, but he was speedily relieved by feeling three distinct and vigorous pulls.  \"Thank God, he's safe,\" cried the boy.  \"Now then, pass along the hawser--quick!\"  This was done, the light line was attached to a three-inch rope, and the party on the wreck waited anxiously.  \"Give it a pull, Olly, by way of signal,\" suggested Master Trench.  \"He did not tell me to do that, father,\" returned the boy, hesitating.  \"No doubt he forgot it in the hurry--try it, anyhow.\"  A hearty pull on the line was accordingly given, and they soon had the satisfaction of seeing the hawser move over the side and run towards the shore.  When it ceased to run out they knew that Paul must have got hold of the end of it, so, making their end fast to the heel of the bowsprit, they waited, for as yet the rope lay deep in the heaving waters, and quite useless as a means of escape.  Presently the rope began to jerk, then it tightened, soon the bight of it rose out of the sea and remained there--rigid.  \"Well done, Paul,\" exclaimed the skipper, when this was accomplished. \"Now, Olly, you go first, you're light.\"  But the boy hesitated.  \"No, father, you first,\" he said.  \"Obey orders, Olly,\" returned the skipper sternly.  Without another word Oliver got upon the rope and proceeded to clamber along it.  The operation was by no means easy, but the boy was strong and active, and the water not very cold.  It leaped up and drenched him, however, as he passed the lowest point of the bight, and thereafter the weight of his wet garments delayed him, so that on nearing the shore he was pretty well exhausted.  There, however, he found Paul up to the waist in the sea waiting for him, and the last few yards of the journey were traversed in his friend's arms.  By means of this rope was every man of the _Water Wagtail's_ crew saved from a watery grave.  They found that the island on which they had been cast was sufficiently large to afford them shelter, and a brief survey of it proved that there was both wood and water enough to serve them, but nothing of animal or vegetable life was to be found.  This was serious, because all their provisions were lost with the wrecked portion of the ship, so that starvation stared them in the face.  \"If only the rum-kegs had been saved,\" said one of the men, when they assembled, after searching the island, to discuss their prospects, \"we might, at least, have led a merry life while it lasted.\"  \"Humph!  Much good that would do you when you came to think over it in the next world,\" said Grummidge contemptuously.  \"I don't believe in the next world,\" returned the first speaker gruffly.  \"A blind man says he doesn't see the sun, and don't believe in it,\" rejoined Grummidge: \"does that prove that there's no sun?\"  Here Master Trench interposed.  \"My lads,\" he said, \"don't you think that instead of talking rubbish it would be wise to scatter yourselves along the coast and see what you can pick up from the wreck?  Depend on't some of the provisions have been stranded among the rocks, and, as they will be smashed to pieces before long, the sooner we go about it the better.  The truth is, that while you have been wastin' your time running about the island, Master Burns and I have been doin' this, an' we've saved some things already--among them a barrel of pork.  Come, rouse up and go to work--some to the shore, others to make a camp in the bush.\"  This advice seemed so good that the men acted on it at once, with the result that before dark they had rescued two more barrels of pork and a barrel of flour from the grasp of the sea, besides some cases of goods which they had not taken time to examine.  Returning from the shore together, laden with various rescued articles, Paul and Oliver halted and sat down on a rock to rest for a few minutes.  \"Olly,\" said the former, \"what was that I saw you wrapping up in a bit of tarred canvas, and stuffing so carefully under the breast of your coat, soon after the ship struck?\"  \"Mother's last letter to me,\" said the boy, with a flush of pleasure as he tapped his breast.  \"I have it safe here, and scarcely damaged at all.\"  \"Strange,\" remarked Paul, as he pulled a well-covered packet from his own breast-pocket; \"strange that your mind and mine should have been running on the same subject.  See here, this is _my_ mother's last gift to me before she died--a letter, too, but it is God's letter to fallen man.\"  With great care the young man unrolled the packet and displayed a well-worn manuscript copy of a portion of the Gospel of John.  \"This is copied,\" he said, \"from the translation of God's Word by the great Wycliffe.  It was given to my mother by an old friend, and was, as I have said, her parting gift to me.\"  The friends were interrupted in their examination of this interesting M.S. by the arrival of one of the sailors, with whom they returned to the encampment in the bush.    CHAPTER THREE.  FIRST EXPERIENCES ON THE ISLAND.  A wonderfully picturesque appearance did these shipwrecked mariners present that night when, under the shelter of the shrubbery that crowned their small island, they kindled several camp-fires, and busied themselves in preparing supper.  As there was no law in the island--and our skipper, having lost his ship, forbore to assert any right to command--every one naturally did what seemed right in his own eyes.  As yet there had arisen no bone of contention among them.  Of food they had secured enough for at least a few days.  Fire they had procured by means of flint, steel, and tinder.  A clear spring furnished them with water, and ships' buckets washed ashore enabled them to convey the same to their encampment.  Fortunately, no rum-kegs had been found, so that evil passions were not stirred up, and, on the whole, the first night on the island was spent in a fair degree of harmony--considering the character of the men.  Those who had been kindred souls on board ship naturally drew together on shore, and kindled their several fires apart.  Thus it came to pass that the skipper and his son, the two mates, and Paul Burns found themselves assembled round the same fire.  But the two mates, it is right to add, were only sympathetic in a small degree, because of their former position as officers, and their recent imprisonment together.  In reality they were men of no principle and of weak character, whose tendency was always to throw in their lot with the winning side.  Being a little uncertain as to which was the winning side that night, they had the wisdom to keep their own counsel.  Oliver presided over the culinary department.  \"You see, I'm rather fond of cookin',\" he said, apologetically, \"that's why I take it in hand.\"  \"Ah, that comes of his bein' a good boy to his mother,\" said Master Trench in explanation, and with a nod of approval.  \"Olly was always ready to lend her a helpin' hand in the house at anything that had to be done, which has made him a Jack-of-all-trades--cookin' among the rest, as you see.\"  \"A pity that the means of displaying his powers are so limited,\" said Paul, who busied himself in levelling the ground beside the fire for their beds.  \"Limited!\" exclaimed Trench, \"you are hard to please, Master Paul; I have lived on worse food than salt pork and pancakes.\"  \"If so, father,\" said Oliver, as he deftly tossed one of the cakes into the air and neatly caught it on its other side in the pan, \"you must either have had the pork without the pancakes or the pancakes without the pork.\"  \"Nay, Master Shallowpate, I had neither.\"  \"What! did you live on nothing?\"  \"On nothing better than boiled sheepskin--and it was uncommon tough as well as tasteless; but it is wonderful what men will eat when they're starving.\"  \"I think, father,\" returned the boy, as he tossed and deftly caught the cake again, \"that it is more wonderful what men will eat when they're _not_ starving!  Of all the abominations that mortal man ever put between his grinders, I think the worst is that vile stuff--\"  He was interrupted by a sudden outbreak of wrath at the fire next to theirs, where Big Swinton, Grummidge, and several others were engaged, like themselves, in preparing supper.  \"There will be trouble in the camp before long, I see plainly enough,\" remarked Paul, looking in the direction of the disputants.  \"These two men, Swinton and Grummidge, are too well-matched in body and mind and self-will to live at peace, and I foresee that they will dispute your right to command.\"  \"They won't do that, Paul,\" returned Trench quietly, \"for I have already given up a right which I no longer possess.  When the _Water Wagtail_ went on the rocks, my reign came to an end.  For the future we have no need to concern ourselves.  The man with the most powerful will and the strongest mind will naturally come to the top--and that's how it _should_ be.  I think that all the troubles of mankind arise from our interfering with the laws of Nature.\"  \"Agreed, heartily,\" replied Paul, \"only I would prefer to call them the laws of God.  By the way, Master Trench, I have not yet told you that I have in my possession some of these same laws in a book.\"  \"Have you, indeed?--in a book!  That's a rare and not altogether a safe possession now-a-days.\"  \"You speak the sober truth, Master Trench,\" returned Paul, putting his hand into a breast-pocket and drawing forth the packet which contained the fragment of the Gospel of John.  \"Persecution because of our beliefs is waxing hotter and hotter just now in unfortunate England.  However, we run no risk of being roasted alive in Newfoundland for reading God's blessed Word--see, there it is.  A portion of the Gospel of John in manuscript, copied from the English translation of good Master Wycliffe.\"  \"A good and true man, I've heard say,\" responded"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21710"],["title","The Crew of the Water Wagtail (#3)"],["body"," skipper, as he turned over the leaves of the precious document with a species of solemn wonder, for it was the first time he had either seen or handled a portion of the Bible.  \"Pity that such a friend of the people should not have lived to the age o' that ancient fellow--what's his name--Thoosle, something or other?\"  \"Methuselah,\" said Paul; \"you're right there, Master Trench.  What might not a good man like Wycliffe have accomplished if he had been permitted to live and teach and fight for the truth for nine hundred and sixty-nine years?\"  \"You don't mean to say he lived as long as that?\" exclaimed the boy, looking up from his pots and pans.  \"Indeed I do.\"  \"Well, well! he must have been little better than a live mummy by the end of that time!\" replied Oliver, resuming his interest in his pots and pans.  \"But how came you to know about all that Master Paul, if this is all the Scripture you've had?\" asked Trench.  \"My mother was deeply learned in the Scriptures,\" answered Paul, \"and she taught me diligently from my boyhood.  The way she came to be so learned is curious.  I will tell you how it came about, while we are doing justice to Oliver's cookery.\"  \"You must know, Master Trench,\" continued Paul, after the first demands of appetite had been appeased, \"that my dear mother was a true Christian from her youth.  Her father was converted to Christ by one of that noble band of missionaries who were trained by the great Wycliffe, and whom he sent throughout England to preach the Gospel to the poor, carrying in their hands manuscript portions of that Gospel, translated by Wycliffe into plain English.  You see, that curious invention of the German, John Gutenberg--I mean printing by movable types--was not known at that time, and even now, although half a century has passed since the Bible was printed abroad in Latin, no one with means and the power to do it has yet arisen to print an English Bible, but the day is not far distant when that work shall be done, I venture to prophesy, though I make no pretence to be among the prophets!  \"Well, as I was going to say, the missionary was a hoary old man when he preached the sermon that turned my grandfather from darkness to light. My grandfather was just fifteen years old at that time.  Ten years later the same missionary came to grandfather's house, worn out with years and labours, and died there, leaving all his treasure to his host.  That treasure was a small portion of the New Testament in English, copied from Wycliffe's own translation.  You may be sure that my grandfather valued the legacy very highly.  When he died he left it to my mother. About that time my mother married and went to live on the banks of the Severn.  Not far from our farm there dwelt a family of the name of Hutchins.  The father had changed his name and taken refuge there during the recent civil wars.  This family possessed a Latin Bible, and the head of it was well acquainted with its contents.  It was through him that my mother became well acquainted with the Old as well as the New Testament, and thus it was that I also came in course of time to know about Methuselah, and a good many more characters about whom I may perhaps tell you one of these days.\"  \"So, then, this is the manuscript the old missionary carried about, is it?\" said Trench, fingering the fragment tenderly.  \"Ay, and a good translation it is, I have been told by one whom most people would think too young to be a judge.  You must know that this Mr Hutchins has a son named William, who is considerably younger than I am, but he is such a clever, precocious fellow, that before he left home for college I used to find him a most interesting companion.  Indeed, I owe to him much of what little I have learned, for he is a wonderful linguist, being able to read Hebrew and Greek about as easily as Latin or English.  He is at Oxford now--at least he was there when I last heard of him.  Moreover, it was through the Hutchins' family, in a roundabout way, that _your_ mother, Olly, came to learn to write such letters as you have got so carefully stowed away there in your breast-pocket.\"  \"Good luck to the Hutchins' family then, say I,\" returned Olly, \"for I'm glad to be able to read, though, on account of the scarcity and dearness of manuscripts, I don't have the chance of makin' much use of my knowledge.  But you puzzle me, Paul.  It was poor Lucy Wentworth who used to live with us, and who died only last year, that taught me to read, and I never heard her mention the name of Hutchins.  Did you, father?\"  \"No, I never did, Olly.  She said she had lived with a family named Tyndale before she came to us, poor thing!  She was an amazin' clever girl to teach, and made your mother good at it in a wonderful short time.  She tried me too, but it was of no use, I was too tough an' old!\"  \"Just so, Master Trench,\" rejoined Paul.  \"Hutchins' real name was Tyndale, and he had resumed the name before Lucy Wentworth went to live with the family.  So, you see, Olly, you are indebted, in a roundabout way, as I said, to the Tyndales for your mother's letter.  William will make his mark pretty deeply on the generation, I think, if God spares him.\"  Little did Paul Burns think, when he made this prophetic speech by the camp-fire on that distant isle of the sea, that, even while he spoke William Tyndale was laying the foundation of that minute knowledge of the Greek and Hebrew languages, which afterwards enabled him to give the Bible to England in her own tongue, and that so ably translated, that, after numerous revisions by the most capable of scholars, large portions of his work remain unaltered at the present day.  The night was far spent, and the other members of the camp had been long buried in slumber before Paul and Trench and Oliver could tear themselves away from the manuscript Gospel of John.  The latter two, who knew comparatively little of its contents, were at first impressed chiefly with the fact that they were examining that rare and costly article--a book, and a forbidden book, too, for the reading of which many a man and woman had been burned to death in times past--but they became still more deeply impressed as Paul went on reading and commenting and pointing out the value of the Book as God's own \"Word\" to fallen man.  \"Here is a promise to rest upon,\" said Paul, as he finally closed the book and repeated the verse from memory, \"Jesus said, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\"  \"Ay, that's it, Paul--_free_!  We're all slaves, more or less, to something or other.  What we all want is to be _free_,\" said Master Trench, as he drew his blanket round him, pillowed his head on his cloak, and went to sleep.  Silently Paul and Oliver followed his example, the fires died out, and in a few minutes the slumbering camp was shrouded in the mantle of night.  Energetic action was the order of the next day, for those shipwrecked mariners knew well enough that nothing but hard and steady labour could enable them to live on an apparently desolate island.  By daybreak most of the crew had scattered themselves along the shores, or over the interior, to spy out the land.  About two hours later they began to drop into camp as hungry as hawks, each carrying the result of his researches in his arms or on his shoulders.  \"Well done, Squill!\" said Paul, who chanced to be first back in camp, with a huge sail bundled up on his shoulder, and who, just then, was busy blowing up his fire; \"got another barrel of pork, eh?\"  \"It's myself as doesn't know, sur,\" answered Squill, \"and it wasn't me as found it, but Jim Heron there.  I only helped to sling it on the pole, and shoulder an end.  It's aither pork or gunpowther, so if it ain't good for a blow out it'll be good for a blow up, anyhow.\"  \"Did you see little Oliver anywhere?\" asked Paul.  \"Ay, sur, I saw him on the shore, bringing up what seemed to me the ship's bowsprit--anyhow, a spar o' some sort, about as big as he could haul along.\"  \"Just so,\" returned Paul, with a laugh, \"a ridge-pole for our tent. He's a smart boy, little Olly.\"  \"Sure he's all that, sur, and more.  Here he comes, blowin' like a porpoise.\"  Sure enough, Oliver appeared at the moment, dragging a heavy spar behind him.  Several of the men appeared at the same time, staggering through the bushes, with various loads of wreckage, which they flung down, and noisily began discussing their experiences as they lighted the fires and prepared breakfast.  \"Here comes Little Stubbs,\" cried Jim Heron.  \"What fortune, comrade?\"  \"Good fortune, though my load is the lightest yet brought in.\"  He flung down a small piece of wood with an air of satisfaction.  \"Why, it's only a boat's rudder!\" said Oliver.  \"Ay, so it is, and the boat lies where I picked it up, but it was too heavy to bring into camp without your assistance, boy.  And the best of it is that it's not much damaged.  Very little repair will make her fit for sea again.\"  This was indeed a find of immense importance, and the assembled party discussed the event in all its bearings till their mouths were partially stopped by pork and pancakes.  In the midst of this they were interrupted by the arrival of Big Swinton, George Blazer, and Grummidge with another find, which afterwards cost them much trouble and regret--namely, a couple of young lads, natives, whom they led into camp with their wrists tightly bound behind their backs.    CHAPTER FOUR.  STRANGE VISITORS--DARK PLOTS--AND EVIL PURPOSES.  The youths who had been captured were simple savages, with very little clothing, and with an expression of considerable alarm on their faces. As was afterwards learned, they had been coasting along the shore of the large neighbouring island in a canoe; had observed the strange fires in the night-time, and had crossed over the channel to see what could be the cause thereof.  On reaching the highest part of the island they "]]]
