Then the yellow hue of sunrise came, a good while before the sun himself rose.  The last of the bright stars were put out by the flood of light, and multitudes of little birds on shore began to chirp their morning song; and who can say that this was not a hymn of praise to God, when, in the Holy Bible itself, in the 150th Psalm, we find it written, \"Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.\"  At last the sun burst forth in all his golden glory.  Water, earth, and sky glowed as if they had been set on fire.  What a blessed influence the sun has upon this world!  It resembles the countenance of a loving father beaming in upon his family, driving away clouds, and diffusing warmth and joy.  The birds were now all astir together, insomuch that the air seemed alive with them.  There are small white gulls, with red legs and red beaks, in those large inland lakes, just as there are on the ocean. These began to utter their sweet wild cries so powerfully that they almost drowned the noise of all the rest.  Yet the united chorus of the whole was not harsh.  It was softened and mellowed by distance, and fell on the ears of the two hunters as pleasantly as the finest music does in the ears of men trained to sweet sounds from infancy.  Not until the sun had ascended a considerable way on its course through the sky, did Jasper think it necessary to lay down his paddle.  By that time the upper end of the lake had been reached, and the hunter had run the canoe close to a ledge of flat rock and jumped ashore, saying that it was time for breakfast.  \"I had almost got to believe I was in paradise,\" said Heywood, as he stepped ashore.  \"I often think there's a good deal of the garden of Eden still left in this world,\" replied Jasper, as he carried the kettle up to the level part of the rock and began to kindle a fire, while the Indian, as usual, hewed the wood.  \"If we could only make use of God's gifts instead of abusin' them, I do believe we might be very happy all our days.\"  \"See there, Jasper, is one of the birds I want so much to get hold of. I want to make a drawing of him.  Would you object to spend a shot on such game.\"  Heywood pointed as he spoke to a grey bird, about the size of a blackbird, which sat on a branch close above his head.  This creature is called by the fur-traders a whisky-John, and it is one of the most impudent little birds in the world!  Wherever you go throughout the country, there you find whisky-Johns ready to receive and welcome you, as if they were the owners of the soil.  They are perfectly fearless; they will come and sit on a branch within a yard of your hand, when you are eating, and look at you in the most inquisitive manner.  If they could speak, they could not say more plainly, \"What have you got there?--give me some!\"  If you leave the mouth of your provision sack open they are sure to jump into it.  When you are done eating they will scarcely let you six yards away before they make a dash at the crumbs; and if you throw sticks or stones at them, they will hop out of the way, but they will not take to flight!  \"It would be a pity to waste powder on them critters,\" said Jasper, \"but I'll catch one for you.\"  As he said this he took a few crumbs of broken meat from the bottom of the provision sack and spread them on his right hand; then he lay down under a bush, covered his face with a few leaves, and thrust out his hand.  Heywood and the Indian retired a few paces and stood still to await the result.  In a few seconds a whisky-John came flying towards the open hand, and alighted on a branch within a yard of it.  Here he shook his feathers and looked very bold, but suspicious, for a few minutes, turning first one eye towards the hand, and then the other.  After a little he hopped on a branch still nearer, and, seeing no motion in the hand, he at last hopped upon the palm and began to peck the crumbs.  Instantly the fingers closed, and Jasper caught him by the toes, whereupon the whisky-John began to scream furiously with rage and terror.  But I am bound to say there was more of rage than of terror in his cry.  Jasper handed the passionate bird over to the artist, who tried to make a portrait of him, but he screamed and pecked so fiercely that Heywood was obliged to let him go after making a rough sketch.  Breakfast was a repetition of the supper of the night before; it was soon disposed of, and the three travellers again set forth.  This time Jasper sang one of the beautiful canoe songs peculiar to that country, and Heywood and Arrowhead, both of whom had good voices, joined in the chorus.  They soon passed from the lake into the river by which it was fed.  At first the current of this river was sluggish; but as they ascended, it became stronger, and was broken here and there by rapids.  The severe toil of travelling in the backwoods now began.  To paddle on a level lake all day is easy enough, for, when you get tired, you can lay down the paddle and rest.  But in the river this is impossible, because of the current.  The only way to get a rest is to push the bow of the canoe ashore.  It was a fine sight to see the movements of Jasper and the Indian when they came to the first rapid.  Heywood knew that he could be of no use, so, like a wise man, he sat still and looked on.  The rapid was a very strong one, but there were no falls in it; only a furious gush of water over the broken bed of the river, where many large rocks rose up and caught the current, hurling the water back in white foam.  Any one who knew not what these hunters could do, would have laughed if you had told him they were about to ascend that rapid in such an egg-shell of a canoe!  They began by creeping up, in-shore, as far as they could.  Then they dashed boldly out into the stream, and the current whirled them down with lightning speed, but suddenly the canoe came to a halt in the very middle of the stream!  Every rock in a rapid has a long tail of still water below it; the canoe had got into one of these tails or eddies, and there it rested securely.  A few yards higher up there was another rock, nearer to the opposite bank, and the eddy which tailed off from it came down a little lower than the rock behind which the canoe now lay.  There was a furious gush of water between them and this eddy, but the men knew what the canoe could bear, and their nerves were strong and steady. Across they went like a shot.  They were swept down to the extreme point of the eddy, but a few powerful strokes of the paddle sent them into it, and next moment they were floating behind the second rock, a few yards higher up the stream.  Thus they darted from rock to rock, gaining a few yards at each dart, until at last they swept into the smooth water at the head of the rapid.  Many a time was this repeated that day, for rapids were numerous; their progress was therefore slow.  Sometimes they came to parts of the river where the stream was very strong and deep, but not broken by rocks, so that they had no eddies to dart into.  In such places Arrowhead and Heywood walked along the bank, and hauled the canoe up by means of a line, while Jasper remained in it to steer.  This was hard work, for the banks in places were very steep, in some parts composed of soft mud, into which the men sank nearly up to their knees, and in other places covered so thickly with bushes that it was almost impossible to force a path through them.  Jasper and the Indian took the steering-paddle by turns, and when Heywood required a rest he got into his place in the middle of the canoe; but they never halted for more than a few minutes at a time.  All day they paddled and dragged the canoe slowly up against the strong current, and when night closed in they found they had advanced only three miles on their journey.  The last obstacle they came to that day was a roaring waterfall about thirty feet high.  Here, it might have been thought, was an effectual check to them at last.  Nothing without wings could have gone up that waterfall, which filled the woods with the thunder of its roar; but the canoe had no wings, so what was to be done?  To one ignorant of the customs of that country, going on would have seemed impossible, but nothing can stop the advance of a backwoods voyager.  If his canoe won't carry him, he carries his canoe!  Jasper and his friends did so on the present occasion.  They had reached what is called a portage or carrying-place, and there are hundreds of such places all over Rupert's Land.  On arriving at the foot of the fall, Heywood set off at once to a spot from which he could obtain a good view of it, and sat down to sketch, while his companions unloaded the canoe and lifted it out of the water. Then Jasper collected together as much of the baggage as he could carry, and clambered up the bank with it, until he reached the still water at the top of the fall.  Here he laid it down and returned for another load.  Meanwhile Arrowhead lifted the canoe with great ease, placed it on his shoulders, and bore it to the same place.  When all had been carried up, the canoe was launched into the quiet water a few hundred yards above the fall, the baggage was replaced in it, and the travellers were ready to continue their voyage.  This whole operation is called _making_ _a_ _portage_.  It took about an hour to make this portage.  Portages vary in length and in numbers.  In some rivers they are few and far between; in others they are so numerous that eight or twelve may have to be made in a day.  Many of the portages are not more than an eighth of a mile in length, and are crossed for the purpose of avoiding a waterfall.  Some are four or five miles in extent, for many long reaches in the rivers are so broken by falls and rapids, that the voyagers find it their best plan to take canoes and baggage on their backs and cut across country for several miles; thus they avoid rough places altogether.  Jasper delayed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21715"],["title","Away in the Wilderness (#4)"],["body","for half an hour, in order to give Heywood time to finish his sketch of the fall.  It began to grow dark when they again embarked, so, after paddling up stream until a convenient place was found, they put ashore and encamped within sight of another waterfall, the roar of which, softened by distance, fell upon their ears all that night like the sound of pleasant music.    CHAPTER SIX.  THE OUTPOST.  On the morning of the second day after the events which I have described in the last chapter, our three travellers arrived at one of the solitary outposts belonging to the fur-traders.  It stood on the banks of the river, and consisted of four small houses made of logs.  It covered about an acre of ground, and its only defence was a wall of wooden posts, about two inches apart, which completely surrounded the buildings.  \"This fort is a namesake of mine,\" said Jasper, when they first sighted it; \"they call it Jasper's House.  I spent a day at it when I was hereaway two years ago.\"  \"Who is in charge of it?\" asked Heywood.  \"A gentleman named Grant, I believe,\" replied Jasper.  \"That white painted house in the middle of the square is his.  The other house on the right, painted yellow, is where the men live.  Mr Grant has only got six men, poor fellow, to keep him company; he seldom sees a new face here from one end of the year to the other.  But he makes a trip once a year to the head post of the district with his furs, and that's a sort of break to him.\"  \"Are there no women at the place?\" inquired the artist.  \"Only two,\" replied Jasper.  \"At least there were two when I was here last; they were the wives of two of the men, Indian women they were, with few brains, and little or nothin' to say; but they were useful critters for all that, for they could make coats, and trousers, and moccasins, and mittens, and they were first-rate cooks, besides bein' handy at almost every kind o' work.  They could even use the gun.  I've heard o' them bringin' down a wild goose on the wing, when none o' the men were at hand to let drive at the passing flock.  I do believe that's Mr Grant himself standin' at the gate o' the fort.\"  Jasper was right.  The master of Jasper's House, a big, hearty-looking man of about five-and-forty, was standing at the gate of his lonely residence, leaning against one of the door-posts, with his hands in his breeches pockets and a short pipe in his mouth.  His summer employments had come to an end,--no Indians had been near the place for many weeks, and he happened to have nothing at that time to do but eat, smoke, and sleep; which three occupations he usually attended to with much earnestness.  Mr Grant did not observe the canoe approaching from below, for at that time his attention was attracted to something up the river.  Suddenly he started, took his pipe from his lips, and, bending forward, listened with deep, earnest attention.  A faint murmur came floating down on the breeze, sending a thrill of pleasure to the heart of the solitary man, as well it might, for a new face was a rare sight at Jasper's House.  At last a loud shout rang through the forest, and five Indian canoes swept round a point of rocks, and came suddenly into view, the men tossing their paddles in the air and sending rainbows of spray over their heads as they made for the landing-place.  These were three or four families of Indians, who had come from a long hunting expedition laden with rich furs.  Their canoes, though small and light, could hold a wonderful quantity. In the foremost sat a young savage, with a dark-brown face, glittering black eyes, and stiff black hair hanging straight down all round his head, except in front, where it was cut short off just above the eyes in order to let his face appear.  That fellow's canoe, besides himself, carried his three wives--he was a good hunter, and could afford to have three.  Had he been a bad hunter, he would have had to content himself, poor fellow, with one!  The canoe also contained six or seven heavy packs of furs; a haunch of venison; six pairs of rabbits; several ducks and geese; a lump of bear's meat; two little boys and a girl; a large tent made of deer-skins; four or five tin kettles; two or three dirty-looking dogs and a gun; several hatchets and a few blankets; two babies and a dead beaver.  In short, there was almost no end to what that bark canoe could hold; yet that Indian, with the stiff black hair, could lift it off the ground, when empty, lay it on his shoulders, and carry it for miles through the forest.  The other canoes were much the same as this one.  In a few minutes they were at the bank, close under the fort, and about the same time Jasper and his friends leaped ashore, and were heartily welcomed by Mr Grant, who was glad enough to see Indians, but was overjoyed to meet with white men.  \"Glad to see you, Jasper,\" cried Mr Grant, shaking the hunter by the hand; \"right glad to see you.  It does good to a man to see an old friend like you turn up so unexpectedly.  Happy, also, to meet with you, Mr Heywood.  It's a pleasure I don't often have, to meet with a white stranger in this wilderness.  Pray, come with me to the house.\"  The fur-trader turned to the Indians, and, saying a few words to them in their own language, led the way to his residence.  Meanwhile, the Indians had tossed everything out of the canoes upon the bank, and the spot which had been so quiet and solitary half an hour before, became a scene of the utmost animation and confusion.  While the women were employed in erecting the tents, the men strode up to the hall of reception, where Mr Grant supplied them with tobacco and food to their hearts' content.  These natives, who, owing to the reddish copper-colour of their skins, are called red-men,--were dressed chiefly in clothes made of deer-skin; cut much in the same fashion as the garments worn by Jasper Derry.  The women wore short gowns, also made of leather, and leggings of the same material; but it was noticeable that the women had leggings more ornamented with gay beads than those of the men, and they wore gaudy kerchiefs round their necks.  These women were poor looking creatures, however.  They had a subdued, humble look, like dogs that are used to being kicked; very different from the bold free bearing of the men.  The reason of this was, that they were treated by the men more as beasts of burden than companions. Women among the North American Indians have a hard time of it, poor creatures.  While their lords and masters are out at the chase, or idly smoking round the fire, the Indian women are employed in cutting firewood and drawing water.  Of course, they do all the cooking, and, as the eating always continues, so the cooking never stops.  When these more severe labours are over, they employ their time in making and ornamenting coats, leggings, and moccasins--and very beautiful work they can turn out of their hands.  On the voyage, the women use the paddle as well as the men, and, in journeying through the woods, they always carry or drag the heaviest loads.  For all this they get few thanks, and often when the husbands become jealous, they get severely beaten and kicked.  It is always thus among savages; and it would seem that, just in proportion as men rise from the savage to the civilised state, they treat their women better.  It is certain that when man embraces the blessed gospel of Christ and learns to follow the law of love, he places woman not only on a level with himself, but even above himself, and seeks her comfort and happiness before he seeks his own.  Few of the Red-men of North America are yet Christians, therefore they have no gallantry about them--no generous and chivalrous feelings towards the weaker sex.  Most of their women are downtrodden and degraded.  The first night at Jasper's House was spent in smoking and talking. Here our friend Jasper Derry got news of Marie.  To his immense delight he learned that she was well, and living with her father at Fort Erie, near the plains, or prairies as they are called, on the Saskatchewan River.  A long journey still lay before our bold hunter, but that was nothing to him.  He felt quite satisfied to hear that the girl of his heart was well, and still unmarried.  Next day the serious business of trading commenced at the outpost.  \"I should like to get that powder and ball before you begin to trade with the Indians, Mr Grant,\" said Jasper, after breakfast was concluded, \"I'm anxious to be off as soon as possible.\"  \"No, no, Jasper, I'll not give you a single charge of powder or an ounce of lead this day.  You must spend another night with me, my man; I have not had half my talk out with you.  You have no need to hurry, for Marie does not know you are coming, so of course she can't be impatient.\"  Mr Grant said this with a laugh, for he knew the state of Jasper's heart, and understood why he was so anxious to hasten away.  \"Besides,\" continued the fur-trader, \"Mr Heywood has not half finished the drawing of my fort, which he began yesterday, and I want him to make me a copy of it.\"  \"I shall be delighted to do so,\" said the artist, who was busily engaged in arranging his brushes and colours.  \"Well, well,\" cried Jasper.  \"I suppose I must submit.  I fancy _you_ have no objection to stop here another day, Arrowhead?\"  The Indian nodded gravely, as he squatted down on the floor and began to fill his pipe.  \"That's settled, then,\" said Jasper, \"so I'll go with you to the store, if you'll allow me.\"  \"With all my heart,\" replied the fur-trader, who forthwith led the way to the store, followed by the Indians with their packs of furs.  Now, the store or shop at a Hudson's Bay trading-post is a most interesting and curious place.  To the Indian, especially, it is a sort of enchanted chamber, out of which can be obtained everything known under the sun.  As there can be only one shop or store at a trading-post, it follows that that shop must contain a few articles out of almost"]]]
