If you doubt this, reader, let us assure you that all history asserts it, that recorded facts confirm it, and that our proper attitude in regard to it is to stand amazed, and admit that there are some things in this curious world which \"no fellow can understand.\"  Without apologising for this digression, we return to the thread of our tale.  Finding, then, as we have said, that the British merchantman was not a legitimate foe, the corsair proceeded to look out for a more worthy object of attack--namely, a vessel of some hapless petty state, which, being too venturesome, or too poor to pay black-mail, was at war, perforce, with the Algerines.  Fortune, however, ceased for a short time to be propitious.  No suitable vessel was to be found, therefore Sidi Hassan resolved to exercise the rights of the unusually free and independent power of which he was a worthy representative in a somewhat strange fashion.  Bearing down on the coast, he sailed along it for some time, with the intention of making a bold dash at some small fishing village.  His mate rather objected to this, knowing well that such attempts were too apt to be attended with considerable loss of life; but Sidi Hassan was not a man to be easily turned from his purpose.  The sight of a brig in the offing, however, induced him to run out again to sea.  He was soon within hail, and, finding that the vessel was a Sicilian trader, boarded her at once.  No opposition was offered, the brig being totally without arms and her crew small.  She, like the vessel of our friend Francisco, was laden with wine and fruit.  There were only two passengers on board, but these two were great prizes in Hassan's estimation, being beautiful girls of about seventeen and eighteen respectively.  They were sisters--the elder being on her way with her infant son to join her husband in Malta.  Hassan was glad of the opportunity thus thrown in his way of pleasing his master the Dey of Algiers by presenting to him these unfortunates, whose manners and appearance bespoke them ladies, and at once sent them on board his vessel, along with their money and jewels.  Their wardrobe was distributed among the pirate crew--the money and jewels being the Dey's perquisite.  \"I have a plan in my head,\" said Hassan to his second in command, \"which the capture of this brig has suggested to me.  Go, take charge of our vessel, and send me twenty of the best men of our crew fully armed--also a British Union-jack.  There is a captain of a port in this neighbourhood against whom I have a special grudge, and to whom I would fain give a free passage to Algiers! so make haste.\"  The order was soon executed, and the pirate-vessel ordered to remain where she was while the brig stood inshore and sailed along the coast. In a few hours she was off the port above referred to, when she hove-to, hoisted the British flag, and fired a gun.  The captain of the port innocently put off to the brig, and in a few minutes found himself and his boat's crew taken captive by the Algerines!  Having thus successfully accomplished his design, Hassan returned to his vessel, put a crew on board the second prize, and, directing his course to Africa made all sail for the port of Algiers.  During the voyage the unfortunate captives saw little of each other, nevertheless Mariano saw enough of the sisters, to create in his breast feelings of the tenderest pity--especially for the younger sister, whom he thought rather pretty than otherwise!  As for the Jew, he kept aloof from all the captives, but seemed to have a good understanding with the pirate captain, and to be acquainted with several of his men.    CHAPTER FOUR.  INTRODUCES THE READER TO THE PIRATE CITY, AND TO A FEW OF ITS PECULIARITIES AND PRACTICES.  Permit us now, good reader, to introduce you to the top of a house in Algiers.  The roofs of the houses in the Pirate City are flat--a most admirable Eastern peculiarity which cannot be too strongly recommended to Western builders.  They are, therefore, available as pleasant \"terraces,\" on which you may rise above your cares, to lounge, and smoke--if afflicted with the latter mania--and sip coffee with your wife, (wives, if you be a Turk), or romp with your children--if not too dignified--or cultivate flowers, or read in a state of elevated serenity, or admire the magnificent view of the blue bay, backed by the bluer Jurjura mountains, with the snow-topped range of the Lesser Atlas beyond.  How much wiser thus to utilise one's house-top than to yield it up, rent-free, to cats and sparrows!  Achmet Pasha, the Dey of Algiers at this time, or rather the pirate-king, had a thorough appreciation of the roof of his palace, and spent many hours daily on it, in consultation with his ministers, or in converse with his wives.  As deys went, Achmet was a comparatively respectable man.  He thought no more of cutting off a human head than of docking a rat's tail; but then he did not take a particular pleasure in this employment, and was not naturally cruel, which is more than could be said of many of his predecessors.  He was also said to be a kind husband and a fond father, but as no one, save the wives and children in question, knew anything of the inner and private life of the palace, this must for ever remain a matter of uncertainty.  There was no doubt, however, that he was a tall, handsome, dignified man, in the prime of life, with a stern eye and a pleasant expression of mouth; that, in character, he was bold and resolute; and that, in his jewelled turban, gold-incrusted vestments, and flowing Eastern robes, he looked resplendent.  Courage and resolution were, indeed, qualities without which a Dey of Algiers could scarcely come into existence, because his high position, not being hereditary, was naturally the ambitious goal of all the bold spirits in the Turkish army of janissaries which held the city, with its mixed Arab population, in subjection.  The most common mode of a change of government was the strangulation of the reigning Dey by the man who had power and party influence sufficient to enable him to ascend the vacant throne.  Sometimes the throne thus obtained was held for only a few days, or even hours, when it chanced that there were several factions of pretty equal power, and two or three men of similar vigour in the army.  It is a fact that on more than one occasion three Deys have ascended and sat upon this undesirable throne within twenty-four hours, each having been strangled or having had his head cut off by \"the opposition\" soon after occupying his predecessor's warm seat!  Achmet, however, had reigned for a considerable period in peace, and was on the whole a popular ruler.  At the time when we introduce him he was pacing the terrace, or roof of the palace, with slow dignified steps, but with a troubled expression of countenance.  His chief adviser, Sidi Omar, the Minister of Marine, and one of the most unscrupulous and cunning men in the nest, walked beside him.  They were attended and followed by a young but nearly full-grown lion.  It was a common thing for the Deys and his chief officers to keep lion-pups as pets, but as a rule these were chained up on becoming too large to be safe playthings.  Achmet, however, being of a bold, reckless nature, seemed to enjoy the occasional symptoms of alarm betrayed by his attendants at sight of his overgrown pup, and kept it by him until, as we have said, it was nearly full-grown.  He appeared to have no idea of personal danger.  Possibly he did not believe the huge playful brute to be capable of mischief.  Perhaps he felt confident in the keen edge of his Damascene scimitar, and in the power of his arm to lop off even leonine heads.  Whatever may have been the truth on this point, his ease and indifference were evidently not shared by Sidi Omar.  That sly individual was a strong-bodied, middle-aged Turk of commanding presence but sinister countenance, which latter was damaged by the loss of an eye and a sabre-cut across the nose.  \"I have been asked,\" said Omar, continuing a conversation which had already lasted some time, \"to beg that your highness will grant an audience to the Spanish consul; he claims as countrywomen the two ladies who have been just brought in by Sidi Hassan, but I advise that you should refuse him.\"  \"Why so?\" asked Achmet.  \"Because, although there is, I believe, some ground for his claim, the investigation of the question will only occasion useless trouble, as he is unable to prove his case.\"  \"Nay, then, your last reason seems to me in favour of granting an audience,\" returned the Dey, \"for if his plea be insufficient I shall thus appear to be desirous of furthering justice without suffering loss. It is always wise to act with urbanity when it costs one nothing.\"  Achmet smiled, and a gleam of mischievous fun twinkled in his eyes as he observed his minister cast a furtive glance, suggestive of anything but urbanity, at the lion, which had playfully brushed its tail against his leg in passing.  \"Your highness's judgment is always just,\" returned Sidi Omar; \"and were we desirous of maintaining peace with Spain at present, it would be right to propitiate their consul; but, as you are aware, the treaties which we have recently formed with various nations are not to our advantage.  The peace recently forced upon us by America has stopped suddenly the annual flow of a very considerable amount of tribute, (see Note 1), and the constant efforts made by that nation of ill-favoured dogs, the British, to bring about peace between us and Portugal will, I fear, soon dry up another source of revenue, if things go on as they have been doing of late, it is plain to me that we shall soon be at peace with all the world, and be under the necessity of turning our hands to farming or some such work for a livelihood!\"  \"Fear not, Sidi Omar,\" replied the Dey, with a short laugh, \"this fair and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],["title","The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#4)"],["body"," city has lived too long by war to be capable of condescending now to arts of peace.  We shall have no difficulty in picking a quarrel with any nation that seems most desirable when our coffers begin to grow empty--in regard to which, let us be thankful, they show no signs at present.  But have a care, Omar, how you speak disrespectfully of the British.  They are apt, like their representative at your heels, to spring when you least expect it, and they have powerful claws and teeth.  Besides, they are my very good friends, and some of their statesmen have a great regard for me.  Being at war, as you know, with some of the most powerful European nations just now, they know that I do them good service in the Mediterranean by rendering trade difficult and hazardous to all except those with whom I am at peace. Spain being on friendly terms with us at present, I will receive the Spanish consul.  Go, let him know my pleasure, and see that thou hast my scrivano instilled with all requisite information to refute him.\"  Sidi Omar bowed low, and retired without venturing a reply.  At the same time a man of curious aspect stepped from the doorway which conducted from the terrace to the lower parts of the house.  His Eastern costume was almost equal to that of the Dey in magnificence, but there was a tinselly look about the embroidery, and a glassy sheen in the jewels, which, added to the humorous and undignified cast of his countenance, bespoke him one of low degree.  He was the Dey's story-teller, and filled much the same office at the palace that was held by court jesters in the olden time.  The presence of some such individual in Achmet's court, even in the first quarter of the present century, was rendered necessary by the fact that the Dey himself had risen from the ranks, and was an illiterate man.  Advancing towards his master with a freedom that no other domestic of the palace would have dared to assume, he, with affected solemnity, demanded an audience.  \"I cannot refuse it, Hadji Baba, seeing that thou dost swagger into my presence unbidden,\" said Achmet, with a smile, as he sat down in the usual oriental fashion--cross-legged on a low couch--and patted the head of the noble animal which he had chosen as his companion, and which appeared to regard him with the affection of a dog--  \"What may be your news?\"  \"I have no news,\" replied Baba, with humility.  \"News cannot be conveyed to one who knows all things, by one who is a dog and knows nothing.\"  \"Thou knowest at all events how to look well after that which concerns thyself,\" replied the Dey.  \"What hast thou to say to me?\"  \"That the man with the proboscis, who struts when he walks, and snivels when he speaks, desires a favour of your highness.\"  \"Speak not in riddles,\" returned the Dey sharply.  \"I have no time to waste with thee to-day.  Say thy say and be gone.\"  Hadji Baba, who was indeed thoroughly alive to his own interest, was much too prudent to thwart the humour of his master.  Briefly, though without changing his tone or manner, he informed him that the Spanish consul awaited his pleasure below.  \"Let him wait,\" said the Dey, resuming the pipe which for some minutes he had laid aside, and caressing the lion's head with the other hand.  \"May I venture to say that he seems anxious?\" added the story-teller.  \"How much did he give thee for thus venturing to interrupt me, at the risk of thy head?\" demanded the Dey sternly.  \"Truly,\" replied the jester, with a rueful air, \"not much more than would buy gold thread to sew my head on again, were your highness pleased to honour me by cutting it off.\"  \"Be gone, caitiff,\" said the Dey, with a slight smile.  Baba vanished without further reply.  Meanwhile Sidi Omar left the palace and directed his steps to his own quarters, which stood on the little fortified island in front of Algiers.  This islet, having been connected with the mainland by a pier or neck of masonry about a hundred yards long, formed the insignificant harbour which gave shelter to the navy of small craft owned by the pirates.  At the present day the French have constructed there a magnificent harbour, of which that now referred to is a mere corner in the vicinity of the old light-house.  Although small, the port was well fortified, and as the Minister of Marine descended towards it, his eye glanced with approval over the double and treble tiers of guns which frowned from its seaward battlements.  In passing over the connecting pier, Sidi Omar paused to observe a gang of slaves at work repairing some of the buildings which covered the pier stretching from the mainland to the island.  Although slaves, they were not of the black colour or thick-lipped, flat-nosed aspect which we are apt to associate with the name of slave. They were, indeed, burnt to the deepest brown, and many of them also blistered, by the sun, but they were all \"white men,\" and contemptuously styled, by their Mohammedan task-masters, Christians.  The pier on which they wrought had been constructed long before by thirty thousand such slaves; and the Algerine pirates, for above three centuries previous to that, had expended the lives of hundreds of thousands of them in the building of their fortifications and other public works; in the cultivation of their fields and gardens, and in the labours of their domestic drudgery.  Some of the slaves thus observed by the Minister of Marine had been sailors and merchants and mechanics, military and naval officers, clerks, scholars, and other gentlefolks from Italy, Portugal, America, and all the lands which chanced to be \"at war\" with his highness the Dey.  Formerly there had been hosts of English, French, Spanish, etcetera, but their governments having bowed their heads, opened their purses, and sent consuls to the piratical city, they were now graciously exempted from thraldom.  It was hardish work for men accustomed to cooler climates to be obliged, in the sunshine of an African summer, to harness themselves to carts like oxen, and lift huge stones and hods of mortar with little more than a ragged shirt and trousers to cover them from the furnace-heat of day or the dews of night.  Men who carry umbrellas and wear puggeries now-a-days on the Boulevard de la Republique of Algiers have but a faint conception of what some of their forefathers endured down at the \"Marina\" not much more than fifty years ago, and of what they themselves could endure, perhaps, if fairly tried! It must not be supposed, however, that all the slaves stood the trial equally well.  Some were old, others were young; some were feeble, others strong; all were more or less worn--some terribly so.  Yonder old man carrying the block of stone which might tax the energies of a stout youth, and to whom a taskmaster has just administered a cut with the driving-whip, looks like one who has seen better days.  Even in his ragged shirt, broken-brimmed straw hat, and naked feet, he looks like a gentleman.  So he is; and there is a gentle lady and a stout son, and two sweet daughters, in Naples, who are toiling almost as hard as he does--if hours be allowed to count for pains--in order to make up his ransom.  The strong bull-necked man that follows him with a hod of mortar is an unmistakable seaman of one of the Mediterranean ports.  He is a desperate character, and in other lands might be dangerous; but he is safe enough here, for the bastinado is a terrible instrument of torture, and the man is now not only desperate in wrath, but is sometimes desperately frightened.  His driver takes a fiendish pleasure in giving him an extra cut of the whip, just to make him apparently a willing horse, whether he will or not.  The poor youth beside him is a very different character.  His training has been more gentle, and his constitution less robust, for he has broken down under the cruel toil, and is evidently in the last stages of consumption.  The taskmaster does not now interfere with him as he was wont to do when he first arrived. He knows that the day is not far distant when neither the bastinado nor any other species of torture will have power to force work out of him. He also knows that overdriving will only shorten the days of his usefulness; he therefore wisely lets him stagger by unmolested, with his light load.  But why go on enumerating the sorrows of these slaves?  Sidi Omar looked at them with a careless glance, until he suddenly caught sight of something that caused his eyes to flash and his brows to contract.  A sbirro, or officer of justice, stood near him, whether by chance or otherwise we know not.  Touching the sbirro on the shoulder, he pointed to a group under the shade of an archway, and said in a low tone--  \"Go, fetch hither that scoundrel Blindi.\"  The sbirro at once stepped towards the group, which consisted of two persons.  One was an old, apparently dying, slave; the other was a strong middle-aged man, in a quaint blue gown, who knelt by his side, and poured something from a flask into his mouth.  The sbirro seized this man rudely by the neck, and said--  \"Get up, Blindi, and come along with me.\"  Laying the head of the old man gently on the ground, and rising with some wrath, Blindi demanded, in English so broken that we find difficulty in mending it sufficiently to be presented to the reader--  \"Wot for you means by dat?\"  \"Speak your mother tongue, you dog, and make haste, for the Minister of Marine wants you.\"  \"Oh! mos' awfrul,\" exclaimed Blindi, turning pale, and drawing his blue garment hastily round him, as he meekly followed the officer of justice--whose chief office, by the way, was to administer injustice.  The man whom we have styled Blindi was a somewhat peculiar character. He was an Algerine by birth, but had served several years in the British navy, and had acquired a smattering of the English language--forecastle English, as a matter of course.  In consequence of this, and of having lost an eye in the service, he had obtained a pension, and the"]]]
