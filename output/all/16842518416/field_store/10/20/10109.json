Which one she loved the better until the moment at which the story opens she could not have told.  Nobody knew anything about Fanny Glen. At least there were only two facts concerning her in possession of the general public. These, however, were sufficient. One was that she was good. The men in the hospital called her an angel. The other was that she was beautiful. The women of the city could not exactly see why the men thought so, which was confirmation strong as proofs of Holy Writ!  She had come to Charleston at the outbreak of the war accompanied by an elderly woman of unexceptional manner and appearance who called herself Miss Lucy Glen, and described herself as Miss Fanny Glen's aunt. They had taken a house in the fashionable quarter of the city--they were not poor at any rate--and had installed themselves therein with their slaves.  They made no attempt to enter into the social life of the town and only became prominent when Charleston began to feel acutely the hardships of the war which it had done more to promote than any other place in the land.  Then Fanny Glen showed her quality. A vast hospital was established, and the young women of the city volunteered their services.  The corps of nurses was in a state of constant fluxion. Individuals came and went. Some of them married patients, some of them died with them, but Fanny Glen neither married nor died--she abided!  Not merely because she stayed while others did not, but perhaps on account of her innate capacity, as well as her tactful tenderness, she became the chief of the women attached to the hospital. Many a sick soldier lived to love her. Many another, more sorely stricken, died blessing her.  In Charleston she was regarded as next in importance to the general who commanded the troops and who, with his ships, his forts, his guns, and his men, had been for two years fighting off the tremendous assaults that were hurled upon the city from the Union ironclads and ships far out to sea. It was a point of honor to take, or to hold, Charleston, and the Confederates held it till 1865!  Fanny Glen was a privileged character, therefore, and could go anywhere and do anything, within the lines.  Under other circumstances there would have been a thorough inquiry by the careful inhabitants of the proud, strict Southern city into her family relationships; but the war was a great leveller, people were taken at their real value when trouble demonstrated it, and few questions were asked. Those that were asked about Fanny Glen were not answered. It made little difference, then.  Toward the close of 1863, however, there was an eclipse in the general hospital, for Fanny Glen fell ill.  She was not completely recovered, early in 1864, when she had the famous interview with Rhett Sempland, but there was not the slightest evidence of invalidism about her as she confronted him that afternoon in February.  Wounded pride, outraged dignity, burning indignation, supplied strength and spirit enough for a regiment of convalescents.  The difference between the two culminated in a disturbance which might aptly be called cyclonic, for Sempland on nearly the first occasion that he had been permitted to leave the hospital had repaired to Fanny Glen's house and there had repeated, standing erect and looking down upon her bended head, what he had said so often with his eyes and once at least with his lips, from his bed in the ward: that he loved her and wanted her for his wife.  Pleasant thing it was for her to hear, too, she could not but admit.  Yet if Fanny Glen had not rejected him, neither had she accepted him.  She had pleaded for time, she had hesitated, and would have been lost, had Sempland been as wise as he was brave. Perhaps he wasn't quite master of himself on account of his experience in war, and his lack of it in women, for he instantly conceived that her hesitation was due to some other cause than maidenly incertitude, and that Harry Lacy, of whom he had grown mightily jealous, was at the bottom of it.  He hated and envied Lacy. More, he despised him for his weaknesses and their consequences. The two had been great friends once, but a year or two before the outbreak of the war they had drifted apart.  Sempland did not envy Lacy any talents that he might possess, for he was quite confident that the only thing he himself lacked had been opportunity--Fate had not been kind to him, but the war was not yet over. Consequently when he jumped to the conclusion that Fanny Glen preferred Lacy, he fell into further error, and made the frightful mistake of depreciating his rival.  Assuming with masculine inconsistency that the half acceptance she had given him entitled him to decide her future, he actually referred to Lacy's well-known habits and bade her have nothing to do with him.     CHAPTER II  SHE HATES THEM BOTH   \"You are,\" he said at last, \"a lonely, unprotected young girl. Where you come from or what you have been doesn't matter to me. I know what you are. And that is why I love you. You have no father or brother to advise you. I must do it and I will, much as it pains me. If you won't take my affection, you must my counsel,\"--he called it counsel, but only an expert could have distinguished it from command--\"you do not know this man Lacy. He is a dissolute, abandoned--\"  \"Stop!\" cried the girl. \"To me he is always a gentleman--a hero.\"  \"The man is brave enough, I'll admit. And he has done some fine things.\"  \"Yes, while other men have escaped dangers by being made prisoners.\"  By that unkind remark she lost a large part of her advantage.  \"As you say,\" he returned, wincing under her cruel thrust, but persistent, \"but we are not discussing me now, but Lacy.\"  \"Speaking of wickedness, you would better discuss yourself, I think, than him.\"  \"I will not be put off in this way, Miss Fan--\"  \"Miss Glen, please,\" she interrupted, but he paid no attention.  \"Lacy is well enough as a soldier. There is much to commend in him. He has the manner of a gentleman when he wishes to exhibit it, but nevertheless he is not a fit person to be entrusted with the future of a lovely, pure, innocent young girl like you.\"  \"Shame! Shame!\" cried the girl.  \"You may cry 'shame' upon me,\" he went on calmly, \"and I realize, of course, that I am censurable in speaking thus of my rival.\"  \"You flatter yourself.\"  \"How is that?\"  \"You are no rival of Major Lacy's.\"  \"No? Well, then, as a friend.\"  \"Of his?\"  \"Of yours.\"  \"Nor are you a friend of mine.\"  \"Well, then, as an enemy, a fool, anything! I want to tell you that nothing but unhappiness awaits you if you encourage him. I know him, I tell you. I know what sort of a man he is. Unstable as water, fickle, dissipated--\"  \"I'll hear no more!\" cried the girl, passionately, turning her head and attempting to leave the room.  \"Excuse me,\" said the man, coolly, preventing her by occupying the doorway. \"You shall hear me! And hear this first of all. I am not saying anything about Major Lacy which is not a matter of public knowledge and which I have not said to him directly, and which I would not repeat in his presence.\"  \"You tell me that--\"  \"You do not believe me?\"  \"No.\"  \"I beg to assure you, Miss Glen, upon my word of honor--and it has not been questioned heretofore--that I told him these very things not longer than half an hour ago. And I informed him that I intended to tell you.\"  \"What did he say?\" she asked, her curiosity getting the better of her for the moment.  \"He laughed. Said that the South had a present and pressing need for such as I,\" he replied with sturdy honesty, \"but that he would take great pleasure in killing me when the war was over if we were both spared.\"  \"Well, sir, was not that a fine reply?\"  \"It was. It was a gentleman's answer. I admired him for it and told him so. At the same time I told him that he must cease his attentions to you.\"  \"By what right did you dare--\" cried the girl, almost choking with sudden and indignant protest.  \"No right. Unless my love for you, with a desire to serve you, greater than everything save my devotion to that flag yonder, can excuse me.\"  \"And that cannot. Unless love be returned, it entails no rights whatsoever.\"  \"And you do not love me?\"  \"Love you!\" cried the girl, scornfully.  \"I know you don't, but won't you?\" he pleaded.  \"I won't!\"  \"Won't you try?\"  \"No!\"  \"You do not dislike me?\"  \"I hate you!\"  \"Do you love Lacy?\"  \"I will not allow you to question me!\"  \"You must answer me!\" said the man, taking her almost savagely by the arm, and in spite of herself she thrilled at his touch.  \"You hurt me,\" said the girl.  \"Nonsense! You hurt me more than I do you. Do you love this man?\"  \"Why not? He has his failings, his weaknesses, but he fights against them, he tries to overcome them. The whole South knows him, loves him for his deeds, pities him for his failings. And I--\"  \"Yes? You what?\"  \"You shall see. Meanwhile before you depreciate a brother soldier, why don't you do something yourself? You are not in the same class.\"  \"I wouldn't say that, Miss Glen, if I were you,\" exclaimed Major Lacy, quietly entering the room through one of the long windows opening on the veranda. \"Ah, Sempland, have you told your little tale?\"  [Illustration: \"'Ah, Sempland, have you told your little tale?'\"]  \"Yes.\"  \"Exposed me to this young lady?\"  \"I have.\"  \"And condemned me as an utter scoundrel, a blackguard?\"  \"Not quite. I told the truth,\" returned Sempland, calmly, \"just as I said to you I would, and for that I am ready to answer in any way to please you. We can settle the matter when the war is over.\"  \"Very well. What did you say, Miss Glen?\" continued Lacy, turning to that young woman.  \"I told him it wasn't true!\" burst out the girl, impetuously.  \"Ah, but it is,\" said Lacy, softly. \"I am all that he says, and more, too.\"  \"But look at what you have done.\"  \"But little, after all. I heard you reproaching Sempland for what he had not done"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21681"],["title","A Little Traitor to the South (#2)"],["body","I came in. That isn't fair. No braver man lives than Rhett Sempland. Why, did it not take courage to defy me, to tell me to my face that I was a scoundrel, a blackguard? And it took more courage to defy custom, convention, propriety, to come here and tell you the same things. No, Miss Glen, Sempland only lacks opportunity. Fortune has not been kind to him. In that settlement after the war there will be a struggle I'll warrant you.\"  \"See! He can speak nobly of you,\" cried Fanny Glen, turning reproachfully to Sempland.  \"I never said he was not a gentleman, could not be a gentleman, that is, when he was--when he wished to be one, that is, as well as a brave man. He has good blood in him, but that doesn't alter the case. He isn't a fit match for you, or for any woman. I am not speaking for myself. I know my case is hopeless--\"  \"Gad!\" laughed Lacy, \"you have tried then and lost? It's my turn then. Miss Glen, you have heard the worst of me this afternoon. I have been a drunkard, a scoundrel. I have fallen low, very low. But sometimes I am a gentleman. Perhaps in your presence I might always be. I can't tell. I'm not sure. Will you take me for your lover, and in good time your husband, under such circumstances? Faith, I'm afraid it'll not be for better, but for worse.\"  Sempland said nothing. He would not interfere now. Fanny Glen must answer for herself. He clenched his teeth and strove to control himself. In spite of his efforts, however, the blood flamed into his dark face. Fanny Glen grew very white, her blue eyes shone like stars in the pallor of her face under her fair hair. She hesitated. She looked from one to the other. She could not speak. She was too conscious of that stern iron figure. Yet she would have given worlds to say \"yes\" to Lacy's plea.  \"Choose, Miss Glen,\" said Lacy, at last. It was hard for him to wait for anything. \"You stand between us, you see. I warn you if you do not take me, you will take Sempland. Look at him,--\" he smiled satirically,--\"he always gets what he wants. He is the very incarnation of bulldog tenacity and resolution. If I don't get you, he certainly will.\"  \"How dare you comment upon me?\" cried Sempland.  \"Patience, my good sir,\" said the other, coolly. \"You commented upon me in my absence. I comment upon you in your presence. The advantage is mine. As I said, Miss Glen, it is a choice between us. Do not choose me, if you should be so fatuously inclined, because I happen to have had some chances for distinction, for I assure you, on my honor, all there is left of it, that if Sempland gets half a chance he'll do better than I. Choose because you love him--or me.\"  The girl stared from one to the other in indignant bewilderment. Lacy was an ideal lover. Sempland looked like a stern master, and she hated a master. She made a half step toward the handsomer and weaker man, and a half turn toward the homelier and stronger. In her heart of hearts she found in that moment which she preferred. And, as love is wayward, in the knowledge came a surprise for her--and it brought shame. Lacy was handsome and gallant and distinguished, in spite of all, but Sempland was strong--a man indeed.  \"Oh!\" she cried, looking at him, \"if you only had done something great or--\"  \"What!\" he cried, his face alight.  But she turned instantly away. In her words Lacy, more subtile and more used to women, read her preference and his rejection. But he smiled bravely and kindly at her in spite of his knowledge.  \"Major Lacy,\" she said, giving him her hand, \"I esteem you, I honor you, I respect you. I do not believe what this--what has been said about you. But I do not love you.\" She drew away from him. \"You were mistaken. There is no choice between you, for I love neither of you. I do not love anybody. I hate you both!\" she flashed out inconsistently. \"Now go! I don't want to see either of you again.\"  She buried her face in her hands and burst into tears.  \"I will do something to deserve your praise,\" said Sempland, in his deep voice, turning away.  \"Miss Glen,\" said Lacy, most graciously,--Fanny Glen's presence seemed to call all that was good in him to the surface,--\"no one has respected me, or trusted me, or honored me as you have, for years. Sempland cannot rob me of that, even though he should win you. Good-by, and, if it be not grotesque from me, may God bless you!\"     CHAPTER III  A STRIFE IN MAGNANIMITY   \"Well, Sempland,\" said Lacy, with astonishing courtesy and forbearance under all the circumstances, as he overtook the other man plodding along the shaded street, \"you don't seem to be in much greater favor with the young lady than I.\"  \"Lacy,\" returned the other, \"you did well this evening. You are not good enough for Miss Glen, I still think. Nobody is, for that matter, but you less than others. My opinion of you, you know--\"  \"Faith, all the world may know it apparently!\"  \"That's unjust. I have never mentioned it to any one, and should not have expressed it to Miss Glen had it not been to save her. But you showed the stuff that was in you, that used to be in you, to-night. It was fine. I thank you for having said--\" he paused.  \"What?\" asked Lacy.  \"Why, that about my not having had a chance, you know.\"  \"Oh, that was a trifle.\"  \"I know. But not many men would have said it at the time.\"  \"I tell you what it is, Sempland. I like you, I always have liked you. When I--er--dropped out of the old set, you know, before the war, I didn't mind giving up any one so much as you. And I was sorry for you to-night. You hadn't had a chance. God knows I love the girl, but I am not the man for her. I would break her heart in a month. You don't know women, I take it, but I think she will be yours in the end. I give her to you.\"  \"She is not yours to give.\"  \"No, I know she isn't. But I withdraw in your favor.\"  \"I don't want that sort of a fair field. Harry,\" went on the other man, unconsciously dropping into the familiar form of boyhood, which caused Lacy's face to flush with pleasure, \"I am sure she loves you. I thought it was I, at first, but since this afternoon I have changed my mind. Why can't you be different? You are not a fit man to marry any honest woman now, and when I thought of your record I doubted that you ever would be. I was sure you would not, but--see here, old man! Throw the past aside! A fellow that's got it in him to do what you have done for the South--why can't you control yourself? Turn over a new leaf. I love her, too. She's more to me than life itself, but her happiness is more than mine. If she loves you, and wants you, make yourself worthy of her. By heaven, I'll help you, if it kills me! You thought I was harsh to-day. I swear to you if you succeed nobody will acknowledge it quicker than I!\"  \"Will you tell her so?\"  \"I will!\"  \"Rhett,\" said the other man, stretching out his hand, \"the woman I love has this day honored me, but by heaven I believe you have honored me more. I did think it was a low-down trick for you to go to Miss Glen, but I know why you did it, and you were right. It's too late. I can never be anything different. My father and grandfather both died in drunken sprees--it's in my blood. I can't help it. I've had a chance or two to do something a little out of the ordinary in this war, thank God for it, but I suppose the reason I was able to carry it through was that I cared little whether I lived or died. No, that isn't true. I'd rather die than live, but I would like to go out of existence doing something fine and noble. I--I--might get a better chance on the other side, then, you know. Life is nothing to me, and there are no possibilities in it.\"  He spoke bitterly. It was rare that any one saw him in that mood.  \"I tell you I'm cursed! I wouldn't take that girl if she did accept me. I only wanted to trouble you. Well, no, not exactly that, either. I love her, God knows, but the devil's got me in his grip and--\"  \"I can't understand it,\" said Sempland, vaguely.  \"Of course you can't. You're so strong and so self-contained--such as you never can understand such as I. But to be a drunkard, and a gambler, and a--\"  He stopped and threw up his hands, and then dropped them heavily by his side.  \"It's in my blood, I tell you! It is not all my fault. Yet there is good in me, enough good to make me go mad if I stop to think of it. I want some way to get out of this life with honor. I leave the field for you.\"  \"She doesn't love--\"  \"You're a fool, Sempland--forgive me--about that woman. I know women better than you. Not so much the good as the bad, but in some things women are alike, a woman is a woman whatever she does. That girl loves the ground you walk on.\"  \"Nonsense! It's you.\"  \"Pshaw! She is fascinated by what she's heard on one hand, and she shuts her eyes to what she has heard on the other. The war is young. We'll be beaten, of course, but not without some hard, desperate fighting. Your chance will come, and when it does--\"  \"I will master it or die!\"  \"Of course, but don't die. Master it. Leave dying to me. I've sought ways for it, and now one is at hand.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"I am going to take out the _David_ to-night.\"  \"What!\"  \"Yes. It's a dead secret, but I can tell you. There are three blockade-runners ready to sail. The _Wabash_ lies off the Main Ship Channel. Of course, all the others are blockaded, too, but General Beauregard thinks that if we can torpedo the flagship the others will hurry to her assistance and the blockade-runners can get out through the Swash Channel. Our magazines are running low, and we must have arms, powder, everything. There are two or three shiploads at Nassau. This is an attempt to get to them. If we can blow up Admiral Vernon's flagship, perhaps we can raise the blockade. At any rate it's the only chance for the blockade-runners to get out.\"  \"Did the general order you to do this?\"  \"Certainly not. I suggested it to him. They don't order any one to the _David_, you know.\"  \"I should say not,\" returned Sempland. \"She's"]]]
