Two days ago he investigated my razor,--it is now equal to a cross-cut saw; and as to my drawers and papers, excepting those which I lock up, there is but one word which fully describes the result of his investigations, and that is--chaos.\"  There was, in truth, some ground for that father's emotions, for Master Robin displayed investigative, not to say destructive, capacities far in advance of his years.  \"Never mind, George,\" said Mrs Wright soothingly, \"we must put up with his little ways as best we may, consoling ourselves with the reflection that Robin has genius and perseverance, with which qualities he is sure to make his way in the world.\"  \"He has at all events made his way up the telegraph-post,\" said Mr Wright, his smile expanding and the grimness of it departing; \"see! the rascal is actually stretching out his hand to grasp one of the wires. Ha! hallo!\"  The composed wife became suddenly discomposed, and gave vent to a scream, for at that moment the small black object which they had been watching with so much interest was seen to fall backward, make a wild grasp at nothing with both hands, and fall promptly to the ground.  His father threw up the window, leaped out, dashed across the four-feet-wide lawn, cleared the winding rivulet, and cut, like a hunted hare, over the smiling landscape towards the telegraph-post, at the foot of which he picked up his unconscious though not much injured son.  \"What made you climb the post, Robin?\" asked his cousin Madge that evening as she nursed the adventurous boy on her knee--and Madge was a very motherly nurse, although a full year younger than Robin.  \"I kimed it to see if I could hear the 'trissity,\" replied the injured one.  \"The lek-trissity,\" said Madge, correcting.  \"You must learn to p'onounce your words popperly, dear.  You'll never be a great man if you are so careless.\"  \"I don't want to be a g'eat man,\" retorted Robin.  \"I on'y want t'understand things whats puzzlesum.\"  \"Well, does the telegraph puzzle you?\"  \"Oh! mos' awfully,\" returned Robin, with a solemn gaze of his earnest eyes, one of which was rendered fantastic by a yellow-green ring round it and a swelling underneath.  \"I's kite sure I's stood for hours beside dat post listin' to it hummin' an hummin' like our olianarp--\"  \"Now, Robin, _do_ be careful.  You know mamma calls it an olian _harp_.\"  \"Yes, well, like our olian _h_arp, only a deal louder, an' far nicer. An' I's often said to myself, Is that the 'trissity--?\"  \"Lek, Robin, lek!\"  \"Well, yes, _lek_-trissity.  So I thought I'd kime up an' see, for, you know, papa says the 'trissity--lek, I mean--runs along the wires--\"  \"But papa also says,\" interrupted Madge, \"that the sounds you want to know about are made by the vi--the vi--\"  \"Bratin',\" suggested the invalid.  \"Yes, vibratin' of the wires.\"  \"I wonder what vi-bratin' means,\" murmured Robin, turning his lustrous though damaged eyes meditatively on the landscape.  \"Don'no for sure,\" said Madge, \"but I think it means tremblin'.\"  It will be seen from the above conversation that Robert Wright and his precocious cousin Marjory were of a decidedly philosophical turn of mind.    CHAPTER FOUR.  EXTRAORDINARY RESULT OF AN ATTEMPT AT AMATEUR CABLE-LAYING.  Time continued to roll additional years off his reel, and rolled out Robin and Madge in length and breadth, though we cannot say much for thickness.  Time also developed their minds, and Robin gradually began to understand a little more of the nature of that subtle fluid--if we may venture so to call it--under the influence of which he had been born.  \"Come, Madge,\" he said one day, throwing on his cap, \"let us go and play at cables.\"  Madge, ever ready to play at anything, put on her sun-bonnet and followed her ambitious leader.  \"Is it to be land-telegraphs to-day, or submarine cables?\" inquired Madge, with as much gravity and earnestness as if the world's welfare depended on the decision.  \"Cables, of course,\" answered Robin, \"why, Madge, I have done with land-telegraphs now.  There's nothing more to learn about them.  Cousin Sam has put me up to everything, you know.  Besides, there's no mystery about land-lines.  Why, you've only got to stick up a lot o' posts with insulators screwed to 'em, fix wires to the insulators, clap on an electric battery and a telegraph instrument, and fire away.\"  \"Robin, what _are_ insulators?\" asked Madge, with a puzzled look.  \"Madge,\" replied Robin, with a self-satisfied expression on his pert face, \"this is the three-hundred-thousandth time I have explained that to you.\"  \"Explain it the three-hundred-thousand-and-first time, then, dear Robin, and perhaps I'll take it in.\"  \"Well,\" began Robin, with a hypocritical sigh of despair, \"you must know that everything in nature is more or less a conductor of electricity, but some things conduct it so well--such as copper and iron--that they are called _conductors_, and some things--such as glass and earthenware--conduct it so _very_ badly that they scarcely conduct it at all, and are called _non-conductors_.  D'ee see?\"  \"Oh yes, I see, Robin; so does a bat, but he doesn't see well.  However, go on.\"  \"Well, if I were to run my wire through the posts that support it, my electricity would escape down these posts into the earth, especially if the posts were wet with rain, for water is a good conductor, and Mister Electricity has an irresistible desire to bolt into the earth, like a mole.\"  \"Naughty fellow!\" murmured Madge.  \"But,\" continued Robin impressively, \"if I fix little lumps of glass with a hole in them to the posts, and fix my wires to these, Electricity cannot bolt, because the glass lumps are non-conductors, and won't let him pass.\"  \"How good of them!\" said Madge.  \"Yes, isn't it?  So, you see,\" continued Robin, \"the glass lumps are insulators, for they cut the electricity off from the earth as an island is, or, at all events, appears to be, cut off from it by water; and Mister Electricity _must_ go along the wires and do what I tell him.  Of course, you know, I must make my electricity first in a battery, which, as I have often and often told you, is a trough containing a mixture of acid and water, with plates or slices of zinc and copper in it, placed one after the other, but not touching each other.  Now, if I fix a piece of wire to my first copper slice or plate, and the other end of it to my last zinc slice or plate, immediately electricity will begin to be made, and will fly from the copper to the zinc, and so round and round until the plates are worn out or the wire broken.  D'ee see?\"  \"No, Robin, I don't see; I'm blinder than the blindest mole.\"  \"Oh, Madge, what a wonderful mind you must have!\" said Robin, laughing. \"It is _so_ simple.\"  \"Of course,\" said Madge, \"I understand what you mean by troughs and plates and all that, but what I want to know is _why_ that arrangement is necessary.  Why would it not do just as well to tempt electricity out of its hiding-hole with plates or slices of cheese and bread, placed one after the other in a trough filled with a mixture of glue and melted butter?\"  \"What stuff you do talk, Madge!  As well might you ask why it would not do to make a plum-pudding out of nutmegs and coal-tar.  There are some things that no fellow can understand, and of course I don't know _everything_!\"  The astounding modesty of this latter remark seemed to have furnished Madge with food for reflection, for she did not reply to it.  After a few minutes' walk the amateur electricians reached the scene of their intended game--a sequestered dell in a plantation, through which brawled a rather turbulent stream.  At one part, where a willow overhung the water, there was a deep broad pool.  The stream entered the pool with a headlong plunge, and issued from it with a riotous upheaval of wavelets and foam among jagged rocks, as if rejoicing in, and rather boastful about, the previous leap.  The game was extremely simple.  The pool was to be the German Ocean, and a piece of stout cord was to serve as a submarine cable.  The boy and girl were well-matched playmates, for Madge was ignorant and receptive--in reference to science,--Robin learned and communicative, while both were intensely earnest.  \"Now, this is the battery,\" said Robin, when he had dug a deep hole close to the pool with a spade brought for the purpose.  \"Yes, and the muddy water in it will do for the mixture of acid and water,\" said Madge.  As she spoke, Robin's toe caught on a root, and he went headlong into the battery, out of which he emerged scarcely recognisable.  It was a severe, though not an electric, shock, and at first Robin seemed inclined to whimper, but his manhood triumphed, and he burst into a compound laugh and yell, to the intense relief of Madge, who thought at first that he had been seriously injured.  \"Never mind, Madge,\" said Robin, as he cleansed his muddy head; \"cousin Sam has often told me that nothing great was ever done except in the face of difficulties and dangers.  I wonder whether this should be counted a difficulty or a danger?\"  \"At first I thought it a danger,\" said Madge, with a laugh, \"but the trouble you now have with the mud in your hair looks like a difficulty, doesn't it?\"  \"Why, then, it's both,\" cried Robin.  \"Come, that's a good beginning. Now, Madge, you get away round to the opposite side of the pool, and mind you don't slip in, it's rather steep there.\"  \"This is England,\" cried Robin, preparing to throw the line over to his assistant, who stood eager to aid on the other side, \"and you are standing on--on--"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21716"],["title","The Battery and the Boiler: Adventures in Laying of Submarine Electric Cables (#3)"],["body","what's on the other side of the German Ocean?\"  \"I'm not sure, Robin.  Holland, I think, or Denmark.\"  \"Well, we'll say Denmark.  Look-out now, and be ready to catch.  I'm going to connect England and Denmark with a submarine cable.\"  \"Stay!\" cried Madge, \"is that the way submarine cables are laid, by throwing them over the sea?\"  \"N-no, not exactly.  They had a steamboat, you know, to carry over the telegraph from England to France; but we haven't got a steamer--not even a plank to make-believe one.  Cousin Sam says that a good workman can do his work with almost any tools that come to hand.  As we have no tools at all, we will improve on that and go to work without them.  Now, catch!\"  Robin made a splendid heave--so splendid indeed that it caused him to stagger backward, and again he stumbled into his own _battery_!  This time, however, only one leg was immersed.  \"Another danger!\" shouted Madge in great glee, \"but I've caught the cable.\"  \"All right.  Now make fast the shore-end to a bush, and we'll commence telegraphing.  The first must be a message from the Queen to the King of Denmark--Or is it the President?\"  \"King, I think, Robin, but I'm not sure.\"  \"Well, it won't matter.  But--I say--\"  \"What's wrong now?\"  \"Why, the cable won't sink.  It is floating about on the top of the pool, and it can't be a submarine cable, you know, unless it sinks.\"  \"Another difficulty, Robin.\"  \"We will face and overcome it, Madge.  Cast off the shore-end and I'll soon settle that.\"  Having fastened a number of small stones to the cable, this persevering electrician would certainly have overcome the difficulty if the line had not, when thrown, unfortunately caught on a branch of the willow, where it hung suspended just out of Madge's reach.  \"How provoking!\" she said, stretching out her hand to the utmost.  \"Take care--you'll--ha!\"  The warning came too late.  The edge of the bank gave way, and Madge went headlong into the pool with a wild shriek and a fearful plunge.  Robin stood rooted to the spot--heart, breath, blood, brain, paralysed for the moment--gazing at the spot where his playmate had disappeared.  Another moment and her head and hands appeared.  She struggled bravely for life, while the circling current carried her quickly to the lower end of the pool.  Robin's energies returned, as he afterwards said, like an electric shock, but accompanied with a terrible sinking of the heart, for he knew that he could not swim!  His education in this important particular had been neglected.  He sprang round to the lower end of the pool just in time to hold out his hand to the drowning girl.  He almost touched her outstretched hand as she swept towards the turbulent waters below, but failed to grasp it.  For the first time in his life our little hero was called on to face death voluntarily.  Another moment and Madge would have been caught in the boiling stream that rushed towards the fall below.  He was equal to the occasion.  He sprang right upon Madge and caught her in his arms. There was no need to hold on to her.  In the agony of fear the poor child clasped the boy in a deadly embrace.  They were whirled violently round and hurled against a rock.  Robin caught it with one hand, but it was instantly torn from his grasp.  The waters overwhelmed them, and again sent them violently towards the bank.  This time Robin caught a rock with both hands and held on.  Slowly, while almost choked with the water that splashed up into his face, he worked his right knee into a crevice, then made a wild grasp with the left hand at a higher projection of the rock.  At the same moment his left foot struck the bottom.  Another effort and he was out of danger, but it was several minutes ere he succeeded in dragging Madge from the hissing water of the shallows to the green sward above, and after this was accomplished he found it almost impossible to tear himself from the grasp of the now unconscious girl.  At first poor Robin thought that his companion was dead, but by degrees consciousness returned, and at last she was able to rise and walk.  Drenched, dishevelled, and depressed, these unfortunate electricians returned home.  Of course they were received with mingled joy and reproof.  Of course, also, they were forbidden to go near the pool again--though this prohibition was afterwards removed, and our hero ultimately became a first-rate swimmer and diver.  Thus was frustrated the laying of the first submarine cable between England and Denmark!    CHAPTER FIVE.  PROSPECTS OF REAL CABLE-LAYING--ROBIN MEETS WITH HIS FIRST ELECTRICAL ACQUAINTANCES.  Circumstances require that we should shift the scene and the date pretty frequently in this tale.  We solicit the reader's attendance at an office in London.  The office is dingy.  Many offices are so.  Two clerks are sitting in it making faces at each other across their desk.  They are not lunatics. They are not imbeciles or idlers.  On the contrary, they have frequent spells of work that might throw the toils of an Arab ass into the shade. They are fine strapping young fellows, with pent-up energies equal to anything, but afflicted with occasional periods of having nothing particular to do.  These two have been sitting all morning in busy idleness.  Their muscular and nervous systems rebelling, have induced much fidgeting and many wry faces.  Being original, they have turned their sorrows into a game, and their little game at present is to see which can make a face so hideous that the other shall be compelled to laugh!  We have deep sympathy with clerks.  We have been a clerk, and know what it is to have the fires of Vesuvius raging within, while under the necessity of exhibiting the cool aspect of Spitzbergen without.  But these clerks were not utterly miserable.  On the contrary, they were, to use one of their own familiar phrases, rather jolly than otherwise.  Evening was before them in far-off but attainable perspective.  Home, lawn-tennis, in connection with bright eyes and pretty faces, would compensate for the labours of the day and let off the steam.  They were deep in their game when a rap at the door brought their faces suddenly to a state of nature.  \"Come in,\" said the _first_ clerk.  \"And wipe your feet,\" murmured the second, in a low tone.  A gentleman, with an earnest countenance, entered.  \"Is Mr Lowstoft in his office?\"  \"He is, sir,\" said the first clerk, descending from his perch with an air of good-will, and requesting the visitor's name and business.  The visitor handed his card, on which the name Cyrus Field was written, and the clerk, observing it, admitted the owner at once to the inner sanctum where Mr Lowstoft transacted business.  \"There's _something_ up,\" murmured the clerk, with a mysterious look at his comrade, on resuming his perch.  \"Time's up, or nearly so,\" replied the comrade, with an anxious look at the clock:    \"The witching hour which sets us free   To saunter home and have our tea--  \"approaches.\"  \"D'you know that that is Cyrus Field?\" said the first clerk.  \"And who is Cyrus Field?\" demanded the second clerk.  \"O ignoramus!  Thy name is Bob, and thou art not worth a `bob'-- miserable snob!  Don't you know that Cyrus Field is the man who brought about the laying of the great Atlantic Cable in 1858?\"  \"No, most learned Fred, I did not know that, but I am very glad to know it now.  Moreover, I know nothing whatever about cables--Atlantic or otherwise.  I am as blind as a bat, as ignorant as a bigot, as empty as a soap-bubble, and as wise as Solomon, because I'm willing to be taught.\"  \"What a delicious subject to work upon!\" said Fred.  \"Well then, work away,\" returned Bob; \"suppose you give _me_ a discourse on Cables.  But, I say--be merciful.  Don't overdo it, Frederick. Remember that my capacity is feeble.\"  \"I'll be careful, Bob.--Well then, you must know that from the year 1840 submarine cables had been tried and laid, and worked with more or less success, in various parts of the world.  Sir W. O'Shaughnessy, I believe, began it.  Irishmen are frequently at the root of mischief! Anyhow, he, being Superintendent of Electric Telegraphs in India in 1839, hauled an insulated wire across the Hooghly at Calcutta, and produced what they call `electrical phenomena' at the other side of the river.  In 1840 Mr Wheatstone brought before the House of Commons the project of a cable from Dover to Calais.  In 1842 Professor Morse of America laid a cable in New York harbour, and another across the canal at Washington.  He also suggested the possibility of laying a cable across the Atlantic Ocean.  In 1846 Colonel Colt, of revolver notoriety, and Mr Robinson, laid a wire from New York to Brooklyn, and from Long Island to Correy Island.  In 1849--\"  \"I say, Fred,\" interrupted Bob, with an anxious look, \"you are a walking dictionary of dates.  Haydn was nothing to you.  But--couldn't you give it me without dates?  I've got no head for dates; never could stomach them--except when fresh off the palm-tree.  Don't you think that a lecture without dates would be pleasantly original as well as instructive?\"  \"No, Bob, I don't, and I won't be guilty of any such gross innovation on time-honoured custom.  You must swallow my dates whether you like them or not.  In 1849, I say, a Mr Walker--\"  \"Any relation to Hookey?\"  \"No, sir, none whatever--he laid a wire from Folkestone to a steamer two miles off the shore, and sent messages to it.  At last, in 1851.  Mr Brett laid down and successfully wrought the cable between Dover and Calais which had been suggested by Wheatstone eleven years before.  It is true it did not work long, but this may be said to have been the beginning of submarine telegraphy, which, you see, like your own education, Bob, has been a thing of slow growth.\"  \"Have you done with dates, now, my learned friend?\" asked Bob, attempting to balance a ruler on the point of his nose.  \"Not quite, my ignorant chum, but nearly.  That same year--1851, remember--a Mr"]]]
