Thus, you see, we have been in the position of having to receive these renegade immigrants. Shut out from all the good land and decent climate of Venus, they began coming here.  \"But we did not want them, and of late we have been holding them off, cutting the quota allowed very materially. Last week, as you also know, in Triple Conference, our three races decided to allow at each Inferior Conjunction of the Earth and Venus, so small a quota that the Central State protested vigorously.  \"The controversy has been hot; but the Central State--trying to foist off its undesirables on us--knows it is in the wrong. And fundamentally, it is friendly to us--I think it has proven that in the last two hours.\"  Again I would have spoken, but he went on at once.  \"I know you're familiar with most of this, Jac. But you news-gatherers sometimes reason in too lurid a fashion. Let me go on. Mars was drawn into the affair. To extricate ourselves, we offered to admit--under temporary guard--all Venus immigrants who would pass on at once--at the first astronomical opportunity--to Mars. This would have been very nice for us--but not for Mars.\"  \"They are hot-headed, in Mars,\" Georg commented.  \"Quite so,\" said the doctor. \"But very direct and forceful, nevertheless. They met our suggestion with a law excluding Venus immigrants entirely. It was this, I think, that precipitated tonight's events--though of course they must have been brewing for a long time.\"  \"This Tarrano--\" I began.  \"I heard of him when I was in Venus,\" said Dr. Brende. \"He was at that time a lower official in the Cold Country. Evidently he has risen in his world.  \"I come now to conjecture--but I think it must be fairly close to truth. Tarrano, leading the Cold Country, has risen to open rebellion. His attack upon the Central State must have come suddenly--\"  \"You mean, just this evening?\" Elza asked.  \"No, of course not. But hoping to quell the rebellion, the Central State has suppressed news of it. At such a time--with this controversy going on--such reports would only injure the Central State's inter-planetary position. That's obvious, isn't it? Then tonight, when things were desperate, the Central State gave out its call. Tarrano has conquered Venus, I'm sure. And at the last, before destroying its helio, the Central State tried to warn us.\"  \"Of what?\" I demanded. \"And what about these murders?\"  \"Done by emissaries of Tarrano, no doubt. For revenge, because of the Martian and Earth legislation--or for--\"  \"I think we should not speculate too much,\" said Georg. \"At least, not on that line. They warned you personally, father. We were so careful to keep everything secret--\"  Dr. Brende mopped his forehead. He was trying to appear calm--I knew he did not want unduly to alarm Elza; but I could see that he was laboring under great emotion nevertheless.  \"Things get out, Georg,\" he said. \"We have been careful--yes. But two years ago, when I visited the Central State, I told them there what I hoped to accomplish. There were no grave inter-planetary problems then--I thought I had no need of great secrecy. And since then, though, we have been very careful--\"  Careful! With a Venus girl from the Cold Country living in their household! Truly, humans are a strange mixture of sagacity and folly!  \"The Central State has heard something concerning you,\" Georg said. \"That could easily happen--prisoners captured from Tarrano's forces, for instance. With dispatches--or perhaps some intercepted aerial message.\"  What was this secret they were discussing? I was the only one in the room who did not know it. And why had Dr. Brende sent for me tonight?  I asked him both questions. His face went even more solemn than it had been before.  \"I sent for you, Jac, because in a measure I anticipated what has now befallen. Danger specifically to us Brendes, I mean. We count you as our friend--\"  How it warmed my heart to hear him say that; and to see the glance that Elza cast me!  \"--Our friend. I am an old man--you are young. Yet you are wise, too. We need you tonight.\"  He raised his hand when I would have told him how glad I was to be with them.  \"You know something of my work,\" he said, as a statement, rather than a question. \"I should say, mine and Georg's and Elza's, for they have both helped me materially.\"  I knew that Dr. Brende had for years been one of the Earth's most eminent research physicians. It was he who discovered the light vibrations which had banished forever the dread germs of several of the major diseases. He did not practice; his work was research only.  He went on: \"Jac, I have found what for years I have been striving to find--a vibration of light, though it is invisible--which so far as I can determine, kills every bacillus harmful to man. There is nothing new in the idea--I have been working at it all my life. Sunlight! Altered and modified in several particulars, yet sunlight nevertheless. How strange that for countless centuries, man never realized the blessed boon of sunlight--the greatest enemy of all disease!  \"Each year, as you know, I have conquered some of what we call the major diseases. A few of them--cancer[5], for instance--persisted in eluding me. Its bacilli--you can easily recognize the tiny purplish, horned rods which cause what we popularly call cancer--just would not die. No form of light or other vibration I could devise, seemed to hurt them--unless I used a vibration harmful, even fatal, to the blood-contents itself: I killed the cancer--in the words of you news-gatherers--but I also killed the patient.\"  [Footnote 5: A medical word, translated here as _cancer_, though possibly not that.]  His eyes smiled at the jest, but his face remained intensely serious.  \"Then, Jac, I solved that problem--just a few months ago. And upon the heels of it I solved another, of infinitely more importance.\" He paused slightly. \"I have learned how to kill, or at least arrest, the bacillus of old age. It is a bacillus, you know. We grow old because every day we live beyond the age of thirty--the bacillus of old age is attacking us. I call them the Brende-bacilli--these tiny, frayed discs that make us grow old. I have seen them--and killed them!\"  It dawned on me slowly, the import of what he was saying.  \"You mean----\"  \"He means,\" said Georg, \"that at present we cannot only banish disease--all disease--but we can keep your body from aging. Not permanently, doubtless--but with the span of life lengthened threefold at least. Only by violence now need you die prematurely.\"  This then was the secret the existence of which Tarrano had learned. He had....  But Dr. Brende was quietly voicing my thoughts.  \"It seems obvious, Jac, that this Tarrano at least suspects that I have made some such discovery as this. That he would withhold it from mankind, for the benefit of his own race, seems also obvious. That he is about to make an attempt to get it from me, I am convinced.\"  I remembered the wording of the message of warning from the Central State. _\"Your Dr. Brende, in Eurasia.\"_ I mentioned it.  \"Our main laboratory is there,\" Georg said. \"In Northern Siberia--isolated from people so far as possible, and in a climate advantageous for the work.\"  Elza spoke for the first time in many minutes.  \"We have guards there, Jac--eight of our assistants.... Father, I called Robins a while ago. He said everything was all right. But don't you think we should call him again?\"  The doctor had drifted into deep thought. \"What? Oh, yes, Elza. I was thinking we should go there. My notes--descriptions of how to build a larger apparatus--larger than the small model I have installed there--my notes are all there, and I want them. And I don't think, at such a time, I should trust Robins to bring them.\"  \"What shall I send to Headquarters?\" Georg asked. \"They wanted an answer, you remember.\"  \"I'm going there to the Potomac--tell them that. Tell them we will come there for safety. But first I must get my notes, and the model.\"  As Georg went to the door, something in his attitude made us all start to our feet and follow him. No alarm from the insulator had come, yet for myself I had not forgotten that Venus girl outside.  Georg was at the door, tense as though to spring forward as soon as he opened it. I was close behind him.  \"What----\"  \"Wait, Jac! Quiet! I just want to see--in case she _is_ doing something.\"  He jerked open the door suddenly and bounded through, with me after him.  The corridor was empty. But there was a whirring coming from the instrument room.  We leaped across the padded corridor. In the instrument room, Ahla the maid sat at the table with a head-piece clasped to her ears. She was talking softly but swiftly into the transmitter. In the mirror beside her I caught a glimpse of the place to which she was talking. A sort of cave--flickering lights--a crowd of dark figures of Venus men, seemingly armed.  She must have heard us coming. A sweep of her white arm dashed the mirror to the floor, smashing it. Then she cast off the head-piece, and leaping to her feet, faced us, blazing and defiant.     CHAPTER IV  _To the North Pole_   \"You stand back! You do not touch me!\"  The Venus girl fairly hissed the words. Her eyes were dilated; her white hair hung in a tumbling, wavy mass over her shoulders. She stood tense--a frail, girlish figure in a short, grey-cloth mantle, with long grey stockings beneath.  We were startled. Georg stopped momentarily; then he jumped at her. It was a false move, for before we could reach her, with a piercing cry, she was tearing at the instruments on the table; her fingers, with burns unheeded, ripping the delicate wires, smashing the small mirrors, flinging everything to the floor.  A few seconds only, but it was enough. She was panting when Georg caught her by the wrists, and we others gathered around them.  \"Ahla!\" Elza cried in horror.  I can appreciate the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21638"],["title","Tarrano the Conqueror (#4)"],["body","to Elza, who had trusted, even loved this girl.  Dr. Brende stood in confused astonishment, staring at the wreck of the instrument table. From a naked wire a little black coil of smoke was coming up. I fumbled about and switched the current out of everything.  We were cut off from all communication with the world. It gave me a queer feeling--made the small island we were on seem so remote.  Georg was shaking the girl, demanding with whom she had been talking and why. But she fell into sullen silence, and nothing we could do would make her break it. It infuriated me, that stubbornness; it was all I could do to keep from harming her in my efforts to make her talk.  Georg, at last, pulled me away; he led the girl to a couch and sternly bade her sit there without moving. She seemed willing enough to do that; she still had not spoken, but her eyes were watching us closely.  Dr. Brende was examining the smashed instruments. \"Ruined. We cannot use them. Those messages--we must send them. I must talk to Robins----\"  We went into the corridor, out of earshot of the girl, but where we could watch her. That we were in immediate danger was obvious, and we all realized it. Ahla had told some of her people that we were here on the island; doubtless was planning to have them come here at once and seize us.  How far away from us were they? I had seen in the mirror the interior of a cave-like room. Where was it? Might it not be near at hand--over on the mainland? Might not these enemies arrive on the island at any moment?  Georg suggested that we send our messages from the aeros. We had my own car--and a larger car of the Brendes. More than ever now, Dr. Brende was worried over the safety of his Siberian laboratory; but from the aero we could talk to Robins.  We went to the landing stage. I wanted to tie up Ahla, but as Georg said, she could do nothing now that the instrument room was out of commission. We admonished her sternly to stay where she was, and left the house.  On the open landing stage my small aero was lying where I had left it; but a moment's glance showed us it was wrecked--its instruments and its driving mechanism demolished!  There was no doubt about it now; Ahla had planned to keep us on the island while her people came and seized us. Fortunately the Brende car was well housed and barred. We saw that the gates had been tampered with, but with the limited time Ahla had to work in, she had been unable to force them. We swung them wide, and to our infinite relief found the car unharmed.  At once Dr. Brende called Robins. But the laboratory did not answer!  \"It may be your sending apparatus,\" I suggested. \"Send your message down to Headquarters--with their high power they'll get Robins quickly enough.\"  He tried that--sending also his answer to the previous coded message Headquarters had sent him. It was now 11:45. We waited some eight minutes, during which time I rushed back to the house. Ahla was sitting obediently where I had left her.  \"You stay there,\" I told her. \"If you move, I'll break every bone in your rotten little body.\"  Back at the landing stage I found Dr. Brende in despair. Headquarters could not raise Robins. They had relayed the message to Wrangel and Spitzbergen Islands--but the stations there reported similarly. Dr. Brende's laboratory did not answer its call.  This decided us. We had no wish to remain where we were. The Brende car, far larger than the small one of mine, was fully equipped and provisioned. We rolled it out, and in a moment were flying in the air.  Dr. Brende's car was large, commodious, and smooth-riding. A pleasure to fly in such a car! Georg was at the controls. I sat close beside Elza in the semi-darkness, gazing down through the pit-rail window to where the island was dropping away beneath us. It was a perfect night; the moon had set; the stars and planets gleamed in an almost cloudless sky. Red Mars, I saw, very nearly over our heads.  It was now midnight, and for the moment we chanced to have the air to ourselves. We rose to the 10,000-foot level, then headed directly North. It carried us inland; soon the sea was out of sight behind. Lights dotted the landscape--a town or city here and there, and occasionally a tower.  Dr. Brende was poring over charts, illumined by a dim glow-light beside him. \"Can we get power all the way, Georg?... Elza child, hadn't you better lie down? A long trip--you'll be tired out.\"  \"Call Royal Mountain[6],\" Georg suggested. \"Ask them about serving us power; I'll stay 10,000 or below. Under one thousand, when we get further north. Ask them if they can guarantee us power all the way.\"  [Footnote 6: Now Montreal.]  The station at Royal Mountain would guarantee us nothing on this night; they advised us to keep low. Their own power-sending station was working as usual. But this night--who could tell what General Orders might come? Everyone's nerves were frayed; this Director demanded gruffly to know who we were.  \"Tell him none of his business,\" I put in. My own nerves were frayed, too.  \"Quiet!\" warned Georg. \"He'll hear you--and it _is_ his business if he wants to make it so. Tell him we are the Inter-Allied News, father. That is true enough, and no use putting into the air that Dr. Brende is flying north.\"  Royal Mountain let us through. We passed well to the east of it about 12:45--too far away to sight its lights. The cross-traffic was somewhat heavier here. Beneath it, at 5,000 and 6,000 feet, a steady stream of cars was passing east and west.  We were riding easily--little wind, almost none--and were doing 390 miles an hour. You cannot bank or turn very well at such a speed; it is injurious to the human body. But our course was straight north. Dr. Brende showed it to me on his chart--north, following the 70th West Meridian. Compass corrections as we got further north--and astronomical readings, these would take us direct to the Pole. I could never fathom this air navigation; I flew by tower lights, and landmarks--but to Dr. Brende and Georg, the mathematics of it were simple.  At two o'clock we had crossed the route of the Chicago-Great London Mail flyer. But we did not see the vessel. The temperature was growing steadily colder. The pit was inclosed, and I switched on the heaters. Elza had fallen asleep on the side couch, with my promise to awaken her at the first sign of dawn.  At two-thirty, the Greater New York-East Indian Express overhauled us and passed overhead. It was flying almost north, bound for Bombay and Ceylon via Novaya Zemlya. It was in the 18,000-foot lane. The air up there was clear, but beneath us a fog obscured the land.  At intervals all this time Dr. Brende had been trying to raise Robins--but there was still no answer. We did not discuss what might be the trouble. Of what use could such talk be?  But it perturbed us, for imagination can picture almost anything. Georg even felt the strain of it, for he said almost gruffly:  \"Stop it, father. I don't think you should call attention to us so much. Get the meteorological reports from the Pole--we need them. If they tell us this weather will hold at 10,000 and below, we'll make good time.\"  Soon after three o'clock we swept over Hudson Strait into Baffinland. We were down to 4,000 feet, but the fog still lay under us like a blanket. It clung low; we were well above it, in a cloudless night, with no wind save the rush of our forward flight.  Then came the pink flush of dawn. True to my promise I awakened Elza. But there was nothing for her to see; the stars growing pale, pink spreading into orange, and then the sun. But the fog under us still lay thick.  We were holding our speed very nearly at 380 an hour. By daylight--about five o'clock, after a light meal--we were over Baffin Bay. I had relieved Georg at the controls. The headlands of North Greenland lay before us. Then the fog lifted a little, broke away in places. The water became visible--drift and slush-ice of the Spring, with lines of open water here and there.  And then the fog closed down again, lifting momentarily at six o'clock when we passed over the north-western tip of Greenland. The tower there gave us its routine signal, which we answered in kind. There was little traffic along here; a few local cars in the lowest lanes.  Shortly after six, when we were above Grantland, another of the great trans-Arctic passenger liners went over us. The San Francisco Night line, for Mid-Eurasia and points South. It was crossing Greenland, from San Francisco, Vancouver, Edmonton, to the North Cape, the Russias, and African points south of Suez.  At seven o'clock, with the sun circling the lower sky, the fog under us suddenly dissipated completely. We were over the Polar ocean. Masses of drift ice and slush, but for the most part surprisingly clear. At eight o'clock, flying low--no more than a thousand feet--we sighted the steel tower with foundations sunk into the ocean's depths which marks the top of our little Earth.  We flashed by the tower in a moment, answering the director's signal perfunctorily. Southward now, on the 110th East Meridian, without deviating from the straight course we had held.  It was truly a beautiful sight, this Polar ocean. Masses of ice, glittering in the morning sunlight. A fog-bank to the left; but everywhere else patches of green water and floes that gleamed like millions of precious stones as they flung back the light to us. Or again, a mass of low, solid ice, flushed pink in the morning light. And behind us, just above the horizon, a segment of purple sky where a storm was gathering--a deep purple which was mirrored in the placid patches of open water, and darkened the ice-floes to a solemn, sombre hue.  Elza was entranced, though she had made many trans-Polar trips. But Georg, now again at the controls, kept his eyes on the instruments; and the doctor, trying vainly once more to talk with his laboratory, now so close ahead of us, sat in moody silence.  It was 9:38 when we sighted, well"]]]
