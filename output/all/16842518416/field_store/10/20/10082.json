Dulcie, at fourteen, seemed years younger than Lilias; she did not wish to grow up too soon, and thankfully tipped all responsibilities on to her elder sister. Cousin Clare always said there were undiscovered depths in Dulcie's character, but they were slow in development, and at present she was a childish little person with a pink baby face, an affection for fairy tales, and even a sneaking weakness for her discarded dolls. Life, that to Lilias seemed a serious business, was a joyous venture to Dulcie; she had a happy knack of shaking off the unpleasant things, and throwing the utmost possible power of enjoyment into the nice ones. If innocent happiness is the birthright of childhood, she clung to it steadfastly, and had not yet exchanged it for the red pottage of worldly wisdom.  Ever since Father and Mother, in the great disaster of the wreck of the _Titanic_, had gone down together into the gray waters of the Atlantic, the Ingleton children had lived with their grandfather, Mr. Leslie Ingleton, at Cheverley Chase. There were six of them, Everard, Lilias, Dulcie, Roland, Bevis, and Clifford, and as time passed on, and the memory of that tragedy in mid-ocean grew faint, the Chase seemed as entirely their home as if they had been born there. In Everard's opinion, at any rate, it belonged to them, as it had always belonged to the prospective heirs of the Ingleton family. And that family could trace back through many centuries to days of civil wars and service for king and country, to crusades and deeds of chivalry, and even to far-away ancestors who gave counsel at Saxon Witenagemots. Norman keep had succeeded wooden manor, and that in its turn had given place to a Tudor dwelling, and both had finally merged into a long Georgian mansion, with straight rows of windows and a classic porch, not so picturesque as the older buildings, but very convenient and comfortable from a modern point of view. The lovely gardens, with their clipped yew hedges, were one of the sights of the neighborhood, and it was a family satisfaction that the view from the terrace over park, wood, and stream showed not a single acre of land that was not their own.  Mr. Leslie Ingleton, a fine type of the old-fashioned, kindly, but autocratic English squire, belonged to a bygone generation, and found it difficult to move with the march of the times. Because he had spent his seventy-four years of life on the soil of Cheverley, the people tolerated in \"the ould squire\" many things that they would not have passed over in a younger man or a stranger. They shrugged their shoulders and gave way to his well-meant tyranny, for man and boy, everybody on the estate had experienced his kindness and realized his good intentions towards his tenants.  \"If he does fly off at a tangent, ten to one Miss Clare'll be down the next day and set all straight again,\" was the general verdict on his frequent outbursts.  Cheverley Chase would have been quite incomplete without Cousin Clare. She was a second cousin of the Ingletons, who had come to tend Grandmother in her last illness, and after her death had remained to take charge of the household and the newly-arrived family of grandchildren. She was one of those calm, quiet, big-souled women who in the early centuries would have been a saint, and in medi√¶val times the abbess of a nunnery, but happening to be born in the nineteenth century, her mental outlook had a modern bias, and both her philanthropy and her religious instincts had developed along the latest lines of thought. She had schemes of her own for work in the world, but at present she was doing the task that was nearest in helping to bring up the motherless children who had been placed temporarily in her care. To manage this rather turbulent crew, soothe the irascible old Squire, and keep the general household in unity was a task that required unusual powers of tact, and a capacity for administration and organization that was worthy of a wider sphere. She might be described as the axle of the family wheel, for she was the unobtrusive center around which everything unconsciously revolved.  But by this time Lilias and Dulcie will have ridden up hill and down dale, and will be turning Rajah and Peri in at the great wrought-iron gates of Cheverley Chase, and trotting through the park, and up the laurel-bordered carriage drive to the house. There was quite a big welcome for them when they arrived. Everard had returned the day before from Harrow, Roland was back from his preparatory school, and the two little ones, Bevis and Clifford, had just said good-by for three weeks to their nursery governess, and in consequence were in the wildest of holiday spirits. There was a general family pilgrimage round the premises to look at all the most cherished treasures, the horses, the pigeons, the pet rabbits, the new puppies, the garden, and the woods beyond the park; there were talks with the grooms and the keepers, and plans for cutting evergreens and decorating both the house and the village church in orthodox Christmas fashion.  \"It's lovely to be at home again,\" sighed Lilias with satisfaction, as the three elder ones sauntered back through the winding paths of the terraced vegetable garden.  \"And such a home, too!\" exulted Dulcie.  \"Rather!\" agreed Everard. \"That was exactly what was in my mind. The first thing I thought when I looked out of the window this morning was: 'What a ripping place it is, and some day it will be all mine.'\"  \"Yours, Everard?\"  \"Why, of course. Who's else should it be? The Chase has always gone strictly in the male line, and I'm the oldest grandson, so naturally I'm the heir. It goes without saying!\"  Dulcie's pink face was looking puzzled.  \"Do you mean to say if Grandfather were to die, that everything would be yours?\" she asked. \"Would you be the Squire?\"  \"I believe I'm called 'the young squire' already,\" replied Everard airily.  \"But what about the rest of us?\" objected Dulcie.  \"Oh, I'd look after you, of course! The heir always does something for the younger ones. You needn't be afraid on that score!\"  Everard's tone was magnanimous and patronizing in the extreme. He was gazing at the house with an air of evident proprietorship. Dulcie, who had never considered the question before, revolved it carefully in her youthful brain for a moment or two; then she ventured a comment.  \"Wouldn't it be fairer to divide it?\"  \"Nonsense, Dulcie!\" put in Lilias. \"You don't understand. Properties like this are never divided. They always go, just as they are, to the eldest son. You couldn't chop them up into pieces, or there'd be no estate left.\"  \"Couldn't one have the house and the other the wood, and another the park?\"  \"Much good the house would do anybody without the estate to keep it up!\" grunted Everard. \"Dulcie, you're an utter baby. I don't believe you ever see farther than the end of your silly little nose. You may be glad you've got a brother to take care of you.\"  \"But haven't I as much right here as you?\" persisted Dulcie obstinately.  \"No, you haven't; the heir always has the best right to everything. Cheer up! When the place is mine, I mean to have a ripping time here! I'll make things hum, I can tell you--ask my friends down, and you girls shall help to entertain. I've planned it all out. I suppose I shall have to go to Cambridge first, but I'll enjoy myself there too--you bet! On the whole I think I was born under a lucky star! Hallo! there goes Astley; I want to speak to him.\"  Everard whistled to the groom, and ran down the garden, leaving his sisters to return to the house. At seventeen he was a fair, handsome, dashing sort of boy, of a type more common thirty years ago than at present. He held closely to the old-fashioned ideas of privileges of birth, and, according to modern notions, had contracted some false ideals of life. He had lounged through school without attempting to work, and was depending for all his future upon what should be left him by the industry of others. All the same, in spite of his attitude of \"top dog\" in the family, he was attractive, and inclined to be generous. Like most boys of seventeen, he had reached the \"swollen head\" stage, and imagined himself of vastly greater importance than he really was. The sobriquet of \"the young squire\" pleased his fancy, and he meant to live up to what he considered were the traditions of so distinguished a title.     CHAPTER II  A Stolen Joy-ride   Christmas passed over at Cheverley Chase in good old-fashioned orthodox mode. The young Ingletons, with plenty of evergreens to work upon, performed prodigies in the way of decorations at church and home. They distributed presents at a Christmas-tree for the children of tenants, and turned up in a body to occupy the front seats at the annual New Year's concert in the village. When the usual festivities were finished, however, time hung a little heavy on their hands, and one particular morning found them lounging about the breakfast-room in the especially aggravating situation of not quite knowing what to do with themselves.  \"It's too bad we can't have the horses to-day!\" groused Dulcie. \"I'd set my heart on a ride, and I can't get on with my fancy work till I can go to Balderton for some more silks.\"  \"And I want some wool,\" proclaimed Lilias, stopping from a rather unnecessary onslaught of poking at the fire. \"There's never anything fit to buy at this wretched little shop in the village!\"  \"Except bacon and kippers!\" grinned Roland.  \"I can't knit with kippers!\"  \"Fact is, we're all bored stiff!\" drawled Everard from the sofa, flinging away the book he was reading, and stretching his arms in the luxury of a long-drawn yawn. \"What should you say to a turn in the car? Wouldn't it be rather sport, don't you think?\"  \"If Grandfather would spare Milner to take us!\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],["title","The Princess of the School (#2)"],["body","doubtfully.  \"We don't want Milner. _I'll_ drive you! I can manage a car as well as he can, any day. Don't get excited, you kids! _No_, Bevis, I shall certainly _not_ allow you to try to drive! There's only going to be one man at that job, and that's myself!\"  \"Shall we go and ask Grandfather?\" suggested Dulcie.  \"Right you are! No, not the whole of us,\" (as there was a general family move). \"Three's enough!\"  So a deputation, consisting of Everard, Lilias, and Dulcie, promptly presented themselves at the study door and tapped for admission. As there was no reply to a second rap, they opened the door and walked into the room. Grandfather was rather deaf, and sometimes, when he had ignored a summons, he would say: \"Well, why didn't you come in?\" He was generally to be found writing letters at this hour in the morning, but to-day the revolving chair was empty. He had apparently begun his usual correspondence, for his desk was littered with papers. Leaning up against the ink-pot there was a photograph. The young people, who had walked across the room towards the window, could not fail to notice it, for it was tilted in such a prominent place that it at once attracted their attention. It represented a very pretty dark-eyed young lady, holding a baby on her lap, with a slight background of Greek columns. The decidedly foreign look about it was justified by the photographer's name in the corner: \"Carlo Salviati, Palermo.\" Over the top was written in ink, in a man's handwriting: \"My wife and Leslie, from Tristram.\"  \"Who is it?\" asked Everard, gazing at the portrait with curiosity. \"She's rather decent looking. Never seen her here, though, that I can remember!\"  \"It's a ducky little baby! But who is Tristram?\" said Dulcie.  \"We had an Uncle Tristram once,\" answered Lilias doubtfully.  \"Why, but he died years and years ago, when we were all kids!\" returned Everard.  \"I know. He was the only Tristram in the family, though. I can't imagine who these two can be. Leslie, too! Why, that's Grandfather's name! Was the baby christened after him?\"  \"We'll ask Cousin Clare sometime,\" said Dulcie, so interested that she could scarcely tear herself away. \"I really want to know most fearfully who they are.\"  \"Oh, don't bother about photos at present! Let's find Grandfather!\" urged Everard. \"Perhaps he's gone down to the stables, or he may be in the gun-room.\"  On further inquiry, however, they ascertained that a telegram had arrived for Mr. Ingleton, on the receipt of which he had consulted Miss Clare, had ordered the smaller car, and they had both been driven away by Milner, the chauffeur, and were not expected back until seven or eight o'clock in the evening. This was news indeed. For a whole day the heads of the establishment would be absent, and the younger generation had the place to themselves. For the next eight hours they could do practically as they pleased.  Everard stood for a moment thinking. He did not reveal quite all that passed through his mind, but the first instalment was sufficient for the family.  \"We'll get out the touring car, take some lunch with us, and have a joy-ride.\"  Five delighted faces smiled their appreciation.  \"Oh, Everard! Dare we?\" Dulcie's objection was consciously faint.  \"Why not? When Grandfather's away, I consider I've a right to take his place and use the car if I want. I'm master here in his absence! I'll make it all right with him; don't you girls alarm yourselves! Tear off and put on your coats, and tell Atkins to pack us a basket of lunch, and to put some coffee in the thermos flasks.\"  With Everard willing to assume the full responsibility the girls could not resist such a tempting offer, while the younger boys were, of course, only too ready to follow where their elders led. Elton, the groom, made some slight demur when Everard went down to the motor-house and began to get out the big touring-car, but the boy behaved with such assurance that he concluded he must be acting with his grandfather's permission. Moreover, Elton was in charge of the horses, and not the cars, and Milner, the chauffeur, who might reasonably have raised objections, was away driving his master.  The cook, who perhaps considered it was no business of hers to offer remonstrances, and that the house would be quieter without the young folks, hastily packed a picnic hamper and filled the thermos flasks. A rejoicing crew carried them outside and stowed them in the car.  It seemed a delightful adventure to go off in this way entirely on their own. There was some slight wrangling over seats, but Everard settled it in his lofty fashion.  \"You'll sit where I tell you. I'll have Lilias in front, and the rest of you may pack in behind. If you don't like it, you can stop at home. No, I'm not going to have you kids interfering here, so you needn't think it.\"  Everard had been taught by the chauffeur to drive, and could manage a car quite tolerably well. He possessed any amount of confidence, which is a good or bad quality according to circumstances. He ran the large touring \"Daimler\" successfully through the park, and turned her out at the great iron gateway on to the highroad. Everybody was in the keenest spirits. It was a lovely day, wonderfully mild for January, and the sunshine was so pleasant that they hardly needed the thick fur rugs. There seemed a hint of spring in the air; already hazel catkins hung here and there in the hedgerows, thrushes and robins were singing cheerily, and wayside cottages were covered with the blossom of the yellow jessamine. It was a joy to spin along the good smooth highroad in the luxurious car. Everard was a quick driver, and kept a pace which sometimes exceeded the speed limit. Fortunately his brothers and sisters were not nervous, or they might have held their breath as he dashed round corners without sounding his horn, pelted down hills, and on several occasions narrowly avoided colliding with farm carts. A reckless boy of seventeen, without much previous experience, does not make the most careful of motorists. As a matter of fact it was the first time Master Everard had driven without the chauffeur at his elbow, and, though he got on very well, his performance was not unattended with risks.  Towards one o'clock the crew at the back began to clamor for lunch, and to suggest a halt when some suitable spot should be reached. The difficulty was to find a place, for they were driving so fast that by the time the younger boys had called out the possibilities of some wood or small quarry, the car had flown past, and, sooner than turn back, Everard would say: \"Oh, we'll stop somewhere else!\"  By unanimous urging, however, he was at last persuaded to halt at a picturesque little bridge in a sheltered hollow, where they had the benefit of the sunshine and escaped the wind. A small brook wandered below between green banks where autumn brambles still showed brown leaves, and actually a shriveled blackberry or two remained. There was a patch of grass by the roadside, and here Everard put the car, to be out of reach of passing traffic, while its occupants spread the rugs on the low wall of the bridge, and began to unpack their picnic baskets. Cook had certainly done her best for them: there were ham sandwiches and pieces of cold pie, and jam turnovers, and slices of cake, and some apples and oranges, and plenty of hot coffee in the thermos flasks.  \"It's ever so much nicer to have one's meals out-of-doors, even in January!\" declared Bevis, munching a damson tartlet, and dropping stones into the brook below. \"I believe it's warm enough to wade. That water doesn't look cold, somehow!\"  \"No, you don't!\" said Lilias briskly. \"You needn't think, just because Miss Mason isn't here, you can do all the mad things you like. It's no use beginning to unlace your boots, for I shan't let you wade, or Clifford either! The idea! In January!\"  \"Why not?\" sulked Bevis. \"I didn't ask _you_, Lilias. Everard won't say no!\"  \"You can please yourselves,\" answered his eldest brother, \"but _I'm_ going to take the car on now. If you stay and wade, you'll have to walk home, that's all! I certainly shan't came back for you.\"  At so awful a threat the youngsters, who had really meant business where the water was concerned, hurriedly relaced their boots, and ran to take their places in the car; the girls finished packing the remains of the picnic in the basket, and followed, and soon the engine was started again, and they were once more flying along the road.  Everard had brought out the family for a joy-ride without any very particular idea of where they were going, though he was steering generally in the direction of the Cleland Hills. To his mind the chief fun of the expedition lay in simply taking any road that looked interesting, without regard to sign-posts. The others trusted implicitly to his powers of path-finding, and had really not the slightest idea in what part of the country they were traveling. After quite a long time, however, it occurred to Lilias to ask where they were, and how long it would take them to get home again.  \"We've come such a roundabout route, I scarcely know,\" replied Everard. \"Those are the Cleland Hills in front of us, though, and if we bowl straight ahead, and go over them, we shall get to Clacton Bridge; then we can get the straight highroad back to Cheverley.\"  \"We shan't be home before it's dark, though?\"  \"Well, no! But the head lights are working all right--I tried them before we started.\"  \"It will be fun to drive in the dark!\" chuckled the boys behind.  \"I hope we shall be back before Grandfather and Cousin Clare, though,\" said Dulcie a little uneasily.  The road over the Cleland Hills was much wilder than they expected, and it was very stony and bad. Up and up they went till walls, hedges and farms had disappeared, and only the lonely moor lay on either side of the rough track. It was a place where no motorist in his senses would have ventured to take a car, the extreme roughness"]]]
