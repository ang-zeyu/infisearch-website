Her parents decided to settle in St. Petersburg, the capital of the Almighty Tsar, and there to embark in business.  It was here that a great change took place in the life of the young dreamer.  It was an eventful period--the year of 1882--in which Emma Goldman, then in her 13th year, arrived in St. Petersburg.  A struggle for life and death between the autocracy and the Russian intellectuals swept the country.  Alexander II had fallen the previous year. Sophia Perovskaia, Zheliabov, Grinevitzky, Rissakov, Kibalchitch, Michailov, the heroic executors of the death sentence upon the tyrant, had then entered the Walhalla of immortality.  Jessie Helfman, the only regicide whose life the government had reluctantly spared because of pregnancy, followed the unnumbered Russian martyrs to the etapes of Siberia.  It was the most heroic period in the great battle of emancipation, a battle for freedom such as the world had never witnessed before.  The names of the Nihilist martyrs were on all lips, and thousands were enthusiastic to follow their example. The whole INTELLIGENZIA of Russia was filled with the ILLEGAL spirit: revolutionary sentiments penetrated into every home, from mansion to hovel, impregnating the military, the CHINOVNIKS, factory workers, and peasants.  The atmosphere pierced the very casemates of the royal palace.  New ideas germinated in the youth.  The difference of sex was forgotten.  Shoulder to shoulder fought the men and the women.  The Russian woman!  Who shall ever do justice or adequately portray her heroism and self-sacrifice, her loyalty and devotion? Holy, Turgeniev calls her in his great prose poem, ON THE THRESHOLD.  It was inevitable that the young dreamer from Konigsberg should be drawn into the maelstrom.  To remain outside of the circle of free ideas meant a life of vegetation, of death.  One need not wonder at the youthful age.  Young enthusiasts were not then--and, fortunately, are not now--a rare phenomenon in Russia.  The study of the Russian language soon brought young Emma Goldman in touch with revolutionary students and new ideas.  The place of Marlitt was taken by Nekrassov and Tchernishevsky.  The quondam admirer of the good Queen Louise became a glowing enthusiast of liberty, resolving, like thousands of others, to devote her life to the emancipation of the people.  The struggle of generations now took place in the Goldman family. The parents could not comprehend what interest their daughter could find in the new ideas, which they themselves considered fantastic utopias.  They strove to persuade the young girl out of these chimeras, and daily repetition of soul-racking disputes was the result.  Only in one member of the family did the young idealist find understanding--in her elder sister, Helene, with whom she later emigrated to America, and whose love and sympathy have never failed her.  Even in the darkest hours of later persecution Emma Goldman always found a haven of refuge in the home of this loyal sister.  Emma Goldman finally resolved to achieve her independence.  She saw hundreds of men and women sacrificing brilliant careers to go V NAROD, to the people.  She followed their example.  She became a factory worker; at first employed as a corset maker, and later in the manufacture of gloves.  She was now 17 years of age and proud to earn her own living.  Had she remained in Russia, she would have probably sooner or later shared the fate of thousands buried in the snows of Siberia.  But a new chapter of life was to begin for her.  Sister Helene decided to emigrate to America, where another sister had already made her home.  Emma prevailed upon Helene to be allowed to join her, and together they departed for America, filled with the joyous hope of a great, free land, the glorious Republic.   America!  What magic word.  The yearning of the enslaved, the promised land of the oppressed, the goal of all longing for progress. Here man's ideals had found their fulfillment: no Tsar, no Cossack, no CHINOVNIK.  The Republic!  Glorious synonym of equality, freedom, brotherhood.  Thus thought the two girls as they travelled, in the year 1886, from New York to Rochester.  Soon, all too soon, disillusionment awaited them.  The ideal conception of America was punctured already at Castle Garden, and soon burst like a soap bubble.  Here Emma Goldman witnessed sights which reminded her of the terrible scenes of her childhood in Kurland.  The brutality and humiliation the future citizens of the great Republic were subjected to on board ship, were repeated at Castle Garden by the officials of the democracy in a more savage and aggravating manner.  And what bitter disappointment followed as the young idealist began to familiarize herself with the conditions in the new land!  Instead of one Tsar, she found scores of them; the Cossack was replaced by the policeman with the heavy club, and instead of the Russian CHINOVNIK there was the far more inhuman slave-driver of the factory.  Emma Goldman soon obtained work in the clothing establishment of the Garson Co.  The wages amounted to two and a half dollars a week.  At that time the factories were not provided with motor power, and the poor sewing girls had to drive the wheels by foot, from early morning till late at night.  A terribly exhausting toil it was, without a ray of light, the drudgery of the long day passed in complete silence--the Russian custom of friendly conversation at work was not permissible in the free country.  But the exploitation of the girls was not only economic; the poor wage workers were looked upon by their foremen and bosses as sexual commodities.  If a girl resented the advances of her \"superiors\", she would speedily find herself on the street as an undesirable element in the factory.  There was never a lack of willing victims: the supply always exceeded the demand.  The horrible conditions were made still more unbearable by the fearful dreariness of life in the small American city.  The Puritan spirit suppresses the slightest manifestation of joy; a deadly dullness beclouds the soul; no intellectual inspiration, no thought exchange between congenial spirits is possible.  Emma Goldman almost suffocated in this atmosphere.  She, above all others, longed for ideal surroundings, for friendship and understanding, for the companionship of kindred minds.  Mentally she still lived in Russia. Unfamiliar with the language and life of the country, she dwelt more in the past than in the present.  It was at this period that she met a young man who spoke Russian.  With great joy the acquaintance was cultivated.  At last a person with whom she could converse, one who could help her bridge the dullness of the narrow existence.  The friendship gradually ripened and finally culminated in marriage.  Emma Goldman, too, had to walk the sorrowful road of married life; she, too, had to learn from bitter experience that legal statutes signify dependence and self-effacement, especially for the woman. The marriage was no liberation from the Puritan dreariness of American life; indeed, it was rather aggravated by the loss of self-ownership.  The characters of the young people differed too widely.  A separation soon followed, and Emma Goldman went to New Haven, Conn.  There she found employment in a factory, and her husband disappeared from her horizon.  Two decades later she was fated to be unexpectedly reminded of him by the Federal authorities.  The revolutionists who were active in the Russian movement of the 80's were but little familiar with the social ideas then agitating Western Europe and America.  Their sole activity consisted in educating the people, their final goal the destruction of the autocracy.  Socialism and Anarchism were terms hardly known even by name.  Emma Goldman, too, was entirely unfamiliar with the significance of those ideals.  She arrived in America, as four years previously in Russia, at a period of great social and political unrest.  The working people were in revolt against the terrible labor conditions; the eight-hour movement of the Knights of Labor was at its height, and throughout the country echoed the din of sanguine strife between strikers and police.  The struggle culminated in the great strike against the Harvester Company of Chicago, the massacre of the strikers, and the judicial murder of the labor leaders, which followed upon the historic Haymarket bomb explosion.  The Anarchists stood the martyr test of blood baptism.  The apologists of capitalism vainly seek to justify the killing of Parsons, Spies, Lingg, Fischer, and Engel. Since the publication of Governor Altgeld's reason for his liberation of the three incarcerated Haymarket Anarchists, no doubt is left that a fivefold legal murder had been committed in Chicago, in 1887.  Very few have grasped the significance of the Chicago martyrdom; least of all the ruling classes.  By the destruction of a number of labor leaders they thought to stem the tide of a world-inspiring idea.  They failed to consider that from the blood of the martyrs grows the new seed, and that the frightful injustice will win new converts to the Cause.  The two most prominent representatives of the Anarchist idea in America, Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman--the one a native American, the other a Russian--have been converted, like numerous others, to the ideas of Anarchism by the judicial murder.  Two women who had not known each other before, and who had received a widely different education, were through that murder united in one idea.  Like most working men and women of America, Emma Goldman followed the Chicago trial with great anxiety and excitement.  She, too, could not believe that the leaders of the proletariat would be killed.  The 11th of November, 1887, taught her differently.  She realized that no mercy could be expected from the ruling class, that between the Tsarism of Russia and the plutocracy of America there was no difference save in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],["title","Anarchism and Other Essays (#2)"],["body","me.  Her whole being rebelled against the crime, and she vowed to herself a solemn vow to join the ranks of the revolutionary proletariat and to devote all her energy and strength to their emancipation from wage slavery.  With the glowing enthusiasm so characteristic of her nature, she now began to familiarize herself with the literature of Socialism and Anarchism.  She attended public meetings and became acquainted with socialistically and anarchistically inclined workingmen.  Johanna Greie, the well-known German lecturer, was the first Socialist speaker heard by Emma Goldman.  In New Haven, Conn., where she was employed in a corset factory, she met Anarchists actively participating in the movement. Here she read the FREIHEIT, edited by John Most.  The Haymarket tragedy developed her inherent Anarchist tendencies: the reading of the FREIHEIT made her a conscious Anarchist.  Subsequently she was to learn that the idea of Anarchism found its highest expression through the best intellects of America: theoretically by Josiah Warren, Stephen Pearl Andrews, Lysander Spooner; philosophically by Emerson, Thoreau, and Walt Whitman.  Made ill by the excessive strain of factory work, Emma Goldman returned to Rochester where she remained till August, 1889, at which time she removed to New York, the scene of the most important phase of her life.  She was now twenty years old.  Features pallid with suffering, eyes large and full of compassion, greet one in her pictured likeness of those days.  Her hair is, as customary with Russian student girls, worn short, giving free play to the strong forehead.   It is the heroic epoch of militant Anarchism.  By leaps and bounds the movement had grown in every country.  In spite of the most severe governmental persecution new converts swell the ranks.  The propaganda is almost exclusively of a secret character.  The repressive measures of the government drive the disciples of the new philosophy to conspirative methods.  Thousands of victims fall into the hands of the authorities and languish in prisons.  But nothing can stem the rising tide of enthusiasm, of self-sacrifice and devotion to the Cause.  The efforts of teachers like Peter Kropotkin, Louise Michel, Elisee Reclus, and others, inspire the devotees with ever greater energy.  Disruption is imminent with the Socialists, who have sacrificed the idea of liberty and embraced the State and politics.  The struggle is bitter, the factions irreconcilable.  This struggle is not merely between Anarchists and Socialists; it also finds its echo within the Anarchist groups.  Theoretic differences and personal controversies lead to strife and acrimonious enmities.  The anti-Socialist legislation of Germany and Austria had driven thousands of Socialists and Anarchists across the seas to seek refuge in America.  John Most, having lost his seat in the Reichstag, finally had to flee his native land, and went to London.  There, having advanced toward Anarchism, he entirely withdrew from the Social Democratic Party.  Later, coming to America, he continued the publication of the FREIHEIT in New York, and developed great activity among the German workingmen.  When Emma Goldman arrived in New York in 1889, she experienced little difficulty in associating herself with active Anarchists.  Anarchist meetings were an almost daily occurrence.  The first lecturer she heard on the Anarchist platform was Dr. A. Solotaroff.  Of great importance to her future development was her acquaintance with John Most, who exerted a tremendous influence over the younger elements. His impassioned eloquence, untiring energy, and the persecution he had endured for the Cause, all combined to enthuse the comrades.  It was also at this period that she met Alexander Berkman, whose friendship played an important part throughout her life.  Her talents as a speaker could not long remain in obscurity.  The fire of enthusiasm swept her toward the public platform.  Encouraged by her friends, she began to participate as a German and Yiddish speaker at Anarchist meetings.  Soon followed a brief tour of agitation taking her as far as Cleveland.  With the whole strength and earnestness of her soul she now threw herself into the propaganda of Anarchist ideas.  The passionate period of her life had begun.  Through constantly toiling in sweat shops, the fiery young orator was at the same time very active as an agitator and participated in various labor struggles, notably in the great cloakmakers' strike, in 1889, led by Professor Garsyde and Joseph Barondess.  A year later Emma Goldman was a delegate to an Anarchist conference in New York.  She was elected to the Executive Committee, but later withdrew because of differences of opinion regarding tactical matters.  The ideas of the German-speaking Anarchists had at that time not yet become clarified.  Some still believed in parliamentary methods, the great majority being adherents of strong centralism. These differences of opinion in regard to tactics led in 1891 to a breach with John Most.  Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and other comrades joined the group AUTONOMY, in which Joseph Peukert, Otto Rinke, and Claus Timmermann played an active part.  The bitter controversies which followed this secession terminated only with the death of Most, in 1906.  A great source of inspiration to Emma Goldman proved the Russian revolutionists who were associated in the group ZNAMYA.  Goldenberg, Solotaroff, Zametkin, Miller, Cahan, the poet Edelstadt, Ivan von Schewitsch, husband of Helene von Racowitza and editor of the VOLKSZEITUNG, and numerous other Russian exiles, some of whom are still living, were members of this group.  It was also at this time that Emma Goldman met Robert Reitzel, the German-American Heine, who exerted a great influence on her development.  Through him she became acquainted with the best writers of modern literature, and the friendship thus begun lasted till Reitzel's death, in 1898.   The labor movement of America had not been drowned in the Chicago massacre; the murder of the Anarchists had failed to bring peace to the profit-greedy capitalist.  The struggle for the eight-hour day continued.  In 1892 broke out the great strike in Pittsburg.  The Homestead fight, the defeat of the Pinkertons, the appearance of the militia, the suppression of the strikers, and the complete triumph of the reaction are matters of comparatively recent history.  Stirred to the very depths by the terrible events at the seat of war, Alexander Berkman resolved to sacrifice his life to the Cause and thus give an object lesson to the wage slaves of America of active Anarchist solidarity with labor.  His attack upon Frick, the Gessler of Pittsburg, failed, and the twenty-two-year-old youth was doomed to a living death of twenty-two years in the penitentiary.  The bourgeoisie, which for decades had exalted and eulogized tyrannicide, now was filled with terrible rage.  The capitalist press organized a systematic campaign of calumny and misrepresentation against Anarchists.  The police exerted every effort to involve Emma Goldman in the act of Alexander Berkman.  The feared agitator was to be silenced by all means.  It was only due to the circumstance of her presence in New York that she escaped the clutches of the law.  It was a similar circumstance which, nine years later, during the McKinley incident, was instrumental in preserving her liberty.  It is almost incredible with what amount of stupidity, baseness, and vileness the journalists of the period sought to overwhelm the Anarchist.  One must peruse the newspaper files to realize the enormity of incrimination and slander.  It would be difficult to portray the agony of soul Emma Goldman experienced in those days. The persecutions of the capitalist press were to be borne by an Anarchist with comparative equanimity; but the attacks from one's own ranks were far more painful and unbearable.  The act of Berkman was severely criticized by Most and some of his followers among the German and Jewish Anarchists.  Bitter accusations and recriminations at public meetings and private gatherings followed.  Persecuted on all sides, both because she championed Berkman and his act, and on account of her revolutionary activity, Emma Goldman was harassed even to the extent of inability to secure shelter.  Too proud to seek safety in the denial of her identity, she chose to pass the nights in the public parks rather than expose her friends to danger or vexation by her visits.  The already bitter cup was filled to overflowing by the attempted suicide of a young comrade who had shared living quarters with Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and a mutual artist friend.   Many changes have since taken place.  Alexander Berkman has survived the Pennsylvania Inferno, and is back again in the ranks of the militant Anarchists, his spirit unbroken, his soul full of enthusiasm for the ideals of his youth.  The artist comrade is now among the well-known illustrators of New York.  The suicide candidate left America shortly after his unfortunate attempt to die, and was subsequently arrested and condemned to eight years of hard labor for smuggling Anarchist literature into Germany.  He, too, has withstood the terrors of prison life, and has returned to the revolutionary movement, since earning the well deserved reputation of a talented writer in Germany.   To avoid indefinite camping in the parks Emma Goldman finally was forced to move into a house on Third Street, occupied exclusively by prostitutes.  There, among the outcasts of our good Christian society, she could at least rent a bit of a room, and find rest and work at her sewing machine.  The women of the street showed more refinement of feeling and sincere sympathy than the priests of the Church.  But human endurance had been exhausted by overmuch suffering and privation.  There was a complete physical breakdown, and the renowned agitator was removed to the \"Bohemian Republic\"--a "]]]
