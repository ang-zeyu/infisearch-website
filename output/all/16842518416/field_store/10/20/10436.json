Before the man had time to turn round, Bob's stick fell, with all the boy's strength, upon his ankle; and he went down as if he had been shot, his pistol exploding as he fell. Bob raised his stick again and brought it down, with a swinging blow, on the robber's head.  The others had made a rush, together, towards the man standing by the lady. Taken utterly by surprise, he discharged his pistol at random, and then sprang towards the door. Two blows fell on him, and Sankey and Fullarton tried to grapple with him; but he burst through them, and rushed out.  Bob and Wharton sprang on the kneeling man, before he could gain his feet; and rolled him over, throwing themselves upon him. He was struggling furiously, and would soon have shaken them off, when the other boys sprang to their assistance.  \"You help them, Jim. I will get this cord off!\" Fullarton said and, running to the bed, began to unknot the cord that bound the admiral.  The ruffian on the ground was a very powerful man, and the three boys had the greatest difficulty in holding him down; till Fullarton slipped a noose round one of his ankles and then, jumping on the bed, hauled upon it with all his strength--the admiral giving his assistance.  \"Get off him, he is safe!\" he shouted; but the others had the greatest difficulty in shaking themselves free from the man--who had, fortunately, laid his pistol on the bed, before he crawled under it to get at the box.  Jim Sankey was the first to shake himself free from him and, seeing what Fullarton was doing, he jumped on to the bed and gave him his assistance and, in half a minute, the ruffian's leg was lashed to the bedpost, at a height of five feet from the ground.  Just as this was done there was a rush of feet outside; and three men, one holding a cutlass and the other two armed with pokers, ran into the room. It was fortunate they did so, for the man whom Bob had first felled was just rising to his feet; but he was at once struck down again, by a heavy blow over the head with the cutlass. By this time the admiral had torn off the bandage across his mouth.  \"Another of them ran downstairs, Jackson. Give chase. We can deal with these fellows.\"  The three men rushed off.  \"Well, I don't know who you are,\" the admiral went on, turning to the boys, \"but you turned up at the nick of time; and I am deeply indebted to you, not only for saving my money--although I should not have liked to lose that--but for having captured these pirates.  \"That villain has not hurt you much, I hope?\" for both Bob and Jim Sankey were bleeding freely, from the face, from the heavy blows the robber had dealt them.  \"No, sir, we are not hurt to speak of,\" Bob said. \"We belong to Tulloch's school.\"  \"To the school!\" the admiral exclaimed. \"What on earth are you doing here, at four o'clock in the morning?  \"But never mind that now. What is it, Jackson, has he got away?\"  \"No, sir; he was lying in a heap, at the bottom of the stairs. There was a lanyard fastened across.\"  \"We tied a string across, sir, as we came up,\" Bob explained.  \"Well done, lads!  \"Are there any more of them, Jackson?\"  \"Don't see any signs of any more, admiral. There are the two plate chests in the passage, as if they had been brought out from the butler's strong room, in readiness to take away.\"  \"Where is the butler? He must have heard the pistol shots!\" the admiral exclaimed angrily.  \"He is not in his room, admiral. We looked in to bring him with us. The door was open, but he isn't there.\"  \"There is another man in the drawing room, tied.\" Bob said. \"He was putting a lot of things into a sack.\"  \"The scoundrel! Perhaps that is the butler,\" the admiral said.  \"Well, Emma, you had better go back to bed again.  \"Jackson, you stand guard over these two villains here, and split their heads open, if they venture to move.  \"Now, let us go and see to this other fellow.\"  The admiral proceeded downstairs, followed by the boys. The other two servants were standing beside the third robber, who was still insensible.  \"You keep watch over him, John,\" the admiral said.  \"William, you come with us. There is another man in the drawing room, but he is tied.\"  \"There is the key, sir,\" Bob said, producing it. \"We thought it safest to lock him up.\"  \"Upon my word, young gentlemen, you seem to have thought of everything. If I were in command of a ship, I should like to have you all as midshipmen.\"  The door was opened. The man was still lying on the ground, but had rolled some distance from where they had left him. He had succeeded in getting his feet loosened from the handkerchief, but the whipcord round his wrists had resisted all his efforts to break or slacken it. He was panting heavily from the exertions he had made.  \"It is Harper,\" the admiral said, in a tone of indignation and disgust.  \"So, you treacherous scoundrel, it was you who let these men in, was it? Well, it is a hanging matter, my lad; and if any fellow deserves the rope, you do.  \"You had better go and get some more cord, Williams, and tie all these four fellows up, securely. Let Jackson see to the knots.  \"Where did the scoundrels get in?\" he asked, turning to the boys.  \"At the door at the end of the passage, sir, where the plate chests are standing. We found it open--here is the key of it. We locked it, after we came in, so as to prevent anyone from getting away.  \"There is another man, with a cart, in the road.\"  \"We will see to him, directly we have got the others all tied up safely,\" the admiral said. \"That is the first thing to see to.\"  In five minutes, the four men were laid side by side in the hall, securely bound hand and foot.  \"Now, Williams, you keep guard over them.  \"Jackson, do you and John sally out. There is a cart standing outside the gate, and a fellow in it. Bring him in, and lay him alongside the others.\"  The boys followed the two men, to see the capture. The light had broadened out over the sky, and it was almost sunrise as they sallied out. They went quietly along, until they reached the gate--which stood ajar--then they flung it open and rushed out. To their disappointment, the cart was standing about fifty yards lower down the hill. The man was in it, with his whip in one hand and the reins in another, and was looking back; and the moment he saw them, he struck the horse and drove off at the top of his speed. The pace was such that it was hopeless for them to think of following him.  \"I expect he heard the pistol shots,\" Jackson said, \"and sheered off a bit, so as to be able to cut and run if he found his consorts were in trouble. Well, we cannot help it; we have taken four prizes out of the five, and I call that pretty fair.\"  \"I think we had better go, now,\" Bob said. \"We have got a friend waiting for us.\"  \"Then he must wait a bit longer,\" Jackson said. \"The admiral will want to ask you some more questions. But if your friend is anywhere near, one of you might run and tell him to back and fill a bit, till you come to him.\"  \"Tell him to do what?\" Jim Sankey asked.  \"Tell him to wait a bit, lad.\"  \"I will run up,\" Wharton said.  \"Shall I tell him we shan't want him at all, today, Bob?\"  \"I think so, Wharton. You see it is four o'clock, now; and we mayn't be able to get away for half an hour, and it will be too late, then. Besides, Jim and I have been knocked about too much to care for rabbit hunting, now. You tell him we will go some other day.\"  \"You needn't tell him that, Wharton,\" Fullarton put in. \"It will be some time before we get a chance, you may be sure.\"  \"All right! Tell him to go home then, Wharton. Tell him I will make it all right with him, for losing his morning's work. Of course, you will come in here, when you come down the hill again.\"  Wharton nodded, and started at a run up the hill; while his companions accompanied the two men into the house. The admiral was down in the hall again. He had now had time to add to his former, scanty costume.  \"Get the shutters of the drawing room open, Jackson,\" he said, after hearing the report of the man's escape, \"and tell the maids--I suppose they are all up--to light a fire and get some coffee ready, at once, and something to eat.  \"Now, young gentlemen, sit down and tell me all about this business. Now, which of you will be spokesman?\"  Jim nodded to Bob.  \"It's his doing, sir. I mean about our coming in here. We should never have thought anything about the cart, if it hadn't been for Bob; and we didn't much like coming, only he pretty well made us, and he arranged it all.\"  \"That's all rot,\" Bob said. \"We were just all in it together, sir, and this is how it was.\"  And he told the whole story of what had taken place.  \"Well, you couldn't have done better, if you had been officers in His Majesty's service,\" the admiral said. \"You have saved me the loss of my two plate chests, of all the plate in this room--and that couldn't be counted in money, for they were most of the things given me, at different times, on service--and of 500 pounds I had in that box upstairs--altogether, at least 2000 pounds in money value. More than that, you prevented my being captured; and it would have been a sorer blow, to me, than the loss of the money, if those scoundrels had had their way, and had got off scot free.  \"But you haven't told me, yet, how you happened to be going up the hill, at half past three o'clock in the morning. What on earth were you doing there? Surely your master does not allow you to ramble about, in the middle of the night.\"  \"Well, no, sir, that is the worst of it,\" Bob said. \"You see, I had arranged with one of the fishermen's boys, who has got a first-rate dog, that we could meet him upon the Common, and do some rabbit hunting. We slipped out from Tulloch's, and meant to have been back before anyone was up. And now I expect we shall get it nicely, because I suppose it must all come out.\"  The admiral laughed.  \"You are four nice young scamps!\" he said--for Wharton had rejoined them, before Bob had finished the story-"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21788"],["title","Held Fast For England: A Tale of the Siege of Gibraltar (1779-83) (#4)"],["body","-\"but it is not for me to blame you. It will certainly have to be told, lads, because you will have to appear as witnesses at the trial of these fellows; but I will go down myself, the first thing in the morning, and speak to your master.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" Bob said. \"It won't make any difference about the thrashing; we are bound to get that. But we shan't mind that, we are pretty well accustomed to it. Still, if you speak for us, I expect we shall get off with that; otherwise I don't know what Tulloch would have done, when he found out that we had been slipping out at night.\"  \"I expect it is not the first time you have done it?\"  \"Well, no, it is not, sir. We have been out two or three times, with one of the fishermen, in his boat.\"  \"I expect you are nice young pickles,\" the admiral said. \"Well, what time does school begin?\"  \"Half past seven, sir.\"  \"Very well, then. I will be there at that hour, lads, and do my best for you. You see, with those faces of yours, you would be sure to be noticed, anyhow; and I hope you wouldn't, in any case, have been mean enough to screen yourselves by lying.\"  \"That we shouldn't,\" Bob said. \"I don't think there is a boy in the school who would tell a lie to Tulloch.\"  \"That is right, lads. A gentleman will never tell a lie to screen himself, when he has got into a scrape. I wouldn't keep the smartest young officer in the service on board a ship of mine, if I caught him telling a lie; for I should know that he would not only be a blackguard, but a coward. Cowardice is at the bottom of half the lying of the world. I would overlook anything, except lying. Upon my word, I would rather that a boy were a thief than a liar.  \"Well, here is breakfast. Now sit down and make yourselves at home, while I go up and see how my daughter is, after the fright she has had.\"  Half an hour later, after eating a hearty breakfast, the four boys started for school.    Chapter 2: A Great Change.   It was just striking six when they again climbed over the wall, and descended by the tree. They had had a discussion whether they should wait until the doors were opened, and walk quietly in, or return as they left. They adopted the latter plan, because they thought that, if the matter was reported to Mr. Tulloch, he might proceed to administer punishment before the admiral arrived to give his version of the affair.  The door was still ajar. As they opened it, they gave an exclamation of surprise--for there, sitting on a chair in the passage, was Mr. Purfleet. He smiled unpleasantly.  \"So here you are. You have had a pleasant ramble, no doubt; but I don't quite know what view Mr. Tulloch may take of it.\"  \"It was very good of you to sit up for us, Mr. Purfleet,\" Bob said, quietly; \"but you see, we had left the door open, and could have got in by ourselves. I hope you will not have caught cold, sitting there only in a dressing gown.\"  \"You are an impudent young scamp!\" Mr. Purfleet said, in a rage. \"You will laugh with the other side of your mouth, presently. You and Sankey are nice-looking figures, ain't you, with your faces all cut and swollen?\"  \"We have been a little in the wars,\" Bob replied.  \"I don't want to hear anything about it,\" the usher replied. \"You will have to explain matters to Mr. Tulloch.\"  \"So I suppose, Mr. Purfleet.  \"Well, Jim, we'll go and have a good wash. The bell will be ringing, in half an hour.\"  So saying, Bob went into the lavatory, followed by his companions; while the usher returned upstairs. He was certainly disappointed. Quietly as the boys had dressed, the slight noise they had made in closing the door had woke him. He thought little of it but, just as he was going off to sleep again, he heard the bolts of the door below withdrawn. He at once got up and walked to the other end of the dormitory, and discovered that the four boys were missing.  Chuckling to himself that he should now be able to repay the grudge he owed to Bob, he put on his dressing gown and went downstairs; and had sat there for three hours, momentarily expecting their return. He had certainly felt chilly, but had borne it patiently; comforted by the joyful expectation of the utter dismay that would be felt, by the culprits, when they saw him. The meeting had not passed off at all as he had anticipated, and he could only console himself by thinking that his turn would come when he made his report to Mr. Tulloch.  The four boys did not return to the dormitory but, after they had washed, strolled about in the playground. There was quite a ferment, in the dormitory, when their absence was perceived, and the others noticed the four made-up figures in their place. The operation of dressing was got through with much greater alacrity than usual and, when they went downstairs and saw the four missing boys in the playground, these were at once surrounded by an excited throng. They refused, however, to answer any questions.  \"You will hear it all, in good time,\" Bob said. \"We have been out, and we have been caught. That is all I am going to tell you.\"  At the usual hour the bell rang, and the boys assembled in the schoolroom. The two ushers were in their places. They waited three or four minutes for Mr. Tulloch to appear; then the door opened, and the manservant entered and, walking up to Mr. Moffat, said a word or two. The latter nodded.  \"Lessons will begin at once,\" he said, in a loud voice. \"The first class will come up to me.\"  The boys of this class, who occupied the senior dormitory, at once began their lessons; while Mr. Purfleet took the lower class. The second class, including Bob and his friends, remained in their places. In a quarter of an hour the door opened, and Mr. Tulloch entered, accompanied by Admiral Langton. Mr. Tulloch was looking very serious, while the admiral looked hot and angry.  \"We are going to catch it,\" Bob whispered, to Jim Sankey. \"I knew the admiral wouldn't be able to get us off.\"  \"I wish all the boys to return to their places, Mr. Moffat. I have something to say,\" Mr. Tulloch said, in a loud voice.  When the boys were all seated, he went on:  \"Admiral Langton has been telling me that four of my boys were out and about, soon after three o'clock this morning. The four boys in question will stand up.  \"I do not say that this is the first time that such a serious infraction of the rules of the school has taken place. It has happened before. It may, for aught I know, have happened many times, without my knowledge; but upon the occasions when it has come to my knowledge, the offenders have been most severely punished. They must be punished, now.  \"Admiral Langton has been telling me that the boys in question have behaved with very great courage, and have been the means of saving him from the loss of a large sum of money and plate, and of capturing four burglars.\"  A buzz of surprise passed round the school.  \"That this conduct does them great credit I am fully prepared to admit. Had they been aware that this burglary was about to be committed, and had they broken out of the house in the middle of the night for the purpose of preventing it, I allow that it might have been pleaded as an excuse for their offence; but this was not so. It was an accident, that occurred to them when they were engaged in breaking the rules, and cannot be pleaded as a set-off against punishment.  \"Admiral Langton has pleaded with me, very strongly, for a pardon for them; but I regret that I am unable to comply with his request. The admiral, as a sailor, is well aware that discipline must be maintained; and I am quite sure that, when he was in command of a ship, he would not have permitted his judgment to be biased, by anyone. I have put it to him in that way, and he acknowledges that to be so. The two matters stand distinct. The boys must be punished for this gross breach of the rules. They may be thanked, and applauded, for the courage they have shown, and the valuable service they have rendered to Admiral Langton.  \"I have, however, so far yielded to his entreaties that, while I must administer a severe caning for the gross breach of the rules, I shall abstain from taking any further steps in the matter; and from writing to the boys' parents and guardians, requesting them to remove their sons from the school, at once, as I certainly otherwise would have done. At the same time, I am willing to hear anything that these boys may have to urge, in explanation or defence of their conduct. I have already been informed, by Admiral Langton, that their object, in so breaking out, was to hunt rabbits up on the Common.\"  \"I wish to say, sir,\" Bob said, in a steady voice, \"that it was entirely my doing. I made the arrangements, and persuaded the others to go; and I think it is only right that they should not be punished as severely as I am.\"  \"We were all in it together, sir,\" Jim Sankey broke in. \"I was just as keen on it as Bob was.\"  \"So was I,\" Fullarton and Wharton said, together.  \"Well, lads,\" Admiral Langton said, taking a step forward, and addressing the boys, in general, \"as your master says, discipline is discipline; this is his ship, and he is on his own quarterdeck--but I wish to tell you all that, in my opinion, you have every reason to be proud of your schoolfellows. They behaved with the greatest pluck and gallantry and, were I again in command of a ship, I should be glad to have them serving me. I am only sorry that I cannot persuade Mr. Tulloch to see the matter in the same light as I do.  \"Goodbye, lads!\" and he walked across, and shook hands with the four boys. \"I shall see you again, soon,\" and the admiral turned abruptly, and walked out of the schoolroom.  Mr. Tulloch at once proceeded to carry his sentence into effect, and the four boys received as severe a caning as ever they had had in their lives; and even Bob, case hardened as he was, had as much as he could do to prevent himself from uttering a sound, while it was being inflicted. Lessons were then continued, as usual, until eight o'clock,"]]]
