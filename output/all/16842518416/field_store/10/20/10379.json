Das de word, your priv'leges. Now, look yar.  I don't want you to break your heart before de time, an' fur dat purpus I would remind you dat while dar's life dar's hope. Moreober, you's got no notion what luck you're in.  If a bad massa got hold ob you, he gib you no noo clo'es, he gib you hard, black bread 'stead o' de good grub what you gits yar.  He make you work widout stoppin' all day, and whack you on de sole ob your foots if you dar say one word.  Was you eber whacked on de sole ob your foots?\"  \"No, never,\" replied Foster, amused in spite of himself by the negro's earnest looks and manner.  \"Ho! den you don't know yet what Paradise am.\"  \"Paradise, Peter?  You mean the other place, I suppose.\"  \"No, sar, I mean not'ing ob de sort.  I mean de Paradise what comes arter it's ober, an' you 'gins to git well again.  Hah! but you'll find it out some day.  But, to continoo, you's got eberyt'ing what's comfrable here.  If you on'y sawd de Bagnio slabes at work--I'll take you to see 'em some day--den you'll be content an' pleased wid your lot till de time comes when you escape.\"  \"Escape!  How can I escape, Peter, now that I have given my word of honour not to try?\"  \"Not'ing easier,\" replied the negro calmly, \"you's on'y got to break your word-ob-honour!\"  \"I'm sorry to hear you say that, my friend,\" returned Foster, \"for it shakes my confidence in you.  You must know that an English gentleman _never_ breaks his word--that is, he never _should_ break it--and you may rest assured that I will not break mine.  If your view of such matters is so loose, Peter, what security have I that you won't deceive _me_ and betray _me_ when it is your interest or your whim to do so?\"  \"Security, Massa?  I lub you!  I's fond o' your smood babby face.  Isn't dat security enough?\"  Foster could not help admitting that it was, as long as it lasted!  \"But what,\" he asked, \"what security has Ben-Ahmed that you won't be as false to him as you recommend me to be?\"  \"I lub massa too!\" answered the negro, with a bland smile.  \"What! love a man whom you have described to me as the most obstinate fellow you ever knew?\"  \"Ob course I do,\" returned Peter.  \"W'y not?  A obs'nit man may be as good as anoder man what can be shoved about any way you please.  Ha! you not know yit what it is to hab a _bad_ massa.  Wait a bit; you find it out, p'r'aps, soon enough.  Look yar.\"  He bared his bosom as he spoke, and displayed to his wondering and sympathetic friend a mass of old scars and gashes and healed-up sores.  \"Dis what my last massa do to me, 'cause I not quite as smart as he wish.  De back am wuss.  Oh, if you know'd a bad massa, you'd be thankful to-day for gettin' a good un.  Now, what I say is, nobody never knows what's a-goin' to turn up.  You just keep quiet an' wait.  Some slabes yar hab waited patiently for ten-fifteen year, an' more.  What den?  Sure to 'scape sooner or later.  Many are ransum in a year or two. Oders longer.  Lots ob 'em die, an' 'scape dat way.  Keep up your heart, Geo'ge, whateber you do, and, if you won't break your word-ob-honour, something else'll be sure to turn up.\"  Although the negro's mode of affording comfort and encouragement was not based entirely on sound principles, his cheery and hopeful manner went a long way to lighten the load of care that had been settling down like a dead weight on young Foster's heart, and he returned to his work with a happier spirit than he had possessed since the day he leaped upon the deck of the pirate vessel.  That night he spent under the same roof with his black friend and a number of the other slaves, none of whom, however, were his countrymen, or could speak any language that he understood.  His bed was the tiled floor of an out-house, but there was plenty of straw on it.  He had only one blanket, but the nights as well as days were warm, and his food, although of the simplest kind and chiefly vegetable, was good in quality and sufficient in quantity.  The next day, at the first blush of morning light, he was aroused with the other slaves by Peter the Great, who, he found, was the Moor's overseer of domestics.  He was put to the same work as before, but that day his friend the negro was sent off on a mission that was to detain him several days from home.  Another man took Peter's place, but, as he spoke neither English nor French, no communication passed between the overseer and slave except by signs.  As, however, the particular job on which he had been put was simple, this did not matter.  During the period of Peter's absence the poor youth felt the oppression of his isolated condition keenly.  He sank to a lower condition than before, and when his friend returned, he was surprised to find how much of his happiness depended on the sight of his jovial black face!  \"Now, Geo'ge,\" was the negro's first remark on seeing him, \"you's down in de blues again!\"  \"Well, I confess I have not been very bright in your absence, Peter. Not a soul to speak a word to; nothing but my own thoughts to entertain me; and poor entertainment they have been.  D'you know, Peter, I think I should die if it were not for you.\"  \"Nebber a bit ob it, massa.  You's too cheeky to die soon.  I's noticed, in my 'sperience, dat de young slabes as has got most self-conceit an' imprence is allers hardest to kill.\"  \"I scarce know whether to take that as encouragement or otherwise,\" returned Foster, with the first laugh he had given vent to for a long time.  \"Take it how you please, Geo'ge, as de doctor said to de dyin' man-- won't matter much in de long-run.  But come 'long wid me an' let's hab a talk ober it all.  Let's go to de bower.\"  In the bower the poor middy found some consolation by pouring his sorrows into the great black sympathetic breast of Peter the Great, though it must be confessed that Peter occasionally took a strange way to comfort him.  One of the negro's perplexities lay in the difficulty he had to convince our midshipman of his great good-fortune in having fallen into the hands of a kind master, and having escaped the terrible fate of the many who had cruel tyrants as their owners, who were tortured and beaten when too ill to work, who had bad food to eat and not too much of it, and who were whipped to death sometimes when they rebelled.  Although Foster listened and considered attentively, he failed to appreciate what his friend sought to impress, and continued in a state of almost overwhelming depression because of the simple fact that he was a slave--a bought and sold slave!  \"Now, look yar, Geo'ge,\" said the negro, remonstratively, \"you _is_ a slabe; das a fact, an' no application ob fut rule or compasses, or the mul'plication table, or any oder table, kin change dat.  Dere you am--a slabe!  But you ain't a 'bused slabe, a whacked slabe, a tortered slabe, a dead slabe.  You're all alibe an' kickin', Geo'ge!  So you cheer up, an' somet'ing sure to come ob it; an' if not'ing comes ob it, w'y, de cheerin' up hab come ob it anyhow.\"  Foster smiled faintly at this philosophical view of his case, and did make a brave effort to follow the advice of his friend.  \"Das right, now, Geo'ge; you laugh an' grow fat.  Moreober, you go to work now, for if massa come an' find us here, he's bound to know de reason why!  Go to work, Geo'ge, an' forgit your troubles.  Das _my_ way--an' I's got a heap o' troubles, bress you!\"  So saying, Peter the Great rose and left our forlorn midshipman sitting in the arbour, where he remained for some time ruminating on past, present, and future instead of going to work.  Apart from the fact of his being a slave, the youth's condition at the moment was by no means disagreeable, for he was seated in a garden which must have borne no little resemblance to the great original of Eden, in a climate that may well be described as heavenly, with a view before him of similar gardens which swept in all their rich luxuriance over the slopes in front of him until they terminated on the edge of the blue and sparkling sea.  While seated there, lost in reverie, he was startled by the sound of approaching footsteps--very different indeed from the heavy tread of his friend Peter.  A guilty conscience made him glance round for a way of escape, but there was only one entrance to the bower.  While he was hesitating how to act, an opening in the foliage afforded him a passing glimpse of a female in the rich dress of a Moorish lady.  He was greatly surprised, being well aware of the jealousy with which Mohammedans guard their ladies from the eyes of men.  The explanation might lie in this, that Ben-Ahmed, being eccentric in this as in most other matters, afforded the inmates of his harem unusual liberty. Before he had time to think much on the subject, however, the lady in question turned into the arbour and stood before him.  If the word \"thunderstruck\" did justice in any degree to the state of mind which we wish to describe we would gladly use it, but it does not. Every language, from Gaelic to Chinese, equally fails to furnish an adequate word.  We therefore avoid the impossible and proceed, merely remarking that from the expression of both faces it was evident that each had met with a crushing surprise.  We can understand somewhat the midshipman's state of mind, for the being who stood before him was--was--well, we are again nonplussed!  Suffice it to say that she was a girl of fifteen summers--the other forty-five seasons being, of course, understood.  Beauty of feature and complexion she had, but these were lost, as it were, and almost forgotten, in her beauty of expression--tenderness, gentleness, urbanity, simplicity, and benignity in a state of fusion!  Now, do not run away, reader, with the idea of an Eastern princess, with gorgeous black eyes, raven hair, tall and graceful form, etcetera!  This apparition was fair, blue-eyed, golden-haired, girlish, sylph-like.  She was graceful, indeed, as the gazelle, but not tall, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21751"],["title","The Middy and the Moors: An Algerine Story (#8)"],["body","with an air of suavity that was irresistibly attractive.  She had a \"good\" face as well as a beautiful, and there was a slightly pitiful look about the eyebrows that seemed to want smoothing away.  How earnestly George Foster desired--with a gush of pity, or something of that sort--to smooth it away.  But he had too much delicacy of feeling as well as common sense to offer his services just then.  \"Oh, sir!\" exclaimed the girl, in perfect English, as she hastily threw a thin gauze veil over her face, \"forgive me!  I did not know you were here--else--my veil--but why should _I_ mind such customs?  You are an Englishman, I think?\"  Foster did not feel quite sure at that moment whether he was English, Irish, Scotch, or Dutch, so he looked foolish and said--  \"Y-yes.\"  \"I knew it.  I was sure of it!  Oh!  I am _so_ glad!\" exclaimed the girl, clasping her delicate little hands together and bursting into tears.  This was such a very unexpected climax, and so closely resembled the conduct of a child, that it suddenly restored our midshipman to self-possession.  Stepping quickly forward, he took one of the girl's hands in his, laid his other hand on her shoulder, and said--  \"Don't cry, my poor child!  If I can help you in any way, I'll be only too glad; but pray don't, _don't_ cry so.\"  \"I--I--can't help it,\" sobbed the girl, pulling away her hand--not on account of propriety, by any means: that never entered her young head-- but for the purpose of searching for a kerchief in a pocket that was _always_ undiscoverable among bewildering folds.  \"If--if--you only knew how long, _long_ it is since I heard an English--(where _is_ that _thing_!)--an English voice, you would not wonder.  And my father, my dear, dear, darling father--I have not heard of him for--for--\"  Here the poor thing broke down again and sobbed aloud, while the midshipman looked on, imbecile and helpless.  \"Pray, _don't_ cry,\" said Foster again earnestly.  \"Who are you? where did you come from?  Who and where is your father?  Do tell me, and how I can help you, for we may be interrupted?\"  This last remark did more to quiet the girl than anything else he had said.  \"You are right,\" she replied, drying her eyes quickly.  \"And, do you know the danger you run if found conversing with me?\"  \"No--not great danger, I hope?\"  \"The danger of being scourged to death, perhaps,\" she replied.  \"Then pray _do_ be quick, for I'd rather not get such a whipping--even for _your_ sake!\"  \"But our owner is not cruel,\" continued the girl.  \"He is kind--\"  \"Owner!  Is he not, then, your husband?\"  \"Oh, no.  He says he is keeping me for his son, who is away on a long voyage.  I have never seen him--and--I have such a dread of his coming back!\"  \"But you are English, are you not?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And your father?\"  \"He is also English, and a slave.  We have not met, nor have I heard of him, since we were parted on board ship many months ago.  Listen!\"    CHAPTER FIVE.  THE MAIDEN'S STORY--PETER THE GREAT AND THE MIDDY GO FOR A HOLIDAY AND SEE AWFUL THINGS.  During the conversation detailed in the last chapter the young English girl had spoken with her veil down.  She now threw it carelessly back, and, sitting down on a bench opposite our midshipman, folded her hands in her lap and remained silent for a few seconds, during which George Foster said--not aloud, but very privately to himself, \"Although your eyes are swelled and your little nose is red with crying, I never--no I never--did see such a dear, sweet, pretty little innocent face in all my life!\"  All unconscious of his thoughts, and still giving vent now and then to an irresistible sob, the poor child--for she was little more--looked up and began her sad tale.  \"About eight months ago my dear father, who is a merchant, resolved to take me with him on a voyage to some of the Mediterranean ports.  My father's name is Hugh Sommers--\"  \"And yours?\" asked Foster.  \"Is Hester.  We had only just entered the Mediterranean when one of those dreadful Algerine pirates took our vessel and made slaves of us all.  My darling father, being a very big, strong, and brave man, fought like a tiger.  Oh!  I never imagined that his dear kind face _could_ have looked as it did that awful day.  But although he knocked down and, I fear, killed many men, it was all of no use, they were so numerous and our men so few.  The last I saw of my father was when they were lowering him into a boat in a state of insensibility, with an awful cut all down his brow and cheek, from which the blood was pouring in streams.  \"I tried to get to him, but they held me back and took me down into the cabin.  There I met our owner, who, when he saw me, threw a veil over my head and bade me sit still.  I was too terrified and too despairing about my father to think of disobeying.  \"I think Ben-Ahmed, our owner, must be a man of power, for everybody seemed to obey him that day as if he was the chief man, though he was not the captain of the ship.  After a time he took my hand, put me into a small sailing boat, and took me ashore.  I looked eagerly for my father on landing, but he was nowhere to be seen, and--I have not seen him since.\"  \"Nor heard of or from him?\" asked Foster.  \"No.\"  At this point, as there were symptoms of another breakdown, our middy became anxious, and entreated Hester to go on.  With a strong effort she controlled her feelings.  \"Well, then, Ben-Ahmed brought me here, and, introducing me to his wives--he has four of them, only think!--said he had brought home a little wife for his son Osman.  Of course I thought they were joking, for you know girls of my age are never allowed to marry in England; but after a time I began to see that they meant it, and, d'you know--By the way, what is your name?\"  \"Foster--George Foster.\"  \"Well, Mr Foster, I was going to say that I _cannot_ help wishing and hoping that their son may _never_ come home!  Isn't that sinful?\"  \"I don't know much about the sin of it,\" said Foster, \"but I fervently hope the same thing from the very bottom of my heart.\"  \"And, oh!\" continued Hester, whimpering a little, \"you can't think what a relief it is to be able to talk with you about it.  It would have been a comfort to talk even to our big dog here about it, if it could only have understood English.  But, now,\" continued the poor little creature, while the troubled look returned to her eyebrows, \"what _is_ to be done?\"  \"Escape--somehow!\" said Foster promptly.  \"But nothing would induce me to even try to escape without my father,\" said Hester.  This was a damper to our midshipman.  To rescue a little girl seemed to him a mere nothing, in the glowing state of his heroic soul at that moment, but to rescue her \"very big, strong, and brave\" father at the same time did not appear so easy.  Still, something _must_ be attempted in that way.  \"Tell me,\" he said, \"what is your father like?\"  \"Tall, handsome, sweet, ex--\"  \"Yes, yes.  I know.  But I mean colour of hair, kind of nose, etcetera; be more particular, and do be quick!  I don't like to hurry you, but remember the possible scourging to death that hangs over me!\"  \"Well, he is very broad and strong, a Roman nose, large sweet mouth always smiling, large grey eyes--such loving eyes, too--with iron-grey hair, moustache, and beard.  You see, although it is not the fashion in England to wear beards, my dear father thinks it right to do so, for he is fond, he says, of doing only those things that he can give a good reason for, and as he can see no reason whatever for shaving off his moustachios and beard, any more than the hair of his head and eyebrows, he lets them grow.  I've heard people say that my father is wild in his notions, and some used to say, as if it was very awful, that,\" (she lowered her voice here), \"he is a Radical!  You know what a Radical is, I suppose?\"  \"Oh yes,\" said Foster, with the first laugh he had indulged in during the interview, \"a Radical is a man who wants to have everything his own way; to have all the property in the world equally divided among everybody; who wants all the power to be equally shared, and, in short, who wants everything turned upside down!\"  \"Hush! don't laugh so loud!\" said Hester, looking anxiously round, and holding up one of her pretty little fingers, \"some one may hear you and find us!  Strange,\" she added pensively, \"surely you must be under some mistake, for I heard my dear father try to explain it once to a friend, who seemed to me unwilling to understand.  I remember so well the quiet motion of his large, firm but sweet mouth as he spoke, and the look of his great, earnest eyes--`A Radical,' he said, `is one who wishes and tries to go to the root of every matter, and put all wrong things right without delay.'\"  What George Foster might have said to this definition of a Radical, coming, as it did, from such innocent lips, we cannot say, for the abrupt closing of a door at the other end of the garden caused Hester to jump up and run swiftly out of the bower.  Foster followed her example, and, returning to the scene of his labours, threw off his coat and began to dig with an amount of zeal worthy of his friend the incorrigible \"hyperkrite\" himself.  A few minutes later and Ben-Ahmed approached, in close conversation with Peter the Great.  \"Hallo!\" exclaimed the latter, in stern tones, as they came up, \"what you bin about, sar? what you bin doin'?  Not'ing done since I was here more an hour past--eh, sar?\"  The midshipman explained, with a somewhat guilty look and blush, that he had been resting in the bower, and that he had stayed much longer than he had intended.  \"You just hab, you rascal!  But I cure you ob dat,\" said the negro, catching up a piece of cane that was lying on the ground, with which he was about to administer condign chastisement to the idle slave, when his master stopped him.  \"Hurt him not,\" he said, raising his hand; \"is not this his first offence?\"  \"Yes, massa, de bery fust.\"  \"Well, tell him that the rod"]]]
