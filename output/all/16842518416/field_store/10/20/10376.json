He could not but feel, however, that the chances of this latter event occurring were small indeed, for a passing ship or boat would not only be going at great speed, but would be very unlikely to see his cockle-shell in the darkness, or to hear his cry in the roaring gale. Still he grasped that hope as the drowning man is said to clutch at a straw.  And the hope was quickly fulfilled, for scarcely had another half-hour elapsed when he observed a sail--the high-peaked sail peculiar to some Mediterranean craft--rise, ghost-like, out of the driving foam and spray.  The vessel was making almost straight for him; he knew that it would pass before there could be time to heave a rope.  At the risk of being run down he rowed the punt in front of it, as if courting destruction, but at the same time guided his little craft so skilfully that it passed close to leeward, where the vessel's bulwarks were dipping into the water.  Our middy's aim was so exact that the vessel only grazed the boat as it flew past.  In that moment young Foster sprang with the agility of a cat, capsized the boat with the impulse, caught the bulwarks and rigging of the vessel, and in another moment stood panting on her deck.  \"Hallo!  Neptune, what do _you_ want here?\" cried a gruff voice at Foster's elbows.  At the same time a powerful hand grasped his throat, and a lantern was thrust in his face.  \"Let go, and I will tell you,\" gasped the youth, restraining his indignation at such unnecessary violence.  The grasp tightened, however, instead of relaxing.  \"Speak out, baby-face,\" roared the voice, referring, in the latter expression, no doubt, to our hero's juvenility.  Instead of speaking out, George Foster hit out, and the voice with the lantern went down into the lee scuppers!  Then, the glare of the lantern being removed from his eyes, George saw, by the light of the binnacle lamp, that his adversary, a savage-looking Turk--at least in dress--was gathering himself up for a rush, and that the steersman, a huge negro, was grinning from ear to ear.  \"Go below!\" said a deep stern voice in the Arabic tongue.  The effect of this order was to cause the Turk with the broken lantern to change his mind, and retire with humility, while it solemnised the negro steersman's face almost miraculously.  The speaker was the captain of the vessel; a man of grave demeanour, herculean mould, and clothed in picturesque Eastern costume.  Turning with quiet politeness to Foster, he asked him in broken French how he had come on board.  The youth explained in French quite as much broken as that of his interrogator.  \"D'you speak English?\" he added.  To this the captain replied in English, still more shattered than his French, that he could, \"a ver' leetil,\" but that as he, (the youth), was a prisoner, there would be no occasion for speech at all, the proper attitude of a prisoner being that of absolute silence and obedience to orders.  \"A prisoner!\" ejaculated Foster, on recovering from the first shock of surprise.  \"Do you know that I am an officer in the Navy of his Majesty the King of Great Britain?\"  A gleam of satisfaction lighted up the swarthy features of the Turk for a moment as he replied--  \"Ver goot.  Ransum all de more greater.\"  As he spoke, a call from the look-out at the bow of the vessel induced him to hurry forward.  At the same instant a slight hissing sound caused Foster to turn to the steersman, whose black face was alive with intelligence, while an indescribable hitch up of his chin seemed to beckon the youth to approach with caution.  Foster perceived at once that the man wished his communication, whatever it was, to be unobserved by any one; he therefore moved towards him as if merely to glance at the compass.  \"Massa,\" said the negro, without looking at Foster or changing a muscle of his now stolid visage, \"you's in a dreffle fix.  Dis yer am a pirit. But _I's_ not a pirit, bress you!  I's wuss nor dat: I's a awrful hyperkrite! an' I wants to give you good adwice.  Wotiver you doos, _don't resist_.  You'll on'y git whacked if you do.\"  \"Thank you, Sambo.  But what if I do resist in spite of being whacked?\"  \"Den you bery soon change your mind, das all.  Moreober, my name's not Sambo.  It am Peter de Great.\"  As he said so Peter the Great drew himself up to his full height, and he drew himself up to six feet four when he did that!  The captain coming aft at that moment put an abrupt end to the conversation.  Two powerful Moorish seamen accompanied him.  These, without uttering a word, seized Foster by the arms.  In the strength of his indignation our middy was on the point of commencing a tremendous struggle, when Peter the Great's \"_don't resist_,\" and the emphasis with which it had been spoken, came to mind, and he suddenly gave in.  His hands were tied behind his back, and he was led down into a small, dimly-lighted cabin, where, being permitted to sit down on a locker, he was left to his own reflections.  These were by no means agreeable, as may well be supposed, for he now knew that he had fallen into the hands of those pests, the Algerine pirates, who at that time infested the Mediterranean.  With the thoughtlessness of youth Foster had never troubled his mind much about the piratical city of Algiers.  Of course he knew that it was a stronghold on the northern coast of Africa, inhabited by Moorish rascals, who, taking advantage of their position, issued from their port and pounced upon the merchantmen that entered the Mediterranean, confiscating their cargoes and enslaving their crews and passengers, or holding them to ransom.  He also knew, or had heard, that some of the great maritime powers paid subsidies to the Dey of Algiers to allow the vessels of their respective nations to come and go unmolested, but he could scarcely credit the latter fact.  It seemed to him, as indeed it was, preposterous.  \"For,\" said he to the brother middy who had given him the information, \"would not the nations whom the Dey had the impudence to tax join their fleets together, pay him an afternoon visit one fine day, and blow him and his Moors and Turks and city into a heap of rubbish?\"  What the middy replied we have now no means of knowing, but certain it is that his information was correct, for some of the principal nations did, at that time, submit to the degradation of this tax, and they did _not_ unite their fleets for the extinction of the pirates.  Poor George Foster now began to find out that the terrible truths which he had refused to believe were indeed great realities, and had now begun to affect himself.  He experienced an awful sinking of the heart when it occurred to him that no one would ever know anything about his fate, for the little boat would be sure to be found bottom up, sooner or later, and it would of course be assumed that he had been drowned.  Shall it be said that the young midshipman was weak, or wanting in courage, because he bowed his head and wept when the full force of his condition came home to him?  Nay, verily, for there was far more of grief for the prolonged agony that was in store for his mother and sister than for the fate that awaited himself.  He prayed as well as wept.  \"God help me--and them!\" he exclaimed aloud.  The prayer was brief but sincere,--perhaps the more sincere because so brief.  At all events it was that acknowledgment of utter helplessness which secures the help of the Almighty Arm.  Growing weary at last, he stretched himself on the locker, and, with the facility of robust health, fell into a sound sleep.  Youth, strength, and health are not easily incommoded by wet garments!  Besides, the weather was unusually warm at the time.  How long he slept he could not tell, but the sun was high when he awoke, and his clothes were quite dry.  Other signs there were that he had slept long, such as the steadiness of the breeze and the more regular motion of the vessel, which showed that the gale was over and the sea going down.  There was also a powerful sensation in what he styled his \"bread-basket\"--though it might, with equal truth, have been called his meat-and-vegetable basket--which told him more eloquently than anything else of the lapse of time.  Rising from his hard couch, and endeavouring to relieve the aching of the bound arms by change of position, he observed that the cabin hatch was open, and that nothing prevented his going on deck, if so disposed. Accordingly, he ascended, though with some difficulty, owing to his not having been trained to climb a ladder in a rough sea without the use of his hands.  A Moor, he observed, had taken his friend Peter the Great's place at the tiller, and the captain stood near the stern observing a passing vessel. A stiffish but steady breeze carried them swiftly over the waves, which, we might say, laughingly reflected the bright sunshine and the deep-blue sky.  Several vessels of different rigs and nationalities were sailing in various directions, both near and far away.  Going straight to the captain with an air of good-humoured _sang froid_ which was peculiar to him, Foster said--  \"Captain, don't you think I've had these bits of rope-yarn on my wrists long enough?  I'm not used, you see, to walking the deck without the use of my hands; and a heavy lurch, as like as not, would send me slap into the lee scuppers--sailor though I be.  Besides, I won't jump overboard without leave, you may rely upon that.  Neither will I attempt, single-handed, to fight your whole crew, so you needn't be afraid.\"  The stern Moor evidently understood part of this speech, and he was so tickled with the last remark that his habitual gravity gave place to the faintest flicker of a smile, while a twinkle gleamed for a moment in his eye.  Only for a moment, however.  Pointing over the side, he bade his prisoner \"look.\"  Foster looked, and beheld in the far distance a three-masted vessel that seemed to bear a strong resemblance to a British man-of-war.  \"You promise,\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21751"],["title","The Middy and the Moors: An Algerine Story (#2)"],["body"," captain, \"not shout or ro-ar.\"  \"I promise,\" answered our middy, \"neither to `Shout' nor `ro-ar'--for my doing either, even though like a bull of Bashan, would be of no earthly use at this distance.\"  \"Inglesemans,\" said the captain, \"niver brok the word!\"  After paying this scarcely-deserved compliment he gave an order to a sailor who was coiling up ropes near him, and the man at once proceeded to untie Foster's bonds.  \"My good fellow,\" said the midshipman, observing that his liberator was the man whom he had knocked down the night before, \"I'm sorry I had to floor you, but it was impossible to help it, you know.  An Englishman is like a bull-dog.  He won't suffer himself to be seized by the throat and choked if he can help it!\"  The Turk, who was evidently a renegade Briton, made no reply whatever to this address; but, after casting the lashings loose, returned to his former occupation.  Foster proceeded to thank the captain for his courtesy and make him acquainted with the state of his appetite, but he was evidently not in a conversational frame of mind.  Before a few words had been spoken the captain stopped him, and, pointing down the skylight, said, sharply--  \"Brukfust!  Go!\"  Both look and tone admonished our hero to obey.  He descended to the cabin, therefore, without finishing his sentence, and there discovered that \"brukfust\" consisted of two sea-biscuits and a mug of water.  To these dainties he applied himself with infinite relish, for he had always been Spartan-like as to the quality of his food, and hunger makes almost any kind of dish agreeable.  While thus engaged he heard a hurried trampling of feet on deck, mingled with sharp orders from the captain.  At first he thought the sounds might have reference to taking in a reef to prepare for a squall, but as the noise rather increased, his curiosity was roused, and he was about to return on deck when Peter the Great suddenly leaped into the cabin and took hurriedly from the opposite locker a brace of highly ornamented pistols and a scimitar.  \"What's wrong, Peter?\" asked Foster, starting up.  \"We's a-goin' to fight!\" groaned the negro.  \"Oh!  I's a awrful hyperkrite!  You stop where you am, massa, else you'll get whacked.\"  Despite the risk of being \"whacked,\" the youth would have followed the negro on deck, had not the hatch been slammed in his face and secured. Next moment he heard a volley of musketry on deck.  It was instantly replied to by a distant volley, and immediately thereafter groans and curses showed that the firing had not been without effect.  That the pirate had engaged a vessel of some sort was evident, and our hero, being naturally anxious to see if not to share in the fight, tried hard to get out of his prison, but without success.  He was obliged, therefore, to sit there inactive and listen to the wild confusion overhead.  At last there came a crash, followed by fiercer shouts and cries.  He knew that the vessels had met and that the pirates were boarding.  In a few minutes comparative silence ensued, broken only by occasional footsteps and the groaning of the wounded.    CHAPTER TWO.  AMONG PIRATES--ENSLAVED.  When George Foster was again permitted to go on deck the sight that he beheld was not calculated to comfort him in his misfortunes.  Several Moorish seamen were going about with bared legs and arms, swishing water on the decks and swabbing up the blood, with which they were bespattered.  Most of these men were more or less wounded and bandaged, for the crew of the merchantman they had attacked had offered a desperate resistance, knowing well the fate in store for them if captured.  The said merchantman, a large brig, sailed close alongside of the pirate vessel with a prize crew on board.  Her own men, who were Russians, had been put in chains in the fore part of their vessel under the forecastle, so as to be out of sight.  Her officers and several passengers had been removed to the pirate's quarter-deck.  Among them were an old gentleman of dignified bearing, and an elderly lady who seemed to be supported, physically as well as mentally, by a tall, dark-complexioned, noble-looking girl, who was evidently the daughter of the old gentleman, though whether also the daughter of the elderly lady young Foster could not discover, there being little or no resemblance between them.  The memory of his mother and sister strongly inclined the sympathetic midshipman to approach the party and offer words of consolation to the ladies.  As he advanced to them for that purpose, a doubt as to which language he should use assailed him.  French, he knew, was the language most likely to be understood, but a girl with such magnificent black eyes must certainly be Spanish!  His knowledge of Spanish was about equal to that of an ill-trained parrot, but what of that?  Was he not a Briton, whose chief characteristic is to go in for anything and stick at nothing?  We do not venture to write down what he said, but when he had said it the blank look of the elderly lady and the peculiar look of the girl induced him to repeat the speech in his broken--his very much broken-- French, whereupon the old gentleman turned to him gravely and said--  \"My vife is Engleesh, an' my datter is Danish--no, not joost--vell, she is 'af-an'-'af.  Speak to dem in your nattif tong.\"  \"_You_ are not English, anyhow, old boy,\" thought Foster, as he turned with a mingled feeling of confusion and recklessness to the elderly lady.  \"Pardon me, madam,\" he said, \"but from the appearance of--of--your--\"  He was interrupted at this point by the captain, who, flushed and blood-bespattered from the recent fight, came aft with a drawn scimitar in his hand, and sternly ordered the young midshipman to go forward.  It was a humiliating position to be placed in; yet, despite the \"stick-at-nothing\" spirit, he felt constrained to obey, but did so, nevertheless, with an air of defiant ferocity which relieved his feelings to some extent.  The said feelings were utterly ignored by the pirate captain, who did not condescend even to look at him after the first glance, but turned to the other captives and ordered them, in rather less stern tones, to \"go below,\" an order which was promptly obeyed.  On reaching the fore part of the vessel, Foster found several of the crew engaged in bandaging each other's wounds, and, from the clumsy way in which they went to work, it was very clear that they were much more accustomed to inflict wounds than to bandage them.  Now it must be told that, although George Foster was not a surgeon, he had an elder brother who was, and with whom he had associated constantly while he was studying and practising for his degree; hence he became acquainted with many useful facts and modes of action connected with the healing art, of which the world at large is ignorant.  Perceiving that one of the pirates was bungling a very simple operation, he stepped forward, and, with that assurance which results naturally from the combination of conscious power and \"cheek,\" took up the dressing of the wound.  At first the men seemed inclined to resent the interference, but when they saw that the \"Christian\" knew what he was about, and observed how well and swiftly he did the work, they stood aside and calmly submitted.  Foster was interrupted, however, in the midst of his philanthropic work by Peter the Great, who came forward and touched him on the shoulder.  \"Sorry to 't'rupt you, sar, but you come wid me.\"  \"Mayn't I finish this operation first?\" said Foster, looking up.  \"No, sar.  My orders is prumptory.\"  Our amateur surgeon dropped the bandage indignantly and followed the negro, who led him down into the hold, at the further and dark end of which he saw several wounded men lying, and beside them one or two whose motionless and straightened figures seemed to indicate that death had relieved them from earthly troubles.  Amongst these men he spent the night and all next day, with only a couple of biscuits and a mug of water to sustain him.  Next evening Peter the Great came down and bade him follow him to the other end of the hold.  \"Now, sar, you go in dere,\" said the negro, stopping and pointing to a small door in the bulkhead, inside of which was profound darkness.  Foster hesitated and looked at his big conductor.  \"'Bey orders, sar!\" said the negro, in a loud, stern voice of command. Then, stooping as if to open the little door, he added, in a low voice, \"Don' be a fool, massa.  _Submit_!  Das de word, if you don' want a whackin'.  It's a friend advises you.  Dere's one oder prisoner dere, but he's wounded, an' won't hurt you.  _Go_ in! won't you?\"  Peter the Great accompanied the last words with a violent thrust that sent the hapless middy headlong into the dark hole, but as he closed and fastened the door he muttered, \"Don' mind my leetle ways, massa.  You know I's bound to be a hyperkrite.\"  Having thus relieved his conscience, Peter returned to the deck, leaving the poor prisoner to rise and, as a first consequence, to hit his head on the beams above him.  The hole into which he had been thrust was truly a \"black hole,\" though neither so hot nor so deadly as that of Calcutta.  Extending his arms cautiously, he touched the side of the ship with his left hand; with the other he felt about for some time, but reached nothing until he had advanced a step, when his foot touched something on the floor, and he bent down to feel it, but shrank hastily back on touching what he perceived at once was a human form.  \"Pardon me, friend, whoever you are,\" he said quickly, \"I did not mean to--I did not know--are you badly hurt?\"  But no reply came from the wounded man--not even a groan.  A vague suspicion crossed Foster's mind.  The man might be dying of his wounds.  He spoke to him again in French and Spanish, but still got no reply!  Then he listened intently for his breathing, but all was as silent as the tomb.  With an irresistible impulse, yet instinctive shudder, he laid his"]]]
