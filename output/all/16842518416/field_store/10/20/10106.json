The Court roysterers, the Hectors, Nickers, Scourers, and Mohocks, among whom were numbered Sedley and Rochester, and others of the best poets of the day, are celebrated by him incidentally in those lines, unsurpassable for sombre magnificence, which he appends to his account of Belial--    In courts and palaces he also reigns,   And in luxurious cities, where the noise   Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,   And injury and outrage; and, when night   Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons   Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.  The public festivals of these later days are glanced at in _Samson Agonistes_--        Lords are lordliest in their wine;   And the well-feasted priest then soonest fired   With zeal, if aught religion seem concerned;   No less the people on their holy-days   Impetuous, insolent, unquenchable.  There is no relaxation, no trace of innocent lightheartedness, in any of the later poems. Even the garden of Paradise, where some gentle mirth might perhaps be permissible, is tenanted by grave livers, majestic, but not sprightly. In _L' Allegro_ the morning song of the milk-maid is \"blithe,\" and the music of the village dance is \"jocund.\" But Eve is described as \"jocund\" and \"blithe\" only when she is intoxicated by the mortal fruit of the tree; and the note of gaiety that is heard faintly, like a distant echo, in the earlier poems, is never sounded again by Milton.  So it is also with other things. The flowers scattered on the laureate hearse of Lycidas make a brighter, more various, and withal a homelier display than ever meets the eye in the Hesperian wildernesses of Eden. Or take the world of fairy lore that Milton inherited from the Elizabethans--a world to which not only Shakespeare, but also laborious and arrogant poet-scholars like Jonson and Drayton had free right of entry. Milton, too, could write of the fairies--in his youth--    With stories told of many a feat,   How Faery Mab the junkets eat.  But even in _Comus_ the most exquisite passage of fairy description is put into the mouth of Comus himself, chief of the band of ugly-headed monsters in glistering apparel--    The sounds and seas, with all their finny drove,   Now to the moon in wavering morrice move;   And on the tawny sands and shelves   Trip the pert fairies and the dapper elves.   By dimpled brook and fountain-brim,   The wood-nymphs decked with daisies trim,   Their merry wakes and pastimes keep:   What hath night to do with sleep?  The song and the dance are broken off, never to be resumed, when the staid footfall of the lady is heard approaching. Milton cannot draw ugliness; it turns into beauty or majesty on his hands. Satan has a large and enthusiastic party among readers of _Paradise Lost_. Comus, we are told, stands for a whole array of ugly vices--riot, intemperance, gluttony, and luxury. But what a delicate monster he is, and what a ravishing lyric strain he is master of! The pleasure that Milton forswore was a young god, the companion of Love and Youth, not an aged Silenus among the wine-skins. He viewed and described one whole realm of pagan loveliness, and then he turned his face the other way, and never looked back. Love is of the valley, and he lifted his eyes to the hills. His guiding star was not Christianity, which in its most characteristic and beautiful aspects had no fascination for him, but rather that severe and self-centred ideal of life and character which is called Puritanism. It is not a creed for weak natures; so that as the nominal religion of a whole populace it has inevitably fallen into some well-merited disrepute. Puritanism for him was not a body of law to be imposed outwardly on a gross and timid people, but an inspiration and a grace that falls from Heaven upon choice and rare natures--    Nor do I name of men the common rout,   That, wandering loose about,   Grow up and perish as the summer fly,   Heads without name, no more remember'd;  so sings the Chorus in _Samson Agonistes_--    But such as thou hast solemnly elected,   With gifts and graces eminently adorned,   To some great work, thy glory,   And people's safety, which in part they effect.  Under one form or another Puritanism is to be found in almost all religions, and in many systems of philosophy. Milton's Puritanism enabled him to combine his classical and Biblical studies, to reconcile his pagan and Christian admirations, Stoicism, and the Quakers. It was with no sense of incongruity that he gave to the Christ a speech in praise of--    Quintus, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus,...   Who could do mighty things, and could contemn   Riches, though offered from the hand of Kings.  To reject common ambitions, to refuse common enticements, to rule passions, desires, and fears, \"neither to change, nor falter, nor repent,\"--this was the wisdom and this the virtue that he set before himself. There is no beatific vision to keep his eyes from wandering among the shows of earth. Milton's heaven is colder than his earth, the home of Titans, whose employ is political and martial. When his imagination deals with earthly realities, the noble melancholy of the Greeks lies upon it. His last word on human life might be translated into Greek with no straining and no loss of meaning--    His servants He, with new acquist   Of true experience from this great event,   With peace and consolation hath dismissed,   And calm of mind, all passion spent.  He is therefore one of the few English poets (alone in this respect among the greatest) who have not sung of Love. His only English love-poem, the sonnet _To the Nightingale_, is his earliest and poorest sonnet. He elected in his later poems to sing of Marriage, its foundation in reason, its utility, its respectability and antiquity as an institution, and, above all, its amazing dangers. He has thus lost the devotion of the young, who, while they read poetry by the ear and eye for its sonorous suggestions, and its processions of vague shapes, love Milton; but when they come to read it for its matter and sentiment, leave him--in most cases never to return. The atmosphere of his later poems is that of some great public institution. Heaven is an Oriental despotism. Hell is a Secession parliament. In the happy garden itself there is no privacy, no individualism; it is the focus of the action, the central point of the attack and the defence; and a great part of the conversation of its inhabitants turns on the regulations under which they live. They never forget that they are all mankind, and when their psalm goes up in grateful adoration to their Creator, it is like the unanimous voice of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues.  \"The plan of _Paradise Lost_\" says Johnson, \"has this inconvenience, that it comprises neither human actions nor human manners. The man and woman who act and suffer are in a state which no other man and woman can ever know. The reader finds no transaction in which he can be engaged; beholds no condition in which he can by any effort of imagination place himself; he has, therefore, little natural curiosity and sympathy.\" Milton, he goes on to explain, \"knew human nature only in the gross, and had never studied the shades of character, nor the combinations of concurring or the perplexity of contending passions.\"  He knew human nature only in the gross. He treated nothing less momentous than the fortunes of the race. It is precisely from this cause that the incomparable grandeur of Milton's characters and situations springs. The conversations that he records are like international parleyings. Eve is the official Mother of mankind. Adam walks forth to meet the angel, in ambassadorial dignity, the accredited representative of the human race--            Without more train   Accompanied than with his own complete   Perfections; in himself was all his state,   More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits   On princes, when their rich retinue long   Of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold   Dazzles the crowd and sets them all agape.  And if the other characters of _Paradise Lost_ have this generic stamp, it is because the chief character of all has it--the character of the poet himself. It lends a strange dignity to the story of Milton's life that in all his doings he felt himself to be a \"cause,\" an agent of mighty purposes. This it is that more than excuses, it glorifies, his repeated magniloquent allusions to himself throughout the prose works. Holding himself on trust or on commission, he must needs report himself, not only to his great Taskmaster, but also from time to time to men, his expectant and impatient beneficiaries. Even in _Lycidas_ he is thinking of himself as much as of his dead companion--    So may some gentle Muse   With lucky words favour _my_ destined urn,   And as he passes turn,   And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud.  What if he die young himself? Are his dreams and hopes for his own future an illusion? He agonises with the question in the famous digression on poetry and poetic fame. But he consoles himself by appeal to a Court where the success and the fame of this world are as straw in the furnace; and then, having duly performed the obsequies of his friend, with reinvigorated heart he turns once more to the future--\"To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.\" A singular ending, no doubt, to an elegy! But it is blind and hasty to conclude that therefore the precedent laments are \"not to be considered as the effusion of real passion.\" A soldier's burial is not the less honoured because his comrades must turn from his grave to give their thought and strength and courage to the cause which was also his. The maimed rites, interrupted by the trumpet calling to action, are a loftier commemoration than the desolating laments of those who \"weep the more because they weep in vain.\" And in this way Milton's fierce tirade against the Church hirelings, and his preoccupation with his own ambitions support and explain each"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],["title","Milton (#5)"],["body","er, and find a fit place in the poem. He is looking to his equipment, if perchance he may live to do that in poetry and politics, which Edward King had died leaving unaccomplished. When his own time came he desired to be lamented in no other way--    Come, come; no time for lamentation now,   Nor much more cause. Samson hath quit himself   Like Samson, and heroicly hath finished   A life heroic, on his enemies   Fully revenged.  This overmastering sense of the cause breathes through all his numerous references to himself. He stands in the Forum,        Disturbed, yet comely, and in act   Raised, as of some great matter to begin;  and addresses himself, as he boasts in _The Second Defence of the People of England_, to \"the whole collective body of people, cities, states, and councils of the wise and eminent, through the wide expanse of anxious and listening Europe.\" Having sacrificed the use of his eyes to the service of the commonweal, he bates not a jot of heart or hope--            What supports me, dost thou ask?   The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied   In Liberty's defence, my noble task,   Of which all Europe talks from side to side.  And while thus his fighting years are filled with the exaltation of battle, as he plumes and lifts himself upon the cause that is going forward, the story of his closing years has in it much of the pathos of a lost cause. It was remarked by Johnson that there is in the _Paradise Lost_ little opportunity for the pathetic; only one passage, indeed, is allowed by him to be truly deserving of that name. But the description of the remorse and reconcilement of Adam and Eve, which Johnson doubtless intended, will not compare, for moving quality, with the matchless invocation to the Seventh Book--    More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged   To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,   On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues,   In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,   And solitude; yet not alone, while thou   Visit'st my slumbers nightly, or when Morn   Purples the East. Still govern thou my song,   Urania, and fit audience find, though few.  Then the noise that he had heard, in imagination only, thirty years earlier, assails his bodily ears; as evening sets in, the wonted roar is up, not in the wild woods of fancy inhabited by the sensual magician and his crew, but in the unlighted streets of Restoration London, as a chorus of cup-shotten brawlers goes roaring by. The king is enjoying his own again; and the poet, hunted and harassed in his last retreat, raises his petition again to the Muse whom he had invoked at the beginning of his task,--not Clio nor her sisters, but the spirit of heavenly power and heavenly wisdom; his mind reverts to that story of Orpheus which had always had so singular and personal a fascination for him; of Orpheus, who, holding himself aloof from the mad amorists of Thrace, was by them torn to pieces during the orgy of the Dionysia, and sent rolling down the torrent of the Hebrus; and he prays to his goddess and guardian--    But drive far off the barbarous dissonance   Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race   Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard   In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears   To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned   Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend   Her son. So fail not thou, who thee implores;   For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.  Disappointed of all his political hopes, living on neglected and poor for fourteen years after the Restoration, and dying a private citizen, passably obscure, Milton yet found and took a magnanimous revenge upon his enemies. They had crippled only his left hand in silencing the politician, but his right hand, which had hung useless by his side for so many years while he served the State, was his own still, and wielded a more Olympian weapon. In prose and politics he was a baffled man, but in poetry and vision he found his triumph. His ideas, which had gone a-begging among the politicians of his time, were stripped by him of the rags of circumstance, and cleansed of its dust, to be enthroned where they might secure a hearing for all time. The surprise that he prepared for the courtiers of the Restoration world was like Samson's revenge, in that it fell on them from above; and, as elsewhere in the poem of _Samson Agonistes_, Milton was thinking not very remotely of his own case when he wrote that jubilant semi-chorus, with the marvellous fugal succession of figures, wherein Samson, and by inference Milton himself, is compared to a smouldering fire revived, to a serpent attacking a hen-roost, to an eagle swooping on his helpless prey, and last, his enemies now silent for ever, to the phoenix, self-begotten and self-perpetuating. The Philistian nobility (or the Restoration notables) are described, with huge scorn, as ranged along the tiers of their theatre, like barnyard fowl blinking on their perch, watching, not without a flutter of apprehension, the vain attempts made on their safety by the reptile grovelling in the dust below--        But he, though blind of sight,   Despised, and thought extinguished quite,   With inward eyes illuminated,   His fiery virtue roused   From under ashes into sudden flame,   And as an evening dragon came,   Assailant on the perchèd roosts   And nests in order ranged   Of tame villatic fowl, but as an eagle   His cloudless thunder bolted on their heads.   So Virtue, given for lost,   Depressed and overthrown, as seemed,   Like that self-begotten bird   In the Arabian woods embost,   That no second knows nor third,   And lay erewhile a holocaust,   From out her ashy womb now teemed,   Revives, reflourishes, then vigorous most   When most unactive deemed;   And, though her body die, her fame survives.   A secular bird, ages of lives.     CHAPTER II THE PROSE WORKS   It is customary for the friends of Milton to approach his prose works with a sigh of apology. There is a deep-rooted prejudice among the English people against a poet who concerns himself intimately with politics. Whether this feeling has its origin in solicitude for the poet or for the politics is hard to determine; indeed it is pretty generally maintained that each is detrimental to the other. But seeing that for one man in the modern world who cares for poets there are at least ten who care for politics, it is safe to assume that the poets, when they are deprived of the franchise, are deprived rather to maintain the purity and efficiency of politics than for the good of their own souls. They have been compared to birds of Paradise, which were long believed to have no feet; and the common sense of the English people, with a touch of the municipal logic of Dogberry, has enacted that whereas they have no feet, and have moreover been proved to have no feet, it shall be forbidden them, under the strictest pains and penalties, to alight and walk. Their function is to beautify the distant landscape with the flash of wings.  For most men common-sense is the standard, and immediate utility the end, whereby they judge political questions, great and small. Now common-sense judges only the questions that are brought home to it by instant example; and utility is appealed to for a verdict only amid the dense crowd of actual conflicting interests. Neither the one nor the other is far-sighted or imaginative. So it comes about that the political system, in England, at least, is built up piecemeal; it is founded on appetites and compromises, and mortared by immemorial habit. To explain this process, and to transfigure it in the pure light of imagination, was the work of the great poet-politician, Edmund Burke. But the poet usually goes a hastier way to work. Looking at the whole domiciliary structure from outside, he finds it shapeless and ugly, like an ant-heap; and volunteers to play the architect. His design treats the details of individual habit and happiness in strict subordination to the desired whole. What he wants is consistency, symmetry, dignity; and to achieve these he is willing to make a holocaust of human selfishnesses. He may be a deep scholar and thinker, but he is apt to forget one point of ancient wisdom,--that it is the wearer of the shoe, and not the cobbler, who best knows where the shoe wrings him.  The speculations of the poet awaken no hostile resentment so long as they are admittedly abstract. He is at liberty to build his Republic, his City of the Sun, his Utopia, or his New Atlantis, amid the indifferent applause of mankind. But when his aim becomes practical and immediate, when he seeks to stir the heap by introducing into it the ruthless discomfort of an idea, a million littlenesses assail him with deadly enmity, and he is found sorrowfully protesting his amazement:--    I did but prompt the age to quit their clogs     By the known rules of ancient liberty,     When straight a barbarous noise environs me   Of owls and cuckoos, asses, apes, and dogs.  So he is brought, with great reluctance, to the estimate of men which is expressed by Milton in _The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates_; \"being slaves within doors, no wonder that they strive so much to have the public state conformably governed to the inward vicious rule whereby they govern themselves. For indeed none can love freedom heartily but good men.\"  Milton cannot claim the exemption from censure which is allowed to the theorists, the builders of ideal states somewhere in the clouds. On his own behalf he expressly disclaims any such intention. \"To sequester out of the world,\" he says, \"into Atlantic and Utopian politics, which never can be drawn into use, will not mend our condition; but to ordain wisely as in this world of evil, in the midst whereof God has placed us unavoidably.\" Poetry might well have served him, if his object had been to add another to imaginary commonwealths. He took up with politics because he believed that in the disorder of the times his ideas might be made "]]]
