It has been found in India that when a hunter pickets a goat on a plain as a bait, a tiger has whipped it off so quickly by a stroke of his paw that it was impossible to take aim.  To obviate this difficulty a small pit is dug, in the bottom of which the goat is picketed, with a small stone tied in its ear to make it cry the whole night.  When the suspicious tiger sees the appearance of a trap he walks round and round the pit, thus giving the hunter in ambush a fair shot.  When a hungry lion is watching for prey, the sight of any animal will make him commence stalking it.  On one occasion a man was very busy stalking a rhinoceros, when, happening to glance behind him, he found to his consternation that a lion was _stalking him_! he escaped by springing up a tree.  The strength of the lion is tremendous, owing to the immense mass of muscle around its jaws, shoulders, and forearms.  What one hears, however, of his sometimes seizing an ox or a horse in his mouth and running away with it, as a cat does with a mouse, and even leaping hedges, etcetera, is nonsense.  Dr Livingstone says that most of the feats of strength he has seen performed by lions consisted, not in carrying, but dragging or trailing the carcass along the ground.  He usually seizes his prey by the flank near the hind leg, or by the throat below the jaw.  He has his particular likings and tit-bits, and is very expert in carving out the parts of an animal that please him best.  An eland may be sometimes disembowelled by a lion so completely that he scarcely seems cut up at all, and the bowels and fatty parts of the interior form a full meal for the lion, however large or hungry he may be.  His pert little follower the jackal usually goes after him, sniffing about and waiting for a share, and is sometimes punished for his impudent familiarity with a stroke of the lion's paw, which of course kills him.  Lions are never seen in herds, but sometimes six or eight--probably one family--are seen hunting together.  Much has been said and written about the courage of the lion, and his ability to attack and kill any other animal.  His powers in this respect have been overrated.  It is questionable if a single lion ever attacks a full-grown buffalo.  When he assails a calf, the cow will rush upon him, and one toss from her horns is sufficient to kill him.  The amount of roaring usually heard at night, when a buffalo is killed, seems to indicate that more than one lion has been engaged in the fight.  They never attack any elephants, except the calves.  \"Every living thing,\" writes Livingstone, \"retires before the lordly elephant, yet a full-grown one would be an easier prey to the lion than a rhinoceros.  The lion rushes off at the mere sight of this latter beast!\"  When a lion grows too old to hunt game, he frequently retires to spend the decline of life in the suburbs of a native village, where he is well content to live by killing goats.  A woman or a child happening to go out at night sometimes falls a prey also.  Being unable, of course, to alter this style of life, when once he is reduced to it, he becomes habitually what is styled a \"man-eater,\" and from this circumstance has arisen the idea that when a lion has once tasted human flesh he prefers it to any other.  In reality a \"man-eater\" is an old fellow who cannot manage to get anything else to eat, and who might perhaps be more appropriately styled a woman and child eater!  When extreme old age comes upon him in the remote deserts, far from human habitations, he is constrained to appease the cravings of hunger with mice!  The African lion is of a tawny colour, like that of some mastiffs.  The mane in the male is large, and gives the idea of great power.  In some the ends of the hair are black, and these go by the name of black-maned lions, but, as a whole, all of them look of a tawny yellow colour.  Having said thus much about his general character and appearance, we shall resume the thread of our story, and show how the lions behaved to Tom Brown and his friends the very night after the event narrated in the last chapter.  The hunters had got back to the wagons, and were about to turn in for the night, in order to recruit for the work of the following day, when the sky became overcast, and gave every indication of a coming storm.  A buffalo bull had been shot by Pearson an hour before the arrival of our hero and his companions, and the Caffres were busily engaged on his carcass.  A fire had been lighted, the animal cut up, and part of him roasted, and the natives alternately ate a lump of roasted flesh and an equal quantity of the inside raw!  When the sky began to darken, however, they desisted for a time, and set about making preparations for the coming storm.  It burst upon them ere long with awful fury and grandeur, the elements warring with incredible vehemence.  Rain fell in such floods that it was scarcely possible to keep the fires burning, and the night was so pitchy dark that the hand could scarcely be seen when held close to the eyes. To add to the horror of the scene, crashing peals of thunder appeared to rend the sky, and these were preceded by flashes of lightning so vivid that each left the travellers with the impression of being stone-blind.  After an hour or two the storm passed by, leaving them drenched to the skin.  However, the fires were stirred up, and things made as comfortable as circumstances would admit of.  Just a little before daybreak they were all wakened by the bellowing of the oxen and the barking of dogs.  \"Something there,\" muttered Hicks, leaping up and seizing his gun.  The major, Tom Brown, Wilkins, Pearson, and the others were immediately on their feet and wide awake.  There was just light enough to distinguish objects dimly when close at hand; but the surrounding woods resembled a wall of impenetrable darkness.  Close to the wagon in which our hero lay the natives had erected a temporary hut of grass, about six feet high.  On the top of this he saw a dark form, which, by the sound of his voice, he recognised to be that of a native named Jumbo, who was more noted for good nature and drollery than for courage.  He was shouting lustily for a percussion-cap.  Tom sprang on the top of the hut and supplied him with several caps, at the same time exclaiming:--  \"Hallo!  Jumbo, don't make such a row.  You'll scare everything away.\"  \"Ho!  Me wish um could,\" said Jumbo, his teeth chattering in his head with fear as he listened to the dying groans of a poor ox, and heard the lions growling and roaring beside him.  They were not more than fourteen yards off, but so dark was the night that they could not be seen.  The ox, however, which was a black one, was faintly distinguishable; Tom Brown therefore aimed, as near as he could guess, about a foot above him and fired.  No result followed.  He had evidently missed.  While he was re-loading, the major and Wilkins rushed forward and leaped on the hut, exclaiming eagerly, \"Where are they? have you hit?\"  Immediately afterwards, Pearson, Brand, Ogilvie, and Anson rushed up and attempted to clamber on the hut.  \"No room here,\" cried the major, resisting them, \"quite full outside-- inside not safe!\"  \"But there's no room on the wagon,\" pleaded Pearson; \"the niggers are clustering on it like monkeys.\"  \"Can't help it,\" replied the major, \"there's not an inch of--\"  Here a tremendous roar interrupted him, and a loud report followed, as Jumbo and Wilkins, having caught sight of \"something\" near the carcass, fired simultaneously.  Pearson and his companions in trouble vanished like smoke, while the major, failing to see anything, fired in the direction of the lions on chance.  Tom also fired at what he felt convinced was the head of a lioness.  Still the animals appeared to be unhurt and indifferent!  The sportsmen were busy loading when Tom became aware, for one instant, that something was moving in the air.  Next moment he was knocked backwards off the hut, head over heels, several times, having been struck full in the chest by a lion's head.  Half inclined to believe that he was killed he scrambled to his feet, still holding fast to his gun, however, like a true hunter, and rushed towards the wagon, where he found all the Caffres who could not get inside sticking on the outside, as Pearson had said, like monkeys.  There was literally no room for more, but Tom cared not for that.  He seized legs, arms, and hair indiscriminately, and in another moment was on the top of the living mass.  He had leaped very smartly to this point of vantage, nevertheless he found Jumbo there before him, chattering worse than ever!  The major and and Wilkins came up breathless next moment, clambered halfway up, slipped, and fell to the ground with a united roar; but making a second attempt, they succeeded in getting up. Wilkins at once presented in the direction of the lions and again fired. Whether any of them fell is a matter of dispute, but certain it is that Wilkins fell, for the recoil of the gun knocked him back, his footing being insecure, and he went down on the top of a tent which had been pitched on the other side of the wagon, and broke the pole of it.  After this several more shots were fired, apparently without success.  While they were reloading a lion leaped on a goat, which was tethered to the grass-hut, and carried it away before any one could fire.  Not daring to descend from their places of security, there the whole party sat in the cold during the remainder of that night, listening to the growling of the lions as they feasted on their prey.  It was not till grey dawn appeared that the enemy beat a retreat, and allowed the shivering travellers to get once more between the blankets.  They had not lain long, however, when a double shot aroused them all, and they rushed out to find that Mafuta had killed a lioness!  She was a splendid creature, and had succumbed to a bullet sent through her ribs.  It was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21739"],["title","Hunting the Lions (#7)"],["body","on examination that another ball had hit her just behind the head, and travelling along the spine, had stuck near the root of the tail.  \"Me no hab fire at head,\" said Mafuta, with a disappointed look.  \"Me hit him in ribs wid wan bar'l, an' miss him wid tother.\"  \"What is that you say?\" cried Tom Brown examining the bullet-hole; \"ha! I claim that lioness, because I fired at her head last night, and there you have the bullet-hole.\"  \"Cut out the ball and see,\" said Hicks, drawing his knife.  When the ball was extracted it was indeed found to have been fired from Tom's gun, so, according to sporting law in that region, which ordains that he who first draws blood claims the game, the lioness was adjudged to belong to Tom.  Our hero returned to his blankets once more, congratulating himself not a little on his good fortune, when his attention was arrested by two shots in succession at no great distance.  Seizing his gun he ran to the place expecting to find that more game had been slain, but he only found Hardy standing over one of the oxen which was breathing its last.  The lions had driven it mad with terror during the night, and the trader had been obliged to shoot it.  This was a great misfortune, for it was about the best ox in the train.    CHAPTER SIX.  GIVES A FEW HINTS TO WOULD-BE HUNTERS, AND A FRIEND IN NEED IS INTRODUCED.  In describing the principal incidents of a long journey, it is impossible to avoid crowding them together, so as to give a somewhat false impression of the expedition as a whole.  The reader must not suppose that our hunters were perpetually engaged in fierce and deadly conflict with wild beasts and furious elements!  Although travelling in Africa involves a good deal more of this than is to be experienced in most other parts of the world, it is not without its periods of calm and repose.  Neither must it be imagined that the hunters--whom hitherto we have unavoidably exhibited in the light of men incapable of being overcome either by fatigues or alarms--were always in robust health, ready at any moment to leap into the grasp of a lion or the jaws of a crocodile.  Their life, on the whole, was checkered.  Sometimes health prevailed in the camp, and all went on well and heartily; so that they felt disposed to regard wagon-travelling--in the words of a writer of great experience--as a prolonged system of picnicking, excellent for the health, and agreeable to those who are not over-fastidious about trifles, and who delight in being in the open air.  At other times, especially when passing through unhealthy regions, some of their number were brought very low by severe illness, and others--even the strongest--suffered from the depressing influence of a deadly climate. But they were all men of true pluck, who persevered through heat and cold, health and sickness, until, in two instances, death terminated their career.  It may not be out of place here to make a few remarks for the benefit of those ardent spirits who feel desperately heroic and emulative when reading at their own firesides, and who are tempted by descriptions of adventure to set their hearts on going forth to \"do and dare,\" as others have done and dared before them!  All men are not heroes, and in many countries men may become average hunters without being particularly heroic.  In Norway, for instance, and in North America, any man of ordinary courage may become a Nimrod; and even heroes will have opportunities afforded them of facing dangers of a sufficiently appalling nature, if they choose to throw themselves in their way; but in Africa a man must be _really_ a hero if he would come off scatheless and with credit.  We have proved this to some extent already, and more proof is yet to come.  The dangers that one encounters in hunting there are not only very great and sufficiently numerous, but they are absolutely unavoidable.  The writer before quoted says on this point: \"A young sportsman, no matter how great among foxes, pheasants, and hounds, would do well to pause before resolving to brave fever for the excitement of risking the terrific charge of the elephant.  The step of that enormous brute when charging the hunter, though apparently not quick, is so long that the pace equals the speed of a good horse at a canter.  Its trumpeting or screaming when infuriated is more like what the shriek of a French steam-whistle would be to a man standing on the dangerous part of a railroad than any other earthly sound.  A horse unused to it will sometimes stand shivering instead of taking his rider out of danger.  It has happened often that the poor animal's legs do their duty so badly that he falls and exposes his rider to be trodden into a mummy; or losing his presence of mind, the rider may allow the horse to dash under a tree, and crack his cranium against a branch.  As one charge of an elephant has often been enough to make embryo hunters bid a final adieu to the chase, incipient Nimrods would do well to try their nerves by standing on railways till the engines are within a few yards of them, before going to Africa!\"  Begging pardon for this digression, we return to our tale.  While our sportsmen were advancing in company with the bullock-wagons one evening, at the close of a long and trying day, in which they had suffered a good deal from want of good water, they fell in with another party travelling in the opposite direction, and found that they belonged to the train of a missionary who had been on an expedition into the interior.  They gladly availed themselves of the opportunity thus afforded of encamping with a countryman, and called a halt for the night at a spot where a desert well existed.  As they sat round the fire that night, the missionary gave them some interesting and useful information about the country and the habits of the animals, as well as the condition of the natives.  \"Those who inhabit this region,\" said he, \"have always been very friendly to us, and listen attentively to instruction conveyed to them in their own tongue.  It is, however, difficult to give an idea to an Englishman of the little effect produced by our teaching, because no one can realise the degradation to which their minds have sunk by centuries of barbarism and hard struggling for the necessaries of life.  Like most other savages, they listen with respect and attention to our talk; but when we kneel down and address an unseen Being, the position and the act often appear to them so ridiculous, that they cannot refrain from bursting into uncontrollable laughter.  After a short time, however, they get over this tendency.  I was once present when a brother missionary attempted to sing in the midst of a wild heathen tribe of natives who had no music in their composition, and the effect on the risible faculties of the audience was such that the tears actually ran down their cheeks.\"  \"Surely, if this be so,\" said Tom Brown, \"it is scarcely worth your while to incur so much labour, expense, and hardship for the sake of results so trifling.\"  \"I have not spoken of results, but of beginnings,\" replied the missionary.  \"Where our efforts have been long-continued we have, through God's blessing, been successful, I sincerely believe, in bringing souls to the Saviour.  Of the effects of long-continued instruction there can be no reasonable doubt, and a mere nominal belief has never been considered by any body of missionaries as a sufficient proof of conversion.  True, our progress has been slow, and our difficulties have been great; but let me ask, my dear sir, has the slowness of your own journey to this point, and its great difficulty, damped your ardour or induced you to think it scarcely worth your while to go on?\"  \"Certainly not,\" replied Tom; \"I don't mean to give in yet.  I confess that our `bag' is not at present very large--nothing compared to what some sportsmen have had; but then if we persevere for a few months we are almost certain to succeed, whereas in your case the labour of many years seems to have been very much in vain.\"  \"Not in vain,\" answered the other, \"our influence has been powerfully felt, although the results are not obviously clear to every one who casts a mere passing glance at us and our field of labour.  But you speak of persevering labour in hunting as being almost certain of success, whereas we missionaries are _absolutely_ certain of it, because the Word, which cannot err, tells us that our labour is not in vain in the Lord, and, besides, even though we had no results at all to point to, we have the command, from which, even if we would, we cannot escape, `Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.'\"  \"Well, sir,\" said the major, with the air of a man who highly approves of the philanthropic efforts of all men, so long as they do not interfere with the even tenor of his own way, \"I am sure that your disinterested labours merit the gratitude of all good men, and I heartily wish you success.  In the course of your remarks to-night you have happened to mention that peculiar bird the ostrich.  May I ask if you have seen many of late?\"  The missionary smiled at this very obvious attempt to change the subject of conversation, but readily fell in with the major's humour, and replied--  \"Oh yes, you will find plenty of them in the course of a few days, if you hold on the course you are going.\"  \"Is it true that he goes at the pace of a railway locomotive?\" asked Wilkins.  \"It is not possible,\" replied the missionary, laughing, \"to give a direct answer to that question, inasmuch as the speed of the locomotive varies.\"  \"Well, say thirty miles an hour,\" said Wilkins.  \"His pace is not far short of that,\" answered the other.  \"When walking, his step is about twenty-six inches long, but when terrified and forced to run, his stride is from twelve to fourteen feet in length.  Once I had a pretty fair opportunity of counting his rate of speed with a stop-watch, and found that there were about thirty "]]]
