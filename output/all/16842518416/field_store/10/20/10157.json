Just then a heavy step was heard in the passage; and a young man of large and powerful frame, with a gentle as well as gentlemanly demeanour, appeared at the door.  \"Come in--come in,\" said Mrs Roby, with a bright look, \"this is only my new lodger, a friend of dear Wil--\"  \"Why, bless you, old 'ooman,\" interrupted Captain Wopper, \"_he_ knows me well enough.  I went to him this morning and got Mrs Stoutley's address.  Come in, Dr Lawrence.  I may claim to act the host here now in a small way, perhaps, and bid visitors welcome--eh!  Mrs Roby?\"  \"Surely, surely,\" replied the old woman.  \"Thank you both for the welcome,\" said the visitor with a pleasant smile, as he shook hands with Mrs Roby.  \"I thought I recognised your voice, Captain Wopper, as you passed Mrs Leven's door, and came out to see how you and my old friend here get on together.\"  \"Is she any better to-night, sir?\" asked Mrs Roby, anxiously.  Lawrence shook his head sadly and said she was no better, and that he feared she had little chance of getting better while her dissipated son dwelt under the same roof with her.  \"It is breaking her heart,\" he added, \"and, besides that, the nature of her disease is such that recovery is impossible unless she is fed on the most generous diet. This of course she cannot have, because she has no means of her own. Her son gambles away nearly all his small salary, and she refuses to go to an hospital lest her absence should be the removal of the last restraining link between him and destruction.  It is a very sad case-- very.\"  Captain Wopper was struck with this reference to gambling coming so soon after his recent conversation on that subject, and asked if there were no charitable societies or charitable people in London who would help in a case so miserable.  Yes, there were plenty of charitable institutions, Lawrence told him, but he feared that this woman had no special claim on any of them, and her refusal to go to an hospital would tell against her.  There were also, he said, plenty of charitable people, but all of those he happened to be acquainted with had been appealed to by him so often that he felt ashamed to try them again.  He had already given away as much of his own slender means as he could well spare, so that he saw no way out of the difficulty; but he had faith in Providential supervision of human affairs, and he believed that a way would yet be opened up.  \"You're right, sir--right,\" said Captain Wopper, with emphasis, while he looked earnestly into the face of the young doctor.  \"This world wasn't made to be kicked about like a foot-ball by chance, or circumstances, or anything of the sort.  Look 'ee here, sir; it has bin putt into my heart to feel charitable leanings, and a good bit o' cash has bin putt into my pocket, so that, bein' a lone sort o' man, I don't have much use for it. That's on the one hand.  On the other hand, here are you, sir, the son of a friend o' my chum Willum Stout, with great need of aid from charitable people, an' here we two are met together--both ready for action.  Now, I call that a Providential arrangement, so please putt me down as one of your charitable friends.  It's little I can boast of in that way as yet but it's not too late to begin.  I've long arrears to pull up, so I'll give you that to begin with.  It'll help to relieve Mrs Leven in the meantime.\"  As he spoke, the Captain drew a black pocketbook from his breast pocket and, taking a piece of paper therefrom, placed it in the doctor's hands.  \"This is a fifty-pound note!\" said Lawrence, in surprise.  \"Well, what then?\" returned the Captain.  \"You didn't expect a thousand-pound note, did you?\"  \"Not quite that,\" replied Lawrence, laughing, \"but I thought that perhaps you had made a mistake.\"  \"Ah! you judged from appearances, young man.  Don't you git into the way of doin' that, else you'll be for ever sailin' on the wrong tack.  Take my advice, an' never look as if you thought a man gave you more than he could afford.  Nobody never does that.\"  \"Far be it from me,\" returned Lawrence, \"to throw cold water on generous impulses.  I accept your gift with thanks, and will gladly put you on my list.  If you should find hereafter that I pump you rather hard, please to remember that you gave me encouragement to do so.\"  \"Pump away, sir.  When you've pumped dry, I'll tell you!\"  \"Well,\" said Lawrence, rising, \"I'll go at once and bring your liberality into play; and, since you have done me so good a turn, remember that you may command my services, if they can ever be of any use to you.\"  The Captain cast a glance at the trap-door and the chest.  \"Well,\" said he, \"I can scarcely ask you to do it professionally, but if you'd lend a hand to get this Noah's ark o' mine on to the upper deck, I'd--\"  \"Come along,\" cried Lawrence, jumping up with a laugh, and seizing one end of the \"ark.\"  Captain Wopper grasped the other end, and, between them, with much puffing, pushing, and squeezing, they thrust the box through the trap to the upper regions, whither the Captain followed it by means of the same gymnastic feat that he performed on his first ascent.  Thrusting his head down, he invited the doctor to \"come aloft,\" which the doctor did in the same undignified fashion, for his gentle manner and spirit had not debarred him from the practice and enjoyment of manly exercises.  \"It's a snug berth, you see,\" said the Captain, stumbling among the dusty lumber, and knocking his head against the beams, \"wants cleaning up, tho', and puttin' to rights a bit, but I'll soon manage that; and when I git the dirt and cobwebs cleared away, glass putt in the port-holes, and a whitewash on the roof and walls, it'll be a cabin fit for an admiral.  See what a splendid view of the river!  Just suited to a seafarin' man.\"  \"Capital!\" cried Lawrence, going down on his knees to obtain the view referred to.  \"Rather low in the roof, however, don't you think?\"  \"Low? not at all!\" exclaimed the Captain.  \"It's nothin' to what I've been used to on the coastin' trade off Californy.  Why, I've had to live in cabins so small that a tall man couldn't keep his back straight when he was sittin' on the lockers; but we didn't _sit_ much in 'em; we was chiefly used to go into 'em to lie down.  This is a palace to such cabins.\"  The doctor expressed satisfaction at finding that his new \"charitable contributor\" took such enlarged views of a pigeon-hole, and, promising to pay him another visit when the \"cabin\" should have been put to rights, said good-bye, and went to relieve the wants of the sick woman.  As the captain accompanied him along the passage, they heard the voice and step of poor Mrs Leven's dissipated son, as he came stumbling and singing up the stair.  He was a stout good-looking youth, and cast a half impudent half supercilious look at Captain Wopper on approaching.  He also bestowed a nod of careless recognition on Dr Lawrence.  Thinking it better to be out of the way, the Captain said good-bye again to his friend, and returned to the cabin, where he expressed to Mrs Roby the opinion that, \"that young feller Leven was goin' to the dogs at railway speed.\"  Thereafter he went \"aloft,\" and, as he expressed it, \"rigged himself out,\" in a spruce blue coat with brass buttons; blue vest and trousers to match; a white dicky with a collar attached and imitation carbuncle studs down the front.  To these he added a black silk neckerchief tied in a true sailor's knot but with the ends separated and carefully tucked away under his vest to prevent their interfering with the effulgence of the carbuncle studs; a pair of light shoes with a superabundance of new tie; a green silk handkerchief, to be carried in his hat, for the purpose of mopping his forehead when warm, and a red silk ditto to be carried in his pocket for the benefit of his nose.  In addition to the studs, Captain Wopper wore, as ornaments, a solid gold ring, the rude workmanship of which induced the belief that he must have made it himself, and a large gold watch, with a gold chain in the form of a cable, and a rough gold nugget attached to it in place of a seal or key. We class the watch among simple ornaments because, although it went-- very demonstratively too, with a loud self-asserting tick--its going was irregular and uncertain.  Sometimes it went too slow without apparent cause.  At other times it went too fast without provocation.  Frequently it struck altogether, and only consented to resume work after a good deal of gentle and persuasive threatening to wind it the wrong way.  It had chronic internal complaints, too, which produced sundry ominous clicks and sounds at certain periods of the day.  These passed off, however, towards evening.  Occasionally such sounds rushed as it were into a sudden whirr and series of convulsions, ending in a dead stop, which was an unmistakeable intimation to the Captain that something vital had given way; that the watch had gone into open mutiny, and nothing short of a visit to the watchmaker could restore it to life and duty.  \"I'm off now,\" said the Captain, descending when he was fully \"rigged.\" \"What about the door-key, mother?--you've no objection to my calling you mother, have you?\"  \"None whatever, Captain,\" replied Mrs Roby, with a pleasant smile, \"an old friend of William may call me whatever he pleases--short,\" she added after momentary pause, \"of swearin'.\"  \"Trust me, I'll stop short of that.  You see, old lady, I never know'd a mother, and I should like to try to feel what it's like to have one. It's true I'm not just a lad, but you are old enough to be my mother for all that, so I'll make the experiment.  But what about the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21698"],["title","Rivers of Ice (#8)"],["body","of the door, mother?  I can't expect you to let me in, you know.\"  \"Just lock it, and take the key away with you,\" said Mrs Roby.  \"But what if a fire should break out?\" said the Captain, with a look of indecision.  \"I'm not afraid of fire.  We've got a splendid brigade and plenty of fire-escapes, and a good kick from a fireman would open my door without a key.\"  \"Mother, you're a trump!  I'll lock you in and leave you with an easy mind--\"  He stopped abruptly, and Mrs Roby asked what was the matter.  \"Well, it's what I said about an easy mind that threw me all aback,\" replied the Captain, \"for to tell 'ee the truth, I haven't got an easy mind.\"  \"Not done anything wicked, I hope?\" said Mrs Roby, anxiously.  \"No, no; nothin' o' that sort; but there _is_ somethin' lyin' heavy on my mind, and I don't see why I shouldn't make a confidant o' you, bein' my mother, d'ee see; and, besides, it consarns Willum.\"  The old woman looked eagerly at her lodger as he knitted his brows in perplexity and smoothed down his forelock.  \"Here's where it is,\" he continued, drawing his chair closer to that of Mrs Roby; \"when Willum made me his exikooter, so to speak, he said to me, `Wopper,' says he, `I'm not one o' them fellers that holds on to his cash till he dies with it in his pocket.  I've got neither wife nor chick, as you know, an' so, wot I means to do is to give the bulk of it to them that I love while I'm alive--d'ee see?'  `I do, Willum,' says I. `Well then,' says he, `besides them little matters that I axed you to do for me, I want you to take partikler notice of two people.  One is the man as saved my life w'en I was a youngster, or, if he's dead, take notice of his child'n.  The other is that sweet young creeter, Emma Gray, who has done the correspondence with me so long for my poor brother.  You keep a sharp look-out an' find out how these two are off for money.  If Emma's rich, of course it's no use to give her what she don't need, and I'll give the most of what I've had the good fortune to dig up here to old Mr Lawrence, or his family, for my brother's widow, bein' rich, don't need it.  If both Emma and Lawrence are rich, why then, just let me know, and I'll try to hit on some other plan to make away with it, for you know well enough I couldn't use it all upon myself without going into wicked extravagance, and my dear old Mrs Roby wouldn't know what to do with so much cash if I sent it to her.  Now, you promise to do this for me?' says he.  `Willum,' says I, `I do.'\"  \"Now, mother,\" continued the Captain, \"what troubles me is this, that instead o' findin' Miss Emma rich, and Mr Lawrence poor, or _wice wersa_, or findin' 'em both rich, I finds 'em both poor.  That's where my difficulty lies.\"  Mrs Roby offered a prompt solution of this difficulty by suggesting that William should divide the money between them.  \"That would do all well enough,\" returned the Captain, \"if there were no under-currents drivin' the ship out of her true course.  But you see, mother, I find that the late Mr Stoutley's family is also poor--at least in difficulties--although they live in great style, and _seem_ to be rich; and from what I heard the other day, I know that the son is given to gamblin', and the mother seems to be extravagant, and both of 'em are ready enough to sponge on Miss Emma, who is quite willin'--far too willin'--to be sponged upon, so that whatever Willum gave to her would be just thrown away.  Now the question is,\" continued the Captain, looking seriously at the kettle with the defiant spout, \"what am I to advise Willum to do?\"  \"Advise him,\" replied Mrs Roby, promptly, \"to give _all_ the money to Dr Lawrence, and get Dr Lawrence to marry Miss Gray, and so they'll both get the whole of it.\"  A beaming smile crossed the Captain's visage.  \"Not a bad notion, mother; but what if Dr Lawrence, after gettin' the money, didn't want to marry Miss Gray?\"  \"Get him to marry her first and give the money afterwards,\" returned Mrs Roby.  \"Ay, that might do,\" replied the Captain, nodding slowly, \"only it may be that a man without means may hesitate about marryin' a girl without means, especially if he didn't want _her_, and she didn't want _him_.  I don't quite see how to get over all these difficulties.\"  \"There's only one way of getting over them,\" said Mrs Roby, \"and that is, by bringin' the young people together, and givin' 'em a chance to fall in love.\"  \"True, true, mother, but, so far as I know, Dr Lawrence don't know the family.  We couldn't,\" said the Captain, looking round the room, dubiously, \"ask 'em to take a quiet cup of tea here with us--eh?  You might ask Dr Lawrence, as your medical man, and I might ask Miss Emma, as an old friend of her uncle, quite in an off-hand way, you know, as if by chance.  They'd never see through the dodge, and would fall in love at once, perhaps--eh?\"  Captain Wopper said all this in a dubious tone, looking at the defiant kettle the while, as if propitiating its favourable reception of the idea, but it continued defiant, and hissed uncompromisingly, while its mistress laughed outright.  \"You're not much of a match-maker, I see,\" she said, on recovering composure.  \"No, Captain, it wouldn't do to ask 'em here to tea.\"  \"Well, well,\" said the Captain, rising, \"we'll let match-makin' alone for the present.  It's like tryin' to beat to wind'ard against a cyclone.  The best way is to square the yards, furl the sails, and scud under bare poles till it's over.  It's blowin' too hard just now for me to make headway, so I'll wear ship and scud.\"  In pursuance of this resolve, Captain Wopper put on his wide-awake, locked up his mother, and went off to dine at the \"west end.\"    CHAPTER FIVE.  IN WHICH SEVERAL IMPORTANT MATTERS ARE ARRANGED, AND GILLIE WHITE UNDERGOES SOME REMARKABLE AND HITHERTO UNKNOWN EXPERIENCES.  It is not necessary to inflict on the reader Mrs Stoutley's dinner in detail; suffice it to say, that Captain Wopper conducted himself, on the whole, much more creditably than his hostess had anticipated, and made himself so entertaining, especially to Lewis, that that young gentleman invited him to accompany the family to Switzerland, much to the amusement of his cousin Emma and the horror of his mother, who, although she enjoyed a private visit of the Captain, did not relish the thought of his becoming a travelling companion of the family.  She pretended not to hear the invitation given, but when Lewis, knowing full well the state of her mind, pressed the invitation, she shook her head at him covertly and frowned.  This by-play her son pretended not to see, and continued his entreaties, the Captain not having replied.  \"Now, do come with us, Captain Wopper,\" he said; \"it will be such fun, and we should all enjoy you _so_ much--wouldn't we, Emma?\"  (\"Yes, indeed,\" from Emma); \"and it would just be suited to your tastes and habits, for the fine, fresh air of the mountains bears a wonderful resemblance to that of the sea.  You've been accustomed no doubt to climb up the shrouds to the crosstrees; well, in Switzerland, you may climb up the hills to any sort of trees you like, and get shrouded in mist, or tumble over a precipice and get put into your shroud altogether; and--\"  \"Really, Lewie, you ought to be ashamed of making such bad puns,\" interrupted his mother.  \"Doubtless it would be very agreeable to have Captain Wopper with us, but I am quite sure it would be anything but pleasant for him to travel through such a wild country with such a wild goose as you for a companion.\"  \"You have modestly forgotten yourself and Emma,\" said Lewis; \"but come, let the Captain answer for himself.  You know, mother, it has been your wish, if not your intention, to get a companion for me on this trip--a fellow older than myself--a sort of travelling tutor, who could teach me something of the geology and botany of the country as we went along. Well, the Captain is older than me, I think, which is one of the requisites, and he could teach me astronomy, no doubt, and show me how to box the compass; in return for which, I could show him how to box an adversary's nose, as practised by the best authorities of the ring.  As to geology and botany, I know a little of these sciences already, and could impart my knowledge to the Captain, which would have the effect of fixing it more firmly in my own memory; and every one knows that it is of far greater importance to lay a good, solid groundwork of education, than to build a showy, superficial structure, on a bad foundation. Come, then, Captain, you see your advantages.  This is the last time of asking.  If you don't speak now, henceforth and for ever hold your tongue.\"  \"Well, my lad,\" said the Captain, with much gravity, \"I've turned the thing over in my mind, and since Mrs Stoutley is so good as to say it would be agreeable to her, I think I'll accept your invitation!\"  \"Bravo!  Captain, you're a true blue; come, have another glass of wine on the strength of it.\"  \"No wine, thank 'ee,\" said the Captain, placing his hand over his glass, \"I've had my beer; and I make it a rule never to mix my liquor.  Excuse me, ma'am,\" he continued, addressing his hostess, \"your son made mention of a tooter--a travellin' tooter; may I ask if you've provided yourself with one yet!\"  \"Not yet,\" answered Mrs Stoutley, feeling, but not looking, a little surprised at the question, \"I have no young friend at present quite suited for the position, and at short notice it is not easy to find a youth of talent willing to go, and on whom one can depend.  Can you recommend one?\"  Mrs Stoutley accompanied the question with a smile, for she put it in jest.  She was, therefore, not a little surprised when the Captain said promptly that he could--that he knew a young man--a doctor--who was just the very ticket (these were his exact words), a regular clipper, with everything about him trim, taut, and ship-shape, who would suit every member of the family to a tee!  A hearty laugh from every "]]]
