This tale, reader--if you read it through--will give you some insight into the condition, value, and vicissitudes of the light-vessels, or floating lighthouses, which guard the shores of this kingdom, and mark the dangerous shoals lying off some of our harbours and roadsteads.  It will also convey to you--if you don't skip--a general idea of the life and adventures of some of the men who have manned these interesting and curious craft in time past, as well as give you some account of the sayings and doings of several other personages more or less connected with our coasts.  May you read it with pleasure and profit, and--\"may your shadow never be less.\"  I gratefully express my acknowledgment and tender my best thanks to the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, to whose kindness I am indebted for having been permitted to spend a week on board the Gull-stream light-vessel, one of the three floating-lights which mark the Goodwin Sands; and to Robin Allen, Esquire, Secretary to the Trinity House, who has kindly furnished me with valuable books, papers, and information.  I have also gratefully to tender my best thanks to Captain Valle, District Superintendent under the Trinity House at Ramsgate, for the ready and extremely kind manner in which he afforded me every facility for visiting the various light-vessels and buoys of his district, and for observing the nature and duties of the service.  To the master of the Gull, whose \"bunk\" I occupied while he was on shore--to Mr John Leggett, the mate, who was in command during the period of my visit--and to the men of the \"Floating-light\" I have to offer my heartfelt thanks for not only receiving me with generous hospitality, but for treating me with hearty goodwill during my pleasant sojourn with them in their interesting and peculiar home.  My best thanks, for much useful and thrilling information, are due to Mr Isaac Jarman, the coxswain, and Mr Fish, the bowman, of the Ramsgate Lifeboat-men who may be said to carry their lives continually in their hands, and whose profession it is to go out at the call of duty and systematically grapple with Death and rob him of his prey.  To the Harbour Master, and Deputy Harbour Master at Ramsgate, I am also indebted for information and assistance, and to Mr Reading, the master of the Aid steam-tug, which attends upon, and shares the perils of, the Lifeboat.  R.M.  BALLANTYNE.  EDINBURGH, 1870.    CHAPTER ONE.  PARTICULAR INQUIRIES.  A light--clear, ruddy and brilliant, like a huge carbuncle--uprose one evening from the deep, and remained hovering about forty feet above the surface, scattering its rays far and wide, over the Downs to Ramsgate and Deal, along the coast towards Dover, away beyond the North Foreland, across the Goodwin Sands, and far out upon the bosom of the great North Sea.  It was a chill November evening, when this light arose, in the year-- well, it matters not what year.  We have good reasons, reader, for shrouding this point in mystery.  It may have been recently; it may have been \"long, long ago.\"  We don't intend to tell.  It was not the first time of that light's appearance, and it certainly was not the last.  Let it suffice that what we are about to relate did happen, sometime or other within the present century.  Besides being cold, the evening in question was somewhat stormy--\"gusty,\" as was said of it by a traveller with a stern visage and remarkably keen grey eyes, who entered the coffee-room of an hotel which stood on the margin of Ramsgate harbour facing the sea, and from the upper windows of which the light just mentioned was visible.  \"It is, sir,\" said the waiter, in reply to the \"gusty\" observation, stirring the fire while the traveller divested himself of his hat and greatcoat.  \"Think it's going to blow hard?\" inquired the traveller, planting himself firmly on the hearth-rug, with his back to the fire, and his thumbs hooked into the armholes of his waistcoat.  \"It may, sir, and it may not,\" answered the waiter, with the caution of a man who has resolved, come what may, never to commit himself. \"Sometimes it comes on to blow, sir, w'en we don't look for it; at other times it falls calm w'en we least expects it.  I don't pretend to understand much about the weather myself, sir, but I shouldn't wonder if it _was_ to come on to blow 'ard.  It ain't an uncommon thing at Ramsgate, sir.\"  The traveller, who was a man of few words, said \"Humph!\" to which the waiter dutifully replied \"Yessir,\" feeling, no doubt, that the observation was too limited to warrant a lengthened rejoinder.  The waiter of the Fortress Hotel had a pleasant, sociable, expressive countenance, which beamed into a philanthropic smile as he added--  \"Can I do anything for you, sir?\"  \"Yes--tea,\" answered the traveller with the keen grey eyes, turning, and poking the fire with the heel of his boot.  \"Anything _with_ it, sir?\" asked the waiter with that charmingly confident air peculiar to his class, which induces one almost to believe that if a plate of elephant's foot or a slice of crocodile's tail were ordered it would be produced, hot, in a few minutes.  \"D'you happen to know a man of the name of Jones in the town?\" demanded the traveller, facing round abruptly.  The waiter replied that he had the pleasure of knowing at least seven Joneses in the town.  \"Does one of the seven deal largely in cured fish and own a small sloop?\" asked the traveller.  \"Yessir, he do, but he don't live in Ramsgate; he belongs to Yarmouth, sir, comes 'ere only now and then.\"  \"D'you know anything about him?\"  \"No, sir, he don't frequent this 'otel.\"  The waiter said this in a tone which showed that he deemed that fact sufficient to render Jones altogether unworthy of human interest; \"but I believe,\" he added slowly, \"that he is said to 'ave plenty of money, bears a bad character, and is rather fond of his bottle, sir.\"  \"You know nothing more?\"  \"Nothing, sir.\"  \"Ham and eggs, dry toast and shrimps,\" said the keen-eyed traveller in reply to the reiterated question.  Before these viands were placed on the table the brief twilight had passed away and darkness en-shrouded land and sea.  After they had been consumed the traveller called for the latest local paper, to which he devoted himself for an hour with unflagging zeal--reading it straight through, apparently, advertisements and all, with as much diligence as if it were a part of his professional business to do so.  Then he tossed it away, rang the bell, and ordered a candle.  \"I suppose,\" he said, pointing towards the sea, as he was about to quit the room, \"that that is the floating light?\"  \"It is one of 'em, sir,\" replied the waiter.  \"There are three lights on the sands, sir; the Northsan 'ead, the Gull-stream, and the Southsan 'ead.  That one, sir, is the Gull.\"  \"How far off may it be?\"  \"About four miles, sir.\"  \"What is the mate's name?\"  \"Welton, sir, John Welton.\"  \"Is he aboard just now?\"  \"Yessir, it's the master's month ashore.  The master and mate 'ave it month an' month about, sir--one month afloat, next month ashore; but it seems to me, sir, that they have 'arder work w'en ashore than they 'ave w'en afloat--lookin' after the Trinity stores, sir, an' goin' off in the tender to shift and paint the buoys an' such like; but then you see, sir, w'en it's their turn ashore they always gits home to spend the nights with their families, sir, w'ich is a sort of compensation, as it were,--that's where it is, sir.\"  \"Humph! d'you know what time it is slack water out there in the afternoon just now?\"  \"About three o'clock, sir.\"  \"Call me at nine to-morrow; breakfast at half-past; beefsteaks, coffee, dry toast.  Good-night.\"  \"Yessir--good-night, sir--Number 27, sir, first floor, left-hand side.\"  Number 27 slammed his door with that degree of violence which indicates a stout arm and an easy conscience.  In less than quarter of an hour the keen grey eyes were veiled in slumber, as was proved unmistakably to the household by the sounds that proceeded from the nose to which these eyes belonged.  It is not unfrequently found that strength of mind, vigour of body, high colour, and a tremendous appetite are associated with great capacity for snoring.  The man with the keen grey eyes possessed all these qualities, as well as a large chin and a firm mouth, full of very strong white teeth.  He also possessed the convenient power of ability to go to sleep at a moment's notice and to remain in that felicitous condition until he chose to awake.  His order to be \"called\" in the morning had reference merely to hot water; for at the time of which we write men were still addicted to the ridiculous practice of shaving--a practice which, as every one knows, is now confined chiefly to very old men--who naturally find it difficult to give up the bad habit of a lifetime--and to little boys, who _erroneously_ suppose that the use of a sharp penknife will hasten Nature's operations.  Exactly at nine o'clock, a knock at the door and \"'Ot water, sir,\" sounded in the ears of Nunber 27.  At half-past nine precisely Number 27 entered the coffee-room, and was so closely followed by the waiter with breakfast that it seemed as if that self-sacrificing functionary had sat up all night keeping the meal hot in order to testify, by excessive punctuality, the devotion of his soul to duty.  The keen-eyed man had a keen appetite, if one might judge from appearances in such a matter.  A thick underdone steak that overwhelmed his plate appeared to melt away rapidly from before him.  Potatoes he disposed of in two bites each; small ones were immolated whole.  Of mustard he used as much as might have made a small-sized plaster; pepper he sowed broadcast; he made no account whatever of salt, and sugar was as nothing before him.  There was a peculiar crash in the sound produced by the biting of his toast, which was suggestive at once of irresistible power and thorough"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21735"],["title","The Floating Light of the Goodwin Sands (#1)"],["body","isintegration.  Coffee went down in half-cup gulps; shrimps disappeared in shoals, shells and all; and--in short, his proceedings might have explained to an intelligent observer how it is that so many men grow to be exceedingly fat, and why it is that hotel proprietors cannot afford to lower their apparently exorbitant charges. The waiter, standing modestly by, and looking on with solemn interest, mentally attributed the traveller's extraordinary powers and high health to the fact that he neither smoked nor drank.  It would be presumptuous in us to hazard a speculation on this subject in the face of an opinion held by one who was so thoroughly competent to judge.  Breakfast over, the keen-eyed man put on his hat and overcoat and sallied forth to the harbour, where he spent the greater part of the forenoon in loitering about, inspecting the boats--particularly the lifeboat--and the shipping with much interest, and entering into conversation with the boatmen who lounged upon the pier.  He was very gracious to the coxswain of the lifeboat--a bluff, deep-chested, hearty, neck-or-nothing sort of man, with an intelligent eye, almost as keen as his own, and a manner quite as prompt.  With this coxswain he conversed long about the nature of his stirring and dangerous duties.  He then made inquiry about his crew: how many men he had, and their circumstances; and, by the way, whether any of them happened to be named Jones.  One of them was so named, the coxswain said--Tom Jones.  This led the traveller to ask if Tom Jones owned a small sloop.  No, he didn't own a sloop, not even a boat.  Was there any other Jones in the town who owned a small sloop and dealt largely in cured fish?  Yes there was, and he was a regular gallow's-bird, if all reports were true, the coxswain told him.  The traveller did not press the subject long.  Having brought it up as it were incidentally, he dismissed it carelessly, and again concentrated his attention and interest on the lifeboat.  To all the men with whom he conversed this bluff man with the keen grey eyes put the same question, and he so contrived to put it that it seemed to be a matter of comparatively little interest to him whether there was or was not a man of the name of Jones in the town.  Nevertheless, he gained all the information about Jones that he desired, and then, hiring a boat, set out for the floating light.  The weather, that had appeared threatening during the night, suddenly became calm and fine, as if to corroborate the statement of the waiter of the Fortress Hotel in regard to its uncertainty; but knowing men in oilcloth sou'westers and long boots gave it as their opinion that the weather was not to be trusted.  Fortunately for the traveller, it remained trustworthy long enough to serve his purpose.  The calm permitted his boat to go safely alongside of the light-ship, and to climb up the side without difficulty.  The vessel in which he found himself was not by any means what we should style clipper-built--quite the reverse.  It was short for its length, bluff in the bows, round in the stern, and painted all over, excepting the mast and deck, of a bright red colour, like a great scarlet dragon, or a gigantic boiled lobster.  It might have been mistaken for the first attempt in the ship-building way of an infatuated boy, whose acquaintance with ships was founded on hearsay, and whose taste in colour was violently eccentric.  This remarkable thing had one immense mast in the middle of it, supported by six stays, like the Norse galleys of old, but it had no yards; for, although the sea was indeed its home, and it incessantly braved the fury of the storm, diurnally cleft the waters of flood and ebb-tide, and gallantly breasted the billows of ocean all the year round, it had no need of sails.  It never advanced an inch on its course, for it had no course.  It never made for any port. It was never either homeward or outward bound.  No streaming eyes ever watched its departure; no beating hearts ever hailed its return.  Its bowsprit never pointed either to \"Greenland's icy mountains, or India's coral strand,\" for it had no bowsprit at all.  Its helm was never swayed to port or starboard, although it _had_ a helm, because the vessel turned submissive with the tides, and its rudder, being lashed hard and fast amidships--like most weather-cocks--couldn't move.  Its doom was to tug perpetually, day and night, from year to year, at a gigantic anchor which would not let go, and to strain at a monster chain-cable which would not snap--in short, to strive for ever, like Sisyphus, after something which can never be attained.  A sad destiny, some may be tempted to exclaim.  No, reader, not so sad as it appears.  We have presented but one side of the picture.  That curious, almost ridiculous-looking craft, was among the aristocracy of shipping.  Its important office stamped it with nobility.  It lay there, conspicuous in its royal colour, from day to day and year to year, to mark the fair-way between the white cliffs of Old England and the outlying shoals--distinguished in daylight by a huge ball at its mast-head, and at night by a magnificent lantern with argand lamps and concave reflectors, which shot its rays like lightning far and wide over the watery waste, while, in thick weather, when neither ball nor light could be discerned, a sonorous gong gave its deep-toned warning to the approaching mariner, and let him know his position amid the surrounding dangers.  Without such warnings by night and by day, the world would suffer the loss of thousands of lives and untold millions of gold. Indeed the mere absence of such warnings for one stormy night would certainly result in loss irreparable to life and property.  As well might Great Britain dispense with her armies as with her floating lights!  That boiled-lobster-like craft was also, if we may be allowed to say so, stamped with magnanimity, because its services were disinterested and universal.  While other ships were sailing grandly to their ports in all their canvas panoply, and swelling with the pride of costly merchandise within, each unmindful of the other, _this_ ship remained floating there, destitute of cargo, either rich or poor, never in port, always on service, serene in all the majesty of her one settled self-sacrificing purpose--to guide the converging navies of the world safely past the dangerous shoals that meet them on their passage to the world's greatest port, the Thames, or to speed them safely thence when outward-bound.  That unclipperly craft, moreover, was a gallant vessel, because its post was one of danger.  When other ships fled on the wings of terror--or of storm trysails--to seek refuge in harbour and roadstead, this one merely lengthened her cable--as a knight might shake loose the reins of his war-horse on the eve of conflict--and calmly awaited the issue, prepared to let the storm do its worst, and to meet it with a bold front.  It lay right in the Channel, too, \"i' the imminent deadly breach,\" as it were, prepared to risk encounter with the thousands of ships, great and small, which passed to and fro continually;--to be grazed and fouled by clumsy steersmen, and to be run into at night by unmanageable wrecks or derelicts; ready for anything in fact--come weal come woe, blow high blow low--in the way of duty, for this vessel was the Floating Light that marked the Gull-stream off the celebrated and fatal Goodwin Sands.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE FLOATING LIGHT BECOMES THE SCENE OF FLOATING SURMISES AND VAGUE SUSPICIONS.  It must not be supposed, from what has been said, that the Gull Lightship was the only vessel of the kind that existed at that time. But she was a good type of the class of vessels (numbering at present about sixty) to which she belonged, and, both as regarded her situation and duties, was, and still is, one of the most interesting among the floating lights of the kingdom.  When the keen-eyed traveller stepped upon her well-scrubbed deck, he was courteously received by the mate, Mr John Welton, a strongly-built man above six feet in height, with a profusion of red hair, huge whiskers, and a very peculiar expression of countenance, in which were united calm self-possession, coolness, and firmness, with great good-humour and affability.  \"You are Mr Welton, I presume?\" said the traveller abruptly, touching his hat with his forefinger in acknowledgment of a similar salute from the mate.  \"That is my name, sir.\"  \"Will you do me the favour to read this letter?\" said the traveller, selecting a document from a portly pocket-book, and presenting it.  Without reply the mate unfolded the letter and quietly read it through, after which he folded and returned it to his visitor, remarking that he should be happy to furnish him with all the information he desired, if he would do him the favour to step down into the cabin.  \"I may set your mind at rest on one point at once,\" observed the stranger, as he moved towards the companion-hatch, \"my investigations have no reference whatever to yourself.\"  Mr Welton made no reply, but a slight look of perplexity that had rested on his brow while he read the letter cleared away.  \"Follow me, Mr Larks,\" he said, turning and descending the ladder sailor-fashion--which means crab-wise.  \"Do you happen to know anything,\" asked Mr Larks, as he prepared to follow, \"about a man of the name of Jones?  I have come to inquire particularly about him, and about your son, who, I am told--\"  The remainder of the sentence was lost in the cabin of the floating light.  Here, with the door and skylight shut, the mate remained closeted for a long time in close conference with the keen-eyed man, much to the surprise of the two men who constituted the watch on deck, because visitors of any kind to a floating light were about as rare as snowflakes in July, and the sudden advent of a visitor, who looked and acted mysteriously, was in itself a profound mystery.  Their curiosity, however, "]]]
