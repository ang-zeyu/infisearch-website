The whole of this law,      but especially the 7th section, requires your particular      attention; that section declares, that _any_ ship or vessel which      shall be found in any river, port, bay, or harbor, or on the high      seas, within the jurisdictional limits of the United States, or      hovering on the coast thereof, having on board any negro,      mulatto, or person of color, for the purpose of selling them as      slaves, or with intent to land the same in any port or place      within the jurisdiction of the United States, contrary to the      prohibition of the act, shall, together with her tackle, apparel,      and furniture, and the goods and effects which shall be found on      board the same, be forfeited and may be seized, prosecuted, and      condemned in any court of the United States having jurisdiction      thereof.       \"It further authorizes the President of the United States to      cause any of the armed vessels of the United States to be manned      and employed to cruise on any part of the coast of the United      States, or territories thereof, and to instruct and direct the      commanders to seize, take, and bring into any port of the United      States, all such ships or vessels; and, moreover, to seize, take,      and bring into any port of the United States, all ships or      vessels _of the United States, wherever found on the high seas_,      contravening the provisions of the act, to be proceeded against      according to law.       \"You will, therefore, consider yourself hereby especially      instructed and required, and you will instruct and require all      officers placed under your command, to seize, take, and bring      into port, _any vessel of whatever nature_, found in any river,      port, bay, or harbor, or on the high seas, within the      jurisdictional limits of the United States, or hovering on the      coast thereof, having on board any negro, mulatto, or person of      color, for the purpose of selling them as slaves, or with intent      to land the same, contrary to law; and, moreover, to seize, take,      and bring into port, all ships or vessels _of the United States_,      wheresoever found on the high seas or elsewhere, contravening the      provisions of the law. Vessels thus to be seized, may be brought      into _any_ port of the United States; and when brought into port,      must, without delay, be reported to the district-attorney of the      United States residing in the district in which such port may be,      who will institute such further proceedings as law and justice      require.       \"Every person found on board of such vessels must be taken      especial care of. The negroes, mulattoes, or persons of color,      are to be delivered to such persons as the respective States may      appoint to receive the same. The commanders and crews of such      vessels will be held under the prosecutions of the      district-attorneys, to answer the pains and penalties prescribed      by law for their respective offences. Whenever negroes,      mulattoes, or persons of color shall be delivered to the persons      appointed to receive the same, duplicate receipts must be taken      therefore, and if no person shall be appointed by the respective      States to receive them, they must be delivered 'to the overseers      of the poor of the port or place where such ship or vessel may be      brought or found,' and an account of your proceedings, together      with the number and descriptive list of such negroes, mulattoes,      or persons of color, must be immediately transmitted to the      governor or chief magistrate of the State. You will communicate      to me, minutely, all your proceedings.                                     \"I am, sir, respectfully, etc.                                                   PAUL HAMILTON.       \"H. G. CAMPBELL, _Commanding Naval Officer_,            Charleston, S. C.\"  On the 17th of December, 1819, President Monroe sent the following message to Congress on the subject of the slave-trade:                             \"MESSAGE.       \"_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United      States_:       \"Some doubt being entertained respecting the true intent and      meaning of the act of the last session, entitled 'An Act in      addition to the Acts prohibiting the slave-trade,' as to the      duties of the agents, to be appointed on the coast of Africa, I      think it proper to state the interpretation which has been given      of the act, and the measures adopted to carry it into effect,      that Congress may, should it be deemed advisable, amend the same,      before further proceeding is had under it.       \"The obligation to instruct the commanders of all our armed      vessels to seize and bring into port all ships or vessels of the      United States, wheresoever found, having on board any negro,      mulatto, or person of color, in violation of former acts for the      suppression of the slave-trade, being imperative, was executed      without delay. No seizures have yet been made, but, as they were      contemplated by the law, and might be presumed, it seemed proper      to make the necessary regulations applicable to such seizures for      carrying the several provisions of the act into effect.       \"It is enjoined on the executive to cause all negroes, mulattoes,      or persons of color, who may be taken under the act, to be      removed to Africa. It is the obvious import of the law, that none      of the persons thus taken should remain within the United States;      and no place other than the coast of Africa being designated,      their removal or delivery, whether carried from the United States      or landed immediately from the vessels in which they were taken,      was supposed to be confined to that coast. No settlement or      station being specified, the whole coast was thought to be left      open for the selection of a proper place, at which the persons      thus taken should be delivered. The executive is authorized to      appoint one or more agents, residing there, to receive such      persons; and one hundred thousand dollars are appropriated for      the general purposes of the law.       \"On due consideration of the several sections of the act, and of      its humane policy, it was supposed to be the intention of      Congress, that all the persons above described, who might be      taken under it, and landed in Africa, should be aided in their      return to their former homes, or in their establishment at or      near the place where landed. Some shelter and food would be      necessary for them there, as soon as landed, let their subsequent      disposition be what it might. Should they be landed without such      provision having been previously made, they might perish. It was      supposed, by the authority given to the executive to appoint      agents residing on that coast, that they should provide such      shelter and food, and perform the other beneficent and charitable      offices contemplated by the act. The coast of Africa having been      little explored, and no persons residing there who possessed the      requisite qualifications to entitle them to the trust being known      to the executive, to none such could it be committed. It was      believed that citizens only, who would go hence, well instructed      in the views of their government, and zealous to give them      effect, would be competent to these duties, and that it was not      the intention of the law to preclude their appointment. It was      obvious that the longer these persons should be detained in the      United States in the hands of the marshals, the greater would be      the expense, and that for the same term would the main purpose of      the law be suspended. It seemed, therefore, to be incumbent on me      to make the necessary arrangements for carrying this act into      effect in Africa, in time to meet the delivery of any persons who      might be taken by the public vessels, and landed there under it.       \"On this view of the policy and sanctions of the law, it has been      decided to send a public ship to the coast of Africa with two      such agents, who will take with them tools and other implements      necessary for the purposes above mentioned. To each of these      agents a small salary has been allowed--fifteen hundred dollars      to the principal, and twelve hundred to the other. All our public      agents on the coast of Africa receive salaries for their      services, and it was understood that none of our citizens      possessing the requisite qualifications would accept these      trusts, by which they would be confined to parts the least      frequented and civilized, without a reasonable compensation. Such      allowance, therefore, seemed to be indispensable to the execution      of the act. It is intended, also, to subject a portion of the sum      appropriated, to the order of the principal agent, for the      special objects above stated, amounting in the whole, including      the salaries of the agents for one year, to rather less than one      third of the appropriation. Special instructions will be given to      these agents, defining, in precise terms, their duties in regard      to the persons thus delivered to them; the disbursement of the      money by the principal agent; and his accountability for the      same. They will also have power to select the most suitable place      on the coast of Africa, at which all persons who may be taken      under this act shall be delivered to them, with an express      injunction to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21851"],["title","History of the Negro Race in America from 1619 to 1880. Vol. 2 (#7)"],["body","no power founded on the principle of      colonization, or other power than that of performing the      benevolent offices above recited, by the permission and sanction      of the existing government under which they may establish      themselves. Orders will be given to the commander of the public      ship in which they will sail, to cruise along the coast, to give      the more complete effect to the principal object of the act.                                                    \"JAMES MONROE.       \"WASHINGTON, December, 17, 1819.\"  In March, 1818, the delegate from Missouri presented petitions from the inhabitants of that territory, praying to be admitted into the Union as a State. They were referred to a select committee, and a bill was reported for the admission of Missouri as a State on equal footing with the other States. The bill was read twice, when it was sent to the Committee of the Whole, where it was permitted to remain during the entire session. During the next session, on the 13th of February, 1819, the House went into the Committee of the Whole with Gen. Smith, of Maryland, in the chair. The committee had two sittings during which they discussed the bill. Gen. Tallmadge, of New York, offered the following amendment directed against the life of the clause admitting slavery:       \"And provided that the introduction of slavery, or involuntary      servitude, be prohibited, except for the punishment of crimes      whereof the party has been duly convicted, and that all children      born within the said State, after the admission thereof into the      Union, shall be declared free at the age of twenty-five years.\"  A long and an able discussion followed, in which the authority of the government to prohibit slavery under new State governments was affirmed and denied. On coming out of the Committee of the Whole, the yeas and nays were demanded on the amendment prohibiting the introduction of slavery into Missouri, and resulted as follows: yeas, 87,--only one vote from the South, Delaware; nays, 76,--ten votes from Northern States. Upon the latter clause of the amendment--\"and that all children of slaves, born within the said State, after the admission thereof into the Union, shall be declared free at the age of twenty-five years\": yeas, 82,--one vote from Maryland; nays, 78,--fourteen from Northern States. And thus the entire amendment of Gen. Tallmadge was sustained, and being reported to the House, passed by a vote 98 to 56.  The bill reached the Senate on the 17th of February, and after its second reading was referred to a select committee. On the 22d of February, the chairman, Mr. Tait, of Georgia, reported the bill back with amendments, striking out the Tallmadge restriction clauses. The House went into the Committee of the Whole on the 27th of February, to consider the bill, when Mr. Wilson, of New Jersey, moved to postpone the further consideration of the bill until the 5th of March. It was rejected. The committee then began to vote upon the recommendations of the select committee. Upon striking out the House amendment, providing that all the children of slaves born within said State should be free, etc., it was carried by a vote of 27 to 7, eleven Northern Senators voting to strike out. The seven votes against striking out were all from free States.  Upon the clause prohibiting servitude except for crimes, etc., 22 votes were cast for striking out,--five being from Northern States; against striking out, 16,--and they were all from Northern States.  Thus amended, the bill was ordered to be engrossed, and on the 2d of March--the last day but one of the session--was read a third time and passed. It was returned to the House, where the amendments were read, when Mr. Tallmadge moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed. His motion was rejected by a vote of: yeas, 69; nays, 74. But upon a motion to concur in the Senate amendments, the House refused to concur: yeas, 76; nays, 78. The Senate adhered to their amendments, and the House adhered to their disagreement by a vote of 76 to 66; and thus the bill fell between the two Houses and was lost.  The southern portion of the territory of Missouri, which was not included within the limits of the proposed State, was organized as a separate territory, under the designation of the Arkansas Territory. After considerable debate, and several attempts to insert an amendment for the restriction of slavery, the bill creating the territory of Arkansas passed without any reference to slavery, and thus the territory was left open to slavery, and also the State some years later.  The Congressional discussion of the slavery question aroused the anti-slavery sentiment of the North, which found expression in large and earnest meetings, in pungent editorials, and numerous memorials. At Trenton, New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and other places, the indignation against slavery was great. On December 3, 1819, a large meeting was held in the State House at Boston, when a resolution was adopted to memorialize Congress on the subject of \"restraining the increase of slavery in _new States_ to be admitted into the Union.\" The memorial was drawn by Daniel Webster, and signed by himself, George Blake, Josiah Quincy, James T. Austin, and others. The New York Legislature passed resolutions against the extension of slavery into the territories and new States; and requested the Congressmen and instructed the Senators from that State not to vote for the admission of any State into the Union, except such State should pledge itself to unqualified restriction in the letter and spirit of the ordinance of 1787. These resolutions were signed on January 17, 1820.  On the 24th of January the New Jersey Legislature followed in the same strain, with six pertinent resolves, a copy of which the governor was requested to forward \"to each of the senators and representatives of this State, in the Congress of the United States.\"  Pennsylvania had taken action on the 11th of December, 1819; but the resolves were not signed by Gov. William Findlay until the 16th of the month. The Legislature was composed of fifty-four Democrats and twenty Whigs, and yet there was not a dissenting vote cast.  Two Southern States passed resolutions,--Delaware and Kentucky: the first in favor of restriction, the last opposed to restriction.  The effort to secure the admission of Missouri with a slave constitution was not dead, but only sleeping. The bill was called up as a special order on the 24th of January, 1820. It occupied most of the time of the House from the 25th of January till the 19th of February, when a bill came from the Senate providing for the admission of Maine into the Union, but containing a rider authorizing the people of Missouri to adopt a State constitution, etc., without restrictions respecting slavery. The bill providing for the admission of Maine had passed the House during the early days of the session, and now returned to the House for concurrence in the rider. The debate on the bill and amendments had occupied much of the time of the Senate. In the Judiciary Committee on the 16th of February, the question was taken on amendments to the Maine admission bill, authorizing Missouri to form a State constitution, making no mention of slavery: and twenty-three votes were cast against restriction,--three from Northern States; twenty-one in favor of restriction,--but only two from the South.  Mr. Thomas offered a resolution reaffirming the doctrine of the sixth article of the ordinance of 1787, and declaring its applicability to all that territory ceded to the United States by France, under the general designation of Louisiana, which lies north of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north latitude, etc. But on the following day he withdrew his original amendment, and submitted the following:       \"_And be it further enacted_, That in all the territory ceded by      France to the United States, under the name of Louisiana, which      lies north of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes, north latitude,      excepting only such part thereof as is included within the limits      of the State contemplated by this act, slavery and involuntary      servitude, otherwise than in the punishment of crime whereof the      party shall have been duly convicted, shall be and is hereby      forever prohibited. Provided always, that any person escaping      into the same, from where labor or service is lawfully claimed in      any State or territory of the United States, such fugitive may be      lawfully reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her      labor or service as aforesaid.\"  Mr. Trimble, of Ohio, offered a substitute, but it was rejected. The question recurring upon the passage of the amendment of Mr. Thomas, excluding slavery from all the territory north and west of Missouri, it was carried by a vote of 34 to 20.  Thus amended, the bill was ordered to engrossment by a vote of 24 to 20. On the 18th of February the bill passed, and this was its condition when it came to the House. By a vote of 93 to 72 the House agreed not to leave the Missouri question on the Maine bill as a rider; but immediately thereafter struck out the Thomas Senate amendment by a vote of 159 to 18. The House disagreed to the remaining Senate amendments, striking out the clause restricting slavery in Missouri by a vote of 102 to 68.  Thus rejected, the bill was returned to the Senate shorn of its amendments. After four days of debate in the Senate it was decided not to recede from the attachment of the Missouri subject to the Maine bill; not to recede from the amendment prohibiting slavery west of Missouri, and north of 36° 30´ north latitude, and insisted upon the remaining amendments without division.  When the bill was returned to the House a motion was made to insist upon its disagreement to all but section nine of the Senate amendments, and was carried by a vote of 97 to 76.  The Senate asked for a"]]]
