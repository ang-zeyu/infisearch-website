Unfortunately there was none. The burglar’s profession, so far as       he had practised it, was undergoing a timely eclipse. Time was       when it had been lucrative, its rewards great. Then the law,       which is no respecter of professions of that kind, had got him.       “Crackerjack” had but recently returned from a protracted sojourn       at an institution arranged by the State in its paternalism for       the reception and harbouring of such as he. The pitiful dole with       which the discharged prisoner had been unloaded upon a world       which had no welcome for him had been soon spent; even the       hideous prison-made clothes had been pawned, and some rags, which       were yet the rags of a free man, which had been preserved through       the long period of separation by his wife, gave him a poor       shelter from the winter’s cold.        That wife had been faithful to him. She had done the best she       could for herself and baby during the five years of the absence       of the bread winner, or in his case the bread taker would be the       better phrase. She had eagerly waited the hour of his release;       her joy had been soon turned to bitterness. The fact that he had       been in prison had shut every door against him and even closed       the few that had been open to her. The three pieces of human       flotsam had been driven by the wind of adversity and tossed. They       knew not where to turn when jettisoned by society.        Came Christmas Eve. They had no money and no food and no fire.       Stop! The fire of love burned in the woman’s heart, the fire of       hate in the man’s. Prison life usually completes the education in       shame of the unfortunate men who are thrust there. This was       before the days in which humane men interested themselves in       prisons and prisoners and strove to awaken the world to its       responsibilities to, as well as the possibilities of, the       convict.        But “Crackerjack” was a man of unusual character. Poverty,       remorse, drink, all the things that go to wreck men by forcing       them into evil courses had laid him low, and because he was a man       originally of education and ability, he had shone as a criminal.       The same force of character which made him super-burglar could       change him from criminal to man if by chance they could be       enlisted in the endeavour.        He had involved the wife he had married in his misfortunes. She       had been a good woman, weaker than he, yet she stuck to him. God       chose the weak thing to rejuvenate the strong. In the prison he       had enjoyed abundant leisure for reflection. After he learned of       the birth of his daughter he determined to do differently when he       was freed. Many men determine, especially in the case of an       ex-convict, but society usually determines better—no, not better,       but more strongly. Society had different ideas. It was       Brahministic in its religion. Caste? Yes, once a criminal always       a criminal.        “Old girl,” said the broken man, “it’s no use. I’ve tried to be       decent for your sake and the kid’s, but it can’t be done. I can’t       get honest work. They’ve put the mark of Cain on me. They can       take the consequences. The kid’s got to have some Christmas;       you’ve got to have food and drink and clothes and fire. God, how       cold it is! I’ll go out and get some.”        “Isn’t there something else we can pawn?”        “Nothing.”        “Isn’t there any work?”        “Work?” laughed the man bitterly. “I’ve tramped the city over       seeking it, and you, too. Now, I’m going to get money—elsewhere.”        “Where?”        “Where it’s to be had.”        “Oh, Jack, think.”        “If I thought, I’d kill you and the kid and myself.”        “Perhaps that would be better,” said the woman simply. “There       doesn’t seem to be any place left for us.”        “We haven’t come to that yet,” said the man. “Society owes me a       living and, by God, it’s got to pay it to me.”        It was an oft-repeated, widely held assertion, whether fallacious       or not each may determine for himself.        “I’m afraid,” said the woman.        “You needn’t be; nothing can be worse than this hell.”        He kissed her fiercely. Albeit she was thin and haggard she was       beautiful to him. Then he bent over his little girl. He had not       yet had sufficient time since his release to get very well       acquainted with her. She had been born while he was in prison,       but it had not taken any time at all for him to learn to love       her. He stared at her a moment. He bent to kiss her and then       stopped. He might awaken her. It is always best for the children       of the very poor to sleep. He who sleeps dines, runs the Spanish       proverb. He turned and kissed the little ragged stockings       instead, and then he went out. He was going to play—was it Santa       Claus, indeed?         IV        The strange, illogical, ironical god of chance, or was it       Providence acting through some careless maid, had left an area       window unlocked in the biggest and newest house on the avenue.       Any house would have been easy for “Crackerjack” if he had       possessed the open sesame of his kit of burglar’s tools, but he       had not had a jimmy in his hand since he was caught with one and       sent to Sing Sing. He had examined house after house, trusting to       luck as he wandered on, and, lo! fortune favoured him.        The clock in a nearby church struck the hour of two. The areaway       was dark. No one was abroad. He plunged down the steps, opened       the window and disappeared. No man could move more noiselessly       than he. In the still night he knew how the slightest sounds are       magnified. He had made none as he groped his way through the back       of the house, arriving at last in a room which he judged to be       the library. Then, after listening and hearing nothing, he       ventured to turn the button of a side light in a far corner of       the room.        He was in a large apartment, beautifully furnished. Books and       pictures abounded, but these did not interest him, although if he       had made further examination he might have found things worthy of       his attention even there. It so happened that the light bracket       to which he had blundered, or had been led, was immediately over       a large wall safe. Evidently it had been placed there for the       purpose of illuminating the safe door. His eyes told him that       instantly. This was greater fortune than he expected. A wall safe       in a house like that must contain things of value.        Marking the position of the combination knob, he turned out the       light and waited again. The quiet of the night continued       unbroken. A swift inspection convinced him that the lock was only       an ordinary combination. With proper—or improper—tools he could       have opened it easily. Even without tools, such were his       delicately trained ear and his wonderfully trained fingers that       he thought he could feel and hear the combination. He knelt down       by the knob and began to turn it slowly, listening and feeling       for the fall of the tumblers. Several times he almost got it,       only to fail at the end, but by repeated trials and unexampled       patience, his heart beating like a trip-hammer the while, he       finally mastered the combination and opened the safe door.        In his excitement when he felt the door move he swung it outward       sharply. It had not been used for some time evidently and the       hinges creaked. He checked the door and listened again. Was he to       be balked after so much success? He was greatly relieved at the       absence of sound. It was quite dark in the room. He could see       nothing but the safe. He reached his hand in and discovered it       was filled with bulky articles covered with some kind of cloth,       silver evidently.        He decided that he must have a look and again he switched on the       light. Yes, his surmise had been correct. The safe was filled       with silver. There was a small steel drawer in the middle of it.       He had a broad bladed jack-knife in his pocket and at the risk of       snapping the blade he forced the lock and drew out the drawer. It       was filled with papers. He lifted the first one and stood staring       at it in astonishment, for it was an envelope which bore his       name, written by a hand which had long since mouldered away in       the dust of a grave.         V        Before he could open the envelope, there broke on his ear a still       small voice, not that of conscience, not that of God; the voice       of a child—but does not God speak perhaps as often through the       lips of childhood as in any other way—and conscience, too?        “Are you Santa Claus?” the voice whispered in his ear.        “Crackerjack” dropped the paper and turned like a flash, knife       upraised in his clenched hand, to confront a very little girl and       a still smaller boy staring at him in open-eyed astonishment, an       astonishment which was without any vestige of alarm. He looked       down at the two and they looked up at him, equal bewilderment on       both sides.        “I sought dat Santy Claus tame down de chimney,” said the younger       of the twain, whose pajamas bespoke the nascent man.        “In all the books he has a long white beard. Where’s yours?”       asked the coming woman.        This innocent question no less than the unaffected simplicity and       sincerity of the questioner overpowered “Crackerjack.” He sank       back into a convenient chair and stared at the imperturbable       pair. There was a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15343"],["title","A Little Book for Christmas (#4)"],["body","and wonderful likeness in the       sweet-faced golden-haired little girl before him to the worn,       haggard, and ill-clad little girl who lay shivering in the mean       bed in the upper room where God was not—or so he fancied.        “You’re a little girl, aren’t you?” he whispered.        No voice had been or was raised above a whisper. It was a       witching hour and its spell was upon them all.        “Yes.”        “What is your name?”        “Helen.”        Now Helen had been “Crackerjack’s” mother’s name and it was the       name of his own little girl, and although everybody else called       her Nell, to him she was always Helen.        “And my name’s John,” volunteered the other child.        “John!” That was extraordinary!        “What’s your other name?”        “John William.”        The man stared again. Could this be coincidence merely? John was       his own name and William that of his brother.        “I mean what is your last name?”        “Carstairs,” answered the little girl. “Now you tell us who you       are. You aren’t Santa Claus, are you? I don’t hear any reindeers       outside, or bells, and you haven’t any pack, and you’re not by       the fireplace where our stockings are.”  [Illustration: I sought dat Santy Claus tame down de chimney,” said the younger of the twain.] “I sought dat Santy Claus tame down de chimney,” said the younger of the twain.        “No,” said the man, “I’m not exactly Santa Claus, I’m his       friend—I—”        What should he say to these children? In his bewilderment for the       moment he actually forgot the letter which he still held tightly       in his hand.        “Dat’s muvver’s safe,” continued the little boy. “She keeps lots       o’ things in it. It’s all hers but dat drawer. Dat’s papa’s and—”        “I think I hear some one on the stairs,” broke in the little girl       suddenly in great excitement. “Maybe that’s Santa Claus.”        “Perhaps it is,” said the man, who had also heard. “You wait and       watch for him. I’ll go outside and attend to his reindeer.”        He made a movement to withdraw, but the girl caught him tightly       by the hand.        “If you are his friend,” she said, “you can introduce us. You       know our names and—”        The golden opportunity was gone.        “Don’t say a word,” whispered the man quickly. “We’ll surprise       him. Be very still.”        He reached his hand up and turned out the light. He half hoped he       might be mistaken, or that in the darkness they would not be       seen, but no. They all heard the footsteps on the stair. They       came down slowly, and it was evident that whoever was approaching       was using every precaution not to be heard. “Crackerjack” was in       a frightful situation. He did not know whether to jerk himself       away from the two children, for the boy had clasped him around       the leg and the girl still held his hand, or whether to wait.        The power of decision suddenly left him, for the steps stopped       before the door. There was a little click as a hand pressed a       button on the wall and the whole room was flooded with light from       the great electrolier in the centre. Well, the game was up.       “Crackerjack” had been crouching low with the children. He rose       to his feet and looked straightly enough into the barrel of a       pistol held by a tall, severe looking man in a rich silk dressing       robe, who confronted him in the doorway. Two words broke from the       lips of the two men, the same words that had fallen from their       lips when they met ten years before.        “John!” cried the elder man, laying the weapon on a nearby table.        “Will!” answered “Crackerjack” in the same breath.        As if to mark the eternal difference as before, the one was       clothed in habiliments of wealth and luxury, the other in the       rags and tatters of poverty and shame.        “Why, that isn’t Santa Claus,” instantly burst out the little       girl, “that’s papa.”        “Dis is Santy Claus’s friend, papa,” said the little boy. “We       were doin’ to su’prise him. He said be very still and we minded.”        “So this is what you have come to, John,” said the elder man, but       there was an unwonted gentleness in his voice.        “I swear to God I didn’t know it was your house. I just came in       here because the window was open.”        The other pointed to the safe.        “But you were—”        “Of course I was. You don’t suppose I wandered in for fun, do       you? I’ve got a little girl of my own, and her name’s Helen, too;       our mother’s name.”        The other brother nodded.        “She’s hungry and cold and there’s no Christmas for her or her       mother.”        “Oh, Santy has been here already,” cried Master John Williams,       running toward the great fireplace, having just that moment       discovered the bulging stockings and piles of gifts. His sister       made a move in the same direction, for at the other corner hung       her stocking and beneath it her pile, but the man’s hand       unconsciously tightened upon her hand and she stopped.        “I’ll stay with you,” she said, after a moment of hesitation.       “Tell me more about your Helen.”        “There’s nothing to tell.” He released her hand roughly. “You       musn’t touch me,” he added harshly. “Go.”        “You needn’t go, my dear,” said her father quickly. “Indeed, I       think, perhaps—”        “Is your Helen very poor?” quietly asked the little girl,       possessing herself of his hand again, “because if she is she can       have”—she looked over at the pile of toys—“Well, I’ll see. I’ll       give her lots of things, and—”        “What’s this?” broke out the younger man harshly, extending his       hand with the letter in it toward the other.        “It is a letter to you from our father.”        “And you kept it from me?” cried the other.        “Read it,” said William Carstairs.        With trembling hands “Crackerjack” tore it open. It was a message       of love and forgiveness penned by a dying hand.        “If I had had this then I might have been a different man,” said       the poor wretch.        “There is another paper under it, or there should be, in the same       drawer,” went on William Carstairs, imperturbably. “Perhaps you       would better read that.”        John Carstairs needed no second invitation. He turned to the open       drawer and took out the next paper. It was a copy of a will. The       farm and business had been left to William, but one half of it       was to be held in trust for his brother. The man read it and then       he crushed the paper in his hand.        “And that, too, might have saved me. My God!” he cried, “I’ve       been a drunken blackguard. I’ve gone down to the very depths. I       have been in State’s prison. I was, I am, a thief, but I never       would have withheld a dying man’s forgiveness from his son. I       never would have kept a poor wretch who was crazy with shame and       who drank himself into crime out of his share of the property.”        Animated by a certain fell purpose, he leaped across the room and       seized the pistol.        “Yes, and I have you now!” he cried. “I’ll make you pay.”        He levelled the weapon at his brother with a steady hand.        “What are you doin’ to do wif that pistol?” said young John       William, curiously looking up from his stocking, while Helen       cried out. The little woman acted the better part. With rare       intuition she came quickly and took the left hand of the man and       patted it gently. For one thing, her father was not afraid, and       that reassured her. John Carstairs threw the pistol down again.       William Carstairs had never moved.        “Now,” he said, “let me explain.”        “Can you explain away this?”        “I can. Father’s will was not opened until the day after you       left. As God is my judge I did not know he had written to you. I       did not know he had left anything to you. I left no stone       unturned in an endeavour to find you. I employed the best       detectives in the land, but we found no trace of you whatever.       Why, John, I have only been sorry once that I let you go that       night, that I spoke those words to you, and that has been all the       time.”        “And where does this come from?” said the man, flinging his arm       up and confronting the magnificent room.        “It came from the old farm. There was oil on it and I sold it for       a great price. I was happily married. I came here and have been       successful in business. Half of it all is yours.”        “I won’t take it.”        “John,” said William Carstairs, “I offered you money once and you       struck it out of my hand. You remember?”        “Yes.”        “What I am offering you now is your own. You can’t strike it out       of my hand. It is not mine, but yours.”        “I won’t have it,” protested the man. “It’s too late. You don’t       know what I’ve been, a common thief. ‘Crackerjack’ is my name.       Every policeman and detective in New York knows me.”        “But you’ve got a little Helen, too, haven’t you?” interposed the       little girl with wisdom and tact beyond her years.        “Yes.”        “And you said she was very poor and had no Christmas.”        “Yes.”        “For her sake, John,” said William Carstairs. “Indeed you must       not think you have been punished alone. I have been punished,       too. I’ll help you begin again. Here”—he stepped closer to his       brother—“is my hand.”        The other stared at it uncomprehendingly.        “There is nothing in it now but affection. Won’t you take it?”        Slowly John Carstairs lifted his hand. His palm met that of his       elder brother. He was so hungry and so weak and so overcome that       he swayed a little. His head bowed, his body shook and the elder       brother put his arm around him and drew him close.     "]]]
