It would be well also to introduce dishes that extend the meat flavor, such as stews combined with dumplings, hominy, or rice; pot pies or short cakes with a dressing of meat and vegetables; meat loaf, souffle or croquettes in which meat is combined with bread crumbs, potato or rice.  Meat eating is largely a matter of flavor. If flavor is supplied, the reduction of meat in the diet can be made with little annoyance. Nutrition can always be supplied in the other dishes that accompany the meal, as a certain proportion of protein is found in almost every food product. The meat that we use to obtain flavor in sauces and gravies need not be large in quantity, nor expensive in cut. The poor or cheap cuts have generally more flavor than the expensive ones, the difference being entirely in texture and tenderness, freedom from gristle and inedible tissue. There are many cereals, such as rice, hominy, cornmeal, samp and many vegetable dishes, especially dried beans of all kinds, that are greatly improved by the addition of meat sauce and when prepared in this way may be served as the main dish of a meal.  Dr. Harvey W. Wiley has stated that the meat eating of the future will not be regarded as a necessity so much as it has been in the past, and that meat will be used more as a condimental substance. Europe has for years used meat for flavor rather than for nutriment. It would seem that the time has come for Americans to learn the use of meat for flavor and to utilize more skillfully the protein of other foods.  It may be difficult to convince the meat lover that he can radically reduce the proportion of meat in his diet without detriment to health. Many persons adhere to the notion that you are not nourished unless you eat meat; that meat foods are absolutely necessary to maintain the body strength. This idea is entirely without foundation, for the foods mentioned as meat substitutes earlier in this chapter can be made to feed the world, and feed it well--in fact, no nation uses so large a proportion of meat as America.  The first step, therefore, in preparing ourselves to reduce meat consumption is to recognize that only a small quantity of meat is necessary to supply sufficient protein for adult life. The growing child or the youth springing into manhood needs a larger percentage of meat than the adult, and in apportioning the family's meat ration this fact should not be overlooked.  The second step is to reduce the amount purchased, choosing cuts that contain the least waste, and by utilizing with care that which we do purchase. Fat, trimmings, and bones all have their uses and should be saved from the garbage pail.  Careful buying, of course, depends on a knowledge of cuts, a study of the percentage of waste in each cut, and the food value of the different kinds of meat. Make a study of the different cuts, as shown in the charts on pages 36, 37, and armed with this knowledge go forth to the butcher for practical buying.  Then comes the cooking, which can only be properly done when the fundamental principles of the cooking processes, such as boiling, braising, broiling, stewing, roasting and frying are understood. Each cut requires different handling to secure the maximum amount of nutriment and flavor. The waste occasioned by improper cooking is a large factor in both household and national economy.  It has been estimated that a waste of an ounce each day of edible meat or fat in the twenty million American homes amounts to 456,000,000 pounds of valuable animal food a year. At average dressed weights, this amounts to 875,000 steers, or over 3,000,000 hogs. Each housekeeper, therefore, who saves her ounce a day aids in this enormous saving, which will mean so much in the feeding of our men on the fighting line.  So the housekeeper who goes to her task of training the family palate to accept meat substitutes and meat economy dishes, who revolutionizes her methods of cooking so as to utilize even \"the pig's squeak,\" will be doing her bit toward making the world safe for democracy.  The following charts, tables of nutritive values and suggested menus have been arranged to help her do this work. The American woman has her share in this great world struggle, and that is the intelligent conservation of food.   SELECTION OF MEAT  BEEF--Dull red as cut, brighter after exposure to air; lean, well mottled with fat; flesh, firm; fat, yellowish in color. Best beef from animal 3 to 5 years old, weighing 900 to 1,200 pounds. Do not buy wet, soft, or pink beef.  VEAL--Flesh pink. (If white, calf was bled before killed or animal too young.) The fat should be white.  MUTTON--Best from animal 3 years old. Flesh dull red, fat firm and white.  LAMB--(Spring Lamb 3 months to 6 months old; season, February to March.) Bones of lamb should be small; end of bone in leg of lamb should be serrated; flesh pink, and fat white.  PORK--The lean should be fine grained and pale pink. The skin should be smooth and clear. If flesh is soft, or fat yellowish, pork is not good.   SELECTION OF TOUGHER CUTS AND THEIR USES  Less expensive cuts of meat have more nourishment than the more expensive, and if properly cooked and seasoned, have as much tenderness. Tough cuts, as chuck or top sirloin, may be boned and rolled and then roasted by the same method as tender cuts, the only difference will be that the tougher cuts require longer cooking. Have the bones from rolled meats sent home to use for soups. Corned beef may be selected from flank, naval, plate or brisket. These cuts are more juicy than rump or round cuts.  1. _For pot roast_ use chuck, crossrib, round, shoulder, rump or top sirloin.  2. _For stew_ use shin, shoulder, top sirloin or neck.  3. _For steaks_ use flank, round or chuck. If these cuts are pounded, or both pounded and rubbed with a mixture of 1 part vinegar and 2 parts oil before cooking, they will be very tender.  4. _Soups_--Buy shin or neck. The meat from these may be utilized by serving with horseradish or mustard sauce, or combined with equal amount of fresh meat for meat loaf, scalloped dish, etc.   DRY METHODS  1. _Roasting or Baking_--Oven roasting or baking is applied to roasts.  Place the roast in a hot oven, or if gas is used, put in the broiling oven to sear the outside quickly, and thus keep in the juices. Salt, pepper and flour. If an open roasting pan is used place a few tablespoonfuls of fat and 1 cup of water in the pan, which should be used to baste the roast frequently. If a covered pan is used basting is unnecessary.    Beef or mutton   (5 to 8 lbs.)  10 min. to the lb.  10 min. extra   Lamb             (5 to 8 lbs.)  12 min. to the lb.  12 min. extra   Veal             (5 to 8 lbs.)  15 min. to the lb.  15 min. extra   Pork             (5 to 8 lbs.)  25 min. to the lb.  25 min. extra   Turkey                          20 min. to the lb.   Chicken                         30 min. to the lb.   Duck                            30 min. to the lb.   Goose                           30 min. to the lb.   Game                            30 min. to the lb.  2. _Broiling_--Cooking over or under clear fire. This method is used for chops or steaks.  Sear the meat on both sides. Then reduce the heat and turn the meat frequently. Use no fat.    _Time Table_--(Count time after meat is seared).                 1/2 inch chops or steaks, 5 minutes                   1 inch chops or steaks, 10 minutes                   2 inch chops or steaks, 15 to 18 minutes  3. _Pan Broiling_--Cooking in pan with no fat. _Time table same as for broiling_ chops, steaks, etc.  4. _Sautéing_--Cooking in pan in small amount of fat. Commonly termed \"frying.\" Used for steaks, chops, etc. _Time table same as for broiling._   MOIST METHODS  1. Boiling--Cooking in boiling water--especially poultry, salt meats, etc.  2. Steaming--A method of cooking by utilizing steam from boiling water, which retains more food value than any other. Too seldom applied to meats.  3. Frying--Cooking by immersion in hot fat at temperature 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Used for croquettes, etc.  If a fat thermometer is not available, test by using small pieces of bread. Put into heated fat:  A--For croquettes made from food requiring little cooking, such as oysters, or from previously cooked mixtures, as rice, fish or meat croquettes, bread should brown in one-half minute.  B--For mixtures requiring cooking, as doughnuts, fritters, etc., bread should brown in one minute.   COMBINATION METHODS  1. Pot Roasting--Cooking (by use of steam from small amount of water) tough cuts of meat which have been browned but not cooked thoroughly.  Season meat. Dredge with flour. Sear in hot pan until well browned. Place oil rack in pot containing water to height of one inch, but do not let water reach the meat. Keep water slowly boiling. Replenish as needed with boiling water. This method renders tough cuts tender, but requires several hours cooking.  2. Stewing--A combination of methods which draws part of flavor into gravy and retains part in pieces which are to be used as meat.  Cut meat into pieces suitable for serving. Cover one-half of meat with cold water. Let stand one hour. Bring slowly to boiling point. Dredge other half of meat with flour and brown in small amount of fat. Add to the other mixture and cook slowly 1-1/2 to 2 hours, or until tender, adding diced vegetables, thickening and seasoning as desired one-half hour before cooking is finished.  3. Fricasseeing--Cooking in a sauce until tender, meat which has been previously browned but not cooked throughout.  Brown meat in small amount of fat. Place in boiling water to cover. Cook slowly until tender. To 1 pint of water in which meat is cooked, add 1/4 cup flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, and 1/4 cup milk, thoroughly blended. When at boiling point, add one beaten egg, 1 tablespoon chopped parsley and 1 tablespoon cold water well mixed, Add cooked meat and serve.

Study and know what the actual needs are, and you will not make unnecessary expenditures.  Learn what the various cuts of meat are, what they can be used for, and which are best suited to the particular needs of your household.  Study the timeliness of buying certain cuts of meats. There are days when prices are lower than normal.  Always check the butcher's weights by watching him closely or by weighing the goods on scales of your own.  Always buy a definite quantity. Ask what the pound rate is, and note any fractional part of the weight. Don't ask for \"ten or twenty cents' worth.\"  Select your meat or fish personally. There is no doubt that high retail prices are due to the tendency of many housewives to do their buying by telephone or through their servants.  Test the freshness of meat and fish. Staleness of meat and fish is shown by loose and flabby flesh. The gills of fresh fish are red and the fins stiff.  Make all the purchases possible at a public market, if you can walk to it, or if carfare will not make too large an increase in the amount you have set aside for the day's buying.  A food chopper can be made to pay for itself in a short time by the great variety of ways it furnishes of utilizing left-overs.  If possible, buy meat trimmings. They cost 20 cents a pound and can be used in many ways.  Buy the ends of bacon strips. They are just as nutritious as sliced bacon and cost 50 per cent. less.  Learn to use drippings in place of butter for cooking purposes.  Buy cracked eggs. They cost much less than whole ones and are usually just as good.  Keep a stock pot. Drop into it all left-overs. These make an excellent basis for soup stock.  Don't throw away the heads and bones of fish. Clean them and use them with vegetables for fish chowder or cream of fish soup.  Study attractive ways of serving food. Plain, cheap, dishes can be made appetizing if they look attractive on the table.  Experiment with meat substitutes. Cheese, dried vegetables and the cheaper varieties of fish can supply all the nutriment of meat at a much lower cost.  Don't do your cooking \"by guess.\" If the various ingredients are measured accurately, the dish will taste better and cost less.  Don't buy delicatessen food if you can possibly avoid it. Delicatessen meals cost 15 per cent. more than the same meals cooked at home, and the food is not as nourishing. You pay for the cooking and the rent of the delicatessen store, as well as the proprietor's profit.  Don't pay five or ten cents more a dozen for white eggs in the belief that they are superior to brown eggs. The food value of each is the same. The difference in shell color is due to the breed of hen.  Tell the butcher to give you the trimmings of chicken, i.e., the head, feet, fat and giblets. They make delicious chicken soup. The feet contain gelatine, which gives soup consistency.  Buy a tough, and consequently less expensive, chicken and make it tender by steaming it for three hours before roasting.  Don't put meat wrapped in paper into the ice-box, as the paper tends to absorb the juices.  Try to find a way to buy at least a part of your meats and eggs direct from the farm. You will get fresher, better food, and if it is sent by parcels post it can usually be delivered to your table for much less than city prices.   MEAT ECONOMY DISHES   MOCK DUCK    1 flank steak   1 teaspoon salt   1 teaspoon pepper   1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce   1 cup breadcrumbs   1 tablespoon onion juice   1 tablespoon chopped parsley   1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning   1 pint boiling water   1/3 cup of whole wheat flour  Reserve the water and the flour. Mix other ingredients. Spread on steak. Roll the steak and tie. Roll in the flour. Brown in two tablespoons of fat. Add the water--cover and cook until tender.   BEEF STEW    1 lb. of meat from the neck, cross ribs, shin or knuckles   1 sliced onion   3/4 cup carrots   1/2 cup turnips   1 cup potatoes   1 teaspoon salt   1/4 teaspoon pepper   1/2 cup flour   1 quart water  Soak one-half of the meat, cut in small pieces, in the quart of water for one hour. Heat slowly to boiling point. Season the other half of the meat with salt and pepper. Roll in flour. Brown in three tablespoons of fat with the onion. Add to the soaked meat, which has been brought to the boiling point. Cook one hour or until tender. Add the vegetables, and flour mixed with half cup of cold water. Cook until vegetables are tender.   HAM SOUFFLE    1-1/2 cups breadcrumbs   2 cups scalded milk   1-1/2 cups chopped cooked ham   2 egg yolks   1 tablespoon chopped parsley   1 teaspoon minced onion   1/2 teaspoon paprika   2 egg whites   PARSLEY SAUCE    2 tablespoons butter   3 tablespoons flour   1 cup milk   1/2 teaspoon salt   2 tablespoons chopped parsley  For the soufflé, cook together breadcrumbs and milk for two minutes. Remove from fire, add ham and mix well. Add egg yolks, first beating these well; also the parsley (one tablespoon), onion and paprika. Fold in, last of all, the egg whites whipped to a stiff, dry froth. Turn quickly into a well-greased baking dish and bake in moderate oven for thirty-five minutes, or until firm to the touch; meantime, make the parsley sauce, so that both can be served instantly when the soufflé is done; then it will not fall and grow tough.  For the parsley sauce, melt the butter in saucepan and stir in the flour, stirring until perfectly smooth, then add the milk slowly, stirring constantly; cook until thick, stir in the parsley and salt, and serve at once in a gravy boat.   BATTLE PUDDING  BATTER    1 cup flour   1/2 cup milk   2 teaspoons baking powder   1 egg   4 tablespoons water   1/2 teaspoon salt  FILLING    2 cups coarsely chopped cold cooked meat   1 tablespoon drippings   1 medium-sized potato   1 cup stock or hot water   salt and pepper   1 small onion  Any cold meat may be used for this. Cut it into inch pieces. Slice the onion and potato and fry in drippings until onion is slightly browned. Add the meat and stock, or hot water, or dissolve in hot water any left-over meat gravy. Cook all together until potato is soft, but not crumbled; season with the pepper and salt. Thicken with a tablespoon of flour and turn into a pudding dish.  Make a batter by sifting together flour, baking-powder and salt; stir in the egg and milk, mixed with the water. Beat hard until free from lumps, then pour over meat and vegetables in the pudding and bake"]]]
