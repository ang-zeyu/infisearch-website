She was worried. There was no doubt about it. Little Mrs. Peter was very much worried. Why didn't Peter come home? She did wish that he would be content to stay close by the dear Old Briar-patch. For her part, she couldn't see why under the sun he wanted to go way over to the Green Forest. He was always having dreadful adventures and narrow escapes over there, and yet, in spite of all she could say, he would persist in going there. She didn't feel easy in her mind one minute while he was out of her sight. To be sure he always turned up all right, but she couldn't help feeling that sometime his dreadful curiosity would get him into trouble that he couldn't get out of, and so every time he went to the Green Forest, she was sure, absolutely sure, that she would never see him again.  Peter used to laugh at her and tell her that she was a foolish little dear, and that he was perfectly able to take care of himself. Then, when he saw how worried she was, he would promise to be very, very careful and never do anything rash or foolish. But he wouldn't promise not to go to the Green Forest. No, Sir, Peter wouldn't promise that. You see, he has so many friends over there, and there is always so much news to be gathered that he just couldn't keep away. Once or twice he had induced Mrs. Peter to go with him, but she had been frightened almost out of her skin every minute, for it seemed to her that there was danger lurking behind every tree and under every bush. It was all very well for Chatterer the Red Squirrel and Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, who could jump from tree to tree, but she didn't think it a safe and proper place for a sensible Rabbit, and she said so.  This particular morning she was unusually anxious. Peter had been gone all night. Usually he was home by the time Old Mother West Wind came down from the Purple Hills and emptied her children, the Merry Little Breezes, out of her big bag to play all day on the Green Meadows, but this morning Old Mother West Wind had been a long time gone about her business, and still there was no sign of Peter.  \"Something has happened. I just know something has happened!\" she wailed.      \"Oh, Peter, Peter, Peter Rabbit       Why will you be so heedless?     Why will you take such dreadful risks,       So foolish and so needless?\"  \"Don't worry. Peter is smart enough to take care of himself,\" cried one of the Merry Little Breezes, who happened along just in time to overhear her. \"He'll be home pretty soon. In fact, I think I see him coming now.\"  Mrs. Peter looked in the direction that the Merry Little Breeze was looking, and sure enough there was Peter. He was heading straight for the dear Old Briar-patch, and he was running as if he were trying to show how fast he could run. Mrs. Peter's heart gave a frightened thump. \"It must be that Reddy or Granny Fox or Old Man Coyote is right at his heels,\" thought she, but look as hard as she would, she could see nothing to make Peter run so.  In a few minutes he reached her side. His eyes were very wide, and it was plain to see that he was bursting with important news.  \"What is it, Peter? Do tell me quick! Have you had another narrow escape?\" gasped little Mrs. Peter.  Peter nodded while he panted for breath. \"There's another stranger in the Green Forest, a terrible looking fellow without legs or head or tail, and he almost caught me!\" panted Peter.     V  PETER RABBIT TELLS HIS STORY   When Peter Rabbit could get his breath after his long hard run from the Green Forest to the dear Old Briar-patch, he had a wonderful story to tell. It was all about a stranger in the Green Forest, and to have heard Peter tell about it, you would have thought, as Mrs. Peter did, that it was a very terrible stranger, for it had no legs, and it had no head, and it had no tail. At least, that is what Peter said.  \"You see, it was this way,\" declared Peter. \"I had stopped longer than I meant to in the Green Forest, for you know, my dear, I always try to be home by the time jolly, round, red Mr. Sun gets out of bed and Old Mother West Wind gets down on the Green Meadows.\" Mrs. Peter nodded. \"But somehow time slipped away faster than I thought for, or else Mr. Sun got up earlier than usual,\" continued Peter. Then he stopped. That last idea was a new one, and it struck Peter as a good one. \"I do believe that that is just what happened--Mr. Sun must have made a mistake and crawled out of bed earlier than usual,\" he cried.  Mrs. Peter looked as if she very much doubted it, but she didn't say anything, and so Peter went on with his story.  \"I had just realized how light it was and had started for home, hurrying with all my might, when I heard a little noise at the top of the hill where Prickly Porky the Porcupine lives. Of course I thought it was Prickly himself starting out for his breakfast, and I looked up with my mouth open to say hello. But I didn't say hello. No, Sir, I didn't say a word. I was too scared. There, just starting down the hill straight towards me, was the most dreadful creature that ever has been seen in the Green Forest! It didn't have any legs, and it didn't have any head, and it didn't have any tail, and it was coming straight after me so fast that I had all I could do to get out of the way!\" Peter's eyes grew very round and wide as he said this. \"I took one good look, and then I jumped. My gracious, how I did jump!\" he continued. \"Then I started for home just as fast as ever I could make my legs go, and here I am, and mighty glad to be here!\"  Mrs. Peter had listened with her mouth wide open. When Peter finished, she closed it with a snap and hopped over and felt of his head.  \"Are you sick, Peter?\" she asked anxiously.  Peter stared at her. \"Sick! Me sick! Not a bit of it!\" he exclaimed. \"Never felt better in my life, save that I am a little tired from my long run. What a silly question! Do I look sick?\"  \"No-o,\" replied little Mrs. Peter slowly. \"No-o, you don't look sick, but you talk as if there were something the matter with your head. I think you must be just a little light-headed, Peter, or else you have taken a nap somewhere and had a bad dream. Did I understand you to say that this dreadful creature has no legs, and yet that it chased you?\"  \"That's what I said!\" snapped Peter a wee bit crossly, for he saw that Mrs. Peter didn't believe a word of his story.  \"Will you please tell me how any creature in the Green Forest or out of it, for that matter, can possibly chase any one unless it has legs or wings, and you didn't say anything about its having wings,\" demanded Mrs. Peter.  Peter scratched his head in great perplexity. Suddenly he had a happy thought. \"Mr. Blacksnake runs fast enough, but he doesn't have legs, does he?\" he asked in triumph.  Little Mrs. Peter looked a bit discomfited. \"No-o,\" she admitted slowly, \"he doesn't have legs; but I never could understand how he runs without them.\"  \"Well, then,\" snapped Peter, \"if he can run without legs, why can't other creatures? Besides, this one didn't run exactly; it rolled. Now I've told you all I'm going to. I need a long nap, after all I've been through, so don't let any one disturb me.\"  \"I won't,\" replied Mrs. Peter meekly. \"But, Peter, if I were you, I wouldn't tell that story to any one else.\"     VI  PETER HAS TO TELL HIS STORY MANY TIMES      Once you start a story you cannot call it back;     It travels on and on and on and ever on, alack!   That is the reason why you should always be sure that a story you repeat is a good story. Then you will be glad to have it travel on and on and on, and will never want to call it back. But if you tell a story that isn't true or nice, the time is almost sure to come when you will want to call it back and cannot. You see stories are just like rivers,--they run on and on forever. Little Mrs. Peter Rabbit knew this, and that is why she advised Peter not to tell any one else the strange story he had told her of the dreadful creature without legs or head or tail that had chased him in the Green Forest. Peter knew by that that she didn't believe a word of it, but he was too tired and sleepy to argue with her then, so he settled himself comfortably for a nice long nap.  When Peter awoke, the first thing he thought of was the terrible creature he had seen in the Green Forest. The more he thought about it, the more impossible it seemed, and he didn't wonder that Mrs. Peter had advised him not to repeat it.  \"I won't,\" said Peter to himself. \"I won't repeat it to a soul. No one will believe it. The truth is, I can hardly believe it myself. I'll just keep my tongue still.\"  But unfortunately for Peter, one of the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind had heard Peter tell the story to Mrs. Peter, and it was such a wonderful and curious and unbelievable story that the Merry Little Breeze straightway repeated it to everybody he met, and soon Peter Rabbit began to receive callers who wanted to hear the story all over again from Peter himself. So Peter was obliged to repeat it ever so many times, and every time it sounded to him more foolish than before. He had to tell it to Jimmy Skunk and to Johnny Chuck and to Danny Meadow Mouse and to Digger the Badger and to Sammy Jay and to Blacky the Crow and to Striped Chipmunk and to Happy Jack Squirrel and to Bobby Coon and to Unc' Billy Possum and to Old Mr. Toad.  Now, strange to say, no one laughed at Peter, queer as the story sounded. You see, they all remembered how they had laughed at him and made fun of him when he told about the great footprints he had found deep in the Green Forest, and how later it had been proven that he really did see them, for they were made by Buster Bear who had come down from the Great Woods to live in the Green Forest. Then it had been Peter's turn to laugh at them. So now, impossible as this new story sounded, they didn't dare"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15521"],["title","The Adventures of Prickly Porky (#2)"],["body","at it.  \"I never heard of such a creature,\" said Jimmy Skunk, \"and I can't quite believe that there is such a one, but it is very clear to me that Peter has seen something strange. You know the old saying that he laughs best who laughs last, and I'm not going to give Peter another chance to have the last laugh and say, 'I told you so.'\"  \"That is very true,\" replied Old Mr. Toad solemnly. \"Probably Peter has seen something out of the ordinary, and in his excitement he has exaggerated it. The thing to do is to make sure whether or not there is a stranger in the Green Forest. Peter says that it came down the hill where Prickly Porky the Porcupine lives. Some one ought to go ask him what he knows about it. If there is such a terrible creature up there, he ought to have seen it. Why don't you go up there and ask him, Jimmy Skunk? You're not afraid of anybody or anything.\"  \"I will,\" replied Jimmy promptly, and off he started. You see, he felt very much flattered by Old Mr. Toad's remark, and he couldn't very well refuse, for that would look as if he were afraid, after all.     VII  JIMMY SKUNK CALLS ON PRICKLY PORKY   \"A plague upon Old Mr. Toad!\" grumbled Jimmy, as he ambled up the Lone Little Path through the Green Forest on his way to the hill where Prickly Porky lives. \"Of course I'm not afraid, but just the same I don't like meddling with things I don't know anything about. I'm not afraid of anybody I know of, because everybody has the greatest respect for me, but it might be different with a creature without legs or head or tail. Whoever heard of such a thing? It gives me a queer feeling inside.\"  However, he kept right on, and as he reached the foot of the hill where Prickly Porky lives, he looked sharply in every direction and listened with all his might for strange sounds. But there was nothing unusual to be seen. The Green Forest looked just as it always did. It was very still and quiet there save for the cheerful voice of Redeye the Vireo telling over and over how happy he was.  \"That doesn't sound as if there were any terrible stranger around here,\" muttered Jimmy.  Then he heard a queer, grunting sound, a very queer sound, that seemed to come from somewhere on the top of the hill. Jimmy grinned as he listened. \"That's Prickly Porky telling himself how good his dinner tastes,\" laughed Jimmy. \"Funny how some people do like to hear their own voices.\"  The contented sound of Prickly Porky's voice made Jimmy feel very sure that there could be nothing very terrible about just then, anyway, and so he slowly ambled up the hill, for you know he never hurries. It was an easy matter to find the tree in which Prickly Porky was at work stripping off bark and eating it, because he made so much noise.  \"Hello!\" said Jimmy Skunk.  Prickly Porky took no notice. He was so busy eating, and making so much noise about it, that he didn't hear Jimmy at all.  \"Hello!\" shouted Jimmy a little louder. \"Hello, there! Are you deaf?\" Of course this wasn't polite at all, but Jimmy was feeling a little out of sorts because he had had to make this call. This time Prickly Porky looked down.  \"Hello yourself, and see how you like it, Jimmy Skunk!\" he cried. \"Come on up and have some of this nice bark with me.\" Then Prickly Porky laughed at his own joke, for he knew perfectly well that Jimmy couldn't climb, and that he wouldn't eat bark if he could.  Jimmy made a face at him. \"Thank you, I've just dined. Come down here where I can talk to you without straining my voice,\" he replied.  \"Wait until I get another bite,\" replied Prickly Porky, stripping off a long piece of bark. Then with this to chew on, he came half way down the tree and made himself comfortable on a big limb. \"Now, what is it you've got on your mind?\" he demanded.  At once Jimmy told him the queer story Peter Rabbit had told. \"I've been sent up here to find out if you have seen this legless, headless, tailess creature. Have you?\" he concluded.  Prickly Porky slowly shook his head. \"No,\" said he. \"I've been right here all the time, and I haven't seen any such creature.\"  \"That's all I want to know,\" replied Jimmy. \"Peter Rabbit's got something the matter with his eyes, and I'm going straight back to the Old Briar-patch to tell him so. Much obliged.\" With that Jimmy started back the way he had come, grumbling to himself.     VIII  PRICKLY PORKY NEARLY CHOKES   Hardly was Jimmy Skunk beyond sight and hearing after having made his call than Redeye the Vireo, whose home is in a tree just at the foot of the hill where Prickly Porky lives, heard a very strange noise. He was very busy, was Redeye, telling all who would listen how happy he was and what a beautiful world this is. Redeye seems to think that this is his special mission in life, that he was put in the Green Forest for this one special purpose,--to sing all day long, even in the hottest weather when other birds forget to sing, his little song of gladness and happiness. It never seems to enter his head that he is making other people happy just by being happy himself and saying so.  At first he hardly noticed the strange noise, but when he stopped singing for a bit of a rest, he heard it very plainly, and it sounded so very queer that he flew up the hill towards the place from which it seemed to come, and there his bright eyes soon discovered Prickly Porky. Right away he saw that Prickly Porky was in some kind of trouble, and that it was he who was making the queer noise. Prickly Porky was on the ground at the foot of a tree, and he was rolling over and kicking and clawing at his mouth, from which a little piece of bark was hanging. It was such a strange performance that Redeye simply stared for a minute. Then in a flash it came to him what it meant. Prickly Porky was choking, and if something wasn't done to help him, he might choke to death!  Now there was nothing that Redeye himself could do to help, for he was too small. He must get help somewhere else, and he must do it quickly. Anxiously he looked this way and that way, but there was no one in sight. Then he remembered that Unc' Billy Possum's hollow tree was not far away. Perhaps Unc' Billy could help. He hoped that Unc' Billy was at home, and he wasted no time in finding out. Unc' Billy was at home, and when he heard that his old friend Prickly Porky was in trouble, he hurried up the hill as fast as ever he could. He saw right away what was the trouble.  \"Yo' keep still just a minute, Brer Porky!\" he commanded, for he did not dare go very near while Prickly Porky was rolling and kicking around so, for fear that he would get against some of the thousand little spears Prickly Porky carries hidden in his coat. Prickly Porky did as he was told. Indeed, he was so weak from his long struggle that he was glad to. Unc' Billy caught hold of the piece of bark hanging from Prickly Porky's mouth. Then he braced himself and pulled with all his might. For a minute the piece of bark held. Then it gave way so suddenly that Unc' Billy fell over flat on his back. Unc' Billy scrambled to his feet and looked reprovingly at Prickly Porky, who lay panting for breath, and with big tears rolling down his face.  [Illustration: Then he braced himself and pulled with all his might. _Page 30._]  \"Ah cert'nly am surprised, Brer Porky; Ah cert'nly am surprised that yo' should be so greedy that yo' choke yo'self,\" said Unc' Billy, shaking his head.  Prickly Porky grinned weakly and rather foolishly. \"It wasn't greed, Unc' Billy. It wasn't greed at all,\" he replied.  \"Then what was it, may Ah ask?\" demanded Unc' Billy severely.  \"I thought of something funny right in the middle of my meal, and I laughed just as I started to swallow, and the piece of bark went down the wrong way,\" explained Prickly Porky. And then, as if the mere thought of the thing that had made him laugh before was too much for him, he began to laugh again. He laughed and laughed and laughed, until finally Unc' Billy quite lost patience.  \"Yo' cert'nly have lost your manners, Brer Porky!\" he snapped.  Prickly Porky wiped the tears from his eyes. \"Come closer so that I can whisper, Unc' Billy,\" said he.  A little bit suspiciously Unc' Billy came near enough for Prickly Porky to whisper, and when he had finished, Unc' Billy was wiping tears of laughter from his own eyes.     IX  JIMMY SKUNK AND UNC' BILLY POSSUM TELL DIFFERENT STORIES   The little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest didn't know what to believe. First came Peter Rabbit with the strangest kind of a story about being chased by a terrible creature without legs, head, or tail. He said that it had come down the hill where Prickly Porky the Porcupine lives in the Green Forest. Jimmy Skunk had been sent to call on Prickly Porky and ask him if he had seen any strange creature such as Peter Rabbit had told about. Prickly Porky had said that he hadn't seen any stranger in that part of the Green Forest, and Jimmy had straightway returned to the Green Meadows and told all his friends there that Peter Rabbit must have had something the matter with his eyes or else was crazy, for Prickly Porky hadn't been away from home and yet had seen nothing unusual.  At the same time Unc' Billy Possum was going about in the Green Forest telling everybody whom he met that he had called on Prickly Porky, and that Prickly Porky had told him that Peter Rabbit undoubtedly had seen something strange. Of course Jimmy Skunk's story soon spread through the Green Forest, and Unc' Billy Possum's story soon spread over the Green Meadows, and so nobody knew what to believe or think. If Jimmy Skunk was right, why Peter Rabbit's queer story wasn't to be believed at all. If Unc' Billy was right, why Peter's story wasn't as crazy as it sounded.  Of course all this aroused a great deal of talk and curiosity, and those who had the most courage began to make visits to the hill where Prickly Porky lives to see if they could see for themselves anything out of the ordinary. But they always"]]]
