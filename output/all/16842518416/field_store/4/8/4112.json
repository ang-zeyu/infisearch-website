No idea other than that they had been \"kidnapped\" from their mother ever entered their minds; nor had they any knowledge of the State from whence they supposed they had been taken, the last names of their mother and father, or where they were born. On the other hand, the mother was aware that the safety of herself and her rescued children depended on keeping the whole transaction a strict family secret. During the forty years of separation, except two or three Quaker friends, including the devoted friend of the slave, Benjamin Lundy, it is doubtful whether any other individuals were let into the secret of her slave life. And when the account given of Peter's return, etc., was published in 1850, it led some of the family to apprehend serious danger from the partial revelation of the early condition of the mother, especially as it was about the time that the Fugitive Slave law was passed.  Hence, the author of \"The Kidnapped and the Ransomed\" was compelled to omit these dangerous facts, and had to confine herself strictly to the \"personal recollections of Peter Still\" with regard to his being \"kidnapped.\" Likewise, in the sketch of Seth Concklin's eventful life, written by Dr. W.H. Furness, for similar reasons he felt obliged to make but bare reference to his wonderful agency in relation to Peter's family, although he was fully aware of all the facts in the case.    UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD LETTERS.   Here are introduced a few out of a very large number of interesting letters, designed for other parts of the book as occasion may require. All letters will be given precisely as they were written by their respective authors, so that there may be no apparent room for charging the writer with partial colorings in any instance. Indeed, the originals, however ungrammatically written or erroneously spelt, in their native simplicity possess such beauty and force as corrections and additions could not possibly enhance--    LETTER FROM THOMAS GARRETT (U.G.R.R. DEPOT).   WILMINGTON, 3mo. 23d, 1856.  DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--Since I wrote thee this morning informing thee of the safe arrival of the Eight from Norfolk, Harry Craige has informed me, that he has a man from Delaware that he proposes to take along, who arrived since noon. He will take the man, woman and two children from here with him, and the four men will get in at Marcus Hook. Thee may take Harry Craige by the hand as a brother, true to the cause; he is one of our most efficient aids on the Rail Road, and worthy of full confidence. May they all be favored to get on safe. The woman and three children are no common stock. I assure thee finer specimens of humanity are seldom met with. I hope herself and children may be enabled to find her husband, who has been absent some years, and the rest of their days be happy together.  I am, as ever, thy friend,  THOS. GARRETT.    LETTER FROM MISS G.A. LEWIS (U.G.R.R. DEPOT).   KIMBERTON, October 28th, 1855.  ESTEEMED FRIEND;--This evening a company of eleven friends reached here, having left their homes on the night of the 26th inst. They came into Wilmington, about ten o'clock on the morning of the 27th, and left there, in the town, their two carriages, drawn by two horses. They went to Thomas Garrett's by open day-light and from thence were sent hastily onward for fear of pursuit. They reached Longwood meeting-house in the evening, at which place a Fair Circle had convened, and stayed a while in the meeting, then, after remaining all night with one of the Kennet friends, they were brought to Downingtown early in the morning, and from thence, by daylight, to within a short distance of this place.  They come from New Chestertown, within five miles of the place from which the nine lately forwarded came, and left behind them a colored woman who knew of their intended flight and of their intention of passing through Wilmington and leaving their horses and carriages there.  I have been thus particular in my statement, because the case seems to us one of unusual danger. We have separated the company for the present, sending a mother and five children, two of them quite small, in one direction, and a husband and wife and three lads in another, until I could write to you and get advice if you have any to give, as to the best method of forwarding them, and assistance pecuniarily, in getting them to Canada. The mother and children we have sent off of the usual route, and to a place where I do not think they can remain many days.  We shall await hearing from you. H. Kimber will be in the city on third day, the 30th, and any thing left at 408 Green Street directed to his care, will meet with prompt attention.  Please give me again the direction of Hiram Wilson and the friend in Elmira, Mr. Jones, I think. If you have heard from any of the nine since their safe arrival, please let us know when you write.  Very Respectfully,  G.A. LEWIS.  _2d day morning, 29th_.--The person who took the husband and wife and three lads to E.F. Pennypecker, and Peart, has returned and reports that L. Peart sent three on to Norristown. We fear that there they will fall into the hands of an ignorant colored man Daniel Ross, and that he may not understand the necessity of caution. Will you please write to some careful person there? The woman and children detained in this neighborhood are a very helpless set. Our plan was to assist them as much as possible, and when we get things into the proper train for sending them on, to get the assistance of the husband and wife, who have no children, but are uncle and aunt to the woman with five, in taking with them one of the younger children, leaving fewer for the mother. Of the lads, or young men, there is also one whom we thought capable of accompanying one of the older girls--one to whom he is paying attention, they told us. Would it not be the best way to get those in Norristown under your own care? It seems to me their being sent on could then be better arranged. This, however, is only a suggestion,  Hastily yours,  G.A. LEWIS.    LETTER FROM E.L. STEVENS, ESQ. _(The reader will interpret for himself_.)   WASHINGTON, D.C., July 11th, 1858.  MY DEAR SIR:--Susan Bell left here yesterday with the child of her relative, and since leaving I have thought, perhaps, you had not the address of the gentleman in Syracuse where the child is to be taken for medical treatment, etc. His name is Dr. H.B. Wilbur. A woman living with him is a most excellent nurse and will take a deep interest in the child, which, no doubt, will under Providence be the means of its complete restoration to health. Be kind enough to inform me whether Susan is with you, and if she is give her the proper direction. _Ten packages_ were sent to your address last evening, one of them belongs to Susan, and she had better remain with you till she gets it, as it may not have come to hand. Susan thought she would go to Harrisburg when she left here and stay over Sunday, if so, she would not get to Philadelphia till Monday or Tuesday. Please acknowledge the receipt of this, and inform me of her arrival, also when the packages came safe to hand, inform me especially if Susan's came safely.  Truly Yours,  E.L. STEVENS.    LETTER FROM S.H. GAY, ESQ., EX-EDITOR OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD AND NEW YORK TRIBUNE.   FRIEND STILL:--The two women, Laura and Lizzy, arrived this morning. I shall forward them to Syracuse this afternoon.  The two men came safely yesterday, but went to Gibbs'. He has friends on board the boat who are on the lookout for fugitives, and send them, when found, to his house. Those whom you wish to be particularly under my charge, must have careful directions to this office.  There is now no other sure place, but the office, or Gibbs', that I could advise you to send such persons. Those to me, therefore, must come in office hours. In a few days, however, Napoleon will have a room down town, and at odd times they can be sent there. I am not willing to put any more with the family where I have hitherto sometimes sent them.  When it is possible I wish you would advise me two days before a shipment of your intention, as Napoleon is not always on hand to look out for them at short notice. In special cases you might advise me by Telegraph, thus: \"One M. (or one F.) this morning. W.S.\" By which I shall understand that one Male, or one Female, as the case may be, has left Phila. by the 6 _o'clock train_--one or more, also, as the case may be.  Aug. 17th, 1855.  Truly Yours, S.H. GAY.    LETTER FROM JOHN H. HILL, A FUGITIVE, APPEALING IN BEHALF OF A POOR SLAVE IN PETERSBURG, VA.   HAMILTON, Sept. 15th, 1856.  DEAR FRIEND STILL:--I write to inform you that Miss Mary Wever arrived safe in this city. You may imagine the happiness manifested on the part of the two lovers, Mr. H. and Miss W. I think they will be married as soon as they can get ready. I presume Mrs. Hill will commence to make up the articles to-morrow. Kind Sir, as all of us is concerned about the welfare of our enslaved brethren at the South, particularly our friends, we appeal to your sympathy to do whatever is in your power to save poor Willis Johnson from the hands of his cruel master. It is not for me to tell you of his case, because Miss Wever has related the matter fully to you. All I wish to say is this, I wish you to write to my uncle, at Petersburg, by our friend, the Capt. Tell my uncle to go to Richmond and ask my mother whereabouts this man is. The best for him is to make his way to Petersburg; that is, if you can get the Capt. to bring him. He have not much money. But I hope the friends of humanity will not withhold their aid on the account of money. However we will raise all the money that is wanting to pay for his safe delivery. You will please communicate this to the friends as soon as possible.  Yours truly,  JOHN H. HILL.    LETTER FROM J. BIGELOW, ESQ.   WASHINGTON, D.C., June 22d, 1854.  MR.

I had no thought that they would ever be printed. They were, and are, just _daily bread discourses_ meant to serve the spiritual needs of a congregation of Christian people, seekers after truth, inquirers about duty, strangers and pilgrims, in the great city and the troubled world.  But if, as friends think, these simple chapters may be of service through the printed page to a larger circle of readers, I willingly and freely let them go.  May the blessing of Jesus follow them on their humble path. May the Spirit of Truth bring them home to some hearts that want them,--to those who desire to escape from evil and do good,--to those who \"seek peace and ensue it.\"  HENRY VAN DYKE.  Park Avenue Church Manse, New York City.     CONTENTS    I. PEACE IN THE SOUL   II. PEACE ON EARTH THROUGH RIGHTEOUSNESS  III. THE POWER OF AN ENDLESS LIFE     I  Peace in the Soul  _Peace I leave with you: my peace I give unto you._--ST. JOHN 14:27.   Peace is one of the great words of the Holy Scriptures. It is woven through the Old Testament and the New like a golden thread. It inheres and abides in the character of God,--      \"The central peace subsisting at the heart     Of endless agitation.\"  It is the deepest and most universal desire of man, whose prayer in all ages has been, \"Grant us Thy Peace, O Lord.\" It is the reward of the righteous, the blessing of the good, the crown of life's effort, and the glory of eternity.  The prophets foretell the beauty of its coming and the psalmists sing of the joy which it brings. Jesus Christ is its Divine Messiah, its high priest and its holy prince. The evangelists and prophets proclaim and preach it. From beginning to end the Bible is full of the praise of peace.  Yet there never was a book more full of stories of trouble and strife, disaster and sorrow. God Himself is revealed in it not as a calm, untroubled, self-absorbed Deity, occupied in beatific contemplation of His own perfections. He is a God who works and labours, who wars against the evil, who fights for the good. The psalmist speaks of Him as \"The Lord of Hosts, strong and mighty in battle.\" The Revelation of St. John tells us that \"There was war in Heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon.\" Jesus Christ said: \"I came not to send peace, but a sword.\"  It is evident, then, that this idea of \"peace,\" like all good and noble things, has its counterfeit, its false and subtle versary, which steals its name and its garments to deceive and betray the hearts of men. We find this clearly taught in the Bible. Not more earnestly does it praise true peace than it denounces false peace.  _There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked_ (Isaiah 48:22).  _For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace_ (Jer. 8:11).  _If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes_ (St. Luke 19:42).  _For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace_ (Romans 8:6).  There never was a time in human history when a right understanding of the nature of true peace, the path which leads to it, the laws which govern it, was more necessary or more important than it is to-day.  The world has just passed through a ghastly experience of war at its worst. Never in history has there been such slaughter, such agony, such waste, such desolation, in a brief space of time, as in the four terrible years of conflict which German militarism forced on the world in the twentieth century. Having seen it, I know what it means.  Now we have \"supped full with horrors.\" We have had more than enough of that bloody banquet The heart of humanity longs for peace, as it has always longed, but now with a new intensity, greater than ever before. Yet the second course of war continues. The dogs fight for the crumbs under the peace-table. Ignorant armies clash by night. Cities are bombarded and sacked. The barbarous Bolsheviki raise the red flag of violence and threaten a war of classes throughout the world.  You can never make a golden age out of leaden men, or a peaceful world out of lovers of strife.  Where shall peace be found? How shall it be attained and safeguarded? Evidently the militarists have assaulted it with their doctrine that might makes right. Evidently the pacifists have betrayed it with their doctrine of passive acceptance of wrong. Somewhere between these two errors there must be a ground of truth on which Christians can stand to defend their faith and maintain their hope of a better future for the world.  Let me begin by speaking of _Peace in the Soul_. That is where religion begins, in the heart of a person. Its flowers and fruits are social. They are for the blessing of the world. But its root is personal. You can never start with a class--conscious or a mass--conscious Christianity. It must begin with just you and God.  Marshal Joffre, that fine Christian soldier, said a memorable thing about the winning of the war: \"Our victory will be the fruit of individual sacrifice.\" So of the coming of peace on earth we may say the same: it will be the fruit of the entrance of peace into individual hearts and lives.  A world at war is the necessary result of human restlessness and enmities. \"From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your lusts, that war in your members?\" Envy, malice, greed, hatred, deceit,--these are the begetters of strife on earth.  A world at peace can come only from the cooperation of peaceful human spirits. Therefore we must commence to learn what peace is, by seeking it in our souls through faith.  Christ promised peace to His disciples at the Communion in that little upper room in Jerusalem, nineteen hundred years ago. Evidently it was not an outward but an inward peace. He told them that they would have a lot of trouble in the world. But He assured them that this could not overcome them if they believed in Him and in His Father God. He warned them of conflict, and assured them of inward peace.  What are the elements of this wondrous gift which Christ gave to His disciples, and which He offers to us?  I. First, the peace of Christ is the peace of being divinely loved. Nothing rests and satisfies the heart like the sense of being loved. Let us take as an illustration the case of a little child, which has grown tired and fretful at its play, and is frightened suddenly by some childish terror. Weeping, it runs to its mother. She takes the child in her arms, folds it to her breast, bends over it, and soothes it with fond words which mean only this: \"I love you.\" Very soon the child sinks to rest, contented and happy, in the sense of being loved. \"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.\" In Jesus Christ God is stretching out His arms to us, drawing us to His bosom, enfolding us in the secret of peace. If we believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, He makes us sure of a Divine affection, deep, infinite, inexhaustible, imperishable. \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" God, who \"spared not his dearly-beloved Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?\" \"Nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"  II. The Christian peace is the peace of being divinely controlled. The man who accepts Jesus Christ truly, accepts Him as Master and Lord. He believes that Christ has a purpose for him, which will surely be fulfilled? work for him, which will surely be blessed if he only tries to do it. Most of the discords of life come from a conflict of authorities, of plans, of purposes. Suppose that a building were going up, and the architect had one design for it, and the builder had another. What perplexity and confusion there would be! How ill things would fit! What perpetual quarrels and blunders and disappointments! But when the workman accepts the designer's plan and simply does his best to carry that out, harmony, joyful labour, and triumph are the result. If we accept God's plan for us, yield to Him as the daily controller and director of our life, our work, however hard, becomes peaceful and secure. No perils can frighten, no interruptions can dishearten us.  Not many years ago some workmen were digging a tunnel, when a sudden fall of earth blocked the mouth of the opening. Their companions on the outside found out what had happened, and started to dig through the mass of earth to the rescue. It was several hours before they made their way through. When they went in they found the workmen going on with their labour on the tunnel. \"We knew,\" said one of them, \"that you'd come to help us, and we thought the best way to make time pass quick was to keep on with the work.\" That is what a Christian may say to Christ amid the dangers and disasters of life. We know that He will never forsake us, and the best way to be at peace is to be about His business. He says to us: \"As the Father sent me, even so send I you.\"  III. The Christian peace is the peace of being divinely forgiven.  \"In every man,\" said a philosopher, \"there is something which, if we knew it, would make us despise him.\" Let us turn the saying, and change it from a bitter cynicism into a wholesome truth.  In every one of us there is something which, if we realize it, makes us condemn ourselves as sinners, and hunger and"]]]
