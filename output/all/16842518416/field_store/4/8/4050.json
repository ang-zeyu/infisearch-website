[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15167"],["title","London River (#1)"],["body"," an arch beneath the feet a barge shoots out noiselessly on the ebb, and staring down at its sudden apparition you feel dizzily that it has the bridge in tow, and that all you people on it are being drawn unresisting into that lower world of shades.  You release yourself from this spell with an effort, and look at the faces of those who are beside you at the parapet.  What are their thoughts? Do they know?  Have they also seen the ghosts?  Have they felt stirring a secret and forgotten desire, old memories, tales that were told? They move away and go to their desks, or to their homes in the suburbs. A vessel that has hauled into the fairway calls for the Tower Bridge gates to be opened for her.  She is going.  We watch the eastern mists take her from us.  For we never are so passive and well-disciplined to the things which compel us but rebellion comes at times--misgiving that there is a world beyond the one we know, regret that we never ventured and made no discovery, and that our time has been saved and not spent. The gates to the outer world close again.  There, where that ship vanished, is the highway which brought those unknown folk whose need created London out of reeds and mere.  It is our oldest road, and now has many bypaths.  Near Poverty Corner is a building which recently was dismissed with a brief, humorous reference in a new guide to our City--a cobbled forecourt, tame pigeons, cabs, a brick front topped by a clock-face: Fenchurch Street Station.  Beyond its dingy platforms, the metal track which contracts into the murk is the road to China, though that is, perhaps, the last place you would guess to be at the end of it.  The train runs over a wilderness of tiles, a grey plateau of bare slate and rock, its expanse cracked and scored as though by a withering heat.  Nothing grows there; nothing could live there.  Smoke still pours from it, as though it were volcanic, from numberless vents.  The region is without sap.  Above its expanse project superior fumaroles, their drifting vapours dissolving great areas.  When the track descends slightly, you see cavities in that cliff which runs parallel with your track.  The desert is actually burrowed, and every hole in the plateau is a habitation.  Something does live there.  That region of burnt and fissured rock is tunneled and inhabited.  The unlikely serrations and ridges with the smoke moving over them are porous, and a fluid life ranges beneath unseen. It is the beginning of Dockland.  That the life is in upright beings, each with independent volition and a soul; that it is not an amorphous movement, flowing in bulk through buried pipes, incapable of the idea of height, of rising, it is difficult to believe.  It has not been believed.  If life, you protest, is really there, has any purpose which is better than that of extending worm-like through the underground, then why, at intervals, is there not an upheaval, a geyser-like burst, a plain hint from a power usually pent, but liable to go skywards?  But that is for the desert to answer.  As by mocking chance the desert itself almost instantly shows what possibilities are hidden within it. The train roars unexpectedly over a viaduct, and below is a deep hollow filled with light, with a floor of water, and a surprise of ships.  How did that white schooner get into such an enclosure?  Is freedom nearer here than we thought?  The crust of roofs ends abruptly in a country which is a complexity of gasometers, canals, railway junctions, between which cabbage fields in long spokes radiate from the train and revolve.  There is the grotesque suggestion of many ships in the distance, for through gaps in a nondescript horizon masts appear in a kaleidoscopic way.  The journey ends, usually in the rain, among iron sheds that are topped on the far side by the rigging and smoke-stacks of great liners.  There is no doubt about it now.  At the corner of one shed, sheltering from the weather, is a group of brown men in coloured rags, first seen in the gloom because of the whites of their eyes.  What we remember of such a day is that it was half of night, and the wind hummed in the cordage, and swayed wildly the loose gear aloft.  Towering hulls were ranged down each side of a lagoon that ended in vacancy.  The rigging and funnels of the fleet were unrelated; those ships were phantom and monstrous.  They seemed on too great a scale to be within human control.  We felt diminished and a little fearful, as among the looming urgencies of a dream.  The forms were gigantic but vague, and they were seen in a smother of the elements; and their sounds, deep and mournful, were like the warnings of something alien, yet without form, which we knew was adverse, but could not recall when awake again.  We remember, that day, a few watchers insecure on an exposed dockhead that projected into a sullen dreariness of river and mud which could have been the finish of the land.  At the end of a creaking hawser was a steamer canting as she backed to head downstream--now she was exposed to a great adventure--the tide rapid and noisy on her plates, the reek from her funnel sinking over the water.  And from the dockhead, in the fuddle of a rain-squall, we were waving a handkerchief, probably to the wrong man, till the vessel went out where all was one--rain, river, mud, and sky, and the future.  It is afterwards that so strange an ending to a brief journey from a City station is seen to have had more in it than the time-table, hurriedly scanned, gave away.  Or it would be remembered as strange, if the one who had to make that journey as much as thought of it again; for perhaps to a stranger occupied with more important matters it was passed as being quite relevant to the occasion, ordinary and rather dismal, the usual boredom of a duty.  Its strangeness depends, very likely, as much on an idle and squandering mind as on the ships, the River, and the gasometers.  Yet suppose you first saw the River from Blackwall Stairs, in the days when the windows of the _Artichoke Tavern_, an ancient, weather-boarded house with benches outside, still looked towards the ships coming in!  And how if then, one evening, you had seen a Blackwall liner haul out for the Antipodes while her crew sang a chanty!  It might put another light on the River, but a light, I will admit, which others should not be expected to see, and if they looked for it now might not discover, for it is possible that it has vanished, like the old tavern.  It is easy to persuade ourselves that a matter is made plain by the light in which we prefer to see it, for it is our light.  One day, I remember, a boy had to take a sheaf of documents to a vessel loading in the London Dock.  She was sailing that tide.  It was a hot July noon.  It is unlucky to send a boy, who is marked by all the omens for a City prisoner, to that dock, for it is one of the best of its kind.  He had not been there before.  There was an astonishing vista, once inside the gates, of sherry butts and port casks.  On the flagstones were pools of wine lees.  There was an unforgettable smell. It was of wine, spices, oakum, wool, and hides.  The sun made it worse, but the boy, I think, preferred it strong.  After wandering along many old quays, and through the openings of dark sheds that, on so sunny a day, were stored with cool night and cubes and planks of gold, he found his ship, the _Mulatto Girl_.  She was for the Brazils.  Now it is clear that one even wiser in shipping affairs than a boy would have expected to see a craft that was haughty and portentous when bound for the Brazils, a ship that looked equal to making a coast of that kind. There she was, her flush deck well below the quay wall.  A ladder went down to her, for she was no more than a schooner of a little over one hundred tons.  If that did not look like the beginning of one of those voyages reputed to have ended with the Elizabethans, then I am trying to convey a wrong impression.  On the deck of the _Mulatto Girl_ was her master, in shirt and trousers and a remarkable straw hat more like a canopy, bending over to discharge some weighty words into the hatch. He rose and looked up at the boy on the quay, showing then a taut black beard and formidable eyes.  With his hands on his hips, he surveyed for a few seconds, without speaking, the messenger above.  Then he talked business, and more than legitimate business.  \"Do you want to come?\" he asked, and smiled.  \"Eh?\"  He stroked his beard.  (The Brazils and all! A ship like that!)  \"There's a berth for you.  Come along, my son.\" And observe what we may lose through that habit of ours of uncritical obedience to duty; see what may leave us for ever in that fatal pause, caused by the surprise of the challenge to our narrow experience and knowledge, the pause in which we allow habit to overcome adventurous instinct!  I never heard again of the _Mulatto Girl_.  I could not expect to.  Something, though, was gained that day.  It cannot be named.  It is of no value.  It is, you may have guessed, that very light which it has been admitted may since have gone out.  Well, nobody who has ever surprised that light in Dockland will be persuaded that it is not there still, and will remain.  But what could strangers see of it?  The foreshore to them is the unending monotony of grey streets, sometimes grim, often decayed, and always reticent and sullen, that might never have seen the stars nor heard of good luck; and the light would be, when closely looked at, merely a high gas bracket on a dank wall in solitude, its glass broken, and the flame within it fluttering to extinction like an imprisoned and crippled moth trying to evade the squeeze of giant darkness and the wind.  The narrow and forbidding by-path under that glim, a path intermittent and depending on the weight of the night which is trying to blot it out altogether, goes to Wapping Old Stairs.  Prince Rupert once went that way.

It is a path, like all those stairs and ways that go down to the River, which began when human footsteps first outlined London with rough tracks.  It is a path by which the descendants of those primitives went out of London, when projecting the original enterprise of their forbears from Wapping to the Guinea Coast and Manitoba.  Why should we believe it is different today?  The sea does not change, and seamen are what they were if their ships are not those we admired many years ago in the India Docks.  It is impossible for those who know them to see those moody streets of Dockland, indeterminate, for they follow the River, which run from Tooley Street by the Hole-in-the-Wall to the Deptford docks, and from Tower Hill along Wapping High Street to Limehouse and the Isle of Dogs, as strangers would see them.  What could they be to strangers?  Mud, taverns, pawnshops, neglected and obscure churches, and houses that might know nothing but ill-fortune.  So they are; but those ways hold more than the visible shades.  The warehouses of that meandering chasm which is Wapping High Street are like weathered and unequal cliffs.  It is hard to believe sunlight ever falls there.  It could not get down.  It is not easy to believe the River is near.  It seldom shows.  You think at times you hear the distant call of a ship.  But what would that be?  Something in the mind.  It happened long ago.  You, too, are a ghost left by the vanished past.  There is a man above at a high loophole, the topmost cave of a warehouse which you can see has been exposed to commerce and the elements for ages; he pulls in a bale pendulous from the cable of a derrick.  Below him one of the horses of a van tosses its nose-bag. There is no other movement.  A carman leans against an iron post, and cuts bread and cheese with a clasp-knife.  It was curious to hear that steamer call, but we knew what it was.  It was from a ship that went down, we have lately heard, in the War, and her spectre reminds us, from a voyage which is over, of men we shall see no more.  But the call comes again just where the Stairs, like a shining wedge of day, hold the black warehouses asunder, and give us the light of the River and a release to the outer world.  And there, moving swiftly across the brightness, goes a steamer outward bound.  That was what we wanted to know.  She confirms it, and her signal, to whomever it was made, carries farther than she would guess.  It is understood.  The past for some of us now is our only populous and habitable world, invisible to others, but alive with whispers for us. Yet the sea still moves daily along the old foreshore, and ships still come and go, and do not, like us, run aground on what now is not there.     II. A Midnight Voyage  Our voyage was to begin at midnight from near Limehouse Hole.  The hour and the place have been less promising in the beginning of many a strange adventure.  Where the voyage would end could not be said, except that it would be in Bugsby's Reach, and at some time or other. It was now ten o'clock, getting towards sailing time, and the way to the foreshore was unlighted and devious.  Yet it was somewhere near. This area of still and empty night railed off from the glare of the Commercial Road would be Limehouse Church.  It is foolish to suppose you know the Tower Hamlets because you have seen them by day.  They change.  They are like those uncanny folk of the fables.  At night, wonderfully, they become something else, take another form, which has never been more than glimpsed, and another character, so fabulous and secret that it will support the tales of the wildest romanticist, who rightly feels that if such yarns were told of 'Frisco or Timbuctoo they might get found out.  Was this the church?  Three Chinamen were disputing by its gate.  Perhaps they were in disagreement as to where the church would be in daylight.  At a corner where the broad main channel of electric light ended, and perplexity began, a policeman stood, and directed me into chaos. \"Anywhere,\" he explained, \"anywhere down there will do.\"  I saw a narrow alley in the darkness, which had one gas lamp and many cobbled stones.  At the bottom of the lane were three iron posts.  Beyond the posts a bracket lamp showed a brick wall, and in the wall was an arch so full of gloom that it seemed impassable, except to a steady draught of cold air that might have been the midnight itself entering Limehouse from its own place.  At the far end of that opening in the wall was nothing.  I stood on an invisible wooden platform and looked into nothing with no belief that a voyage could begin from there.  Before me then should have been the Thames, at the top of the flood tide.  It was not seen.  There was only a black void dividing some clusters of brilliant but remote and diminished lights.  There were odd stars which detached themselves from the fixed clusters, and moved in the void, sounding the profundity of the chasm beneath them with lines of trembling fire.  Such a wandering comet drifted near where I stood on the verge of nothing, and then it was plain that its trail of quivering light did not sound, but floated and undulated on a travelling road--that chasm before me was black because it was filled with fluid night.  Night, I discovered suddenly, was in irresistible movement.  It was swift and heavy.  It was unconfined.  It was welling higher to douse our feeble glims and to founder London, built of shadows on its boundary.  It moved with frightful quietness.  It seemed confident of its power.  It swirled and eddied by the piles of the wharf, and there it found a voice, though that was muffled; yet now and then it broke into levity for a moment, as at some shrouded and alien jest.  There were sounds which reached me at last from the opposite shore, faint with distance and terror.  The warning from an unseen steamer going out was as if a soul, crossing this Styx, now knew all.  There is no London on the Thames, after sundown.  Most of us know very little of the River by day.  It might then be no more native to our capital than the Orientals who stand under the Limehouse gas lamps at night.  It surprises us.  We turn and look at it from our seat in a tram, and watch a barge going down on the ebb--it luckily misses the piers of Blackfriars Bridge--as if a door had unexpectedly opened on a mystery, revealing another world in London, and another sort of life than ours. It is as uncanny as if we had sensed another dimension of space.  The tram gets among the buildings again, and we are reassured by the confined and arid life we know.  But what a light and width had that surprising world where we saw a barge drifting as leisurely as though the narrow limits which we call reality were there unknown!  But after dark there is not only no River, when you stand where by day is its foreshore; there is no London.  Then, looking out from Limehouse, you might be the only surviving memory of a city that has vanished.  You might be solitary among the unsubstantial shades, for about you are only comets passing through space, and inscrutable shapes; your neighbours are Cassiopeia and the Great Bear.  But where was our barge, the _Lizzie_?  I became aware abruptly of the skipper of this ship for our midnight voyage among the stars.  He had his coat-collar raised.  The _Lizzie_, he said, was now free of the mud, and he was going to push off.  Sitting on a bollard, and pulling out his tobacco-pouch, he said he hadn't had her out before.  Sorry he'd got to do it now.  She was a bitch.  She bucked her other man overboard three days ago.  They hadn't found him yet.  They found her down by Gallions Reach.  Jack Jones was the other chap.  Old Rarzo they called him.  Took more than a little to give him that colour.  But he was All Right.  They were going to give a benefit concert for his wife and kids.  Jack's brother was going to sing; good as Harry Lauder, he is.  Below us a swirl of water broke into mirth, instantly suppressed.  We could see the _Lizzie_ now.  The ripples slipped round her to the tune of they-'avn't-found-'im-yet, they-'avn't-found-'im-yet-they 'avn't. The skipper and crew rose, fumbling at his feet for a rope.  There did not seem to be much of the _Lizzie_.  She was but a little raft to drift out on those tides which move among the stars.  \"Now's your chance,\" said her crew, and I took it, on all fours.  The last remnant of London was then pushed from us with a pole.  We were launched on night, which had begun its ebb towards morning.  The punt sidled away obliquely for mid-stream.  I stood at one end of it.  The figure of Charon could be seen at the other, of long acquaintance with this passage, using his sweep with the indifference of habitude.  Perhaps it was not Charon.  Yet there was some obstruction to the belief that we were bound for no more than the steamer _Aldebaran_, anchored in Bugsby's Reach.  From the low deck of the barge it was surprising that the River, whose name was Night, was content with the height to which it had risen.  Perhaps it was taking its time.  It might soon receive an influx from space, rise then in a silent upheaval, and those low shadows that were London, even now half foundered, would at once go.  This darkness was an irresponsible power. It was the same flood which had sunk Knossos and Memphis.  It was tranquil, indifferent, knowing us not, reckoning us all one with the Sumerians.  They were below it.  It had risen above them.  Now the time had come when it was laving the base of London.  The crew cried out to us that over there was the entrance to the West India Dock.  We knew that place in another life.  But should Charon joke with us?  We saw only chaos, in which the beams from a reputed city glimmered without purpose.  The shadow of the master of our black barge pulled at his sweep with a slow confidence that was"]]]
