FORMULA FOR THE LESSON ON THE MUSCLES.  1. Muscles are the red, elastic bands and bundles of thread like substance, called flesh, which cover the bones and make the eyeballs, the eyelids, the tongue, the heart, the lungs, and various other parts of the body.  2. There are about four hundred and fifty muscles in my body.  3. The work of the muscles is to support and move my bones, and different parts of the body.  4. The muscles may be named the muscles of my head, the muscles of my trunk, the muscles of my limbs.  5. The muscles of my head cover and move the parts of my head and face. The muscles of my trunk cover and move the parts of my neck and trunk. The muscles of my limbs cover and mote the parts of my arms and legs.  6. Those muscles are the weakest which I use least; those muscles are the strongest which I exercise most in work or play.  7. If I would be strong and healthy,     my muscles must be used,     my muscles must be rested,     my muscles must be supplied with good blood.  I must exercise in work and play to make them strong; I must sleep, or change my kind of work or play, to give them rest, when they are tired; I must breathe pure air, take wholesome food and drink, and live in the sunlight, to supply them with good blood; I must not weaken them by using alcohol or tobacco.         *       *       *       *       *  QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.  1. Tell about the muscles.  2. How many muscles have you in your body?  3. Of what use are the muscles?  4. How may the muscles be named?  5. Tell about the muscles of the head, trunk, and limbs.  6.

What is necessary if you would have strong and healthy muscles?         *       *       *       *       *  CLASSES AND WORK OF THE MUSCLES.  The muscles are divided into two great classes: those which we may move as we choose, called _voluntary_ muscles, and those over which we have no power, called _involuntary_ muscles.  Some muscles support and move the various parts of the body, others have different work to do. The heart, the great involuntary muscle, acts like an engine to drive the blood throughout the body; the lungs draw in and throw out the air in breathing; the stomach helps to churn and change food into blood; the tongue is used in speaking and eating.         *       *       *       *       *  QUESTIONS ON THE MUSCLES.  What are the muscles?--\"The lean flesh of the body; bands and bundles of fleshy threads which cover the body.\"  Of what use are the muscles to the body?--\"They cover the bones; they support and move the bones and different parts of the body.\"  Name some parts of the body which are made of muscles.--\"The eyeballs, the eyelids, the tongue, the heart, the lungs.\"  What color are the muscles?--\"Red.\"  How do the muscles move the bones?--\"By shortening or lengthening themselves according to the way the bones are to be moved.\"  Tell how the muscles move your arm at the elbow.--\"The muscles in the front part of the arm shorten themselves, to draw my fore-arm toward the shoulder; when I wish to stretch out the fore-arm these muscles lengthen, while another set of muscles shorten, to draw the fore-arm away from the upper arm.\"  What do you say about the muscles because they have the power to shorten and lengthen themselves?--\"They are elastic.\"  About how many muscles are there in your whole body?--\"About four hundred and fifty.\"  How may these be divided as you study about them?--\"They may be divided into the muscles of my head, the muscles of my trunk, and the muscles of my limbs.\"  Of what use are the muscles of your head?--\"They cover and move the parts of my head and face.\"  Of what use are the muscles of your trunk?--\"They move the parts of my neck and trunk.\"  Of what use are the muscles of your limbs?--\"They move the parts of my arms and legs.\"  How can you make your muscles strong?--\"By using them.\"  How can you make your muscles weak?--\"By not using them.\"  What is necessary to make your muscles strong and healthy?--\"They must be used; they must be rested when tired; they must be supplied with pure blood.\"  How should the muscles be used?--\"They should be exercised in work or play.\"  How may they be rested?--\"I may rest my muscles by changing position; by changing my kind of work or play; or by going to sleep.\"  Explain what you mean by changing your position.--\"If I am standing, I must sit or lie down to rest them; if they are tired, because I have been sitting too long, I must rest them by standing, walking, or running.\"  What do you mean by changing the kind of work or play?--\"If, in my work or play, my arms become tired, I must do something in which my arms may rest, though other parts of my body may be in exercise.\"  How may you help supply your muscles with good blood?--\"By breathing pure air; by taking wholesome food and drink; and by living in the sunlight.\"  How does drinking alcoholic liquors hurt the muscles?--\"It makes them weak, and unfit to move the parts of the body.\"  What wonderful muscle moves without your will?--\"The heart.\"  How does alcohol hurt the heart?--\"It makes it beat too fast.\"  How does \"beating too fast\" hurt the heart?--\"It makes it tired, and sometimes wears it out.\" See Appendices on Alcohol and Tobacco.         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration: THE SKIN (very highly magnified).--(From Walker's _Physiology_, 1884.)]  A, arteries; V, veins; N, nerves; F, fat cells; E, the outer skin; CL, the color layer; D, the true skin; PT, a perspiratory tube; HF, a hair and hair sac; EP, muscles; SG, oil glands; TC, tactile corpuscles; CT, connective tissue.

FORMULA FOR THE LESSON ON THE SKIN.  1. My skin covers my body.  2. It is thin, elastic, flexible, porous, and absorbent.  3. I have two skins; the inner skin is the true skin.  4. My true skin is elastic, and like a net-work of blood-vessels and nerves. My true skin is covered with a jelly-like substance which gives color to my skin.  5. My outside skin is not the same thickness over my whole body. In some parts, as on the palms of my hands and the soles of my feet, it is very thick and tough.  6. If my outside skin be destroyed, it will grow again; if the jelly-like substance be destroyed, it will re-appear; but if my true skin be destroyed, it will never be perfectly renewed.  7. More than half of the waste substance of my body passes from it through the pores of the skin, in the form of perspiration.  8. If I would have a healthy skin,     I must perspire freely all the time,     I must keep my body clean,     I must wear clean clothing,     I must breathe pure air,     and live in the sunlight.         *       *       *       *       *  QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.  1.

Do not bathe when tired or after a hearty meal. After bathing _rub well_ with a coarse towel.         *       *       *       *       *  QUESTIONS ON THE SKIN.  Of what use is the skin?--\"It covers the muscles of the body.\"  What can you tell about it?--\"It is flexible, elastic, porous, and absorbent.\"  Why do you say it is flexible?--\"Because it is easily bent.\"  Why do you say it is porous?--\"Because it is full of little holes, or pores.\"  Why do you say it is elastic?--\"Because it will spring back after it is stretched, squeezed, twisted, or bent.\"  Why do you say it is absorbent?--\"Because it will soak up liquids.\"  How many skins have you?--\"Two; an outside skin, and an inner skin.\"  Which is the true skin?--\"The inner skin.\"  Of what is the inner skin composed?--\"Of blood-vessels and nerves.\"  How do you know that the outer skin has no blood-vessels?--\"Because if I put a pin through the outer skin the blood does not flow out, as it would if I had cut a blood-vessel.\"  How do you know the outer skin has no nerves?--\"Because if I put a pin through my outer skin it does not make me suffer pain, as it would if I had touched a nerve.\"  What gives color to the skin?--\"A jelly-like substance between the inner and the outer skin.\"  What have you learned about the true skin?--\"That it is of the same color in people of every nation.\"  What difference is there in the thickness of the outer skin? [See Formula.]  What passes through the pores of the skin? [See Formula.]  What is this waste called when it comes from the surface of the skin?--\"Perspiration.\"  When does the perspiration flow through the pores of the skin?--\"All the time, if the skin is healthy.\"  Why do we not always see the perspiration which passes through the pores?--\"Because it does not always form drops on the surface of the skin; it generally passes off in very fine particles.\"  What becomes of the fine or minute portions of perspiration which pass from the body?--\"Some of these portions are absorbed by the clothing; some pass into and mix with the air around us.\"  What effect does the perspiration produce on the air and the clothing?--\"It soon makes the air unfit to be breathed, and the clothing unfit to be worn.\"  What is necessary if you would have a healthy skin? [See Formula.]  Why must you wear clean clothing?--\"That there may be nothing impure in the clothing for the pores of the skin to absorb.\"  Why should you breathe pure air?--\"Because air purifies the blood, and pure blood is necessary to make a healthy skin.\"  How does drinking alcoholic liquors hurt the skin?--\"It makes the blood impure, and impure blood makes unhealthy skin.\"  In what other way does drinking these liquors hurt the skin?--\"It gives the skin too much work to do.\"  How does it give it too much work to do?--\"It makes more waste substance to pass from it through the pores, in the form of perspiration.\"  In what other way does drinking alcoholic liquors hurt the skin?--\"It makes it a bad color.\"  How does it make the skin a bad color?--\"It stretches the little blood-vessels of the skin, and makes them too full of blood.\" See Appendix.         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration: THE HEART.]  A, the right ventricle; B, the left ventricle; C, the right auricle D, the left auricle; E, the aorta; F, the pulmonary artery.         *       *       *       *       *  PART VIII.  FORMULA FOR THE LESSON ON THE HEART AND THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.  1. My heart is shaped like a cone, and placed in my chest near my breastbone, with its apex pointing downward to my left side. It beats about seventy times a minute, sending out about two ounces of blood at every beat.  2. The blood when pure is of a bright red color; it is a liquid made from food and drink.  3. It passes from my heart to all parts of my body, through pipes called arteries; these arteries spread out through the body like branches from a tree.  4. As the blood flows from the heart, through the arteries, it gives nourishment to every part of the body, and carries away the impurities it meets, which makes it black and thick; when it comes through the veins, back to the heart, it is not fit to be used, so it goes to the lungs to be purified by the fresh air; then it returns to the heart to be sent again throughout the body; this happens once in from three to eight minutes, and is called the circulation of the blood.  7. If I would be healthy,     my blood must be pure and circulate freely all the time.  8. It will not circulate freely,     if I wear tight clothing,     if I do not exercise in work or play,     if I do not keep my body warm.  9. It will be impure,     if I breathe bad air,     if I eat unwholesome food,     if I drink alcoholic liquors,     if I snuff, smoke, or chew tobacco.         *       *       *       *       *  QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.  1. Tell about the heart and where it is placed.  2. Tell about the blood and of what it is made.  3. Where does the good blood pass after it is sent out from the heart?  4. Tell what the blood does as it flows through the body.  5. What is this flowing of the blood to and from the heart called?  6. How often does it happen?  7. What is necessary if you would have pure blood?  8. When will the blood not circulate freely?  9. When will the blood be impure?         *       *       *       *       *  HOW TO TREAT A WOUND.  If it is only a flesh-wound or slight cut, wash it with cold water and bandage it with a clean, white rag. The edges of a deep cut should be drawn together and held in place by narrow strips of adhesive plaster, fastened across the wound from side to side.  If the cut is very deep, and the blood flows very freely, send for a doctor. While you wait for him, knot a handkerchief, or suspender, or towel, in the middle, and twist it very tightly _over the cut artery, above the wound_. If a vein has been severed, twist the knotted handkerchief _below the wound_. If the blood continues to flow, tie a bandage both above and below the hurt part.         *       *       *       *       *  QUESTIONS ON THE HEART AND THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.  Of what shape is your heart?--\"My heart is shaped like a cone.\"  Where is it placed?--\"In the chest, pointing toward my left side.\"  What bone is it near?--\"It is near my breastbone.\"  Of what use is the heart?--\"It contains the blood and sends it to the different parts of the body.\"  How much blood is sent from the heart at each beat?--\"About two ounces.\"  What is the blood?--\"A liquid made from food and drink.\"  Of what color is the blood?--\"Bright red, when pure; dark red, when impure.\"  How does the heart send the blood through the body?--\"Through pipes called arteries.\"  What do the arteries resemble in the way they are arranged?--\"The branches of a tree.\"  What makes the blood impure?--\"As the blood flows, it gives nourishment to every part of the body; this makes it poor. It also takes up the old worn-out particles; this makes it impure.\"  Where do the arteries carry the impure blood?--\"To the veins.\"  Where do the veins carry the impure blood?--\"To the heart.\"  Where does the heart carry the impure blood?--\"To the lungs.\"  What happens to the impure blood in the lungs?--\"It is made pure.\"  What makes it pure?--\"Pure air.\"  Where do the lungs send the blood after it is made pure?--\"Back to the heart.\"  Where does the heart send the pure blood?--\"Throughout the body.\"  What is the journey of the blood to and from the heart to the different parts of the body called?--\"The circulation of the blood.\"  What is the circulation of the blood?--\"The circulation of the blood is its journey from the heart to the different parts of the body, and from the different parts of the body back to the heart.\"  How often does this circulation take place?--\"Once in from three to eight minutes, according as the heart beats fast or slowly.\"  What kind of blood is necessary to health?--\"Pure blood.\"  How should the blood circulate?--\"Freely, all the time.\"  What do you mean by freely?--\"Without anything to hinder.\"  What is necessary for the free circulation of the blood?--\"I must wear clean clothing; I must exercise in work or play; I must keep my body warm.\"  How does tight clothing hinder the free circulation of the blood?--\"By pressing upon the arteries and veins; and when about the waist, causing the ribs and other parts of the body to press upon the heart.\"  How "]]]
