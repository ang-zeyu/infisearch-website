[Illustration]  [Illustration]  \"No,\" said Samuel Whiskers, \"make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs.\"  [Illustration]  \"Nonsense! Butter and dough,\" replied Anna Maria.  [Illustration]  The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.  Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot, and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter. He did not meet anybody.  He made a second journey for the rolling-pin. He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel.  He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were busy lighting the candle to look into the chest.  They did not see him.  [Illustration]  Anna Maria went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.  [Illustration]  She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws.  She did not observe Moppet.  While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help.  But his mouth was full of soot and cobwebs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.  Except a spider, which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance.  It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate blue-bottles. It did not offer to assist him.  Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling. First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough.  \"Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?\" inquired Samuel Whiskers.  [Illustration]  Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry. She laid hold of his ears.  [Illustration]  Tom Kitten bit and spat, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling-pin went roly-poly, roly; roly, poly, roly. The rats each held an end.  \"His tail is sticking out! You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria.\"  \"I fetched as much as I could carry,\" replied Anna Maria.  \"I do not think\"--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten--\"I do _not_ think it will be a good pudding. It smells sooty.\"  Anna Maria was about to argue the point, when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw; and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!  [Illustration]  The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively.  \"We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property--and other people's,--and depart at once.\"  \"I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.\"  [Illustration]  \"But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary.\"  \"Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane,\" said Anna Maria. \"I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney.\"  [Illustration]  So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up--there was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling!  [Illustration]  But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet.  [Illustration]  Then he nailed the plank down again and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs.  The cat family had quite recovered. They invited him to stay to dinner.  The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten, and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts.  They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off.  John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheel-barrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops.  And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the lane from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheel-barrow, which looked very like mine.  They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.  Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath. Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones.  She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage.  I am sure _I_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheel-barrow!  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  They went into the barn, and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the hay mow.  [Illustration]  After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's.  [Illustration]  As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted. There are rats, and rats, and rats in his barn! They eat up the chicken food, and steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags.  And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers--children and grand-children and great great grand-children.  There is no end to them!  Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.  They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment. They charge so much a dozen, and earn their living very comfortably.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  They hang up the rats' tails in a row on the barn door, to show how many they have caught--dozens and dozens of them.  [Illustration]  But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face anything that is bigger than--  [Illustration]  A Mouse."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15577"],["title","A History of the McGuffey Readers (#0)"],["body","HISTORY OF THE McGUFFEY READERS.

CLEVELAND   THE BURROWS BROTHERS CO.   1911     Copyright, 1911, by Henry H. Vail.    [Transcriber's Note: At the top of each page in the original is a header line briefly describing the content on each page. In this document, these header lines have been placed inside square brackets and move to the start of the paragraph which begins the content so described.]     A History of the McGuffey Readers  THE BOOKS.   Before me are four small books roughly bound in boards, the sides covered with paper. On the reverse of the title pages, two bear a copyright entry in the year 1836; the others were entered in 1837. They are the earliest editions of McGuffey's Eclectic Readers that have been found in a search lasting forty years.  They represent the first efforts in an educational and business enterprise that has for three-quarters of a century called for the best exertions of many skilled men, and in their several forms these books have taken a conspicuous part in the education of millions of the citizens of this country.  But what interest can the history of the McGuffey Eclectic Readers have to those who did not use these books in their school career? Their story differs from that of other readers since in successive forms, adjusted more or less perfectly to the changing demands of the schools, they attained a wider and more prolonged use than has been accorded to any other series.  [The Function of Readers]  By custom and under sanction of law certain studies are pursued in the common schools of every state. Spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, history, grammar, civics and physiology are the subjects usually taught. The school authorities select the textbooks which shall be used in each subject. The readers are the only texts used in all schools affording opportunity for distinct ethical teaching. The history of our country should give ideas of patriotism; the civics should contain the primary notions of government; the physiologies should instruct the pupils in the laws of health; but the reader should cover the whole field of morals and manners and in language that will impress their teaching indelibly upon the mind of every pupil. While the chief aim of the school readers must be to teach the child to apprehend thought from the printed page and convey this thought to the attentive listener with precision, these efforts should be exerted upon thoughts that have permanent value. No other texts used in the school room bear directly and positively upon the formation of character in the pupils. The school readers are the proper and indispensable texts for teaching true patriotism, integrity, honesty, industry, temperance, courage, politeness, and all other moral and intellectual virtues. In these books every lesson should have a distinct purpose in view, and the final aim should be to establish in the pupils high moral principles which are at the foundation of character.  [Formers of Character]  The literature of the English language is rich in material suited to this intent; no other language is better endowed. This material is fresh to every pupil, no matter how familiar it may be to teacher or parent. Although some of it has been in print for three centuries, it is true and beautiful today.  President Eliot has said, \"When we teach a child to read, our primary aim is not to enable it to decipher a way-bill or a receipt, but to kindle its imagination, enlarge its vision and open for it the avenues of knowledge.\" Knowledge gives power, which may be exerted for good or for evil. Character gives direction to power. Power is the engine which may force the steamer through the water, character is the helm which renders the power serviceable for good.  Readers which have been recognized as formers of good habits of action, thought, and speech for three-quarters of a century, which have taught a sound morality to millions of children without giving offense to the most violent sectarian, which have opened the doors of pure literature to all their users, are surely worthy of study as to their origin, their successive changes, and their subsequent career.  The story of these readers is told in the specimens of the several editions, in the long treasured and time-worn contracts, in the books of accounts kept by the successive publishers, and in the traditions which have been passed down from white haired men who gossiped of the early days in the schoolbook business. Valuable information has also been furnished by descendants of the McGuffey family, and by the educational institutions with which each of the authors of the readers was connected.  [Different Editions]  For half a century the present writer has had personal knowledge of the readers. At first, as a teacher, using them daily in the class room; but soon, as an editor, directing the literary work of the publishers and owners. It therefore falls to him to narrate a story \"quorum pars minima fui.\"  For more than seventy years the McGuffey Readers have held high rank as text-books for use in the elementary schools, especially throughout the West and South. But during this time these books have been revised five times and adjusted to the changed conditions in the schools. In each one of these revisions the marked characteristics of the original series have been most scrupulously retained, and the continued success of the series is doubtless owing to this fact. There has been a continuity of spirit.  [Contents of the Books]  The First and Second Readers were first published in 1836. In 1837 the Third and Fourth Readers were printed. For reasons elsewhere explained these books were \"improved and enlarged\" in 1838. In 1841 a higher reader was added to the series which was then named McGuffey's Rhetorical Guide. In the years 1843 and 1844 the four books then constituting the series were thoroughly remodeled and on the title pages were placed the words \"Newly Revised\" and the Rhetorical Guide was annexed as the Fifth Reader. Ten years later the entire series was made over and issued in six books. These were then called the New Readers. From 1853 until 1878 the books remained substantially unchanged; but in the latter year they were renewed largely in substance and improved in form. These readers as copyrighted in 1879 were extensively used for more than a quarter of a century. Changing conditions in the school room called for another revision in 1901. This latest form now in extensive use is called The New McGuffey Readers.  Each of these revisions has constituted practically a new series although the changes have never included the entire contents. In the higher readers will be found today many selections which appeared in the original books. The reason for retaining such selections is clear. No one has been able to write in the English language selections that are better for school use than some written by Shakespeare, Milton, Bacon, and other early writers. The literature of the English language has not all been written in the present decade nor in the last century.  As at first published, the lower books of the McGuffey Readers had no trace of the modern methods now used in teaching the mastery of words--even the alphabet was not given in orderly form; but the alphabetic method of teaching the art of reading was then the only one used. The pupil at first spelled each word by naming the letters and then pronounced each syllable and then the word.  [First Editions]  The following stanza is copied from page 61 of the edition of 1844 to illustrate the method of presenting words:    I like to see a lit-tle dog,     And pat him on the head;   So pret-ti-ly he wags his tail     When-ev-er he is fed.   The First Reader was mostly in words of one syllable. In this book we find the story of the lame dog that, when cured, brought another lame dog to be doctored: of the kind boy who freed his caged bird; of the cruel boy who drowned the cat and pulled wings and legs from flies; of Peter Pindar the story teller, and the \"snow dog\" of Mount St. Bernard; of Mr. Post who adopted and reared Mary; of the boy who told a lie and repented after he was found out; of the chimney sweep who was tempted to steal a gold watch but put it back and was thereafter educated by its owner; of the whisky boy; and of the mischievous boy who played ghost and made another boy insane. Nearly every lesson has a moral clearly stated in formal didactic words at its close.  In the Second Reader we find the story of the idle boy who talked with the bees, dogs, and horses, and having found them all busy, reformed himself; of the kind girl who shared her cake with a dog and an old man; of the mischievous boys who tied the grass across the path and thus upset not only the milk-maid but the messenger running for a doctor to come to their father; of the wise lark who knew that the farmer's grain would not be cut until he resolved to cut it himself; of the wild and ravenous bear that treed a boy and hung suspended by his boot; and of another bear that traveled as a passenger by night in a stage coach; of the quarrelsome cocks, pictured in a clearly English farm yard, that were both eaten up by the fox that had been brought in by the defeated cock; of the honest boy and the thief who was judiciously kicked by the horse that carried oranges in baskets; of George Washington and his historic hatchet and the mutilated cherry-tree; and of the garden that was planted with seeds in lines spelling Washington's name which removed all doubt as to an intelligent Creator. There were also some lessons on such animals as beavers, whales, peacocks and lions.  [Favorite Selections]  The Third Reader will be remembered first because of the picture, on the cover, of Napoleon on his rearing charger. This book contained five"]]]
