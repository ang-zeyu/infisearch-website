Chandragupta I., the founder of the great dynasty which Hindus extol above all others, was only a petty chieftain by birth, but he was fortunate enough to wed a lady of high lineage, who could trace a connection with the ancient Maurya house of Magadha, and, thanks to this alliance and to his own prowess, he was able at his death to bequeath real kingship to his son, Samadragupta, who, during a fifty years' reign, A.D. 326-375, again welded almost the whole of India north of the Nerbudda river into one empire, and once even spoiled Southern India right down to Cape Comorin. His victories are recorded--with an irony perhaps not wholly accidental--beneath the Asokan inscription on the Allahabad pillar. Of his zeal for Hinduism we have a convincing proof in gold coins of his reign that preserve on the obverse in the figure of the sacrificial horse a record of the _Asvamedha_, which he again revived. Strange to say, however, his fame has never been so popular as that of his son, Chandragupta II., Vikramadytia, the Sun of Power, who reigned in turn for nearly forty years, and has lived in Hindu legend as the Raja Bikram, to whom India owes her golden age. It was his court at Ujjain which is believed to have been adorned by the \"Nine Gems\" of Sanskrit literature, amongst whom the favourite is Kalidasa, the poet and dramatist. Amidst much that is speculative, one thing is certain. The age of Vikramadytia was an age of Brahmanical ascendancy. As has so often happened, and is still happening in India to-day in the struggle between Urdu and Hindi, the battle of religious and political supremacy was largely one of languages. During the centuries of Brahmanical depression that preceded the Gupta dynasty, the more vulgar tongue spoken of the people prevailed. Under the Guptas, Sanskrit, which was the language of the Brahmans, resumed its pre-eminence and took possession of the whole field of literature and art and science as well as of theology. Oral traditions were reduced to writing and poetry was adapted to both sacred and profane uses in the Puranas, in the metrical code of Manu, in treatises on sacrificial ritual, in Kalidasa's plays, and in many other works of which only fragments have survived. Astronomy, logic, philosophy were all cultivated with equal fervour and to the greater glory of Brahmanism. Local tradition is doubtless quite wrong in assigning to Raja Bikram the noble gateway which is the only monument of Hindu architecture at its best that Ujjain has to show to-day. But to that period may, perhaps, be traced the graceful, if highly ornate, style of architecture, of which the Bhuvaneshwar temples, several centuries more recent, are the earliest examples that can be at all accurately dated. To the credit of Brahmanism be it said that in its hour of triumph it remained at least negatively tolerant, as all purely Indian creeds generally have been. Fa-Hien, who visited India during the reign of Vikramadytia, though dismayed at the desolation which had already overtaken many of the sacred places of Buddhism, pays a generous tribute to the tolerance and statesmanship of that great sovereign. The country seems, indeed, to have enjoyed real prosperity under a paternal and almost model administration.  Yet the Gupta dynasty endured only a little longer than had that of the Mauryas. Its downfall was hastened by the long reign of terror which India went through during the invasion of the White Huns. Europe had undergone a like ordeal nearly a century earlier, for when the Huns began to move out of the steppes of Eastern Asia they poured forth in two separate streams, one of which swept into Eastern Europe, whilst the other flowed more slowly towards Persia and India. What Attila had been to Europe, Mihiragula was to India, and though the domination of the Huns did not long outlive him, the anarchy they left behind them continued for another century, until \"the land of Kuru,\" the cradle and battle-field of so many legendary heroes, produced another heroic figure, who, as King Harsha, filled for more than forty years (606-648) the stage of Indian history with his exploits. He had inherited the blood of the Gupta emperors from his mother, though his father was only a small Raja of Thanesvar, to the north of Delhi. The tragic circumstances in which he succeeded him made a man of him at the early age of fourteen. By the time he was twenty he was \"master of the five Indias\"--_i.e._ of nearly the whole of Northern India from Kathiawar to the delta of the Ganges, and henceforth he proved himself as great in peace as in war. In his case the knowledge we owe to Chinese sources is supplemented by the valuable record left by the Brahman Bana, who lived at his court and wrote the Harsha-Charita. Taxation, we are told, was lightened, and the assessment of land revenue was equitable and moderate. Security for life and property was enforced under severe but effective penalties. Education received impartial encouragement whether conducted by Brahmans or by Buddhist monks, and both as a patron of literature, which he himself cultivated by composing dramas, and as a philanthropic ruler King Harsha bestowed his favours with a fairly equal hand on Hinduism and on Buddhism alike. For Buddhism still lingered in the land, and Harsha, who was a mystic and a dreamer as well as a man of action, certainly inclined during his later years towards Buddhism, or, at least, included it in his own eclectic creed.  Hiuen-Tsang, who spent fifteen years in India during Harsha's reign, searching for the relics of early Buddhism in a land from which it was steadily disappearing, has given us a wonderful picture of a religious state-pageant which makes Prayaga, at the triple confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna with the sacred but invisible river, Saraswati, near to the modern city of Allahabad, stand out as another striking landmark in Indian history. Hindus attach great holiness to rivers and their confluence, and this Triveni, or triple confluence, had been specially consecrated by Brahma, who chose that spot for the first _Asvamedha_. \"From ancient times,\" says the Chinese chronicler, \"the kings used to go there to distribute alms, and hence it was known as the Place of Almsgiving. According to tradition more merit is gained by giving one piece of money there than one hundred thousand elsewhere.\" So King Harsha having invited all alike, whether \"followers of the law or heretics, the ascetics and the poor, the orphans and the helpless,\" the kings of eighteen subordinate kingdoms assembled there with their people to the number of 500,000, and found immense refectories laid out for their refreshment, and long rows of warehouses to receive silk and cotton garments and gold and silver coins for distribution to them. \"The first day a statue of Buddha was placed in the shrine erected on the Place of Almsgiving, and there was a distribution of the most precious things and of the garments of greatest value, whilst exquisite viands were served and flowers scattered to the sound of harmonious music. Then all retired to their resting-places. On the second day a statue of the Sun-god was placed in the shrine, and on the third day the statue of Shiva,\" and the distribution of gifts continued on those days and day after day for a period of over two months, ten thousand Brahmans receiving the lion's share, until, having exhausted all his wealth, even to the jewels and garments he was wearing, King Harsha borrowed a coarse and much-worn garment, and having \"adored the Buddhas of the ten countries,\" he gave vent to his pious delight, exclaiming: \"Whilst I was amassing all this wealth I was always afraid lest I should find no safe and secret place to stow it away. Now that I have deposited it by alms-giving in the Field of Happiness I know that it is for ever in safety. I pray that in my future lives I may amass in like manner great treasures and give them away in alms so as to obtain the ten divine faculties in all their plenitude.\"  Here one sees India as it was before the Mahomedan invasions, in the days of the last of the great Indian rulers who succeeded for a time in bending the whole of Northern India to his will. As always in India, behind whatever form of temporal power might for the moment appear to be paramount, religion and the social order which it consecrates represented the real paramount power that alone endures. In this extraordinary festival which marked the close of Harsha's reign the picture left to us is singularly complete. The first day is a sort of farewell tribute to the waning glory of Buddha, and the second to the ancient majesty of the Vedic gods; but they only prepare the way for the culminating worship, on the third day, of the terrific figure of Shiva, who had already been raised to one of the highest, if not the highest, throne in the Hindu pantheon, which he still retains--Shiva, the master of life and death, whose favourite emblem is the phallus, and from whose third eye bursts forth the flame which is one day to consume the world. Around Harsha, and devouring his gifts until, at the end of two months, they are wholly exhausted, are the Brahmans, \"born above the world, assigned to guard the treasury of duties, civil and religious,\" through whom alone the wrath of angry gods can be appeased and present and future life be made safe in the descending hierarchy of caste.  Shortly after Harsha's death in A.D. 648, India, as is her wont as soon as the strong man's arm is paralysed, relapses once more into political chaos. Her history does not indeed ever again recede into the complete obscurity of earlier ages.

London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, Northumberland Avenue, W.C. New York: E. & J.B. Young & Co. [Published under the direction of the General Literature Committee.]             DEDICATED TO MY DEAR SISTER, UNDINE MARCIA GATTY.       J.H.E.         \"Know'st thou not the little path     That winds about the Ferny brae,     That is the road to bonnie Elfland,     Where thou and I this night maun gae.\"      _Thomas the Rhymer_.     PREFACE.   As the title of this story-book may possibly suggest that the tales are old fairy tales told afresh, it seems well to explain that this is not so.  Except for the use of common \"properties\" of Fairy Drama, and a scrupulous endeavour to conform to tradition in local colour and detail, the stories are all new.  They have appeared at intervals during some years past in \"AUNT JUDY'S MAGAZINE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE,\" and were written in conformity to certain theories respecting stories of this kind, with only two of which shall the kindly reader of prefaces be troubled.  First, that there are ideas and types, occurring in the myths of all countries, which are common properties, to use which does not lay the teller of fairy tales open to the charge of plagiarism. Such as the idea of the weak outwitting the strong; the failure of man to choose wisely when he may have his wish; or the desire of sprites to exchange their careless and unfettered existence for the pains and penalties of humanity, if they may thereby share in the hopes of the human soul.  Secondly, that in these household stories (the models for which were originally oral tradition) the thing most to be avoided is a discursive or descriptive style of writing. Brevity and epigram must ever be soul of their wit, and they should be written as tales that are told.  The degree in which, if at all, the following tales fulfil these conditions, nursery critics must decide.  There are older critics before whom fairy tales, as such, need excuse, even if they do not meet with positive disapprobation.  On this score I can only say that, for myself, I believe them to be--beyond all need of defence--most valuable literature for the young. I do not believe that wonder-tales confuse children's ideas of truth. If there are young intellects so imperfect as to be incapable of distinguishing between fancy and falsehood, it is surely most desirable to develop in them the power to do so; but, as a rule, in childhood we appreciate the distinction with a vivacity which, as elders, our care-clogged memories fail to recall.  Moreover fairy tales have positive uses in education, which no cramming of facts, and no merely domestic fiction can serve.  Like Proverbs and Parables, they deal with first principles under the simplest forms. They convey knowledge of the world, shrewd lessons of virtue and vice, of common sense and sense of humour, of the seemly and the absurd, of pleasure and pain, success and failure, in narratives where the plot moves briskly and dramatically from a beginning to an end. They treat, not of the corner of a nursery or a playground, but of the world at large, and life in perspective; of forces visible and invisible; of Life, Death, and Immortality.  For causes obvious to the student of early myths, they foster sympathy with nature, and no class of child-literature has done so much to inculcate the love of animals.  They cultivate the Imagination, that great gift which time and experience lead one more and more to value--handmaid of Faith, of Hope, and, perhaps most of all, of Charity!  It is true that some of the old fairy tales do not teach the high and useful lessons that most of them do; and that they unquestionably deal now and again with phases of grown-up life, and with crimes and catastrophes, that seem unsuitable for nursery entertainment.  As to the latter question, it must be remembered that the brevity of the narrative--whether it be a love story or a robber story--deprives it of all harm; a point which writers of modern fairy tales do not always realize for their guidance.  The writer of the following tales has endeavoured to bear this principle in mind, and it is hoped that the morals--and it is of the essence of fairy tales to have a moral--of all of them are beyond reproach.  For the rest they are committed to the indulgence of the gentle reader.  Hans Anderssen, perhaps the greatest writer of modern fairy tales, was content to say:      \"FAIRY TALE NEVER DIES.\"      J.H.E.     CONTENTS.

There was once upon a time a child who had Good Luck for his godfather.  \"I am not Fortune,\" said Good Luck to the parents; \"I have no gifts to bestow, but whenever he needs help I will be at hand.\"  \"Nothing could be better,\" said the old couple. They were delighted. But what pleases the father often fails to satisfy the son: moreover, every man thinks that he deserves just a little more than he has got, and does not reckon it to the purpose if his father had less.  Many a one would be thankful to have as good reasons for contentment as he who had Good Luck for his godfather.  If he fell, Good Luck popped something soft in the way to break his fall; if he fought, Good Luck directed his blows, or tripped up his adversary; if he got into a scrape, Good Luck helped him out of it; and if ever Misfortune met him, Good Luck contrived to hustle her on the pathway till his godson got safely by.  In games of hazard the godfather played over his shoulder. In matters of choice he chose for him. And when the lad began to work on his father's farm the farmer began to get rich. For no bird or field-mouse touched a seed that his son had sown, and every plant he planted throve when Good Luck smiled on it.  The boy was not fond of work, but when he did go into the fields, Good Luck followed him.  \"Your christening-day was a blessed day for us all,\" said the old farmer.  \"He has never given me so much as a lucky sixpence,\" muttered Good Luck's godson.  \"I am not Fortune--I make no presents,\" said the godfather.  When we are discontented it is oftener to please our neighbours than ourselves. It was because the other boys had said--\"Simon, the shoemaker's son, has an alderman for his godfather. He gave him a silver spoon with the Apostle Peter for the handle; but thy godfather is more powerful than any alderman\"--that Good Luck's godson complained, \"He has never given me so much as a bent sixpence.\"  By and by the old farmer died, and his son grew up, and had the largest farm in the country. The other boys grew up also, and as they looked over the farmer's boundary-wall, they would say:  \"Good-morning, Neighbour. That is certainly a fine farm of yours. Your cattle thrive without loss. Your crops grow in the rain and are reaped with the sunshine. Mischance never comes your road. What you have worked for you enjoy. Such success would turn the heads of poor folk like us. At the same time one would think a man need hardly work for his living at all who has Good Luck for his godfather.\"  \"That is very true,\" thought the farmer. \"Many a man is prosperous, and reaps what he sows, who had no more than the clerk and the sexton for gossips at his christening.\"  \"What is the matter, Godson?\" asked Good Luck, who was with him in the field.  \"I want to be rich,\" said the farmer.  \"You will not have to wait long,\" replied the godfather. \"In every field you sow, in every flock you rear there is increase without abatement. Your wealth is already tenfold greater than your father's.\"  \"Aye, aye,\" replied the farmer. \"Good wages for good work. But many a young man has gold at his command who need never turn a sod, and none of the Good People came to _his_ christening. Fortunatus's Purse now, or even a sack or two of gold--\"  \"Peace!\" cried the godfather; \"I have said that I give no gifts.\"  Though he had not Fortunatus's Purse, the farmer had now money and to spare, and when the harvest was gathered in, he bought a fine suit of clothes, and took his best horse and went to the royal city to see the sights.  The pomp and splendour, the festivities and fine clothes dazzled him.  \"This is a gay life which these young courtiers lead,\" said he. \"A man has nothing to do but to enjoy himself.\"  \"If he has plenty of gold in his pocket,\" said a bystander.  By and by the Princess passed in her carriage. She was the King's only daughter. She had hair made of sunshine, and her eyes were stars.  \"What an exquisite creature!\" cried the farmer. \"What would not one give to possess her?\"  \"She has as many suitors as hairs on her head,\" replied the bystander. \"She wants to marry the Prince of Moonshine, but he only dresses in silver, and the King thinks he might find a richer son-in-law. The Princess will go to the highest bidder.\"  \"And I have Good Luck for my godfather, and am not even at court!\" cried the farmer; and he put spurs to his horse, and rode home.  Good Luck was taking care of the farm.  \"Listen, Godfather!\" cried the young man. \"I am in love with the King's daughter, and want her to wife.\"  \"It is not an easy matter,\" replied Good Luck, \"but I will do what I can for you. Say that by good luck you saved the Princess's life, or perhaps better the King's--for they say he is selfish--\"  \"Tush!\" cried the farmer. \"The King is covetous, and wants a rich son-in-law.\"  \"A wise man may bring wealth to a kingdom with "]]]
