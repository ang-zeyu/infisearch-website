Knowing your interest in Mademoiselle Julie, I thought it would not displease you to hear this. Chastel is no vast distance from this point.\"  A blush would have been visible on John's face had he not been tanned so deeply, but he felt no resentment. Captain Colton took his cigarette from his lips and said tersely:  \"Every man likes a pretty face. Man who doesn't--no man at all.\"  \"I agree with you, Captain Colton,\" said Weber heartily. \"When I no longer notice a beautiful woman I think it will be time for me to die. But I take no liberty, sir, when I say that in all the garden of flowers Mademoiselle Julie Lannes is the rarest and loveliest. She is the delicate and opening rose touched at dawn with pearly dew.\"  \"A poet, Weber! A poet!\" interjected Captain Colton.  \"No, sir, I but speak the truth,\" said Weber seriously. \"Mademoiselle Julie Lannes, though a young girl but yet, promises to become the most beautiful woman in Europe, and beauty carries with it many privileges. Men may have political equality, but women can never have an equality of looks.\"  \"Right, Weber,\" said Captain Colton.  John's pulses had begun to leap. Julie was coming back to the front, and she would not be so far away. Some day he might see her again. But he felt anxiety.  \"Is the journey to Chastel safe, after she leaves the railway?\" he asked of Weber.  \"Is anything safe now?\"  \"Nothing in Europe,\" interjected Captain Colton.  \"But I don't think Mademoiselle Lannes will incur much danger,\" said Weber. \"It's true, roving bands of Uhlans or hussars sometimes pass in our rear, but it's likely that she and other French girls going to the front march under strong escort.\"  His tone was reassuring, but his words left John still troubled.  \"My object in telling you of Mademoiselle Lannes' movements, Mr. Scott,\" continued Weber, \"was to enable you to notify Lieutenant Lannes of her exact location in case you should see him. Knowing your great friendship I thought it inevitable that you two should soon meet once more. If so, tell him that his sister is at Chastel. He will be glad to know of her arrival and, work permitting, will hurry to her there.\"  \"Gladly I'll do it,\" said John. \"I wish I could see Philip now.\"  But when he said \"Philip\" he was thinking of Julie, although the bond of friendship between him and young Lannes had not diminished one whit.  \"And now,\" said Weber, \"with Captain Colton's permission I'll go. My duties take me southward, and night is coming fast.\"  \"And it will be dark, cold and snowy,\" said John, shivering a little. \"These trenches are not exactly palace halls, but I'd rather be in them now than out there on such a night.\"  The dusk had come and the French fire was dying. In a few more minutes it would cease entirely, and then the French hour with the guns having matched the German hour, the night would be without battle.  But the silence that succeeded the thunder of the guns was somber. In all that terrible winter John had not seen a more forbidding night. The snow increased and with it came a strong wind that reached them despite their shelter. The muddy trenches began to freeze lightly, but the men's feet broke through the film of ice and they walked in an awful slush. It seemed impossible that the earth could ever have been green and warm and sunny, and that Death was not always sitting at one's elbow.  The darkness was heavy, but nevertheless as they talked they did not dare to raise their heads above the trenches. The German searchlights might blaze upon them at any moment, showing the mark for the sharpshooters. But Captain Colton pressed his electric torch and the three in the earthy alcove saw one another well.  \"Will you go to Chastel yourself?\" asked John of Weber.  \"Not at present. I bear a message which takes me in the Forest of Argonne, but I shall return along this line in a day or two, and it may be that I can reach the village. If so, I shall tell Mademoiselle Julie and the Picards that I have seen you here, and perhaps I can communicate also with Lannes.\"  \"I thank you for your kindness in coming to tell me this.\"  \"It was no more than I should have done. I knew you would be glad to hear, and now, with your permission, Captain Colton, I'll go.\"  \"Take narrow, transverse trench, leading south. Good of you to see us,\" said the captain of the Strangers.  The Alsatian shook hands with John and disappeared in the cut which led a long distance from the front. Colton extinguished the torch and the two sat a little while in the darkness. Although vast armies faced one another along a front of four hundred miles, little could be heard where John and his captain sat, save the sighing of the wind and the faint sound made by the steady fall of the snow, which was heaping up at their feet.  Not a light shone in the trench. John knew that innumerable sentinels were on guard, striving to see and hear, but a million or two million men lay buried alive there, while the snow drifted down continually. The illusion that the days of primeval man had come back was strong upon him again. They had become, in effect, cave-dwellers once more, and their chief object was to kill. He listened to the light swish of the snow, and thought of the blue heights into which he had often soared with Lannes.  Captain Colton lighted another cigarette and it glowed in the dark.  \"Uncanny,\" he said.  \"I find it more so than usual tonight,\" said John. \"Maybe it's the visit of Weber that makes me feel that way, recalling to me that I was once a man, a civilized human being who bathed regularly and who put on clean clothes at frequent intervals.\"  \"Such days may come again--for some of us.\"  \"So they may. But it's ghastly here, holed up like animals for the winter.\"  \"Comparison not fair to animals. They choose snug dens. Warm leaves and brush all about 'em.\"  \"While we lie or stand in mud or snow. After all, Captain, the animals have more sense in some ways than we. They kill one another only for food, while we kill because of hate or ignorance.\"  \"Mostly ignorance.\"  \"I suppose so. Hear that! It's a pleasant sound.\"  \"So it is. Makes me think of home.\"  Some one further down the trench was playing a mouth organ. It was merely a thin stream of sound, but it had a soft seductive note. The tune was American, a popular air. It was glorified so far away and in such terrible places, and John suddenly grew sick for home and the pleasant people in the sane republic beyond the seas. But he crushed the emotion and listened in silence as the player played on.  \"A hundred of those little mouth-organs reached our brigade this morning,\" said Colton. \"Men in the trenches must have something to lift up their minds, and little things outside current of war will do it.\"  It was a long speech for him to make and John felt its truth, but he atoned for it by complete silence while they listened to many tunes, mostly American, played on the mouth-organ. John's mind continually went back to the great republic overseas, so safe and so sane. While he was listening to the thin tinkle in the dark and snowy trench his friends were going to the great opera house in New York to hear \"Aida\" or \"Lohengrin\" maybe. And yet he would not have been back there. The wish did not occur to him. Through the dark and the snow he saw the golden hair and the deep blue eyes of Julie Lannes float before him, and it pleased him too to think that he was a minute part in the huge event now shaking the world.  A sudden white light blazed through the snow, and then was gone, like a flash of lightning.  \"German searchlight seeking us out,\" said Colton.  \"I wonder what they want,\" said John. \"They can't be thinking of a rush on such a night as this.\"  \"Don't know, but must be on guard. Better return to your station and warn everybody as you go along. You can use your torch, but hold it low.\"  As John walked back he saw by the light of his little electric torch men sound asleep on the narrow shelves they had dug in the side of the trench, their feet and often a shoulder covered with the drifting snow. Strange homes were these fitted up with the warriors' arms and clothes, and now and then with some pathetic little gift from home.  He met other men on guard like himself walking up and down the trench and also carrying similar torches. He found Carstairs and Wharton still awake, and occupied as they were when he had left them.  \"What was it, Scott?\" asked Carstairs. \"Has the British army taken Berlin?\"  \"No, nor has the German army taken London.\"  \"Good old London! I'd like to drop down on it for a while just now.\"  \"They say that at night it's as black as this trench. Zeppelins!\"  \"I could find my way around it in the dark. I'd go to the Ritz or the Carlton and order the finest dinner for three that the most experienced chef ever heard of. You don't know how good a dinner I can give--if I only have the money. I invite you both to become my guests in London as soon as this war is over and share my gustatory triumph.\"  \"I accept,\" said John.  \"And I too,\" said Wharton, \"though we may have to send to Berlin for our captive host.\"  \"Never fear,\" said Carstairs. \"I wasn't born to be taken. What did Captain Colton want with you, Scott, if it's no great military or state secret?\"  \"To see Fernand Weber, the Alsatian, whom you must remember.\"  \"Of course we recall him! Didn't we take that dive in the river together? But he's an elusive chap, regular will-o'-the-wisp, messenger and spy of ours, and other things too, I suppose.\"  \"He's done me some good turns,\" said John. \"Been pretty handy several times when I needed a handy man most. He brought news that Mademoiselle Julie Lannes and her servants, the Picards, father and daughter, are on their way to or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15285"],["title","The Hosts of the Air (#3)"],["body"," at Chastel, a little village not far from here, where the French have established a huge hospital for the wounded. She left Paris in obedience to a letter from her brother, and we are to tell Philip if we should happen to see him.\"  \"Pretty girl! Deucedly pretty!\" said Carstairs.  \"I don't think the somewhat petty adjective 'pretty' is at all adequate,\" said John with dignity.  \"Maybe not,\" said Carstairs, noticing the earnest tone in his comrade's voice. \"She's bound to become a splendid woman. Is Weber still with the captain?\"  \"No, he's gone on his mission, whatever it is.\"  \"A fine night for travel,\" said Wharton sardonically. \"A raw wind, driving snow, pitchy darkness, slush and everything objectionable underfoot. Yet I'd like to be in Weber's place. A curse upon the man who invented life in the trenches! Of all the dirty, foul, squalid monotony it is this!\"  \"You'll have to curse war first,\" said John. \"War made the trench.\"  \"Here comes a man with an electric torch,\" said Carstairs. \"Something is going to happen in our happy lives.\"  They saw the faint glimmer of the torch held low, and an orderly arrived with a message from Captain Colton, commanding them to wake everybody and to stand to their arms. Then the orderly passed quickly on with similar orders for others.  \"Old Never Sleep,\" said Carstairs, referring to Colton, \"thinks we get too much rest. Why couldn't he let us tuck ourselves away in our mud on a night like this?\"  \"I fancy it's not restlessness,\" said John. \"The order doubtless comes from a further and higher source. Good old Papa Vaugirard is not more than a quarter of a mile away.\"  \"I hear they had to enlarge the trench for him,\" grumbled Carstairs. \"He's always bound to keep us stirring.\"  \"But he watches over us like a father. They say his troops are in the best condition of all.\"  The three young men traveled about the vast burrow along the main trenches, the side trenches and those connecting. The order to be on guard was given everywhere, and the men dragged themselves from their sodden beds. Then they took their rifles and were ready. But it was dark save for the glimmer of the little pocket electrics.  The task finished, the three returned to their usual position. John did not know what to expect. It might be a device of Papa Vaugirard to drag them out of a dangerous lethargy, but he did not think so. A kind heart dwelled in the body of the huge general, and he would not try them needlessly on a wild and sullen night. But whatever the emergency might be the men were ready and on the right of the Strangers was that Paris regiment under Bougainville. What a wonderful man Bougainville had proved himself to be! Fiery and yet discreet, able to read the mind of the enemy, liked by his men whom nevertheless he led where the danger was greatest. John was glad that the Paris regiment lay so close.  \"Nothing is going to happen,\" said Carstairs. \"Why can't I lay me down on my little muddy shelf and go to sleep? Nobody would send a dog out on such a night!\"  \"Man will often go where a dog won't,\" said Wharton, sententiously.  \"And the night is growing worse,\" continued Carstairs. \"Hear that wind howl! Why, it's driving the snow before it in sheets! The trenches won't dry out in a week!\"  \"You might be worth hearing if you'd only quit talking and say something, Carstairs,\" said Wharton.  \"If you obeyed that rule, Wharton, you'd be known as the dumb man.\"  John stood up straight and looked over the trench toward the German lines, where he saw nothing. The night filled with so much driving snow had become a kind of white gloom, less penetrable than the darkness.  Only that shifting white wall met his gaze, and listen as he would, he could hear nothing. The feeling of something sinister and uncanny, something vast and mighty returned. Man had made war for ages, but never before on so huge a scale.  \"Well, Sister Anna, otherwise John Scott, make your report,\" said Carstairs lightly. \"What do you see?\"  \"Only a veil of snow so thick that my eyes can't penetrate it.\"  \"And that's all you will see. Papa Vaugirard is a good man and he cares for his many children, but he's making a mistake tonight.\"  \"I think not,\" said John, dropping suddenly back into the trench. A blinding white glare, cutting through the gloom of the snow, had dazzled him for a moment.  \"The searchlight again!\" exclaimed Wharton.  \"And it means something,\" said John.  The blaze, whiter and more intense than usual, played for a few minutes over the French trenches, sweeping to right and left and back again and then dying away at a far distant point. After it came the same white gloom and deep silence.  \"Just a way of greeting,\" said Carstairs.  \"I think not,\" said John. \"Papa Vaugirard makes few mistakes. To my mind the intensity of the silence is sinister. Often we hear the Germans singing in their trenches, but now we hear nothing.\"  Another half-hour of the long and trying waiting followed. Then the white light flared again for a moment, and powerful lights behind the French lines flared back, but did not go out. The great beams, shooting through the white gloom, disclosed masses of men in gray uniforms and spiked helmets rushing forward.     CHAPTER II  THE YOUNG AUSTRIAN   It seemed to John that the heavy German masses were almost upon them, when they were revealed in the glare of the searchlights, sweeping forward in solid masses, and uttering a tremendous hurrah. But the French lights continued to throw an intense vivid white blaze over the advancing columns, broad German faces and stalwart German figures standing out vividly. Officers, reckless of death, waving their swords and shouting the word of command, led them on.  The French field guns behind their trenches opened, sending showers of missiles over their heads and into the charging ranks, and the trenches themselves blazed with the fire of the rifles.  \"A surprise that isn't a surprise?\" shouted Carstairs. \"They thought to catch us napping in the night and the snow!\"  The battle spread with astonishing rapidity over a front of more than a mile, and in the driving snow and white gloom it assumed a frightful character. The German guns fired for a little while over their troops at the French artillery beyond, but soon ceased lest they pour shells into their own men, and the heavy French batteries ceased also, lest they, too, mow down friend as well as foe. But the light machine guns posted in the trenches kept up a rapid and terrible crackle. The front lines of the Germans were cut down again and again, always to be replaced by fresh men, who unflinchingly exposed their bodies to the deadly hail.  \"The massed attack!\" exclaimed Wharton. \"What courage! Nobody was ever more willing to die for victory than these Germans!\"  Even in the moment of danger and utmost excitement he could not refuse tribute to the enemy. Nevertheless he snatched up a rifle and was firing as fast as he could into the gray ranks. John and Carstairs were doing the same and the trench held by the Strangers was a continuous red blaze. There was so much fire and smoke and so much whirling snow that John could not see clearly. He was a prey to illusions. Now the Germans were apparently at the very edge of the trench, and then they were further away than he had first seen them. The white gloom was shot with a red haze, and the shouts of soldiers, the commands of officers and groans of wounded were mingled in a terrible turmoil of sound. But John knew that the Germans would be driven tack. Only surprise could have enabled them to win, and the vigilance of the French scouts had put their commanders on guard.  Captain Colton walked up and down the trench, his face ghastly white, although it was the flare of the searchlight and not any retreat of the blood that made it so. Now and then under the frightful crash of the rifles and machine guns he addressed brief words of warning and encouragement to his men:  \"Don't raise your heads too high! Keep cool! Aim at something! Here they come again! Fire low!\"  All of John's pulses were throbbing hard with excitement. He wished the Germans would go back, and his wish was prompted--less by the desire of victory than the sickening of his soul at so much slaughter. Why would their leaders continue to hurl these simple and honest peasants upon that invincible line of rifles and machine guns? The dead and wounded were piling up fast in the driving snow, but the willing servants of an emperor came on as steadily as ever to be killed. So much slaughter for so little purpose! The height of battle, excitement and danger, could not keep him from thinking of it.  Occasionally a man fell in the trench and lay in the mud and snow, but the others never ceased for a moment to send bullets into the gray masses which fell back only to come on again. Nothing but modern weapons, machine guns from which missiles fairly flowed in an unending stream, and rifles which a man fired as fast as he could pull the trigger could check them. \"Why don't they stop! Why don't they stop!\" John was shouting to himself through burned lips, and again he shuddered with sick horror, when he saw a whole line of men blown away, as if they had been grain swept by a tornado.  Once they came to the very edge of the trench to be slain there, and the body of a German fell in at John's very feet. He never knew how many times they charged, but human flesh and blood must yield, in the end, before unyielding steel, and at last through the crash and confusion the notes of trumpets sounded. Then the German masses melted away and the heavy white gloom once more enveloped the ground before the trenches from which came faint cries. The wounded lay thickly there with the dead, but neither side dared to go for them. An upright human figure would draw at once a hail of bullets.  Several machine guns still purred and crackled, but no reply came. Presently they, too, ceased, and the silence in front was complete, save for"]]]
