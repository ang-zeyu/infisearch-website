Travel!  Oh! darling--to Egypt?  \"Why Egypt?  Why not France or--or Italy?\"  \"Because I've _got_ to go to Egypt sometime or another, Dads.  I've got to see the desert and the mosques and the whites and blues and oranges and camels.  It's _in_ me _here_,\" and she thumped her nightgown above her heart.  \"I shall never be happy until I have seen them all.  Oh! Dads, I wonder if you can understand; it--it sounds so--so silly------\"  \"Tell me,\" and the man moved over to the head of the bed and took his daughter gently in his arms.  \"I'm so out of the picture, somehow, here, dearest,\" said the child, striving as best she could to describe what was really only the passing of the border-line between girl and womanhood.  \"This terrible colouring of mine, for one thing.  Why, amongst other girls, I am like a Raemaeker stuffed into a Heath Robinson folio, like a palette daubed with oils hung amongst a lot of water-colours.  I want to find my own nail and hang for one hour by myself, if it's on a barn-door or the wall of a mosque--as long as I am by myself.\"  \"Good Lord!\" said the man inwardly, as he patted his daughter's arm; then, aloud.  \"As it happens, Golliwog darling, I had a letter from _Marraine_ yesterday, asking me to let you go out to her in Cairo for the winter and see as much as possible of the ordinary sights.  We'll talk it over with Mother to-morrow.\"  \"Oh, Dads--how wonderful!  And can't you and Mother come?  And oh! _can_ I take Wellington?\"  \"I think so, dear, if he hasn't hydrophobia,\" and the man bent to pat the head of the great dog which had crept from under the bed at the sound of his name.  And later Dads stood at his window, smoking two last pipes, whilst a glimpse into the future was allowed him.  \"Can it be--can it possibly be,\" he said, puffing clouds of smoke into the creeper, to the annoyance of many insects, \"Big Ben Kelham?--and the estates run alongside.  Wonder if Teresa has noticed anything. And--by Jove!--of course!--he's at Heliopolis, getting over his hunting accident.  I wonder------\"  And Damaris sat at her window, with her arms round the dog, who longed inordinately for his mat.  \"The desert,\" she whispered.  \"The pyramids--the bazaar--life--adventure.  How _wonderful_!\"  There came a long, long pause, and then she added, as she turned towards a coloured picture of the Sphinx upon the wall, \"And who cares if the nail is a tin-tack or a screw?\"  As it happened, it was destined to be the jewel-hilted, double-edged, unsheathed dagger of love.  And Fate, having mislaid her glasses, worked her shuttle at hazard in and out of that picture of intricate pattern called Life, and having tangled and knotted together the crimson thread of passion, the golden thread of youth and the honest brown of a deep, undemonstrative love, she left the disentanglement of the muddle in the hands of Olivia, Duchess of Longacres.  Her Grace was over eighty.  Of a line of yeomen ancestors ranging back down the centuries to the William Carew who had fought for Harold, she had been, about sixty-five years ago, the belle of Devon.  Against the warnings of her heart and to the delight of her friends and family, she had married the Duke of Longacres, whose roving eye had been arrested by her beauty at a meet of the Devon and Somerset, and his equally roving heart temporarily captured by the indifference of her demeanour towards his autocratic self.  She had lost him, to all intents and purposes, two years after the marriage, but blinding her eyes and stuffing her ears, had held high her beautiful head and high her honour, filling her empty heart with the love of her son and the esteem of her legion of real friends; showing the bravest of beautiful faces to the world, until a happy widowhood had set her free.  Some years of absolute happiness of the simplest kind had followed; the marriage of her son and birth of her grandson, who had cost his mother her life.  Then the following year had come the Boer War, and the heroic tragedy of Spion Kop, which left her childless; after that, many years of utter devotion, to her grandson, who adored her; then the Great War and the Battle of the Falkland Islands, which left her absolutely bereft, with the care of the boy's greatest treasure, even the grey parrot, Quarter-Deck, Dekko for short.  Methuselah of birds, it was possessed of an uncanny gift of human speech and understanding, and had been promoted through generation to generation, from sailing-vessel _via_ Merchant Service to British Navy.  As time and tragedy worked hard together to silver her hair and line her face, so did a veritable imp of mischief, bred of her desolation, seem to possess the old darling.  She cared not a brass farthing for the opinion of her neighbours, so that after the death of the great Queen, who had been her staunchest friend, she had instructed Maria Hobson, her maid and also staunchest friend, to revive the faded roses of her cheeks with the aid of cosmetics.  Things had gone from bad to worse in that respect, until her pretty snow-white hair had been covered by a flagrant golden perruque and the dear old face with a mask of pink and white enamel.  Her eyes were blue, and keen as a hawk's, undimmed by the tears shed in secret during her tumultuous and tragic life; her teeth, each one in a perfect and pearly state of preservation, were her own, for which asset she was never given the benefit of the doubt; her tongue was vitriolic; her heart of pure gold, and she owned a right hand which said nothing to the left of the spaces between its fingers through which, daily ran deeds of kindness and streams of love towards the unfortunate ones of the earth.  Her dress was invariably of grey taffeta or brocade, bunched at the back and trailing on the ground; there were ruffles, of priceless lace at the elbow-sleeves and V-shaped neck; a plain straw poke-bonnet served for all outdoor functions, and an ebony stick, called \"the wand\" by the denizens of the slums, who adored her, completed her picturesque toilette.  The majority feared this _grande dame_, a minority, if they had had the chance, would have fawned upon her in public and laughed at or caricatured her in private; those who really knew her, and they lived principally east of London town, would willingly have laid themselves down and allowed her ridiculously small feet, invariably shod in crimson, buckled, outrageously high-heeled shoes, to trample upon their prostrate bodies, if it would have given her pleasure so to do.  She adored young things, and had an enormous family of godsons and goddaughters, out of which crowd Ben Kelham and Damaris Hethencourt were supreme favourites, and about whom she had been weaving plots when she had written her letter of invitation to the Squire.  She smoked Three Castles, which she kept in a jewelled Louis XV snuff-box, and had a perfect tartar of a maid, who simply worshipped her.  Of a truth, a long description of a very old and very wise old woman, of whom the great Queen had once remarked to her Consort:  \"I wish I were not a queen, so that _I_ might curtsey to Olivia.\"  And in this wise old woman's jewel-covered hands Fate placed the twisted threads of passion, youth and love, and a wiser selection she could not have made.  A bronchitic cough had taken her to Cairo just as a sooted-up lung, left behind by the pneumonia which had followed the hunting accident had taken Ben Kelham to Heliopolis, and for recuperation of body or mind there is nothing to equal an Egyptian winter, even in a tourist-ridden centre.  Ben Kelham, Big Ben for short, on account of his six-feet-two, was heir to Sir Andrew Kelham, Bart., whose estate joined the lands of Squire Hethencourt, whom he looked upon as his greatest friend, and vice versa.  Educated at Harrow, Ben Kelham and Hugh Carden Ali had been known on the Hill as David and Jonathan; so that the crimson, golden and brown threads were more than uncommonly twisted.  Ben was heavy in build and slow in every way, but he was still more sure than slow, and had never been known to give up when once he had set his mind to the accomplishment of a task, and although he had stood in absolute awe of beautiful Damaris since the day she had lengthened her skirts, yet had he determined to make her his wife, even if it meant following in Jacob's footsteps to the tune of waiting many years.  He had confided his determination to his godmother, who had immediately taken the case in hand, and proceeded to throw bucketsful of cold water upon his suggestion of being on the quay or doorstep to welcome the girl to Egypt.  \"My dear man,\" replied the tactful old lady as she rasped a match on the sole of a crimson shoe and lit a fragrant Three Castles, \"do remember that everything will be new to the child; she will be one vast ejaculation for at least a month.  Let her get over that, let her realise that you are close at hand, but not the least bit anxious to be under her feet, and you'll see.  Remember, she is very young, just like a bit of dough which must be stuffed with the currants and raisins of knowledge and then well-baked in the oven of experience before it can be handed across Life's counter to anyone.  Further, take care not to blunder into any little trap she may set you out of pique.\"  \"But, dearest, I always _do_ blunder when I'm out of the saddle.\"  \"Well, even if you do, for goodness' sake keep your mouth shut.  Be the strong, silent man; women love 'em.  We revel in being clubbed and pulled into the cave by the hair; we may squeal a bit for the sake of appearances, but we cook the breakfast nest morning without a murmur! But just ask us to honour the cave by placing our foot over the threshold, and as sure as anything, you'll find yourself making the early cup of tea.\"     CHAPTER IV    \"_Wide"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],["title","The Hawk of Egypt (#4)"],["body","and unguarded stand our gates,   Named by the four winds, North, South, East and West;   Portals that lead to an enchanted land. . ._\"            T. B. ALDRICH.   Damaris duly arrived in Egypt, accompanied by Wellington--who had shown no sign of incipient hydrophobia--and Jane Coop, her maid.  It were best to describe them both now, and so get it all over.  Whilst waiting one exeat upon Waterloo station, the girl had annexed unto herself a holy terror in the shape of a brindle bull-pup.  The hilarious quadruped had twined its leash about one leg of its master--who was an alien from Wapping--and the spout of a zinc watering-can which a porter had left upon the platform; for which joke it had received a vile cuff on its wrinkled physiognomy from the alien master.  Like some avenging goddess, Damaris, the ladylike, almost finished product of Onslow House, sprang straight at the man, smote him with the flat of the hand upon the face, and pounced upon the yelping pup.  \"Take your leg out of the dog's chain, you idiot!\" she cried, her eyes blazing, her perfect teeth flashing in a positive snarl.  \"Be quick; don't be so clumsy.  How dare you hit a dog.  He _hit_ him,\" she announced to the interested, sympathetic crowd.  \"Hit him on his lovely face.  \"You gif that dog back to me, missie,--he's mine.\"  \"He's mine.  I've got him, and my mother is one of the heads of the Society that protects children.\"  \"That's got nothing to do wif dogs.\"  \"This is a puppy, so it's a child,\" had come the decisive reply.  \"And I'll buy him, though I needn't really, if I refer it to the Society.\"  \"I'll take ten poun' for 'im.\"  The child fished for her purse, which, contained half-a-crown and her ticket, and flung it with a supreme gesture of contempt at the man's feet; then, squeezing up the dog in her arms, tore a simple gold bracelet off her left arm and flung it after the purse.  \"Worv two poun' at the mos'.\"  Then, from out of a first-class carriage of the train waiting to start for Southampton slowly descended Olivia, Duchess of Longacres.  The girl and the alien had their backs turned to her, but the crowd had seen; had looked; started to laugh, and then had become silent, so great was the dignity of the old lady.  Clad in a voluminous grey taffeta gown, from under which peeped little crimson shoes; covered with a huge loose ermine wrap, with the black poke-bonnet on top of the outrageous golden perruque and the grey parrot bobbing up and down excitedly upon her shoulder, she stood silently taking in the scene.  There was the light of battle in the famous hawk's-eyes as she listened to the girl defending the pup, and her splendid teeth shone in a grin of enjoyment as she suddenly rattled her ebony stick upon the alien's ankle-bones, those most tender bits of anatomical scaffolding.  There was a yell of pain as the alien backed hastily into the arms of a lusty youth who had continuously besought Damaris, to allow him \"ter put it acrorst ther blighter's h'ugly mug,\" and a cry of delight as Damaris ran to the old lady's side and, squeezing the pup in one arm, made the sweetest little reverence in the pretty continental way before she excitedly wrung her god-mother's hand.  \"_Marraine_, he hit the puppy, and I've bought him for ten pounds; at least, Dad will send a cheque tonight.  I've given him half-a-crown and my bracelet on account.\"  \"Call Hobson,\" said her grace to the bird, who, obeying, had shrilly piped, \"Tumble up, men, tumble up,\" until Hobson the maid suddenly surged, from the second-class and ploughed her way through the delighted crowd.  \"Give the purse and bracelet to my maid, you------\"  \"Swab,\" supplemented the parrot.  \"-----at once,\" finished her grace, just as, with a cry of \"Here's Dad!\"  Damaris ran to meet her father, who, having got hung up in the traffic, had failed to meet the train.  He listened patiently, with dancing eyes, to the story, smiled across at the duchess, gave the man a pound-note and a jolly good talking to, and acquired a bull pup with the Rodney Stone strain, which they promptly christened Wellington, as it had won at Waterloo.  Wellington forthwith developed an inordinate jealousy of Jane Coop.  Jane Coop was maid, adviser and buffer to the girl whom she loved more than anyone on earth.  Born on the Squire's lands, she had developed a positive genius for mothering delicate lambs and calves and sickly chicks, so that when a crisis had arrived almost immediately after the birth of Damaris, the Squire had bundled the highly-certificated nurse into a motor and sent her packing back to London, and called upon Jane Coop to rise to the occasion.  She had risen.  Bonny and plump, she had taken the weakly little bit of humanity, also the situation, into her strong, capable hands; treated the mother and babe just as she would have treated a couple of delicate lambs, and pulled them both through.  From that day forth she had dominated the house, tyrannised over the Squire and his lady, defied each and every governess who had shown signs of undue strictness, and found her reward for her devotion in the love of the child who teased her to death and--in the long run--obeyed her.  She had shown herself a positive sheep-dog on board the boat.  She had rounded up her white lamb and yapped upon the heels of those who dared approach with too great familiarity; had bristled and shown her teeth upon every possible occasion, until those who would fain have led the girl into new and verdant pastures had fled at the sheep-dog's approach, leaving them both to enjoy the novelty of everything, each after her own kind.  Damaris revelled in it all: the seagulls; the lighthouses; the ships that passed in the day and night; and the tail-end of a storm they hit up in the Bay, whilst Jane Coop invented new verses to the Litany as she tried, in her cabin, to solve the problem of two into one, and Wellington, somewhere under the water-line, daily gave a fine imitation of hell-bound to a circle of admiring seamen.  To his last hour at sea Captain X will forever retain the memory of what it cost him in strength of will to maintain his dignity, when, standing straight and exceedingly beautiful, with one hand full of lists, the huge bulldog at her feet, with a black bow under his left ear, and an assembly of the greatest sufferers before her, Damaris, two days before arriving at Port Said, solemnly read out the items and the shop price of each article chewed, damaged or totally destroyed during the voyage by the dog.  \"Shoes, boots, pants, edges of trousers; two pipes, one pouch, six packets of gaspers; one entire tray of crockery; one air-cushion dropped in fright by stewardess; one coil of rope, one life-buoy, one tin can dented, one man's ankles slightly bruised; one bare patch to ship's cat's back. . . .\"  And so on and so forth; whilst murmurs arose from the sufferers, who chorused that \"they didn't want no compensation, only too pleased to part with their bits, as long . . .\" etc., etc.  \"I do not think the fault was all on one side, Miss Hethencourt,\" summed up the Captain, speaking in guttural consonant and flattened vowel from suppressed emotion.  \"The--er--the plaintiff must have approached the dog as he was chained and------\"  \"A bulldog,\" broke in Damaris, \"is a magnet to the best in every human being.  They simply could not help themselves; they were drawn within reach of his teeth; they----\"  \"I cannot quite------\" interrupted the captain.  \"Yes?\"  Chips, the carpenter, showed signs of bursting with information withheld.  \"Beggin' your pardon for interruption, sir, but what; the lady says is true; we just couldn't keep away.  I saw the Chink--beg pardon, sir, I mean Ling-a-Ling the laundryman, burning joss-sticks in front of 'im,\"--pointing of stub finger towards shameless dog--\"one night when the dawg was asleep.  Jus' worship, please, sir, on all parts.  And Mrs. Pudge what didn't oughter 'ave been down in our quarters, dropped the air cushion, sir, 'cause she missed in stays------\"  \"I cannot,\" interrupted the captain--then choked at a mental vision of Mrs. Pudge, who scorned such frivolous inventions as whalebone to support the figure--then trumpeted behind his handkerchief, ending in that combined half-snort, half-giggle which is so disastrous to dignity and complexion, \"I cannot allow the--the--er--form of the Company's stewardesses to be so discussed.\"  \"Beggin' yer pardon, sir,\" fiercely rejoined Chips--who was getting a bit of his own back on Mrs. Pudge--\"I'm using the nautical expression, sir; she failed to get about when that there dawg\"--pointing of stub thumb at heedless dog--\"growled 'cause she has water in the knee.  I'm usin' a an--anatomical expression now, sir--her knee--this, sir\"--slapping of knee with horny hand of toil--\"The ship's knees, miss,\" addressing Damaris, whose straight brows had almost met in puzzlement, \"is a chock on the forepart of the lowermast on which the 'eel--heel, miss, of the topmast rests.  Yuss, sir.  Her knee may 'ave water in it; but no one couldn't say the same of her _grog_.\"  To prevent death from combustion, the speechless captain here intimated by signs that the culprit should stand up.  And the brindle of Rodney Stone strain stood, whilst the men's eyes glistened as they fidgeted upon their feet from very joy in the spectacle.  His skull was massive and perfectly-shaped, the under-jaw square and strong, thrust up and beyond the upper; the teeth were perfect, even, large and also strong; the nose was black and large, well back between the eyes, which were set low down and wide apart, but well in front and round, with a deep \"stop\" between them; the honestest outward sign of his gallant loving heart.  The ears were rose; not in colour, of course, but of rose-leaf shape, set high and small and fine; the face was closely-wrinkled, the \"chop\" well down, and the loose skin in abundant folds about his throat and neck.  The chest was wide and deep and prominent; the"]]]
