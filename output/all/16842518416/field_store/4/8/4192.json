(Herald) for the _Satirist_!\" shouted another. \"Bell's _Life_ for the _Bull_! _The Spectator_ for the _Sunday Times_!\"  The approach of our sportsmen was the signal for a change of the chorus, and immediately Jorrocks was assailed with \"A hunter! a hunter! crikey, a hunter! My eyes! there's a gamecock for you! Vot a beauty! Vere do you turn out to-day? Vere's the stag? Don't tumble off, old boy! 'Ave you got ever a rope in your pocket? Take Bell's _Life in London_, vot contains all the sporting news of the country! Vot a vip the gemman's got! Vot a precious basternadering he could give us--my eyes, vot a swell!--vot a shocking bad hat!_[8]--vot shocking bad breeches!\"  [Footnote 8: \"Vot a shocking bad hat!\"--a slang cockney phrase of 1831.]  The fog, which became denser at every step, by the time they reached St. Clement's Danes rendered their further progress almost impossible.--\"Oh, dear! oh, dear! how unlucky,\" exclaimed Jorrocks, \"I would have given twenty pounds of best Twankay for a fine day--and see what a thing we've got! Hold my 'oss,\" said he to the Yorkshireman, \"while I run into the 'Angel,' and borrow an argand burner, or we shall be endorsed[9] to a dead certainty.\" Off he got, and ran to the inn. Presently he emerged from the yard--followed by horse-keepers, coach-washers, porters, cads, waiters and others, amid loud cries of \"Flare up, flare up, old cock! talliho fox-hunter!\"--with a bright mail-coach footboard lamp, strapped to his middle, which, lighting up the whole of his broad back now cased in scarlet, gave him the appearance of a gigantic red-and-gold insurance office badge, or an elderly cherub without wings.  [Footnote 9: City--for having a pole run into one's rear.]  The hackney-coach-and cab-men, along whose lines they passed, could not make him out at all. Some thought he was a mail-coach guard riding post with the bags; but as the light was pretty strong he trotted on regardless of observation. The fog, however, abated none of its denseness even on the \"Surrey side,\" and before they reached the \"Elephant and Castle,\" Jorrocks had run against two trucks, three watercress women, one pies-all-ot!-all-ot! man, dispersed a whole covey of Welsh milkmaids, and rode slap over one end of a buy 'at (hat) box! bonnet-box! man's pole, damaging a dozen paste-boards, and finally upsetting Balham Hill Joe's Barcelona \"come crack 'em and try 'em\" stall at the door of the inn, for all whose benedictions, the Yorkshireman, as this great fox-hunting knight-errant's \"Esquire,\" came in.  Here the Yorkshireman would fain have persuaded Mr. Jorrocks to desist from his quixotic undertaking, but he turned a deaf ear to his entreaties. \"We are getting fast into the country, and I hold it to be utterly impossible for this fog to extend beyond Kennington Common--'twill ewaporate, you'll see, as we approach the open. Indeed, if I mistake not, I begin to sniff the morning air already, and hark! there's a lark a-carrolling before us!\" \"Now, spooney! where are you for?\" bellowed a carter, breaking off in the middle of his whistle, as Jorrocks rode slap against his leader, the concussion at once dispelling the pleasing pastoral delusion, and nearly knocking Jorrocks off his horse.  As they approached Brixton Hill, a large red ball of lurid light appeared in the firmament, and just at the moment up rode another member of the Surrey Hunt in uniform, whom Jorrocks hailed as Mr. Crane. \"By Jove, 'ow beautiful the moon is,\" said the latter, after the usual salutations. \"Moon!\" said Mr. Jorrocks, \"that's not never no moon--I reckon it's Mrs. Graham's balloon.\" \"Come, that's a good 'un,\" said Crane, \"perhaps you'll lay me an 'at about it\". \"Done!\" said Mr. Jorrocks, \"a guinea one--and we'll ax my friend here.--Now, what's that?\" \"Why, judging from its position and the hour, I should say it is the sun!\" was the reply.  We have omitted to mention that this memorable day was a Saturday, one on which civic sportsmen exhibit. We may also premise, that the particular hunt we are about to describe, took place when there were very many packs of hounds within reach of the metropolis, all of which boasted their respective admiring subscribers. As our party proceeded they overtook a gentleman perusing a long bill of the meets for the next week, of at least half a dozen packs, the top of the list being decorated with a cut of a stag-hunt, and the bottom containing a notification that hunters were \"carefully attended to by Charles Morton,[10] at the 'Derby Arms,' Croydon,\" a snug rural _auberge_ near the barrack. On the hunting bill-of-fare, were Mr. Jolliffe's foxhounds, Mr. Meager's harriers, the Derby staghounds, the Sanderstead harriers, the Union foxhounds, the Surrey foxhounds, rabbit beagles on Epsom Downs, and dwarf foxhounds on Woolwich Common. What a list to bewilder a stranger! The Yorkshireman left it all to Mr. Jorrocks.  [Footnote 10: Where the carrion is, there will be the crow, and on the demise of the \"Surrey staggers,\" Charley brushed off to the west, to valet the gentlemen's hunters that attend the Royal Stag Hunt.--_Vide_ Sir F. Grant's picture of the meet of the Royal Staghounds.]  \"You're for Jolliffe, I suppose,\" said the gentleman with the bill, to another with a blue coat and buff lining. \"He's at Chipstead Church--only six miles from Croydon, a sure find and good country.\" \"What are you for, Mr. Jorrocks?\" inquired another in green, with black velvet breeches, Hessian boots, and a red waistcoat, who just rode up. \"My own, to be sure,\" said Jorrocks, taking hold of the green collar of his coat, as much as to say, \"How can you ask such a question?\" \"Oh, no,\" said the gentleman in green, \"Come to the stag--much better sport--sure of a gallop--open country--get it over soon--back in town before the post goes out.\" Before Mr. Jorrocks had time to make a reply to this last interrogatory, they were overtaken by another horseman, who came hopping along at a sort of a butcher's shuffle, on a worn-out, three-legged, four-cornered hack, with one eye, a rat-tail, and a head as large as a fiddle-case.--\"Who's for the blue mottles?\" said he, casting a glance at their respective coats, and at length fixing it on the Yorkshireman. \"Why, Dickens, you're not going thistle-whipping with that nice 'orse of yours,\" said the gentleman in the velvets; \"come and see the stag turned out--sure of a gallop--no hedges--soft country--plenty of publics--far better sport, man, than pottering about looking for your foxes and hares, and wasting your time; take my advice, and come with me.\" \"But,\" says Dickens, \"my 'orse won't stand it; I had him in the shay till eleven last night, and he came forty-three mile with our traveller the day before, else he's a 'good 'un to go,' as you know. Do you remember the owdacious leap he took over the tinker's tent, at Epping 'Unt, last Easter? How he astonished the natives within!\" \"Yes; but then, you know, you fell head-foremost through the canvas, and no wonder your ugly mug frightened them,\" replied he of the velvets. \"Ay; but that was in consequence of my riding by balance instead of gripping with my legs,\" replied Dickens; \"you see, I had taken seven lessons in riding at the school in Bidborough Street, Burton Crescent, and they always told me to balance myself equally on the saddle, and harden my heart, and ride at whatever came in the way; and the tinker's tent coming first, why, naturally enough, I went at it. But I have had some practice since then, and, of course, can stick on better. I have 'unted regularly ever since, and can 'do the trick' now.\" \"What, summer and winter?\" said Jorrocks. \"No,\" replied he, \"but I have 'unted regularly every fifth Saturday since the 'unting began.\"  After numerous discourses similar to the foregoing, they arrived at the end of the first stage on the road to the hunt, namely, the small town of Croydon, the rendezvous of London sportsmen. The whole place was alive with red coats, green coats, blue coats, black coats, brown coats, in short, coats of all the colours of the rainbow. Horsemen were mounting, horsemen were dismounting, one-horse \"shays\" and two-horse chaises were discharging their burdens, grooms were buckling on their masters' spurs, and others were pulling off their overalls. Eschewing the \"Greyhound,\" they turn short to the right, and make for the \"Derby Arms\" hunting stables.  Charley Morton, a fine old boy of his age, was buckling on his armour for the fight, for his soul, too, was \"on fire, and eager for the chase.\" He was for the \"venison\"; and having mounted his \"deer-stalker,\" was speedily joined by divers perfect \"swells,\" in beautiful leathers, beautiful coats, beautiful tops, beautiful everything, except horses, and off they rode to cut in for the first course--a stag-hunt on a Saturday being usually divided into three.  The ride down had somewhat sharpened Jorrocks's appetite; and feeling, as he said, quite ready for his dinner, he repaired to Mr. Morton's house--a kind of sporting snuggery, everything in apple-pie order, and very good--where he baited himself on sausages and salt herrings, a basin of new milk, with some \"sticking powder\" as he called it, _alias_ rum, infused into it; and having deposited a half-quartern loaf in one pocket, as a sort of balance against a huge bunch of keys which rattled in the other, he pulled out his watch, and finding they had a quarter of an hour to spare, proposed to chaperon the Yorkshireman on a tour of the hunting stables. Jorrocks summoned the ostler, and with great dignity led the way. \"Humph,\" said he, evidently"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15387"],["title","Jorrocks' Jaunts and Jollities (#5)"],["body","at seeing half the stalls empty, \"no great show this morning--pity--gentleman come from a distance--should like to have shown him some good nags.--What sort of a devil's this?\" \"Oh, sir, he's a good 'un, and nothing but a good 'un!--Leap! Lord love ye, he'll leap anything. A railway cut, a windmill with the sails going, a navigable river with ships--anything in short. This is the 'orse wot took the line of houses down at Beddington the day they had the tremendious run from Reigate Hill.\" \"And wot's the grey in the far stall?\" \"Oh, that's Mr. Pepper's old nag--Pepper-Caster as we call him, since he threw the old gemman, the morning they met at the 'Leg-of-Mutton' at Ashtead. But he's good for nothing. Bless ye! his tail shakes for all the world like a pepper-box afore he's gone half a mile. Those be yours in the far stalls, and since they were turned round I've won a bob of a gemman who I bet I'd show him two 'osses with their heads vere their tails should be.[11] I always says,\" added he with a leer, \"that you rides the best 'osses of any gemman vot comes to our governor's.\" This flattered Jorrocks, and sidling up, he slipped a shilling into his hand, saying, \"Well--bring them out, and let's see how they look this morning.\" The stall reins are slipped, and out they step with their hoods on their quarters. One was a large, fat, full-sized chestnut, with a white ratch down the full extent of his face, a long square tail, bushy mane, with untrimmed heels. The other was a brown, about fifteen two, coarse-headed, with a rat-tail, and collar-marked. The tackle was the same as they came down with. \"You'll do the trick on that, I reckon,\" said Jorrocks, throwing his leg over the chestnut, and looking askew at the Yorkshireman as he mounted. \"Tatt., and old Tatt., and Tatt. sen. before him, all agree that they never knew a bad 'oss with a rat-tail.\"  [Footnote 11: A favourite joke among grooms when a horse is turned round in his stall.]  \"But, let me tell you, you must be werry lively, if you mean to live with our 'ounds. They go like the wind. But come! touch him with the spur, and let's do a trot.\" The Yorkshireman obeyed, and getting into the main street, onwards they jogged, right through Croydon, and struck into a line of villas of all sorts, shapes, and sizes, which extend for several miles along the road, exhibiting all sorts of architecture, Gothic, Corinthian, Doric, Ionic, Dutch, and Chinese. These gradually diminished in number, and at length they found themselves on an open heath, within a few miles of the meet of the \"Surrey foxhounds\". \"Now\", says Mr. Jorrocks, clawing up his smalls, \"you will see the werry finest pack of hounds in all England; I don't care where the next best are; and you will see as good a turn-out as ever you saw in your life, and as nice a country to ride over as ever you were in\".  They reach the meet--a wayside public-house on a common, before which the hounds with their attendants and some fifty or sixty horsemen, many of them in scarlet, were assembled. Jorrocks was received with the greatest cordiality, amid whoops and holloas, and cries of \"now Twankay!--now Sugar!--now Figs!\" Waving his hand in token of recognition, he passed on and made straight for Tom Hill, with a face full of importance, and nearly rode over a hound in his hurry. \"Now, Tom,\" said he, with the greatest energy, \"do, my good fellow, strain every nerve to show sport to-day.--A gentleman has come all the way from the north-east side of the town of Boroughbridge, in the county of York, to see our excellent 'ounds, and I would fain have him galvanised.--Do show us a run, and let it end with blood, so that he may have something to tell the natives when he gets back to his own parts. That's him, see, sitting under the yew-tree, in a bottle-green coat with basket buttons, just striking a light on the pommel of his saddle to indulge in a fumigation.--Keep your eye on him all day, and if you can lead him over an awkward place, and get him a purl, so much the better.--If he'll risk his neck I'll risk my 'oss's.\"  The Yorkshireman, having lighted his cigar and tightened his girths, rode leisurely among the horsemen, many of whom were in eager council, and a gentle breeze wafted divers scraps of conversation to his ear.  What is that hound got by? No. How is that horse bred? No. What sport had you on Wednesday? No. Is it a likely find to-day? No, no, no; it was not where the hounds, but what the Consols, left off at; what the four per cents, and not the four horses, were up to; what the condition of the money, not the horse, market. \"Anything doing in Danish bonds, sir?\" said one. \"You must do it by lease and release, and levy a fine,\" replied another. Scott _v._ Brown, crim. con. to be heard on or before Wednesday next.--Barley thirty-two to forty-two.--Fine upland meadow and rye grass hay, seventy to eighty.--The last pocket of hops I sold brought seven pounds fifteen shillings. Sussex bags six pounds ten shillings.--There were only twenty-eight and a quarter ships at market, \"and coals are coals.\" \"Glad to hear it, sir, for half the last you sent me were slates.\"--\"Best qualities of beef four shillings and eightpence a stone--mutton three shillings and eightpence, to four shillings and sixpence.--He was exceedingly ill when I paid my last visit--I gave him nearly a stone of Epsom-salts, and bled him twice.--This horse would suit you to a T, sir, but my skip-jack is coming out on one at two o'clock that can carry a house.--See what a bosom this one's got.--Well, Gunter, old boy, have you iced your horse to-day?--Have you heard that Brown and Co. are in the _Gazette_? No, which Brown--not John Brown? No, William Brown. What, Brown of Goodman's Fields? No, Brown of---- Street--Brown_e_ with an _e_; you know the man I mean.--Oh, Lord, ay, the man wot used to be called Nosey Browne.\" A general move ensued, and they left \"the meet.\"  \"Vere be you going to turn out pray, sir, may I inquire?\" said a gentleman in green to the huntsman, as he turned into a field. \"Turn out,\" said he, \"why, ye don't suppose we be come calf-hunting, do ye? We throws off some two stones'-throw from here, if so be you mean what cover we are going to draw.\" \"No,\" said green-coat, \"I mean where do you turn out the stag?\"--\"D--n the stag, we know nothing about such matters,\" replied the huntsman. \"Ware wheat! ware wheat! ware wheat!\" was now the general cry, as a gentleman in nankeen pantaloons and Hessian boots with long brass spurs, commenced a navigation across a sprouting crop. \"Ware wheat, ware wheat!\" replied he, considering it part of the ceremony of hunting, and continued his forward course. \"Come to my side,\" said Mr.----, to the whipper-in, \"and meet that gentleman as he arrives at yonder gate; and keep by him while I scold you.\"--\"Now, sir, most particularly d--n you, for riding slap-dash over the young wheat, you most confounded insensible ignorant tinker, isn't the headland wide enough both for you and your horse, even if your spurs were as long again as they are?\" Shouts of \"Yooi over, over, over hounds--try for him--yoicks--wind him! good dogs--yoicks! stir him up--have at him there!\"--here interrupted the jawbation, and the whip rode off shaking his sides with laughter. \"Your horse has got a stone in each forefoot, and a thorn in his near hock,\" observed a dentist to a wholesale haberdasher from Ludgate Hill, \"allow me to extract them for you--no pain, I assure--over before you know it.\" \"Come away, hounds! come away!\" was heard, and presently the huntsman, with some of the pack at his horse's heels, issued from the wood playing _Rule, Britannia!_ on a key-bugle, while the cracks of heavy-thonged whips warned the stragglers and loiterers to follow. \"Music hath charms to soothe the savage beast,\" observed Jorrocks, as he tucked the laps of his frock over his thighs, \"and I hope we shall find before long, else that quarter of house-lamb will be utterly ruined. Oh, dear, they are going below hill I do believe! why we shall never get home to-day, and I told Mrs. Jorrocks half-past five to a minute, and I invited old Fleecy, who is a most punctual man.\"  Jorrocks was right in his surmise. They arrived on the summit of a range of steep hills commanding an extensive view over the neighbouring country--almost, he said, as far as the sea-coast. The huntsman and hounds went down, but many of the field held a council of war on the top. \"Well! who's going down?\" said one. \"I shall wait for the next turn,\" said Jorrocks, \"for my horse does not like collar work.\" \"I shall go this time,\" said another, \"and the rest next.\" \"And so will I,\" said a third, \"for mayhap there will be no second turn.\" \"Ay,\" added a fourth, \"and he may go the other way, and then where-shall we all be?\" \"Poh!\" said Jorrocks, \"did you ever know a Surrey fox not take to the hills?--If he does not, I'll eat him without mint sauce,\" again harping on the quarter of lamb. Facilis descensus Averni--two-thirds of the field went down, leaving Jorrocks, two horse-dealers in scarlet, three chicken-butchers, half a dozen swells in leathers, a whip, and the Yorkshireman on the summit. \"Why don't you go with the hounds?\" inquired the latter of the whip. \"Oh, I wait here, sir,\" said he, \"to meet Tom Hills as he comes up, and to give him a fresh horse.\" \"And who is Tom Hills?\" inquired the Yorkshireman. \"Oh, he's our huntsman,\" replied he; \"you know Tom, don't you?\" \"Why, I can't say I do, exactly,\" said he; \"but tell me, is he called Hills because he rides up and down these hills, or is that his real name?\" \"Hought! you know as well as I do,\" said he, quite indignantly, \"that Tom Hills is his name.\"  The hounds, with the majority of the field, having effected the descent of the hills, were now trotting on in the valley below, sufficiently near, however, to allow our hill party full view of their proceedings. After drawing a couple of osier-beds blank, they assumed a line parallel to the "]]]
