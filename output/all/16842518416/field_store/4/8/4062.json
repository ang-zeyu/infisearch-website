They immediately put their heads back under their wings, however, as if ashamed of having spoken at all.  This was too much for the white rooster. He stood first on one yellow foot and then on the other. Turning his head from side to side, he said, \"What's the use of looking so sad? Any one would think that you expected to be eaten by a band of hungry foxes.\"  Just then a brave little white bantam rooster hopped down from his perch. He strutted over to the big rooster and caused quite a flutter in the henhouse by saying:  \"We're lively enough when our crops are full, but when we are starving, it is a wonder that we can hold our heads up at all. If I ever see that farmer's boy again, I'll--I'll--I'll peck his foot!\"  \"You won't see him until he feeds us,\" said the white rooster, \"and then I guess you will peck his corn.\"  \"Oh, oh!\" moaned the brown hen. \"Don't speak of a peck of corn.\"  \"Madam,\" said the white rooster, bowing very low, \"your trouble is my own,--that is, I'm hungry, too. But we might be worse off. We might be in a box on our way to market. It is true that we haven't had anything to eat to-day, but we at least have room enough to stretch our wings.\"  \"Why, that is a fact,\" clucked the brown hen. And all the feathered family--even the smallest chickens--stretched their wings, and looked a little more cheerful.  \"Now, then,\" went on the rooster, \"suppose we have a little music to cheer us and help pass the hours until roosting time. Let us all crow. There, I beg your pardon, ladies; I am sorry you can't crow. Let us sing a happy song. Will you be kind enough to start a merry tune, Mrs. Brown Hen?\"  The brown hen shook herself proudly, tossed her head back and began,--\"Ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca!\" In less than two minutes every one in the henhouse had joined her. The white rooster was the loudest of all, and the little bantam rooster stretched his neck and did the best he could.  Now, the horses, cows, and sheep were not far away. They heard the happy voices, and they, too, joined in the grand chorus. The pigs did their best to sing louder than all the rest.  Higher and higher, stronger and stronger, rose the chorus. Louder and louder quacked the ducks. Shriller and shriller squealed the pigs.  They were all so happy that they quite forgot their hunger until the door of the henhouse burst open, and in came three chubby children. Each was carrying a dish of hot chicken food.  \"Don't stop your music, Mr. Rooster,\" said the little girl, who was bundled up until you could scarcely see her dear little face.  [Illustration: The children arrive with food]  \"You see, we were so lonesome that we didn't know what to do. We heard you folk singing out here, and we laughed and laughed until we almost cried. Then we went to tell Jack about you. He was lonesome, too, for he's sick with a sore throat, you know. He said, 'Why, those poor hens! They haven't been fed since morning! Go and feed them.' And so we came.\"  \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\" said the white rooster. \"This comes of making the best of things. Cock-a-doodle-doo!\" And nobody asked him to stop crowing.  --FRANCES M. FOX.     THE ANIMALS AND THE MIRROR  I   Aunt Susan sent an old-fashioned looking-glass to the barn to be stored in the loft, with other old furniture. The farm boy stood it on the floor of the barn until he should have time to put it away. The mirror was broad and long, and it was set in a dark wooden frame.  An old duck wandered into the barn and caught sight of herself in the mirror. \"There is another duck,\" she said. \"I wonder who she is.\"  And she walked toward the reflection. \"She is rather friendly,\" the duck went on. \"She is walking toward me. What large feet she has, but her feathers are very handsome.\"  Just then she bumped into the mirror. \"Goodness!\" she cried; \"if that duck isn't in a glass case! Why are you in there?\"  \"Well, you needn't answer if you don't want to,\" she said, walking away. \"A glass case is a good place for you.\"  Just then a pig came along, and nosing around, he came in front of the mirror.  \"What are you doing here?\" he asked, thinking he saw another pig. His nose hit the glass, and he stepped back.  \"So you are in a glass pen,\" he said. \"You are not very handsome, and your nose is not so long as mine; I cannot see why you should have a glass pen.\"  And away he trotted to tell the other pigs about the very plain-looking pig.  Kitty came along next and walked in front of the mirror, turning her head and swinging her tail. She had seen a mirror before and knew what it was. The cat wished to look in the mirror, but she saw the dog coming in the door, and she did not want him to think her vain.  The dog walked over to the mirror and gazed in it. Then he looked foolish, although he had seen a mirror before, too, but not so often as puss.  \"Thought it was another dog, didn't you?\" she laughed. \"Here comes the donkey. Let us hide behind those barrels and see what he does.\"   II   The donkey went up to the mirror.  \"If they haven't another donkey!\" he said. \"I suppose I should speak first, as I have lived here so long. Why, he is coming to meet me. That is friendly, indeed.\"  Bump! his nose hit the glass.  \"Well, I had better give up!\" he said. \"You are in a glass case, but I don't know why you should be. You are a homely creature, and your ears are not so long as mine.\" And he walked off with a disgusted air.  The cat rolled over and over, and the dog buried his head in his paws. \"Did you ever see anything so funny?\" he said to puss.  \"Hush!\" she replied, \"Here is the rooster.\"  [Illustration: The rooster and the mirror]  The rooster stopped quite still when he saw himself in the mirror.  \"Well, where did you come from?\" he asked, ruffling up his feathers. He walked straight to the mirror and flew at the other rooster. Bang! He went against the glass.  \"In a glass case, are you?\" he said. He stretched out his neck and looked very fierce. \"You should be; you are a sight--your feathers are ruffled, and you are not half so handsome as I am.\"  And off he walked, satisfied that he was handsomer than the other rooster.  \"Oh, dear!\" laughed the cat. \"I certainly shall scream. They all think they are handsomer than their reflections. Here comes the turkey gobbler. Let us see what he does.\"  The gobbler walked slowly over to the mirror and looked at his reflection.  \"Now,\" he asked, \"where in the world did they get you? You are an old, bald-headed creature, and your feathers need oiling. You look like a last year's turkey.\" And off he strutted.  The cat and the dog leaned against the barrels and laughed until the tears ran down their faces.  \"Keep still,\" said the dog. \"Here comes speckled hen and her chickens.\"  Speckled hen walked around, picking up bits of corn. Suddenly she looked up and saw the mirror.  \"There is a hen with a brood of chicks, but they are not so handsome as mine,\" she said, walking toward the looking-glass. \"Where do you live? I know you do not belong here.\" And she looked closer at the other hen.  Click! Her bill hit the glass.  \"Well, if she isn't in a glass coop!\" the hen said, stepping back. \"If master has bought her and those chicks, there will be trouble. Mercy! One of the chicks is bow-legged, and they are a skinny looking lot.\"  Then she clucked to her chicks and walked out of the barn.  \"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\" laughed the dog; \"they all think the same. They certainly are a conceited lot. Here comes the goose.\"   III   The goose waddled over to the mirror.  \"Well, well! If there isn't a new goose!\" she said, \"and she is walking toward me. I must be friendly.\"  Snap! Her bill struck the mirror.  \"Oh, you are in a glass box!\" she said. \"Have you come to stay?\" And she stretched out her neck.  \"My, but you have a long neck!\" she went on, \"and your feathers are nice and smooth. I suppose you cannot hear in that box.\"  Then she walked away, nodding good-by. The other goose, of course, nodded also, and goosey went away satisfied.  \"She is not so much of a goose as the others,\" the cat remarked.  \"The peacock is coming,\" said the dog. \"Keep quiet.\"  In walked the peacock. Seeing another bird, as he supposed, he spread his beautiful tail to its full width. He walked about, but never a word did he say.  \"Now, what do you make out of that?\" asked the dog. \"Did he know that he was looking in a looking-glass, or wouldn't he speak to another bird?\"  \"I do not know,\" said the cat, \"but here comes the goat. Hide, quick!\"  Billy was clattering over the boards, when suddenly he saw the other goat. He looked at him a minute. \"I'll show him,\" he said, running at the mirror with head down.  [Illustration: The goat crashes into the mirror]  Bang! Smash! Crash! and Billy jumped back, a very much astonished goat.  \"Now you have done it,\" said the horse, who had been watching all the time from his stall. \"All the animals will get out and run away.\"  \"What are you talking about?\" said the dog, who was laughing so hard he could scarcely talk. \"There are no animals in there. That is a looking-glass; you see yourself when you are in front of it.\"  \"Do you mean to tell me that those animals have all been looking at themselves and finding fault with their own looks?\" asked the horse, with his eyes nearly popping out of his head.  \"Of course,\" said the cat. \"Can't you see that Billy has smashed the looking-glass?\"  \"Well, that is the best I ever heard,\" said the horse, laughing, \"but I wish I had known that was a looking-glass before Billy broke it. I should very much like to know how I look.\"  \"You might not have recognized yourself; the others didn't,\" said the dog.  --F.A. WALKER.     THE BARBER OF BAGDAD  ACT I   PLACE: Ali's barber shop.  TIME: Morning.  WOODCUTTER: I have a load of wood which "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15170"],["title","The Child's World: Third Reader (#8)"],["body","have just brought in on my donkey. Would you like to buy it, good barber?  ALI: Well, let me see. Is it good wood?  WOODCUTTER: The best in the country.  ALI: I'll give you five shekels for all the wood upon the donkey.  WOODCUTTER: Agreed. I'll put the wood here by your door.  (Lays wood at door.)  Now, good sir, give me the silver.  ALI: Not so fast, my good friend. I must have your wooden pack saddle, too. That was the bargain. I said, \"All the wood upon your donkey.\" Truly, the saddle is wood.  [Illustration: Ali and the woodcutter with the donkey]  WOODCUTTER: Who ever heard of such a bargain? Surely you cannot mean what you say? You would not treat a poor woodcutter so. It is impossible.  ALI: Give me the saddle, or I'll have you put in prison. And take that--and that--and that!  (Ali strikes the woodcutter.)  WOODCUTTER: Ah, me, what shall I do? What shall I do? I know. I'll go to the caliph himself.   ACT II   PLACE: Caliph's Palace.  TIME: Hour later.  COURTIER: My lord, a good woodcutter is at the door and begs leave to come into your presence.  CALIPH: Bid him enter. There is none too poor to be received by me.  (Courtier goes out and returns with woodcutter, who kneels and kisses the ground. Then he stands with arms folded.)  CALIPH: Tell me, good man, what brought you here? Has any one done you a wrong?  WOODCUTTER: Great wrong, my lord. The rich barber Ali did buy a load of wood from me. He offered me five shekels for all the wood on my donkey. When I had put down the load, I asked for my money, but he refused to pay me until I had given him my pack saddle. He said the bargain was \"all the wood on the donkey,\" and that the saddle is wood. He said he would put me in prison if I did not give up the saddle. Then he took it and drove me away with blows.  CALIPH: A strange story, truly. The barber has law on his side, and yet you have right on yours. The law must be obeyed, but--come here and let me whisper something to you.  (The woodcutter listens smilingly and bowing low, leaves the room.)   ACT III   PLACE: The barber's shop.  TIME: A few days later.  ALI: Ah! here comes my stupid friend the woodcutter. I suppose he has come to quarrel about the wood. No, he is smiling.  WOODCUTTER: Good day to you, friend Ali. I have come to ask if you will be so kind as to shave me and a companion from the country.  ALI: Oh, yes, I suppose so.  WOODCUTTER: How much will you charge?  ALI: A shekel for the two.  (To himself.)  The poor fool cannot pay that sum.  WOODCUTTER. Very good. Shave me first.  (Ali shaves him.)  ALI: Now you are shaved. Where is your companion?  WOODCUTTER: He is standing outside. He will come in at once.  (He goes out and returns leading his donkey.)  This is my companion. Shave him.  ALI (_in a rage_): Shave him! Shave a donkey, indeed! Is it not enough that I should lower myself by touching you? And then you insult me by asking me to shave your donkey! Away with you!   ACT IV   PLACE: Caliph's Palace.  TIME: Half-hour later.  CALIPH: Well, my friend, did you do as I told you?  WOODCUTTER: Yes, and Ali refused to shave my donkey.  CALIPH (_to Courtier_): Bid Ali come to me at once and bring his razors with him.  (Courtier leaves and returns with Ali.)  CALIPH: Why did you refuse to shave this man's companion? Was not that your agreement?  ALI (_kissing the ground_): It is true, O caliph, such was the agreement, but who ever made a companion of a donkey before?  CALIPH: True enough, but who ever thought of saying that a pack saddle is a part of a load of wood? No, no, it is the woodcutter's turn now. Shave his donkey instantly.  (Ali lathers the beast and shaves him in the presence of the whole court, and then slips away amid the laughter of the bystanders.)  CALIPH: Now, my honest woodcutter, here is a purse of gold for you. Always remember that the caliph gladly listens to the complaints of his people, poor and rich, and will right their wrongs if he can.  WOODCUTTER: Long live the Caliph!  COURTIERS: Long live the Caliph!  --EASTERN TALE.     WINTER NIGHT       Blow, wind, blow!     Drift the flying snow!   Send it twirling, twirling overhead.     There's a bedroom in a tree     Where snug as snug can be,   The squirrel nests in his cozy bed.      Shriek, wind, shriek!     Make the branches creak!   Battle with the boughs till break of day!     In a snow cave warm and tight     Through the icy winter night   The rabbit sleeps the peaceful hour away.      Scold, wind, scold!     So bitter and so bold!   Shake the windows with your tap, tap, tap!     With half-shut, dreamy eyes     The drowsy baby lies   Cuddled closely in his mother's lap.  --MARY F. BUTTS.     HOPE'S DOLL   It was Saturday morning. Elizabeth Brown sat by a window in the big kitchen making a pink dress for little Hope's doll.  On the chair beside her lay the doll, though you might not have thought of calling it one. It did not have curly hair--nor eyes that open and shut. In those days no child had toys like ours. Hope's doll was made of a corncob; the face was painted on a piece of linen stretched over a ball of wool on the end of the cob.  Little Hope was taking her morning nap. When Elizabeth had sewed the last neat stitches, she dressed the doll and laid it on the bed by the little girl. How happy Hope was when she awoke and saw it! She thought it the most beautiful doll in the world.  \"What will you call your doll, Hope?\" asked Elizabeth.  \"I will name her for mother,\" said Hope. \"I will call her Mary Ellen.\"  [Illustration: Hope and her doll]  Hope played all the afternoon with her doll and was very happy. When the sunset gun sounded, she had to stop playing. With the Puritans, the Sabbath began at sunset, and no child could play after the gun was heard.  The little maid kissed her baby and went into the bedroom to find a warm place for it to stay until the next evening. There lay father's Sunday coat; what warmer nest could she find for Mary Ellen than its big pocket?  After breakfast the next day, every one got ready to go to meeting. Master Brown filled the little tin foot stove with hot coals from the hearth; then he took his gun from its hook. In those days no man went anywhere without his gun--not even to church, for the Indians were likely to come at any time.  Sometimes the firing of a gun was the call to worship. More often a big drum, beaten on the steps of the meeting house, told the people it was time to come together.  At the sound of the drum, Master Brown and his wife, with Elizabeth and Hope, started to church. From every house in the village came men, women, and children. They were always ready when the drum began to beat, for no one was ever late to meeting in those days.  Master Brown led his family to their pew and opened a little door to let them in. The pew was very much like a large box with seats around the sides.  The church was cold, for there was no fire. The children warmed their fingers and toes by the queer little foot stove their father had brought from home.  When every one was seated, the minister climbed the steps to his high pulpit. The sermon was always very long--three hours at least. The children could not understand what it was all about, and it was very hard for them to sit still and listen quietly.  Elizabeth was four years older than Hope, so she felt quite like a little woman. She sat up beside her mother and looked at the minister almost all the time; but sometimes she had to wink hard to keep awake. When she thought she could not let her feet hang down another minute, she would slip down to the footstool to rest.  Elizabeth was often ashamed of Hope, who could not sit still ten minutes. She tried to listen to the sermon, but could not. When she began to stir about a little, her mother shook her head at her. She sat still for a few minutes, but was soon restless again.  Presently she began to be sleepy and laid her head upon her father's arm for a nap. Just then she felt something in his pocket. A happy smile came over Hope's face; she was wide-awake now. Slipping her hand into the wide pocket, she drew out Mary Ellen and smoothed her wrinkled gown.  Master Brown's thoughts were all on the sermon, and even Mistress Brown did not notice Hope for a little time. When she did, what do you suppose she saw? Hope was standing on the seat showing her doll to the little girl in the pew behind her.  Oh, how ashamed her mother was! She pulled her little daughter down quickly and whispered, \"Do you want the tithingman to come? Well, sit down and listen.\" Taking Mary Ellen, she slipped the doll into her muff.  Little Hope did sit down and listen. She did not even turn around when the kind lady behind them dropped a peppermint over the high-backed pew for her. She was very much afraid of the tithingman, who sat on a high seat. He had a long rod with a hard knob on one end and a squirrel's tail on the other.  [Illustration: The tithingman tickling the nodding lady]  When he saw a lady nodding during the sermon, he stepped around to her pew and tickled her face with the fur end of the rod. She would waken with a start and be, oh! so ashamed. She would be very glad the pew had such high sides to hide her blushing face.  Perhaps you think the boys who sat on the other side of the church had a good time. But there was the tithingman again. When he saw a boy whispering or playing, he rapped him on the head with the knob end of the rod. The whispering would stop at once, for the rod often brought tears and left a headache.  Besides keeping the boys from playing and the grown people from going to sleep, the tithingman must turn the hourglass. In those days very few people could afford clocks, but every one had an hourglass. It took the fine sand just one hour to pour from the upper part of the glass into the lower part.  When the sand had all run through, the tithingman turned the glass over and the sand began to tell another hour. The glass was always turned three times before the"]]]
