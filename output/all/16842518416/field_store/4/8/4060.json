I can oblige the fairies and save sixpence in tinkering, too.\"  The maid brought the old saucepan that had been laid by until the tinker's next visit, and gave it to the Hillman. He thanked her and went away.  When the saucepan was returned, it had been neatly mended, just as the housewife thought it would be.  At night the maid filled the pan with milk and set it on the fire to heat for the children's supper. In a few moments the milk was so smoked and burnt that no one would touch it. Even the pigs refused to drink it.  \"Ah, you good-for-nothing!\" cried the housewife. \"There's a quart of milk wasted at once.\"  \"And that's twopence,\" cried a queer little voice that seemed to come from the chimney.  The housewife filled the saucepan again and set it over the fire. It had not been there more than two minutes before it boiled over and was burnt and smoked as before.  \"The pan must be dirty,\" muttered the woman, who was very much vexed. \"Two full quarts of milk have been wasted.\"  \"And that's fourpence!\" added the queer little voice from the chimney.  The saucepan was scoured; then it was filled with milk the third time and set over the fire. Again the milk boiled over and was spoiled.  Now the housewife was quite vexed. \"I have never had anything like this to happen since I first kept house,\" she exclaimed. \"Three quarts of milk wasted!\"  \"And that's sixpence,\" cried the queer little voice from the chimney. \"You didn't save the tinkering after all, mother!\"  With that the Hillman himself came tumbling from the chimney and ran off laughing. But from that time, the saucepan was as good as any other.  --JULIANA H. EWING.  [Illustration: The Hillman running off from the fire]     [Illustration: The Elf and the Dormouse under the toadstool]  THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE     Under a toad stool     Crept a wee Elf,   Out of the rain     To shelter himself.    Under the toad stool     Sound asleep,   Sat a big Dormouse     All in a heap.    Trembled the wee Elf     Frightened, and yet   Fearing to fly away     Lest he get wet.    To the next shelter--     Maybe a mile!   Sudden the wee Elf     Smiled a wee smile;    Tugged till the toad stool     Toppled in two;   Holding it over him,     Gayly he flew.    Soon he was safe home,     Dry as could be.   Soon woke the Dormouse--     \"Good gracious me!    \"Where is my toad stool?\"     Loud he lamented.   And that's how umbrellas     First were invented.  --OLIVER HERFORD.  [Illustration: The elf flying away with the toadstool as the Dormouse watches]     THE BELL OF ATRI  I   Good King John of Atri loved his people very much and wished to see them happy. He knew, however, that some were not; he knew that many suffered wrongs which were not righted. This made him sad.  One day the king thought of a way to help his people. He had a great bell hung in a tower in the market place. He had the rope made so long that a child could reach it.  Then the king sent heralds through the streets to tell the people why he had put the bell in the market place. The heralds blew their trumpets long and loud, and the people came from their homes to hear the message.  \"Know ye,\" cried a herald, \"that whenever a wrong is done to any man, he has but to ring the great bell in the square. A judge will go to the tower to hear the complaint, and he will see that justice is done.\"  \"Long live our good king!\" shouted the people. \"Now our wrongs shall be righted.\"  And so it was. Whenever anyone was wronged, he rang the bell in the tower. The judge put on his rich robes and went there. He listened to the complaint, and the guilty were punished.  The people in Atri were now very happy, and the days went swiftly by. The bell hung in its place year after year, and it was rung many times. By and by the rope became so worn that one could scarcely reach it.  The king said, \"Why, a child could not reach the rope now, and a wrong might not be righted. I must put in a new one.\"  So he ordered a rope from a distant town. In those days it took a long time to travel from one town to another. What should they do if somebody wished to ring the bell before the new rope came?  \"We must mend the rope in some way,\" said a man.  \"Here,\" said another; \"take this piece of grapevine and fasten it to the rope. Then it will be long enough for any one to reach.\"  This was done, and for some time the bell was rung in that way.   II   One hot summer noon everything was very still. All the people were indoors taking their noonday rest.  Suddenly they were awakened by the arousing bell:    Some one--hath done--a wrong,   Hath done--a wrong!   Hath done--a wrong!  The judge started from a deep sleep, turned on his couch, and listened. Could it be the bell of justice?  Again the sound came:    Some one--hath done--a wrong!   Hath done--a wrong!   Hath done--a wrong!  It was the bell of justice. The judge put on his rich robes and, panting, hurried to the market place.  There he saw a strange sight: a poor steed, starved and thin, tugging at the vines which were fastened to the bell. A great crowd had gathered around.  \"Whose horse is this?\" the judge asked.  \"It is the horse of the rich soldier who lives in the castle,\" said a man. \"He has served his master long and well, and has saved his life many times. Now that the horse is too old to work, the master turns him out. He wanders through the lanes and fields, picking up such food as can be found.\"  \"His call for justice shall be heard,\" said the judge. \"Bring the soldier to me.\"  The soldier tried to treat the matter as a jest. Then he grew angry and said in an undertone, \"One can surely do what he pleases with his own.\"  [Illustration: The judge sees the horse in the market place]  \"For shame!\" cried the judge. \"Has the horse not served you for many years? And has he not saved your life? You must build a good shelter for him, and give him the best grain and the best pasture. Take the horse home and be as true to him as he has been to you.\"  The soldier hung his head in shame and led the horse away. The people shouted and applauded.  \"Great is King John,\" they cried, \"and great the bell of Atri!\"  --ITALIAN TALE.     A DUMB WITNESS   One day at noontime a poor man was riding along a road. He was tired and hungry, and wished to stop and rest. Finding a tree with low branches, he tied his horse to one of them. Then he sat down to eat his dinner.  Soon a rich man came along and started to tie his horse to the same tree.  \"Do not fasten your horse to that tree,\" cried the poor man. \"My horse is savage and he may kill yours. Fasten him to another tree.\"  \"I shall tie my horse where I wish,\" the rich man replied; and he tied his horse to the same tree. Then he, too, sat down to eat.  Very soon the men heard a great noise. They looked up and saw that their horses were kicking and fighting. Both men rushed to stop them, but it was too late; the rich man's horse was dead.  \"See what your horse has done!\" cried the rich man in an angry voice. \"But you shall pay for it! You shall pay for it!\"  Then he dragged the man before a judge.  \"Oh, wise judge,\" he cried, \"I have come to you for justice. I had a beautiful, kind, gentle horse which has been killed by this man's savage horse. Make the man pay for the horse or send him to prison.\"  \"Not so fast, my friend,\" the judge said. \"There are two sides to every case.\"  He turned to the poor man. \"Did your horse kill this man's horse?\" he asked.  The poor man made no reply.  The judge asked in surprise, \"Are you dumb? Can you not talk?\"  But no word came from the poor man's lips.  Then the judge turned to the rich man.  \"What more can I do?\" he asked. \"You see for yourself this poor man cannot speak.\"  \"Oh, but he can,\" cried the rich man. \"He spoke to me.\"  \"Indeed!\" said the judge. \"When?\"  \"He spoke to me when I tied my horse to the tree.\"  \"What did he say?\" asked the judge.  \"He said, 'Do not fasten your horse to that tree. My horse is savage and may kill yours.'\"  \"0 ho!\" said the judge. \"This poor man warned you that his horse was savage, and you tied your horse near his after the warning. This puts a new light on the matter. You are to blame, not he.\"  The judge turned to the poor man and said, \"My man, why did you not answer my questions?\"  \"Oh, wise judge,\" said the poor man, \"if I had told you that I warned him not to tie his horse near mine, he would have denied it. Then how could you have told which one of us to believe? I let him tell his own story, and you have learned the truth.\"  This speech pleased the judge. He praised the poor man for his wisdom, and sent the rich man away without a penny.  --ARABIAN TALE.

WIFE: The cabbage is fine enough, but I can't see why we should be so happy.  [Illustration: The hare and the hedgehog with a cabbage]  HEDGEHOG: Why, my dear, there are tears in your voice. What is the matter?  WIFE: I suppose I ought not to mind it, but those dreadful hares nearly worry the life out of me.  HEDGEHOG: What are they doing now?  WIFE: Doing? What are they not doing? Why, yesterday I brought my pretty babies out here to get some cabbage leaves. We were eating as well-behaved hedgehogs always eat, and those horrid hares almost made us cry.  HEDGEHOG: What did they do?  WIFE: They came to our cabbage patch and they giggled and said, \"Oh, see the little duck-legged things! Aren't they funny?\" Then one jumped over a cabbage just to hurt our feelings.  HEDGEHOG: Well, they are mean, I know, but we won't notice them. I'll get even with them one of these days. Ah, there comes one of them now.  WIFE: Yes, and he laughed at me yesterday. He said, \"Good-morning, Madam Shortlegs.\" I won't speak to him. I'll hide till he goes by.  (Wife hides behind a cabbage.)  HEDGEHOG: Good-morning, sir.  HARE: Are you speaking to me?  HEDGEHOG: Certainly; do you see any one else around?  HARE: How dare you speak to me?  HEDGEHOG: Oh, just to be neighborly.  HARE: I shall ask you not to speak to me hereafter. I think myself too good to notice hedgehogs.  HEDGEHOG: Now, that is strange.  HARE: What is strange?  HEDGEHOG: Why, I have just said to my wife that we wouldn't notice you.  HARE: Wouldn't notice me, indeed, you silly, short-legged, duck-legged thing!  HEDGEHOG: Well, my legs are quite as good as yours, sir.  HARE: As good as mine! Who ever heard of such a thing? Why, you can do little more than crawl.  HEDGEHOG: That may be as you say, but I'll run a race with you any day.  HARE: Ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! A race with a hedgehog! Well, well, well!  HEDGEHOG: Are you afraid to run with me?  HARE: Of course not. It will be no race at all, but I'll run just to show you how silly you are.  HEDGEHOG: Good! You run in that furrow; I will run in this. We shall see who gets to the fence first. Let's start from the far end of the furrow.  HARE: I will run to the brook and back while you are getting there. Go ahead.  HEDGEHOG: I wouldn't stay too long if I were you.  HARE: Oh, I'll be back before you reach the end of the furrow.  (The hare runs off to the brook.)   II   HEDGEHOG: Wife, wife, did you hear what I said to the hare?  WIFE: Did I hear? I should say I did. What are you thinking of? Have you lost your senses?  HEDGEHOG: You shouldn't speak that way to me. What do you know about a man's business? Come here and let me whisper something to you.  (He whispers and then walks to far end of the furrow. His wife laughs.)  WIFE: Ha, ha! I see. I see. Nothing wrong with your brains.    \"Short legs, long wit,   Long legs, not a bit,\"  as my grandmother used to say. The hare will find that out today.  (She stoops down in the near end of the furrow. The hare returns and takes his place.)  HARE: Well, are you ready?  HEDGEHOG: Of course I am,--ready and waiting.    HARE: One for the money,   Two for the show,   Three to make ready,   And here we go!  (The hare runs as swiftly as the wind. The hedgehog starts with him, but stops and stoops low in the furrow. When the hare reaches the other end, the hedgehog's wife puts up her head.)  WIFE: Well, here I am.  HARE: What does this mean?  WIFE: It means what it means.  HARE: We'll try again. Are you ready?  WIFE: Of course I am.    HARE: One for the money,   Two for the show,   Three to make ready,   And here we go!  (The hare runs swiftly back again. Wife starts, but stops and stoops low. The hare reaches the other end. The hedgehog puts up his head.)  HEDGEHOG: Here I am.  HARE: I can't understand this.  HEDGEHOG: It is very clear to me.  HARE: Well, we'll try again. Are you ready?  HEDGEHOG: I'm always ready.    HARE: One for the money,   Two for the show,   Three to make ready,   And here we go!  (Again the wife puts up her head and the hare is bewildered.)  [Illustration: The hare racing as the hedhog looks on]  WIFE: You see I am here.  HARE: I just can't believe it.  WIFE: A perfectly simple thing.  HARE: We'll try once more. You can't beat me another time.  WIFE: Don't boast. You had better save your breath for the race; you will need it.    HARE: One for the money,   Two for the show,   Three to make ready,   And here we go!  (When the hare reaches the other end of the field, the hedgehog puts up his head.)  HARE: This is very strange.  HEDGEHOG: Shall we run again? You seem a little tired, but I am perfectly fresh.  HARE (_panting_): No, no! The race is yours.  HEDGEHOG: Will you call my wife and children names any more?  HARE: No, no! I'll never do that again.  HEDGEHOG: Very well. And if you wish a race at any time, friend hare, just call by for me.  HARE (_walking off shaking his head_): It's very strange. I hope none of the other hares will hear of this race.  WIFE (_as she meets the hedgehog_): I thought I should hurt myself laughing. As my grandmother used to say,    \"Short legs, long wit,   Long legs, not a bit.\"  --GRIMM.     EPAMINONDAS   Epaminondas had a good kind granny, who cooked at \"the big house.\" Epaminondas liked to go to see her, for she always gave him something to take home with him.  One day when Epaminondas went to see granny, she was baking a cake, and she gave Epaminondas a piece to eat. As he was leaving, granny said, \"Epaminondas, you may take a slice home to your mammy.\"  Epaminondas took it in his little hands and squeezing it just as tight as he could, ran all the way home. When his mammy saw him, she said, \"What's that, Epaminondas?\"  \"Cake, mammy. Granny sent it to you.\"  \"Cake!\" cried his mammy. \"Epaminondas, don't you know that's no way to carry cake? When your granny gives you cake, put it in your hat; then put your hat on your head and come home. You hear me, Epaminondas?\"  \"Yes, mammy.\"  The next time Epaminondas went to see his granny, she was churning, and she gave him a pat of fresh butter to carry to his mammy.  Epaminondas said to himself, \"What was it mammy said? Oh, yes! I know. She said, 'Put it in your hat and put the hat on your head and come home.' I'll do just what she told me.\"  Epaminondas put the pat of butter in his hat, put his hat on his head, and went home.  It was a hot day, and soon the butter began to melt. Drip, drip, drip, it went into his ears. Drip, drip, drip, it went into his eyes. Drip, drip, drip, it went down his back. When Epaminondas reached home, he had no butter in his hat. It was all on him.  Looking at him hard, his mammy said, \"Epaminondas, what in the world is that dripping from your hat?\"  \"Butter, mammy. Granny sent it to you.\"  \"Butter!\" cried his mammy. \"Oh, Epaminondas! Don't you know how to carry butter? You must wrap it in a cabbage leaf, and take it to the spring. Then you must cool it in the water, and cool it in the water, and cool it in the water. When you have done this, take the butter in your hands and come home. You hear me, Epaminondas?\"  \"Yes, mammy.\"  The next time Epaminondas went to see his granny, she wasn't baking cake and she wasn't churning. She was sitting in a chair knitting.  She said, \"Epaminondas, look in the woodshed, and you'll see something you like.\"  Epaminondas looked in the woodshed, and there he found four little puppies. He played with them all the afternoon, and when he started home, his granny gave him one.  Epaminondas remembered what his mammy had told him. He wrapped the puppy in a big cabbage leaf, and took it to the spring. He cooled it in the water, and cooled it in the water, and cooled it in the water. Then he took it in his hands, and went home.  When his mammy saw him, she said, \"Epaminondas, what is that in your hands?\"  \"A puppy dog, mammy.\"  \"A puppy dog!\" cried his mammy. \"Oh, Epaminondas! What makes you act so foolish? That's no way to carry a puppy. The way to carry a puppy is to tie a string around his neck and put him on the ground. Then you take the other end of the string in your hand and come along home. You hear me, Epaminondas?\"  \"Yes, mammy.\"  Epaminondas was going to be right the next time; he got a piece of string and put it in his pocket to have it ready.  The next day company came to see Epaminondas's mammy, and she had no bread for dinner. She called Epaminondas and said, \"Run to 'the big house' and ask your granny to send me a loaf of bread for dinner.\"  \"Yes, mammy,\" said Epaminondas. And off he ran.  Granny gave him a loaf just from the oven--a nice, brown, crusty loaf. This time Epaminondas was certainly going to do what mammy had told him.  He proudly got out his string and tied it to the loaf. Then he put the loaf on the ground, and taking the other end of the string in his hand, he went along home.  When he reached home, his mammy gave one look at the thing tied to the end of the string.  \"What have you brought, Epaminondas?\" she cried.  \"Bread, mammy. Granny sent it to you.\"  \"Oh, Epaminondas! Epaminondas! How could you be so foolish?\" cried his mammy. \"Now I have no bread for dinner. I'll have to go and get some myself.\"  She went into the house and got her bonnet. When she came out, she said, \"Epaminondas, do you see those three mince pies I've put on the doorstep to cool. Well, now, you hear me, Epaminondas. You be careful how you step on those pies!\"  \"Yes, mammy.\"  His mammy went off down the road; Epaminondas went to the door and looked out. \"Mammy told me to be careful how I step on those mince pies,\" he said, \"so I must be careful how I do it. I'll step right in the middle of every one.\"  And he did!  When his mammy came home, there were no pies for dinner.  Now she was angry all over, and something happened. I don't know, and you don't know, but we can guess.  Poor Epaminondas!--SOUTHERN TALE.  [Illustration: Epaminondas stepping in the pies]     HOW BROTHER RABBIT FOOLED THE WHALE AND THE ELEPHANT  I"]]]
