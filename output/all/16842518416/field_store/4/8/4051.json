His pipe glowed, as with the profanity of an immortal to whom eternity and infinity are of the usual significance.  Then a red and green eye appeared astern, and there was a steady throbbing as if some monster were in pursuit of us.  A tug shaped near us, drew level, and exposed with its fires, as it went ahead, a radiant _Lizzie_ on an area of water that leaped in red flames.  The furnace door of the tug was shut, and at once we were blind.  \"Hold hard,\" yelled our skipper, and the _Lizzie_ slipped into the turmoil of the tug's wake.  There would be Millwall.  The tug and the turmoil had gone.  We were alone again in the beyond.  There was no sound now but the water spattering under our craft, and the fumbling and infrequent splash of the sweep.  Once we heard the miniature bark of a dog, distinct and fine, as though distance had refined it as well as reduced it.  We were nearly round the loop the River makes about Millwall, and this unknown region before us was Blackwall Reach by day, and Execution Dock used to be dead ahead.  To the east, over the waters, red light exploded fan-wise and pulsed on the clouds latent above, giving them momentary form.  It was as though, from the place where it starts, the dawn had been released too soon, and was at once recalled.  \"The gas works,\" said the skipper.  Still the slow drift, quite proper to those at large in eternity.  But this, I was told, was the beginning of Bugsby's Reach.  It was first a premonition, then a doubt, and at last a distinct tremor in the darkness ahead of us.  A light appeared, grew nearer, higher, and brighter, and there was a suspicion of imminent mass.  \"Watch her,\" warned the skipper.  Watch what?  There was nothing to watch but the dark and some planets far away, one of them red.  The menacing one still grew higher and brighter.  It came at us.  A wall instantly appeared to overhang us, with a funnel and masts above it, and our skipper's yell was lost in the thunder of a churning propeller.  The air shuddered, and a siren hooted in the heavens.  A long, dark body seemed minutes going by us, and our skipper's insults were taken in silence by her superior deck.  She left us riotous in her wake, and we continued our journey dancing our indignation on the uneasy deck of the _Lizzie_.  The silent drift recommenced, and we neared a region of unearthly lights and the smell of sulphur, where aerial skeletons, vast and black, and columns and towers, alternately glowed and vanished as the doors of infernal fires were opened and shut.  We drew abreast of this phantom place where names and darkness battled amid gigantic ruin. Charon spoke.  \"They're the coal wharves,\" he said.  The lights of a steamer rose in the night below the wharves, but it was our own progress which brought them nearer.  She was anchored.  We made out at last her shape, but at first she did not answer our hail.  \"Hullo, _Aldebaran_,\" once more roared our captain.  There was no answer.  In a minute we should be by her, and too late.  \"Barge ahoy!\" came a voice.  \"Look out for a line.\"     III. A Shipping Parish  What face this shipping parish shows to a stranger I do not know.  I was never a stranger to it.  I should suppose it to be a face almost vacant, perhaps a little conventionally picturesque, for it is grey and seamed.  It might be even an altogether expressionless mask, staring at nothing.  Anyhow, there must be very little to be learned from it, for those bright young cultured strangers, admirable in their eagerness for social service, who come and live with us for a time, so that they may understand the life of the poor, never seem to have made anything of us.  They say they have; they speak even with some amount of assurance, at places where the problem which is us is examined aloud by confident politicians and churchfolk.  But I think they know well enough that they always failed to get anywhere near what mind we have.  There is a reason for it, of course.  Think of honest and sociable Mary Ann, of Pottles Rents, E., having been alarmed by the behaviour of good society, as it is betrayed in the popular picture Press, making odd calls in Belgravia (the bells for visitors, too), to bring souls to God.  My parish, to strangers, must be opaque with its indifference.  It stares beyond the interested visitor, in the way the sad and disillusioned have, to things it supposes a stranger would not understand if he were told.  He has reason, therefore, to say we are dull.  And Dockland, with its life so uniform that it could be an amorphous mass overflowing a reef of brick cells, I think would be distressing to a sensitive stranger, and even a little terrifying, as all that is alive but inexplicable must be.  No more conscious purpose shows in our existence than is seen in the coral polyp.  We just go on increasing and forming more cells.  Overlooking our wilderness of tiles in the rain--we get more than a fair share of rain, or else the sad quality of wet weather is more noticeable in such a place as ours--it seems a dismal affair to present for the intelligent labours of mankind for generations.  Could nothing better have been done than that?  What have we been busy about?  Well, what are people busy about anywhere?  Human purpose here has been as blind and sporadic as it is at Westminster, unrelated to any fixed star, lucky to fill the need of the day, building without any distant design, flowing in bulk through the lowest channels that offered.  As elsewhere, it is obstructed by the unrecognized mistakes of its past. Our part of London, like Kensington or Islington, is but the formless accretion of countless swarms of life which had no common endeavour; and so here we are, Time's latest deposit, the vascular stratum of this area of the earth's rind, a sensitive surface flourishing during its day on the piled strata of the dead.  Yet this is the reef to which I am connected by tissue and bone.  Cut the kind of life you find in Poplar and I must bleed.  I cannot detach myself, and write of it. Like any other atom, I would show the local dirt, if examined.  My hand moves, not loyally so much as instinctively, to impulses which come from beneath and so out of a stranger's knowledge; out of my own, too, largely.  Is that all?  Not quite.  Where you, if you came to us, would see but an unremarkable level of East-Enders, much like other Londoners, with no past worth recording, and no future likely to be worth a book of gold, I see, looking to the past, a spectral show of fine ships and brave affairs, and good men forgotten, or almost forgotten, and moving among the plainer shades of its foreground some ghosts well known to me.  I think they were what are called failures in life.  And turning from those shades, and their work which went the way of all forgotten stuff before the inexorable tide of affairs, I look forward from Poplar, unreasonably hopeful (for so we are made), though this time into the utter dark, for the morning that shall show us the more enduring towers of the city of our dreams, the heart of the commune, the radiant spires of the city that shall be lovelier than that dear city of Cecrops.  But for those whose place it is not, memories and dreams can do nothing to transform it.  Dockland would seem to others as any alien town would seem to me.  There is something, though, you must grant us, a heritage peculiarly ours.  Amid our packed tenements, into the dark mass where poorer London huddles as my shipping parish, are set our docks. Embayed in the obscurity are those areas of captured day, reservoirs of light brimmed daily by the tides of the sun, silver mirrors through which one may leave the dark floor of Poplar for radiant other worlds. We have our ships and docks, and the River at Blackwall when night and the flood come together, and walls and roofs which topmasts and funnels surmount, suggestions of a vagabondage hidden in what seemed so arid a commonplace desert.  These are of first importance.  They are our ways of escape.  We are not kept within a division of the map.  And Orion, he strides over our roofs on bright winter nights.  We have the immortals.  At the most, your official map sets us only lateral bounds. The heavens here are as high as elsewhere.  Our horizon is beyond our own limits.  In this faithful chronicle of our parish I must tell of our boundaries as I know them.  They are not so narrow as you might think.  Maps cannot be so carefully planned, nor walls built high enough nor streets confined and strict enough, to hold within limits our lusty and growing population of thoughts.  There is no census you can take which will give you forewarning of what is growing here, of the way we increase and expand.  Take care.  Some day, when we discover the time has come for it, we shall tell our numbers, and be sure you will then learn the result.  Travelling through our part of the country, you see but our appearance.  You go, and report us casually to your friends, and forget us.  But when you feel the ground moving under your feet, that will be us.  From my high window in central Dockland, as from a watch tower, I look out over a tumbled waste of roofs and chimneys, a volcanic desert, inhabited only by sparrows and pigeons.  Humanity burrows in swarms below that surface of crags, but only faint cries tell me that the rocks are caverned and inhabited, that life flows there unseen through subterranean galleries.  Often, when the sunrise over the roofs is certainly the coming of Aurora, as though then the first illumination of the sky heralded the veritable dayspring for which we look, and the gods were nearly here, I have watched for that crust beneath, which seals the sleepers under, to heave and roll, to burst, and for released humanity to pour through fractures, from the lower dark, to be renewed in the fires of the morning.  Nothing has happened yet.  But I am confident it would repay society to appoint"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15167"],["title","London River (#4)"],["body"," watcher when I am gone, to keep an eye on the place.  Right below my window there are two ridges running in parallel jags of chimneys, with a crevasse between them to which I can see no bottom. But a roadway is there.  From an acute angle of the window a cornice overhangs a sheer fall of cliff.  That is as near the ground as can be got from my outlook.  Several superior peaks rise out of the wilderness, where the churches are; and beyond the puzzling middle distance, where smoke dissolves all form, loom the dock warehouses, a continuous range of far dark heights.  I have thoughts of a venturesome and lonely journey by moonlight, in and out of the chimney stacks, and all the way to the distant mountains.  It looks inviting, and possible, by moonlight.  And, indeed, any bright day in summer, from my window, Dockland with its goblin-like chimneys might be the enchanted country of a child's dream, where shapes, though inanimate, are watchful and protean.  From that silent world legions of grotesques move out of the shadows at a touch of sunlight, and then, when you turn on them in surprise, become thin and vague, either phantoms or smoke, and dissolve.  The freakish light shows in little what happens in the long run to man's handiwork, for it accelerates the speed of change till change is fast enough for you to watch a town grow and die.  You see that Dockland is unstable, is in flux, alters in colours and form.  I doubt whether the people below are sensitive to this ironic display on their roofs.  My eyes more frequently go to one place in that high country.  In that distant line of warehouses is a break, and there occasionally I see the masts and spars of a tall ship, and I remember that beyond my dark horizon of warehouses is the path down which she has come from the Indies to Blackwall.  I said we were not inland.  Cassiopeia is in that direction, and China over there.  For my outlook is more than the centre of Dockland.  I call it the centre of the world.  Our high road is part of the main thoroughfare from Kensington to Valparaiso.  Every wanderer must come this way at least once in his life.  We are the hub whence all roads go to the circumference.  A ship does not go down but we hear the cry of distress, and the house of a neighbour rocks on the flood and is lost, casting its people adrift on the blind tides.  Think of some of our street names--Malabar Street, Amoy Place, Nankin Street, Pekin Street, Canton Street.  And John Company has left its marks.  You pick up hints of the sea here as you pick old shells out of dunes.  We have, still nourishing in a garden, John Company's Chapel of St. Matthias, a fragment of a time that was, where now the vigorous commercial life of the Company shows no evidence whatever of its previous urgent importance.  Founded in the time of the Commonwealth as a symbol for the Company's men who, when in rare moments they looked up from the engrossing business of their dominant hours, desired a reminder of the ineffable things beyond ships and cargoes, the Chapel has survived all the changes which destroyed their ships and scattered the engrossing business of their working hours into dry matter for antiquaries.  So little do men really change.  They always leave their temples, whether they lived in Poplar or Nineveh.  Only the names of their gods change.  The Chapel at Poplar it was then, when this shipping parish had no docks, and the nearest church was over the fields to Stepney.  Our vessels then lay in the river.  We got our first dock, that of the West India Merchants, at the beginning of last century.  A little later the East India Dock was built by John Company. Then another phase began to reshape Dockland.  There came a time when the Americans looked in a fair way, sailing ahead fast with the wonderful clippers Donald McKay was building at Boston, to show us a tow rope.  The best sailers ever launched were those Yankee ships, and the Thames building yards were working to create the ideal clipper which should beat them.  This really was the last effort of sails, for steamers were on the seas, and the Americans were actually making heroic efforts to smother them with canvas.  Mr. Green, of Poplar, worried over those Boston craft, declared we must be first again, and first we were.  But both Boston and Poplar, in their efforts to perfect an old idea, did not see a crude but conquering notion taking form to magnify and hasten both commerce and war.  But they were worth doing, those clippers, and worth remembering.  They sail clear into our day as imperishable memories.  They still live, for they did far more than carry merchandise.  When an old mariner speaks of the days of studding sails it is not the precious freight, the real purpose of his ships, which animates his face.  What we always remember afterwards is not the thing we did, or tried to do, but the friends who were about us at the time.  But our stately ships themselves, with our River their home, which gave Poplar's name, wherever they went, a ring on the counter like a sound guinea, at the most they are now but planks bearded with sea grass, lost in ocean currents, sighted only by the albatross.  Long ago nearly every home in Dockland treasured a lithographic portrait of one of the beauties, framed and hung where visitors could see it as soon as they entered the door.  Each of us knew one of them, her runs and her records, the skipper and his fads, the owner and his prejudice about the last pennyworth of tar.  She was not a transporter to us, an earner of freights, something to which was attached a profit and loss account and an insurance policy.  She had a name.  She was a sentient being, perhaps noble, perhaps wilful; she might have any quality of character, even malice.  I have seen hands laid on her with affection in dock, when those who knew her were telling me of her ways.  To few of the newer homes among the later streets of Dockland is that beautiful lady's portrait known.  Here and there it survives, part of the flotsam which has drifted through the years with grandmother's sandalwood chest, the last of the rush-bottomed chairs, and the lacquered tea-caddy.  I well remember a room from which such survivals were saved when the household ship ran on a coffin, and foundered.  It was a front parlour in one of the streets with an Oriental name; which, I cannot be expected to remember, for when last I was in that room I was lifted to sit on one of its horsehair chairs, its seat like a hedgehog, and I was cautioned to sit still.  It was rather a long drop to the floor from a chair for me in those days, and though sitting still was hard, sliding part of the way would have been much worse. That was a room for holy days, too, a place for good behaviour, and boots profaned it.  Its door was nearly always shut and locked, and only the chance formal visit of respect-worthy strangers brought down its key from the top shelf of the kitchen dresser.  That key was seldom used for relatives, except at Christmas, or when one was dead.  The room was always sombre.  Light filtered into it through curtains of wire gauze, fixed in the window by mahogany frames.  Over the door by which you entered was the picture of an uncle, too young and jolly for that serious position, I thought then, with his careless neckcloth, and his cap pulled down over one eye.  The gilt moulding was gone from a corner of the picture--the only flaw in the prim apartment--for once that portrait fell to the floor, and on the very day, it was guessed, that his ship must have foundered.  A round table set on a central thick leg having a three-clawed foot was in that chamber, covered with a cloth on which was worked a picture from the story of Ruth.  But only puzzling bits of the latter were to be seen, for on the circumference of the table-cover were books, placed at precise distances apart, and in the centre was a huge Bible, with a brass clasp.  With many others my name was in the Bible, and my birthday, and a space left blank for the day of my death.  Reflected in the pier-glass which doubled the room were the portraits in oils of my grandparents, looking wonderfully young, as you may have noticed is often the case in people belonging to ancient history, as though, strangely enough, people were the same in those remote days, except that they wore different clothes.  I have often sat on the chair, and when patience had inured me to the spines of the area I occupied, looked at the reflections in the mirror of those portraits, for they seemed more distant so, and in a perspective according to their age, and became really my grandparents, in a room, properly, of another world, which could be seen, but was not.  A room no one could enter any more.  I remember a black sofa, which smelt of dust, an antimacassar over its head.  That sofa would wake to squeak tales if I stood on it to inspect the model of a ship in yellow ivory, resting on a wall-bracket above.  There were many old shells in the polished brass fender, some with thick orange lips and spotted backs; others were spirals of mother-o'-pearl, which took different colours for every way you held them.  You could get the only sound in the room by putting the shells to your ear.  Like the people of the portraits, it was impossible to believe the shells had ever lived.  The inside of the grate was filled with white paper, and the trickles of fine black dust which rested in its crevices would start and run stealthily when people walked in the next room.  Over the looking-glass there hung a pair of immense buffalo horns, with a piece of curly black hair dividing them which looked like the skin of our retriever dog.  Above the horns was the picture of \"The Famous Tea Clipper _Oberon_, setting her Studding Sails off the Lizard\"; but so high was the print, and so faint--for the picture, too, was old--that some one grown up had to tell me all about it.  The clipper _Oberon_ long since sailed to the Isle-of-No-La"]]]
