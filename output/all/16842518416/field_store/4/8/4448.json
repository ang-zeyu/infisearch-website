New York Grosset & Dunlap Publishers 1900     To My Father  William Vail Wilson Davis  Who Has Taught Me More Than All My Books     Preface   If this book serves to show that Classical Life presented many phases akin to our own, it will not have been written in vain.  After the book was planned and in part written, it was discovered that Archdeacon Farrar had in his story of \"Darkness and Dawn\" a scene, \"Onesimus and the Vestal,\" which corresponds very closely to the scene, \"Agias and the Vestal,\" in this book; but the latter incident was too characteristically Roman not to risk repetition. If it is asked why such a book as this is desirable after those noble fictions, \"Darkness and Dawn\" and \"Quo Vadis,\" the reply must be that these books necessarily take and interpret the Christian point of view. And they do well; but the Pagan point of view still needs its interpretation, at least as a help to an easy apprehension of the life and literature of the great age of the Fall of the Roman Republic. This is the aim of \"A Friend of Cæsar.\" The Age of Cæsar prepared the way for the Age of Nero, when Christianity could find a world in a state of such culture, unity, and social stability that it could win an adequate and abiding triumph.  Great care has been taken to keep to strict historical probability; but in one scene, the \"Expulsion of the Tribunes,\" there is such a confusion of accounts in the authorities themselves that I have taken some slight liberties.

Calm after Storm                      496     Chapter I  Præneste   I  It was the Roman month of September, seven hundred and four years after Romulus--so tradition ran--founded the little village by the Tiber which was to become \"Mother of Nations,\" \"Centre of the World,\" \"Imperial Rome.\" To state the time according to modern standards it was July, fifty years before the beginning of the Christian Era. The fierce Italian sun was pouring down over the tilled fields and stretches of woodland and grazing country that made up the landscape, and the atmosphere was almost aglow with the heat. The dust lay thick on the pavement of the highway, and rose in dense, stifling clouds, as a mule, laden with farm produce and driven by a burly countryman, trudged reluctantly along.  Yet, though the scene suggested the heat of midsummer, it was far from being unrefreshing, especially to the eyes of one newly come. For this spot was near \"cool Præneste,\" one of the favourite resorts of Latium to the wealthy, invalid, or indolent of Rome, who shunned the excessive heat of the capital. And they were wise in their choice; for Præneste, with its citadel, which rose twelve hundred feet over the adjoining country, commanded in its ample sweep both the views and the breezes of the whole wide-spreading Campagna. Here, clustering round the hill on which stood the far-famed \"Temple of Fortune,\" lay the old Latin town of the Prænestians; a little farther westward was the settlement founded some thirty odd years before by Sulla as a colony. Farther out, and stretching off into the open country, lay the farmhouses and villas, gardens and orchards, where splendid nuts and roses, and also wine, grew in abundant measure.  A little stream ran close to the highway, and here an irrigating machine[1] was raising water for the fields. Two men stood on the treadmill beside the large-bucketed wheel, and as they continued their endless walk the water dashed up into the trough and went splashing down the ditches into the thirsty gardens. The workers were tall, bronze-skinned Libyans, who were stripped to the waist, showing their splendid chests and rippling muscles. Beside the trough had just come two women, by their coarse and unpretentious dress evidently slaves, bearing large earthen water-pots which they were about to fill. One of the women was old, and bore on her face all the marks which a life of hard manual toil usually leaves behind it; the other young, with a clear, smooth complexion and a rather delicate Greek profile. The Libyans stopped their monotonous trudge, evidently glad to have some excuse for a respite from their exertions.    [1] Water columbarium.  \"Ah, ha! Chloë,\" cried one of them, \"how would you like it, with your pretty little feet, to be plodding at this mill all the day? Thank the Gods, the sun will set before a great while. The day has been hot as the lap of an image of Moloch!\"[2]    [2] The Phoenician god, also worshipped in North Africa, in whose idol   was built a fire to consume human sacrifices.  \"Well, Hasdrubal,\" said Chloë, the younger woman, with a pert toss of her head, \"if my feet were as large as yours, and my skin as black and thick, I should not care to complain if I had to work a little now and then.\"  \"Oh! of course,\" retorted Hasdrubal, a little nettled. \"Your ladyship is too refined, too handsome, to reflect that people with black skins as well as white may get heated and weary. Wait five and twenty years, till your cheeks are a bit withered, and see if Master Drusus doesn't give you enough to make you tired from morning till night.\"  \"You rude fellow,\" cried Chloë, pouting with vexation, \"I will not speak to you again. If Master Drusus were here, I would complain of you to him. I have heard that he is not the kind of a master to let a poor maid of his be insulted.\"  \"Oh, be still, you hussy!\" said the elder woman, who felt that a life of labour had spoiled what might have been quite the equal of Chloë's good looks. \"What do you know of Master Drusus? He has been in Athens ever since you were bought. I'll make Mamercus, the steward, believe you ought to be whipped.\"  What tart answer Chloë might have had on the end of her tongue will never be known; for at this moment Mago, the other Libyan, glanced up the road, and cried:--  \"Well, mistress, perhaps you will see our master very soon. He was due this afternoon or next day from Puteoli, and what is that great cloud of dust I see off there in the distance? Can't you make out carriages and horsemen in the midst of it, Hasdrubal?\"  Certainly there was a little cavalcade coming up the highway. Now it was a mere blotch moving in the sun and dust; then clearer; and then out of the cloud of light, flying sand came the clatter of hoofs on the pavement, the whir of wheels, and ahead of the rest of the party two dark Numidian outriders in bright red mantles appeared, pricking along their white African steeds. Chloë clapped her little hands, steadied her water-pot, and sprang up on the staging of the treadmill beside Mago.  \"It is he!\" she cried. \"It must be Master Drusus coming back from Athens!\" She was a bit excited, for an event like the arrival of a new master was a great occurrence in the monotonous life of a country slave.  The cortège was still a good way off.  \"What is Master Drusus like?\" asked Chloë \"Will he be kind, or will he be always whipping like Mamercus?\"  \"He was not in charge of the estate,\" replied Laïs, the older woman, \"when he went away to study at Athens[3] a few years ago. But he was always kind as a lad. Cappadox, his old body-servant, worshipped him. I hope he will take the charge of the farm out of the steward's hands.\"    [3] A few years at the philosophy schools of that famous city were   almost as common to Roman students and men of culture as \"studying   in Germany\" to their American successors.  \"Here he comes!\" cried Hasdrubal. \"I can see him in the nearest carriage.\" And then all four broke out with their salutation, \"_Salve! Salve, Domine!_\"[4] \"Good health to your lordship!\"    [4] Master, \"Lord\" of slaves and freedmen.  A little way behind the outriders rolled a comfortable, four-wheeled, covered carriage,[5] ornamented with handsome embossed plate-work of bronze. Two sleek, jet-black steeds were whirling it swiftly onward. Behind, a couple of equally speedy grey mules were drawing an open wagon loaded with baggage, and containing two smart-looking slave-boys. But all four persons at the treadmill had fixed their eyes on the other conveyance. Besides a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15694"],["title","A Friend of Cæsar: A Tale of the Fall of the Roman Republic. Time, 50-47 B.C. (#1)"],["body","driver, whose ponderous hands seemed too powerful to handle the fine leather reins, there were sitting within an elderly, decently dressed man, and at his side another much younger. The former personage was Pausanias, the freedman and travelling companion[6] of his friend and patron, Quintus Livius Drusus, the \"Master Drusus\" of whom the slaves had been speaking. Chloë's sharp eyes scanned her strange owner very keenly, and the impression he created was not in the least unfavourable. Drusus was apparently of about two and twenty. As he was sitting, he appeared a trifle short in stature, with a thick frame, solid shoulders, long arms, and large hands. His face was distinctively Roman. The features were a little irregular, though not to an unpleasant extent. The profile was aquiline. His eyes were brown and piercing, turning perpetually this way and that, to grasp every detail of the scene around. His dark, reddish hair was clipped close, and his chin was smooth shaven and decidedly firm--stern, even, the face might have been called, except for the relief afforded by a delicately curved mouth--not weak, but affable and ingenuous. Drusus wore a dark travelling cloak,[7] and from underneath it peeped his tunic, with its stripe of narrow purple--the badge of the Roman equestrian order.[8] On his finger was another emblem of nobility--a large, plain, gold ring, conspicuous among several other rings with costly settings.    [5] _Rheda_.    [6] Most wealthy Romans had such a _major domo_, whose position was   often one of honour and trust.    [7] _Pænula_.    [8] The second order of the Roman nobility.  \"_Salve! Salve, Domine!_\" cried the slaves a second time, as the carriage drew near. The young master pushed back the blue woollen curtains in order to gain a better view, then motioned to the driver to stop.  \"Are you slaves of mine?\" was his question. The tone was interested and kindly, and Mago saluted profoundly, and replied:--  \"We are the slaves of the most noble Quintus Livius Drusus, who owns this estate.\"  \"I am he,\" replied the young man, smiling. \"The day is hot. It grows late. You have toiled enough. Go you all and rest. Here, Pausanias, give them each a philippus,[9] with which to remember my home-coming!\"    [9] A Greek gold piece worth about $3.60 at the time of the story.   At this time Rome coined little gold.  \"_Eu! Eu! Io!_[10] _Domine!_\" cried the slaves, giving vent to their delight. And Chloë whispered to Laïs: \"You were right. The new master will be kind. There will not be so many whippings.\"    [10] Good! Good! Hurrah!  But while Pausanias was fumbling in the money-bags, a new instance of the generosity of Drusus was presented. Down a by-path in the field filed a sorrowful company; a long row of slaves in fetters, bound together by a band and chain round the waist of each. They were a disreputable enough gang of unkempt, unshaven, half-clothed wretches: Gauls and Germans with fair hair and giant physiques; dark-haired Syrians; black-skinned Africans,--all panting and groaning, clanking their chains, and cursing softly at the two sullen overseers, who, with heavy-loaded whips, were literally driving them down into the road.  Again Drusus spoke.  \"Whose slaves are these? Mine?\"  \"They are your lordship's,\" said the foremost overseer, who had just recognized his newly come employer.  \"Why are they in chains?\" asked Drusus.  \"Mamercus found them refractory,\" replied the guard, \"and ordered them to be kept in the underground prison,[11] and to work in the chain gang.\"    [11] _Ergastulum_.  The young man made a motion of disgust.  \"Bah!\" he remarked, \"the whole _familia_[12] will be in fetters if Mamercus has his way much longer. Knock off those chains. Tell the wretches they are to remain unshackled only so long as they behave. Give them three skins to-night from which to drink their master's health. Drive on, Cappadox!\"    [12] Slave household.  And before the fettered slaves could comprehend their release from confinement, and break out into a chorus of barbarous and uncouth thanksgivings and blessings, the carriage had vanished from sight down the turn of the road.   II  Who was Quintus Livius Drusus? Doubtless he would have felt highly insulted if his family history had not been fairly well known to every respectable person around Præneste and to a very large and select circle at Rome. When a man could take Livius[13] for his gentile name, and Drusus for his cognomen, he had a right to hold his head high, and regard himself as one of the noblest and best of the imperial city. But of course the Drusian house had a number of branches, and the history of Quintus's direct family was this. He was the grandson of that Marcus Livius Drusus[14] who, though an aristocrat of the aristocrats, had dared to believe that the oligarchs were too strong, the Roman Commons without character, and that the Italian freemen were suffering from wrongs inflicted by both of the parties at the capital. For his efforts to right the abuses, he had met with a reward very common to statesmen of his day, a dagger-thrust from the hand of an undiscovered assassin. He had left a son, Sextus, a man of culture and talent, who remembered his father's fate, and walked for a time warily in politics. Sextus had married twice. Once to a very noble lady of the Fabian gens, the mother of his son Quintus. Then some years after her death he took in marriage a reigning beauty, a certain Valeria, who soon developed such extravagance and frivolity, that, soon after she bore him a daughter, he was forced \"to send her a messenger\"; in other words, to divorce her. The daughter had been put under the guardianship of Sextus's sister-in-law Fabia, one of the Vestal virgins at Rome. Sextus himself had accepted an appointment to a tribuneship in a legion of Cæsar in Gaul. When he departed for the wars he took with him as fellow officer a life-long friend, Caius Cornelius Lentulus; and ere leaving for the campaign the two had formed a compact quite in keeping with the stern Roman spirit that made the child the slave of the father: Young Quintus Drusus should marry Cornelia, Lentulus's only child, as soon as the two came to a proper age. And so the friends went away to win glory in Gaul; to perish side by side, when Sabinus's ill-fated legion was cut off by the Eburones.[15]    [13] Every Roman had a _prænomen_, or \"Christian name\"; also a gentile   name of the gens or clan to which he belonged; and commonly in addition   a cognomen, usually an epithet descriptive of some personal peculiarity   of an ancestor, which had fastened itself upon the immediate descendants   of that ancestor. The _Livii Drusi_ were among the noblest of the Roman   houses.    [14] Died in 91 B.C.    [15] In 54 B.C.  The son and the daughter remained. Quintus Drusus had had kindly guardians; he had been sent for four years to the \"University\" at Athens; had studied rhetoric and philosophy; and now he was back with his career before him,--master of himself, of a goodly fortune, of a noble inheritance of high-born ancestry. And he was to marry Cornelia. No thought of thwarting his father's mandate crossed his mind; he was bound by the decree of the dead. He had not seen his betrothed for four years. He remembered her as a bright-eyed, merry little girl, who had an arch way of making all to mind her. But he remembered too, that her mother was a vapid lady of fashion, that her uncle and guardian was Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Crus, Consul-elect,[16] a man of little refinement or character. And four years were long enough to mar a young girl's life. What would she be like? What had time made of her? The curiosity--we will not call it passion--was overpowering. Pure \"love\" was seldom recognized as such by the age. When the carriage reached a spot where two roads forked, leading to adjacent estates, Drusus alighted.    [16] The two Roman consuls were magistrates of the highest rank, and   were chosen each year by the people.  \"Is her ladyship Cornelia at the villa of the Lentuli?\" was his demand of a gardener who was trimming a hedge along the way.  \"Ah! Master Drusus,\" cried the fellow, dropping his sickle in delight. \"Joy to see you! Yes, she is in the grove by the villa; by the great cypress you know so well. But how you have changed, sir--\"  But Drusus was off. The path was familiar. Through the trees he caught glimpses of the stately mazes of colonnades of the Lentulan villa, surrounded by its artificially arranged gardens, and its wide stretches of lawn and orchard. The grove had been his playground. Here was the oak under which Cornelia and he had gathered acorns. The remnants of the little brush house they had built still survived. His step quickened. He heard the rush of the little stream that wound through the grove. Then he saw ahead of him a fern thicket, and the brook flashing its water beyond. In his recollection a bridge had here crossed the streamlet. It had been removed. Just across, swayed the huge cypress. Drusus stepped forward. At last! He pushed carefully through the thicket, making only a little noise, and glanced across the brook.  There were ferns all around the cypress. Ivies twined about its trunk. On the bank the green turf looked dry, but cool. Just under the tree the brook broke into a miniature cascade, and went rippling down in a score of pygmy, sparkling waterfalls. On a tiny promontory a marble nymph, a fine bit of Greek sculpture, was pouring, without respite, from a water-urn into the gurgling flood. But Drusus did not gaze at the nymph. Close beside the image, half lying, half sitting, in an abandon only to be produced by a belief that she was quite alone, rested a young woman. It was Cornelia.  Drusus had made no disturbance, and the object on which he fastened his eyes had not been in the least stirred out of a rather deep reverie. He stood for a while half bashful, half contemplative. Cornelia had taken off her shoes and let her little"]]]
