She wore only her white tunic, and had pushed it back so that her arms were almost bare. At the moment she was resting lazily on one elbow, and gazing abstractedly up at the moving ocean of green overhead. She was only sixteen; but in the warm Italian clime that age had brought her to maturity. No one would have said that she was beautiful, from the point of view of mere softly sensuous Greek beauty. Rather, she was handsome, as became the daughter of Cornelii and Claudii. She was tall; her hair, which was bound in a plain knot on the back of her head, was dark--almost black; her eyes were large, grey, lustrous, and on occasion could be proud and angry. Yet with it all she was pretty--pretty, said Drusus to himself, as any girl he had seen in Athens. For there were coy dimples in her delicate little chin, her finely chiselled features were not angular, while her cheeks were aglow with a healthy colour that needed no rouge to heighten. In short, Cornelia, like Drusus, was a Roman; and Drusus saw that she was a Roman, and was glad.  Presently something broke the reverie. Cornelia's eyes dropped from the treetops, and lighted up with attention. One glance across the brook into the fern thicket; then one irrepressible feminine scream; and then:--  \"Cornelia!\" \"Quintus!\"  Drusus sprang forward, but almost fell into the brooklet. The bridge was gone. Cornelia had started up, and tried to cover her arms and shake her tunic over her feet. Her cheeks were all smiles and blushes. But Drusus's situation was both pathetic and ludicrous. He had his fiancée almost in his arms, and yet the stream stopped him. Instantly Cornelia was in laughter.  \"Oh! My second Leander,\" she cried, \"will you be brave, and swim again from Abydos to Sestos to meet your Hero?\"  \"Better!\" replied Drusus, now nettled; \"see!\" And though the leap was a long one he cleared it, and landed close by the marble nymph.  Drusus had not exactly mapped out for himself the method of approaching the young woman who had been his child playmate. Cornelia, however, solved all his perplexity. Changing suddenly from laughter into what were almost tears, she flung her arms around his neck, and kissed him again and again.  \"Oh, Quintus! Quintus!\" she cried, nearly sobbing, \"_I am_ so glad you have come!\"  \"And I am glad,\" said the young man, perhaps with a tremor in his voice.  \"I never knew how I wanted you, until you are here,\" she continued; \"I didn't look for you to-day. I supposed you would come from Puteoli to-morrow. Oh! Quintus, you must be very kind to me. Perhaps I am very stupid. But I am tired, tired.\"  Drusus looked at her in a bit of astonishment.  \"Tired! I can't see that you look fatigued.\"  \"Not in body,\" went on Cornelia, still holding on to him. \"But here, sit down on the grass. Let me hold your hands. You do not mind. I want to talk with you. No, don't interrupt. I must tell you. I have been here in Præneste only a week. I wanted to get away from Baiæ.[17] I was afraid to stay there with my mother.\"    [17] The famous watering-place on the Bay of Naples.  \"Afraid to stay at that lovely seashore house with your mother!\" exclaimed Drusus, by no means unwilling to sit as entreated, but rather bewildered in mind.  \"I was afraid of Lucius Ahenobarbus, the consular[18] Domitius's second son. _I don't like him! there!_\" and Cornelia's grey eyes lit up with menacing fire.    [18] An ex-consul was known by this title.  \"Afraid of Lucius Ahenobarbus!\" laughed Drusus. \"Well, I don't think I call him a very dear friend. But why should he trouble you?\"  \"It was ever since last spring, when I was in the new theatre[19] seeing the play, that he came around, thrust himself upon me, and tried to pay attentions. Then he has kept them up ever since; he followed us to Baiæ; and the worst of it is, my mother and uncle rather favour him. So I had Stephanus, my friend the physician, say that sea air was not good for me, and I was sent here. My mother and uncle will come in a few days, but not that fellow Lucius, I hope. I was so tired trying to keep him off.\"    [19] Built by Pompeius the Great, in 55-54 B.C.  \"I will take care of the knave,\" said Drusus, smiling. \"So this is the trouble? I wonder that your mother should have anything to do with such a fellow. I hear in letters that he goes with a disreputable gang. He is a boon companion with Marcus Læca, the old Catilinian,[20] who is a smooth-headed villain, and to use a phrase of my father's good friend Cicero--'has his head and eyebrows always shaved, that he may not be said to have one hair of an honest man about him.' But he will have to reckon with me now. Now it is my turn to talk. Your long story has been very short. Nor is mine long. My old uncle Publius Vibulanus is dead. I never knew him well enough to be able to mourn him bitterly. Enough, he died at ninety; and just as I arrive at Puteoli comes a message that I am his sole heir. His freedmen knew I was coming, embalmed the body, and wait for me to go to Rome to-morrow to give the funeral oration and light the pyre. He has left a fortune fit to compare with that of Crassus[21]--real estate, investments, a lovely villa at Tusculum. And now I--no, _we_--are wealthy beyond avarice. Shall we not thank the Gods?\"    [20] A member of the band who with Catiline conspired in 63 B.C. to   overthrow the Roman government.    [21] The Roman millionaire who had just been slain in Parthia.  \"I thank them for nothing,\" was her answer; then more shyly, \"except for your own coming; for, Quintus, you--you--will marry me before very long?\"  \"What hinders?\" cried the other, in the best of spirits. \"To-morrow I go to Rome; then back again! And then all Præneste will flock to our marriage train. No, pout no more over Lucius Ahenobarbus. He shan't pay disagreeable attentions. And now over to the old villa; for Mamercus is eating his heart out to see me!\"  And away they went arm in arm.  Drusus's head was in the air. He had resolved to marry Cornelia, cost what it might to his desires. He knew now that he was affianced to the one maiden in the world quite after his own heart.   III  The paternal villa of Drusus lay on the lower part of the slope of the Præneste citadel, facing the east. It was a genuine country and farming estate--not a mere refuge from the city heat and hubbub. The Drusi had dwelt on it for generations, and Quintus had spent his boyhood upon it. The whole mass of farm land was in the very pink of cultivation. There were lines of stately old elms enclosing the estate; and within, in regular sequence, lay vineyards producing the rather poor Præneste wine, olive orchards, groves of walnut trees, and many other fruits. Returning to the point where he had left the carriage, Drusus led Cornelia up a broad avenue flanked by noble planes and cypresses. Before them soon stood, or rather stretched, the country house. It was a large grey stone building, added to, from time to time, by successive owners. Only in front did it show signs of modern taste and elegance. Here ran a colonnade of twelve red porphyry pillars, with Corinthian capitals. The part of the house reserved for the master lay behind this entrance way. Back of it rambled the structure used by the farm steward, and the slaves and cattle. The whole house was low--in fact practically one-storied; and the effect produced was perhaps substantial, but hardly imposing.  Up the broad avenue went the two young people; too busy with their own gay chatter to notice at a distance how figures were running in and out amid the colonnade, and how the pillars were festooned with flowers. But as they drew nearer a throng was evident. The whole farm establishment--men, women, and children--had assembled, garlanded and gayly dressed, to greet the young master. Perhaps five hundred persons--nearly all slaves--had been employed on the huge estate, and they were all at hand. As Drusus came up the avenue, a general shout of welcome greeted him.  \"_Ave! Ave! Domine!_\" and there were some shouts as Cornelia was seen of, \"_Ave! Domina!_\"  \"_Domina_[22] here very soon,\" said Drusus, smiling to the young lady; and disengaging himself from her, he advanced to greet personally a tall, ponderous figure, with white, flowing hair, a huge white beard, and a left arm that had been severed at the wrist, who came forward with a swinging military stride that seemed to belie his evident years.    [22] _Domina_, mistress.  \"All hail, dearest Mamercus!\" exclaimed the young man, running up to the burly object. \"Here is the little boy you used to scold, fondle, and tell stories to, back safe and sound to hear the old tales and to listen to some more admonitions.\"  The veteran made a hurried motion with his remaining hand, as if to brush something away from his eyes, and his deep voice seemed a trifle husky when he replied, speaking slowly:--  \"_Mehercle!_[23] All the Gods be praised! The noble Sextus living again in the form of his son! Ah! This makes my old heart glad;\" and he held out his hand to Drusus. But the young man dashed it away, and flinging his arms around Mamercus's neck, kissed him on both cheeks. Then when this warm greeting was over, Drusus had to salute Titus Mamercus, a solid, stocky, honest-faced country lad of eighteen, the son of the veteran; and after Titus--since the Mamerci and Drusi were remotely related and the _jus oscului_[24]--less legally, the \"right of kissing\"--existed between them, he felt called upon to press the cheek of Æmilia, Mamercus's pretty daughter, of about her brother's age. Cornelia seemed a little discomposed at this, and perhaps so gave her lover a trifling delight. But next he had to shake all the freedmen by the hand, also the older and better known slaves; and to say something in reply to their congratulations. The mass of the slaves he could not know personally; but to the assembled company he spoke a few words, with that quiet dignity which belongs to those who are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15694"],["title","A Friend of Cæsar: A Tale of the Fall of the Roman Republic. Time, 50-47 B.C. (#3)"],["body","heirs of generations of lordly ancestors.    [23] By Hercules.    [24] The right of kissing kinsfolk within the sixth degree.  \"This day I assume control of my estate. All past offences are forgiven. I remit any punishments, however justly imposed. To those who are my faithful servants and clients I will prove a kind and reasonable master. Let none in the future be mischievous or idle; for them I cannot spare. But since the season is hot, in honour of my home-coming, for the next ten days I order that no work, beyond that barely needed, be done in the fields. Let the familia enjoy rest, and let them receive as much wine as they may take without being unduly drunken. Geta, Antiochus, and Kebes, who have been in this house many years, shall go with me before the prætor, to be set free.\"  And then, while the slaves still shouted their _aves_ and _salves_, Mamercus led Drusus and Cornelia through the old villa, through the atrium where the fountain tinkled, and the smoky, waxen death-masks of Quintus's noble ancestors grinned from the presses on the wall; through the handsomely furnished rooms for the master of the house; out to the barns and storehouses, that stretched away in the rear of the great farm building. Much pride had the veteran when he showed the sleek cattle, the cackling poultry-yard, and the tall stacks of hay; only he growled bitterly over what he termed the ill-timed leniency of his young patron in releasing the slaves in the chain-gang.  \"Oh, such times!\" he muttered in his beard; \"here's this young upstart coming home, and teaches me that such dogs as I put in fetters are better set at large! There'll be a slave revolt next, and some night all our throats will be cut. But it's none of my doing.\"  \"Well,\" said Drusus, smiling, \"I've been interested at Athens in learning from philosophy that one owes some kindness even to a slave. But it's always your way, Mamercus, to tell how much better the old times were than the new.\"  \"And I am right,\" growled the other. \"Hasn't a man who fought with Marius, and helped to beat those northern giants, the Cimbri and Teutones, a right to his opinion? The times are evil--evil! No justice in the courts. No patriotism in the Senate. Rascality in every consul and prætor. And the 'Roman People' orators declaim about are only a mob! _Vah!_ We need an end to this game of fauns and satyrs!\"  \"Come,\" said Drusus, \"we are not at such a direful strait yet. There is one man at least whom I am convinced is not altogether a knave; and I have determined to throw in my lot with him. Do you guess, Mamercus?\"  \"Cæsar?\"  Drusus nodded. Mamercus broke out into a shout of approval.  \"_Euge!_ Unless my son Decimus, who is centurion with him, writes me false, _he_ is a man!\"  But Cornelia was distressed of face.  \"Quintus,\" she said very gravely, \"do you know that I have often heard that Cæsar is a wicked libertine, who wishes to make himself tyrant? What have you done?\"  \"Nothing rashly,\" said Drusus, also quite grave; \"but I have counted the matter on both sides--the side of Pompeius and the Senate, and the side of Cæsar--and I have written to Balbus, Cæsar's manager at Rome, that I shall use my tiny influence for the proconsul of the Gauls.\"  Cornelia seemed greatly affected; she clasped and unclasped her hands, pressed them to her brows; then when she let them fall, she was again smiling.  \"Quintus,\" she said, putting her arm around him, \"Quintus, I am only a silly little girl. I do not know anything about politics. You are wiser than I, and I can trust you. But please don't quarrel with my uncle Lentulus about your decision. He would be terribly angry.\"  Quintus smiled in turn, and kissing her, said: \"Can you trust me? I hope so. And be assured I will do all I may, not to quarrel with your uncle. And now away with all this silly serious talk! What a pity for Mamercus to have been so gloomy as to introduce it! What a pity I must go to Rome to-morrow, and leave this dear old place! But then, I have to see my aunt Fabia, and little Livia, the sister I haven't met since she was a baby. And while I am in Rome I will do something else--can you guess?\" Cornelia shook her head. \"Carpenters, painters, masons! I will send them out to make this old villa fresh and pretty for some one who, I hope, will come here to live in about a month. No, don't run away,\" for Cornelia was trying to hide her flushed face by flight; \"I have something else to get--a present for your own dear self. What shall it be? I am rich; cost does not matter.\"  Cornelia pursed her lips in thought.  \"Well,\" she remarked, \"if you could bring me out a pretty boy, not too old or too young, one that was honest and quick-witted, he would be very convenient to carry messages to you, and to do any little business for me.\"  Cornelia asked for a slave-boy just as she might have asked for a new pony, with that indifference to the question of humanity which indicated that the demarcation between a slave and an animal was very slight in her mind.  \"Oh! that is nothing,\" said Drusus; \"you shall have the handsomest and cleverest in all Rome. And if Mamercus complains that I am extravagant in remodelling the house, let him remember that his wonderful Cæsar, when a young man, head over ears in debt, built an expensive villa at Aricia, and then pulled it down to the foundations and rebuilt on an improved plan. Farewell, Sir Veteran, I will take Cornelia home, and then come back for that dinner which I know the cook has made ready with his best art.\"  Arm in arm the young people went away down the avenue of shade trees, dim in the gathering twilight. Mamercus stood gazing after them.  \"What a pity! What a pity!\" he repeated to himself, \"that Sextus and Caius are not alive; how they would have rejoiced in their children! Why do the fates order things as they do? Only let them be kind enough to let me live until I hold another little Drusus on my knee, and tell him of the great battles! But the Gods forbid, Lentulus should find out speedily that his lordship has gone over to Cæsar; or there will be trouble enough for both his lordship and my lady. The consul-elect is a stubborn, bitter man. He would be terribly offended to give his niece in marriage to a political enemy. But it may all turn out well. Who knows?\" And he went into the house.     Chapter II  The Upper Walks of Society   I  It was very early in the morning. From the streets, far below, a dull rumbling was drifting in at the small, dim windows. On the couch, behind some faded curtains, a man turned and yawned, grunted and rubbed his eyes. The noise of the heavy timber, stone, and merchandise wagons hastening out of the city before daybreak,[25] jarred the room, and made sleep almost impossible. The person awakened swore quietly to himself in Greek.    [25] No teaming was allowed in Rome by day.  \"_Heracles!_ Was ever one in such a city! What malevolent spirit brought me here? Throat-cutting on the streets at night; highwaymen in every foul alley; unsafe to stir at evening without an armed band! No police worth mentioning; freshets every now and then; fires every day or else a building tumbles down. And then they must wake me up at an unearthly hour in the morning. Curses on me for ever coming near the place!\" And the speaker rolled over on the bed, and shook himself, preparatory to getting up.  \"Bah! Can these Roman dogs never learn that power is to be used, not abused? Why don't they spend some of their revenues to level these seven hills that shut off the light, and straighten and widen their abominable, ill-paved streets, and keep houses from piling up as if to storm Olympus? Pshaw, I had better stop croaking, and be up and about.\"  The speaker sat up in bed, and clapped his hands. Into the ill-lighted and unpretentiously furnished room came a tall, bony, ebon-skinned old Ethiopian, very scantily attired, who awaited the wishes of his master.  \"Come, Sesostris,\" said the latter, \"get out my best _himation_[26]--the one with the azure tint. Give me a clean _chiton_,[27] and help me dress.\"    [26] Greek outer mantle.    [27] Greek under garment.  And while the servant bustled briskly about his work, Pratinas, for such was his lord's name, continued his monologue, ignoring the presence of his attendant. \"Not so bad with me after all. Six years ago to-day it was I came to Rome, with barely an obol of ready money, to make my fortune by my wits. Zeus! But I can't but say I've succeeded. A thousand sesterces here and five hundred there, and now and then a better stroke of fortune--politics, intrigues, gambling; all to the same end. And now?--oh, yes, my 'friends' would say I am very respectable, but quite poor--but they don't know how I have economized, and how my account stands with Sosthenes the banker at Alexandria. My old acquaintance with Lucius Domitius was of some use. A few more months of this life and I am away from this beastly Rome, to enjoy myself among civilized people.\"  Pratinas went over to a large wooden chest with iron clasps, unlocked it, and gazed for a moment inside with evident satisfaction. \"There are six good talents in there,\" he remarked to himself, \"and then there is Artemisia.\"  He had barely concluded this last, hardly intelligible assertion, when the curtain of the room was pushed aside, and in came a short, plump, rosy-faced little maiden of twelve, with a clearly chiselled Greek profile and lips as red as a cherry. Her white chiton was mussed and a trifle soiled; and her thick black hair was tied back in a low knot, so as to cover what were two very shapely little ears. All in all, she presented a very pretty picture, as the sunlight streamed over her, when she drew back the hangings at the window.  \"Good morning, Uncle Pratinas,\" she said sweetly.  \"Good morning, Artemisia, my dear,\" replied the other, giving her round neck a kiss, and a playful pinch. \"You will practise on your lyre, and let Sesostris teach you to sing. You know we shall go"]]]
