FOOTNOTES:  [Footnote 1: We recommend those who desire more curious information on the fauna and flora of the Keeling Islands to apply to Henry O. Forbes' most interesting book, _A Naturalist's Wanderings in the Eastern Archipelago_.--(Sampson Low.)]     CHAPTER V.  CAPTAIN ROY SURPRISES AND GRATIFIES HIS SON, WHO SURPRISES A NEGRO, AND SUDDENLY FORMS AN ASTONISHING RESOLVE.   Arrived in Batavia--the low-lying seaport and capital of the Dutch island of Java--Captain Roy had his brig examined, and found that the damage she had sustained was so serious that several months would probably elapse before she would be again ready for sea.  \"Now, Nigel, my lad,\" said the old gentleman, on the morning after the examination had been made, \"come down below with me; I want to have a confabulation with 'ee.\"  \"Why, father,\" said the youth, when seated at the small cabin table opposite his rugged parent, \"you seem to be in an unusually solemn frame of mind this morning. Has anything happened?\"  \"Nothin', boy--nothin'. Leastwise nothin' in particular. You know all about the brig, an' what a deal o' repair she's got to undergo?\"  \"Of course I do. You know I was present when you talked the matter over with that fellow--what's-'is-name--that gave you his report.\"  \"Just so. Well now, Nigel, you don't suppose, do you, that I'm goin' to keep you here for some months knockin' about with nothin' to do--eatin' your grub in idleness?\"  \"Certainly not,\" said the youth, regarding the stern countenance of his parent with an amused look. \"I have no intention of acting such an ignoble part, and I'm surprised at you askin' the question, for you know I am not lazy--at least not more so than average active men--and there must be plenty of work for me to do in looking after the cargo, superintending repairs, taking care of the ship and men. I wonder at you, father. You must either have had a shock of dotage, or fallen into a poetical vein. What is a first mate fit for if--\"  \"Nigel,\" said Captain Roy, interrupting, \"I'm the owner an' commander of the _Sunshine_, besides bein' the paternal parent of an impertinent son, and I claim to have the right to do as I please--therefore, hold your tongue and listen to me.\"  \"All right, father,\" replied the young man, with a benignant grin; \"proceed, but don't be hard upon me; spare my feelings.\"  \"Well now, this is how the land lies,\" said the old seaman, resting his elbows on the table and clasping his hands before him. \"As Mr. Moor and I, with the stooard and men, are quite sufficient to manage the affairs o' the brig, and as we shall certainly be here for a considerable time to come, I've made up my mind to give you a holiday. You're young, you see, an' foolish, and your mind needs improvin'. In short, you want a good deal o' the poetry knocked out o' you, for it's not like your mother's poetry by any means, so you needn't flatter yourself--not built on the same lines by a long way. Well--where was I?\"  \"Only got the length of the holiday yet, father.\"  \"Only, indeed. You ungrateful dog! It's a considerable length to get, that, isn't it? Well, I also intend to give you some money, to enable you to move about in this curious archipelago--not much, but enough to keep you from starvation if used with economy, so I recommend you to go into the town, make general inquiries about everything and everywhere, an' settle in your mind what you'll do, for I give you a rovin' commission an' don't want to be bothered with you for some time to come.\"  \"Are you in earnest, father?\" asked Nigel, who had become more interested while the captain unfolded his plan.  \"Never more in earnest in my life--except, p'raps, when I inquired over twenty years ago whether you was a boy or a gurl.\"  \"Well, now, that _is_ good of you, father. Of course I need not say that I am charmed at the prospect you open up to me. And--and when may I start?\"  \"At once. Up anchor and away to-night if you choose.\"  \"But--where?\"  \"Anywhere--everywhere, Java, Sumatra, Borneo--all Malaysia before you where to choose. Now be off, and think over it, for I've got too much to do to waste time on you at present,\" said the captain, rising, \"and, stay--Nigel.\"  \"Well?\" said the youth, looking back as he was about to leave the cabin.  \"Whatever you do, don't grow poetical about it. You know it is said somewhere, that mischief is found for idle hands to do.\"  \"All right, father. I'll keep clear of poetry--leave all that sort o' nonsense to _you_. I'll--      \"I'll flee Temptation's siren voice,       Throw poesy to the crows,     And let my soul's ethereal fire       Gush out in sober prose.\"  It need scarcely be said that our hero was not slow to take advantage of the opportunity thus thrown in his way. He went off immediately through the town, armed with the introduction of his father's well-known name, and made inquiries of all sorts of people as to the nature, the conditions, the facilities, and the prospects of travel in the Malay Archipelago. In this quest he found himself sorely perplexed for the very good reason that \"all sorts\" of people, having all sorts of ideas and tastes, gave amazingly conflicting accounts of the region and its attractions.  Wearied at last with his researches, he sauntered towards afternoon in the direction of the port, and began in a listless sort of way to watch the movements of a man who was busily engaged with a boat, as if he were making preparations to put to sea.  Now, whatever philosophers may say to the contrary, we hold strongly to the opinion that likings and dislikings among men and women and children are the result of some profound occult cause which has nothing whatever to do with experience. No doubt experience may afterwards come in to modify or intensify the feelings, but it is not the originating cause. If you say it is, how are we to account for love at first sight? Beauty has nothing necessarily to do with it, for men fall in love at first sight with what the world calls plain women--happily! Character is not the cause, for love assails the human breast, ofttimes, before the loved object has uttered a word, or perpetrated a smile, or even fulminated a glance to indicate character. So, in like manner, affection may arise between man and man.  It was so on this occasion with Nigel Roy. As he stood abstractedly gazing at the boatman he fell in love with him--at least he took a powerful fancy to him, and this was all the more surprising that the man was a negro,--a woolly-headed, flat-nosed, thick-lipped nigger!  We would not for a moment have it supposed that it is unnatural to love such a man. Quite the reverse. But when such a man is a perfect stranger, has never uttered a word in one's presence, or vouchsafed so much as a glance, and is gravely, stolidly engaged in the unsavoury work of greasing some of the tackling of a boat, it does seem unaccountable that he should be unwittingly capable of stirring up in another man's bosom feelings of ardent goodwill, to put it mildly.  After watching him for some time, Nigel under an almost involuntary impulse shouted \"Hullo!\"  \"Hullo!\" replied the negro, looking up with a somewhat stern frown and a pout of his thick lips, as much as to say--\"Who are _you_?\"  Nigel smiled, and made that suggestive motion with his forefinger which signifies \"Come here.\"  The frown fled and the pout became a smile as the negro approached, wiping his hands on a piece of cotton-waste.  \"What you want wi' _me_, sar?\" he asked.  \"Well, upon my word,\" said Nigel, somewhat perplexed, \"I can't very well say. I suppose something must have been in my mind, but--anyhow, I felt a desire to have a talk with you; that is, if you can spare the time.\"  The first part of this reply induced a slight recurrence of the frown and pout, but at its conclusion the black brow cleared and the mouth expanded to such a gum-and-teeth-exposing extent that Nigel fairly burst into a laugh.  \"You's bery good, sar,\" said the man, \"an' I's hab much pleasure to make your acquaintance.--Der an't no grease on 'em now.\"  The last remark had reference to the enormous black paw which he held out.  Nigel at once grasped it and shook it heartily.  \"I's bery fond ob a talk, sar,\" continued the negro, \"so as you wants one, heabe ahead.\"  Thus encouraged, our hero began by remarking that he seemed to be preparing for a trip.  \"Dat's zackly what I's a-doin', sar.\"  \"A long one?\"  \"Well, dat depends on what you call short. Goin' to Sunda Straits, which p'raps you know, sar, is nigh a hundred miles fro' here.\"  \"And what may you be going to do there?\" asked Nigel.  \"Goin' home to Krakatoa.\"  \"Why, I thought that was an uninhabited island. I passed close to it on my way here, and saw no sign of inhabitants.\"  \"Da's cause I was absint fro' home. An' massa he keeps indoors a good deal.\"  \"And pray who is massa?\" asked Nigel.  \"Sar,\" said the negro, drawing up his square sturdy frame with a look of dignity; \"fair-play is eberyt'ing wid me. You've ax me a heap o' questions. Now's my--turn. Whar you comes fro'?\"  \"From England,\" replied Nigel.  \"An' whar you go to?\"  \"Well, you've posed me now, for I really don't know where I'm going to. In fact that is the very thing I have been trying to find out all day, so if you'll help me I'll be much obliged.\"  Here Nigel explained his position and difficulties, and it was quite obvious, judging from the glittering eyes and mobile mouth, that he poured his tale into peculiarly sympathetic ears. When he had finished, the negro stood for a considerable time gazing in meditative silence at the sky.  \"Yes,\" he said at last, as if communing with himself, \"I t'ink--I ain't quite sure, but I t'ink--I may ventur'.\"  \"Whatever it is you are thinking about,\" remarked Nigel, \"you may venture to say anything you like to _me_.\"  The negro, who, although comparatively short of stature, was herculean in build, looked at the youth with an amused expression.  \"You're bery good,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15348"],["title","Blown to Bits; or, The Lonely Man of Rakata (#7)"],["body",", but da's not what I's t'inkin' ob. I's t'inkin' whedder I dar' ventur' to introdoce you to my massa. He's not fond o' company, an' it might make 'im angry, but he came by a heaby loss lately an' p'raps he may cond'send to receibe you. Anyhow you 'd be quite safe, for he's sure to be civil to any friend ob mine.\"  \"Is he then so fierce?\" asked Nigel, becoming interested as well as amused.  \"Fierce! no, he's gentle as a lamb, but he's awrful when he's roused--tigers, crokindiles, 'noceroses is nuffin' to him!\"  \"Indeed! what's his name, and what does he do? How does he live?\"  The negro shook his head. \"Da's more'n I dar tell till I ax his leave, sar. I kin only say de peepil around calls 'im the hermit ob Rakata, 'cause he libs by his self (wid me, ob course, but _I_ counts for nuffin), close under de ole volcano ob Krakatoa. Dey tink--some ob de foolish peepil--dat he hab sold his-self to de dibil, but I knows better. He's a good man, and you'd hab great fun if you stop wid him. Now, what I's a-gwine to advise you is, come wid me an' see de hermit. If he lets you stop, good. If not, I fetch you ober to de main land--whar you please--an' you kin come back here or go whar you choose. Its wort' your while to take your chance, anyhow.\"  The negro said this with such an earnest look that Nigel made up his mind on the spot to accept this curious invitation.  \"I'll go!\" he exclaimed with sudden energy. \"When do you start?\"  \"To-morrer at daybreak, sar.\"  \"Well, I shall have to talk it over first with my father, but I'm sure he won't object, so you may look out for me here at daybreak. Shall I have to fetch any provisions with me for the voyage?\"  \"No, nuffin'. Boat's crammed wi' grub. But you'd better bring a gun o' some sort an' a 'volver, an' a big knife, an' a mortal big appetite, for a man's no good widout dat.\"  \"I always carry that about with me,\" said the youth, \"whatever else I may leave behind; and I'll see to the other things.--By the way, what's your name?\"  \"Moses.\"  \"Is that all?\"  \"Isn't dat enuff?\" returned the negro with a look of dignity.  \"Quite; but I have the advantage of you there, Moses, for I have two names--Nigel Roy.\"  \"Well, I don't see much use ob two, but which does you like to be called by--Nadgel or Roy?\"  \"Whichever you please, Moses; I'll answer to either. So now, good-bye for the present, and look out for me to-morrow at daylight.\"  \"Good-bye, Massa Nadgel, till to-morrer.\"  The negro waved his hand and, sauntering slowly back to his boat, remarked in an undertone, \"I lub dat young feller!\" Saying which, he resumed his greasing operations.  Of course Captain Roy made no objection to his son's proposal, though he freely gave his opinion that it was a wild-goose chase.  \"However, lad, please yourself and you'll please me,\" he added; \"and now, be particular to bear in mind that you've got to write to me every time you get within hail of a post-office or a passing ship or steamer that may chance to be comin' this way, and in each letter be sure to tell me where you're goin' to next, so as I may send a letter there to you in case I want you to return sudden or otherwise. We mustn't lose touch, you see. You needn't write long screeds. I only want to know your whereabouts from time to time. For the rest--you can spin it out in yarns when you come back.\"     CHAPTER VI.  THE HERMIT OF RAKATA INTRODUCED.   Nothing worthy of particular note occurred during the boat-voyage along the northern shore of Java to Sunda Straits. A fair, steady breeze wafted them westward, and, on the morning of the third day, they came in sight of the comparatively small uninhabited island of Krakatoa.  The boat in which they voyaged, although a little one, had a small portion of the bow decked over, so that our hero and his sable friend could find shelter from the night air when disposed to sleep and from the fierce rays of the sun at noon.  By the advice of his father, Nigel had changed his sailor costume for the \"shore-goin' toggery\" in which he had landed on the Keeling Islands, as being more suitable to his new character as a traveller, namely, a white cloth cap with a peak in front and a curtain behind to protect his neck, a light-grey tunic belted at the waist, and a pair of strong canvas trousers. He had also purchased an old-fashioned double-barrelled fowling-piece, muzzle-loading and with percussion locks.  \"For you see, Nigel,\" the captain had said, \"it's all very well to use breech-loaders when you've got towns and railways and suchlike to supply you wi' cartridges, but when you've got to cruise in out-o'-the-way waters, there's nothin' like the old style. It's not difficult to carry a few thousand percussion-caps an' a bullet-mould about wi' you wherever you go. As to powder, why, you'll come across that 'most everywhere, an' lead too; and, for the matter o' that, if your life depended on it you could shove a handful of gravel or a pen-knife or tooth-pick into your gun an' blaze away, but with a breech-loader, if you run out o' cartridges, where are you?\"  So, as Nigel could not say where he was, the percussion-gun had been purchased.  The peak of Rakata--the highest in the island--a little over 2600 feet, came in sight first; gradually the rest of the island rose out of the horizon, and ere long the rich tropical verdure became distinguishable.  Krakatoa--destined so soon to play a thrilling part in the world's history; to change the aspect of the heavens everywhere; to attract the wondering gaze of nearly all nations, and to devastate its immediate neighbourhood--is of volcanic origin, and, at the time we write of (1883) was beginning to awaken from a long, deep slumber of two hundred years. Its last explosion occurred in the year 1680. Since that date it had remained quiet. But now the tremendous subterranean forces which had originally called it into being were beginning to reassert their existence and their power. Vulcan was rousing himself again and beginning once more to blow his bellows. So said some of the sailors who were constantly going close past the island and through Sunda Straits, which may be styled the narrows of the world's highway to the China seas.  Subterranean forces, however, are so constantly at work more or less violently in those regions that people took little notice of these indications in the comparatively small island of Krakatoa, which was between five and six miles long by four broad.  As we have said, it was uninhabited, and lying as it does between Sumatra and Java, about sixteen miles from the former and over twenty miles from the latter, it was occasionally visited by fishermen. The hermit whom Nigel was about to visit might, in some sort, be counted an inhabitant, for he had dwelt there many years, but he lived in a cave which was difficult of access, and held communication with no one. How he spent his time was a mystery, for although his negro servant went to the neighbouring town of Anjer in Java for supplies, and sometimes to Batavia, as we have seen, no piece of inanimate ebony from the forest could have been less communicative than he. Indeed, our hero was the first to unlock the door of his lips, with that key of mysterious sympathy to which reference has already been made. Some of the bolder of the young fishermen of the neighbouring coasts had several times made futile efforts to find out where and how the hermit lived, but the few who got a glimpse of him at a distance brought back such a report that a kind of superstitious fear of him was generated which kept them at a respectful distance.  He was ten feet high, some romancers said, with shoulders four feet broad, a chest like a sugar-hogshead, and a countenance resembling a compound of orang-utan and tiger.  Of course our hero knew nothing of these rumours, and as Moses declined to give any information regarding his master beyond that already given, he was left to the full play of his imagination.  Moses was quite candid about it. He made no pretence to shroud things in mystery.  \"You mus' know, Massa Nadgel,\" he said, as they slowly drew near to the island, \"I's 'fraid ob 'im dough I lub 'im.\"  \"But why do you love him, Moses?\"  \"'Cause he sabe my life an' set me free.\"  \"Indeed? well, that is good reason. And why do you fear him?\"  \"Da's what I don' know, massa,\" replied the negro with a puzzled look.  \"Is he harsh, then?\"  \"No.\"  \"Passionate?\"  \"No. Gentle as a lamb.\"  \"Strong?\"  \"Yes--oh! mighty strong an' big.\"  \"Surely you're not afraid of his giving you a licking, Moses?\"  \"Oh no,\" returned the negro, with a smile of expansive benignity; \"I's not 'fraid ob dat. I's bin a slabe once, got used to lickin's. Don't care nuffin' at all for a lickin'!\"  \"Then it must be that you're afraid of hurting his feelings, Moses, for I know of no other kind of fear.\"  \"Pr'aps da's it!\" said the negro with a bright look, \"now I wouldn't wonder if you's right, Massa Nadgel. It neber come into my head in dat light before. I used to be t'ink, t'inkin' ob nights--when I's tired ob countin' my fingers an' toes--But I couldn't make nuffin' ob it. _Now_ I knows! It's 'fraid I am ob hurtin' his feelin's.\"  In the excess of his satisfaction at the solution of this long-standing puzzle, Moses threw back his head, shut his eyes, opened his enormous mouth and chuckled.  By the time he had reversed this process they were sufficiently near to Krakatoa to distinguish all its features clearly, and the negro began to point out to Nigel its various localities. There were three prominent peaks on it, he said, named respectively, Perboewatan about 400 feet high, at the northern end of the island; Danan, near the centre, 1500 feet; and Rakata, at the southern end, over 2600 feet. It was high up on the sides of the last cone that the residence of the hermit was situated.  \"And you won't tell me your master's name?\" said Nigel.  Moses shook his woolly head. \"No, sar, no. I's 'fraid ob him--he! he! 'fraid ob hurtin' his feelin's!\"  \"Well"]]]
