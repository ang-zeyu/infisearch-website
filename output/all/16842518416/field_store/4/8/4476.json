The general policy of a newspaper with regard to special feature stories is the same as its policy concerning news. Both are determined by the character of its circulation. A paper that is read largely by business and professional men provides news and special articles that satisfy such readers. A paper that aims to reach the so-called masses naturally selects news and features that will appeal to them. If a newspaper has a considerable circulation outside the city where it is published, the editors, in framing their policy, cannot afford to overlook their suburban and rural readers. The character of its readers, in a word, determines the character of a paper's special feature stories.  The newspaper is primarily local in character. A city, a state, or at most a comparatively small section of the whole country, is its particular field. Besides the news of its locality, it must, of course, give significant news of the world at large. So, too, in addition to local feature articles, it should furnish special feature stories of a broader scope. This distinctively local character of newspapers differentiates them from magazines of national circulation in the matter of acceptable subjects for special articles.  The frequency of publication of newspapers, as well as their ephemeral character, leads, in many instances, to the choice of comparatively trivial topics for some articles. Merely to give readers entertaining matter with which to occupy their leisure at the end of a day's work or on Sunday, some papers print special feature stories on topics of little or no importance, often written in a light vein. Articles with no more serious purpose than that of helping readers to while away a few spare moments are obviously better adapted to newspapers, which are read rapidly and immediately cast aside, than to periodicals.  The sensationalism that characterizes the policy of some newspapers affects alike their news columns and their magazine sections. Gossip, scandal, and crime lend themselves to melodramatic treatment as readily in special feature articles as in news stories. On the other hand, the relatively few magazines that undertake to attract readers by sensationalism, usually do so by means of short stories and serials rather than by special articles.  All newspapers, in short, use special feature stories on local topics, some papers print trivial ones, and others \"play up\" sensational material; whereas practically no magazine publishes articles of these types.  SUNDAY MAGAZINE SECTIONS. The character and scope of special articles for the Sunday magazine section of newspapers have been well summarized by two well-known editors of such sections. Mr. John O'Hara Cosgrove, editor of the _New York Sunday World Magazine_, and formerly editor of _Everybody's Magazine_, gives this as his conception of the ideal Sunday magazine section:      The real function of the Sunday Magazine, to my thinking, is to     present the color and romance of the news, the most authoritative     opinions on the issues and events of the day, and to chronicle     promptly the developments of science as applied to daily life. In     the grind of human intercourse all manner of curious, heroic,     delightful things turn up, and for the most part, are dismissed in a     passing note. Behind every such episode are human beings and a     story, and these, if fairly and artfully explained, are the very     stuff of romance. Into every great city men are drifting daily from     the strange and remote places of the world where they have survived     perilous hazards and seen rare spectacles. Such adventures are the     treasure troves of the skilful reporter. The cross currents and     reactions that lead up to any explosion of greed or passion that we     call crime are often worth following, not only for their plots, but     as proofs of the pain and terror of transgression. Brave deeds or     heroic resistances are all too seldom presented in full length in     the news, and generously portrayed prove the nobility inherent in     every-day life.      The broad domain of the Sunday magazine editor covers all that may     be rare and curious or novel in the arts and sciences, in music and     verse, in religion and the occult, on the stage and in sport.     Achievements and controversies are ever culminating in these diverse     fields, and the men and women actors therein make admirable subjects     for his pages. Provided the editor has at his disposal skilled     writers who have the fine arts of vivid and simple exposition and of     the brief personal sketch, there is nothing of human interest that     may not be presented.  The ideal Sunday magazine, as Mr. Frederick Boyd Stevenson, Sunday editor of the _Brooklyn Eagle_, sees it, he describes thus:      The new Sunday magazine of the newspaper bids fair to be a crisp,     sensible review and critique of the live world. It has developed a     special line of writers who have learned that a character sketch and     interview of a man makes you \"see\" the man face to face and talk     with him yourself. If he has done anything that gives him a place in     the news of to-day, he is presented to you. You know the man.      It seems to me that the leading feature of the Sunday magazine     should be the biggest topic that will be before the public on the     Sunday that the newspaper is printed. It should be written by one     who thoroughly knows his subject, who is forceful in style and     fluent in words, who can make a picture that his readers can see,     and seeing, realize. So every other feature of the Sunday magazine     should have points of human interest, either by contact with the     news of the day or with men and women who are doing something     besides getting divorces and creating scandals.      I firmly believe that the coming Sunday magazine will contain     articles of information without being dull or encyclop√¶dic, articles     of adventure that are real and timely, articles of scientific     discoveries that are authentic, interviews with men and women who     have messages, and interpretations of news and analyses of every-day     themes, together with sketches, poems, and essays that are not     tedious, but have a reason for being printed.  THE MAGAZINE FIELD. The great majority of magazines differ from all newspapers in one important respect--extent of circulation. Popular magazines have a nation-wide distribution. It is only among agricultural and trade journals that we find a distinctly sectional circulation. Some of these publications serve subscribers in only one state or section, and others issue separate state or sectional editions. The best basis of differentiation among magazines, then, is not the extent of circulation but the class of readers appealed to, regardless of the part of the country in which the readers live. The popular general magazine, monthly or weekly, aims to attract readers of all classes in all parts of the United States.  HOW MAGAZINES GET MATERIAL. Magazine articles come from (1) regular members of the magazine's staff, (2) professional or amateur free-lance writers, (3) specialists who write as an avocation, and (4) readers of the periodical who send in material based on their own experience.  The so-called \"staff system\" of magazine editing, in accordance with which practically all the articles are prepared by writers regularly employed by the publication, has been adopted by a few general magazines and by a number of class periodicals. The staff is recruited from writers and editors on newspapers and other magazines. Its members often perform various editorial duties in addition to writing articles. Publications edited in this way buy few if any articles from outsiders.  Magazines that do not follow the staff system depend largely or entirely on contributors. Every editor daily receives many manuscripts submitted by writers on their own initiative. From these he selects the material best adapted to his publication. Experienced writers often submit an outline of an article to a magazine editor for his approval before preparing the material for publication. Free-lance writers of reputation may be asked by magazine editors to prepare articles on given subjects.  In addition to material obtained in these ways, articles may be secured from specialists who write as an avocation. An editor generally decides on the subject that he thinks will interest his readers at a given time and then selects the authority best fitted to treat it in a popular way. To induce well-known men to prepare such articles, an editor generally offers them more than he normally pays.  A periodical may encourage its readers to send in short articles giving their own experiences and explaining how to do something in which they have become skilled. These personal experience articles have a reality and \"human interest\" that make them eminently readable. To obtain them magazines sometimes offer prizes for the best, reserving the privilege of publishing acceptable articles that do not win an award. Aspiring writers should take advantage of these prize contests as a possible means of getting both publication and money for their work.  OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNKNOWN WRITERS. The belief is common among novices that because they are unknown their work is likely to receive little or no consideration from editors. As a matter of fact, in the majority of newspaper and magazine offices all unsolicited manuscripts are considered strictly on their merits. The unknown writer has as good a chance as anybody of having his manuscript accepted, provided that his work has merit comparable with that of more experienced writers.  With"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],["title","How To Write Special Feature Articles (#3)"],["body"," exception of certain newspapers that depend entirely on syndicates for their special features, and of a few popular magazines that have the staff system or that desire only the work of well-known writers, every publication welcomes special articles and short stories by novices. Moreover, editors take pride in the fact that from time to time they \"discover\" writers whose work later proves popular. They not infrequently tell how they accepted a short story, an article, or some verse by an author of whom they had never before heard, because they were impressed with the quality of it, and how the verdict of their readers confirmed their own judgment.  The relatively small number of amateurs who undertake special articles, compared with the hundreds of thousands who try their hand at short stories, makes the opportunities for special feature writers all the greater. Then, too, the number of professional writers of special articles is comparatively small. This is particularly true of writers who are able effectively to popularize scientific and technical material, as well as of those who can present in popular form the results of social and economic investigations.  It is not too much to say, therefore, that any writer who is willing (1) to study the interests and the needs of newspaper and magazine readers, (2) to gather carefully the material for his articles, and (3) to present it accurately and attractively, may be sure that his work will receive the fullest consideration in almost every newspaper and magazine office in the country, and will be accepted whenever it is found to merit publication.  WOMEN AS FEATURE WRITERS. Since the essential qualifications just enumerated are not limited to men, women are quite as well fitted to write special feature and magazine articles as are their brothers in the craft. In fact, woman's quicker sympathies and readier emotional response to many phases of life give her a distinct advantage. Her insight into the lives of others, and her intuitive understanding of them, especially fit her to write good \"human interest\" articles. Both the delicacy of touch and the chatty, personal tone that characterize the work of many young women, are well suited to numerous topics.  In some fields, such as cooking, sewing, teaching, the care of children, and household management, woman's greater knowledge and understanding of conditions furnish her with topics that are vital to other women and often not uninteresting to men. The entry of women into occupations hitherto open only to men is bringing new experiences to many women, and is furnishing women writers with additional fields from which to draw subjects and material. Ever since the beginning of popular magazines and of special feature writing for newspapers, women writers have proved their ability, but at no time have the opportunities for them been greater than at present.     CHAPTER II  PREPARATION FOR SPECIAL FEATURE WRITING   QUALIFICATIONS FOR FEATURE WRITING. To attain success as a writer of special feature articles a person must possess at least four qualifications: (1) ability to find subjects that will interest the average man and woman, and to see the picturesque, romantic, and significant phases of these subjects; (2) a sympathetic understanding of the lives and interests of the persons about whom and for whom he writes; (3) thoroughness and accuracy in gathering material; (4) skill to portray and to explain clearly, accurately, and attractively.  The much vaunted sense of news values commonly called a \"nose for news,\" whether innate or acquired, is a prime requisite. Like the newspaper reporter, the writer of special articles must be able to recognize what at a given moment will interest the average reader. Like the reporter, also, he must know how much it will interest him. An alert, responsive attitude of mind toward everything that is going on in the world, and especially in that part of the world immediately around him, will reveal a host of subjects. By reading newspapers, magazines, and books, as well as by intercourse with persons of various classes, a writer keeps in contact with what people are thinking and talking about, in the world at large and in his own community. In this way he finds subjects and also learns how to connect his subjects with events and movements of interest the country over.  Not only should he be quick to recognize a good subject; he must be able to see the attractive and significant aspects of it. He must understand which of its phases touch most closely the life and the interests of the average person for whom he is writing. He must look at things from \"the other fellow's\" point of view. A sympathetic insight into the lives of his readers is necessary for every writer who hopes to quicken his subject with vital interest.  The alert mental attitude that constantly focuses the writer's attention on the men and women around him has been called \"human curiosity,\" which Arnold Bennett says \"counts among the highest social virtues (as indifference counts among the basest defects), because it leads to the disclosure of the causes of character and temperament and thereby to a better understanding of the springs of human conduct.\" The importance of curiosity and of a keen sense of wonder has been emphasized as follows by Mr. John M. Siddall, editor of the _American Magazine_, who directed his advice to college students interested in the opportunities afforded by writing as a profession:      A journalist or writer must have consuming curiosity about other     human beings--the most intense interest in their doings and motives     and thoughts. It comes pretty near being the truth to say that a     great journalist is a super-gossip--not about trivial things but     about important things. Unless a man has a ceaseless desire to learn     what is going on in the heads of others, he won't be much of a     journalist--for how can you write about others unless you know about     others?      In journalism men are needed who have a natural sense of wonder....     You must wonder at man's achievements, at man's stupidity, at his     honesty, crookedness, courage, cowardice--at everything that is     remarkable about him wherever and whenever it appears. If you     haven't this sense of wonder, you will never write a novel or become     a great reporter, because you simply won't see anything to write     about. Men will be doing amazing things under your very eyes--and     you won't even know it.  Ability to investigate a subject thoroughly, and to gather material accurately, is absolutely necessary for any writer who aims to do acceptable work. Careless, inaccurate writers are the bane of the magazine editor's life. Whenever mistakes appear in an article, readers are sure to write to the editor calling his attention to them. Moreover, the discovery of incorrect statements impairs the confidence of readers in the magazine. If there is reason to doubt the correctness of any data in an article, the editor takes pains to check over the facts carefully before publication. He is not inclined to accept work a second time from a writer who has once proved unreliable.  To interpret correctly the essential significance of data is as important as to record them accurately. Readers want to know the meaning of facts and figures, and it is the writer's mission to bring out this meaning. A sympathetic understanding of the persons who figure in his article is essential, not only to portray them accurately, but to give his story the necessary \"human interest.\" To observe accurately, to feel keenly, and to interpret sympathetically and correctly whatever he undertakes to write about, should be a writer's constant aim.  Ability to write well enough to make the average person see as clearly, feel as keenly, and understand as well as he does himself the persons and things that he is portraying and explaining, is obviously the _sine qua non_ of success. Ease, fluency, and originality of diction, either natural or acquired, the writer must possess if his work is to have distinction.  TRAINING FOR FEATURE WRITING. The ideal preparation for a writer of special articles would include a four-year college course, at least a year's work as a newspaper reporter, and practical experience in some other occupation or profession in which the writer intends to specialize in his writing. Although not all persons who desire to do special feature work will be able to prepare themselves in this way, most of them can obtain some part of this preliminary training.  A college course, although not absolutely essential for success, is generally recognized to be of great value as a preparation for writing. College training aims to develop the student's ability to observe accurately, to think logically, and to express his ideas clearly and effectively--all of which is vital to good special feature writing. In addition, such a course gives a student a knowledge of many subjects that he will find useful for his articles. A liberal education furnishes a background that is invaluable for all kinds of literary work. Universities also offer excellent opportunities for specialization. Intensive study in some one field of knowledge, such as agriculture, banking and finance, home economics, public health, social service, government and politics, or one of the physical sciences, makes it possible for a writer to specialize in his articles. In choosing a department in which to do special work in college, a student may be guided by his own tastes and interests, or he may select some field in which there is considerable demand for well trained writers. The man or woman with a specialty has a superior equipment for writing.  With the development of courses in journalism in many colleges and universities has come the opportunity to obtain instruction and practice, not only in the writing of special feature and magazine articles, but also in newspaper reporting,"]]]
