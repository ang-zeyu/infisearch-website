And I do not only propose this kind of _Experimental Philosophy_ as a matter of high _rapture_ and _delight_ of the mind, but even as a _material_ and _sensible Pleasure_. So vast it the _variety of Objects_ which will come under their Inspections, so many _different wayes_ there are _of handling_ them, so great is the _satisfaction_ of _finding_ out _new things_, that I dare compare the _contentment_ which they will injoy, not only to that of _contemplation_, but even to that which most men prefer of _the very Senses themselves_.  And if they will please to take any incouragement from so mean and so imperfect endeavours as mine, upon my own experience, I can assure them, without arrogance, That there has not been any inquiry or Problem in _Mechanicks_, that I have hitherto propounded to my self, but by a certain method (which I may on some other opportunity explain) I have been able presently to examine the possibility of it; and if so, as easily to excogitate divers wayes of performing it: And indeed it is possible to do as much by _this method_ in _Mechanicks_, as by _Algebra_ can be perform’d in _Geometry_. Nor can I at all doubt, but that the same method is as applicable to _Physical Enquiries_, and as likely to find and reap thence as plentiful a crop of Inventions; and indeed there seems to be no subject so barren, but may with this good husbandry be highly improv’d.  Toward the prosecution of this method in _Physical Inquiries_, I have here and there _gleaned_ up an _handful_ of Observations, in the collection of most of which I made use of _Microscopes_, and some other _Glasses_ and _Instruments_ that improve the sense; which way I have herein taken, not that there are not multitudes of useful and pleasant Observables, yet uncollected, obvious enough without the helps of Art, but only to promote the use of Mechanical helps for the Senses, both in the surveying the already visible World, and for the discovery of many others hitherto unknown, and to make us, with the great Conqueror, to be affected that we have not yet overcome one World when there are so many others to be discovered, every considerable improvement of _Telescopes_ or _Microscopes_ producing new Worlds and _Terra-Incognita’s_ to our view.  The Glasses I used were of our English make, but though very good of the kind, yet far short of what might be expected, could we once find a way of making Glasses Elliptical, or of some more true shape; for though both _Microscopes_, and _Telescopes_, as they now are, will magnifie an Object about a thousand thousand times bigger then it appears to the naked eye; yet the Apertures of the Object glasses are so very small, that very few Rays are admitted, and even of those few there are so many false, that the Object appears _dark_ and _indistinct_: And indeed these inconveniences are such, as seem inseparable from Spherical Glasses, even when most exactly made; but the way we have hitherto made use of for that purpose is so imperfect, that there may be perhaps ten wrought before one be made tolerably good, and most of those ten perhaps every one differing in goodness one from another, which is an Argument, that the way hitherto used is, at least, very uncertain. So that these Glasses have a double defect; the one, that very few of them are exactly true wrought; the other, that even of those that are best among them, none will admit a sufficient number of Rayes to magnifie the Object beyond a determinate bigness. Against which Inconveniences the only Remedies I have hitherto met with are these.      First, for _Microscopes_ (where the Object we view is near and within     our power) the best way of making it appear bright in the Glass, is to     cast a great quantity of light on it by means of _convex glasses_, for     thereby, though the aperture be very small, yet there will throng in     through it such multitudes, that an Object will by this means indure to     be magnifi’d as much again as it would be without it. The way for doing     which is this. I make choice of some Room that has only one window open     to the South, and at about three or four foot distance from this     Window, on a Table, I place my _Microscope_, and then so place either a     round Globe of Water, or a very deep clear_ plano convex_ Glass (whose     convex side is turn’d towards the Window) that there is a great     quantity of Rayes collected and thrown upon the Object: Or if the Sun     shine, I place a small piece of oyly Paper very near the Object,     between that and the light; then with a good large Burning-Glass I so     collect and throw the Rayes on the Paper, that there may be a very     great quantity of light pass through it to the Object; yet I so     proportion that light, that it may not singe or burn the Paper. Instead     of which Paper there may be made use of a small piece of Looking-glass     plate, one of whose sides is made rough by being rubb’d on a flat Tool     with very fine sand, this will, if the heat be leisurely cast on it,     indure a much greater degree of heat, and consequently very much     augment a convenient light. By all which means the light of the Sun, or     of a Window, may be so cast on an Object, as to make it twice as light     as it would otherwise be without it, and that without any inconvenience     of glaring, which the immediate light of the Sun is very apt to create     in most Objects; for by this means the light is so equally diffused,     that all parts are alike inlightned; but when the immediate light of     the Sun falls on it, the reflexions from some few parts are so vivid,     that they drown the appearance of all the other, and are themselves     also, by reason of the inequality of light, indistinct, and appear only     radiant spots.      But because the light of the Sun, and also that of a Window, is in a     continual variation, and so many Objects cannot be view’d long enough     by them to be throughly examin’d; besides that, oftentimes the Weather     is so dark and cloudy, that for many dayes together nothing can be     view’d: And because also there are many Objects to be met with in the     night, which cannot so conveniently be kept perhaps till the day,     therefore to procure and cast a sufficient quantity of light on an     Object in the night, I thought of, and often used this, Expedient.      I procur’d me a small Pedestal, such as is describ’d in the fifth     Figure of the first _Scheme_ on the small Pillar AB, of which were two     movable Armes CD, which by means of the Screws EF, I could fix in any     part of the Pillar; on the undermost of these I plac’d a pretty large     Globe of Glass G, fill’d with exceeding clear Brine, stopt, inverted,     and fixt in the manner visible in the Figure; out of the side of which     Arm proceeded another Arm H, with many joynts; to the end of which was     fastned a deep plain _Convex glass_ I, which by means of this Arm could     be moved to and fro, and fixt in any posture. On the upper Arm was     placed a small Lamp K, which could be so mov’d upon the end of the Arm,     as to be set in a fit posture to give light through the Ball: By means     of this Instrument duly plac’d, as is exprest in the Figure, with the     small flame of a Lamp may be cast as great and convenient a light on     the Object as it will well indure; and being always constant, and to be     had at any time, I found most proper for drawing the representations of     those small Objects I had occasion to observe.      None of all which ways (though much beyond any other hitherto made use     of by any I know) do afford a sufficient help, but after a certain     degree of magnifying, they leave us again in the lurch. Hence it were     very desirable, that some way were thought of for making the     Object-glass of such a Figure as would conveniently bear a large     Aperture.  As for _Telescopes_, the only improvement they seem capable of, is the increasing of their length; for the Object being remote, there is no thought of giving it a greater light then it has; and therefore to augment the Aperture, the Glass must be ground of a very large sphere; for, by that means, the longer the Glass be, the bigger aperture will it bear, if the Glasses be of an equal goodness in their kind. Therefore a six will indure a much larger Aperture then a three foot Glass, and a sixty foot Glass will proportionably bear a greater Aperture then a thirty, and will as much excel it also as a six foot does a three foot, as I have experimentally observ’d in one of that length made by Mr. _Richard Reives_ here at _London_, which will bear an Aperture above three inches over, and yet make the Object proportionably big and distinct; whereas there are very few thirty foot Glasses that will indure an Aperture of more then two inches over. So that for _Telescopes_, supposing we had a very ready way of making their Object Glasses of exactly spherical Surfaces, we might, by increasing the length of the Glass, magnifie the Object to any assignable bigness. And for performing both these, I cannot imagine any way more easie, and more exact, then by this following Engine, by means of which, any Glasses, of what length soever, may be speedily made. It seems the most easie, because with one and the same Tool may be with care ground an Object Glass, of any length or breadth requisite, and that with very little or no trouble in fitting the Engine, and without much skill in the Grinder. It seems to be the most exact, for to the very last stroke the Glass does regulate and rectifie the Tool to its exact Figure; and the longer or more the Tool and Glass are wrought together, the more exact will both of them be of the desir’d Figure. Further, the motions of the Glass and Tool do so cross each other, that there is not one point of eithers Surface, but has thousands of cross motions thwarting it, so that there can be no kind of Rings"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15491"],["title","Micrographia (#5)"],["body"," Gutters made either in the Tool or Glass.      The contrivance of the Engine is, only to make the ends of two large     _Mandrils_ so to move, that the Centers of them may be at any     convenient distance asunder, and that the _Axis_ of the _Mandrils_     lying both in the same plain produc’d, may meet each other in any     assignable Angle; both which requisites may be very well perform’d by     the Engine describ’d in the third Figure of the first _Scheme_: where     AB signifies the Beam of a Lath fixt perpendicularly or Horizontally,     CD the two Poppet heads, fixt at about two foot distance, EF an Iron     _Mandril_, whose tapering neck F runs in an adapted tapering brass     Collar; the other end E runs on the point of a Screw G; in a convenient     place of this is fastned H a pully Wheel, and into the end of it, that     comes through the Poppet head C, is screwed a Ring of a hollow     _Cylinder_ K, or some other conveniently shap’d Tool, of what wideness     shall be thought most proper for the cize of Glasses, about which it is     to be imploy’d: As, for Object glasses, between twelve foot and an     hundred foot long, the Ring may be about six inches over, or indeed     somewhat more for those longer Glasses. It would be convenient also, and     not very chargeable, to have four or five several Tools; as one for all     Glasses between an inch and a foot, one for all Glasses between a foot     and ten foot long, another for all between ten and an hundred, a fourth     for all between a hundred and a thousand foot long; and if Curiosity     shall ever proceed so far, one for all lengths between a thousand and     ten thousand foot long; for indeed the principle is such, that     supposing the _Mandrils_ well made, and of a good length, and supposing     great care be used in working and polishing them, I see no reason, but     that a Glass of a thousand, nay of ten thousand foot long, may be as     well made as one of ten; for the reason is the same, supposing the     _Mandrils_ and Tools be made sufficiently strong, so that they cannot     bend; and supposing the Glass, out of which they are wrought, be     capable of so great a regularity in its parts as to refraction: this     hollow _Cylinder_ K is to contain the Sand, and by being drove round     very quick to and fro by means of a small Wheel, which may be mov’d     with ones foot, serves to grind the Glass: The other _Mandril_ is     shap’d like this, but it has an even neck instead of a taper one, and     runs in a Collar, that by the help of a Screw and a joynt made like M     in the Figure, it can be still adjustned to the wearing or wasting     neck: into the end of this _Mandril_ is screwed a Chock N on which with     Cement or Glew is fastned the piece of Glass Q that is to be form’d;     the middle of which Glass is to be plac’d just on the edge of the Ring,     and the Lath OP is to be set and fixt (by means of certain pieces and     screws, the manner whereof will be sufficiently evidenc’d by the Figure)     in such an Angle as is requisite to the forming of such a Sphere as the     Glass is design’d to be of; the geometrical ground of which being     sufficiently plain, though not heeded before, I shall, for brevities     sake, pass over. This last _Mandril_ to be made (by means of the     former, or some other Wheel) to run round very swift also, by which two     cross motions the Glass cannot chuse (if care be us’d) but be wrought     into a most exactly spherical Surface.  But because we are certain, from the _Laws of refraction_ (which I I have experimentally found to be so, by an Instrument I shall presently describe) that _the lines of the angles of Incidence are proportionate to the lines of the angles of Refraction_, therefore if Glasses could be made of those kind of Figures, or some other, such as the most incomparable _Des Cartes_ has invented, and demonstrated in his Philosophical and Mathematical Works, we might hope for a much greater perfection of Opticks then can be rationally expected from spherical ones; for though, _cæteris paribus_, we find, that the larger the _Telescope_ Object Glasses are, and the shorter those of the _Microscope_, the better they magnifie, yet both of them, beside such determinate dimensions, are by certain inconveniences rendred unuseful; for it will be exceeding _difficult_ to make and _manage_ a Tube above an _hundred foot long_, and it will be as difficult to _inlighten_ an Object less then an hundred part of an inch distant from the Object Glass.  I have not as yet made any attempts of that kind, though I know two or three wayes, which, as far as I have yet considered, seem very probable, and may invite me to make a tryal as soon as I have an opportunity, of which I may hereafter perhaps acquaint the world. In the Interim, I shall describe the Instrument I even now mention’d, by which the _refraction_ of all kinds of Liquors may be most exactly measur’d, thereby to give the curious an opportunity of making what further tryals of that kind they shall think requisite to any of their intended tryals; and to let them see that the laws of Refraction are not only notional.      The Instrument consisted of five Rulers, or long pieces placed     together, after the manner exprest in the second Figure of the first     _Scheme_, where AB denotes a straight piece of wood about six foot and     two inches long, about three inches over, and an inch and half thick,     on the back side of which was hung a small plummet by a line stretcht     from top to bottom, by which this piece was set exactly upright, and so     very firmly fixt; in the middle of this was made a hole or center, into     which one end of a hollow cylindrical brass Box CC, fashion’d as I     shall by and by describe, was plac’d, and could very easily and truly     be mov’d to and fro; the other end of this Box being put into, and     moving in, a hole made in a small arm DD; into this box was fastned the     long Ruler EF, about three foot and three or four inches long, and at     three foot from the above mention’d Centers PP was a hole E, cut     through, and cross’d with two small threads, and at the end of it was     fixt a small sight G, and on the back side of it was fixt a small Arm     H, with a Screw to fix it in any place on the Ruler LM; this Ruler LM     was mov’d on the Center B (which was exactly three foot distance from     the middle Center P) and a line drawn through the middle of it LM, was     divided by a Line of cords into some sixty degrees, and each degree was     subdivided into minutes, so that putting the cross of the threads in E     upon any part of this divided line, I presently knew what Angle the two     Rules AB and EF made with each other, and by turning the Screw in H, I     could fix them in any position. The other Ruler also RS was made much     after the same manner, only it was not fixt to the hollow cylindrical     Box, but, by means of two small brass Armes or Ears, it mov’d on the     Centers of it; this also, by means of the cross threads in the hole S,     and by a Screw in K, could be fastned on any division of another line     of cords of the same radius drawn on NO. And so by that means, the     Angle made by the two Rulers, AB and RS, was also known. The Brass box     CC in the middle was shap’d very much like the Figure X, that is, it     was a cylindrical Box stopp’d close at either end, off of which a part     both of the sides and bottomes was cut out, so that the Box, when the     Pipe and that was joyned to it, would contain the Water when fill’d     half full, and would likewise, without running over, indure to be     inclin’d to an Angle, equal to that of the greatest refraction of     Water, and no more, without running over. The Ruler EF was fixt very     fast to the Pipe V, so that the Pipe V directed the length of the Ruler     EF, and the Box and Ruler were mov’d on the Pin TT, so as to make any     desirable Angle with the Ruler AB. The bottom of this Pipe V was stop’d     with a small piece of exactly plain Glass, which was plac’d exactly     perpendicular to the Line of direction, or _Axis_ of the Ruler EF. The     Pins also TT were drill’d with small holes through the _Axis_, and     through those holes was stretcht and fastned a small Wire. There was     likewise a small Pipe of Tin loosly put on upon the end of V, and     reaching down to the sight G; the use of which was only to keep any     false Rayes of light from passing through the bottom of V, and only     admitting such to pass as pierced through the sight G: All things being     placed together in the manner describ’d in the Figure; that is, the     Ruler AB being fixt perpendicular, I fill’d the Box CC with Water, or     any other Liquor, whose refraction I intended to try, till the Wire     passing through the middle of it were just covered: then I moved and     fixt the Ruler FE at any assignable Angle, and placed the flame of a     Candle just against the sight G; and looking through the sight I, I     moved the Ruler RS to and fro, till I perceived the light passing     through G to be covered, as ’twere, or divided by the dark Wire passing     through PP: then turning the Screw in K, I fixt it in that posture: And     through the hole S, I observed what degree and part of it was cut by     the cross threads in S. And this gave me the Angle of Inclination, APS     answering to the Angle of Refraction BPE: for the surface of the Liquor     in the Box will be alwayes horizontal, and consequently AB will be a     perpendicular to it; the Angle therefore APS will measure, or be the     Angle of Inclination in the Liquor; next EPB must be the Angle of     Refraction, for the Ray that passes through the sight G, passes also     perpendicularly through the Glass _Diaphragme_ at F, and consequently     also perpendicularly through the lower surface of the Liquor contiguous     to the Glass, and therefore"]]]
