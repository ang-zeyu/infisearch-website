They told him their plan, and he listened intently.  \"The poor little woman has had such a shock that it will be a long time before she can control herself, I'm afraid,\" he responded sympathetically, \"but I believe you've hit on the right way.\"  \"Then we'll get Edward Watkins to ask her whether she'll be willing to teach a class, and we'll all join it.\"  \"The other women might like to learn, too.\"  \"Perhaps they could teach.  Bulgarian embroidery has been fashionable lately, you know, and the peasant women do it.\"  \"Your grandmother and I went through a Peasant's Bazar when we were in Petrograd and there were mounds of embroidery there that the peasant women had made.\"  \"The Swedes do beautiful work.  Why don't we have a class for international embroidery?\" laughed Dorothy.  \"I think Mother would like to learn the Russian; she's crazy about Russian music and everything Russian.\"  \"We'll ask Mother and Grandmother, too, and perhaps the Miss Clarks would come and the women could charge a fee and make a little money teaching us and be amused themselves.\"  \"I dare say it will do the others good as well as the little Italian. You've hit on something that will benefit all of them while you were trying to help Mrs. Paterno,\" surmised Mr. Emerson.  \"What I came over here this morning to see you about was this,\" he went on in a business-like tone that made them look at him attentively. \"Grandmother and I think that Mrs. Paterno has been a trifle too exciting for you young people the last few days.  We think you need a change of thought as well as that young woman herself.\"  They all sat and waited for what was coming, quite unable to guess what proposition he was going to make.  \"Helen and Roger are somewhat older and stand such upheavals a little better than you girls, so my plan doesn't include them.\"  \"Just us three?\" asked Ethel Brown.  \"Just you three.  Here's my scheme; see if you like it.  I have to go over to Boston to-morrow on a matter of business and it occurred to me that it would be a pleasant sail on the Sound and that you'd be interested in seeing the city--\"  \"O--o!\" gasped Dorothy; \"Cambridge and Longfellow's house.\"  \"Concord and Lexington!\" cried Ethel Brown.  \"The Art Museum!\" murmured Ethel Blue.  \"And Bunker Hill Monument, and, of course, the Navy Yard especially for this daughter of a sailor,\" and he nodded gayly at his granddaughter.  \"Grandmother will go, to take you around when I have to attend to my business, and we can stay a day or two and come back fresh to attend to Mrs. Paterno's affairs.  How does it strike you?\"  Without any preliminary conference, the three girls flung their arms around his neck and hugged him heartily.  \"Have you talked about it with Mother and Aunt Louise?\" asked Ethel Brown.  \"I'm armed with their permission.\"  \"I guess we were all worrying about Mrs. Paterno,\" admitted Ethel Blue. \"This will be the strong grass seed that will clear up our minds so that we can help her better after we come back.\"  \"I think you're the most magnificent Grandfather that ever was born!\" exclaimed Ethel Brown, standing back and gazing admiringly at her ancestor.  \"Thank you,\" returned Mr. Emerson, bowing low, his hand on his heart, \"I am quite overcome by such a wholesale tribute!\"  \"Had we better tell Mrs. Schuler about the embroidery class plan?\" asked Dorothy.  \"Run up to Rose House now and explain it to her and ask her to talk to the women about it while you are gone, and then when you get back she'll have it all ready to start,\" Mr. Emerson suggested.  The next twenty-four hours were full of excitement.  Each of the girls had only a small handbag to pack, but the selection of what should go into each bag seemed a matter of infinite importance.  The Ethels filled their bags twice before they were satisfied that they had not left out anything that would be wanted, and Dorothy confessed that she had first put in too much and then had gone to the other extreme, and that it had not been until after she had had a consultation with her mother that she had decided on just the number and kind of garments that she would need for a two-day trip to the Hub of the Universe.  \"Why is it called that?\" she asked of Ethel Brown.  \"I asked Mother and she said that people from New York and other cities used to say that Bostonians thought that their town was the centre of civilization.  So they guyed it by calling it the 'Hub'.\"  Roger and Helen went into New York with the travellers and Delia and Margaret were on the pier to see the steamer leave.  It was a glorious afternoon and the boat slipped around the end of the Battery while the westering sun was still shining brilliantly on the water, touching it with sparkles on the tip of each tiny wave.  The Statue of Liberty, with the sun behind it, towered darkly against the gold.  The huge buildings of the lower city stretched skywards, the new Equitable, the latest addition to the mammoth group, shutting off almost entirely the view of the Singer Tower from the harbor, just as the Woolworth Tower hides it from observers on the north.  Between them Grandfather and Grandmother Emerson were able to point out nearly all of the sights of the East River--several parks and playgrounds, Bellevue Hospital, the Vanderbilt model tenements for people threatened with tuberculosis, the Junior League Hotel for self-supporting women, the old dwelling where Dorothy's friend, the \"box furniture lady,\" had established a school to teach the folk of the neighborhood how to use tools for the advantage of their house-furnishings.  The boat was one of those which steams around Cape Cod instead of stopping at Fall River, Rhode Island, and sending its passengers to Boston by train.  Early morning found them all on deck watching the waters of Massachusetts Bay and trying to place on a map that Mr. Emerson produced from his pocket the towns whose church spires they could see pointing skyward far off on their left.  Twin lighthouses they decided, marked Gurnet Point, the entrance to Plymouth Bay, and they strained their eyes to see the town that was the oldest settlement in Massachusetts, and imagined they were watching the bulky little Mayflower making her way landward between the headlands.  Mr. Emerson convoyed his party to a hotel on Copley Square and left them there while he went out at once to meet his business friends.  \"How far away Rosemont seems, and poor Mrs. Paterno with her troubles,\" she said an hour later as they stood before Sargent's panel of the Prophets in the Public Library.     CHAPTER X  TROLLEYING  As for the Art Museum, they wandered delightedly from one room to another, but went away with a sensation of having seen too much that was almost as uncomfortable as that of having eaten too much.  \"I should like to come here or to go to the Metropolitan in New York with some one who could tell me about every picture or every object in just one room and stay there for an hour and then go away and think about it,\" said Ethel Blue.  \"We will do that some day at the Metropolitan,\" said Mrs. Emerson.  \"If the Club would like to go in a body some day we can get one of the guides who do just what you describe.  We can tell her the sort of thing we want to see--classical statuary or English artists or the Morgan collection--and have it all shown to us from the standpoint of the expert critic.  Or we can put ourselves in the hands of the guide and say that we'd like to see the ten exhibits that the Museum looks upon as the choicest.\"  \"Either way would be wonderful!\" beamed Ethel Blue, and the three girls promised themselves the delight of reporting Mrs. Emerson's offer to the Club at its next meeting.  The homeward trip was made by a route quite different from the one by which the party reached Boston.  Grandfather proposed it at breakfast on the morning of the day on which they had intended to leave in the afternoon.  \"Are you people very keen on this drive through the Park System to-day?\" he asked.  The girls did not know what to say, but Mrs. Emerson scented a new idea and replied \"not if you have something to suggest that we'd like better.\"  \"How would you like to trolley back to New York?\"  \"Trolley back to New York!\" repeated the girls with little screeches of joy.  \"All the way by trolley?  How long will it take?  I never heard of anything so delightful in all my life!\"  After such a quick and satisfactory response Mr. Emerson did not need to lay his plan before them in any further detail.  \"I see you're 'game,' as Roger would say, for anything, so we'll go that way if Mother agrees.\"  Mrs. Emerson did agree and even went so far as to say that she had wanted to do that very thing for a long time.  \"It's lucky Grandfather insisted that we shouldn't bring anything but small handbags,\" said Ethel Brown.  \"These little things we have won't be any trouble at all, no matter how many times we have to change.\"  They started in heavy inter-urban cars which rode as solidly as railroad cars and enabled them to be but very little tired at the end of the first \"leg\" of the journey.  The wide windows permitted views of the country and the girls ran from one side to the other of the closed cars, so that they should not miss anything of interest, and sat on the front seat of the open cars into which they changed later, so that they might have no one in front of them to obstruct their view.  They went out of the city straight westward through Brookline, through Chestnut Hill, where is one of the reservoirs from which the city is supplied; past Wellesley, where they saw the college buildings rising among the trees on the left.  The party reached Springfield at dusk and had time to take a walk after dinner.  They admired the elm-bordered streets"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15552"],["title","Christmas Outside of Eden (#0)"],["body","Team.

They have told it every Christmas Eve since the world started. They commenced telling it long before Christ was born, for their memory goes further back than men's. The Christmas which they celebrate began just outside of Eden, within sight of its gold-locked doors.  The robins have only two stories: one for Christmas and one for Easter. Their Easter story is quite different. It has to do with how they got the splash of red upon their breasts. It was when God's son was hanging on the cross. They wanted to do something to spare him. They were too weak to pull out the nails from his feet and hands; so they tore their little breasts in plucking the thorns one by one from the crown that had been set upon his forehead. Since then God has allowed their breasts to remain red as a remembrance of His gratitude.  But their Christmas story happened long before, when they weren't robin red-breasts but only robins. It is a merry, tender sort of story. They twitter it in a chuckling fashion to their children. If you prefer to hear it first-hand, creep out to the nearest holly-bush on almost any Christmas Eve when snow has made the night all pale and shadowy. If the robins have chosen your holly-bush as their rendezvous and you understand their language, you won't need to read what I have written. Like all true stories, it is much better told than read. It's the story of the first laugh that was ever heard in earth or heaven. To be enjoyed properly it needs the chuckling twitter of the grown-up robins and the squeaky interruptions of the baby birds asking questions. When they get terrifically excited, they jig up and down on the holly-branches and the frozen snow falls with a brittle clatter. Then the mother and father birds say, \"Hush!\" quite suddenly. No one speaks for a full five seconds. They huddle closer, listening and holding their breath. That's how the story ought to be heard, after night-fall on Christmas Eve, when behind darkened windows little boys and girls have gone to bed early, having hung up their very biggest stockings. Of course I can't tell it that way on paper, but I'll do my best to repeat the precise words in which the robins tell it.     II   It was very long ago at the beginning of all wonders. Sun, moon and stars were new; they wandered about in the clouds uncertainly, calling to one another like ships in a fog. It was the same on earth; neither trees, nor rivers, nor animals were quite sure why they had been created or what was expected of them. They were terribly afraid of doing wrong and they had good reason, for the Man and Woman had done wrong and had been locked out of Eden.  That had happened in April, when the world was three months old. Up to that time everything had gone very well. No one had known what fear was. No one had guessed that anything existed outside the walls of Eden or that there was such a thing as wrong-doing. Animals, trees and rivers had lived together with the Man and the Woman in the high-walled garden as a happy family. If they had wanted to know anything, they had asked the Man; he had always given them answers, even though he had to invent them. They had never dreamt of doubting him--not even the Woman. The reason for this had been God.  Every afternoon God had come stepping down from the sky to walk with the Man through the sun-spangled shadows of the grassy paths. They had heard the kindly rumble of His voice like distant thunder and the little tones of the Man as he asked his questions. At six o'clock regularly God had shaken hands with the Man and climbed leisurely back up the sky-blue stairs that led to Heaven. Because of this the Man had gained a reputation among the animals for being wise. They had thought of him as God's friend. He had given orders to everybody--even to the Woman; and everyone had been proud to obey him.  It had been in April the great change had occurred. There had been all kinds of rumours. The first that had been suspected had been when God had failed to come for His customary walk; the next had been when He had arrived with His face hidden in anger. The trees of Eden had bent and clashed as if a strong wind were blowing. Everything living that was not rooted, had run away to hide. Nevertheless, when God had called to the Man, they had tiptoed nearer to listen. The trouble had seemed to be about some fruit. God had told the Man that he must not pluck it; he had not only plucked it, but had eaten of it. So had the Woman. It had seemed a small matter to make such a fuss about. They had supposed that God's anger would soon blow over and that everything would be again as friendly as before.  [Illustration: God had given the Man and Woman no time to pack. He had marched them beyond the walls and locked the golden gates of Eden against them forever.]  And so everything might have been had it not been for the Man. Instead of saying he was sorry, he had started to argue and blame the Woman. At that God had refused to speak with him longer. He had ordered the Man and Woman and all the animals to leave Eden immediately. He had given them no time to pack. Lining them up like soldiers, He had numbered them to make certain that none were missing and then, with the Man and Woman leading, had marched them beyond the walls and locked the golden gates of Eden against them forever.  Since then all had been privation and confusion. The animals, from regarding the Man as their lord, had grown to despise him. They had blamed him for their misfortunes. They had told him that it was his fault that they had lost their happiness and that God walked the earth no more. The woman had told him so most particularly. Of all the created world only the dog and the robin had remained faithful to him. The dog slept across his feet at night to keep them warm and the robin sang to him each dawn that he should not lose courage.     III   Through the world's first summer things had not been so bad, though of course the wilderness that grew outside of Eden was not so comfortable as the garden they had lost. In the garden no one had needed to work: food had grown on the trees to one's hand and, because it was so sheltered, the weather had been always pleasant. It hadn't been necessary to wear clothing; it hadn't been necessary to build houses, for it had never rained. Birds hadn't troubled to make nests, nor rabbits to dig warrens. Everybody had felt perfectly safe to sleep out-of-doors, wherever he happened to find himself, without a thought of protection.  Here in the wilderness it was different. There were no paths. The jungle grew up tall and threatening. Thorns leant out to tear one's flesh. If it hadn't been for the elephant uprooting trees in his fits of temper, no one would have been able to travel anywhere. One by one the animals slunk away and began to lead their own lives independently, making lairs for themselves. Every day that went by they avoided the Man and Woman more and more. At first they used to peep out of the thicket to jeer at their helplessness; soon they learnt to disregard them as if they were not there. From having believed himself to be the wisest of living creatures the Man discovered himself to be the most incompetent. Often and often he would creep to the gold-locked gates and peer between the bars, hoping to see God walking there as formerly. But God walked no more. As He had climbed back into Heaven, He had destroyed the sky-blue stairs behind Him. There was no way in which the Man could reach Him to ask His advice or pardon.  But it was the Woman who caused the Man most unhappiness. It wasn't that she despised and blamed him. He'd grown used to that since leaving Eden. Everybody, except the dog and the robin, despised and blamed him. The Woman caused him unhappiness because she was unwell--really unwell; not just an upset stomach or a headache. In Eden she had always been strong and beautiful, like sunlight leaping on the smooth, green lawn--so white and pink and darting. Her long gold hair had swayed about her like a flame; her white arms had parted it as though she were a swimmer. Her eyes had been shy and merry from dawn to dusk. She had been a darling; never a cross word had she spoken. The furry creatures of the woods had been her playmates and the birds had perched upon her shoulders to sing their finest songs.  Now she was wan and thin as a withered branch. Like the elephant uprooting trees, she often lost her temper. Sometimes she was sorry for her crossness; more often she wasn't. When the Man offered her things to eat, no matter what trouble he'd taken to get them, she'd say she wasn't hungry. And yet he loved her none the less for her perverseness. He was so afraid.... He couldn't have told you of what he was afraid, for nobody had had time to die in the world as yet. He was filled with dread lest, like God, she might vanish and walk the earth no more. So he cudgelled"]]]
