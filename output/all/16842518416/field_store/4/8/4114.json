You understood why its petals should fall, its leaf wither, its root and branch decay. And even if a storm came and snapped it, still there was nothing lost that was indispensable, nothing that could not be restored.  A child grew in your household, dearly loved and answering your love. You saw that soul unfold, learning to know the evil from the good, learning to accept duty and to resist selfishness, learning to be brave and true and kind, learning to give you day by day a deeper and a richer sympathy, learning to love God and to pray and to be good. And then perhaps you saw that young heart being perfected under the higher and holier discipline of suffering, bearing pain patiently, facing trouble and danger like a hero, not shrinking even from the presence of death, but trusting all to your love and to God's, and taking just what came from day to day, from hour to hour. And then suddenly the light went out in the shining eyes. The brave heart stopped. The soul was gone. Lost, perished, blotted out forever in the darkness of death? Ah, no; you know better than that. That clear, dawning intelligence, that deepening love, that childlike faith in God, that pure innocence of soul, did not come from the dust. How could they return thither? The music ceases because the instrument is broken. But the player is not dead. He is learning a better music. He is finding a more perfect instrument. It is impossible that he should be holden of death. God wastes nothing so precious.               \"What is excellent     As God lives is permanent.     Hearts are dust; hearts' loves remain.     Hearts' love will meet thee again.\"  But I am sure that we must go further than this in order to understand the full strength and comfort of the text. The assertion of the impotence of death to end all is based upon something deeper than the prophecy of immortality in the human heart. It has a stronger foundation than the outreachings of human knowledge and moral effort towards a higher state in which completion may be attained. It has a more secure ground to rest upon than the deathless affection with which our love clings to its object The impotence of death is revealed to us in the spiritual perfection of Christ.  Here then, in the \"power of an endless life,\" I find the corner-stone of peace on earth among men of good-will Take this mortal life as a thing of seventy years, more or less, to which death puts a final period, and you have nothing but confusion, chance and futility,--nothing safe, nothing realized, nothing completed. Evil often triumphs. Virtue often is defeated.                         \"The good die young,     And we whose hearts are dry as summer dust     Burn to the socket.\"  But take death, as Christ teaches us, not as a full stop, but as only a comma in the story of an endless life, and then the whole aspect of our existence is changed. That which is material, base, evil, drops down. That which is spiritual, noble, good, rises to lead us on.  The conviction of immortality, the forward-looking faith in a life beyond the grave, the spirit of Easter, is essential to peace on earth for three reasons.  I. It is the only faith that lifts man's soul, which is immortal, above his body, which is perishable. It raises him out of the tyranny of the flesh to the service of his ideals. It makes him sure that there are things worth fighting and dying for. The fighting and the dying, for the cause of justice and liberty, are sacrifices on the Divine altar which shall never be forgotten.  II. The faith in immortality carries with it the assurance of a Divine reassessment of earth's inequalities. Those who have suffered unjustly here will be recompensed in the future. Those who have acted wickedly and unjustly here will be punished. Whether that punishment will be final or remedial we do not know. Perhaps it may lead to the extinction of the soul of evil, perhaps to its purifying and deliverance. On these questions I fall back on the word of God: \"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"  III. The faith in immortality brings with it the sense of order, tranquillity, steadiness and courage in the present life. It sets us free from mean and cowardly temptations, makes it easier to resist the wild animal passions of lust and greed and cruelty, brings us into eternal relations and fellowships, makes us partners with the wise and good of all the ages, ennobles our earthly patriotism by giving us a heavenly citizenship. Yea, it knits us in bonds of love with the coming generation. It is better than the fountain of youth. We shall know and see them as they go on their way, long after we have left the path. The faith in immortality sets a touch of the imperishable on every generous impulse and unselfish deed. It inspires to sublime and heroic virtues,--spiritual splendours,--deeds of sacrifice and suffering for which earth has no adequate recompense, but whose reward is great in heaven. Here is the patience of the saints, the glorious courage of patriots, martyrs, and confessors, something more bright and shining than secular morality can bring forth,--a flashing of the inward light which fails not, but grows clearer as death draws near. What noble evidences of this come to us out of the great war.  \"Are you in great distress?\" asked a nurse of an American soldier whose legs had been shot away on the battle-field. \"I am in as great peace,\" said he, \"through Jesus my Lord, as a man can possibly be, out of Paradise.\"  A secretary of the Y.M.C.A., the night before he was killed, wrote to his father: \"I have not been sent here to die: I am to fight: I offer my life for future generations; I shall not die, I shall merely change my direction. He who walks before us is so great that we cannot lose Him from sight.\"  A simple French boy, grievously wounded, is dying in the ambulance. He is a Protestant The nurse who bends over him is a Catholic sister. She writes down his words as they fall slowly from his lips: \"O my God, let Thy will be done and not mine. O my God, Thou knowest that I never wished war, but that I have fought because it was Thy will; I offered my life so that peace might prevail. O my God, I pray for all my dear ones, ... father, mother, brothers, sisters. Give a hundredfold to those nurses for all they have done for me. I pray for them one and all.\"  Here, in the midst of carnage and confusion, horror and death, was perfect peace, the triumph of immortality.  What then shall we say of the new teachers and masters, the cynical lords of materialism and misrule, who tell us that they are going to banish this outworn superstition and all others like it from the mind of man? They are going to make a new world in which men shall walk by sight, and not by faith; a world in which universal happiness shall be produced by the forcible division of material goods, and brotherhood promoted by the simple expedient of killing those whom they dislike; a world in which there shall be neither nation, God, nor Church, nor anywhere a thought of any life but this which ends in the grave. It is a mad dream of wild and reckless men. But it threatens evil to all the world. Do you remember what happened when the French Revolution took that course, abolished the Sabbath, defiled the Churches, broke down the altars, and enthroned a harlot as the Goddess of Reason? The Reign of Terror followed. Something like that has happened, recently, in many parts of Europe. And if these new tyrants of ignorance, unbelief, and unmorality have their way, the madness and the darkness will spread until the black cloud charged with death covers the face of the earth for a season with shame and anguish and destruction. A sane world, an orderly world, a peaceful world, can never be founded on materialism. That foundation is a quicksand in which all that is dearest to man goes down in death.  Religion is essential to true peace in the soul and to peace on earth through righteousness. Immortality is essential to true religion. Thanks be to God who hath given us Jesus Christ, who was dead and is alive again and liveth forevermore, to touch and ennoble, to inspire and console, to pacify and uplift our earthly existence with the power of an endless life."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15281"],["title","Uncle Wiggily's Adventures (#0)"],["body","WIGGILY'S ADVENTURES  By HOWARD R.

FENNO & COMPANY _Uncle Wiggily's Adventures_     =UNCLE WIGGILY'S ADVENTURES=     STORY I  UNCLE WIGGILY STARTS OFF   Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice old gentleman rabbit, hopped out of bed one morning and started to go to the window, to see if the sun was shining. But, no sooner had he stepped on the floor, than he cried out:  \"Oh! Ouch! Oh, dear me and a potato pancake! Oh, I believe I stepped on a tack! Sammie Littletail must have left it there! How careless of him!\"  You see this was the same Uncle Wiggily, of whom I have told you in the Bedtime Books--the very same Uncle Wiggily. He was an Uncle to Sammie and Susie Littletail, the rabbit children, and also to Billie and Johnnie Bushytail, the squirrel boys, and to Alice and Lulu and Jimmie Wibblewobble, the duck children, and I have written for you, books about all those characters. Now I thought I would write something just about Uncle Wiggily himself, though of course I'll tell you what all his nephews and nieces did, too.  Well, when Uncle Wiggily felt that sharp pain, he stood still for a moment, and wondered what could have happened.  \"Yes, I'm almost sure it was a tack,\" he said. \"I must pick it up so no one else will step on it.\"  So Uncle Wiggily looked on the floor, but there was no tack there, only some crumbs from a sugar cookie that Susie Littletail had been eating the night before, when her uncle had told her a go-to-sleep story.  \"Oh, I know what it was; it must have been my rheumatism that gave me the pain!\" said the old gentleman rabbit as he looked for his red, white and blue crutch, striped like a barber pole. He found it under the bed, and then he managed to limp to the window. Surely enough, the sun was shining.  \"I'll certainly have to do something about this rheumatism,\" said Uncle Wiggily as he carefully shaved himself by looking in the glass. \"I guess I'll see Dr. Possum.\"  So after breakfast, when Sammie and Susie had gone to school, Dr. Possum was telephoned for, and he called to see Uncle Wiggily.  \"Ha! Hum!\" exclaimed the doctor, looking very wise. \"You have the rheumatism very bad, Mr. Longears.\"  \"Why, I knew that before you came,\" said the old gentleman rabbit, blinking his eyes. \"What I want is something to cure it.\"  \"Ha! Hum!\" said Dr. Possum, again looking very wise. \"I think you need a change of air. You must travel about. Go on a journey, get out and see strange birds, and pick the pretty flowers. You don't get exercise enough.\"  \"Exercise enough!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"Why, my goodness me sakes alive and a bunch of lilacs! Don't I play checkers almost every night with Grandfather Goosey Gander?\"  \"That is not enough,\" said the doctor, \"you must travel here and there, and see things.\"  \"Very well,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"then I will travel. I'll pack my valise at once, and I'll go off and seek my fortune, and maybe, on the way, I can lose this rheumatism.\"  So the next day Uncle Wiggily started out with his crutch, and his valise packed full of clean clothes, and something in it to eat.  \"Oh, we are very sorry to have you go, dear uncle,\" said Susie Littletail, \"but we hope you'll come back good and strong.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Uncle Wiggily, as he kissed the two rabbit children and their mamma, and shook hands with Papa Littletail. Then off the old gentleman bunny hopped with his crutch.  Well, he went along for quite a distance, over the hills, and down the road, and through the woods, and, as the sun got higher and warmer, his rheumatism felt better.  \"I do believe Dr. Possum was right!\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"Traveling is just the thing for me,\" and he felt so very jolly that he whistled a little tune about a peanut wagon, which roasted lemonade, and boiled and frizzled Easter eggs that Mrs. Cluk-Cluk laid.  \"Ha! Where are you going?\" suddenly asked a voice, as Uncle Wiggily finished the tune.  \"I'm going to seek my fortune,\" replied Uncle Wiggily. \"Who are you, pray?\"  \"Oh, I'm a friend of yours,\" said the voice, and Uncle Wiggily looked all around, but he couldn't discover any one.  \"But where are you?\" the puzzled old gentleman rabbit wanted to know. \"I can't see you.\"  \"No, and for a very good reason,\" answered the voice. \"You see I have very weak eyes, and if I came out in the sun, without my smoked glasses on, I might get blind. So I have to hide down in this hollow stump.\"  \"Then put on your glasses and come out where I can see you,\" invited the old gentleman rabbit, and all the while he was trying to remember where he had heard that voice before. At first he thought it might be Grandfather Goosey Gander, or Uncle Butter, the goat, yet it didn't sound like either of them.  \"I have sent my glasses to the store to be fixed, so I can't wear them and come out,\" went on the voice. \"But if you are seeking your fortune I know the very place where you can find it.\"  \"Where?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, eagerly.  \"Right down in this hollow stump,\" was the reply. \"There are all kinds of fortunes here, and you may take any kind you like Mr. Longears.\"  \"Ha! That is very nice,\" thought the rabbit. \"I have not had to travel far before finding my fortune. I wonder if there is a cure for rheumatism in that stump, too?\" So he asked about it.  \"Of course, your rheumatism can be cured in here,\" came the quick answer. \"In fact, I guarantee to cure any disease--measles, chicken-pox, mumps and even toothache. So if you have any friends you want cured send them to me.\"  \"I wish I could find out who you were,\" spoke the rabbit. \"I seem to know your voice, but I can't think of your name.\"  \"Oh, you'll know me as soon as you see me,\" said the voice. \"Just hop down inside this hollow stump, and your fortune is as good as made, and your rheumatism will soon be gone. Hop right down.\"  Well, Uncle Wiggily didn't like the looks of the black hole down inside the stump, and he peered into it to see what he could see, but it was so black that all he could make out was something like a lump of coal.  \"Well, Dr. Possum said I needed to have a change of scene, and some adventures,\" said the rabbit, \"so I guess I'll chance it. I'll go down, and perhaps I may find my fortune.\"  Then, carefully holding his crutch and his satchel, Uncle Wiggily hopped down inside the stump. He felt something soft, and furry, and fuzzy, pressing close to him, and at first he thought he had bumped into Dottie or Willie Lambkin.  But then, all of a sudden, a harsh voice cried out:  \"Ha! Now I have you! I was just wishing some one would come along with my dinner, and you did! Get in there, and see if you can find your fortune, Uncle Wiggily!\" And with that what should happen but that big, black bear, who had been hiding in the stump, pushed Uncle Wiggily into a dark closet, and locked the door! And there the poor rabbit was, and the bear was getting ready to eat him up.  But don't worry, I'll find a way to get him out, and in case we have ice cream pancakes for supper I'll tell you, in the next story, how Uncle Wiggily got out of the bear's den, and how he went fishing--I mean Uncle Wiggily went fishing, not the bear.     STORY II  UNCLE WIGGILY GOES FISHING   At first, after he found himself shut up in the bear's dark closet, where we left him in the story before this, poor Uncle Wiggily didn't know what to think. He just sat there, on the edge of a chair, and he tried to look around, and see something, but it was too black, so he couldn't.  \"Perhaps this is only a joke,\" thought the old gentleman rabbit, \"though I never knew a black bear to joke before. But perhaps it is. I'll ask him.\"  So Uncle Wiggily called out:  \"Is this a joke, Mr. Bear?\"  \"Not a bit of it!\" was the growling answer. \"You'll soon see what's going to happen to you! I'm getting the fire ready now.\"  \"Getting the fire ready for what; the adventure, or for my fortune?\" asked the rabbit, for he still hoped the bear was only joking with him.  \"Ready to cook you!\" was the reply. \"That's what the fire is for!\" and the bear gnashed his teeth together something terrible, and, with his sharp claws, he clawed big splinters off the stump, and with them he started the fire in the stove, with the splinters, I mean, not his claws.  The blazing fire made it a little brighter in the hollow stump, which was the black bear's den, and Uncle Wiggily could look out of a crack in the door, and see what a savage fellow the shaggy bear was. You see, that bear just hid in the stump, waiting for helpless animals to come along, and then he'd"]]]
