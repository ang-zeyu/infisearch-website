I am known as Quintus Drusus of Præneste.\"  Before he had gotten further, his assailant was pounding and shaking a frightened-looking slave-lad who had stood at his elbow.  \"The gods blast you, you worthless _nomenclator_![53] You have forgotten the worthy gentleman's name, and have made me play the fool! You may have lost me votes! All Rome will hear of this! I shall be a common laughing-stock! _Hei! vah!_ But I'll teach you to behave!\" And he shook the wretched boy until the latter's teeth rattled.    [53] Great men, and candidates for office who wished to \"know\"   everybody, kept smart slaves at their elbow to whisper strangers'   names in their ears. Sometimes the slaves themselves were at fault.  At this instant a young man of faultless toilet, whom we have already recognized as Lucius Ahenobarbus, pushed into the little knot as a peacemaker.  \"Most excellent Calatinus,\" said he, half suppressing his laughter at the candidate's fury, the nomenclator's anguish, and Drusus's vexed confusion, \"allow me to introduce to you a son of Sextus Drusus, who was an old friend of my father's. This is Quintus Drusus, if in a few years I have not forgotten his face; and this, my dear Quintus, is my good friend Lucius Calatinus, who would be glad of your vote and influence to help on his candidacy as tribune.\"  The atmosphere was cleared instantly. Calatinus forgot his anger, in order to apologize in the most obsequious manner for his headlong salutation. Drusus, pleased to find the man he had been seeking, forgave the vile scent of the garlic, and graciously accepted the explanation. Then the way was open to ask Calatinus whether he was willing to dispose of Agias. The crestfallen candidate was only too happy to do something to put himself right with the person he had offended. Loudly he cursed his wife's temper, that would have wasted a slave worth a \"hundred thousand sesterces\" to gratify a mere burst of passion.  \"Yes, he was willing to sell the boy to accommodate his excellency, Quintus Drusus,\" said Calatinus, \"although he was a valuable slave. Still, in honesty he had to admit that Agias had some mischievous points. Calatinus had boxed his ears only the day before for licking the pastry. But, since his wife disliked the fellow, he would be constrained to sell him, if a purchaser would take him.\"  The result of the conference was that Drusus, who had inherited that keen eye for business which went with most of his race, purchased Agias for thirty thousand sesterces, considerably less than the boy would have brought in the market.  While Drusus was handing over a money order payable with Flaccus, Lucius Ahenobarbus again came forward, with all seeming friendliness.  \"My dear Quintus,\" said he, \"Marcus Læca has commissioned me to find a ninth guest to fill his _triclinium_[54] this evening. We should be delighted if you would join us. I don't know what the good Marcus will offer us to-night, but you can be sure of a slice of peacock[55] and a few other nice bits.\"    [54] Dining room with couch seats for nine, the regular size.    [55] The _ne plus ultra_ of Roman gastronomy at the time.  \"I am very grateful,\" replied Drusus, who felt all the while that Lucius Ahenobarbus was the last man in the world with whom he cared to spend an evening's carousing; \"but,\" and here he concocted a white lie, \"an old friend I met in Athens has already invited me to spend the night, and I cannot well refuse him. I thank you for your invitation.\"  Lucius muttered some polite and conventional terms of regret, and fell back to join Servius Flaccus and Gabinius, who were near him.  \"I invited him and he refused,\" he said half scornfully, half bitterly. \"That little minx, Cornelia, has been complaining of me to him, I am sure. The gods ruin him! If he wishes to become my enemy, he'll have good cause to fear my bite.\"  \"You say he's from Præneste,\" said Gabinius, \"and yet can he speak decent Latin? Doesn't he say '_conia_' for '_ciconia_,' and '_tammodo_' for '_tantummodo_'_?_ I wonder you invite such a boor.\"  \"Oh! he can speak good enough Latin,\" said Lucius. \"But I invited him because he is rich; and it might be worth our while to make him gamble.\"  \"Rich!\" lisped Servius Flaccus. \"Rich (h)as my (h)uncle the broker? That silly straightlac(h)ed fellow, who's (h)a C(h)ato, (h)or worse? For shame!\"  \"Well,\" said Lucius, \"old Crassus used to say that no one who couldn't pay out of his own purse for an army was rich. But though Drusus cannot do quite that, he has enough sesterces to make happy men of most of us, if his fortune were mine or yours.\"  \"(H)its (h)an (h)outrage for him to have (h)it,\" cried Servius Flaccus.  \"It's worse than an outrage,\" replied Ahenobarbus; \"it's a sheer blunder of the Fates. Remind me to tell you about Drusus and his fortune, before I have drunk too much to-night.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Agias went away rejoicing with his new master. Drusus owned an apartment house on the Vicus Longus, and there had a furnished suite of rooms. He gave Agias into the charge of the porter[56] and ordered him to dress the boy's wounds. Cappadox waited on his master when he lunched.    [56] Porter--_Insularius._  \"Master Quintus,\" said he, with the familiar air of a privileged servant, \"did you see that knavish-looking Gabinius following Madame Fabia all the way back to the Temple of Vesta?\"  \"No,\" said Drusus; \"what do you mean, you silly fellow?\"  \"Oh, nothing,\" said Cappadox, humbly. \"I only thought it a little queer.\"  \"Perhaps so,\" said his master, carelessly.     Chapter IV  Lucius Ahenobarbus Airs His Grievance   I  The pomp and gluttony of Roman banquets have been too often described to need repetition here; neither would we be edified by learning all the orgies that Marcus Læca (an old Catilinian conspirator) and his eight guests indulged in that night: only after the dinner had been cleared, and before the Gadesian[57] dancing girls were called in, the dice began to rattle, and speedily all were engrossed in drink and play.    [57] From Cadiz, Spain.  Lucius Ahenobarbus soon lost so heavily that he was cursing every god that presided over the noble game.  \"I am ruined next Ides,\" he groaned. \"Phormio the broker has only continued my loan at four per cent a month. All my villas and furniture are mortgaged, and will be sold at auction. _Mehercle_, destruction stares me in the face!\"  \"Well, well, my dear fellow,\" said Pratinas, who, having won the stakes, was in a mood to be sympathetic, \"we must really see what can be done to remedy matters.\"  \"I can see nothing!\" was his answer.  \"Won't your father come to the rescue?\" put in Gabinius, between deep pulls on a beaker.  \"My father!\" snapped Ahenobarbus. \"Never a sesterce will I get out of him! He's as good as turned me adrift, and Cato my uncle is always giving him bad reports of me, like the hypocritical Stoic that Cato is.\"  \"By the bye,\" began Gabinius again, putting down the wine-cup, \"you hinted to-day that you had been cheated out of a fortune, after a manner. Something about that Drusus of Præneste, if I recollect. What's the story?\"  Lucius settled down on his elbow, readjusted the cushions on the banqueting couch, and then began, interrupted by many a hiccough because of his potations.  \"It is quite a story, but I won't bore you with details. It has quite as much to do with Cornelia, Lentulus Crus's pretty niece, as with Drusus himself. Here it is in short. Sextus Drusus and Caius Lentulus were such good friends that, as you know, they betrothed their son and daughter when the latter were mere children. To make the compact doubly strong, Sextus Drusus inserted in his will a clause like this: 'Let my son Quintus enjoy the use of my estate and its income, until he become twenty-five and cease to be under the care of Flaccus his _tutor_.[58] If he die before that time, let his property go to Cornelia, the daughter of Caius Lentulus, except;' and here Sextus left a small legacy for his own young daughter, Livia. You see Drusus can make no will until he is five-and-twenty. But then comes another provision. 'If Cornelia shall marry any person save my son, my son shall at once be free to dispose of my estates.' So Cornelia is laid under a sort of obligation also to marry Quintus. The whole aim of the will is to make it very hard for the young people to fail to wed as their fathers wished.\"    [58] Commercial adviser required for young men under five-and-twenty.  \"True,\" said Gabinius; \"but how such an arrangement can affect you and your affairs, I really cannot understand.\"  \"That is so,\" continued Ahenobarbus, \"but here is the other side of the matter. Caius Lentulus was a firm friend of Sextus Drusus; he also was very close and dear to my father. Caius desired that Cornelia wed young Drusus, and so enjoined her in his will; but out of compliment to my father, put in a clause which was something like this: 'If Quintus Drusus die before he marry Cornelia, or refuse to marry Cornelia at the proper time, then let Cornelia and all her property be given to Lucius, the second son of my dearly loved friend, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus,' Now I think you will begin to see why Quintus Drusus's affairs interest me a little. If he refuse to marry Cornelia before he be five-and-twenty, she falls to me. But I understand that Lentulus, her uncle, is badly in debt, and her dowry won't be much. But if Drusus is not married to her, and die before he is twenty-five, _his property is hers and she is mine._ Do you understand why I have a little grudge against him?\"  \"For what?\" cried Læca, with breathless interest.  \"For living!\" sighed Ahenobarbus, hopelessly.  The handsome face of Pratinas was a study. His nostrils dilated; his lips quivered; his eyes were bright and keen with what evidently passed in his mind for a great discovery.  \"Eureka!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15697"],["title","True Stories of History and Biography (#0)"],["body","Stories from History and Biography by Nathaniel Hawthorne BOSTON: TICKNOR, REED, AND FIELDS.

For this purpose, while ostensibly relating the adventures of a Chair, he has endeavored to keep a distinct and unbroken thread of authentic history. The Chair is made to pass from one to another of those personages, of whom he thought it most desirable for the young reader to have vivid and familiar ideas, and whose lives and actions would best enable him to give picturesque sketches of the times. On its sturdy oaken legs, it trudges diligently from one scene to another, and seems always to thrust itself in the way, with most benign complacency, whenever a historical personage happens to be looking round for a seat.  There is certainly no method, by which the shadowy outlines of departed men and women can he made to assume the hues of life more effectually, than by connecting their images with the substantial and homely reality of a fireside chair. It causes us to feel at once, that these characters of history had a private and familiar existence, and were not wholly contained within that cold array of outward action, which we are compelled to receive as the adequate representation of their lives. If this impression can be given, much is accomplished.  Setting aside Grandfather and his auditors, and excepting the adventures of the Chair, which form the machinery of the work, nothing in the ensuing pages can be termed fictitious. The author, it is true, has sometimes assumed the license of filling up the outline of history with details, for which he has none but imaginative authority, but which, he hopes, do not violate nor give a false coloring to the truth. He believes that, in this respect, his narrative will not be found to convey ideas and impressions, of which the reader may hereafter find it necessary to purge his mind.  The author’s great doubt is, whether he has succeeded in writing a book which will be readable by the class for whom he intends it. To make a lively and entertaining narrative for children, with such unmalleable material as is presented by the sombre, stern, and rigid characteristics of the Puritans and their descendants, is quite as difficult an attempt, as to manufacture delicate playthings out of the granite rocks on which New England is founded.                        THE WHOLE HISTORY OF GRANDFATHER’S CHAIR                            COMPLETE IN THREE PARTS.      PART I     Chapter I   Grandfather had been sitting in his old arm-chair, all that pleasant afternoon, while the children were pursuing their various sports, far off or near at hand. Sometimes you would have said, \"Grandfather is asleep;\" but still, even when his eyes were closed, his thoughts were with the young people, playing among the flowers and shrubbery of the garden.  He heard the voice of Laurence, who had taken possession of a heap of decayed branches which the gardener had lopped from the fruit trees, and was building a little hut for his cousin Clara and himself. He heard Clara’s gladsome voice, too, as she weeded and watered the flower-bed which had been given her for her own. He could have counted every footstep that Charley took, as he trundled his wheelbarrow along the gravel walk. And though Grandfather was old and gray-haired, yet his heart leaped with joy whenever little Alice came fluttering, like a butterfly, into the room. She had made each of the children her playmate in turn, and now made Grandfather her playmate too, and thought him the merriest of them all.  At last the children grew weary of their sports; because a summer afternoon is like a long lifetime to the young. So they came into the room together, and clustered round Grandfather’s great chair. Little Alice, who was hardly five years old, took the privilege of the youngest, and climbed his knee. It was a pleasant thing to behold that fair and golden-haired child in the lap of the old man, and to think that, different as they were, the hearts of both could be gladdened with the same joys.  \"Grandfather,\" said little Alice, laying her head back upon his arm, \"I am very tired now. You must tell me a story to make me go to sleep.\"  \"That is not what story-tellers like,\" answered Grandfather, smiling. \"They are better satisfied when they can keep their auditors awake.\"  \"But here are Laurence, and Charley, and I,\" cried cousin Clara, who was twice as old as little Alice. \"We will all three keep wide awake. And pray, Grandfather, tell us a story about this strange-looking old chair.\"  Now, the chair in which Grandfather sat was made of oak, which had grown dark with age, but had been rubbed and polished till it shone as bright as mahogany. It was very large and heavy, and had a back that rose high above Grandfather’s white head. This back was curiously carved in open work, so as to represent flowers and foliage and other devices; which the children had often gazed at, but could never understand what they meant. On the very tiptop of the chair, over the head of Grandfather himself, was a likeness of a lion’s head, which had such a savage grin that you would almost expect to hear it growl and snarl.  The children had seen Grandfather sitting in this chair ever since they could remember any thing. Perhaps the younger of them supposed that he and the chair had come into the world together, and that both had always been as old as they were now. At this time, however, it happened to be the fashion for ladies to adorn their drawing-rooms with the oldest and oddest chairs that could be found. It seemed to cousin Clara that if these ladies could have seen Grandfather’s old chair, they would have thought it worth all the rest together. She wondered if it were not even older than Grandfather himself, and longed to know all about its history.  \"Do, Grandfather, talk to us about this chair,\" she repeated.  \"Well, child,\" said Grandfather, patting Clara’s cheek, \"I can tell you a great many stories of my chair. Perhaps your cousin Laurence would like to hear them too. They would teach him something about the history and distinguished people of his country, which he has never read in any of his school-books.\"  Cousin Laurence was a boy of twelve, a bright scholar, in whom an early thoughtfulness and sensibility began to show themselves. His young fancy kindled at the idea of knowing all the adventures of this venerable chair. He looked eagerly in Grandfather’s face; and even Charley, a bold, brisk, restless little fellow of nine, sat himself down on the carpet, and resolved to be quiet for at least ten minutes, should the story last so long.  Meantime, little Alice was already asleep; so Grandfather, being much pleased with such an attentive audience, began to talk about matters that had happened long ago.     Chapter II   But, before relating the adventures of the chair, Grandfather found it necessary to speak of the circumstances that caused the first settlement of New England. For it will soon be perceived that the story of this remarkable chair cannot be told without telling a great deal of the history of the country.  So, Grandfather talked about the Puritans, as those persons were called who thought it sinful to practise the religious forms and ceremonies which the Church of England had borrowed from the Roman Catholics. These Puritans suffered so much persecution in England that, in 1607, many of them went over to Holland, and lived ten or twelve years at Amsterdam and Leyden. But they feared that, if they continued there much longer, they should cease to be English, and should adopt all the manners and ideas and feelings of the Dutch. For this and other reasons, in the year 1620, they embarked on board of the ship Mayflower, and crossed the ocean to the shores of Cape Cod. There they made a settlement, and called it Plymouth; which, though now a part of Massachusetts, was for a long time a colony by itself. And thus was formed the earliest settlement of the Puritans in America.  Meantime, those of the Puritans who remained in England continued to suffer grievous persecution on account of their religious opinions. They began to look around them for some spot where they might worship God, not as the king and bishops thought fit, but according to the dictates of their own consciences. When"]]]
