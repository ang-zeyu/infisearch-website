He was going to a fine cabbage field. On the way he saw the whale and the elephant talking together.  Brother Rabbit said, \"I'd like to know what they are talking about.\" So he crouched down behind some bushes and listened.  This is what Brother Rabbit heard the whale say:  \"You are the biggest thing on the land, Brother Elephant, and I am the biggest thing in the sea. If we work together, we can rule all the animals in the world. We can have our own way about everything.\"  \"Very good, very good,\" trumpeted the elephant. \"That suits me. You keep the sea, and I will keep the land.\"  [Illustration: Brother Rabbit listening]  \"That's a bargain,\" said the whale, as he swam away.  Brother Rabbit laughed to himself. \"They won't rule me,\" he said, as he ran off.  Brother Rabbit soon came back with a very long and a very strong rope and his big drum. He hid the drum in some bushes. Then taking one end of the rope, he walked up to the elephant.  \"Oh, dear Mr. Elephant,\" he said, \"you are big and strong; will you have the kindness to do me a favor?\"  The elephant was pleased, and he trumpeted, \"Certainly, certainly. What is it?\"  \"My cow is stuck in the mud on the shore, and I can't pull her out,\" said Brother Rabbit. \"If you will help me, you will do me a great service. You are so strong, I am sure you can get her out.\"  \"Certainly, certainly,\" trumpeted the elephant.  \"Thank you,\" said the rabbit. \"Take this rope in your trunk, and I will tie the other end to my cow. Then I will beat my drum to let you know when to pull. You must pull as hard as you can, for the cow is very heavy.\"  \"Huh!\" trumpeted the elephant, \"I'll pull her out, or break the rope.\"  Brother Rabbit tied the rope to the elephant's trunk and ran off, lippety, lippety.   II   He ran till he came to the shore where the whale was. Making a bow, Brother Rabbit said, \"0, mighty and wonderful Whale, will you do me a favor?\"  \"What is it?\" asked the whale.  \"My cow is stuck in the mud on the shore,\" said Brother Rabbit, \"and I cannot pull her out. Of course you can do it. If you will be so kind as to help me, I shall be very much obliged.\"  \"Certainly,\" said the whale, \"certainly.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Brother Rabbit, \"take hold of this rope, and I will tie the other end to my cow. Then I will beat my big drum to let you know when to pull. You must pull as hard as you can, for my cow is very heavy.\"  \"Never fear,\" said the whale, \"I could pull a dozen cows out of the mud.\"  \"I am sure you could,\" said the rabbit politely. \"Only be sure to begin gently. Then pull harder and harder till you get her out.\"  The rabbit ran away into the bushes where he had hidden the drum and began to beat it. Then the whale began to pull and the elephant began to pull. In a minute the rope tightened till it was stretched as hard as a bar of iron.  \"This is a very heavy cow,\" said the elephant, \"but I'll pull her out.\" Bracing his fore feet in the earth, he gave a tremendous pull.  But the whale had no way to brace himself.  \"Dear me,\" he said. \"That cow must surely be stuck tight.\" Lashing his tail in the water, he gave a marvelous pull.  He pulled harder; the elephant pulled harder. Soon the whale found himself sliding toward the land. He was so provoked with the cow that he went head first, down to the bottom of the sea.  That was a pull! The elephant was jerked off his feet, and came slipping and sliding toward the sea. He was very angry.  \"That cow must be very strong to drag me in this way,\" he said. \"I will brace myself.\"  Kneeling down on the ground, he twisted the rope around his trunk. Then he began to pull his very best, and soon the whale came up out of the water.  Then each saw that the other had hold of the rope.  \"How is this?\" cried the whale. \"I thought I was pulling Brother Rabbit's cow.\"  \"That is what I thought,\" said the elephant. \"Brother Rabbit is making fun of us. He must pay for this. I forbid him to eat a blade of grass on land, because he played a trick on us.\"  \"And I will not allow him to drink a drop of water in the sea,\" said the whale.  But Little Rabbit sat in the bushes and laughed, and laughed, and laughed.  \"Much do I care,\" he said. \"I can get all the green things I want, and I don't like salt water.\"  --SOUTHERN FOLK TALE.     [Illustration: A mother with children in winter]  A CHRISTMAS WISH     I'd like a stocking made for a giant,     And a meeting house full of toys;   Then I'd go out on a happy hunt     For the poor little girls and boys;   Up the street and down the street,     And across and over the town,   I'd search and find them every one,     Before the sun went down.    One would want a new jack-knife     Sharp enough to cut;   One would long for a doll with hair,     And eyes that open and shut;   One would ask for a china set     With dishes all to her mind;   One would wish a Noah's ark     With beasts of every kind.    Some would like a doll cook-stove     And a little toy wash tub;   Some would prefer a little drum,     For a noisy rub-a-dub;   Some would wish for a story book,     And some for a set of blocks;   Some would be wild with happiness     Over a new tool-box.    And some would rather have little shoes,     And other things warm to wear,   For many children are very poor,     And the winter is hard to bear;   I'd buy soft flannels for little frocks,     And a thousand stockings or so,   And the jolliest little coats and cloaks,     To keep out the frost and snow.  [Illustration: Christmas toys]    I'd load a wagon with caramels     And candy of every kind,   And buy all the almond and pecan nuts     And taffy that I could find;   And barrels and barrels of oranges     I'd scatter right in the way,   So the children would find them the very first thing,     When they wake on Christmas day.  --EUGENE FIELD.     [Illustration: The church tower]  THE CHRISTMAS BELLS  I   Long, long ago, in a far away city, there was a large church. The tower of this church was so high that it seamed to touch the clouds, and in the high tower there were three wonderful bells. When they rang, they made sweet music.  There was something strange about these bells. They were never heard to ring except on Christmas eve, and no one knew who rang them. Some people thought it was the wind blowing through the tower. Others thought the angels rang them when a gift pleased the Christ Child.  Although the people did not know what rang the bells, they loved to hear them. They would come from miles around to listen to the wonderful music. When they had heard the bells, they would go out of the church, silent but happy. Then all would go back to their homes feeling that Christmas had come, indeed.  One Christmas eve the people in the church waited and waited, but the bells did not ring. Silently and sadly they went home. Christmas after Christmas came and went. Nearly one hundred years passed by, and in all that time the bells did not ring.  People sometimes asked one another, \"Do you suppose the bells ever did ring?\"  \"Yes,\" said one very old man. \"I have often heard my father tell how beautifully they rang on Christmas eve. There was more love in the world then.\"  Every Christmas eve the church was filled with people who waited and listened. They hoped that the bells would ring again as they had rung long ago. Though many gifts were laid on the altar, still the bells did not ring.   II   Christmas was near at hand again, and every one was happy.  Not far from the city two little brothers lived on a farm--Pedro and Little Brother.  Their father was poor and had no gift to lay on the altar. But Pedro had saved all his earnings, and he had one shining silver piece. His father had promised the little boys that they might go to the church on Christmas eve and take the gift.  It was quite dark when the lads started on their way to the city. The snow was falling fast, but they buttoned their little jackets close about them and walked along briskly. They were not far from the church when they heard a low whine of distress. Little Brother, clinging to Pedro in fear, cried, \"What is it, Pedro, what is it?\"  Pedro ran across the street, and there under a small heap of snow, what do you think he found? A little black and white dog, shivering with cold, and nearly starved. Pedro opened his jacket, and put the dog inside to keep it warm.  \"You will have to go to the church alone, Little Brother,\" Pedro said. \"I must take this little dog back to the farm, and give it food, else it will die.\"  \"But I don't want to go alone, Pedro,\" said Little Brother.  \"Won't you please go and put my gift on the altar, Little Brother? I wish so much to have it there to-night.\"  \"Yes, Pedro, I will,\" said Little Brother.  He took the gift and started toward the church. Pedro turned and went home.  When Little Brother came to the great stone church and looked up at the high tower, he felt that he could not go in alone. He stood outside a long time watching the people as they passed in. At last he entered quietly and took a seat in a corner.   III   When Little Brother went into the church, all the people were seated. They sat quietly hoping that at last the bells would ring again as in the days of old.  The organ pealed out a Christmas hymn. The choir and the people arose, and all sang the grand old anthem. Then a solemn voice said, \"Bring now your gifts to the altar.\"  The king arose and went forward with stately tread. Bowing before the altar, he laid upon it his golden crown. Then he walked proudly back to his seat. All the people listened, but the bells did not ring.  Then the queen arose and with haughty step walked to the front. She took from her neck and wrists her beautiful jewels and laid them upon the altar. All the people listened, but the bells did not ring.  Then the soldiers came marching proudly forward. They took their jeweled swords from their belts and laid them upon the altar. All the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15170"],["title","The Child's World: Third Reader (#6)"],["body","listened, but the bells did not ring.  Then the rich men came hurrying forward. They counted great sums of gold and laid them in a businesslike way upon the altar. All the people listened, but the bells did not ring.  \"Can I go all alone to the front of the church and lay this small gift on the altar?\" said Little Brother. \"Oh, how can I? how can I?\"  Then he said, \"But I told Pedro I would, and I must.\"  So he slipped slowly around by the outer aisle. He crept quietly up to the altar and softly laid the silver piece upon the very edge.  And listen! What do you think was heard? The bells, the bells!  Oh, how happy the people were! And how happy Little Brother was! He ran out of the church and down the road toward the farm.  Pedro had warmed the dog and fed it, and was now on the way to the city. He hoped that he might see the people come out of the church.  Down the road Little Brother came running. Throwing himself into Pedro's arms, he cried, \"Oh, Pedro, Pedro! The bells, the bells! I wish you could have heard them; and they rang when I laid your gift on the altar.\"  \"I did hear them, Little Brother,\" said Pedro. \"Their sound came to me over the snow,--the sweetest music I ever heard.\"  Long years after, when Pedro grew to be a man, he was a great musician. Many, many people came to hear him play.  Some one said to him one day, \"How can you play so sweetly? I never heard such music before.\"  \"Ah,\" said Pedro, \"but you never heard the Christmas bells as I heard them that Christmas night years and years ago.\"  --OLD TALE RETOLD.

SQUEAKY AND THE SCARE BOX  I   Once upon a time a family of mice lived in the pantry wall. There was a father mouse, there was a mother mouse, and there were three little baby mice.  One little mouse had sharp bright eyes and could see everything, even in the darkest holes. He was called Sharpeyes. His brother could sniff and smell anything, wherever it might be hidden, and he was called Sniffy. The baby mouse had such a squeaky little voice that he was called Squeaky. He was always singing, \"Ee-ee-ee!\"  Mother mouse was very wise, and she had taught her babies to run and hide when they saw the old cat coming. She had also taught them not to go near a trap. The little mice obeyed their mother, and they were happy in their home in the pantry wall.  They had many good times together. I could not tell you about all of these, but I am going to tell you about their Christmas party and what happened to Squeaky.  It was the night before Christmas. The stockings hung by the chimney, and the tall tree was standing in the parlor. The children were asleep, and the father and mother had gone upstairs to bed.  In the pantry wall, the little mice were all wide-awake.  \"Ee-ee-ee!\" squeaked Squeaky; \"why can't we creep into the big room and see the tall Christmas tree? The children have talked about it for days, and we have never seen one. Mother, please let us go and see it.\"  \"Yes,\" said Sniffy, \"do let us go. Everything smells so good. The children and the cook made long strings of pop corn to-day. I found a little on the pantry floor, and I want some more.\"  \"I peeped out of our hole,\" said Sharpeyes, \"and I saw cake and candy all ready for the children. Oh, I do want a bite of those good things! Please let us have a Christmas party.\"  \"Well,\" said mother mouse, \"I will ask your father. If he says it is safe, we will go.\"  When mother mouse asked father mouse, he said, \"I will go out first and look all about. If it is safe, I will come back for you.\"  So father mouse crept softly through the pantry, down the long hall, and into the parlor. The cat was nowhere to be seen. Father mouse ran back to the pantry and cried, \"The cat is not near; come and see the tree.\"   II   Then all the mice came scampering from the hole in the wall. They crept through the pantry, down the long hall, and into the parlor. When they saw the tall Christmas tree, they squeaked again and again in their joy. Then they ran around and around the tree to see what was on it.  [Illustration: The mice look at the Christmas tree]  On the floor they saw a wonderful doll's house. \"How fine it would be to live there!\" they squeaked.  They ran up and down the stairs, sat on the chairs, and lay down in the beds. Oh, they had a merry time!  Then Sniffy said, \"I smell that good pop corn again. Let's climb up into the Christmas tree and get some.\"  They climbed up into the tree. They nibbled the pop corn; they nibbled the candy; they nibbled the nuts; and they nibbled the cakes.  Soon Sharpeyes cried out, \"Come here, I see a mouse! I see a mouse! But he doesn't look like our family at all.\"  \"I should say not,\" sniffed Sniffy; \"and how good he smells!\"  \"Why, he is good to eat!\" squeaked Squeaky; and they all began to eat the chocolate mouse.  Then they found another candy mouse--a pretty pink one. They were so busy eating it that they forgot to watch and listen; then--bang! The door was opened, and the lights were turned on.  With a squeak, the mice scampered down from the tree; then they ran along the hall, through the pantry, and back to their home. There was the father mouse, and the mother mouse, and Sharpeyes, and Sniffy. But where was Squeaky?   III   Now, as Squeaky tried to run down the tree, he fell heels over head. Down, down, down, he fell until he was caught in a funny box. An ugly man with black hair and black whiskers seemed to be hopping out of the box.  When Squeaky saw the lights turned on, he hid under the dress of this queer man. He lay very, very still, for he had been taught to be still when danger was near. He heard voices. The father and mother had come back.  \"Yes,\" the father was saying; \"it would have been a shame to forget this train. I would like it to come right out from under the tree. Help me put the track down, mother.\"  When the train was just where it should be, the mother turned to the beautiful tree.  \"Why, look at that Jack-in-the-box,\" she said. \"The man is hanging out. That will never do. I will shut the box. Teddy must see the man jump out.\"  The mother pushed the man with the black hair down, down, into the box and shut the lid. Poor Squeaky felt the springs close down on him and squeaked, \"Ee-ee-\"  \"That was a fine squeak,\" said the father. \"The toys are wonderful these days.\"  \"Yes,\" said the mother, as she turned off the light. \"When I was a child, we did not have such toys.\"  \"I am in a trap,\" said poor Squeaky, \"but there isn't even a bit of cheese in it. I wonder what kind of trap it is; nothing seems to hurt me. Well, I am safe for a while, and I hope I shall soon get out.\"  Squeaky lay in the box all night, and wondered what Sniffy and Sharpeyes were doing. The next morning, he heard children calling, \"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!\" And soon the toys were taken down, one by one. Then such a noise was heard--drums beating, horns tooting, children shouting. You should have heard it.  [Illustration: The mother is surprised as Squeaky escapes]  \"See our new doll's house!\" cried one child.  \"See my new train! How fast it goes!\" cried another.  \"And see my beautiful dolly!\" cried another. \"She can open and shut her eyes.\"  By and by the mother took the box from the tree. \"Come here, Teddy,\" she said. \"Here is a scare box. We will have some fun. Watch me open the lid.\"  Teddy stood by his mother and watched closely.  \"Are you ready?\" asked his mother. \"Well, let us count. One, two, three!\"  The lid flew open, and out jumped the man with the black hair and black whiskers. And with a squeak of joy, out jumped the mouse.  \"Ee-ee-ee!\" he cried, as he ran away.  \"Ee!\" said the Jack-in-the-box.  \"Whee-ee-ee!\" cried the boy with delight.  \"Oh,--a mouse! a mouse!\" cried the mother. Then she threw the box on the floor and jumped up on her chair.  \"Where? where?\" cried all the children.  But they saw only the tip of Squeaky's tail as he ran across the hall to the pantry. Another moment and he was safe in the hole in the pantry wall.  The children's father laughed as he helped their mother climb down from the chair.  \"Well,\" he said, \"how did _you_ enjoy Teddy's scare box?\"  --GEORGENE FAULKNER.

[Illustration: The goose and the hen]  MAKING THE BEST OF IT   \"What a dreary day it is!\" grumbled the old gray goose to the brown hen. They were standing at the henhouse window watching the falling snow which covered every nook and corner of the farmyard.  \"Yes, indeed,\" said the brown hen. \"I should almost be willing to be made into a chicken pie on such a day.\"  She had scarcely stopped talking when Pekin duck said fretfully, \"I am so hungry that I am almost starved.\"  A little flock of chickens all huddled together wailed in sad tones, \"And we are so thirsty!\"  In fact, all the feathered folk in the henhouse seemed cross and fretful. It is no wonder they felt that way, for they had had nothing to eat or drink since early in the morning. The cold wind howled around their house. Hour after hour went by, but no one came near the henhouse.  The handsome white rooster, however, seemed as happy as usual. That is saying a great deal, for a jollier old fellow than he never lived in a farmyard. Sunshine, rain, or snow were all the same to him, and he "]]]
