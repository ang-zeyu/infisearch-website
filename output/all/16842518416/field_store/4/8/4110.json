I thought of William, who is a Christian preacher, and of the Christian preachers in Pennsylvania. One watching for wolves by night, to rescue Vina and her three children from Christian licentiousness; the other standing erect in open day, seeking the praise of men.  During the four days waiting for the important Sunday morning, I thoroughly surveyed the rocks and shoals of the river from Florence seven miles up, where will be my place of departure. General notice was taken of me as being a stranger, lurking around. Fortunately there are several small grist mills within ten miles around. No taverns here, as in the North; any planter's house entertains travelers occasionally.  One night I stayed at a medical gentleman's, who is not a large planter; another night at an ex-magistrate's house in South Florence--a Virginian by birth--one of the late census takers; told me that many more persons cannot read and write than is reported; one fact, amongst many others, that many persons who do not know the letters of the alphabet, have learned to write their own names; such are generally reported readers and writers.  It being customary for a stranger not to leave the house early in the morning where he has lodged, I was under the necessity of staying out all night Saturday, to be able to meet Peter and Levin, which was accomplished in due time. When we approached, I gave my signal first; immediately they gave theirs. I talked freely. Levin's voice, at first, evidently trembled. No wonder, for my presence universally attracted attention by the lords of the land. Our interview was less than one hour; the laws were written. I to go to Cincinnati to get a rowing boat and provisions; a first class clipper boat to go with speed. To depart from the place where the laws were written, on Saturday night of the first of March. I to meet one of them at the same place Thursday night, previous to the fourth Saturday from the night previous to the Sunday when the laws were written. We to go down the Tennessee river to some place up the Ohio, not yet decided on, in our row boat. Peter and Levin are good oarsmen. So am I. Telegraph station at Tuscumbia, twelve miles from the plantation, also at Paducah.  Came from Florence to here Sunday night by steamboat. Eastport is in Mississippi. Waiting here for a steamboat to go down; paying one dollar a day for board. Like other taverns here, the wretchedness is indescribable; no pen, ink, paper or newspaper to be had; only one room for everybody, except the gambling rooms. It is difficult for me to write. Vina intends to get a pass for Catharine and herself for the first Sunday in March.  The bank of the river where I met Peter and Levin is two miles from the plantation. I have avoided saying I am from Philadelphia. Also avoided talking about negroes. I never talked so much about milling before. I consider most of the trouble over, till I arrive in a free State with my crew, the first week in March; then will I have to be wiser than Christian serpents, and more cautious than doves. I do not consider it safe to keep this letter in my possession, yet I dare not put it in the post-office here; there is so little business in these post-offices that notice might be taken.  I am evidently watched; everybody knows me to be a miller. I may write again when I get to Cincinnati, if I should have time. The ex-magistrate, with whom I stayed in South Florence, held three hours' talk with me, exclusive of our morning talk. Is a man of good general information; he was exceedingly inquisitive. \"I am from Cincinnati, formerly from the _State of New York_.\" I had no opportunity to get anything to eat from seven o'clock Tuesday morning till six o'clock Wednesday evening, except the hoe cake, and no sleep.  Florence is the head of navigation for small steamboats. Seven miles, all the way up to my place of departure, is swift water, and rocky. Eight hundred miles to Cincinnati. I found all things here as Peter told me, except the distance of the river. South Florence contains twenty white families, three warehouses of considerable business, a post-office, but no school. McKiernon is here waiting for a steamboat to go to New Orleans, so we are in company.  PRINCETON, GIBSON COUNTY, INDIANA, FEB. 18, 1851.  To Wm. Still:--The plan is to go to Canada, on the Wabash, opposite Detroit. There are four routes to Canada. One through Illinois, commencing above and below Alton; one through to North Indiana, and the Cincinnati route, being the largest route in the United States.  I intended to have gone through Pennsylvania, but the risk going up the Ohio river has caused me to go to Canada. Steamboat traveling is universally condemned, though many go in boats, consequently many get lost. Going in a skiff is new, and is approved of in my case. After I arrive at the mouth of the Tennessee river, I will go up the Ohio seventy-five miles, to the mouth of the Wabash, then up the Wabash, forty-four miles to New Harmony, where I shall go ashore by night, and go thirteen miles east, to Charles Grier, a farmer, (colored man), who will entertain us, and next night convey us sixteen miles to David Stormon, near Princeton, who will take the command, and I be released.  David Stormon estimates the expenses from his house to Canada, at forty dollars, without which, no sure protection will be given. They might be instructed concerning the course, and beg their way through without money. If you wish to do what should be done, you will send me fifty dollars, in a letter, to Princeton, Gibson county, Inda., so as to arrive there by the 8th of March. Eight days should be estimated for a letter to arrive from Philadelphia.  The money to be State Bank of Ohio, or State Bank, or Northern Bank of Kentucky, or any other Eastern bank. Send no notes larger than twenty dollars.  Levi Coffin had no money for me. I paid twenty dollars for the skiff. No money to get back to Philadelphia. It was not understood that I would have to be at any expense seeking aid.  One half of my time has been used in trying to find persons to assist, when I may arrive on the Ohio river, in which I have failed, except Stormon.  Having no letter of introduction to Stormon from any source, on which I could fully rely, I traveled two hundred miles around, to find out his stability. I have found many Abolitionists, nearly all who have made propositions, which themselves would not comply with, and nobody else would. Already I have traveled over three thousand miles. Two thousand and four hundred by steamboat, two hundred by railroad, one hundred by stage, four hundred on foot, forty-eight in a skiff.  I have yet five hundred miles to go to the plantation, to commence operations. I have been two weeks on the decks of steamboats, three nights out, two of which I got perfectly wet. If I had had paper money, as McKim desired, it would have been destroyed. I have not been entertained gratis at any place except Stormon's. I had one hundred and twenty-six dollars when I left Philadelphia, one hundred from you, twenty-six mine.  Telegraphed to station at Evansville, thirty-three miles from Stormon's, and at Vinclure's, twenty-five miles from Stormon's. The Wabash route is considered the safest route. No one has ever been lost from Stormon's to Canada. Some have been lost between Stormon's and the Ohio. The wolves have never suspected Stormon. Your asking aid in money for a case properly belonging east of Ohio, is detested. If you have sent money to Cincinnati, you should recall it. I will have no opportunity to use it.  Seth Concklin, Princeton, Gibson county, Ind.  P.S. First of April, will be about the time Peter's family will arrive opposite Detroit. You should inform yourself how to find them there. I may have no opportunity.  I will look promptly for your letter at Princeton, till the 10th of March, and longer if there should have been any delay by the mails.  In March, as contemplated, Concklin arrived in Indiana, at the place designated, with Peter's wife and three children, and sent a thrilling letter to the writer, portraying in the most vivid light his adventurous flight from the hour they left Alabama until their arrival in Indiana. In this report he stated, that instead of starting early in the morning, owing to some unforeseen delay on the part of the family, they did not reach the designated place till towards day, which greatly exposed them in passing a certain town which he had hoped to avoid.  But as his brave heart was bent on prosecuting his journey without further delay, he concluded to start at all hazards, notwithstanding the dangers he apprehended from passing said town by daylight. For safety he endeavored to hide his freight by having them all lie flat down on the bottom of the skiff; covered them with blankets, concealing them from the effulgent beams of the early morning sun, or rather from the \"Christian Wolves\" who might perchance espy him from the shore in passing the town.  The wind blew fearfully. Concklin was rowing heroically when loud voices from the shore hailed him, but he was utterly deaf to the sound. Immediately one or two guns were fired in the direction of the skiff, but he heeded not this significant call; consequently here ended this difficulty. He supposed, as the wind was blowing so hard, those on shore who hailed him must have concluded that he did not hear them and that he meant no disrespect in treating them with seeming indifference. Whilst many straits and great dangers had to be passed, this was the greatest before reaching their destination.  But suffice it to say that the glad tidings which this letter contained filled the breast of Peter with unutterable delight and his friends and relations with wonder beyond degree.[A] No fond wife had ever waited with more longing desire for the return of her husband than Peter had for this blessed news. All doubts had disappeared, and a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15263"],["title","The Underground Railroad (#5)"],["body"," grounded hope was cherished that within a few short days Peter and his fond wife and children would be reunited in Freedom on the Canada side, and that Concklin and the friends would be rejoicing with joy unspeakable over this great triumph. But alas, before the few days had expired the subjoined brief paragraph of news was discovered in the morning Ledger.  [Footnote A: In some unaccountable manner this the last letter Concklin ever penned, perhaps, has been unfortunately lost.]       RUNAWAY NEGROES CAUGHT.--At Vincennes, Indiana, on Saturday     last, a white man and four negroes were arrested. The negroes     belong to B. McKiernon, of South Florence, Alabama, and the man     who was running them off calls himself John H. Miller. The     prisoners were taken charge of by the Marshall of     Evansville.--_April 9th_.   How suddenly these sad tidings turned into mourning and gloom the hope and joy of Peter and his relatives no pen could possibly describe; at least the writer will not attempt it here, but will at once introduce a witness who met the noble Concklin and the panting fugitives in Indiana and proffered them sympathy and advice. And it may safely be said from a truer and more devoted friend of the slave they could not have received counsel.       EVANSVILLE, INDIANA, MARCH 31st, 1851.      WM. STILL: _Dear Sir_ ,--On last Tuesday I mailed a letter to     you, written by Seth Concklin. I presume you have received that     letter. It gave an account of his rescue of the family of your     brother. If that is the last news you have had from them, I have     very painful intelligence for you. They passed on from near     Princeton, where I saw them and had a lengthy interview with     them, up north, I think twenty-three miles above Vincennes,     Ind., where they were seized by a party of men, and lodged in     jail. Telegraphic dispatches were sent all through the South. I     have since learned that the Marshall of Evansville received a     dispatch from Tuscumbia, to look out for them. By some means, he     and the master, so says report, went to Vincennes and claimed     the fugitives, chained Mr. Concklin and hurried all off. Mr.     Concklin wrote to Mr. David Stormon, Princeton, as soon as he     was cast into prison, to find bail. So soon as we got the letter     and could get off, two of us were about setting off to render     all possible aid, when we were told they all had passed, a few     hours before, through Princeton, Mr. Concklin in chains. What     kind of process was had, if any, I know not. I immediately came     down to this place, and learned that they had been put on a boat     at 3 P.M. I did not arrive until 6. Now all hopes of their     recovery are gone. No case ever so enlisted my sympathies. I had     seen Mr. Concklin in Cincinnati. I had given him aid and     counsel. I happened to see them after they landed in Indiana. I     heard Peter and Levin tell their tale of suffering, shed tears     of sorrow for them all; but now, since they have fallen a prey     to the unmerciful blood-hounds of this state, and have again     been dragged back to unrelenting bondage, I am entirely     unmanned. And poor Concklin! I fear for him. When he is dragged     back to Alabama, I fear they will go far beyond the utmost rigor     of the law, and vent their savage cruelty upon him. It is with     pain I have to communicate these things. But you may not hear     them from him. I could not get to see him or them, as Vincennes     is about thirty miles from Princeton, where I was when I heard     of the capture.      I take pleasure in stating that, according to the letter he     (Concklin) wrote to Mr. D. Stewart, Mr. Concklin did not abandon     them, but risked his own liberty to save them. He was not with     them when they were taken; but went afterwards to take them out     of jail upon a writ of Habeas Corpus, when they seized him too     and lodged him in prison.      I write in much haste. If I can learn any more facts of     importance, I may write you. If you desire to hear from me     again, or if you should learn any thing specific from Mr.     Concklin, be pleased to write me at Cincinnati, where I expect     to be in a short time. If curious to know your correspondent, I     may say I was formerly Editor of the \"New Concord Free Press,\"     Ohio. I only add that every case of this kind only tends to make     me abhor my (no!) _this_ country more and more. It is the     Devil's Government, and God will destroy it.      Yours for the slave, N.R. JOHNSTON.      P.S. I broke open this letter to write you some more. The     foregoing pages were written at night. I expected to mail it     next morning before leaving Evansville; but the boat for which I     was waiting came down about three in the morning; so I had to     hurry on board, bringing the letter along. As it now is I am not     sorry, for coming down, on my way to St. Louis, as far as     Paducah, there I learned from a colored man at the wharf that,     that same day, in the morning, the master and the family of     fugitives arrived off the boat, and had then gone on their     journey to Tuscumbia, but that the \"white man\" (Mr. Concklin)     had \"got away from them,\" about twelve miles up the river. It     seems he got off the boat some way, near or at Smithland, Ky., a     town at the mouth of the Cumberland River. I presume the report     is true, and hope he will finally escape, though I was also told     that they were in pursuit of him. Would that the others had also     escaped. Peter and Levin could have done so, I think, if they     had had resolution. One of them rode a horse, he not tied     either, behind the coach in which the others were. He followed     apparently \"contented and happy.\" From report, they told their     master, and even their pursuers, before the master came, that     Concklin had decoyed them away, they coming unwillingly. I write     on a very unsteady boat.      Yours, N.R. JOHNSTON.   A report found its way into the papers to the effect that \"Miller,\" the white man arrested in connection with the capture of the family, was found drowned, with his hands and feet in chains and his skull fractured. It proved, as his friends feared, to be Seth Concklin. And in irons, upon the river bank, there is no doubt he was buried.  In this dreadful hour one sad duty still remained to be performed. Up to this moment the two sisters were totally ignorant of their brother's whereabouts. Not the first whisper of his death had reached them. But they must now be made acquainted with all the facts in the case. Accordingly an interview was arranged for a meeting, and the duty of conveying this painful intelligence to one of the sisters, Mrs. Supplee, devolved upon Mr. McKim. And most tenderly and considerately did he perform his mournful task.  Although a woman of nerve, and a true friend to the slave, an earnest worker and a liberal giver in the Female Anti-Slavery Society, for a time she was overwhelmed by the intelligence of her brother's death. As soon as possible, however, through very great effort, she controlled her emotions, and calmly expressed herself as being fully resigned to the awful event. Not a word of complaint had she to make because she had not been apprised of his movements; but said repeatedly, that, had she known ever so much of his intentions, she would have been totally powerless in opposing him if she had felt so disposed, and as an illustration of the true character of the man, from his boyhood up to the day he died for his fellow-man, she related his eventful career, and recalled a number of instances of his heroic and daring deeds for others, sacrificing his time and often periling his life in the cause of those who he considered were suffering gross wrongs and oppression. Hence, she concluded, that it was only natural for him in this case to have taken the steps he did. Now and then overflowing tears would obstruct this deeply thrilling and most remarkable story she was telling of her brother, but her memory seemed quickened by the sadness of the occasion, and she was enabled to recall vividly the chief events connected with his past history. Thus his agency in this movement, which cost him his life, could readily enough be accounted for, and the individuals who listened attentively to the story were prepared to fully appreciate his character, for, prior to offering his services in this mission, he had been a stranger to them.  The following extract, taken from a letter of a subsequent date, in addition to the above letter, throws still further light upon the heart-rending affair, and shows Mr. Johnston's deep sympathy with the sufferers and the oppressed generally--    EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM REV. N.R. JOHNSTON.        My heart bleeds when I think of those poor, hunted and     heart-broken fugitives, though a most interesting family, taken     back to bondage ten-fold worse than Egyptian. And then poor     Concklin! How my heart expanded in love to him, as he told me     his adventures, his trials, his toils, his fears and his hopes!     After hearing all, and then seeing and communing with the     family, now joyful in hopes of soon seeing their husband and     father in the land of freedom; now in terror lest the human     blood-hounds should be at their heels, I felt as though I could     lay down my life in the cause of the oppressed. In that hour or     two of intercourse with Peter's family, my heart warmed with     love to them. I never saw more interesting young men. They would     make Remonds or Douglasses, if they had the same opportunities.      While I was with them, I was elated with joy at their escape,     and yet, when I heard their tale of woe, especially that of the     mother, I could not suppress tears of deepest emotion.      My joy was short-lived. Soon I heard of their capture. The     telegraph had been the means of their being claimed. I could"]]]
