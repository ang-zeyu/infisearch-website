If the murder was planned artistically, in his attempt to throw the onus of the crime upon innocent shoulders he has been guilty of a piece of very mediocre work. It would not deceive a child.\"  \"No, I agree with you there. The discovery of that photograph has done more to convince me of the innocence of Miss Merlin than any amount of testimonials to her good character could ever have done. You see,\" he added, smiling whimsically, \"all sorts of people hitherto unsuspected by their closest friends of criminal tendency, develop that taint, so that I am never surprised to find a convicted thief or assassin possessed of credentials which would do justice to an Archbishop. But when I see an obviously artificial clew I recognize it a mile off. Real clews never stare you in the face like that.\"  Coming out of the front door, we walked down the leaf-strewn drive to find that the constable on duty at the gate had been joined by a plain-clothes man who was evidently waiting to speak to the Inspector.  \"Yes?\" said Gatton eagerly, at sight of the newcomer.  \"We have her, sir,\" he reported tersely.  \"Does he refer to Marie?\" I asked.  Gatton nodded.  \"I think, Mr. Addison,\" he said, \"I will proceed immediately to Bow Street, where she has been taken to be interrogated. Will you come with me or are you otherwise engaged?\"  I hesitated ere I replied:  \"I do not particularly want to confront this woman, but I should be much indebted if you could let me know the result of your examination.\"  \"I shall do that without fail,\" said Gatton, \"and some time to-day I should be obliged if you could provide me with the facts concerning the little cat-images which you said you had in your possession.\"  \"Certainly,\" I agreed. \"You are still of the opinion that the mark upon the crate and the image of the cat-woman have an important bearing upon the crime?\"  \"I don't doubt it,\" was the reply. \"If the photograph clew is a false one, the cat clew is a true one and one to be followed up. Perhaps,\" he added, \"it would be as well if you returned now and looked out the points which you think would be of interest, as when I come I may not have long to stay.\"  \"I will do so,\" I said, \"although I think I can lay my hands upon the material almost immediately.\"  Accordingly Gatton set off with the detective who had brought the news of Marie's arrest and I, turning in the opposite direction, proceeded towards my cottage in such a state of mental tumult respecting what the end of all this would be and what it might mean for Isobel, that I found myself unable to think connectedly; and needless to say I failed to conjure up by any stretch of the imagination a theory which could cover this amazing and terrible sequence of events.     CHAPTER VII  THE CAT OF BUBASTIS   \"She belongs to the innumerable family of cats which suddenly came forth from the ruins of Tell Bastah in 1878,\" I wrote, Sir Gaston Maspero's \"Egyptian Art\" lying before me on the table, \"and were in a few years scattered over the whole world.\"  \"She is Bâst, a goddess of good family, the worship of whom flourished especially in the east of the delta, and she is very often drawn or named on the monuments, although they do not tell us enough of her myths or her origin. She was allied or related to the Sun, and was now said to be his sister or wife, now his daughter. She sometimes filled a gracious and beneficent rôle, protecting men against contagious diseases or evil spirits, keeping them off by the music of her sistrum: she had also her hours of treacherous perversity, during which she played with her victim as with a mouse, before finishing him off with a blow of her claws. She dwelt by preference in the city that bore her name, Poubastit, the Bubastis of classical writers. Her temple, at which Cheops and Chephren had worked while building their pyramids, was rebuilt by the Pharaohs of the 22nd Dynasty, enlarged by those of the 26th; when Herodotus visited it in the middle of the fifth century B.C. he considered it one of the most remarkable he had seen in the parts of Egypt through which he had traveled.  \"The fêtes of Bâst attracted pilgrims from all parts of Egypt, as at the present day those of Sidi Ahmed el-Bedawee draw people to the modern fair of Tantah. The people of each village crowded into large boats to get there, men and women pell-mell, with the fixed intention of enjoying themselves on the journey, a thing they never failed to do. They accompanied the slow progress of navigation with endless songs, love songs rather than sacred hymns, and there were also to be found among them flute-players and castanet-players to support or keep time to the voices. Whenever they passed by a town they approached the bank as near as they could without landing, and then, while the orchestra redoubled its noise, the passengers threw volleys of insults and coarse remarks at the women standing on the banks; they retorted, and when they had exhausted words ...\"  I finished my notes at this point; the improper behavior of the Ancient Egyptians mentioned by the great Egyptologist having no possible bearing upon the matter in hand, I thought. I then proceeded to add some facts directly relating to the votive offerings laid at the feet of the goddess.  \"The greater number of pilgrims, before returning home, left a souvenir of their visit at the feet of Bâst. It was a votive stele with a fine inscription, and a picture showing the donor worshiping his goddess; or a statuette in blue or green pottery, or if they were wealthy, in bronze, silver, or sometimes gold: the goddess would be standing, seated, crouching, with a woman's body and a cat's head, a sistrum or an ægis in her hand. During the Greek period the figures were in bronze or in painted or gilded wood surmounted by a cat's head in bronze, many were life-size and modeled with elaborate art; they had eyes of enamel and amulets on the forehead.\"  The learned authority went on to explain that these accumulated offerings were after a time stored by the priests in cellars or in pits dug expressly for them, \"veritable _favissæ_ similar to those of classical times.\" They accumulated in thousands, large and small, some intact and fresh as when just made, others already out of shape and of no value. The places of concealment were soon forgotten, and the stores hidden therein reposed beyond the reach of men until the day when the chances of excavation brought them to light.  My notes completed, I turned my attention to the little image of green enamel ware which Gatton had left with me for examination. It was not possible to determine the period at which it was buried, but judging from the contours and general forms, together with the aspect of the enamel, I thought I recognized the style of the second Saïte Period, and attributed the piece to the early Ptolemies, or the fourth century B.C. It was the time when the worship of Bâst and her subordinate forms, Pakh, Maît, was most popular, the period when the most extensive cemetery of cats was established in Egypt. The execution of the little figure was pure Egyptian, and in no way betrayed Greek influence.  So far had my studies proceeded when I heard the door-bell ring, and Coates entered the room.  \"Detective-Inspector Gatton to see you, sir.\"  Gatton came in looking if anything more puzzled than when I had left him at the Red House; also I thought he looked tired, and:  \"Mix yourself a drink, Inspector,\" I said, pointing to a side-table upon which refreshments were placed.  \"Thanks,\" replied Gatton. \"I have not had time to stop for a drink or even a smoke since I left you; but evidence is coming in quickly enough now.\"  He helped himself to a whisky and soda, being an old visitor and one used to the Bohemian ways of my household; then setting his glass upon a corner of my writing-table, he dropped into the armchair and began in leisurely fashion to fill his pipe.  Although the hour was growing late, sunset was still a long way off and the prospect visible through the window was bathed in golden light. From where I sat I could catch a glimpse of the tree-lined road, and for the first time since that strange experience had befallen me, I found myself wondering if the vaguely-perceived follower whom I had detected on the previous night and those blazing feline eyes which had looked out at me from beneath the shadow of the hedge could have had any possible connection with the tragedy which at about the same hour was being enacted in the Red House. I determined presently to confide the strange particulars to my friend, but first I was all anxiety to learn what evidence Marie had given; and that this evidence, to which he had referred had done little more than to increase Gatton's perplexity was clear enough from his expression. Therefore:  \"Tell me about Marie,\" I said.  Gatton smiled grimly, took a drink from his glass, and then:  \"She began of course as I had anticipated, by denying all knowledge of the matter, but recognizing that she was in a tight corner, she presently changed her tactics, and although every available plan was tried to induce her to change her ground, she afterwards stuck to the extraordinary story which we first extracted from her. Briefly it was this:  \"The late Sir Marcus had been paying unwelcome attention to Miss Merlin for a long time, and Marie had instructions that he was to be discouraged as much as possible. In fact I am pleased to say that your theory of Miss Merlin's ignorance respecting the murder plot is borne out by the testimony of her maid. On several occasions, it appears, when he sent his card to the dressing-room, Marie returned equivocal messages and did not even inform her mistress of Sir Marcus's visit. This had been going on for some time when one night whilst Miss"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1533"],["title","Macbeth (#0)"],["body","MACBETH  by William Shakespeare  Contents  ACT I Scene I.

That will be ere the set of sun.  FIRST WITCH. Where the place?  SECOND WITCH. Upon the heath.  THIRD WITCH. There to meet with Macbeth.  FIRST WITCH. I come, Graymalkin!  SECOND WITCH. Paddock calls.  THIRD WITCH. Anon.  ALL. Fair is foul, and foul is fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A Camp near Forres.   Alarum within. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with  Attendants, meeting a bleeding Captain.  DUNCAN. What bloody man is that? He can report, As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt The newest state.  MALCOLM. This is the sergeant Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought ’Gainst my captivity.—Hail, brave friend! Say to the King the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it.  SOLDIER. Doubtful it stood; As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald (Worthy to be a rebel, for to that The multiplying villainies of nature Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied; And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling, Show’d like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak; For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name), Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish’d steel, Which smok’d with bloody execution, Like Valour’s minion, carv’d out his passage, Till he fac’d the slave; Which ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him, Till he unseam’d him from the nave to the chops, And fix’d his head upon our battlements.  DUNCAN. O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!  SOLDIER. As whence the sun ’gins his reflection Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break, So from that spring, whence comfort seem’d to come Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark: No sooner justice had, with valour arm’d, Compell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heels, But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage, With furbish’d arms and new supplies of men, Began a fresh assault.  DUNCAN. Dismay’d not this Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?  SOLDIER. Yes; As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion. If I say sooth, I must report they were As cannons overcharg’d with double cracks; So they Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe: Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds, Or memorize another Golgotha, I cannot tell— But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.  DUNCAN. So well thy words become thee as thy wounds: They smack of honour both.—Go, get him surgeons.   [_Exit Captain, attended._]   Enter Ross and Angus.  Who comes here?  MALCOLM. The worthy Thane of Ross.  LENNOX. What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look That seems to speak things strange.  ROSS. God save the King!  DUNCAN. Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?  ROSS. From Fife, great King, Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold. Norway himself, with terrible numbers, Assisted by that most disloyal traitor, The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict; Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapp’d in proof, Confronted him with self-comparisons, Point against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm, Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude, The victory fell on us.  DUNCAN. Great happiness!  ROSS. That now Sweno, the Norways’ king, craves composition; Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use.  DUNCAN. No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death, And with his former title greet Macbeth.  ROSS. I’ll see it done.  DUNCAN. What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. A heath.   Thunder. Enter the three Witches.  FIRST WITCH. Where hast thou been, sister?  SECOND WITCH. Killing swine.  THIRD WITCH. Sister, where thou?  FIRST WITCH. A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap, And mounch’d, and mounch’d, and mounch’d. “Give me,” quoth I. “Aroint thee, witch!” the rump-fed ronyon cries. Her husband’s to Aleppo gone, master o’ th’ _Tiger:_ But in a sieve I’ll thither sail, And, like a rat without a tail, I’ll do, I’ll do, and I’ll do.  SECOND WITCH. I’ll give thee a wind.  FIRST WITCH. Th’art kind.  THIRD WITCH. And I another.  FIRST WITCH. I myself have all the other, And the very ports they blow, All the quarters that they know I’ the shipman’s card. I will drain him dry as hay: Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his pent-house lid; He shall live a man forbid. Weary sev’n-nights nine times nine, Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine: Though his bark cannot be lost, Yet it shall be tempest-tost. Look what I have.  SECOND WITCH. Show me, show me.  FIRST WITCH. Here I have a pilot’s thumb, Wrack’d as homeward he did come.   [_Drum within._]  THIRD WITCH. A drum, a drum! Macbeth doth come.  ALL. The Weird Sisters, hand in hand, Posters of the sea and land, Thus do go about, about: Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine, And thrice again, to make up nine. Peace!—the charm’s wound up.   Enter Macbeth and Banquo.  MACBETH. So foul and fair a day I have not seen.  BANQUO. How far is’t call’d to Forres?—What are these, So wither’d, and so wild in their attire, That look not like the inhabitants o’ th’ earth, And yet are on’t?—Live you? or are you aught That man may question? You seem to understand me, By each at once her choppy finger laying Upon her skinny lips. You should be women, And yet your beards forbid me to interpret That you are so.  MACBETH. Speak, if you can;—what are you?  FIRST WITCH. All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!  SECOND WITCH. All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!  THIRD WITCH. All hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!  BANQUO. Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair?—I’ th’ name of truth, Are ye fantastical, or that indeed Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having and of royal hope, That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not. If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow, and which will not, Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear Your favours nor your hate.  FIRST WITCH. Hail!  SECOND WITCH. Hail!  THIRD WITCH. Hail!  FIRST WITCH. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.  SECOND WITCH. Not so happy, yet much happier.  THIRD WITCH. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none: So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!  FIRST WITCH. Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!  MACBETH. Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more. By Sinel’s death I know I am Thane of Glamis; But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives, A prosperous gentleman; and to be king Stands not within the prospect of belief, No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence? or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting?—Speak, I charge you.   [_Witches vanish._]  BANQUO. The earth hath bubbles, as the water has, And these are of them. Whither are they vanish’d?  MACBETH. Into the air; and what seem’d corporal, Melted as breath into the wind. Would they had stay’d!  BANQUO. Were such things here as we do speak about? Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner?  MACBETH. Your children shall be kings.  BANQUO. You shall be king.  MACBETH. And Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?  BANQUO. To the selfsame tune and words. Who’s here?   Enter Ross and Angus.  ROSS. The King hath happily receiv’d, Macbeth, The news of thy success, and when he reads Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight, His wonders and his praises do contend Which should be thine or his: silenc’d with that, In viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day, He finds thee in"]]]
