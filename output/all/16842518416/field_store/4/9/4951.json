Dotty wished to take her sweet Pusheen and her darling Zip; but it was decided that Pusheen must stay at home, and help keep house.  \"Be a good kitty,\" said her little mistress, embracing her, \"and eat all the mice in the mouse-chamber, 'fore they grow up _rats_!\"  But Zip was allowed to go to Willow-brook; and Dotty watched him all the way, scarcely allowing him to stir from the seat beside her.  \"No,\" said she, holding him firmly by both ears; \"Dotty'd be glad to let you get down, but she doesn't think it's best. You is only a doggie, and you'd get runned over and die. So now, Zippy, you'll have to give up, and it's no use to bark.\"  But Zip, having the spirit of a dog, _would_ bark.  The whole party reached Willow-brook in safety, and had a joyful welcome.  \"Prudy, my aunt Louise is the handsomest lady there is in this world,\" said Dotty, privately.  \"O, Dotty, how can you think so,\" exclaimed Prudy, \"when there's only one woman can be THAT!\"  \"Who's _she_?\"  \"Mother, _of course_!\"  When Dotty was called to supper, she was found beside Pincher's green grave, telling her \"brother Zip\" the story of that dog's death, and trying to impress upon his mind the importance of keeping his paws out of fox-traps.  It was delightful to be at grandma Parlin's once more. The summer-house, the seat in the tree, and the swing, were all in their old places, and had been waiting a whole year for the children. A few things had been added: a hennery,--called by Dotty \"a henpeckery\"--and a graceful white boat, named the Water-Kelpie. This boat was kept chained to a stake on the bank, and no one could have a sail in it without first obtaining the key, which hung over the bird-cage, in the back parlor.  Susy was charmed with the boat. It was lighter and nicer than the old canoe, which had so long been used by the family. She and Lonnie Adams, her aunt Martha's nephew, took daily lessons in rowing; but Susy, who had for years been accustomed to the water, knew how to manage a boat far better than did Master Lonnie. The boy strained every nerve, to very little purpose, while Susy would lightly dip in the paddle, and turn it with perfect ease.  \"I don't care,\" said Lonnie; \"guess you can't drive a nail any better than I can, Susy Parlin, and I can row her some, anyhow. Now, Abner, can't I row her?\"  \"Yes, my boy, I think I've heard you _roar_,\" replied Abner, with a provoking smile.  \"Well, can't I row her this way?\"  \"Middlin' well,\" returned Abner, cautiously; \"but little Sue, here, is the water-man for me.\"  Susy's cheeks glowed, and there was a proud flash in her eyes as they met Lonnie's. At that moment she felt equal to the task of steering a ship across the Atlantic Ocean.  Not long after this praise from Abner, aunt Martha said that she and Master Lonnie were going over the river, after some wild-flower roots, and would be glad to have the boat sent for them at five o'clock.  \"Mayn't I be the one to go?\" asked Susy.  \"If you like,\" replied the grandmother; \"that is, if Abner is willing.\"  Susy knew perfectly well that her grandmother had no idea of allowing her to go alone; but it so happened, when she reached the river-bank with the boat-key, that Abner was nowhere to be seen.  \"Seems to me,\" thought Susy, \"Abner is generally somewhere else.\"  \"Where you goin', all alone, 'thout me?\" cried Dotty Dimple, from the top of the bank.  \"You here? What did you come for?\" said Susy.  For answer, Dotty took a pair of rubber overshoes out of Zip's mouth.  \"Grandma says to put 'em right on, or you'll catch the hookin' cough; the boat's wet.\"  \"There, now,\" said Susy, putting on the rubbers, \"I've forgot the basket for those Jack-in-the-pulpit roots. Didn't grandma send it up?\"  \"No, she sended up _me_,\" replied Dotty; adding, quickly, \"and I'm goin' where you go, you know; and if you don't go anywhere, I'm goin' there, too.\"  \"That's just the way it is with you, Dotty Dimple; always coming when I don't expect you.\"  \"Prudy coaxed me to,\" said Dotty, with one of her sweetest smiles and deepest dimples.  \"Coaxed you?\"  \"Well,\" faltered Dotty, \"she wanted to come her own self. She said she wished I'd stay to home,--so, _of course_ I camed!\"  \"I'll tell you how it is,\" said Susy, thoughtfully. \"That queer old Abner's nowhere to be seen. I suppose he's in the cornfield, or the meadow, or the barn. It's after five; and what will aunt Martha think? I could row across the river well enough by myself, if you'd only run home; you're _such_ a bother!\"  \"O, my darlin' sister Susy! I won't do nothin' but just sit still. Who's your precious comfort?\"  \"Well, I don't know but I'll take you, then. Come, little Miss Trouble, jump into the boat.\"  So Dotty Dimple, being what Mr. Allen had called a \"child-queen,\" had her own way, as usual.  \"Why, where's the paddles?\" said Susy. \"The men must have hid them. Dear me, I can't stop to hunt; and here it is five o'clock long ago! O, I'll take this good smooth shingle, I declare! I guess it washed ashore on purpose; it's almost equal to a paddle.--Now we'll go, all so nice,\" continued Susy, fearlessly dipping the chance-found shingle into the water.  \"O, my suz,\" said Dotty, clapping her hands, which had any amount of dimples on the backs; \"we're goin'!\"  \"Of course we're going!\" said Susy, proudly. \"What did you expect? I can do five times as well with a shingle as Lonnie can with a paddle. What do you suppose aunt Martha'll say? 'Bravo! those are smart children, to be rowing all alone, by themselves'!\"  \"O, Susy, what a hubble-bubble we make in the water! Look at the bubbles winkin' their eyes! See those pretty wrinkles, all puckered up in the water!\"  \"I see them,\" said Susy, steadily plying her shingle; \"but why don't you sit still? You'll tip us both over, as sure as this world; and if we get drowned I guess grandma'll scold! I shall be the one to have all the blame.\"  \"O, dear,\" said Dotty, reeling about from side to side, \"the boat's dizzy! My head's goin' to tip into the water. But don't you cry, Susy; you catch hold of me, and I shan't go!\"  Susy was suddenly seized with mortal terror.  \"Dotty Parlin, I'll never take you anywhere again, as long as I live! You sit as still as ever you can, and fold your hands; fold them both!\"  Dotty obeyed at once, and sat up quite straight, looking very sweet, and at the same time slightly acid, like a stick of lemon-candy. The Water Kelpie, now that Dotty was quiet, floated on, safely and surely, towards the opposite shore.  It was a pretty picture--the white boat, the graceful children, and the still, blue water. Susy's fair arms were bared to the elbows, and her face was deeply flushed. Dotty's beautiful eyes danced, but she herself was motionless and demure.  When they landed, Susy called aloud for her aunt Martha to come and secure the boat. Her voice echoed from afar, waking \"the sleep of the hills,\" but no aunt Martha appeared. The children clambered out at last, and Susy chained the boat to a stick, which she drove into the sand. But the sand was light, and the boat was heavy, and the current strong; so before the children had walked a dozen rods, the Water-Kelpie was floating down stream of its own free will.  Thus it happened that although aunt Martha was certainly surprised, she did not seem very much pleased. She did not say, \"Bravo! my two nieces are smart children, to be rowing all alone by themselves.\" Nothing of the sort. She reproved Susy for her rash conduct, and sent her and Lonnie around two miles, by the bridge, to ask Abner to come for them with the canoe.  Lonnie was very much comforted when he saw that Susy received no praise.  \"I can row her myself,\" said he; \"but I wouldn't put Dotty in, and most drown her, and dab along with that shingle.\"  The runaway Water-Kelpie was caught a little way below the bridge, and Abner slyly laid by the dripping shingle, and afterwards showed it to everybody, as a proof that \"our Sue was an amazin' smart little water man.\"  This famous boat-ride only had the effect to make Dotty Dimple more fearless than ever; but her next adventure on the water proved somewhat serious.     CHAPTER IX.  BROTHER ZIP.   There was to be a remarkable supper at grandma Parlin's, in honor of Colonel Augustus Allen, who was expected in the cars. There had been a grand excursion to welcome the soldiers, and the stage would probably be very late. Susy and Prudy had the promise of sitting up till it got in, if Dotty Dimple was only willing. But Dotty said,--  \"O, no; you better go to bed when I go, Prudy, or you'll hear somebody scream.\"  \"Let's see,\" said Prudy. \"I've thought of something nice. Wouldn't you like to go to aunt Martha's, and stay all the afternoon and all night?\"  Dotty gave a little purr, like a happy kitten.  \"O, yes, if they'll let me drink choclid out o' that silver mug.\"  \"But who'll go with you?\" said Prudy. \"There, I know--Abby Grant! I'll go ask mother.\"  Prudy thought that she herself could not possibly be spared just now to walk as far as aunt Martha's.  Abby Grant, who was supposed to be a good child, was very glad to take charge of Dotty, and called for her at two o'clock.  Aunt Louise was in the kitchen, whipping cream. \"O, my suz,\" said Dotty, with shining eyes; \"mayn't I taste o' those bubbles 'fore I go?\"  Aunt Louise poured the foaming cream over some jellies, which stood in glasses.  \"You shall have some to-morrow,\" said she, pausing to kiss Dotty, her favorite niece. Then she led the two little girls into the dining-room, where the long table was already spread for Company. Dotty could hardly keep her hands off the nice things.  \"There,\" said aunt Louise, giving each of the children an orange, \"now you may go. Abby, be sure to take good care of Dotty. Don't trust her out of your sight one minute.--Hark! there's the door-b"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16390"],["title","Little Prudy's Dotty Dimple (#8)"],["body","ell. You may go out of the house by the back-door.\"  Then Miss Louise hastened from the dining-room, without looking back to see whether the children obeyed her or not. Dotty was, in general, prompt to do as she was bidden by older people; but just now both the children found it hard to leave that tempting table. They dared not taste the dainties, but Abby thought it could surely do no harm just to touch them. But when they had gone as far as that, Abby, who was a sly, half-taught child, grew bolder, and a sudden impulse seized her to pocket a few sweetmeats, if she could only do so without being seen by Dotty's keen eyes.  \"Come, Dotty Parling,\" said she, \"you just go ask somebody to brush your hair; it's all over your head.\"  Dotty sighed as she cast a last glance at the table, and then, without a word, went up stairs, unwilling to be seen by aunt Martha with her \"hair all over her head.\"  Then Abby's heart beat fast. She heard voices in the parlor, and knew that at any moment some one might enter the dining-room, and discover her. So making a hasty choice of two large pieces of jelly-cake, and half a dozen tarts, she swept out of the room just in time to escape meeting grandma Parlin.  Her pocket was stuffed quite full, and one end of a slice of cake peeped out, though she tried her best to press it down. But Abby had a hope that no one would notice it through her white apron.  As Dotty's hair was now in fine order, the two children set out on their walk. They had gone but a few steps when Zip came trotting along, with all speed, looking up in their faces as if to say, \"What have I done, that I can't go too?\"  \"Queer what made _him_ want to come,\" said Abby, tartly.  \"He loves his little sister,\" said Dotty, stroking his nose. \"He shall go, he shall; he's a darling.\"  The dog kept beside the children, and every now and then Abby secretly punched him with a stick, while Dotty was patting his head, and chatting with him.  It was a long way to aunt Martha's, and Abby, besides feeling guilty, and ashamed of herself, was also very anxious to eat the goodies which made such a bunch in her pocket. Zip seemed to know there was cake somewhere, and sniffed about in a way which made her rather nervous.  \"Here, let's creep under this fence,\" said she; \"what's the use to go 'round by the road? It's a great deal nearer to your aunt's house through the field.\"  \"There, child,\" cried she, when they were on the other side of the fence, \"now I want to go behind this clump of trees, to--to find a book I left here yesterday: but you mustn't come, Dotty.\"  \"What for can't I? Yes, I shall, Abby Grant; you shame yourself! I'm goin' every single where you go; so, now, you'll have to give up!\"  \"Dot Parling, you go right along with your doggie! I'll come in a minute.\"  Dotty thought a girl of Abby's age had no right to command her. She stamped her little foot, but it made no sound in the soft grass.  \"I isn't a-goin' to go long with my doggie, Abby Grant; 'cause--so there!\"  \"But you must. You know, Dot Parling,\" said Abby, more gently, \"your grandma expects you to do just what I tell you. I'm afraid, dear, you won't get any of that bubbled cream if you don't mind, nor any tarts.\"  The child queen began to think it was wisest to obey; but she did so with a very ill grace.  \"Well, Abby Grant, I will go long with my doggie; but it's cause I'm tired, and don't want to help you find your old book--so, there!\"  \"That's right. Dotty. Start quick--can't you?\"  Dotty took \"high ground\" at once. She looked Abby full in the face.  \"Do you like _yourself_, Abby Grant?\"  \"I don' know. Yes: why?\"  \"'Cause I shouldn't think you would! I 'spise you!\"  Having freed her mind, Dotty walked on with Zip, only turning back once, to exclaim,--  \"There, Abby, now you'll have to give up!\"  Abby, naughty girl, ate her cake in secret, staining her white apron with the jelly, while little Miss Dimple trudged on, thinking it very strange Abby should be so long finding that book.  Perhaps for the reason that she was rather out of sorts, and thinking about Abby rather than about the road, she missed her way, and soon found herself in a narrow lane she had never seen before.  Zip looked rather uneasy, but followed close by her side. Dotty walked on and on, till the track had faded quite away. This was not the road to aunt Martha's. Why didn't Abby come?  Dotty, too proud to cry, too angry to look back, wandered till she came to the edge of the Parlin woods. Here was a little creek, tumbling over some small gray rocks; the same \"creek\" where Horace had sometimes gone fishing.  \"True as you live,\" said Dotty to herself, \"here's a teenty-tonty river.\"  There was no way of crossing the creek, and the child felt as if she had come to the very end of the world. Her courage began to fail.  \"Dotty Dimple,\" said she, stamping her foot, \"don't you cry! If you do cry, Dotty Dimple, I'll shut you up in the closet.\"  But, in spite of these brave words, the unhappy child felt two or three tears raining down her cheeks. She now seated herself on the grass, and screamed for Abby.  \"When she comes,\" thought Dotty, \"I'll tell her she's 'shamed herself!\"  At first it seemed as if Abby were answering her; but the sound proved to be only the echo of Dotty's own voice. O, she might scream all the afternoon, and Abby wouldn't try to hear! O, dear; before anybody would come, a bear, or a wolf, or a whale might rush right out of the woods and eat her up! Then how Abby would cry! Abby's mother would whip her with a big stick, and say, \"there, now; what made you go behind the trees, and let that little Parlin girl lose herself, and get ate up! I don't think you're very polite, you naughty girl!\"--O, how everybody would cry!  But what was that little funny thing on the water? Forgetting her sudden fear of bears and whales, a fear which Abby herself had put into her little head, Dotty gazed at the \"funny thing.\" Could it be a little truly sailboat? Yes, it certainly was. How it got into the creek Dotty never stopped to think; the question was, how could she get it out?  She blew it with her breath, but it only floated farther away. She waited, hoping it would turn about, and come towards her. She threw sticks at it, but in vain. The boys, who had set it sailing had gone into the woods for raspberries, would have laughed to see her efforts. Presently she took off her hat, held it by one string, and flung it in, as if it had been a fishing-net. It was all of no use; the boat acted as if it were alive, and did not choose to be caught.  Dotty had forgotten all about Abby and the visit to aunt Martha's.  \"I know what I'll do,\" thought she, winking very fast. \"I'll catch that boat; I will!\"  When Dotty had made up her mind, she never stopped for trifles. She drew off her stockings and gaiters, and stepped into the creek. Boys waded in the water, why couldn't she? There was nothing to bite her! She wasn't afraid!  She had supposed the water would only cover her feet, but she found herself sadly mistaken. The creek was remarkably deep, and, more than that, the bottom was so soft that she sank down, down, at every step.  Poor child! It was hard enough to get lost; it was harder still to be drowned!  \"O, papa!\" she screamed; \"O, mamma! O, Prudy! can't you come? I don't want to drown, and not have _you_ drown, Prudy. Can't you come, somebody come!\"  But there were no human ears near enough to hear her piteous cries. She must have drowned--there is no doubt of it--if Zip had not been close at hand. The moment he saw her sinking, he gave a low bark and swam after her.  Before he could reach the unfortunate child the water was up to her waist, and she was wringing her little helpless hands, and saying, \"Now I lay me down to sleep!\"  Faithful old Zip lost not a moment, but seized her skirts and dragged her to the bank, laying her on the ground as tenderly as her own mother could have done.  Now you see why it is that God had put it into Zip's loving heart to \"want to come with his little sister.\"  Abner, who arrived a few minutes later, in order to cut some young birches for his fence, said,--  \"Wasn't it lucky, that that dog _happened_ to be right on the spot? And lucky, too, that I _happened_ along in the nick of time, to carry the poor little girl home in my arms?\"  But the truth is, in this world which our Heavenly Father watches over, nothing ever comes by chance, and events do not _happen_.  Abby shed many bitter tears, but they were not so much tears of sorrow for her sin, as of shame for being found out. Such weeping does no good. Indeed I am afraid it only hardened Abby's heart.  But the day ended gloriously for Dotty. She was handed about to be kissed by everybody, and was, after all, allowed to sit up till nine o'clock, and actually ate a \"bubbled cream,\" sitting as close as she could beside Colonel Allen's elbow.     CHAPTER X.  DR. PRUDY.   The next day Dotty had a severe cold, and her mother, fearing the croup, did not allow her to go out of doors. This was hard for the child. She felt very restless, because she had to give up \"housekeeping\" with Prudy, a very fascinating game, which could only be played on the river-bank. She looked out of the kitchen window, and saw some carpenters shingling the barn.  \"O, hum!\" she murmured, \"I wish grandpa wouldn't mend his barn!\"  A white mist was creeping slowly over the river and the distant hills.  \"There, now,\" she sighed, \"I wish the earth wouldn't _breave_ so hard!\"  Then she went into the parlor, like a little gray cloud.  \"O, dear; I don't like this house, 'cause it's got a top to it! Wish I was somewhere else!\"  \"Poor child,\" said Colonel Allen, who was seated on the sofa, looking out of the bay-window upon the garden; \"do you love home better than this beautiful spot?\"  \"No,\" replied the little one, shaking her head. \"I don't love my home, 'cause I live there; I don't love nothin'. O, hum, suz!\"  Then Dotty wandered into the nursery, and"]]]
