Manual training, that's my favorite study because it isn't a study at all. I made a bird-house, I did, in manual training, a dandy big one.\"  \"Bird-houses is a good thing to make,\" said the manual training teacher.  Pee-wee could not see his new acquaintance very well or the bundle which he carried. If the teacher had been after his junk he seemed to have been fortunate in finding it, for he had collected a considerable amount of booty. Indeed, he had but a minute before succeeded in disinterring the safe which had been in the principal's office, but here he had met with disappointment. He had, however, hit upon a microscope of some value from the equipment of the student laboratory and he had found a lady's handbag which he seemed to think worth keeping.  \"What are _you_ doing here?\" he asked of Pee-wee.     CHAPTER XIII  A FRIEND IN NEED   \"Do you want me to let you into a secret?\" Pee-wee said. \"I know where there's a stolen automobile. Maybe you'd like to help me take it back to its owner, hey? If you do you'll get an honourable mention in our troop-book. I was carried away in it by two thieves who didn't know I was in the car, because I was disguised, sort of, under the buffalo robe. Do you want to help me foil them?\"  The manual training teacher seemed interested but a bit incredulous. He looked Pee-wee over and said, \"what's all this?\"  \"Maybe you don't believe me but it's true,\" Pee-wee said. \"Do you know how to run a car?\"  \"Anything from a flivver up,\" said the stranger.  \"Shh,\" said Pee-wee, \"this one is away, way up. It's a super six Hunkajunk, it belongs to a man where I live, in Bridgeboro, New Jersey.\"  \"Well, what are you doing here?\" the manual training teacher asked.  \"I was kind of kidnapped accidentally. They did it but they didn't know it. They've got pistols and blackjacks and things and I heard them talk about stealing. I bet I'd have heard a lot more only my head was under the buffalo robe. If you'll help me we can circum--what do you call it--you know--circum--\"  The teacher did not know. But his interest was aroused at this whispered tale of armed bandits and of a big stolen car. Pee-wee completed the tale in breathless excitement. He told all, from the beginning. \"They locked it in,\" he concluded, \"and went away; but one of the doors, the big one, was locked on the inside and I opened it. Anybody can take the car out. Those men have gone away across the lake. If you'll drive it to Bridgeboro you can stay at my house and have breakfast and I'll tell Mr. Bartlett that you helped me, and gee whiz, they'll thank you a lot. Maybe you know about scouts because manual training teachers know a lot about scouts on account of scouts making bird-houses and all things like that, and so maybe you know about good turns. That'll be a peach of a good turn. And if I tell about it you'll get a kind of a medal from our troop with your name on it. What's your name? Mine's Walter Harris, but the fellows in my troop call me Pee-wee, but I should worry about them. Will you help me? What's your name?\"  \"Mr. Swiper,\" said the stranger, rather thoughtfully; \"let's go and look it over.\"  He was certainly considering the proposition and Pee-wee accompanied him back to the lake, keeping up a running fire of enthusiastic encouragement and representing to him the delight and self-satisfaction of circumventing a pair of scoundrels. \"They've got pistols and everything,\" he said as a clincher, \"and if they'd steal a car they'd kill somebody, wouldn't they?\"  \"Seventy pistols is a good many,\" said Mr. Swiper, incredulously.  \"Sure it is,\" said Pee-wee excitedly; \"it's more than Jesse James had. I guess they belong to a big band of thieves, hey? Maybe they've got a--a--a haunt on the other side of that lake, hey? Now you can see it's good to go to the movies, hey? Because we could never circum--foil them if I hadn't, hey? They drove it right away from in front of the theater. Anyway,\" he added excitedly as he trotted along, \"I'm glad I met you because now I don't have to wake up the police or anything, hey? And I bet Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett will be surprised when they see us bringing it back, won't they? I'll show you where we have our meetings.\"  Mr. Swiper was not carried off his feet by Pee-wee's excited talk. He was thoughtful and preoccupied.  \"That's one thing I have no use for--thieves,\" Pee-wee said. \"Gee whiz, I never took a ride with thieves before. But anyway it's going to be all right now. We'll just toot the horn in front of the house when we get there, hey? And I'll say--I'll say--'Here's your car Mr. Bartlett.' And then I'll introduce you to him, hey? And I bet he'll--anyway, you wouldn't take anything, would you? Money or anything like that?\"  \"Don't insult me,\" said Mr. Swiper.  \"I didn't mean it,\" Pee-wee said apologetically; \"scouts are like that, they won't take anything for a service, but eats don't count, you can take eats. But I mean money----\"  \"Don't speak of money again,\" said Mr. Swiper.     CHAPTER XIV  SAVED!   Thanks to Pee-wee, the door of the rustic lakeside garage stood invitingly open.  \"I won't--I won't say anything about money; gee whiz, you needn't have any fear,\" Pee-wee said, making a play for his companion's good-will; \"gee, I wouldn't do that--I wouldn't. But you could take a medal, couldn't you? A scout good-will medal?\" he added anxiously.  \"Maybe,\" said Mr. Swiper.  \"Gee, you'll _have_ to take it,\" said Pee-wee; \"our scoutmaster will make you.\"  Before entering the building, Mr. Swiper made an inspection of the lonely neighborhood, and looked out across the still, dark lake.  \"That's where they went?\" he asked.  \"Sure, they won't see us,\" Pee-wee said reassuringly.  But the manual training teacher was not going to take any chances with a crew of ruffians--not he.  \"Even if they should see us or hear us,\" Pee-wee encouraged, \"they wouldn't dare come after it, because it isn't theirs. They thought nobody would ever find it in here. It's good I was on the inside, hey?\"  \"That's the place to be,\" said Mr. Swiper.  \"You bet it is,\" said Pee-wee. \"Were you ever locked in a place?\"  To this purely personal question, Mr. Swiper made no reply. Instead he walked about the car thoughtfully, then climbed into the front seat and turned on the dash-light. He seemed to know what he was doing. Pee-wee did not wait but excitedly climbed in beside him.  \"Gee whiz, a feller's got to have nerve to steal a car, hasn't he?\" he asked, unable in his elation to keep still.  \"That's what,\" said Mr. Swiper briefly.  \"It--it kind of--sort of--makes us feel like thieves, taking it,\" Pee-wee commented, looking about him rather fearfully, \"but anyway we've got a right to, that's one sure thing.... Haven't we?\"  \"Sure.\"  \"And it's all right, that's one sure thing. Oh boy, I'm glad I met you and you'll get as much credit as I do, that's sure. Anyway, we've got a right to take it away from the thieves, I hope. Gee, nobody can deny that. Anyway, I guess _you_ don't feel scary.\"  \"Guess they won't follow us,\" said Mr. Swiper. \"Not if they know what's well for them. Thieves don't come after you, they run away from you.\"  \"You bet they do,\" said Pee-wee, delighted at his new friend's rather generous contribution to the talk.  The engine now purred softly, the silent shifting into reverse gear told the young rescuer that a practiced hand was at the wheel. Slowly the big car backed out of the building and around till it headed into the dark over-grown road.  \"You didn't put the lights on,\" Pee-wee said.  \"Time enough for that,\" said his companion, who seemed quite accustomed to driving in the dark.  Presently the big super six Hunkajunk touring model was rolling silently along through the woods, rescued, saved! Soon to be restored to its rightful owner by W. Harris, scout, B.S.A.  By the dash-light, Pee-wee obtained a first glimpse of his companion's face. There was nothing in particular about him, save a long, diagonal scar on his face which Pee-wee thought might have been caused by some tool in the ruined manual training room. The young man had also very short hair; it was so short, in fact, that it seemed almost like no hair at all. It was like a convict's hair.     CHAPTER XV  IN CAMP   The light which Pee-wee had seen across the water was not on a boat as he had supposed. It was on a small island the very name of which would have delighted his heart, for it was called Frying-pan Island, because of its rough similarity of form to that delightful accessory of camp life. If Scout Harris could have eaten a waffle out of such a frying-pan he would have felt that he had not lived in vain.  This frying-pan, instead of being filled with fat, was filled with woods, and a little to the west of the center, where an omelet might have nestled in its smaller prototype, three tents were concealed in the enshrouding foliage. Down at the end of the handle of this frying-pan was good fishing, but it was marshy there, and sometimes after a heavy rain the handle was completely sub-merged. From an airplane the three white tents in the western side of the pan might have seemed like three enormous poached eggs; that is, provided the aviator had an imagination.  It was upon the shore of this little island that the two young men who had driven the automobile from Bridgeboro pulled their boat ashore about ten minutes after they had all unknowingly locked Scout Harris in their makeshift lakeside garage. Considering that they were cut-throats and ruffians and all that sort of thing, their consciences seemed singularly clear, for they laughed and chatted as they made their way along the few yards of trail which led to their lair, or den, or haunt, or cave, or whatever you care to call it.  They were greeted by a chorus of boys who jumped up from around the camp-fire where they had been "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15750"],["title","Pee-wee Harris on the Trail (#6)"],["body","making demands upon them for news and booty.  \"How about it? Can we stay here?\"  \"What kept you so long?\"  \"Did you get the silver cup?\"  \"I bet you didn't find out?\"  \"I bet you ate supper in a restaurant.\"  \"We made rice cakes.\"  \"Did you get the cup?\"  \"Let's see it.\"  \"They didn't get it\"  \"Yes they did.\"  \"I bet they didn't.\"  \"I bet they did.\"  \"Look at the smiles on their faces.\"  \"I bet we have the town hall wished on us.\"  \"I bet it's the fire-house.\"  \"I feel it in my bones we have to go to school.\"  \"Let's see the cup.\"  \"Did you eat?\"  \"What is this, a questionnaire?\" asked one of the arrivals, the one who had driven the car.  \"Let's hear the worst.\"  \"Break it gently.\"  \"We thought your new junk wagon broke down.\"  \"Don't say anything against his new junk Wagon or he'll never tell us anything.\"  \"Did you put the baby to bed?\"  \"Yes and locked him in.\"  \"What kept you so late?\"  \"We got mixed up with a Bandit of Harrowing Highway.\"  \"Who's he?\"  \"He's a villyan.\"  \"A which?\"  \"A movie play.\"  \"That's a nice thing for two scoutmasters to go and see. Your two troops are ashamed of you.\"  \"If our two troops don't shut up--\"  \"We'll shut up--come on, _altogether_!\"  Followed a welcome silence.  \"We've gone to a lot of trouble today for you kids,\" said one of the scoutmasters. \"We've got the cup but we had to wait a couple of hours for it. The merchants in the great metropolis of Bridgeboro are so slow that a turtle would be arrested for speeding there. Poke up the fire, Nick, we're cold, and I'll tell you all about our adventures. We've made a day of it, huh?\"  The scout whom he called Nick jogged up the waning blaze while others brought a fresh log, and soon the camp-fire was roaring a warming, hearty welcome home to the weary scoutmasters. One of these (who was evidently young enough to be addressed by his Christian name, for they called him Ned) sat on an old grocery box and related the happenings of the day, while the others sprawled about, listening. Occasionally his fellow scoutmaster (Safety First they called him) contributed a few words.  \"Well, the first thing we did when we got ashore was to--\"  \"Get out of the boat?\" a scout asked. There was surely not much constraint between scouts and scoutmasters in this outfit.  \"We went up to town and saw the school board; at least we saw Mr. Cram. He says everything's upside down and they don't know what they'll do--says there won't be any school for a month anyway. (Cries of despair.) They can't use the town hall and they can't use the fire-house and they're talking of using the old Wilder mansion. We told him if there wasn't going to be any school till the middle of October or so, we'd like to bunk right here on the island and study nature. He said, 'Go to it.' So there's no school for a month (murmurs of disappointment) and we've got to chip in and get some more groceries.  \"We squared things with your parents and most of them are glad to get rid of you. How about that, Safety First? Corby's sister is giving a party and hopes he'll stay away. Let's see now; oh yes, we bought some fishing tackle.  \"Then we got some gas and started for Bridgeboro after the cup. We went after that cup like Sir Thomas Lipton. The jewelry man didn't have the engraving finished so we dropped in at a movie show and saw a fellow with a lot of pistols. How many pistols were there, First Aid? We counted them off coming back in the machine, there were seventy. Crazy stuff. That's the kind of stuff you kids fall for. Well, after the pistol shooting was over we got the cup and started back and here we are. Any questions?\"  \"Let's see the cup.\"  We left it in the machine. We'll get it in the morning. Now look here, you scouts. I want every last one of you to try for that cup. There are half a dozen of you that need to wake up. There are a few dead ones here; Harry, the crack shot--yes you--I'm looking right at you--I want you to can all this stuff about killing animals and get busy and do the best scout stunt of the season and win that cup. Understand? I was saying to Safety First on the way home that a fellow gets more fun stealing up on an animal and piking him with a camera than he does poking around with an old air gun that he saw advertised in _Boy's Life_. That's what! I'm talking to you straight.  \"Now here's a silver cup and it looks pretty swell all engraved with our patrol names and we drove way to Bridgeboro to get it. That cup's going to stand on the stump of that tree there--where the chipmunk hangs out. And the day we leave this island it's going to the scout that has done the best scout stunt. Tracking, signalling, good turn, cooking, it makes no difference what. The scout that does the _biggest thing_, he gets the cup. We two scoutmasters and Mr. Wade are going to be the committee. Now you'd better all turn in and hurry up about it, and Ralph Gordon is not to snore; they're complaining about it over in town.\"  \"Can we do any kind of stunts we want to?\" asked the tall scout whom they call Nick.  \"Any kind at all that's good scouting; that's the only rule.\"  \"All right, then I'm going to start to-night,\" said Nick; \"I'm going to row across and get that cup out of the car so we all can see it. Let's have the key, will you?\"  At this there was a general laugh mingled with shouts from a dozen or so volunteers:  \"I'll go with you!\"  \"Take me?\"  \"I'm in on that!\"  \"I was just going to suggest it!\"  \"Yes you were--not!\"  \"Wait till morning,\" said Scoutmaster Ned.  \"It can't be done,\" said Nick in a funny, sober way; \"a scout is supposed to have his sleep, that's the most important rule of all, you said so yourself. I can't sleep till I've had a squint at that cup. Come on Fido, let's row over.\"  The scout called Fido had won his name because of his doglike persistence in following trails. \"That's me,\" he said, \"I was just going to propose it when you took the words out of my mouth.\"  \"I'd like to see a photograph of anybody taking anything out of _your_ mouth,\" said Scoutmaster Ned. \"Go ahead, the two of you; I wish your people would send you both to a private school that opens up to-morrow. Go on, get out of here. And don't wake us up when you come back.\"  \"Thank you kindly,\" said Fido.  \"The pleasure is mine,\" said Scoutmaster Ned.     CHAPTER XVI  FOOTPRINTS   So this, then, was the explanation of the bloodthirsty talk which the mighty hero of the Bridgeboro troop had heard under the buffalo robe as he emerged from the sweet realm of slumber in the automobile.  Pistols, killing, stealing and dead ones! To steal up to a bird and _not_ kill it! To wake up if you are a dead one! To laugh with wholesome scout humor at the silly gun play of the screen! To count the pistols in William I. Smart's five reel thriller!  Alas, Scout Harris!  But we are not to accompany that redoubtable rescuer in his thrilling flight. We are going to row across the lake in which the dying camp-fire on the little island cast a golden flicker, into which the oars held by our new acquaintance, Nick Vernon, dipped silently and rose dripping as his practiced arms drew the boat through the water, causing a musical little ripple at its bow.  \"Got the key?\" Fido asked.  \"Do you suppose I'd come away without it?\"  \"Pull a little on your left. I can just make out the shed. There isn't,--yes there is, there's just one light in the town.\"  \"That's Algernon Kirkendall studying his algebra,\" said Nick.  \"It's just in line with the shed. Row straight for the light and we'll hit the shore just right. I'll lift this seat and steer with it. Crinkums, it's dark on the water, isn't it?\"  So the algebra was of some use in the world after all; Algernon Kirkendall was a scout without knowing it.  \"S.N.[1] thinks more of that new car than he does of the troop,\" said Fido.  \"Sure, the car don't give him as much trouble,\" said Nick. \"We're a Hunkajunk troop and Safety First's troop is a Ford troop; it's small but it makes a lot of noise. If I ever start a troop it will be air-cooled. How about it, am I headed right?\"  [Footnote 1: Scoutmaster Ned he meant.]  \"Row straight ahead, I'll steer.\"  \"Golly, the water's black. Look! Did you see that fish jump? Look around, the camp-fire looks good from here. Believe me, the autumn is the time to camp. We're in luck. I love, I love, I love my lessons, but oh you little island!\"  \"Ditto.\"  \"We're set till Columbus Day.\"  \"You mean Election Day. Gee, your oar touched bottom, here we are. I'll row back.\"  They pulled the boat up and started for the shack. Fido reached it first and called excitedly, \"It's open! The car's gone!\"  \"Stop your fooling,\" called Nick.  \"I'm not fooling, come and look for yourself, hurry up, the car's gone.\"  They stood in the big open doorway in gaping amazement. They walked in, too dumfounded to speak, and when they did speak their voices sounded strange to each other within the dark, empty confines of those old dried board walls.  \"Somebody must have broken in through the small door,\" said Fido.  \"It's closed and locked,\" said his companion. \"How about the fastening on the big one?\"  \"It's all O.K.; nobody's been breaking in, that's sure.\"  \"You don't mean to tell me S.N. would lock the small door and then come away leaving the big one open, do you?\" Nick asked incredulously.  \"Well, what then?\" his comrade retorted with greater incredulity. \"If both doors were closed and fastenings are all right now, could anybody get the car out? They left the big door open--that's what they did.\"  \"They never did that,\" said Nick; \"look here, here's a fresh finger print on the door--you can smell the oil on it. Here, wait till I light another match. S.N. did what he always does, he opened the hood and turned on the oil pet-cock and fussed around and then pulled the door shut. Someone must have been inside this place before they got back.\"  Fido Norton was by this time on his knees outside the larger door. \"Here are footprints,\" said he; \"two, three,--here's"]]]
