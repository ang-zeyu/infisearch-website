In the life-histories of cicads and coccids, then, there are some features which recall those of the caterpillar's transformation into the butterfly. The newly-hatched insect is externally so unlike its parent that it may be styled a larva. The penultimate instar is quiescent and does not feed. But while the caterpillar shows throughout its life no outward trace of wings, external wing-rudiments are evident in the young stages of the cicad. In the male coccid we find a late larval stage with hidden wing-rudiments, the importance of which, for comparison with the caterpillar, will be appreciated later.     CHAPTER IV  FROM WATER TO AIR   Insects as a whole are preeminently creatures of the land and the air. This is shown not only by the possession of wings by a vast majority of the class, but by the mode of breathing to which reference has already been made (p. 2), a system of branching air-tubes carrying atmospheric air with its combustion-supporting oxygen to all the insect's tissues. The air gains access to these tubes through a number of paired air-holes or spiracles, arranged segmentally in series.  It is of great interest to find that, nevertheless, a number of insects spend much of their time under water. This is true of not a few in the perfect winged state, as for example aquatic beetles and water-bugs ('boatmen' and 'scorpions') which have some way of protecting their spiracles when submerged, and, possessing usually the power of flight, can pass on occasion from pond or stream to upper air. But it is advisable in connection with our present subject to dwell especially on some insects that remain continually under water till they are ready to undergo their final moult and attain the winged state, which they pass entirely in the air. The preparatory instars of such insects are aquatic; the adult instar is aerial. All may-flies, dragon-flies, and caddis-flies, many beetles and two-winged flies, and a few moths thus divide their life-story between the water and the air. For the present we confine attention to the Stone-flies, the May-flies, and the Dragon-flies, three well-known orders of insects respectively called by systematists the Plecoptera, the Ephemeroptera and the Odonata.  In the case of many insects that have aquatic larvae, the latter are provided with some arrangement for enabling them to reach atmospheric air through the surface-film of the water. But the larva of a stone-fly, a dragon-fly, or a may-fly is adapted more completely than these for aquatic life; it can, by means of gills of some kind, breathe the air dissolved in water.  The aquatic young of a stone-fly does not differ sufficiently in form from its parent to warrant us in calling it a larva; the life-history is like that of a cockroach, all the instars however except the final one--the winged adult or _imago_--live in the water. The young of one of our large species, a Perla for example, has well-chitinised cuticle, broad head, powerful legs, long feelers and cerci like those of the imago; its wings arise from external rudiments, which are conspicuous in the later aquatic stages. But it lives completely submerged, usually clinging or walking beneath the stones that lie in the bed of a clear stream, and examination of the ventral aspect of the thorax reveals six pairs of tufted gills, by means of which it is able to breathe the air dissolved in the water wherein it lives. At the base of the tail-feelers or cerci also, there are little tufts of thread-like gills as J.A. Palmén (1877) has shown. An insect that is continually submerged and has no contact with the upper air cannot breathe through a series of paired spiracles, and during the aquatic life-period of the stone-fly these remain closed. Nevertheless, breathing is carried on by means of the ordinary system of branching air-tubes, the trunks of which are in connection with the tufted hollow gill-filaments, through whose delicate cuticle gaseous exchange can take place, though the method of this exchange is as yet very imperfectly understood. When the stone-fly nymph is fully grown, it comes out of the water and climbs to some convenient eminence. The cuticle splits open along the back, and the imago, clothed in its new cuticle, as yet soft and flexible, creeps out. The spiracles are now open, and the stone-fly breathes atmospheric air like other flying insects. But throughout its winged life, the stone-fly bears memorials of its aquatic past in the little withered vestiges of gills that can still be distinguished beneath the thorax.  The adult dragon-fly (fig. 8 _d_) is specialised in such a way that it captures its prey--flies and other small insects--on the wing, swooping through the air like a hawk and feeding voraciously. The head is remarkable for its large globular compound eyes, its short bristle-like feelers, and its very strong mandibles which bite up the bodies of the victims. The thorax bears the two pairs of ample wings, firm and almost glassy in texture, and its segments are projected forward ventrally, so that all six legs, which are armed with rows of sharp, slender spines, can be held in front of the mouth, where they form an effective fly-trap. The abdomen is very long and usually narrow.  A female dragon-fly after a remarkable mode of pairing, the details of which are beside our present subject, drops her eggs in the water, or lays them on water-weeds, perhaps cutting an incision where they can be the more safely lodged, or even goes down below the surface and deposits them in the mud at the bottom of a pond. From the eggs are hatched the aquatic larvae which differ in many respects from the imago. The dragon-fly larva has the same predaceous mode of life as its parent, but it is sluggish in habit, lurking for its prey at the bottom of the pond, among the mud or vegetation, which it resembles in colour. The thoracic segments have not the specialisation that they show in the imago; the abdomen is relatively shorter and broader. The larval head has, like that of the imago, short feelers, and the eyes are somewhat large, though far from attaining the size of the great globular eyes of the dragon-fly. But the third pair of jaws, forming the labium, are most remarkably modified into a 'mask,' the distal central portion (mentum) being hinged to the basal piece (sub-mentum) which is itself jointed below the head. The mentum carries at its extremity a pair of lobes with sharp fangs. Thus the mask can be folded under the head when the larva lurks in its hiding place, or be suddenly darted out so as to secure any unwary small insect that may pass close enough for capture. Dragon-fly larvae walk, and also swim by movements of the abdomen or by expelling a jet of water from the hind-gut. The walls of this terminal region of the intestine have areas lined with delicate cuticle and traversed by numerous air-tubes, so that gaseous exchange can take place between the air in the tubes and that dissolved in the water. The larvae of the larger and heavier dragon-flies (Libellulidae and Aeschnidae) breathe mostly in this way. Those of the slender and delicate 'Demoiselles' (Agrionidae) are provided with three leaf-like gill-plates at the tail, between whose delicate surfaces numerous air-tubes ramify. These gill-plates are at times used for propulsion. Thus air supply is ensured during aquatic life. But occasionally, when the water in which the larva lives is foul and poor in oxygen, the tail is thrust out of the water so that air can be admitted directly into the intestinal chamber. The aquatic life of these insects lasts for more than a year, and F. Balfour-Browne (1909) has observed from ten to fourteen moults in Agrion. Outward wing-rudiments are early visible on the thoracic segments; when these have become conspicuous the insect, beginning in some respects to approach the adult condition, is often called a nymph. In an advanced dragon-fly nymph, H. Dewitz (1891) has shown that the thoracic spiracles are open, and, as the time for its final moult draws near, the insect may thrust the front part of its body out of the water, and breathe atmospheric air through these. Thus before the great change takes place the nymph has foretastes of the aerial mode of breathing which it will practise when the perfect stage shall have been attained. The emergence of the dragon-fly from its nymph-cuticle has been described by many naturalists from de Réaumur (1740) to L.C. Miall (1895) and O.H. Latter (1904). The nymph climbs out of the water by ascending some aquatic plant, and awaits the change so graphically sketched by Tennyson:      A hidden impulse rent the veil,     Of his old husk, from head to tail,     Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.  'From head to tail,' for the nymph-cuticle splits lengthwise down the back, and the head and thorax of the imago are freed from it (fig. 8 _a_), then the legs clasp the empty cuticle, and the abdomen is drawn out (fig. 8 _b, c_). After a short rest, the newly-emerged fly climbs yet higher up the water-weed, and remains for some hours with the abdomen bent concave dorsalwards (fig. 8 _d_), to allow space for the expansion and hardening of the wings. For some days after emergence the cuticle of the dragon-fly has a dull pale hue, as compared with the dark or brightly metallic aspect that characterises it when fully mature. The life of the imago endures but a short time compared with the long aquatic larval and nymphal stages. After some weeks, or at most a few months, the dragon-flies, having paired and laid their eggs, die before the approach of winter.  [Illustration: Fig. 8 _a, b_. Dragon-fly (_Aeschna cyanea_).

Dragon-fly (_Aeschna cyanea_) with expanded wings.]  The life-story of a may-fly follows the same general course as that just described for the dragon-flies, but there are some suggestive differences. In the first place, we notice a wider divergence between the imago and the larva. An adult may-fly is one of the most delicate of insects; the head has elaborate compound eyes, but the feelers are very short, and the jaws are reduced to such tiny vestiges that the insect is unable to feed. Its aquatic larva is fairly robust, with a large head which is provided with well-developed jaws, as the larval and nymphal stages extend over one or two years, and the insects browse on water-weeds or devour creatures smaller and weaker than themselves. They breathe dissolved air by means of thread-like or plate-like gills traversed by branching air-tubes, somewhat resembling those of the demoiselle dragon-fly larva. But in the may-fly larva, there is a series of these gills (fig. 9_b_) arranged laterally in pairs on the abdominal segments, and C. Börner (1909) has recently given reasons, from the position and muscular attachments of these organs, for believing that they show a true correspondence to (in technical phraseology are homologous with) the thoracic legs. One feature in which the larva often agrees with the imago is the possession on the terminal abdominal segment of a pair of long jointed cerci, and in many genera a median jointed tail-process (see fig. 9) is also present, in some cases both in the larva and the imago, in others in the larva during its later stages only. The prolonged larval life in may-flies often involves a large series of moults; Lubbock (1863) has enumerated twenty-one in the life-history of Chloeon. In the second year of aquatic life wing-rudiments (fig. 9 _a_) are visible, and the larva becomes a nymph. When the time for the winged condition approaches the nymphs leave the water in large swarms. The vivid accounts of these swarms given by Swammerdam (1675), de Réaumur (1742) and other old-time observers are available in summarised form for English readers in Miall's admirable book (1895). May-flies are eagerly sought as food by trout, and the rise of the fly on many lakes ushers in a welcome season to the angler.  The nymph-cuticle opens and the winged insect emerges. But this is not the final instar; may-flies are exceptional among insects in undergoing yet another moult after they have acquired wings which they can use for flight. The instar that emerges from the nymph-cuticle is a sub-imago, dull in hue, with a curious immature aspect about it. A few hours later the final moult takes place, a very delicate cuticle being shed and revealing the true imago. Then follow the dancing flight over the calm waters, the mating and egg-laying, the rapid death. The whole winged existence prepared for by the long aquatic life may be over in a single evening; at most it lasts but for a few days.  [Illustration: Fig. 9. Nymph of May-fly (_Chloeon dipterum_) showing on right side wing-rudiment (_a_), on left tracheal gills (_b_). Magnified 4 times. [Feelers and legs are cut short.] From Miall and Denny after Vayssière.]  In the development of the may-flies, then, we notice not only a considerable divergence between larva and imago, both in habitat and structure; we see also what is to be observed often in more highly organised insects--a feeding stage prolonged through the years of larval and nymphal life, while the winged imago takes no food and devotes its energies through its short existence to the task of reproduction. Such division of the life-history into a long feeding, and a short breeding period has, as will be seen later, an important bearing on the question of insect transformation generally, and the dragon-flies and may-flies afford examples of two stages in its specialisation. The sub-imaginal instar of the may-fly furnishes also a noteworthy fact for comparison with other insect histories. In two points, however, the life-story of these flies with their aquatic larvae recalls that of the cockroach. All the larval and nymphal instars are active, and the wing-rudiments are outwardly visible long before the final moult.     CHAPTER V  TRANSFORMATIONS,--OUTWARD AND INWARD   We are now in a position to study in some detail the transformation of those insects whose life-story corresponds more or less closely with that of the butterfly, sketched in the opening pages of this little book. In the case of some of the insects reviewed in the last three chapters, the may-flies and cicads for example, a marked difference between the larva and the imago has been noticed; in others, as the coccids, we find a resting instar before the winged condition is assumed, suggesting the pupal stage in the butterfly's life-story.  The various insect orders whose members exhibit no marked divergence between larva and imago (the Orthoptera for example) are often said to undergo no transformation, to be 'Ametabola.' Those with life-stories such as the dragon-flies' are said to undergo partial transformation, and are termed 'Hemimetabola.' Moths, caddis-flies, beetles, two-winged flies, saw-flies, ants, wasps, bees, and the great majority of insects, having the same type of life-story as the butterfly, are said to undergo complete transformation and are classed as 'Metabola' or 'Holometabola.' Wherein lies the fundamental difference between these Holometabola on the one hand and the Hemimetabola and Ametabola on the other? It is not that the larva differs from the imago or that there is a passive stage in the life-history; these conditions are observable among insects with a 'partial' transformation as we have seen, though the resting instar that simulates the butterfly pupa is certainly exceptional. It has been pointed out by Sharp (1899) that the most important indication of the difference between the two modes of development is furnished by the position of the wing-rudiments. In all Ametabola and Hemimetabola these are visible externally long before the penultimate instar has been reached; in the Holometabola they are not seen until the pupal stage.  Attention has already been drawn to the contrast in outward form between a butterfly and its caterpillar. As in the case of dragon-fly or may-fly, the larval period is essentially a time for feeding and growth, and during this period the larval cuticle is cast four or five, in some species even seven or eight times. After each moult some changes in detail may be observable, for example in the proportions of the body-segments or their outgrowths, in the colour or the closeness of the hairy or spiny armature. But in all main features the caterpillar retains throughout its life the characteristic form in which it left the egg. From the tiny, newly-hatched larva to the full-fed caterpillar, possibly several inches in length, there is all along the same crawling, somewhat worm-like body, destitute of any outward trace of wings. When however the last larval cuticle has split open lengthwise along the back, and has been worked off by vigorous wriggling motions of the insect, the pupa thus revealed shows the wing-rudiments conspicuous at the sides of the body, and lying neatly alongside these are to be seen the forms of feelers, legs, and maxillae of the imago prefigured in the cuticle of the pupa (fig. 1 _e_). The pupa thus resembles the imago much more closely than it resembles the larva; even in the proportions of the body a relative shortening is to be noticed, and the imago of any insect with complete transformation is reduced in length as compared with the full-fed larva. Now these wings and other structures characteristic of the imago, appear in the pupa which is revealed by the shedding of the last larval cuticle. From these facts we infer that the wing-rudiments must be present in the larva, hidden beneath the cuticle; and until the last larval instar, not beneath the cuticle only, but growing in such-wise that they are hidden by the epidermis. For if they were growing outwardly the new cuticle would be formed over them, so that they would be apparent after the next moult. But it is clear that only in the pupa, forming beneath the cuticle of the last larval instar, can they grow outwards.  Anatomical study of the caterpillar at various stages verifies the conclusions just drawn from superficial observation. A hundred and fifty years ago P. Lyonet in his monumental work (1762) on the caterpillar of the Goat Moth (Cossus) detected, in the second and third thoracic segments, four little white masses buried in the fat-body, and, while doubtful as to their real meaning, he suggested that their number and position might well give rise to the suspicion that they were rudiments of the wings of the moth. But it was a century later that A. Weismann in his classical studies (1864) on the development of common flies, showed the presence in the maggot of definite rudiments of wings, and other organs of the adult--rudiments to which he gave the name of _imaginal discs_. We will recur later to these transformations of the Diptera. For the present, we pursue our survey of changes in the life-history of the Lepidoptera and can take to guide us the excellent researches of J. Gonin (1894).  Careful study of the imaginal discs of the wings in a caterpillar (fig. 10) made by examining microscopically sections cut through them, shows that the epidermis is pushed in to form a little pouch (_C, p_) and that into this grows the actual wing-rudiment. Consequently the whitish disk which seems to lie within the body-wall of the larva, is really a double fold of the epidermis, the outer fold forming the pouch, the inner the actual wing-bud. Into the cavity of the latter pass branches from the air-tube system. In its earliest stage, the wing-bud is simply an ingrowing mass of cells (fig. 10 _A_) which subsequently becomes an inpushed pouch (_B_). Until the last stage of larval life the wing-bud"]]]
