Say three o'clock. The first to arrive will await the other before the steps of the Opera House?\"  John nodded assent and Lannes hurried away. Young Scott followed his figure with his eyes until it disappeared in the crowd. A back may be an index to a man's strength of mind, and he saw that Lannes, head erect and shoulders thrown back, was walking with a rapid and springy step. Courage was obviously there.  But John, despite his own strong heart, could not keep from feeling an infinite sadness and pity, not for Lannes, but for all the three million people who inhabited the City of Light, most of whom were fleeing now before the advance of the victorious invader. He could put himself in their place. France held his deepest sympathy. He felt that a great nation, sedulously minding its own business, trampled upon and robbed once before, was now about to be trampled upon and robbed again. He could not subscribe to the doctrine, that might was right.  He watched the fugitives a long time. They were crowding the railway stations, and they were departing by motor, by cart and on foot. Many of the poorer people, both men and women, carried packs on their backs. The boulevards and the streets were filled with the retreating masses.  It was an amazing and stupefying sight, the abandonment by its inhabitants of a great city, a city in many ways the first in the world, and it gave John a mighty shock. He had been there with his uncle and Mr. Anson in the spring, and he had seen nothing but peace and brightness. The sun had glittered then, as it glittered now over the Arc de Triomphe, the gleaming dome of the Invalides and the golden waters of the Seine. It was Paris, soft, beautiful and bright, the Paris that wished no harm to anybody.  But the people were going. He could see them going everywhere. The cruel, ancient times when cities were destroyed or enslaved by the conqueror had come back, and the great Paris that the world had known so long might become lost forever.  The stream of fugitives, rich and poor, mingled, poured on without ceasing. He did not know where they were going. Most of them did not know themselves. He saw a great motor, filled high with people and goods, break down in the streets, and he watched them while they worked desperately to restore the mechanism. And yet there was no panic. The sound of voices was not high. The Republic was justifying itself once more. Silent and somberly defiant, the inhabitants were leaving Paris before the giant German guns could rain shells upon the unarmed.  It was three or four hours until the time to meet Lannes, and drawn by an overwhelming curiosity and anxiety he began the climb of the Butte Montmartre. If observers on the Eiffel Tower could see the German forces approaching, then with the powerful glasses he carried over his shoulder he might discern them from the dome of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart.  As he made his way up the ascent through the crooked and narrow little streets he saw many eyes, mostly black and quick, watching him. This by night was old Paris, dark and dangerous, where the Apache dwelled, and by day in a fleeing city, with none to restrain, he might be no less ruthless.  But John felt only friendliness for them all. He believed that common danger would knit all Frenchmen together, and he nodded and smiled at the watchers. More than one pretty Parisian, not of the upper classes, smiled back at the American with the frank and open face.  Before he reached the Basilica a little rat of a young man stepped before him and asked:  \"Which way, Monsieur?\"  He was three or four years older than John, wearing uncommonly tight fitting clothes of blue, a red cap with a tassel, and he was about five feet four inches tall. But small as he was he seemed to be made of steel, and he stood, poised on his little feet, ready to spring like a leopard when he chose.  The blue eyes of the tall American looked steadily into the black eyes of the short Frenchman, and the black eyes looked back as steadily. John was fast learning to read the hearts and minds of men through their eyes, and what he saw in the dark depths pleased him. Here were cunning and yet courage; impudence and yet truth; caprice and yet honor. Apache or not, he decided to like him.  \"I'm going up into the lantern of the Basilica,\" he said, \"to see if I can see the Germans, who are my enemies as well as yours.\"  \"And will not Monsieur take me, too, and let me have look for look with him through those glasses at the Germans, some of whom I'm going to shoot?\"  John smiled.  \"If you're going out potting Germans,\" he said, \"you'd better get yourself into a uniform as soon as you can. They have no mercy on _franc tireurs_.\"  \"I'll chance that. But you'll take me with you into the dome?\"  \"What's your name?\"  \"Pierre Louis Bougainville.\"  \"Bougainville! Bougainville! It sounds noble and also historical. I've read of it, but I don't recall where.\"  The little Frenchman drew himself up, and his black eyes glittered.  \"There is a legend among us that it was noble once,\" he said, \"but we don't know when. I feel within me the spirit to make it great again. There was a time when the mighty Napoleon said that every soldier carried a marshal's baton in his knapsack. Perhaps that time has come again. And the great emperor was a little man like me.\"  John began to laugh and then he stopped suddenly. Pierre Louis Bougainville, so small and so insignificant, was not looking at him. He was looking over and beyond him, dreaming perhaps of a glittering future. The funny little red cap with the tassel might shelter a great brain. Respect took the place of the wish to laugh.  \"Monsieur Bougainville,\" he said in his excellent French, \"my name is John Scott. I am from America, but I am serving in the allied Franco-British army. My heart like yours beats for France.\"  \"Then, Monsieur Jean, you and I are brothers,\" said the little man, his eyes still gleaming. \"It may be that we shall fight side by side in the hour of victory. But you will take me into the lantern will you not? Father Pelletier does not know, as you do, that I'm going to be a great man, and he will not admit me.\"  \"If I secure entrance you will, too. Come.\"  They reached side by side the Basilique de Sacré-Coeur, which crowns the summit of the Butte Montmartre, and bought tickets from the porter, whose calm the proximity of untold Germans did not disturb. John saw the little Apache make the sign of the cross and bear himself with dignity. In some curious way Bougainville impressed him once more with a sense of power. Perhaps there was a spark of genius under the red cap. He knew from his reading that there was no rule about genius. It passed kings by, and chose the child of a peasant in a hovel.  \"You're what they call an Apache, are you not?\" he asked.  \"Yes, Monsieur.\"  \"Well, for the present, that is until you win a greater name, I'm going to call you Geronimo.\"  \"And why Zhay-ro-nee-mo, Monsieur?\"  \"Because that was the name of a great Apache chief. According to our white standards he was not all that a man should be. He had perhaps a certain insensibility to the sufferings of others, but in the Apache view that was not a fault. He was wholly great to them.\"  \"Very well then, Monsieur Scott, I shall be flattered to be called Zhay-ro-nee-mo, until I win a name yet greater.\"  \"Where is the Father Pelletier, the priest, who you said would bar your way unless I came with you?\"  \"He is on the second platform where you look out over Paris before going into the lantern. It may be that he has against me what you would call the prejudice. I am young. Youth must have its day, and I have done some small deeds in the quarter which perhaps do not please Father Pelletier, a strict, a very strict man. But our country is in danger, and I am willing to forgive and forget.\"  He spoke with so much magnanimity that John was compelled to laugh. Geronimo laughed, too, showing splendid white teeth. The understanding between them was now perfect.  \"I must talk with Father Pelletier,\" said John. \"Until you're a great man, as you're going to be, Geronimo, I suppose I can be spokesman. After that it will be your part to befriend me.\"  On the second platform they found Father Pelletier, a tall young priest with a fine but severe face, who looked with curiosity at John, and with disapproval at the Apache.  \"You are Father Pelletier, I believe,\" said John with his disarming smile. \"These are unusual times, but I wish to go up into the lantern. I am an American, though, as you can see by my uniform, I am a soldier of France.\"  \"But your companion, sir? He has a bad reputation in the quarter. When he should come to the church he does not, and now when he should not he does.\"  \"That reputation of which you speak, Father Pelletier, will soon pass. Another, better and greater will take its place. Our friend here, and perhaps both of us will be proud to call him so some day, leaves soon to fight for France.\"  The priest looked again at Bougainville, and his face softened. The little Apache met his glance with a firm and open gaze, and his figure seemed to swell again, and to radiate strength. Perhaps the priest saw in his eyes the same spark that John had noticed there.  \"It is a time when France needs all of her sons,\" he said, \"and even those who have not deserved well of her before may do great deeds for her now. You can pass.\"  Bougainville walked close to Father Pelletier, and John heard him say in low tones:  \"I feel within me the power to achieve, and when you see me again you will recognize it.\"  The priest nodded and his friendly hand lay for a moment on the other's shoulder.  \"Come on, Geronimo,\" said John cheerfully. \"As I remember it's nearly a hundred steps into the lantern, and that's quite a climb.\"  \"Not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15760"],["title","The Forest of Swords: A Story of Paris and the Marne (#2)"],["body","youth like ours,\" exclaimed Bougainville, and he ran upward so lightly that the American had some difficulty in following him. John was impressed once more by his extraordinary strength and agility, despite his smallness. He seemed to be a mass of highly wrought steel spring. But unwilling to be beaten by anybody, John raced with him and the two stood at the same time upon the utmost crest of the Basilique du Sacré-Coeur.  They paused a few moments for fresh breath and then John put the glasses to his eye, sweeping them in a slow curve. Through the powerful lenses he saw the vast circle of Paris, and all the long story of the past that it called up. Two thousand years of history rolled beneath his feet, and the spectacle was wholly magnificent.  He beheld the great green valley with its hills, green, too, the line of the Seine cutting the city apart like the flash of a sword blade, the golden dome of the Hotel des Invalides, the grinning gargoyles of Notre Dame, the arches and statues and fountains and the long green ribbons that marked the boulevards.  Although the city stood wholly in the sunlight a light haze formed on the rim of the circling horizon. He now moved the glasses slowly over a segment there and sought diligently for something. From so high a point and with such strong aid one could see many miles. He was sure that he would find what he sought and yet did not wish to see. Presently he picked out intermittent flashes which he believed were made by sunlight falling on steel. Then he drew a long and deep breath that was almost like a sigh.  \"What is it?\" asked Bougainville who had stood patiently by his side.  \"I fear it is the glitter of lances, my friend, lances carried by German Uhlans. Will you look?\"  Bougainville held out his hands eagerly for the glasses, and then drew them back a little. In his new dignity he would not show sudden emotion.  \"It will give me gladness to see,\" he said. \"I do not fear the Prussian lances.\"  John handed him the glasses and he looked long and intently, at times sweeping them slowly back and forth, but gazing chiefly at the point under the horizon that had drawn his companion's attention.  John meanwhile looked down at the city glittering in the sun, but from which its people were fleeing, as if its last day had come. It still seemed impossible that Europe should be wrapped in so great a war and that the German host should be at the gates of Paris.  His eyes turned back toward the point where he had seen the gleam of the lances and he fancied now that he heard the far throb of the German guns. The huge howitzers like the one Lannes and he had blown up might soon be throwing shells a ton or more in weight from a range of a dozen miles into the very heart of the French capital. An acute depression seized him. He had strengthened the heart of Lannes, and now his own heart needed strengthening. How was it possible to stop the German army which had come so far and so fast that its Uhlans could already see Paris? The unprepared French had been defeated already, and the slow English, arriving to find France under the iron heel, must go back and defend their own island.  \"The Germans are there. I have not a doubt of it, and I thank you, Monsieur Scott, for the use of these,\" said Bougainville, handing the glasses back to him.  \"Well, Geronimo,\" he said, \"having seen, what do you say?\"  \"The sight is unpleasant, but it is not hopeless. They call us decadent. I read, Monsieur Scott, more than you think! Ah, it has been the bitterness of death for Frenchmen to hear all the world say we are a dying race, and it has been said so often that some of us ourselves had begun to believe it! But it is not so! I tell you it is not so, and we'll soon prove to the Germans who come that it isn't! I have looked for a sign. I sought for it in all the skies through your glasses, but I did not find it there. Yet I have found it.\"  \"Where?\"  \"In my heart. Every beat tells me that this Paris of ours is not for the Germans. We will yet turn them back!\"  He reminded John of Lannes in his dramatic intensity, real and not affected, a true part of his nature. Its effect, too, upon the American was powerful. He had given courage to Lannes, and now Bougainville, that little Apache of the Butte Montmartre, was giving new strength to his own weakening heart. Fresh life flowed back into his veins and he remembered that he, too, had beheld a sign, the flash of light on the Arc de Triomphe.  \"I think we have seen enough here, Geronimo,\" he said lightly, \"and we'll descend. I've a friend to meet later. Which way do you go from the church?\"  \"To the army. I shall be in a uniform tonight, and tomorrow maybe I shall meet the Germans.\"  John held out his hand and the Apache seized it in a firm clasp.  \"I believe in you, as I hope you believe in me,\" said young Scott. \"I belong to a company called the Strangers, made up chiefly of Americans and English, and commanded by Captain Daniel Colton. If you're on the battle line and hear of the Strangers there too I should like for you to hunt me up if you can. I'd do the same for you, but I don't yet know to what force you will belong.\"  Bougainville promised and they walked down to the second platform, where Father Pelletier was still standing.  \"What did you see?\" he asked of John, unable to hide the eagerness in his eyes.  \"Uhlans, Father Pelletier, and I fancied that I heard the echo of a German forty-two centimeter. Would you care to use the glasses? The view from this floor is almost as good as it is from the lantern.\"  John distinctly saw the priest shudder.  \"No,\" he replied. \"I could not bear it. I shall pray today that our enemies may be confounded; tomorrow I shall throw off the gown of a priest and put on the coat of a soldier.\"  \"Another sign,\" said John to himself, as they continued the descent. \"Even the priests will fight.\"  When they were once more in the narrow streets of Montmartre, John said farewell to Bougainville.  \"Geronimo,\" he said, \"I expect to see you leading a victorious charge directly into the heart of the German army.\"  \"If I can meet your hopes I will, Monsieur Scott,\" said the young Frenchman gayly, \"and now, _au revoir_, I depart for my uniform and arms, which must be of the best.\"  John smiled as he walked down the hill. His heart had warmed toward the little Apache who might not be any Apache at all. Nevertheless the name Geronimo seemed to suit him, and he meant to think of him by it until his valor won him a better.  He saw from the slopes the same endless stream of people leaving Paris. They knew that the Germans were near, and report brought them yet nearer. The tale of the monster guns had traveled fast, and the shells might be falling among them at any moment. Aeroplanes dotted the skies, but they paid little attention to them. They still thought of war under the old conditions, and to the great mass of the people flying machines were mere toys.  But John knew better. Those journeys of his with Lannes through the heavens and their battles in the air for their lives were unforgettable. Stopping on the last slope of Montmartre he studied space with his glasses. He was sure that he saw captive balloons on the horizon where the German army lay, and one shape larger than the rest looked like a Zeppelin, but he did not believe those monsters had come so far to the south and west. They must have an available base.  His heart suddenly increased its beat. He saw a darting figure and he recognized the shape of the German Taube. Then something black shot downward from it, and there was a crash in the streets of Paris, followed by terrible cries.  He knew what had happened. He caught another glimpse of the Taube rushing away like a huge carnivorous bird that had already seized its prey, and then he ran swiftly down the street. The bomb had burst in a swarm of fugitives and a woman was killed. Several people were wounded, and a panic had threatened, but the soldiers had restored order already and ambulances soon took the wounded to hospitals.  John went on, shocked to the core. It was a new kind of war. The flying men might rain death from the air upon a helpless city, but their victims were more likely to be women and children than armed men. For the first time the clean blue sky became a sinister blanket from which dropped destruction.  The confusion created by the bomb soon disappeared. The multitude of Parisians still poured from the city, and long lines of soldiers took their place. John wondered what the French commanders would do. Surely theirs was a desperate problem. Would they try to defend Paris, or would they let it go rather than risk its destruction by bombardment? Yet its fall was bound to be a terrible blow.  Lannes was on the steps of the Opera House at the appointed time, coming with a brisk manner and a cheerful face.  \"I want you to go with me to our house beyond the Seine,\" he said. \"It is a quaint old place hidden away, as so many happy homes are in this city. You will find nobody there but my mother, my sister Julie, and a faithful old servant, Antoine Picard, and his daughter, Suzanne.\"  \"But I will be a trespasser?\"  \"Not at all. There will be a warm welcome for you. I have told them of you, how you were my comrade in the air, and how you fought.\"  \"Pshaw, Lannes, it was you who did most of the fighting. You've given me a reputation that I can't carry.\"  \"Never mind about the reputation. What have you been doing since I left you this morning?\"  \"I spent a part of the time in the lantern of the Basilica on Montmartre, and I had with me a most interesting friend.\"  Lannes looked at him curiously.  \"You did not speak of any friend in Paris at this time,\" he said.  \"I didn't because I never heard of him until a few hours ago. I made his acquaintance while I was going up Montmartre, but I already consider him, next to you, the best friend I have in France.\"  \"Acquaintanceship seems to grow rapidly with you,"]]]
