To-morrow we shall select the officers, fifteen in number, who are to occupy the after cabin.\"  This announcement created a decided sensation among the eighty-seven boys gathered in the waist, for the subject had been full of interest to them. The after cabin had thus far been a sealed book; the door was locked, and they had not even seen the inside of the apartment. They were curious to visit this cabin, and to know who were to occupy it.  \"After the organization of the school, it is my intention to give these offices to those who obtain the highest number of merit marks, which will be given for good conduct, good lessons, and progress in seamanship. The best boy, who is at the same time the best scholar and the best seaman, shall be captain. We have no marks now by which to make the selection, and I intend to have you elect him the first time, reserving to myself the right to veto your choice if it is obviously an improper one.\"  As Mr. Lowington uttered this last remark, he glanced, perhaps unconsciously, at Shuffles, who stood directly in front of him.  \"Young gentlemen, the ballot will take place to-morrow morning, at nine o'clock. I have given you this notice, that you may be able to consider the matter and, if you choose, to make nominations for the several offices,\" continued the principal.  \"What are the offices, sir?\"  \"The first and most important one, of course, is the captain. The others are four lieutenants, four masters, two pursers, and four midshipmen.\"  \"What are they to do?\" asked Kendall.  \"I will not explain their duties now; it would require too much time. I mentioned them in the order of their importance. Now, young gentlemen, you should select your candidates for these offices by merit, not by favor. I am aware that a few of you have been to sea, but probably none of you are competent to handle a ship; and your choice should be based mainly on good character and good conduct. I hope I shall be able to approve the choice you may make. You are dismissed now.\"  \"Three cheers for the principal!\" shouted one of the boys.  \"Silence, young gentleman! Let me say now, that no expressions of approbation or disapprobation are to be allowed.\"  The boys separated into groups, and immediately gave their attention to the important subject suggested to them by Mr. Lowington. It must be acknowledged that violent symptoms of \"log-rolling\" began to be exhibited. There were fifty, if not eighty-seven young men who wished to be captain, and sit at the head of the table in the after cabin. Some of them went down into the steerage, and in five minutes there was a confused jabbering in every part of the ship.  \"For whom shall you vote, Wilton?\" asked Shuffles in a group of half a dozen which had gathered around one of the mess tables.  \"I don't know? whom do you go for?\" replied Wilton.  \"I rather think I shall go for Bob Shuffles. In my opinion, he is the best fellow on board,\" replied the owner of that name.  \"That's modest,\" laughed Wilton.  \"Do you know of any fellow that would make a better captain than I should?\"  \"You don't know the first thing about a ship.\"  \"What odds does that make? I can learn as fast as anybody else.\"  \"Do you expect every fellow to vote for himself?\" asked Howe, another of the group.  \"Of course I don't; I expect them to vote for me,\" answered Shuffles, with great good-nature.  \"You are rather cheeky, Shuffles.\"  \"What's the use of mincing the matter? Here we are, half a dozen of the best fellows in the ship. We can't all be captain; but one of us can be just as well as not.\"  \"That's so,\" added Howe, approvingly. \"But who shall that one be?\"  \"I am the one, without a doubt,\" said Shuffles.  \"I don't see it,\" interposed Monroe, shaking his head; and he was the young gentleman who had assisted the aspirant for the captaincy to rob Mr. Lowington's favorite peach tree.  \"What have you got to say about it, Ike Monroe? Do you expect us to go for you?\"  \"I didn't say so.\"  \"That's what you meant.\"  \"I've just as much right to the place as you have, Bob Shuffles.\"  \"Do you think you could make the fellows stand round as I can? But hold on; fellows, don't let us fight about it. We are just the best six fellows on board, and if we have a mind to do so, we can have this thing all our own way,\" continued Shuffles.  \"I don't see how,\" said Philip Sanborn.  \"Don't you know how the politicians manage these things?\"  \"I don't.\"  \"I'll tell you, then.\"  \"But the principal said we must go according to merit, and elect the fellows who were the best fitted for the offices,\" interposed Howe.  \"Exactly so; that's just what we are going to do. I'm going to be captain; can you tell me of any better fellow for the place?\" demanded Shuffles, who, putting aside the jesting manner in which he had commenced the discussion, now assumed an earnest and impudent tone.  \"Didn't you hear what Lowington said when he wound up his speech?\" asked Wilton.  \"What?\"  \"About vetoing our choice if it was not a proper one.\"  \"What of it?\" asked Shuffles, innocently.  \"Don't you think he would veto you?\"  \"Me! Not he! Lowington knows that I'm smart; I was too smart for him once, and he knows it. He won't veto me. We have been the best of friends lately.\"  \"I don't believe he'll have a chance to veto you,\" said Wilton.  \"What do you mean?\"  \"I don't believe you will be elected.\"  \"I know I shall, if we manage it right. Let us look at it,\" continued Shuffles, as he took a pencil from his pocket. \"Got a piece of paper?\"  Monroe gave him a piece of paper, and the wire-puller began to make his calculations.  \"Eighty-seven votes,\" said he, writing the number on the paper. \"Necessary to a choice, forty-four. Here are six votes to start with.\"  \"For whom?\" asked Monroe.  \"For me, for captain, first, and for each of the others for whatever place he wants; say for Wilton for first lieutenant; Howe for second, Sanborn for third, Monroe for fourth, and Adler for first master. What do you say to that, fellows?\"  As with the political \"slate,\" there was some difference of opinion in regard to the minor officers, even after Shuffles' claim to the captaincy had been conceded But this disposition of the spoils was finally agreed to.  \"Now we want thirty-eight more votes,\" Shuffles proceeded.  \"Just so; and you might as well attempt to jump over the main royal yard as to get them,\" added Adler, who, having been assigned to the office lowest in rank, was least satisfied with the \"slate.\"  \"Hold on; we haven't done yet. There are nine more offices. Now we will pick out some good fellow that will work for us, for each of these places; then we will promise him six votes if he will go our ticket, and do what he can for us.\"  \"That will give us only fifteen votes,\" said Adler.  \"I think that will be doing very well to start with. Then you five fellows can electioneer for me, and I'll do the same for you.\"  \"I think we have made one mistake,\" added Sanborn. \"Most of the fellows will go for Carnes for captain. He is an old salt, and has more influence than any other student in the ship. We ought to offer him some place.\"  \"Make him purser, if you like,\" said Shuffles, contemptuously.  \"That won't go down. Make him first lieutenant.\"  \"And shove me out?\" demanded Wilton, indignantly. \"I don't see it!\"  \"Nor I,\" added Shuffles. \"I won't vote for Carnes, any how. He's a snob and a flunky.\"  It was useless to resist the fiat of the chief wire-puller; the ticket remained as it had been originally prepared; and the young gentlemen proceeded to distribute the rest of the offices.     CHAPTER III.  THE ENSIGN AT THE PEAK.   The students on board of the Young America were between the ages of fourteen and seventeen. By the regulations, no boy under fourteen or over seventeen could be admitted, and they averaged about fifteen. They had, therefore, reached the years of discretion. Among them were a great many who were disposed to be wild boys, and not a few who had found it difficult to remain in similar institutions on shore. They were not criminal or depraved, but simply wild; with a tendency to break through reasonable restraint; with a taste for mad pranks, and a contempt for authority.  Of this class, who were a trial and a torment to the teachers of the ordinary high schools and academies, the larger proportion would have scorned to steal, or commit any wanton outrage upon the persons or property of others. There were many high-minded, noble-hearted young men, who could not tamely submit to authority, and were prone to insubordination, and who only needed the right kind of discipline to make them earnest and faithful men and useful citizens. There were few, if any, dunces or blockheads among them, for a life on shipboard had no attractions for such boys. They were, almost without an exception, wide-awake, bold, daring fellows, who had a taste for stirring events; fellows who wanted to climb the Rocky Mountains, visit the North Pole, and explore the Mammoth Cave. They were full of fun and mischief and it would have been easy at any time to get up a party among them to march the principal's cow into the parlor of the Academy; to climb to the belfry on a winter's night, and fill the inverted bell with water, where it would freeze solid before morning; or to convey the occupants of the hen-coop to the recitation room.  It was Mr. Lowington's task to repress the mischief in these boys, to keep them occupied with work and play, and to develop their moral and mental capacities. He had doubtless taken a heavy load upon himself but he felt that he was to labor for his race and his country. At least one half of his students were too wild to attend the ordinary public or private schools, or to profit by them if admitted. With such "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15920"],["title","Outward Bound Or, Young America Afloat: A Story of Travel and Adventure (#5)"],["body","material, his work could not be a sinecure. But he had a taste for it, and he gave his whole heart and soul to the performance of his duties.  When the students were gathered on board the Young America, they were mostly strangers to him, though he had communicated personally or by letter with the parents of all of them. He had read and listened to the stories of their pranks and peccadilloes, but when they came together, he hardly knew one from another, and was not prejudiced against any individual by the terrible accounts of him related by parents, guardians, or teachers. He purposed to give them the opportunity to select their own officers at first, in order to win a more cheerful obedience from them, and because the students knew each other better than he knew them.  After the announcement of the principal that the voting would commence on the following morning, nothing else was talked of on board. The qualifications of various members of the school were discussed by groups of excited voters; and we must do them the justice to say that most of them considered the matter unselfishly and with a single eye to the public good. Perhaps it is a little remarkable that not a single student, outside of the little group of wire-pullers that gathered in the steerage, thought of Shuffles for the position of captain; and the \"log-rollers\" were likely to have up-hill work in electing themselves to the six principal offices. But they went to work, and labored very diligently till bed-time in carrying their point.  While none thought of Shuffles in connection with the highest position, many mentioned the dignified young gentleman, who had made one voyage up the Mediterranean--Richard Carnes. He had been on board a fortnight, and had won and retained the respect of all his companions.  Before the little band of wire-pullers in the steerage had made up the \"slate\" to suit their minds, the crowd on deck had agreed upon Richard Carnes for captain, and were busy in discussing the qualifications of others for the subordinate offices, when the log-rollers separated, and went to work upon their mission.  \"How are you going to vote for captain, Kendall?\" said Wilton, stopping up to the young gentleman who had proposed so many questions to the principal, and who had been so honest in confessing his ignorance of nautical matters.  \"For Carnes, of course.\"  \"Humph! I wouldn't vote for him,\" sneered the wire-puller.  \"Why not?\"  \"He's too stiff; he'll put on airs, and be a tyrant over us.\"  \"No, he won't.\"  \"You see if he don't. I say, Kendall, are you up for any office?\" continued Wilton, with a certain appearance of slyness which the straightforward young gentleman did not exactly like.  \"Am I?\"  \"Yes, you. Wouldn't you like a room in the after cabin?\"  \"Perhaps I would,\" answered Kendall, thoughtfully; and the place was certainly very inviting to him.  \"They say the after cabin is a perfect little palace.\"  \"I dare say it is.\"  \"You can just as well go in there, if you like.\"  \"I don't see how that can be. I don't think I'm fit to be an officer. I am from Cincinnati, and I never saw a ship till I came east three weeks ago.\"  \"None of the fellows know anything about a ship. All of us will have to learn.\"  \"Carnes knows all about one.\"  \"No, he don't. He made one voyage, and knows just enough to talk salt. He's a good fellow enough, but he isn't fit for captain. If you want to be an officer, Kendall, and have a berth in the after cabin, you can, just as well as not.\"  \"Well, I would like such a place; I can't deny it; but I don't think the fellows will go for me.\"  \"They will, if you say so.\"  \"If I say so! I'm not going to ask them to vote for me,\" replied Kendall, warmly; for he was no politician and had a vein of modesty in his composition.  \"You needn't say a word to any one. If you will go for our ticket, it will be all right. Half a dozen of us have talked this matter over, and we have concluded that you would be the best fellow for second master.\"  \"Have you?\" asked Kendall, who could not help being gratified to learn that even half a dozen of his companions had thought him worthy to be an officer of so high a rank as second master. \"I'm very much obliged to you.\"  \"All you have to do, is to go for our ticket.\"  \"What do you mean by your ticket?\" demanded Kendall, who was rather confused by the technical terms of the wire-puller.  Wilton explained that his little party had selected a candidate for each of the offices; and if all the fellows agreed to it, there would be fifteen votes for their ticket, to begin with.  \"Well, what is your ticket?\" demanded Kendall, impatiently. \"If they are all good fellows, I will go for them. Of course you mean to vote for Carnes for captain.\"  \"Not exactly,\" replied Wilton, with evident disgust. \"We shall put up a better fellow than he is for captain.\"  \"Why, all the boys are going for him,\" added Kendall, astonished to find there were any who did not believe in Carnes.  \"No, they are not.\"  \"I thought they were.\"  \"He will not be elected, and you need not throw your vote away upon him, because, if you don't want a place in the after cabin, there are plenty of fellows who do,\" added the wire-puller, with apparent indifference.  \"But I do want it.\"  \"Then all you have to do, is to go for our ticket.\"  \"I think Carnes will make the best captain.\"  \"Very well; if you think so, you have a right to your own opinion. I haven't any mortgage on it.\"  \"Whom are you going to run for captain?\"  \"It's no use to talk any more about it, if you are going for Carnes,\" replied Wilton, as he turned to move away.  The wire-puller was playing a part. Paul Kendall was a noble little fellow, and was already a great favorite on board, not only with the boys, but with the principal and the professors. Wilton knew that he had a great deal of influence, and it was important to secure him for their ticket. If he could tell others that Kendall was going for their men, it would induce many to join their party. The \"favorite,\" though he was an honest, noble-hearted fellow, was still human, and a berth in the after cabin was a strong temptation to him.  \"I'm not going to say I'll vote for a fellow till I know who he is,\" added Kendall. \"If he's the right person, perhaps I'll go for him, though I wanted to see Carnes captain.\"  \"Carnes can't be elected, I tell you. We are going against him.\"  \"Whom are you going for, then?\"  \"For Bob Shuffles,\" replied Wilton, desperately, for he did not wish to mention his candidate till he had won the assent of his companion.  \"Shuffles!\" exclaimed Kendall, with something like horror mingled with his astonishment; \"I shall not go for him, anyhow.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"I don't think he is the right person for the place.\"  \"I do; he's a first-rate fellow--none of your milk and water chaps, that swallow camels and strain at gnats.\"  Kendall had some decided objections to Shuffles, and he positively refused to vote for him, even to obtain the coveted position in the after cabin. Wilton argued the matter with much skill and cunning; but his logic and his eloquence were both wasted.  \"Well, if you won't go for Shuffles, you must be content with your place in the steerage,\" added Wilton.  \"I won't go for him, any how,\" said Kendall, firmly.  \"You are making a mistake.\"  \"I don't think so. I'm bound to vote for the best fellow, and I'm sure Shuffles isn't the right one.\"  \"See here, Kendall; don't say a word to the others that I spoke to you of this little matter. I thought you would go with us, or I shouldn't have said anything to you.\"  \"Not say anything? Why not?\"  \"Because it will be better to keep still.\"  \"I shall not do anything of the kind. You have got up a plan to defeat Carnes, by giving the offices to fellows who will vote against him. You wish me to keep still, while you carry out your plan. I can see through a cord of wood, when there's a hole big enough.\"  \"I mentioned this thing to you in confidence.\"  \"You didn't say a word about confidence; and I didn't promise to keep still. I won't keep still. I think it is a mean trick to buy up the votes of the fellows, and I'll blow the whole thing higher than a kite.\"  \"You'll catch it if you do,\" said Wilton, in a threatening tone.  \"Catch what?\" demanded Kendall, with a very pretty exhibition of dignity.  \"Bob Shuffles will give it to you.\"  \"Give what to me?\"  \"Give you the biggest licking you ever had in your life,\" answered Wilton, angrily, \"You are so stupid, you can't understand anything.\"  \"I think I can understand the licking, when if comes. That's a game that two can play at.\"  \"What do you mean, you little bantam? Do you think you can whip Bob Shuffles?\"  \"I had no idea of whipping him; and I have no idea of his whipping me, either.\"  Kendall was spunky. Wilton could make nothing of him by threats or persuasion; and he turned away from him to seek a more promising field of labor. Kendall took off his cap, scratched his head as he reflected upon the event which had just transpired, and made up his mind that it was an insult to an independent elector to attempt to buy his vote with the paltry consideration of an office. He was sorry that he had been even tempted by the proposition of the wire-pullers, and thankful that his sense of honor and decency had prompted him to decline it when asked to vote for an improper person. True to his promise, he made all haste to expose the conspiracy, as he regarded it, against Carnes.  When the students turned in that night, the wire-pullers had found a sufficient number of candidates for all the offices on the terms set forth in the compact, each of whom had promised to use his influence for the entire ticket. Shuffles had made a very pretty calculation, to the effect that each of the fifteen candidates could influence at least two votes besides his own for the ticket, which would inevitably elect it. But during all this time Paul Kendall had been laboring like a Trojan for Carnes, and had induced his "]]]
