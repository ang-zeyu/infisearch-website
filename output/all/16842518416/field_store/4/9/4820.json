After a few introductory observations, Prof. HITCHCOCK said:--       This, I believe, is the first example in which a State Government      in our country has erected a museum for the exhibition of its      natural resources, its mineral and rock, its plants and animals,      living and fossil. And this seems to me the most appropriate spot      in the country for placing the first geological hall erected by      the Government; for the County of Albany was the district where      the first geological survey was undertaken, on this side of the      Atlantic, and, perhaps, the world. This was in 1820, and ordered      by that eminent philanthropist, Stephen Van Rensselaer, who,      three years later, appointed Prof. Eaton to survey, in like      manner, the whole region traversed by the Erie Canal. This was      the commencement of a work, which, during the last thirty years,      has had a wonderful expansion, reaching a large part of the      States of the Union, as well as Canada, Nova Scotia, and New      Brunswick, and, I might add, several European countries, where      the magnificent surveys now in progress did not commence till      after the survey of Albany and Rensselaer Counties. How glad      are we, therefore, to find on this spot the first Museum of      Economical Geology on this side of the Atlantic! Nay, embracing      as it does all the department of Natural History, I see in it      more than a European Museum of Economical Geology, splendid      though they are. I fancy, rather, that I see here the germ of a      Cis-Atlantic British Museum, or Garden of Plants.       North Carolina was the first State that ordered a geological      survey; and I have the pleasure of seeing before me the gentleman      who executed it, and in 1824-5 published a report of 140 pages.      I refer to Professor Olmstead, who, though he has since won      brighter laurels in another department of science, will always be      honored as the first commissioned State geologist in our land.  Of the New York State Survey he said:--       This survey has developed the older fossiliferous rocks, with a      fullness and distinctness unknown elsewhere. Hence European      savans study the New York Reports with eagerness. In 1850, as I      entered the Woodwardian Museum, in the University of Cambridge,      in England, I found Professor McCoy busy with a collection of      Silurian fossils before him, which he was studying with Hall's      first volume of Paleontology as his guide; and in the splendid      volumes, entitled _British Paleozoric Rocks and Fossils_, which      appeared last year as the result of those researches, I find      Professor Hall denominated the great American Paleontologist. I      tell you, Sir, that this survey has given New York a reputation      throughout the learned world, of which she may well be proud. Am      I told that it will, probably, cost half a million? Very well.      The larger the sum, the higher will be the reputation of New      York for liberality; and what other half million expended in our      country, has developed so many new facts or thrown so much light      upon the history of the globe, or won so world-wide and enviable      a reputation?  And of Geological Surveys in general:--       In regard to this matter of geological surveys, I can hardly      avoid making a suggestion here. So large a portion of our country      has now been examined, more or less thoroughly, by the several      State governments, that it does seem to me the time has come      when the National government should order a survey--geological,      zoological, and botanical--of the whole country, on such a      liberal and thorough plan as the surveys in Great Britain are      now conducted; in the latter country it being understood that at      least thirty years will be occupied in the work. Could not the      distinguished New York statesman who was to have addressed us      to-day be induced, when the present great struggle in which he      is engaged shall have been brought to a close, by a merciful      Providence, to introduce this subject, and urge it upon Congress?      And would it not be appropriate for the American Association      for the Advancement of Science to throw a petition before the      government for such an object? Or might it not, with the consent      of the eminent gentleman who has charge of the Coast Survey, be      connected therewith, as it is with the Ordnance Survey in Great      Britain.  The history of the American Association was then given:--       Prof. Mather, I believe, through Prof. Emmons, first suggested to      the New-York Board of Geologists in November, 1838, in a letter      proposing a number of points for their consideration. I quote      from him the following paragraph relating to the meeting. As to      the credit he has here given me of having personally suggested      the subject, I can say only that I had been in the habit for      several years of making this meeting of scientific men a sort      of hobby in my correspondence with such. Whether others did the      same, I did not then, and do not now know. Were this the proper      place, I could go more into detail on this point; but I will      merely quote Prof. Mather's language to the Board:--         * * * * \"Would it not be well to suggest the propriety of a      meeting of Geologists and other scientific men of our country at      some central point next fall,--say at New-York or Philadelphia?      There are many questions in our Geology that will receive new      light from friendly discussion and the combined observations of      various individuals who have noted them in different parts of our      country. Such a meeting has been suggested by Prof. Hitchcock;      and to me it seems desirable. It would undoubtedly be an      advantage not only to science but to the several surveys that are      now in progress and that may in future be authorized. It would      tend to make known our scientific men to each other personally,      give them more confidence in each other, and cause them to      concentrate their observation on those questions that are of      interest in either a scientific or economical point of view. More      questions may be satisfactorily settled in a day by oral      discussion in such a body, than a year by writing and      publication.\"[A]       [Footnote A: In the letter alluded to, on examination, we      discover another passage bearing on the point, which, owing to      the Professor's modesty we suspect, he did not read. Prof. Mather      adds. \"You, so far as I know, first suggested the matter of such      an Association. I laid the matter before the Board of Geologists      of New-York, specifying some of the advantages that might be      expected to result; and Prof. Vanuxem probably made the motion      before the Board in regard to it.\"]       Though the Board adopted the plan of a meeting, various causes      delayed the first over till April, 1840, when we assembled in      Philadelphia, and spent a week in most profitable and pleasant      discussion, and the presentation of papers. Our number that year      was only 18, because confined almost exclusively to the State      geologists; but the next year, when we met again in Philadelphia,      and a more extended invitation was given, about eighty were      present; and the members have been increasing to the present      time. But, in fact, those first two meetings proved the type, in      all things essential, of all that have followed. The principal      changes have been those of expansion and the consequent      introduction of many other branches of science with their eminent      cultivators. In 1842, we changed the name to that of the      Association of American Geologists and Naturalists; and in 1847,      to that of the American Association for the Advancement of      Science. I trust it has not yet reached its fullest development,      as our country and its scientific men multiply, and new fields of      discovery open.  Prof. H. said of this particular occasion:--       We may be quite sure that this Hall will be a center of deep      interest to coming generations. Long after we shall have passed      away will the men of New-York, as they survey these monuments,      feel stimulated to engage in other noble enterprises by this      work of their progenitors, and from many a distant part of the      civilized world will men come here to solve their scientific      questions, and to bring far-off regions into comparison with      this. New-York, then, by her liberal patronage, has not only      acquired an honorable name among those living in all civilized      lands, but has secured the voice of History to transmit her fame      to far-off generations.                 SIR WILLIAM LOGAN ASKS \"THE WAY TO ALBANY.\"  Sir WILLIAM E. LOGAN, of Canada, in a brief speech acknowledged the services rendered by the New-York Survey to Canada. He should manifest ingratitude if he declined to unite in the joyful occasion of inaugurating the Museum which was to hold forever the evidence of the truth of its published results. The Survey of Canada had been ordered, and the Commission of five years twice renewed; and the last time, the provision for it was more than doubled. It happened to him, as Mr. Agassiz had said: after crossing the ocean first, the first thing he asked was, \"Which is the way to Albany?\" and when he arrived here, he found that with the aid of Prof. Hall's discoveries, he had only to take up the different formations as he had left them on the boundary line, and follow them into Canada. It was both a convenience and a necessity to adopt the New-York nomenclature, which was thus extended over an area six times as large as New-York. In Paris he heard De Vernier using"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16227"],["title","The Uses of Astronomy (#2)"],["body"," words Trenton and Niagara, as if they were household words. He was delighted to witness the impatience with which Barron inquired when the remaining volumes of the Paleontology of New-York would be published. Your Paleontological reputation, said he, has made New-York known, even among men not scientific, all over Europe. I hope you will not stop here, but will go on and give us in equally thorough, full, and magnificent style, the character of the Durassic and Cretaceous formations.                        PROFESSOR HENRY ON DUTCHMEN.  Professor HENRY was at a loss to know by what process they had arrived at the conclusion that seven men of science must be substituted to fill the place of one distinguished statesman whom they had expected to hear. He prided himself on his Albany nativity. He was proud of the old Dutch character, that was the substratum of the city. The Dutch are hard to be moved, but when they do start their momentum is not as other men's in proportion to the velocity, but as the square of the velocity. So when the Dutchman goes three times as fast, he has nine times the force of another man. The Dutchman has an immense potentia agency, but it wants a small spark of Yankee enterprise to touch it off. In this strain the Professor continued, making his audience very merry, and giving them a fine chance to express themselves with repeated explosions of laughter.             PROFESSOR DAVIES ON THE PRACTICAL NATURE OF SCIENCE.  Prof. CHARLES DAVIES was introduced by EX-GOVERNOR SEYMOUR, and spoke briefly, but humorously and very much to the point, in defense of the practical character of scientific researches. He said that to one accustomed to speak only on the abstract quantities of number and space, this was an unusual occasion, and this an unusual audience; and inquired how he could discuss the abstract forms of geometry, when he saw before him, in such profusion, the most beautiful real forms that Providence has vouchsafed to the life of man. He proposed to introduce and develop but a single train of thought--the unchangeable connection between what in common language is called the theoretical and practical, but in more technical phraseology, the ideal and the actual. The actual, or true practical, consists in the uses of the forces of nature, according to the laws of nature; and here we must distinguish between it and the empirical, which uses, or attempts to use, those forces, without a knowledge of the laws. The true practical, therefore, is the result, or actual, of an antecedent ideal. The ideal, full and complete, must exist in the mind before the actual can be brought forth according to the laws of science. Who, then, are the truly practical men of our age? Are they not those who are engaged most laboriously and successfully in investigating the great laws? Are they not those who are pressing out the boundaries of knowledge, and conducting the mind into new and unexplored regions, where there may yet be discovered a California of undeveloped thought? Is not the gentleman from Massachusetts (Professor Agassiz) the most practical man in our country in the department of Natural History, not because he has collected the greatest number of specimens, but because he has laid open to us all the laws of the animal kingdom? Are the formulas written on the black-board by the gentleman from Cambridge (Prof. Pierce) of no practical value, because they cannot be read by the uninstructed eye? A single line may contain the elements of the motions of all the heavenly bodies; and the eye of science, taking its stand-point at the center of gravity of the system, will see in the equation the harmonious revolutions of all the bodies which circle the heavens. It is such labors and such generalizations that have rendered his name illustrious in the history of mathematical science. Is it of no practical value that the Chief of the Coast Survey (Prof. Bache), by a few characters written upon paper, at Washington, has determined the exact time of high and low tide in the harbor of Boston, and can determine, by a similar process, the exact times of high and low water at every point on the surface of the globe? Are not these results, the highest efforts of science, also of the greatest practical utility? And may we not, then, conclude that _there is nothing truly practical which is not the consequence of an antecedent ideal_?  Science is to art what the great fly-wheel and governor of a steam-engine are to the working part of the machinery--it guides, regulates, and controls the whole. Science and art are inseparably connected; like the Siamese Twins, they cannot be separated without producing the death of both.  How, then, are we to regard the superb specimens of natural history, which the liberality, the munificence; and the wisdom of our State have collected at the Capitol? They are the elements from which we can here determine all that belongs to the Natural History of our State; and may we not indulge the hope, that science and genius will come here, and, striking them with a magic wand, cause the true practical to spring into immortal life?   Remarks were also uttered by Prof. CHESTER DEWEY, President ANDERSON, and Rev. Dr. COX.  And thus ended the Inauguration of the State Geological Hall.  We turn to the Observatory, in regular order of succession.                       INAUGURATION OF DUDLEY OBSERVATORY.   The Inauguration of the Dudley Observatory took place under the same tent which was appropriated to the dedication of the Geological Hall, and on the day following that event. An immense audience was assembled, drawn by the announcement of Mr. EVERETT'S Oration.  At a little past three o'clock the procession of _savans_ arrived from the Assembly Chamber, escorted by the Burgesses Corps. Directly in front of the speaker's stand sat Mrs. DUDLEY, the venerable lady to whose munificence the world is indebted for this Observatory. She was dressed in an antique, olive-colored silk, with a figure of a lighter color, a heavy, red broché shawl, and her bonnet, cap, &c., after the strictest style of the old school. Her presence added a new point of interest.  Prayer having been uttered by Rev. Dr. SPRAGUE, of Albany, THOMAS W. OLCOTT, Esq., introduced to the audience Ex-Governor WASHINGTON HUNT, who spoke briefly in honor of the memory of CHARLES E. DUDLEY, whose widow has founded and in part endowed this Observatory with a liberality so remarkable.  Remarks were offered by Dr. B. A. GOULD and Prof. A. D. BACHE, and Judge HARRIS read the following letter from Mrs. DUDLEY, announcing another munificent donation in aid of the new Observatory--$50,000, in addition to the $25,000 which had been already expended in the construction of the building. The letter was received with shouts of applause, Prof. AGASSIZ rising and leading the vast assemblage in three vehement cheers in honor of Mrs. DUDLEY!                                          ALBANY, Thursday, Aug. 14, 1856.  _To the Trustees of the Dudley Observatory:_       GENTLEMEN,--I scarcely need refer in a letter to you to the      modest beginning and gradual growth of the institution over which      you preside, and of which you are the responsible guardians. But      we have arrived at a period in its history when its inauguration      gives to it and to you some degree of prominence, and which must      stamp our past efforts with weakness and inconsideration, or      exalt those of the future to the measure of liberality necessary      to certain success.       You have a building erected and instruments engaged of unrivaled      excellence; and it now remains to carry out the suggestion of      the Astronomer Royal of England in giving permanency to the      establishment. The very distinguished Professors BACHE, PIERCE,      and GOULD, state in a letter, which I have been permitted to see,      that to expand this institution to the wants of American science      and the honors of a national character, will require an      investment which will yield annually not less than $10,000; and      these gentlemen say, in the letter referred to,--       \"If the greatness of your giving can rise to this occasion, as      it has to all our previous suggestions, with such unflinching      magnanimity, we promise you our earnest and hearty coöperation,      and stake our reputation that the scientific success shall fill      up the measure of your hopes and anticipations.\"       For the attainment of an object so rich in scientific reward and      national glory, guaranteed by men with reputations as exalted and      enduring as the skies upon which they are written, contributions      should be general, and not confined to an individual or a place.       For myself, I offer, as my part of the required endowment, the      sum of $50,000 in addition to the advances which I have already      made; and, trusting that the name which you have given to the      Observatory may not be regarded as an undeserved compliment, and      that it will not diminish the public regard by giving to the      institution a seemingly individual character,                       I remain, Gentlemen, your obedient servant,                                                     BLANDINA DUDLEY.  Judge HARRIS then introduced the Orator of the occasion, Hon. EDWARD EVERETT, whose speech is given verbatim in these pages.                   THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE DUDLEY OBSERVATORY.  During the Sessions of the American Association, the new Astronomical Instruments of Dudley Observatory were described in detail by Dr. B. A. GOULD, who is the Astronomer in charge. We condense his statements:--       The Meridian Circle and Transit instrument were ordered from      Pistor & Martins, the celebrated manufacturers of Berlin, by      whom the new instrument at Ann Arbor was made. A number of      improvements have been introduced in the Albany instruments, not      perhaps all absolutely new, but an"]]]
