The boat was yet some distance from the boys, while the horrid sea-monster was fearfully near.  [Illustration]  Suddenly the silence was broken by the roar of the gun; and, as the old man knew his shot was gone, he covered his face with his hands, as if afraid to see the result. If he had failed, he knew that his boy was lost.  For a moment after the report of the gun had died away upon the air, there was an unbroken silence; but, as the thick smoke arose from the surface of the water, there was, at first, a low murmur breaking from the lips of the men,--that murmur grew louder and stronger, till it swelled to a joyous, deafening shout.  The old gunner sprung to his feet, and gazed off on the water, and the first thing that met his sight was the huge body of the shark floating on its back, the shot aimed by him having instantly killed it.  In a few moments the boat reached the daring swimmers, and, greatly frightened, they were brought on board. The old man clasped his boy in his arms, and then, overcome by the powerful excitement, he leaned upon a gun for support.          *       *       *       *       *   Directions for Reading.--What paragraphs should be read rapidly?

Away, away in the Northland,     Where the hours of the day are few,   And the nights are so long in winter,     They can not sleep them through;    Where they harness the swift reindeer     To the sledges when it snows;   And the children look like bear's cubs,     In their funny, furry clothes:    They tell them a curious story--     I don't believe 'tis true;   And yet you may learn a lesson     If I tell the tale to you.    Once, when the good Saint Peter     Lived in the world below,   And walked about it, preaching,     Just as he did, you know;    He came to the door of a cottage,     In traveling round the earth,   Where a little woman was making cakes,     In the ashes on the hearth.    And being faint with fasting--     For the day was almost done--   He asked her, from her store of cakes,     To give him a single one.    So she made a very little cake,     But as it baking lay,   She looked at it and thought it seemed     Too large to give away.    Therefore she kneaded another,     And still a smaller one;   But it looked, when she turned it over,     As large as the first had done.    Then she took a tiny scrap of dough,     And rolled and rolled it flat;   And  baked it thin as a wafer--     But she couldn't part with that.    For she said, \"My cakes that seem so small     When I eat of them myself,   Are yet too large to give away.\"     So she put them on a shelf.    Then good Saint Peter grew angry,     For he was hungry and faint;   And surely such, a woman     Was enough to provoke a saint.    And he said, \"You are far too selfish     To dwell in a human form,   To have both food and shelter,     And fire to keep you warm.    \"Now, you shall build as the birds do,     And shall get your scanty food   By boring, and  boring, and boring,     All day in the hard dry wood.\"    Then up she went through the chimney.     Never speaking a word;   And out of the top flew a woodpecker,     For she was changed to a bird.    She had a scarlet cap on her head,     And that was left the same,   But all the rest of her clothes were burned     Black as a coal in the flame.    And every country school-boy     Has seen her in the wood;   Where she lives in the trees till this very day     Boring and boring for food.    And this is the lesson she teaches:     Live not for yourselves alone,   Lest the needs you will not pity     Shall one day be your own.    Give plenty of what is given to you,     Listen to pity's call;   Don't think the little you give is great,     And the much you get is small.    Now, my little  boy, remember that,     And try to be kind and good,   When you see the woodpecker's sooty dress,     And see her scarlet hood.    You mayn't be changed to a bird, though you live     As selfishly as you can;   But you will be changed to a smaller thing--     A mean and selfish man.          *       *       *       *       *   Directions for Reading.--In what manner should this lesson be read at the beginning--quietly, or with much spirit?

What's that?\"  Charlie turned it over in his hands, and pulled the bar a little. The bar slipped so that it hung only by a corner.  \"Never mind,\" I said, as he looked up with a scared expression. \"It isn't broken. Put the bar back.\"  Charlie put it back, and it sprung into place with a sharp click.  \"That's funny!\" he cried again. \"What made it jump so? And what makes it stick? It doesn't feel sticky.\"  \"We call it magnetism,\" I said. \"Now, take hold of the bar, and see if you can pull it straight off.\"  \"I can't. It sticks fast.\"  \"Pull harder.\"  Charlie braced himself for a strong pull. Suddenly the bar came off, and he went tumbling backward.  \"What did you say makes it hold so hard?\" said he, getting up.  \"Magnetism,\" said I again.  \"But what is magnetism?\"  \"I couldn't tell you if I tried; but I think you could learn a great deal about it with that magnet. You will find a lot of things in that box that may help you.\"  Saying this, I left him to pursue his studies as best he could. When I came back, I found him more puzzled than when I left him.  \"That's the queerest thing I ever saw,\" he said. \"Some things just jump at it as though they were alive; some things it pulls; and some things it doesn't pull a bit.\"  \"That's a very long lesson you have learned,\" I said. \"What does it pull?\"  \"These,\" he said, pointing to a pile of things on one side of the box. \"And these things it doesn't pull.\"  \"Let us see what you have in this pile,\" I said, looking at the first little heap; \"keys?\"  \"Trunk keys,\" said Charlie. \"It doesn't pull door keys. I tried ever so many.\"  \"Try this key,\" said I, taking one from my pocket. \"This is a trunk key. See if the magnet pulls it.\"  \"No-o,\" said Charlie, thoughtfully, \"it doesn't; but it pulled all the rest of the trunk keys I could find.\"  \"Try this key to my office door.\"  Charlie tried it, and to his great amazement the key stuck fast to the magnet.  \"Surely,\" said I, \"it pulls some door keys, and fails to pull some trunk keys.\"  Charlie was more puzzled than ever. He looked at the keys, thought a moment, then picked up my trunk key, and said: \"This key is brass; the rest are iron.\"  \"That's so,\" I said.  \"And all these door keys that the magnet didn't pull,\" he continued, \"are brass, too. Perhaps it can't pull brass things.\"  \"Suppose you try. But first see if there are any brass things that the magnet pulled.\"  Charlie looked them over. Then we tried the casters of my chair, and all the other brass things we could find, none of which the magnet would pull.  \"There's no use in trying any longer,\" said Charlie. \"It won't pull brass.\"  \"Then, there's another matter settled,\" I said. \"The magnet does not pull brass. Is there any thing else it does not pull?\"  \"Wood,\" said Charlie. \"I tried lots of pieces.\"  \"Any thing else?\"  \"Stones,\" said Charlie, eagerly.  \"What are these?\" I asked, holding up a couple of heavy stones he had put among the things the magnet pulled.  \"I guess I put those there by mistake,\" said Charlie, testing with, the magnet a number of stones in the other pile.  \"Try them,\" I said.  \"O!\" he said, as the magnet lifted them; \"I forgot. It does lift some stones.\"  \"Well, what else have you in that pile of things the magnet did not pull?\"  \"Glass, leather, lead, bone, cloth, tin, zinc, corn, and a lot of things.\"  \"Very well. Now let us see what the magnet does pull.\"  \"Iron keys,\" said Charlie, \"and nails.\"  \"Here's a nail in this other pile.\"  \"That's a brass nail. The magnet pulls only iron nails.\"  \"What else have we in this pile?\"  \"Needles, hair-pins, screws, wire--iron wire,\" he added quickly. \"Brass wire doesn't stick, you know.\"  \"How about this?\" I asked, taking a small coil of copper wire from my desk.  \"I guess that won't stick,\" said Charlie. \"Because that's copper wire, and the magnet doesn't seem to pull any thing that isn't iron.\"  Much to Charlie's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15825"],["title","New National Fourth Reader (#8)"],["body","action, the magnet did not pull the copper wire. Then I took up two stones, one rusty red, the other black, and said: \"What about these?\"  \"I guess they must have iron in them too,\" said Charlie. \"Have they?\"  \"They have,\" I replied. \"They are iron ores from which iron is made. Why did you think there was iron in them?\"  \"Because they wouldn't have stuck to the magnet if there wasn't.\"  \"Quite true. So you have learned another very important fact. Can you tell me what it is?\"  \"The magnet pulls iron,\" said Charlie.  \"Good,\" said I; \"and it is also true that the magnet does not pull--\"  \"Things that are not iron,\" said Charlie.  \"True again,\" I said. \"So far as our experiments go, the magnet pulls iron always, and never any thing else.\"  \"But what makes it pull iron?\"  \"That I can not tell. We see it does pull, but just how the pulling is done, or what makes it, no one has yet found out.  \"For convenience we call the pulling power magnetism.

There are few sights more pleasing than a herd of tall and graceful giraffes.  With, their heads reaching a height of from twelve to eighteen feet, they move about in small herds on the open plains of Africa, eating the tender twigs and leaves of the mimosa and other trees.  The legs of a large giraffe are about nine feet long, and its neck nearly six feet; while its body measures only seven feet in length and slopes rapidly from the neck to the tail.  The graceful appearance of the giraffe is increased by the beauty of its skin, which is orange red in color and mottled with dark spots.  Its long tail has at the end a tuft of thick hair which serves the purpose of keeping off the flies and stinging insects, so plentiful in the hot climate of Africa.  [Illustration]  Its tongue is very wonderful. It is from thirteen to seventeen inches in length, is slender and pointed, and is capable of being moved in various ways. It is almost as useful to the giraffe as the trunk is to the elephant.  The horns of the giraffe are very short and covered with skin. At the ends there are tufts of short hair. The animal has divided hoofs somewhat resembling those of the ox.  The head of the giraffe is small, and its eyes, large and mild looking. These eyes are set in such a way that the animal can see a great deal of what is behind it without turning its head.  In addition to its wonderful power of sight, the giraffe can scent danger from a great distance; so there is no animal more difficult of approach.  Strange to relate, the giraffe has no voice. In London, some years ago, two giraffes were burned to death in their stables, when the slightest sound would have given notice of their danger, and saved their lives.  The giraffe is naturally both gentle and timid, and he will always try to avoid danger by flight. It is when running that he exposes his only ungraceful point.  He runs swiftly, but as he moves the fore and hind legs on each side at the same time, it gives him a very displeasing and awkward gait.  But though timid, he will, when overtaken, turn even upon the lion or panther, and defend himself successfully by powerful kicks with his strong legs.  The natives of Africa capture the giraffe in pitfalls, which are deep holes covered over with branches of trees and dirt. When captured, he can be tamed, and gives scarcely any trouble during captivity.  Fifty years ago, but little was known about giraffes in Europe or America. Now we can find them in menageries and the public gardens of our large cities.  The giraffe thrives in captivity and seems to be well satisfied with a diet of corn and hay. It is a source of great satisfaction to those who admire this beautiful animal, that there is no reason which prevents him from living in a climate so different from that of his African home.          *       *       *       *       *   Language Lesson.--Write statements containing each of the following words, used in such a manner as to show their proper meaning: _feet, feat; red, read; fore, four; gait, gate_.

Out in the West, where many Indians live, there are white men who go among them to trade for furs and skins of animals.  These furs and skins are collected and prepared by the Indians, and serve the purpose of money when the traders visit them to dispose of various kinds of goods.  In old times, before the white men came to this country, the Indians had only bows and arrows, and spears with which to hunt.  But the white men soon taught them to use guns, and to-day, nearly all the tribes in America are well supplied with rifles or shotguns.  They are very expert with these fire-arms, and as they use them a great deal, must have a large and constant supply of gunpowder.  A story is told of how, at one time, a tribe of Indians tried to raise gunpowder by planting seed. This shows how little they knew of civilized life and habits.  A trader went to a certain Indian nation to dispose of a stock of goods. Among other things he had a quantity of gunpowder.  The Indians traded for his cloths, hats, axes, beads, and other things, but would not take the powder, saying: \"We do not wish for the powder; we have plenty.\"  The trader did not like to carry all the powder back to his camp; so thought he would play a trick on the Indians, and induce them to buy it.  Going to an open piece of ground near the Indian camp, he dug some little holes in the soft, rich soil; then mixing a quantity of onion seed with his powder, he began to plant it.  The Indians were curious to know what he was doing, and stood by greatly interested.  \"What are you doing?\" said one. \"Planting gunpowder,\" replied the trader.  \"Why do you plant it?\" inquired another.  \"To raise a crop of powder. How could I raise it without planting?\" said the trader. \"Do you not plant corn in the ground?\"  \"And will gunpowder grow like corn?\" exclaimed half a dozen at once.  \"Certainly it will,\" said the trader. \"Did you not know it? As you do not want my powder, I thought I would plant it, and raise a crop which I could gather and sell to the Crows.\"  Now the Crows were another tribe of Indians, which was always at war with this tribe. The idea of their enemies having a large supply of powder increased the excitement, and one of the Indians said:  \"Well, well, if we can raise powder like corn, we will buy your stock and plant it.\"  But some of the Indians thought best to wait, and see if the seed would grow. So the trader agreed to wait a few days.  In about a week the tiny sprouts of the onion seed began to appear above the ground.  The trader calling the Indians to the spot, said: \"You see now for yourselves. The powder already begins to grow, just as I told you it would.\"  The fact that some small plants appeared where the trader had put the gunpowder, was enough to convince the Indians.  Every one of them became anxious to raise a crop of gunpowder.  The trader sold them his stock, in which there was a large mixture of onion seeds, at a very high price, and then left.  From this time, the Indians gave no attention to their corn crop. If they could raise gunpowder, they would be happy.  They took great care of the little plants as they came up out of the ground, and watched every day for the appearance of the gunpowder blossoms.  They planned a buffalo hunt which was to take place after the powder harvest.  After a while the onions bore a plentiful crop of seeds, and the Indians began to gather and thresh it.  They believed that threshing the onion seeds would produce the powder. But threshing failed to bring it. Then they discovered that they had been cheated.  Of course the dishonest trader avoided these Indians, and did not make them a second visit.  After some time, however, he sent his partner to them for the purpose of trading goods for furs and skins.  By chance they found out that this man was the partner of the one who had cheated them.  They said nothing to him about the matter; but when he had opened his goods and was ready to trade, they coolly helped themselves to all he had, and walked off.  The trader did not understand this. He became furiously angry, and went to make his complaint to the chief of the nation.  \"I am an honest man,\" said he to the chief. \"I came here to trade"]]]
