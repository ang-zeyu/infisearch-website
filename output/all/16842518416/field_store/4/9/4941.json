I'll tell the king what both of you do claim. He will decide to whom the colt belongs.  [_The Prince goes._]  KNAVE. See how the colt lies between my oxen! Is not that proof that he is mine?  NIX. But who can tell what a colt will do?  [_The_ PRINCE _comes._]  PRINCE. Farmers, the king has decided. He says the colt belongs where it is now lying.  KNAVE. And he lies between my oxen.  PRINCE. That is proof enough, The colt belongs to you, Farmer Knave.  NIX. But, Prince--  PRINCE. Not another word! Go, now, with your wagons and horses and oxen! The queen comes out to walk. Go, all of you!  [_The Prince enters the castle. The farmers go, Nix last. The_ QUEEN _and her_ LADIES _come from the castle._]  QUEEN. Go bring Farmer Nix to me.  [_A Lady runs to Nix._]  LADY. The queen wants to see you, sir.  [_Nix goes to the Queen and bows._]  QUEEN. I heard all from the castle window. I know the colt is yours.  NIX. I thank you, my Queen, I thank you!  QUEEN. Now you must show the king that colts cannot belong to oxen, never have belonged to oxen, and never will belong to oxen.  NIX. I will go to him at once! I will tell him--  QUEEN. Not so fast! I said you must show the king. He would not let you tell him. No one ever dares to tell things to a king.  NIX. How can I show him?  QUEEN. You must think out the way. I cannot help you more.  NIX. I thank you, my Queen, I thank you.  QUEEN. The king comes out to walk soon.  NIX. I will return to show him.  [_Nix bows to the Queen and goes. The_ KING _and_ PRINCE _come from the castle._]  QUEEN. 'Tis a pleasant day to walk, dear King.  KING. Oh, 'tis very, very pleasant.  [_Enter_ Nix _with a fishing-net. He throws out the net and draws it in._]  QUEEN. Why, look you what that foolish man is doing!  KING. He throws out his net and draws it in! He acts just as if he were fishing.  QUEEN. Let's ask what he is doing.  KING. Come here, you foolish fellow! Come here, I say!  (NIX _comes to the King, but goes on with his fishing._)  Now what are you doing, sir?  [Illustration]  NIX. I am fishing, fishing, fishing.  KING. How can you fish where is no water?  NIX. Fish can be found on land if colts belong to oxen.  KING. What is that, sir?  NIX. If colts belong to oxen, then fish should swim in dust.  KING. Well, well, that may be true! What do you think, dear Queen?  QUEEN. I think with you--it may be true.  NIX (_fishing_). If colts belong to oxen, then I will always fish in dust.  KING. Well, well, I think you may be right, sir!  (_Pause. The King thinks deeply._)  Yes, I am now sure that you are right, sir. Go get your colt from Farmer Knave. Go with him, Prince, and see to it. Now come, dear Queen, we'll walk about together, for 'tis a very pleasant day, 'tis very, very pleasant.

What if there is a cuckoo there?  PODGE. We are building a wall around it, Sire?  KING. Why build a wall around it?  NODGE. To keep it from flying away.  KING. Ha, ha! Don't you know that the bird can fly over the wall?  HODGE. Well, well! Who would have thought of that!  NODGE. How very wise you are, Sire!  KING. You foolish fellows! Well, go on and build your wall.  (_Enter_ SCRODGE, _carrying a door on his back._)  Where are you going with that door?  SCRODGE. I am going on a journey, Sire.  KING. Why do you carry a door?  SCRODGE. I left my money at home, Sire.  KING. Why didn't you leave the door at home?  SCRODGE. I was afraid of thieves.  KING. Afraid of thieves! And you have taken down your door!  SCRODGE. If I have the door with me, they can't break it open to get in.  KING. You foolish fellow! Why didn't you leave your door at home and carry your money?  SCRODGE. Well, well! Who would have thought of that! How very wise you are, Sire!  KING. Ha, ha, ha! Well, go on and carry your door.  (_To Soldiers._)  These Gotham men are foolish. Does it not seem so to you?

Now who is John, ladies? Who is John, lords? Truly, who are you, John?  [_All laugh. Enter the_ KNIGHT _and_ ABBOT.]  KING. Abbot, I hear strange things about you.  ABBOT. Your Majesty! How can that be?  KING. 'Tis said that every day you have one hundred men to dine with you.  ABBOT. Oh, your Majesty, they are only friends.  KING. No matter who they are!  JESTER.

First, you must tell me how long I shall live.  [_The Abbot is silent._]  JESTER. Go on, John! Ask as many as you like!  KING. Then, Abbot, you must tell me what I think.  ABBOT. Your questions, Sire, are deep and hard.  KING. Answer them, or go to prison.  ABBOT. I pray you for some time to think!  KING. I will give you just two weeks. If you cannot answer then, I'll have your head cut off. And then I'll take your lands and palaces.  JESTER. And your knights and golden plates!  ABBOT (_in a trembling voice_).

SECOND PROFESSOR. I am sorry too, friend Abbot. And I do wish the same.  ABBOT. You both have tried your best. Farewell.  (_The Professors bow and go._)  Alas! Alas! Alas! Alas!  [_Enter the_ SHEPHERD.]  SHEPHERD. Good-day to you, good Abbot!  ABBOT. Ah, Shepherd, I am glad to see you. How goes it in your village?  SHEPHERD. We do nothing there but laugh since your visit to us, sir. We laugh all day and half the night.  ABBOT. Now why do you do that?  SHEPHERD. Because, sir, I look so much like you. At least, they think so in our village.  ABBOT. Why, that is true, you do. Well, what can I do for you?  SHEPHERD. I have heard about the two questions, sir. I have come to help you.  ABBOT.
