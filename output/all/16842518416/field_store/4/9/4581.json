EFFECT OF THE OBJECTIVE ON OUR TEACHING  Not only will this point of view vitalize our teaching for the pupils, but it will also save it from becoming commonplace and routine for ourselves. This truth is brought out in a conversation that occurred between an old schoolmaster and his friend, a business man.  The true objective saves from the rut of routine.--Said the business man, \"Do you teach the same subjects year after year?\"  The schoolmaster replied that he did.  \"Do you not finally come to know this material all by heart, so that it is old to you?\" asked the friend.  The schoolmaster answered that such was the case.  \"And yet you must keep going over the same ground, class after class and year after year!\" exclaimed the business man.  The schoolmaster admitted that it was so.  \"Then,\" said his friend, \"I should think that you would tire beyond endurance of the old facts, and grow weary beyond expression of repeating them after the charm of novelty and newness has gone. How do you live through the sameness and grind?\"  \"You forget one thing!\" exclaimed the old schoolmaster, who had learned the secret of the _great objective_. \"You forget that I am not really teaching that old subject matter at all; I am teaching _living boys and girls!_ The matter I teach may become familiar. It may have lost the first thrill of novelty. But the _boys and girls are always new_; their hearts and minds are always fresh and inviting; their lives are always open to new impressions, and their feet ready to be turned in new directions. The old subject matter is but the means by which I work upon this living material that comes to my classroom from day to day. I should no more think of growing tired of it than the musician would think of growing tired of his violin.\"  And so the schoolmaster's friend was well answered.  Unsafe measures of success.--It is possible to lodge much subject matter in the mind which, once there, does not function. It is possible to teach many facts which play no part in shaping the ideals, quickening the enthusiasms, or directing the conduct. And all mental material which lies dead and unused is but so much rubbish and lumber of the mind. It plays no part in the child's true education, and it dulls the edge of the learner's interest and his enjoyment of the school and its instruction.  It is possible to have the younger children in our Sunday schools from week to week and still fail to secure sufficient hold on them so that they continue to come after they have reached the age of deciding for themselves. The proof of this is all too evident in the relatively small proportion of youth in our church-school classes between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five.  It is possible to offer the child lessons from the Bible throughout all the years of childhood, and yet fail to ground sufficient interest in the Bible or religion so that in later years the man or woman naturally turns to the Bible for guidance or comfort, and fails to make religion the determining principle of the life.  The child the only true measure of success.--Let us therefore be sure of our objective. Let us never be proud nor satisfied that we have taught our class so much _subject matter_--so many facts, maxims, or lessons of whatever kind. We shall need to teach them all these things, and teach them well. But we must inquire further. We must ask, What have these things _done_ for the boys and girls of my class? What has been the outcome of my teaching? How much effect has it had in life, character, conduct? In how far are my pupils different for having been in my class, and for the lessons I have taught them? In how far have I accomplished the _true objective_ of my teaching?  Let us never feel secure merely because the children are found in the Sunday school, and because the statistical reports show increase in numbers and in average attendance. These things are all well; without them we cannot do the work which the church should do for its children. But these are but the externals, the outward signs. We must still inquire what real influence the school is having on the growing spiritual life of its children. We must ask what part our instruction is having in the making of Christians. We must measure all our success in terms of the child's response to our efforts. We must realize that we have failed except as we have caused the child's spiritual nature to unfold and his character to grow toward the Christ ideal.       1. As you think of your own teaching, are you able to decide      whether you have been sufficiently clear in your objective? Have      you rather _assumed_ that if you presented the lessons as they came      the results must of necessity follow, or have you been alive to the      real effects on your pupils?       2. Are you able to discover definite changes that are working out      in the lives of your pupils from month to month as you have them      under your instruction? Are they more reverent, more truthful, more      sure against temptation, increasingly conscious of God in their      lives? What other effects might you look for?       3. Do you think that the church is in some degree overlooking its      most strategic opportunity in not providing more efficiently for      the religious education of its children? If more attention were      given to religious nurture of children, would the problems of      evangelism be less pressing, and a larger proportion of adults      found in the church? What can the church school do to help? What      can your class do?       4. Do you love the matter that you seek to teach the children? Do      you love it for what it means to you, or for what through it you      can do for them? Do you look upon the material you teach truly as a      means and not as an end? Are you teaching subject matter or      children?       5. Do you feel the real worth and dignity of childhood? Do you      sometimes stop to remember that the ignorant child before you      to-day may become the Phillips Brooks, the Henry Ward Beecher, the      Livingstone, the Frances Willard, the Luther of to-morrow? Do you      realize the responsibility that one takes upon himself when he      undertakes to guide the development of a life?       6. Can you now make a statement of the measures that you will wish      to apply to determine your degree of success as a teacher? It will      be worth your while to try to make a list of the immediate      objectives you will seek for your class to attain in their personal      lives. Keep this list and see whether it is modified by the      chapters that lie ahead.   FOR FURTHER READING  Harrison, A Study of Child Nature.  Moxcey, Girlhood and Character.

CHAPTER III  THE FOURFOLD FOUNDATION[1]  [1] The point of view and in some degree the outlines of this and several following chapters have been adapted from the author's text \"Class-Room Method and Management,\" by permission of the publishers, _The Bobbs-Merrill Co._, Indianapolis.   All good teaching rests on a fourfold foundation of principles. These principles are the same from the kindergarten to the university, and they apply equally to the teaching of religion in the church school or subjects in the day school. Every teacher must answer four questions growing out of these principles, or, failing to answer them, classify himself with the unworthy and incompetent. These are the four supreme questions:       1. What definite _aims_ have I set as the goal of my teaching? What      _outcomes_ do I seek?       2. What _material_, or _subject matter_, will best accomplish these      aims? What shall I stress and what shall I omit?       3. How can this material best be _organized_, or arranged, to adapt      it to the child in his learning? How shall I plan my material?       4. What shall be my plan or _method of presentation_ of this      material to make it achieve its purpose? What of my technique of      instruction?   THE AIM IN TEACHING RELIGION  First of all, the teacher of religion must _have_ an aim; he must know what ends he seeks to accomplish. Some statistically minded person has computed that, with all the marvelous accuracy of aiming modern guns, more than one thousand shots are fired for every man hit in battle. One cannot but wonder how many shots would be required to hit a man if the guns were not aimed at anything!  Is the analogy too strong? Is the teacher more likely than the gunner to reach his objective without consciously aiming at it? And can the teacher set up for attainment as definite aims as are offered the gunner? Do we _know_ just what ends we seek in the religious training of our children?  Life itself sets the aim.--This much at least is certain. We know _where to look for_ the aims that must guide us. We shall not try to formulate an aim for our teaching out of our own thought or reasoning upon the subject. We shall rather look out upon life, the life the child is now living and the later life he is to live, and ask: \"_What are the demands that life makes on the individual?_ What is the equipment this child will need as he meets the problems and tests of experience in the daily round of living? What qualities and powers will he require that he may the most fully realize his own potentialities and at the same time most fruitfully serve his generation? What abilities must he have trained in order that he may the most completely express God's plan for his life?\" When we can answer such questions as these we shall have defined the aim of religious education and of our teaching.  The knowledge aim.--First of all, life demands _knowledge_. There are things"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15800"],["title","How to Teach Religion (#6)"],["body","we must know if we are to avoid dangers and pitfalls. Knowledge shows the way, while ignorance shrouds the path in darkness. To be without knowledge is to be as a ship without a rudder, left to drift on the rocks and shoals. The religious life is intelligent; it must grasp, understand, and know how to use many great truths. To supply our children with _religious knowledge_ is, therefore, one of the chief aims of our teaching.  Yet not all knowledge is of equal worth. Even religious knowledge is of all degrees of fruitfulness. Some knowledge, once acquired, fails to function. It has no point of contact with our lives. It does not deal with matters we are meeting in the day's round of experience. It therefore lies in the mind unused, or, because it is not used, it quickly passes from the memory and is gone. Such knowledge as this is of no real value. It is not worth the time and effort put upon its mastery; and it crowds out other and more fruitful knowledge that might take its place.  To be a true end of education, knowledge must be of such nature that it _can be put at work_. It must relate to actual needs and problems. It must have immediate and vital points of contact with the child's common experiences. The child must be able to see the relation of the truths he learns to his own interests and activities. He must feel their value and see their use in his work and in his play. This is as true of religious knowledge as of knowledge of other kinds. The religious knowledge the child needs, therefore, is a knowledge that _can at once be incorporated in his life_. To supply the child with knowledge of this vital, fruitful sort becomes, then, one great aim in the teaching of religion.  But knowledge alone is not enough. Indeed, knowledge is but the beginning of religious education, whereas we have been in danger of considering it the end. Many there are who _know_ the ways of life but do not follow them. Many _know_ the paths of duty, but choose an easier way. Many _know_ the road to service and achievement, but do not enter thereon. If _to do_ were as easy as to know what to do, then all of us would mount to greater heights.  The attitudes aim.--Life demands _goals_ set ahead for achievement. It must have clearly defined the \"worth whiles\" which lead to endeavor. Along with the knowledge that guides our steps must be the impulses that drive to right action. Besides knowing what to do there must be inner compelling forces that _get things done_. The chief source of our goals and of the driving power within us is what, for want of a better term, we may call our _attitudes_.  Prominent among our attitudes are the _interests, enthusiasms, affections, ambitions, ideals, appreciations, loyalties, standards, and attachments_ which predominate. These all have their roots set deep in our emotions; they are the measure of life's values. They are the \"worth whiles\" which give life its quality, and which define the goal for effort.  Chesterton tells us that the most important thing about any man is the _kind of philosophy he keeps_--that is to say, his _attitudes_. For it is out of one's attitudes that his philosophy of life develops, and that he settles upon the great aims to which he devotes himself. It is in one's attitudes that we find the springs of action and the incentives to endeavor. It is in attitudes that we find the forces that direct conduct and lead to character.  To train the intellect and store the mind with knowledge without developing a fund of right attitudes to shape the course of action is therefore even fraught with danger. The men in positions of political power who often misgovern cities or use public office as a means to private gain do not act from lack of knowledge or in ignorance of civic duty; their failure is one of ideals and loyalties; their attitude toward social trust and service to their fellow men is wrong. The men who use their power of wealth to oppress the poor and helpless, or unfairly exploit the labor of others to their own selfish advantage do not sin from lack of knowledge; their weakness lies in false standards and unsocial attitudes. Men and women everywhere who depart from paths of honor and rectitude fall more often from the lack of high ideals than because they do not know the better way.  The goal and the motive power in all such cases comes from a false philosophy of life; it is grounded in wrong attitudes. The education of those who thus misconceive life has failed of one of its chief aims--_to develop right attitudes_. Hence character is wanting.  The conduct, or application, aim.--The third and ultimate aim of education has been implied in the first two; it is _conduct, right living_. This is the final and sure test of the value of what we teach--how does it find _expression in action_? Do our pupils think differently, speak differently, act differently here and now because of what we teach them? Are they stronger when they meet temptation from day to day? Are they more sure to rise to the occasion when they confront duty or opportunity? Are their lives more pure and free from sin? Do the lessons we teach find expression in the home, in the school, and on the playground? Is there a real outcome _in terms of daily living_?  These are all fair questions, for knowledge is without meaning except as it becomes a guide to action. High ideals and beautiful enthusiasms attain their end only when they have eventuated in worthy deeds. What we _do_ because of our training is the final test of its value. Conduct, performance, achievement are the ultimate measures of what our education has been worth to us. By this test we must measure the effects of our teaching.  Summary of the threefold aim.--The _aim_ in teaching the child religion is therefore definite, even if it is difficult to attain. This aim may be stated in three great requirements which life itself puts upon the child and every individual:       1. _Fruitful knowledge_; knowledge of religious truths that can be      set at work in the daily life of the child now and in the years      that lie ahead.       2. _Right attitudes_; the religious warmth, responsiveness,      interests, ideals, loyalties, and enthusiasms which lead to action      and to a true sense of what is most worth while.       3. _Skill in living_; the power and will to use the religious      knowledge and enthusiasms supplied by education in shaping the acts      and conduct of the daily life.  True, we may state our aim in religious teaching in more general terms than these, but the meaning will be the same. We may say that we would lead the child to a knowledge of God as Friend and Father; that we seek to bring him into a full, rich experience of spiritual union with the divine; that we desire to ground his life in personal purity and free it from sin; that we would spur him to a life crowned with deeds of self-sacrifice and Christlike service; that we would make out of him a true Christian. This is well and is a high ideal, but in the end it sums up the results of the religious _knowledge, attitudes_, and _acts_ we have already set forth as our aim. These are the parts of which the other is the whole; they are the immediate and specific ends which lead to the more distant and general. Let us, therefore, conceive our aim in _both_ ways--the ideal Christian life as the final goal toward which we are leading, and the knowledge, attitudes, and acts that make up to-day's life as so many steps taken toward the goal.   SELECTING THE SUBJECT MATTER  After the aim the subject matter. When we would build some structure we first get plan and purpose in mind; then we select the material that shall go into it. It is so with education. Once we have set before us the aim we would reach, our next question is, What shall be the means of its attainment? When we have fixed upon the fruitful knowledge, the right attitudes, and the lines of conduct and action which must result from our teaching, we must then ask, What _means_ shall we select to achieve these ends? What _material or subject matter_ shall we teach in the church school?  The subject matter he presents is the instrumentality by which the teacher must accomplish his aims for his class. Through this material he must awaken thought, store the mind with vital truths, arouse new interests, create ideals and lead the life to God. As the artist works with brush and paint, with tool and clay, so the teacher must work with truths and lesson materials.  Guiding principles.--Two great principles must guide in the selection of subject matter for religious instruction:       1. _The material must be suited to the aims we seek._       2. _The material must be adapted to the child._  The tools and instruments the workman uses must be adapted to the purpose sought. Ask the expert craftsman what kind of plane or chisel you should buy for a piece of work you have in mind, and he will ask you just what ends you seek, what uses you would put them to. Ask the architect what materials you should have for the structure you would build, and he will tell you that depends on the plan and purpose of your building.  The material must fit the aim.--What materials of religious truth should the teacher bring to his class? The answer is that truths and lessons must be suited to the aim we seek. Would we lead our children to understand the Fatherhood of God and to love him for his tender care? Then the lessons must contain this thought, and not be built on irrelevant material. Would we lead youth to catch the thrill and inspiration of noble lives, to pattern conduct after worthy deeds? Then our lesson material must deal with the high and fine in character and action, and not with trivial things of lesser value.  So also, if we would capture the interest of childhood for the church school and bind its loyalty to the church, the subject matter we offer and the lessons we teach in the house of God must contain the glow and throb of life,"]]]
