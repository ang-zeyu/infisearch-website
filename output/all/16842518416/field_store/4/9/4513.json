Because there was no one else to confide in, she confided in the maid. Patient old Eliot listened to much family history that did not interest her and which she immediately forgot, and to many girlish rhapsodies over \"Cousin Elizabeth,\" whom Eugenia declared was the dearest thing that ever drew the breath of life.  As Eugenia talked on, idly rocking herself back and forth on the bed, Eliot sorted the linen with deft fingers, laying some of it away in drawers, sweet with dainty sachets, and putting some aside that needed a stitch or two. Presently, as she listened, she found herself taking more interest in the country place that Eugenia described than in anything she had heard of since she said good-bye to her dear little cottage home in England. She began to hope that Mr. Forbes would consent to Eugenia's accepting the invitation, and expressed that wish to Eugenia.  \"Why, of course I am going!\" exclaimed Eugenia, in surprise. \"Whether papa wants me to or not! I shall answer Cousin Elizabeth's letter this very minute and accept the invitation before he comes home. Then if he makes a fuss it will be too late, and I can tease him into a good humour.\"  Bouncing off the bed, she went back to the sitting-room and sat down at her desk. When that letter was written, carefully, and in her best style, she dashed off three notes in an almost unreadable scrawl, to Mollie and Fay and Kell, telling them of her invitation and the delight it gave her. Then she wandered back to the bedroom where Eliot sat mending, and wandered restlessly around the room.  \"How slow the time goes,\" she exclaimed, pausing in front of the mantel. \"Two hours until papa will be here. I want to tell him about it, and ask for some more money. I need an extra allowance for this visit.\"  There was a little Dresden clock on the mantel; two cupids holding up a flower basket, from which swung a spray of roses that formed the pendulum.  \"Two long hours,\" she fumed, scowling at the clock. \"Hurry up, you old slow-poke,\" she cried, catching up the fragile little timepiece and shaking it until the pendulum rattled against the cupids' plump legs. \"I can't bear to wait for things.\"  \"But life is mostly waiting, miss,\" said Eliot, with a solemn shake of her head. \"You'll find that out when you are as old as I am. We wait for this and we wait for that, and first thing we know the years are gone, and we are standing with one foot in the grave, waiting for Death to lift us in.\"  Eugenia put her hands over her ears with a little scream. \"Stop talking like that, Eliot,\" she cried. \"I won't listen, and I won't spend my life waiting in that way. You may if you want to.\"  Running back to her sitting-room, she banged the door behind her to shut out the sound of Eliot's voice. The next hour she spent by the window, looking down on the shifting scenes of the streets below,--the noisy New York streets, spread out like a giant picture-book before her. Then it began to grow dark, and lights twinkled here and there, and great letters of flame appeared as by magic across the fronts of buildings, and on the electric arches spanning the streets.  Eliot came and drew the curtains, and a glance at the little cupids told her it was time to dress for dinner.  \"I'll wear my buttercup dress to-night, Eliot,\" said Eugenia, when her black hair had been carefully brushed and plaited in two long braids. \"It always makes my eyes look so big and dark, somehow, and brings out the colour in my lips and cheeks.\"  \"You are a young one to be noticing such things as that,\" said Eliot, under her breath. She wanted to say it aloud, but she only pursed her lips together as she got out the dress Eugenia had asked for. It was of some soft, clinging material, of the same sunny yellow that buttercups wear, and Eugenia knew very well how becoming it was to her brunette style of beauty. After she was dressed, she spun around before the pier-glass until she heard her father's step in the hall.  Although she had been so impatient for his coming, she said nothing about the invitation from Locust until they had gone down to dinner and were seated in the great dining-room together. She knew that that was not the way Mollie or Fay or Kell would have done. Any one of them would have rushed at her father the moment he came in sight, and would have put her arms around his neck and poured out the whole story. But Eugenia had never felt on such intimate terms with her father. She admired him extremely, and thought he was the handsomest man she had ever seen, but her love for him was of a selfish kind. So long as he indulged her and never opposed her will, she was a most dutiful little daughter, but as soon as his wishes crossed hers she pouted and sulked.  To her surprise, he made no objection to her accepting the invitation to the house party, except to say, half-laughingly, \"Don't you think you are a little selfish to want to run off and leave me alone when I've scarcely seen you all winter?\" Then he laughed outright as she made a saucy little grimace in answer. He would miss her very much when she was gone, for she was a bright little thing and amused him, but he had a feeling of relief as well to think that a month of her vacation would be pleasantly occupied. She had been so discontented away from her little friends.  After dinner they strolled into an alcove, screened from the hall by great pots of palms, and sat down to listen to the music, and watch the people passing back and forth. It was a gay scene. Ladies in elaborate evening gowns passed out with their escorts to the opera, or waited for the carriages that were to take them later to balls or receptions. Everywhere there was the gleam of white shoulders, the nodding of jewelled aigrettes, the flashing of diamond tiaras. Above it all rose the odour of flowers, the hum of voices, and the music of violins.  Mr. Forbes, smiling through half-closed eyelids at this passing of Vanity Fair, looked down at Eugenia. She was leaning forward in a picturesque pose against the arm of her high-backed chair. The light fell softly on her pale yellow gown and her dusky hair. The red lips were parted in a smile as she watched the pretty pageant, and there was a bright colour in her cheeks.  Mr. Forbes was proud of his handsome little daughter. He admired her ease of manner, and boasted that she was as self-possessed under all circumstances as any grown woman he knew. It pleased him to have his friends predict that she would be a brilliant social success. He was doing everything in his power to make her that, and yet--sometimes--a vague fear crossed his mind that she was growing cold and selfish. Sometimes she seemed far too old and worldly-wise for a child of her age. He sighed as he looked at her. They were sitting so near each other that his hand rested on the arm of her chair. Yet he felt that they had grown widely apart in their long absences.  \"What are you thinking about, Eugenia?\" he asked, suddenly. She turned with a little start.  \"Oh, I had forgotten that you were there!\" she exclaimed. \"I was thinking of Locust, and how glad I would be to get away from this tiresome place. It's such a bore to do the same thing night after night, and always watch the same kind of people.\"  A shadow crossed his face, but she did not see it. She had turned back to her day-dreams in which he had no part. Happy little day-dreams, of what was to come with the coming June.     CHAPTER IV.  \"ONE FLEW WEST.\"   Out in the village of Plainsville, Kansas, the rain was running in torrents down the gables of the little brown house where the Ware family lived. It had rained all day, a cold, steady pour, until the world outside had taken on the appearance of early March, instead of late May.  Holland and Mary and the baby (they called him baby still, although he was nearly four) were playing menagerie in the corners of the dining-room. They had a tent made of the clothes-horse and some sheets, and the growling and roaring that went on inside was something terrific. It made no difference to the little mother, placidly sewing by the last rays of daylight at one of the western windows; but the noise grated on Joyce's mood.  Joyce had finished setting the supper-table, and while she waited for the potatoes to boil she stood with her face pressed against the kitchen window, looking gloomily out into the back yard.  It was not a cheerful outlook. Nothing was to be seen but the high board alley fence with a broken chicken-coop leaning against it, the weather-beaten old stable, and a scraggy, dripping peach-tree. The yard was full of puddles, and still the rain splashed on. The sight made Joyce want to cry.  \"If I wasn't at home,\" she said to herself, \"I should think that I am homesick, for I feel the way I did that day up in Monsieur Gr√©ville's pear-tree in the old French garden. Then I was tired of France and everything foreign, and would have given all I owned to be back in America. Now I am here with mother and the children, but still I am as unhappy and dissatisfied as I was then. I wonder why!\"  It had been less than a year since Joyce had had that wonderful winter in Touraine with her cousin Kate, but it seemed such a long, long time ago, in looking back upon it. She had settled down into the common humdrum round of duties so completely that sometimes it seemed to her that she had never been away at all; that she must have dreamed that year into her life, or read about it as happening to some other girl.  As she stood with her face pressed against the window-pane, the noise in the dining-room suddenly ceased, and Mary came into the kitchen, followed by the rest of the menagerie. \"I'm tired of being a lion,\" she said, wiping her flushed little face with the sleeve of her apron, and shaking back her funny little tails of hair "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15741"],["title","The Little Colonel's House Party (#5)"],["body","with red ribbon, that were always bobbing forward over her shoulders.  \"I've roared till my throat is sore, and I'm hungry. Isn't supper most ready, sister?\"  Joyce glanced at the clock. \"It'll be ready in ten minutes,\" she answered, and returned to her survey of the back yard.  \"I wish that we were going to have dumplings for supper to-night,\" said Holland, \"and turkey and sausages. Don't you, Mary?\" He snuffed hungrily at the saucepan on the stove.  \"No,\" said Mary, pausing thoughtfully, as if considering a weighty matter. \"I'd rather have ice cream and chocolate cake. If I had a witch with a wand that's what I'd wish for supper to-night. Wouldn't you, sister?\"  Joyce turned away from the window and lifted the lid from the kettle in which the stew was bubbling. \"I don't know,\" she said, gazing dreamily into the depths of the savoury stew. \"If I had that old witch with a wand that you are always talking about, I'd not stop simply with something to eat. I would wish myself back in Tours, with Madame sweeping down to dinner in her red velvet gown, and the candle-light shining on the cut glass and silver. I'd wish for dinner to be served elegantly in courses as Henri did it there every night, and I'd hear old Monsieur making his little jokes over the walnuts and wine. And afterward there wouldn't be any dishes for me to wash, as there are here, and at bedtime Marie would come with my candle and untie my slippers and brush my hair. Oh, it's so nice to be waited on! You don't know how I miss it sometimes. It is horrid to be poor.\"  Mary and Holland listened in flattering silence. They had great respect for their thirteen-year old sister, who had been across seas and visited old chateaux where kings and queens once lived. She was the only child in Plainsville who could boast the distinction of having been abroad, and there was a glamour about it that enchanted them. They were never tired of hearing of her adventures.  \"It's horrid to be poor,\" she said again, clapping the lid on the kettle. \"I hate to live in a little crowded-up house, and spoil my hands with dust and dish-water, and do the same things year in and year out.\"  Joyce stopped suddenly, wishing that she could unsay that last speech, for the little mother had come into the kitchen in time to hear it. There was a pained expression on her face.  \"I am afraid my bird of passage will never be satisfied with the little home nest again,\" she said, sadly.  \"Oh, mother, I didn't mean it as bad as it sounds; truly, I didn't,\" cried Joyce. \"You know that usually I am as contented as a cricket; but I don't know what is the matter with me to-day. It must be the weather.\"  Just then there was a stamping on the porch outside, and the violent flapping of an umbrella to rid it of the raindrops clinging to it.  \"Jack!\" shouted Mary, rushing to the door, with Holland and the baby tagging at her heels. \"A letter for Joyce!\" they called in chorus the next instant, all straggling back after the oldest brother as he bore it triumphantly into the kitchen.  \"From Lloydsboro Valley,\" announced Joyce, and Mrs. Ware's face lighted up with one of her rare smiles.  \"Ah, I knew it was coming,\" she said, \"and I am sure it will prove an antidote for your blues. I had a letter from the same place last week, and I've been in the secret ever since.\"  \"What secret?\" demanded Mary, her eyes round with curiosity, and Jack echoed the question.  \"That Joyce was to be invited to a house party in June, back in 'My old Kentucky home.' The invitation is from one of my old school friends. There were three of us,\" she went on, in answer to the look of eager interest in Mary's eyes. \"Three girls who grew up together: Joyce Allen (your sister is named for her), Elizabeth Lloyd, and myself. And now our little daughters are to meet in the same dear old valley where we played together and grew up together and learned to love each other like sisters. I hope they will become as dear friends as we were.\"  Joyce looked up from her letter, her face aglow with joyful surprise. \"Oh, mother!\" she cried, \"do you really mean it? Is it possible that I am to go? How can you afford it?\"  Mrs. Ware motioned toward the envelope lying at Joyce's feet.  \"Look again,\" she said, \"and you will find that Mr. Sherman has sent a pass. As for the clothes, well, your 'witch with a wand' has come to the rescue again.\"  \"Cousin Kate?\" gasped Joyce.  Mrs. Ware nodded. \"What would you think if I were to tell you that there has been a box hidden away in my closet for nearly a week, waiting for this letter, which I knew was on its way, and inside are the very things you need to complete your summer outfit? There is a new hat, for one thing, and material for several very pretty dresses.\"  Mary danced up and down, her hair ribbons bobbing over her shoulders, and her face ashine, as she cried, \"Oh, sister, isn't it lovely? I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad!\"  But Joyce stood with her face suddenly grown serious and her lips trembling. Her little sister's unselfish delight made her conscience hurt. Putting her arms around her mother's neck, she hid her face against her shoulder. \"Oh, mother,\" she sobbed, \"I don't deserve it all! Here I've been so fretful and discontented all day, thinking there'd never be any good times any more, and that there was nothing but work ahead of me, and all the time this beautiful surprise was on its way. I don't deserve for it to be mine. It ought to be Mary's. She never frets over things.\"  Mrs. Ware looked down into Mary's face, still a-smile with the thought of her sister's pleasure, and said: \"Mary is to have a little slice of this, too. I wonder what she will say when she sees a certain pink parasol that I saw in that box, and a white sash with pink rosebuds on it, and slippers that I'm sure wouldn't fit anything else in the house but her own wigglesome little feet.\"  Mary's hands came together ecstatically, with a long-drawn \"Oh!\" Then she clasped her mother around the knees, demanding, breathlessly:  \"Anything for Holland in that box?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Anything for Jack?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Anything for the baby?\"  Mrs. Ware nodded.  \"And you?\"  Another nod.  \"Then there isn't a single word in the dictionary good enough to fit!\" screamed Mary, excitedly, spinning around and around in the kitchen floor until the red ribbons stood out at right angles from her head. \"There isn't a single word, Holland; we'll just have to _squeal_!\"  At that she gave a long, ear-piercing shriek that seemed to go through the roof like a fine-pointed needle. Holland and the baby joined in, each trying to make a louder noise than the other. Their eyes were tightly shut, their mouths wide open, and their faces red to bursting.  \"There, there, children!\" exclaimed Mrs. Ware, laughingly, as they stopped to take breath. \"The neighbours will think that the house is on fire. We'll have a policeman after us if you make such a noise.\"  \"The kettle is boiling over!\" cried Holland, and Joyce flew to the rescue. Jack went to change his wet clothes, and the three smaller children trotted back and forth, pushing chairs to the table, and helping to carry in the supper.  Many a bedraggled passer-by that evening looked out from under his dripping umbrella as he neared the little brown house, cheered by a babel of happy voices. The lamplight streaming across the wet pavement drew his gaze to a window whose blinds had not been closed, and the picture lingered pleasantly in his memory for many a day. It was the Ware family at supper. And afterward, when the dishes had been cleared away, there was another picture to shine out into the wet night: the children unpacking the box that Jack had dragged out of its hiding-place.  Mary paraded jubilantly around the room in her new slippers, the rosebud sash tied around her gingham apron, the pink parasol held high above her head, and her face such a picture of delight that one could not look at her without smiling, too.  [ILLUSTRATION: \"SHE SORTED THE RIBBONS AND EXAMINED THE GLOVES.\"]  Even the baby sat up an hour after his bedtime, to take part in the unusual excitement. The prospect of Joyce's seeing the old valley seemed to have unlocked a door into the little mother's memory. Story after story she brought out to entertain them, of the things that had happened when she was a care-free little schoolgirl, before sorrow and worry and work had come to make her tired and sad.  While she entertained them Joyce brought a bureau drawer from her bedroom, and, propping it on two chairs, began looking over its contents. She sorted the ribbons and examined the gloves, counted the handkerchiefs and inspected the stockings, dividing everything into three piles. One pile was pronounced suitable to take on the visit, one good enough to wear at home after another renovating, and one altogether past wearing.  \"It's a sort of day of judgment,\" said Jack, who was watching the performance with interest. \"You're separating the sheep from the goats; only there's three divisions here, white sheep, black sheep, and goats.\"  \"I love for such days to come,\" said Mary, falling upon the third pile and bearing it away as her lawful spoils, \"for I always get all the goats. Now my dolls can set up a milliner's shop and dry-goods store with all this stuff that Joyce has thrown away.\"  \"You may take my new umbrella with you, if you want it, Joyce,\" said Jack. \"I haven't used it half a dozen times since I got it Christmas, and you will want to put on style in Kentucky. Your old one is good enough for me to use out here in Plainsville.\"  \"Do you want my blue spotted necktie, sister?\" asked Holland, leaning against her and looking up into her face with an anxious little pucker on his forehead. \"It's the best one I've got, but you may take it if you want to.\"  \"And maybe--\" began Mary, hesitatingly. She stopped an instant, a little struggle evidently going on in her mind. Then she began again, bravely: \"Yes, I'll lend it to you if you want"]]]
