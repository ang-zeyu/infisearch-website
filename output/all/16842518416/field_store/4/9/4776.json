Once knock this fact into people's minds, and their      self-righteous indifference and intolerance soon change into lively      concern for themselves and their families.\"  The facts seem so plain, and yet there is still great opposition to the promotion of a knowledge of sexual cleanliness and self-disinfection. Only a short time ago (the end of 1920), Sir Frederick Mott, the great authority on syphilis, felt obliged to oppose some opponents of self-disinfection at a public enquiry in London in this fashion:--       \"The point is that large numbers of innocent women have suffered      from disease. They are rendered sterile, have miscarriages and      abortions, and large numbers have been ruined. I have been      connected with the London County Asylums for twenty-five years, and      I have seen in those asylums people from all states of society, and      I have seen them die of general paralysis. Five per cent. of the      people who get syphilis, in spite of treatment, develop this      disease. That is only one aspect of it. I was on the Royal      Commission on Venereal Disease, and Sir William Osier, who was a      great authority, said that he could teach medicine on syphilis      alone, because every tissue in the body is affected by it, and that      the diseases of blindness, deafness, insanity and every form of      disease may be due to syphilis. You have only to consider the      effect that it had upon the army, and I understand that more than      two army corps were invalided during the war on account of venereal      disease. What have you to say to that? Does not that create some      anxiety?\"  It is difficult even to read this eloquent appeal--the more eloquent perhaps because it was quite unpremeditated--without being deeply moved. Yet the witnesses opposing Sir Frederick Mott were apparently unaffected. Of them, as of men of old, it might justly be said:--       \"He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they      should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart,      and be converted.\"  And now large numbers of hospitals all over the Empire are issuing appeals for the means to treat venereal disease.       \"It is tragic,\" says one London hospital, \"to see the      sufferers--men, women and even little children--innocent little      mites, knowing not from what they suffer or why they should. It is      thought by many that venereal disease is a sign of guilt, but large      numbers of our patients are innocent victims.\"  Is it not time then that we all stopped repeating timid platitudes about making vice safe, and did something practical to _make marriage safe?_  _Why don't we?_  Is it because we are afraid to define the terms we use so glibly? We talk of promoting chastity, for example. _What is chastity?_ Surely chastity is happy, healthy sexual intercourse between a man and a woman who love one another; and unchastity is sexual intercourse between those who do _not_ love one another. No sexual intercourse at all is neither chastity nor unchastity; it is the negation of both, and it ends in extinction. Why trouble so much about a negation that inevitably means racial death? Why not devote ourselves to life and love; to the building of a happy healthy human family--a family that instinctively realises that the clean blood-stream of a nation is its most priceless possession?  But the national blood-stream can never be clean until there is a complete knowledge of sexual control and sanitation among all of us, and especially among women. One of the very first things which women must learn to understand is the control of conception and the control of venereal diseases. They must learn how to prevent the birth of the unfit; how to secure the birth of the fit; and even though their husbands are infective they must learn how to break the chain of infection in their own bodies, so that what is bad for the race does not become worse. If women are brave enough and wise enough, they can in most cases _wipe out the scourge of venereal diseases from their own hearths and homes_, and ensure that every child born is at least physically fit. But this cannot be done without _knowledge_, and that knowledge is at present lacking.  The following pages are written with the object of imparting useful, practical knowledge to sensible and serious women. The women who accept and apply this knowledge can rest calm in the sure and certain faith that it is their offspring who will build up the coming race.     II.--PRACTICAL METHODS OF PREVENTION.  A. FOR WOMEN:  SEXUAL REPRODUCTION.   To understand the practical methods of birth-control, or the control of conception, we must first have a clear view of the processes involved when the reproductive organs are in activity, and of the nature and situation of the sexual organs themselves. The diagrams on pages 34, 35 and 36 show in general outline the reproductive organs of man and woman.  Now fertilisation does not necessarily occur whenever the male organ comes in contact with the female organ. Fertilisation occurs only when a male-cell (spermatazoon) unites with a female-cell (ovum); in other words, when the spermatazoa in the seminal fluid of a man meet and unite with the germ or ovum in the body of a woman. That is the beginning of the child. This union of the two cells need not take place during or immediately after sexual intercourse. It may occur many hours, or even two or three weeks, after connection, because the spermatazoa have motion of their own. They are tiny threadlike bodies, which may work their way towards the ovum long after they have left the body of the man and been placed in the body of the woman, and the uterus has a searching movement, and may by its pulsations draw the spermatazoa upwards. For these reasons a woman cannot be quite sure of the exact time of fertilisation, and hence cannot predict exactly the date of the child-birth. Generally the pregnancy lasts nine months, but it may last longer--say ten months on rare occasions; and it may be extended apparently by a delay in fertilisation.   PREVENTION OF CONCEPTION.  For many reasons which I need not enumerate here, the precautions against impregnation can most easily and effectively be taken by the _woman_, rather than by the man. She is the one fertilised, and therefore she is the one to guard herself against fertilisation.  There are _two methods_ of preventing fertilisation:--       (1) _The chemical method_, that is, the destruction of the male      cells (spermatazoa) by means of a suitable germicidal substance,      such as many of the disinfectants; and       (2) _The mechanical method_, that is, the adoption of measures      which keep the male and the female cells apart from one another.  [Illustration: INNER SIDE OF THIGH.  DIAGRAM 1.--Female organs of generation in normal condition. This shows diagrammatically the position of the organs if a woman were cut in two between the thighs. The rubber pessary is shown in position, slightly distending upper end of vagina (or front passage), and covering the opening into interior of womb. A suppository introduced beforehand will dissolve and occupy the dotted space above rubber pessary, forming a pool around the mouth of the womb. The walls of the vagina are elastic and collapsible. Infection with gonorrhoea may occur in the female urethra (or water passage) or in the vagina, etc. Syphilis may infect internal and external parts of female organs; also breasts, mouth, tongue, etc., and other openings of the body.]  Neither of these two methods in practical application by ordinary women can be said to be _completely certain_. Both are apt to fail at times. The chemical method, that is, the application by the woman of a suitable soluble contraceptive suppository before connection, or of a germicidal douche (such as a dilute solution of lysol) after connection, or both these measures taken consecutively, may fail because of some fault in application, or because the seminal fluid actually enters the womb during intercourse; that is to say, when emission takes place, the end of the male organ may be exactly opposite and close to the mouth of the womb, and the spermatazoa in the seminal fluid enter directly into the womb, and cannot then be removed or destroyed by douching or contraceptives of any kind. Now if the physical conformation of the reproductive organs of the husband and the wife render this event possible or probable, then soluble suppositories and contraceptive douching are alike unreliable, by themselves or in combination. On the other hand, the mechanical method, that is, the use of a rubber protector, preferably the spiral-spring occlusive[G] \"Dutch\" pessary, by the woman may also fail, because the protector is porous or ill-fitting. But--_if the two methods are combined_, the chemical method and the mechanical method, _then the protection against fertilisation may be regarded as almost absolute_. The completeness of the protection depends, of course, upon the proper application and combination of the measures advised.  [Footnote G: Judging by certain original letters (dated December, 1888, to November, 1892), which I have seen myself, by the courtesy of Messrs. E. Lambert & Son, of 60, Queen's Road, Dalston, London, E.8, the rubber spring pessary was first suggested here by an English doctor, and manufactured for him by Mr. E. Lambert Sen. Under date December 23rd, 1888, the doctor wrote:--  \"I think highly of the watch-spring rim. There will be very little fear of conception with one of these new pessaries properly adjusted, as the rim will press equally all round. The inflated pessary would be the most perfect, however, if you could only contrive some method to prevent escape of air and consequent flattening.

DIAGRAM 2.--The Fallopian tubes and ovaries are not shown on Diagram 1. There are two ovaries and two Fallopian tubes, one on each side of the uterus. The female cells or ova are formed in the ovaries and discharged into the Fallopian tubes, along which they travel into the uterus. It is believed that the union of the male with the female cell usually occurs in the Fallopian tubes, but that it may occur in the uterus.]  [Illustration: DIAGRAM 3.--This diagram shows the male urethra or passage down the male organ as somewhat distended. Generally, the walls of this passage are collapsed together. The seminal fluid is discharged down the urethra and emitted at orifice marked \"meatus.\" The small glands indicated are especially liable to be infected with gonorrhoea germs, but infection may occur almost throughout the entire length of the male passage. Infection with syphilis may occur on the outside of the male organs and elsewhere.]  I have discussed the various measures fully with leading medical authorities in London and Paris and elsewhere during the last five years, and have gradually evolved the recommendations made here, and these recommendations have the highest medical and scientific support and approval. Other methods than those recommended are referred to in Appendix I; to enumerate here those that have been eliminated would be purposeless and confusing. We are satisfied that we have selected the least harmful and most reliable methods known to science yet. These methods and these only will be explained and recommended. Everything possible has been done to make the methods _acceptable to women_.   UNATTAINABLE CONDITIONS.  Before detailing these methods, I want to ask every woman to rid her mind of certain false hopes and impossible demands. It is no use asking for something which gives no trouble at all, which costs nothing, and which is at the same time absolutely certain to prevent conception. These conditions are unattainable. But almost absolute control of her reproductive functions is most certainly attainable by every careful, intelligent woman willing to spend a good deal less time and money over her sexual toilet than she now spends over the care of her teeth, for example.   SEXUAL TOILET OUTFIT.  To begin with, it is necessary to obtain suitable sexual toilet outfit, and the requirements for this are as follows:--  Enamel bidet, soluble suppositories, suitable syringe, and properly-fitting rubber pessary. These are illustrated on pages 38 and 43.  [Illustration: Diagram 4]   GENERAL CONDITIONS.  1. _Cleanliness._--Sexual control is largely a matter of sexual cleanliness. We must all learn to keep the genital passages cleansed in the same way as we keep all the other openings of the body clean. The ears, eyes, nostrils, mouth, anus, orifice to the urethra, and the vagina should be appropriately cleansed daily. The openings of the body which stand most in need of daily cleansing are the anus and the vagina, and yet many women fail to cleanse these properly at all. Every home should have a suitable bidet (preferably fitted into the bath-room, with hot and cold water attached), and every member of the family should be trained from childhood to use the bidet, night and morning, with the same care and regularity as they use their sponge or toothbrush. All over the Continent and in the United States of America this is done in well-ordered households nowadays, but hardly anywhere in the British Empire is it done at all.  2. _Soluble Suppositories._--Generally speaking, the soluble quinine pessaries or suppositories which are sold in the shops are unreliable. Several brands have recently been analysed and found to contain no quinine at all--or particular pessaries have been without sufficient quinine. Quinine is fatal to the spermatazoa, and without it these pessaries are simply pieces of soluble cocoa-butter. Cocoa-butter is the substance generally chosen for cheap soluble pessaries, because it is easily obtainable, and has what is called a sharp melting point--that is, it dissolves or melts very suddenly and readily at body-heat, but is solid below that heat. Cocoa-butter in itself is quite harmless--usually non-irritating (unless it is \"rancid\")--and it gives some mechanical protection, in the same way as vaseline or any kind of fat or oil would do, provided, of course, it is in the right place to catch and entangle the spermatazoa and thus prevent their uniting with the ovum. Research and experiment have proved conclusively that no spermatazoa--indeed, _no microbes or germs of any kind--can pass through a film of oil_. But if the protective covering of grease is incomplete at any point, it may there prove ineffective, and there is no chemical protection whatever if the particular germicide relied upon, such as quinine, has been omitted. Quinine is sometimes omitted on the ground of expense, and sometimes because it proves irritating to many women. Only really suitable suppositories, guaranteed to be made in accordance with accredited medical formulæ, should be used. These suppositories should be composed of specially selected and tested fats, should be soothing and cleansing, as well as protective; should be stainless, odourless, and quite non-irritating. If they do cause any woman discomfort temporarily, vaseline or soap-suds could be substituted, but might not be quite so certain to prevent conception.  3. _Syringe._--The ordinary enema is not a particularly suitable appliance for the purpose of douching. The kind of syringe required is one which will not only flood the vaginal passage with warm water or very weak antiseptic lotion (such as dilute solution of lysol), but one which is sufficiently large for the contents on injection to distend slightly the walls of the vagina, straighten out their folds and furrows, and thus let the cleansing and protecting lotion touch every part as far as possible. A movable rubber flange is necessary to act as a stopper at the mouth of the vagina, and thus enable the woman to retain the lotion for a minute or so. Care should be taken, when filling the syringe, to express all the air from it--by filling and refilling it two or three times with the nozzle under water; otherwise the first thing put into the vagina would not be warm water or antiseptic lotion, but simply a large bubble of air.  4. _Soluble Suppositories and Rubber Pessaries._--It is quite true that the use of a suitable soluble suppository alone may be sufficient to protect against impregnation, but the protection by this means does undoubtedly fail at times, and therefore, by itself, the soluble suppository is unreliable. Still it eliminates the majority of the chances of impregnation. The use of the rubber pessary is also sometimes unsuccessful because it does not fit properly, or because it is porous, or because in removing it some of the seminal fluid from the under-surface may be accidentally spilt in the vagina, and in this way the spermatazoa may later find their way upwards to an ovum. Therefore, the soluble suppository and the rubber pessary should be used in combination. A woman should first push up, as far as possible, a suitable suppository, and then insert the rubber pessary (slightly soaped--with soap-suds), so as to occlude the whole of the upper part of her genital passage and thus cover the mouth of the womb and effectively prevent entrance of the spermatazoa. The rubber pessary _must_ in the first instance be fitted by a doctor, because if it does not fit properly it will be ineffective. The seminal fluid may pass by its loose rim and impregnation may result. If the rubber pessary has been properly fitted, and _it is not porous_, the protection should be complete; but if, by any accident, spermatazoa should get beyond the rubber pessary, they will be destroyed and tangled in the melted suppository--provided, of course, that a suitable suppository has been used. It is all a question of getting the right articles to begin with and using them intelligently. But there is this chance--a bare chance--of accidental impregnation, and we want to eliminate all chances, if possible. Assuming the rubber pessary fits properly, as it will if skilfully selected and applied in the first instance by a competent medical practitioner, then the seminal fluid must remain in the lower part of the vaginal passage. An hour or two after intercourse, or next morning, this seminal fluid can all be washed away by the use of syringe and bidet. It is far better to sit over the bidet and syringe in that position than to squat down over a basin--an uncomfortable and unsuitable position for douching, because the walls of the vagina in that position may be pressed hard together. The fluid should be retained in the vagina for a minute or two, by pressing the flange of syringe closely against the orifice of the vagina. _After syringing, but not before_, the rubber pessary should be removed (to be washed with soap and water, dried carefully, and put away till required again), and immediately after removing the rubber pessary it is a good plan to facilitate the ejection of the surplus fat of the suppository by urinating and re-syringing. It is quite easy for a woman to insert and remove these rubber pessaries for herself as occasion requires, provided that whilst inserting and removing the pessary she has placed her body in a suitable posture--say, lying on the back with knees drawn up, sitting on bidet, or standing with one foot on a chair, or whatever other position she finds suitable. A doctor's help is needed only when first selecting the right size of pessary. The pessaries are made in ten different sizes, each size being numbered, and the right size can always be obtained on order. No harm may come from wearing the pessary for a day or two, but it is highly desirable as a matter of cleanliness and otherwise to remove the"]]]
