It was a merry, merry meeting.  \"You dee papa bringed you--didn't him, Dotty?\" said Katie, flying at her cousin with the feather duster, as soon as Grace had taken away the umbrella, and pointing her remarks with the end of the handle.  \"You's Uncle Eddard's baby--that's what is it.\"  \"O, you darling Flyaway!\" said Dotty, \"if you _wouldn't_ stick that handle right _into_ my eyes!\"  \"I's going to give you sumpin!\" returned Katie, putting her hand in her pocket, and producing a very soft orange, which had been used for a football. \"It's a ollinge. _You_ can eat um, 'cause I gived um to you.\"  \"Thank you, O, thank you. Flyaway: how glad I am to see you! You look just the same, and no different.\"  \"O, no, I'm is growin' homely,\" replied the baby, cheerfully, \"velly homely; Hollis said so.\"  By the time Dotty's crushed hat was off, and she had made herself ready for tea, trying to hide three of the six grease-spots with her hands, Horace appeared with a little birch switch across his shoulder, strung with fish. The fish were few and small; but Horace was just as tired, he said, as if he had caught a whale. He did not say he was glad to see his young cousin; but joy shone all over his face.  \"We'll have times--won't we, little Topknot?\" said he, taking Katie up between his fingers, as if she had been a pinch of snuff.  \"Is you _found_ of ollinges, Dotty?\" asked Flyaway, with an anxious glance at the yellow fruit in Dotty's hand, still untasted.  After tea the orange lay on the lounge.  \"I's goin' to give you a ollinge,\" said Katie, presenting it again, as if it were a new one. But after she had given it away three times, she thought her duty was done.  \"If you please um,\" said she, coaxingly, \"I dess _I'll_ eat a slice o' that ollinge.\"  So she had the whole.  \"Dotty, have you seen Phebe?\" asked Horace.  \"No; where does she live?\"  \"O, out in the kitchen. Prudy saw her when she was here, ever so long ago. She hasn't faded any since.\"  \"O, now I remember, she's a niggro, as black as a _sip_.\"  \"Yes; come out and see her. She's famous for making candy. She learned that of Barby.\"  \"Who is Barby?\"  \"The Dutch girl we had before Katinka came.\"  Dotty went into the kitchen with Horace to watch the candy-making. This was a favorite method with him of entertaining visitors.  [Illustration: MAKING MOLASSES CANDY.--Page 92.]  Phebe Dolan was a young colored girl, who had a very desirable home at Mrs. Clifford's, but who always persisted in going about the house in a dejected manner, as if some one had treated her unkindly. For all that, she was very happy; and under her solemn face was a deal of quiet fun.  Katinka Dinkelspiel was a good-natured German girl, with a face as round as a full moon, and eyes as expressive as two blots of blue paint. She wore her fair hair rolled in front on each side into a puff like a capital O. Dotty looked at her in surprise. She was very unlike Norah, who wore bright ribbons on her head. And Katinka talked broken English, stirring up her words in such a way that the sentences were like Chinese puzzles; they needed to be taken apart and put together differently.  \"Please to make the door too,\" she said to Horace; and it was half a minute before Dotty understood that she was asking him to shut it.  \"This is my cousin Dotty Dimple, girls; the handsomest of the family; but not the best one--are you, though?\" at the same time giving Miss Dimple a chair.  \"How d'ye, miss?\" said Phebe, mournfully.  Katinka said nothing, but patted the letter O on the right side of her head.  \"O, Phib, my mother says if you are not too tired, you may make some candy; she said so, candidly.\"  Horace was just old enough to delight in puns.  Now, this was a pleasant message to Phebe; she would have been glad to keep her fingers in molasses half the time. Still it seemed to Dotty, as she saw the rolling of the black eyes, that Phebe was quite discouraged.  \"I s'pose she doesn't like candy,\" thought she; \"I heard of a girl once that didn't.\"  Rolling her sad eyes again and again, Phebe went to draw the molasses, and soon had it boiling on the stove.  \"There,\" said Horace, rubbing his hands, \"I told Dotty if anybody knew how to make candy 'twas Phebe Dolan. Give us the nut-cracker, and I'll have the pecans ready in no time.\"  This time Phebe's eyes twinkled. As soon as the molasses would pour from the spoon in just the right way, with little films like spiders' webs floating from it, then Phebe said it was done, and Horace called Grace and Cassy. Phebe stirred in some soda with an air of solemnity, then poured half the contents of the kettle into a buttered platter, and the other half into a second platter lined with pecan-meats. Then she took the whole out of doors to cool.  \"I'll tell you what I'm thinking about,\" said Dotty, as the girl left the room;--\"what has she got on her head?\"  \"Why, hair, to be sure,\" replied Grace.  \"Wool, I should call it,\" corrected Horace.  \"Because I didn't know,\" faltered Dotty,--\"I didn't know but 'twas a wig.\"  \"What made you think 'twas a wig, Dotty?\"  \"O, there was a man wore one in the cars; it looked just like anybody's hair, only he tied it on with a button. He knew you and Horace.\"  \"Me and Horace? Who could it have been?\"  \"He's the major; his name is Lazelle.\"  \"O, I remember him,\" said Grace and Horace together. \"Does he wear a wig? He isn't old at all.\"  \"He _calls_ himself 'an old mustache,'\" returned Dotty, \"for he said so to me. He wears one of those _hair-lips_, and a wig.\"  \"And he's as blind as a post?\"  \"O, no, he can see things now. I liked him, for he gave me all the apples and peaches I could eat.\"  \"I reckon it did him good to go to the war,\" exclaimed Horace, \"for I remember, when I was a little fellow, how he boxed my ears!\"  \"He has suffered a great deal since then,\" said the gentle Cassy, thoughtfully. \"You know people generally grow better by suffering.\"  \"Dotty dear, you can't keep your eyes open,\" said Grace, after the candy had been pulled. \"I don't believe it will make _you_ any better to suffer. I'm going to put you to bed.\"  \"And here I am,\" thought Dotty, as she laid her tired head on the pillow, \"out West, under a sketo bar. Got here safe. I ought to have thanked God a little harder in my prayer.\"     CHAPTER VII.  WAKING UP OUT WEST.   Dotty was wakened next morning by a variety of sounds. The mocking-bird, the canary, the hens, and Horace's guinea pig were astir, and wished their little world to be aware of it. Flyaway was dressed and running about, making herself generally useful.  Before the tired young traveller knew where she was, a little hand was busy at the door knob, and a baby voice called out,--  \"Dottee, Dottee, is you waked up?\"  \"O, now I know where I am! This is Aunt 'Ria's house, and that little snip of a Flyaway is trying to get in. O, dear, dear, how far off I am! Prudy Parlin, I wonder if you're thinking about me?\"  \"Dottee! Dottee!\" called the small voice again.  \"O, I s'pose that baby'll stand at the door all day.\"  But just then the knob turned, and in rushed Flyaway out of breath.  \"Good-morning, Miss Topknot,\" said Dotty, addressing her by one of the dove-names Horace was so fond of using.  \"O, I's pitty well,\" replied Flyaway, dancing across the room. \"I didn't sleep any till las' night. I d'eamed awtul d'eams; so I kep' awake, and wouldn't go to sleep.\"  And into bed climbed the little one, laying her head, with its tangled floss, right across Dotty's face.  \"Dear me!\" sighed Dotty, rubbing the floss out of her eyes. \"Such hair! I should think _you_ wore a wig! I'm sleepy; can't you let me be?\"  \"You mus' wake up, Dottee! _I_ love to wake up; I can do it velly easy.\"  Dotty, losing her patience, moved forward, pushing Katie towards the edge of the bed.  \"O, ho! what a little bedstick! I'll yole out!\"  \"I wish you would, Flyaway Clifford!\"  No sooner said than done. Off rolled Flyaway, but alighted on her feet.  \"O, my shole,\" cried she, scrambling in again; \"I fell down backboards. O, ho!\"  Such good nature was not to be resisted. Sleepy Dotty waked up and smiled in spite of herself; and next minute her persecutor was skipping down stairs.  \"Glad she's gone. Now I'll put on my pretty morning dress; Aunt 'Ria hung it up in the closet. I'm going to be a little lady all the time I'm out West, and not jump off of things and tear my clothes.\"  Then Dotty's mind strayed to a very different subject.  \"It is so queer God is in this country just the same as He is in the State of Maine! I said my prayers to Him before I started, and there He was and heard; and now He's here and hears too; I don't see how. You can't think without He sees your thoughts.\"  Dotty, brushing her hair, looked in the glass so intently that she did not observe her Aunt Maria, who had quietly entered the room. Mrs. Clifford was a wise woman, but she could not look into her niece's heart. She thought Dotty was admiring her own beauty in the mirror, whereas the child was not thinking of it at all.  What Mr. Beecher once said of little folks is very true:--  \"Ah, well, there is a world of things in children's minds that grown-up people do not understand, though they too once were young.\"  Mrs. Clifford went up to Dotty and kissed her. Then the little girl was startled from her musings, and passing down stairs with her hand in Mrs. Clifford's, thought she should be perfectly happy if dear Prudy were only on the other side of her.  Everything she saw that was new or strange she had to stop and admire, thinking it was an article that could only belong out West.  \"O, auntie, what is this queer little thing with doors?\"  \"Grace's cabinet, dear.\"  \"Her _cabijen_,\" exclaimed Flyaway, darting in from the next room.  \"Good morning, Dotty Dimple,\" said Horace: \"did my Guinea pig wake you? I lost him out. What a noise he made!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16383"],["title","Dotty Dimple Out West (#7)"],["body"," I wish he was in Guinea, where he came from.\"  Dotty had never seen a Guinea pig. It was another curiosity, which promised to be more remarkable than Phebe or Katinka. She began to think coming West was like having one long play-day. Even the dining-room was a novelty, with the swinging fan suspended over the table to keep off flies.  \"I have been wondering,\" said Mrs. Clifford, as she urned the coffee, \"how we shall amuse our little Dotty while she is here.\"  \"Fishing,\" suggested Horace.  \"Nutting,\" said Grace.  \"_Prudy_ went to a _wedding_ when she was in Indiana,\" remarked Dotty, in a low voice.  \"We will try to get up a wedding then,\" said Horace; \"but they are a little out of fashion now.\"  \"We have been thinking,\" observed Mrs. Clifford, \"of a nutting excursion for to-day. How would you like it, Edward?\"  \"Very much,\" replied Mr. Parlin. \"I can spend but one day with you, and I would as lief spend it nutting as in any other way.\"  \"Only one day, Uncle Edward!\" cried Grace and Horace.  \"Only one day, papa!\" stammered Dotty, feeling like a little kitten who _did_ have her paw on a mouse, but sees the mouse disappear down a hole.  \"O, I shall leave you, my daughter. You will stay here a week or two, and meet me in Indianapolis.\"  Dotty was able to eat once more.  \"Father, what are we to do for horses to go nutting with?\" spoke up Horace. \"Robin raked this part of town yesterday with a fine-tooth comb, and couldn't find anything but an old clothes' horse, and that was past travelling.\"  \"My son!\"  Mr. Clifford's face said very plainly,--  \"Not so flippant, my child!\"  But the only remark he made was to the effect that there were doubtless horses to be found in the city at the stables.  \"What about the infant, mamma?\" said Grace. \"Is she to be one of the party?\"  When Katie was present she was sometimes mysteriously mentioned as \"the infant.\" It was quite an undertaking to allow her to go; but Mrs. Clifford had yielded the point an hour or two before, out of regard to Horace's feelings. She knew the nutting party would be spoiled for him if his beloved little Topknot were left out.  \"Is I goin'?\" asked she, when she heard the joyful news. \"Yes, I'm _are_ goin' to get some horse.\"  \"No, some pecans, you little Brown-brimmer.\"  Katie had a dim suspicion that she owed this pleasure to her brother's influence.  \"Hollis,\" said she, eagerly,--\"Hollis, you may have the red part o' my apple.\"  This sounded like the very fulness of generosity, but was a hollow mockery; for by the \"red part\" she only meant the skin.  Mr. Clifford had one horse, and while Robin Sherwood was going to the city for another, Mrs. Clifford made ready the lunch.  Happy Dotty walked about, twirling a lock of her front hair, and watched Katinka cleaning the already nice paint, spilling here and there \"little drops of water, little grains of sand.\" She also observed the solemn yet dextrous manner in which Phebe washed the breakfast dishes, and looked on with peculiar interest as Aunt Maria filled the basket.  First there were custards to be baked in little cups and freckled with nutmeg, to please Uncle Edward. Then there was a quantity of eggs to be boiled hard. As Mrs. Clifford dropped these one by one into a kettle of water, Katie ran to the back door, and cried out to the noisy hens,--  \"Stop cacklerin', chickie; we've got 'em.\"  Then, fearing she had not made herself understood, she added,--  \"We've found your _aigs_, chickie; they was ror, but we's goin' to bake 'em.\"  Dotty was impressed with the beauty of the picnic basket and the delicacy of the food. Everything she saw was rose-colored to-day.  \"O, Aunt 'Ria, I should think you'd like to live out West! Such splendid fruit cake!\"  \"I saw Fibby and my mamma make that,\" said Flyaway, \"out o' cindamon and little clovers.\"  \"Clovers in cake?\"  \"Not red and white clovers; them little bitter kinds you know,\" added the child, with a wry face.  There were four for each carriage. Dotty rode with her father, Mrs. Clifford, and Katie. Little Flyaway looked at the hired phaeton with contempt.  \"It hasn't any cap on, like my papa's,\" said she; but she was prevailed upon to ride in it because her mamma did.  Horace went with his father and the \"cup and saucer,\" as he called Grace and Cassy. He was in a state of irritation because his idolized Topknot was in the other carriage.  \"You can't separate that cup and saucer,\" growled he to himself. \"They'll sit and talk privacy, I suppose; and I might have had Brown-brimmer if it hadn't been for Cassy.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  GOING NUTTING.   As they drove along \"the plank road,\" farther and farther away from the city, Dotty saw more clearly than ever the wide difference between Indiana and Maine.  \"Why, papa,\" said she, \"did you ever breathe such a dust? It seems like snuff.\"  \"It makes us almost as invisible as the 'tarn cap' we read of in German fairy tales,\" said Mrs. Clifford, tucking her brown veil under her chin.  She and Mr. Parlin both encouraged Dotty to talk; for they liked to hear her exclamations of wonder at things which to them seemed common-place enough.  \"What did you call this road, Aunt 'Ria? Didn't you say it was made of boards? I don't see any boards.\"  \"The planks were put down so long ago, Dotty, that they are overlaid with earth.\"  \"But what did they put them down for?\"  \"You musser ask so many kestions, Dotty,\" said Flyaway, severely; \"you say 'what' too many times.\"  \"The planks were laid down, Dotty, on account of the depth of the mud.\"  \"Mud, Aunt 'Ria?\"  \"Yes, dear, dusty as it is now, at some seasons of the year the roads are so muddy that you might lose off your overshoes if it were not for the large beams which bridge over the crossings.\"  \"That reminds me,\" said Mr. Parlin, \"of the man who was seen sinking in the mud, and, when some one offered to help him out, he replied, cheerfully, 'O, I shall get through; I have a horse under me.'\"  \"Why, was the horse 'way down out of sight, papa?\"  \"Where was the hossy, Uncle Eddard?\"  \"It was only a story, children. If the man said there was a horse under him, it was a figure of speech, which we call hyperbole; he only meant to state in a funny way that the mud was excessively deep.\"  \"Is it right to tell hyperblees, papa? Because Jennie Vance tells them a great deal. I didn't know the name of them before.\"  \"No, Alice, it is not right to tell untrue things expecting to be believed--of course not.\"  \"Well, _she_ isn't believed. Nobody s'poses her mamma made a bushel of currant wine last summer, unless it's a baby, that doesn't know any better.\"  \"_I_ knows better. I'se a goorl, and can walk,\" said little Katie, bridling.  \"I didn't say you _were_ a baby, you precious Flyaway! Who's cunning?\"  \"_I'm_ is,\" replied the child, settling back upon the seat with a sigh of relief. She was very sensitive on the point of age, and, like Dotty, could not abide the idea of being thought young.  \"How far are we going?\" asked Mr. Parlin.  \"I do not know exactly,\" replied Mrs. Clifford; \"but I will tell you how far Mr. Skeels, one of our oldest natives, calls it. He says 'he reckons it is three screeches.'\"  \"How far is a 'screech,' pray?\"  \"The distance a human voice can be heard, I presume.\"  \"Let us try it,\" said Dotty Dimple; and she instantly set up a scream so loud that the birds in the trees took to their wings in alarm. Katie chimed in with a succession of little shrieks about as powerful as the peep of a little chicken.  \"I have heard that they once measured distances by 'shoots,'\" said Mrs. Clifford, laughing; \"but I hope it will not be necessary to illustrate _them_ by firing a gun.\"  They next passed on old and weatherworn graveyard.  \"This,\" said Mrs. Clifford, \"was once known, in the choice language of the backwoodsmen, as a 'briar-patch;' and when people died, it was said they 'winked out.'\"  \"'Winked out,' Aunt 'Ria? how dreadful!\"  \"Wing tout,\" echoed Katie; \"how defful!\"  \"O, what beautiful, beautiful grass we're riding by, auntie! When the wind blows it, it _winks_ so softly! Why, it looks like a green river running ever so fast.\"  \"That is a sort of prairie land, dear, and very rich. Look on the other side of the road, and tell me what you think of those trees.\"  \"O, Aunt 'Ria, I couldn't climb up there, nor a boy either! It would take a pretty spry squirrel--wouldn't it, though?\"  \"A pitty sp'y squirrel, I fink,\" remarked Katie, who did not consider any of Dotty's sentences complete until she herself had added a finishing touch.  \"They are larger than our trees, Alice.\"  \"O, yes, papa. They look as if they grew, and grew, and forgot to stop.\"  \"Velly long trees, tenny rate,\" said Katie, throwing up her arms in imitation of branches, and jumping so high that her mother was obliged to take her in her lap in order to keep her in the carriage.  \"And, O, papa, it is so smooth between the trees, we can peep like a spy-glass, right through! Why, it seems like a church.\"  \"_I_ don't see um,\" said Katie, stretching her neck and looking in vain for a church.  \"'The groves were God's first temples,'\" repeated Mr. Parlin, reverently. \"These trees have no undergrowth of shrubs, like our New England trees.\"  \"But, O, look! look, papa! What is that long green _dangle_, dripping down from up high? No, swinging up from down low?'  \"Yes, what is um, Uncle Eddard?\"  \"That is a mistletoe-vine embracing a hickory tree. It is called a 'tree-thief,' because it steals its food from the tree it grows upon.\"  \"Why, papa, I shouldn't think 'twas a thief, for the tree knows it. A thief comes in the night, when there doesn't anybody know it. _I_ should think 'twas a _beggar_.\"  \"_I_ fink so too,\" said Flyaway, straining her eyes to look at she knew not what. \"I fink um ought to ask _pease_.\"  \"All this tract of country where we are riding now,\" said Mrs. Clifford, \"was overflowed last spring by the river. It is called 'bottom land,' and is extremely rich.\"  \"I never thought the Hoojers had a very clean, blue,"]]]
