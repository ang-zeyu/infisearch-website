At this a subdued titter came from Frances and Jessica. Mary Ethel's face grew red and she frowned at them.  \"Just at this moment in ran Johnny.  He had put on his best suit.  His yellow hair was freshly brushed and his face was wreathed in smiles. He reminded one of a dancing sunbeam.  It was wonderful to see how quickly he set the social wheel moving in the parlor.  In three minutes he had them all acquainted and talking to each other.  At one side I noticed Naomi and Jessica who were trying to make the parrot talk for the big girl.  Mary Ethel was turning the crank of a small music box, around which were clustered a group of the stranger children.  On a sofa three or four others had the portfolio of pictures spread out. Others came to my cage coaxing me to whistle for them, while Johnny capered hither and thither and joked and had more funny things to say than anybody in the room.  When he let Bessie out of her cage and put her on the piano to sing the 'Mocking Bird,' the joy of the visitors knew no bounds.  \"'Have you a parrot, Jeannette?' he asked one of the little barefooted girls, whose dancing black eyes showed how much she enjoyed Bessie's performance.  \"'No, but I have two lovely cats.'  She made the announcement as if very proud of their ownership.  \"'I have a cat too.   He dresses in black and wears long white whiskers, and looks just like a respectable old colored man.'  This description amused the children very much.  \"'What's your cat's name?' they shouted.  \"'Jett.  What do you call your cats, Jeannette?'  \"'The big one is _Boule de Neige_ and the little one is _Jaune Jaquette_.'  \"'What queer names!'  exclaimed Mary Ethel.  'How did you happen to select such names for them?'  \"'Oh, miss, because the names do suit them so well.'  \"'They don't sound like any cats' names that ever I heard.  I don't understand how they would suit.'  Mary Ethel looked perplexed.  \"'Why, miss, on account of the color of those cats, to be sure,' said Jeannette in surprise.  \"'Pooh!' explained Johnny, 'that's easy.  _Boule de neige_ is the French for snowball, and _jaune_ means yellow, so _jaune jaquette_ means yellow jacket.  I learned that in our French reader.  I expect one of the cats is all white and the other is a yellow one.  Is that it, Jeannette?'  \"'Yes, sir,' said the French child, and she tipped him a polite little bow that was very pretty indeed.  \"'_Boule de Neige_! what a funny name.  I haven't named our white kitten yet.  I believe I'll call it _Boule de Neige_ for a change,' said Karl.  \"Then Jett was brought in and Bessie pounced upon him for a ride, she chuckling and singing and looking from side to side with proud satisfaction, knowing she was being observed by everybody.  The children almost screamed with delight at this performance.  \"'Now, Bessie,' said Johnny, as the poor cat at last shook her off and slank away.  'You did that beautifully, and you deserve something to eat.  I am going to let you have some bread and milk right here in the parlor, and the company can see how nicely you can feed yourself with a spoon.'  \"'All right,' croaked the parrot.  Sarah brought in a saucer in which was a little bread moistened with milk, and two spoons with it.  A cloth was spread over one corner of the table and Bessie crawled up to the top of a chair which had been placed with its back close to the table.  This brought the bird almost in line with the saucer.  Johnny took his seat beside her and broke the bread into tiny pieces with his spoon, shoving the particles into the other spoon as fast as Bessie disposed of them.  She gravely clasped her spoon with one claw and brought it to her mouth quite dextrously and ate the contents with evident relish, though it was plain that she enjoyed being admired for being able to do it really more than she enjoyed the bread.  Once in a while her grasp was uncertain and the food was spilled on her breast feathers or fell to the floor.  At this she scolded herself roundly and seemed quite ashamed.  \"'One of these days, when I get time, I am going to train her to use a napkin when she eats,' said Johnny.  \"'She'll be a perfectly accomplished lady then,' added Mary Ethel.  \"By this time some of the stranger children had left the table and had come over to my cage to look at me.  \"'The admiral's an awful purty feller,' said one.  \"'Wouldn't his tail be sweet on a Sunday hat?' suggested another.  \"'Oh, I choose his wings for my hat,' exclaimed a third.  \"'I choose his head and breast for mine,' said the first one who had spoken.  'And Naomi chooses his whole body for her hat, I expect,' she added as Naomi joined them.  \"'No,' said Naomi, 'we don't wear birds any more in our family.  My sister and I used to have our hats trimmed with them, but we've quit. I had a lovely one on my blue velvet hat last year.  It was a beautiful hat,\" and she smiled at the recollection.  'But we've quit now,' she added gravely.  \"'Why?' asked the other girls in a breath.  \"'Oh, because my mother thinks it is wrong to wear them.  Little boy, little boy, be careful or you'll let the bird out,' she called hastily.  \"But the warning was too late.  While the girls had been talking the small boy who was with them had been entertaining himself by slightly opening my cage door and letting it spring back to its fastening. Suddenly he was seized with fright at discovering that it had stuck while half-way back, and refused to come together.  \"Oh, dear!' he called.  'He's out.'  \"'Mercy on us!  Oh, dear!' screamed the girls as I made a dash through the opening, and flew to the top of a picture frame.  'Johnny, Johnny, your redbird's out,' they called.  \"All was confusion in an instant.  Boys and girls ran hither and thither, tumbling over each other, and over the chairs and stools, and all talking and screaming at once.  \"'Bring a broom or a flagpole, Johnny,' called Philip.  'I'll shoo him down for you while you stand underneath and catch him.'  \"'Shoo, shoo!' said Jeannette, catching her dress skirt with both hands and waving it back and forth rapidly.  In a minute all the girls were waving their dress skirts at me and saying 'shoo.'  \"'Oh, my pretty Admiral Dewey, my dear old admiral,' wailed Johnny, almost in tears.  \"I didn't wait for the broom or the flagpole to help me from the picture frame.  I balanced myself steadily and then I flew out of the open window and away into the world, without saying good-bye to anybody.  I suppose they all crowded to the window to look after me as I disappeared, for the last thing I heard was Mrs. Morris' voice saying, 'Don't, Johnny; you'll fall out if you lean over so far.  Papa will get you another bird.  Don't grieve so hard.  Don't, Johnny.'\"  \"Did you ever see Johnny afterward?\" we asked the redbird.  \"Yes, once I saw him cantering along slowly on Jock.  He could not go very fast because he was holding a great bunch of red and pink roses in one hand.  His cheeks were as pink as the flowers and his yellow hair curled up under the edge of his cap the same as it used to.  I knew him in a minute.  A great many carriages were on the street trimmed in flags and flowers.  Little flags were fastened to the horses' harness. Jock had one on each side of his head, which made him look very pretty. Children were running about carrying wreaths.  On a corner of the street where a band was playing some men were holding banners.  I heard some one say it was Decoration Day, and that everybody strewed flowers on the graves in the big cemetery that day.  I thought it was a very beautiful custom.  Through all the buzz and confusion I kept an eye on Johnny.  He didn't seem to be riding anywhere in particular, but was just looking around for the fun of the thing.  Presently he drew up to the sidewalk where a little ragged boy was leaning up against a tree. He had a wistful look, as if he would like to be taking part.  \"'Hello!' said Johnny, as he reined Jock in.  'Aren't you going to help to decorate?'  \"'Naw--ain't got any posies, I tell you.'  The boy said this in a sullen tone.  \"'Here, take these.  I brought you a big bunch so you could divide 'em with some of your friends.  There's enough for all of you boys to have a few flowers to take to the cemetery.'  Johnny extended the roses with a smile as he spoke.  \"The boy grabbed them eagerly.  'My!  You're a jolly one, I'll say that for you,' he said heartily by way of thanks, then he ran off with a whoop.  \"I saw from this action that Johnny was the same generous, kind-hearted boy he used to be, and I felt proud to have had the honor of his acquaintance.\"     CHAPTER VII  A WINTER IN THE SOUTH      I was wrong about the Phoebe bird;   Two songs it has, and both of them I've heard;   I did not know those strains of joy and sorrow   Came from one throat.   As the season advanced our May songs became less melodious until finally our music was merely a metallic but pleasant, \"chink, chink,\" and we knew we would soon be putting on our new fall attire, as toward the close of the summer our family exchange their pretty black-and-white suits, so much admired, for a becoming yellowish-brown one.  The different flocks were also now arranging for their regular winter trip to the sunny Southland, where their winters were spent.  I was very glad to know that we bobolinks were to travel only in the daytime, as that would afford us younger ones a better opportunity to see the country.  The return trip to the North is always made by night. A great many people have wondered why we do this, and those who are interested in our habits have tried to find out; but it is a secret the birds have never yet divulged, and probably never will.  The blue jays were going to remain behind, for the winters which we dreaded so much had no terrors for them.  Sometimes when we were preening our feathers under the radiant skies near the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16255"],["title","Dickey Downy: The Autobiography of a Bird (#7)"],["body","gulf, I thought of our old neighbors the jays, and fancied them in their bleak Northern home flitting about in the tops of the leafless trees, swayed by the icy winds from the upper lakes, and with perhaps but little to eat.  I would not have exchanged places with them for the world.  But my older comrades assured me the jays were not in need of my sympathy or pity.  They liked the invigorating cold and chattered merrily in the desolate boughs and enjoyed many a nice meal from under the melting snow.  The crimson dogwood berries, standing out like rosettes of coral, at which they liked to peck, also furnished them an aesthetic and sumptuous feast.  Much more to be dreaded than the winter's cold was the cruel sportsman, said my comrades.  The day of our departure came.  The concourse of birds setting out on their annual journeys was immense, and oh, what joy it was to soar aloft on buoyant pinion high up in the blue sky, over housetops and tops of trees, skimming along above rushing waters or tranquil streams in quiet meadows.  Mere existence was a keen delight.  The sense of freedom, of lightness, of airiness, was gloriously exhilarating, a delicious sensation known only to the feathered tribes of all God's creation.  Our trip took us across some densely wooded mountains, where we rested for a time.  A thick undergrowth of young saplings prevented any roads, and only occasional narrow footpaths showed that people sometimes passed that way.  The mountain was grand in its loneliness; but doubtless was a desolate spot to the settlers, whose cabins were scattered at long distances from each other in the depths of the wood.  I could imagine how cut off from the whole world the women and children in these cabins would feel, for it is natural for human beings to love society.  The perpetual stillness must have been hard to bear when months sometimes passed away, especially in the winter season, without their getting a glimpse of other human faces.  The mountains were full of wildcats too, which made their situation worse, as these fierce animals were frequently known to attack men as savagely as wolves do.  One day while we were there two travelers camped under the tree where our family was roosting.  They had evidently had a hard time making their way through the tangled undergrowth, for as one of the men flung himself down on the ground and stretched himself out at full length, he exclaimed peevishly:  \"Well, I don't want any more such experiences.  I'm dead tired; my face is all scratched with the thorns and bushes; and I haven't seen a newspaper for a week.  If the railroad company needs any more work of this kind done, they must get somebody else.\"  \"Fiddle-dee-dee!  You mustn't be so easily discouraged,\" answered the other young man, who had already set to work scraping up dry chips and pieces of bark to make a fire, \"Think of these poor mountaineers who stay here all their lives.  Your little tramp of a few days is nothing to what they do all the time and never think of complaining.  The half of them are too poor to own a mule.  They eat hog and hominy the year around, and are thankful to get it.  Their clothes are fearfully and wonderfully made, but for all that they don't give up and think life isn't worth living.\"  As the two young fellows talked on in this strain I named them Growler and Cheery, because the one was so determined to look on the dark side, while the other took a cheerful view of everything.  Growler continued to lounge on the ground, looking with careless interest at Cheery, who was preparing dinner.  The dinner was in a small tin box which he took from his coat pocket. Opening it he disclosed some eatables very compactly put in.  He took out several articles and set them on the ground in front of him.  In the box was a bottle stoutly corked containing a dark liquid, some of which he poured into a flat tin cup which formed a part of the lid of the box.  This he set over the fire, which by this time was snapping cheerily.  \"Come,\" he said.  \"Here's a lunch fit for a king.  Get up and have your share.  Maybe when your stomach is warmed up with a few ham and mustard sandwiches, some cheese and coffee, you'll be in better spirits.  These crackers are good eating too.\"  \"Fit for a king, eh?  Mighty poor kind of a king, I should say,\" growled Growler sarcastically; but he rose and flicked the leaves and twigs from his clothing before he helped himself to the coffee which was now hot.  \"One cup for two people is just one too few,\" laughed Cheery when it came his turn to take some.  \"My! but it tastes good.  There's nothing like the open air to give one an appetite.\"  \"I don't like coffee without cream,\" objected Growler, chewing moodily at his cracker.  \"Well, we'll get to Girard by to-night, and then possibly we will get a good supper.\"  While they were lunching I had observed another traveler slowly approaching through the underbrush.  Over one shoulder was slung a leather strap in which were a few books.  He carried a rifle, and from his coat pocket bulged a small package.  As he drew nearer the sound of his footsteps startled Growler who nervously upset his coffee over his shirt front.  \"What d'ye suppose he is?\" he asked of Cheery as the stranger approached.  \"I judge he's a parson, from the cut of his clothes,\" observed Cheery. Then as the new-comer advanced he called: \"Hello, friend!  Who'd 'a thought of meeting company this far back in these mountains?\"  \"This is only about eight miles from the town where I live,\" answered the gentleman, who now seated himself near them with his back against a tree, \"I know the paths through here fairly well, for I come this way several times through the summer.  But this will be my last trip for the season, and I'm giving a little more time to it on that account. I've taken it somewhat leisurely to-day.\"  He was a delicate-looking, middle-aged man, with a mild voice and a kind face.  \"You're a drummer for a publishing house, I take it?\" said Growler, nodding toward the books in the strap.  \"I've just been wondering where you'd find any buyers in these infernal woods.\"  The gentleman laughed.  \"No,\" said he, \"this is my regular route; but I'm not a commercial traveler in any sense.  I'm a pastor at a town near here, and I go out to these mountain families to hold services every few weeks.\"  \"You don't mean you foot it through these bushes and among these wildcats to preach to the mountaineers!\" exclaimed Growler in astonishment.  \"Certainly I do.  These poor people would never hear the sound of the gospel if some one did not take it to them.  They have souls to be saved, my friend.  I feel it is my duty to carry the word to them.  As for the wildcats,\" he continued, smiling, \"I have my rifle.  Besides the government offers a small bounty for every wildcat.\"  \"Oh, yes, I see.  You combine business with pleasure and have your wildcat bounty to pay expenses as you go along--or else keep it for pin-money,\" and Growler laughed good-humoredly at his own fun.  \"You're the parson from St. Thomas, I judge,\" said Cheery.  The gentleman bowed, and said he was the pastor of that little church.  \"I've heard of your mission work, and I understand you've done a great deal of good among the mountain whites.\"  \"How many churches have you in these mountains?\" interrupted Growler.  \"I have but the one church organization, for outside through the mountains there are no churches--no buildings, no organizations. People ten and fifteen miles apart can't very well have churches.  I visit the families.  I have three on this mountain side.  I am well repaid for all the sacrifice of comfort I make, in knowing how glad they are to have me come.   To many of them I am the connecting link with the rest of mankind.  Ah! the world knows nothing of the privations and sorrows and ignorance of many of these poor creatures! Through the winter I am obliged to stop my visitations, but I generally leave a few books and papers for those who can read, and pictures for the children.\"  \"Well, parson, I didn't know there was enough goodness in any man in the United States to make him willing to tramp right into the wildest part of the Allegheny.  Mountains to preach the gospel to half a dozen poor people!\" exclaimed Growler, still more astonished.  \"My friend,\" responded the gentleman earnestly, \"the world is full of Christian men and women who are trying to help others.\"  Just then my mother said to me, \"When I hear the beautiful words that minister speaks and see what he is doing, then indeed do I believe that human beings have hearts.\"  As we resumed our journey I wondered if Growler would profit by the sunshiny example of Cheery and the devotion of the parson of St. Thomas.  Later in our travels we came upon some old acquaintances.   Our stopping-place was near an ancient house on a mountain side.  The outlook was the grandest I had ever seen, and though I have traveled much since then I have never found anything to exceed it in beauty.  A glistening river wound its way in a big loop at the foot of the mountain, and beyond it lay stretched out a busy city.  A good many years before a battle had been fought on these heights, which people still remembered and talked about.  I heard them speak of it as the \"Battle above the clouds.\"  There was still a part of a cannon wagon in the yard which visitors came to see and examined with much interest.  They also often requested the landlady to let them look at the walls of an old stone dairy adjoining the house, because the soldiers had carved their names there.  To me it seemed strange that the guests would sit for hours on the long gallery of this hotel, and go over and over the incidents of the battle, telling where this regiment stood, or where that officer fell, as if war and the taking of life were the most pleasant rather than the most distressful subjects in the world.  In the distance was a mammoth field of graves, miles of graves,"]]]
