Saints or sorcerers, their horses must have come down but for him.\"  Brother Thomas caught me up, as if I had been a child, in his arms, and tossed me over the ditch-bank into the wood, where I crashed on my face through the boughs.  \"Only one horse would have fallen, and that had brought the others on us. The Scot is safe enough, his mouth is well shut.  I will have no blood to- night; leave him to the wolves.  And now, begone with you: to Fierbois, if you will; I go my own road--alone.\"  They wandered each his own way, sullen and murmuring, starved and weary. What they had seen or fancied, and whether, if the rest saw aught strange, Brother Thomas saw nought, I knew not then, and know not till this hour.  But the tale of this ambush, and of how they that lay in hiding held their hands, and fled--having come, none might say whence, and gone, whither none might tell--is true, and was soon widely spoken of in the realm of France.  The woods fell still again, save for the babble of the brook, and there I lay, bound, and heard only the stream in the silence of the night.  There I lay, quaking, when all the caitiffs had departed, and the black, chill night received me into itself.  At first my mind was benumbed, like my body; but the pain of my face, smarting with switch and scratch of the boughs through which I had fallen, awoke me to thought and fear.  I turned over to lie on my back, and look up for any light of hope in the sky, but nothing fell on me from heaven save a cold rain, that the leafless boughs did little to ward off.  Scant hope or comfort had I; my whole body ached and shuddered, only I did not thirst, for the rain soaked through the accursed napkin on my mouth, while the dank earth, with its graveyard smell, seemed to draw me down into itself, as it drags a rotting leaf.  I was buried before death, as it were, even if the wolves found me not and gave me other sepulture; and now and again I heard their long hunting cry, and at every patter of a beast's foot, or shivering of the branches, I thought my hour was come--and I unconfessed! The road was still as death, no man passing by it.  This night to me was like the night of a man laid living in the tomb.  By no twisting and turning could I loosen the rope that Brother Thomas had bound me in, with a hand well taught by cruel practice.  At last the rain in my face grew like a water-torture, always dropping, and I half turned my face and pressed it to the ground.  Whether I slept by whiles, or waked all night, I know not, but certainly I dreamed, seeing with shut eyes faces that came and went, shifting from beauty such as I had never yet beheld, to visages more and more hideous and sinful, ending at last in the worst--the fell countenance of Noiroufle.  Then I woke wholly to myself, in terror, to find that he was not there, and now came to me some of that ease which had been born of the strange, sweet voice, and the strange words, \"Mes Freres de Paradis.\"  \"My brethren of Paradise\"; who could she be that rode so late in company of armed men, and yet spoke of such great kinsfolk?  That it might be the holy Colette, then, as now, so famous in France for her miracles, and good deeds, and her austerities, was a thought that arose in me.  But the holy Sister, as I had heard, never mounted a horse in her many wanderings, she being a villein's daughter, but was carried in a litter, or fared in a chariot; nor did she go in company with armed men, for who would dare to lay hands on her?  Moreover, the voice that I had heard was that of a very young girl, and the holy Sister Colette was now entered into the vale of years.  So my questioning found no answer.  And now I heard light feet, as of some beast stirring and scratching in the trees overhead, and there with a light jingling noise.  Was it a squirrel?  Whatever it was, it raced about the tree, coming nearer and going further away, till it fell with a weight on my breast, and, shivering with cold, all strained like a harp-string as I was, I could have screamed, but for the gag in my mouth.  The thing crawled up my body, and I saw two red eyes fixed on mine, and deemed it had been a wild cat, such as lives in our corries of the north--a fell beast if brought to bay, but otherwise not hurtful to man.  There the red eyes looked on me, and I on them, till I grew giddy with gazing, and half turned my head with a stifled sob.  Then there came a sharp cry which I knew well enough, and the beast leaped up and nestled under my breast, for this so dreadful thing was no worse than the violer woman's jackanapes, that had slipped its chain, or, rather, had drawn it out of her hand, for now I plainly heard the light chain jingle.  This put me on wondering whether they had really departed; the man, verily, thirsted for my life, but he would have slain me ere this hour, I thought, if that had been his purpose.  The poor beast a little helped to warm me with the heat of his body, and he was a friendly creature, making me feel less alone in the night.  Yet, in my own misery, I could not help but sorrow for the poor woman when she found her jackanapes gone, that was great part of her living: and I knew what she would have to bear for its loss from the man that was her master.  As this was in my mind, the first grey stole into the sky so that I could see the black branches overhead; and now there awoke the cries of birds, and soon the wood was full of their sweet jargoning.  This put some hope into my heart; but the morning hours were long, and colder than the night, to one wet to the bone with the rains.  Now, too, I comforted myself with believing that, arrive what might, I was wholly quit of Brother Thomas, whereat I rejoiced, like the man in the tale who had sold his soul to the Enemy, and yet, in the end, escaped his clutches by the aid of Holy Church.  Death was better to me than life with Brother Thomas, who must assuredly have dragged me with him to the death that cannot die.  Morning must bring travellers, and my groaning might lead them to my aid.  And, indeed, foot-farers did come, and I did groan as well as I could, but, like the Levite in Scripture, they passed by on the other side of the way, fearing to meddle with one wounded perchance to the death, lest they might be charged with his slaying, if he died, or might anger his enemies, if he lived.  The light was now fully come, and some rays of the blessed sun fell upon me, whereon I said orisons within myself, commanding my case to the saints.  Devoutly I prayed, that, if I escaped with life, I might be delivered from the fear of man, and namely of Brother Thomas.  It were better for me to have died by his weapon at first, beside the broken bridge, than to have lived his slave, going in dread of him, with a slave's hatred in my heart.  So now I prayed for spirit enough to defend my honour and that of my country, which I had borne to hear reviled without striking a blow for it.  Never again might I dree this extreme shame and dishonour.  On this head I addressed myself, as was fitting, to the holy Apostle St. Andrew, our patron, to whom is especially dear the honour of Scotland.  Then, as if he and the other saints had listened to me, I heard sounds of horses' hoofs, coming up the road from Chinon way, and also voices. These, like the others of the night before, came nearer, and I heard a woman's voice gaily singing.  And then awoke such joy in my heart as never was there before, and this was far the gladdest voice that ever yet I heard, for, behold, it was the speech of my own country, and the tune I knew and the words.     \"O, we maun part this love, Willie,    That has been lang between;    There's a French lord coming over sea    To wed me wi' a ring;    There's a French lord coming o'er the sea    To wed and take me hame!\"  \"And who shall the French lord be, Elliot?\" came another voice, a man's this time, \"though he need not cross the sea for you, the worse the luck. Is it young Pothon de Xaintrailles?  Faith, he comes often enough to see how his new penoncel fares in my hands, and seems right curious in painting.\"  It may be deemed strange that, even in this hour, I conceived in my heart a great mislike of this young French lord, how unjustly I soon well understood.     \"O, nae French lord for me, father,    O, nae French lord for me,    But I'll ware my heart on a true-born Scot,    And wi' him I'll cross the sea.\"  \"Oh, father, lo you, I can make as well as sing, for that is no word of the old ballant, but just came on to my tongue!\"  They were now right close to me, and, half in fear, half in hope, I began to stir and rustle in the grass, for of my stifled groaning had hitherto come no profit.  Then I heard the horses stop.  \"What stirring is that in the wood, father?  I am afraid,\" came the girl's voice.  \"Belike a fox shifting his lair.  Push on, Maid Elliot.\"  The horses advanced, when, by the blessing of the saints, the jackanapes woke in my breast.  The creature was used to run questing with a little wooden bowl he carried for largesse, to beg of horsemen for his mistress.  This trick of his he did now, hearing the horses' tramp.  He leaped the ditch, and I suppose he ran in front of the steeds, shaking his little bowl, as was his wont.  \"Oh, father,\" sounded the girl's voice, \"see the little jackanapes!  Some travelling body has lost him.  Let me jump down and catch him.  Look, he has a little coat on, made like a herald's tabard, and wears the colours of France.  Here, hold my reins.\"  \"No, lass.  Who can tell where, or who, his owner is?  Take you my reins, and I will bring you the beast.\"  I heard him heavily dismount.  \"It will not let itself be caught by a lame man,\" he said; and he scrambled up the ditch bank, while the jackanapes fled to me, and then ran forward again, back and forth.  \"Nom Dieu, whom have we here?\" cried the man, in French.  I turned, and made such a sound with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1631"],["title","A Monk of Fife (#7)"],["body"," mouth as I might, while the jackanapes nestled to my breast.  \"Why do ye not speak, man?\" he said again; and I turned my eyes on him, looking as pitifully as might be out of my blood-bedabbled face.  He was a burly man, great of growth, with fresh red cheeks, blue eyes, reddish hair, and a red beard, such as are many in the Border marches of my own country, the saints bless them for true men!  Withal he dragged his leg in walking, which he did with difficulty and much carefulness.  He \"hirpled,\" as we say, towards me very warily; then, seeing the rope bound about me, and the cloth in my mouth, he drew his dagger, but not to cut my bonds.  He was over canny for that, but he slit the string that kept the cursed gag in my mouth, and picked it out with his dagger point; and, oh the blessed taste of that first long draught of air, I cannot set it down in words!  \"What, in the name of all the saints, make you here, in this guise?\" he asked in French, but with a rude Border accent.  \"I am a kindly Scot,\" I said in our own tongue, \"of your own country. Give me water.\"  And then a dwawm, as we call it, or fainting-fit, came over me.  When I knew myself again, I was lying with my head in a maiden's lap, and well I could have believed that the fairies had carried me to their own land, as has befallen many, whereof some have returned to earth with the tale, and some go yet in that unearthly company.  \"Gentle demoiselle, are you the gracious Queen of Faerie?\" I asked, as one half-wakened, not knowing what I said.  Indeed this lady was clad all in the fairy green, and her eyes were as blue as the sky above her head, and the long yellow locks on her shoulders were shining like the sun.  \"Father, he is not dead,\" she said, laughing as sweet as all the singing- birds in March--\"he is not dead, but sorely wandering in his mind when he takes Elliot Hume for the Fairy Queen.\"  \"Faith, he might have made a worse guess,\" cried the man.  \"But now, sir, now that your bonds are cut, I see nothing better for you than a well- washed face, for, indeed, you are by ordinary 'kenspeckle,' and no company for maids.\"  With that he brought some water from the burn by the road, and therewith he wiped my face, first giving me to drink.  When I had drunk, the maid whom he called Elliot got up, her face very rosy, and they set my back against a tree, which I was right sorry for, as indeed I was now clean out of fairyland and back in this troublesome world.  The horses stood by us, tethered to trees, and browsed on the budding branches.  \"And now, maybe,\" he said, speaking in the kindly Scots, that was like music in my ear--\"now, maybe, you will tell us who you are, and how you came into this jeopardy.\"  I told him, shortly, that I was a Scot of Fife; whereto he answered that my speech was strangely English.  On this matter I satisfied him with the truth, namely, that my mother was of England.  I gave my name but not that of our lands, and showed him how I had been wandering north, to take service with the Dauphin, when I was set upon, and robbed and bound by thieves, for I had no clearness as to telling him all my tale, and no desire to claim acquaintance with Brother Thomas.  \"And the jackanapes?\" he asked, whereto I had no better answer than that I had seen the beast with a wandering violer on the day before, and that she having lost it, as I supposed, it had come to me in the night.  The girl was standing with the creature in her arms, feeding it with pieces of comfits from a pouch fastened at her girdle.  \"The little beast is not mine to give,\" I went on, seeing how she had an affection to the ape, \"but till the owner claims it, it is all the ransom I have to pay for my life, and I would fain see it wear the colours of this gentle maid who saved me.  It has many pretty tricks, but though to- day I be a beggar, I trow she will not let it practise that ill trick of begging.\"  \"Sooner would I beg myself, fair sir,\" she said, with such a courtly reverence as surprised me; for though they seemed folks well to see in the world, they were not, methought, of noble blood, nor had they with them any company of palfreniers or archers.  \"Elliot, you feed the jackanapes and let our countryman hunger,\" said the man; and, blushing again, she made haste to give me some of the provision she had made for her journey.  So I ate and drank, she waiting on me very gently; but now, being weary of painful writing, and hearing the call to the refectory, and the brethren trampling thither, I must break off, for, if I be late, they will sconce me of my ale.  Alas! it is to these little cares of creature comforts that I am come, who have seen the face of so many a war, and lived and fought on rat's flesh at Compiegne.     CHAPTER IV--IN WHAT COMPANY NORMAN LESLIE ENTERED CHINON; AND HOW HE DEMEANED HIMSELF TO TAKE SERVICE   Not seemly, was it, that I should expect these kind people, even though they were of my own country, to do more for me than they had already done.  So, when I had eaten and drunk, I made my obeisance as if I would be trudging towards Chinon, adding many thanks, as well I might.  \"Nay, countryman,\" said the man, \"for all that I can see, you may as well bide a while with us; for, indeed, with leave of my graceless maid, I think we may even end our wild-goose chase here and get us back to the town.\"  Seeing me marvel, perhaps, that any should have ridden some four miles or five, and yet speak of returning, he looked at the girl, who was playing with the jackanapes, and who smiled at him as he spoke.  \"You must know,\" said he, \"that though I am the father of your Fairy Queen, I am also one of the gracious Princess's obedient subjects.  No mother has she, poor wench,\" he added, in a lower voice; \"and faith, we men must always obey some woman--as it seems now that the King himself must soon do and all his captains.\"  \"You speak,\" I said, \"of the gracious Queen of Sicily and Jerusalem?\"--a lady who was thought to be of much avail, as was but right, in the counsels of her son-in-law, the Dauphin, he having married her gentle daughter.  \"Ay; Queen Yolande is far ben {7} with the King--would he had no worse counsellors!\" said he, smiling; \"but I speak of a far more potent sovereign, if all that she tells of herself be true.  You have heard, or belike you have not heard, of the famed Pucelle--so she calls herself, I hope not without a warranty--the Lorrainer peasant lass, who is to drive the English into the sea, so she gives us all fair warning?\"  \"Never a word have I heard, or never marked so senseless a bruit if I heard it; she must be some moon-struck wench, and in her wits wandering.\"  \"Moon-struck, or sun-struck, or saint-struck, she will strike down our ancient enemy of England, and show you men how it is not wine and wickedness that make good soldiers!\" cried the girl whom he called Elliot, her face rose-red with anger; and from her eyes two blue rays of light shot straight to mine, so that I believe my face waxed wan, the blood flying to my heart.  \"Listen to her! look at her!\" said her father, jestingly.  \"Elliot, if your renowned maid can fright the English as you have affrayed a good Scot, the battle is won and Orleans is delivered.\"  But she had turned her back on us pettishly, and was talking in a low voice to her jackanapes.  As for me, if my face had been pale before, it now grew red enough for shame that I had angered her, who was so fair, though how I had sinned I knew not.  But often I have seen that women, and these the best, will be all afire at a light word, wherein the touchiest man-at-arms who ever fought on the turn of a straw could pick no honourable quarrel.  \"How have I been so unhappy as to offend mademoiselle?\" I asked, in a whisper, of her father, giving her a high title, in very confusion.  \"Oh, she will hear no bourde nor jest on this Pucelle that all the countryside is clashing of, and that is bewitching my maid, methinks, even from afar.  My maid Elliot (so I call her from my mother's kin, but her true name is Marion, and the French dub her Heliote) hath set all her heart and her hope on one that is a young lass like herself, and she is full of old soothsayings about a virgin that is to come out of an oak- wood and deliver France--no less!  For me, I misdoubt that Merlin, the Welsh prophet on whom they set store, and the rest of the soothsayers, are all in one tale with old Thomas Rhymer, of Ercildoune, whose prophecies our own folk crack about by the ingle on winter nights at home.  But be it as it may, this wench of Lorraine has, these three-quarters of a year, been about the Sieur Robert de Baudricourt, now commanding for the King at Vaucouleurs, away in the east, praying him to send her to the Court.  She has visions, and hears voices--so she says; and she gives Baudricourt no peace till he carries her to the King.  The story goes that, on the ill day of the Battle of the Herrings, she, being at Vaucouleurs--a hundred leagues away and more,--saw that fight plainly, and our countrymen fallen, manlike, around the Constable, and the French flying like hares before a little pack of English talbots.  When the evil news came, and was approved true, Baudricourt could hold her in no longer, and now she is on the way with half a dozen esquires and archers of his command.  The second-sight she may have--it is common enough, if you believe the red-shanked Highlanders; but if maiden she set forth from Vaucouleurs, great miracle it is if maiden she comes to Chinon.\"  He whispered this in a manner that we call \"pauky,\" being a free man with his tongue.  \"This is a strange tale enough,\" I said; \"the saints grant that the Maid speaks truly!\"  \"But yesterday came a letter of her sending to the King,\" he went on, \"but never of her writing, for they say that she knows not 'A' from 'B,' if she meets them in her voyaging.  Now, nothing would serve my wilful daughter Elliot (she being possessed, as I said, with love for this female mystery),"]]]
