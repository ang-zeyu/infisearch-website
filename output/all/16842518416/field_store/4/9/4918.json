I felt what it was to be wolfish and even ravening; and I noted, step by step, in myself, how a strange sagacity grew within me--an art of detecting food.  It was during the American war, and there were thousands of us pitifully starved.  When we came near some log hut I began at once to surmise, if I saw a flour sack lying about, that there was a mill not far distant; perhaps flour or bread in the house; while the dwellers in the hut were closely scanned to judge from their appearance if they were well fed, and of a charitable disposition.  It is a melancholy thing to recall; but it is absolutely necessary for a thinker to have once lived such a life, that he may be able to understand what is the intellectual status of those fellow beings whose whole life is simply a hunt for enough food to sustain life, and enough beer to cheer it.  I have spoken of the Gipsy fondness for the hedgehog.  Richard Liebich, in his book, _Die Zigeuner in ihrem Wesen und in ihrer Sprache_, tells his readers that the only indication of a belief in a future state which he ever detected in an old Gipsy woman, was that she once dreamed she was in heaven.  It appeared to her as a large garden, full of fine fat hedgehogs.  \"This is,\" says Mr Liebich, \"unquestionably very earthly, and dreamed very sensuously; reminding us of Mahommed's paradise, which in like manner was directed to the animal and not to the spiritual nature, only that here were hedgehogs and there houris.\"  Six or seven thousand years of hungry-marauding, end by establishing strange points of difference between the mind of a Gipsy and a well-to-do citizen.  It has starved God out of the former; he inherited unbelief from his half fed Pariah ancestors, and often retains it, even in England, to this day, with many other unmistakable signs of his Eastern- jackal origin.  And strange as it may seem to you, reader, his intercourse with Christians has all over Europe been so limited, that he seldom really knows what religion is.  The same Mr Liebich tells us that one day he overheard a Gipsy disputing with his wife as to what was the true character of the belief of the Gentiles.  Both admitted that there was a great elder grown up God (the _baro puro dewel_), and a smaller younger God (the _tikno tarno dewel_).  But the wife maintained, appealing to Mr Liebich for confirmation, that the great God no longer reigned, having abdicated in favour of the Son, while the husband declared that the Great older God died long ago, and that the world was now governed by the little God who was, however, not the son of his predecessor, but of a poor carpenter.  I have never heard of any such nonsense among the English wandering Gipsies with regard to Christianity, but at the same time I must admit that their ideas of what the Bible contains are extremely vague.  One day I was sitting with an old Gipsy, discussing Rommany matters, when he suddenly asked me what the word was in the _waver temmeny jib_, or foreign Gipsy, for The Seven Stars.  \"That would be,\" I said, \"the _Efta Sirnie_.  I suppose your name for it is the Hefta Pens.  There is a story that once they were seven sisters, but one of them was lost, and so they are called seven to this day--though there are only six.  And their right name is the Pleiades.\"  \"That _gudlo_--that story,\" replied the gipsy, \"is like the one of the Seven Whistlers, which you know is in the Scriptures.\"  \"What!\"  \"At least they told me so; that the Seven Whistlers are seven spirits of ladies who fly by night, high in the air, like birds.  And it says in the Bible that once on a time one got lost, and never came back again, and now the six whistles to find her.  But people calls 'em the Seven Whistlers--though there are only six--exactly the same as in your story of the stars.\"  \"It's queer,\" resumed my Gipsy, after a pause, \"how they always tells these here stories by Sevens.  Were you ever on Salisbury Plain?\"  \"No!\"  \"There are great stones there--_bori bars_--and many a night I've slept there in the moonlight, in the open air, when I was a boy, and listened to my father tellin' me about the Baker.  For there's seven great stories, and they say that hundreds of years ago a baker used to come with loaves of bread, and waste it all a tryin' to make seven loaves remain at the same place, one on each stone.  But one all'us fell off, and to this here day he's never yet been able to get all seven on the seven stones.\"  I think that my Gipsy told this story in connection with that of the Whistlers, because he was under the impression that it also was of Scriptural origin.  It is, however, really curious that the Gipsy term for an owlet is the _Maromengro's Chavi_, or Baker's Daughter, and that they are all familiar with the monkish legend which declares that Jesus, in a baker's shop, once asked for bread.  The mistress was about to give him a large cake, when her daughter declared it was too much, and diminished the gift by one half.           \"He nothing said,    But by the fire laid down the bread,    When lo, as when a blossom blows--    To a vast loaf the manchet rose;    In angry wonder, standing by,    The girl sent forth a wild, rude cry,    And, feathering fast into a fowl,    Flew to the woods a wailing owl.\"  According to Eilert Sundt, who devoted his life to studying the _Fanten and Tataren_, or vagabonds and Gipsies of Sweden and Norway, there is a horrible and ghastly semblance among them of something like a religion, current in Scandinavia.  Once a year, by night, the Gipsies of that country assemble for the purpose of un-baptizing all of their children whom they have, during the year, suffered to be baptized for the sake of gifts, by the Gorgios.  On this occasion, amid wild orgies, they worship a small idol, which is preserved until the next meeting with the greatest secresy and care by their captain.  I must declare that this story seems very doubtful to me.  I have devoted this chapter to illustrating from different points the fact that there lives in England a race which has given its impress to a vast proportion of our vagabond population, and which is more curious and more radically distinct in all its characteristics, than our writers, with one or two exceptions, have ever understood.  One extraordinary difference still remains to be pointed out--as it has, in fact, already been, with great acumen, by Mr George Borrow, in his \"Gipsies in Spain,\" and by Dr Alexander Paspati, in his \"Etudes sur les Tchinghianes ou Bohemiens de l'Empire Ottoman\" (Constantinople, 1870); also by Mr Bright, in his \"Hungary,\" and by Mr Simson.  It is this, that in every part of the world it is extremely difficult to get Rommany words, even from intelligent gipsies, although they may be willing with all their heart to communicate them.  It may seem simple enough to the reader to ask a man \"How do you call 'to carry' in your language?\"  But can the reader understand that a man, who is possibly very much shrewder than himself in reading at a glance many phases of character, and in countless trickeries, should be literally unable to answer such a question?  And yet I have met with many such.  The truth is, that there are people in this world who never had such a thing as an abstract idea, let us say even of an apple, plumped suddenly at them--not once in all their lives--and, when it came, the unphilosophical mind could no more grasp it, than the gentleman mentioned by G. H. Lewes (History of Philosophy), could grasp the idea of substance without attribute as presented by Berkeley.  The real Gipsy could talk about apples all day, but the sudden demand for the unconnected word, staggers him--at least, until he has had some practice in this, to him, new process.  And it is so with other races.  Professor Max Muller once told me in conversation, as nearly as I can recollect, that the Mohawk Indian language is extremely rich in declension, every noun having some sixteen or seventeen inflexions of case, but no nominative.  One can express one's relations to a father to a most extraordinary extent, among the dilapidated descendants of that once powerful tribe.  But such a thing as the abstract idea of _a_ father, or of 'father' _pur et simple_, never entered the Mohawk mind, and this is very like the Gipsies.  When a rather wild Gipsy once gives you a word, it must be promptly recorded, for a demand for its repetition at once confuses him.  _On doit saisir le mot echappe au Nomade, et ne pas l'obliger a le repeter, car il le changera selon so, facon_, says Paspati.  Unused to abstract efforts of memory, all that he can retain is the sense of his last remark, and very often this is changed with the fleeting second by some associated thought, which materially modifies it.  It is always difficult, in consequence, to take down a story in the exact terms which a philologist desires.  There are two words for \"bad\" in English Gipsy, _wafro_ and _vessavo_; and I think it must have taken me ten minutes one day to learn, from a by no means dull gipsy, whether the latter word was known to him, or if it were used at all.  He got himself into a hopeless tangle in trying to explain the difference between _wafro_ and _naflo_, or ill, until his mind finally refused to act on _vessavo_ at all, and spasmodically rejected it.  With all the patience of Job, and the meekness of Moses, I awaited my time, and finally obtained my information.  The impatience of such minds in narrative is amusing.  Let us suppose that I am asking some _kushto Rommany chal_ for a version of AEsop's fable of the youth and the cat.  He is sitting comfortably by the fire, and good ale has put him into a story-telling humour.  I begin--  \"Now then, tell me this _adree Rommanis_, in Gipsy--Once upon a time there was a young man who had a cat.\"  Gipsy.--\"_Yeckorus--'pre yeck cheirus_--_a raklo lelled a matchka_\"--  While I am writing this down, and long before it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],["title","The English Gipsies and Their Language (#4)"],["body","half done, the professor of Rommany, becoming interested in the subject, continues volubly--  --\"_an' the matchka yeck sala dicked a chillico apre a rukk_--(and the cat one morning saw a bird in a tree\"--)  I.--\"Stop, stop!  _Hatch a wongish_!  That is not it!  Now go on.  _The young man loved this cat so much_\"--  _Gipsy_ (fluently, in Rommany), \"that he thought her skin would make a nice pair of gloves\"--  \"Confound your gloves!  Now do begin again\"--  _Gipsy_, with an air of grief and injury: \"I'm sure I was telling the story for you the best way I knew how!\"  Yet this man was far from being a fool.  What was it, then?  Simply and solely, a lack of education--of that mental training which even those who never entered a schoolhouse, receive more or less of, when they so much as wait patiently for a month behind a chair, or tug for six months at a plough, or in short, acquire the civilised virtue of Christian patience. That is it.  We often hear in this world that a little education goes a great way; but to get some idea of the immense value of a very little education indeed, and the incredible effect it may have upon character, one should study with gentleness and patience a real Gipsy.  Probably the most universal error in the world is the belief that all men, due allowance being made for greater or less knowledge, or \"talents,\" have minds like our own; are endowed with the same moral perception, and see things on the whole very much as we do.  Now the truth is that a Chinese, whose mind is formed, not by \"religion\" as we understand it, but simply by the intense pressure of \"Old Custom,\" which we do not understand, thinks in a different manner from an European; moralists accuse him of \"moral obliquity,\" but in reality it is a moral difference.  Docility of mind, the patriarchal principle, and the very perfection of innumerable wise and moral precepts have, by the practice of thousands of years, produced in him their natural result.  Whenever he attempts to think, his mind runs at once into some broad and open path, beautifully bordered with dry artificial flowers, {21} and the result has been the inability to comprehend any new idea--a state to which the Church of the Middle Ages, or any too rigidly established system, would in a few thousand years have reduced humanity.  Under the action of widely different causes, the gipsy has also a different cast of mind from our own, and a radical moral difference.  A very few years ago, when I was on the Plains of Western Kansas, old Black Kettle, a famous Indian chief said in a speech, \"I am not a white man, I am a _wolf_.  I was born like a wolf on the prairies.  I have lived like a wolf, and I shall die like one.\"  Such is the wild gipsy.  Ever poor and hungry, theft seems to him, in the trifling easy manner in which he practises it, simply a necessity.  The moral aspects of petty crime he never considers at all, nor does he, in fact, reflect upon anything as it is reflected on by the humblest peasant who goes to church, or who in any way feels himself connected as an integral part of that great body-corporate--Society.     CHAPTER II.  A GIPSY COTTAGE.   The Old Fortune-Teller and her Brother.--The Patteran, or Gipsies' Road- Mark .--The Christian Cross, named by Continental Gipsies Trushul, after the Trident of Siva.--Curious English-Gipsy term for the Cross.--Ashwood Fires on Christmas Day.--Our Saviour regarded with affection by the Rommany because he was like themselves and poor.--Strange ideas of the Bible.--The Oak.--Lizards renew their lives.--Snails.--Slugs.--Tobacco Pipes as old as the world.  \"Duveleste; Avo.  Mandy's kaired my patteran adusta chairuses where a drum jals atut the waver,\" which means in English--\"God bless you, yes. Many a time I have marked my sign where the roads cross.\"  I was seated in the cottage of an old Gipsy mother, one of the most noted fortune-tellers in England, when I heard this from her brother, himself an ancient wanderer, who loves far better to hear the lark sing than the mouse cheep when he wakes of a morning.  It was a very small but clean cottage, of the kind quite peculiar to the English labourer, and therefore attractive to every one who has felt the true spirit of the most original poetry and art which this country has produced.  For look high or low, dear reader, you will find that nothing has ever been better done in England than the pictures of rural life, and over nothing have its gifted minds cast a deeper charm.  There were the little rough porcelain figures of which the English peasantry are so fond, and which, cheap as they are, indicate that the taste of your friends Lady --- for Worcester \"porcelain,\" or the Duchess of --- for Majolica, has its roots among far humbler folk.  In fact there were perhaps twenty things which no English reader would have supposed were peculiar, yet which were something more than peculiar to me.  The master of the house was an Anglo-Saxon--a Gorgio--and his wife, by some magic or other, the oracle before-mentioned.  And I, answering said--  \"So you all call it _patteran_?\" {24}  \"No; very few of us know that name.  We do it without calling it anything.\"  Then I took my stick and marked on the floor the following sign--  [Sign: ill24.jpg]  \"There,\" I said, \"is the oldest patteran--first of all--which the Gipsies use to-day in foreign lands.  In Germany, when one band of Gipsies goes by a cross road, they draw that deep in the dust, with the end of the longest line pointing in the direction in which they have gone.  Then, the next who come by see the mark, and, if they choose, follow it.\"  \"We make it differently,\" said the Gipsy.  \"This is our sign--the _trin bongo drums_, or cross.\"  And he drew his patteran thus--  [Cross: ill25.jpg]  \"The long end points the way,\" he added; \"just as in your sign.\"  \"You call a cross,\" I remarked, \"_trin bongo drums_, or the three crooked roads.  Do you know any such word as _trushul_ for it?\"  \"No; _trushilo_ is thirsty, and _trushni_ means a faggot, and also a basket.\"  \"I shouldn't wonder if a faggot once got the old Rommany word for cross,\" I said, \"because in it every stick is crossed by the wooden _withy_ which binds it; and in a basket, every wooden strip crosses the other.\"  I did not, however, think it worth while to explain to the Gipsies that when their ancestors, centuries ago, left India, it was with the memory that Shiva, the Destroyer, bore a trident, the tri-cula in Sanscrit, the _trisul_ of Mahadeva in Hindustani, and that in coming to Europe the resemblance of its shape to that of the Cross impressed them, so that they gave to the Christian symbol the name of the sacred triple spear. {26}  For if you turn up a little the two arms of a cross, you change the emblem of suffering and innocence at once into one of murder--just as ever so little a deviation from goodness will lead you, my dear boy, into any amount of devilry.  And that the unfailing lucid flash of humour may not be wanting, there lightens on my mind the memory of _The Mysterious Pitchfork_--a German satirical play which made a sensation in its time--and Herlossohn in his romance of _Der Letzte Taborit_ (which helped George Sand amazingly in Consuelo), makes a Gipsy chieftain appear in a wonderfully puzzling light by brandishing, in fierce midnight dignity, this agricultural parody on Neptune's weapon, which brings me nicely around to my Gipsies again.  If I said nothing to the inmates of the cottage of all that the _trushul_ or cross trident suggested, still less did I vex their souls with the mystic possible meaning of the antique _patteran_ or sign which I had drawn.  For it has, I opine, a deep meaning, which as one who knew Creuzer of old, I have a right to set forth.  Briefly, then, and without encumbering my book with masses of authority, let me state that in all early lore, the _road_ is a symbol of life; Christ himself having used it in this sense.  Cross roads were peculiarly meaning-full as indicating the meet-of life with life, of good with evil, a faith of which abundant traces are preserved in the fact that until the present generation suicides were buried at them, and magical rites and diabolic incantations are supposed to be most successful when practised in such places.  The English _path_, the Gipsy patteran, the Rommany-Hindu _pat_, a foot, and the Hindu _panth_, a road, all meet in the Sanscrit _path_, which was the original parting of the ways.  Now the _patteran_ which I have drawn, like the Koua of the Chinese or the mystical _Swastika_ of the Buddhists, embraces the long line of life, or of the infinite and the short, or broken lines of the finite, and, therefore, as an ancient magical Eastern sign, would be most appropriately inscribed as a _sikker-paskero dromescro_--or hand post--to show the wandering Rommany how to proceed on their way of life.  [Svastika: ill27.jpg]  That the ordinary Christian Cross should be called by the English Gipsies a _trin bongo drum_--or the three cross roads--is not remarkable when we consider that their only association with it is that of a \"wayshower,\" as Germans would call it.  To you, reader, it may be that it points the way of eternal life; to the benighted Rommany-English-Hindoo, it indicates nothing more than the same old weary track of daily travel; of wayfare and warfare with the world, seeking food and too often finding none; living for petty joys and driven by dire need; lying down with poverty and rising with hunger, ignorant in his very wretchedness of a thousand things which he _ought_ to want, and not knowing enough to miss them.  Just as the reader a thousand, or perhaps only a hundred, years hence--should a copy of this work be then extant--may pity the writer of these lines for his ignorance of the charming comforts, as yet unborn, which will render _his_ physical condition so delightful.  To thee, oh, future reader, I am what the Gipsy is to me!  Wait, my dear boy of the Future--wait--till"]]]
