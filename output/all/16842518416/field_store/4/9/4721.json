Oh, there were such good things for hungry children!  There were pretty little cakes with pink and white frosting, and oranges, and nuts, and raisins, and apples, and candy.  Boy Blue's father had heard about the party and had sent the apples from the farm.  Boy Blue's mother had sent some candy made of maple sugar and nuts.  Oh, it was so good!  When each one had eaten some of the cakes, and some of the nuts, and some of the candy, Mrs. Horne went out into the kitchen.  Jack began to laugh and his eyes looked very big and wise.  \"The surprise is coming!\" cried Boy Blue. \"The surprise is coming!\"  And sure enough! In came Mrs. Horne, carrying a huge pie in her hands.  \"This is Jack Horner's pie,\" she said. \"I think it is full of plums.\"  [Illustration: \"Then he had put in his hand and pulled out something.\"]  Then she put it on the table in front of Jack.  He stood up and said:--   \"Little Jack Horner   Stood near a corner   Cutting his birthday pie.   He put in his thumb   And pulled out a plum,   And said, 'What a big boy am I!'\"  How the children laughed!  Jack had cut the paper crust of his birthday pie.  Then he had put in his hand and pulled out something.  It was surely too big for a real plum.  \"For Boy Blue,\" said Jack, giving him the package.  Boy Blue took off the white paper and there was a tiny horn, tied with a blue ribbon.  Then Jack pulled out another plum.  It was a book about flowers for Mistress Mary.  Tommy Tucker had a knife.  \"That's to cut your bread with,\" said Jack Horner.  Mary found a woolly lamb in her plum.  The lamb's head would come off, an inside was a tiny bottle of cologne.  Jack and Jill each had a little pail filled with candies.  Jack's plum was in the very bottom of the pie.  It was a dear little watch.  \"Now, I shall not be late to school again,\" he said.  It was Jack, you know, who let Mary's lamb into school.  He was late that morning and did not shut the door.  When it was time for the children to go home Mr. Horne packed them all into his big sleigh.  \"Good-bye, Jack!\" they cried.  \"Good-bye, Jack Horner, we have had a lovely time!\"       There was an old woman     Who lived in a shoe,   She had so many children     She didn't know what to do,   She gave them some butter     Without any bread;   Then she spanked them all soundly,     And sent them to bed.     THE OLD WOMAN IN THE SHOE   You remember I told you that Boy Blue lived on a big farm.  In the winter Boy Blue could not go to school because the school-house was so far from his home.  So Mary's mother said, \"Boy Blue can spend the winter with us and go to school with Mary.\"  Of course the children thought that would be fine.  Mary didn't have any brothers or sisters, and sometimes she was rather lonely.  So Boy Blue went to spend the winter with Mary.  He was sorry to leave Fire-cracker and his eight white Snowballs.  \"I shall be back in the spring,\" he said. \"John will have to take care of you this winter.\"  Boy Blue had never seen such a large school in all his life.  In the little country school there were only ten children.  In Mary's school there were fifty boys and girls in one room, and there were ten rooms in the school-house.  Now it was winter, and there was snow on the ground.  The children had been to school three months.  Every afternoon they had great fun coasting down the long hill behind the school-house.  One day Miss Smith said, \"Children, do you know what month this is?\"  \"Yes, yes!\" they all said. \"This is December.\"  \"Christmas comes this month,\" said one little girl.  Then they all talked at once.  Oh, how they liked Christmas, and Santa Claus and Christmas trees!  They hoped Santa Claus would bring them many presents.  At last Miss Smith said, \"Shall we have a Christmas tree this year in school?\"  Of course they all wanted one.  \"I know something better than a Christmas tree,\" said Miss Smith.  \"Something better than a Christmas tree!\" said Mistress Mary. \"What can it be?\"  \"I must tell you about it,\" said Miss Smith. \"You know I have told you about Mrs. Brown.\"  \"Yes,\" said Boy Blue, \"she is the 'Old Woman in the Shoe.'\"  Miss Smith laughed. \"Is that what you call her?\" she said.  \"Yes,\" said Mary, \"you know she has a great many children.\"  \"Well, Tommy and Betty Brown have been sick a long time.  \"Mrs. Brown has had to work very hard to get food to eat.  \"I am afraid they will not have a happy Christmas.  \"I think we might have a Christmas box, and fill it with all kinds of good things.  \"We can put things to eat and wear in the box, and you can bring some toys, too.  \"Then on Christmas day we can send the box to Mrs. Brown.  \"That would make her happy, and it would make us happy, too.\"  The children all thought this was a very good idea.  Jack said, \"I think it would be great fun if we could have a box the shape of a big shoe. I know my father could make us one. I will ask him to-night.\"  So Jack's father made a big wooden shoe, and the boys helped him paint it black.  When the shoe was finished, the children began to fill it.  In the toe of the shoe Jack put two large squashes.  Mary brought a bag of potatoes and some big red apples.  Boy Blue wrote a letter to his mother and told her about the Christmas shoe.  So Mrs. Snow sent a roasted chicken, a dozen eggs, and some fresh butter that she had made.  I cannot tell you all the things that found their way into that wooden shoe.  There was everything that hungry little boys and girls like to eat.  There were games and toys for the boys, and dolls with pretty dresses for the girls.  And there was a fine new dress for Mrs. Brown, too.  The day before Christmas the shoe was ready and Mr. Horne came for it with a big wagon.  Miss Smith put a card in the shoe.  It said:--  \"A Merry Christmas to Mrs. Brown and all the little Browns, from Maggie's and Tommy's schoolmates.\"  \"Look, Mamma!\" said little Maggie Brown. \"What is that wagon stopping here for, and what is that funny thing in it?\"  Mrs. Brown came to the window just as Mr. Home took the shoe out of the wagon.  [Illustration]  \"Why, it is a big shoe,\" laughed Mrs. Brown. \"I guess it is for me to keep you all in.\"  Tommy, and Katie, and Mary, and Alice, all ran to see.  Oh, they were so happy when the shoe was brought in and they found it was something for them!  Mrs. Brown was happy, too, to think that her children would have such a merry Christmas.  She told Mr. Horne to wish all the children who sent the shoe a very, very happy Christmas.  \"And tell them,\" she said, \"to come and see 'the Old Woman in the Shoe' and her children!\"       Little Miss Muffet   Sat on a tuffet,     Eating her curds and whey;   There came a big spider   And sat down beside her,     And frightened Miss Muffet away.     MISS MUFFET   It was the Christmas vacation and Boy Blue and Mary were at home every day.  Boy Blue wished to go to his own home on the farm in his vacation.  He wished to see his father and mother, and little sister, and fire-cracker, and his eight Snowballs.  But one night he had a letter from his mother.  Of course he could read it himself, because he was seven years old and had been to school two years.  When he read the letter he danced up and down for joy.  He danced right through the hall into the dining-room and showed his letter to Mary.  Then she danced, too, because the letter said that Boy Blue's father and mother were coming to see him the very next day.  And, best of all, Little Sister was coming to stay two weeks.  When it was time to go to the station to meet Little Sister and her mother. Boy Blue could hardly wait for the train.  At last it came, bringing the two dearest people in all the world, and Boy Blue laughed, and cried, and asked questions, all in the same minute.  \"Where is Papa?  \"Is he coming to-morrow?  \"How is Fire-cracker?  \"Are you going to stay two weeks?\"  \"Wait, wait, children!\" said Mrs. Snow, \"ask one question at a time.\"  They rode to Mary's house in a car, and all these questions and many others were asked and answered.  It was the night before Christmas and the children were going to hang up their stockings.  \"Hang them by the chimney in your playroom,\" said Mary's mother. \"Then Santa Claus won't have far to go.\"  So the children ran up to the playroom with their stockings.  \"Oh, look!\" said Boy Blue. \"Sister's stocking is so small that Santa Claus can't get even a rag doll into it.\"  Mary found a basket for Little Sister.  \"You can put this right under your stocking, dear,\" she said.  \"I will write a letter to Santa Claus and tell him where to put your presents.\"  So she wrote this letter and pinned it on the toe of the tiny stocking:  \"Dear Santa Claus:--Little Sister's stocking is so small I have given her a basket. Please put her presents in it.\"  Santa Claus must have read the note, for the next morning the basket was full.  There was a basket under each of the other stockings, too.  On each one was a note, saying:--  \"Your stockings were not large enough. I had to get a basket for you, too.\"                                                      SANTA CLAUS.   In Boy Blue's basket there were a horn and a drum, a box of tin soldiers, and three books. Under the basket was a new red sled.  Mary found two dolls and a trunk full of dresses for them, a toy kitchen, and a writing desk in her basket.  Little Sister sat on the floor and began to take the presents out of her basket, one at a time.  First, there was a big wax doll in a doll carriage.  It was such a pretty doll, with a blue coat and white hood, all ready to take out to ride!  Then there were some picture books and another doll,--a big one that could open and shut her eyes.  [Illustration]  But what was this in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16046"],["title","Boy Blue and His Friends (#5)"],["body","bottom of the basket? It was very soft and white and had curly hair.  Little Sister picked it up carefully. \"Put it on your head,\" said Boy Blue. So Sister put it on. It was a fur cap.  Then she found a fur collar, and last of all, a dear little fur muff.  When she had them all on, she ran up to her mother.  \"See my muff, Mamma!\" she cried.  Then she ran to every one, saying:--\"Muff! Muff! See my little muff!\"  \"What a dear little Miss Muffet you are!\" said Uncle Jack.  \"Oh.\" said Boy Blue, \"we shall call you 'Miss Muffet'!\"  \"Merry Christmas, Miss Muffet!\"       Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall;   Humpty Dumpty had a great fall;     All the king's horses,     And all the king's men,   Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty together again.     HUMPTY DUMPTY   Tommy Tucker had lived on the farm with Grandma and Grandpa Hall a long time.  He and Rags were very happy in their new home.  Rags was getting fat now, and every Saturday he had a fine bath.  At least Tommy said it was a fine bath, but Rags did not seem to agree with him.  \"Bow-wow,\" he would say, when he saw the big tub full of water, \"I must run and hide.\"  But Tommy always found him, and Rags always had his bath.  When school began in September, Grandma Hall took Tommy to school.  He had a new suit of clothes, a new pair of boots, and a pretty cap to match his suit.  The school was two miles from the farm, so that the first morning he rode in the carriage with Grandma Hall because she could not walk so far.  Every day after that Tommy walked to school in the morning and home again at night.  He carried his dinner in a new pail, and he always found something very good in that pail when he opened it at noon.  All the rest of the children brought their dinner, too, and if I should tell you all the things those children did at noon, it would fill a book.  When the nuts were ripe, they went into the woods and gathered big baskets full.  They found pretty flowers and autumn leaves and made their school-room bright with them.  They played ball, and hide and seek.  Oh, there were such beautiful places to hide,--behind the wood-pile, in the wood-box, behind trees and fences, and in the woods!  Tommy had never had such a good time in his life.  He did not play all the time, because he was working very hard to catch up with the other boys.  Before the winter was over he was in the class with Jack and Jill, and Grandma said she was very proud of him.  But I must tell you of the Jack-o'-lanterns the children made for Hallowe'en.  Tommy did not know much about Hallowe'en, for he had always lived in the city.  He had seen boys make Jack-o'-lanterns out of paper boxes.  But he had never seen a real pumpkin Jack-o'-lantern in his life.  One day, near the last of October, the children were all talking about Hallowe'en and the fun they would have with their lanterns.  \"You'll make one, won't you, Tommy?\" said Jack.  Of course Tommy wanted to make one if the boys would show him how.  \"I know what would be fun,\" said  Jill. \"Let's bring our pumpkins to school and make our lanterns at noon.\"  \"Yes, yes, that is just the thing!\" they shouted.  \"Then when they are finished we can ask Miss Phillips which is the prettiest.\"  As if a Jack-o'-lantern could ever be pretty!  The next morning there was a funny sight in the dressing-room.  Under each hook was a pumpkin.  There were big ones, little ones, fat ones, long ones, short ones, yellow ones, and green ones.  In fact, no two pumpkins were alike, except of course, Jack's and Jill's.  \"It will never do for us to have ours different,\" said Jill.  So they hunted a long time to find two that were just alike.  Tommy tried very hard to think of his arithmetic and geography and spelling that morning.  But he couldn't help thinking of his pumpkin, which was waiting to be made into a Jack-o'-lantern.  At last it was noon.  I am afraid the children did not care what they had for dinner that noon, and they ate very fast.  They needed all the time they could get for their Jack-o'-lanterns.  First, they cut off the top of the pumpkin, and cut out all the seeds. Then came the fun of making the lantern's face.  He must have two eyes, a nose, a mouth, and two ears.  Jack cut two round holes for eyes.  A long cut in the middle was the nose.  The mouth curved up at both ends, and the holes at the sides were ears.  Some of the lanterns had two very good rows of teeth.  Tom's pumpkin was long and narrow. He said it looked so much like a big egg that he was going to name it \"Humpty Dumpty.\"  \"Oh, let's all name our lanterns!\" said the children.  \"Mine is so round I shall call it 'Tubby',\" said Jack.  Then Jill named hers \"Bubby.\"  One of the boys named his \"Green Top,\" and another was \"Big Eyes.\"  Just as the bell rang for school the last one was finished.  How Miss Phillips laughed when the children marched in, each one carrying a funny Jack-o'-lantern!  She said she could not tell which one was the prettiest.  After she had been introduced to each one they were put into the hall to wait for school to be over.  Hallowe'en night every lantern had a candle in it, and the children had great fun trying to frighten their mothers and fathers and each other.  Of course Grandpa Hall jumped and ran when he saw a big bright face coming at him from the barn.  Then Grandma Hall saw it in the woodshed, and she ran and hid behind the kitchen door.  Tommy played with Humpty Dumpty for several days.  Saturday morning he was in the meadow playing with Humpty Dumpty when Jack and Jill came to ask him to go with them to the woods.  Tommy put Humpty Dumpty up on the stone wall and ran off with the twins.  Grandpa Hall's old white cow was in the meadow eating grass.  As she came near the wall she saw something that looked very much like a pumpkin.  Mrs. Cow was fond of pumpkins, so she thought she would go and see what it really was on the wall.  \"Why, it surely is a pumpkin,\" said Mrs. Cow, \"but I wonder what all those holes are for.\"  Humpty Dumpty felt very much hurt to think that Mrs. Cow should speak of his eyes and mouth as holes.  \"But then, of course,\" thought Humpty, \"she does not know that I am not a pumpkin now.\"  Mrs. Cow kept putting her nose nearer and nearer to Humpty.  At last she got so near that she made him jump.  At least, I think he must have jumped, for he fell from the wall to the ground.  When Mrs. Cow saw the pumpkin all broken in pieces she thought she might as well eat it, and she did.  [Illustration]  At first she liked the pumpkin very much, but then she thought it didn't taste just right.  \"I don't believe pumpkins with big round holes in them are good to eat,\" said Mrs. Cow.  But when Tommy found what had happened to Humpty Dumpty, he said to Grandpa Hall, \"I wonder which Mrs. Cow liked best, the Jack-o'-lantern or the candle!\"  The children in Miss Smith's room had been just as busy as bees all day.  Now they were tired, and they could not work any more.  Mary put her head down on her desk and nearly went to sleep.  Most of the boys were looking out of the window, because they liked to watch it snow.  It had been snowing hard all day and they were thinking of the snowballs they would make, and of the snow forts that they would build on the hill.  How could they study when they were thinking of all those things?  \"Miss Smith,\" said Bo-peep, looking up from her work, \"won't you please tell us a story? It is getting so dark that I cannot see to write.\"  Miss Smith thought a minute and then said, \"How would you like to play at being a book?\"  Every little face brightened. The boys looked at Miss Smith and forgot about the snow forts.  Mary sat up and did not feel one bit sleepy.  \"Why, Miss Smith,\" said Mary, \"how can we be a book?\"  \"I will show you,\" said Miss Smith.  \"We will play that we are the Mother Goose Book.  \"You must each think of some child from Mother Goose land whom you would like to be.  \"Then each one can come to the front of the room and play at being that little child.  \"The rest of us will try to guess who the child is.\"  The children all thought that would be great fun, and for a few minutes it was so quiet they could almost hear the snow falling.  At the end of five minutes Miss Smith said, \"Now it is time to begin. You may be on the first page in our book, Jack.  \"You may use anything in the room you need to help you in acting your part.\"  Jack went into the hall. In a minute he pushed the door open a little way and looked in.  Then he came into the school-room. He had his books under his arm, and as he came in very slowly he looked at the clock.  \"Oh, I know!\" said John. \"Hickory, dickory, dock.\"  [Illustration: \"She looked so funny as she came into the room riding on a broom\"]  \"No, no,\" said Mary, \"that is:--    'A dillar, a dollar,   A ten o'clock scholar,   What makes you come so soon?   You used to come at ten o'clock,   And now you come at noon.'\"  \"That is right,\" said Jack. \"Mary guessed it.\"  Then it was Mary's turn to be a page in the Mother Goose Book.  When she came in she had on Miss Smith's long white apron, her hair was done up high on her head, and she was riding on a broom.  She looked so funny that all the children laughed.  At last Edith stopped laughing and began to sing:   \"Old woman, old woman,   Old woman, said I.   Oh whither, oh whither,   Oh whither so high?   To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky;   But I'll be back again by-and-by.\"  Yes, Edith had guessed right, so she ran out of the room.  When she came back the children all looked and looked.  Who could she be?  She hadn't changed herself one bit, and she only stood still and looked at them.  \"We are caught this time,\" laughed Miss Smith.  Just then a little girl in the back of the room jumped up and said: \"Oh, see the curl in the middle of her forehead! I know who she is!   'There was a little girl,   And she had a little curl.   And it hung right down on her forehead.   When she was good   She was very good indeed;   But when she was bad she was"]]]
