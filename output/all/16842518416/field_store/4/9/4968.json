When the pupal stage draws near the bud grows out of its sheath, and projecting from the general surface of the epidermis becomes covered with cuticle to be revealed, as we have seen, after the last larval moult, as the pupal wing. Thus all through the life of the humble, crawling caterpillar, 'it doth not yet appear what it shall be,' but there are being prepared, hidden and unseen, the wondrous organs of flight, which in due time will equip the insect for the glorious aerial existence that awaits it.  [Illustration: Fig. 10.

Vaud._ XXX.]  As mentioned above, this hidden growth of the wing-rudiments, in butterflies, beetles, flies, bees, and the great majority of the winged insects, has been emphasised by Sharp (1899) as a character contrasting markedly with the outward and visible growth of the wing-rudiments in such insects as cockroaches, bugs, and dragon-flies. The divergence between the two modes of development is certainly very striking, and a conceivable method of transition from the one to the other is not easy to explain. Sharp has expressed the divergence by the terms _Endopterygota_, applied to all the orders of insects with hidden wing-rudiments (the 'Metabola' or 'Holometabola' of most classifications) and _Exopterygota_, including all those insects whose wing-rudiments are visible throughout growth ('Hemimetabola' and 'Ametabola'). Those curious lowly insects, belonging to the two orders of the Collembola and Thysanura, none of whose members ever develop wings at all, form a third sub-class, the _Apterygota_ (see Classificatory Table, p. 122).  Not the wings only, but other structures of the imago, varying in extent in different orders, are formed from the imaginal discs. For example, de RÃ©aumur and G. Newport (1839) found that if the thoracic leg of a late-stage caterpillar were cut off, the corresponding leg of the resulting butterfly would still be developed, although in a truncated condition. Gonin has shown that in the Cabbage White butterfly (_Pieris brassicae_) the legs of the imago are represented, through the greater part of larval life, only by small groups of cells situated within the bases of the larval legs. After the third moult these imaginal discs grow rapidly and the proximal portion of each, destined to develop into the thigh and shin of the butterfly's leg, sinks into a depression at the side of the thorax, while the tip of the shin and the five-segmented foot project into the cavity of the larval leg. Hence we understand that the amputation of the latter by the old naturalists truncated only and did not destroy the imaginal limb. In the blow-fly maggot, Weismann, B.T. Lowne (1890) and J. Van Rees (1888) have shown that the imaginal discs of the legs (fig. 11--1, 2, 3) grow out from deep dermal inpushings. Simple at first, these outgrowths by partial splitting, become differentiated into thigh and shin.  [Illustration: Fig. 11. Front region of Maggot of Blow-fly (_Calliphora_) showing diagrammatically the imaginal discs, which are shaded. _e_, eye; _f_, feeler; _W_, fore-wing; _w_, hind-wing; 1, 2, 3, legs. _H_ is the 'cephalic vesicle,' which becomes everted at the close of the metamorphosis, so as to bring the feelers and eyes to the front, the brain (_B_) moving forwards at the same time. After Van Rees, _Zool. Jahrb._ 1894, and Lowne's _Blow-fly_.]  Similarly the feelers and jaws of the butterfly are developed from imaginal discs, and this fact explains how it comes to pass that they differ so widely from the corresponding structures in the caterpillar. The larval feelers (fig. 3 _At_) are short and stumpy, those of the butterfly long and many-jointed. The maxilla of the larva (fig. 3 _Mx_) consists of a base carrying two short jointed processes; in the butterfly a certain portion of the maxilla, the hood or galea, is modified into a long, flexible grooved process, capable of forming with its fellow the trunk through which the insect sucks its liquid food (fig. 2). Nothing but some such provision as that of the imaginal discs could render possible the wonderful replacement of the caterpillar's jaws, biting solid food, into those of the butterfly sipping nectar from flowers.  A curious segmental displacement of the imaginal discs with regard to the larva is noticeable in some Diptera. In the larva of the harlequin-midge (Chironomus) as described by Miall and Hammond (1900) the brain is situated in the thorax, and the imaginal discs for the head, eyes, and feelers of the adult lie in close association with it, though they arise from inpushings of the larval head. These rudiments do not appear until the last larval stage has been reached. In the gnats Culex and Corethra, on the other hand, the imaginal discs for the head-appendages retain their normal position within the larval head, and appear in an early stage of larval life. Among the flies of the bluebottle group (Muscidae) the brain (fig. 11 _B_) is situated, as in Chironomus, in the thoracic region of the legless maggot, which is the larva of an insect of this family, and the imaginal discs for eyes and feelers (fig. 11 _e_, _f_) lie just in front of it. Here, the imaginal buds of the legs (fig. 11--1, 2, 3) and wings (fig. 11 _W_, _w_) are deeply inpushed, retaining their connection with the skin only by means of a thread of cells. As the larva is legless and headless its outer form is not affected by the discs and it is not surprising to learn that they appear early. It has indeed been suggested that the pharyngeal region of the larva, in connection with which the imaginal head-discs are developed, should be regarded, though it lies in the thorax, as an inpushed anterior section of the larval head. In any case this region is pushed out during the formation of the pupa within the final larval cuticle, so that the imaginal head with its contained brain, its compound eyes, and its complex feelers, takes its rightful place at the front end of the insect.  The mention of the brain suggests a few brief remarks on the changes in the internal organs during insect transformation. There are no imaginal discs for the nervous system; the brain, nerve-cords and ganglia of the butterfly or bluebottle are the direct outcome of those of the caterpillar or maggot. More than seventy years ago, Newport (1839) traced the rapid but continuous changes, which, during the early pupal period, convert the elongate nerve-cord of the caterpillar with its relatively far-separated ganglia into the shortened, condensed nerve-cord of the Tortoise-shell butterfly (_Vanessa urticae_) with several of the ganglia coalesced. In many Diptera, on the other hand, the nervous system of the larva is more concentrated than that of the imago.  The tubular heart also of a winged insect is the directly modified survival of the larval heart.  Similarly the reproductive organs undergo a gradual, continuous development throughout an insect's life-story. Their rudiments appear in the embryo, often at a very early stage; they are recognisable in the larva, and the matured structures in the imago are the result of their slow process of growth, the details of which must be reckoned beyond the scope of this book. For a full summary of the subject the reader is referred to L.F. Henneguy's work (1904) containing references to much important modern literature, which cannot be mentioned here.  On the other hand, the digestive system of insects that undergo a metamorphosis, passes through a profound crisis of dissolution and rebuilding. This is not surprising when we remember that there is often a great difference between larva and imago in the nature of the food. The digestive canal of a caterpillar runs a fairly straight course through the body and consists of a gullet, stomach (mid-gut), intestine, and rectum; it is adapted for the digestion of solid food. In the butterfly there is one outgrowth of the gullet in the head--a pharyngeal sac adapted for sucking liquids; and another outgrowth at the hinder end of the gullet (which is much longer than in the larva)--a crop or food-reservoir lying in the abdomen. The intestine of the butterfly also is longer than that of the larva, being coiled or twisted. Towards the end of the last larval stage, the cells of the inner coat (epithelium) lining the stomach begin to undergo degeneration, small replacing cells appearing between their bases and later giving rise to the more delicate epithelium that lines the mid-gut of the imago. The larval cells are shed into the cavity of the stomach and become completely broken down. J. Anglas (1902), describing these microscopic changes in the transformations of wasps and bees, has shown that the tiny replacing cells can be recognised in sections through the digestive canal of a very young larva; they may be regarded as representing imaginal buds of the adult gastric epithelium. In the transformations of two-winged flies of the bluebottle group, A. Kowalevsky (1887) has shown that these replacing cells are aggregated in little masses scattered at different points along the stomach and thus corresponding rather closely to the imaginal discs of the legs and wings.  The gullet, crop, and gizzard of an insect, which lie in front of the stomach, are lined by cells derived from the outer skin (ectoderm) which is pushed in to form what is called the 'fore-gut.' Similarly the intestine and rectum, behind the stomach, are lined with ectodermal cells which arise from the inpushed 'hind-gut.' The larval fore- and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],["title","The Life-Story of Insects (#6)"],["body","d-guts are broken down at the end of larval life and their lining is replaced by fresh tissue derived from two imaginal bands which surround the cavity of the digestive tube, one at the hinder end of the fore-gut, and the other at the front end of the hind-gut. The larval salivary glands in connection with the gullet are also broken down, and fresh glands are formed for the imago.  A large part of the substance of an insect larva consists of muscular tissue, surrounding the digestive tube, and forming the great muscles that move the various parts of the body, and of fat, surrounding the organs and serving as a store of food-material. Very many of the muscle-fibres and the fat-cells also become disintegrated during the late larval and pupal stages, and the corresponding tissues of the adult are new formations derived from special groups of imaginal cells, though some muscles may persist from the larva to the adult. Similarly the complex air-tube or tracheal system of the larva is broken down and a fresh set of tubes is developed, adapted to the altered body-form of pupa and imago.  The destruction of larval tissue and the development of replacing organs from special groups of cells, derived of course from the embryo, and carrying on the continuity of cell-lineage to the adult, are among the most remarkable facts connected with the life-story of insects. The process of tissue-destruction is known as 'histolysis'; the rebuilding process is called 'histogenesis.' Considerable difference of opinion has existed as to factors causing histolysis, and for a summary of the conflicting or complementary theories, the reader is referred to the work of L.F. Henneguy (1904, pp. 677-684). In the histolysis of the two-winged flies, wandering amoeboid cells--like the white corpuscles or leucocytes of vertebrate blood--have been observed destroying the larval tissues that need to be broken down, as they destroy invading micro-organisms in the body. But students of the internal changes that accompany transformation in insects of other orders have often been unable to observe such devouring activity of these 'phagocytes,' and attribute the dissolution of the larval tissues to internal chemical changes. The fact that in all insect transformation a part, and in many a large part, of the larval organs pass over to the pupa and imago, suggests that only those structures whose work is done are broken down through the action of internally formed destructive substances, and one function of the phagocytes is to act as scavengers by devouring what has become effete and useless.     CHAPTER VI  LARVAE AND THEIR ADAPTATIONS   Among the insects that undergo a complete transformation, there is, as we have seen in the preceding chapter, an amount of inward change, of dissolution and rebuilding of tissues, that varies in its completeness in members of different orders. It is now advisable to consider the various outward forms assumed by the larvae of these insects, or rather by a few examples chosen from a vast array of well-nigh 'infinite variety.'  In comparing the transformations of endopterygote insects of different orders, it is worthy of notice that in some cases all the members of an order have larvae remarkably constant in their main structural features, while in others there is great variety of larval form within the order. For example, the caterpillars of all Lepidoptera are fundamentally much alike, while the grubs of beetles of different families diverge widely from one another. A review of a selected series of beetle-larvae will therefore serve well to introduce this branch of the subject.  [Illustration: Fig. 12. _a_, Carrion-beetle (_Silpha_) with its larva, _b_. Magnified, _a_ 3 times, and _b_ 4 times.]  [Illustration: Fig. 13. Larva of a Ground-beetle (_Aepus_). Magnified 6 times. After Westwood, _Modern Classification of Insects_.]  Beetles are as a rule remarkable among insects for the firm consistency of their chitinous cuticle, the various pieces (_sclerites_) of which are fitted together with admirable precision. In some families of beetles the larva also is furnished with a complete chitinous armour, the sclerites, both dorsal and ventral, of the successive body-segments being hard and firm, while the relatively long legs possess well-defined segments and are often spiny. Such a larva is evidently far less unlike its parent beetle than a caterpillar is unlike a butterfly. Perhaps of all beetle larvae, the woodlouse-like grub (fig. 12 _b_) of a carrion-beetle (Silpha) or of a semi-aquatic dascillid such as Helodes shows the least amount of difference from the typical adult, on account of the conspicuous jointed feelers. The larval glow-worm, however, is of the same woodlouse-like aspect, and in this case, where the female never acquires wings, but becomes mature in a form which does not differ markedly from that of the larva, the exceptional resemblance is closer still. In all beetle-grubs the legs are simplified, there being only one segment (a combined shin and foot) below the knee-joint, whereas in the adult there is a shin followed by five, four, or at least three distinct tarsal segments. The foot of an adult beetle bears two claws at its tip, while the larval foot in the great majority of families has only one claw. In one section of the order, however, the Adephaga comprising the predaceous terrestrial and aquatic beetles, the larval foot has, like that of the adult, two claws. Some adephagous larvae, notably those of the large carnivorous water-beetles (Dyticus), often destructive to tadpoles and young fish, have completely armoured bodies as well as long jointed legs. More commonly, as with most of the well-known Ground-beetles (Carabidae), the cuticle is less consistently hard, firm sclerites segmentally arranged alternating with considerable tracts of cuticle which remain feebly chitinised and flexible. Most of the adephagous larvae (fig. 13) have a pair of stiff processes on the ninth abdominal segment, and the insect, from its general likeness to a bristle-tail of the genus Campodea, is often called a _campodeiform_ larva (Brauer, 1869). From such as these, a series of forms can be traced among larvae of beetles, showing an increasing divergence from the imago. The well-known wireworms--grubs of the Click-beetles (Elateridae)--that eat the roots of farm crops, have well-armoured bodies, but their shape is elongate, cylindrical, worm-like; and their legs are relatively short, the build of the insect being adapted for rapid motion through the soil. The grubs of the Chafers (Scarabaeidae) are also root-eaters, but they are less active in their habits than the wireworms, and the cuticle of their somewhat stout bodies is, for the most part, pale and flexible; only the head and legs are hard and horny. Usually an evident correspondence can be traced between the outward form of any larva and its mode of life. For example, in the family of the Leaf-beetles (Chrysomelidae) some larvae feed openly on the foliage of trees or herbs, while others burrow into the plant tissues. The exposed larvae of the Willow-beetles (Phyllodecta, fig. 14) have their somewhat abbreviated body segments protected by numerous spine-bearing, firm tubercles. But the grub of the 'Turnip Fly' (Phyllotreta) which feeds between the upper and lower skins of a leaf, or of _Psylliodes chrysocephala_ (fig. 15), which burrows in stalks, has a pale, soft cuticle like that of a caterpillar.  [Illustration: Fig. 14. (_a_) Willow-beetle (_Phyllodecta vulgatissima_) and its larva (_b_). Magnified 5 times. After Carpenter, _Econ. Proc. R. Dublin Soc_. vol. I.]  [Illustration: Fig. 15. (_a_) Cabbage-beetle (_Psylliodes chrysocephala_) magnified 5 times, and its larva (_b_) magnified 12 times.]  In the larvae of the little timber-beetles and their allies (Ptinidae), including the 'death-watches' whose tapping in old furniture is often heard, a marked shortening of the legs and reduction in the size of the head accompany the whitening and softening of the cuticle. This shortening of the legs is still more marked in the larvae of the Longhorn Beetles (Cerambycidae) burrowing in the wood of trees or felled trunks; here the legs are reduced to small vestiges.  [Illustration: Fig. 16. _a_, Grain Weevil (_Calandra granaria_); _b_, larva; _c_, pupa. Magnified 7 times. After Chittenden, _Yearbook U.S. Dept. Agric._ 1894.]  Finally in the large family of the Weevils (Curculionidae, fig. 16) and the Bark-beetles (Scolytidae), the grubs, eating underground root or stem structures, mining in leaves or seeds, or tunnelling beneath the bark of trees, have no legs at all, the place of these limbs being indicated only by tiny tubercles on the thoracic segments. Such larvae as these latter are examples of the type called _eruciform_ by A.S. Packard (1898) who as well as other writers has laid stress on the series of transitional steps from the campodeiform to the eruciform type afforded by the larvae of the Coleoptera.  A fact of much importance in the transformations of beetles as pointed out by Brauer (1869) is that in a few families, the first larval instar is campodeiform, while the subsequent instars are eruciform. We may take as an example of such 'hypermetamorphosis' the life-story of the Oil or Blister-beetles (Meloidae) as first described by J.H. Fabre (1857), and later with more elaboration by H. BeaurÃ©gard (1890). From the egg of one of these beetles is hatched a minute armoured larva, with long feelers, legs, and cerci, whose task is, for example, to seize hold of a bee in order that the latter may carry it, an uninvited guest, to her nest. Safely within the nest, the little 'triungulin' beetle-grub moults; the second instar has a soft cuticle and relatively shorter legs, which, as the larva, now living as a cuckoo-parasite, proceeds to gorge itself with honey, soon appear still further abbreviated. Later comes a stage during which legs are entirely wanting, the"]]]
