I lost that book some weeks ago, when I had my fight with Lew Flapp, Rockley, and the rest of that crowd that were dismissed from the academy.\"  \"And what of the envelope, Richard?\" asked Captain Putnam.  \"I don't remember anything about that. It probably came on a letter from home and I must have thrown it away.\"  \"The book and the envelope were found on the floor of the shop that was robbed.\"  \"Well, I didn't drop them there.\"  \"And neither did I,\" came from Tom.  \"Nor I,\" added Sam.  \"Are you going to let us search you and your belongings or not?\" demanded the constable from White Corners.  \"I don't see why you should search us,\" put in Tom, hotly. \"It's an outrage, to my way of thinking.\"  \"You had better let him make a search,\" came from Captain Putnam. \"Then he will see that he has made a mistake.\"  \"All right, search me all you please,\" said Sam.  \"I am of Tom's opinion, that it is an outrage,\" said Dick. \"Nevertheless, he can search me if he wishes.\"  \"Let us retire to yonder barn, out of the sight of the battalion,\" said Captain Putnam.  The constable and Aaron Fairchild were willing, and all walked to the barn in question.  \"You can look at that first,\" said Dick, and unbuttoning his coat he took it off and handed it to the constable.  Josiah Cotton dove into one pocket after another, bringing out various articles which were Dick's private property.  \"Any o' these yours?\" he asked the jeweler.  \"Can't say as they are, Josiah,\" answered Aaron Fairchild. \"Go on a-huntin'. Maybe somethin' is in the linin'.\"  \"There is!\" shouted the constable, running his hand over the padding. He found a small hole and put in his fingers. \"Here ye are!\" he ejaculated, and brought forth two plain gold rings and one set with a topaz.  \"My property!\" gasped Aaron Fairchild. \"My property and I'll swear to it! Didn't I tell ye he was a thief?\"     CHAPTER V  FOR AND AGAINST   All in the barn gazed in amazement at the three rings which the constable of White Corners held in his hand.  \"I don't know how those rings got into my coat,\" said Dick, who was the first to recover from the shock.  \"I am certain Dick didn't steal them,\" put in Tom.  \"And so am I,\" added Sam. \"Dick, this is a plot against you.\"  \"It ain't no plot--it's plain facts,\" came from Aaron Fairchild. \"Go on an' continue the search, Josiah.\"  \"That's what I'm a-doin',\" returned the constable.  He felt the coat over carefully and presently brought forth another ring and a pair of child's bracelets.  \"It's as plain as preachin'!\" came from the third man, a farmer named Gassam. \"He's the thief, sure.\"  \"I declare upon my honor I am innocent,\" cried Dick, the hot blood rushing to his face. He turned to Captain Putnam. \"You don't think I--I--\"  \"I believe what you say, Captain Rover,\" answered the master of the Hall, promptly. \"There is assuredly some mistake here.\"  \"Give me your coat,\" said Josiah Cotton to Tom.  The garment was handed over, and after a thorough search two small gold stick pins were found in the middle of the back.  \"More o' my goods,\" cried Aaron Fairchild, triumphantly. \"I can prove I had 'em on sale not four days ago.\"  Sam's coat was then examined, and from one of the sleeves came half a dozen cheap rings and an equally cheap watchchain.  \"All mine. The case is as clear as day,\" said the jeweler. \"Josiah, you must lock 'em up.\"  \"0' course I'll lock 'em up,\" answered the constable.  \"Lock us up!\" cried Sam, aghast.  \"Not much!\" came from Tom. \"I'm no thief, and I don't propose to go to jail.\"  \"Boys, have you any idea how this jewelry got into your clothes?\" asked Captain Putnam.  \"No, sir,\" came promptly from the three.  The rest of the Rover boys' clothing was then searched and a few more cheap rings were brought to light.  \"Now let us go for their baggage,\" said the constable, and this was done, but nothing more was found.  It was soon buzzing around the battalion, which stood at parade rest, that something was wrong, and then somebody whispered that the Rovers were accused of breaking into a shop and stealing some jewelry.  \"It can't be true,\" said Fred Garrison. \"I shall never believe it.\" And a number of others said the same. But a few shrugged their shoulders-- those who had belonged to the Lew Flapp and Dan Baxter crowd.  \"I never trusted those Rovers altogether,\" said one. \"They have too much money to spend.\"  \"Well, they are worth a good bit of money,\" replied another cadet.  \"This ain't a quarter of the stuff I lost,\" said Aaron Fairchild, after the baggage had undergone a rigid inspection.  \"What have you done with the rest?\" asked the constable of the Rovers.  \"You may think as you please,\" said Dick. \"I am innocent and I do not understand how that stuff got where you found it. An enemy must have placed it there.\"  \"Yes, and that enemy must be the one who robbed the shop!\" cried Tom.  \"It's easy enough to talk,\" came from Gassam, the farmer. \"But you can't go behind the evidence, as they say in court. You might just as well confess, an' give up the rest o' the goods. Maybe if ye do that, they'll let ye off easy.\"  \"What do you consider this stuff worth?\" asked Dick.  \"Nigh on to thirty-five dollars,\" answered Aaron Fairchild.  \"How much did you lose altogether?  \"About a hundred an' sixty dollars' worth.\"  \"Then the real thief kept about a hundred and twenty-five dollars' worth for himself,\" said Tom.  \"There can be no doubt but that one of our enemies did this,\" said Sam. \"The question is, which one?\"  \"Perhaps Dan Baxter--or Lew Flapp,\" suggested Dick.  \"Yes, but how did the things get into our clothes, Tom?\"  \"I give it up.\"  \"That sort of talk won't wash,\" put in the constable. \"You have got to go with me.\"  \"Where to?\"  \"To Squire Haggerty's office.\"  \"I will go with you,\" said Captain Putnam. \"This affair must be sifted to the bottom.\"  It was learned that Squire Haggerty lived two miles away. But a wagon was handy, belonging to a nearby farmer, and this was hired to take the whole party to the place.  \"You must take charge of the cadets,\" said Captain Putnam to his head assistant. \"I must see this affair through.\"  \"I do not believe the Rovers are guilty, sir,\" whispered George Strong.  \"Neither do I. This is a plot against them. The question is, who carried the plot out?\"  Not long after this the battalion of cadets marched off on the road to Putnam Hall while the Rovers and the others entered the big wagon.  Inside of half an hour Squire Haggerty's home was reached. The squire proved to be an Irishman of about fifty, who when he was not acting as a judge did jobs of mason work in the vicinity.  \"Sure, an' it's the boldest robbery we have had in this neighborhood for years,\" said the squire. \"The back door av the shop was broken open and many valuables extracted from the premises.\"  \"Have you any idea when the robbery was committed?\" asked Captain Putnam.  \"Not exactly Mr. Fairchild was away all day yesterday and did not get home until nearly twelve o'clock at night.\"  \"Didn't he leave anybody else to run the shop?\"  \"He has nobody. When he goes away he has to lock up.\"  All were ushered into the squire's parlor, where he had a flat-top desk and several office chairs. The squire had heard of Captain Putnam, and knew of the fame of the academy, and he respected the Hall owner accordingly.  \"I will be after hearing all the particulars of this case,\" said he, as he sat down to his desk.  In a long, rambling story Aaron Fairchild told how he had come home from a visit to the city late the night before. He had some goods for his shop with him and on going to the place had found the back door broken in and everything in the shop in confusion. Jewelry and other things to the value of a hundred and sixty dollars had been taken, and on the floor he had found the memorandum book and the envelope. From some boys in the hamlet he has learned that the Rover boys belonged to the Putnam Hall cadets, and farmer Gassam had told him where to find the young soldiers. Then he had called up the constable and set out; with the results already related.  \"This certainly looks black for the Rover boys,\" said Squire Haggerty. \"How do ye account for having the goods on your persons, tell me that now?\"  \"I can account for it only in one way,\" said Dick. \"The thief, whoever he was, placed them there, for the double purpose of keeping suspicion from himself and to get us into trouble.\"  \"Thin, if he wanted to git you into throuble, he was after being a fellow who had a grudge against ye?\"  \"That must be it,\" put in Captain Putnam.  \"Do ye know of any such persons?\"  \"Yes, there are a number of such persons,\" answered Dick. And he mentioned Dan Baxter, Flapp, Rockley, and a number of others who in the past had proved to be his enemies.  Following this, Captain Putnam related how Dan Baxter had escaped after trying to harm Dick Rover and how it was that Lew Flapp was considered an enemy and how the fellow had been dismissed from the academy, along with several followers. Squire Haggerty listened attentively.  \"Well, if one of thim fellows robbed the shop he must have visited your camp, too,\" said Squire Haggerty. \"Did ye see any of thim around?\"  Captain Putnam looked inquiringly at the Rover boys.  \"I must confess I didn't see any of them,\" said Dick.  \"But we heard from Lew Flapp,\" cried Tom, suddenly. \"How strange that I didn't think of this before.\"  \"Where did you hear from him, Thomas?\"  \"At the hotel where we stopped for supper yesterday. A boy who works around the stables told me Flapp had been there and was very angry because he had been sent away from the academy. The boy said Flapp vowed he was going to get square with the Rovers for what they had done.\"  \"What boy was that?\" asked Josiah Cotton, with interest.  The boy was described and, a little later, he was brought over from the hotel. He was very much frightened and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15904"],["title","The Rover Boys on the River; Or, The Search for the Missing Houseboat (#5)"],["body","upon it that he had had nothing to do with the robbery.  \"Tell what you can about Lew Flapp,\" said Dick, and the boy did so.  \"That young fellow had been drinking, or else he wouldn't have talked so much,\" added the lad. \"He certainly said he was going to get square with the Rover brothers.\"  \"Have you seen him since?\"  \"Yes, I saw him in the village right after the cadets left.\"  \"Anywhere near Mr. Fairchild's shop?\"  \"On the road that runs back of the shop.\"  \"Where was he going?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"And that is the last you saw of him?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You don't know if he went towards the back of the shop?\"  \"No, sir.\"  More than this the boy could not tell and he was excused. Squire Haggerty shook his head in perplexity.  \"I don't know about this,\" he said. \"But it looks to me as if I'll have to hold these Rover brothers until they can clear themselves.\"     CHAPTER VI  LINK SMITH'S CONFESSION   For a moment there was a painful pause and the Rover boys looked at each other and at Captain Putnam in perplexity.  \"Does this mean that we must go to jail?\" demanded Tom.  \"I don't think it will be necessary to hold them,\" came from Captain Putnam. \"Squire Haggerty, I presume you know who I am.\"  \"Yes, sir, Captain Putnam of Putnam Hall.\"  \"Then you will, of course, let me go on a bail bond for these three pupils of mine.\"  \"If ye care to do it, captain.\"  \"Certainly. I am convinced that they are innocent. Why, it is preposterous to think that they would break into such a shop and rob it of a hundred and sixty dollars' worth of goods. They are rich young gentlemen, of a high-standing family, and each has all the spending money he needs.\"  \"I see, I see.\"  \"Well, it ain't nuthin' to me what they be, so long as I git my goods back,\" growled Aaron Fairchild. \"I ain't got nuthin' against 'em personally, especially if they are innocent.\"  \"I think you will find it to your advantage to let this whole matter rest for the present,\" went on Captain Putnam. \"If you make a charge against the boys it will hurt both them and my school. I feel sure they will not run away, and I will give you my personal word that they shall appear in court whenever wanted.\"  \"That sounds reasonable,\" came from the constable, who was beginning to fear the influence which Captain Putnam and the Rovers might bring to bear on the case. \"It ain't no nice thing to ruin a boy's repertation, if he ain't guilty,\" he added.  \"That is a sensible speech which does you credit, sir,\" said the captain.  \"I'd like to find this feller Flapp,\" went on Aaron Fairchild. \"How does he look?\"  \"I have his photograph at the academy. I will let the constable have that, if he wishes it.\"  \"That suits me,\" returned Josiah Cotton. \"Hang me if I don't kinder think he must be guilty. But it puzzles me how them things got in the boys' uniforms.\"  The matter was discussed for fully an hour, and the whole party visited Aaron Fairchild's shop. But no clews were brought to light. Then a wagon was hired to take the captain and the boys to Putnam Hall. The constable went along, to get the photograph which had been promised.  On the way the three Rovers were unusually silent and but little was said by the master of the school. Arriving at the Hall the picture was turned over to Josiah Cotton, who soon after departed. Then the three Rovers were invited into the captain's private office. The marching battalion had not yet arrived and was not expected for several hours.  \"I'd like to sift this matter out,\" said the captain, seating himself at his desk. \"Richard, when did you clean your uniform last?\"  \"Yesterday afternoon, Captain Putnam.\"  \"Were those holes in there then?\"  \"I don't think so.\"  \"How about your uniform, Thomas?\"  \"I cleaned up yesterday morning. I don't remember any holes.\"  \"And you, Samuel?\"  \"I had a hole in my left sleeve, but the jewelry was found in the right sleeve.\"  \"Let me examine the coats.\"  This was done, and all concluded that the holes had been cut with the blade of a sharp knife, or with a small pair of scissors.  \"I believe the job was done in the dark,\" said Dick. \"Somebody must have visited our tent last night after we went to sleep.\"  \"When did you go to sleep, Richard?\"  \"Well, I don't think we were real sound asleep until about midnight. There was some sort of a noise in the camp that kept us awake.\"  \"Somebody said Tubbs was up playing negro minstrel,\" added Tom, soberly.  \"Yes, he was up. So you went to sleep about midnight? And when did you get up?\"  \"At the first call,\" answered Sam.  \"And your coats were as you had left them?\"  \"Mine was,\" came from Sam and Dick.  \"I don't remember exactly how I did leave mine,\" said Tom. \"But I didn't notice anything unusual.\"  \"Then, if the real thief visited our camp he must have come in between midnight and six o'clock,\" went on the master of the school. \"I must question those who were on guard duty about this.\"  \"That's the idea!\" cried Dick. \"If the thief sneaked in somebody must have seen him.\"  \"Unless a guard was asleep on his post,\" came from Tom. \"As it was the last night out they may have been pretty lax in that direction.\"  Dinner had been ordered, and the three Rovers dined with the captain in his private dining room. Then the boys went up to their dormitory to pack their trunks.  \"I must say this is a fine ending for the term,\" was Tom's comment, as he began to get his belongings out of the closet. \"And after everything looked so bright, too!\"  \"It's a jolly shame!\" cried Sam. \"If Lew Flapp did this, or Dan Baxter, I'd like to--to wring his neck for it!\"  \"It will certainly put a cloud on our name,\" said Dick. \"In spite of what we can say, some folks will be mean enough to think we are guilty.\"  \"We must catch the thief and make him confess,\" went on Tom.  The three boys packed their trunks and other belongings and then went below again and down to the gymnasium and then to the boathouse. But they could not interest themselves in anything and their manner showed it.  \"What is the matter that you came back so soon?\" questioned Mrs. Green, the matron of the academy, who knew them well.  \"Oh, we had business with Captain Putnam,\" answered Tom, and that was all he' would say. He dearly loved to play jokes on the matron, but now he felt too downcast to give such things a thought.  Late in the afternoon the distant rattle of drums was heard, and soon the battalion, dusty and hot, came into view, making a splendid showing as it swung up the broad roadway leading to the Hall.  \"Here they come!\" cried Sam. But he had not any heart to meet his friends, and kept out of sight until the young cadets came to a halt and were dismissed for the last time by Captain Putnam and Major Colby.  \"Well, this is certainly strange,\" said Larry Colby, as he came up to Dick. \"What was the row in the barn about?\"  \"I'll have to tell you some other time, Larry,\" was Dick's answer. \"There has been trouble and Captain Putnam wants to get at the bottom of it.\"  \"Somebody said you had been locked up for robbing a jewelry shop.\"  \"There has been a robbery and we were suspected. But we were not locked up.\"  As soon as he was able to do so, Captain Putnam learned the names of the twelve cadets who had been on picket duty between midnight and six o'clock that morning. These cadets were marched to one of the classrooms and interviewed one at a time in the captain's private office.  From the first six cadets to go in but little was learned. One cadet, when told that something of a very serious nature had occurred--something which was not a mere school lark and could not be overlooked--confessed that he had allowed two cadets to slip out of camp and come back again with two capfuls of apples taken from a neighboring orchard.  \"But I can't tell their names, Captain Putnam,\" the cadet added.  \"How long were they gone, Beresford?\"  \"Not over fifteen or twenty minutes.\"  \"Did you see the apples?\"  \"Yes, sir, I--er--ate two of them.\"  \"And you allowed nobody else to pass?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Very well; you may go,\" and Beresford went, thankful that he had not been reprimanded for neglect of duty. Had the thing occurred in the middle of the term the reprimand would surely have been forthcoming.  The next cadet to come in was Link Smith, who showed by his general manner that he was much worried. Captain Putnam knew Smith thoroughly and also remembered that the feeble-minded cadet was a fellow easily led astray.  \"Smith, you were on guard duty from twelve o'clock to two last night,\" he began severely.  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Link Smith, with an inward shiver.  \"Did you fall asleep on your post during that time?\"  \"No, sir--that is, I don't think I did.\"  \"What do you mean by saying you don't think you did?\"  \"I--that is--I was awfully sleepy and could scarcely keep my eyes open. I--I sat down on a rock for a little while.\"  \"And slept?  \"I--I think not.\"  \"Was that before or after you allowed an outsider to get into our camp?\"  \"Oh, Captain Putnam, how did you know I let somebody in? I--that is--I mean, who said I let anybody in?\" stammered poor Smith, taken completely off his guard.  \"Never mind who told me. What I want to know is, did you sleep after you let him in or before?\"  \"Why, I--I--really--\"  \"Tell me the truth, Smith.\"  \"I guess I took a nap afterwards, sir. But it was only for a minute, sir,\" pleaded the cadet.  \"I see. Did you see the outsider leave camp after you had let him in?\"  \"Why, sir--I--I--\"  \"I want the strict truth, remember, Smith. If you don't tell the truth you may get yourself in great trouble.\"  \"Oh, Captain Putnam, I--I didn't mean to do anything wrong!\"  \"Did you see the outsider leave again or not?\"  \"Yes, sir, I saw him leave?\"  \"How soon after he had come in?\"  \"About fifteen or twenty minutes,--certainly, not much longer than that.\"  \"Now, who was the outsider?\"  \"Why, I--er--I--\"  \"Answer me, Smith!\" And now Captain Putnam's voice was as keen as the blade of a knife. He stood before the frightened cadet,"]]]
