Lehmann  _Instructor of Theory in the Oberlin Conservatory of Music Author of \"Lessons in Harmony\"_  G. SCHIRMER, INC.  NEW YORK     PREFACE   The purpose of this work is to supply the need in the Oberlin Conservatory of Music of a text-book on Simple Counterpoint containing a definite assignment of lessons, and affording more practice than usual in combining species.  It is a treatise on strict counterpoint, but strict in a limited sense only. In two-part counterpoint with other than the first species in both parts, dissonances are permitted under certain conditions, and in three- and four-part writing the unprepared seventh and ninth, and the six-four chord, are allowed in certain ways.  While the illustrations have been written in close score, it is nevertheless urged that all exercises be written out in open score, as the movement of the different parts is thus more clearly seen.  The use of the C-clefs is left optional with the teacher.  A knowledge of harmony is presupposed, hence nothing is said pertaining to it.  The author wishes to express his indebtedness to Professor A.E. Heacox for his help and advice.                                              F.J. LEHMANN.

SIMPLE COUNTERPOINT  LESSON I   Counterpoint is the art of combining two or more melodies of equal melodic individuality.  In simple counterpoint all parts must remain in the same relative position to one another.  The Cantus Firmus is a given melodic phrase that is to receive contrapuntal treatment, that is, one or more parts are to be added above or below it.  The Counterpoint is any part other than the Cantus Firmus.  Intervals are harmonic or melodic.  An Harmonic interval is the difference in pitch between two tones sounding at the same time.  A Melodic interval is the difference in pitch between two tones sounded in succession by the same voice. [Fig. 1.]  [Illustration: Fig. 1.]  Harmonic intervals are divided into Consonances and Dissonances.  Consonances are classed as perfect or imperfect.  The Perfect consonances are the Unison, Fifth, and Octave. [Fig. 2_a_.]  The Imperfect consonances are the Major and Minor Thirds and Sixths. [Fig. 2_b_.]  All other intervals are dissonances.  [Illustration: Fig. 2.]  A Diatonic progression is one in which both name and pitch are changed. [Fig. 3_a_.]  A Chromatic progression is one in which the pitch is changed a semitone, while the name remains the same. [Fig. 3_b_.]  [Illustration: Fig. 3.]  Progression from one chord to another is called Harmonic progression; from one tone to another, Melodic progression.  In melodic progression all major, minor, perfect and diminished intervals are allowed except the major and minor seventh. The minor seventh may, however, be used when harmony does not change (_a_). [Fig. 4.]  [Illustration: Fig. 4.]  In counterpoint there are Five Species, or orders. When the counterpoint has one note for each note of the cantus firmus, it is of the First Species (_a_); if it has two notes for each note of the cantus firmus, it is the Second Species (_b_); if four notes, the Third Species (_c_); if two notes syncopated, the Fourth Species (_d_); and a mixture of these species is the Fifth Species, or Florid Counterpoint (_e_). [Fig. 5.]  [Illustration: Fig. 5.]     SIMPLE COUNTERPOINT IN TWO PARTS  FIRST SPECIES   Two-part counterpoint comprises a cantus firmus and a counterpoint. [Fig. 6.]  [Illustration: Fig. 6.]  Although in two-part counterpoint we have to deal with intervals, rather than harmonies, still the harmonic progressions represented by these intervals should be regarded.  The exercises should begin and close with tonic harmony. At the beginning the unison, fifth or octave, and at the close the unison or octave, are permitted. [Fig. 7.]  [Illustration: Fig. 7.]  After the first measure it is better to use imperfect consonances only. The perfect consonances, however, may be used sparingly when a more melodious counterpoint is thereby obtained.  The unison may be used in the first and last measures only. [Fig. 7.]  All progressions must be diatonic, and parts should not cross.  The repetition of a note in a lower part should be avoided wherever possible. In a higher part, repetition to the extent of three notes in succession is allowed.  Do not use more than three thirds or sixths in succession. [Fig. 8.]  [Illustration: Fig. 8.]  Successive similar skips, except the minor third (_a_), in one direction, are to be avoided. Successive skips of a fourth are good when the tones are the fifths of the triads on I, IV and viiÂ°. The last tone should return one degree (_b_). [Fig. 9.]  Do not move more than an octave in one direction in two skips. [Fig. 9_c_.]  [Illustration: Fig. 9.]  Covered fifths and octaves, except from I to V, or V to I, are forbidden. [Fig. 10.]  [Illustration: Fig. 10.]  Both parts skipping in contrary motion to a fifth or octave should be avoided in two-part writing. [Fig. 11.]  [Illustration: Fig. 11.]  Avoid consecutive perfect intervals. [Fig. 12.]  [Illustration: Fig. 12.]  The augmented fourth (Tritone) is not only considered bad as a melodic interval by some authorities, but its appearance between"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16342"],["title","A Treatise on Simple Counterpoint in Forty Lessons (#1)"],["body","parts in successive intervals is also prohibited. This prohibition, however, holds good only when the chords in which it appears are in fundamental position, as in Fig. 13_a_. This is shown by the fact, that if one part skips as at _b_, there is no unpleasant effect.  [Illustration: Fig. 13.]  Avoid consecutive major thirds in major keys. In minor keys they are good. [Fig. 14.]  [Illustration: Fig. 14.]  Use adjacent voices in writing, and do not exceed the vocal compass of a voice.  Modulation may be resorted to within the exercises, but only to nearly related keys; for example, in C, to G, F, a, e, or d.  At the close parts should proceed stepwise to the unison, or octave. [Fig. 15_a_.]  [Illustration: Fig. 15.]  A close as in Fig. 15_b_ may be used occasionally. In this case the leading-tone is better in the higher part.   EXERCISES  To each of the following canti firmi write two counterpoints above, and two below.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 16.]     LESSON II  SECOND SPECIES   [Illustration: Fig. 17.]  All rules for the first species must be observed.  Two notes are written in the counterpoint to one of the cantus firmus, except in the last measure. [Fig. 18_a_.] In the last measure but one the first species may sometimes be used. [Fig. 18_b_.]  [Illustration: Fig. 18.]  Repetition of a note in any but the first species is forbidden. [Fig. 19.]  [Illustration: Fig. 19.]  The counterpoint may begin on the first or the second half of the measure, preference being given to the second half. When it begins on the first half it must be a unison, fifth, or octave; when on the second half, it may be any consonance. [Fig. 20.]  [Illustration: Fig. 20.]  After the first measure the interval on the first beat should be an imperfect consonance, as in the first species, but the fifth, or octave, may be used occasionally.  In this and succeeding lessons, all notes in the measure not belonging to the harmony implied on the first beat, must be treated as dissonances, e.g., those belonging to the implied harmony may be left by a skip (_a_) or stepwise progression (_b_) unless dissonant with the cantus firmus; then avoid their use; if foreign to it, whether consonant (_c_) with the C.F. or not (_d_), they must be treated as embellishments or passing-tones. [Fig. 21.]  [Illustration: Fig. 21.]  The embellishment may be used as follows: when above the principal tone, it may be a semitone (_a_) or a whole tone (_b_) distant from it; and when below, a semitone (_c_). [Fig. 22.]  [Illustration: Fig. 22.]  When the counterpoint is below the cantus firmus, the fifth of the chord needs special treatment. It is permitted on the weak beat when the lower is treated as an harmonic passing-tone.  An harmonic passing-tone is the second of three tones belonging to the same chord. [Fig. 23_a_.] While the third tone should be a member of the chord containing the fifth as an harmonic passing-tone, the chord above it may change as in Fig. 23_b_.  The fifth is permitted on the strong beat when it is only an implied fifth (six-four chord); that is, the third and fifth appear on the strong beat, and the root does not come in until the second half of the measure. [Fig. 23_c_.]  [Illustration: Fig. 23.]  The unison is permitted on the weak beat. [Fig. 24.]  [Illustration: Fig. 24.]  Avoid broken-chord effects, that is, do not use more than three tones belonging to the same chord in succession. [Fig. 25.]  [Illustration: Fig. 25.]  Avoid frequent skipping of parts. [Fig. 26.]  [Illustration: Fig. 26.]  Parts may cross occasionally, but should return immediately [Fig. 27.]  [Illustration: Fig. 27.]  Consecutive fifths or octaves on consecutive strong beats are bad; but they are good on the weak beats _if the second fifth or octave is approached in the opposite direction from the first_. [Fig. 28.]  [Illustration: Fig. 28.]  In minor the sixth degree may occasionally be raised on the strong beat, if it is desired to proceed upward to the raised seventh degree. [Fig. 29.]  [Illustration: Fig. 29.]  In the last measure but one, both the supertonic and leading tone should appear. [Fig. 30.]  [Illustration: Fig. 30.]  _Three_ notes may be written to one of the cantus firmus, as in Fig. 31. For this no new rules are required.  [Illustration: Fig. 31.]  The cadences in Fig. 32 are good. It will be seen that the cadences of the first species may also be used.  [Illustration: Fig. 32.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write two counterpoints above and two below in the first species.  To cantus firmus _b_ write two above and two below in the second species.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 33.]     LESSON III  SECOND SPECIES IN BOTH PARTS[1]   [Illustration: Fig. 34.]      [1] In this and similar cases the term \"species\" will be     understood as referring simply to the number of notes, or to the     note-combinations, of the contrapuntal part or parts in question.     \"Second species in both parts\" means, therefore, that both parts     progress in half-notes.  When writing second species in both parts no cantus firmus is used, both parts being original. One part begins on the first beat, the other may begin on either the first or second beat. [Fig. 35.]  [Illustration: Fig. 35.]  The interval formed by the two notes appearing on the second beat should be a consonance, or one of the following dissonances: The augmented fourth, the diminished fifth, the minor or diminished seventh when properly resolved, and the perfect fourth when approached in contrary motion.  All tones not belonging to the harmony implied on the first beat, must be treated as dissonances. [Fig. 36.]  [Illustration: Fig. 36.]  The seventh or ninth of the implied harmony of a measure, when approached in an upward direction, may be used in either part, provided it is consonant with the other part, or comes within the requirements of the exceptions. [Fig. 37.]  The passing major seventh and its root may appear on the weak beat, even when approached in similar motion as in Fig. 37_a_. The seventh must then be treated as a passing-tone.  [Illustration: Fig. 37.]  The cadences in Fig. 38 are good when writing second species in both parts. Those having the second species in one part only, may also be used.  [Illustration: Fig. 38.]  Writing the second species in both parts will, in this lesson, be confined to a mixture of the first and second species, as in Fig. 39.  In this do not use the second species more than four measures continuously in one part. It will be noticed that the second species may occasionally be used in both parts. In later lessons opportunity will be given to write it continuously in both parts.  [Illustration: Fig. 39.]   EXERCISES  Write two eight-measure phrases mixing the first and second species. [Fig. 39.]  To cantus firmus _a_ write one counterpoint above and one below, three notes to the measure. [Fig. 31.]  To cantus firmus _b_ write one above and one below, in the second species.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 40.]     LESSON IV  THIRD SPECIES   [Illustration: Fig. 41.]  In this species, four notes are written in the counterpoint to each note of the cantus firmus. The counterpoint may begin on the first, second, or fourth quarter. The second quarter is, however, the most usual. [Fig. 42.]  [Illustration: Fig. 42.]  The exercises should begin and end with tonic harmony.  When the counterpoint begins on the first quarter it must form a perfect consonance with the cantus firmus. When on the second or fourth quarter, any consonance may be used.  All previous rules are to be regarded, unless exceptions are made.  At least one of the first three quarter-notes of a measure should be left degreewise. [Fig. 43.]  [Illustration: Fig. 43.]  The last quarter of a measure is usually left degreewise. If approached by a skip or by a degreewise progression of at least two quarter-notes, it may be left by a skip in the opposite direction from which it was approached. A skip of a third in the same direction is also good when this skip is preceded by a skip of a third (_d_). [Fig. 44.]  [Illustration: Fig. 44.]  Parts may cross occasionally.  The use of non-harmonic tones, as in Fig. 45, is good in either part. At _a_ the passing-tone, instead of progressing directly to the adjacent chord-tone, skips a third to the other side of it and then returns. The embellishment is treated in the same way, but is most effective when the principal tone is the leading-tone, as at _b_. In both cases the counterpoint should continue degreewise through the chord-tone. [Fig. 45.]  [Illustration: Fig. 45.]  The fifth, when in the lower part, may be used on any but the first quarter, provided it is treated as a passing-tone, e.g., approached and left by stepwise progression in one direction.  [Illustration: Fig. 46.]  Consecutive fifths and octaves are forbidden when appearing on the accented beats of successive measures; between prominent notes of successive measures not more than four quarters apart; and between a prominent note of one measure and the first quarter of the next. [Fig. 47.]  [Illustration: Fig. 47.]  Oblique motion to the unison is bad. It is permitted if it continues in the same direction through the unison. [Fig. 48.]  [Illustration: Fig. 48.]  The unison may be used on any but the first quarter of a measure.  Frequent repetition of a figure as in Fig. 49 is not good.  [Illustration: Fig. 49.]  The embellishment may be used either above or below, whether a semitone or a whole tone; but when it is a whole tone below, it is most satisfactory as the ninth of the implied chord. [Fig. 50.]  [Illustration: Fig. 50.]  In minor the sixth and seventh degrees of the scale are raised both ascending and descending, when used in harmonies containing the leading-tone as a chord-tone. They are unaltered both ascending and descending in harmonies containing the sixth degree of the scale as a chord-tone. In other harmonies they are raised in ascending only.  The sixth or seventh"]]]
