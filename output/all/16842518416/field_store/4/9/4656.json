He'll kill me if he finds it out!\" Link Smith was about ready to cry.  \"Lew Flapp.\" The captain drew a long breath. \"How did you come to let him in? You knew he had been dismissed from the school.\"  \"He begged me to let him in, saying he merely wanted to speak to two of his old friends. I asked him why he didn't wait until morning, but he said he wanted them to do something for him before they left the school--that he must see them then and there.\"  \"Did he mention his friends' names?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"What did he say when he went away?\"  \"Nothing much, sir, excepting that he had seen them and it was all right.\"  \"Where did he go to?\"  \"I don't know. It was dark and I soon lost sight of him.\"  \"He came alone?\"  \"Yes, sir. But, please, Captain Putnam, don't tell him I told you, or he'll kill me.\"  \"Don't be alarmed, Smith. I'll protect you. If you see Flapp again tell me at once.\"  \"I will, sir.\"  This ended the examination of Link Smith, and as soon as it was over the remainder of the cadets who had been on guard duty the night before were likewise told they might go.     CHAPTER VII  FUN ON THE CAMPUS   \"It was Lew Flapp, just as I supposed,\" said Dick, when he heard the news from Captain Putnam. \"What a rascal he is getting to be! Almost as bad as Dan Baxter.\"  \"Oh, he would have to be a good deal worse than he is to be as bad as Dan,\" returned Sam. \"But I admit, he is bad enough.\"  \"I'd give some money to lay my hands on him,\" put in Tom. \"Oh, but wouldn't I punch his head good and hand him over to the police afterwards!\"  Word was sent to Josiah Cotton and other officers of the law to look for Flapp, but for the time being nothing was seen or heard of that individual.  The Rover boys were to start for home the next day and that night a large number of the cadets held a special jollification on the parade ground in front of the Hall. A bonfire was lit, and the lads danced around and sang to their hearts' content.  In the midst of the excitement somebody saw Peleg Snuggers, the general-utility man of the school, hurrying across the backyard.  \"Hullo, there goes Peleg!\" was the shout.  \"Let's give him a rousing farewell, boys,\" came from Tom Rover. \"Hi, there, Peleg, come here.\"  \"Can't, I'm in a hurry,\" responded the man-of-all-work, who had had the cadets plague him before.  \"Oh, you must come,\" was the cry, and in a moment more Peleg Snuggers was surrounded.  \"Let us march him around on our shoulders,\" went on Tom. \"Peleg loves that, I know he does.\"  \"Don't, neither!\" cried the general-utility man. \"Now, Tom Rover, you just let me alone.\"  \"We'll carry you around for your rheumatism, Peleg. You've got rheumatism, haven't you?\"  \"No, I haven't.\"  \"It's good for the lumbago, too.\"  \"Ain't got no lumba--Oh, crickey! Let me down, boys. I don't want a ride!\"  \"Behold, the conquering hero comes!\" announced Sam, as six of the boys hoisted poor Snuggers up into the air. \"Now, sit up straight, Peleg. Don't you want a sword?\"  \"Here's a broom,\" put in Fred Garrison, and handed over an article which was worn to a stump. \"Present arms! Forward, march! General Washtub will lead the funeral procession.\"  \"If you let me tumble I'll break my neck!\" gasped Peleg Snuggers. \"Oh, creation! How can I carry that broom and hold on, too! This is awful! Shall I call the captain? Let up, I say!\"  \"Send for Mrs. Green to give him some soothing syrup, he's got the fits,\" came from a cadet in the crowd.  \"I'll get her,\" cried Tom, struck with a new idea.  Off ran the fun-loving youth to the kitchen of the academy, where the matron was superintending the work of several of the hired girls.  \"Oh, Mrs. Green, come quick!\" he gasped, as he caught the lady by the arm.  \"What is it, Tom?\"  \"It's poor Peleg! They say he's got a fit! He wants some soothing syrup, or something!\"  \"Well, I never!\" ejaculated Mrs. Green. \"A fit! Poor man! Shall I ring for the doctor?\"  \"Perhaps you had better ring for two doctors, or else come and see if you can help him.\"  \"I'll do what I can,\" answered the matron, and ran to get some medicine from a chest. \"I know what it is,\" she added. \"It's indigestion. He ate four ears of green corn for dinner and four for supper,--and it was very green at that.\"  \"Then he will surely want Mrs. Green to help him,\" murmured Tom.  Off hurried the matron with some medicine and Tom at her heels.  In the meantime the boys had marched poor Peleg close to the fire.  \"Now, steady,\" cried Sam. \"Don't let him fall into the flames and singe his hair.\"  \"Let us warm his feet for him,\" cried a cadet. \"Take off his shoes and stockings!\"  \"Hi, don't you do nuthin' of the kind,\" cried Peleg Snuggers, in new alarm. \"My feet are warm enough!\"  But there was no help for it, and in a twinkling off came his shoes and his socks followed.  \"I ain't a-goin' to have my feet warmed!\" groaned the utility man. \"You are worse nor heathens! Lemme go!\"  He struggled violently, but the cadets placed him on the grass and sat on him. Then one, who had run down to the ice-house for a piece of ice, came up.  \"Here's a red-hot poker,\" he said. \"Peleg, don't you want your initials branded on your feet?\"  \"No! no! Oh, help! somebody, help!\" yelled the utility man.  \"Be careful, or he may get a spasm,\" whispered Dick, who was looking on without taking part.  \"Oh, he's all right,\" returned the cadet with the ice. \"Wait till I brand a P on one foot and an S on the other!\" And he drew the ice across the sole of one foot as he spoke.  The poor utility man thought it was a red-hot poker and gave a yell which would have done credit to a South Sea savage. He squirmed and fought, and in the midst of the melee Mrs. Green and Tom arrived.  \"There he is,\" said Tom. \"He certainly must have a fit.\"  \"Poor Peleg!\" cried Mrs. Green. \"Here, my dear, take this. It will do you good.\" And she held out the bottle of medicine she had brought. \"Take about a big spoonful.\"  \"Hurrah, Mrs. Green to the rescue!\" shouted Sam. \"Come, Peleg, don't be backward about coming forward.\"  \"What is this, Mrs. Green?\" asked the astonished man-of-all-work, as he suddenly sat up.  \"It's for your cramps, or fits, or whatever you've got, Peleg.\"  \"Cramps, or fits? I ain't got no cramps or fits! Are you crazy, Mrs. Green?\"  \"Oh, Peleg, don't act so! You certainly have cramps, or indigestion. Come, take the medicine!\"  \"That fer your medicine!\" roared the angry man-of-all-work, and flung the bottle into the bonfire.  \"Oh, that medicine!\" shrieked the matron. \"And I made it myself, too!\"  \"It's them pesky boys, Mrs. Green! They be a-tormenting the life out of me.\"  \"The boys?\" The matron stopped short in wonder.  \"Yes, mum. They've stolen my shoes and socks, and they started to brand me with a red-hot poker. I ain't got no fits, nur cramps, nur nuthin', I ain't!\"  \"Well, I declare!\" burst out the thoroughly angry matron. \"Tom Rover, come here!\"  \"Thank you, Mrs. Green, I'll come day after to-morrow!\" murmured Tom, as he kept at a safe distance.  \"Well, I guess you are all in this together,\" went on Mrs. Green, looking at the crowd of cadets. \"It's your last night and I suppose you will tear the academy down over our ears.\"  \"Why, Mrs. Green, we never do anything wrong,\" said Sam, reproachfully.  \"Oh, no, of course not,\" was the sarcastic answer. \"I'll be thankful to find myself alive after you are all gone.\" And with this reply the matron bounced off into the kitchen, where she slammed the door after her.  \"Here are your shoes, Peleg,\" said George Granbury, as he handed them over.  \"I want my socks first.\"  \"Here you are,\" came from Larry Colby. As Larry's term as major was now over he was inclined to be as full of fun as anybody.  Peleg took his socks and his shoes and started to put on the former.  \"Hullo, what's this!\" he cried, and shook one foot violently. \"What's in that sock! A grasshopper, I declare! Larry Colby, did you do that?\"  \"Why, Peleg, you know I never play any jokes,\" answered the ex-major, innocently.  \"Don't I, though! But never mind.\" The general-utility man started to put on the other sock. \"If you think--Great snakes, what's this? Oh, my foot! A hop-toad! Beastly!\" And Peleg flung the toad at Larry. The ex-major dodged and the animal struck William Philander Tubbs full in the face.  \"Oh, ah--what do you--ah--mean by such actions!\" stormed the aristocratic cadet. \"I shall report this.\"  \"Hurrah, Tubby has gone into the frog-raising business,\" shouted Tom, merrily.  \"I shan't put nuthin' on here,\" went on Peleg Snuggers, and watching his chance, he ran off at top speed, with his shoes in one hand and his socks in the other.     CHAPTER VIII  GOOD-BYE TO PUTNAM HALL   \"Now, Songbird, give us one of your best poetical effusions,\" came from Dick Rover, after the excitement had died down a little. \"We haven't heard a word out of you for fourteen minutes and a quarter.\"  \"Yes, Songbird, turn on the poetry spigot and let her flow,\" put in Tom.  \"Give us something on old schooldays,\" came from another cadet.  \"Put in a touch of last farewells,\" added another.  \"Don't forget to speak of the moon and fond memories.\"  \"Or, shall we ever forget?\"  \"Or, camping on the old camp-ground, Songbird.\"  \"And of all things, mention the soup we had last Thursday. No piece of poetry would be complete without that soup.\"  \"Who's making up poetry about soup?\" roared Songbird Powell. But then he grew calmer. \"All right, fellows, here goes.\" And he started:  \"Of all the days to mem'ry dear, The dearest days are those spent here,   When we--\"  \"That's a libel!\" interrupted Tom. \"Captain Putnam's rates are no higher than the rates of other first-class academies. I move we cut that verse out, Songbird.\"  \"I didn't mean the cost of the days spent here.\"  \"You can't spend anything here,\" put in George Granbury. \"You have to go to Cedarville to do your shopping.\"  \"I'll make a fresh start,\" came from Powell, and he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15904"],["title","The Rover Boys on the River; Or, The Search for the Missing Houseboat (#7)"],["body","led:  \"Old Putnam Hall I do adore, And love the place as ne'er before, The campus, boathouse, fishing pier-- The roads that run from far and near-- Each classroom is a hallowed spot, Though many lessons are forgot! The dormitories, bright and clean-- No better rooms were ever seen! The mess-room, where we gathered oft--\"  \"To eat our eggs both hard and soft!\"  finished up Tom, and then went on:  \"The prison wherein I was cast, And thought that day would be my last, The teachers sweet and the teachers sour, And the feasts we held at the midnight hour, The games of ball we lost and won, And the jubilees! What lots of fun! And then the skating on the ice--\"  \"When we broke in, 'twas not so nice:\"  interrupted George Granbury, referring to a calamity the particulars of which have already been related in \"The Rover Boys in the Mountains.\" And then Songbird Powell took up the strain once more:  \"I love each corner and each nook, I love the lake and love the brook, I love the cedars waving high--\"  \"And love the dinners with mince pie,\"  interrupted Tom once more, and continued:  \"In fact, I love it one and all, There is no spot like Putnam Hall!\"  And then, with one accord, all standing around joined in the academy cheer:  \"Zip, boom, bang! Ding, dong! Ding, dong! Bang! Hurrah for Putnam Hall!\" Then the fire was stirred up, more boxes and barrels piled on top, and the cadets danced around more wildly than ever. They were allowed to keep up the fun until midnight, when all were so tired that further sport was out of the question, and all went sound asleep.  Bright and early the next morning the cadets assembled for their last breakfast in the mess-room. The parade was dispensed with, for some had to leave by the early boat on the lake in order to make the proper connections. Many were the handshakings and the kind words of farewell. Some of the students had graduated and were not to come back. Of these a few were bound for college, while others were going into various lines of business.  \"We shall never forget our days at Putnam .Hall!\" said more than one.  \"And I shall never forget you, boys,\" answered Captain Putnam. \"I wish all of you the best of success in life.\"  It was not until ten o'clock that the three Rover boys left for Cedarville in the big school stage. As was usual, Peleg Snuggers drove the turnout, which was filled to overflowing with cadets. Behind the stage came a big wagon, heavily loaded with trunks and boxes.  \"Now, young gents, no cutting up,\" pleaded the general-utility man. \"The hosses won't stand it, nowhow!\"  \"That's an old scare, Peleg,\" replied Tom. He had a tin horn and gave a loud blast. \"That will let folks know we are coming.\" And then a dozen other horns sounded out, while some of the cadets began to sing.  A few minutes after reaching the steamboat dock at the village, which, as my old readers know, was located on the shore of Cayuga Lake, the _Golden Star_ came along and made her usual landing. The boat looked familiar to them and they gave the captain a rousing greeting.  Over a dozen pupils were to make the trip to Ithaca at the foot of the lake. There the Rovers would get aboard a train which would take them to Oak Run, the nearest railroad station to their home.  \"The _Golden Star_ looks like an old friend,\" remarked Dick, when they were seated on the front, upper deck, enjoying the refreshing breeze that was blowing.'  \"I am never on this boat but what I think of our first meeting with Dan Baxter and with Dora Stanhope and Nellie and Grace Laning,\" came from Tom. \"What an enemy Dan Baxter has been from that time on!\"  \"And what a pile of things have happened since that time!\" was Sam's comment. \"By the way, it is strange that none of us have heard from any of those girls lately. They ought to be coming east from California by this time.\"  \"I wish they were home,\" went on Tom. \"I'd like to propose something.\"  \"Maybe you'd like to propose to Nellie,\" put in his younger brother, slyly.  \"No sooner than you'd propose to Grace,\" was Tom's prompt answer, which made Sam blush. \"Dick,\" he went on, \"wouldn't it be great if we could get the girls and Mrs. Stanhope to take that trip with us on the houseboat?\"  \"That would certainly be immense,\" cried the eldest Rover, enthusiastically. \"Why didn't we think of it before? We might have written to them about it.\"  \"Is it too late to write now?\" asked Sam. \"Or, maybe we can telegraph.\"  \"Perhaps Mrs. Laning wants her girls at home now,\" said Dick, slowly. \"They have been away a long time, remember.\"  \"Perhaps Mrs. Laning might go along. We could have a jolly time of it with six or seven boys and perhaps the same number of girls and ladies.\"  The idea of having the girls along interested the three Rovers greatly and they talked of practically nothing else during the trip on Cayuga Lake.  Ithaca reached, they bid farewell to the last of their school chums, who were to depart in various directions, and then made their way to one of the hotels for dinner.  \"There they are, mamma!\" they heard a well-known voice exclaim. \"Oh, how glad I am that we didn't miss them!\" And the next moment Dora Stanhope rushed up, followed by Nellie and Grace Laning and Mrs. Stanhope.  \"Well, of all things!\" ejaculated Dick, as he shook hands warmly. \"Where did you drop from?\"  \"We were talking about you during the trip from Cedarville,\" said Tom, as he too shook hands all around, followed by Sam.  \"We were wondering why you hadn't written,\" added Sam.  \"We were going to surprise you,\" answered Grace. \"We expected to get home yesterday and visit the academy. But there was a breakdown on the line and our train was delayed and that made us miss a connection.\"  \"We thought sure we'd miss you,\" said Nellie. \"It made us feel awfully.\"  \"Have you dined yet?\" asked Dick.  \"No.\"  \"Then you must all come and take dinner with us. We want to hear all you've got to tell.\"  \"And we want to hear what you've got to tell too,\" said Dora, with a merry laugh. She was looking straight into Dick's eyes. \"Have you had a good time at the Hall?\"  \"Yes, but we had a better time at the encampment.\"  \"I heard you met some very nice young ladies up there,\" went on Dora.  \"Who wrote to you about that, Dora?\"  \"Oh, never mind; I heard it, and that's enough.\"  \"Well, we did meet some nice young ladies.\"  \"Oh!\" And Dora turned away for a moment. They were on their way to the dining room and the others were temporarily out of hearing.  \"But I didn't meet anybody half as nice as you!\" went on Dick, in a low tone of voice, and caught her hand.  \"Oh, Dick!\" She said this with a toss of her head, but smiled, nevertheless.  \"It's true, Dora. I wished you were there more than once. I would have written more, only we had a whole lot of trouble with our enemies.\"  \"And you really did think of me?\"  \"I did--nearly every day. I suppose you forgot all about me, and that's why you didn't write.\"  \"Dick Rover, you know better than that!\"  \"I suppose you met some stunning Californian that owns a gold mine and he claimed all of your attention.\"  \"I did meet one rich young man, and--and he proposed to me,\" faltered Dora.  \"Oh, Dora!\" And now Dick's heart seemed to stop beating. \"And you--you didn't accept him, did you?\"  \"Would you care if I did?\" she whispered. \"Dora!\" he answered, half fiercely.  \"Well, I told him I didn't want him, so there,\" said Dora, hurriedly. \"I told him that I wanted to marry somebody that lived in the East, and that I--I--\"  \"And that you had the young man picked out? Why didn't you tell him that, Dora? You know--\"  \"Hi, you folks!\" came in a cry from Tom. \"What are you steering for the smoking room for? We are bound for the dining room.\"  \"Well, I never!\" murmured Dora. \"Dick, we had better watch out where we are going.\"  \"That's right.\" They turned toward the dining room. \"Dora, you know, as I was saying, that--\"  \"Dick Rover, I thought we were going to dinner! Just see the folks! What a crowd! You musn't talk like that here.\"  \"Yes, that's true, but--\"  \"You really must mind, Dick.\" She gave him a bright smile. \"I--I--guess I understand you!\"  And then all went in to dinner.     CHAPTER IX  THE ROVER BOYS AT HOME   There was a great deal to tell on all sides, and the dinner lasted over an hour. The Stanhopes and the Lanings had had a grand time while at Santa Barbara and the widow was much improved in health, so much so, in fact, that she was now practically a well woman. Those who had been in the Far West listened with interest to the boys' doings at the Hall and during the encampment, and were amazed to think that Dan Baxter and his father had turned up once more, and that Arnold Baxter was trying to turn over a new leaf.  \"I do not believe Dan will ever turn over a new leaf,\" said Dora. \"He is a thoroughly bad young man.\"  \"Let us hope that he does,\" said her mother. \"I do not wish to see anybody throw himself away as that young man is doing.\"  \"After this you will have to watch out for this Lew Flapp as well as for Dan Baxter,\" said Nellie. \"Both appear to be painted with the same brush.\"  During the dinner the houseboat project was broached, and the boys spoke of what a fine time they expected to have on the Ohio, and perhaps on the Mississippi.  \"And we would like all of you to go with us,\" said Dick.  \"With you!\" exclaimed Mrs. Stanhope.  \"Oh, mamma, what a delightful trip it would be!\" exclaimed Dora.  \"And we would like your mother to go too,\" went on Tom, to Nellie and Grace.  \"Oh, if mamma would only go!\" cried Grace. \"I am sure it would do her a great deal of good. She goes away from home so little.\"  The matter was talked over until it was time for the two parties to separate, and the Rovers promised to write more particulars in a few days,--as soon as they knew more about the houseboat and how it was to be run, and what sort of sleeping accommodations it afforded.  The boys saw the Stanhopes and the Lanings on the boat bound up the lake and then almost ran to the depot"]]]
