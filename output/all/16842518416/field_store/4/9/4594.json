Not so; he knew better than we what he was about.  \"When he had reached within a few feet of the hole, he wheeled sharply to the left, and came dashing up to the point where we stood to receive him.  \"The wolves, too intent upon their chase to see any thing else, went sweeping past the point where he had turned, and the next moment plunged through the broken ice into the water.  \"Then Cudjo and I ran forward, shouting loudly, and, with the heavy rail and the long spear, commenced dealing death among them.  \"It was but a short, though exciting scene. Five of them were speared and drowned, while the sixth crawled out upon the ice and was rapidly making off, frightened enough at his cold ducking.  [Illustration]  \"At that moment I heard the crack of a rifle and saw the wolf tumble over.  \"On turning round I saw Harry with, my rifle, which my wife had brought down and handed to him, as a better marksman than herself.  \"The wolf, only wounded, was kicking furiously about on the ice; but Cudjo now ran out, and, after a short struggle, finished the business with his spear.  \"This was, indeed, a day of great excitement in our forest home. Frank, who was the hero of the day, although he said nothing, was no doubt not a little proud of his skating feat.  \"And well he might be, as, but for his skill, poor Harry would no doubt have fallen a prey to the fierce wolves.\"         *      *      *      *      *   Language Lesson.--Let pupils use other words to express the meaning of what is given below in dark type.

She was a sailor cat, indeed, and it was a sailor who first brought her on board.  Our steamer was lying at her pier in the North River, at New York, taking in cargo.  One of our men, who had been ashore, came back with a little gray-and-white kitten in his arms. She was very poor and thin, and her little furry coat was sadly soiled with dirt and grease.  But she had not lost all her fun, for she was making play with her tiny fore-paws at the ends of the sailor's red beard, to honest Jack's great delight.  \"Where did you pick that up, Jack?\" asked the third officer.  \"Well, your honor,\" said Jack Harmon, touching his cap with a grin, \"seems to me she must have left her ship and gone to look for another, for I found her tramping along the pier there, and mewing as if she was calling out for somebody to show her the road.  \"So I thought that, as we have many rats aboard the old craft, she would be able to pick up a good living there; and I called to her, and she came at once, and here she is.\"  Here she was, sure enough; and as Jack ended his story, she chimed in with a plaintive little \"Me-ow,\" which said, as plainly as ever any cat spoke yet, \"I'm very cold and hungry, and I do wish somebody would take me below and give me some food!\"  She had not long to wait. Half an hour later she was the best-fed cat in that part of New York City, and that night she lay snugly curled up with a good warm blanket over her.  Of course, the first thing to do with an adopted cat is to give it a name, and Jack Harmon, who was a bit of a wag in his way, and a great admirer of the monster elephant which was just then making such a stir in New York, called his new pet \"Jumbo.\"  Jumbo soon became the pet of the whole crew, and of the passengers, too, when they came on board, a few days later, for the voyage back to England.  Before we were half-way across the ocean, the bits of meat or cake, and bits of white bread soaked in milk, which were being constantly given her by one and another, had made her look as round as an apple.  The ladies were never tired of stroking her soft fur and admiring her dainty white paws, which were now as spotless as snow. The children romped all day with this new playmate, who seemed to enjoy the sport quite as much as themselves.  But Jumbo was not content with mere play. She seemed to think herself bound to do something to \"work her passage.\" Whenever any of the crew went aloft to take in sail, Jumbo would always climb up, too, as if to help them.  Jack Harmon was still her favorite, and whenever it came his turn to stand at the bow and keep watch, there was Jumbo going backward and forward.  On the eighth night of the voyage, the stars looked dim and watery, and a low bank of clouds began to rise to windward of us, just between sea and sky.  The old sailors shook their heads and looked grave, as if they expected an unusual storm. Suddenly the wind began to blow strongly upon the starboard quarter, stirring up a cross-sea which tossed the great ship like a toy.  Nearly all the passengers had gone below, and the few who remained on deck buttoned their water-proof coats, and held tightly on by any thing they could seize.  Jack Harmon had shut up his cat below, but poor puss escaped somehow, for all at once a shrill cry was heard, and there was Jumbo clinging to a rail, with a great mountain of a wave coming right down upon her.  Several men sprang toward the spot, but Jack was foremost, and he had just reached his little pet when down came the great wave upon them both.  Instantly the whole after-deck was one roaring, foaming waterfall, the flying spray of which blinded one for a moment. But when it cleared, there stood our brave Jack--dripping, bruised, and bleeding from a cut on the head.  But his little favorite was safe in his arms, and as he came back with her, such a cheer went up from all who were on deck, as the old ship had not heard for many a day.  \"Let's send round the hat for him,\" said one of the passengers.  And the hat was sent around, so successfully that Jack got enough money to give his poor old mother a happy Christmas, and still have something left over for himself and Jumbo, who was his mother's pet ever after.          *       *       *       *       *   Directions for Reading.--Should this lesson be read with the same tone of voice as Lessons V. and VI.?

There is, in the appearance of the lion, something both noble and imposing. Nature has given him wonderful strength and beauty.  His body, when full grown, is only about seven feet long and less than four feet high; but his large and shapely head, with its powerful jaws, his glaring eye, and long, flowing mane, give him an air of majesty that shows him worthy of the name--\"King of Beasts.\"  Yet we are told that a lion will not willingly attack man, unless first attacked himself or driven by hunger to forget his habits.  On meeting man suddenly, he will turn, retreat slowly for a short distance, and then run away.  The lion belongs to the cat family, and his teeth and claws are similar in form and action to those of the house cat.  His food is the flesh of animals; and so great is his appetite, that it must require several thousand other animals to supply one lion with food during his life-time.  His strength is so enormous that he can crush the skull of an ox with a single blow of his powerful paw, and then grasp it in his jaws and bound away.  Unless driven by hunger to bolder measures, he will hide in the bushes, or in the tall reeds along the banks of rivers, and spring suddenly upon the unlucky animal that chances to come near him.  Many lions have been captured, and their habits and appearance carefully studied. Although there is a difference in color--some being of a yellowish brown, others of a deep red, and a few silvery gray--the general form and appearance of all lions is the same.  The mane is of a dark brown, or of a dusky color, and the tail nearly three feet long, with a bunch of hair at the tip.  The lioness, or female lion, is smaller in every way than the male and has no mane.  It is in the night-time that the lion goes out from his den to seek for food, and his color is so dark and his movements so silent, that his presence is not known even at the distance of a few yards.  These dangerous beasts are no longer found in Europe, although they lived there in numbers many hundred years ago. It is only in the deserts and rocky hills of Asia and Africa that they are met with.  Those who have visited a menagerie, and have seen a lion within the limits of a narrow iron cage, can form no idea of the majesty of the brute when roaming about freely on his native soil.  The voice of the lion is loud and strong. It is likely to strike terror to the bravest heart.  \"It consists,\" says a well-known writer, \"at times of a low, deep moaning, repeated five or six times, and ending in scarcely audible sighs; at other times, the forest is startled with loud, deep-toned, solemn roars, increasing in loudness to the third or fourth, and then dying away in sounds like distant thunder.\"          *       *       *       *       *   Directions for Reading.--This lesson should be read a little more slowly than conversation.

The dangers of lion-hunting may be understood from the following incident, narrated by Livingstone, the famous African traveler:  \"The villagers among whom I was staying were much troubled by lions, which leaped into their cattle-pens and destroyed their cows.  \"As I knew well that, if one of a number of lions is killed, the others frequently take the hint and leave that part of the country, I gave the villagers advice to that end, and, to encourage them, offered to lead the hunt.  \"The lions were found hiding among the rocks on a hill covered with trees, and about a quarter of a mile in length. The men circled the hill, and slowly edged in closer and closer, so that the lions might be completely surrounded.  \"Presently one of the natives spied a lion sitting on a piece of rock, and fired at him, the ball missing the beast and striking the rock.  \"The lion turned, bit like a dog at the spot where the bullet had struck, and then bounded off to the shelter of the brushwood.  \"Soon I saw another lion in much the same situation as the former, and, being not more than thirty yards from it, let fly with both barrels.  \"As the lion was still on its legs, I hastened to reload my gun; but hearing a sudden and frightful cry from the natives, I looked up and saw the wounded lion springing upon me.  \"I was caught by the shoulder and hurled to the ground. Growling terribly in my ear, the lion shook me as a dog does a rat.  \"The shock produced a stupor, similar to that which seems to be felt by a mouse after the first shake of a cat.  \"The lion then leaped upon one of the natives who had tried to shoot at him, and then sprang at the neck of a second native who, armed with a spear, was rushing to the rescue.  [Illustration]  \"The exertion was too much for the wounded beast, and so, with his claws bedded in the spearman's shoulder, he rolled over and died.  \"I had escaped, but with a shoulder so broken as to need an artificial joint, and with eleven teeth wounds in my arm.  \"These wounds were less severe than they would have been, had not a heavy jacket which I had on, cleansed the teeth of the lion in their passage. As it was, they were soon cured and gave me no trouble afterward.\"         *      *      *      *      *   Directions for Reading.--Read this lesson in a full and clear conversational tone of voice.
