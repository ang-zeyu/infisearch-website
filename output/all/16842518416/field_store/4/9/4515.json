If Lloyd could have known what a contrast it was to the bare little west gable at the cuckoo's nest, she could have better understood the wonder in Betty's face.  \"My room is pink, and Eugenia's green, and Joyce's blue,\" explained Lloyd. \"Mothah thought you would like this white and gold one best, 'cause it's like a daisy field.\"  Before Betty could express her admiration, Mrs. Sherman came in with an old coloured woman whom she called Mom Beck, and who, she told Betty, had been her own nurse as well as Lloyd's. \"And she is anxious to see you,\" added Mrs. Sherman, \"for she remembers your mamma so well. Many a time she helped dress her when she was a little girl no larger than you, and came home with me for a visit. She'll bring you some milk or iced tea, and fix your bath when you are ready for it. We are going to leave you now for a little while and see if you can't have a nice little nap. It has been a long, tiresome journey, and you need the rest more than you realise.\"  Left to herself, Betty undressed and lay down as she had been bidden. Her eyes were tired and she closed them sleepily, but they would not stay shut. She was obliged to open them for another peep at the dear little white dressing-table with its crystal candlesticks, that looked like twisted icicles. And she must see that darling little heart-shaped pin-cushion again, and all the dainty toilet articles of gold and ivory. Then she could not resist another glance at the white Angora rugs lying on the dark, polished floor, and the white screen before her wash-stand with sprays of goldenrod painted across it, looking as natural as if they had grown there.  Once she got up and pattered across the room in her nightgown to sit a moment before the little writing-desk in the corner, and handle all its dainty furnishings of gold and mother-of-pearl. There were thin white curtains at the windows, held back by broad bands of yellow ribbon. They stirred softly with every passing breeze, and fluttered and fluttered, until by and by, watching them, Betty's eyelids fluttered, too, and she closed them drowsily.  While she slept she dreamed that she was back in the cuckoo's nest again, in her bare little room in the gable, and that a great white and yellow daisy stood over her, shaking her by the shoulder and telling her that it was time to go down and wash the breakfast dishes. Then the broad white petals began to fall off one by one, and it was Davy's face in the centre. No, whose was it? She rubbed her eyes and looked again, to find her godmother standing in the door.  \"It is time to dress for dinner, little girl,\" she called, gaily. \"Do you need any help?\"  \"No, thank you,\" answered Betty, sitting up and catching a glimpse of Lloyd going past the door in a fresh white muslin and pink ribbons.  \"Shall I wear my best dress, godmother?\" asked Betty, \"or would it be better to save it for Sunday?\"  \"Let me see it,\" said Mrs. Sherman, helping her to take it out of the little half-filled trunk. \"Oh, you'd better wear it, I think. We may have company.\" What she saw in that trunk set her to thinking her most godmotherly thoughts.  The wax tapers were all lighted in each silver candelabra when Betty went down the stairs, looking fresh and sweet as a wildflower in her dress and ribbons of robin's-egg blue. When she slipped into the long drawing-room, Lloyd was playing on the harp. Over her hung the portrait of a beautiful young girl, also standing beside a harp. She was dressed in white, and she wore a June rose in her hair and another at her throat. Betty walked over and looked up at the picture long and earnestly.  \"That's my grandmothah, Amanthis,\" said Lloyd, pausing in her song, \"and that's the way she looked the first time grandfathah evah saw her. And heah's Uncle Tom in his soldier clothes, and this is mothah's great-great-aunt that was such a belle in the days of Clay and Webstah.\"  She led the way around the room, introducing Betty to all the old family portraits, with interesting tales about each one. Then she went back to her harp, and Betty sat down in front of the first picture again. \"You belong to me, too, in a way,\" thought Betty, looking up at it. \"If you are my godmother's mother, then you are my great-godmother, Amanthis, and I love you because you are so beautiful.\"  The harp thrilled on, the fair face of the portrait seemed to smile back at her, and in some vague, sweet way Betty felt that she had come back to her own and had been welcomed home to the House Beautiful.     CHAPTER VI.  THE ENCHANTED NECKLACE.   Several days after Betty's arrival, the Little Colonel went into her mother's room with a troubled face.  \"Mothah,\" she said, anxiously, \"what are we goin' to do about the lawn fÃªte at Anna Moore's this afternoon? Elizabeth hasn't a thing to weah but that lawn dress that she has put on every evenin' since she came, and it isn't fresh enough. I can't lend her anything because I'm not quite as tall as she is, and my clothes would be too short. What is she goin' to do?\"  \"Ah, that is my secret, little daughter,\" answered Mrs. Sherman, with a smile. \"What do you suppose I spent that hot morning in town for, the day after she came, and why, do you think, have I driven over so many times to see Miss Dean? I have made at least six trips there.\"  \"Was it to get some clothes made for Elizabeth?\" asked Lloyd. A little expression of doubt showed in the anxious pucker of her forehead. \"But, mothah, she is awfully proud if she is poah. Aren't you afraid of hurtin' her feelin's?\"  \"There are a great many ways of giving gifts, little daughter. If I provided her with clothes in a way to make her feel that I thought hers were too mean to be worn in my house, and that I was ashamed to have a guest of mine present such an appearance, that would naturally hurt her pride; but I have thought of a way that I am sure will please her. If you will call her up-stairs in a few minutes, I will show you. Where is she now?\"  \"Readin' on the stair landin'. At least she was when I came up. She was in the window-seat.\"  \"Then wait until I take something into her room. I'll tell you when I am ready, and you may call her up.\"  Lloyd hung over the banister in the upper hall until she heard a whispered \"Ready;\" then she called: \"Come up heah, Elizabeth, mothah wants us a minute in yo' room.\"  Mrs. Sherman was sitting by an open window with some sewing in her lap, when Lloyd and Betty skipped into the white and gold room. Betty had a book in her hand with her finger between the closed pages, to keep the place.  [Illustration: \"BETTY BEGAN THE STORY.\"]  \"Elizabeth,\" said Mrs. Sherman, \"do you remember the story of the enchanted necklace that was in a book of fairy tales I sent you once?\"  \"Oh, yes!\" cried Betty. \"That is one of my favourite stories. I have read it twenty times, I am sure, and told it to Davy until he almost knows it by heart.\"  \"I wish you would tell it to Lloyd, please. She has never heard it, and I want to illustrate it for her after awhile.\"  The little girl willingly dropped down into a big chair full of cushions, and with her finger still marking the place in the book, Betty began the story:  \"Once upon a time, near a castle in a lonely wood, there lived an orphan maiden named Olga. She would have been all alone in the world had it not been for an old woman who befriended her. This woman was an old flax-spinner, and lived in a humble thatched cottage near the castle. She had taken pity on Olga when the little orphan was a helpless baby, and so kind had she always been that Olga had grown to maidenhood without feeling the lack of father, mother, brother, or sister. In all ways the old flax spinner had taken their places.  \"Every morning Olga carried water from the spring, gathered the wild fruits of the woods, and spread the linen on the grass to bleach. This she did to help the old woman, for she had a good and grateful heart as well as a beautiful face.  \"One day as Olga was wandering by the spring, searching for watercresses, the young prince of the castle rode by on his prancing charger. A snow-white plume waved in his hat, and a shining silver bugle hung from his shoulder, for he had been following the chase.  \"He was thirsty and tired, and asked for a drink, but there was no cup from which to dip the water from the spring. But Olga caught the drops as they bubbled out from the spring, holding it in the hollow of her beautiful white hands, and, reaching up to where he sat, offered him the sparkling water. So gracefully was it done that the prince was charmed by her lovely face and modest manner, and, baring his head, when he had slaked his thirst he touched the white hands with his lips.  \"Before he rode away he asked her name and where she lived. The next day a courier in scarlet and gold stopped at the door of the cottage and invited Olga to the castle. Princesses and royal ladies from all over the realm were to be entertained there, seven days and seven nights. Every night a grand ball was to be given, and Olga was summoned to each of the balls. It was on account of her pleasing manner and her great beauty that she had been bidden.  \"The old flax-spinner curtsied low to the courier and promised that Olga should be at the castle without fail.  \"'But, good dame,' cried Olga when the courier had gone, 'prithee tell me why thou didst make such a promise, when thou knowest full well this gown of tow is all I own? Wouldst have me stand before the prince in beggar's garb? Better to bide at home for aye than be put to shame before such guests.'  \"'Have done, my child,' the old dame said. 'Thou shalt wear a court robe of the finest. Years have I toiled to give it thee, but that is naught. I loved thee as my own.'  \"Then the old dame went into an inner room and pricked herself with her spindle until a great red drop of her heart's blood fell into her trembling hand."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15750"],["title","Pee-wee Harris on the Trail (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: \"WHO--WHO ARE--YOU?\" PEE-WEE STAMMERED.]     PEE-WEE HARRIS ON THE TRAIL   BY PERCY KEESE FITZHUGH  _Author of_  THE TOM SLADE BOOKS, THE ROY BLAKELEY BOOKS THE PEE-WEE HARRIS BOOKS   ILLUSTRATED BY H.

All through the melancholy, cheerless day, the first chill of autumn had been in the air. Toward evening the clouds had parted, showing a steel-colored sky in which the sun went down a great red ball, tinting the foliage across the river with a glow of crimson. A sun full of rich light but no heat.  The air was heavy with the pungent fragrance of burning leaves. The gutters along Main Street were full of these fluttering, red memorials of the good old summer-time.  But there were other signs that the melancholy days had come. Down at the Bridgeboro station was a congestion of trunks and other luggage bespeaking the end of the merry play season. And saddest of all, the windows of the stationery stores were filled with pencil-boxes and blank books and other horrible reminders of the opening of school.  Look where one would, these signs confronted the boys of Bridgeboro, and there was no escaping them. Even the hardware store had straps and tin lunch boxes now filling its windows, the same window where fishing rods and canoe paddles had lately been displayed.  Even the man who kept the shoe store had turned traitor and gathered up his display of sneaks and scout moccasins, and exhibited in their places a lot of school shoes. \"Sensible footwear for the student\" he called them. Even the drug store where mosquito dope and ice cream sodas had been sold now displayed a basket full of small sponges for the sanitary cleansing of slates. The faithless wretch who kept this store had put a small sign on the basket reading, \"For the classroom.\" One and all, the merchants of Main Street had gone over to the Board of Education and all signs pointed to school.  But the most pathetic sight to be witnessed on that sad, chill, autumn night, was the small boy in a threadbare gray sweater and shabby cap who stood gazing wistfully into the seductive windows of Pfiffel's Home Bakery. The sight of him standing there with his small nose plastered against the glass, looking with silent yearning upon the jelly rolls and icing cakes, was enough to arouse pity in the coldest heart.  Only the rear of this poor, hungry little fellow could be seen from the street, and if his face was pale and gaunt from privation and want, the hurrying pedestrians on their cheerful way to the movies were spared that pathetic sight.  All they saw was a shabby cap and an ill-fitting sweater which bulged in back as if something were being carried in the rear pocket. And there he stood, a poor little figure, heedless of the merry throngs that passed, his wistful gaze fixed upon a four-story chocolate cake, a sort of edible skyscraper, with a tiny dome of a glazed cherry upon the top of it. And of all the surging throng on Main Street that bleak, autumnal night, none noticed this poor fellow.  Yes, one. A lady sitting in a big blue automobile saw him. And her heart, tenderer than the jelly rolls in Pfiffel's window, went out to him. Perhaps she had a little boy of her own....     CHAPTER II  A PATHETIC SIGHT   We shall pay particular attention to this sumptuous automobile which was such as to attract attention in modest Bridgeboro. For one thing it was of a rich shade of blue, whereas, the inhabitants of Bridgeboro being for the most part dead, their favorite color in autos was black.  The car, indeed, was the latest super six Hunkajunk touring model, a vision of grace and colorful beauty, set off with trimmings of shiny nickel. The Hunkajunk people had outdone themselves in this latest model and had produced \"the car of a thousand delights.\" That seemed a good many, but that is the number they announced, and surely they must have known.  When one sat in the soft, spacious rear seat of the Hunkajunk touring model, one felt the sensation of sinking into a--what shall I say? One had a sort of sinking spell. You will pay particular attention to the luxurious rear seat of this car because it was destined to be the couch of a world hero, rivalling Cleopatra's famous barge which you will find drifting around in the upper grade history books.  This was the only super six Hunkajunk touring car in Bridgeboro and it belonged to the Bartletts who on this momentous night occupied its front seat.  \"Do look at that poor little fellow,\" said Mrs. Bartlett to her husband. \"Stop for just a second; I _never_ saw such a pathetic picture in my _life_!\"  \"Oh, what's the use stopping?\" said Mr. Bartlett good-humoredly.  \"Because I'm not going to the Lyric Theatre and have that poor little hungry urchin haunting me all through the show. I don't believe he's had _anything_ to eat all day. Just see how he looks in that window, it's _pathetic_. Poor little fellow, he may be _starving_ for all we know. I'm going to give him twenty-five cents; have you got the change?\"  \"You mean _I'm_ going to give it to him?\" laughed Mr. Bartlett, stopping the car.  \"He's just _eating_ the things with his _eyes_,\" said Mrs. Bartlett with womanly tenderness. \"Look at that shabby sweater. Probably his father is a drunken wretch.\"  \"We'll be late for the show,\" said Mr. Bartlett.  \"I don't care anything about the show,\" his wife retorted. \"Do you suppose I want to see The Bandit of Harrowing Highway or whatever it is? If we get there in time for the educational films, that's all I care about. You gave money for the starving children of France. Do you suppose I'm going to sit face to face with a little boy--_starving?_\"  \"I can't see his face,\" said Mr. Bartlett, \"but he looks as if he had the Woolworth Building in his back pocket.\"  \"Little boy,\" Mrs. Bartlett called in her sweetest tone, \"here is some money for you. You go into that store and--_gracious me_, it's Walter Harris! What on earth are you doing here, Walter? I thought you were a poor little--I thought you were hungry.\"  The sturdy but diminutive form and the curly head and frowning countenance which stood confronting her were none other than those of Pee-wee Harris, B.S.A. (Boy of Special Appetite or Boy Scouts of America, whichever you please), and he stared her full in the face without shame.  \"That's the time you guessed right,\" he said. \"I am.\"     CHAPTER III  THREE GOOD TURNS   \"Give him the money,\" laughed Mr. Bartlett.  \"I will do no such thing,\" said his wife. \"I thought you were a poor little starving urchin, Walter. Wherever did you get that sweater?\"  \"I don't believe he's had anything to eat for half an hour,\" said Mr. Bartlett. \"Well, how is my old college chum, Pee-wee? You make her give you the twenty-five cents, Pee-wee.\"  \"A scout can't accept money like that,\" said Mrs. Bartlett reprovingly, \"it's against their rules. Don't you know that?\"  Pee-wee cast a longing glance back at the window of Pfiffel's Bakery and then proceeded to set Mrs. Bartlett right on the subject of the scout law.  \"It--it depends on what you call rules; see?\" he said.  \"And on what you call hungry,\" added Mr. Bartlett.  \"If--if you--kind of--want to do a good turn, I haven't got any right to stop you, have I?\" Pee-wee said. \"Because good turns are the main things. Gee whiz, I haven't got any right to interfere with those. I haven't got any right to accept"]]]
