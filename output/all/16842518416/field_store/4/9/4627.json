But he grew shy, though he had favorites: I was one. Then the captain always asked him to dinner on Monday. Every mess in succession took up the invitation in its turn. According to the size of the ship, you had him at your mess more or less often at dinner. His breakfast he ate in his own state-room,--he always had a state-room,--which was where a sentinel or somebody on the watch could see the door. And whatever else he ate or drank, he ate or drank alone. Sometimes, when the marines or sailors had any special jollification, they were permitted to invite \"Plain-Buttons,\" as they called him. Then Nolan was sent with some officer, and the men were forbidden to speak of home while he was there. I believe the theory that the sight of his punishment did them good. They called him \"Plain-Buttons,\" because, while he always chose to wear a regulation army-uniform, he was not permitted to wear the army-button, for the reason that it bore either the initials or the insignia of the country he had disowned.  I remember, soon after I joined the navy, I was on shore with some of the older officers from our ship and from the Brandywine, which we had met at Alexandria. We had leave to make a party and go up to Cairo and the Pyramids. As we jogged along (you went on donkeys then), some of the gentlemen (we boys called them \"Dons,\" but the phrase was long since changed) fell to talking about Nolan, and some one told the system which was adopted from the first about his books and other reading. As he was almost never permitted to go on shore, even though the vessel lay in port for months, his time at the best hung heavy; and everybody was permitted to lend him books, if they were not published in America and made no allusion to it. These were common enough in the old days, when people in the other hemisphere talked of the United States as little as we do of Paraguay. He had almost all the foreign papers that came into the ship, sooner or later; only somebody must go over them first, and cut out any advertisement or stray paragraph that alluded to America. This was a little cruel sometimes, when the back of what was cut out might be as innocent as Hesiod. Right in the midst of one of Napoleon's battles, or one of Canning's speeches, poor Nolan would find a great hole, because on the back of the page of that paper there had been an advertisement of a packet for New York, or a scrap from the President's message. I say this was the first time I ever heard of this plan, which afterwards I had enough and more than enough to do with. I remember it, because poor Phillips, who was of the party, as soon as the allusion to reading was made, told a story of something which happened at the Cape of Good Hope on Nolan's first voyage; and it is the only thing I ever knew of that voyage. They had touched at the Cape, and had done the civil thing with the English Admiral and the fleet, and then, leaving for a long cruise up the Indian Ocean, Phillips had borrowed a lot of English books from an officer, which, in those days, as indeed in these, was quite a windfall. Among them, as the Devil would order, was the \"Lay of the Last Minstrel,\" which they had all of them heard of, but which most of them had never seen. I think it could not have been published long. Well, nobody thought there could be any risk of anything national in that, though Phillips swore old Shaw had cut out the \"Tempest\" from Shakespeare before he let Nolan have it, because he said \"the Bermudas ought to be ours, and, by Jove, should be one day.\" So Nolan was permitted to join the circle one afternoon when a lot of them sat on deck smoking and reading aloud. People do not do such things so often now, but when I was young we got rid of a great deal of time so. Well, so it happened that in his turn Nolan took the book and read to the others; and he read very well, as I know. Nobody in the circle knew a line of the poem, only it was all magic and Border chivalry, and was ten thousand years ago. Poor Nolan read steadily through the fifth canto, stopped a minute and drank something, and then began, without a thought of what was coming,--      \"Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,     Who never to himself hath said,\"--  It seems impossible to us that anybody ever heard this for the first time; but all these fellows did then, and poor Nolan himself went on, still unconsciously or mechanically,--      \"This is my own, my native land!\"  Then they all saw something was to pay; but he expected to get through, I suppose, turned a little pale, but plunged on,--      \"Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned,     As home his footsteps he hath turned       From wandering on a foreign strand?--     If such there breathe, go, mark him well,\"--  By this time the men were all beside themselves, wishing there was any way to make him turn over two pages; but he had not quite presence of mind for that; he gagged a little, colored crimson, and staggered on,--      \"For him no minstrel raptures swell;     High though his titles, proud his name,     Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,     Despite these titles, power, and pelf,     The wretch, concentred all in self,\"--  and here the poor fellow choked, could not go on, but started up, swung the book into the sea, vanished into his state-room, \"And by Jove,\" said Phillips, \"we did not see him for two months again. And I had to make up some beggarly story to that English surgeon why I did not return his Walter Scott to him.\"  That story shows about the time when Nolan's braggadocio must have broken down. At first, they said, he took a very high tone, considered his imprisonment a mere farce, affected to enjoy the voyage, and all that; but Phillips said that after he came out of his state-room he never was the same man again. He never read aloud again, unless it was the Bible or Shakespeare, or something else he was sure of. But it was not that merely. He never entered in with the other young men exactly as a companion again. He was always shy afterwards, when I knew him,--very seldom spoke, unless he was spoken to, except to a very few friends. He lighted up occasionally,--I remember late in his life hearing him fairly eloquent on something which had been suggested to him by one of Fléchier's sermons,--but generally he had the nervous, tired look of a heart-wounded man.  When Captain Shaw was coming home,--if, as I say, it was Shaw,--rather to the surprise of every body they made one of the Windward Islands, and lay off and on for nearly a week. The boys said the officers were sick of salt-junk, and meant to have turtle-soup before they came home. But after several days the Warren came to the same rendezvous; they exchanged signals; she sent to Phillips and these homeward-bound men letters and papers, and told them she was outward-bound, perhaps to the Mediterranean, and took poor Nolan and his traps on the boat back to try his second cruise. He looked very blank when he was told to get ready to join her. He had known enough of the signs of the sky to know that till that moment he was going \"home.\" But this was a distinct evidence of something he had not thought of, perhaps,--that there was no going home for him, even to a prison. And this was the first of some twenty such transfers, which brought him sooner or later into half our best vessels, but which kept him all his life at least some hundred miles from the country he had hoped he might never hear of again.  It may have been on that second cruise,--it was once when he was up the Mediterranean,--that Mrs. Graff, the celebrated Southern beauty of those days, danced with him. They had been lying a long time in the Bay of Naples, and the officers were very intimate in the English fleet, and there had been great festivities, and our men thought they must give a great ball on board the ship. How they ever did it on board the \"Warren\" I am sure I do not know. Perhaps it was not the \"Warren,\" or perhaps ladies did not take up so much room as they do now. They wanted to use Nolan's state-room for something, and they hated to do it without asking him to the ball; so the captain said they might ask him, if they would be responsible that he did not talk with the wrong people, \"who would give him intelligence.\" So the dance went on, the finest party that had ever been known, I dare say; for I never heard of a man-of-war ball that was not. For ladies they had the family of the American consul, one or two travellers who had adventured so far, and a nice bevy of English girls and matrons, perhaps Lady Hamilton herself.  Well, different officers relieved each other in standing and talking with Nolan in a friendly way, so as to be sure that nobody else spoke to him. The dancing went on with spirit, and after a while even the fellows who took this honorary guard of Nolan ceased to fear any _contretemps_. Only when some English lady--Lady Hamilton, as I said, perhaps--called for a set of \"American dances,\" an odd thing happened. Everybody then danced contra-dances. The black band, nothing loath, conferred as to what \"American dances\" were, and started off with a \"Virginia Reel,\" which they followed with \"Money-Musk,\" which, in its turn in those days, should have been followed by \"The Old Thirteen.\" But just as Dick, the leader, tapped for his fiddles to begin, and bent forward, about to say, in true negro state, \"'The Old Thirteen, gentlemen and ladies!\" as he had said \"'Virginny Reel,' if you please!\" and \"'Money-Musk,' if you please!\" the captain's boy tapped him on the shoulder, whispered to him, and he did not announce the name of the dance; he merely bowed, began on the air, and they all fell to,--the officers teaching the English girls the figure, but not telling them why it had no name.  But that is not the story I started to tell.--As the dancing went on, Nolan and our fellows all got at ease, as I said,--so much so, that it seemed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15868"],["title","The Man Without a Country, and Other Tales (#3)"],["body","natural for him to bow to that splendid Mrs. Graff, and say,--  \"I hope you have not forgotten me, Miss Rutledge. Shall I have the honor of dancing?\"  He did it so quickly, that Fellows, who was by him, could not hinder him. She laughed and said,--  \"I am not Miss Rutledge any longer, Mr. Nolan; but I will dance all the same,\" just nodded to Fellows, as if to say he must leave Mr. Nolan to her, and led him off to the place where the dance was forming.  Nolan thought he had got his chance. He had known her at Philadelphia, and at other places had met her, and this was a Godsend. You could not talk in contra-dances, as you do in cotillons, or even in the pauses of waltzing; but there were chances for tongues and sounds, as well as for eyes and blushes. He began with her travels, and Europe, and Vesuvius, and the French; and then, when they had worked down, and had that long talking-time at the bottom of the set, he said, boldly,--a little pale, she said, as she told me the story, years after,--  \"And what do you hear from home, Mrs. Graff?\"  And that splendid creature looked through him. Jove! how she must have looked through him!  \"Home!! Mr. Nolan!!! I thought you were the man who never wanted to hear of home again!\"--and she walked directly up the deck to her husband, and left poor Nolan alone, as he always was.--He did not dance again.  I cannot give any history of him in order; nobody can now; and, indeed, I am not trying to. These are the traditions, which I sort out, as I believe them, from the myths which have been told about this man for forty years. The lies that have been told about him are legion. The fellows used to say he was the \"Iron Mask\"; and poor George Pons went to his grave in the belief that this was the author of \"Junius,\" who was being punished for his celebrated libel on Thomas Jefferson. Pons was not very strong in the historical line. A happier story than either of these I have told is of the War. That came along soon after. I have heard this affair told in three or four ways,--and, indeed, it may have happened more than once. But which ship it was on I cannot tell. However, in one, at least, of the great frigate-duels with the English, in which the navy was really baptized, it happened that a round-shot from the enemy entered one of our ports square, and took right down the officer of the gun himself, and almost every man of the gun's crew. Now you may say what you choose about courage, but that is not a nice thing to see. But, as the men who were not killed picked themselves up, and as they and the surgeon's people were carrying off the bodies, there appeared Nolan, in his shirt-sleeves, with the rammer in his hand, and, just as if he had been the officer, told them off with authority,--who should go to the cockpit with the wounded men, who should stay with him,--perfectly cheery, and with that way which makes men feel sure all is right and is going to be right. And he finished loading the gun with his own hands, aimed it, and bade the men fire. And there he stayed, captain of that gun, keeping those fellows in spirits, till the enemy struck,--sitting on the carriage while the gun was cooling, though he was exposed all the time,--showing them easier ways to handle heavy shot,--making the raw hands laugh at their own blunders,--and when the gun cooled again, getting it loaded and fired twice as often as any other gun on the ship. The captain walked forward by way of encouraging the men, and Nolan touched his hat and said,--  \"I am showing them how we do this in the artillery, sir.\"  And this is the part of the story where all the legends agree; and the Commodore said,--  \"I see you do, and I thank you, sir; and I shall never forget this day, sir, and you never shall, sir.\"  And after the whole thing was over, and he had the Englishman's sword, in the midst of the state and ceremony of the quarter-deck, he said,--  \"Where is Mr. Nolan? Ask Mr. Nolan to come here.\"  And when Nolan came, the captain said,--  \"Mr. Nolan, we are all very grateful to you to-day; you are one of us to-day; you will be named in the despatches.\"  And then the old man took off his own sword of ceremony, and gave it to Nolan, and made him put it on. The man told me this who saw it. Nolan cried like a baby, and well he might. He had not worn a sword since that infernal day at Fort Adams. But always afterwards on occasions of ceremony, he wore that quaint old French sword of the Commodore's.  The captain did mention him in the despatches. It was always said he asked that he might be pardoned. He wrote a special letter to the Secretary of War. But nothing ever came of it. As I said, that was about the time when they began to ignore the whole transaction at Washington, and when Nolan's imprisonment began to carry itself on because there was nobody to stop it without any new orders from home.  I have heard it said that he was with Porter when he took possession of the Nukahiwa Islands. Not this Porter, you know, but old Porter, his father, Essex Porter,--that is, the old Essex Porter, not this Essex. As an artillery officer, who had seen service in the West, Nolan knew more about fortifications, embrasures, ravelins, stockades, and all that, than any of them did; and he worked with a right good-will in fixing that battery all right. I have always thought it was a pity Porter did not leave him in command there with Gamble. That would have settled all the question about his punishment. We should have kept the islands, and at this moment we should have one station in the Pacific Ocean. Our French friends, too, when they wanted this little watering-place, would have found it was preoccupied. But Madison and the Virginians, of course, flung all that away.  All that was near fifty year ago. If Nolan was thirty then, he must have been near eighty when he died. He looked sixty when he was forty. But he never seemed to me to change a hair afterwards. As I imagine his life, from what I have seen and heard of it, he must have been in every sea, and yet almost never on land. He must have known, in a formal way, more officers in our service than any man living knows. He told me once, with a grave smile, that no man in the world lived so methodical a life as he. \"You know the boys say I am the Iron Mask, and you know how busy he was.\" He said it did not do for any one to try to read all the time, more than to do anything else all the time; but that he read just five hours a day. \"Then,\" he said, \"I keep up my note-books, writing in them at such and such hours from what I have been reading; and I include in these my scrap-books.\" These were very curious indeed. He had six or eight, of different subjects. There was one of History, one of Natural Science, one which he called \"Odds and Ends.\" But they were not merely books of extracts from newspapers. They had bits of plants and ribbons, shells tied on, and carved scraps of bone and wood, which he had taught the men to cut for him, and they were beautifully illustrated. He drew admirably. He had some of the funniest drawings there, and some of the most pathetic, that I have ever seen in my life. I wonder who will have Nolan's scrap-books.  Well, he said his reading and his notes were his profession, and that they took five hours and two hours respectively of each day. \"Then,\" said he, \"every man should have a diversion as well as a profession. My Natural History is my diversion.\" That took two hours a day more. The men used to bring him birds and fish, but on a long cruise he had to satisfy himself with centipedes and cockroaches and such small game. He was the only naturalist I ever met who knew anything about the habits of the house-fly and the mosquito. All those people can tell you whether they are _Lepidoptera_ or _Steptopotera_; but as for telling how you can get rid of them, or how they get away from you when you strike them,--why Linnæus knew as little of that as John Foy the idiot did. These nine hours made Nolan's regular daily \"occupation.\" The rest of the time he talked or walked. Till he grew very old, he went aloft a great deal. He always kept up his exercise; and I never heard that he was ill. If any other man was ill, he was the kindest nurse in the world; and he knew more than half the surgeons do. Then if anybody was sick or died, or if the captain wanted him to, on any other occasion, he was always ready to read prayers. I have said that he read beautifully.  My own acquaintance with Philip Nolan began six or eight years after the War, on my first voyage after I was appointed a midshipman. It was in the first days after our Slave-Trade treaty, while the Reigning House, which was still the House of Virginia, had still a sort of sentimentalism about the suppression of the horrors of the Middle Passage, and something was sometimes done that way. We were in the South Atlantic on that business. From the time I joined, I believe I thought Nolan was a sort of lay chaplain,--a chaplain with a blue coat. I never asked about him. Everything in the ship was strange to me. I knew it was green to ask questions, and I suppose I thought there was a \"Plain-Buttons\" on every ship. We had him to dine in our mess once a week, and the caution was given that on that day nothing was to be said about home. But if they had told us not to say anything about the planet Mars or the Book of Deuteronomy, I should not have asked why; there were a great many things which seemed to me to have as little reason. I first came to understand anything about \"the man without a country\" one day when we overhauled a dirty little schooner which had slaves on board. An officer was sent to take charge of her, and, after a few minutes, he sent back his boat to ask that some one might be sent him who could speak Portuguese. We were all looking over the rail when the message came, and we all wished we could interpret, when the captain asked Who spoke Portuguese. But none of the officers did; and just as the "]]]
