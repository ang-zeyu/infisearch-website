Why should the prince of the eunuchs have supposed that the diet asked for would not nourish the lads? It was that of the bulk of men everywhere, and he had only to go out into the streets or the nearest barrack in Babylon to see what thews and muscles could be nurtured on vegetable diet and water. But whatever the want of ground in his objection, it was enough that he made it. Note that he puts it entirely on possible harmful results to himself, and that silences Daniel, who had no right to ask another to run his head into the noose, into which he was ready to put his own, if necessary. Martyrs by proxy, who have such strong convictions that they think it somebody else's duty to run risk for them, are by no means unknown.  This boy was made of other metal. So, apparently he gives up the prince of the eunuchs, and turns to another of the friends whom he had made in his short captivity--the person in whose more immediate charge he and his three friends were. He is named Melzar in the Authorised Version; but the Revised Version more accurately takes that to be a name of office, and translates it as 'steward.' He did the catering for them, and was sufficiently friendly to listen to Daniel's reasonable proposal to try the vegetable diet for 'ten days'--probably meaning an indefinite period, sufficiently long to test results, which a literal ten days would perhaps scarcely be. So the good-natured steward let the lads have their way, much wondering in his soul, no doubt, why they should take as much trouble to avoid good living as most youths would have taken to get it.  III. The success of the experiment comes next. We do not need to suppose a miracle as either wrought or suggested by the narrative. The issue might have taught the steward a wholesome lesson in dietetics, which he and a great many of us much need. 'A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth,' and his bodily life consisteth not in the abundance and variety of the things that he eateth. The teaching of this lesson is, not that vegetarianism or total abstinence is obligatory, for diet is here regarded only as part of idolatrous worship; but certainly a secondary conclusion, fairly drawn from the story, is that vigorous health is best kept up on very simple fare. Many dinner-tables, over which God's blessing is formally asked, are spread in such a fashion as it is hard to suppose deserves His blessing. The simpler the fare, the fewer the wants: the fewer the wants, the greater the riches; the freer the life, the more leisure for higher pursuits, and the more sound the bodily health.  But the rosy faces and vigorous health of Daniel and his friends may illustrate, by a picturesque example, a large truth--that God suffers no man to be a loser by faithfulness, and more than makes up all that is surrendered for His sake. The blessing of God on small means makes them fountains of truer joy than large ones unblessed. No man hath left anything for Christ's sake but he receives a hundred-fold in this life, if not in the actual blessings surrendered, at all events in the peace and joy of heart of which they were supposed to be bearers. God fills places emptied by Himself, and those emptied by us for His sake.  IV. The conscientious abstinence of Daniel had limits. The learning of the 'Chaldeans' was largely ritualistic, and magic, incantations, divination, and mythology constituted a most important part of it. Did not the conscience, which could not swallow idolatrous food, resent being forced to assimilate idolatrous learning? No; for all that learning could be acquired by a faithful monotheist, and could be used against the system which gave it birth. Like Moses, or like the young Pharisee Saul, these Jewish boys nurtured their faith by knowledge of their enemies' belief, and used their childhood's lessons as weapons in fighting for God's truth. It is not every man's duty to become familiar with error, or to master anti-Christian systems. But if it become ours, we are not to turn away from the task, nor to doubt that God will keep His own truth alight in our minds, if we realise the danger of the position, and seek to cling to Him.  V. So we have the last scene in the youths' appearance before Nebuchadnezzar. A three years' curriculum was considered necessary to turn a Jewish boy into a Chaldean expert, fit to be a traitor to his nation, an apostate from his God, and a tool of the tyrant. So far as knowledge of the priestly and astronomical science went, the four Hebrews came out at the top of the lists. The great king himself, with that personal interference in all departments which makes a despot's life so burdensome, put them through their paces, and was satisfied. His object had been to get instruments with which he could work on the Captivity, and, no doubt, also to secure servants who had no links with anybody in Babylon. Foreigners, 'kinless loons,' are favourites with despots, for plain reasons. But Nebuchadnezzar could not fathom the hearts of the lads. An incarnation of unbridled will would find it difficult to understand a life guided by conscience, and religious scruples would have sounded as an unknown tongue to him. But yet, as he and they stood face to face, who was stronger, the conqueror or the youths who feared God, and none besides? They were in their right place at the head of the examination lists. They had not said, 'We do not believe in all this rubbish, and we are not going to trouble ourselves to master it,' but they had set themselves determinedly to work, and been all the more persevering because of their objection to the diet. If a young man has to be singular by reason of his religion, let him be singularly diligent in his work, and seek to be first, not merely for his own glory, but for the sake of the religion which he professes.  'Plain living and high thinking' ought to go together. England and America have many names carved high on their annals, and written deep on their citizens' hearts, who have nourished a sublime, studious youth in poverty, 'cultivating literature on a little oatmeal,' and who all their lives have 'scorned delights and lived laborious days.' It is the temper which is most likely to succeed, but which, whether it succeeds or not, brings the best blessings to those who cultivate it. Such a youth will generally be followed by an honoured manhood like Daniel's, but will, at all events, be its own reward, and have God's blessing.  'Daniel continued unto the first year of king Cyrus.' These simple words contain volumes. During all the troubles of the nation, from the king's insanity, and the murders of his successors, amidst whirling intrigues, envies, plots, and persecutions, this one man stood firm, like a pillar amid blowing sands. So God keeps the steadfast soul which is fixed on Him; and while the world passeth away, and the fashion thereof, he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.   THE IMAGE AND THE STONE       'This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof      before the king. 37. Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God      of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and      glory. 38. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of      the field and the fowls of the heaven hath He given into thine      hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of      gold. 39. And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to      thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule      over all the earth. 40. And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as      iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all      things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in      pieces and bruise. 41. And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes,      part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be      divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron,      forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. 42. And as      the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the      kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. 43. And whereas      thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves      with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another,      even as iron is not mixed with clay. 44. And in the days of these      kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never      be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people,      but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it      shall stand for ever. 45. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone      was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in      pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the      great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass      hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof      sure. 46. Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and      worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation      and sweet odours unto him. 47. The king answered unto Daniel, and      said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord      of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal      this secret. 48. Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave      him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of      Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of      Babylon. 49. Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set      Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province      of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.'--DANIEL ii.      36-49.  The colossal image, seen by Nebuchadnezzar in his dream, was a reproduction of those which met his waking eyes, and still remain for our wonder in our museums.

The school was situated in the suburbs of the popular town of Merrifield, and was known as the Great Shirley School. It had been endowed some hundred years ago by a rich and eccentric individual who bore the name of Charles Shirley, but was now managed by a Board of Governors. By the express order of the founder, the governors were women; and very admirably did they fulfil their trust. There was no recent improvement in education, no better methods, no sanitary requirements which were not introduced into the Great Shirley School. The number of pupils was limited to four hundred, one hundred of which were foundationers and were not required to pay any fees; the remaining three hundred paid small fees in order to be allowed to secure an admirable and up-to-date education under the auspices of the great school.  There came a day in early autumn, shortly after the girls had reassembled after their summer vacation, when they streamed out of the building in groups of twenties and thirties and forties. They stood about and talked as girls will.  The Great Shirley School, well as it was managed, had perhaps a larger share than many schools of those temptations which make school a world--a world for the training either for good or evil of those who go to it. There were the girls who attended the school in the ordinary way, and there were the girls who were drafted on to the foundation from lower schools. These latter were looked down upon by the least noble and the meanest of their fellow-scholars.  There was a slight rain falling, and two or three girls standing in a group raised their umbrellas, but they still stood beside the gates.  \"She's quite the very prettiest girl I ever saw,\" cried Alice Tennant; \"but of course we can have nothing to do with her. She entered a week ago. She doesn't pay any of the fees; she has no pretence to being a lady. Oh, here she comes! Did you ever see such a face?\"  A slight, shabbily dressed little girl, with her satchel of books slung on her arm, now appeared. She looked to right and left of her as though she were slightly alarmed. Her face was beautiful in the truest sense of the world; it did not at all match with the shabby, faded clothes which she wore. She had large deep-violet eyes, jet-black hair, and a sweet, fresh complexion. Her expression was bewitching, and when she smiled a dimple came in her cheek.  \"Look--look!\" cried Mary Denny. \"Isn't she all that I have said?\"  \"Yes, and more. What a pity we can't know her!\" said Alice Tennant.  \"But can't we? I really don't see why we should make the poor child miserable,\" said Mary Denny.  \"It is not to be thought of. We must worship the beautiful new star from afar. Perhaps she will do something to raise herself into our set; but as it is, she must go with Kate Rourke and Hannah Johnson and Clara Sawyer, and all the rest of the foundationers.\"  \"Well, we have seen her now,\" said Mary, \"so I suppose we needn't stand talking about her any longer. Will you come home and have tea with me, Alice? Mother said I might ask you.\"  \"I wish I could come,\" said Alice; \"but we are expecting Kathleen.\"  \"Oh, the Irish girl! Is it really arranged that she is to come?\"  \"Yes, of course it is. She comes to-night. I have never seen her. We are all pleased, and expect that she will be a very great acquisition.\"  \"Irish girls always are,\" said Mary. \"They're so gay and full of life, and are so ridiculously witty. Don't you remember that time when we had Norah Mahoney at the school? What fun that was!\"  \"But she got into terrible scrapes, and was practically dismissed,\" said Alice. \"I only hope Kathleen won't be in that style.\"  \"But do you know anything about her? The Irish are always so terribly poor.\"  \"She is not poor at all. She has got an uncle and aunt in Chicago, and they are as rich as can be; and her uncle is coming to see her at Christmas. And besides that, her father has an awfully old castle in the south-west of Ireland. He is never troubled on account of the Land League or anything else, and Kathleen will have lots and lots of money. I know she is paying mother well for giving her a home while she is being educated at the Shirley School.\"  \"I can't imagine why she comes to our school if she is so rich,\" said Mary. \"It seems almost unfair. The Great Shirley School is not meant for rich girls: a girl of the kind you have just described ought not to become a member of the school.\"  \"Oh, that is all very fine; but it seems her mother was educated here, and swore a sort of vow that when Kathleen was old enough she should come to this school and to no other. Her mother's name is Mrs. O'Hara, and she wrote to Miss Ravenscroft and asked if there was a vacancy for Kathleen, and if she knew of any one who would be nice to her and with whom she could live. Miss Ravenscroft thought of mother; she knew that mother would like to have a boarder who would pay her well. So the whole thing was settled; mother has been corresponding with Mrs. O'Hara, and Kathleen comes to-day. I really can't stay another moment, Mary. I must rush home; there are no end of things to be attended to.\"  \"All right,\" said Mary. \"I will watch for you and the beautiful Irish heiress--\"  \"I don't know that she is an heiress.\"  \"Well, whatever she is--the bewitching Irish girl--to-morrow morning. Ta-ta for the present.\"  Mary turned to the left, and Alice continued her walk. She walked quickly. She was a well-made, rather pretty girl of fifteen. Her hair, very light in colour, hung down her back. She had a determined walk and a good carriage. As she hurried her steps she saw Ruth Craven, the pretty foundation girl, walking in front of her. Ruth walked slowly and as if she were tired. Once she pressed her hand to her side, and Alice, passing her, hesitated and looked back. The face that met hers was so appealing and loving that she could not resist saying a word.  \"Are you awfully tired, Ruth Craven?\" she said.  \"I shall get used to it,\" replied Ruth. \"I have had a cold for the last few days. Thank you so much, Miss Tennant!\"  \"Don't thank me,\" said Alice, frowning; \"and don't say 'Miss Tennant,' It isn't good form in our school. I hope you will be better to-morrow. I am sure, at least, that you will like the school very much.\"  \"Thank you,\" said the girl again.  The girls parted at the next corner. When Ruth found herself alone she paused and looked behind her. Tears rose to her eyes; she took out her handkerchief to wipe them away. She paused as if troubled by some thought; then her face grew bright, and she stepped along more briskly.  \"I am a coward, and I ought to be ashamed of myself,\" she thought. \"Now, when I go in and grandfather sees me, he will think he has done quite wrong to let me go to the Shirley School. I must not let him think that. And granny will be still more vexed. I have had my heart's desire, and because things are not quite so pleasant as I hoped they would have been, it is no reason why I should be discontented.\"  The next moment she had lifted the latch at a small cottage and entered. It was a"]]]
