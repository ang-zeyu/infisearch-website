I am so surprised and pleased that Mr. Beach should remember me. I never supposed he would, he sees so many people in London all the time, and it is quite a long time since we were there, nearly two years. Was your letter from Miss Inches, John?\"  \"Yes, and Mamma Marian sends you her love; and there's a present coming by express for you,--some sort of a book with a hard name. I can scarcely make it out, the Ru--ru--something of Omar Kay--y--Well, anyway it's a book, and she hopes you will read Emerson's 'Essay on Friendship' over before you are married, because it's a helpful utterance, and adjusts the mind to mutual conditions.\"  \"Worse than 1 Timothy, ii. 11,\" muttered Clover. \"Well, Katy dear, what next? What _are_ you laughing at?\"  \"You will never guess, I am sure. This is a letter from Miss Jane! And she has made me this pincushion!\"  The pincushion was of a familiar type, two circles of pasteboard covered with gray silk, neatly over-handed together, and stuck with a row of closely fitting pins. Miss Jane's note ran as follows:--      HILLSOVER, April 21.       DEAR KATY,--I hear from Mrs. Nipson that you are to be married     shortly, and I want to say that you have my best wishes for your     future. I think a man ought to be happy who has you for a wife.     I only hope the one you have chosen is worthy of you. Probably     he isn't, but perhaps you won't find it out. Life is a knotty     problem for most of us. May you solve it satisfactorily to     yourself and others! I have nothing to send but my good wishes     and a few pins. They are not an unlucky present, I believe, as     scissors are said to be.      Remember me to your sister, and believe me to be with true     regard,       Yours,               JANE A. BANGS.  \"Dear me, is that her name?\" cried Clover. \"I always supposed she was baptized 'Miss Jane.' It never occurred to me that she had any other title. What appropriate initials! How she used to J.A.B. with us!\"  \"Now, Clovy, that's not kind. It's a very nice note indeed, and I am touched by it. It's a beautiful compliment to say that the man ought to be happy who has got me, I think. I never supposed that Miss Jane could pay a compliment.\"  \"Or make a joke! That touch about the scissors is really jocose,--for Miss Jane. Rose Red will shriek over the letter and that particularly rigid pincushion. They are both of them so exactly like her. Dear me! only one letter left. Who is that from, Katy? How fast one does eat up one's pleasures!\"  \"But you had a letter yourself. Surely papa said so. What was that? You haven't read it to us.\"  \"No, for it contains a secret which you are not to hear just yet,\" replied Clover. \"Brides mustn't ask questions. Go on with yours.\"  \"Mine is from Louisa Agnew,--quite a long one, too. It's an age since we heard from her, you know.\"      ASHBURN, April 24.       DEAR KATY,--Your delightful letter and invitation came day     before yesterday, and thank you for both. There is nothing in     the world that would please me better than to come to your     wedding if it were possible, but it simply isn't. If you lived     in New Haven now, or even Boston,--but Burnet is so dreadfully     far off, it seems as inaccessible as Kamchatka to a person who,     like myself, has a house to keep and two babies to take care of.      Don't look so alarmed. The house is the same house you saw when     you were here, and so is one of the babies; the other is a new     acquisition just two years old, and as great a darling as Daisy     was at the same age. My mother has been really better in health     since he came, but just now she is at a sort of Rest Cure in     Kentucky; and I have my hands full with papa and the children,     as you can imagine, so I can't go off two days' journey to a     wedding,--not even to yours, my dearest old Katy. I shall think     about you all day long on _the_ day, when I know which it is,     and try to imagine just how everything looks; and yet I don't     find that quite easy, for somehow I fancy that your wedding will     be a little different from the common run. You always were     different from other people to me, you know,--you and     Clover,--and I love you so much, and I always shall.      Papa has taken a kit-kat portrait of me in oils,--and a blue     dress,--which he thinks is like, and which I am going to send     you as soon as it comes home from the framers. I hope you will     like it a little for my sake. Dear Katy, I send so much love     with it.      I have only seen the Pages in the street since they came home     from Europe; but the last piece of news here is Lilly's     engagement to Comte Ernest de Conflans. He has something to do     with the French legation in Washington, I believe; and they     crossed in the same steamer. I saw him driving with her the     other day,--a little man, not handsome, and very dark. I do not     know when they are to be married. Your Cousin Clarence is in     Colorado.      With two kisses apiece and a great hug for you, Katy, I am     always       Your affectionate friend,                             LOUISA.  \"Dear me!\" said the insatiable Clover, \"is that the very last? I wish we had another mail, and twelve more letters coming in at once. What a blessed institution the post-office is!\"     CHAPTER III.  THE FIRST WEDDING IN THE FAMILY.   The great job of the cake-making over, a sense of leisure settled on the house. There seemed nothing left to be done which need put any one out of his or her way particularly. Katy had among her other qualities a great deal of what is called \"forehandedness.\" To leave things to be attended to at the last moment in a flurry and a hurry would have been intolerable to her. She firmly believed in the doctrine of a certain wise man of our own day who says that to push your work before you is easy enough, but to pull it after you is very hard indeed.  All that winter, without saying much about it,--for Katy did not \"do her thinking outside her head,\"--she had been gradually making ready for the great event of the spring. Little by little, a touch here and a touch there, matters had been put in train, and the result now appeared in a surprising ease of mind and absence of confusion. The house had received its spring cleaning a fortnight earlier than usual, and was in fair, nice order, with freshly-beaten carpets and newly-washed curtains. Katy's dresses were ordered betimes, and had come home, been tried on, and folded away ten days before the wedding. They were not many in number, but all were pretty and in good taste, for the frigate was to be in Bar Harbor and Newport for a part of the summer, and Katy wanted to do Ned credit, and look well in his eyes and those of his friends.  All the arrangements, kept studiously simple, were beautifully systematized; and their very simplicity made them easy to carry out. The guest chambers were completely ready, one or two extra helpers were engaged that the servants might not be overworked, the order of every meal for the three busiest days was settled and written down. Each of the younger sisters had some special charge committed to her. Elsie was to wait on Cousin Helen, and see that she and her nurse had everything they wanted. Clover was to care for the two Roses; Johnnie to oversee the table arrangements, and make sure that all was right in that direction. Dear little Amy was indefatigable as a doer of errands, and her quick feet were at everybody's service to \"save steps.\" Cecy arrived, and haunted the house all day long, anxious to be of use to somebody; Mrs. Ashe put her time at their disposal; there was such a superabundance of helpers, in fact, that no one could feel over taxed. And Katy, while still serving as main spring to the whole, had plenty of time to write her notes, open her wedding presents, and enjoy her friends in a leisurely, unfatigued fashion which was a standing wonderment to Cecy, whose own wedding had been of the onerous sort, and had worn her to skin and bone.  \"I am only just beginning to recover from it now,\" she remarked plaintively, \"and there you sit, Katy, looking as fresh as a rose; not tired a bit, and never seeming to have anything on your mind. I can't think how you do it. I never was at a wedding before where everybody was not perfectly worn out.\"  \"You never were at such a simple wedding before,\" explained Katy. \"I'm not ambitious, you see. I want to keep things pretty much as they are every day, only with a little more of everything because of there being more people to provide for. If I were attempting to make it a beautiful, picturesque wedding, we should get as tired as anybody, I have no doubt.\"  Katy's gifts were numerous enough to satisfy even Clover, and comprised all manner of things, from a silver tray which came, with a rather stiff note, from Mrs. Page and Lilly, to Mary's new flour-scoop, Debby's sifter, and a bottle of home-made hair tonic from an old woman in the \"County Home.\" Each of the brothers and sisters had made her something, Katy having expressed a preference for presents of home manufacture. Mrs. Ashe gave her a beautiful sapphire ring, and Cecy Hall--as they still called her inadvertently half the time--an elaborate sofa-pillow embroidered by herself. Katy liked all her gifts, both large and small, both for what they were and for what they meant, and took a good healthy, hearty satisfaction in the fact that so many people cared for her, and had worked to give her a pleasure.  Cousin Helen was the first guest to arrive, five days before the wedding. When Dr. Carr, who had gone to Buffalo to meet and escort her down, lifted her from the carriage and carried her indoors, all of them could easily have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15798"],["title","Clover (#5)"],["body","that it was the first visit happening over again, for she looked exactly as she did then, and scarcely a day older. She happened to have on a soft gray travelling dress too, much like that which she wore on the previous occasion, which made the illusion more complete.  But there was no illusion to Cousin Helen herself. Everything to her seemed changed and quite different. The ten years which had passed so lightly over her head had made a vast alteration in the cousins whom she remembered as children. The older ones were grown up, the younger ones in a fair way to be so; even Phil, who had been in white frocks with curls falling over his shoulders at the time of her former visit to Burnet, was now fifteen and as tall as his father. He was very slight in build, and looked delicate, she thought; but Katy assured her that he was perfectly well, and thin only because he had outgrown his strength.  It was one of the delightful results of Katy's \"forehandedness\" that she could command time during those next two days to thoroughly enjoy Cousin Helen. She sat beside her sofa for hours at a time, holding her hand and talking with a freedom of confidence such as she could have shown to no one else, except perhaps to Clover. She had the feeling that in so doing she was rendering account to a sort of visible conscience of all the events, the mistakes, the successes, the glad and the sorry of the long interval that had passed since they met. It was a pleasure and relief to her; and to Cousin Helen the recital was of equal interest, for though she knew the main facts by letter, there was a satisfaction in collecting the little details which seldom get fully put into letters.  One subject only Katy touched rather guardedly; and that was Ned. She was so desirous that her cousin should approve of him, and so anxious not to raise her expectations and have her disappointed, that she would not half say how very nice she herself thought him to be. But Cousin Helen could \"read between the lines,\" and out of Katy's very reserve she constructed an idea of Ned which satisfied her pretty well.  So the two happy days passed, and on the third arrived the other anxiously expected guests, Rose Red and little Rose.  They came early in the morning, when no one was particularly looking for them, which made it all the pleasanter. Clover was on the porch twisting the honeysuckle tendrils upon the trellis when the carriage drove up to the gate, and Rose's sunny face popped out of the window. Clover recognized her at once, and with a shriek which brought all the others downstairs, flew down the path, and had little Rose in her arms before any one else could get there.  \"You see before you a deserted wife,\" was Rose's first salutation. \"Deniston has just dumped us on the wharf, and gone on to Chicago in that abominable boat, leaving me to your tender mercies. O Business, Business! what crimes are committed in thy name, as Madame Roland would say!\"  \"Never mind Deniston,\" cried Clover, with a rapturous squeeze. \"Let us play that he doesn't exist, for a little while. We have got you now, and we mean to keep you.\"  \"How pleasant you look!\" said Rose, glancing up the locust walk toward the house, which wore a most inviting and hospitable air, with doors and windows wide open, and the soft wind fluttering the vines and the white curtains. \"Ah, there comes Katy now.\" She ran forward to meet her while Clover followed with little Rose.  \"Let me det down, pease,\" said that young lady,--the first remark she had made. \"I tan walk all by myself. I am not a baby any more.\"  \"_Will_ you hear her talk?\" cried Katy, catching her up. \"Isn't it wonderful? Rosebud, who am I, do you think?\"  \"My Aunt Taty, I dess, betause you is so big. Is you mawwied yet?\"  \"No, indeed. Did you think I would get 'mawwied' without you? I have been waiting for you and mamma to come and help me.\"  \"Well, we is here,\" in a tone of immense satisfaction. \"Now you tan.\"  The larger Rose meanwhile was making acquaintance with the others. She needed no introductions, but seemed to know by instinct which was each boy and each girl, and to fit the right names to them all. In five minutes she seemed as much at home as though she had spent her life in Burnet. They bore her into the house in a sort of triumph, and upstairs to the blue bedroom, which Katy and Clover had vacated for her; and such a hubbub of talk and laughter presently issued therefrom that Cousin Helen, on the other side the entry, asked Jane to set her door open that she might enjoy the sounds,--they were so merry.  Rose's bright, rather high-pitched voice was easily distinguishable above the rest. She was evidently relating some experience of her journey, with an occasional splash by way of accompaniment, which suggested that she might be washing her hands.  \"Yes, she really has grown awfully pretty; and she had on the loveliest dark-brown suit you ever saw, with a fawn-colored hat, and was altogether dazzling; and, do you know, I was really quite glad to see her. I can't imagine why, but I was! I didn't stay glad long, however.\"  \"Why not? What did she do?\" This in Clover's voice.  \"Well, she didn't do anything, but she was distant and disagreeable. I scarcely observed it at first, I was so pleased to see one of the old Hillsover girls; and I went on being very cordial. Then Lilly tried to put me down by running over a list of her fine acquaintances, Lady this, and the Marquis of that,--people whom she and her mother had known abroad. It made me think of my old autograph book with Antonio de Vallombrosa, and the rest. Do you remember?\"  \"Of course we do. Well, go on.\"  \"At last she said something about Comte Ernest de Conflans,--I had heard of him, perhaps? He crossed in the steamer with 'Mamma and me,' it seems; and we have seen a great deal of him. This appeared a good opportunity to show that I too have relations with the nobility, so I said yes, I had met him in Boston, and my sister had seen a good deal of him in Washington last winter.  \"'And what did she think of him?' demanded Lilly.  \"'Well,' said I, 'she didn't seem to think a great deal about him. She says all the young men at the French legation seem more than usually foolish, but Comte Ernest is the worst of the lot. He really _does_ look like an absolute fool, you know,' I added pleasantly. Now, girls, what was there in that to make her angry? Can you tell? She grew scarlet, and glared as if she wanted to bite my head off; and then she turned her back and would scarcely speak to me again. Does she always behave that way when the aristocracy is lightly spoken of?\"  \"Oh, Rose,--oh, Rose,\" cried Clover, in fits of laughter, \"did you really tell her that?\"  \"I really did. Why shouldn't I? Is there any reason in particular?\"  \"Only that she is engaged to him,\" replied Katy, in an extinguished voice.  \"Good gracious! No wonder she scowled! This is really dreadful. But then why did she look so black when she asked where we were going, and I said to your wedding? That didn't seem to please her any more than my little remarks about the nobility.\"  \"I don't pretend to understand Lilly,\" said Katy, temperately; \"she is an odd girl.\"  \"I suppose an odd girl can't be expected to have an even temper,\" remarked Rose, apparently speaking with a hairpin in her mouth. \"Well, I've done for myself, that is evident. I need never expect any notice in future from the Comtesse de Conflans.\"  Cousin Helen heard no more, but presently steps sounded outside her door, and Katy looked in to ask if she were dressed, and if she might bring Rose in, a request which was gladly granted. It was a pretty sight to see Rose with Cousin Helen. She knew all about her already from Clover and Katy, and fell at once under the gentle spell which seemed always to surround that invalid sofa, begged leave to say \"Cousin Helen\" as the others did, and was altogether at her best and sweetest when with her, full of merriment, but full too of a deference and sympathy which made her particularly charming.  \"I never did see anything so lovely in all my life before,\" she told Clover in confidence. \"To watch her lying there looking so radiant and so peaceful and so interested in Katy's affairs, and never once seeming to remember that except for that accident she too would have been a bride and had a wedding! It's perfectly wonderful! Do you suppose she is never sorry for herself? She seems the merriest of us all.\"  \"I don't think she remembers herself often enough to be sorry. She is always thinking of some one else, it seems to me.\"  \"Well, I am glad to have seen her,\" added Rose, in a more serious tone than was usual to her. \"She and grandmamma are of a different order of beings from the rest of the world. I don't wonder you and Katy always were so good; you ought to be with such a Cousin Helen.\"  \"I don't think we were as good as you make us out, but Cousin Helen has really been one of the strong influences of our lives. She was the making of Katy, when she had that long illness; and Katy has made the rest of us.\"  Little Rose from the first moment became the delight of the household, and especially of Amy Ashe, who could not do enough for her, and took her off her mother's hands so entirely that Rose complained that she seemed to have lost her child as well as her husband. She was a sedate little maiden, and wonderfully wise for her years. Already, in some ways she seemed older than her erratic little mother, of whom, in a droll fashion, she assumed a sort of charge. She was a born housewife.  \"Mamma, you have fordotten your wings,\" Clover would hear her saying. \"Mamma, you has a wip in your seeve, you must mend it,\" or \"Mamma, don't fordet dat your teys is in the top dwawer,\"--all these reminders and advices being made particularly comical by the baby pronunciation. Rose's theory was that little Rose was a messenger from heaven sent to buffet her and correct her mistakes.  \"The bane and the antidote,\" she"]]]
