The whole Civil Service    might be Indian, but the Civil servants have to carry out    orders--they cannot direct, they cannot dictate the policy.    One swallow does not make the summer. One civilian,    100 or 1,000 civilians in the service of the British Government    will not make that Government Indian. There are traditions,    there are laws, there are policies to which every civilian, be    he black or brown or white, must submit, and as long as    these traditions have not been altered, as long as these principles    have not been amended, as long as that policy has not    been radically changed, the supplanting of European by    Indian agency will not make for self-government in this    country.  Nor is it from the British Government that Mr. Pal looks for, or would accept, _Swaraj_:--     If the Government were to come and tell me to-day \"Take    _Swaraj\" I would say thank you for the gift, but I will not    have that which I cannot acquire by my own hand....    Our programme is that we shall so work in the country,    so combine the resources of the people, so organize the forces    of the nation, so develop the instincts of freedom in the community,    that by this means we shall--_shall_ in the imperative--compel    the submission to our will of any power that may set    itself against us.  Equally definite is Mr. Pal as to the methods by which _Swaraj_ is to be made \"imperative.\" They consist of _Swadeshi_ in the economic domain, i.e., the encouragement of native industries reinforced by the boycott of imported goods which will kill British commerce and, in the political domain, passive resistance reinforced by the boycott of Government service.     They say:--Can you boycott all the Government offices?    Whoever said that we would? Whoever said that there    would not be found a single Indian to serve the Government    or the European community here? But what we can do is this.    We can make the Government impossible without entirely    making it impossible for them to find people to serve them.    The administration may be made impossible in a variety of    ways. It is not actually that every deputy magistrate    should say: I won't serve in it. It is not that when one    man resigns nobody will be found to take his place. But    if you create this spirit in the country the Government service    will gradually imbibe this spirit, and a whole office may go    on strike. That does not put an end to the administration,    but it creates endless complications in the work of administration,    and if these complications are created in every    part of the country, the administration will have been brought    to a deadlock and made none the less impossible, for the    primary thing is the prestige of the Government and the    boycott strikes at the root of that prestige.... We    can reduce every Indian in Government service to the position    of a man who has fallen from the dignity of Indian citizenship....    No man shall receive social honours because he is a    Hakim or a Munsiff or a Huzur Sheristadar.... No law    can compel one to give a chair to a man who comes to his    house. He may give it to an ordinary shopkeeper; he may    refuse it to the Deputy Magistrate or the Subordinate Judge.    He may give his daughter in marriage to a poor beggar,    he may refuse her to the son of a Deputy Magistrate, because    it is absolutely within his rights, absolutely within legal    bounds.     Passive resistance is recognized as legitimate in England.    It is legitimate in theory even in India, and if it is made    illegal by new legislation, these laws will infringe on the primary    rights of personal freedom and will tread on dangerous    grounds. Therefore it seems to me that by means of the boycott    we shall be able to do the negative work that will have    to be done for the attainment of _Swaraj_. Positive work    will have to be done. Without positive training no self-government    will come to the boycotter. It will (come)    through the organization of our village life; of    our talukas and districts. Let our programme    include the setting up of machinery for popular administration,    and running parallel to, but independent of, the existing    administration of the Government.... In the Providence    of God we shall then be made rulers over many things.    This is our programme.  But Mr. Pal himself admits that even if this programme can be fulfilled, this _Swaraj_, this absolute self-rule which he asks for, is fundamentally incompatible with the maintenance of the British connexion.     Is really self-government within the Empire a practicable    ideal? What would it mean? It would mean either no    real self-government for us or no real overlordship for England.    Would we be satisfied with the shadow of self-government?    If not, would England be satisfied with the shadow of overlordship?    In either case England would not be satisfied    with a shadowy overlordship, and we refuse to be satisfied    with a shadowy self-government. And therefore no compromise    is possible under such conditions between self-government    in India and the overlordship of England. If self-government    is conceded to us, what would be England's    position not only in India, but in the British Empire itself?    Self-government means the right of self-taxation; it means    the right of financial control; it means the right of the    people to impose protective and prohibitive tariffs on foreign    imports. The moment we have the right of self-taxation,    what shall we do? We shall not try to be engaged in this    uphill work of industrial boycott. But we shall do what    every nation has done. Under the circumstances in which    we live now, we shall impose a heavy prohibitive protective    tariff upon every inch of textile fabric from Manchester,    upon every blade of knife that comes from Leeds. We shall    refuse to grant admittance to a British soul into our territory.    We would not allow British capital to be engaged in    the development of Indian resources, as it is now engaged.    We would not grant any right to British capitalists to dig    up the mineral wealth of the land and carry it to their own    isles. We shall want foreign capital. But we shall apply    for foreign loans in the open market of the whole world,    guaranteeing the credit of the Indian Government, the    Indian nation, for the repayment of the loan, just as America    has done and is doing, just as Russia is doing now, just as    Japan has been doing of late. And England's commercial    interests would not be furthered in the way these are being    furthered now, under the conditions of popular self-government,    though it might be within the Empire. But what    would it mean within the Empire? It would mean that    England would have to enter into some arrangement with    us for some preferential tariff. England would have to come    to our markets on the conditions that we would impose    upon her for the purpose, if she wanted an open door in    India, and after a while, when we have developed our resources    a little and organized our industrial life, we would want the    open door not only to England, but to every part of the    British Empire. And do you think it is possible for a small    country like England with a handful of population, although    she might be enormously wealthy, to compete on fair and    equitable terms with a mighty continent like India, with    immense natural resources, with her teeming populations,    the soberest and most abstemious populations known to any    part of the world?     If we have really self-government within the Empire, if    we have the rights of freedom of the Empire as Australia    has, as Canada has, as England has to-day, if we, 300 millions    of people, have that freedom of the Empire, the Empire    would cease to be British. It would be the Indian Empire,    and the alliance between England and India would be absolutely    an unequal alliance. That would be, if we had really    self-government within the Empire, exactly the relation as    co-partners in a co-British or anti-British Empire of the    future; and if the day comes when England will be reduced    to the alternative of having us as an absolutely independent    people or a co-partner with her in the Empire, she would    prefer to have us, like the Japanese, as an ally and no longer    a co-partner, because we are bound to be the predominant    partner in this Imperial firm. Therefore no sane Englishman,    politician or publicist can ever contemplate seriously the    possibility of a self-governing India, like the self-governing    colonies, forming a vital and organic part of the British    Empire. Therefore it is that Lord Morley says that so    long as India remains under the control of Great Britain    the government of India must continue to be a personal    and absolute one. Therefore it seems to me that this ideal,    the practically attainable ideal of self-government within the    Empire, when we analyse it with care, when we study it in    the light of common human psychology, when we study    it in the light of our past experience of the racial characteristics    of the British people, when we study it in the light of past    British history in India and other parts of the world, when    we study and analyse this ideal of self-government within    the Empire, we find it is a far more impracticable thing to    attain than even our ideal _Swaraj_.  I have quoted Mr. Pal's utterances at some length, because they are the fullest and the most frank exposition available of what lies beneath the claim to Colonial self-government as it is understood by \"advanced\" politicians. No one can deny the merciless logic with which he analyses the inevitable results of _Swaraj_, and Englishmen may well be grateful to him for having disclosed them so fearlessly."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16444"],["title","Indian Unrest (#5)"],["body","sympathizers who are reluctant to look behind a formula which commends itself to their peculiar predilections, naturally dislike any reference to Mr. Pal's interpretation of Indian \"self-government,\" and would even impugn his character in order the better to question his authority. But they cannot get over the fact that in India, very few \"moderate\" politicians have had the courage openly to repudiate his programmes, though many of them realize its dangers, whilst the \"extremists\" want a much shorter cut to the same goal. It is only by pledging itself to _Swaraj_ that the Indian National Congress has been able to maintain a semblance of unity.  Moreover, if any doubt still lingers as to the inner meaning of _Swaraj_ and _Swadeshi_, and other kindred war-cries of Indian Nationalism, the language of the Nationalist Press remains on record to complete our enlightenment. However incompatible with the maintenance of British rule may be the propositions set forth by Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal, they contain no incitement to violence, no virulent diatribes against Englishmen. It is in the Press rather than on the platform that Indian politicians, whether \"extreme\" or merely \"advanced\" are apt to let themselves go. They write down to the level of their larger audiences. So little has hitherto been done to enlighten public opinion at home as to the gravity of the evil which the recent Indian Press law has at last, though very tardily, done something to repress that many Englishmen are still apparently disposed to regard that measure as an oppressive, or at least dubious, concession to bureaucratic impatience of criticism none the less healthy for being sometimes excessive.[1] The following quotations, taken from vernacular papers before the new Press law was enacted, will serve to show what Lord Morley meant when he said, \"You may put picric acid in the ink and the pen just as much as in any steel bomb,\" and again, \"It is said that these incendiary articles are 'mere froth.' Yes, they are froth, but froth stained with bloodshed.\" Even when they contain no definite incitement to murder, no direct exhortation to revolt, they will show how systematically, how persistently the wells of Indian public opinion have been poisoned for years past by those who claim to represent the intelligence and enlightenment of modern India. Only too graphically also do they illustrate one of the most unpleasantly characteristic features of the literature of Indian unrest--namely, its insidious appeals to the Hindu Scriptures and the Hindu deities, and its deliberate vilification of everything English. Calumny and abuse, combined with a wealth of sacred imagery, supply the place of any serious process of reasoning such as is displayed in Mr. Pal's programme with all its uncompromising hostility.  In the first place, a few specimens of the hatred which animates the champions of _Swaraj_--of Indian independence, or, at least, of Colonial self-government. The _Hind Swarajya_ is nothing if not plain-spoken:--     Englishmen! Who are Englishmen? They are the present    rulers of this country. But how did they become    our rulers? By throwing the noose of dependence round our    necks, by making us forget our old learning, by leading us    along the path of sin, by keeping us ignorant of the use of    arms.... Oh! my simple countrymen! By their    teaching adultery has entered our homes, and women have    begun to be led astray.... Alas! Has India's golden    land lost all her heroes? Are all eunuchs, timid and afraid,    forgetful of their duty, preferring to die a slow death of torture,    silent witnesses of the ruin of their country? Oh!    Indians, descended from a race of heroes! Why are you afraid    of Englishmen? They are not gods, but men like yourselves,    or, rather, monsters who have ravished your Sita-like beauty    [Sita, the spouse of Rama, was abducted by the demon    Ravana, and recovered with the help of the Monkey God    Hanuman and his army of monkeys]. If there be any Rama    amongst you, let him go forth to bring back your Sita. Raise    the banner of Swadesh, crying Victory to the Mother! Rescue    the truth and accomplish the good of India.  The Calcutta _Yugantar_ argues that \"sedition has no meaning from the Indian standpoint.\"     If the whole nation is inspired to throw off its yoke and    become independent, then in the eye of God and the eye of    Justice whose claim is more reasonable, the Indian's or the    Englishman's? The Indian has come to see that independence    is the panacea for all his evils. He will therefore even    swim in a sea of blood to reach his goal. The British    dominion over India is a gross myth. It is because the Indian    holds this myth in his bosom that his sufferings are so great    to-day. Long ago the Indian Rishis [inspired sages] preached    the destruction of falsehood and the triumph of truth. And    this foreign rule based on injustice is a gross falsehood. It    must be subverted and true _Swadeshi_ rule established. May    truth be victorious!  The _Gujarat_ hails the Hindu New Year which is coming \"to take away the curse of the foreigners\":--     Oh noble land of the Aryas, thou who wert so great art like    a caged bird. Are thy powerful sons, Truth and Love, dead?    Has thy daughter Lakshmi plunged into the sea? or art    thou overwhelmed with grief because rogues and demons    have plundered thee? [\"Demons\" is the term usually affected    by Nationalist journalists when they refer to Englishmen.]  The _Shakti_ declares that:--     By whatever names--anarchists, extremists, or seditionists    --those may be called who are taking part in the movement    for independence, whatever efforts may be made to humiliate    and to crush them, however many patriots may be sent to    jail, or into exile, yet the spirit pervading the whole atmosphere    will never be checked, for the spirit is so strong and spontaneous    that it must clearly be directed by Divine Providence.  The following appears In the _Kal_ (Poona):--     We Aryans are no sheep. We have our own country, our    religion, our heroes, our statesmen, our soldiers. We do    not owe them to contact with the English. These things    are not new to us. When the ancestors of those who boast    to-day of their enterprise and their civilization were in a    disgusting state of barbarism, or rather centuries before then,    we were in full possession of all the ennobling qualities of    head and heart. This holy and hoary land of ours will surely    regain her position and be once more by her intrinsic lustre    the home of wealth, arts, and peace. A holy inspiration    is spreading, that people must sacrifice their lives in the    cause of what has once been determined to be their duty.    Heroes are springing up in our midst, though brutal imprisonment    reduce them to skeletons. Let us devote ourselves    to the service of the Mother. A man maddened by    devotion will do everything and anything to achieve his    ideal. His strength will be adamantine. Just as a widow    immolates herself on the funeral pyre of her husband, let    us die for the Mother.  The _Dharma_ (Calcutta) emphasizes specially the religious side of the movement:--     We are engaged in preaching religion and we are putting    our energy into this agitation, looking on it as the principal    part of our religion.... The present agitation, in its    initial stages, had a strong leaven of the spirit of Western    politics in it, but at present a clear consciousness of Aryan    greatness and a strong love and reverential spirit towards    the Motherland have transformed it into a shape in which    the religious element predominates. Politics is part of religion,    but it has to be cultivated in an Aryan way, in accordance    with the precepts of Aryan religion.  Nowhere is the cult of the \"terrible goddess,\" worshipped under many forms, but chiefly under those of Kali and Durga, more closely associated with Indian unrest than in Bengal. Hence the frequency of the appeals to her in the Bengal Press. The _Dacca Gazette_ welcomes the festival of Durga with the following outburst:--     Indian brothers! There is no more time for lying asleep.    Behold, the Mother is coming. Oh Mother, the giver of all    good! Turn your eyes upon your degraded children. Mother,    they are now stricken with disease and sorrow. Oh Shyama,    the reliever of the three kinds of human afflictions, relieve    our sorrows. Come Mother, the destroyer of the demons,    and appear at the gates of Bengal.  The Barisal _Hitaishi_ refers also to the Durga festival, in which the weird and often horrible and obscene rites of _Skakti_ worship not infrequently play a conspicuous part:--     What have we learnt from the _Shakti Puja_? Sooner or    later this great _Puja_ will yield the desired results. When the    Hindus realize the true magnificence of the worship of the    Mother, they will be roused from the slumber of ages, and    the auspicious dawn of awakenment will light up the horizon.    You must acquire great power from the worship of the Mother.    Ganesh, the god who grants success, has his seat assigned    to him on the left of the great Mother. Why should you    despair of obtaining success? Look at Kartiki, the god    who is the chief commander of the armies of the gods, who    has stationed himself to the right of the Mother; he is    coming forward with his bow, to assist you against the demons    of sin, who stand in the way of your accomplishing that great    object, and as he is up in arms, who can resist?  The _Khulnavasi_ breaks out into poetry:--     For what sins, O Mother Durga, are thy sons thus dispirited    and their hearts crushed with injustice? The demons    are in the ascendant, and constantly triumphing over godliness.    Awake, Oh Mother, who tramplest on the demons!    Thy helpless sons, lean for want of food, worn out in the    struggle with the demons, "]]]
