O'ER THE PROPHECY PORED QUOG TOOK THE CHAIR ON THE ROYAL DOOR-MAT TAKING THE AIR    Let him who is minded to meet with a Glug Pluck three hardy hairs from a rabbit-skin rug;   Blow one to the South, and one to the West,   Then burn another and swallow the rest. And who shall explain 'tis the talk of a fool, He's a Glug!  He's a Glug of the old Gosh school!   And he'll climb a tree, if the East wind blows,   In a casual way, just to show he knows . . .      Now, tickle his toes!      Oh, tickle his toes! And don't blame me if you come to blows.  --OLD GOSH RHYME    I.  THE GLUG QUEST  Follow the river and cross the ford,   Follow again to the wobbly bridge, Turn to the left at the notice board,   Climbing the cow-track over the ridge; Tip-toe soft by the little red house,   Hold your breath if they touch the latch, Creep to the slip-rails, still as a mouse,   Then . . . run like mad for the bracken patch.  Worm your way where the fern fronds tall   Fashion a lace-work over your head, Hemming you in with a high, green wall;   Then, when the thrush calls once, stop dead. Ask of the old grey wallaby there--   Him prick-eared by the woollybutt tree-- How to encounter a Glug, and where   The country of Gosh, famed Gosh may be.  But, if he is scornful, if he is dumb, Hush! There's another way left. Then come.  On a white, still night, where the dead tree bends   Over the track, like a waiting ghost, Travel the winding road that wends   Down to the shore on an Eastern coast. Follow it down where the wake of the moon   Kisses the ripples of silver sand; Follow it on where the night seas croon   A traveller's tale to the listening land.  Step not jauntily, not too grave,   Till the lip of the languorous sea you greet; Wait till the wash of the thirteenth wave   Tumbles a jellyfish out at your feet. Not too hopefully, not forlorn,   Whisper a word of your earnest quest; Shed not a tear if he turns in scorn   And sneers in your face like a fish possessed.  Hist! Hope on! There is yet a way. Brooding jellyfish won't be gay.  Wait till the clock in the tower booms three,   And the big bank opposite gnashes its doors, Then glide with a gait that is carefully free   By the great brick building of seventeen floors; Haste by the draper who smirks at his door,   Straining to lure you with sinister force, Turn up the lane by the second-hand store,   And halt by the light bay carrier's horse.  By the carrier's horse with the long, sad face   And the wisdom of years in his mournful eye; Bow to him thrice with a courtier's grace,   Proffer your query, and pause for reply. Eagerly ask for a hint of the Glug,   Pause for reply with your hat in your hand; If he responds with a snort and a shrug   Strive to interpret and understand.  Rare will a carrier's horse condescend. Yet there's another way. On to the end!  Catch the four-thirty; your ticket in hand,   Punched by the porter who broods in his box; Journey afar to the sad, soggy land,   Wearing your shot-silk lavender socks. Wait at the creek by the moss-grown log   Till the blood of a slain day reddens the West. Hark for the croak of a gentleman frog,   Of a corpulent frog with a white satin vest.  Go as he guides you, over the marsh,   Treading with care on the slithery stones, Heedless of night winds moaning and harsh   That seize you and freeze you and search for your bones. On to the edge of a still, dark pool,   Banishing thoughts of your warm wool rug; Gaze in the depths of it, placid and cool,   And long in your heart for one glimpse of a Glug.  \"Krock!\" Was he mocking you? \"Krock! Kor-r-rock!\" Well, you bought a return, and it's past ten o'clock.  Choose you a night when the intimate stars   Carelessly prattle of cosmic affairs. Flat on your back, with your nose pointing Mars,   Search for the star who fled South from the Bears. Gaze for an hour at that little blue star,   Giving him, cheerfully, wink for his wink; Shrink to the size of the being you are;   Sneeze if you have to, but softly; then think.  Throw wide the portals and let your thoughts run   Over the earth like a galloping herd. Bounds to profundity let there be none,   Let there be nothing too madly absurd. Ponder on pebbles or stock exchange shares,   On the mission of man or the life of a bug, On planets or billiards, policemen or bears,   Alert all the time for the sight of a Glug.  Meditate deeply on softgoods or sex,   On carraway seeds or the causes of bills, Biology, art, or mysterious wrecks,   Or the tattered white fleeces of clouds on blue hills. Muse upon ologies, freckles and fog,   Why hermits live lonely and grapes in a bunch, On the ways of a child or the mind of a dog,   Or the oyster you bolted last Friday at lunch.  Heard you no sound like a shuddering sigh! Or the great shout of laughter that swept down the sky? Saw you no sign on the wide Milky Way? Then there's naught left to you now but to pray.  Sit you at eve when the Shepherd in Blue   Calls from the West to his clustering sheep. Then pray for the moods that old mariners woo,   For the thoughts of young mothers who watch their babes sleep. Pray for the heart of an innocent child,   For the tolerant scorn of a weary old man, For the petulant grief of a prophet reviled,   For the wisdom you lost when your whiskers began.  Pray for the pleasures that he who was you   Found in the mud of a shower-fed pool, For the fears that he felt and the joys that he knew   When a little green lizard crept into the school. Pray as they pray who are maddened by wine:   For distraction from self and a spirit at rest. Now, deep in the heart of you search for a sign--   If there be naught of it, vain is your quest.  Lay down the book, for to follow the tale Were to trade in false blame, as all mortals who fail. And may the gods salve you on life's dreary round; For 'tis whispered: \"Who finds not, 'tis he shall be found!\"    II.  JOI, THE GLUG  The Glugs abide in a far, far land That is partly pebbles and stones and sand    But mainly earth of a chocolate hue,    When it isn't purple or slightly blue. And the Glugs live there with their aunts and their wives, In draught-proof tenements all their lives.    And they climb the trees when the weather is wet,    To see how high they can really get.       Pray, don't forget,    This is chiefly done when the weather is wet.  And every shadow that flits and hides, And every stream that glistens and glides    And laughs its way from a highland height,    All know the Glugs quite well by sight. And they say, \"Our test is the best by far; For a Glug is a Glug; so there you are!    And they climb the trees when it drizzles or hails    To get electricity into their nails;       And the Glug that fails    Is a luckless Glug, if it drizzles or hails.\"  Now, the Glugs abide in the lands of Gosh; And they work all day for the sake of Splosh.    For Splosh, the First, is the Nation's pride,    And King of the Glugs, on his uncle's side. And they sleep at night, for the sake of rest; For their doctors say this suits them best.    And they climb the trees, as a general rule,    For exercise, when the weather is cool.       They're taught at school    To climb the trees when the weather is cool.  And the whispering grass on the gay green hills And every cricket that skirls and shrills,    And every moonbeam, gleaming white,    All know the Glugs quite well by sight. And they say, \"It is safe, it is the test we bring; For a Glug is an awful Gluglike thing.    And they climb the trees when there's a sign of fog,    To scan the land for a feasible dog.       They love to jog    Thro' dells in quest of a feasible dog.\"  The Glugs eat meals three times a day Because their fathers ate that way.    Their grandpas said the scheme was good    To help the Glugs digest their food. And 'tis wholesome food the Glugs have got, For it says so plain on the tin and pot.    And they climb the trees when the weather is dry    To get a glimpse of the pale green sky.       We don't know why,    But they like to gaze on the pale green sky.  And every cloud that sails aloft, And every breeze that blows so soft,    And every star that shines at night,    All know the Glugs quite well by sight. For they say, \"Our test, it is safe and true; What one Glug does, the other Glugs do;    And they climb the trees when the weather is hot,    For a birds'-eye view of the garden plot.       Of course, it's rot,    But they love that view of the garden plot.\"  At half-past two on a Wednesday morn A most peculiar Glug was born;    And later on, when he grew a man,    He scoffed and sneered at the Chosen Plan. \"It's wrong!\" said this Glug, whose name was Joi. \"Bah!\" said the Glugs.  \"He's a crazy boy!\"    And they climbed the trees, as the West wind stirred,    To hark to the note of the Guffer Bird.       It seems absurd,    But they're foolishly fond of the Guffer Bird.  And every reed that rustles and sways By the gurgling river that plashes and plays,    And the beasts of the dread, neurotic night    All know the Glugs quite well by sight. And, \"Why,\" say they; \"It is easily done; For a dexter Glug's like a sinister one!\"    And they climb the trees.  Oh, they climb the trees!    And they bark their knuckles, and chafe their knees;    And 'tis one of the world's great mysteries       That things like these    Get into the serious histories.    III.  THE STONES OF GOSH  Now, here is a tale of the Glugs of Gosh,    And a wonderful tale I ween, Of the Glugs of Gosh and their great King Splosh,    And"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16362"],["title","The Glugs of Gosh (#1)"],["body",", his virtuous Queen. And here is a tale of the crafty Ogs,    In their neighbouring land of Podge; Of their sayings and doings and plottings and brewings,    And something about Sir Stodge.       Wise to profundity,       Stout to rotundity,    That was the Knight, Sir Stodge.  Oh, the King was rich, and the Queen was fair, And they made a very respectable pair.    And whenever a Glug in that peaceful land,    Did anything no one could understand, The Knight, Sir Stodge, he looked in a book, And charged that Glug with a crime called Crook.    And the great Judge Fudge, who wore for a hat    The sacred skin of a tortoiseshell cat, He fined that Glug for his action rash, And frequently asked a deposit in cash.    Then every Glug, he went home to his rest    With his head in a bag and his toes to the West;       For they knew it was best,    Since their grandpas slept with their toes to the West.  But all of the tale that is so far told    Has nothing whatever to do With the Ogs of Podge, and their crafty dodge,    And the trade in pickles and glue. To trade with the Glugs came the Ogs to Gosh,    And they said in seductive tones, \"We'll sell you pianers and pickels and spanners    For seventeen shiploads of stones:       Smooth 'uns or nobbly 'uns,       Firm 'uns or wobbly 'uns,    All we ask is stones.\"  And the King said, \"What?\" and the Queen said, \"Why, That is awfully cheap to the things I buy!    For that grocer of ours in the light brown hat    Asks two and eleven for pickles like that!\" But a Glug stood up with a wart on his nose, And cried, \"Your Majesties! Ogs is foes!\"    But the Glugs cried, \"Peace! Will you hold your jaw!    How did our grandpas fashion the law?\" Said the Knight, Sir Stodge, as he opened his Book, \"When the goods were cheap then the goods we took.\"    So they fined the Glug with the wart on his nose    For wearing a wart with his everyday clothes. And the goods were brought home thro' a Glug named Ghones; And the Ogs went home with their loads of stones,    Which they landed with glee in the land of Podge.       Do you notice the dodge?    Not yet did the Glugs, nor the Knight, Sir Stodge.  In the following Summer the Ogs came back    With a cargo of eight-day clocks, And hand-painted screens, and sewing machines,    And mangles, and scissors, and socks. And they said, \"For these excellent things we bring    We are ready to take more stones;       And in bricks or road-metal       For goods you will settle    Indented by your Mister Ghones.\"       Cried the Glugs praisingly,       \"Why how amazingly    Smart of industrious Ghones!\"  And the King said, \"Hum,\" and the Queen said, \"Oo! That curtain!  What a bee-ootiful blue!\"    But a Glug stood up with some very large ears,    And said, \"There is more in this thing than appears! And we ought to be taxing those goods of the Ogs, Or our industries soon will be gone to the dogs.\"    And the King said, \"Bosh!  You're un-Gluggish and rude!\"    And the Queen said, \"What an absurd attitude!\" Then the Glugs cried, \"Down with political quacks! How did our grandpas look at a tax?\"    So the Knight, Sir Stodge, he opened his Book.    \"No tax,\" said he, \"wherever I look.\" Then they fined the Glug with the prominent ears For being old-fashioned by several years;    And the Ogs went home with the stones, full-steam.       Did you notice the scheme?    Nor yet did the Glugs in their dreamiest dreams.  Then every month to the land of the Gosh    The Ogs, they continued to come, With buttons and hooks, and medical books,    And rotary engines, and rum, Large cases with labels, occasional tables,    Hair tonic and fiddles and 'phones; And the Glugs, while copncealing their joy in the dealing,    Paid promptly in nothing but stones.       Why, it was screamingly       Laughable, seemingly---    Asking for nothing but stones!  And the King said, \"Haw!\" and the Queen said, \"Oh! Our drawing-room now is a heavenly show    Of large overmantels, and whatnots, and chairs,    And a statue of Splosh at the head of the stairs!\" But a Glug stood up with a cast in his eye, And he said, \"Far too many baubles we buy;    With all the Gosh factories closing their doors,    And importers' warehouses lining our shores.\" But the Glugs cried, \"Down with such meddlesome fools! What did our grandpas lay down in their rules?\"    And the Knight, Sir Stodge, he opened his Book:    \"To Cheapness,\" he said, \"was the road they took.\" Then every Glug who was not too fat Turned seventeen handsprings, and jumped on his hat.    They fined the Glug with the cast in his eye    For looking both ways--which he did not deny-- And for having no visible precedent, which Is a crime in the poor and a fault in the rich.  So the Glugs continued, with greed and glee, To buy cheap clothing, and pills, and tea;    Till every Glug in the land of Gosh    Owned three clean shirts and a fourth in the wash. But they all grew idle, and fond of ease, And easy to swindle, and hard to please;    And the voice of Joi was a lonely voice,    When he railed at Gosh for its foolish choice. But the great King grinned, and the good Queen gushed, As the goods of the Ogs were madly rushed.    And the Knight, Sir Stodge, with a wave of his hand,    Declared it a happy and prosperous land.    IV.  SYM, THE SON OF JOI  Now Joi, the rebel, he had a son   In far, far Gosh where the tall trees wave. Said Joi: \"In Gosh there shall yet be one   To scorn this life of a self-made slave; To spurn the law of the Knight, Sir Stodge,   And end the rule of the great King Splosh; Who shall warn the Glugs of their crafty dodge,   And at last bring peace, sweet peace, to Gosh.\"  Said he: \"Whenever the kind sun showers His golden treasure on grateful flowers,   With upturned faces and hearts bowed low,   The Glugs shall know what the wild things know.\" Said he: \"Wherever the broad fields smile, They shall walk with clean minds, free of guile;   They shall scoff aloud at the call of Greed,   And turn to their labours and never heed.\"  So Joi had a son, and his name was Sym;   And his eyes were wide as the eyes of Truth; And there came to the wondering mind of him    Long thoughts of the riddle that vexes youth. And, \"Father,\" he said, \"in the mart's loud din    Is there aught of pleasure?  Do some find joy?\" But his father tilted the beardless chin,    And looked in the eyes of the questing boy.  Said he: \"Whenever the fields are green, Lie still, where the wild rose fashions a screen,    While the brown thrush calls to his love-wise mate,    And know what they profit who trade with Hate.\" Said he: \"Whenever the great skies spread, In the beckoning vastness overhead,    A tent for the blue wren building a nest,    Then, down in the heart of you, learn what's best.\"  And there came to Sym as he walked afield    Deep thoughts of the world and the folk of Gosh. He saw the idols to which they kneeled;    He marked them cringe to the name of Splosli. Is it meet,\" he asked, \"that a soul should crawl    To a purple robe or a gilded chair?\" But his father walked to the garden's wall    And stooped to a rose-bush flowering there.  Said he: \"Whenever a bursting bloom Looks up to the sun, may a soul find room   For a measure of awe at the wondrous birth   Of one more treasure to this glad earth.\" Said he: \"Whenever a dewdrop clings To a gossamer thread, and glitters and swings,   Deep in humility bow your head   To a thing for a blundering rnortal's dread.\"  And there came to Sym in his later youth,   With the first clear glance in the face of guile, Thirst for knowledge and thoughts of truth,   Of gilded baubles, and things worth while. And he said, \"There is much that a Glug should know;   But his mind is clouded, his years are few.\" Then joi, the father, he answered low   As his thoughts ran back to the youth he knew.  Said he: \"Whenever the West wind stirs, And birds in feathers and beasts in furs   Steal out to dance in the glade, lie still:   Let your heart teach you what it will.\" Said he: \"Whenever the moonlight creeps Thro' inlaced boughs, a'nd a shy star peeps   Adown from its crib in the cradling sky,   Know of their folly who fear to die.\"  New interest came to the mind of Sym,   As 'midst his fellows he lived and toiled. But the ways of the Glug folk puzzled him;   For some won honour, while some were foiled; Yet all were filled with a vague unrest   As they climbed their trees in an endless search. But joi, the father, he mocked their quest,   When he marked a Glug on his hard-won perch.  Said he: \"Whenever these tales are heard Of the Feasible Dog or the Guffer Bird,   Then laugh and laugh till the fat tears roll   To the roots of the joy-bush deep in your soul. When you see them squat on the tree-tops high, Scanning for ever that heedless sky,   Lie flat on your back on the good, green earth   And roar till the great vault echoes your mirth.\"  As he walked in the city, to Sym there came   Sounds envenomed with fear and hate, Shouts of anger and words of shame,   As Glug blamed Glug for his woeful state. \"This blame?\" said Sym, \"Is it mortal's right   To blame his fellow for aught he be?\" But the father said, \"Do we blame the night   When darkness gathers and none can see?\"  Said he: \"Whenever there springs from earth A plant all crooked and marred at birth,    Shall we, unlearned in the Gardener's scheme,    Blame plant or earth for the faults that seem?\" Said he: \"Whenever your wondering eyes Look out on the glory of earth and skies,    Shall you, 'mid the blessing of fields a-bloom,    Fling blame at the blind man, prisoned in gloom?\"  So Joi had a son, and his name was Sym;    Far from the ken of the great King Splosh. And small was the Glugs' regard of him,    Mooning along in the streets of Gosh. But many a creature by field and ford    Shared in the schooling of that strange boy, Dreaming and planning to gather and hoard    Knowledge of all things precious to Joi.    V.
