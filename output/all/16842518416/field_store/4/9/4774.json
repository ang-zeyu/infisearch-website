All the people listened, charmed into stillness. But the boy Bernhard, on Irma's knee, folded by her soft arm, grew restless as the story lengthened, and began to prattle softly at his mother's ear.  \"Mother,\" whispered the child, \"why did you cry out so loud, when the priest was going to send me to Valhalla?\"  \"Oh, hush, my child,\" answered the mother, and pressed him closer to her side.  \"Mother,\" whispered the boy again, laying his finger on the stains upon her breast, \"see, your dress is red! What are these stains? Did some one hurt you?\"  The mother closed his mouth with a kiss. \"Dear, be still, and listen!\"  The boy obeyed. His eyes were heavy with sleep. But he heard the last words of Winfried as he spoke of the angelic messengers, flying over the hills of Judea and singing as they flew. The child wondered and dreamed and listened. Suddenly his face grew bright. He put his lips close to Irma's cheek again.  \"Oh, mother!\" he whispered very low, \"do not speak. Do you hear them? Those angels have come back again. They are singing now behind the tree.\"  And some say that it was true; but others say that it was only Gregor and his companions at the lower end of the hall, chanting their Christmas hymn:  All glory be to God on high, And to the earth be peace!

It affords me great pleasure to write a short preface to this book, since it deals with a matter in which I (in common with all those who are intensely interested in the health of our race) am glad to take an active part.  To no woman has it been permitted to do the same amount of good, and to save more misery and suffering, both during and after the war, than to Miss Ettie Rout. Her superhuman energy and indomitable perseverance enabled her to perform, in the most efficient manner possible, a work which few women would care to handle, and of which but an infinitesimally small number are capable. The French Government fully recognised the great services she rendered to the Allies, and did her honour. The book she has written is one of very great value, in that its object is the Health, Happiness, Morality and Well-being of the Community.  Not only has Miss Ettie Rout the qualities that characterise all great humanitarians, but she also possesses, in a unique degree, an intimate knowledge of the terrible troubles that arise from irregular intercourse, and of the manner in which they can be reduced and perhaps eliminated.  In this book she deals with such simple hygienic measures as are little known in England, though they are in common use in France and in the United States, in both of which countries sound practical common sense prevails.  She is persuaded that marriage is the goal to be reached by all, and that everything possible should be done to facilitate it, and so to diminish vice. In her efforts to bring about this happy issue she has the good wishes and congratulations of all who have the health of the community at heart.  W.

FOREWORD.   This book embodies the considered opinions of twenty-five years' practical experience of adult life--as an official reporter and journalist, as a voluntary war-worker, and as a married woman. For many of the thoughts and expressions used I am indebted to large numbers of men and women whom I cannot name, and with whom I have been personally and professionally associated in different parts of the world. I am also indebted to the following medical journals for the publication, during the last five years, of many letters, articles, notes, etc.: _The Lancet_, _The British Medical Journal_, _Public Health_, _Municipal Engineering_, _Hospital_, _New York Medical Journal_, etc., etc.  I have to thank the Society for the Prevention of Venereal Disease, the National Birth-Rate Commission, and the Joint Select Committee (House of Lords) on Criminal Law Amendment Bills for recording various statements and evidence.  It remains only to state this fact: That on January 25th, 1922, Sir Arbuthnot Lane, Sir Frederick Mott, Surgeon-Commander Hamilton Boyden, of the Royal Navy, and Mr. Harman Freese, of Freese & Moon, manufacturing chemists, of 59, Bermondsey Street, London, S.E.1, met at my home to decide upon the best medical formulæ for self-disinfecting ointment for men and contraceptive-disinfecting-suppositories for women. Mr. Freese made up sanitary tubes and sanitary suppositories in accordance with these formulæ, but he is prohibited by law from recommending these for the prevention of venereal disease, and forbidden to supply printed directions with them, whereas similar medicaments are being retailed with printed directions in the State of Pennsylvania, and the Health Department circularises medical practitioners thus:--       \"The self-treatment packet, obtainable at drug stores, to arrest      venereal infection after exposure, is approved by the State      Department of Health on the same principle as is antitoxin given to      diphtheria contacts. Proof is lacking that the use of this packet      lowers social standards. Reduction in the incidence of venereal      disease is a direct result.\"  But not only in the clear, cool air of American State Departments of Health is the knowledge and love of sexual cleanliness fructifying. In the _Dublin Review_ for January-March, 1922, there is a wonderfully fine article on \"The Church and Prostitution,\" by the Right Rev. Monsignor Provost W.F. Brown, D.D., V.G., in which he quotes from a very recent Moral Theology, \"De Castitate,\" by the Rev. A. Vermeersch, S.J., Professor of Moral Theology at the Gregorian University, Rome, published in May, 1921. The author of \"De Castitate\" gives brief answers to three questions put to him, which Mgr. Brown quotes in the original Latin, and of which the following is a translation furnished by a Catholic priest:--       \"You ask       1. Whether or not it is formally sinful to use antiseptic ointment      before illicit intercourse.       2. Whether or not the use of such ointment may be advocated.       3. Whether or not it is lawful for chemists to sell it.       Ad. 1. Although it seems that in England (_cf. Times_, January,      1917) some have made a scrupulous distinction between the use of      this ointment _before_ and _after_, and have forbidden the former      while approving the latter, you need make no such distinction (of      course, supposing the ointment is not used by a woman to      sterilize). It is not wrong to seek means, indifferent in      themselves, which will prevent the evil consequences of sin.       Ad. 2. It would indeed be a sin to reveal such drugs or to persuade      their use with the intention to induce a man to commit sin; but      there is no harm in telling a man who is certainly going to sin how      to avoid the consequences. Ad. 3. If men could be restrained from      vice by prohibiting the sales, this should be done; but so many are      ready to expose themselves to danger that you cannot hope for such      a result from forbidding the sale. It is true this removes _fear_,      but the general good, and the removal of danger to the innocent      justifies this. Besides, it is a poor virtue which is kept from sin      only by the fear of disease.\"  Having gone so far as to admit the desirability and necessity of the medical prevention of sexual diseases, the Roman Catholic Church will certainly find itself later unable to deny the desirability and necessity of preventing the birth of children liable to be born diseased or unfit. It is not practicable for a wife to take any suitable precautions against infection by a diseased husband, which precautions will not at the same time be effective, to a greater or lesser extent, in the prevention of "]]]
