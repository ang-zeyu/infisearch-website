IMPRESSIONS AND OBSERVATIONS AT SEA. REMARKS ON VOYAGE FROM BAHIA TO THE CAPE.  August 25.  Re-embarked in the Beagle and sailed for the Cape of Good Hope.  September 10.  We had yesterday and all last night a gale of wind, succeeded this day by a heavy fall of rain. The wind had raised a very high sea, but when the rain began to fall I heard the captain and several of the officers remark that the rain would lay the sea; for the result of their experience was, \"that a fall of rain always beats the sea down.\" What they had stated would occur took place in this instance within two or three hours. This shows forcibly what great results a slight force, continued for a long time, will produce.  September 15.  Whilst standing on the deck of the Beagle this evening we remarked large luminous spots in the water. They appeared to be about 12 inches in circumference, were very numerous, and perfectly stationary. The light they emitted was phosphorescent, but far brighter than I had ever before witnessed; it was so vivid as to be distinctly visible for nearly a quarter of a mile.  September 16.  We saw this morning an immense number of fin-backed whales, some of which were quite close to the vessel. In the course of half an hour I counted thirty of them. Could they have been feeding on the phosphorescent animals we saw last night?  We are today about 600 miles from the Cape, and there is a strange discordance amongst the elements. From the south-west comes a long and heavy swell; a strong breeze is blowing from the east, and threatening clouds spring upwards from the north. These omens have a meaning. Down to the southward, somewhere off Cape Horn, there blows a furious gale. The wind will draw round shortly to the northward. That is the interpretation and the reading.  A swell like this one can only witness off the Cape of Good Hope. It was to me a novel and magnificent sight. Uniform and lofty ridges of waves advancing in rapid succession, and yet with so regular and undisturbed a motion that one might easily fancy these great walls of water to be stationary: yet onward they moved in uniform and martial order; whilst as the ship rose upon their crests she seemed to hover for a moment over the ocean in mid air. And now the wind drew round to the northward and it blew almost a gale. The vessel felt its power and bent before it. It was beautiful to watch the process of hand-reefing topsails and making the vessel snug--the ready obedience to the word of command and the noiseless discipline with which each duty was fulfilled. First had the men clustered on the rigging like bees; then at the word to lay out they fearlessly extended themselves along the yard-arm, and whilst they took in the reefs the ship pitched and rolled so heavily that one felt anxious for their safety: but there they swung securely between high heaven and the sea.  SEA-BIRDS.  The sea-birds held their holiday in the stormy gale. The lordly and graceful Albatross, whose motion is a very melody, swept screaming by upon the blast. The smaller Cape pigeons followed us fast, passing and repassing across the vessel's track. At last one of them spies a fragment on the waters, which has been thrown overboard: a moment it hovers above, then plunges down. But the other birds have seen it too; and all, pouncing on the spot, move their wings confusedly and seem to run along the waters with a rapid and eager motion. Now is there discord wild amongst them. A screaming and diving, swimming and running, mingled with a chattering noise. No sooner does one gain the morsel than another tears it from him. Who will be the victor here? The Albatross; for he sweeps triumphantly over all, swoops down, and with a scream scares off the timid little multitude; whilst high above his head he holds his arching wings; and now in pride and beauty he sits upon the waters and, drifting fast astern, gradually fades in the twilight.  What wonder that a sailor is superstitious! Separated in early youth from his home ere he has forgotten the ghost stories of childhood, and whilst the young and simple heart still loves to dwell upon the marvellous, he is placed in such scenes as these: in the dark night, amidst the din of waves and storms, he hears wild shrieks upon the air, and by him float huge forms, dim and mysterious, from which fancy is prone to build strange phantoms; and oft from aged sailors he gathers legends and wondrous tales suited to his calling; whilst the narrator's mysterious tone and earnest voice and manner attest how firmly he himself believes the story.  ARRIVAL AT THE CAPE. HIRE THE LYNHER.  September 21.  We came in sight of land yesterday evening, and spent the greater part of the day in beating up False Bay to Simonstown, where we arrived about half-past six P.M. I instantly landed in a shore-boat with Lieutenant Lushington and Mr. Walker; and, having first hurried to Admiral Sir P. Campbell with some letters I had to him, we forthwith started to ride to Cape Town. Finding that a vessel for our expedition could be procured here more readily and economically than at Swan River I determined on making this my point of departure, and after diligent enquiry I finally hired the Lynher, a schooner of about 140 tons, Henry Browse master, and subsequently found every reason to be satisfied, both with the little vessel and her commander.  EQUIPMENT AND PLANS. SAIL FOR HANOVER BAY.  My time was now wholly occupied in completing the preparations for our future proceedings. I increased my party by a few additional hands of good character, and thought myself fortunate in engaging amongst them Thomas Ruston, a seaman who had already served on the Australian coast under Captain King. On the 12th October I with great difficulty got my affairs at Cape Town so arranged as to be able to embark in the evening, and on the morning of the 13th we hove anchor and made sail.  The party now embarked consisted of:  Lieutenant Grey. Lieutenant Lushington. Mr. Walker, our Surgeon. Mr. Powell, Surgeon. Corporal R. Auger, Corporal John Coles, and Private Mustard of the Corps of Sappers and Miners. J.C. Cox, a Stock-Keeper. Thomas Ruston, a Sailor who had been on the coast of Australia in the Mermaid with Captain King. Evan Edwards, a Sailor. Henry Williams and R. Inglesby, Shoemakers.  There were besides on board a captain, a mate, seven men, and a boy.  The livestock I took from the Cape consisted altogether of thirty-one sheep, nineteen goats, and six dogs. The dogs were as follows: one greyhound; one dog bred between a greyhound and a foxhound; one between a greyhound and a sheepdog; a bull-terrier; a Cape wolf-dog; and a useful nondescript mongrel.  RE-EMBARKATION FOR HANOVER BAY.  The plan that I had finally resolved on adopting was:  To proceed in the first instance to Hanover Bay, there to select a good spot on which to form a temporary encampment; and, having landed the stock, to despatch Lieutenant Lushington with Cox and Williams in the vessel to Timor for ponies.  PLANS ON LANDING.  I selected Cox and Williams for this service because the former was used to the management of horses on board vessels, and the latter understanding Dutch was well calculated to act as interpreter at Timor. During their absence I intended to practise the party in making short explorations in different directions.  Upon the return of the vessel I intended to move the whole party to some convenient spot to be chosen during their absence, then to advance, attended only by Coles, and to fix upon the next spot on our route which I designed to halt at. This plan I intended to adhere to as much as possible throughout the whole expedition, namely, never to move the party from one place of halt until I had chosen the next one. We bore with us tools and instruments of every description; so that we not only were fully capable of maintaining ourselves but could literally, if occasion had required it, have founded the nucleus of a colony.  Great then was my joy when all my preparations were completed and I felt the vessel gliding swiftly from Table Bay into that vast ocean at the other extremity of which lay the land I so longed to see, and to which I was now bound with the ardent hope of opening the way for the conversion of a barren wilderness into a fertile garden.  Part of my plan was not only to introduce all useful animals that I possibly could into this part of Australia, but also the most valuable plants of every description. For this purpose, a collection had been made at Tenerife by Mr. Walker, under my direction, and another in South America,* including the seeds of the cotton plant. From the Cape and from England I had also procured other useful plants, and had planned that the vessel, on quitting Timor with the horses, should be filled in every vacant space with young cocoa-nut trees and other fruits, together with useful animals such as goats and sheep, in addition to the stock we conveyed from the Cape.  (*Footnote. We had been able to introduce several useful plants into the Cape; amongst others the South American Yam, which, owing to the quality of the potatoes and their great fluctuations in price, will eventually be very serviceable to the colonists, more especially for the use of whalers.)   CHAPTER 3. FROM THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE TO HANOVER BAY.  NATURAL HISTORY.  FORSTER'S PACHYPTILA (Pachyptila vittata.)  October 16.  I shot a female petrel; it had a nail planted in the heel, but no thumb; the bill was hooked at the end, the extremity of which seemed to consist of a distinct piece, articulated with the remainder; the nostrils were united, and formed a tube laid on the back of the upper mandible, hence it belonged to the family of Petrels (Procellariae.)  Its temperature was 94 degrees. Length from tip to tip of wing, 2 feet 3 inches. Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 1 foot 2.4 inches. Length from root to tip of tail, 4"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16027"],["title","Journals of Two Expeditions of Discovery in North-West and Western Australia, (#6)"],["body","es. Length of beak, 1.45 inches. Length of foot, 1.55 inches. Breadth across body, 2.3 inches.  Colour of beak and legs black; body white underneath; general colour above, a light bluish slate, which grows darker in the head and wing covers; tail tipped with black; the four first wing feathers tinged with black.  CAPE PIGEONS.  I also shot this afternoon three Cape pigeons (Procellaria capensis) white underneath, spotted black and white above.  FIRST SPECIMEN--Female.  Temperature, 98 1/2 degrees. Length from tip to tip of wing, 2 feet 11.3 inches. Length from tip of tail to tip of beak, 1 foot 6 inches. Length from tip of beak, 1.5 inches. Length from root to tip of tail,4.1 inches. Length of foot, 2.3 inches. Breadth across body, 3.2 inches.  SECOND SPECIMEN.  Length from tip to tip of wing, 2 feet 5 inches. Length from tip of tail to tip of beak, 1 foot 5 inches. Length from tip of beak, 1.5 inches. Length from root to tip of tail, 4 inches. Length of foot, 2.3 inches. Breadth across body, 3 inches.  THIRD SPECIMEN--Female.  Length from tip to tip of wing, 2 feet 5.5 inches. Length from tip of tail to tip of beak, 1 foot 4.6 inches. Length from tip of beak, 1.3 inches. Length from root to tip of tail, 4.6 inches. Length of foot, 2.2 inches. Breadth across body, 3.4 inches.  Two species of insects were found in these Cape pigeons.  The only difference I have been able to observe between the male and female of these birds is, that the male has the black spots of rather a deeper hue.  October 21. Latitude 38 degrees 15 south; longitude 35 degrees 53 minutes east.  From a variety of observations I am able to bear testimony to the correctness of a fact that has been before noticed, namely, that the Medusae invariably live in families. This single circumstance is remarkable in connection with other points of natural history since it will tend to explain the reason of certain classes of Petrels (Procellariae) only visiting particular parts of the ocean.  Sunday October 22. Latitude 37 degrees 44 minutes south; longitude 38 degrees 00 east.  Caught two small animals, one closely resembling a small shrimp (Penaeus) but having the head covered with a most beautiful purple shield. I kept this alive in a jug. The other in size and appearance exactly like a purple grape (Hyalea) with a greenish tinge at one extremity surrounding an aperture, and a distinct aperture at the other extremity. It was 0.4 inches in diameter, and had the power of emitting a phosphorescent light. I have since this period found several varieties of this animal; which, when it expands itself, closely resembles an insect, and has little wings. Further on will be found a sketch of these animals in their expanded state. (See illustration Hyalea figure 1.)  THE ALBATROSS (Diomedea exulans).  We caught four of these birds yesterday, from which I made the following measurements:  FIRST SPECIMEN. Weight, 19 1/2 pounds.  Length from tip of wing to tip of wing, 10 feet 2 inches. Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 4 feet 0.5 inches. Length of beak, 6.8 inches. Length from root to tip of tail, 10.0 inches. Length of foot, 7.6 inches. Length of wing, 4 feet 8 inches. Height from ground, 2 feet 10 inches. Temperature 98 degrees, the thermometer placed under the tongue during life. These measurements were all made during the lifetime of the bird.  SECOND SPECIMEN. Weight, 15 1/2 pounds.  Length from tip of wing to tip of wing, 10 feet. Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 3 feet 11 inches. Length of beak, 6.6 inches. Height from ground to top of head, 2 feet 4 inches. Temperature 98 degrees.  THIRD SPECIMEN. The largest bird of the kind I have hitherto seen.  Length from tip of wing to tip of wing, 10 feet 8 inches. Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 4 feet 6 inches. Breadth across the body, 8 inches. Length of bill, 6.7 inches. Length of foot, 7.5 inches.  FOURTH SPECIMEN. The same size as the second.  Length of beak, 6.3 inches. Length of foot, 6.9 inches.  The beak of each of these birds during lifetime was of a beautiful light rose colour; their voice was something like that of a goose, but rather louder, deeper, and hoarser. If during life the beak was pressed with the finger it became quite white, and it was not until the pressure had for some time been removed that the colour returned. The specimens I have described above (all males) were quite white underneath; the white above being speckled with black spots and streaks, sometimes changing to a brownish hue; the wings were black. We obtained also a female bird with the following measurements, which has been described as a distinct species:  Length from tip to tip of wing, 7 feet 2 inches. Length from tip of tail to tip of beak, 3 feet 5.5 inches. Length from root to tip of tail, 9 inches. Length of beak, 4.5 inches. Length of foot, 5 inches.  Legs pale flesh colour; beak, black, with a brown-coloured streak on each side of the lower mandible; the whole body of a dirty black colour, acquiring a lighter tinge underneath.  October 30.  I shot two male specimens of this last bird: the only distinction between them and the female was that they were rather smaller, and had a white streak instead of a light brown one on each side of the lower mandible.  FIRST SPECIMEN--Male. Weight, 5 1/2 pounds.  Length from tip of wing to tip of wing 6 feet 6 inches. Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 2 feet 6 inches. Length from root to tip of tail, 11 inches. Length from root to tip of beak, 4 inches. Length from root to tip of foot, 5 inches. Length from root to tip of wing, 2 feet 10 inches.  SECOND SPECIMEN--Male. Weight 7 pounds.  Length from tip to tip of wing, 6 feet 9 inches. Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 2 feet 10 inches. Length of tail, 10.6 inches. Length of beak, 4.7 inches. Length of foot, 5 inches. Length of wing, 3 feet.  All the three specimens of this species had a distinct although minute claw, representing a thumb, upon one leg, thus apparently forming a link between the genus Procellaria and the genus Diomedea.  PACHYPTILA VITTATA.  Ash-grey above; white in the under parts; quills, tail-feathers at the tip, and band on the wings when expanded, brownish-black.  Length from tip to tip of wing, 2 feet. Length from tip of beak to tip of tail, 10 inches. Length from root to tip of tail, 4.3 inches. Length of beak, 1 inch. Length of foot, 1.5 inches. Length of wing, 10.5 inches.  This bird is of the same species as the one I procured on the 16th of October. I shot it about nine A.M. They are very numerous in these latitudes; their flight resembles much that of a snipe. The name by which they are known to the sailors is the whale-bird; they appear to take their food upon the wing, for I have never yet seen them sit upon the waters even for a single second, although I have observed them frequently, and at all hours; but night and day they hurry on with the same restless, rapid flight, sometimes going in large flocks; and I have never upon shore seen so many birds assembled upon a few square miles as I have sometimes here observed in the open ocean. I never heard them utter any cry or sound.  I saw but few Cape pigeons (Procellaria capensis) after passing the 40th degree of longitude, and neither Cape pigeons nor albatrosses after passing the 95th degree of longitude, and 32nd parallel of latitude. I have never seen a petrel or bird of the family Longipennes discharge its oily fluid at anyone who worried or attacked it; but have almost invariably seen it involuntarily eject it,when hurt or frightened.  THE ALBATROSS.  November 9.  I caught four albatrosses with a fishing-line; one of them was a female, the first I had seen. I observed no marked difference between her and males of the same species, for I have found them vary much in the dark shades upon their feathers.  I have yet found no bird of this family whose foot was not longer than its beak.  DIOMEDEA EXULANS--Female.  Length from tip of wing to tip of wing,10 feet 10 inches. Length from tip of wing, 4 feet 10 inches. From tip of beak to tip of tail, 4 feet 9 inches. Length of beak, 7.2 inches. Length of tail, 9 inches. Length of foot, 7.5 inches.  The black and brown marks on this bird were darker than the corresponding ones on the males.  I am inclined to think that the chief characteristic that distinguishes the females from the males in the family Longipennes is their greater size: my opinion is grounded upon the following tables, drawn up from careful measurements, made by myself.  (@@@TABLE OF FAMILY LONGIPENNES)  In each of these three instances the female is larger than the males; they are the only ones I am able to adduce which bear upon this point.  November 11. South latitude 30 degrees 47 minutes; east longitude 100 degrees 21 minutes 15 seconds.  Being a calm, I gave the men leave to bathe this afternoon, and was one of the first overboard myself. Within an hour and a half after we had done bathing, a cry of a shark was raised, and in truth there was the monster (the first we had seen). I mention this fact as tending to support what I have often heard stated, namely, that a shark's sense of smell is so keen that, if men ever bathe in seas where they are found, a shark is almost sure to appear directly afterwards. This really occurred in the present instance.  We repeatedly caught many little animals which I believe are the VELELLA of Lamarck. They consist of a flat oval cartilage, on which they float; there is a mouth in the inferior surface of this surrounded with many tentacula; on its superior surface is a crest which remains above water, and the wind blowing against it turns the animal round; they thus swim with a rotatory motion; the crest is placed obliquely to the length of the oval cartilage, and this position of it perhaps assists in producing the motion; the crest is perfectly transparent, but marked with little striae; the oval cartilage is marked with concentric striae, which indicate the lines of its "]]]
