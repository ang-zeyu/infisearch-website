Those are my documents of nobility, my patents of rank, preserved in your archives with your own!\"  She spoke playfully, smiling to herself as she stroked his hair. But he caught her hand tenderly and brought it to his lips, holding it there.  \"You are more free than I,\" he said. \"Which of us two is the slave? You who hold me, or I who am held? This little hand will never let me go.\"  \"I think you would come back to me,\" she answered. \"But if I ran away, would you follow me?\"  \"You will not run away.\" He spoke quietly and confidently, still holding her hand, as if he were talking to it, while he felt the breath of her winds upon his forehead.  \"No,\" she said, and there was a little silence.  \"I have but one fear,\" he began, at last. \"If I were ruined, what would become of you?\"  \"Have you lost at play again to-night?\" she asked, and in her tone there was a note of anxiety.  Contarini laughed low, and felt for the wallet at his aide. He held it up to show how heavy it was with the gold, and made her take it. She only kept it a moment, but while it was in her hand her eyelids were half closed as if she were guessing at the weight, for he could not see her face.  \"I won all that,\" he said. \"To-morrow you shall have the pearls.\"  \"How good you are to me! But should you not keep the money? You may need it. Why do you talk of ruin?\"  She knew that he would give her all he had, she almost guessed that he would commit a crime rather than lack gold to give her.  \"You do not know my father!\" he answered. \"When he is displeased he threatens to let me starve. He will cut me off some day, and I shall have to turn soldier for a living. Would that not be ruin? You know his last scheme--he wishes me to marry the daughter of a rich glass-maker.\"  \"I know.\" Arisa laughed contemptuously, \"Great joy may your bride have of you! Is she really rich?\"  \"Yes. But you know that I will not marry her.\"  \"Why not?\" asked Arisa quite simply.  Contarini started and looked up at her face in the dim light. She was bending down to him with a very loving look.  \"Why should you not marry?\" she asked again. \"Why do you start and look at me so strangely? Do you think I should care? Or that I am afraid of another woman for you?\"  \"Yes. I should have thought that you would be jealous.\" He still gazed at her in astonishment.  \"Jealous!\" she cried, and as she laughed she shook her beautiful head, and the gold of her hair glittered in the flickering candle-light. \"Jealous? I? Look at me! Is she younger than I? I was eighteen years old the other day. If she is younger than I, she is a child--shall I be jealous of children? Is she taller, straighter, handsomer than I am? Show her to me, and I will laugh in her face! Can she sing to you, as I sing, in the summer nights, the songs you like and those I learned by the Kura in the shadow of Kasbek? Is her hair brighter than mine, is her hand softer, is her step lighter? Jealous? Not I! Will your rich wife be your slave? Will she wake for you, sing for you, dance for you, rise up and lie down at your bidding, work for you, live for you, die for you, as I will? Will she love you as I can love, caress you to sleep, or wake you with kisses at your dear will?\"  \"No--ah no! There is no woman in the world but you.\"  \"Then I am not jealous of the rest, least of all, of your young bride. I will wager with myself against all her gold for your life, and I shall win--I have won already! Am I not trying to persuade you that you should marry?\"  \"I have not even seen her. Her father sent me a message to-night, bidding me go to church on Sunday and stand beside a certain pillar.\"  \"To see and be seen,\" laughed Arisa. \"It is not a fair exchange! She will look at the handsomest man in the world--hush! That is the truth. And you will see a little, pale, red-haired girl with silly blue eyes, staring at you, her wide mouth open and her clumsy hands hanging down. She will look like the wooden dolls they dress in the latest Venetian fashion to send to Paris every year, that the French courtiers may know what to wear! And her father will hurry her along, for fear that you should look too long at her and refuse to marry such a thing, even for Marco Polo's millions!\"  Contarini laughed carelessly at the description.  \"Give me some wine,\" he said. \"We will drink her health.\"  Arisa rose with the grace of a young goddess, her hair tumbling over her bare shoulders in a splendid golden confusion. Contarini watched her with possessive eyes, as she went and came back, bringing him the drink. She brought him yellow wine of Chios in a glass calix of Murano, blown air-thin upon a slender stem and just touched here and there with drops of tender blue.  \"A health to the bride of Jacopo Contarini!\" she said, with a ringing little laugh.  Then she set the wine to her lips, so that they were wet with it, and gave him the glass; and as she stooped to give it, her hair fell forward and almost hid her from him.  \"A health to the shower of gold!\" he said, and he drank.  She sat down beside him, crossing her feet like an Eastern woman, and he set the empty glass carelessly upon the marble floor, as though it had been a thing of no price.  \"That glass was made at her father's furnace,\" he said.  \"A pity he could not have made his daughter of glass too,\" answered Arisa.  \"Graceful and silent?\"  \"And easily destroyed! But if I say that, you will think me jealous, and I am not. She will bring you wealth. I wish her a long life, long enough to understand that she has been sold to you for your good name, like a slave, as I was sold, but that you gave gold for me because you wanted me for myself, whereas you want nothing of her but her gold.\"  \"But for that--\" Contarini seemed to be hesitating. \"I never meant to marry her,\" he added.  \"And but for that, you would not! But for that! But for the only thing which I have not to give you! I wish the world were mine, with all the rich secret things in it, the myriads of millions of diamonds in the earth, the thousand rivers of gold that lie deep in the mountain rocks, and all mankind, and all that mankind has, from end to end of it! Then you should have it all for your own, and you would not need to marry the little red-haired girl with the fish's mouth!\"  Contarini laughed again.  \"Have you seen her, that you can describe her so well? She may have black hair. Who knows?\"  \"Yes. Perhaps it is black, thin and coarse like the hair on a mule's tail; and she has black eyes, like ripe olives set in the white of a hard-boiled egg; and she has a dark skin like Spanish leather which shines when she is hot and is grey when she is cold; and a black down on her upper lip; and teeth like a young horse. I hate those dark women!\"  \"But you have never seen her! She may be very pretty.\"  \"Pretty, then! She shall be as you choose. She shall have a round face, round eyes, a round nose and a round mouth! Her face shall be pink and white, her eyes shall be of blue glass and her hair shall be as smooth and yellow as fresh butter. She shall have little fat white hands like a healthy baby, a double chin and a short waist. Then she will be what people call pretty.\"  \"Yes,\" assented Jacopo. \"That is very amusing. But just suppose, for the sake of discussion--it is impossible, of course, but suppose it--that instead of there being only one perfectly beautiful woman in the world, whose name is Arisa, there should be two, and that the name of the other chanced to be Marietta Beroviero.\"  Arisa raised her eyes and gazed steadily at Jacopo.  \"You have seen her,\" she said in a tone of conviction. \"She is beautiful.\"  \"No. I give you my word that I have not seen her. I only wanted to know what you would do then.\"  \"I do not believe that any woman is as beautiful as I am,\" answered the Georgian, with the quiet simplicity of a savage.  \"But if there were one, and you saw her?\" insisted the man, to see what she would say.  \"We could not both live. One of us would kill the other.\"  \"I believe you would,\" said Jacopo, watching her face.  She had forgotten his presence while she spoke; a fierce hardness had come into her eyes, and her upper lip was a little raised, in a cruel expression, just showing her teeth. He was surprised.  \"I never saw you like that,\" he said.  \"You should not make me think of killing,\" she answered, suddenly leaving her seat and kneeling beside him on the divan. \"It is not good to think too much of killing--it makes one wish to do it.\"  \"Then try and kill me with kisses,\" he said, looking into her eyes, that were growing tender again.  \"You would not know you were dying,\" she whispered, her lips quite close to his.  As she kissed him, she loosened the collar from his white throat, and smoothed his thick hair back from his forehead upon the pillow, and she saw how pale he was, under her touch.  But by and by he fell asleep, and then she very softly drew her arm from beneath his tired head, and slipped from his side, and stood up, with a little sigh of relief. The candle had burned to the socket; she blew it out.  It was still an hour before dawn when she left the room, lifting the heavy curtain that hung before the door of her inner chamber. There, a faint light was burning before a shrine in a silver cup filled with oil. As she fastened the door noiselessly behind her, a man caught her in his arms, lifting her off her feet like a child.  Shaggy black hair grew low upon his bossy forehead, his dark eyes were fierce and bloodshot, a rough beard only half concealed the huge jaw and iron lips. He was half clad, in shirt and hose, and the muscles of his neck and arms stood out like brown ropes as he pressed the beautiful creature to his broad chest.  \"I thought he would never sleep to-night,\" she whispered.  Her eyelids drooped, and her cheeks grew deadly white, and the strong man felt the furious beating of her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16100"],["title","Marietta: A Maid of Venice (#7)"],["body","against his own breast. He was Aristarchi, the Greek captain who had sold her for a slave, and she loved him.  In the wild days of sea-fighting among the Greek islands he had taken a small trading galley that had been driven out of her course. He left not a man of her crew alive to tell whether she had been Turkish or Christian, and he took all that was worth taking of her poor cargo. The only prize of any price was the captive Georgian girl who was being brought westward to be sold, like thousands of others in those days, with little concealment and no mystery, in one of the slave markets of northern Italy. Aristarchi claimed her for himself, as his share of the booty, but his men knew her value. Standing shoulder to shoulder between him and her, they drew their knives and threatened to cut her to pieces, if he would not promise to sell her as she was, when they should come to land, and share the price with them. They judged that she must be worth a thousand or fifteen hundred pieces of gold, for she was more beautiful than any woman they had ever seen, and they had already heard her singing most sweetly to herself, as if she were quite sure that she was in no danger, because she knew her own value. So Aristarchi was forced to consent, cursing them; and night and day they guarded her door against him, till they had brought her safe to Venice, and delivered her to the slave-dealers.  Then Aristarchi sold all that he had, except his ship, and it all brought far too little to buy such a slave. She would have gone with him, for she had seen that he was stronger than other men and feared neither God nor man, but she was well guarded, and he was only allowed to talk with her through a grated window, like those at convent gates.  She was not long in the dealers' house, for word was brought to all the young patricians of Venice, and many of them bid against each other for her, in the dealers' inner room, till Contarini outbid them all, saying that he could not live without her, though the price should ruin him, and because he had not enough gold he gave the dealers, besides money, a marvellous sword with a jewelled hilt, which one of his forefathers had taken at the siege of Constantinople, and which some said had belonged to the Emperor Justinian himself, nine hundred years ago.  Then Aristarchi and his men paid the dealers their commission and took the money and the sword. But before he went from the house, the Greek captain begged leave to see Arisa once more at the grating, and he told her that come what might he should steal her away. She bade him not to be in too great haste, and she promised that if he would wait, he should have with her more gold than her new master had given for her, for she would take all he had from him, little by little; and when they had enough they would leave Venice secretly, and live in a grand manner in Florence, or in Rome, or in Sicily. For she never doubted but that he would find some way of coming to her, though she were guarded more closely than in the slave-dealers' house, where the windows were grated and armed men slept before the door, and one of the dealers watched all night.  More than a year had passed since then; the strong Greek knew every corner of the house of the Agnus Dei, and every foothold under Arisa's windows, from the water to the stone sill, by which he could help himself a little as he went up hand over hand by the knotted silk rope that would have cut to the bone any hands but his. She kept it hidden in a cushioned footstool in her inner room. Many a risk he had run, and more than once in winter he had slipped down the rope with haste to let himself gently into the icy water, and he had swum far down the dark canal to a landing-place. For he was a man of iron.  So it came about that Jacopo Contarini lived in a fool's paradise, in which he was not only the chief fool himself, but was moreover in bodily danger more often than he knew. For though Aristarchi had hitherto managed to escape being seen, he would have killed Jacopo with his naked hands if the latter had ever caught him, as easily as a boy wrings a bird's neck, and with as little scruple of conscience.  The Georgian loved him for his hirsute strength, for his fearlessness, even his violence and dangerous temper. He dominated her as naturally as she controlled her master, whose vacillating nature and love of idle ease filled her with contempt. It was for the sake of gold that she acted her part daily and nightly, with a wisdom and unwavering skill that were almost superhuman; and the Greek ruffian agreed to the bargain, and had been in no haste to carry her off, as he might have done at any time. She hoarded the money she got from Jacopo, to give it by stealth to Aristarchi, who hid their growing wealth in a safe place where it was always ready; but she kept her jewels always together, in case of an unexpected flight, since she dared not sell them nor give them to the Greek, lest they should be missed.  Of late it had seemed to them both that the time for their final action was at hand, for it had been clear to Arisa that Jacopo was near the end of his resources, and that his father was resolved to force him to change his life. There were days when he was reduced to borrowing money for his actual needs, and though an occasional stroke of good fortune at play temporarily relieved him, Arisa was sure that he was constantly sinking deeper into debt. But within the week, the aspect of his affairs had changed. The marriage with Marietta had been proposed, and Arisa had made a discovery. She told Aristarchi everything, as naturally as she would have concealed everything from Contarini.  \"We shall be rich,\" she said, twining her white arms round his swarthy neck and looking up into his murderous eyes with something like genuine adoration. \"We shall get the wife's dowry for ourselves, by degrees, every farthing of it, and it shall be the dower of Aristarchi's bride instead. I shall not be portionless. You shall not be ashamed of me when you meet your old friends.\"  \"Ashamed!\" His arm pressed her to him till she longed to cry out for pain, yet she would not have had him less rough.  \"You are so strong!\" she gasped in a broken whisper. \"Yes--a little looser--so! I can speak now. You must go to Murano to-morrow and find out all about this Angelo Beroviero and his daughter. Try to see her, and tell me whether she is pretty, but most of all learn whether she is really rich.\"  \"That is easy enough. I will go to the furnace and offer to buy a cargo of glass for Sicily.\"  \"But you will not take it?\" asked Arisa in sudden anxiety lest he should leave her to make the voyage.  \"No, no! I will make inquiries. I will ask for a sort of glass that does not exist.\"  \"Yes,\" she said, reassured. \"Do that. I must know if the girl is rich before I marry him to her.\"  \"But can you make him marry her at all?\" asked Aristarchi.  \"I can make him do anything I please. We drank to the health of the bride to-night, in a goblet made by her father! The wine was strong, and I put a little syrup of poppies into it. He will not wake for hours. What is the matter?\"  She felt the rough man shaking beside her, as if he were in an ague.  \"I was laughing,\" he said, when he could speak. \"It is a good jest. But is there no danger in all this? Is it quite impossible that he should take a liking for his wife?\"  \"And leave me?\" Arisa's whisper was hot with indignation at the mere thought. \"Then I suppose you would leave me for the first pretty girl with a fortune who wanted to marry you!\"  \"This Contarini is such a fool!\" answered Aristarchi contemptuously, by way of explanation and apology.  Arisa was instantly pacified.  \"If he should be foolish enough for that, I have means that will keep him,\" she answered.  \"I do not see how you can force him to do anything except by his passion for you.\"  \"I can. I was not going to tell you yet--you always make me tell you everything, like a child.\"  \"What is it?\" asked the Greek. \"Have you found out anything new about him? Of course you must tell me.\"  \"We hold his life in our hands,\" she said quietly, and Aristarchi knew that she was not exaggerating the truth.  She began to tell him how this was the third time that a number of masked men had come to the house an hour after dark, and had stayed till midnight or later, and how Contarini had told her that they came to play at dice where they were safe from interruption, and that on these nights the servants were sent to their quarters at sunset on pain of dismissal if Jacopo found them about the house, but that they also received generous presents of money to keep them silent.  \"The man is a fool!\" said Aristarchi again. \"He puts himself in their power.\"  \"He is much more completely in ours,\" answered Arisa. \"The servants believe that his friends come to play dice. And so they do. But they come for something more serious.\"  Aristarchi moved his massive head suddenly to an attitude of profound attention.  \"They are plotting against the Republic,\" whispered Arisa. \"I can hear all they say.\"  \"Are you sure?\"  \"I tell you I can hear every word. I can almost see them. Look here. Come with me.\"  She rose and he followed her to the corner of the room where the small silver lamp burned steadily before an image of Saint Mark, and above a heavy kneeling-stool.  \"The foot moves,\" she said, and she was already on her knees on the floor, pushing the step.  It slid back with the soft sound Contarini had heard before he came upstairs. The upper part of the woodwork was built into the wall.  \"They meet in the place below this,\" Arisa said. \"When they are there, I can see a glimmer of light. I cannot get my head in. It is too narrow, but I hear as if I were with them.\"  \"How did you find this out?\" asked Aristarchi on the floor beside her, and reaching down into the dark space to explore it with his hand. \"It is deep,\" he continued, without waiting for an answer. \"There"]]]
