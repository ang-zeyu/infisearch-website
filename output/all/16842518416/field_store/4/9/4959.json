The frigate was then in 31° 15′ north latitude and 136° 42′ east longitude. The coast of Japan still remained less than two hundred miles to leeward. Night was approaching. They had just struck eight bells; large clouds veiled the face of the moon, then in its first quarter. The sea undulated peaceably under the stern of the vessel.  At that moment I was leaning forward on the starboard netting. Conseil, standing near me, was looking straight before him. The crew, perched in the ratlines, examined the horizon, which contracted and darkened by degrees. Officers with their night glasses scoured the growing darkness; sometimes the ocean sparkled under the rays of the moon, which darted between two clouds, then all trace of light was lost in the darkness.  In looking at Conseil, I could see he was undergoing a little of the general influence. At least I thought so. Perhaps for the first time his nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity.  “Come, Conseil,” said I, “this is the last chance of pocketing the two thousand dollars.”  “May I be permitted to say, sir,” replied Conseil, “that I never reckoned on getting the prize; and, had the government of the Union offered a hundred thousand dollars, it would have been none the poorer.”  “You are right, Conseil. It is a foolish affair after all, and one upon which we entered too lightly. What time lost, what useless emotions! We should have been back in France six months ago.”  “In your little room, sir,” replied Conseil, “and in your museum, sir, and I should have already classed all your fossils, sir. And the Babiroussa would have been installed in its cage in the Jardin des Plantes, and have drawn all the curious people of the capital!”  “As you say, Conseil. I fancy we shall run a fair chance of being laughed at for our pains.”  “That’s tolerably certain,” replied Conseil, quietly; “I think they will make fun of you, sir. And, must I say it?”  “Go on, my good friend.”  “Well, sir, you will only get your deserts.”  “Indeed!”  “When one has the honour of being a savant as you are, sir, one should not expose one’s self to——”  Conseil had not time to finish his compliment. In the midst of general silence a voice had just been heard. It was the voice of Ned Land shouting—  “Look out there! The very thing we are looking for—on our weather beam!”     CHAPTER VI AT FULL STEAM   At this cry the whole ship’s crew hurried towards the harpooner,—commander, officers, masters, sailors, cabin boys; even the engineers left their engines, and the stokers their furnaces.  The order to stop her had been given, and the frigate now simply went on by her own momentum. The darkness was then profound, and however good the Canadian’s eyes were, I asked myself how he had managed to see, and what he had been able to see. My heart beat as if it would break. But Ned Land was not mistaken, and we all perceived the object he pointed to. At two cables’ length from the _Abraham Lincoln_, on the starboard quarter, the sea seemed to be illuminated all over. It was not a mere phosphoric phenomenon. The monster emerged some fathoms from the water, and then threw out that very intense but inexplicable light mentioned in the report of several captains. This magnificent irradiation must have been produced by an agent of great _shining_ power. The luminous part traced on the sea an immense oval, much elongated, the centre of which condensed a burning heat, whose overpowering brilliancy died out by successive gradations.  “It is only an agglomeration of phosphoric particles,” cried one of the officers.  “No, sir, certainly not,” I replied. “Never did pholades or salpæ produce such a powerful light. That brightness is of an essentially electrical nature. Besides, see, see! it moves; it is moving forwards, backwards; it is darting towards us!”  A general cry rose from the frigate.  “Silence!” said the Captain; “up with the helm, reverse the engines.”  The steam was shut off, and the _Abraham Lincoln_, beating to port, described a semicircle.  “Right the helm, go ahead,” cried the Captain.  These orders were executed, and the frigate moved rapidly from the burning light.  I was mistaken. She tried to sheer off, but the supernatural animal approached with a velocity double her own.  We gasped for breath. Stupefaction more than fear made us dumb and motionless. The animal gained on us, sporting with the waves. It made the round of the frigate, which was then making fourteen knots, and enveloped it with its electric rings like luminous dust. Then it moved away two or three miles, leaving a phosphorescent track, like those volumes of steam that the express trains leave behind. All at once from the dark line of the horizon whither it retired to gain its momentum, the monster rushed suddenly towards the _Abraham Lincoln_ with alarming rapidity, stopped suddenly about twenty feet from the hull, and died out,—not diving under the water, for its brilliancy did not abate,—but suddenly, and as if the source of this brilliant emanation was exhausted. Then it reappeared on the other side of the vessel, as if it had turned and slid under the hull. Any moment a collision might have occurred which would have been fatal to us. However, I was astonished at the manœuvres of the frigate. She fled and did not attack.  On the captain’s face, generally so impassive, was an expression of unaccountable astonishment.  “Mr. Aronnax,” he said, “I do not know with what formidable being I have to deal, and I will not imprudently risk my frigate in the midst of this darkness. Besides, how attack this unknown thing, how defend one’s self from it? Wait for daylight, and the scene will change.”  “You have no further doubt, captain, of the nature of the animal?”  “No, sir; it is evidently a gigantic narwhal, and an electric one.”  “Perhaps,” added I, “one can only approach it with a gymnotus or a torpedo.”  “Undoubtedly,” replied the captain, “if it possesses such dreadful power, it is the most terrible animal that ever was created. That is why, sir, I must be on my guard.”  The crew were on their feet all night. No one thought of sleep. The _Abraham Lincoln_, not being able to struggle with such velocity, had moderated its pace, and sailed at half speed. For its part, the narwhal, imitating the frigate, let the waves rock it at will, and seemed decided not to leave the scene of the struggle. Towards midnight, however, it disappeared, or, to use a more appropriate term, it “died out” like a large glow-worm. Had it fled? One could only fear, not hope. But at seven minutes to one o’clock in the morning a deafening whistling was heard, like that produced by a body of water rushing with great violence.  The captain, Ned Land, and I, were then on the poop, eagerly peering through the profound darkness.  “Ned Land,” asked the commander, “you have often heard the roaring of whales?”  “Often, sir; but never such whales the sight of which brought me in two thousand dollars. If I can only approach within four harpoon lengths of it!”  “But to approach it,” said the commander, “I ought to put a whaler at your disposal?”  “Certainly, sir.”  “That will be trifling with the lives of my men.”  “And mine too,” simply said the harpooner.  Towards two o’clock in the morning, the burning light reappeared, not less intense, about five miles to windward of the _Abraham Lincoln_. Notwithstanding the distance, and the noise of the wind and sea, one heard distinctly the loud strokes of the animal’s tail, and even its panting breath. It seemed that, at the moment that the enormous narwhal had come to take breath at the surface of the water, the air was engulfed in its lungs, like the steam in the vast cylinders of a machine of two thousand horse-power.  “Hum!” thought I, “a whale with the strength of a cavalry regiment would be a pretty whale!”  We were on the _qui vive_ till daylight, and prepared for the combat. The fishing implements were laid along the hammock nettings. The second lieutenant loaded the blunderbusses, which could throw harpoons to the distance of a mile, and long duck-guns, with explosive bullets, which inflicted mortal wounds even to the most terrible animals. Ned Land contented himself with sharpening his harpoon—a terrible weapon in his hands.  At six o’clock day began to break; and, with the first glimmer of light, the electric light of the narwhal disappeared. At seven o’clock the day was sufficiently advanced, but a very thick sea fog obscured our view, and the best spy-glasses could not pierce it. That caused disappointment and anger.  I climbed the mizzen-mast. Some officers were already perched on the mast heads. At eight o’clock the fog lay heavily on the waves, and its thick scrolls rose little by little. The horizon grew wider and clearer at the same time. Suddenly, just as on the day before, Ned Land’s voice was heard:  “The thing itself on the port quarter!” cried the harpooner.  Every eye was turned towards the point indicated. There, a mile and a half from the frigate, a long blackish body emerged a yard above the waves. Its tail, violently agitated, produced a considerable eddy. Never did a caudal appendage beat the sea with such violence. An immense track, of dazzling whiteness, marked the passage of the animal, and described a long curve.  The frigate approached the cetacean. I examined it thoroughly.  The reports of the _Shannon_ and of the _Helvetia_ had rather exaggerated its size, and I estimated its length at only two hundred and fifty feet. As to its dimensions, I could only conjecture them to be admirably proportioned. While I watched this phenomenon, two jets of steam and water were ejected from its vents, and rose to the height of 120 feet; thus I ascertained its way of breathing. I concluded definitely that it belonged "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/164"],["title","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea (#6)"],["body","the vertebrate branch, class mammalia.  The crew waited impatiently for their chief’s orders. The latter, after having observed the animal attentively, called the engineer. The engineer ran to him.  “Sir,” said the commander, “you have steam up?”  “Yes, sir,” answered the engineer.  “Well, make up your fires and put on all steam.”  Three hurrahs greeted this order. The time for the struggle had arrived. Some moments after, the two funnels of the frigate vomited torrents of black smoke, and the bridge quaked under the trembling of the boilers.  The _Abraham Lincoln_, propelled by her wonderful screw, went straight at the animal. The latter allowed it to come within half a cable’s length; then, as if disdaining to dive, it took a little turn, and stopped a short distance off.  This pursuit lasted nearly three-quarters of an hour, without the frigate gaining two yards on the cetacean. It was quite evident that at that rate we should never come up with it.  “Well, Mr. Land,” asked the captain, “do you advise me to put the boats out to sea?”  “No, sir,” replied Ned Land; “because we shall not take that beast easily.”  “What shall we do then?”  “Put on more steam if you can, sir. With your leave, I mean to post myself under the bowsprit, and if we get within harpooning distance, I shall throw my harpoon.”  “Go, Ned,” said the captain. “Engineer, put on more pressure.”  Ned Land went to his post. The fires were increased, the screw revolved forty-three times a minute, and the steam poured out of the valves. We heaved the log, and calculated that the _Abraham Lincoln_ was going at the rate of 18½ miles an hour.  But the accursed animal swam too at the rate of 18½ miles an hour.  For a whole hour, the frigate kept up this pace, without gaining six feet. It was humiliating for one of the swiftest sailers in the American navy. A stubborn anger seized the crew; the sailors abused the monster, who, as before, disdained to answer them; the captain no longer contented himself with twisting his beard—he gnawed it.  The engineer was again called.  “You have turned full steam in?”  “Yes, sir,” replied the engineer.  The speed of the _Abraham Lincoln_ increased. Its masts trembled down to their stepping holes, and the clouds of smoke could hardly find way out of the narrow funnels.  They heaved the log a second time.  “Well?” asked the captain of the man at the wheel.  “Nineteen miles and three-tenths, sir.”  “Clap on more steam.”  The engineer obeyed. The manometer showed ten degrees. But the cetacean grew warm itself, no doubt; for without straining itself, it made 19-3/10 miles.  What a pursuit! No, I cannot describe the emotion that vibrated through me. Ned Land kept his post, harpoon in hand. Several times the animal let us gain upon it.—“We shall catch it! we shall catch it!” cried the Canadian. But just as he was going to strike, the cetacean stole away with a rapidity that could not be estimated at less than thirty miles an hour, and even during our maximum of speed, it bullied the frigate, going round and round it. A cry of fury broke from everyone!  At noon we were no further advanced than at eight o’clock in the morning.  The captain then decided to take more direct means.  “Ah!” said he, “that animal goes quicker than the _Abraham Lincoln_. Very well! we will see whether it will escape these conical bullets. Send your men to the forecastle, sir.”  The forecastle gun was immediately loaded and slewed round. But the shot passed some feet above the cetacean, which was half a mile off.  “Another, more to the right,” cried the commander, “and five dollars to whoever will hit that infernal beast.”  An old gunner with a grey beard—that I can see now—with steady eye and grave face, went up to the gun and took a long aim. A loud report was heard, with which were mingled the cheers of the crew.   [Illustration] An old grey-bearded gunner . . . .   The bullet did its work; it hit the animal, but not fatally, and sliding off the rounded surface, was lost in two miles depth of sea.  The chase began again, and the captain, leaning towards me, said—  “I will pursue that beast till my frigate bursts up.”  “Yes,” answered I; “and you will be quite right to do it.”  I wished the beast would exhaust itself, and not be insensible to fatigue like a steam engine! But it was of no use. Hours passed, without its showing any signs of exhaustion.  However, it must be said in praise of the _Abraham Lincoln_, that she struggled on indefatigably. I cannot reckon the distance she made under three hundred miles during this unlucky day, November the 6th. But night came on, and overshadowed the rough ocean.  Now I thought our expedition was at an end, and that we should never again see the extraordinary animal. I was mistaken. At ten minutes to eleven in the evening, the electric light reappeared three miles to windward of the frigate, as pure, as intense as during the preceding night.  The narwhal seemed motionless; perhaps, tired with its day’s work, it slept, letting itself float with the undulation of the waves. Now was a chance of which the captain resolved to take advantage.  He gave his orders. The _Abraham Lincoln_ kept up half steam, and advanced cautiously so as not to awake its adversary. It is no rare thing to meet in the middle of the ocean whales so sound asleep that they can be successfully attacked, and Ned Land had harpooned more than one during its sleep. The Canadian went to take his place again under the bowsprit.  The frigate approached noiselessly, stopped at two cables’ lengths from the animal, and following its track. No one breathed; a deep silence reigned on the bridge. We were not a hundred feet from the burning focus, the light of which increased and dazzled our eyes.  At this moment, leaning on the forecastle bulwark, I saw below me Ned Land grappling the martingale in one hand, brandishing his terrible harpoon in the other, scarcely twenty feet from the motionless animal. Suddenly his arm straightened, and the harpoon was thrown; I heard the sonorous stroke of the weapon, which seemed to have struck a hard body. The electric light went out suddenly, and two enormous waterspouts broke over the bridge of the frigate, rushing like a torrent from stem to stern, overthrowing men, and breaking the lashings of the spars. A fearful shock followed, and, thrown over the rail without having time to stop myself, I fell into the sea.     CHAPTER VII AN UNKNOWN SPECIES OF WHALE   This unexpected fall so stunned me that I have no clear recollection of my sensations at the time. I was at first drawn down to a depth of about twenty feet. I am a good swimmer (though without pretending to rival Byron or Edgar Poe, who were masters of the art), and in that plunge I did not lose my presence of mind. Two vigorous strokes brought me to the surface of the water. My first care was to look for the frigate. Had the crew seen me disappear? Had the _Abraham Lincoln_ veered round? Would the captain put out a boat? Might I hope to be saved?  The darkness was intense. I caught a glimpse of a black mass disappearing in the east, its beacon lights dying out in the distance. It was the frigate! I was lost.  “Help, help!” I shouted, swimming towards the _Abraham Lincoln_ in desperation.  My clothes encumbered me; they seemed glued to my body, and paralysed my movements.  I was sinking! I was suffocating!  “Help!”  This was my last cry. My mouth filled with water; I struggled against being drawn down the abyss. Suddenly my clothes were seized by a strong hand, and I felt myself quickly drawn up to the surface of the sea; and I heard, yes, I heard these words pronounced in my ear—  “If master would be so good as to lean on my shoulder, master would swim with much greater ease.”  I seized with one hand my faithful Conseil’s arm.  “Is it you?” said I, “you?”  “Myself,” answered Conseil; “and waiting master’s orders.”  “That shock threw you as well as me into the sea?”  “No; but being in my master’s service, I followed him.”  The worthy fellow thought that was but natural.  “And the frigate?” I asked.  “The frigate?” replied Conseil, turning on his back; “I think that master had better not count too much on her.”  “You think so?”  “I say that, at the time I threw myself into the sea, I heard the men at the wheel say, ‘The screw and the rudder are broken.’”  “Broken?”  “Yes, broken by the monster’s teeth. It is the only injury the _Abraham Lincoln_ has sustained. But it is a bad look out for us—she no longer answers her helm.”  “Then we are lost!”  “Perhaps so,” calmly answered Conseil. “However, we have still several hours before us, and one can do a good deal in some hours.”  Conseil’s imperturbable coolness set me up again. I swam more vigorously; but, cramped by my clothes, which stuck to me like a leaden weight, I felt great difficulty in bearing up. Conseil saw this.  “Will master let me make a slit?” said he; and, slipping an open knife under my clothes, he ripped them up from top to bottom very rapidly. Then he cleverly slipped them off me, while I swam for both of us.  Then I did the same for Conseil, and we continued to swim near to each other.  Nevertheless, our situation was no less terrible. Perhaps our disappearance had not been noticed; and if it had been, the frigate could not tack, being without its helm. Conseil argued on this supposition, and laid his plans accordingly. This phlegmatic boy was perfectly self-possessed. We then decided that, as our only chance of safety was being picked up by the _Abraham Lincoln’s_ boats, we ought to manage so as to wait for them as long as possible. I resolved then to husband our strength, so that both should not be exhausted at the same time; and this is how we managed: while one of us lay on our back, quite still, with arms crossed, and legs stretched out, the other would swim and push the other on in front. This towing business did not last more than ten minutes each; and relieving each other thus,"]]]
