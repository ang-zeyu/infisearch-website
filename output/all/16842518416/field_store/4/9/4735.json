But why do you want to know?\"  \"I sha'n't tell you that,\" said Tiny, who was spoilt by the Doctor, and consequently tyrannized in proportion; \"but I will tell you what I mean to do. I mean to tell Mother that when Father wants any more pocket-handkerchiefs hemmed, she had better put them by the bath in the nursery, and perhaps some Brownie will come and do them.\"  \"Kiss my fluffy face!\" said the Doctor in sepulchral tones.  \"The owl is too high up,\" said Tiny, tossing her head.  The Doctor lifted her four feet or so, obtained his kiss, and set her down again.  \"You're not fluffy at all,\" said she in a tone of the utmost contempt; \"you're tickly and bristly. Puss is more fluffy, and Father is scrubby and scratchy, because he shaves.\"  \"And which of the three styles do you prefer?\" said the Doctor.  \"Not tickly and bristly,\" said Tiny with firmness; and she strutted up the walk for a space or two, and then turned round to laugh over her shoulder.  \"Good-night!\" shouted her victim, shaking his fist after her.  The other children took a noisy farewell, and they all raced into the house to give joint versions of the fairy tale, first to the parents in the drawing-room, and then to Nurse in the nursery.  The Doctor went home also, with his poodle at his heels, but not by the way he came. He went out of his way, which was odd; but then the Doctor was \"a little odd,\" and moreover this was always the end of his evening walk. Through the church-yard, where spreading cedars and stiff yews rose from the velvet grass, and where among tombstones and crosses of various devices lay one of older and uglier date, by which he stayed. It was framed by a border of the most brilliant flowers, and it would seem as if the Doctor must have been the gardener, for he picked off some dead ones, and put them absently in his pocket. Then he looked round as if to see that he was alone. Not a soul was to be seen, and the moonlight and shadow lay quietly side by side, as the dead do in their graves. The Doctor stooped down and took off his hat.  \"Good-night, Marcia,\" he said in a low quiet voice. \"Good-night, my darling!\" The dog licked his hand, but there was no voice to answer, nor any that regarded.  Poor foolish Doctor! Most foolish to speak to the departed with his face earthwards. But we are weak mortals, the best of us; and this man (one of the very best) raised his head at last, and went home like a lonely owl with his face to the moon and the sky.   A BORROWED BROWNIE.   \"I can't imagine,\" said the Rector, walking into the drawing-room the following afternoon; \"I can't imagine where Tiny is. I want her to drive to the other end of the parish with me.\"  \"There she comes,\" said his wife, looking out of the window, \"by the garden-gate, with a great basket; what has she been after?\"  The Rector went out to discover, and met his daughter looking decidedly earthy, and seemingly much exhausted by the weight of a basketful of groundsel plants.  \"Where have you been?\" said he.  \"In the Doctor's garden,\" said Tiny triumphantly; \"and look what I have done! I've weeded his sweet-peas, and brought away the groundsel; so when he gets home to-night he'll think a Brownie has been in the garden, for Mrs. Pickles has promised not to tell him.\"  \"But look here!\" said the Rector, affecting a great appearance of severity, \"you're my Brownie, not his. Supposing Tommy Trout had gone and weeded Farmer Swede's garden, and brought back his weeds to go to seed on the Tailor's flower-beds, how do you think he would have liked it?\"  Tiny looked rather crestfallen. When one has fairly carried through a splendid benevolence of this kind, it is trying to find oneself in the wrong. She crept up to the Rector, however, and put her golden head upon his arm.  \"But, Father dear,\" she pleaded, \"I didn't mean not to be your Brownie; only, you know, you had got five left at home, and it was only for a short time, and the Doctor hasn't any Brownie at all. Don't you pity him?\"  And the Rector, who was old enough to remember that grave-stone story we wot of, hugged his Brownie in his arms, and answered,  \"My Darling, I do pity him!\"     THE LAND OF LOST TOYS.  AN EARTHQUAKE IN THE NURSERY.   It was certainly an aggravated offence. It is generally understood in families that \"boys will be boys,\" but there is a limit to the forbearance implied in the extenuating axiom. Master Sam was condemned to the back nursery for the rest of the day.  He always had had the knack of breaking his own toys,--he not unfrequently broke other people's; but accidents will happen, and his twin-sister and factotum, Dot, was long-suffering.  Dot was fat, resolute, hasty, and devotedly unselfish. When Sam scalped her new doll, and fastened the glossy black curls to a wigwam improvised with the curtains of the four-post bed in the best bedroom, Dot was sorely tried. As her eyes passed from the crown-less doll on the floor to the floss-silk ringlets hanging from the bed-furniture, her round rosy face grew rounder and rosier, and tears burst from her eyes. But in a moment more she clenched her little fists, forced back the tears, and gave vent to her favourite saying, \"I don't care.\"  That sentence was Dot's bane and antidote; it was her vice and her virtue. It was her standing consolation, and it brought her into all her scrapes. It was her one panacea for all the ups and downs of her life (and in the nursery where Sam developed his organ of destructiveness there were ups and downs not a few); and it was the form her naughtiness took when she was naughty.  \"Don't care fell into a goose-pond, Miss Dot,\" said Nurse, on one occasion of the kind.  \"I don't care if he did,\" said Miss Dot; and as Nurse knew no further feature of the goose-pond adventure which met this view of it, she closed the subject by putting Dot into the corner.  In the strength of _Don't care_, and her love for Sam, Dot bore much and long. Her dolls perished by ingenious but untimely deaths. Her toys were put to purposes for which they were never intended, and suffered accordingly. But Sam was penitent and Dot was heroic. Florinda's scalp was mended with a hot knitting-needle and a perpetual bonnet, and Dot rescued her paint-brushes from the glue-pot, and smelt her india-rubber as it boiled down in Sam's waterproof manufactory, with long-suffering forbearance.  There are, however, as we have said, limits to everything. An earthquake celebrated with the whole contents of the toy cupboard is not to be borne.  The matter was this. Early one morning Sam announced that he had a glorious project on hand. He was going to give a grand show and entertainment, far surpassing all the nursery imitations of circuses, conjurors, lectures on chemistry, and so forth, with which they had ever amused themselves. He refused to confide his plans to the faithful Dot; but he begged her to lend him all the toys she possessed, in return for which she was to be the sole spectator of the fun. He let out that the idea had suggested itself to him after the sight of a Diorama to which they had been taken, but he would not allow that it was anything of the same kind; in proof of which she was at liberty to keep back her paint-box. Dot tried hard to penetrate the secret, and to reserve some of her things from the general conscription. But Sam was obstinate. He would tell nothing, and he wanted everything. The dolls, the bricks (especially the bricks), the tea-things, the German farm, the Swiss cottages, the animals, and all the dolls' furniture. Dot gave them with a doubtful mind, and consoled herself as she watched Sam carrying pieces of board and a green table cover into the back nursery, with the prospect of the show. At last, Sam threw open the door and ushered her into the nursery rocking-chair.  The boy had certainly some constructive as well as destructive talent. Upon a sort of impromptu table covered with green cloth he had arranged all the toys in rough imitation of a town, with its streets and buildings. The relative proportion of the parts was certainly not good; but it was not Sam's fault that the doll's house and the German farm, his own brick buildings, and the Swiss cottages, were all on totally different scales of size. He had ingeniously put the larger things in the foreground, keeping the small farm-buildings from the German box at the far end of the streets, yet after all the perspective was extreme. The effect of three large horses from the toy stables in front, with the cows from the small Noah's Ark in the distance, was admirable; but the big dolls seated in an unroofed building, made with the wooden bricks on no architectural principle but that of a pound, and taking tea out of the new china tea-things, looked simply ridiculous.  Dot's eyes, however, saw no defects, and she clapped vehemently.  \"Here, ladies and gentlemen,\" said Sam, waving his hand politely towards the rocking-chair, \"you see the great city of Lisbon, the capital of Portugal--\"  At this display of geographical accuracy Dot fairly cheered, and rocked herself to and fro in unmitigated enjoyment.  \"--as it appeared,\" continued the showman, \"on the morning of November 1st, 1755.\"  Never having had occasion to apply Mangnall's Questions to the exigencies of every-day life, this date in no way disturbed Dot's comfort.  \"In this house,\" Sam proceeded, \"a party of Portuguese ladies of rank may be seen taking tea together.\"  \"_Breakfast_, you mean,\" said Dot, \"you said it was in the morning, you know.\"  \"Well, they took tea to their breakfast,\" said Sam. \"Don't interrupt me, Dot. You are the audience, and you mustn't speak. Here you see the horses of the English ambassador out airing with his groom. There you see two peasants--no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16052"],["title","The Brownies and Other Tales (#8)"],["body","! they are _not_ Noah and his wife, Dot, and if you go on talking I shall shut up. I say they are peasants peacefully driving cattle. At this moment a rumbling sound startles everyone in the city\"--here Sam rolled some croquet balls up and down in a box, but the dolls sat as quiet as before, and Dot alone was startled,--\"this was succeeded by a slight shock\"--here he shook the table, which upset some of the buildings belonging to the German farm.--\"Some houses fell.\"--Dot began to look anxious.--\"This shock was followed by several others\"---\"Take care,\" she begged--\"of increasing magnitude.\"--\"Oh, Sam!\" Dot shrieked, jumping up, \"you're breaking the china!\"--\"The largest buildings shook to their foundations.\"--\"Sam! Sam! the doll's house is falling,\" Dot cried, making wild efforts to save it: but Sam held her back with one arm, while with the other he began to pull at the boards which formed his table.--\"Suddenly the ground split and opened with a fearful yawn\"--Dot's shrieks shamed the impassive dolls, as Sam jerked out the boards by a dexterous movement, and doll's house, brick buildings, the farm, the Swiss cottages, and the whole toy-stock of the nursery sank together in ruins. Quite unabashed by the evident damage, Sam continued--\"and in a moment the whole magnificent city of Lisbon was swallowed up. Dot! Dot! don't be a muff! What is the matter? It's splendid fun. Things must be broken some time, and I'm sure it was exactly like the real thing. Dot! why don't you speak? Dot! my dear Dot! You don't care, do you? I didn't think you'd mind it so. It was such a splendid earthquake. Oh! try not to go on like that!\"  But Dot's feelings were far beyond her own control, much more that of Master Sam, at this moment. She was gasping and choking, and when at last she found breath it was only to throw herself on her face upon the floor with bitter and uncontrollable sobbing. It was certainly a mild punishment that condemned Master Sam to the back nursery for the rest of the day. It had, however, this additional severity, that during the afternoon Aunt Penelope was expected to arrive.   AUNT PENELOPE.  Aunt Penelope was one of those dear, good souls who, single themselves, have, as real or adopted relatives, the interests of a dozen families, instead of one, at heart. There are few people whose youth has not owned the influence of at least one such friend. It may be a good habit, the first interest in some life-loved pursuit or favourite author, some pretty feminine art, or delicate womanly counsel enforced by those narratives of real life that are more interesting than any fiction: it may be only the periodical return of gifts and kindness, and the store of family histories that no one else can tell; but we all owe something to such an aunt or uncle--the fairy godmothers of real life.  The benefits which Sam and Dot reaped from Aunt Penelope's visits may be summed up under the heads of presents and stories, with a general leaning to indulgence in the matters of punishment, lessons, and going to bed, which perhaps is natural to aunts and uncles who have no positive responsibilities in the young people's education, and are not the daily sufferers by the lack of due discipline.  Aunt Penelope's presents were lovely. Aunt Penelope's stories were charming. There was generally a moral wrapped up in them, like the motto in a cracker-bonbon; but it was quite in the inside, so to speak, and there was abundance of smart paper and sugar-plums.  All things considered, it was certainly most proper that the much-injured Dot should be dressed out in her best, and have access to dessert, the dining-room, and Aunt Penelope, whilst Sam was kept up-stairs. And yet it was Dot who (her first burst of grief being over) fought stoutly for his pardon all the time she was being dressed, and was afterwards detected in the act of endeavouring to push fragments of raspberry tart through the nursery keyhole.  \"You GOOD thing!\" Sam emphatically exclaimed, as he heard her in fierce conflict on the other side of the door with the nurse who found her--\"You GOOD thing! leave me alone, for I deserve it.\"  He really was very penitent He was too fond of Dot not to regret the unexpected degree of distress he had caused her; and Dot made much of his penitence in her intercessions in the drawing-room.  \"Sam is so very sorry,\" she said; \"he says he knows he deserves it. I think he ought to come down. He is so _very_ sorry!\"  Aunt Penelope, as usual, took the lenient side, joining her entreaties to Dot's, and it ended in Master Sam's being hurriedly scrubbed and brushed, and shoved into his black velvet suit, and sent down-stairs, rather red about the eyelids, and looking very sheepish.  \"Oh, Dot!\" he exclaimed, as soon as he could get her into a corner, \"I am so very, very sorry! particularly about the tea-things.\"  \"Never mind,\" said Dot, \"I don't care; and I've asked for a story, and we're going into the library.\" As Dot said this, she jerked her head expressively in the direction of the sofa, where Aunt Penelope was just casting on stitches preparatory to beginning a pair of her famous ribbed socks for Papa, whilst she gave to Mamma's conversation that sympathy which (like her knitting-needles) was always at the service of her large circle of friends. Dot anxiously watched the bow on the top of her cap as it danced and nodded with the force of Mamma's observations. At last it gave a little chorus of jerks, as one should say, \"Certainly, undoubtedly.\" And then the story came to an end, and Dot, who had been slowly creeping nearer, fairly took Aunt Penelope by the hand, and carried her off, knitting and all, to the library.  \"Now, please,\" said Dot, when she had struggled into a chair that was too tall for her.  \"Stop a minute!\" cried Sam, who was perched in the opposite one, \"the horse-hair tickles my legs.\"  \"Put your pocket-handkerchief under them, as I do,\" said Dot. \"_Now_, Aunt Penelope.\"  \"No, wait,\" groaned Sam; \"it isn't big enough; it only covers one leg.\"  Dot slid down again, and ran to Sam.  \"Take my handkerchief for the other.\"  \"But what will you do?\" said Sam.  \"Oh, I don't care,\" said Dot, scrambling back into her place. \"Now, Aunty, please.\"  And Aunt Penelope began.   \"THE LAND OF LOST TOYS.  \"I suppose people who have children transfer their childish follies and fancies to them, and become properly sedate and grown-up. Perhaps it is because I am an old maid, and have none, that some of my nursery whims stick to me, and I find myself liking things, and wanting things, quite out of keeping with my cap and time of life. For instance. Anything in the shape of a toy-shop (from a London bazaar to a village window, with Dutch dolls, leather balls, and wooden battledores) quite unnerves me, so to speak. When I see one of those boxes containing a jar, a churn, a kettle, a pan, a coffee-pot, a cauldron on three legs, and sundry dishes, all of the smoothest wood, and with the immemorial red flower on one side of each vessel, I fairly long for an excuse for playing with them, and for trying (positively for the last time) if the lids _do_ come off, and whether the kettle will (literally, as well as metaphorically) hold water. Then if, by good or ill luck, there is a child flattening its little nose against the window with longing eyes, my purse is soon empty; and as it toddles off with a square parcel under one arm, and a lovely being in black ringlets and white tissue paper in the other, I wish that I were worthy of being asked to join the ensuing play. Don't suppose there is any generosity in this. I have only done what we are all glad to do. I have found an excuse for indulging a pet weakness. As I said, it is not merely the new and expensive toys that attract me; I think my weakest corner is where the penny boxes lie, the wooden tea-things (with the above-named flower in miniature), the soldiers on their lazy tongs, the nine-pins, and the tiny farm.  \"I need hardly say that the toy booth in a village fair tries me very hard. It tried me in childhood, when I was often short of pence, and when 'the Feast' came once a year. It never tried me more than on one occasion, lately, when I was re-visiting my old home.  \"It was deep Midsummer, and the Feast. I had children with me of course (I find children, somehow, wherever I go), and when we got into the fair, there were children of people whom I had known as children, with just the same love for a monkey going up one side of a yellow stick and coming down the other, and just as strong heads for a giddy-go-round on a hot day and a diet of peppermint lozenges, as their fathers and mothers before them. There were the very same names--and here and there it seemed the very same faces--I knew so long ago. A few shillings were indeed well expended in brightening those familiar eyes: and then there were the children with me.... Besides, there really did seem to be an unusually nice assortment of things, and the man was very intelligent (in reference to his wares):.... Well, well! It was two o'clock P.M. when we went in at one end of that glittering avenue of drums, dolls, trumpets, accordions, workboxes, and what not; but what o'clock it was when I came out at the other end, with a shilling and some coppers in my pocket, and was cheered, I can't say, though I should like to have been able to be accurate about the time, because of what followed.  \"I thought the best thing I could do was to get out of the fair at once, so I went up the village and struck off across some fields into a little wood that lay near. (A favourite walk in old times.) As I turned out of the booth, my foot struck against one of the yellow sticks of the climbing monkeys. The monkey was gone, and the stick broken. It set me thinking as I walked along.  \"What an untold number of pretty and ingenious things one does (not wear out in honourable wear and tear, but) utterly lose, and wilfully destroy, in one's young days--things that would"]]]
