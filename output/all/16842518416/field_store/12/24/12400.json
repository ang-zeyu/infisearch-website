[Note 20: The strong influence exercised by Byron’s genius on the    imagination of Pushkin is well known. Shakespeare and other    English dramatists had also their share in influencing his mind,    which, at all events in its earlier developments, was of an    essentially imitative type. As an example of his Shakespearian    tastes, see his poem of “Angelo,” founded upon “Measure for Measure.”]     XLIV     When will my hour of freedom come!    Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales    Awaiting on the shore I roam    And beckon to the passing sails.    Upon the highway of the sea    When shall I wing my passage free    On waves by tempests curdled o’er!    ’Tis time to quit this weary shore    So uncongenial to my mind,    To dream upon the sunny strand    Of Africa, ancestral land,(21)    Of dreary Russia left behind,    Wherein I felt love’s fatal dart,    Wherein I buried left my heart.     [Note 21: The poet was, on his mother’s side, of African extraction,    a circumstance which perhaps accounts for the southern fervour of    his imagination. His great-grandfather, Abraham Petròvitch Hannibal,    was seized on the coast of Africa when eight years of age by a    corsair, and carried a slave to Constantinople. The Russian    Ambassador bought and presented him to Peter the Great who caused    him to be baptized at Vilnius. Subsequently one of Hannibal’s    brothers made his way to Constantinople and thence to St. Petersburg    for the purpose of ransoming him; but Peter would not surrender his    godson who died at the age of ninety-two, having attained the rank    of general in the Russian service.]     XLV     Eugene designed with me to start    And visit many a foreign clime,    But Fortune cast our lots apart    For a protracted space of time.    Just at that time his father died,    And soon Onéguine’s door beside    Of creditors a hungry rout    Their claims and explanations shout.    But Eugene, hating litigation    And with his lot in life content,    To a surrender gave consent,    Seeing in this no deprivation,    Or counting on his uncle’s death    And what the old man might bequeath.     XLVI     And in reality one day    The steward sent a note to tell    How sick to death his uncle lay    And wished to say to him farewell.    Having this mournful document    Perused, Eugene in postchaise went    And hastened to his uncle’s side,    But in his heart dissatisfied,    Having for money’s sake alone    Sorrow to counterfeit and wail—    Thus we began our little tale—    But, to his uncle’s mansion flown,    He found him on the table laid,    A due which must to earth be paid.     XLVII     The courtyard full of serfs he sees,    And from the country all around    Had come both friends and enemies—    Funeral amateurs abound!    The body they consigned to rest,    And then made merry pope and guest,    With serious air then went away    As men who much had done that day.    Lo! my Onéguine rural lord!    Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,    He now a full possession takes,    He who economy abhorred,    Delighted much his former ways    To vary for a few brief days.     XLVIII     For two whole days it seemed a change    To wander through the meadows still,    The cool dark oaken grove to range,    To listen to the rippling rill.    But on the third of grove and mead    He took no more the slightest heed;    They made him feel inclined to doze;    And the conviction soon arose,    Ennui can in the country dwell    Though without palaces and streets,    Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fêtes;    On him spleen mounted sentinel    And like his shadow dogged his life,    Or better,—like a faithful wife.     XLIX     I was for calm existence made,    For rural solitude and dreams,    My lyre sings sweeter in the shade    And more imagination teems.    On innocent delights I dote,    Upon my lake I love to float,    For law I _far niente_ take    And every morning I awake    The child of sloth and liberty.    I slumber much, a little read,    Of fleeting glory take no heed.    In former years thus did not I    In idleness and tranquil joy    The happiest days of life employ?     L     Love, flowers, the country, idleness    And fields my joys have ever been;    I like the difference to express    Between myself and my Eugene,    Lest the malicious reader or    Some one or other editor    Of keen sarcastic intellect    Herein my portrait should detect,    And impiously should declare,    To sketch myself that I have tried    Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,    As if impossible it were    To write of any other elf    Than one’s own fascinating self.     LI     Here I remark all poets are    Love to idealize inclined;    I have dreamed many a vision fair    And the recesses of my mind    Retained the image, though short-lived,    Which afterwards the muse revived.    Thus carelessly I once portrayed    Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,    The captives of the Salguir’s shore.(22)    But now a question in this wise    Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:    Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?    To whom amongst the jealous throng    Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?     [Note 22: Refers to two of the most interesting productions of    the poet. The former line indicates the _Prisoner of the    Caucasus_, the latter, _The Fountain of Baktchiserai_. The    Salguir is a river of the Crimea.]     LII     Whose glance reflecting inspiration    With tenderness hath recognized    Thy meditative incantation—    Whom hath thy strain immortalized?    None, be my witness Heaven above!    The malady of hopeless love    I have endured without respite.    Happy who thereto can unite    Poetic transport. They impart    A double force unto their song    Who following Petrarch move along    And ease the tortures of the heart—    Perchance they laurels also cull—    But I, in love, was mute and dull.     LIII     The Muse appeared, when love passed by    And my dark soul to light was brought;    Free, I renewed the idolatry    Of harmony enshrining thought.    I write, and anguish flies away,    Nor doth my absent pen portray    Around my stanzas incomplete    Young ladies’ faces and their feet.    Extinguished ashes do not blaze—    I mourn, but tears I cannot shed—    Soon, of the tempest which hath fled    Time will the ravages efface—    When that time comes, a poem I’ll strive    To write in cantos twenty-five.     LIV     I’ve thought well o’er the general plan,    The hero’s name too in advance,    Meantime I’ll finish whilst I can    Canto the First of this romance.    I’ve scanned it with a jealous eye,    Discovered much absurdity,    But will not modify a tittle—    I owe the censorship a little.    For journalistic deglutition    I yield the fruit of work severe.    Go, on the Neva’s bank appear,    My very latest composition!    Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows—    Misunderstanding, words and blows.     END OF CANTO THE FIRST           CANTO THE SECOND      The Poet     “O Rus!”—Horace     Canto The Second     [Note: Odessa, December 1823.]     I     The village wherein yawned Eugene    Was a delightful little spot,    There friends of pure delight had been    Grateful to Heaven for their lot.    The lonely mansion-house to screen    From gales a hill behind was seen;    Before it ran a stream. Behold!    Afar, where clothed in green and gold    Meadows and cornfields are displayed,    Villages in the distance show    And herds of oxen wandering low;    Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,    A thick immense neglected grove    Extended—haunt which Dryads love.     II     ’Twas built, the venerable pile,    As lordly mansions ought to be,    In solid, unpretentious style,    The style of wise antiquity.    Lofty the chambers one and all,    Silk tapestry upon the wall,    Imperial portraits hang around    And stoves of various shapes abound.    All this I know is out of date,    I cannot tell the reason why,    But Eugene, incontestably,    The matter did not agitate,    Because he yawned at the bare view    Of drawing-rooms or old or new.     III     He took the room wherein the old    Man—forty years long in this wise—    His housekeeper was wont to scold,    Look through the window and kill flies.    ’Twas plain—an oaken floor ye scan,    Two cupboards, table, soft divan,    And not a speck of dirt descried.    Onéguine oped the cupboards wide.    In one he doth accounts behold,    Here bottles stand in close array,    There jars of cider block the way,    An almanac but eight years old.    His uncle, busy man indeed,    No other book had time to read.     IV     Alone amid possessions great,    Eugene at first began to dream,    If but to lighten Time’s dull rate,    Of many an economic scheme;    This anchorite amid his waste    The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced    By an _obrok’s_ indulgent rate:(23)    The peasant blessed his happy fate.    But this a heinous crime appeared    Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,    Who secretly denounced the gift,    And many another slily sneered;    And all with one accord agreed,    He was a dangerous fool indeed.     [Note 23: The _barshtchina_ was the corvée, or forced labour    of three days per week rendered previous to the emancipation    of 1861 by the serfs to their lord.     The _obrok_ was a species of poll-tax paid by a serf, either    in lieu of the forced labour or in consideration of being    permitted to exercise a trade or profession elsewhere. Very    heavy obroks have at times been levied on serfs possessed of    skill or accomplishments, or who had amassed wealth; and    circumstances may be easily imagined which, under such a    system, might lead to great abuses.]     V     All visited him at first, of course;    But since to the backdoor they led    Most usually a Cossack horse    Upon the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23997"],["title","Eugene Oneguine [Onegin] (#6)"],["body","on’s broad pastures bred    If they but heard domestic loads    Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,    Most by this circumstance offended    All overtures of friendship ended.    “Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!    He’s a freemason, so we think.    Alone he doth his claret drink,    A lady’s hand doth never kiss.    ’Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_”(24)    This was his social character.     [Note 24: The neighbours complained of Onéguine’s want of courtesy.    He always replied “da” or “nyet,” yes or no, instead of “das”    or “nyets”—the final s being a contraction of “sudar” or    “sudarinia,” i.e. sir or madam.]     VI     Into the district then to boot    A new proprietor arrived,    From whose analysis minute    The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.    Vladimir Lenski was his name,    From Gottingen inspired he came,    A worshipper of Kant, a bard,    A young and handsome galliard.    He brought from mystic Germany    The fruits of learning and combined    A fiery and eccentric mind,    Idolatry of liberty,    A wild enthusiastic tongue,    Black curls which to his shoulders hung.     VII     The pervert world with icy chill    Had not yet withered his young breast.    His heart reciprocated still    When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.    He was a dear delightful fool—    A nursling yet for Hope to school.    The riot of the world and glare    Still sovereigns of his spirit were,    And by a sweet delusion he    Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,    He deemed of human life the goal    To be a charming mystery:    He racked his brains to find its clue    And marvels deemed he thus should view.     VIII     This he believed: a kindred spirit    Impelled to union with his own    Lay languishing both day and night—    Waiting his coming—his alone!    He deemed his friends but longed to make    Great sacrifices for his sake!    That a friend’s arm in every case    Felled a calumniator base!    That chosen heroes consecrate,    Friends of the sons of every land,    Exist—that their immortal band    Shall surely, be it soon or late,    Pour on this orb a dazzling light    And bless mankind with full delight.     IX     Compassion now or wrath inspires    And now philanthropy his soul,    And now his youthful heart desires    The path which leads to glory’s goal.    His harp beneath that sky had rung    Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,    And at the altar of their fame    He kindled his poetic flame.    But from the Muses’ loftiest height    The gifted songster never swerved,    But proudly in his song preserved    An ever transcendental flight;    His transports were quite maidenly,    Charming with grave simplicity.     X     He sang of love—to love a slave.    His ditties were as pure and bright    As thoughts which gentle maidens have,    As a babe’s slumber, or the light    Of the moon in the tranquil skies,    Goddess of lovers’ tender sighs.    He sang of separation grim,    Of what not, and of distant dim,    Of roses to romancers dear;    To foreign lands he would allude,    Where long time he in solitude    Had let fall many a bitter tear:    He sang of life’s fresh colours stained    Before he eighteen years attained.     XI     Since Eugene in that solitude    Gifts such as these alone could prize,    A scant attendance Lenski showed    At neighbouring hospitalities.    He shunned those parties boisterous;    The conversation tedious    About the crop of hay, the wine,    The kennel or a kindred line,    Was certainly not erudite    Nor sparkled with poetic fire,    Nor wit, nor did the same inspire    A sense of social delight,    But still more stupid did appear    The gossip of their ladies fair.     XII     Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood    Lenski as a good match received,—    Such is the country custom good;    All mothers their sweet girls believed    Suitable for this semi-Russian.    He enters: rapidly discussion    Shifts, tacks about, until they prate    The sorrows of a single state.    Perchance where Dunia pours out tea    The young proprietor we find;    To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!    And a guitar produced we see,    And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:    _Come to my golden palace, dear_!(25)     [Note 25: From the lay of the _Russalka_, i.e. mermaid of the Dnieper.]     XIII     But Lenski, having no desire    Vows matrimonial to break,    With our Onéguine doth aspire    Acquaintance instantly to make.    They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,    Or ice and flame, are not diverse    If they were similar in aught.    At first such contradictions wrought    Mutual repulsion and ennui,    But grown familiar side by side    On horseback every day they ride—    Inseparable soon they be.    Thus oft—this I myself confess—    Men become friends from idleness.     XIV     But even thus not now-a-days!    In spite of common sense we’re wont    As cyphers others to appraise,    Ourselves as unities to count;    And like Napoleons each of us    A million bipeds reckons thus    One instrument for his own use—    Feeling is silly, dangerous.    Eugene, more tolerant than this    (Though certainly mankind he knew    And usually despised it too),    Exceptionless as no rule is,    A few of different temper deemed,    Feeling in others much esteemed.     XV     With smiling face he Lenski hears;    The poet’s fervid conversation    And judgment which unsteady veers    And eye which gleams with inspiration—    All this was novel to Eugene.    The cold reply with gloomy mien    He oft upon his lips would curb,    Thinking: ’tis foolish to disturb    This evanescent boyish bliss.    Time without me will lessons give,    So meantime let him joyous live    And deem the world perfection is!    Forgive the fever youth inspires,    And youthful madness, youthful fires.     XVI     The gulf between them was so vast,    Debate commanded ample food—    The laws of generations past,    The fruits of science, evil, good,    The prejudices all men have,    The fatal secrets of the grave,    And life and fate in turn selected    Were to analysis subjected.    The fervid poet would recite,    Carried away by ecstasy,    Fragments of northern poetry,    Whilst Eugene condescending quite,    Though scarcely following what was said,    Attentive listened to the lad.     XVII     But more the passions occupy    The converse of our hermits twain,    And, heaving a regretful sigh,    An exile from their troublous reign,    Eugene would speak regarding these.    Thrice happy who their agonies    Hath suffered but indifferent grown,    Still happier he who ne’er hath known!    By absence who hath chilled his love,    His hate by slander, and who spends    Existence without wife or friends,    Whom jealous transport cannot move,    And who the rent-roll of his race    Ne’er trusted to the treacherous ace.     XVIII     When, wise at length, we seek repose    Beneath the flag of Quietude,    When Passion’s fire no longer glows    And when her violence reviewed—    Each gust of temper, silly word,    Seems so unnatural and absurd:    Reduced with effort unto sense,    We hear with interest intense    The accents wild of other’s woes,    They stir the heart as heretofore.    So ancient warriors, battles o’er,    A curious interest disclose    In yarns of youthful troopers gay,    Lost in the hamlet far away.     XIX     And in addition youth is flame    And cannot anything conceal,    Is ever ready to proclaim    The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.    Deeming himself a veteran scarred    In love’s campaigns Onéguine heard    With quite a lachrymose expression    The youthful poet’s fond confession.    He with an innocence extreme    His inner consciousness laid bare,    And Eugene soon discovered there    The story of his young love’s dream,    Where plentifully feelings flow    Which we experienced long ago.     XX     Alas! he loved as in our times    Men love no more, as only the    Mad spirit of the man who rhymes    Is still condemned in love to be;    One image occupied his mind,    Constant affection intertwined    And an habitual sense of pain;    And distance interposed in vain,    Nor years of separation all    Nor homage which the Muse demands    Nor beauties of far distant lands    Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball    His constant soul could ever tire,    Which glowed with virginal desire.     XXI     When but a boy he Olga loved    Unknown as yet the aching heart,    He witnessed tenderly and moved    Her girlish gaiety and sport.    Beneath the sheltering oak tree’s shade    He with his little maiden played,    Whilst the fond parents, friends thro’ life,    Dreamed in the future man and wife.    And full of innocent delight,    As in a thicket’s humble shade,    Beneath her parents’ eyes the maid    Grew like a lily pure and white,    Unseen in thick and tangled grass    By bee and butterfly which pass.     XXII     ’Twas she who first within his breast    Poetic transport did infuse,    And thoughts of Olga first impressed    A mournful temper on his Muse.    Farewell! thou golden days of love!    ’Twas then he loved the tangled grove    And solitude and calm delight,    The moon, the stars, and shining night—    The moon, the lamp of heaven above,    To whom we used to consecrate    A promenade in twilight late    With tears which secret sufferers love—    But now in her effulgence pale    A substitute for lamps we hail!     XXIII     Obedient she had ever been    And modest, cheerful as the morn,    As a poetic life serene,    Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.    Her eyes were of cerulean blue,    Her locks were of a golden hue,    Her movements, voice and figure slight,    All about Olga—to a light    Romance of love I pray refer,    You’ll find her portrait there, I vouch;    I formerly admired her much    But finally grew bored by her.    But with her elder sister I    Must now my stanzas occupy.     XXIV     Tattiana was her appellation.    We are the first who"]]]
