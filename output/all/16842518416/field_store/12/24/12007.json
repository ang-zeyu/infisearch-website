Only a week or so ago we had a man here upon the same errand.\"  \"Did he give a name?\" I asked.  \"None; but he was an Englishman, though of an unusual type.\"  \"A savage?\" said I, linking my facts after the fashion of my illustrious friend.  \"Exactly.  That describes him very well. He is a bulky, bearded, sunburned fellow, who looks as if he would be more at home in a farmers' inn than in a fashionable hotel.  A hard, fierce man, I should think, and one whom I should be sorry to offend.\"  Already the mystery began to define itself, as figures grow clearer with the lifting of a fog.  Here was this good and pious lady pursued from place to place by a sinister and unrelenting figure.  She feared him, or she would not have fled from Lausanne.  He had still followed. Sooner or later he would overtake her.  Had he already overtaken her? Was THAT the secret of her continued silence?  Could the good people who were her companions not screen her from his violence or his blackmail? What horrible purpose, what deep design, lay behind this long pursuit?  There was the problem which I had to solve.  To Holmes I wrote showing how rapidly and surely I had got down to the roots of the matter.  In reply I had a telegram asking for a description of Dr. Shlessinger's left ear.  Holmes's ideas of humour are strange and occasionally offensive, so I took no notice of his ill-timed jest--indeed, I had already reached Montpellier in my pursuit of the maid, Marie, before his message came.  I had no difficulty in finding the ex-servant and in learning all that she could tell me.  She was a devoted creature, who had only left her mistress because she was sure that she was in good hands, and because her own approaching marriage made a separation inevitable in any case. Her mistress had, as she confessed with distress, shown some irritability of temper towards her during their stay in Baden, and had even questioned her once as if she had suspicions of her honesty, and this had made the parting easier than it would otherwise have been. Lady Frances had given her fifty pounds as a wedding-present.  Like me, Marie viewed with deep distrust the stranger who had driven her mistress from Lausanne.  With her own eyes she had seen him seize the lady's wrist with great violence on the public promenade by the lake. He was a fierce and terrible man.  She believed that it was out of dread of him that Lady Frances had accepted the escort of the Shlessingers to London.  She had never spoken to Marie about it, but many little signs had convinced the maid that her mistress lived in a state of continual nervous apprehension.  So far she had got in her narrative, when suddenly she sprang from her chair and her face was convulsed with surprise and fear.  \"See!\" she cried.  \"The miscreant follows still!  There is the very man of whom I speak.\"  Through the open sitting-room window I saw a huge, swarthy man with a bristling black beard walking slowly down the centre of the street and staring eagerly at the numbers of the houses.  It was clear that, like myself, he was on the track of the maid. Acting upon the impulse of the moment, I rushed out and accosted him.  \"You are an Englishman,\" I said.  \"What if I am?\" he asked with a most villainous scowl.  \"May I ask what your name is?\"  \"No, you may not,\" said he with decision.  The situation was awkward, but the most direct way is often the best.  \"Where is the Lady Frances Carfax?\" I asked.  He stared at me with amazement.  \"What have you done with her?  Why have you pursued her?  I insist upon an answer!\" said I.  The fellow gave a bellow of anger and sprang upon me like a tiger. I have held my own in many a struggle, but the man had a grip of iron and the fury of a fiend.  His hand was on my throat and my senses were nearly gone before an unshaven French ouvrier in a blue blouse darted out from a cabaret opposite, with a cudgel in his hand, and struck my assailant a sharp crack over the forearm, which made him leave go his hold.  He stood for an instant fuming with rage and uncertain whether he should not renew his attack. Then, with a snarl of anger, he left me and entered the cottage from which I had just come.  I turned to thank my preserver, who stood beside me in the roadway.  \"Well, Watson,\" said he, \"a very pretty hash you have made of it! I rather think you had better come back with me to London by the night express.\"  An hour afterwards, Sherlock Holmes, in his usual garb and style, was seated in my private room at the hotel.  His explanation of his sudden and opportune appearance was simplicity itself, for, finding that he could get away from London, he determined to head me off at the next obvious point of my travels.  In the disguise of a workingman he had sat in the cabaret waiting for my appearance.  \"And a singularly consistent investigation you have made, my dear Watson,\" said he.  \"I cannot at the moment recall any possible blunder which you have omitted.  The total effect of your proceeding has been to give the alarm everywhere and yet to discover nothing.\"  \"Perhaps you would have done no better,\" I answered bitterly.  \"There is no 'perhaps' about it.  I HAVE done better.  Here is the Hon. Philip Green, who is a fellow-lodger with you in this hotel, and we may find him the starting-point for a more successful investigation.\"  A card had come up on a salver, and it was followed by the same bearded ruffian who had attacked me in the street.  He started when he saw me.  \"What is this, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.  \"I had your note and I have come.  But what has this man to do with the matter?\"  \"This is my old friend and associate, Dr. Watson, who is helping us in this affair.\"  The stranger held out a huge, sunburned hand, with a few words of apology.  \"I hope I didn't harm you.  When you accused me of hurting her I lost my grip of myself.  Indeed, I'm not responsible in these days.  My nerves are like live wires.  But this situation is beyond me.  What I want to know, in the first place, Mr. Holmes, is, how in the world you came to hear of my existence at all.\"  \"I am in touch with Miss Dobney, Lady Frances's governess.\"  \"Old Susan Dobney with the mob cap!  I remember her well.\"  \"And she remembers you.  It was in the days before--before you found it better to go to South Africa.\"  \"Ah, I see you know my whole story.  I need hide nothing from you.  I swear to you, Mr. Holmes, that there never was in this world a man who loved a woman with a more wholehearted love than I had for Frances.  I was a wild youngster, I know--not worse than others of my class.  But her mind was pure as snow.  She could not bear a shadow of coarseness. So, when she came to hear of things that I had done, she would have no more to say to me. And yet she loved me--that is the wonder of it!--loved me well enough to remain single all her sainted days just for my sake alone.  When the years had passed and I had made my money at Barberton I thought perhaps I could seek her out and soften her. I had heard that she was still unmarried, I found her at Lausanne and tried all I knew.  She weakened, I think, but her will was strong, and when next I called she had left the town.  I traced her to Baden, and then after a time heard that her maid was here. I'm a rough fellow, fresh from a rough life, and when Dr. Watson spoke to me as he did I lost hold of myself for a moment.  But for God's sake tell me what has become of the Lady Frances.\"  \"That is for us to find out,\" said Sherlock Holmes with peculiar gravity.  \"What is your London address, Mr. Green?\"  \"The Langham Hotel will find me.\"  \"Then may I recommend that you return there and be on hand in case I should want you?  I have no desire to encourage false hopes, but you may rest assured that all that can be done will be done for the safety of Lady Frances.  I can say no more for the instant.  I will leave you this card so that you may be able to keep in touch with us.  Now, Watson, if you will pack your bag I will cable to Mrs. Hudson to make one of her best efforts for two hungry travellers at 7:30 to-morrow.\"   A telegram was awaiting us when we reached our Baker Street rooms, which Holmes read with an exclamation of interest and threw across to me.  \"Jagged or torn,\" was the message, and the place of origin, Baden.  \"What is this?\" I asked.  \"It is everything,\" Holmes answered.  \"You may remember my seemingly irrelevant question as to this clerical gentleman's left ear. You did not answer it.\"  \"I had left Baden and could not inquire.\"  \"Exactly.  For this reason I sent a duplicate to the manager of the Englischer Hof, whose answer lies here.\"  \"What does it show?\"  \"It shows, my dear Watson, that we are dealing with an exceptionally astute and dangerous man.  The Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, missionary from South America, is none other than Holy Peters, one of the most unscrupulous rascals that Australia has ever evolved--and for a young country it has turned out some very finished types.  His particular specialty is the beguiling of lonely ladies by playing upon their religious feelings, and his so-called wife, an Englishwoman named Fraser, is a worthy helpmate.  The nature of his tactics suggested his identity to me, and this physical peculiarity--he was badly bitten in a saloon-fight at Adelaide in '89--confirmed my suspicion.  This poor lady is in the hands of a most infernal couple, who will stick at nothing, Watson.  That she is already dead is a very likely supposition.  If not, she is undoubtedly in some sort of confinement and unable to write to Miss Dobney or her other friends.  It is always possible that she never reached London, or that she has passed through it, but the former is improbable, as, with their system of registration, it is not easy for foreigners to play tricks"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2348"],["title","The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax (#2)"],["body","the Continental police; and the latter is also unlikely, as these rouges could not hope to find any other place where it would be as easy to keep a person under restraint. All my instincts tell me that she is in London, but as we have at present no possible means of telling where, we can only take the obvious steps, eat our dinner, and possess our souls in patience. Later in the evening I will stroll down and have a word with friend Lestrade at Scotland Yard.\"  But neither the official police nor Holmes's own small but very efficient organization sufficed to clear away the mystery.  Amid the crowded millions of London the three persons we sought were as completely obliterated as if they had never lived. Advertisements were tried, and failed.  Clues were followed, and led to nothing.  Every criminal resort which Shlessinger might frequent was drawn in vain. His old associates were watched, but they kept clear of him.  And then suddenly, after a week of helpless suspense there came a flash of light.  A silver-and-brilliant pendant of old Spanish design had been pawned at Bovington's, in Westminster Road.  The pawner was a large, clean-shaven man of clerical appearance.  His name and address were demonstrably false.  The ear had escaped notice, but the description was surely that of Shlessinger.  Three times had our bearded friend from the Langham called for news--the third time within an hour of this fresh development. His clothes were getting looser on his great body.  He seemed to be wilting away in his anxiety.  \"If you will only give me something to do!\" was his constant wail.  At last Holmes could oblige him.  \"He has begun to pawn the jewels.  We should get him now.\"  \"But does this mean that any harm has befallen the Lady Frances?\"  Holmes shook his head very gravely.  \"Supposing that they have held her prisoner up to now, it is clear that they cannot let her loose without their own destruction.  We must prepare for the worst.\"  \"What can I do?\"  \"These people do not know you by sight?\"  \"No.\"  \"It is possible that he will go to some other pawnbroker in the future. In that case, we must begin again.  On the other hand, he has had a fair price and no questions asked, so if he is in need of ready-money he will probably come back to Bovington's.  I will give you a note to them, and they will let you wait in the shop.  If the fellow comes you will follow him home.  But no indiscretion, and, above all, no violence.  I put you on your honour that you will take no step without my knowledge and consent.\"  For two days the Hon. Philip Green (he was, I may mention, the son of the famous admiral of that name who commanded the Sea of Azof fleet in the Crimean War) brought us no news.  On the evening of the third he rushed into our sitting-room, pale, trembling, with every muscle of his powerful frame quivering with excitement.  \"We have him!  We have him!\" he cried.  He was incoherent in his agitation.  Holmes soothed him with a few words and thrust him into an armchair.  \"Come, now, give us the order of events,\" said he.  \"She came only an hour ago.  It was the wife, this time, but the pendant she brought was the fellow of the other.  She is a tall, pale woman, with ferret eyes.\"  \"That is the lady,\" said Holmes.  \"She left the office and I followed her.  She walked up the Kennington Road, and I kept behind her.  Presently she went into a shop.  Mr. Holmes, it was an undertaker's.\"  My companion started.  \"Well?\" he asked in that vibrant voice which told of the fiery soul behind the cold gray face.  \"She was talking to the woman behind the counter. I entered as well. 'It is late,' I heard her say, or words to that effect. The woman was excusing herself.  'It should be there before now,' she answered.  'It took longer, being out of the ordinary.'  They both stopped and looked at me, so I asked some questions and then left the shop.\"  \"You did excellently well.  What happened next?\"  \"The woman came out, but I had hid myself in a doorway.  Her suspicions had been aroused, I think, for she looked round her. Then she called a cab and got in.  I was lucky enough to get another and so to follow her.  She got down at last at No. 36, Poultney Square, Brixton.  I drove past, left my cab at the corner of the square, and watched the house.\"  \"Did you see anyone?\"  \"The windows were all in darkness save one on the lower floor. The blind was down, and I could not see in.  I was standing there, wondering what I should do next, when a covered van drove up with two men in it.  They descended, took something out of the van, and carried it up the steps to the hall door.  Mr. Holmes, it was a coffin.\"  \"Ah!\"  \"For an instant I was on the point of rushing in.  The door had been opened to admit the men and their burden. It was the woman who had opened it.  But as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me, and I think that she recognized me.  I saw her start, and she hastily closed the door. I remembered my promise to you, and here I am.\"  \"You have done excellent work,\" said Holmes, scribbling a few words upon a half-sheet of paper.  \"We can do nothing legal without a warrant, and you can serve the cause best by taking this note down to the authorities and getting one.  There may be some difficulty, but I should think that the sale of the jewellery should be sufficient. Lestrade will see to all details.\"  \"But they may murder her in the meanwhile.  What could the coffin mean, and for whom could it be but for her?\"  \"We will do all that can be done, Mr. Green.  Not a moment will be lost.  Leave it in our hands.  Now Watson,\" he added as our client hurried away, \"he will set the regular forces on the move. We are, as usual, the irregulars, and we must take our own line of action.  The situation strikes me as so desperate that the most extreme measures are justified.  Not a moment is to be lost in getting to Poultney Square.  \"Let us try to reconstruct the situation,\" said he as we drove swiftly past the Houses of Parliament and over Westminster Bridge.  \"These villains have coaxed this unhappy lady to London, after first alienating her from her faithful maid.  If she has written any letters they have been intercepted.  Through some confederate they have engaged a furnished house.  Once inside it, they have made her a prisoner, and they have become possessed of the valuable jewellery which has been their object from the first.  Already they have begun to sell part of it, which seems safe enough to them, since they have no reason to think that anyone is interested in the lady's fate.  When she is released she will, of course, denounce them.  Therefore, she must not be released. But they cannot keep her under lock and key forever. So murder is their only solution.\"  \"That seems very clear.\"  \"Now we will take another line of reasoning.  When you follow two separate chains of thought, Watson, you will find some point of intersection which should approximate to the truth.  We will start now, not from the lady but from the coffin and argue backward.  That incident proves, I fear, beyond all doubt that the lady is dead.  It points also to an orthodox burial with proper accompaniment of medical certificate and official sanction.  Had the lady been obviously murdered, they would have buried her in a hole in the back garden.  But here all is open and regular.  What does this mean?  Surely that they have done her to death in some way which has deceived the doctor and simulated a natural end--poisoning, perhaps.  And yet how strange that they should ever let a doctor approach her unless he were a confederate, which is hardly a credible proposition.\"  \"Could they have forged a medical certificate?\"  \"Dangerous, Watson, very dangerous.  No, I hardly see them doing that. Pull up, cabby!  This is evidently the undertaker's, for we have just passed the pawnbroker's.  Would you go in, Watson?  Your appearance inspires confidence.  Ask what hour the Poultney Square funeral takes place to-morrow.\"  The woman in the shop answered me without hesitation that it was to be at eight o'clock in the morning.  \"You see, Watson, no mystery; everything above-board!  In some way the legal forms have undoubtedly been complied with, and they think that they have little to fear. Well, there's nothing for it now but a direct frontal attack.  Are you armed?\"  \"My stick!\"  \"Well, well, we shall be strong enough.  'Thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just.'  We simply can't afford to wait for the police or to keep within the four corners of the law.  You can drive off, cabby. Now, Watson, we'll just take our luck together, as we have occasionally in the past.\"  He had rung loudly at the door of a great dark house in the centre of Poultney Square.  It was opened immediately, and the figure of a tall woman was outlined against the dim-lit hall.  \"Well, what do you want?\" she asked sharply, peering at us through the darkness.  \"I want to speak to Dr. Shlessinger,\" said Holmes.  \"There is no such person here,\" she answered, and tried to close the door, but Holmes had jammed it with his foot.  \"Well, I want to see the man who lives here, whatever he may call himself,\" said Holmes firmly.  She hesitated.  Then she threw open the door.  \"Well, come in!\" said she.  \"My husband is not afraid to face any man in the world.\"  She closed the door behind us and showed us into a sitting-room on the right side of the hall, turning up the gas as she left us.  \"Mr. Peters will be with you in an instant,\" she said.  Her words were literally true, for we had hardly time to look around the dusty and moth-eaten apartment in which we found ourselves before the door opened and a big, clean-shaven bald-headed man stepped lightly into the room.  He had a large red face, with pendulous cheeks, and a general air of superficial benevolence which was marred by a cruel, vicious mouth.  \"There is surely some mistake here, gentlemen,\" he said in an unctuous, make-everything-easy voice.  \"I fancy that"]]]
