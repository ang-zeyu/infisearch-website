He didn't bother to speak.  The Guesser was trembling as he walked on in--partly in anger, partly in fear. It seemed ridiculous that one glance had not told the guard that he was not a Class Six. The Guesser was quite certain that he didn't _look_ like a Sixer. But then, Fives were not very perceptive people, anyway.  The Guesser went on walking into the complex corridors of the lower part of the building, following directions that had been given him by Deyla. There was no hesitation on his part; his memory for things like that was as near perfect as any record of the past can be. He knew her instructions well enough to have navigated the building in the dark.  Again, The Guesser found himself vaguely perturbed by the relative freedom of Sixers. As long as they got their jobs done there was almost no checking as to how they spent their time. Well, actually, the jobs to which they were suited were rather trivial--some of them were actually \"made work.\" After all, in a well-run society, it was axiomatic that everyone have basic job security; that's what kept everyone happy.  Of course, there were plenty of Sixers working in construction and on farms who were kept on their toes by overseers, but cleaning jobs and such didn't need such supervision. A thing can only be so clean; there's no quota to fill and exceed.  After several minutes of walking and climbing stairs--Sixers did not use lift chutes or drop chutes--he found the room where Deyla had told him to meet her. It was a small storeroom containing cleaning tools and supplies. She was waiting for him.  And, now that the time had actually come for them to act on her plan, fear showed on her face. The Guesser knew then that he had been right in his decision. But he said nothing about that yet.  \"Now are you certain about the destination?\" he asked before she could speak.  She nodded nervously. \"Yes, yes. D'Graski's Planet. That's what he say.\"  \"Good.\" The Guesser had waited for three weeks for this day, but he had known it would come eventually. D'Graski's Planet was the nearest repair base; sooner or later, another ship had to make that as a port of call from Viornis. He had told Deyla that the route to D'Graski's was the one most likely to be attacked by Misfit ships, that she would have to wait until a ship bound for there landed at the spaceport before the two of them could carry out their plan. And now the ship was here.  \"What's the name of the ship?\" he asked.  \"Th-the _Trobwell_.\"  \"What's the matter with you?\" he asked, suddenly and harshly.  She shivered. \"Scared. Awful scared.\"  \"I thought so. Have you got the clothing?\"  \"Y-yes.\" Then she broke down completely. \"You got to help me! You got to show me how to act like Exec lady! Show me how to talk! Otherwise, we both get caught!\"  He shook her to quiet her. \"Shut up!\" When she had quieted, he said: \"You are right, of course; we'd both be caught if you were to slip up. But I'm afraid it's too late to teach you now. It's always been too late.\"  \"Wha-what ... what you mean?\"  \"Never mind. Where's the traveling case?\"  She pointed silently towards a shelf, one of many that lined the room.  The Guesser went over and pulled out a box of cleaning dust-filters. Behind it was a gold-and-blue traveling case. The girl had spent months stealing the little things inside it, bit by bit, long before The Guesser had come into her life, dreaming of the day when she would become an Exec lady. Not until he had come had she tried to project that dream into reality.  The Guesser thumbed the opener, and the traveling case split into halves. The sight of the golden uniform of a Class One Executive gleamed among the women's clothing. And she had forgotten no detail; the expensive beamgun and holster lay beneath the uniform.  He picked it up carefully, almost reverently. It was the first time he'd held one since he'd been beamed down himself, so long ago. He turned the intensity knob down to the \"stun\" position.  \"We going to put them on _here_?\" she asked in a hushed voice. \"Just walk out? Me, I scared!\"  He stood up, the stun gun in his hand, its muzzle pointed toward the floor. \"Let me tell you something,\" he said, keeping his voice as kindly as he could. \"Maybe it will keep you out of further trouble. You could never pass as an Exec. Never. It wouldn't matter how long you tried to practice, you simply couldn't do it. Your mind is incapable of it. Your every word, your every mannerism, would be a dead giveaway.\"  There was shock slowly coming over her face. \"You not going to take me,\" she said, in her soft, flat voice.  \"No.\"  \"How I ever going to get to Misfits? How?\" There were tears in her eyes, just beginning to fill the lower lids.  \"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"but I'm afraid your idealized Misfits just don't exist. The whole idea is ridiculous. Their insane attacks on us show that they have unstable, warped minds--and don't tell me about machine-operated or robot-controlled ships. You don't build a machine to do a job when a human being is cheaper. Your fanciful Misfit nation would have dissolved long ago if it had tried to operate on the principle that a lower-class human is worth more than a machine.  \"You'll be better off here, doing your job; there are no such havens as Classless Misfit societies.\"  She was shaking her head as he spoke, trying to fight away the words that were shattering her cherished dream. And the words were having their effect because she believed him, because he believed himself.  \"No,\" she was saying softly. \"No, no, no.\"  The Guesser brought up the gun muzzle and shot her where she stood.         *       *       *       *       *  Half an hour later, The Guesser was fighting down his own fear. He was hard put to do it, but he managed to stride purposefully across the great spacefield toward the towering bulk of the _Trobwell_ without betraying that fear.  If they caught him now--  He closed his mind against the thought and kept on walking.  At the base of the landing cradle, a Class Four guard was standing stolidly. He bowed his head and saluted as The Guesser walked by.  _It's so easy!_ The Guesser thought. _So incredibly easy!_  Even the captain of the ship would only be a Class Two Exec. No one would question him--no one would _dare_ to.  A lieutenant looked up, startled as he entered the ship itself, and saluted hurriedly.  \"It's an honor to have you aboard, great sir,\" he said apologetically, \"but you realize, of course, that we are taking off in a very few minutes.\"  Words choked suddenly in the Guesser's throat, and he had to swallow hard before he could speak. \"I know that. I'm ... I'm going with you.\"  The lieutenant's eyes widened a trifle. \"No orders have been taped to that effect, great sir.\"  _This is it!_ thought The Guesser. He would either put it over now or he'd be lost--completely.  He scowled. \"Then tape them! I will apologize to the captain about this last-minute change, but I want no delay in take-off. It is absolutely vital that I reach D'Graski's Planet quickly!\"  The lieutenant blanched a little. \"Sorry, great sir! I'll see that the orders are taped. You wish a cabin?\"  \"Certainly. I presume you have an adequate one?\"  \"I'm sure we do, great sir; I'll have the Quarters Officer set one up for you immediately.\"  \"Excellent,\" said The Guesser. \"Excellent.\"  Fifteen minutes later, the _Trobwell_ lifted from the planet exactly on schedule. The Guesser, in his assigned room, breathed a deep sigh of relief. He was on his way to D'Graski's Planet at last!         *       *       *       *       *  \"Tell me, great sir,\" said the captain, \"what do you think the final decision on this case should be?\" He shoved the sheaf of papers across the desk to The Guesser.  The Guesser looked at them unseeingly, his mind in a whirl. For five days now, the captain of the _Trobwell_ had been handing him papers and asking him questions of that sort. And, since he was the ranking Exec, he was expected to give some sort of answer.  This one seemed even more complex than the others, and none of them had been simple. He forced his eyes to read the print, forced his mind to absorb the facts.  These were not clear-cut problems of the kind he had been dealing with all his life. Computing an orbit mentally was utterly simple compared with these fantastic problems.  It was a question of a choice of three different types of cargoes, to be carried to three different destinations. Which would be the best choice? The most profitable from an energy standpoint, as far as the ship was concerned, considering the relative values of the cargoes? What about relative spoilage rates as compared with fluctuating markets?  The figures were all there, right before him in plain type. But they meant nothing. Often, he had been unable to see how there was any difference between one alternative and another.  Once, he had been handed the transcripts of a trial on ship, during which two conflicting stories of an incident had been told by witnesses, and a third by the defendant. How could one judge on something like that? And yet he had been asked to.  He bit his lower lip in nervousness, and then stopped immediately as he realized that this was no time to display nerves.  \"I should say that Plan B was the best choice,\" he said at last. It was a wild stab at nothing, he realized, and yet he could do no better. Had he made a mistake?  The captain nodded gravely. \"Thank you, great sir. You've been most helpful. The making of decisions is too important to permit of its being considered lightly.\"  The Guesser could take it no longer. \"It was a pleasure to be of assistance,\" he said as he stood up, \"but there are certain of my own papers to be gone over before we reach D'Graski's Planet. I trust I shall be able to finish them.\"  The captain stood up quickly. \"Oh, certainly, great sir. I hope I haven't troubled you with my rather minor problems. I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24005"],["title","But, I Don't Think (#6)"],["body","n't disturb you again during the remainder of the trip.\"  The Guesser thanked him and headed for his cabin. He lay on his bed for hours with a splitting headache. If it weren't for the fact that he had been forced to go about it this way, he would never have tried to impersonate an Executive. Never!  He wasn't even sure he could carry it off for the rest of the trip.  Somehow, he managed to do it. He kept to himself and pretended that the blue traveling bag held important papers for him to work on, but he dreaded mealtimes, when he was forced to sit with the captain and two lieutenants, chattering like monkeys as they ate. And he'd had to talk, too; being silent might ruin the impression he had made.  He hated it. A mouth was built for talking and eating, granted--but not at the same time. Of course, the Execs had it down to a fine art; they had a great deal more time for their meals than a Class Three, and they managed to eat a few bites while someone else was talking, then talk while the other ate. It was disconcerting and The Guesser never completely got the hang of co-ordinating the two.  Evidently, however, none of the three officers noticed it.  By the time the _Trobwell_ reached D'Graski's Planet, he was actually physically ill from the strain. One of the worst times had come during an attack by Misfit ships. He had remained prone on his bed, his mind tensing at each change of acceleration in the ship. Without the screens and computer to give him data, he couldn't Guess, and yet he kept trying; he couldn't stop himself. What made it worse was the knowledge that his Guesses were coming out wrong almost every time.  When the ship finally settled into the repair cradle, The Guesser could hardly keep his hands from shaking. He left the ship feeling broken and old. But as his feet touched the ground, he thought to himself: _I made it! In spite of everything, I made it!_  And then two men walked toward him--two men wearing blue uniforms of a ship's Disciplinary Corps. He not only recognized their faces, but he saw the neat embroidery on the lapels.  It said: _Naipor_.     IV   Space Captain Humbolt Reed, commander of the _Naipor_, looked at his Master Guesser and shook his head. \"I ought to have you shot. Declassification is too good for you by far. Impersonating an Executive! How did you ever think you'd get away with it?\" He paused, then barked: \"Come on! Explain!\"  \"It was the only way I could think of to get back to the _Naipor_, great sir,\" said The Guesser weakly.  The captain leaned back slowly in his seat. \"Well, there's one extenuating circumstance. The officers of the _Trobwell_ reported that you were a fine source of amusement during the trip. They enjoyed your clownish performance very much.  \"Now, tell me exactly why you didn't show up for take-off on Viornis.\"  The Guesser explained what had happened, his voice low. He told about having something thrown at him, about the beamgun being fired at him. He told about the girl, Deyla. He told everything in a monotonous undertone.  The captain nodded when he was through. \"That tallies. It fits with the confession we got.\"  \"Confession, sir?\" The Guesser looked blank.  Captain Reed sighed. \"You're supposed to be a Guesser. Tell me, do you think I personally, could beam you from behind?\"  \"You're the captain, sir.\"  \"I don't mean for disciplinary purposes,\" the captain growled. \"I mean from ambush.\"  \"Well ... no, sir. As soon as I knew you were there, I'd be able to Guess where you'd fire. And I wouldn't be there.\"  \"Then what kind of person would be able to throw something at you so that you'd Guess, so that you'd dodge, and be so preoccupied with that first dodging that you'd miss the Guess on the aiming of the beamgun because of sheer physical inertia? What kind of person would know exactly where you'd be when you dodged? What kind of person would know exactly where to aim that beamgun?\"  The Guesser had seen what was coming long before the captain finished his wordy interrogation.  \"Another Guesser, sir,\" he said. His eyes narrowed.  \"Exactly,\" said Captain Reed. \"Your apprentice, Kraybo. He broke down during a Misfit attack on the way here; he was never cut out to be a Master Guesser, and even though he tried to kill you to get the job, he couldn't handle it. He cracked completely as soon as he tried to co-ordinate alone. We've actually missed you, Master Guesser.\"  \"May I see to the disciplining of Kraybo, sir?\" The Guesser asked coldly.  \"You're too late. He's been declassified.\" The captain looked down at the papers on his desk. \"You may consider yourself reinstated, Master Guesser, since the fault was not yours.  \"However, masquerading as an Exec, no matter how worthy your motives, cannot be allowed to go unpunished. You will report to the Discipline Master for a three-and-three every day for the next five days. And you will not be allowed to leave the ship during the time we remain in repair dock. Dismissed.\"  \"Thank you, great sir.\" The Guesser turned on his heel and marched out, heading for the Discipline Master.  It was good to be home again."]]]
