It's not over-light here, sur; mind yer feet as ye go, an' pay attintion to your head, for what betune holes in the floor an' beams in the ceilin', tall gintlemen like you, sur, come to grief sometimes.\"  Thanking the figure for its civility, Mr Hazlit knocked at the door indicated, but there was no response.  \"Sure it's out they are!\" cried the figure from the other end of the passage.  \"Joe Baldwin's layin' a charge under the wreck off the jetty to-day--no doubt that's what's kep' 'im, and it's washin'-day with Mrs Joe, I belave; but I'm his pardner, sur, an' if ye'll step this way, Mrs Machowl'll be only too glad to see ye, sur, an' I can take yer orders.\"  Not a little amused by this free-and-easy invitation, Mr Hazlit entered a small apartment, which surprised him by its clean and tidy appearance. A pretty little Irishwoman, with a pert little turned-up nose, auburn hair so luxuriant that it _could_ not be kept in order, and a set of teeth that glistened in their purity, invited him to sit down, and wiped a chair with her apron for his accommodation.  \"You've got a nice little place here,\" remarked the visitor, looking round him.  \"Troth, sur, ye wouldn't have said that if you'd seen it whin we first came to it.  Of all the dirty places I iver saw!  I belave an Irish pig would have scunnered at it, an' held his nose till he got out.  It's very well for England, but we was used to cleaner places in the owld country.  Hows'iver we've got it made respictable now, and we're not hard to plaze.\"  This was a crushing reply.  It upset Mr Hazlit's preconceived ideas regarding the two countries so completely that he was perplexed.  Not being a man of rapid thought he changed the subject:--  \"You are a diver, you say?\"  \"I am, sur.\"  \"And Mr Baldwin's partner--if I understand you correctly?\"  \"Well, we work together--whin we're not workin' apart--pritty regular. He took in hand to train me some months gone by, an' as our two missusses has took a fancy to aich other, we're likely to hold on for some time--barrin' accidents, av coorse.\"  \"Well, then,\" said Mr Hazlit, \"I came to see Mr Baldwin about a vessel of mine, which was wrecked a few days ago on the coast of Wales--\"  \"Och!  The _Seagull_ it is,\" exclaimed Rooney.  \"The same; and as it is a matter of importance that I should have the wreck visited without delay, I shall be obliged by your sending your partner to my house this evening.\"  Rooney promised to send Baldwin up, and took his wife Molly to witness, with much solemnity, that he would not lose a single minute.  Thereafter the conversation became general, and at last the merchant left the place much shaken in his previous opinion of Irish character, and deeply impressed with the sagacity of Rooney Machowl.  The result of this visit was that Baldwin was engaged to dive for the cargo of the _Seagull_, and found himself, a few days later, busy at work on the Welsh coast with a staff of men under him, among whom were our friends Rooney Machowl and surly David Maxwell.  The latter had at first declined to have anything to do with the job, but, on consideration of the wages, he changed his mind.    CHAPTER FIVE.  TREATS OF PLOTS AND PLANS, ENGINEERING AND OTHERWISE.  The spot where the wreck of the _Seagull_ lay was a peaceful sequestered cove or bay on the coast of Anglesea.  The general aspect of the neighbouring land was bleak.  There were no trees, and few bushes. Indeed, the spire of a solitary little church on an adjoining hill was the most prominent object in the scene.  The parsonage belonging to it was concealed by a rise in the ground, and the very small hamlet connected with it was hid like a rabbit in the clefts of some rugged cliffs.  The little church was one of those temples which are meant to meet the wants of a rural district, and which cause a feeling of surprise in the minds of town visitors as to where the congregation can come from that fills them.  But, bleak though the country was, the immediate shore was interesting and romantic in its form.  In one place perpendicular cliffs, cut up by ragged gorges, descended sheer down into deep water, and meeting the constant roll of the Irish Channel, even in calm weather, fringed themselves with lace-work of foam, as if in cool defiance of the ocean. In another place a mass of boulders and shattered rocks stretched out into the sea as if still resistant though for the time subdued. Elsewhere a half-moon of yellow sand received the ripples with a kiss, suggestive of utter conquest and the end of strife.  As we have said, the spot was peaceful, for, at the time to which we refer, ocean and air were still, but ah!  Those who have not dwelt near the great deep and beheld its fury when roused can form but a faint conception of the scene that occurred there on the night in which the _Seagull_ went down!  Mr Hazlit thought of the place as something like the region of a \"bad debt,\"--where a portion of his wealth had been wrecked.  Some knew it as the hated spot where they had suffered the loss of all their fortune; but others there were, who, untouched by the thought of material gain or loss, knew it as the scene of the wreck of all their earthly hopes--for the _Seagull_ had been a passenger-ship, and in that quiet bay God in His providence had dealt some of the most awful blows that human beings are capable of bearing.  Close to a bald cliff on the northern shore the foretopmast of the wreck rose a few feet above the calm water.  In a cove of the cliff the remains of a mast or yard lay parallel with a deep and thick mass of wreckage, which had surged out and into that cove on the fatal night with such violence that it now lay in small pieces, like giant matchwood.  On a patch of gravel not far from that cliff a husband and father had wandered for many days, after being saved--he knew not how-- gazing wistfully, hopelessly at the sea which had swallowed up wife and children and fortune.  He had been a \"successful\" gold-digger!  On that patch of gravel scenes of terrible suspense had been enacted.  Expectant ones had come to inquire whether those whom they sought had _really_ embarked in that vessel, while grave and sympathetic but worn-out or weary men of the Coast-guard, stood ready to give information or to defend the wreck.  In the church on the hill there were dreadful marks on the floor, where the recovered bodies had lain for a time, while frantic relations came and went day by day to search for and claim their dead.  Ah, reader, we are not mocking you with fiction.  What we refer to is fact.  We saw it with our eyes.  Peaceful though that spot looked--and often looks--it was once the scene of the wildest of storms, the most terrible of mercantile disasters, and the deepest of human woe.  But we are mingling thoughts with memories.  The wreck which has crept into our mind is that of the _Royal Charter_.  The _Seagull_, although a passenger-ship, and wrecked near the same region, does not resemble _that_!  At the time of which we write, Joe Baldwin and his men had already saved a considerable portion of the cargo, but during his submarine explorations and meditations Joe had conceived the idea that there was some possibility of saving the vessel itself, for, having recoiled from its first shock and sunk in deep water, the hull was comparatively uninjured.  But Joe, although a good diver, was not a practical engineer.  He knew himself to be not a very good judge of such matters, and was too modest to suggest anything to competent submarine engineers.  He could not, however, help casting the thing about in his mind for some time.  At last, one evening while reading a newspaper that had been got from a passing boat, he observed the return of the ship in which his young friend Edgar Berrington had gone to India.  At once he wrote the following letter:--    \"My dear Mister Edgar,--I'm in a fix here.  It's my opinion there's a   chance of savin' a wreck if only good brains was set to work to do it.   It would pay if we was to succeed.  If you happen to be on the loose   just now, as is likely, run over an' see what you think of it.--Yours   to command,    \"J.B.\"  Our hero received the letter, at once acted on it, and in a few days was on the spot.  \"What a change there is in you, my dear sir!\" said Joe, looking with admiration at the browned, stalwart youth before him; \"why, you've grown moustaches!\"  \"I couldn't help it, Joe,\" replied Edgar; \"they _would_ come, and I had no time to shave on board.--But now, tell me about this wreck.\"  When Edgar heard that the vessel belonged to Mr Hazlit his first impulse was to have nothing to do with it.  He felt that any interference in regard to it would seem like a desire to thrust himself before the merchant's notice--and that, too, in a needy manner, as if he sought employment at his hands; but on consideration he came to the conclusion that he might act as a wire-puller, give Baldwin the benefit of his knowledge, and allow him to reap the credit and the emoluments. But for a long time the honest diver would not listen to such a suggestion, and was only constrained to give in at last when Edgar threatened to leave him altogether.  \"By the way, have you seen Miss Aileen since you came home?\" asked Baldwin, while the two friends were seated in the cabin of the diver's vessel poring, pencil in hand, over several sheets of paper on which were sundry mysterious designs.  \"No; I was on the point of paying a visit to my good aunt Miss Pritty, with ulterior ends in view, when your letter reached me and brought me here.  To say truth, your note arrived very opportunely, for I was engaged at the time in rather a hard struggle between inclination and duty--not feeling quite sure whether it was right or wise to throw myself in her way just now, for, as you may easily believe, I have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23494"],["title","Notable Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold (#0)"],["body","Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold, by W.H.G.

It is not too terse, and not too profuse, just right to capture your interest and hold it.  It was interesting, too, to be told the real story of Alexander Selkirk, the original of the famous \"Robinson Crusoe\" book.  The story of some of the adventurers who looked for the North-West passage were most interesting, as well.  There are over 100 illustrations, though a few of them are just little thumb-nail icon-sized images placed at the ends of chapters.

In the year 1486 a council of learned professors of geography, mathematics, and all branches of science, erudite friars, accomplished bishops, and other dignitaries of the Church, were seated in the vast arched hall of the old Dominican convent of Saint Stephen in Salamanca, then the great seat of learning in Spain.  They had met to hear a simple mariner, then standing in their midst, propound and defend certain conclusions at which he had arrived regarding the form and geography of the earth, and the possibility, nay, the certainty, that by sailing west, the unknown shores of Eastern India could be reached.  Some of his hearers declared it to be grossly presumptuous in an ordinary man to suppose, after so many profound philosophers and mathematicians had been studying the world, and so many able navigators had been sailing about it for years past, that there remained so vast a discovery for him to make.  Some cited the books of the Old Testament to prove that he was wrong, others the explanations of various reverend commentators. Doctrinal points were mixed up with philosophical discussions, and a mathematical demonstration was allowed no weight if it appeared to clash with a text of Scripture or comment of one of the fathers.  Although Pliny and the wisest of the ancients had maintained the possibility of an antipodes in the southern hemisphere, these learned gentlemen made out that it was altogether a novel theory.  Others declared that to assert there were inhabited lands on the opposite side of the globe would be to maintain that there were nations not descended from Adam, as it would have been impossible for them to have passed the intervening ocean, and therefore discredit would be thrown on the Bible.  Again, some of the council more versed in science, though admitting the globular form of the earth, and the possibility of an opposite habitable hemisphere, maintained that it would be impossible to arrive there on account of the insupportable heat of the torrid zone; besides which, if the circumference of the earth was as great as they supposed, it would require three years to make the voyage.  Several, with still greater absurdity, advanced as an objection that should a ship succeed in reaching the extremity of India, she could never get back again, as the rotundity of the globe would present a kind of mountain up which it would be impossible for her to sail even with the most favourable wind.  The mariner replied in answer to the scriptural objection that the inspired writers were not speaking technically as cosmographers, but figuratively, in language addressed to all comprehensions, and that the commentaries of the fathers were not to be considered as philosophical propoundings, which it was necessary either to admit or refute.  In regard to the impossibility of passing the torrid zone, he himself stated that he had voyaged as far as Guinea under the equinoxial line, and had found that region not only traversable, but abounding in population, fruits, and pasturage.  Who was this simple mariner who could thus dare to differ from so many learned sages?  His person was commanding; his demeanour elevated; his eye kindling; his manner that of one who had a right to be heard, while a rich flow of eloquence carried his hearers with him.  His countenance was handsome; his hair already blanched by thought, toil, and privation.  He was no other than Columbus, who, after his proposals had been rejected by the Court of Portugal, had addressed himself to that of Spain, and had, year after year, waited patiently to obtain a hearing from Ferdinand and Isabella, then occupied in their wars against the Moors.  He had been a seaman from the age of fourteen.  He was born in the city of Genoa about the year 1435, where his father, Dominico Colombo, carried on the business of a wool comber, which his ancestors had followed for several generations.  He was the eldest of three brothers, the others being Bartholomew and Diego.  He had at an early age evinced a desire for the sea, and accordingly his education had been mainly directed to fit him for maritime life.  His first voyages were made with a distant relative named Colombo, a hardy veteran of the seas, who had risen to some distinction by his bravery.  Under this relative young Christopher saw much service, both warlike and in trading voyages, until he gained command of a war ship of good size. When serving in the squadron of his cousin information was brought that four richly-laden Venetian galleys were on their return voyage from Flanders.  The squadron lay in wait for them off the Portuguese coast, between Lisbon and Cape Saint Vincent.  A desperate engagement ensued; the vessels grappled each other.  That commanded by Columbus was engaged with a huge Venetian galley.  Hand-grenades and other fiery missiles were thrown on board her, and the galley was wrapped in flames.  So closely were the vessels fastened together, that both were involved in one conflagration.  The crews threw themselves into the sea.  Columbus seized an oar, and being an expert swimmer, reached the shore, though fully two leagues distant.  On recovering he made his way to Lisbon. Possibly he may have resided there previously; certain it is that he there married a lady, the daughter of a distinguished navigator, from whose widow he obtained much information regarding the voyages and expeditions of her late husband, as well as from his papers, charts, journals, and memoranda.  Having become naturalised in Portugal, he sailed occasionally on voyages to the coast of Guinea, and when on shore supported his family by making maps and charts, which in those days required a degree of knowledge and experience sufficient to entitle the possessor to distinction.  He associated with various navigators, and he noted down all he heard. It was said by some that islands had been seen far away to the west when they had been driven in that direction.  Whatever credit might have been given to these reports by Columbus, he had far stronger reasons for believing that, by sailing across the ocean to the west, he should reach land.  He was of opinion that about one-third of the circumference of the earth was unknown and unexplored.  A great portion of this might be filled up by the eastern regions of Asia, while the tract of water intervening between these countries might be less than at first supposed.  In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, two great travellers, Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville, journeyed eastward over a large portion of Asia, and had given vivid descriptions of the magnificence of its cities and scenery.  Marco Polo especially had described two large islands, Ontilla and Cipango, the latter undoubtedly Japan, which it was expected would be the first reached by a navigator sailing westward.  A Portuguese pilot, Martin Vicenti, after sailing four hundred and fifty-two leagues to the west of Cape Saint Vincent, had found a piece of carved wood evidently laboured with an iron instrument, and as probably the wind had drifted it from the west, it might have come from some unknown land in that direction.  A brother-in-law of Columbus had likewise found a similar piece of wood drifted from the same quarter. Reeds of enormous size, such as were described by Ptolemy to grow in India, had been picked up, and trunks of huge pine-trees had been driven on the shores of the Azores, such as did not grow on any of those islands.  The bodies of two dead men, whose features differed from those of any known race of people, had been cast on the island of Flores. There were islands, it was rumoured, still farther west than those visited, and a mariner sailing from Port Saint Mary to Ireland asserted that he had seen land to the west, which the ship's"]]]
