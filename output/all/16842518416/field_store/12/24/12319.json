No need with this particular regiment to suggest rebuilding the broken-in trench; it would be done automatically--which cannot be said of them all.  At last he reached Boyau 94, and turned up towards the firing-line. Twenty yards from the turn a mass of barbed wire crossed the trench above his head, the barbed wire which ran in front of the support line.  For it is not only the fire-trench that is wired--each line behind is plentifully supplied with this beautiful vegetable growth.  The mist had cleared away, and the morning sun was blazing down from a cloudless sky, as he reached the front trench.  Just to his left a monstrous pair of bellows, slowly heaving up and down under the ministrations of two pessimistic miners, sent a little of God's fresh air down to the men in the mine-shafts underneath.  The moles were there--the moles who scratched and scraped stolidly, at the end of their gallery thirty or forty yards in front, deep down under the earth in No Man's Land.  A steady stream of sandbags filled with the result of their labours came up the shaft down which the pipe from the bellows stretched into the darkness--sandbags which must be taken somewhere and emptied, or used to revet a bit of trench which needed repair.  To right and left there stretched the fire-trench--twisting and turning, traversed and recessed--just one small bit of the edge of British land. A hundred yards away, a similar line stretched right and left, where other pessimistic miners ministered to other monstrous bellows, and Piccadilly was known as Unter den Linden.  The strange stagnation of it all!  Look through the periscope at the country in front.  Not a sign of life in the torn-up crusted earth; not a movement between the two long lines of wire.  A few poppies here and there, and at one point a motionless grey-green lump close to the farther wire.  Impossible to tell exactly what it is from the periscope--the range is too far.  But, in No Man's Land, such strange grey--and khaki--lumps may often be seen.  The night, a wiring party, perhaps a little raid or an officer's patrol, and--discovery.  You cannot always get your dead back to the trench, and the laws that govern No Man's Land savour of the primitive. . . .  The Sapper watched the phlegmatic bellows-heaver for a few moments curiously.  His stoical indifference to any one or anything save the job in hand, the wonderful accuracy with which he spat from time to time, the appalling fumes from his short clay pipe, all tended to make of him an interesting study.  Supremely apathetic to friend or foe, Generals or Huns, he did his shift without comment and, as far as could be seen, without thought.  \"Where are you putting the earth?\" asked the Sapper after watching for a while.  \"Round corner, in a 'ole.\"  The speaker pointed with his pipe, and the subject dropped.  The officer turned away smiling slightly, and decided on the inspection of the rum jar.  The answer was clear and succinct, even if not couched in the language of the old army discipline.  He inspected the hole, and, finding it was at the back of the trench, in a crater that was formed nightly by German _minenwerfer_, and that more earth there not only would not block the trench but, _mirabile dicta_, would be an actual advantage, he passed on and shortly came to a passage leading out of the front of the trench.  The passage was labelled Sap No. 130, and presented exactly the same appearance as the boyaux which ran out of the support line to the front trench.  Only when one got into it did the difference become apparent, for whereas the boyaux had continued until finally opening into a new trench, the sap was a cul-de-sac, and finished abruptly in a little covered-in recess built into a miniature mountain of newly-thrown-up earth.  And this great, tumbled mass of soil was the near lip of Vesuvius crater--blown up half way between the two front lines.  Over the top of the mountain there was no passage.  A man standing or crawling there in daytime would have been in full view of German snipers at a range of forty yards; while had he accomplished it in safety, he would have slithered down the farther side into a great cavity shaped like an egg-cup, at the bottom of which a pool of dirty, stagnant water was slowly forming.  Moreover, if we imagine the man continuing his journey and climbing up the other side, he would run the gauntlet of the English snipers as he topped the farther lip, before reaching the German sap which ran out in just such a similar cul-de-sac to the one already described.  Thus are craters consolidated; each side holds the lip nearest to them, and hurls curses and bombs at his opponents on the other.  The distance between the sapheads is perhaps twenty or twenty-five yards, instead of the hundred odd of the parent fire-trenches; and any closer acquaintanceship is barred by the egg-cup crater, which stretches between them.  \"Keep down, sir--well down.  Lot of sniping to-day.\"  A sergeant of the South Loamshires whispered hoarsely to the Sapper as he reached the end of the sap--it is etiquette to whisper in a sap.  Three men inside the recess were drinking tea with the calmness born of long custom, while lying on his side, with a periscope to his eye, was Jackson, the subaltern.  \"Anything fresh, Jacko?\" muttered the Sapper, crouching down beside him.  \"Yes--I think they're coming closer with their left sap round the crater. Their periscope seems to be nearer than it was yesterday.\"  \"Let's have a look.\"  The two changed position, and the Captain turned the periscope gently round until he got the exact direction.  Absolute stillness brooded over the ground he could see; a few rough strands of wire straggled about, and disappeared into the great mound of earth that formed the _d√©bris_ of the crater.  There were the enemies' trenches--a railway embankment behind them with a derelict row of trucks--a great chimney, gaunt and desolate, with the buildings at its foot in ruins.  But it was not on these old friends that he was concentrating; his target was the bit of ground just in front of him that lay close to the thrown-up earth of Vesuvius, along which the German sap was reputed to be creeping nearer.  At last he got what he wanted.  Close at hand, perhaps twenty yards away, there stuck up out of the ground a motionless stick with something on the end--the German's periscope.  Now it is reputed to be a fact by several people of apparent truthfulness that it is possible, in circumstances such as these, for each watcher to see the other man's eyes reflected from the mirrors of the periscopes; and it is an undoubted fact that the laws which govern the refraction of light would allow of this phenomenon. Personally, I am glad to say I have never seen a German's eye through a periscope; but then personally I am inclined to doubt if any one has.  It must be quite dreadful to see a thing like a poached egg regarding you balefully from the top of a stick a few yards away.  At last the Sapper got up.  \"He's no nearer, Jacko.  What do you think, sergeant?\"  \"I don't think they were working last night, sir,\" one of the tea-drinkers answered.  \"There was a party of 'em out, and we bunged some bombs.  We 'eard 'em padding the 'oof back.\"  \"Been pretty quiet, then?\"  \"Except for that there rum jar, sir,\" answered the sergeant.  \"We thought we was napoo[1] when we 'eard that little bundle of fun a-coming.\"  \"Have you seen it, Jacko?\"  \"Yes, it rolled into the sap, and I've had it put into the fire-trench. I'm taking it back to blow it up.  I think it's a percussion fuse, but it seems fairly safe.  I've sent for a stretcher to carry it on.\"  \"Let's go and have a look at it.\"  The two officers walked down the sap and back into the trench, and started to investigate with a professional eye the object lying on the fire-step.  Apparently of steel, and painted a dull grey, it looked harmless enough--but all those little love offerings of the Hun are treated with respect.  About the size of an ordinary rum jar, with a fuse of sorts in place of a neck, it was at the time an unknown brand of abomination, to them at any rate.  \"It differs only in appearance, I fear,\" remarked the Captain, after inspecting it gingerly, \"from other presents they give us.  Its object is undoubtedly nefarious.  Where do you propose to blow it up?\"  \"In that little quarry near the Ritz.  Will that do all right?\"  \"Most excellently.\"  With a smile he looked at his watch.  \"Just set your watch by mine, Jacko--and poop it off at 10.5 ak emma.  Do you take me?\"  The other looked puzzled for a moment; then his face cleared.  \"I'd forgotten for the moment that Centre Battalion Head-quarters was not far from the quarry,\" he grinned.  \"Sir--I take you.\"  \"My dear boy, the day is hot, and the Pumpkin is fat, and the flies are glutinous.  He doesn't want to see the trenches any more than I do--and one's mission in life is to anticipate the wishes of the great.\"  It was just as he finished speaking that from up the line in the direction of the Haymarket there came four dull, vicious cracks in succession, and some clouds of black smoke drifted slowly over his head.  \"Just about No. 7 T.M. emplacement,\" he muttered to himself.  \"I hope to heavens . . .\"  \"Put it on the stretcher carefully, boys.\"  His subaltern was speaking to the two men who had arrived with a stretcher.  \"Have you got the slab of gun-cotton?\"  \"Corporal 'Amick 'as gone to get it at the store, sir.  He's a-going to meet us at the quarry.\"  \"Right-ho!  Walk march.\"  The cavalcade departed, and the Captain resumed his morning walk, while his thoughts wandered to the beer which is cold and light yellow.  For many weary months had he taken a similar constitutional daily; not always in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23875"],["title","The Relief of Mafeking (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

PREFACE     The proprietors of the _Manchester Guardian_ have kindly allowed me to make use of their copyright in the letters written by me to that newspaper during the first half of the year. The substance of the letters has been reproduced in the hope that home-staying folk may find in them something of the atmosphere that surrounds the collision of armed forces. It is a strange and rude atmosphere; yet it pleases me at this moment to remember not so much the strangeness and rudeness as the kindness and good-fellowship that made a dreadful business tolerable and the memory of it pleasant. Many friends of these brave days I may not see again, but if their eyes should ever light on this page I would have them know that it contains a greeting.

A four-wheeler clove its way through the crowd surrounding the gates, and the sentries presented arms to it. It contained my friend, the paymaster, who presently came upstairs carrying a bag in which were several hundred pounds sterling--the real sinews of war. This was the man whose business it was to call up the Reservists, and he had a very simple way of doing it. He had several books containing large forms divided by perforation into four parts. The first was a counterfoil on which was written the Reservist's name and the date of posting the order; the second was a railway warrant requesting the railway company to furnish him with a ticket available by the most direct route from his place of residence to the dep√¥t; the third was the order requiring him to present himself at the barracks on or before a certain date; and the fourth was a money-order for three shillings, officially called an advance, but virtually a present from a considerate Government. On the 11th of the month the paymaster at Bury had signed about six hundred of these notices, and had seen them posted; on Sunday and Monday they had begun to fall like bombs on the breakfast tables of prosperous civilians all over the country; and soon the pieces of blue paper had made a sad disturbance in several hundreds of cottage homes, and added several hundred men to the strength of the 2nd Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers. The business of the pay office, or at least my friend's part of it--a few subalterns rushing up in a hurry to get money for their various companies; eighty pounds for A, a hundred pounds for D, and so on--was soon over, and then he told me something of how the Reserve system works.  All the men in the Reserve have put in at least seven years' service. They go into the Reserve first for a term of five years at sixpence a day, and then (if they wish) for a term of four years at fourpence a day. Of course when the Reserves are called out they receive the same pay as regular soldiers, and their wives have separation allowances. As everyone knows, this was the first time that any considerable number of the Reserves had been called up, and the system has worked admirably. About 98 per cent, in some districts presented themselves, the small remainder being either ill or in gaol. A small proportion of those who came up were rejected by the doctor, but on the whole the men were tough and fit. In this district they were allowed eight days in which to settle their affairs and present themselves at the dep√¥t, but most of them did not come until the last minute, and several not until after the last minute of the time allowed by the order.  The crowd outside the barrack gates was composed chiefly of women and loafers, but every now and then it opened to admit a handful of reluctant-looking men, who had probably stayed outside until their money was exhausted. And many of them were hanging about outside the gates having nothing to do and no money to spend, but deferring to the last moment the final step of self-submission to the iron hand of discipline. For once the Reservist was inside the barrack yard he could have no more liberty, probably, for many a long month--unless, indeed, he gained an endless liberty on the battlefield. The scene through the opposite window looking on to the barrack yard was very different from the rather sombre picture without. The yard was gay with the wonderful red that has done so much to make the army popular. For movement there were a few squads of Militia recruits being drilled by the trumpet-voiced sergeants; and for music there was the ring of a hundred rifle-butts striking the ground together, the tramp and click of many feet, and the clatter of the colonel's horse as he rode across the yard.  But the most interesting people were the Reservists and their friends, who dotted the yard in many-coloured groups. Here was a party of girls and women taking a farewell of some engaging blade whose course of gallantry had been suddenly interrupted. There was a father standing with his wife and small family grouped round him, no one saying very much, but everyone feeling a good deal. And another group would be laughing and singing, not quite recovered from the means they had taken to drown regrets.  Sitting in the window, one could trace the Reservist's progress from his entrance at the gate to his disappearance into quarters. The square was filled with little processions containing six or eight men each; first from the orderly-room to the hospital, in all kinds of civilian raiment: black, grey, brown, green, blue, drab--anything but red; hatless, capless, black-hatted, cloth-capped, shabby, spruce, dirty, soiled, clean, pretty clean, white-faced, red-faced, unkempt, well-groomed, hungry, well-fed, thin, fat--every class between clerks and tramps; every condition between prosperity and destitution. A procession was also constantly flowing from the hospital to the quartermaster's stores--the same procession, with one military touch; for this time the men did not straggle, but were marched single file in charge of a sergeant. The next procession was from the stores to the men's quarters; but now each man had a great bundle under his arms containing his entire kit wrapped up in an overcoat.  The quartermaster, not without pardonable pride, took me over the stores in which the men's kits are prepared. There were"]]]
