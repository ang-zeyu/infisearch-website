She became friendly with a white woman named Ruth Pilgrim, and so Ruth's family got the benefit of it, and always had on the table many good things that came from the woods.  One day, long after the farms were cleared and doing well, the white woman said, \"See, Mother Monapini, thou hast shown me many things, now I have somewhat to show thee. There hath grown up in our wheat field a small herb that must have come from England with the wheat, for hitherto I have not seen it elsewhere. We call it lamb's-quarter, for the lamb doth eat it by choice. Or maybe because we do eat it with a quarter of lamb. Nevertheless it maketh a good pot-herb when boiled.\"  The old Indian woman's eyes were fixed on the new plant that was good to eat: and she said, \"Is it very good, oh white sister?\"  \"Yes, and our medicine men do say that it driveth out the poison that maketh itch and spots on the skin.\" After a moment Monapini said, \"It looketh to me like the foot of a wild goose.\"  \"Well found,\" chuckled Ruth, \"for sometimes our people do call it by that very name.\"  \"That tells me different,\" said the Indian.  \"What mean you,\" said Ruth.  \"Is not a goose foot very strong, so it never catcheth cold in the icy water?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And this hath the shape of a goose foot?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then my Shaman tells that it is by such likeness that the Great Spirit showeth the goose foot plant to be charged with the driving out of colds.\"  \"It may be so,\" said the white woman, \"but this I know. It is very good and helpeth the whole body.\"  The Indian picked a handful of the pot-herbs, then stared hard at the last; a very tall and strong one.  \"What hast thou now, Monapini?\" The red woman pointed to the stem of the lamb's-quarter, whereon were long red streaks, and said: \"This I see, that, even as the white-man's herb came over the sea and was harmless and clean while it was weak, but grew strong and possessed this field, then was streaked to midheight with blood, so also shall they be who brought it--streaked at last to the very waist with blood--not the white men's but the dark purple blood of the Indian. This the voices tell me is in the coming years, that this is what we shall get again for helping you--destruction in return for kindness. Mine inner eyes have seen it.\" She threw down the new pot-herb and glided away, to be seen no more in the settlements of the white men.  And Ruth, as she gazed after her, knew that it was true. Had she not heard her people talking and planning? For even as the weed seed came with the wheat, so evil spirits came with the God-fearing Pilgrims, and already these were planning to put the heathens to the sword, when the Colony was strong enough.  So the Indian woman read the truth in the little pot-herb that sailed and landed with the Pilgrims; that stands in our fields to this day, streaked with the blood of the passing race--standing, a thing of remembrance.   TALE 19  How the Red Clover Got the White Mark on Its Leaves  [Illustration: How the Red Clover Got the White Mark on Its Leaves]  Once upon a time a Bee, a Bug, and a Cow went marching up to Mother Carey's palace in the hemlock grove, to tell her of their troubles. They complained that food was poor and scarce, and they were tired of the kinds that grew along the roadsides.  Mother Carey heard them patiently, then she said: \"Yes, you have some reason to complain, so I will send you a new food called Clover. Its flower shall be full of honey for the Bee, its leaves full of cowfood and its cellar shall be stocked with tiny pudding bags of meal for the Bug, that is for good little Bug-folks who live underground.\"  Now the tribes of the Bee, the Bug, and the Cow had a fine time feasting, for the new food was everywhere.  But Cows are rather stupid you know. They found the new food so good that they kept on munching everything that had three round leaves, thinking it was Clover, and very soon a lot of them were poisoned with strange plants that no wise Cow would think of eating.  So Mother Carey called a Busy Brownie, and put him on guard to keep the Cows from eating the poison plants by mistake.  At first it was good fun, and the Brownie enjoyed it because it made him feel important. But he got very tired of his job and wanted to go to the ball game.  He sat down on a toadstool, and looked very glum. He could hear the other Brownies shouting at the game, and that made him feel worse. Then he heard a great uproar, and voices yelling \"A home run!\" \"A home run!\" That drove him wild. He had been whittling the edge of the toadstool with his knife, and now he slashed off a big piece of the cap, he was so mad.  Then up he got and said to the Cows: \"See here, you fool Cows, I can't stay here for ever trying to keep you from eating poison, but I'll do this much. I'll stamp all the good-to-eat leaves with a mark that will be your guide.\"  [Illustration: The Shamrock]  So he made a rubber stamp out of part of the toadstool he was sitting on, and stamped every Clover leaf in that pasture, so the Cows could be sure, then skipped away to the ball game.  When Mother Carey heard of his running away from his job, she was very angry. She said: \"Well, you Bad Brownie, you should be ashamed, but that white mark was a good idea so I'll forgive you, if you go round, and put it on every Clover leaf in the world.\"  He had to do it, though it looked like an endless task, and he never would have finished it, had not the other Brownies all over the world come to help him; so it was done at last. And that is the reason that every Clover leaf to-day has on it the white mark like an arrowhead, the Brownie sign for \"good-to eat.\"  The Cows get along better now, but still they are very stupid; they go munching ahead without thinking, and will even eat the blossoms which belong to the Bees. And the Bees have to buzz very loudly and even sting the Cows on their noses to keep them from stealing the bee-food. The good little Bugs underground have the best time, for there the Cows can not harm them, and the Bees never come near. They eat when they are hungry and sleep when they are cold, which is their idea of a good time; so except for some little quarrels between the Cows and the Bees they have all gotten along very well ever since.   TALE 20  The Shamrock and Her Three Sisters  [Illustration: Yellow-haired Hob. Shamrock's blonde sister]  The Shamrock is really the White Clover. It is much the same shape as the Red Clover, and has the same food bags in its cellar. It is just as good for Cows and even better for Bees; so the Brownie stamped all its leaves with the white arrow mark, as you can plainly see. This plant, as you know, is the emblem of Ireland.  The story-tellers say that St. Patrick was preaching to Leary, the heathen King of Tara in Ireland hoping to turn him into a Christian. The king listened attentively, but he was puzzled by St. Patrick's account of the Trinity. \"Stop,\" said the king. \"How can there be three Gods in one and only one God where there are three. That is impossible.\" St. Patrick stooped down and picking up a Shamrock leaf, said: \"See, there it is, growing in your own soil; there are three parts but only one leaf.\" The king was so much struck by this proof that he became a Christian and ever since the Shamrock has been the emblem of Ireland.  Now to fill out the history of the Clovers, I should tell you of the other three. The next is called Alsike, or the Pink Clover.  When you look at this Alsike or Alsatian Clover, you might think its mother was a red clover and its father a white one, for it is about half way between them in size, and its bloom is pink on the outside and white in the middle. Evidently, the Brownie didn't think much of it, for he did not put his arrow mark on its leaves. Still the Cows think it is good, the Bees think it is fine, and it always carried lots of food bags in its cellar. So also does the next sister--Melilot, the Yellow Clover or Honey-lotus--and the last and sweetest of them all, is the Sweet Clover that spreads sweet smells in the old-fashioned garden.   TALE 21  The Indian Basket-maker  [Illustration: The Indian Basket]  \"Come, little Nagami, my Bird-Singer, you are ten years old, it is time you learned to make baskets. I made my first when I was but eight,\" said Mother Akoko proudly, for she was the best basket-maker on the river.  So they took a sharp stick, and went into the woods. Akoko looked for spruce trees that had been blown down by the storm, but found none, so she stopped under some standing spruce, at a place with no underbrush and said: \"See, Nagami, here we dig for wattap.\"  The spruce roots or \"wattap\" were near the surface and easily found, but not easily got out, because they were long, tangled and criss-crossed. Yet, by pulling up, and cutting under, they soon got a bundle of roots like cords, and of different lengths, from two feet to a yard, or more.  \"Good,\" said Akoko; \"this is enough and we need not soak them, for it is summer, and the sap is running. If it were fall we should have to boil them. Now you must scrape them clear of the brown bark.\" So Nagami took her knife and worked for an hour, then came with the bundle saying: \"See, Mother, they are smooth, and so white that they have not a brown spot left.\" \"Good,\" said Akoko, \"now you need some bark of the willow for sewing cord. Let us look along the river bank.\"  There they found the round-leafed, or fish-net willow, and stripped off enough of its strong bark to make a bundle as big as one hand could hold.  This also had to be scraped clear of the brown skin, leaving only the strong whitish inner bark, which, when split into strips, was good for sewing.  \"See, my Nagami, when I was a little girl I had only a bone needle made from the leg of a deer, but you have easy work; here is a big steel packing needle, which I bought for you from a trader. This is how you "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23667"],["title","Woodland Tales (#7)"],["body","your basket.\"  So Akoko began a flat coil with the spruce roots, and sewed it together with the willow bark for thread, until it was a span wide. And whenever a new root was to be added, she cut both old piece and new, to a long point, so they would overlap without a bump.  Then the next coil of the spruce roots was laid on, not flat and level, but raised a little. Also the next, until the walls were as high as four fingers. Then Akoko said, \"Good, that is enough. It is a fine corn basket. But we must give it a red rim for good luck.\"  So they sought in a sunny place along the shore, and found the fruit of the squawberry or blitum. \"See,\" said Akoko, \"the miscawa. Gather a handful, my Nagami. They make the red basket-dye.\"  They crushed the rich red berries, saving the red juice in a clam shell, and soaked a few strands of the white willow bark in the stain. When they were dry, Nagami was taught to add a rim to her basket, by sewing it over and over as in the picture.  Then Akoko said, \"Good, my little Bird-Singer, you have done well, you have made some old black roots into a beautiful basket.\"         *       *       *       *       *  N.B. The Guide will remember that rattan and raffia can be used for this when it is impossible to get spruce roots and willow bark. Good dyes may be made from many different berries.   TALE 22  Crinkleroot; or Who Hid the Salad?  It has long been the custom of the Brownies to have a great feast on the first of the merry month of May, to celebrate the return of the spring.  [Illustration: The Crinkleroot; or Who Hid the Salad?]  One springtime long ago, they got ready as usual. The King of the Brownies had invited all the leaders; the place for the dinner was chosen in a grove of mandrakes whose flat umbrellas made a perfect roof, rain or shine. The Bell Bird, whose other name is Wood Thrush, was ringing his bell, and calling all the Chief Brownies by name.  \"Ta-rool-ya! _ting-a-ling-ling-ling._\"  \"Oka-lee! _ting-a-ling-ling-ling._\"  \"Cherk! _ting-a-ling-ling-ling._\"  \"Come to the feasting! _ting-a-ling-ling-ling._\"  A hundred glow worms were told to hurry up with their lights and be ready for that night, and busy Brownies gathered good things from woods and waters, for the feast.  May Day came bright and beautiful. The busy ones had all the \"eats\" in the Mandrake Hall, the glowworms were sleeping soundly to fill their storage batteries ready for the night. It made the salamanders' mouths water to see so many good things; but they were not asked, so stayed away. There were dewdrops in acorn cups, and honey on the wax. There were clam shells piled up with red checkerberries, and caddis worms on the half shell, with spicebush nubbins. A huge white Mecha-meck was the chief dish, with bog nuts on the side. There were lovely long crinkle salads. And last, there were gumdrops from the sweet birch, while at each place was a pussy willow to dust the food over with golden pollen that gave it a pleasant peppery tang. All the guests were there, and the feast was nearly over, when a terrible thing took place!  Of all the dreaded happenings in the world of beauty there is nothing else so feared as the forest fire. There is not much danger of it in springtime, but it is possible at any season, after a long dry spell. Words cannot tell of the horror it spreads, as it comes raging through the woods destroying all beautiful living things.  And right in the middle of the feast, the dreadful news was carried by a flying Night-bird.  \"Fire, Fire, Fire, Fire!\" he screamed, and almost at once the smoke came drifting through the banquet hall, so they knew it was true.  There was mad haste to escape, and only two ways were open. One was to get across some big stream, and the other was to hide in a cave underground. The birds took the first way, and the Brownies the second. Every Woodchuck den was just packed with Brownies within a few minutes. But the busy Brownie who was chief steward and had charge of the feast, had no idea of leaving all the good things to burn up, if he could help it. First he sent six of his helpers to make a deep pit for the big Mecha-meck, and while they did that he began hiding all the dishes in the ground. Last he dug some deep holes and quickly buried all the crinkle salads; then he ran for his life into a cave.  The raging fire came along. It is too horrible to tell about, for it was sent by the Evil One. The lovely woods were left black without a living thing. But the very next day, Mother Carey and Mother Earth and El Sol, set about saving the wreck, and in a marvellously short time actually had made it green again. The mayflowers came up a second time that year, the violets came back, and in each place where the Brownies had hid a salad there came up a curious plant that never had been seen before. It had three saw-edged leaves and a long wand, much like the one carried by the Chief Steward. I never was able to find out his name for sure, but I think it was Trileaf or Three-leaves. Anyway, if you dig under his sign and sceptre wand, you will surely find the salad, and very good indeed it is to eat; it was not hurt in the least by the fire.  [Illustration: The Mecha-meck]  But from that day, the Brownies have been very shy of feasting during dry weather in the woods. They generally have their banquets now in some meadow, and afterward you can tell the place of the feast by the circle of little toadstools called fairy rings. For you know that wherever a Brownie sits, a toadstool must spring up for him to sit on.   TALE 23  The Mecha-meck  That fearful time when the forest fire set all the Brownies busy burying their food and dishes at the feast-hall, you remember it took six of them to carry and hide the Mecha-meck. For it is a large fat white root as big as a baby, and sometimes it has arms or legs, so that when Monapini told Ruth Pilgrim about it she called it \"Man-of-the-earth.\"  You remember that the busy Brownie hid all the Crinkle salads, and so saved them; and most of us have found the Crinkleroot and eaten it since. But how many of us have found the Mecha-meck? I know only one man who has. We call him the Wise Woodman. He found and dug out the one from which I made the picture. It was two and a half feet long and weighed fifteen pounds--fifteen pounds of good food. Think of it! Above it and growing out of its hiding place was a long trailing vine that looked like a white morning-glory. There is always one of these over the Mecha-meck. And by that you may find it, if you look along the sunny banks outside of the woods. But still it is very hard to find. I never yet got one, though I have found many of the crinkle-root salads. Of course, that is easy to explain, for the busy Brownies buried hundreds of the salads, but only one of the big fat Mecha-meck.   TALE 24  Dutchman's Breeches  [Illustration: Dutchman's Dive  Dutchman's Breeches]  Of course they are not, for no Dutchman I ever saw could wear such tiny things. I will tell you what they really are and how that came to be.  You remember how the Brownies assembled for the feast on May Day when the Glow worms were the lamps and the Wood Thrush rang the bell. Well, it so happened that day that a great crowd of the merrymakers gathered long before the feast was ready, and while they were wondering what to do someone shouted: \"See, how fine and warm the water is where the brook spreads out into the ditch. Let us have our first swim of the season right now!\"  So they all went with a whoop! stripped off their clothes, and into their swimming breeches with a perfect riot of glee.  Then how they did splash! Some blind folks thought it must be a million early pollywogs splashing. But the swim ended with another racket when the dinner bell rang.  Each splashing Brownie hopped out and hung up his breeches to dry as he got into his clothes.  Then you remember the fire came along and scared them away. Of course the breeches were wet, so they didn't get singed; and there you can see them hanging to this day on the first of May. That is what they really are--Brownies' Breeches. And because the Brownies often swim in a ditch, they are called ditch-man's breeches; but believe me, they are not Dutchman's breeches and never could be.  [Illustration: The Seven Sour Sisters]   TALE 25  The Seven Sour Sisters  If you look along any half-open bank in the edge of the woods, or even in the woods itself, you are sure to see one of the Seven Sorrel Sisters, with leaves a little like Clover, only notched in the end and without the white marks, that the Brownie put on the Clover. There are seven of them, according to most doctors; five have yellow eyes, one purple, and one white streaked with blood. Their Latin name means \"vinegar\" and their Greek name means \"acid.\" \"Sorrel\" itself means \"Little sour one,\" so you see they have the reputation of a sour bunch. If you eat one of the leaves, you will agree that the name was well-chosen, and understand why the druggists get the tart \"salt of lemons\" from this family. The French use these Sour Sisters for their sour soup. But in spite of their unsweetness, they are among the pretty things of the woods; their forms are delicate and graceful; their eyes are like jewels, and when the night comes down, they bow their heads, gracefully fold their hands, and sleep like a lot of tired children.   TALE 26  Self-heal or Blue-curls in the Grass  [Illustration: Self-heal or Blue-curls in the Grass]  You should know the history of the lowly little flower called Blue-curls; and you must remember that flowers have their troubles just as you have. For one thing, flowers must get their pollen or yellow flower-dust, carried to some other of their kind, or they cannot keep on growing good seed. And since the flower cannot walk about finding places for its pollen, it generally makes a bargain with a bee. It says, \"If you will carry my pollen to my cousins yonder, I will give you a sweet sip of nectar.\" That is"]]]
