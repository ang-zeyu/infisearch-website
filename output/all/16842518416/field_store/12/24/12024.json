I'm determined that he shan't interrupt our _tete-a-tete_.\"  Miss Pritty uttered a little scream of surprise on entering the dining-room.  \"Well, aunt,\" said Edgar Berrington, with a hearty smile, as he extended his hand, \"you are surprised to see me?\"  \"Of course I am, dear Eddy,\" cried Miss Pritty, holding up her cheek for a kiss.  \"Sit down.  Why, you were in London when I last heard of you.\"  \"True, but I'm not in London now, as you see.  I've been a week here.\"  \"A week, Eddy!  And you did not come to see me till now?\"  \"Well, I ought to apologise,\" replied the youth, with a slight look of confusion, \"but--the fact is, I came down partly on business, and--and-- so you see I've been very busy.\"  \"Of course,\" laughed Miss Pritty; \"people who have business to do are usually very busy!  Well, I forgive you, and am glad to see you--but--\"  \"Well, aunt--but what?\"  \"In short, Eddy, I happen to be particularly engaged this evening--on _business_, too, like yourself; but, after all, why should I not introduce you to my friend?  You might help us in our discussion--it is to be about the poor.  Do you know much about the poor and their miseries?\"  Edgar smiled sadly as he replied--  \"Yes, I have had some experimental knowledge of the poor--being one of them myself, and my poverty too has made me inconceivably miserable.\"  \"Come, Eddy, don't talk nonsense.  You know I mean the _very_ poor, the destitute.  But let us go up-stairs and have a cup of tea.\"  The idea of discussing the condition of the poor over a cup of tea with two ladies was not attractive to our hero in his then state of mind, and he was beginning to excuse himself when his aunt stopped him:--  \"Now, don't say you can't, or won't, for you must.  And I shall introduce you to a very pretty girl--oh! _such_ a pretty one--you've no idea--and _so_ sweet!\"  Miss Pritty spoke impressively and with enthusiasm, but as the youth knew himself to be already acquainted with and beloved by the prettiest girl in the town he was not so much impressed as he might have been. However, being a good-natured fellow, he was easily persuaded.  All the way up-stairs, and while they were entering the boudoir, little Miss Pritty's tongue never ceased to vibrate, but when she observed her nephew gazing in surprise at her friend, whose usually calm and self-possessed face was covered with confusion, she stopped suddenly.  \"Good-evening, Miss Hazlit,\" said Edgar, recovering himself, and holding out his hand as he advanced towards her; \"I did not anticipate the pleasure of meeting _you_ here.\"  \"Then you are acquainted already!\" exclaimed Miss Pritty, looking as much amazed as if the accident of two young people being acquainted without her knowledge were something tantamount to a miracle.  \"Yes, I have met Mr Berrington at my father's several times,\" said Aileen, resuming her seat, and bestowing a minute examination on the corner of her handkerchief.  If Aileen had added that she had met Mr Berrington every evening for a week past at her father's, had there renewed the acquaintance begun in London a year before, and had been wooed and won by him before his stern repulse by her father, she would have said nothing beyond the bare truth; but she thought, no doubt, that it was not necessary to add all that.  \"Well, well, what strange things do happen!\" said Miss Pritty, resuming her duties at the tea-table.  \"Sugar, Eddy?  And cream?--Only to think that Aileen and I have known each other so well, and she did not know that you were my nephew; but after all it could not well be otherwise, for now I think of it, I never mentioned your name to her.  Out of sight, out of mind, Eddy, you know, and indeed you don't deserve to be remembered.  If we all had our deserts, some people that I know of would be in a very different position from what they are, and some people wouldn't _be_ at all.\"  \"Why, aunt,\" said Edgar, laughing.  \"Would you--\"  \"Some more cake, Eddy?\"  \"No, thank you.  I was going to say--\"  \"Have you enough cream?  Allow me to--\"  \"_Quite_ enough, thanks.  I was about to remark--\"  \"Some sugar, Aileen?--I beg your pardon--yes--you were about to say--\"  \"Oh!  Nothing,\" replied Edgar, half exasperated by these frequent interruptions, but laughing in spite of himself, \"only I'm surprised that sentence of annihilation should be passed on `some people' by one so amiable as you are.\"  \"Oh!  I didn't exactly mean annihilation,\" returned Miss Pritty, with a pitiful smile; \"I only mean that I wouldn't have had them come into existence, they seem to be so utterly useless in the world, and _so_ interfering, too, with those who _want_ to be useful.\"  \"Surely that quality, or capacity of interference, proves them to be not _utterly_ useless,\" said Edgar, \"for does it not give occasion for the exercise of patience and forbearance?\"  \"Ah!\" replied Miss Pritty, with an arch smile, shaking her finger at her nephew, \"you are a fallacious reasoner.  Do you know what that means?  I can't help laughing still at the trouble I used to have in trying to find out the meaning of that word fallacious, when I was at Miss Dullandoor's seminary for young ladies--hi!  Hi!  Some of us were excessively _young_ ladies, and we were taught everything by rote, explanations of meanings of anything being quite ignored by Miss Dullandoor.  Do you remember her sister?  Oh!  I'm so stupid to forget that it's exactly thirty years to-day since she died, and you can't be quite that age yet; besides, even if you were, it would require that you should have seen, and recognised, and remembered her on her deathbed about the time of your own birth.  Oh!  She _was_ so funny, both in face and figure.  One of the older girls made a portrait of her for me which I have yet.  I'll go fetch it; the expression is irresistible--it is killing.  Excuse me a minute.\"  Miss Pritty rose and tripped--she never walked--from the room.  During much of the previous conversation our hero had been sorely perplexed in his mind as to his duty in present circumstances.  Having been forbidden to hold any intercourse with Aileen, he questioned the propriety of his remaining to spend the evening with her, and had made up his mind to rise and tear himself away when this unlooked-for opportunity for a _tete-a-tete_ occurred.  Being a man of quick wit and strong will, he did not neglect it.  Turning suddenly to the fair girl, he said, in a voice low and measured--  \"Aileen, your father commanded me to have no further intercourse with you, and he made me aware that he had laid a similar injunction on yourself.  I know full well your true-hearted loyalty to him, and do not intend to induce you to disobey.  I ask you to make no reply to what I say that is not consistent with your promise to your father.  For myself, common courtesy tells me that I may not leave your presence for a distant land without saying at least good-bye.  Nay, more, I feel that I break no command in making to you a simple deliberate statement.\"  Edgar paused for a moment, for, in spite of the powerful restraint put on himself, and the intended sedateness of his words, his feelings were almost too strong for him.  \"Aileen,\" he resumed, \"I may never see you again.  Your father intends that I shall not.  Your looks seem to say that you fear as much.  Now, my heart tells me that I _shall_; but, whatever betide, or wherever I go, let me assure you that I will continue to love you with unalterable fidelity.  More than this I shall not say, less I could not.  You said that these New Testaments\"--pointing to a pile of four or five which lay on the table--\"are meant to be given to poor men.  _I_ am a poor man: will you give me one?\"  \"Willingly,\" said Aileen, taking one from the pile.  She handed it to her lover without a single word, but with a tender anxious look that went straight to his heart, and took up its lodging there--to abide for ever!  The youth grasped the book and the hand at once, and, stooping, pressed the latter fervently to his lips.  At that moment Miss Pritty was heard tripping along the passage.  Edgar sprang to intercept her, and closed the door of the boudoir behind him.  \"Why, Edgar, you seem in haste!\"  \"I am, dear aunt; circumstances require that I should be.  Come down-stairs with me.  I have stayed too long already.  I am going abroad, and may not spend more time with you this evening.\"  \"Going abroad!\" exclaimed Miss Pritty, in breathless surprise, \"where?\"  \"I don't know.  To China, Japan, New Zealand, the North Pole--anywhere. In fact, I've not quite fixed.  Good-bye, dear aunt.  Sorry to have seen so little of you.  Good-bye.\"  He stooped, printed a gentle kiss between Miss Pritty's wondering eyes, and vanished.  \"A most remarkable boy,\" said the disconcerted lady, resuming her seat at the tea-table--\"so impulsive and volatile.  But he's a dear good boy nevertheless--was so kind to his mother while she was alive, and ran away from school when quite young--and no wonder, for it was a dreadful school, where they used to torture the boys,--absolutely tortured them. The head-master and ushers were tried for it afterwards, I'm told.  At all events; Eddy ran away from it after pulling the master's nose and kicking the head usher--so it is said, though I cannot believe it, he is usually so gentle and courteous.--_Do_ have a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23493"],["title","Under the Waves: Diving in Deep Waters (#7)"],["body","more tea.  No?  A piece of bun?  No?  Why, you seem quite flushed, my love.  Not unwell, I trust?  No?  Well, then, let us proceed to business.\"    CHAPTER FOUR.  DIVERS MATTERS.  Charles Hazlit, Esquire, was a merchant and a shipowner, a landed proprietor, a manager of banks, a member of numerous boards and committees, a guardian of the poor, a volunteer colonel, and a good-humoured man on the whole, but purse-proud and pompous.  He was also the father of Aileen.  Behold him seated in an elegant drawing-room, in a splendid mansion at the \"west end\" (strange that all aristocratic ends would appear to be west ends!) of the seaport town which owned him.  His blooming daughter sat beside him at a table, on which lay a small, peculiar, box.  He doated on his daughter, and with good reason.  Their attention was so exclusively taken up with the peculiar box that they had failed to observe the entrance, unannounced, of a man of rough exterior, who stood at the door, hat in hand, bowing and coughing attractively, but without success.  \"My darling,\" said Mr Hazlit, stooping to kiss his child--his only child--who raised her pretty little three-cornered mouth to receive it, \"this being your twenty-first birthday, I have at last brought myself to look once again on your sainted mother's jewel-case, in order that I may present it to you.  I have not opened it since the day she died.  It is now yours, my child.\"  Aileen opened her eyes in mute amazement.  It would seem as though there had been some secret sympathy between her and the man at the door, for he did precisely the same thing.  He also crushed his hat somewhat convulsively with both hands, but without doing it any damage, as it was a very hard sailor-like hat.  He also did something to his lips with his tongue, which looked a little like licking them.  \"Oh papa!\" exclaimed Aileen, seizing his hand, \"how kind; how--\"  \"Nay, love, no thanks are due to me.  It is your mother's gift.  On her deathbed she made me promise to give it you when you came of age, and to train you, up to that age, as far as possible, with a disregard for dress and show.  I think your dear mother was wrong,\" continued Mr Hazlit, with a mournful smile, \"but, whether right or wrong, you can bear me witness that I have sought to fulfil the second part of her dying request, and I now accomplish the first.\"  He proceeded to unlock, the fastenings of the little box, which was made of some dark metal resembling iron, and was deeply as well as richly embossed on the lid and sides with quaint figures and devices.  Mr Hazlit had acquired a grand, free-handed way of manipulating treasure.  Instead of lifting the magnificent jewels carefully from the casket, he tumbled them out like a gorgeous cataract of light and colour, by the simple process of turning the box upside down.  \"Oh papa, take care!\" exclaimed Aileen, spreading her little hands in front of the cataract to stem its progress to the floor, while her two eyes opened in surprise, and shone with a lustre that might have made the insensate gems envious.  \"How exquisite!  How inexpressibly beautiful!--oh my dear, darling mother--!\"  She stopped abruptly, and tears fluttered from her eyes.  In a few seconds she continued, pushing the gems away, almost passionately--  \"But I cannot wear them, papa.  They are worthless to me.\"  She was right.  She had no need of such gems.  Was not her hair golden and her skin alabaster?  Were not her lips coral and her teeth pearls? And were not diamonds of the purest water dropping at that moment from her down-cast eyes?  \"True, my child, and the sentiment does your heart credit; they are worthless, utterly worthless--mere paste\"--at this point the face of the man at the door visibly changed for the worse--\"mere paste, as regards their power to bring back to us the dear one who wore them. Nevertheless, in a commercial point of view\"--here the ears of the man at the door cocked--\"they are worth some eight or nine thousand pounds sterling, so they may as well be taken care of.\"  The tongue and lips of the man at the door again became active.  He attempted--unsuccessfully, as before--to crush his hat, and inadvertently coughed.  Mr Hazlit's usually pale countenance flushed, and he started up.  \"Hallo!  My man, how came _you_ here?\"  The man looked at the door and hesitated in his attempt to reply to so useless a question.  \"How comes it that you enter my house and drawing-room without being announced?\" asked Mr Hazlit, drawing himself up.  \"'Cause I wanted to see you, an' I found the door open, an' there warn't nobody down stair to announce me,\" answered the man in a rather surly tone.  \"Oh, indeed?--ah,\" said Mr Hazlit, drawing out a large silk handkerchief with a flourish, blowing his nose therewith, and casting it carelessly on the table so as to cover the jewel-box.  \"Well, as you are now ere, pray what have you got to say to me?\"  \"Your ship the _Seagull_ has bin' wrecked, sir, on Toosday night on the coast of Wales.\"  \"I received that unpleasant piece of news on Wednesday morning.  What has _that_ to do with your visit?\"  \"Only that I thought you might want divers for to go to the wreck, an' _I'm_ a diver--that's all.\"  The man at the door said this in a very surly tone, for the slight tendency to politeness which had begun to manifest itself while the prospect of \"a job\" was hopeful, vanished before the haughty manner of the merchant.  \"Well, it is just possible that I may require the assistance of divers,\" said Mr Hazlit, ringing the bell; \"when I do, I can send for you.-- John, show this person out.\"  The hall-footman, who had been listening attentively at the key-hole, and allowed a second or two to elapse before opening the door, bowed with a guilty flush on his face and held the door wide open.  David Maxwell--for it was he--passed out with an angry scowl, and as he strode with noisy tread across the hall, said something uncommonly pithy to the footman about \"upstarts\" and \"puppies,\" and \"people who thought they was made o' different dirt from others,\" accompanied with many other words and expressions which we may not repeat.  To all of this John replied with bland smiles and polite bows, hoping that the effects of the interview might not render him feverish, and reminding him that if it did he was in a better position than most men for cooling himself at the bottom of the sea.  \"Farewell,\" said John earnestly; \"and if you should take a fancy to honour us any day with your company to dinner, _do_ send a line to say you're coming.\"  John did not indulge in this pleasantry until the exasperated diver was just outside of the house, and it was well that he was so prudent, for Maxwell turned round like a tiger and struck with tremendous force at his face.  His hard knuckles met the panel of the door, in which they left an indelible print, and at the same time sent a sound like a distant cannon shot into the library.  \"I'm afraid I have been a little too sharp with him,\" said Mr Hazlit, assisting his daughter to replace the jewels.  Aileen agreed with him, but as nothing could induce her to condemn her father with her lips she made no reply.  \"But,\" continued the old gentleman, \"the rascal had no right to enter my house without ringing.  He might have been a thief, you know.  He looked rough and coarse enough to be one.\"  \"Oh papa,\" said Aileen entreatingly, \"don't be too hasty in judging those who are sometimes called rough and coarse.  I do assure you I've met many men in my district who are big and rough and coarse to look at, but who have the feelings and hearts of tender women.\"  \"I know it, simple one; you must not suppose that I judged him by his exterior; I judged him by his rude manner and conduct, and I do not extend my opinion of him to the whole class to which he belongs.\"  It is strange--and illustrative of the occasional perversity of human reasoning--that Mr Hazlit did not perceive that he himself had given the diver cause to judge him, Mr Hazlit, very harshly, and the worst of it was that Maxwell _did_, in his wrath, extend his opinion of the merchant to the entire class to which he belonged, expressing a deep undertoned hope that the \"whole bilin' of 'em\" might end their days in a place where he spent many of his own, namely, at the bottom of the sea. It is to be presumed that he wished them to be there without the benefit of diving-dresses!  \"It is curious, however,\" continued Mr Hazlit, \"that I had been thinking this very morning about making inquiries after a diver, one whom I have frequently heard spoken of as an exceedingly able and respectable man--Balding or Bolding or some such name, I think.\"  \"Oh!  Baldwin, Joe Baldwin, as his intimate friends call him,\" said Aileen eagerly.  \"I know him well; he is in my district.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed Mr Hazlit, \"not one of your paupers?\"  Aileen burst into a merry laugh.  \"No, papa, no; not a pauper certainly. He's a well-off diver, and a Wesleyan--a local preacher, I believe--but he lives in my district, and is one of the most zealous labourers in it. Oh!  If you saw him, papa, with his large burly frame and his rough bronzed kindly face, and broad shoulders, and deep bass voice and hearty laugh.\"  The word suggested the act, for Aileen went off again at the bare idea of Joe Baldwin being a pauper--one at whose feet, she said, she delighted to sit and learn.  \"Well, I'm glad to have such a good account of him from one so well able to judge,\" rejoined her father, \"and as I mean to go visit him without delay I'll be obliged if you'll give me his address.\"  Having received it, the merchant sallied forth into those regions of the town where, albeit she was not a guardian of the poor, his daughter's light figure was a much more familiar object than his own.  \"Does a diver named Baldwin live here?\" asked Mr Hazlit of a figure which he found standing in a doorway near the end of a narrow passage.  The figure was hazy and indistinct by reason of the"]]]
