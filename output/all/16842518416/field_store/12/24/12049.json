When the coach stopped, as we have described, Jacky got out, and roundly asserted that he would never get in again.  When the attention of the party was occupied with the gorgeous scenery at the extremity of the pass, Jacky, under a sudden impulse of wickedness, crept stealthily into the copse that lined the road, intending to give his parents a fright.  In less than five minutes these parents were galloping away at the rate of ten miles an hour, each happy in the belief that the sweet boy was with the other.  Somewhat surprised at the prolonged and deathlike silence that reigned around him, Jacky returned to the road, where he actually gasped with horror on finding himself the solitary tenant of an apparently uninhabited wilderness.  Sitting down on a stone, he shut his eyes, opened wide his mouth, and roared vehemently.  At the end of about five minutes he ventured to re-open his eyes.  His face instantly assumed an expression of abject terror, and the roar was intensified into a piercing shriek when he beheld a fierce little black cow staring at him within a yard of his face.  A drove of shaggy Highland cattle had come suddenly round a turn in the pass while Jacky's eyes had been shut.  They now filed slowly and steadily past the transfixed boy, as if they were a regiment and he a reviewing general.  Each animal as it came up, stopped, stared for a few seconds, and passed slowly on with its head down, as if saddened by the sight of such a melancholy spectacle.  There were upwards of a hundred animals in the drove; the prolonged and maddening agony which Jacky endured may therefore be conceived but cannot be described.  Last of all came the drover, a kilted, plaided, and bonneted Highlander, quite as shaggy as the roughest of his cattle, and rather fiercer in aspect.  He was not so in reality however, for, on coming to the place where the poor boy sat, he stopped and stared as his predecessors had done.  \"Fat is she doin' there?\" said he.  Jacky paused, and gazed for one moment in mute surprise, then resumed his roar with shut eyes and with tenfold vigour.  As it was evident that any farther attempt at conversation must prove fruitless, the drover took Jacky in his arms, carried him to the extremity of the pass, set him down, and, pointing to the white house in the blue distance, said--  \"Yonder's ta hoose; let her see how she can rin.\"  Jacky fixed his eyes on the house with the stare of one who regarded it as his last and only refuge, and ran as he had never done before, roaring while he ran.  \"She's a clever callant,\" observed the drover with a grim smile, as he turned to follow his cattle.  Meanwhile the Sudberry Family reached the White House in the midst of increasing rain and mists and muttering thunder.  Of course Jacky's absence was at once discovered.  Of course the females screamed and the males shouted, while they turned the mail-coach entirely inside out in a vain search for the lost one.  The din was increased by nine shepherd dogs, which rushed down the mountain-side, barking furiously with delight, (probably), and with excitement, (certainly), at the unwonted sight of so many strangers in that remote glen.  Presently the coach was turned round, and the distracted father galloped back towards the pass. Of course he almost ran over his youngest son in less than five minutes! Five minutes more placed the recovered child in its mother's arms. Then followed a scene of kissing, crying, laughing, barking, and excitement, which is utterly indescribable, accompanied by thunder, lightning, and rain, in the midst of which tempestuous mental and elemental commotion, the Sudberry Family took possession of their Highland home.    STORY ONE, CHAPTER 3.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS.  Next morning the Sudberrys were awakened to a sense of the peculiar circumstances into which they had plunged, by the lowing of cattle, the crowing of cocks, and the furious barking of collie dogs, as the household of Donald McAllister commenced the labours of a new day.  Of course every member of the Sudberry Family, with the exception of \"mamma,\" rushed to his or her respective window.  \"Oh! how beautiful!\" gushed from the heart and lips of Lucy, as she gazed in wonder through the casement, and a shriek burst from Jacky, as he stared in wild delight upon the gorgeous scene that met his view.  We have said that the White House was embedded among the blue hills.  It was an old and extremely simple building, having an oblong front, two sides, and a back; two stories, six windows, and one door; which last, imbued, apparently, with a dislike to being shut, was always open.  The house appeared to have an insatiable thirst for mountain air, and it was well supplied with this fresh and exhilarating beverage; for it stood in an elevated position on the slope of a mountain, and overlooked a wide tract of flood and fell, on which latter there was little wood, but a luxuriant carpet of grass and heather.  The weather had evidently resolved to make amends for its surly reception of the strangers the previous evening, by greeting them with one of its sweetest Highland smiles in the morning.  When Mr Sudberry, in the exuberance of his delight, ran without hat or coat to a neighbouring knoll, accompanied by all his children, the scene that met his eye was one of surpassing grandeur and beauty.  The mists of early morning were rolling up from the loch in white, fleecy clouds, which floated over and partly concealed the sides of the mountains.  The upper wreaths of these clouds, and the crags and peaks that pierced through them were set on fire by the rising sun.  Great fissures and gorges in the hills, which at other times lay concealed in the blue haze of distance, were revealed by the mists and the slanting rays of the sun, and the incumbent cliffs, bluff promontories, and capes, were in some places sharply defined, in others luminously softened, so that the mountains displayed at once that appearance of solid reality, mingled with melting mystery, which is seen at no period of the day but early morning.  The whole scene--water, earth, and sky--was so involved, that no lines of demarcation could be traced anywhere; only bold startling points, melting into blue and white masses that mingled with each other in golden and pearly greys of every conceivable variety.  Having said thus much, we need scarcely add that the scene cannot be adequately described.  A light fragrant air met the stout Englishman as he crested the hill, and filled his unaccustomed nostrils with sensations that could not have been excelled had he been greeted by one of \"Afric's spicy gales.\"  The same air, with telegraphic speed, conveyed to the collie dogs of the place the information that the Sudberrys were abroad; whereupon the whole pack--nine in number--bounded open-mouthed up the hill, with noise and ferocity enough to have alarmed the bravest of the brave.  No wonder then that poor Jacky rushed into his father's knees, being too small to run into his arms.  But these seemingly ferocious dogs were in reality the gentlest and meekest of animals.  \"Down, Topper, down! down, Lively, lass; come into heel, Swaney,\" cried Donald McAllister, as he approached his tenants.  \"Good-mornin', miss; mornin', gentlemen.  The Ben has on its nightcap, but I'm thinkin' it'll soon take it off.\"  Donald McAllister's English was excellent, but he spoke in a slow, deliberate manner, and with a slightly nasal drawl, which sounded very peculiar in the ears of the Sudberrys,--just as peculiar, in fact, as their speech sounded in the ears of McAllister.  \"Ah! you call the white cloud on the mountain-top a nightcap?--good, very good,\" cried Mr Sudberry, rubbing his hands.  \"What a charming place this is, a paradisaical place, so to speak.  The dogs won't bite, will they?\" said he, patting the alarmed Jacky on the head.  \"No fear o' the dogs, sir,\" returned McAllister; \"they're like lambs. It's just their way.  Ye'll be for a row on the loch the day, no doot.\" The Highlander addressed this remark to George and Fred.  \"What!\" exclaimed the former, \"is there a boat that we can have the use of?\"  \"'Deed is there, a good safe boat too, that can hold the whole of ye. I'll show you where the oars lie after breakfast.\"  \"Capital,\" cried Mr Sudberry, rubbing his hands.  \"Charming,\" exclaimed Lucy, with sparkling eyes.  Master Jacky expressed his glee with a characteristic cheer or yell, that at once set fire to the easily inflamed spirits of the dogs, causing them to resume their excited gambols and furious barking.  This effectually stopped the conversation for five minutes.  \"I delight in boating,\" observed Fred, when McAllister had quelled the disturbance.  \"So do I,\" said his father; \"but fishing is the thing for me.  There's nothing like fishing.  You have fine trout in the lake, I believe?\"  \"Ay, an' salmon too,\" answered McAllister.  \"So I've heard, so I've heard,\" said Mr Sudberry, with a glow of excitement and pleasure on his round visage.  \"We must get our rods and tackle unpacked at once, George.  You are a great fisher, no doubt, Mr McAllister?\"  \"Well, not just that, but I do manage to fill a basket now and then, an' whiles to land a g'ilse.\"  \"A gilse!\" cried George in surprise, \"what is that?\"  \"It is a small salmon--\"  \"Oh! you mean a grilse,\" interposed Mr Sudberry.  \"Yes, I mean that, an' I said that,\" returned McAllister, slowly and with emphasis.  \"Scienteefic men are not agreed whether the g'ilse is a small salmon or not; I'm of opeenion that it is.  But whether or not, it's a famous fish on the table, and lively enough on the line to delight the heart of every true disciple of Isaac Walton.\"  \"What, you have read that charming book?\" exclaimed Mr Sudberry, looking at the rugged Highlander in some surprise.  \"Yes,\" replied the other, in the grave quiet manner that was peculiar to him; \"I took to it one winter as a sort o' recreation, after"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23505"],["title","Freaks on the Fells: Three Months' Rustication (#3)"],["body","n' through `Paley's Evidences.'\"  \"What!\" cried Mr Sudberry, \"whose Evidences did you say?\"  \"Paley's; ye've heard o' him, dootless.\"  \"Why, yes,\" replied Mr Sudberry, \"I have heard of him, but I--I must confess that I have not read him.\"  At this point, Jacky's eye fell on a shaggy little cow which had strayed near to the party, and stood regarding him with a stern inquisitive glance.  Remembering the fright he had received so recently from a similar creature, he uttered a tremendous roar, and again sought refuge in his father's knees.  The discussion on Paley was thus cut short; for the dogs--whose chief delight was to bark, though _not_ to bite, as has been libellously asserted of all dogs by Dr Watts--sprang to their feet, divided their forces, and, while two of the oldest kept frisking round and leaping upon the party in a promiscuous manner, as if to assure them of protection in the event of danger, the remainder ran open-mouthed and howling at the cow.  That curly-headed, long-horned creature received them at first with a defiant look and an elevated tail, but ultimately took to her heels, to the immense delight of Jacky, whose soul was imbued with a deep and altogether unutterable horror of cattle, especially black cows.  The service which the dogs rendered to him on this occasion induced the boy to make advances of a friendly nature, which were met more than halfway, and the result was the establishment of a good understanding between the Sudberrys and the collie dogs, which ultimately ripened into a lasting friendship, insomuch that when the family quitted the place, Lucy carried away with her a lock of Lively's hair, cut from the pendent tip of her right ear.  Presently Mr Sudberry pulled out his watch, and, exclaiming that it was breakfast-time, trotted down the hill, followed by his family and escorted by the dogs.  We will pause here to describe Mr Sudberry's family briefly.  George was the merchant's eldest son.  He was bold, stout, active, middle-sized, and seventeen years of age; full of energy and life, a crack rower, a first-rate cricketer, and generally a clever fellow. George was always jolly.  Fred was about the same height as his brother, two years younger, slender in form, and gentle in disposition, but active, too, when occasion required it.  His forte was drawing and painting.  Fred was generally quiet and grave.  Both brothers were musical.  Lucy had reached the interesting age of sixteen.  She was plain, decidedly, but sweet-tempered in the extreme.  Her mouth was good, and her eyes were good, and her colour was good, but her nose was a snub,-- an undeniable and incurable snub.  Her mother had tried to amend it from the earliest hours of Lucy's existence by pulling the point gently downwards and pinching up the bridge,--or, rather, the hollow where the bridge ought to have been,--but all in vain; the infant turned up its eyes when the operation was going on, and still turned up its nose when it was over.  Yes, although there were many of the elements of beauty about Lucy, she was plain--but sweet; always bear that in mind.  She was funny too.  Not that she made fun of her own free will; but she appreciated fun in others so intensely that she looked funny herself; and she giggled.  This was her only fault, she giggled.  When the spirit of fun was roused, nothing could stop her.  But don't suppose that she was always giggling; by no means.  She was always good and amiable, often grave, and sometimes deeply serious.  Matilda, commonly called Tilly, was a meek, delicate, pretty little girl of eight years old.  She was charmingly innocent and ignorant.  In the last respect she resembled her mother, who was the only other stupid member of Mr Sudberry's family.  Being deeply impressed with the fact of her ignorance and stupidity, Mrs Sudberry went on the tack of boldly admitting the same, and holding, or affecting to hold, ability and general acquirements in contempt.  Mrs Brown was a female dragon, nurse to Master Jacky and Miss Tilly; she tormented the former, whom she disliked, and spoiled the latter, whom she loved.  Hobbs was the man-servant of the family.  He was characterised chiefly by a tendency to drop his h's in conversation, out of words to which they naturally belonged, and to pick them up and insert them in the most contradictory manner, in words with which they had no connection whatever.  He was also marked by the strong regard and esteem which he had for his master and family; the stronger regard and esteem which he had for himself; and the easy, good-humoured way in which he regarded the remainder of the world at large as an inferior order of beings.  As for Peter, he has already been described as the timid clerk of humble origin, whose chief duties, while in London, were to wipe up ink and clear away _debris_.  He had been taken with the family to act the part of a page in buttons without the buttons--and to make himself generally useful.  Hitherto the page's bosom had, since leaving London, been a chamber of indescribable terrors.  Truly, if, as is said, the anticipation of death be worse than the reality, poor Peter must have suffered a prolonged and continuous death during the last few days. Never having been on a railway before, the first shriek of the whistle pierced him like a knife, the shock of starting rent him, (figuratively), like a thunderbolt.  Thereafter, every passing train was an excruciating arrow in his quivering heart, every tunnel was a plunge into the horrible anticipation that \"here it was coming at last!\"  But Peter's trials were now, for a time, he fondly hoped, at an end.  Poor boy! he little knew what was in store for him.    STORY ONE, CHAPTER 4.  FIRST COMERS SERVED FIRST, ETCETERA.  When Mr Sudberry reached the breakfast parlour, and put his head in at the door to see whether his faithful wife were there, he was struck absolutely dumb by the amazing _tableau vivant_ that met his vision.  There was nothing in the aspect of the room itself to surprise him.  It was homely and neat.  The table was spread with a clean white cloth, on which the breakfast equipage was displayed with a degree of care and precision that betrayed the master-hand of Hobbs; but on the edge of the table sat a large black cat, calmly breakfasting off a pat of delicious fresh butter.  Beside the table, with its fore-legs thereon and its hind-legs on the floor, stood a large nanny-goat, which was either looking in vain for something suited to its own particular taste, or admiring with disinterested complacency the energy with which two hens and a bantam cock pecked out the crumb of a wheaten loaf.  If the latter were the goat's occupation, it must have been charmed beyond expression; for the half of the loaf had been devoured by the audacious trio, and, just at the moment of Mr Sudberry's appearance, the bantam's body was buried over the shoulders, and nothing of it was visible to the horrified master of the house save its tail, appearing over the edge of the loaf.  \"She-ee-ew!\" roared Mr Sudberry, rushing into the room and whirling his arms like the sails of a windmill.  The cat vanished through the window like a black vision galvanised and made awfully real.  The poultry, thrown into convulsions of terror, flew screaming round the room in blind haste, searching for a door or window of escape; while the goat, true to its nature, ran at the enemy on its hind-legs, and, with its head down, attempted to punch him on the stomach.  By an active leap to one side, the enemy escaped this charge; but the goat, nothing daunted, turned to renew the attack; next moment George, Fred, and Hobbs, rushing into the room, diverted its attention.  Intimidated by overwhelming numbers, the animal darted through the doorway, along the passage and out at the front door, where it met Peter unexpectedly, and wreaked its disappointed vengeance on him by planting on his chest the punch which had been intended for his master.  By this means that timid and hapless youth was laid flat on the green grass.  \"Is Jacky safe?\" cried Mrs Sudberry, running into the room with terror on her countenance, and falling down on the sofa in a semi-swoon on being informed that he was.  She was followed by Lucy and Tilly, with scent-bottles, and by nurse, who exhibited a tendency to go off into hysterics; but who, in consequence of a look from her master, postponed that luxury to a more convenient season.  Thus the \"expatriated\" family assembled to morning prayers, and to partake of their first Highland breakfast.  Of course that day, being their first, was spent in an excited and rambling endeavour to master the localities and ascertain the most interesting points about their new home.  Mrs Sudberry and her daughters examined the interior accommodation of the White House minutely, and, with the assistance of Mrs Brown, Hobbs, and the page, disposed their goods and chattels to the best advantage; while her husband and sons went out to introduce themselves to the farmer and his family.  They lived in a small cottage, or off-shoot, at the back of the principal dwelling, in close proximity to which were the byre, stable, and barns.  It would occupy too much space to relate in detail all the things and sights that called forth the delight and surprise of the excitable Mr Sudberry.  How he found to his amazement that the byre was under the same roof with the farmer's kitchen, and only separated therefrom by a wooden partition with a door in it.  How he was assailed by the nine collie dogs the moment he entered the kitchen, with threats of being torn to pieces, yet was suffered to pass unscathed.  How he and his sons were introduced by Mr McAllister to his mother, a grave, mild old woman, who puzzled them beyond measure; because, although clad in homely and unfashionable garments, and dwelling in a hut little better than the habitation of the cattle, except in point of cleanliness, she conversed and conducted herself"]]]
