The _Common_, or _European badger_, need not be here described, since it is familiar to all.  The same may be said of the two American badgers, and also that of India, all three of which are very similar in habits and appearance to the common kind.  But the _African badger_, or _Ratel_, merits a word or two.  It is about the size of the true badger, and ordinarily lives on small game, as badgers do; but, in addition to this, it is fond of varying its diet with a little honey.  This it procures from the nests of wild bees, common throughout the whole of Africa.  The account given of the mode in which it finds these nests would be incredible, were it not that we have the testimony of reverend missionaries to confirm it.  It is as follows:--In Africa there is a bird--a species of cuckoo--known as the Indicator bird, or honey guide.  This little creature hops from tree to tree, itself apparently in search of the bees' nests.  While doing so, it utters a shrill cry; and these cries are repeated until the honey hive is found.  The ratel lies in wait for this bird; and, on hearing the cry, makes towards it, and keeps following its flights till the bees' nest is found.  Should this prove to be in a tree and out of reach--for the ratel is not a climber--the animal vents his chagrin by tearing at the trunk with his teeth, as if he had hopes of felling the tree.  The scratches thus made on the bark serve as a guide to certain other creatures, who are also fond of honey, viz., the Kaffir hunters and Bushmen.  Should the bees' nest prove to be on the ground, or under it, the ratel soon unearths the treasure with his strong claws, and takes possession of it, regardless of the stings of the bees, against which his thick skin defends him.  The _Orison_ inhabits the forests of South America, from Guiana to Paraguay.  It is quite as ferocious as any of the tribe; but its smaller size hinders it from attacking large animals, and its victims are birds, agoutis, and other small rodents--against all of which it wages a war of extermination.  When surprised by the hunters and their dogs, it will battle furiously till life is extinct: all the while emitting a strong disagreeable smell, after the manner of the weasels and polecats.  The _Racoon_, which we have grouped with the badgers, is both a North and South American animal; dwelling in dense forests, and making its lair in the hollow of a tree.  This animal is a good tree-climber, and usually takes refuge among the higher branches when pursued.  It is nocturnal in its habits, but in deep shady woods it may be seen prowling about in the daylight, in search of birds and their eggs, small rodents, fish, or frogs, all of which it eats indifferently.  There are several distinct species.  The _Coati_ is exclusively South American.  This, unlike the racoon, sleeps at night, and prowls during the day.  It is also an expert tree-climber, and has a peculiarity in this respect; viz., it descends a tree _head foremost_, which no other animal of its order can do.  It is equally as fierce and carnivorous as any of the badgers; and its prey, as with the _racoon_, consists of birds, their eggs, and small quadrupeds.  It feeds also upon insects; and will turn over the earth with its long proboscis-like snout.  When drinking it laps like the dog. In eating, it uses its fore-paws to carry the food to its mouth, though not as squirrels and monkeys do.  On the contrary, it first divides the flesh, or whatever it may be, into small morsels, and then raises these to its mouth by impaling them on its claws as on a fork!  It is not a solitary animal, but prefers the society of its companions, and usually goes about in troops or gangs.  Its lair, like the racoon, is the hollow of a tree.  The _Panda_ of the East Indies is an animal of very similar habits.  It is found chiefly along the banks of streams that descend from the mountains; and subsists upon small quadrupeds and birds--which it is able to follow to the tops of the tallest trees.  Its name of Qua, or Oua, or Wha, is derived from the cry which it utters, and repeats very often; and which is well represented by any of the syllables above written.    CHAPTER FIVE.  WEASELS, OTTERS AND CIVETS.  Fortunate it is that the quadrupeds composing this group are all animals of small dimensions.  Were they equal in size to lions and tigers, the human race would be in danger of total extirpation: for it is well-known that weasels are the most ferocious and bloodthirsty creatures upon the earth.  None of them, however, much exceed the size of the ordinary cat: unless we include the gluttons and wolverenes among the weasels, as naturalists sometimes do, notwithstanding that these animals differ altogether from them.  The _civets_, it is true, are not usually classed with the weasels, but form a group of themselves; however, they are much more nearly related to weasels than the gluttons; and where, as in the present case, it is desirable to divide the mammalia into large groups, they will stand very well together.  In truth, the civets are much nearer in resemblance to weasels than the otters are; and these two last are generally classed together--the otters being neither more nor less than water weasels.  We shall first consider the true _Weasels_: that is, the Weasels, Stoats, Ferrets, Polecats, and Martens.  The habits of most of the species are well-known; and all resemble each other in the exceeding ferocity of their disposition.  It will only be necessary to say a word about their geographical distribution, and to speak of a few of the more noted kinds.  In Great Britain, five species are natives: the Pine and Beech Martens, the Stoat, the Common Weasel (which is the type of the family), and the Polecat.  The Ferret is not indigenous to the country, but has been introduced from Africa, and is trained, as is well-known, for the pursuit of the rabbit--which it can follow into the very innermost recesses of its burrow.  The English species of weasels are also common to other countries of Europe and Asia.  In the high northern latitudes of the Old World, we find a very celebrated species--celebrated for a long time on account of its valuable fur--the Sable.  The sable is a true marten: a tree-climber, and one of the most sanguinary of weasels.  An account of its habits, and of the mode of hunting it, forms one of the most interesting chapters in natural history.  An allied species inhabits the Hudson's Bay territory, known as the American sable, and another, belonging to the Japanese islands, is called the Japan sable.  The Ermine is a species equally famous; and for a like reason--the value of its beautiful white fur, so long an article of commerce.  The ermine is neither more nor less than a stoat in winter dress; but there are several varieties of it--some that turn to brown in summer, while another kind retains its snow-white covering throughout all the year. The ermine is common to Europe, Asia, and North America.  The Pekan is a larger species, belonging to North America, and semi-aquatic in its habits; while the Vison, or Mink, is a large black weasel that inhabits the borders of rivers in Canada and the United States, where it preys upon fish and aquatic reptiles.  In North America there is also a very large Pine marten, so called from its habit of dwelling in the pine forests--where it climbs the trees in pursuit of birds and squirrels.  This is among the largest of the weasel tribe.  In California, a new species has been described under the name of the Yellow-cheeked weasel, and in Mexico another, the Black--faced; so that North America has its full complement of these sanguinary quadrupeds.  Nor is the southern division of that continent without its weasels, as there is one species or more in New Granada, one in Guiana, and two or three in Chili and Peru.  In India, there is the White-cheeked weasel, Hodgson's and Horsefield's weasels; and in Nepaul, the Nepaul weasel, and the Cathia.  Further north in Asia, there is, in Siberia, the Vomela, the Chorok, and the Altai weasel of the Altai Mountains; and no doubt need exist that animals of the weasel tribe are to be found everywhere.  Indeed, if we regard as weasels the various carnivorous quadrupeds of the glutton and badger family, which have been described elsewhere in these sketches-- including the strange Teledu or Stinkard of Java, the Helietis of India and China, the Taira and Grison of Brazil, the Ratel or honey badger of Africa, the Zorille of the Cape, the Zorilla or Maikel of Patagonia, the Sand bear of India, and the numerous varieties of the celebrated Polecat, or Skunk, of North and South America--we may well say that there are weasels, or their representatives, in every hole and corner of the earth.  With regard to the Polecats of America, they form a sort of link between the weasels and civets; and although there was long supposed to be but one kind--as in the case of the opossum--it is now ascertained that there are several distinct species, with an endless list of varieties.  The _Water Weasels_, or _Otters_, are not so numerous either in species or individuals--though there are at least a dozen of them in all, and they are widely distributed over the world.  In Britain, there is but one--the Common or European otter; and in North America, a very similar species was supposed, until recently, to be the only one inhabiting that continent.  The rivers of California, however, have presented us with a second, known as the Californian otter; and the singular Sea otter, whose beautiful fur is so prized under the name of Sea otter, is also an animal inhabiting the coasts of California--as it does most part of the western seaboard of the American continent.  The Grey otter is a South African animal, and in India we have the Wargul; while in the rivers of Nepaul--a country so rich in mammalia-- there is the Golden brown otter.  China, in common with other Indo-Chinese"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23576"],["title","Quadrupeds, What They Are and Where Found: A Book of Zoology for Boys (#5)"],["body"," countries, possesses the Chinese otter; and South America has the Brazilian Contra, and in all probability several other species.  With regard to the _Civet-Weasels_--or Civet Cats, as they are commonly called--there is a still greater variety, both in genera and species: so many, indeed, that, as already stated, they have been arranged in a family by themselves.  They may be regarded, however, as large weasels, distinguished from the others by their having a sort of pouch or gland under the tail, in which is secreted an unctuous and highly odorous substance.  This, in some species, as in the true civets, is relished as a perfume or scent, while in others it is an extremely disagreeable odour.  The true civet is a native of North Africa; where it is kept in a tame state, for the purpose of obtaining from it the well-known perfume of commerce.  An allied species, the Rasse, belongs to Java--and is there also kept in cages for the same purpose--while in Asia--from Arabia to Malabar, and among the Malays and Arabs of Borneo, Macassar, and other islands of the Indian Archipelago--still another species of civet affords a similar perfumed substance.  The Aard Wolf (earth wolf) of South Africa is usually classed among the civets, but with very slight reason.  It is far more like the hyena; and is certainly nothing else than a hyena.  The Delundung of Java is a creature that bears a resemblance to the civets; and may be regarded as forming a link between these and the true cats.  The Genets constitute a division of the civet-weasel tribe; and one of which there are numerous species.  They are usually pretty spotted creatures, with immensely long tails; and but for their cruel and sanguinary habits would, no doubt, be favourites.  They exist in South Europe; and, under different forms and appellations, extend over all Africa to Madagascar and the Cape--as well as through the countries of Southern Asia and the Asiatic islands.  The Ichneumons claim our attention next.  These are celebrated animals, on account of the strange and fabulous tales related of the species known as the Egyptian ichneumon, which, among the people of Egypt, is domesticated, and was once held as a sacred animal.  Besides the Egyptian ichneumon, there are several other species in Africa--one belonging to Abyssinia, and no less than six to the countries near the Cape.  The Garangan of Java is an ichneumon; and so also are the Mongoos and Nyula of Nepaul; while in the Malay peninsula is a species known as the Malacca ichneumon.  The Paradoxure is usually classed with the civets, though it wants the perfumed pouch; and the Suricate or Meer-cat, of the Cape colonists, takes its station in this group.  A badger-like animal of Madagascar, the Mangu, is also regarded as a civet: so, too, are the Coatis of the New World, though these last are evidently of much nearer kin to the badgers.  Perhaps the curious creature known as the Potto, or Kinkajou, has more pretensions to a place among the civets: at all events, it deserves one in the general group of the weasels.    CHAPTER SIX.  TAME DOGS.  Perhaps of all other animals the dog has been the earliest and most constant companion of man.  His swiftness and strength, but more especially his highly-developed power of smelling, have made him a powerful ally against the other animals; and these qualities must have attracted the attention of man at an early period--particularly in those times when the chase was, perhaps, the only pursuit of mankind.  No animal is more widely distributed over the earth.  He has followed man everywhere; and wherever human society exists, there this constant and faithful attendant may be found--devoted to his master, adopting his manners, distinguishing and defending his property, and remaining attached to him even after death.  It is a question among naturalists as to what was the parent stock of the dog.  Some allege that he has sprung from the wolf; others that he is a descendant of the jackal; while not a few believe that there were true wild dogs, from which the present domesticated race had their origin.  These ideas are mere speculations, and not very reasonable ones either.  It would not be difficult to show, that different kinds of dogs have sprung from different kinds of animals--that is, animals of the same great family--from wolves, foxes, jackals, zerdas, and even hyenas. This can be proved from the fact, that domesticated breeds among savage tribes, both in Asia and America, are undoubtedly the descendants of wolves and jackals: such, for instance, as the Esquimaux dog of the Arctic regions, the Dingo of Australia, the Indian dogs of North America--of which there are several varieties--and also one or two kinds existing in Mexico and South America.  Naturalists deny that there are any true dogs living in a wild state. This is simply an unreasonable assertion.  Wild dogs of several species are to be met with in Asia and America; and if it be asserted that these originally came from a domesticated stock, the same cannot be said of the hunting dog of Southern Africa--which is neither more nor less than a _wild hound_.  Perhaps none of the animals that have submitted to the conquest of man have branched off into a greater number of varieties than this one. There are more kinds than either of horses or oxen.  We shall not, therefore, attempt a description of each; but limit ourselves to speak of those breeds that are the most remarkable--or rather those with which the reader is supposed to be least familiar.  To describe such varieties as the spaniel, the greyhound, the mastiff, or the terrier, would not add much to the knowledge which the English reader already possesses.  One of the most remarkable of dogs is the huge mastiff of Tibet.  He is long-haired, and usually of a jet black colour.  He is quite a match in size for either the Newfoundland or San Bernard breeds, and not unlike one or the other--for it may be remarked, that these in many points resemble each other.  The Tibet dog, as his name implies, is the property of the Tibetians: especially the Bhootees--the same people who own that curious species of cattle, the _Yak_, or grunting ox, and who reside on the northern slopes of the Himalaya mountains.  It may be inferred, therefore, that the Tibet dog affects a cold climate; and such is in reality the case.  He cannot bear heat; and does not thrive, even in the kingdom of Nepaul. Attempts to introduce the breed into England have resulted in failure: the animals brought hither having died shortly after their arrival.  The masters of these dogs--the Bhootees, or Bhoteas, are a singular race, of a ruddy copper colour, rather short in stature, but of excellent disposition.  Their clothing consists of furs and woollen cloths, adapted to the cold climate which they inhabit.  The men till the ground, and keep yaks and sheep, and sometimes come down into the warm plains to trade--penetrating even to Calcutta.  The women remain at home, their only protectors being these great dogs, who watch faithfully over their villages and encampments, and fly fiercely at any stranger who may approach them.  It is said that they are especially hostile to people who have a _white_ face; but this disposition is also characteristic of the dogs belonging to the American Indians--and perhaps those possessed by all savages with a coloured skin.  The Dingo, or dog of Australia, is an animal domesticated among the aborigines of that country.  He is a dog of wolf-like shape, who does not bark, but utters only a mournful howling.  He is used by the wretched natives both for the chase and as an article of food; and is a fierce and voracious creature--not hesitating to launch himself on the larger kinds of animals.  He is especially employed in hunting the kangaroo; and sometimes terrible combats occur between the dingo and the larger species of kangaroos--resulting always in the death of the latter.  The San Bernard dog, supposed to be a cross between the mastiff and shepherd's dog, is too celebrated to require a description here.  His sagacity in discovering travellers amid the Alpine snows, and guiding them upon their path, is the quality upon which the fame of this dog has been founded; but it may be remarked that many of the feats attributed to him have their origin in the fertile fancies of Parisian writers.  The Esquimaux dog is another celebrated variety.  He is an animal with a fox-like face and thick coat of whitish hair, generally tinged with yellow.  He is to the Esquimaux a most valuable companion: trained to draw their sledges over the surface of the snow, and enabling them to make long and rapid journeys--without which these singular people would be ofttimes in danger of perishing amid the inhospitable regions they inhabit.  The Indians of North America possess two or three varieties of domesticated dogs, evidently derived from the wolves of that region. Indeed, the common Indian dogs, found among the Sioux and other northern tribes, bear so close a resemblance to the large American wolf, that they are often taken for this animal, and in consequence shot, or otherwise killed by mistake.  The Indians use them for carrying burdens: their tents and tent poles being transported by these animals on long journeys across the prairies.  Their flesh is a favourite article of the savage _cuisine_; but it is too costly to be used as an every-day food; and is only served up on grand festive occasions.  Like the dogs of Tibet, these Indian wolf dogs have the greatest antipathy to a white skin; so much so, that even a friend in that guise can rarely obtain either their confidence or friendship.  A smaller kind than the common one is found among certain tribes, and appears to have derived its origin from the prairie wolf--the jackal of America--while the Hare Indians of the Rocky Mountains possess a third variety; and it is known that still another exists among the tribes of Russian America."]]]
