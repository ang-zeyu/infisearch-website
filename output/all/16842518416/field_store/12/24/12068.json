He even admitted that it worked for him every time--  And what was wrong, pray, with _that_?  Thursby knew he was licked. He'd known it for a long time. His summation to the jury showed it. The expressions on the faces of the jury as they listened showed it.  They brought in a verdict of Not Guilty.         *       *       *       *       *  When I got back to my office, I picked up the phone and called the Golden Casino. I asked for George Brockey, the manager. When I got him on the phone and identified myself, he said, \"Oh. It's you.\" His voice didn't sound friendly.  \"It's me,\" I said.  \"I suppose you're going to slap a suit for false arrest on the Casino now, eh, counselor?\"  \"Not a bit of it, George,\" I said. \"The thought occurred to me, but I think we can come to terms.\"  \"Yeah?\"  \"Nothing to it, George. You give us the three hundred grand and we don't do a thing.\"  \"Yeah?\" He didn't get it. He had to fork over the money anyway, according to the court order, so what was the deal?  \"If you want to go a little further, I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll give you one of our little good luck charms, if you'll promise to call your boys off Howley.\"  \"Nobody's on Howley,\" he said. \"You ought to know better than that. In this state, if we get whipped in court, we play it square. Did you think we were going to get rough?\"  \"No. But you kind of figured on lifting that gadget as soon as he gets it back from the D.A., didn't you? I saw your boys waiting at his hotel. I'm just telling you that you don't have to do that. We'll give you the gadget. There are plenty more where that came from.\"  \"I see,\" Brockey said after a long pause. \"O.K., counselor. It's a deal.\"  \"Fine. We'll pick up the money later this evening, if that's O.K.\"  \"Sure, counselor. Anytime. Anytime at all.\" He hung up.  I grinned at Howley, who was sitting across the desk from me. \"Well, that winds it up.\"  \"I don't get it,\" Howley said. \"Why'd you call up Brockey? What was the purpose of that 'deal'?\"  \"No deal,\" I told him. \"I was just warning him that killing you and taking the gadget wouldn't do any good, that we've covered you. He won't bother having anything done to you if he knows that the secret of the gadget is out already.\"  Howley's eyes widened behind those spectacles of his. \"You mean they'd kill me? I thought Nevada gamblers were honest.\"  \"Oh, they are, they are. But this is a threat to their whole industry. It's more than that, it may destroy them. Some of them might kill to keep that from happening. But you don't have to worry now.\"  \"Thanks. Tell me, do you think we've succeeded?\"  \"In what you set out to do? Certainly. When we mail out those gadgets to people all over the state, the place will be in an uproar. With all the publicity this case is getting, it'll _have_ to work. You now have a court decision on your side, a decision which says that a psionic device can be legally used to influence gambling games.  \"Why, man, they'll _have_ to start investigating! You'll have every politico in the State of Nevada insisting that scientists work on that thing. To say nothing of what the syndicate will do.\"  \"All I wanted to do,\" said Howley, \"was force people to take notice of psionics. I guess I've done that.\"  \"You certainly have, brother. I wonder what it will come to?\"  \"I wonder, myself, sometimes,\" Howley said.  That was three and a half years ago. Neither Howley nor I are wondering now. According to the front page of today's _Times_, the first spaceship, with a crew of eighty aboard, reached Mars this morning. And, on page two, there's a small article headlined: ROCKET OBSOLETE, SAY SCIENTISTS.  It sure is."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23540"],["title","The Twin Cousins (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

I'll give you a _thou_-sand kisses if you'll lemme have a party!\"  Auntie Prim looked as if one kiss would be more than she could bear. She was standing by the pantry window that opened upon the garden, rolling out pie-crust, and didn't like to be disturbed. She was a very good woman, but she _never_ liked to be disturbed.  \"Party?\" said she, gazing sternly at Flaxie Frizzle and her little cousin Milly. \"Saturday morning, and your mother gone, too! I should think this was a queer time for a party!\"  Flaxie rolled her apron over at the corners and chewed it.  \"Well, 'cause it's my birthday, and my mamma said--\"  \"Yes, and her grammy said--\" Little Milly got as far as this and then stopped. Flaxie was her darling \"twin cousin,\" and she wanted to help her; but that tall lady with the rolling-pin was just dreadful.  \"Oh, now I remember,\" said Mrs. Prim, paring off the dough around the edge of a pie. \"Your mother did say, if you were a good girl all the week, you might have a few children here to tea. But _have_ you been a good girl, Mary Gray?\" added she, with a look through her spectacles that pierced her little niece to the soul.  \"Yes um,\" replied Flaxie, gazing down at her boots. \"Only once, you know, you had to set me on the shelf behind the stove.\"  \"Very true. So you see you _were_ naughty. What did you do?\"  \"Meddled,\" said Flaxie in a low voice, with another nibble at her apron.  Mrs. Prim smiled a very small smile, but it was behind her lips, where the children could not see it.  \"Well, Mary, perhaps you have been as good as could reasonably be expected under the circumstances.\"  Poor little Milly couldn't help feeling as if _she_ were the \"circumstances,\" or why did those spectacles shine straight upon her?  \"And I suppose you must have the party.\"  Flaxie gave a scream of delight, and caught Mrs. Prim round the waist.  \"O you darling, darling auntie!\"  \"There, there; don't smother me, or I can't cook your supper. What do you want?\"  \"Oh, _may_ I have what I want? _Pinnuts_ and peaches, and candy and preserves, and jelly and choclids, and oranges and _everything_?\"  \"No, you absurd child, not everything; but whatever is most suitable and proper,--if you will only run away out of my sight, you and Milly. But go first and tell your grandmother to send Dora to me.\"  \"Grammy's quilting a quilt, and Dodo's quilting a quilt; but I'll tell 'em to come.\"  \"No, no; I only want Dora.\"  \"That child can't be trusted to do the smallest errand correctly,\" thought Auntie Prim, taking down the cook-book, with a sigh, and looking at the recipes for cake. Her husband was in Canada, and she had kindly offered to spend a month or so at Dr. Gray's while his wife went away for her health. This would have been very pleasant, only Julia went with her mother, and little Flaxie was always troublesome without Julia.  Mrs. Prim had said that morning to Dora that she would go into the pantry and make three apple-pies, for she knew how to make them better than Dora; and then she must finish writing her lecture on Ancient History. And now Flaxie Frizzle had come and asked for a party! Mrs. Prim was called a \"superior woman,\" and knew more than almost anybody else in town except the minister; but she did think children very trying, and their parties \"perfectly absurd.\" Besides, Flaxie wasn't her own niece.  \"O auntie, auntie!\" cried the little tease, coming back again, with Milly at her heels, \"we've got to go and invite 'em!\"  \"Certainly; and why don't you go, then?\"  \"Don' know how; please tell us how,\" said Flaxie, clutching Mrs. Prim by the skirt, and wishing there was a hinge in that lady somewhere, so she could bend.  \"Don't know how? Just go to the houses, child, and ask the little girls' mothers.\"  \"O auntie, we don't want the little girls' mothers!\"  \"No, no; ask the mothers to let their little daughters come here to tea; that's what I mean.\"  Then Auntie Prim made out a list of ten little girls, for the table would seat twelve, and she wanted the party large enough to please Flaxie. She thought she would make some of her own delicious tarts and a nice sponge roll, and Dora might mix White Mountain cake and boil a tongue. Mrs. Prim meant to be very kind, though she was sure, if she had had any little girls of her own, they would never have had any parties!  \"Now, be sure to say I want the children to come early--at half-past two.\"  \"Yes um!\" And the little messengers danced out of the house.  \"Flaxie,\" said Mrs. Prim, rapping on the pantry window with the egg-beater, \"are you sure you heard what I said?\"  \"Yes um.\"  \"What time did I set?\"  \"Ha' pas' two.\"  \"Very well.--And I shall be thankful when it is over,\" sighed the poor lady, taking down the spice-box.  But wasn't it gay times for the twin cousins, who had all the fun and none of the worry! I wish I were a little girl, just going to have a party, don't you? They didn't stop to look at the beautiful trees, with their bright October leaves, or at the sky, with its soft white clouds; they hopped along, their arms around each other's waist, keeping time to the happy thoughts in their hearts.  \"Oh, Milly, aren't you glad you came to my house visiting?\"  Milly was very glad to-day; she had not been glad yesterday, when they had the trouble about their dolls.  The first house was General Townsend's; and when Mrs. Townsend came to the door, Milly hid behind a lilac-bush; but Flaxie, who was never afraid of anybody, looked up with her laughing blue eyes, and said, without stopping for 'How d'ye do?'--  \"Oh, Mrs. Townsend, I'm goin' to have a party six years old, and mayn't Fanny come? Auntie Prim says for the children to come early,--at ha' pas' two,--and she'll be _thankful_ when it's over.\"  Mrs. Townsend could not possibly help smiling at this remarkable speech, but she replied that Fanny might go.  \"Now, Flaxie Frizzle,\" said Mabel, as the door closed, \"you oughtn't to say your auntie'll be 'thankful'; it isn't polite.\"  \"Yes it is. I guess Auntie Prim knows; she knows everything. But 'fore I'd run and hide!\" retorted Flaxie.  There wasn't any lilac-bush at the next house, and Milly had to stand on the door-stone and hide under her hat.  It was surprising how fast Flaxie said it over: \"I'm goin' to have a party six years old,\" &c., without skipping a word; and though Milly had her doubts about the politeness of Mrs. Prim's being so \"thankful,\" she did think Flaxie Frizzle was a wonderful girl; and indeed Flaxie thought so too.  \"What, back so soon?\" said Auntie Prim, who had scarcely missed the children before they appeared again at the pantry-door, rosy with running.  \"Yes um; I've invited 'em all up.\"  Flaxie said \"I\" with quite an air.  \"Possible? I wonder if you did it correctly. What did you say?\"  \"I said,\" replied Miss Frizzle, proud to have made no mistakes this time, \"I said, 'I'm goin' to have a party six years old, and Auntie Prim says for the children to come early,--at ha' pas' two,--and she'll be _thankful_ when it's over.'\"  \"You didn't!\" cried auntie, the color flying into her pale face, and her spectacles shining like diamonds.  \"Well, I never!\" said Dora, and sat right down by the oven-door to laugh. \"But they do say, children and fools always speak the truth!\"  Mrs. Prim resolved to keep calm, but this was very trying.  \"Mary Gray,\" said she, pressing her hands together quite sticky with dough, \"I didn't mean you to repeat the last part of that speech; I didn't even know you had heard it. It does seem to me you are old enough to have a _little_ sense of propriety. What can those ladies think of me? What can they think of _you_? I shouldn't blame them if they didn't let their children come, after such an invitation as that!\"  Flaxie hung her head. What had _she_ done so very wrong? She could never bear to be blamed; and I must relate that she was rude enough to slip out of the house while her aunt was still speaking, followed by Milly.  \"She thinks children are goosies, and hates to hear 'em talk,\" said she, the tears dripping over her apron.  \"I'm drefful 'shamed; aren't you?\" said little Milly.  \"Yes, I 'spect we've done something _orful_,\" returned Flaxie.  You will observe that she said \"we\" this time, quite willing Milly should have a full share of the blame.  \"I can't stan' it, Milly Allen, folks laughing at us so! Did you see Dodo laughing and laughing and laughing?\"  \"Yes, I did. She shook all over, and said children were fools.\"  \"My mamma wouldn't 'low her to say that,\" sobbed Flaxie. \"And nobody comin' to our"]]]
