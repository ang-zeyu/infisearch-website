It may lose you your job.\"  \"I don't care if it does,\" returned Hal, whose rage had not yet cooled. \"Corcoran may fire me if he wants to. But he isn't going to bully any girl as he bullied Susie Mayo--not when I'm round.\"  \"But don't you see, dear; we can't afford to lose our jobs,\" continued his sister gently. \"Too much depends on our keeping them. We must have the money.\"  \"I'm not worrying,\" laughed Hal with confidence. \"If Corcoran should give me the sack I could get another place without any trouble, I'll bet I could.\"  \"Places are not so easy to find,\" asserted the more prudent Louise. \"There are lots of men in Baileyville who have been out of work for months. You ought not to be in such a hurry to rush into a quarrel, Hal.\"  \"I was right; you say so yourself.\"  \"Yes, perhaps so. Still----\"  \"Don't you think somebody ought to have called Corcoran down?\"  \"Of course he was unfair and--and rude.\"  \"Rude!\" interrupted her brother scornfully, \"he was contemptible, outrageous!\"  \"I know it. But----\"  \"If fewer people stood for brutes there would be fewer brutes in the world.\"  \"It isn't our business to round Corcoran up.\"  \"It is my business to stop any man who is impolite to a woman,\" replied Hal. \"Besides, Corcoran knew well enough he was wrong. You notice he did not put up any defense. He just walked off and has never mentioned the affair since.\"  \"That is what frightens me.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"I'm afraid he isn't through.\"  \"Nonsense! He's through all right. He hasn't uttered a yip and it is now over two weeks ago that the thing happened. Quit your worrying, kiddie. There'll be no comeback from Corcoran.\"  The reassuring words, so confidently spoken, did much to allay Louise's fears. Uneventfully the days slipped by, and with every one that passed the boy and girl breathed more freely. Not only were they skilled workers but they were earnest and ambitious to give of their best. Moreover they had behind them an untarnished record for faithful attendance at the mills. Such service, argued they, must be of value, and when matched against much of the grudging, incompetent labor about them should be of sufficient worth to keep them on Davis and Coulter's payroll. All they asked was fair play and to be judged on their merits. This demand seemed reasonable enough; but alas, the world is not always a just dealer and when on a Saturday morning not long before Christmas Louise Harling looked into her pay envelope a cry of dismay escaped her.  The fate she had feared had overtaken her. Davis and Coulter informed her that after the fifteenth of the month, which fell a week hence, the firm would not need her services.  Instantly two thoughts rushed to her mind. One was whether Hal had also received similar notice; and the other was that all the holiday plans she had so fondly cherished must now go by the boards. She would have no money to buy presents or a Christmas dinner. The holiday season was a dreadful time of year to be without a penny. Try as she would to conceal her disappointment her lip trembled.  When Hal met her that night and they started home she could hardly utter a syllable. It was not alone her own trouble that depressed her. She longed and yet dreaded to hear what had befallen her brother. Were a calamity like hers to come to him then indeed had misfortune descended upon the Harling household. How would the invalid mother and the feeble old grandfather get on without money? How would medicines be procured? Or the rent be paid?  Hal, however, was to all appearances his serene self. He talked and jested quite in his usual manner and if he were keeping something back he certainly succeeded in doing so to perfection. Perhaps, argued she, he had not been discharged at all. If not, why should this disgrace have come to her? For in a measure it was a disgrace. When you lost your job in the mill all Baileyville knew it and discussed the circumstances, weighing the justice or injustice of the act. Certainly, thought Louise to herself, she had toiled as faithfully as she knew how. Had there been fault with her work at least she was not conscious of it. It was mortifying, galling, to be turned away without a word of explanation.  \"What's the matter, Sis?\" Hal questioned, at last noticing that his chatter failed to elicit its usual a gay response.  Louise hesitated, shrinking from putting her tidings into words.  \"You look as if you'd seen a ghost, old girl,\" smiled her brother facetiously. \"What's up?\"  \"I've been--they don't want----\"  Hal halted, aghast.  \"You don't mean to say they've asked you to quit?\"  \"Yes.\"  The boy's eyes blazed.  \"It's Corcoran, the cur! He's done it to get back at me for what I said to him.\"  \"You think so?\"  \"Sure!\"  \"But why choose me? I had nothing to do with the squabble.\"  \"That's just the point. He's smart enough to know it would hit me a darn sight harder to have you lose your job than to lose my own,\" blustered her brother wrathfully.  \"I wish I was sure it was only that.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because then I wouldn't care so much. I should know there was nothing the matter with my work.\"  \"Of course there isn't. You're one of the best operators they've got in the mill. Hines, one of the bosses, told me so only the other day.\"  \"Really?\" The girl's face brightened. \"Why didn't you tell me?\"  \"Oh, I don't know. Forgot it, I guess,\" smiled Hal. It was not his way to pass on compliments. Had the criticism been adverse he would have told it quickly enough.  \"Well, I'm awfully glad he said so.\"  \"Yes, it was very decent of him. Everybody knows though that you're a fine worker--even old Corcoran himself, I'll be bound, although he wouldn't admit it. You're quick, careful, prompt and never absent. What else do they want? Oh, Corcoran was behind this, all right. It wasn't your work sacked you. It was plain spite.\"  \"I'm thankful for that!\" sighed Louise.  \"I'm not. It makes me hot,\" burst out Hal.  \"Still, it is better than losing your place because your work was so poor you couldn't hold the job,\" smiled the girl.  \"I can't see it that way. This is just low down and unfair.\"  \"But I don't mind that. I know I wasn't to blame.\"  \"You bet you weren't. I wish I had Corcoran here. I'd shake the daylights out of him.\"  \"Whose daylights are going to be shaken out now?\" inquired a laughing voice, and the brother and sister turned to see Carl McGregor beside them.  \"Old Corcoran up at the works,\" snarled Hal. \"He's given Louise the sack!\"  Carl did not speak. He knew only too well how genuine was this disaster. In the sympathetic silence that followed the three young persons seemed to draw closer together.  \"It isn't as if Loulie had done anything to deserve such a slam,\" Hal suddenly declared. \"He's just taking out his spite on me and he's chosen this means of doing it. To light on a woman! I'd a hundred times rather he'd shipped me. But it's like him.\"  Moodily the three walked on.  \"Of course, I must get some other place right away,\" Louise said presently, as if thinking aloud. \"I don't know just what. I've never worked anywhere but in the mills and I have no other trade. To be turned away from Davis and Coulter won't be much of a recommendation for me either, I'm afraid.\"  \"Oh, you can get a hundred jobs,\" announced Hal, with a confidence he did not feel. \"Don't you fret.\"  \"I don't know.\" His sister shook her head. \"Scores of Baileyville girls are idle.\"  The statement met with no denial. Who could combat it? It was only too true.  \"Not girls like you,\" Carl ventured, determined to be optimistic.  \"Girls exactly like me, Carlie,\" smiled Louise.  \"Oh, you won't be idle,\" murmured Hal.  \"I can't be--I simply can't. We've got to have money.\"  Once again her companions found themselves unable to refute the declaration.  They had turned into the main thoroughfare of the town and were threading their way along a sidewalk teeming with the throng of Saturday shoppers that is such a characteristic part of the life of a mill town. The street beside them was black with trucks, motor cars, and the congested traffic of a manufacturing center.  Suddenly there was a cry from Carl.  \"Jove!\" exclaimed he. \"Look at that kid!\"  In his horror he put out his hand to clutch his friend's arm. But his fingers closed on empty air.  Hal Harling was gone!  What followed happened so quickly that it was more like the shiftings of a moving picture than an incident in real life.  Hal bounded into the seething maelstrom of the street, caught up a little boy midway in the stream of rushing vehicles and held him aloft in safety.  The baby had obviously been pursuing a small black puppy whose dangling leash told a story of escape from captivity. Making the most of his freedom the dog had run recklessly along and the child had dashed after him, too intent on recapturing his pet to heed whither the chase took him. It was little short of a miracle that he had not been killed and for his rescue from such a fate he had the quick wit of Hal Harling to thank.  A second later all passing on the street had stopped and crowds of spectators surged around the young hero. Above the tense stillness could be heard Hal's comforting voice:  \"Sure we'll find your dog for you, little chap. Don't cry. You say he's called Midget. That's a fine name for a dog, isn't it? See! Somebody over there on the sidewalk has him already. We'll go and get him.\"  As the two chubby arms closed about Hal's neck into the center of the crowd catapulted a frenzied nursemaid who madly rushed up to young Harling.  \"He's not hurt a mite,\" Hal announced, reassuringly. \"I guess he ran away from you, didn't he?\"  \"He was leading the dog and the leash slipped out of his hands,\" gasped the affrighted girl. \"Before I'd a notion what he was going to do he was off after the puppy. I'm weak as a rag. If anything had happened to him----\"  \"But it didn't,\" smiled Hal.  \"No,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23560"],["title","Carl and the Cotton Gin (#6)"],["body","to you, and to the good Lord!\"  Then, seizing the child in her arms, she said:  \"There, Billie, you see what comes of running out of the yard after Midget. You might have been killed but for this kind gentleman.\"  \"Indeed he might! He would have been. I saw the whole thing myself,\" broke in a policeman who had joined the group.  \"I'm glad he's all right,\" reiterated Hal, as he gave the child into the maid's care.  A man approached leading Midget and interest being for the moment diverted from himself Hal made his escape.  In a doorway he spied Louise and Carl.  \"Oh, it was wonderful of you, Hal!\" his sister murmured.  \"It was just lucky,\" Hal returned a bit gruffly. \"Come on! Let's get out of this push. We'll be late for supper if we don't hike along.\"  And it was characteristic of Hal Harling that this was the only allusion he made to the adventure.     CHAPTER IV  PROBLEMS   Although temporarily buoyed up by the episode of the afternoon Carl McGregor returned home with spirits at a lower ebb than they had been for many a day. To be out of work was a very real tragedy in the world in which he lived. He knew only too well how indispensable was money and that the necessity of it was even greater in the Harling home than in his own. The Harlings, alas, had no absent Uncle Frederick to fall back upon. On the contrary the entire upkeep of their home and family fell upon the young shoulders of the boy and girl who toiled at the spinning mills. Now with Louise out of the race Hal would be left alone with all the burden, and whether he would be able to carry so heavy a one was a question. Undoubtedly he would not be forced to bear it for long. Louise would find employment--she must find it. Did not the need compel it? And was she not far too capable a worker to be out of a place? Why, scores of people would seek her help eagerly when once it was known her assistance was available.  Sound as these arguments were, however, facts did not bear them out. Apparently nobody in Baileyville wished help, no matter how excellent its quality. Every night the report from the Harlings was the same--Louise could find nothing to do. Even Mrs. McGregor who was ordinarily able to straighten out every sort of tangle had no remedy for the present pitiable dilemma. The only employment it was in her power to secure for the girl was fine sewing and Louise, restricted by her factory training, could not sew. A week went by and still nothing presented itself. Mrs. Harling and the aged grandfather, from whom the calamity had been kept as long as it was possible to conceal it, at length took up the worry.  \"Whatever is going to become of us now?\" bewailed each in turn. \"Where's the food and rent coming from?\"  Hal fidgeted.  Every day he looked more harrowed and distressed, and the smile that had formerly come so spontaneously came now with an effort. He had taken on an extra job evenings, that of delivery boy for the local grocer. It did not bring in much, to be sure, and it kept him on his feet at the end of the day when often he was too tired to stand. However, all these disadvantages were lost sight of in the few additional dollars derived from the makeshift.  \"Mother says you can't keep this up, old chap,\" remarked Carl dismally. \"She says you will be getting tired out and sick and then where will you be?\"  \"But we've got to have the cash, kid! _Got to have it_, don't you see? It was I who landed us in this plight and I'm the one to get us out. It's nobody's fault but mine.\"  Carl sighed.  \"I suppose Corcoran wouldn't----\"  \"Take Louise back if I were to humble myself,\" flared Hal. \"Do you think for a moment I'd ask him? Do you imagine I'd gratify him by letting him know how hard he'd hit us? Not on your life! For all he knows the Harlings are rich as mud and don't care a hurrah for his old job. I want him to think that too. If he pictures me eating out of his hand he's mistaken.\"  Carl looked grave.  \"It is all very well to be proud,\" affirmed he, smiling at his friend's characteristic attitude of mind. \"But sometimes you can't afford to be too cocky. If, as you say, you pitched into Corcoran and were wrong----\"  \"But I wasn't wrong,\" broke in Hal. \"I meant every word I said; it was the truth and I'd say it again if I got the chance. You'd have said the same yourself if you'd been there. The thing that got his goat was that it was true.\"  \"But you can't go round telling people the truth about themselves, old man,\" observed Carl with a wisdom far beyond his years. \"They won't stand for it.\"  \"I'll bet I would. I'd a darn sight rather a person told me straight to my face what he thought of me than whispered it behind my back.\"  \"That's what I'm trying to do now,\" grinned Carl.  Young Harling's lips curved into a smile.  \"Why, so you are, kid,\" returned he. \"I didn't recognize the stunt at first. You're a mighty white little chap, Carl. Maybe I was wrong to light into Corcoran as I did. Of course he is my superior and I really had no business to sarse him, even if he was wrong. But he is such a cad! It made my blood boil to hear him berate that poor little Mayo girl--and for something she did not do, too.\"  \"I know.\"  \"Well, if you were in this mess what would you do? Come now. Give me some of your sage advice.\"  \"You don't suppose you ought to go to----\"  \"Corcoran and apologize?\" interrupted Hal hotly. \"No, I don't. I'd starve before I'd do that.\"  \"But how about your grandfather, your mother, and Louise?\"  \"I shan't let them starve, if that's what you mean. You can bet your life on that,\" cried Hal. \"If anybody goes without it will be myself.\"  \"You seem to be doing it all right.\"  \"How do you know?\"  \"Don't you suppose I've eyes in my head? You're thin as a rail already.\"  \"Huh! That's only because I've been chasing round with bundles. I was too fat, anyway; didn't get enough exercise at the mills.\"  \"Hal Harling!\"  \"Straight goods, I didn't. Just stood and fed stuff into that loom from morning till night. You don't call that exercise, do you?\"  \"I noticed that by night you were often all in, exercise or no exercise,\" was the dry response. \"Well, you've got to go your own gait, I guess.\"  \"I'll bet a hat _you_ wouldn't go and bow down to Corcoran.\"  The thrust told.  \"Bow down to him? I'd crack his nut!\"  Hal chuckled with satisfaction at his chum's loyalty.  \"There you are, you see!\" declared he. \"You are every whit as rabid as I am when it comes to the scratch.\"  \"I'm afraid I'm more rabid when things hit you and Louise,\" murmured Carl.  The two walked on without speaking, the mind of each busy with the problem in hand.  Carl's imagination circled every mad avenue of escape from the Harlings' financial crisis. If only he were rich! If only somebody would suddenly leave him some money! If only--his brain halted in the midst of its absurd gyrations.  If he were not rich; if he had no fairy fortune to pass over to Hal and Louise, what was to hinder him from performing for them a far more genuine service of friendship and affection? Instead of offering them money that was dropped into his hand why should he not test out his real regard for them by earning it? Many a boy his age, aye, younger than he, earned money. Why should he be free of responsibility when Hal, who was only a few years older, was weighed down with it?  Just why it had never occurred to him that if he earned money he might with propriety hand it over to his own hard-working mother is a question. Often with eyes fixed on the clouds we lose sight of the things just beneath our noses. Perhaps that was the explanation of Carl's lack of thought. Be that as it may, certain it was that he parted from his chum afire with the generous impulse of making a personal effort to reinforce the Harlings' slender income.  He was only a stone's throw from home and what led him to turn the other way, pass into Beaver Street, and go south toward Orient Avenue he could not have told. Possibly he was still thrilling with newly awakened altruism and was not yet ready to have his roseate dreams disturbed. Or he may have been pondering so deeply how to put his impulses into action that he failed to heed just where he was going. At any rate before he realized it there he was in the fashionable section of the village, walking along between rows of bare and stately elms and great rambling houses glimpsed from behind high brick walls.  He had not been in this part of Baileyville for months. There was nothing to take him there. What connection had his life with those fortunate lives that made leisure and luxury things to be taken for granted? Even now he started at finding himself in a location so incongruous; or rather at finding so incongruous a person as himself in an environment so out of harmony with his thought and station.  He whirled about to start homeward and it was just at this instant that a trim racing car drew up beside him and a man's voice inquired pleasantly:  \"Lost your way, youngster?\"  Carl glanced at the speaker.  He was a gray-haired, clean-shaven man, with fresh color and keen blue eyes. Although muffled to the chin in a raccoon coat that almost met the fur of his cap there was a splendid vigor about him that breathed health, energy, and the rewards a temperate life brings. Everything about him seemed clearness personified--eye, complexion, voice.  \"I've not lost my way, thank you, sir,\" Carl answered. \"I just got to thinking and have wandered farther from home than I meant to.\"  \"Are you going back to town now?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Jump in and I'll give you a lift.\"  Raising the fur robes invitingly the stranger reached to open the door.  Carl was almost too surprised to speak.  \"You're very kind, sir,\" he contrived to stammer. \"I should be glad of a ride. I don't often get one. Besides, I ought to have been at home long ago.\"  The honesty of the reply apparently pleased the motorist for, smiling, he tucked the lad in and asked:  \"Where do you live?\"  \"At Mulberry Court, sir.\"  "]]]
