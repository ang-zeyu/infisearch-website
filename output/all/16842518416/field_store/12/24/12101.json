When wounded, or at bay, he will also defend himself against a human enemy; and there have been instances of hunters, both white and Indian, having succumbed to his strength.  His range extends over nearly the whole continent of America; but he more particularly affects the deep shadow of the forests; and, like the jaguar, he is a tree-climber.  He has no claim to the title of lion, except from some resemblance in colour; and no doubt it was this that led to his misnomer among the early settlers of Spanish America.  The Ounce comes next.  Of all the large cats this is the least known, either to naturalists or hunters.  We only know that such a species exists; that it is a native of Western Asia (Persia, and perhaps Arabia); that it is an animal nearly as large as the leopard or panther, but of stouter build and clumsier shape; that it is covered with long woolly hair of a pale-yellow colour, and spotted, not so distinctly as the true leopards, from which it is easily distinguished, both by its form and colour.  The name Ounce is from Buffon; but this specific appellation is also applied to the jaguar of America, the Jaguarundi, or lesser jaguar of Paraguay, and even to the Ocelot.  The _Rimau-dahan_ is one of the most beautiful species of cats.  It is of a yellowish ground colour, not spotted like the leopard, but marked with broad black bands and patches; in other words, clouded.  It is not so large as either of the species described.  It is a tree-climber, and lies in wait for its prey in the forks of the lower limbs, where it also goes to sleep.  From this habit it derives its name, _Dalian_; which, in the Sumatran language, signifies the fork of a tree.  Not unlike the _Rimau-dahan_, both in size and markings, is the Nepaul cat: a species, as its name imports, found in Nepaul, in the mountain forests.  The Serval is a spotted cat--black upon a pale-yellowish ground--and considerably larger than the domestic species.  It is a native of South Africa; and its skin is prized among the Kaffirs, for making their fur cloaks or _karosses_.  The Ocelot is about equal in size to the last-named, and equally prized for its beautiful skin, which is clouded with an admixture of spots and stripes upon a ground of yellowish-grey.  It belongs to Spanish America--more especially Mexico: and it is said to have been this animal that is represented on the hieroglyphical paintings of the ancient Aztecs.  More probably its nobler congener, the jaguar, which is also found in Mexico, is the animal that held this distinction in the land of Anahuac.  In Central and South America there are a great many species of striped and spotted cats, known generally as tiger cats.  The Ocelot is one of these; but there are also the Pampas cats, the Chati, the Jaguarundi, the Margay, the False Margay, and many others.  Numerous species, too, exist in the forests of India; as also in the great tropical islands of Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and the Philippines.  There is yet a section of the cat family to be described.  These are the lynxes, or cats with short tails and long ears--the latter erect, and at the tips pointing inward, or towards each other.  Of the _Lynxes_ three species are found in North America.  The largest of these is the Canada lynx, which in point of size approaches the smaller species of leopards.  The colour of this animal is of a reddish grey, with spots very indistinctly marked.  Its fur is long, and its skins form one of the principal articles of the Hudson's Bay trade.  The Canada lynx is not found so far south as the United States; but its place is there occupied by the Bay lynx--a smaller species, and one very similarly marked, except that the rufous tint on the back and sides of the latter is deeper, and the spots more pronounced.  Still further south is a third species, only made known to naturalists within the last few years.  It inhabits Texas, and is hence called the Texan lynx.  It is of a darker red than either of the preceding; but in other respects--size, shape, and habits--it is almost identical with the Bay lynx.  Both range to the Pacific.  Of the lynxes of the Old World, there is the common or European lynx, which is still found in several European countries; the Caracal, a native of Africa and part of Asia; the Booted lynx, also indigenous to both continents; the Chaus, belonging to the country of the Mahrattas; the Kattlo, a large species, of Northern Europe; the Nubian lynx, of North Africa; and the Southern lynx, a native of Spain.  It may be added that there is scarce one of these species of which there are not two or more varieties, known only to those who have made a study of the Kingdom of Nature.    CHAPTER NINE.  RATS AND OTHER RODENTS.  In this group we include not only Rats, but a great many other small rodents, or gnawers, such as Mice, Marmots, Lemmings, Hamsters, Mole-Rats, Jerboas, and Jumping Mice.  The Shrew-Mice and Moles may also be classed here--although naturalists separate them from rodents, because their food is not herbivorous, but consists of worms and insects.  For all that, there is a certain general resemblance, both as to appearance and habits, among all these small quadrupeds; which, for purposes of classification, is, perhaps, of more value than mere difference of food, or tubercles upon the teeth; especially, as it can be proved, that the sort of food an animal eats, is often dependent on the circumstances in which it may be placed.  Of the _Rats_, properly so called, there are numerous species, as well as varieties.  Their size is, in general, about the same as the Black and Norway rats--both of which belong to England, and have been introduced, by means of ships, into every country upon the habitable globe.  They are said to have come originally from Asia.  There is one species of rat, however, that is much larger than either of these--the Gigantic rat, found in Indian countries, and which in size quite equals a rabbit!  The habits of the rats are too well-known to require description. Some--as the Wood Rat and Florida Rat of America--dwell apart from the habitations of man, in the woods; where, instead of living in burrows, they construct large nests, by collecting together heaps of sticks, leaves, and grass.  _Mice_ may be regarded as only a smaller kind of rats; and of these there are many distinct species--both in the Old and New Worlds.  The _Marmots_ are, perhaps, the most interesting of the small rodents. They stand in a sort of connection with the squirrels, more especially the ground squirrels: on the other hand, they resemble rabbits; and they have still many points of identity with rats.  They belong to the northern zones of Europe, Asia, and America.  There are three or four species belonging to the Old World; and a great many to North America. Moreover there is a considerable difference in the habits of these species, which has led zoologists to separate them into several genera. One genus, called the Seed-eaters, is a very curious kind.  The marmots of this genus have a pair of pockets or pouches--one on the outside of each cheek--in which they actually carry seeds and other articles of food to their burrows.  These pouches, when filled, impart to the little creatures a most ludicrous appearance.  The marmots usually live in large communities--in burrows, as rabbits do.  These burrows are sometimes very extensive--especially so, in the case of the prairie marmot of America--better known as the Prairie Dog-- whose _villages_ sometimes cover an extent of many square miles; and whose odd social habits have been repeatedly and accurately described by late travellers who have crossed the American continent.  The _Mole-rats_ are a sort of combination between moles and rats: hence their common name.  One species is found in Eastern Russia; where it burrows much after the fashion of the mole--living principally upon roots.  Two other kinds belong to South Africa.  Both these are of large size, nearly as big as rabbits.  On the plains, they make extensive excavations, which often prove dangerous to the horse and his rider-- causing the former to stumble.  The Dutch of the Cape know them by the name of Sand Moles.  The _Hamsters_ differ considerably from the marmots in their mode of burrowing.  They make their underground dwellings very extensive--having a great many chambers and galleries.  In these they collect vast stores of food--consisting of grain, peas, and seeds of various kinds. Sometimes two or three bushels of provision will be found in the storehouse of a single family.  The hamsters do not confine themselves exclusively to a vegetable diet: since it is known that they will kill and eat birds, or even small quadrupeds.  In this respect they resemble the common rats; and, therefore, it is idle to talk of mere _herbivorous_ genera of animals.  The hamsters are very fierce little creatures: constantly fighting with other quadrupeds, and even among themselves; but the polecat is their master and tyrant, and carries on a war of extermination against them--following them through the intricate ways of their burrows, and destroying them even in their dens!  There are several species of hamsters in Europe and Asia, and also in North America: for the animal known as the Canada Pouched Rat is of this kind, and so also is the Tucan of Mexico.  So also is that very singular and beautiful creature, the Chinchilla of South America--so celebrated for its soft and valuable fur.  The _Lemmings_ are another form of small rodent animals, celebrated for their extraordinary migratory habit; which resembles that of the grey squirrels of North America.  There are several species of lemmings belonging to the northern section of the Old Continent--in Eastern Russia and Asia.  One or two are found in North America--in that part of it known as the Hudson's Bay Territory.  The _Spinous Rats_ are little animals much resembling ordinary rats; but with the peculiarity of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23580"],["title","The Children's Bible (#0)"],["body","CHILDREN'S BIBLE          SELECTIONS FROM THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS         TRANSLATED AND ARRANGED    BY   HENRY A.

These selections have been made as a result of more than twenty-five years of observation and study. The text is that of the Bible itself, but in the language of the child, so that it may easily be read to the younger children and by those who are older. It is not in words of one syllable, for while the child is reading the Bible he should gradually learn the meaning of new words and idioms.  The Bible contains the foundations on which the religious life of the child must be built. The immortal stories and songs of the Old and New Testaments are his richest inheritance from the past. To give him this heritage in language and form that he can understand and enjoy is the duty and privilege of his parents and teachers.  It is hoped that \"The Children's Bible\" will meet the need and the demand, which parents and educators alike have long felt and often expressed, for a simple translation of selections from the Bible most suited to the needs and the interests of the child. It is also believed that after the child has learned to appreciate and love these stories and songs, he will be eager and able to read the Bible as a whole with genuine interest and understanding.
