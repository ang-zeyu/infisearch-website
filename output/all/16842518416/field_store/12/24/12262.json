HOW TO MAKE BLACK WAX   When putting a wax finish on oak or any open-grained wood, the wax will often show white streaks in the pores of the wood. These streaks cannot be removed by rubbing or brushing. Prepared black wax can be purchased, but if you do not have any on hand, ordinary floor wax can be colored black. Melt the floor wax in a can placed in a bucket of hot water. When the wax has become liquid mix thoroughly into it a little drop black or lampblack. Allow the wax to cool and harden. This wax will not streak, but will give a smooth, glossy finish.     THE 40 STYLES OF CHAIRS   There are 40 distinct styles of chairs embracing the period from 3000 B.C. to 1900 A.D.--nearly 7,000 years. Of all the millions of chairs made during the centuries, each one can be classified under one or more of the 40 general styles shown in the chart. This chart was compiled by the editor of Decorative Furniture. The Colonial does not appear on the chart because it classifies under the Jacobean and other styles. A condensed key to the chart follows:       $Egyptian.--3000 B.C. to 500 B.C.$ Seems to have been derived      largely from the Early Asian. It influenced Assyrian and Greek      decorations, and was used as a motif in some French Empire      decoration. Not used in its entirety except for lodge rooms, etc.       $Grecian.--700 B.C. to 200 B.C.$ Influenced by Egyptian and      Assyrian styles. It had a progressive growth through the Doric,      Ionic and Corinthian periods. It influenced the Roman style and the      Pompeian, and all the Renaissance styles, and all styles following      the Renaissance, and is still the most important factor in      decorations today.       $Roman.--750 B.C. to 450 A.D.$ Rome took her art entirely from      Greece, and the Roman is purely a Greek development. The Roman      style \"revived\" in the Renaissance, and in this way is still a      prominent factor in modern decoration.       $Pompeian.--100 B.C. to 79 A.D.$ Sometimes called the Grecian-Roman      style, which well describes its components. The style we know as      Greek was the Greek as used in public structures. The Pompeian is      our best idea of Greek domestic decoration. Pompeii was long      buried, but when rediscovered it promptly influenced all European      styles, including Louis XVI, and the various Georgian styles.       $Byzantine.--300 A.D. to 1450 A.D.$ The \"Eastern Roman\" style,      originating in the removal of the capital of the Roman Empire to      Constantinople (then called Byzantium). It is a combination of      Persian and Roman. It influenced the various Moorish, Sacracenic      and other Mohammedan styles.       $Gothic.--1100 to 1550.$ It had nothing to do with the Goths, but      was a local European outgrowth of the Romanesque. It spread all      over Europe, and reached its climax of development about 1550. It      was on the Gothic construction that the Northern European and      English Renaissance styles were grafted to form such styles as the      Elizabethan, etc.   [Illustration]       $Moorish.--700 to 1600.$ The various Mohammedan styles can all be      traced to the ancient Persian through the Byzantine. The Moorish or      Moresque was the form taken by the Mohammedans in Spain.       $Indian.--2000 B.C. to 1906 A.D.$ The East Indian style is almost      composite, as expected of one with a growth of nearly 4,000 years.      It has been influenced repeatedly by outside forces and various      religious invasions, and has, in turn, influenced other far Eastern      styles.       $Chinese.--3500 B.C. to 1906 A.D.$ Another of the ancient styles.      It had a continuous growth up to 230 B.C., since when it has not      changed much. It has influenced Western styles, as in the      Chippendale, Queen Anne, etc.       $Japanese.--1200 B.C. to 1906 A.D.$ A style probably springing      originally from China, but now absolutely distinct. It has      influenced recent art in Europe and America, especially the \"New      Art\" styles.       $Italian Gothic.--1100 to 1500.$ The Italian Gothic differs from      the European and English Gothic in clinging more closely to the      Romanesque-Byzantine originals.       $Tudor.--1485 to 1558.$ The earliest entry of the Renaissance into      England. An application of Renaissance to the Gothic foundations.      Its growth was into the Elizabethan.       $Italian Renaissance, Fifteenth Century.--1400 to 1500.$ The birth      century of the Renaissance. A seeking for revival of the old Roman      and Greek decorative and constructive forms.       $Italian Renaissance, Sixteenth Century.--1500 to 1600.$ A period      of greater elaboration of detail and more freedom from actual Greek      and Roman models.       $Italian Renaissance, Seventeenth Century.--1600 to 1700.$ The      period of great elaboration and beginning of reckless      ornamentation.       $Spanish Renaissance.--1500 to 1700.$ A variation of the      Renaissance spirit caused by the combination of three distinct      styles--the Renaissance as known in Italy, the Gothic and the      Moorish. In furniture the Spanish Renaissance is almost identical      with the Flemish, which it influenced.       $Dutch Renaissance.--1500 to 1700.$ A style influenced alternately      by the French and the Spanish. This style and the Flemish had a      strong influence on the English William and Mary and Queen Anne      styles, and especially on the Jacobean.       $German Renaissance.--1550 to 1700.$ A style introduced by Germans      who had gone to Italy to study. It was a heavy treatment of the      Renaissance spirit, and merged into the German Baroque about 1700.       $Francis I.--1515 to 1549.$ The introductory period when the      Italian Renaissance found foothold in France. It is almost purely      Italian, and was the forerunner of the Henri II.       $Henri II.--1549 to 1610.$ In this the French Renaissance became      differentiated from the Italian, assuming traits that were      specifically French and that were emphasized in the next period.       $Louis XIII.--1616 to 1643.$ A typically French style, in which but      few traces of its derivation from the Italian remained. It was      followed by the Louis XIV.       $Elizabethan.--1558 to 1603.$ A compound style containing traces of      the Gothic, much of the Tudor, some Dutch, Flemish and a little      Italian. Especially noted for its fine wood carving.       $Jacobean.--1603 to 1689.$ The English period immediately following      the Elizabethan, and in most respects quite similar. The Dutch      influence was, however, more prominent. The Cromwellian, which is      included in this period, was identical with it.       $William and Mary.--1689 to 1702.$ More Dutch influences. All      furniture lighter and better suited to domestic purposes.   [Illustration]        $Queen Anne.--1702 to 1714.$ Increasing Dutch influences. Jacobean      influence finally discarded. Chinese influence largely present.       $Louis XIV.--1643 to 1715.$ The greatest French style. An entirely      French creation, marked by elegance and dignity. Toward the end of      the period it softened into the early Rococo.       $Georgian.--1714 to 1820.$ A direct outgrowth of the Queen Anne,      tempered by the prevailing French styles. It includes Chippendale,      Hepplewhite and Sheraton, but these three great cabinetmakers were      sufficiently distinct from the average Georgian to be worthy      separate classification.       $Chippendale.--1754 to 1800.$ The greatest English cabinet style.      Based on the Queen Anne, but drawing largely from the Rococo,      Chinese and Gothic, he produced three distinct types, viz.: French      Chippendale, Chinese Chippendale and Gothic Chippendale. The last      is a negligible quantity.       $Louis XV.--1715 to 1774.$ The Rococo period. The result of the      efforts of French designers to enliven the Louis XIV, and to evolve      a new style out of one that had reached its logical climax.       $Hepplewhite.--1775 to 1800.$ Succeeded Chippendale as the popular      English cabinetmaker. By many he is considered his superior. His      work is notable for a charming delicacy of line and design.       $Louis XVI.--1774 to 1793.$ The French style based on a revival of      Greek forms, and influenced by the discovery of the ruins of      Pompeii.       $Sheraton.--1775 to 1800.$ A fellow cabinetmaker, working at same      time as Hepplewhite. One of the Colonial styles (Georgian).       $R. & J. Adam.--1762 to 1800.$ Fathers of an English classic      revival. Much like the French Louis XVI and Empire styles in many      respects.       $Empire.--1804 to 1814.$ The style created during the Empire of      Napoleon I. Derived from classic Roman suggestions, with some Greek      and Egyptian influences.       $New Arts.--1900 to date.$ These are various worthy attempts by the      designers of various nations to create a new style. Some of the      results are good, and they are apt to be like the \"little girl who      had a little curl that hung in the middle of her forehead,\" in that      \"when they are good they are very, very good, but when they are bad      they are horrid.\"  [Illustration]   [Illustration]     HOW TO MAKE A PIANO BENCH   [Illustration]  All the material used in the making of this piano bench is 1 in. thick, excepting the two rails, which are 7/8 in. thick. The bench can be made from any of the furniture woods, but the case may demand one made from mahogany. If so, this wood can be purchased from a piano factory. The following stock list of materials may be ordered from a mill, planed and sandpapered:    1 top, 1 by 16 by 36-1/2 in.   2 ends, 1 by 14 by 18 in.   1 stretcher, 1 by 4 by 31-1/2 in.   2 side rails, 7/8 by 4 by 29-1/2 in.   2 keys, 1 by 1 by 3-1/2 in.   6 cleats, 1 by 1 by 4 in.  The dimensions given,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23770"],["title","Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 1 (#8)"],["body"," the exception of the keys and cleats, are 1/2 in. longer than necessary for squaring up the ends.  The two rails are cut slanting from a point 1-1/2 in. from each end to the center, making them only 3 in. wide in the middle. The rails are \"let into\" the edges of the ends so the outside of the rails and end boards will be flush. The joints are put together with glue and screws. The cleats are fastened with screws to the inside of the rails and to the top. The stretcher has a tenon cut on each end which fits into a mortise cut in each end. The tenons will have sufficient length to cut the small mortise for the key.  [Illustration]  The kind of wood used will determine the color of the stain for the finish. This also depends on matching other pieces of furniture.     HOW TO MAKE A MISSION SHAVING STAND   This attractive and useful piece of mission furniture will be appreciated by the person that does his own shaving. The shaving stand can be made at home by a handy man in his spare time as the stock can be ordered from a mill ready for making the joints and attaching the few pieces of hardware. The following is a stock list of materials:    4 posts 1-1/2 in. square by 50-1/2 in.   4 slats 7/8 by 1 by 32-1/2 in.   2 cross rails 1 by 1-1/2 by 15 in.   2 end rails 1 by 1-1/2 by 13 in.   1 top 7/8 by 16-1/2 by 19-1/2 in.   1 bottom 7/8 by 15 by 17 in.   2 ends 7/8 by 12-1/2 in. square.   1 back 7/8 by 12-1/2 by 14-1/2 in.   1 door 7/8 by 6-1/2 by 12-1/2 in.   2 drawer ends 7/8 by 5-1/2 by 7-1/2 in.   1 partition 7/8 by 12 by 14 in.   1 partition 7/8 by 7 by 14 in.   7 pieces of soft wood 1/2 by 7-1/2 by 12 in.   2 posts 1 in. square by 10-1/2 in.   1 bottom piece 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 18-1/2 in.   4 mirror frame pieces 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 14-1/2 in.   2 sticks for pins.   2 hinges   1 lock   2 drawer pulls   1 beveled glass mirror 11-1/2 by 11-1/2 in.  While this piece of furniture can be made in any kind of wood, the novice will find that quarter-sawed oak will work up and finish better than the other woods. The stock list given has dimensions 1/2 in. larger in some instances for dressing and squaring where necessary.  [Illustration]  The tenons and mortises are first cut for the crosspieces at the bottom of the posts, and, as it is best to use dowels at the top, holes are bored in the bottom piece and also the ends of the slats for pins. The bottom piece is also fastened to the posts with dowels. The bottom must have a square piece cut out from each corner almost the same size as the posts. When setting the sides together the end board and posts can be doweled and glued together and after drying well the posts can be spread apart far enough to insert the bottom rail and two slats. The rail and slats should be tried for a bit before putting on any glue, which may save some trouble.  [Illustration: Shaving Stand Complete]  After the sides are put together, the back is put in and glued. The top is then put on and fastened with cleats from the inside. The partitions are put in as shown and the door fitted. Two drawers are made from the ends and the soft wood material. The drawer ends may be supplied with wood pulls of the same material or matched with metal the same as used for the hinges.  [Illustration: Mirror Frame and Standards Details]  The pieces for the mirror frame must be rabbeted 1/2 in. deep to take the glass, and the ends joined together with a miter at each corner. The two short posts are tenoned and mortises cut in the bottom piece for joints and these joints well glued together. The bottom piece is then fastened to the top board of the stand. This will form the standards in which to swing the mirror and its frame. This is done with two pins inserted in holes bored through the standards and into the mirror frame.  After the parts are all put together, cleaned and sandpapered, the stand is ready for the finish.     A MISSION WASTE-PAPER BASKET   [Illustration: Waste-Paper Basket to Match Library Table]  The basket shown in the accompanying sketch is designed to be used with a library table having slats in the ends and wooden handles on the drawers. The finish is made to match that of the table by fuming, when completely assembled, in a large-size size, clean garbage can, with fumes of concentrated ammonia.  [Illustration: Detail of Waste-Paper Basket]  The following quarter-sawed white-oak stock should be procured in the exact dimensions given. This may be had, planed and cut to lengths, from a mill for a slight extra charge. It is advisable not to have them sandpapered, as the very coarse sandpaper generally used, gives a bad surface for finishing.     4 posts, 1-1/4 by 1-1/4 by 16-1/2 in., S-4-S.    4 rails, 3/4 by 3 by 10-1/4 in., S-2-S.    4 rails, 3/4 by 2 by 10-1/4 in., S-2-S.   12 slats, 3/8 by 2-1/4 by 9-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 handle pieces, 1 by 1 by 2-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 handle pieces, 1/2 by 1/2 by 6 in., S-4-S.    1 bottom, 3/8 by 9-1/2 by 9-1/2 in., S-2-S.  See that the posts are absolutely square cross section. Mark with a pencil--not gauge--the chamfers on the ends of the posts and plane them off.  Carefully mark the tenons on the ends of all the rails with a knife and gauge lines. Be sure that the distance from the tenon shoulder at one end of rail to the shoulder at the other end is exactly the same on each rail. Cut the tenons, using a backsaw and chisel.  Arrange the pieces as they are to stand in the finished basket, and number each tenon and mortise. Mark all the mortises on the posts, being sure to keep the distances between the top and lower rail the same on each post. Cut each mortise to fit the correspondingly numbered tenon. Next, mark the mortises for the slats in the rails, allowing the whole slat to go in 1/4 in.  The handles are next in order. The pieces going into the rail should be fastened with a round 1/2-in. tenon cut on one end and glued in place. The crosspiece should be mortised all the way through these pieces and held in place by a brad from the under side.  Now put the whole basket together without gluing, in order that errors, if any, may be detected.  If everything fits perfectly, the basket is ready to be glued. For best results hot glue should be used. First glue up two opposite sides with the slats in place. Clamps must be used. When these have set for at least 24 hours, the other rails and slats may be glued in place and clamped. It is a good idea to pin the tenons in place with two 1-in. brads driven from the inside.  The handles are then glued in place, using hand screws to hold them until the glue sets. The bottom should rest on thin cleats, without being nailed to them, so that it may be removed when the basket is to be emptied of small papers, etc.  Before applying the stain, see that all glue spots are removed and all surfaces sanded to perfect smoothness. If a fumed finish is not desired, any good stain may be used, after which a thin coat of shellac and two coats of wax should be applied. Allow plenty of time for drying between the coats.     A CELLARETTE PEDESTAL   [Illustration: Plain-Oak Cellarette Pedestal]  The illustration shows a unique article for the den. It serves as a pedestal and has one side which opens on hinges allowing the inside to be used as a smoker's cabinet or cellarette. All the lines are straight and the corners square, making it easy to construct. White oak will make up best, although ash, birch or southern pine may be used with good effect.  Stock of the following sizes should be bought, surfaced and cut to width and length:    2 top pieces, 7/8 by 12 by 12 in., S-2-S.   2 base pieces, 7/8 by 14 by 14 in., S-2-S.   2 sides, 7/8 by 8 by 35-5/8 in., S-2-S.   1 back, 7/8 by 6-1/4 by 35-5/8 in., S-2-S.   1 door, 7/8 by 6-1/4 by 34-3/4 in., S-2-S.   4 blocks, 7/8 by 4 by 4 in., S-2-S.   4 shelves, 7/8 by 6-1/4 by 6-1/4 in., S-2-S.   4 pieces, 7/8 by 1 by 10 in., S-4-S.  Make the top and base of two pieces, glued and screwed together with the grain crossed. This method prevents warping. To keep the end grain from showing, a strip of 3/8-in. lumber may be put on all around as shown in the drawing.  Have the sides, front and back squared up perfectly. The sides are to overlap the back and to be fastened to it with round-head brass or blue screws. To the center of the top and base attach one of the 6-1/4-in. square pieces. Over these, fit the sides and back and fasten them with screws or nails. The four corner blocks are now put under the base.  Two or more shelves may be set in as shown. Brass or copper hinges will look well if a dark stain is to be used.  Around the sides and back a 1-in. strip should be fastened to the base to give added strength.  If a dull finish is desired, apply two coats of stain and two of prepared wax. If a polished surface is wanted, first fill the pores of the wood with any standard filler, which can be purchased at a paint store. After this has dried partly, rub off any surplus filler, rubbing across the grain of the wood. When perfectly dry apply one coat of shellac and as many coats of varnish as desired, rubbing down each coat, except the last, with No. 00 sandpaper and pumice stone.  [Illustration: Detail of Cellarette Pedestal]     A DRESSER   The dresser shown in the illustration was made of quarter-sawed white oak and finished golden and waxed. The mirror is of beveled glass and the following is the stock bill:    1 top, 3/4 by 19-1/2 by 33 in., S-2-S.   4 posts, 1-3/4 by 1-3/4 by 28 in., S-4-S.   4 end rails, 3/4 by 2-1/4 by 17 in., S-2-S.   4 stiles, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 20 in., S-2-S.   2 panels, 3/16 by 12 by 18 in., S-2-S.   3 facings, 3/4 by 2-1/4 by 29 in., S-2-S.   2 top frame pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 32 in., S-2-S.   2 top frame pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 19 in., S-2-S.   2 mirror supports, 1 by 2 by 33 in., S-2-S.   1 mirror support, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 33 in., S-2-S.   1 drawer front, 3/4 by 7-1/4 by 28 in., S-2-S.   1 drawer front, 3/4 by 6-1/4 by 28 in., S-2-S.   2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 5-1/4 by 14 in., S-2-S.   1"]]]
