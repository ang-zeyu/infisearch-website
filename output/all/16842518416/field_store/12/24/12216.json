At Surfside workmen bustled about, hurrying across the lawn with boards, paint pots, and hammers. Tim Cavenough and his little host of helpers scurried to uncover the flower beds, and from morning to night trudged back and forth from the greenhouses bearing shallow boxes of seedlings which they transplanted to the gardens. Shutters were removed and stored away, piazza chairs brought out, awnings put up, and lawns and tennis courts rolled and cut.  As far as one could see a spangled expanse of ocean dazzled the eye and the tiny salt creeks that meandered across the meadows were like winding ribbons of blue. Certainly it was no weather to be shut up in school and boys and girls went hither with reluctant feet, checking off the days on their fingers and even counting the hours that must drag by before they would be free to roam at will amid this panorama of beauty.  To Walter King it seemed as if the closing period of his captivity would never be at an end. He studied rebelliously, and with only a half--nay, rather a quarter--of his mind on his lessons. All his thought was centered around Surfside and the novel experiences that beckoned him there. So impatient was he to begin his new duties that he found it impossible to settle down to anything.  \"You'll be failing in your last examinations, Walter, if you don't watch what you're doing,\" cautioned his mother. \"And should you do that, little profit would it be that you are hired out to Mr. Crowninshield for the summer. In the fall you'd have to stay behind your class, and think of the disgrace of that! Why, I'd be ready to hide my head with shame! Money or no money, you must buck up and put the Crowninshields and their doings out of your head. To lose a year now would mean just that much longer before you could graduate and take a regular job. I almost wish Jerry Thomas had never asked you to come up there, I do indeed.\"  \"Oh, don't go getting all fussed up, Ma,\" returned His Highness, irritated because he recognized the truth of his mother's words. \"I'm going to buckle down until the term is over, honest I am. It is hard, though, with the weather so fine. It seems as if I must be out. It's like being on a leash.\"  \"You're thinking of those dogs again!\"  The lad flushed sheepishly.  \"No, I wasn't.\"  \"But you were--whether you realized it or not. It is all you talk of nowadays--_dogs_! What it will be after they get here and you're up at Surfside living with them I don't know. Whatever else you do, though, you must not fail in your lessons and at the last moment spoil your whole year's record. School is your first duty now and you have no moral right to put anything else in its place.\"  \"I know it, Ma,\" Walter agreed.  \"Of course you know it,\" was the tart response. \"Just see that you do not forget it, that's all.\"  With this final admonition Mrs. King whisked about and taking up her cake of Sapolio and pail of steaming water ascended the stairs. Like the rest of Lovell's Harbor she was busy as a bee in clovertime. She had rented all her rooms and had so many things to do in preparation for her expected guests that she had not a second to waste.  After she had gone Walter loitered in the kitchen, whistling absently and at the same time winding a piece of string aimlessly over his fingers. His mother's words had stirred a vague, uncomfortable possibility in his mind. What if he were to fail in those final exams? It would be terrible. Such a disaster did not seem real. It couldn't happen--actually happen--to him. It would be too awful. Nevertheless, try as he would to banish them, visions of Surfside with its myriad fascinations would dance in his head.  He had never been away from home for more than a night before and to take up residence elsewhere for an entire season was in itself a novelty. Then there were the tennis courts, the golf links, the automobiles, motor boats, and the yacht! Why, it would be like fairyland! The next instant, however, his spirits drooped. It was absurd to imagine for a moment that he was to have any part in those magic amusements. He was not going to Surfside for recreation but for work. Notwithstanding that fact, though, it was beyond his power to forget that all these many activities would be going on about him and there was the chance, the bare chance, that an occasion might arise when he would be invited to participate in some of them.  Fancy spinning over the sandy roads of the Cape in that wonderful racing car! Or sailing the blue waters of the harbor in one of those snowy motor boats! As for the yacht, with its trimmings of glistening brass and spotless decks, had he not dreamed of going aboard it ever since the day it had first steamed into the bay two summers ago? People said there was every imaginable contrivance aboard: ice-making machines, electric lights, and electric piano, goodness only knew what! Simply to see such things would be wonderful. And if it ever should come about (of course it never would and it was absurd to picture it--ridiculous) but if it ever _did_ that he should go sailing out of the bay on that mystic craft what a miracle that would be!  With such visions floating through his mind what marvel that it was well-nigh out of the question for Walter King to focus his attention on algebra, Latin, history, and physics. X + Y seemed of very little consequence, and as for the Punic Wars they were so far away as to be hazy beyond any reality at all.  Possibly, although she was quite unconscious of it, some of the fault was his mother's for she kept the topic of his departure to the Crowninshields' ever before him.  \"I have your new shirts almost finished, son,\" she would assert with satisfaction, \"and they're as neat and well made as any New York tailor could make them, if I do say it; and you've three pairs of khaki trousers besides your old woolen ones and corduroys. With your Sunday suit of blue serge and those fresh ties and cap you'll have nothing to be ashamed of. Then you've those denim overalls, and your slicker, and Bob's outgrown pea-coat. I can't see but what you have everything you can possibly need. Do be watchful of your shoes and use them carefully, won't you, for they cost a mint of money? And remember whenever you can to work in your old duds and save your others. You can just as well as not if you only think of it. Your washing you'll bring home and don't forget that I want you to keep neat and clean. Rich folks notice those things a lot. So scrub your hands and neck and clean your nails, even if I'm not there to tell you to. Just because you are going to traipse round with the dogs is no excuse for looking like 'em,\" concluded she.  \"I'll remember, Ma,\" returned His Highness patiently.  \"And if you eat with the chauffeurs and a pack of men, don't go stuffing yourself with food until you're sick. There's a time to stop, you know. Don't wait until you've got past it and are so crammed that you can't swallow another mouthful.\"  \"I won't, Ma,\" was the meek response.  \"Brush your teeth faithfully, too. I've spent too much money on them to have them go to waste now.\"  \"Yes,\" came wearily from Walter.  \"Of course there's no call for me to talk to a person your age about smoking,\" continued his mother. \"When you've got your full growth and can earn money enough to pay for such foolishness you've a right to indulge in it if you see fit; but until then don't start a habit that will do you no good and may make a pigmy of you for life.\"  \"I promise you right now, Ma, that I----\"  \"No, don't promise. A promise is a sacred thing and one that it is a sacrilege to break. Never make a promise lightly. But just remember, laddie, that I'd far rather you didn't smoke for a few years yet. But should you feel you must why come and tell me, that's all.\"  \"I will, Ma,\" answered the boy soberly. Somehow going away from home suddenly seemed a very solemn business.  \"I guess that's the end of my cautions,\" smiled Mrs. King, \"the end, except to say that I hope you won't like Surfside so well that you'll forget to come home now and then and tell me how you are making out. Of course I'll have my boarders and work same's you; still, there'll be times when we won't be busy and can see each other,\" her voice trembled a little. \"Nobody will be more anxious to hear of your doings than I--remember that. I shall miss you, sonny. It's the first time you've been away from me and I can't but feel it's a sort of milestone. You'll be getting grown up and leaving home for good now before I know it, same as Bob has.\"  Her eyes glistened and for an instant she turned her head aside.  \"Oh, I shan't be branching out to make my fortune yet, Mother,\" protested Walter gayly. \"I don't know enough. I'm not clever like Bob--you said so yourself only the other day.\"  \"You're clever as is good for you,\" was the ambiguous retort. \"I'm glad you're no different.\"  \"Think of the money I'd be handing in if I could only earn as much as Bob.\"  \"The money? Aye, there's no denying it would be a help. However, with what you and Bob and I are going to earn this summer we should make out very well, even if your Uncle Mark Miller has left us in the lurch and your Uncle Henry King's investments have gone bad on us. I'll be turning a tidy penny with my boarders, thanks to you. And for a lad your age ten dollars a week is not to be sneezed at. Why, we'll have quite a little fortune between us!\"  He saw her face brighten.  \"Now if Bob could only be near at hand like you I believe I should be entirely happy,\" she sighed. \"I hate to think of him way out there on that spit of sand with the sea booming all around him and nothing for company but the other fellow, who's asleep whenever he's awake, and that clicking wireless instrument. Imagine the loneliness of it! The solitude would drive me crazy inside a week--I know it would.\"  \"Bob doesn't mind.\"  \"He's not the lad to say so if he did,\" replied the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23728"],["title","Walter and the Wireless (#6)"],["body","grimly. \"Nobody'd be any the wiser for what Bob thinks. Often at night I fall to wondering what he'd do was he to be taken sick.\"  \"Oh, he'd be all right, Mother,\" answered His Highness cheerfully. \"O'Connel is there, you know.\"  \"And what kind of a nurse would he be, do you think, with his ear to that switchboard from daylight until dark?\"  \"Not quite that. Mother.\"  \"Well, almost that, anyhow. It is all well enough for you to say so jauntily that Bob doesn't mind being off there with the wind howling round him and nothing to do but listen to it.\"  \"Nothing to do!\" repeated Walter. \"Why, Ma, he's busy all the time.\"  \"Tinkering with those wires, you mean?\" was the indignant question. \"Yes, I grant he has plenty of that, especially in bad weather. But I mean pleasures----\"  \"Moving pictures, church sociables, strawberry festivals,\" interrupted the lad mischievously.  \"Yes, I do,\" maintained Mrs. King stoutly. \"Folks must have something to brighten up their lives. Bob doesn't have a thing.\"  \"He often has days that are lively enough, according to his stories.\"  \"When there's wrecks, you mean?\" She shook her head gravely. \"It isn't those that I'm talking about. It's sitting day after day and listening to the meaningless taps and buzzings that come whining through that instrument.\"  \"They're not meaningless to him.\"  \"No-o, I suppose not,\" sighed the woman. For a moment she paused only to resume her complaints. \"Then there's the responsibility of it. I never did like to think of that. Should he tap once too much or too little when sending one of those dot and dash messages, think what it might mean! And suppose he heard a dot too much and didn't get the thing the other fellow was trying to tell him straight?\"  \"But he has been trained so he does not make mistakes.\"  \"All human clay makes mistakes,\" was the tragic answer, \"although I will say Bob makes fewer than most. And then the thunder storms--I'm always worried about those.\"  \"Yes, I'll confess there is some danger from lightning,\" owned Walter unwillingly. \"And of course there is danger from the current at all times if one is not careful. Even then accidents sometimes happen. However, Bob explained once that accidental shocks seldom result fatally unless the person is left too long without help. The man in charge of the radio outfit would almost never get the full force of the current, because part of it would be carried off through the wires and ground. Such accidents are mainly due to the temporary and faulty contact of the conductors.\"  \"I can't help what they're due to,\" sniffed Mrs. King. \"The point is that Bob might get knocked out and die.\"  \"Nonsense, Mother. You would not worry if you understood more about it. Besides, should a man get a shock, if you go promptly to work over him and keep at it long enough, you can almost always bring him back to consciousness. They do just about the same things to restore him that they do for a person that's been drowned. The aim is to make him breathe. If you can get him to, he will probably live. Of course, though, you have to break the circuit first.\"  \"The circuit?\"  \"Stop the current that is going through his body,\" explained Walter.  \"But how can you?\"  \"Bob told me how. He saw a chap knocked out once and helped fix him up. You had to be awfully careful about moving him away from the apparatus, Bob said, or you might get a shock yourself. They took a dry stick because it was a nonconductor of electricity, you know, and rolled the man over to one side, so he was out of reach of the wires. Had you covered your hands with dry cloth you could have moved him, too; rubber gloves are best but Bob did not happen to have any handy at the minute. So they poked the fellow out of the way with the stick, turned him over on his back, loosened his collar and clothing, and went to work on him. You know how they always roll up a coat or something and stuff it under drowned persons' shoulders to throw their head backward? Well, they did that; and afterward they began to move his arms up and down to make him breathe. The idea is to depress and expand the chest. We learned it in our 'first aid' class. Of course there are lots of things you have to do besides, and if you can get a doctor he will know of others that are better still. But Bob said the chief point was not to get discouraged and give up. Sometimes people die just because the folks fussing over them do not keep at it long enough. They get tired and when they see no results they decide it is no use and stop trying. You ought to work an hour anyhow, repeating the exercises at the rate of sixteen times a minute, Bob said. Then, if the poor chap does not come to, you can at least feel you have done all you can.\"  \"Ugh! It makes me shiver to think of it!\"  \"You didn't shiver when Minnie Carlton fell off the float and almost got drowned,\" remarked Walter significantly.  \"I had too much to think of,\" was Mrs. King's laconic reply.  \"It was the fussing you did over her that saved her life.\"  \"They said so.\"  \"You know it was.\"  \"Mebbe it was,\" admitted his mother modestly. \"But it wasn't any credit to me. I've always lived near the water and I feel at home with drowned people.\"  \"These electric accidents are much the same--easier, if anything, because the lungs are not filled with water.\"  \"I hadn't thought of that.\"  \"This is just a straight case of making a man breathe. You did that for Minnie.\"  \"I contrived to, yes.\"  \"Well, this stunt is the same. Bob said if you once got that through your head and kept in mind what you were driving at instead of flying off the handle you would get on all right.\"  \"Perhaps he's right. He generally is,\" sighed Mrs. King. \"Still it is a worrisome business having him tinkering with those wires all the time. I am thankful you are not doing it. I'd rather you tended dogs.\"  \"But you've forgotten what they're worth,\" put in His Highness.  \"So I had. Oh, dear! I don't see but what I've got to worry about both of you.\"  \"Pooh, Ma! Don't be foolish. Think of the money we'll have by fall, the three of us. Why, we'll be rich!\"  \"Not rich, with that last payment on the mortgage looming ahead.\"  \"But it _is_ the last--think of that! We won't ever have another to make.\"  A radiant smile flitted over Mrs. King's face but a moment later it was eclipsed by a cloud.  \"There'll be other things to pay; there always are,\" fretted she.  \"Oh, shucks, Ma! Why borrow trouble? It's always hanging round wanting to be borrowed. Why gratify it?\"  \"I know. It is a foolish habit, isn't it? Still, it was always my way to be prepared for the worst. I've done it all my life.\"  \"Then why not whiffle round now and just for a change be prepared for the best?\"  In spite of herself his mother laughed.  \"I expect that if I was as young as you and as happy-go-lucky I'd never worry,\" she answered not unkindly. \"But since I'm made with a worrying disposition and bound to worry anyhow, at least I've got something perfectly legitimate to worry about this summer, and you can't deny it. With one son liable to be electrocuted by wireless and the other likely to be run into jail for losing a million-dollar dog I shall have plenty to occupy my mind, not to mention all those boarders that are coming.\"  \"Now, Ma, you know you are actually looking forward to the boarders,\" Walter declared. \"Already you are simply itching to see them and find out what they are like.\"  \"And if I am, what then?\" admitted his mother flushing that she should have been read so accurately. \"Seeing them isn't all there is to it by a good sight. There is feeding them, and to keep them filled up in this bracing climate is no small matter.\"  \"Did you ever know any one to go hungry in this house?\"  \"Well, no; I can't say I ever did.\"  \"Do you imagine boarders will eat more than Bob or I?\"  \"Mercy on us! I hope not.\"  \"Well, you always gave us enough to eat. I guess if you contrived to do that you needn't worry about your boarders,\" chuckled His Highness.     CHAPTER IV  WALTER MAKES HIS BOW TO HIS EMPLOYER   The last day of June dawned dismal and foggy. A grim gray veil enshrouded Lovell's Harbor, rendering it cold and dreary. Had one been visiting it for the first time he would probably have turned his back on its forlornity and never have come again. The sea was wrapped in a mist so dense that its vast reach of waves was as complete a secret as if they had been actually curtained off from the land. On every leaf trembled beads of moisture and from the eaves of the sodden houses the water dripped with a melancholy trickle.  It was wretched weather for the Crowninshields to be coming to Surfside and yet that they were already on the way the jangling telephone attested.  \"I wouldn't have had 'em put in an appearance a day like this for the world!\" fretted Jerry Taylor, who for some unaccountable reason seemed to hold himself responsible for the general dampness and discomfort. \"Fog ain't nothin' to us folks who are used to it. We've lived by the ocean long enough to love it no matter how it behaves. But for it to go actin' up this way for strangers is a pity. It gives 'em a bad impression same's a ill-behaved child does.\"  \"But you can't help it,\" ventured Walter, who had just come into sight.  \"N-o. Still, somehow, I'm always that anxious for the place to look it's prettiest that I feel to blame when it doesn't.\"  The boy nodded sympathetically. Deep down within him lay an inarticulate affection for the hamlet in which he had been born and the great throbbing sea that lapped its shores. He therefore understood Jerry's attitude and shared in it far more than he would, perhaps, have been willing to admit. Nevertheless he merely knocked the drops from his rubber hat, muttered that it was a rotten day, and loitered awkwardly about, wondering just what to do.  At last school was at an end. He had squeaked through the examinations with safety if not with glory, and having wheeled his small trunk up to Surfside on a "]]]
