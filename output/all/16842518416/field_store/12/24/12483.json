Having extracted about a pound of marrow, he put it into a gallon of water, and, mixing along with it a quantity of the buffalo's blood and a little salt, set it on the fire to boil.  In a short time this savoury soup was ready.  Turn not up your noses at it, \"ye gentlemen of England, who live at home at ease,\" (though, by the way, we doubt the reality of that \"ease,\" which causes so much dyspepsia amongst you that good food becomes unpalatable and strong food nauseous), but believe us when we tell you that the soup was super-excellent.  \"Musha!\" exclaimed Larry, when he tasted the first spoonful, \"I feel exactly as if I had ait nothin' at all yit--only goin' to begin!\"  And with that he and his comrades attacked and consumed the soup until their faces shone again with grease and gladness.  \"That'll do now,\" said Larry in a decided tone, as he rose and stretched himself, preparatory to filling his beloved pipe--\"not a dhrop nor a bite more on any account.\"  \"Is you stuffed full?\" asked Bunco.  \"Pretty nigh,\" replied Larry, glancing at his friend with an inquiring look; \"seems to me that _you_ have overdone it.\"  \"Me is pretty tight,\" said Bunco languidly.  \"Come, come,\" cried the trapper, \"don't shirk your victuals.  There's one more course, and then you can rest if you have a mind to.\"  So saying, the indefatigable man took up the intestines of the buffalo, which had been properly prepared for the purpose, turned them inside out, and proceeded to stuff them with strips of tender loin well salted and peppered.  The long sausage thus hastily made was hung in festoons before the fire, and roasted until it was thoroughly browned.  Portions were then cut off and set down before the company.  When each thought of beginning he felt as though the swallowing of a single bite were utterly impossible, but when each had actually begun he could not stop, but continued eating until all was finished, and then wished for more, while Benjamin Hicks chuckled heartily to witness the success of his cookery and the extent of his friends' powers.  Ah, it is all very well, reader, for you to say \"Humph! nonsense,\" but go you and wander for a year or two among the Rocky Mountains, acquire the muscles of a trapper and the digestion of an ostrich, then starve yourself for a few days, and get the chance of a \"feed\" such as we have feebly described, and see whether you won't come home (if you ever come home) saying, \"Well, after all, truth _is_ strange, stranger than fiction!\"  It need scarcely be said that the solace of the pipe was sought immediately after the meal was concluded by Will, Larry, and Bunco; but Big Ben did not join them.  He had starved longer than they, and intended, as he said, to eat all night!  \"Well,\" observed Larry, as he extended himself at full length before the blaze, and resting his right elbow on the ground and his head on his hand, smoked in calm felicity; \"I've often found that there's nothin' like tiredness to make a man enjoy rest, but, faix, it's this night I've larned, as I niver did before, that there's nothin' like starvation to mak wan enjoy his victuals.\"  \"Eight, Larry,\" said Will Osten with a laugh; \"upon my word I think it would be worth while to live always on the plan of missing our meals each alternate day, in order to enjoy them more thoroughly on the other days.\"  \"If city men would go on that plan,\" observed the trapper, gravely tearing the flesh from a rib with his teeth, and speaking at the same time, \"there would be no use for doctors.\"  \"Ah, then, think of that now; wouldn't it be a rail hard case for the poor doctors?\" said Larry, with a sly glance at Will.  Bunco grinned at this, and observed that it was \"time for hims be go sleep.\"  Whereupon he rolled his blanket about him and lay down with his feet to the fire.  Will Osten also lay down and fell asleep almost immediately.  Larry, too, stretched himself out in repose, leaving Big Ben still engaged with the buffalo beef.  The night was rather cold.  In course of time Will Osten awoke, and called to the trapper to mend the fire, which he did, and then resumed his former occupation.  Once or twice after that, one and another of the slumberers awoke, and, looking up sleepily for a few seconds, beheld the enduring man still hard at work.  The last to lift his head that night was Larry.  The puzzled Irishman gazed in mute amazement during the unusually long period of half a minute, for Benjamin Hicks still sat there, glittering in the light of the camp-fire, grave as a Redskin, and busy as ever with the bones!    CHAPTER THREE.  RELATES HOW BIG BEN BECAME A TRAVELLING COMPANION, AND HOW A BIG BEAR WAS CAPTURED--DISCUSSIONS AND MISFORTUNES.  To the great satisfaction of Will Osten and his friends, it was discovered that Benjamin Hicks was a wandering trapper, whose avocations led him to whatever part of the wilderness was most likely to produce furs, and who had no particular objection to take a trip across the mountains with our adventurers.  Indeed Big Ben thought no more of a ride of several hundreds of miles than most men do of an afternoon walk, and, if particular business did not prevent him, he was always ready to undertake a \"venture\" so long as it was, in his opinion, justifiable and likely to pay.  \"You see, sir,\" he said, as he and Will cantered together along the base of a low hill one evening, \"it's not that I'm of an unsettled natur', but I've bin born to this sort o' life, an' it would be no manner o' use in me tryin' to change it.  Once upon a time I used to think o' settlin' in one of the back settlements--that was when my poor old mother was alive.  I used to live with her and take care of her after my father's death.  Then I married and thought I was fairly fixed down for life, but one night when I chanced to be out looking after my traps, a war-party o' Injuns attacked the village and killed every soul in it.  At least so it was said at the time, but afterwards I met a lad who had escaped, an' he told me that he had seen my mother and wife killed, but that a few of the men escaped as well as him.\"  The trapper's voice deepened as he spoke, and he paused.  \"Was it long ago?\" asked Will, in a tone of sympathy.  \"Ten years now,\" answered Ben, sadly--\"though it seems to me but yesterday.  For many a day after that I tried to find the trail o' the Redskins that did it, but never succeeded, thank God.  If I had, it would only have ended in the spillin' of more blood, without any good comin' of it.  It is long now since I left off thirstin' for revenge, but I suppose I'll never cease wishin' that--that--well, well, God's will be done,\" he added, as if rousing himself out of a sad reverie, \"I'm not used to speak about this, but somehow whenever I meet with white men _o' the right sort_ in the plains or mountains, I always feel a kind o' longin' to let my tongue wag raither too free.  However, as I was goin' to say, I've been a wanderer since then, goin' where I think I can be o' use to myself or others; and so, as you don't appear to be overly knowin' about the trail across the mountains, I'll go with 'ee a bit o' the way an' pint it out, if you have no objections.\"  \"No objections!\" echoed Will; \"I'll be delighted to have your company, and would be only too glad if you could go all the way.\"  \"Who knows but I might be willin' to go if I was asked,\" said the trapper, with a slight approach to a smile.  \"Are you in earnest?\" asked Will Big Ben not only admitted that he was in earnest, but said that he was quite ready to start at once, if they would only consent to diverge from their route about thirty miles to a small outpost belonging to the fur-traders, where he had deposited a lot of peltries, which he wished to convert into supplies for the journey. This was readily agreed to, and, accordingly, next day about noon, they came in sight of Rocky Mountain Fort--so-called because of its being situated in a somewhat wild glen, near the verge of one of the eastern spurs of the Rocky Mountains.  While the fort was still far distant, though in sight, Larry O'Hale uttered a sudden exclamation, and pointed to a black spot lying on the side of one of the numerous mounds with which the country was diversified.  \"A black bear,\" said the trapper, quietly.  \"Have at ye then!\" shouted Larry, as he drove his heels against the ribs of his steed and went off at full gallop.  \"Stay, Bunco, let him have all the glory to himself,\" cried Will, laughing.  Bunco, who had started to follow, reined up, and all three cantered to the top of a neighbouring height, whence they could clearly see the country for many miles in all directions.  Meanwhile the enthusiastic Larry had descended into a hollow, to leeward of the bear.  Along this he trotted smartly, following its windings and keeping carefully out of sight, until he judged himself to be nearly opposite to the spot where the bear lay, then breaking into a gallop he turned at right angles to his former course, bounded over the ridge that had concealed him, and rushed furiously on his victim.  The bear was a young one, but nearly full grown.  On beholding the horseman it rose on its hind legs and showed all its formidable teeth.  \"Och! is it laughin' ye are?\" exclaimed Larry, bringing forward the muzzle of his gun, \"it's cryin' ye'll be before long.\"  As he spoke the piece exploded.  Whether it was that his finger had pressed the trigger too soon, or that the aim, owing to the pace, was unsteady, we know not, but Larry missed; the ball hit the ground just in front of the bear, and drove such a quantity of earth into his facs, eyes, and mouth, that he shook his head with a spluttering cough which ended in a savage growl, but, on beholding the wild Irishman charging down on him with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24086"],["title","Over the Rocky Mountains: Wandering Will in the Land of the Redskin (#5)"],["body","ferocity and thunder of a squadron of heavy dragoons, he dropt on his fore-legs, turned tail, and fled.  Larry tried to re-load while pursuing, but, owing to the uneven nature of the ground, which required him to devote earnest attention to the badger-holes, he could not manage this.  Without knowing very well what to do, he continued the chase, meditating as to whether it were better to try to ride over the bear, or to attempt the breaking of its skull with the butt end of his gun.  As, however, it was all he could do to keep pace with the brute, he found either alternative impossible.  \"Ochone! what'll I do wid ye?\" cried the perplexed man, in despair.  The bear, as if in reply, glanced aside at him and grinned horribly.  \"I do belaive it's laughin' again at me!  Git on, ye baist,\" (to his horse), \"sure ye're four times as big, an' ought to run faster.\"  Larry forgot to do his steed the justice to add that it carried fourteen stone weight on its back.  The poor man tried hard to overtake the bear, but failed to gain an inch on him.  To make matters worse, he observed that the brute was edging towards a wood which lay on his right.  Seeing this he diverged a little, and, by making a dive into a hollow, he managed to cut off its retreat in that direction.  Rocky Mountain Fort, which lay on his left, was now within half a mile of him, and he could see some of its inhabitants, who had observed the party coming from the plains, standing at the gate of the fort watching the chase with much interest.  A glance over his shoulder showed him that his travelling companions were in view behind.  Keenly alive to the fact that he should be overwhelmed with ridicule if he failed, the now desperate man conceived the bold idea of driving the bear into the fort!  He felt that this feat was not beyond the bounds of possibility, for the bear was beginning to flag a little, while his hardy steed was still in good wind.  He therefore applied the whip with greater energy, and soon came alongside of the bear, which attempted to turn to the right, but Paddy had become a good and alert horseman by that time, and was on his other side in an instant.  Again the bear tried to double, and again his enemy checked him and urged him on.  Thus they progressed until they drew near to the gate of the fort.  This was now deserted, for the fur-traders soon understood the game that the wild horseman was playing, and made way for the entrance of the stranger.  At last the bear came so close to the walls of the fort that it observed the open gateway.  A way of escape was here--it evidently imagined--so it went through at full gallop!  It was immediately met by a house.  Turning quickly round, it was met by another house.  Dashing aside, it was brought up by a wall. As a last resource it ran behind a pile of cut firewood and stuck its head into a hole, just as Larry O'Hale bounded through the gateway with a wild cheer of triumph.  Will Osten, Big Ben, and Bunco quickly followed, and the gates were shut by the men of the fort.  But the victory was by no means completed.  The question still remained, How was the enemy to be made prisoner?  One of the fur-traders seized it by the tail and tried to draw it out.  He failed to do more than draw forth a tremendous growl.  Another fur-trader, aided by Larry, came to the assistance of the first, and, by their united power, plucked Bruin out of the hole like a cork out of a bottle.  He turned with fury on his enemies, two of whom sprang back, overturning Larry in the act.  At that moment one of the fur-traders, a stalwart Canadian, leaped upon the bear, grasped him by the throat, and tried to strangle him.  One of the others, seeing this, caught at the brute's legs and tumbled him on his side, for which he was rewarded with a scratch which tore his right arm open from the elbow to the wrist.  The hands of the stout Canadian were at the same time severely lacerated by the brute's claws.  During the brief moments in which this struggle lasted, Big Ben had leaped from his steed; detached the stout line which always hung at his saddle-bow; made a noose as deftly as if he had been a British tar or a hangman, and passed it quickly over the bear's muzzle.  Drawing it tight he took a turn round its neck, another round its fore-legs, and a third round the body.  After this the work of subjugation was easy, and Bruin was finally reduced to slavery.  We know not, good reader, what you may think of this incident, but we beg to assure you that, in its essence, it is a fact, and that that bear was afterwards sent to England to suck its paws in a menagerie, and delight the eyes and imaginations of an admiring public.  Again we change the scene to the heart of the Rocky Mountains, in which, after many days of toil and trouble, heat and cold, hunger and thirst, difficulty and danger, our travellers found themselves at the close of a bright and beautiful day.  \"I think,\" said Will Osten, reining up by the side of a copse which crowned the brow of an eminence, \"that this seems a good camping place.\"  \"There is not a better within ten mile of us,\" said Big Ben, dismounting.  \"This is the spot I have been pushing on for all day, so let us to work without delay.  We have a hard day before us to-morrow, and that necessitates a hard feed an' a sound sleep to-night.  Them's the trapper's cure for all ills.\"  \"They cure many ills, doubtless,\" observed Will, as he removed the saddle from his jaded steed.  Larry, whose duty it was to cut firewood, remarked, as he administered his first powerful blow to a dead tree, that \"grub and slumber at night was the chief joys o' life, and the only thing that could be compared to 'em was, slumber and grub in the mornin'!\"  To which sentiment Bunco grinned hearty assent, as he unloaded and hobbled the pack-horses.  Soon the camp was made.  The fire roared grandly up among the branches of the trees.  The kettle sent forth savoury smells and clouds of steam. The tired steeds munched the surrounding herbage in quiet felicity, and the travellers lay stretched upon a soft pile of brushwood, loading their pipes and enjoying supper by anticipation.  The howling of a wolf, and the croaking of some bird of prey, formed an appropriate duet, to which the trickling of a clear rill of ice-cold water, near by, constituted a sweet accompaniment, while through the stems of the trees they could scan--as an eagle does from his eyrie high up on the cliffs-- one of the grandest mountain scenes in the world, bathed in the soft light of the moon in its first quarter.  \"'Tis a splendid view of God's handiwork,\" said the trapper, observing the gaze of rapt admiration with which Will Osten surveyed it.  \"It is indeed most glorious,\" responded Will, \"a scene that inclines one to ask the question, If earth be so fair, what must heaven be?\"  \"It aint easy to answer that,\" said the trapper gravely, and with a slight touch of perplexity in a countenance which usually wore that expression of calm self-reliance peculiar to men who have thorough confidence in themselves.  \"Seems to me that there's a screw loose in men's thoughts when they come to talk of heaven.  The Redskins, now, think it's a splendid country where the weather is always fine, the sun always shining, and the game plentiful.  Then the men of the settlement seem to have but a hazy notion about its bein' a place of happiness, but they can't tell why or wherefore in a very comprehensible sort o' way, and, as far as I can see, they're in no hurry to get there.  It seems in a muddle somehow, an' that's a thing that surprises me, for the works o' the Almighty--hereaway in the mountains--are plain and onderstandable, so as a child might read 'em; but man's brains don't seem to be such perfect work, for, when he comes to talk o' God and heaven, they appear to me to work as if they wor out o' jint.\"  The trapper was a naturally earnest, matter-of-fact man, but knew little or nothing of the Christian religion, except what he had heard of it from the lips of men who, having neither knowledge of it nor regard for it themselves, gave a false report both of its blessed truths and its workings.  He glanced inquiringly at our hero when he ceased to speak.  \"What is your own opinion about heaven?\" asked Will Big Ben looked earnestly at his companion for a few seconds and said--  \"Young man, I never was asked that question before, an' so, of course, never made a straightforward reply to it.  Nevertheless, I think I have a sort of notion on the pint, an' can state it, too, though I can't boast of havin' much larnin'.  Seems to me that the notion of the men of the settlements isn't worth much, for few o' them can tell ye what they think or why they think it, except in a ramblin' way, an' they don't agree among themselves.  Then, as for the Redskins, I can't believe that it's likely there will be such work as shootin' an' fishin' in heaven. So I'm inclined to think that we know nothin' about it at all, and that heaven will be nothin' more nor less than bein' with God, who, bein' the Maker of the soul an' body, knows what's best for both, and will show us that at the proper time.  But there _are_ mysteries about it that puzzle me.  I know that the Almighty _must_ be right in all He does, yet He permits men to murder each other, and do worse than that.\"  \"I agree with you, Ben,\" said Will Osten, after a moment's reflection. \"That everything in heaven will be perfect is certain.  That we don't at present see how this is to be is equally certain, and the most certain thing of all is, that the very essence of heaven will consist in being `for ever with the Lord.'  I don't wonder at your being puzzled by mysteries.  It would be strange indeed were it otherwise, but I have a book here which explains many of these mysteries, and shows us how we ought to regard those which it does _not_ explain.\"  Here Will Osten drew a small volume from the breast-pocket of his coat.  \"The Bible?\" said"]]]
