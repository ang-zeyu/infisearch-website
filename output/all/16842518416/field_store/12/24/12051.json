For several hours the unfortunate piscator flogged the water in vain.  He became very hot during this prolonged exertion, stumbled into several holes, and wetted both legs up to the knees, had his cap brushed off more than once by overhanging branches, and entangled his line grievously while in the act of picking it up, bruised his shins several times, and in short got so much knocked about, battered, and worried, that he began to feel in a state of mental and physical dishevelment.  Still his countenance did not betray much of his feelings.  He found fishing more difficult in all respects than he had expected; but what then?  Was he going to give way to disgust at the first disappointment? Certainly not.  Was he going to fail in perseverance now, after having established a reputation for that quality during a long commercial life in the capital of England?  Decidedly not.  Was that energy, that vigour, that fervour of character for which he was noted, to fail him here--here, in an uncivilised country, where it was so much required-- after having been the means of raising him from a humble station to one of affluence; after having enabled him to crush through all difficulties, small or great, as well as having caused him to sweep hecatombs of crockery to destruction with his coat tails?  Indubitably not!  Glowing with such thoughts, the dauntless man tightened his cap on his brow, pressed his lips together with a firm smile, frowned good-humouredly at fate and the water, and continued his unflagging, though not unflogging, way.  So, the hot sun beat down upon him until evening drew on apace, and then the midges came out.  The torments which Mr Sudberry endured after this were positively awful, and the struggles that he made, in the bravery of his cheerful heart, to bear up against them, were worthy of a hero of romance.  His sufferings were all the more terrible and exasperating, that at first they came in the shape of an effect without a cause.  The skin of his face and hands began to inflame and to itch beyond endurance--to his great surprise; for the midges were so exceedingly small and light, that, being deeply intent on his line, he did not observe them.  He had heard of midges, no doubt; but never having seen them, and being altogether engrossed in his occupation, he never thought of them for a moment.  He only became aware of ever-increasing uneasiness, and exhibited a tendency to rub the backs of his hands violently on his trousers, and to polish his countenance with his cuffs.  It must be the effect of exposure to the sun, he thought--yes, that was it; of course, that would go off soon, and he would become case-hardened, a regular mountaineer!  Ha! was that a trout?  Yes, that must have been one at last; to be sure, there were several stones and eddies near the spot where it rose, but he knew the difference between the curl of an eddy now and the splash of a trout; he would throw over the exact spot, which was just a foot or two above a moss-covered stone that peeped out of the water; he did so, and caught it--the stone, not the trout--and the hooks remained fixed in the slimy green moss.  Mr Sudberry scratched his head and felt inclined to stamp.  He even experienced a wild desire to cast his rod violently into the river, and walk home with his hands in his pockets; but he restrained himself. Pulling on the line somewhat recklessly, the hook came away, to his immense delight, trailing a long thread of the green moss along with it.  Mr Sudberry now took to holding a muttered conversation with himself--a practice which was by no means new to him, and in the course of which he was wont to address himself in curiously disrespectful terms.  \"Come, come, John, my boy, don't be cast down!  Never say die!  Hope, ay, hope told a flatter--Hallo! was that a rise?  No, it must have been another of these--what can be the matter with your skin to-day, John?  I don't believe it's the sun, after all.  The sun never drove anyone frantic. Never mind; cheer up, old cock!  That seems a very likely hole--a beautiful--beau-ti--steady!  That was a good cast--the best you've made to-day, my buck; try it again--ha! s-s-us! caught again, as I'm a Dutchman.  This is too bad.  Really, you know--well, you've come off easier than might have been expected.  Now then, softly.  What _can_ be the matter with your face?--surely--it cannot be,\" (Mr Sudberry's heart palpitated as he thought), \"the _measles_!  Oh! impossible, pooh! pooh! you had the measles when you were a baby, of course--d'ye know, John, you're not quite sure of that.  Fevers, too, occasionally come on with extreme--dear me, how hot it is, and what a time you have been fishing, you stupid fellow, without a rise!  It must be getting late.\"  Mr Sudberry stopped with a startled look as he said this.  He glanced at the sun, pulled out his watch, gazed at it with unutterable surprise, put it to his ear, and groaned.  \"Too late! half-past five; dinner at five--punctually!  Oh!  Mary, Mary, won't I catch it to-night!\"  A cloud passed over the sun as he spoke.  Being very susceptible to outward influences, the gloom of the shadow descended on his spirits as well as his person, and for the first time that day a look of deep dejection overspread his countenance.  Suddenly there was a violent twitch at the end of the rod, the reel spun round with a sharp whirr-r, and every nerve in Mr Sudberry's system received an electric shock as he bent forward, straddled his legs, and made a desperate effort to fling the trout over his head.  The slender rod would not, however, permit of such treatment.  It bent double, and the excited piscator was fain to wind up--an operation which he performed so hastily that the line became entangled with the winch of the reel, which brought it to a dead-lock.  With a gasp of anxiety he flung down the rod, and seizing the line with his hands, hauled out a beautiful yellow trout of about a quarter of a pound in weight, and five or six inches long.  To describe the joy of Mr Sudberry at this piece of good fortune were next to impossible.  Sitting down on his fishing-basket, with the trout full in view, he drew forth a small flask of sherry, a slice of bread, and a lump of cheese, and proceeded then and there to regale himself. He cared nothing now for the loss of his dinner; no thought gave he to the anticipated scold from neglected Mrs Sudberry.  He gave full scope to his joy at the catching of this, his first trout.  He looked up at the cloud that obscured the sun, and forgave it, little thinking, innocent man, that the said cloud had done him a good turn that day.  He smiled benignantly on water, earth, and sky.  He rubbed his face, and when he did so he thought of the measles and laughed--laughed heartily, for by that time he had discovered the true cause of his misery; and although we cannot venture to say that he forgave the midges, sure we are that he was greatly mollified towards them.  Does any ignorant or cynical reader deem such an extravagance of delight inconsistent with so trifling an occasion?  Let him ponder before he ventures to exclaim, \"Ridiculous!\"  Let him look round upon this busy, whirling, incomprehensible world, and note how its laughing and weeping multitudes are oft-times tickled to uproarious merriment, or whelmed in gloomy woe, by the veriest trifles, and then let him try to look with sympathy on Mr Sudberry and his first trout.  Having carefully deposited the fish in his basket, he once more resumed his rod and his expectations.  But if the petty annoyances that beset our friend in the fore part of that day may be styled harassing, those with which he was overwhelmed towards evening may be called exasperating.  First of all he broke the top of his rod, a misfortune which broke his heart entirely.  But recollecting suddenly that he had three spare top-pieces in the butt, his heart was cemented and bound up, so to speak, in a rough and ready manner.  Next, he stepped into a hole, which turned out to be three feet deep, so that he was instantly soaked up to the waist.  Being extremely hot, besides having grown quite reckless, Mr Sudberry did not mind this; it was pleasantly cooling.  He was cheered, too, at the moment, by the re-appearance of the sun, which shone out as bright as ever, warming his heart, (poor, ignorant man!) and, all unknown to him, damaging his chance of catching any more fish at that time.  Soon after this he came to a part of the river where it flowed through extremely rugged rocks, and plunged over one or two precipices, sending up clouds of grey mist and a dull roar which overawed him, and depressed his spirits.  This latter effect was still further increased by the bruising of his shins and elbows, which resulted from the rough nature of the ground.  He became quite expert now in hanking on bushes and disentangling the line, and experienced a growing belief in the truth of the old saying that \"practice makes perfect.\"  He cast better, he hanked oftener, and he disentangled more easily than he had done at an earlier period of the day.  The midges, too, increased as evening advanced.  Presently he came upon a picturesque portion of the stream where the waters warbled and curled in little easy-going rapids, miniature falls, and deep oily pools.  Being an angler by nature, though not by practice, (as yet), he felt that there must be _something_ there.  A row of natural stepping-stones ran out towards a splendid pool, in which he felt assured there must be a large trout--perhaps a grilse.  His modesty forbade him to hint \"a salmon,\" even to himself.  It is a very difficult thing, as everyone knows, to step from one stone to another in a river, especially when the water flowing between runs swift and deep.  Mr Sudberry found it so.  In his effort to approach the pool in question, which lay under the opposite bank, he exhibited"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23505"],["title","Freaks on the Fells: Three Months' Rustication (#7)"],["body","a few of the postures of the rope-dancer and the acrobat; but he succeeded, for Mr Sudberry was a man of indomitable pluck.  Standing on a small stone, carefully balanced, and with his feet close together, he made a beautiful cast.  It was gracefully done; it was vigorously, manfully done--considering the difficulty of the position, and the voracity of the midges--and would have been undoubtedly successful but for the branch of a tree which grew on the opposite bank and overhung the stream.  This branch Mr Sudberry, in his eagerness, did not observe.  In casting, he thrust the end of his rod violently into it; the line twirled in dire confusion round the leaves and small boughs, and the drag hook, as if to taunt him, hung down within a foot of his nose.  Mr Sudberry, in despair, made a desperate grasp at this and caught it. More than that--it caught him, and sunk into his forefinger over the barb, so that he could not get it out.  The rock on which he stood was too narrow to admit of much movement, much less to permit of his resting the butt of his rod on it, even if that had been practicable--which it was not, owing to the line being fast to the bough, and the reel in a state of dead-lock from some indescribable manoeuvre, to which it had previously been subjected.  There he stood, the very personification of despair; but while standing there he revolved in his mind the best method of releasing his line without breaking it or further damaging his rod.  Alas! fortune, in this instance, did not favour the brave.  While he was looking up in rueful contemplation of the havoc above, and then down at his pierced and captured finger, his foot slipped and he fell with a heavy plunge into deep water.  That settled the question.  The whole of his tackle remained attached to the fatal bough excepting the hook in his finger, with which, and the remains of his fishing-rod, he floundered to the shore.  Mr Sudberry's first act on gaining the land was to look into his basket, where, to his great relief, the trout was still reposing.  His next was to pick up his hat, which was sailing in an eddy fifty yards down the stream.  Then he squeezed the water out of his garments, took down his rod, with a heavy sigh strangely mingled with a triumphant smile, and turned his steps home just as the sun began to dip behind the peaks of the distant hills.  To his surprise and relief; Mrs Sudberry did _not_ scold when, about an hour later, he entered the hall or porch of the White House with the deprecatory air of a dog that knows he has been misbehaving, and with the general aspect of a drowned rat.  His wife had been terribly anxious about his non-arrival, and the joy she felt on seeing him safe and well, induced her to forget the scold.  \"Oh!  John dear, quick, get off your clothes,\" was her first exclamation.  As for Jacky, he uttered a cheer of delight and amazement at beholding his father in such a woeful plight; and he spent the remainder of the evening in a state of impish triumph; for, had not his own father come home in the same wet and draggled condition as that in which he himself had presented himself to Mrs Brown earlier in the day, and for which he had received a sound whipping?  \"Hooray!\" and with that the amiable child went off to inform his worthy nurse that \"papa was as bad a boy as himself--badder, in fact; for he, (Jacky), had only been in the water up to the waist, while papa had gone into it head and heels!\"    STORY ONE, CHAPTER 6.  THE PICNIC.  A Vision of beauty now breaks upon the scene!  This vision is tall, graceful, and commanding in figure.  It has long black ringlets, piercing black eyes, a fair delicate skin, and a bewitching smile that displays a row of--of \"pearls!\"  The vision is about sixteen years of age, and answers to the romantic name of Flora Macdonald.  It is sister to that stalwart Hector who first showed Mr Sudberry how to fish; and stately, sedate, and beautiful does it appear, as, leaning on its brother's arm, it ascends the hill towards the White House, where extensive preparations are being made for a picnic.  \"Good-morning, Mr Sudberry,\" cries Hector, doffing his bonnet and bowing low to Lucy.  \"Allow me to introduce my sister, Flora; but,\" (glancing at the preparations), \"I fear that my visit is inopportune.\"  Mr Sudberry rushes forward and shakes Hector and sister heartily by the hand.  \"My dear sir, my dear madam, inopportune! impossible!  I am charmed.  We are just going on a picnic, that is all, and you will go with us.  Lucy, my dear, allow me to introduce you to Miss Macdonald--\"  \"_Flora_, my good sir; pray do not let us stand upon ceremony,\" interposes Hector.  Lucy bows with a slight air of bashful reserve; Flora advances and boldly offers her hand.  The blue eyes and the black meet; the former twinkle, the latter beam, and the knot is tied; they are fast friends for life!  \"Glorious day,\" cries Mr Sudberry, rubbing his hands.  \"Magnificent,\" assents Hector.  \"You are fortunate in the weather, for, to say truth, we have little enough of sunshine here.  Sometimes it rains for three or four weeks, almost without cessation.\"  \"Does it indeed?\"  Mr Sudberry's visage elongates a little for one moment.  Just then George and Fred come out of the White House laden with hampers and fishing-baskets full of provisions.  They start, gaze in surprise at the vision, and drop the provisions.  \"These are my boys, Miss Macdonald--Hector's sister, lads,\" cries Mr Sudberry.  \"You'll join us I trust?\"  (to Hector.)  Hector assents \"with pleasure.\"  He is a most amiable and accommodating man.  Meanwhile George and Fred shake hands with Flora, and express their \"delight, their pleasure, etcetera, at this unexpected meeting which, etcetera, etcetera.\"  Their eyes meet, too, as Lucy's and Flora's had met a minute before.  Whether the concussion of that meeting is too severe, we cannot say, but the result is, that the three pair of eyes drop to the ground, and their owners blush.  George even goes the length of stammering something incoherent about \"Highland scenery,\" when a diversion is created in his favour by Jacky, who comes suddenly round the corner of the house with a North-American-Indian howl, and with the nine dogs tearing after him clamorously.  Jacky tumbles over a basket, of course, (a state of disaster is his normal condition), bruises his shins, and yells fearfully, to the dismay of his mother, who runs shrieking to the window in her dressing-gown, meets the gaze of Hector and Flora Macdonald, and retires precipitately in discomfiture.  No such sensibility affects the stern bosom of Mrs Brown, who darts out at the front door, catches the unhappy boy by one arm, and drags him into the house by it as if _it_ were a rope, the child a homeward-bound vessel, and _she_ a tug-steamer of nine hundred horse-power.  The sounds that proceed from the nursery thereafter are strikingly suggestive: they might be taken for loud clapping of hands, but the shrieks which follow forbid the idea of plaudits.  Poor Tilly, who is confused by the uproar, follows the nurse timidly, bent upon intercession, for she loves Jacky dearly.  The nine dogs--easy-going, jovial creatures--at once jump to the conclusion that the ham and cold chicken have been prepared and laid out there on the green hill-side for their special entertainment.  They make a prompt dash at the hampers.  Gentlemen and ladies alike rush to the rescue, and the dogs are obliged to retire.  They do so with a surprised and injured look in their innocent eyes.  \"Have you one or two raw onions and a few cold boiled potatoes?\" inquires Hector.  \"I'll run and see,\" cries George, who soon returns with the desired edibles in a tin can.  \"That will do.  Now I shall let you taste a potato salad; meanwhile I will assist in carrying the baskets down to the boat.\"  Hector's and Lucy's eyes meet as this is said.  There must be some unaccountable influence in the atmosphere this morning, for the meeting of eyes, all round, seems to produce unusual results!  \"Will Mr McAllister accompany us?\" says Mr Sudberry.  Mr McAllister permits a quiet smile to disturb the gravity of his countenance, and agrees to do so, at the same time making vague reference to the groves of Arcadia, and the delight of dining _alfresco_, specially in wet weather,--observations which surprise Mr Sudberry, and cause Hector and the two brothers to laugh.  Mrs Sudberry is ready at last!  The gentlemen and Hobbs load themselves, and, followed by Jacky and the ladies, proceed to the margin of the loch, which sheet of water Mr Sudberry styles a \"lock,\" while his better half deliberately and obstinately calls it a \"lake.\"  The party is a large one for so small a boat, but it holds them all easily. Besides, the day is calm and the water lies like a sheet of pure glass; it seems almost a pity to break such a faithful mirror with the plashing oars as they row away.  Thus, pleasantly, the picnic began!  George and Fred rowed, Hector steered, and the ladies sang,--Mr Sudberry assisting with a bass.  His voice, being a strong baritone, was overwhelmingly loud in the middle notes, and sank into a muffled ineffective rumble in the deep tones.  Having a bad ear for tune, he disconcerted the ladies--also the rowers.  But what did that matter?  He was overflowing with delight, and apologised for his awkwardness by laughing loudly and begging the ladies to begin again.  This they always did, with immense good humour.  Mrs Sudberry had two engrossing subjects of contemplation.  The one was the boat, which, she was firmly persuaded, was on the point of upsetting when any one moved ever so little; the other was Jacky, who, owing to some strange impulse natural to his impish character, strove to stretch as much of his person beyond the side of the boat as was possible without absolutely throwing himself overboard.  The loch was upwards of three miles in length; before the party had gone half the distance Mr"]]]
