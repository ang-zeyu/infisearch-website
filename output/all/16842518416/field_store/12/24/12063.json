But it's too far to walk.\"  \"Of course it is, Mopsy. We'll have a big wagon that will hold us all. You may invite your friends, and I'll invite a comrade of my own. Will you go, Mrs. Maynard?\"  \"I will, with pleasure. I adore picnics, and this bids fair to be a delightful one. May I assist you in planning the feast?\"  \"Indeed you may,\" said Midget, smiling at her mother. \"But we can choose, can't we?\"  \"Of course, choose ahead.\"  \"Ice-cream,\" said Marjorie, promptly.  \"Little lemon tarts,\" said Kitty.  \"Candy,\" said Rosy Posy.  \"Cold chicken,\" said Kingdon.  \"That's a fine bill of fare,\" said Mr. Maynard, \"but I'll add sandwiches and lemonade as my suggestions, and anything we've omitted, I'm sure will get into the baskets somehow.\"  \"Oh, won't it be lovely!\" exclaimed Marjorie. \"I haven't been on a picnic with our own family for so long. We had picnics at Grandma's, but nothing is as much fun as an Ourday.\"  \"Let's take the camera,\" said Kingdon, \"and get some snapshots.\"  \"Yes, and let's take fishlines, and fish in the brook,\" said Kitty.  \"All right, chickabiddies; we'll have a roomy wagon to travel in, so take whatever you like. And now I must be off. Little Mother, you'll make a list to-day, won't you, of such things as I am to get for this frolic?\"  \"Candy,\" repeated Rosy Posy; \"don't fordet that.\"  As the baby was not allowed much candy, she always chose it for her Ourday treat.  Mr. Maynard went away to his business, and the others remained at the breakfast table, talking over the coming pleasure.  \"We'll have a great time!\" said Kingdon. \"We'll make father play Indians and shipwreck and everything.\"  \"Don't make me play Indians!\" exclaimed his mother, in mock dismay.  \"No, indeedy! You couldn't be an Indian. You're too white-folksy. But you can be a Captive Princess.\"  \"Yes!\" cried Marjorie; \"in chains and shut up in a dungeon.\"  \"No, no,\" screamed Rosy Posy; \"my muvver not be shutted up in dunjin!\"  \"No, she shan't, Baby,\" said her brother, comfortingly; \"and, anyway, Mops, Indians don't put people in dungeons, you're thinking of Mediævals.\"  \"Well, I don't care,\" said Midget, happily; \"we'll have a lovely time, whatever we play. I'm going over to ask Gladys now. May I, Mother?\"  \"Yes, Midget, run along. Tell Mrs. Fulton that Father and I are going, and that we'd be glad to take Gladys and Dick.\"  Away skipped Marjorie, hatless and coatless, for it was a warm day, and Gladys lived only across the street.  \"It's so nice to have you back again, Mopsy,\" said Gladys, after the invitation had been given and accepted. \"I was awful lonesome for you all summer.\"  \"I missed you, too; but I did have a lovely time. Oh, Gladys, I wish you could see my tree-house at Grandma's! Breezy Inn, its name is, and we had _such_ fun in it.\"  \"Why don't you have one here? Won't your father make one for you?\"  \"I don't know. Yes, I suppose he would. But it wouldn't seem the same. It just _belongs_ at Grandma's. And, anyway, I'm busy all the time here. There's so much to do. We play a lot, you know. And then I have my practising every day, and, oh dear, week after next school will begin. I just hate school, don't you, Gladys?\"  \"No, I love it; you know I do.\"  \"Well, I don't. I don't mind the lessons, but I hate to sit cooped up at a desk all day. I wish they'd have schools out of doors.\"  \"Yes, I'd like that, too. I wonder if we can sit together, this year, Mops?\"  \"Oh, I hope so. Let's ask Miss Lawrence that, the very first thing. Why, I'd die if I had to sit with any one but you.\"  \"So would I. But I'm sure Miss Lawrence will let us be together.\"  Gladys was a pretty little girl, though not at all like Marjorie. She was about the same age, but smaller, and with light hair and blue eyes. She was more sedate than Midget, and more quiet in her ways, but she had the same love of fun and mischief, and more than once the two girls had been separated in the schoolroom because of the pranks they concocted when together.  Miss Lawrence, their teacher, was a gentle and long-suffering lady, and she loved both little girls, but she was sometimes at her wits' end to know how to tame their rollicking spirits.  Gladys was as pleased as Marjorie at the prospect of the picnic. Often the Maynard children had their Ourdays without inviting other guests, but when outsiders were invited they always remembered the happy occasions.  All through the week preparations went on, and on Friday Ellen, the cook, gave up most of the day to the making of cakes and tarts and jellies. The next morning she was to get up early to fry the chicken and prepare the devilled eggs.  Mr. Maynard brought home candies and fruit from the city, and a huge can of ice-cream was ordered from the caterer.  The start was to be made at nine o'clock Saturday morning, for it was a long drive, and everybody wanted a long day in the woods.  Friday evening was fair, with a beautiful sunset, and everything boded well for beautiful weather the next day.  Rosy Posy, after her bread-and-milk supper, went happily off to bed, and dropped to sleep while telling her beloved Boffin of the fun to come. The other children dined with their parents, and the conversation was exclusively on the one great subject.  \"I don't think it _could_ rain; do you, Father?\" said Kitty, looking over her shoulder, at the fading sunset tints.  \"I think it _could_, my dear, but I don't think it will. All signs point to fair weather, and I truly believe we'll have a perfect Ourday and a jolly good time.\"  \"We always do,\" said Midge, happily. \"I wonder why all fathers don't have Ourdays with their children. Gladys' father never gets home till seven o'clock, and she has to go to bed at eight, so she hardly sees him at all, except Sundays, and of course they can't play on Sundays.\"  \"They must meet as strangers,\" said Mr. Maynard. \"I think our plan is better. I like to feel chummy with my own family, and the only way to do it is to keep acquainted with each other. I wish I could have a whole day with you every week, instead of only every month.\"  \"Can't you, Father?\" said Kitty, wistfully.  \"No, daughter. I have too much business to attend to, to allow me a holiday every week. But perhaps some day I can manage it. Are you taking a hammock to-morrow, King?\"  \"Yes, sir. I thought Mother might like an afternoon nap, and Rosy Posy always goes to sleep in the morning.\"  \"Thoughtful boy. Take plenty of rope, but you needn't bother to take trees to swing it from.\"  \"No, we'll take the chance of finding some there.\"  \"Yes, doubtless somebody will have left them from the last picnic. Your young friends are going?\"  \"Yes,\" said Marjorie. \"King and I asked the two Fultons, and Kitty asked Dorothy Adams. With all of us, and Nurse Nannie, that makes just ten.\"  \"And the driver of the wagon makes eleven,\" said Mr. Maynard. \"I suppose we've enough rations for such an army?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" said Mrs. Maynard, smiling. \"Enough for twenty, I think, but it's well to be on the safe side.\"  The children went to bed rather earlier than usual, in order to be up bright and early for the picnic.  Their play-clothes, which were invariably of blue and white striped seersucker, were laid out in readiness, and they fell asleep wishing it were already morning.  But when the morning did come!  Marjorie wakened first, and before she opened her eyes she heard an ominous sound that sent a thrill of dismay to her heart.  She sprang out of bed, and ran to the window.  Yes, it was not only raining, it was simply _pouring_.  One of those steady, determined storms that show no sign of speedy clearing. The sky was dark, leaden gray, and the rain came down in what seemed to be a thick, solid volume of water.  \"Oh!\" said Marjorie, with a groan of disappointment from her very heart.  \"Kitty,\" she said, softly, wondering if her sister were awake.  The girls had two beds on either side of a large room, and Midget tiptoed across the floor, as she spoke. Kitty opened her eyes sleepily. \"What is it, Midget? Time to get up? Oh, it's picnic day!\"  As Kitty became broad awake, she smiled and gaily hopped out of bed.  \"What's the matter?\" she said, in alarm, for Marjorie's face was anything but smiling.  For answer, Midget pointed out of the window, toward which Kitty turned for the first time.  \"Oh!\" said she, dropping back on the edge of the bed.  And, indeed, there seemed to be nothing else to say. Both girls were so overwhelmed with disappointment that they could only look at each other with despondent faces.  Silently they began to draw on their stockings and shoes, and though determined they wouldn't do anything so babyish as to cry, yet it was no easy matter to keep the tears back.  \"Up yet, chickabiddies?\" called Mr. Maynard's cheery voice through the closed door.  \"Yes, sir,\" responded two doleful voices.  \"Then skip along downstairs as soon as you're ready; it's a lovely day for our picnic.\"  Midge and Kitty looked at each other. This seemed a heartless jest indeed! And it wasn't a bit like their father to tease them when they were in trouble. And real trouble this surely was!  They heard Mr. Maynard tap at King's door, and call out some gay greeting to him, and then they heard King splashing about, as if making his toilet in a great hurry. All this spurred the girls to dress more quickly, and it was not long before they were tying each other's hair-ribbons and buttoning each other's frocks.  Then they fairly ran downstairs, and, seeing Mr. Maynard standing by the dining-room window, they both threw themselves into his arms, crying out, \"Oh, Father, isn't it _too_ bad?\"  \"What?\" asked Mr. Maynard, quizzically.  \"Now, Daddy,\" said Midget, \"don't tease. Our hearts are all broken because it's raining, and we can't have our picnic.\"  \"Can't have our picnic!\" exclaimed Mr. Maynard, in apparent excitement. \"Can't have our picnic, indeed! Who says we can't?\"  \"I say so!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23531"],["title","Marjorie's Busy Days (#4)"],["body","Kingdon, who had just entered the room. \"Nobody but ducks can have a picnic to-day.\"  \"Oh, well,\" said Mr. Maynard, looking crestfallen, \"if King says so that settles it. _I_ think it's a beautiful picnic day, but far be it from me to obtrude my own opinions.\"  Just here Mrs. Maynard and Rosy Posy came in. They were both smiling, and though no one expected the baby to take the disappointment very seriously, yet it did seem as if Mother might have been more sympathetic.  \"I suppose we can eat the ice-cream in the house,\" said Marjorie, who was inclined to look on the bright side if she could possibly find one.  \"That's the way to talk!\" said her father, approvingly. \"Now you try, Kingdon, to meet the situation as it should be met.\"  \"I will, sir. I'm just as disappointed as I can be, but I suppose there's no use crying over spilt milk,--I mean spilt raindrops.\"  \"That's good philosophy, my boy. Now, Kitty, what have you to say by way of cheering us all up?\"  \"I can't see much fun in a day like this. But I hope we can have the picnic on the next Ourday.\"  \"That's a brave, cheerful spirit. Now, my sad and disheartened crew, take your seats at the breakfast table, and listen to your foolishly optimistic old father.\"  The children half-heartedly took their places, but seemed to have no thought of eating breakfast.  \"Wowly-wow-wow!\" said Mr. Maynard, looking around the table. \"_What_ a set of blue faces! Would it brighten you up any if I should prophesy that at dinner-time to-night you will all say it has been the best Ourday we've ever had, and that you're glad it rained?\"  \"Oh, Father!\" said Marjorie, in a tone of wondering reproach, while Kitty and King looked blankly incredulous, and Mrs. Maynard smiled mysteriously.     CHAPTER IV  AN OURDAY   It was impossible to resist the infection of Mr. Maynard's gay good-nature, and by the time breakfast was over, the children were in their usual merry mood. Though an occasional glance out of the window brought a shadow to one face or another, it was quickly dispelled by the laughter and gaiety within.  Marjorie was perhaps the most disappointed of them all, for it was her day, and she had set her heart on the picnic in the woods. But she tried to make the best of it, remembering that, after all, father would be at home all day, and that was a treat of itself.  After breakfast, Mr. Maynard led the way to the living-room, followed by his half-hopeful brood. They all felt that something would be done to make up for their lost pleasure, but it didn't seem as if it could be anything very nice.  Mr. Maynard looked out of the front window in silence for a moment, then suddenly he turned and faced the children.  \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said; \"do any of you know the story of Mahomet and the mountain?\"  \"No, sir,\" was the answer of every one, and Marjorie's spirits sank. She liked to hear her father tell stories sometimes, but it was a tame entertainment to take the place of a picnic, and Mahomet didn't sound like an interesting subject, anyway.  Mr. Maynard's eyes twinkled.  \"This is the story,\" he began; \"sit down while I tell it to you.\"  With a little sigh Marjorie sat down on the sofa, and the others followed her example. Rosy Posy, hugging Boffin, scrambled up into a big armchair, and settled herself to listen.  \"It is an old story,\" went on Mr. Maynard, \"and the point of it is that if the mountain wouldn't come to Mahomet, Mahomet must needs go to the mountain. But to-day I propose to reverse the story, and since you four sad, forlorn-looking Mahomets can't go to the picnic, why then, the picnic must come to you. And here it is!\"  As Mr. Maynard spoke--indeed he timed his words purposely--their own carriage drove up to the front door, and, flying to the window, Marjorie saw some children getting out of it. Though bundled up in raincoats and caps, she soon recognized Gladys and Dick Fulton and Dorothy Adams.  In a moment they all met in the hall, and the laughter and shouting effectually banished the last trace of disappointment from the young Maynards' faces.  \"Did you come for the picnic?\" said Marjorie to Gladys, in amazement.  \"Yes; your father telephoned early this morning,--before breakfast,--and he said the picnic would be in the house instead of in the woods. And he sent the carriage for us all.\"  \"Great! Isn't it?\" said Dick Fulton, as he helped his sister off with her mackintosh. \"I thought there'd be no picnic, but here we are.\"  \"Here we are, indeed!\" said Mr. Maynard, who was helping Dorothy Adams unwind an entangling veil, \"and everybody as dry as a bone.\"  \"Yes,\" said Dorothy, \"the storm is awful, but in your close carriage, and with all these wraps, I couldn't get wet.\"  \"Oh, isn't it fun!\" cried Kitty, as she threw her arms around her dear friend, Dorothy. \"Are you to stay all day?\"  \"Yes, until six o'clock. Mr. Maynard says picnics always last until sundown.\"  Back they all trooped to the big living-room, which presented a cheerful aspect indeed. The rainy morning being chilly, an open fire in the ample fireplace threw out a cheerful blaze and warmth. Mrs. Maynard's pleasant face smiled brightly, as she welcomed each little guest, and afterward she excused herself, saying she had some household matters to attend to and that Mr. Maynard would take charge of the \"picnic.\"  \"First of all,\" said the host, as the children turned expectant faces toward him, \"nobody is to say, 'What a pity it rained!' or anything like that. Indeed, you are not to look out at the storm at all, unless you say, 'How fortunate we are under cover!' or words to that effect.\"  \"All right, sir,\" said Dick Fulton, \"I agree. And I think a picnic in the house will be dead loads of fun.\"  \"That's the way to talk,\" said Mr. Maynard, \"and now the picnic will begin. The first part of it will be a nutting-party.\"  \"Oho!\" laughed Marjorie. \"A nutting-party in the house is 'most too much! I don't see any trees;\" and she looked around in mock dismay.  \"Do you usually pick the nuts off of trees?\" asked her father, quizzically. \"You know you don't! You gather them after they have fallen. Now nuts have fallen all over this house, in every room, and all you have to do is to gather them. Each may have a basket, and see who can find the most. Scamper, now!\"  While Mr. Maynard was talking, Sarah, the waitress, had come in, bringing seven pretty baskets of fancy wicker-ware. One was given to each child, and off they ran in quest of nuts.  \"Every room, Father?\" called back Marjorie, over her shoulder.  \"Every room,\" he replied, \"except the kitchen. You must not go out there to bother cook. She has all she can attend to.\"  This sounded pleasant, so Marjorie went on, only pausing for one more question.  \"What kind of nuts, Father?\"  \"Gather any kind you see, my child. There was such a strong wind last night, I daresay it blew down all sorts.\"  And truly that seemed to be the case. Shrieks of surprise and delight from the whole seven announced the discoveries they made.  They found peanuts, English walnuts, pecan nuts, hazelnuts, Brazil nuts, almonds, hickory nuts, black walnuts, and some of which they didn't know the names.  The nuts were hidden in all sorts of places. Stuffed down in the cushions of chairs and sofas, on mantels and brackets, under rugs and footstools, on window sills, on the floor, on the chandeliers, they seemed to be everywhere. All over the house the children scampered, filling their baskets as they went.  Sometimes two would make a dash for the same nut, and two bumped heads would ensue, but this was looked upon as part of the fun.  The older children gathered their nuts from the highest places, leaving the low places for the little ones to look into.  Rosy Posy found most of those on the floor, behind the lace curtains or portières, as she toddled about with her basket on one arm and Boffin in the other.  At last the whole house had been pretty thoroughly ransacked, and the nutting-party returned in triumph with loaded baskets.  \"Did you look under the sofa pillows on the couch in this room?\" said Mr. Maynard, gravely, and seven pairs of legs scampered for the couch.  Under its pillows they found three big _cocoanuts_, and Mr. Maynard declared that completed the hunt.  Meantime, the big, round table in the middle of the room had been cleared of its books and papers, and the children were directed to empty their baskets of nuts on the table, taking care that none should roll off the edge. The seven basketsful were tumbled out, and a goodly heap they made.  Then the seven sat round the table, and to each one was given a tiny pair of candy tongs, such as comes with the confectioner's boxes.  \"This is a new game,\" explained Mr. Maynard, \"and it's called Jacknuts. It is played just the same as Jackstraws. Each, in turn, must take nuts from the heap with the tongs. If you jar or jostle another nut than the one you're taking away, it is then the next player's turn.\"  Of course they all knew how to play Jackstraws, so they understood at once, but this was much more fun.  \"The first ones are so easy, let's give Rosy Posy the first chance,\" said Dick Fulton, and Mr. Maynard, with a nod of approval at the boy, agreed to this plan. So Rosy Posy, her fat little hand grasping the tiny tongs, succeeded in getting nearly a dozen nuts into her basket.  As Dorothy Adams was not quite as old as Kitty, she took her turn next, and then all followed in accordance with their ages.  It was a fascinating game. Some of the little hazelnuts or the slender peanuts were easy to nip with the tongs, but the big English walnuts, or queer-shaped Madeira nuts were very difficult. Great delicacy of touch was necessary, and the children found the new game enthralling.  After her first turn Rosy Posy ran away from the game, and Mr. Maynard took her place.  \"Oho, Father,\" laughed Kitty, \"I thought you'd get them all, but you're no more successful at it than we are.\"  \"No,\" said Mr. Maynard, looking with chagrin at"]]]
