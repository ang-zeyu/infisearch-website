[Illustration]      A multitude muster'd, escaped from the plains,   Of sight-loving lasses and holiday swains:   Bob _Bantam_ push'd forward and strutted before;   Will _Woodpecker_ modestly tapp'd at the door;   Poor _Robin_, the rustic, a countrified clown,   As he blush'd, look'd too simple by half for the town,   There were scores in brown mantles, black, yellow, or green,   From the villages round, and among them were seen,   Luke _Linnet_, Sam _Swallow_, Mat _Martin_, and then,   Bill _Bullfinch_, Tom _Titmouse_, and Rosanna _Wren_.   But however select the fair party may be,   Where beauty and fashion preside, we shall see   Some characters doubtful that all should beware,   And it can't be denied that a few such were there.   Those cut-throats the _Sparrows_, that robber the _Daw_,   Who was pluck'd for his open contempt of the law;   The pilferer _Cuckoo_, whom all must despise,   And the chattering _Jay_, who tells nothing but lies;   While the green-mantled, light-hearted _Love-birds_, 'tis said,   Had been sipping too much, for their noses were red.      How often it is, when the sun is most bright,   That a dark cloud approaches, obscuring his light!   Alas! 'tis the same with all earthly affairs,   And pleasure gives place to a dark crowd of cares.   The _Trees_ were all lively, the _Beasts_ were content,   And the beautiful _Birds_ on their pleasure were bent,   Nothing doubting the multitude, struck with amaze,   Came to gaze on their beauty and speak in their praise   When they saw that the crowd by degrees had retired,   And that they left alone were no longer admired;   They gazed on the _Booths_ that were aptly design'd   To display the fair merchandize art had combined;   They look'd on the spot in wrath, spleen, and despair,   _Rank_, _Beauty_, _Taste_, _Fashion_, and _Fancy_ were there,   And the multitudes round such attractions preferr'd   To a gambolling _beast_ or a chattering _bird_.   Now Envy first enter'd the fair feather'd race,   And invective and dissonance rung round the place;   Their pleasure, their pride, and contentment were o'er,   And Discord presided where Peace was before.      In the midst of the hubbub and riot around,   The _Trees_ were absorb'd in a silence profound,   Till the busy _Dwarf Medlar_ began to explain   His rooted dislike to the booth-loving train.   He branch'd out in florid descriptions to show   That they all ought to stand on their stumps in a row   In defence of their rights, now that _underlings_ drew   That applause and renown which had long been their due.   Then the _Oak_ raised his head, rather hoary with age,   And shook his broad arms in the air in a rage,   And exhorted them all with a feeling of pride,   To maintain their ground firmly, whate'er might betide.   The _Giant Elm_ follow'd and proudly look'd down   On the pitiful plots of their foes with a frown.   The _Ash_, pale with anger, derided \"the crew,\"   And the smooth-temper'd _Purple Beech_ look'd rather blue.   The _Chesnut_ grew heated, and roasted them well;   And bitter the taunts of the _Almond-tree_ fell.   The _Apple_ and _Pear_ both maintain'd, in their spleen,   That the fruit of their folly would shortly be seen.   The _Laburnum_, the _Lime_, and the _Beech_ seem'd afraid,   But the _Hawthorn_ was pointed in all that she said,   And the threats of the _Elder_ were heard to abound--   Like pellets from popguns they rattled around.   Discontented and moody the _Drooping Larch_ lower'd,   The _Crab_ knit his brows, for his temper was sour'd;   While the _Birch_-tree declared that the ill-fated elves,   Their opponents, were making a rod for themselves.   With wrath and vexation the _Maple_ ran o'er;   The _Aspen_-tree trembled, the _Willow_ wept sore;   The _Tulip_-tree blush'd, and the _Sumach_-tree sigh'd,   And the _Dyer's Oak_ thought it a stain on their pride.   The _Fir_ stood erect, for he seem'd to opine   That their sun for a very brief season would shine;   While the well-meaning _Walnut_, foreboding their fall,   Crack'd a joke, for he cared not a fig for them all.   The _Poplar_ drew up with a feeling of scorn,   And the _Cypress_ looked sad, and the _Yew_ was forlorn.   The _Plane_ smoothly spoke, and the _Hazel_ the same,   But the _Scarlet Oak_ redden'd with anger and shame.   At last they resolved, to blot out the disgrace,   To stand fast by each other adorning the place;   No longer their loss of applause to bemoan,   But to come out next spring with a Fair of their own.      While the war-whoop was raised by the _Birds_ and the _Trees_,   The _Beasts_ were impatient to blow up a breeze.   The _Lion_ began with a royal bewail,   And furiously lash'd both his sides with his tail.   As he stalk'd through his den, his wild eyes glared around,   And his roar seem'd to come from far under the ground.   His anger, disdain, and despair wanted scope,   So he wish'd himself back at the Cape of Good Hope.   The _Tiger_ extended, in uttering a roar,   A mouth that you might have mistook for the door;   But in such a dilemma, I warn you, beware   How you enter in haste such a dark thoroughfare;   For all who have pass'd through the passage they say,   Have terribly painted their coats by the way.   Poor _Bruin_ declared it was unbearable quite,   And was in a brown study till day turn'd to night;   The _Axis_ turn'd round in his rage, and just then   The _Sloth_ look'd as black as the ink in my pen.   The soft, silky, self-colour'd _Puma_ felt pain,   Pale as ashes with anger he could not restrain;   The _Llama_ indignantly felt the disgrace,   And spirted saliva in every one's face;   In fury the _Mastiff_ bark'd loud for relief;   The poor patient _Camel_ was laden with grief;   The _Antelope_ wisely eloped from the fray,   But the _Springbok_ was booked for the rest of the day.   The wrath of the _Leopard_ then rose on the gale,   And broke out in dark spots from his head to his tail;   The _Civet Cat_ mew'd, and did nothing but fret,   And the stripes of the _Zebra_ were blacker than jet;   The _Opossum_ was posed, and looked wondrously sage,   And the _Red Coati Mondi_ turned sallow with rage;   The _Hy√¶na_ declared in a quarrelsome mood,   He would instantly break through his den--if he could:   And the _Moose Deer_ in ire would have bit his lip through,   But he found it already divided in two.   The Schoolmaster _Porcupine_ rang, too, the chimes,--   He declar'd that he'd send an address to \"_the Times_;\"   Nay, write all his quills to their stumps, ere he'd stand   As a laughing-stock thus to the rest of the land.      When the _Fair_ was concluded, and all the gay throng   Had abandon'd the feast and the dance and the song,   In quest of a calmer enjoyment to roam,   For \"Home,\" after every enjoyment, \"is Home!\"   The _Trees_ toss'd their heads 'tween the earth and the heavens,   And the _Birds_ and the _Beasts_ were at sixes and sevens.      But amid the confusion, the hubbub, and din,   All remember'd the proverb, \"_They laugh most who win!_\"   This was certainly true at the famed _Fancy Fair_;   _Mr. Cross_[2] was, they say, the most pleasant man there.   Let us hope, then, his genius was happily led   To allay the rude storm that hung over his head;--   That the future his spirited plans will repay   Through many a gladsome and prosperous day;   Make true the old saw, \"_All is well that well ends_,\"   And _Bipeds_ and _Quadrupeds_ once more be friends.

The finish was applied in the following manner: First, all the parts were well scraped and sandpapered, then the surface was covered with a coating of boiled linseed oil. After this had stood several hours, or until it had had time to penetrate the wood, the surplus liquid was wiped off with a flannel cloth. After the oil had stood for 48 hours, a thin coat of shellac was applied and allowed to harden overnight. The next morning this shellac was sandpapered lightly with No. 00 paper and a coat of floor wax was applied according to the directions which are found upon every can. Two more coats of wax were applied after intervals of half an hour and the finish was completed. The effect is very pleasing. The oil brings out the rich color of the wood and the shellac and wax serve to preserve the color. The following stock is needed:    1 top, 1 by 16-1/2 by 40-1/2 in., S-2-S.   4 posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 20 in., S-4-S.   2 rails, 7/8 by 4-1/4 by 36 in., S-2-S.   2 rails, 7/8 by 4-1/4 by 13 in., S-2-S.   2 lower rails, 7/8 by 2-1/2 by 13 in., S-2-S.   1 stretcher, 7/8 by 3-3/4 by 36 in., S-2-S.   6 slats, 3/8 by 1-1/4 by 11 in., S-2-S.  With the exception of the legs all the stock is specified mill-planed to thickness upon two surfaces. The legs are specified planed on four sides. Square the legs to length and the rails, stretcher, slats, etc., to width and length.  [Illustration: Detail of the Piano Bench]  Lay out and work the tenons of the rails and stretcher. The slats are best made without tenons, the whole end of each slat being \"housed\" into the rails. The reason for this is obvious--it is a difficult matter to fit two or more pieces between fixed parts when their ends are tenoned. When the ends are housed any slight variation in the lengths adjusts itself. It is necessary, however, to chisel the sides of the mortises carefully, but this is a simple matter compared with getting the shoulders of the tenons, etc., all just alike.  Assemble the parts, using good hot glue. Put the ends of the bench together first. When the glue has hardened on these, place the stretcher and side rails. Fasten the top to the frame from the under side, either by glued blocks and screws or by angle irons.     A LIBRARY TABLE   A library table of neat appearance and correct proportions is shown in the accompanying sketch and detail drawing. This table looks best when finished in quarter-sawed oak, although any of the other furniture woods can be used if desired. If the material is ordered from the mill cut to length, squared and sanded, much of the hard labor can be avoided. Order the following pieces:    4 legs, 2 by 2 by 30-1/4 in., S-4-S.   1 top, 1-1/8 by 30 by 42 in., S-4-S.   2 end pieces, 3/4 by 17-1/8 by 29 in., S-2-S.   2 top rails, 7/8 by 2 by 37 in., S-4-S.   2 top rails, 7/8 by 2 by 25-1/2 in., S-4-S.   1 lower brace, 3/4 by 2 by 32 in., S-4-S.   4 shelves, 3/4 by 7 by 29 in., S-4-S.   8 slats, 1/4 by 1-1/8 by 17-1/8 in., S-4-S.   2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 5-3/4 by 25 in., S-4-S.   4 drawer sides, 3/8 by 3-3/4 by 14 in., soft wood.   2 drawer ends, 3/8 by 3-3/8 by 24-1/4 in., soft wood.   2 drawer bottoms, 3/8 by 13-1/4 by 24-1/4 in., soft wood.   2 drawer supports, 3/4 by 2 by 23-1/2 in., soft wood.   2 drawer supports, 3/4 by 2 by 25 in., soft wood.   [Illustration: Detail of the Library Table]  Start work on the legs by beveling the tops and squaring them up and laying out the mortises for the shelves as shown in section BB. Care should be taken to get the legs mortised in pairs and all cut the same height. This is best done by placing the four legs side by side with the ends square, and then laying out the mortises across all four at once with a try-square.  [Illustration: The Finished Library Table]  The table top is made of several boards which are doweled and glued together. Be careful to get the best side of each board up and have the joints a tight fit. The corners should be cut out for the posts as shown. The posts are to be fastened to the board by means of screws. The holes can be counterbored for the heads and then plugged. The top rails are also fastened to the top board by means of screws.  The end pieces can now be made. Two or more boards will have to be glued together for these. The top corners will have to be cut to fit about the top rails. Cleats can be used in fastening them to the top board. The shelves also have the corners cut to fit into the mortises in the posts. They are held to the end boards by means of screws.  If the parts all fit perfectly square and tight, they can be glued and screwed together, which will complete the table except for the slats and drawers. The slats can be fastened on with nails, then the heads covered with fancy nails which can be secured for this purpose. The drawer supports can now be put in. They are screwed to the end boards as shown. A bottom brace should be fastened under the lower shelves to help steady the table. The two drawers are made as shown in the detail sketch. No handles are needed as the lower edge of the front board can be used for pulling them out.  When the table is complete it should be carefully gone over with fine sandpaper and all rough spots removed. Scrape the glue from about the joints as finish will not take where there is any glue. Apply the stain preferred or the one that matches the other furniture. This can be any of the many stains supplied by the trade for this purpose.     A PRINCESS DRESSER   A design of a princess dresser that is well proportioned and of pleasing appearance is shown in the accompanying sketch and detail drawing. The cost is very moderate and if a mill is not too far away, a great amount of labor can be saved by ordering the material ready cut to length, squared and sanded. Quarter-sawed oak should be used and the material needed will be as follows:  [Illustration: Dresser Made of Quarter-Sawed Oak]    4 posts, 1-3/4 by 1-3/4 by 27 in., S-4-S.   1 top board, 3/4 by 17 by 37 in.,"]]]
