It is the only way to know all their \"curves,\" all those little shadows of expression and small lights. There is a glamour which you never _see_ if you begin to read with a serious intention late in life, when questions of technique and grammar and mere words begin to seem too important.  Then you have become too critical to feel through all Fenimore Cooper's verbiage the real lakes and woods, or the wild fervour of romance beneath dear Sir Walter's mat of words. You lose the unreclaimable flavour of books. A friend you may irretrievably lose when you lose a friend--if you are so deadly unfortunate as to lose a friend--for even the memories of him are embittered; but no great author can ever have done anything that will make the book you love less precious to you.  The new school of pedagogical thought disapproves, I know, of miscellaneous reading, and no modern moralist will agree with Madame de Sévigné that \"bad books are better than no books at all\"; but Madame de Sévigné may have meant books written in a bad style, or feeble books, and not books bad in the moral sense. However, I must confess that when I was young, I read several books which I was told afterward were very bad indeed. But I did not find this out until somebody told me! The youthful mind must possess something of the quality attributed to a duck's back! I recall that once \"The Confessions of Rousseau\" was snatched suddenly away from me by a careful mother just as I had begun to think that Jean Jacques was a very interesting man and almost as queer as some of the people I knew. I believe that if I had been allowed to finish the book, it would have become by some mental chemical process a very edifying criticism of life.  \"Tom Jones\" I found in an attic and I was allowed to read it by a pious aunt, whom I was visiting, because she mixed it up with \"Tom Brown of Rugby\"; but I found it even more tiresome than \"Eric, or Little by Little,\" for which I dropped it. I remember, too, that I was rather shocked by some things written in the Old Testament; and I retorted to my aunt's pronouncement that she considered \"the 'Arabian Nights' a dangerous book,\" by saying that the Old Testament was the worst book I had ever read; but I supposed \"people had put something into it when God wasn't looking.\" She sent me home.  At home, I was permitted to read only the New Testament. On winter Sunday afternoons, when there was nothing else to do, I became sincerely attached to the Acts of the Apostles. And I came to the conclusion that nobody could tell a short story as well as Our Lord Himself. The Centurion was one of my favourite characters. He seemed to be such a good soldier; and his plea, \"Lord, I am not worthy,\" flashes across my mental vision every day of my life.  In the Catholic churches, a part of the Gospel is read every Sunday, and carefully interpreted. This always interested me because I knew in advance what the priest was going to read. Most of the children of my acquaintance were taught their Scriptures through the International Sunday-school lessons, and seemed to me to be submerged in the geography of Palestine and other tiresome details. For me, reading as I did, the whole of the New Testament was radiant with interest, a frankly human interest. There were many passages that I did not pretend to understand, sometimes because the English was obscure or archaic, and sometimes because my mind was not equal to it or my knowledge too small. Whatever may be the opinion of other people, mine is that the reading of the New Testament in the simplicity of childhood, with the flower of intuition not yet blighted, is one of the most beautiful of mental experiences. In my own case, it gave a glow to life; it caused me to distinguish between truth and fairy tales, between fact and fiction--and this is often very difficult for an imaginative child.  This kind of reading implies leisure and the absence of distraction. Unhappily, much leisure does not seem to be left for the modern child. The unhappy creature is even told that there will be \"something in Heaven for children to do!\" As to distractions, the modern child is surrounded by them; and it appears to be one of the main intentions of the present system of instruction not to leave to a child any moments of leisure for the indulgence of the imagination. But I am not offering the example of my childhood for imitation by the modern parents.  Nevertheless, it had great consolations. There were no \"movies\" in those days, and the theatre was only occasionally permitted; but on long afternoons, after you had learned to read, you might lose yourself in \"The Scottish Chiefs\" to your heart's content. It seems to me that the beauty of this fashion of leisurely reading was that you had time to visualize everything, and you felt the dramatic moments so keenly, that a sense of unreality never obtruded itself at the wrong time. It was not necessary for you to be told that Helen Mar was beautiful. It was only necessary for her to say, in tones so entrancing that you heard them, \"My Wallace!\" to know that she was the loveliest person in all Scotland. But \"The Scottish Chiefs\" required the leisure of long holiday afternoons, especially as the copy I read had been so misused that I had to spend precious half hours in putting the pages together. It was worth the trouble, however.  Before I could read, I was compelled on rainy days to sit at my mother's knee and listen to what _she_ read. I am happy to say that she never read children's books. Nothing was ever adapted to my youthful misunderstanding. She read aloud what she liked to read, and she never considered whether I liked it or not. It was a method of discipline. At first, I looked drearily out at the soggy city street, in which rivulets of melted snow made any exercise, suitable to my age, impossible. There is nothing so hopeless for a child as an afternoon in a city when the heavy snows begin to melt. My mother, however, was altogether regardless of what happened outside of the house. At two o'clock precisely--after the manner of the King in William Morris's \"Earthly Paradise\"--she waved her wand. After that, all that I was expected to do was to make no noise.  In this way I became acquainted with \"The Virginians,\" then running in _Harper's Magazine_, with \"Adam Bede\" and \"As You Like It\" and \"Richard III.\" and \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and \"Valentine Vox\"--why \"Valentine Vox?\"--and other volumes when I should have been listening to \"Alice in Wonderland.\" But when I came, in turn, to \"Alice in Wonderland,\" I found Alice's rather dull in comparison with the adventures of the Warrington brothers. And Thackeray's picture of Gumbo carrying in the soup tureen! To have listened to Rebecca's description of the great fight in \"Ivanhoe,\" to have lived through the tournament of Ashby de la Zouche, was a poor preparation for the vagaries of the queer creatures that surrounded the inimitable Alice.  There appeared to be no children's books in the library to which we had access. It never seemed to me that \"Robinson Crusoe\" or \"Gulliver's Travels\" or \"Swiss Family Robinson\" were children's books; they were not so treated by my mother, and I remember, as a small boy, going up to Chestnut Street in Philadelphia, with divine eagerness, to buy the latest number of a Dickens serial. I think the name of the shop--the shop of Paradise--which sold these books was called Ashburnham's. It may be asked how the episode in \"Adam Bede\" of Hetty and that of \"little Em'ly\" in Dickens struck the child mind. As I remember, the child mind was awed and impressed, by a sense of horror, probably occasioned as much by the force of the style, by the suggestions of an unknown terror, as by any facts which a child could grasp.  It was a curious thing that my mother, who had remarkably good taste in literature, admired Mrs. Henry Wood extravagantly. She also admired Queen Victoria. She never read \"East Lynne\" aloud, because, I gathered, she considered it \"improper\"; and Miss Braddon's \"Lady Audley's Secret\" came under the same ban, though I heard it talked of frequently. It was difficult to discover where my mother drew the line between what was \"proper\" and what was \"not proper.\" Shakespeare she seemed to regard as eminently proper, and, I noticed, hesitated and mumbled only when she came to certain parts of Ophelia's song. It seems strange now that I never rated Mrs. Henry Wood's novels with those of George Eliot or Thackeray or Dickens. There seemed to be some imperceptible difference which my mother never explained, but which I, instinctively, understood; and when Anthony Trollope's \"Orley Farm\" was read, I placed him above Mrs. Henry Wood, but not on an equality with Dickens or Thackeray.  _Harper's Magazine_, in those days, contained great treasure! There, for instance, were the delightful articles by Porte"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24003"],["title","Confessions of a Book-Lover (#1)"],["body","ayon--General Strothers, I think. These one listened to with pleasure; but the bane of my existence was Mr. Abbott's \"Life of Napoleon Bonaparte.\" It seemed to me as if it would never end, and it stretched as dolorously before me as that other fearful process which appalled my waking days--the knowledge that all my life I should be obliged to clean my teeth three times a day with powdered charcoal!  After a time, I began to read for myself; but the delights of desultory reading were gloomed by the necessity of studying long lessons that no emancipated child of to-day would endure. Misguided people sometimes came to the school and told childish stories, at which we all laughed, but which even the most illiterate despised. To have known George Warrington, to have mingled familiarly in the society of George Washington, to remember the picture of Beatrix Esmond coming down the stairs--I am not speaking of Du Maurier's travesties of that delightful book--to have seen the old ladies in \"Cranford,\" sucking their oranges in the privacies of their rooms, made one despise foolish little tales about over-industrious bees and robins which seemed not even to have the ordinary common sense of geese!  Suddenly, my mother became a devout Catholic. The scene changed. On one unhappy Sunday afternoon \"Monte Cristo\" was rudely snatched from my entranced hands. Dumas was on the list of the \"improper,\" and to this day I have never finished the episodes in which I was so deeply interested. Now the wagon of the circulating library ceased to come as in the old days. The children of the neighbours offered me Sunday-school books, taken from the precious store of the Methodist Sunday School opposite our house. They seemed to me to be stupid beyond all words. There was not one really good fight in them all, and after an honest villain like Brian de Bois Guilbert, the bad people in these volumes were very lacking in stamina. The \"Rollo\" books were gay compared to them. I concluded that if anything on earth could make a child hate religion, it was the perusal of these unreal books. My mother saw that I had Alban Butler's \"Lives of the Saints\" for Sunday reading. They were equally dull; and other \"Lives,\" highly recommended, were quite as uninspiring as the little volumes from the Protestant library. They were generally translated from the French, without vitality and without any regard for the English idiom. I recall, through the mists, sitting down one Sunday afternoon, to read \"The Life of Saint Rose of Lima.\" As it concerned itself with South America, it seemed to me that there might be in it a good fighter or two; or, at least, somebody might cut off the ear of a High Priest's servant as was done in the New Testament. But no, I was shocked to read in the very beginning, that       so pure was the little Saint, even in her infancy, that when her      uncle, who was her godfather, kissed her after her baptism, a rosy      glow, a real blush of shame, overspread her countenance.  In that book I read no more that day!  But I discovered a volume I have never forgotten, which probably after \"The Young Marooners,\" had the greatest influence on me for a short period. This was \"Fabiola,\" by Cardinal Wiseman. There was good stuff in it; it made me feel proud to be a Christian; it was full of thrills; and it taught a lot about the archæology of Rome, for it was part of that excellent story. I have always looked on \"Fabiola\" as a very great book. Then at Christmas, when my father gave me \"The Last Days of Pompeii,\" I was in a new world, not alien to the world of \"Fabiola,\" but in some way supplementary to it. This gift was accompanied by Washington Irving's \"Tales of the Alhambra.\" _Conspuez les livres des poupées!_ What nice little story books, arranged for the growing mind, could awaken such visions of the past, such splendid arabesques and trailing clouds of glory as this book! Read at the right time, it makes the pomegranate and the glittering crescents live forever, and creates a love for Spain and a romance of old Spain which can never die.  After this, I had a cold mental douche. I was given \"Les Enfants des Bois,\" by Elie Berthet in French, to translate word for word. It was a horrible task, and the difficulties of the verbs and the laborious research in the dictionary prevented me from enjoying the adventures of these infants. I cannot remember anything that happened to them; but I know that the book gave me an ever-enduring distrust of the subjunctive mood in the Gallic language. Somebody had left about a copy of a French romance called \"Les Aventures de Polydore Marasquin.\" It was of things that happened to a man in a kingdom of monkeys. It went very well, with an occasional use of the dictionary, until I discovered that the gentleman was about to engage himself to a very attractive monkeyess. I gave up the book in disgust, but I have since discovered that there have been lately several imitators of these adventures, which I think were written by an author named Léon Gozlan.  About this time, the book auction became a fashion in Philadelphia. If your people had respect for art, they invariably subscribed to a publication called the _Cosmopolitan Art Magazine_, and you received a steel engraving of Shakespeare and his Friends, with Sir Walter Raleigh very much in the foreground, wearing a beautifully puffed doublet and very well-fitting hose, and another steel engraving of Washington at Lexington. If your people were interested in literature, they frequented the book auctions. My father had a great respect for what he called \"classical literature.\" He considered Cowper's \"The Task\" immensely classical; it was beautifully bound, and he never read it. One day he secured a lovely edition of the \"Complete Works of Thomas Moore.\" It had been a subject of much competition at the auction, and was cherished accordingly. The binding was tooled. It was put on the centre table and adored as a work of art. Here was richness!  Tom Moore's long poems are no doubt classed at present as belonging to those old and faded gardens in which \"The Daisy\" and \"The Keepsake,\" by Lady Blessington, once flourished; but if I could only recall the pleasure I had in the reading of \"Lalla Rookh\" and \"The Veiled Prophet of Korhasson,\" I think I should be very happy. And the notes to \"Lalla Rookh\" and to Moore's prose novel of \"The Epicurean\"! \"The Epicurean\" was not much of a novel, but the notes were full of amazing Egyptian mysteries, which seemed quite as splendid as the machinery in the \"Arabian Nights.\" The notes to \"Lalla Rookh\" smelled of roses, and I remember as a labour of love copying out all the allusions to roses in these notes with the intention of writing about them when I grew up. My mother objected to the translations from Anacreon; she said they were \"improper\"; but my father said that he had been assured on competent authority that they were \"classic,\" and of course that settled it. There was no story in them, and they seemed to me to be stupid.  Just about this time, one of the book auctions yielded up a copy of the \"Complete Works of Miss Mitford.\" You perhaps can imagine how a city boy, who was allowed to spend two weeks each year at the most on the arid New Jersey seacoast, fell upon \"Our Village.\" It became an incentive for long walks, in the hope of finding some country lanes and something resembling the English primroses. I read and reread \"Our Village\" until I could close my eyes at any time and see the little world in which Miss Mitford lived. I tried to read her tragedy, \"The Two Foscari.\" A tragedy had a faint interest; but, being exiled to the attic for some offense against the conventionalities demanded of a Philadelphia child, with no book but Miss Mitford's, I spent my time looking up all the references to roses in her tragedies. These I combined with the knowledge acquired from Tom Moore, and made notes for a paper to be printed in some great periodical in the future. Why roses? Why Miss Mitford and roses? Why Tom Moore and roses? I do not know, but, when I was sixteen years of age, I printed the paper in _Appleton's Journal_, where it may still be found. My parents, who did not look on my literary attempts, at the expense of mathematics, with favour, suggested that I was a plagiarist, but as I had no time to look up the meaning of the word in the dictionary, I let it go. It simply struck me as one of those evidences of misunderstanding which every honest artist must be content to accept.  My mother, evidently fearing the influence of \"classical\" literature, gave me one day \"The Parent's Assistant,\" by Miss Edgeworth. I think that it was in this book that I discovered \"Rosamond; or The Purple Jar\" and the story of the good boy or girl who never cut the bit of string that tied a package; I sedulously devoted myself to the imitation of this economic child, and was very highly praised for getting the best out of a good book until I broke a tooth in trying to undo a very tough knot.  It was a far cry from the respectable Miss Edgeworth to a series of Beadle's \"Dime Novels.\" I looked on them as delectable but inferior. There was a prejudice against them in well-brought-up households; but if you thoughtfully provided yourself with a brown paper cover, which concealed the flaring yellow of Beadle's front page, you were very likely to escape criticism. I never finished \"Osceola, the Seminole,\" because my aunt looked over my shoulder and read a rapturous account of a real fight, in which somebody kicked somebody else violently in the abdomen. My aunt reported to my mother that the book was very \"indelicate\" and after that Beadle's \"Dime Novels\" were absolutely forbidden. At school, we were told that any boy who read Beadle's was a moral leper; but as most of us concluded that leper had something to do with leaper, the effect was not very convincing.  Perhaps I might have been decoyed back to Beadle's, for all the youngsters knew that there was "]]]
