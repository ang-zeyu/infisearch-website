The place where this occurred was near to those wild cliffs that rise out of the sea in the channels or straits that lie at the head of Baffin's Bay.  The vessel was now beyond the farthest point of land that had been discovered at the time of which I am writing, and already one or two of the headlands had been named by Captain Harvey and marked on his chart.  \"I don't like to see pancake-ice so early in the season,\" remarked the captain to Mr Mansell.  \"No more do I, sir,\" answered the mate.  \"This would be a bad place to winter in, I fear.\"  \"Land ahead!\" was shouted at that moment by the look-out at the masthead.  \"Keep her away two points,\" said the captain to the man at the helm. \"How does it lie?\"  \"Right ahead, sir.\"  \"Any ice near it?\"  \"No; all clear.\"  The brig was kept a little more out to sea.  Soon she came to more open water, and in the course of four hours was close to the land, which proved to be a low, barren island, not more than a mile across.  Here the wind died away altogether, and a sharp frost set in.  The pancakes became joined together, and on the following morning, when our friend Gregory came on deck, he found that the whole ocean was covered with ice!  It did not, indeed, look very like ice, because, being so thin, it did not prevent the usual swell from rolling over the sea.  A light breeze was blowing, and the brig cut her way through it for some time; but the breeze soon died away, leaving her becalmed within a quarter of a mile of the island.  For some time the voyagers hoped that a thaw would take place, or that wind would break up the ice.  But they were disappointed.  This was the first touch of the cold hand of winter, and the last day of the _Hope's_ advance northward.  Seeing this, Captain Harvey set energetically to work to cut his way into winter quarters, for it would not do to remain all winter in the exposed position in which his vessel then lay.  On his right was the island, already referred to, about a quarter of a mile off.  Beyond this, about five miles distant, were the high steep cliffs of the western coast of Greenland.  Everywhere else lay the open sea, covered here and there with floes and bergs, and coated with new ice.  This ice became so thick in the course of another night that the men could walk on it without danger.  By means of saws and chisels made for the purpose, they cut a passage toward the island, and finally moored the brig in a small bay which was sheltered on all sides except the east.  This, being the land side, required no protection.  They named the place \"Refuge Harbour.\"  Everyone was now full of activity.  The voyagers had reached the spot where they knew they were destined to spend the winter and much had to be done before they could consider themselves in a fit state to face that terrible season.  Winter in the Polar regions extends over eight months of the year--from September to May.  But so much of ice and snow remains there all the summer that winter can scarcely be said to quit those regions at all.  It is difficult to imagine what the Arctic winter is.  We cannot properly understand the tremendous difficulties and sufferings that men who go to the Polar seas have to fight against.  Let the reader think of the following facts, and see if he does not draw his chair closer to the fire and feel thankful that he has not been born an Eskimo, and is not an Arctic seaman!  Winter within the Arctic circle, as I have said, is fully eight months long.  During that time the land is covered with snow many feet deep, and the sea with ice of all degrees of thickness--from vast fields of ten or fifteen feet thick to bergs the size of islands and mountains-- all frozen into one solid mass.  There is no sunlight there, night or day, for three out of these eight winter months, and there is not much during the remaining five.  In summer there is perpetual sunlight, all night as well as all day, for about two months--for many weeks the sun never descends below the horizon.  It is seen every day and every night sweeping a complete circle in the bright blue sky.  Having been so free of his light in summer, the sun seems to think he has a right to absent himself in winter, for the three months of darkness that I have spoken of are not months of _partial_ but of _total_ darkness--as far, at least, as the sun is concerned.  The moon and stars and the \"Northern Lights\" do, indeed, give their light when the fogs and clouds will allow them; but no one will say that these make up for the absence of the sun.  Then the frost is so intense that everything freezes solid except pure spirits of wine.  Unless you have studied the thermometer you cannot understand the intensity of this frost; but for the sake of those who do know something about extreme cold, I give here a few facts that were noted down during the winter that my story tells of.  On the 10th of September these ice-bound voyagers had eighteen degrees of frost, and the darkness had advanced on them so rapidly that it was dark about ten at night.  By the 1st of October the ice round the brig was a foot and a half thick.  Up to this time they had shot white hares on the island, and the hunting parties that crossed the ice to the mainland shot deer and musk oxen, and caught white foxes in traps. Gulls and other birds, too, had continued to fly around them; but most of these went away to seek warmer regions farther south.  Walrus and seals did not leave so soon.  They remained as long as there was any open water out at sea.  The last birds that left them, (and the first that returned in spring) were the \"snow-birds\"--little creatures about the size of a sparrow, almost white, with a few brown feathers here and there.  The last of these fled from the darkening winter on the 7th of November, and did not return until the 1st of the following May.  When they left it was dark almost all day.  The thermometer could scarcely be read at noon, and the stars were visible during the day.  From this time forward thick darkness set in, and the cold became intense.  The thermometer fell _below_ zero, and after that they never saw it _above_ that point for months together--20 degrees, 30 degrees, and 40 degrees below were common temperatures.  The ice around them was ten feet thick. On the 1st of December noon was so dark that they could not see fifty yards ahead, and on the 15th the fingers could not be counted a foot from the eyes.  The thermometer stood at 40 degrees below zero.  The darkness could not now become greater, but the cold still continued to grow more intense.  It almost doubled in severity.  In January it fell to 67 degrees below zero!  So great was this cold that the men felt impelled to breathe gradually.  The breath issued from their mouths in white clouds of steam and instantly settled on their beards and whiskers in hoar-frost.  In the cabin of the _Hope_ they had the utmost difficulty in keeping themselves moderately warm at this time.  Things had now reached their worst, and by slow degrees matters began to mend.  On the 22nd of January the first faint sign of returning day appeared--just a blue glimmer on the horizon.  By the middle of February the light tipped the tops of the mountains on shore, and the highest peaks of the ice-bergs on the sea, and on the 1st of March it bathed the deck of the _Hope_.  Then the long-imprisoned crew began to feel that spring was really coming.  But there was little heat in the sun's rays at first, and it was not till the month of May that the ice out at sea broke up and summer could be said to have begun.  During all this long winter--during all these wonderful changes, our Arctic voyagers had a hard fight in order to keep themselves alive. Their life was a constant struggle.  They had to fight the bears and the walrus; to resist the cold and the darkness; to guard against treachery from the natives; and to suffer pains, sickness, and trials, such as seldom fall to the lot of men in ordinary climates.  How they did and suffered all this I shall try to show in the following pages.  In attempting this I shall make occasional extracts from the journal of our friend Tom Gregory, for Tom kept his journal regularly, and was careful to note down only what he heard and saw.    CHAPTER SIX.  PREPARATIONS FOR WINTERING--REMARKABLE ADVENTURES WITH A BEAR.  The first care of Captain Harvey, after getting his brig securely laid up in her icy cradle for the winter was to remove some of the stores to the island, where he had them carefully secured in a little hut which the crew built of loose stones.  This relieved the strain on the vessel, and permitted the free circulation of air.  The fitting up of the interior of the brig was then begun.  The wooden partition between the cabin and the hold was taken down, and the whole space thrown into one apartment.  The stove was put up in the centre of it, and moss was piled round the walls inside about a foot thick.  Moss was also spread on the deck, and above it the snow was allowed to gather, for snow, although so cold itself, keeps things that it covers warm, by not permitting the heat to escape.  The brig was banked up all round with snow, and a regular snowy staircase was built from the ice to her bulwarks.  They changed their time, now, from what is called sea-time to that which we follow on land.  That is to say, they reckoned the day to commence just after twelve, midnight, instead of dividing it into watches, as they were wont to do at sea.  Journals were begun, and careful notes made of everything that occurred, or that might in any way further the object for which they had gone there.  Every man in the ship had his appointed duty and his post.  If the native Eskimos should arrive in a warlike temper, each man had his cutlass and pistols in readiness.  If a bear should pay them a visit, each could lay hands on his musket in an instant; and if a fire should break "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23492"],["title","Fast in the Ice: Adventures in the Polar Regions (#6)"],["body","on board, every man had his bucket ready and his particular post fixed.  Some were to run to the water-hole, which it was the duty of one man to keep open.  Others were to station themselves from the hole to the ship to pass the buckets, while the rest were to remain on board to convey them to the point of danger.  Captain Harvey fixed all the arrangements, and superintended the carrying out of his orders in a general way, making his two officers and the young doctor responsible for the overseeing of details.  Each of these foremen furnished him with a report every night of what had been done during the day, and the result was noted down by himself in a journal.  Thus everything went smoothly and pleasantly along during the first weeks of their sojourn in their frozen home.  In regard to fresh provisions they were fortunate at first, for they obtained sufficient supplies of deer and other game.  This was in the early part of winter, while there was still plenty of daylight.  In Tom Gregory's journal I find it thus written:  \"_September 10th_.--The days are beginning to shorten now, and we are all busily occupied in preparing for the long, dark winter that is before us.  Sam Baker, who is the best shot among us, brought in a deer to-day.  This is fortunate, for we stand in need of fresh meat.  Our greatest enemy this winter, I fear, will be scurvy.  Unless we obtain a large supply of fresh provisions we cannot hope to escape it.  Crofts brought in two Arctic hares.  They are beautiful creatures--pure white-- and each weighs about seven pounds.  These, with the four deer shot by myself last week and the ten hares got by Baker, will keep us going for some time.  \"_September 12th_.--I had an adventure with a polar bear last night, which has amused the men very much, and given them food for jocularity for a few days.  Some days back Davy Butts set a trap on the island, in which he has caught a few foxes.  Last night his long legs were so tired that he did not care to visit his trap, so I offered to go instead of him.  It was while I was out on this errand that I happened to meet with bruin.  Our meeting was sudden and unexpected on both sides, I believe. It was midnight when I set off to the trap, which was not more than half a mile from the ship, and it was quite dark when I reached it.  \"Davy is an ingenious fellow.  His trap is made of four blocks of hard snow, with a sort of wooden trigger that goes off the moment the bait is touched, and allows a heavy log to fall down on the poor fox's back. There was no fox there, however, when I reached it.  I went down on my knees and was examining the bait, when I heard a low growl.  I leaped up, and felt for the knife which I usually carried in my belt.  It was not there!  In the haste of my departure from the ship I had forgotten to buckle it on.  I had no gun, of course.  It was too dark to shoot, and I had not counted on meeting with any dangerous enemy.  I could only crouch down behind a lump of ice and hope that the bear would go away, but another growl, much louder than the first, and close at hand, showed that I had been seen.  It was so dark that I could hardly see fifty yards ahead.  There was a great chasm or hole just in front of me.  This was the place where the main body of the sea-ice had been separated from the shore-ice that was aground.  Here every rise and fall of the tide had broken it afresh, so that the rent was twenty yards wide, and full of large blocks that had been tossed about in confusion.  Across this I gazed into the gloom, and thought I saw an object that looked like a large block of rounded ice.  Before I could make up my mind how to act, the block of ice rose up with a furious roar and charged me.  The chasm checked him for a moment.  But for this I should have been caught immediately.  While he was scrambling over it I took to my heels, and ran along the edge of the ice at the top of my speed.  \"There was a narrow part of the chasm which I had looked at in daylight, and wondered whether I might venture to leap across it.  I had made up my mind that it was too wide and dangerous to be attempted.  But it is wonderful how quickly a man changes his mind on such a point when a polar bear is roaring at his heels.  I came to the gap in the ice.  It was ten feet deep and thirteen or fourteen feet across.  The jagged lumps of ice at the bottom lay there in horrible confusion.  There was barely light enough to see where the hole was when I came within ten yards of it, but I did not hesitate.  A rush! a bound! and I went over like a cat.  Not so the bear.  He had not measured the place with his eye in daylight, as I had done.  He made a gallant leap, it is true, but fell short, as I knew from the bursting sound and the growl of rage with which he came against the edge of the ice, and fell back among the broken blocks.  I did not wait to see how he got out, you may be sure, but ran as I never ran before in all my life!  I reached the brig quite out of breath.  The bear had not followed me up, for I did not see him that night again.  Long Davy laughed at me a good deal, and said he was sure I had been frightened at a shadow.  It gave a wonderfully loud roar for a shadow!  I hope that Davy himself may get a chase before the winter is over, just to convince him of his error in not believing me!\"  The kind wish thus expressed in the young doctor's journal was gratified sooner than might have been expected.  Only two days after the incident above described, poor Davy Butts met with the same bear, face to face, and had a run for his life, that turned the laugh from Tom Gregory to himself.  It was on the afternoon of a clear, cold day, just about sunset.  The men had finished dinner and were smoking their pipes on deck, stamping their feet and slapping their hands and arms, to keep them warm.  \"Hallo, Davy! where are you bound for?\" inquired the captain, on observing that Butts was wrapping himself carefully in his fur-coat, tightening his belt, and putting on his mittens as if bent on a long journey.  \"I'm only goin' to take a look at my fox-trap, sir, if you'll allow me.\"  \"Certainly, my lad.  If you get a fox it's well worth the trouble.  And hark'ee, Davy, take your axe and make one or two more of these snow-traps of yours.  It will be a well-spent hour.\"  \"Why, Butts,\" exclaimed Gregory, \"what do you mean to do with that big horse-pistol?  Surely you are not afraid of bears after laughing so much at the one that chased me?\"  \"Oh, no, not _afraid_, you know,\" replied Davy.  \"But there's no harm in being armed.\"  \"Mind you shoot him straight in the eye, or send a bullet up his nose. Them's the vulnerable parts of him,\" cried Joe Davis, with a laugh, as Butts went down the snow-steps and got upon the ice.  \"I say,\" cried Pepper, as he was moving away.  \"Well?\"  \"Bring his tongue aboard with you, and I'll cook it for supper.\"  \"Ah, and a bit of fat to fry it in,\" added the steward.  \"There's nothin' like tongue fried in bear's grease.\"  \"No, no, Dawkins,\" said Mr Dicey.  \"Hallo!  Davy; bring the 'ams. Bear's 'ams are considered fustrate heatin'.\"  \"No, _don't_ bring the hams,\" shouted Jim Croft, \"fetch the tongue; that's the thing for supper of a cold night--fetch the tongue, lad.\"  \"Hold your own tongue,\" shouted Davy, in reply, as he went off amid the laughter of his comrades.  The sun sank soon after, and before the ingenious seaman had finished two new traps the short twilight had gradually deepened into night. Still there was plenty of light, for the sky was clear, and studded with a host of stars.  In addition to this the Aurora Borealis was sending its beautiful flashes of pale-green light all across the western sky.  The Aurora--which also goes by the names of \"Northern Lights,\" and \"Streamers,\" and \"Merry-dancers,\" is seen in great splendour in these northern skies.  When the seaman had finished his traps, and looked up for a minute or two at the sky, before starting on his return to the ship, he beheld the Aurora extending over the heavens in the form of an irregular arch.  It was extremely bright, but the brightness was not the same in all parts.  It moved and waved gently about like a band of thin green fire.  Every now and then long tongues or streamers darted up from it, and these were brighter than the rest.  They were yellowish white, and sometimes became pale pink in colour.  The light from this beautiful object was equal to that of the moon in her quarter, and the stars that were behind it shone dimly through, as if they were covered with a thin gauze veil.  While Davy was gazing in wonder at the splendid lights above him, a deep growl fell upon his ear.  If the man had been a Jack-in-the-box he could not have leaped more quickly round.  His pistol was out and cocked in a moment!  The growl was followed by a roar, which drove all the blood back into Davy's heart, and seemed to freeze it there--solid.  The man was no coward, as was quite clear, for at first he boldly stood his ground.  But he would have been more than mortal if he had not felt some strange qualms about his heart when he saw a large white bear rushing furiously toward him.  The animal came this time from the interior of the small island.  The seaman knew well the place over which young Gregory had jumped when he had been chased.  After wavering for a moment or two he turned and fled.  Another tremendous roar helped him over the ice like a deer, and he took the chasm with a bound like an India-rubber ball.  It must certainly have been the same animal that chased Gregory, for, instead of trying to leap the chasm, it went to another part of the rent and scrambled across.  This gave Butts time to increase the distance between them, but a man is no match for a polar bear in a race.  The monster was soon close up with him, and the ship still far off.  The man knew his danger; he turned, took a quick aim, and fired.  He missed, of course; flung the pistol in desperation in"]]]
