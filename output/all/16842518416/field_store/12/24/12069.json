Auntie Prim thinks they won't any of 'em come.\"  \"Oh, yes, they will! their mammas said they might.\"  \"Hope they won't!\" said Flaxie, stamping her foot so hard that a \"hop-toad\" thought there was an earthquake, and hurried out of the way. \"Hope they won't, any of 'em! I'm not agoin' to go to it myself,--so there!\"  Milly peeped up in surprise.  \"I hate it, Milly Allen; let's run away!\"  \"Why, Flaxie Frizzle!\" was all Mabel could say, for the idea of a little girl's running away from her own party was truly amazing.  \"You think I don't dare,\" said Flaxie; \"but I do dare! I'm agoin' right off in the woods, and stay there! And I _thought_ you's agoin' with me. You're my twin cousin, and it's your party as much as 'tis mine.\"  Milly knew this was very wrong, and ought to have said so to Flaxie. If they had already done one foolish thing, it would make it no better to do another foolish thing, as _you_ can see in a moment. But Milly wanted to please Flaxie, so she said stoutly:  \"Oh, yes, I'm going!\"  Silly children! Flaxie pretended she was running away from her party, but she didn't mean to _stay_ away. Oh, no! She wouldn't have missed the party for anything. Even now she was beginning to wonder what Dora was baking.  The woods were deep and high and dark. Before they had gone quarter of a mile Flaxie wanted to turn back, but waited for Milly to speak first.  \"Oh dear!\" cried Milly, trembling, for she had never been in such a place before. \"You s'pose it's night, Flaxie? Has the sun set?\"  \"No, it hasn't. But we ought to brought a imbreller; it's goin' to rain,\" replied Flaxie, holding out her hand to catch a drop. \"I didn't spect you'd be so 'fraid, Milly Allen; but if you _are_ afraid, we'll go right home this minute.\"  They turned, but the wrong way, and instead of going home, only struck deeper into the woods. They didn't see the sky at all, and all the light seemed to come from the gay leaves and the gold of Flaxie's hair; for I am sorry to say she had lost her hat.  \"Ha' pas' two; ha' pas' two,\" said she dreamily. \"Let's go home to the party.\"  \"Thought you hated the old party,\" said Milly, falling over a dead tree, and crying.  \"Well, I was only in fun. Don't you know when I'm in fun, you goosie?\"  You see they were both getting cross as well as hungry, for dinner-time was past long ago. In another hour they were half-starved.  \"I spect we're lost,\" said Flaxie, calmly. \"Going to rain, too; sun setting. Pretty near midnight--\"  Upon this Milly began to scream.  \"Well, then, what made you hide behind the lilac-bush, and not invite the folks, Milly Allen?\" exclaimed Flaxie, feeling obliged to scold _somebody_; and then she too began to scream, though nobody heard, for they were three or four miles from the village.  They wound in and out, in and out, among the trees; but it was like a little bird putting his head through the bars of his cage. It did no good at all; they couldn't get out.  Thoroughly tired at last and discouraged, the poor babes in the wood lay down and fell asleep in each other's arms. I know it was a pretty sight,--the black head and the golden head so close together, and the beautiful bright trees bending over to say, \"Good night.\"     CHAPTER II.  STAYING OUT TO TEA.   But before the robins had had time to cover them with leaves, or even to think of it, there was a shout from Preston Gray.  \"Hurrah, boys, I've found 'em!\"  He and half a dozen other lads had been out all the afternoon in search of the little wanderers, and here it was five o'clock. They carried them home on their backs, taking turns, and Flaxie looked up only once to ask sleepily:  \"Is it ha' pas' two?\"  \"Won't she catch it, though?\" said Bert Abbott, who was in great awe of Mrs. Prim.  But Mrs. Prim was a just woman, and she thought poor little Flaxie's punishment had been hard enough. Her party was over long ago; the guests hadn't stayed to supper, and had gone home saying they \"didn't think Flaxie was very polite,\" and they \"wouldn't go to her parties any more.\" And here she was, tired and wretched, and scratched all over by blackberry bushes. No, Auntie Prim didn't even scold. She merely looked through her spectacles at grandma, and said, \"Children are so absurd!\"  And grandma replied sorrowfully:  \"Well, they have to suffer for their own naughtiness, and that does grieve me!\"  \"They ought to suffer,\" said Mrs. Prim; \"it is the only way they can learn not to behave so again.\"  Dear little Milly heard this, and remembered it, and repeated it to her mother the next week when she went home to Hilltop. She thought _she_ had suffered so much that she should never be \"absurd\" again, even to please her beloved Flaxie Frizzle.  After she had gone away, Flaxie wandered drearily about the house, saying, \"Oh dear! what shall I do without my twin cousin?\"  You would have thought she had enough left to make her happy. Dr. Gray's house stood on a hill facing the river, with a green yard in front, and a stable and two gardens behind it. It was all beautiful, and Flaxie enjoyed the stable as well as the fruit and flower gardens, for she was very fond of the horses, Whiz and Hiawatha, and the cows and the hens. You needn't tell anybody, but I do pity children who never hunted for hens' nests: it is such capital fun! And then there was the handsome dog, Tantra-Bogus, one of Flaxie's best friends.  In the house she had her \"splendid Dr. Papa;\" her dear brother Preston, who could whittle all sorts of things with a penknife; her darling Grandma Gray, an old lady with white hair, white cap, and white ribbons; and last, but not least, she had the \"beautifullest baby\" Philip, who could stand on his head \"just as cunning,\" and \"hug grizzly\"--that is, like a grizzly bear. Flaxie loved him with her whole heart, but there were moments when she felt half ashamed of him, for he was eighteen months old, and hadn't a sign of a tooth; wasn't it awful?  \"Perhaps he'll cut one before your mother and Julia come home; I keep hoping so,\" said grandma, feeling in baby's mouth with her finger, which baby bit hard, like an old rogue as he was.  \"Will they give him some gold teeth, if his don't ever cut?\" asked Flaxie anxiously. \"Preston says they will.\"  \"No,\" replied Mrs. Prim, who sat by the window, with her little ebony work-box on a stand beside her. \"Your brother Preston says very absurd things merely in sport; but you must not be so foolish as to believe them.\"  Down dropped Flaxie's head in grandma's lap, her hair falling over grandma's black silk apron in a golden shower.  Mrs. Prim looked surprised. She did not know that Flaxie really _had_ believed in those gold teeth, and had been comforted by thinking how Phil would outshine everybody by-and-by! And now the poor little girl was crying because it was all a mistake, and because Mrs. Prim had said she was \"foolish.\"  \"Run and let in the cat,\" said grandma; \"don't you hear her mewing?\"  When Kitty Gray was let in, she came bringing a mouse, and Flaxie laughed to see her run right up to grandma and rub against her dress.  \"Good pussy, pretty pussy,\" said grandma, stroking the cat, who almost purred her heart out for joy. Not a mouse did she ever catch but she brought it to grandma or mamma to show it; but she never brought one to Mrs. Prim. I wonder why not.  \"Now let her out, Mary,\" said grandma to Flaxie. \"And go ask Dora if it isn't almost time to make the gravy for dinner.\"  When Flaxie skipped away, grandma said to Mrs. Prim, \"The poor child is lonesome, with nothing to do.\"  \"She ought to do something,\" replied Mrs. Prim, making a knot in her silk. \"If she were my little girl, I should send her to school, to occupy her mind.\"  \"Should you?\" said Grandma Gray, hesitating, and patting her white curls. \"Her mother said there were some naughty children about here, and she might be led into mischief at school, while Julia is away.\"  \"I'm sure she is led into mischief at home,\" said Mrs. Prim.  \"Very true. Perhaps she would be quite as safe at school. I will talk to her father about it,\" said Grandma Gray.  And of course Dr. Papa said, \"Just as you please;\" and Flaxie was sent to school with her satchel and books.  She came home the first day very dirty, after the dinner was cold, and Auntie Prim wondered if such a child ought to have any pudding.  \"Oh, auntie,\" said Flaxie, shaking her flying hair, \"I saw a little girl down under the hill, and says I, 'What's your name?' and says she, 'Patty C. Proudfit.' And I thought you'd want me to go down and play with her, and I did.\"  This was the first Mrs. Prim had ever heard of \"Patty C. Proudfit,\" and grandma knew nothing about her either; but Preston said the Proudfit family had just moved into town, \"a whole army of 'em, and lived in that black house under the hill.\"  Next day, as Mrs. Prim was looking out of the window, she saw Flaxie and Miss Patty playing dolls under the trees. Patty was two years older than Flaxie, but her red hair had not been combed lately, her dress was torn, and her shoes were out at the toes.  \"She is not a nice child; I am sorry to see this,\" sighed Mrs. Prim, turning away from the window. \"But as Mrs. Gray is coming home next week, I shall do nothing about it.\"  Flaxie's mind was \"occupied\" now, and she gave very little trouble in the house. Patty was \"a dear, sweet, good little girl,\" she said, \"and she loved her next as much as her twin cousin.\"  But you can't be quite happy in this world; and Patty's baby brother, only nine months old, had cut four whole teeth, and I won't say this wasn't a trial to Flaxie.  \"Poh, but they're eeny-teeny things,\" said she to grandma. \"Phil's will be lots and lots bigger--when he gets 'em.\"  Patty came up to the fence one day, where Flaxie stood smelling a geranium leaf.  \"How do you do?\" said she.  \"I do as I please, 'cause Auntie Prim is gone,\" replied little Flaxie, with a saucy smile. She was really very bold and naughty sometimes, as you have already found out, I suppose.  \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23540"],["title","The Twin Cousins (#2)"],["body","home?\"  \"No, she's coming back to-night, I s'pect, and bring grammy a cap. No, I don't s'pect she'll _ever_ go home,\" said Flaxie, shaking her little head sadly.  \"Well, she's gone now, ain't she, this whole afternoon? And why can't you come up to my house and see me?\"  Flaxie knew why. It was because she ought to help amuse the baby. Dora had been making peach preserves all day, and it was too hard for Grandma Gray to take care of Phil alone. But Flaxie asked all the same, \"May I go?\" and grandma never could say \"no\" when little folks teased, so she answered, \"Yes, and stay till half-past four; no longer.\"  Nothing was said about supper; but the children thought there would be time enough for that, and breakfast too, almost--it seemed so very long till half-past four.  \"Very well,\" said Patty's mother, when they went into the smoky kitchen, where she was holding the baby that had four teeth. \"Very well, you may both run out to play, and when it is time to call you in, I'll ring the bell.\"  There wasn't much to play with, except sand right in the middle of the road; but Flaxie had never been allowed as much dirt as she wanted, and this seemed very pleasant for a change. It would have been pleasanter still if her conscience had felt easy. She was only six years old, but she knew perfectly well when her actions were right and when they were wrong.  \"I never saw such a splendid visit,\" said she, when Mr. Proudfit kindly allowed her and Patty to feed the pigs. \"But _don't_ they have the awfullest-looking smell?\" added she, gazing thoughtfully into the pen, which was dirty, like everything else about the place. Her own nice frock was already soiled, but she tried not to see it, and not to think how Auntie Prim would stare at it through her spectacles.  \"Why, what's that?\" said she.  It was, oh dear! it was the bell; and there was Mrs. Proudfit at the back door ringing it. Grown people are always thinking what time it is; they never forget.  \"I'm sorry you can't stay to tea, Miss Flaxie,\" said Mrs. Proudfit, politely.  \"Oh, I guess I can; I'll go ask grammy,\" replied the little girl, dashing off up the hill, followed by Patty.  \"Oh, grammy, they want me to stay _orf'ly_,\" she cried, out of breath, before they got to the house.  \"Well, stay another hour, then,\" said the dear grandma, though baby was very cross and her arms ached, and Flaxie could have been _such_ a help.  So Flaxie went back and stayed another hour, and _then_ it wasn't tea-time. She could see some blue and white dishes spread on a round table covered with an oil-cloth, and she could smell gingerbread baking in the oven, which made her very hungry; and just as Mrs. Proudfit was opening a can of preserves, with at least six children clinging to her skirts, who should come but Preston, to say it was half-past five and Flaxie was wanted at home.  \"So you can't stay to tea, after all,\" said Mrs. Proudfit, putting a small covered dish on the table. What in the world could be in it?  Flaxie dropped her head and blushed. \"Oh, yes'm, I can stay. I've sent Preston home, and locked the door!\"  Mrs. Proudfit smiled into the oven as she looked at her gingerbread, and thought--of course she did--that Flaxie Frizzle was a very queer child.  It did seem as if that gingerbread never would bake! A cloud came up, the wind blew, the baby cried so Patty couldn't play, the children quarrelled, and the kitten ran round in a fit.  Nothing seemed half as nice as it had seemed an hour ago; and when supper was ready, that gingerbread was burnt, and, as true as you live, the preserves were sour! There was nothing in the little covered dish but cheese, which Flaxie \"despised;\" and she wished she hadn't stayed to tea, for it was a very poor tea indeed.  It began to rain just as hard as it could pour, and Dr. Papa came for her in the carriage, without a single smile on his face.  When she got home there was mamma, looking grieved and surprised,--the dear mamma she hadn't seen for three weeks. And there was \"Ninny,\" her sweet sister Julia, who had come and found out about her actions, and brought her a new doll.  \"Baby has cut a tooth, too,\" said Auntie Prim; \"but he's asleep now, and you can't see it to-night.\"  This was the last drop.  \"I feel as if my heart was breaking,\" sobbed Flaxie, tottering up-stairs behind her mother. \"I don't care if Baby Proudfit _has_ got fo--ur teeth; they're _very_ small!\"  \"I'm afraid you didn't have a good time, dear?\"  \"No'm, for Baby Proudfit's _so_ squirmy and wigglesome! But they wanted me to stay _orf'ly_!\"  \"And oh, mamma,\" burst forth Flaxie, at last, \"if you'll forgive me, I'll never stay _anywhere_ to tea any more, as long as I live!\"  \"We'll talk about it to-morrow,\" said Mrs. Gray.  And then she put poor little Flaxie to bed.     CHAPTER III.  THE LONESOME VISIT.   Flaxie came down to breakfast next morning feeling rather humble, but nobody noticed her, for they were all talking about the cat. The cellar-door had been left unfastened, and Kitty Gray had come up about midnight bringing a nice fat mouse. She mewed a long time, hoping her mistress would get out of bed and stroke her, and say, \"Good pussy, pretty pussy!\" But as Mrs. Gray would not rise, what do you think Kitty Gray did, for this is a true story?  She just walked into the dining-room where the table was always set overnight, jumped up to Mrs. Gray's place by the waiter, and dropped the mouse beside her plate!  \"There,\" thought pussy, \"she'll see it now first thing in the morning, before she turns the coffee; and if she doesn't say 'Good pussy, pretty pussy,' why--I'll eat it!\"  Of course when Mrs. Gray saw such a droll morsel lying on her napkin she laughed, sent for Kitty Gray, stroked her, and called her \"Good pussy, pretty pussy; and the brightest pussy too that I ever saw!\"  Even Mrs. Prim was laughing, and Flaxie began to hope her own behavior of yesterday was forgotten. But no, her mother called her into the nursery after breakfast, and said, as she took her in her lap:  \"I am sorry to hear that my little girl has done so many wrong things since I have been gone.\"  Flaxie dropped her head for shame, but raised it again indignantly.  \"How'd you know that, mamma? Auntie Prim must have gone and told.\"  \"Yes, darling, I asked her to tell. Isn't it right for mamma to know all her child has been doing?\"  \"Yes'm,\" replied Flaxie, watching a fly walk on the ceiling.  \"And I thought perhaps you would like to talk with me about it, dear.\"  \"One, two, three, four, five,\" said Flaxie to herself, counting the rosebuds in the carpet. Strange her mamma should suppose she wanted to talk about it! Why, there wasn't a subject in the world so disagreeable as her own naughtiness!  Mrs. Gray waited patiently till the rosebuds were counted, and then Flaxie spoke.  \"O mamma, you think I was bad yesterday, but do you _s'pose_ I'd have gone off if I'd known my little brother's tooth was a-cutting?\"  Mrs. Gray smiled down at the innocent, upturned face.  \"Well, darling, whether he cut a tooth or not, had you any excuse for staying to tea?\"  \"No'm. They didn't have a bit good supper at Patty's house, and I oughtn't to have stayed.\"  \"Mary,\" said Mrs. Gray,--she thought her little daughter was old enough now to be called by her true name, so she never used the baby name of Flaxie Frizzle,--\"Mary, I do not wish you to play any more with this little girl till I have seen her.\"  \"No'm.\"  \"Have you anything else to tell me?\"  \"I don' know. Well, yes. Well, I--I--I am so sorry I ran away from my party, mamma. Ever so long ago. I s'pect Auntie Prim told of that too?\" said Flaxie, twisting herself into odd shapes, for the thought of that unfortunate affair filled her with shame.  \"Yes, Mary, she did.\"  \"Well, I felt so sorry, mamma. And Milly 'n' I, we didn't get but one tart and one piece o' cake; for auntie had a party with 'em her own self. Do you think 'twas right when she made 'em for Milly and me?\"  Here Flaxie's eyes flashed.  \"My child, we are talking of you now, not Auntie Prim.\"  \"Yes'm, I know it, and I'm real sorry I'm so naughty; but Auntie Prim _makes_ me naughty.\"  \"Mary, Mary, you must not talk so about that good woman!\"  \"Oh, I know she's good, mamma. Why, she is the best woman in this town; she's the best woman in the world! And she _knows_ she's good, and it makes her just as proud!\"  Now Mrs. Prim really was a person who _seemed_ to be proud of her goodness, and Flaxie had described her very well; but Mrs. Gray said again:  \"Mary, we are talking of you now, not of Auntie Prim.\"  \"Oh dear, I don't like to! I s'pect you think I don't try to be good; but, mamma, I do! I try real hard. But,\" said the little girl, patting her chest and her side, \"there's something in me that's naughty clear through.\"  The tears had come now and were dropping over the little fat hands, for in spite of her queer way of talking, Flaxie felt really unhappy about her bad conduct; though perhaps nobody but her mother would have believed it.  These two good friends had a long talk,--the kind mamma and her little daughter who meant to do better,--and when Ninny came to call them to dinner, Flaxie said, joyfully,  \"O Ninny, I'm going to begin new, and you mustn't 'member I ever was naughty.\"  That was the way Mrs. Gray forgave her children; she put their naughtiness far off and never talked of it any more. Is that the way God forgives _his_ children?  After this, Flaxie was one of the most charming little girls you ever saw for two whole months. She said it was because Mrs. Prim was gone; but of course it was simply because she tried harder to be good; that was all. Toward the last of the winter, Uncle Ben Allen, Milly's father, passed through Laurel Grove on business, and spent the night at Dr. Gray's.  \"When I go home to-morrow,\" said he, \"I'd like to take one of these little girls. Have you one to spare?\"  Now he knew very well which he wanted, but it wouldn't have been polite to say so; he wanted Julia. "]]]
