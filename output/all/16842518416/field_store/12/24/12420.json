If you take any of my money I shall be sure to find it out, if I am blind.\"  \"Don't mind him, Frank,\" said Dick, in a low voice.  \"What's that?\" asked the blind man, suspiciously. \"What are you two whispering about?\"  \"I told Frank not to mind the way you spoke,\" said Dick.  \"Your friend will lend you some, then.\"  \"Not much,\" answered Dick, laughing. \"I'm dead-broke. Haven't you got any money, Mr. Mills?\"  \"I have a little,\" grumbled the blind man; \"but this boy may take it, and never come back.\"  \"If you think so,\" said Frank, proudly, \"you'd better engage some other boy.\"  \"No use; you're all alike. Wait a minute, and I'll give you some money.\"  He drew from his pocket a roll of scrip, and handed one to Frank.  \"I don't think that will be enough,\" said Frank. \"It's only five cents.\"  \"Are you sure it isn't a quarter?\" grumbled Mills.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"What do you say,--you, Dick?\"  \"It's only five cents, sir.\"  \"Is that twenty-five?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Then take it, and mind you don't loiter.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And be sure to bring back the change.\"  \"Of course I will,\" said Frank indignantly, resenting his employer's suspicion.  \"What do you think of him, Frank?\" asked Dick, as they descended the stairs.  \"I don't like him at all, Dick,\" said Frank, decidedly. \"I wish I could get something else to do.\"  \"You can, after a while. As you have no capital you must take what you can get now.\"  \"So I suppose; but I didn't come to the city for this.\"  \"If you don't like it you can leave in a few days.\"  This Frank fully resolved to do at the first favorable opportunity.  Dick showed him where he could buy the articles he was commissioned to purchase; and Frank, after obtaining them, went back to the tenement-house.  Mills scrupulously demanded the change, and put it back into his pocket. Then he made Frank pour out the ale into a glass. This he drank with apparent zest, but offered none to Frank.  \"Ale isn't good for boys,\" he said. \"You can cut the bread, and eat two slices. Don't cut them too thick.\"  The blind man ate some of the bread himself, and then requested Frank to help him on with his coat and vest.  \"I haven't taken any money to-day,\" he said \"I must try to collect some, or I shall starve. It's a sad thing to be blind,\" he continued, his voice changing to a whine.  \"You don't look blind,\" said Frank, thoughtfully. \"Your eyes are open.\"  \"What if they are?\" said Mills, testily. \"I cannot see. When I go out I close them, because the light hurts them.\"  Led by Frank, the blind man descended the stairs, and emerged into the street.     CHAPTER IV.  \"PITY THE BLIND.\"   \"Where shall I lead you?\" asked Frank.  \"To Broadway first. Do you know Broadway?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Be careful when we cross the street, or you will have me run over.\"  \"All right, sir.\"  \"If any one asks you about me, say I am your uncle.\"  \"But you are not.\"  \"What difference does that make, you little fool?\" said the blind man, roughly. \"Are you ashamed to own me as your uncle?\"  Frank felt obliged, out of politeness, to say \"No;\" but in his own mind he was not quite sure whether he would be willing to acknowledge any relationship to the disagreeable old man whom he was leading.  They reached Broadway, and entered a store devoted to gentlemen's furnishing goods.  \"Charity for a poor blind man!\" whined Mills, in the tone of a professional beggar.  \"Look here, old fellow, you come in here too often,\" said a young salesman. \"I gave you five cents yesterday.\"  \"I didn't know it,\" said Mills. \"I am a poor blind man. All places are alike to me.\"  \"Then your boy should know better. Nothing for you to-day.\"  Frank and his companion left the store.  In the next they were more fortunate. A nickel was bestowed upon the blind mendicant.  \"How much is it?\" asked Mills, when they were on the sidewalk.  \"Five cents, sir.\"  \"That's better than nothing, but we ought to do better. It takes a good many five-cent pieces to make a dollar. When you see a well-dressed lady coming along, tell me.\"  Frank felt almost as much ashamed as if he were himself begging, but he must do what was expected of him. Accordingly he very soon notified the blind man that a lady was close at hand.  \"Lead me up to her, and say, Can you spare something for my poor, blind uncle?\"  Frank complied in part, but instead of \"poor, blind uncle\" he said \"poor, blind man.\" Mills scowled, as he found himself disobeyed.  \"How long has he been blind?\" asked the lady, sympathetically.  \"For many years,\" whined Mills.  \"Is this your boy?\"  \"Yes, ma'am; he is my young nephew, from the country.\"  \"You are fortunate in having him to go about with you.\"  \"Yes, ma'am; I don't know what I should do without him.\"  \"Here is something for you, my good man,\" said the lady, and passed on.  \"Thank you, ma'am. May Heaven bless you!\"  \"How much is it?\" he asked quickly, when the lady was out of hearing.  \"Two cents,\" answered Frank, suppressing with difficulty an inclination to laugh.  \"The mean jade! I should like to wring her neck!\" muttered Mills. \"I thought it was a quarter, at least.\"  In the next store they did not meet a cordial reception.  \"Clear out, you old humbug!\" shouted the proprietor, who was in ill-humor. \"You ought to be put in the penitentiary for begging about the streets.\"  \"I pray to God that you may become blind yourself,\" said Mills, passionately.  \"Out of my store, or I'll have you arrested, both of you!\" said the angry tradesman. \"Here, you boy, don't you bring that old fraud in this store again, if you know what's best for yourself.\"  There was nothing to do but to comply with this peremptory order.  \"He's a beast!\" snarled Mills; \"I'd like to put his eyes out myself.\"  \"You haven't got a very amiable temper,\" thought Frank. \"I wouldn't like to be blind; but even if I were, I would try to be pleasanter.\"  Two young girls, passing by, noticed the blind man. They were soft-hearted, and stopped to inquire how long he had been blind.  \"Before you were born, my pretty maid,\" said Mills, sighing.  \"I have an aunt who is blind,\" said one of the girls; \"but she is not poor, like you.\"  \"I am very poor,\" whined Mills; \"I have not money enough to pay my rent, and I may be turned out into the street.\"  \"How sad!\" said the young girl, in a tone of deep sympathy. \"I have not much money, but I will give you all I have.\"  \"May God bless you, and spare your eyes!\" said Mills, as he closed his hand upon the money.  \"How much is it?\" he asked as before, when they had passed on.  \"Twenty-five cents,\" said Frank.  \"That is better,\" said Mills, in a tone of satisfaction.  For some time afterwards all applications were refused; in some cases, roughly.  \"Why don't you work?\" asked one man, bluntly.  \"What can I do?\" asked Mills.  \"That's your lookout. Some blind men work. I suppose you would rather get your living by begging.\"  \"I would work my fingers to the bone if I could only see,\" whined Mills.  \"So you say; but I don't believe it. At any rate, that boy of yours can see. Why don't you set him to work?\"  \"He has to take care of me.\"  \"I would work if I could get anything to do,\" said Frank.  As he spoke, he felt his hand pressed forcibly by his companion, who did not relish his answer.  \"I cannot spare him,\" he whined. \"He has to do everything for me.\"  When they were again in the street, Mills demanded, roughly, \"What did you mean by saying that?\"  \"What, sir?\"  \"That you wanted to go to work.\"  \"Because it is true.\"  \"You are at work; you are working for me,\" said Mills.  \"I would rather work in a store, or an office, or sell papers.\"  \"That wouldn't do me any good. Don't speak in that way again.\"  The two were out about a couple of hours, and very tiresome Frank found it. Then Mills indicated a desire to go home, and they went back to the room in the old tenement-house. Mills threw himself down on the bed in the corner, and heaved a sigh of relief.  \"Now, boy, count the money we have collected,\" he said.  \"There's ninety-three cents,\" Frank announced.  \"If I had known it was so near a dollar we would have stayed a little longer. Now, get me my pipe.\"  \"Where is it, sir?\"  \"In the cupboard. Fill it with tobacco, and light it.\"  \"Are you not afraid of setting the bedding on fire, sir?\"  \"Mind your own business. If I choose to set it on fire, I will,\" snarled Mills.  \"Very well, sir; I thought I'd mention it.\"  \"You have mentioned it, and you needn't do it again.\"  \"What a sweet temper you've got!\" thought Frank.  He sat down on a broken chair, and, having nothing else to do, watched his employer. \"He looks very much as if he could see,\" thought Frank; for Mills now had his eyes wide open.  \"What are you staring at me for, boy?\" demanded his employer, rather unexpectedly.  \"What makes you think I am staring at you, sir?\" was Frank's natural question. \"I thought you couldn't see.\"  \"No more I can, but I can tell when one is staring at me. It makes me creep all over.\"  \"Then I'll look somewhere else.\"  \"Would you like to do some work, as you said?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Then take twenty-five cents, and buy some evening papers and sell them; but mind you bring the money to me.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Frank, with alacrity.  Anything he thought would be better than sitting in that dull room with so disagreeable a companion.  \"Mind you don't run off with the money,\" said the blind man, sharply. \"If you do I'll have you put in the Tombs.\"  \"I don't mean to run away with the money,\" retorted Frank, indignantly.  \"And when you've sold the papers, come home.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  With a feeling of relief, Frank descended the stairs and directed his steps to the Park, meaning to ask Dick Rafferty's advice about the proper way to start in business as a newsboy.     CHAPTER V.  FRANK THROWS UP HIS SITUATION.   Frank found his friend on Park Row, and made known his errand.  \"So old Mills wants you to sell papers for his benefit, does he?\"  \"Yes, but I'd rather"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24013"],["title","The Telegraph Boy (#3)"],["body","it than to stay with him.\"  \"How much has he agreed to pay you?\"  \"That isn't settled yet.\"  \"You'd better bring him to the point, or he won't pay you anything except board and lodging, and mighty mean both of them will be.\"  \"I won't say anything about it the first day,\" said Frank. \"What papers shall I buy?\"  \"It's rather late. You'd better try for Telegrams.\"  Frank did so, and succeeded in selling half a dozen, yielding a profit of six cents. It was not a brilliant beginning, but he was late in the field, and most had purchased their evening papers. His papers sold, Frank went home and announced the result.  \"Umph!\" muttered the blind man. \"Give me the money.\"  \"Here it is, sir.\"  \"Have you given me all?\" sharply demanded Mills.  \"Of course I have,\" said Frank, indignantly.  \"Don't you be impudent, or I will give you a flogging,\" said the blind man, roughly.  \"I am not used to be talked to in that way,\" said Frank, independently.  \"You've always had your own way, I suppose,\" snarled Mills.  \"No, I haven't; but I have been treated kindly.\"  \"You are only a boy, and I won't allow you to talk back to me. Do you hear?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then take care to remember.\"  \"You've got a sweet disposition,\" thought Frank. \"I won't stay with you any longer than I am obliged to.\"  Several days passed without bringing any incidents worth recording. Frank took a daily walk with the blind man, sometimes in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon. These walks were very distasteful to him. The companion of a beggar, he felt as if he himself were begging. He liked better the time he spent in selling papers, though he reaped no benefit himself. In fact, his wages were poor enough. Thus far his fare had consisted of dry bread with an occasional bun. He was a healthy, vigorous boy, and he felt the need of meat, or some other hearty food, and ventured to intimate as much to his employer.  \"So you want meat, do you?\" snarled Mills.  \"Yes, sir; I haven't tasted any for a week.\"  \"Perhaps you'd like to take your meals at Delmonico's?\" sneered the blind man.  Frank was so new to the city that this well-known name did not convey any special idea to him, and he answered \"Yes.\"  \"That's what I thought!\" exclaimed Mills, angrily. \"You want to eat me out of house and home.\"  \"No, I don't; I only want enough food to keep up my strength.\"  \"Well, you are getting it. I give you all I can afford.\"  Frank was inclined to doubt this. He estimated that what he ate did not cost his employer over six or eight cents a day, and he generally earned for him twenty to thirty cents on the sale of papers, besides helping him to collect about a dollar daily from those who pitied his blindness.  He mentioned his grievance to his friend, Dick Rafferty.  \"I'll tell you what to do,\" said Dick.  \"I wish you would.\"  \"Keep some of the money you make by selling papers, and buy a square meal at an eatin' house.\"  \"I don't like to do that; it wouldn't be honest.\"  \"Why wouldn't it?\"  \"I am carrying on the business for Mr. Mills. He supplies the capital.\"  \"Then you'd better carry it on for yourself.\"  \"I wish I could.\"  \"Why don't you?\"  \"I haven't any money.\"  \"Has he paid you any wages?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then make him.\"  Frank thought this a good suggestion. He had been with Mills a week, and it seemed fair enough that he should receive some pay besides a wretched bed and a little dry bread. Accordingly, returning to the room, he broached the subject.  \"What do you want wages for?\" demanded Mills, displeased.  \"I think I earn them,\" said Frank, boldly.  \"You get board and lodging. You are better off than a good many boys.\"  \"I shall want some clothes, some time,\" said Frank.  \"Perhaps you'd like to have me pay you a dollar a day,\" said Mills.  \"I know you can't afford to pay me that. I will be satisfied if you will pay me ten cents a day,\" replied Frank.  Frank reflected that, though this was a very small sum, in ten days it would give him a dollar, and then he would feel justified in setting up a business on his own account, as a newsboy. He anxiously awaited an answer.  \"I will think of it,\" said the blind man evasively, and Frank did not venture to say more.  The next day, when Mills, led by Frank, was on his round, the two entered a cigar-store. Frank was much surprised when the cigar-vender handed him a fifty-cent currency note. He thought there was some mistake.  \"Thank you, sir,\" he said; \"but did you mean to give me fifty cents?\"  \"Yes,\" said the cigar-vender, laughing; \"but I wouldn't have done it, if it had been good.\"  \"Isn't it good?\"  \"No, it's a counterfeit, and a pretty bad one. I might pass it, but it would cost me too much time and trouble.\"  Frank was confounded. He mechanically handed the money to Mills, but did not again thank the giver. When they returned to the tenement-house, Mills requested Frank to go to the baker's for a loaf of bread.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Here is the money.\"  \"But that is the counterfeit note,\" said Frank, scrutinizing the bill given him.  \"What if it is?\" demanded Mills, sharply.  \"It won't pass.\"  \"Yes, it will, if you are sharp.\"  \"Do you want me to pass counterfeit money, Mr. Mills?\"  \"Yes, I do; I took it, and I mean to get rid of it.\"  \"But you didn't give anything for it.\"  \"That's neither here nor there. Take it, and offer it to the baker. If he won't take it, go to another baker with it.\"  \"I would rather not do it,\" said Frank, firmly.  \"Rather not!\" exclaimed Mills, angrily. \"Do you pretend to dictate to me?\"  \"No, I don't, but I don't mean to pass any counterfeit money for you or any other man,\" said Frank, with spirit.  Mills half rose, with a threatening gesture, but thought better of it.  \"You're a fool,\" said he. \"I suppose you are afraid of being arrested; but you have only to say that I gave it to you, and that I am blind, and couldn't tell it from good money.\"  \"But you know that it is bad money, Mr. Mills.\"  \"What if I do? No one can prove it. Take the money, and come back as quick as you can.\"  \"You must excuse me,\" said Frank, quietly, but firmly.  \"Do you refuse to do as I bid you?\" demanded Mills, furiously.  \"I refuse to pass counterfeit money.\"  \"Then, by Heaven, I'll flog you!\"  Mills rose and advanced directly towards Frank, with his eyes wide open. Fortunately our hero was near the door, and, quickly opening it, darted from the room, pursued by Mills, his face flaming with wrath. It flashed upon Frank that no blind man could have done this. He decided that the man was a humbug, and could see a little, at all events. His blindness was no doubt assumed to enable him to appeal more effectively to the sympathizing public. This revelation disgusted Frank. He could not respect a man who lived by fraud. Counterfeit or no counterfeit, he decided to withdraw at once and forever from the service of Mr. Mills.  His employer gave up the pursuit before he reached the street. Frank found himself on the sidewalk, free and emancipated, no richer than when he entered the service of the blind man, except in experience.  \"I haven't got a cent,\" he said to himself, \"but I'll get along somehow.\"     CHAPTER VI.  FRANK GETS A JOB.   Though Frank was penniless he was not cast down. He was tolerably familiar with the lower part of the city, and had greater reliance on himself than he had a week ago. If he had only had capital to the extent of fifty cents he would have felt quite at ease, for this would have set him up as a newsboy.  \"I wonder if I could borrow fifty cents of Dick Rafferty,\" considered Frank. \"I'll try, at any rate.\"  He ran across Dick in City-Hall Park. That young gentleman was engaged in pitching pennies with a brother professional.  \"I say, Dick, I want to speak to you a minute,\" said Frank.  \"All right! Go ahead!\"  \"I've lost my place.\"  Dick whistled.  \"Got sacked, have you?\" he asked.  \"Yes; but I might have stayed.\"  \"Why didn't you?\"  \"Mills wanted me to pass a counterfeit note, and I wouldn't.\"  \"Was it a bad-looking one?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then you're right. You might have got nabbed.\"  \"That wasn't the reason I refused. If I had been sure there'd have been no trouble I wouldn't have done it.\"  \"Why not?\" asked Dick, who did not understand our hero's scruples.  \"Because it's wrong.\"  Dick shrugged his shoulders.  \"I guess you belong to the church,\" he said.  \"No, I don't; what makes you think so?\"  \"Oh, 'cause you're so mighty particular. I wouldn't mind passing it if I was sure I wouldn't be cotched.\"  \"I think it's almost as bad as stealing to buy bread, or anything else, and give what isn't worth anything for it. You might as well give a piece of newspaper.\"  Though Frank was unquestionably right he did not succeed in making a convert of Dick Rafferty. Dick was a pretty good boy, considering the sort of training he had had; but passing bad money did not seem to him objectionable, unless \"a fellow was cotched,\" as he expressed it.  \"Well, what are you going to do now?\" asked Dick, after a pause.  \"I guess I can get a living by selling papers.\"  \"You can get as good a livin' as old Mills gave you. You'll get a better bed at the lodgin'-house than that heap of rags you laid on up there.\"  \"But there's one trouble,\" continued Frank, \"I haven't any money to start on. Can you lend me fifty cents?\"  \"Fifty cents!\" repeated Dick. \"What do you take me for? If I was connected with Vanderbuilt or Astor I might set you up in business, but now I can't.\"  \"Twenty-five cents will do,\" said Frank.  \"Look here, Frank,\" said Dick, plunging his hands into his pocket, and drawing therefrom three pennies and a nickel, \"do you see them?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, it's all the money I've got.\"  \"I am afraid you have been extravagant, Dick,\" said Frank, in disappointment.  \"Last night I went to Tony Pastor's, and when I got through I went into a saloon and got an ice-cream and a cigar. You couldn't expect a feller to be very rich after that. I say, I'll lend you five cents if you want it.\"  \"No, thank you, Dick. I'll wait till you are richer.\" "]]]
