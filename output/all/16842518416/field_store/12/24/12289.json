Planes from one direction crossed a certain patch of sea.  They were not wholly clear of it when planes from another part of the horizon swept over the same area, barely wave-tip high. Planes from the west raced over this one delimited space, and planes from the north almost shouldered them aside, and then planes from the east covered that same mile-square patch of sea, and then more planes from the south....  They followed each other in incredible procession, incredibly precise. The water on that mile-square space developed white dots, which always vanished but never ceased. Spume-spoutings leaped up three feet, or ten, or twenty and disappeared, and then there were others which spouted up one yard, or two, or ten. There were innumerable temporary whitecaps. The surface became pale from the constant churning of new foam-patches before the old foam died.  Then, with absolute abruptness, the planes flew away from the one square mile of sea. The late-comers climbed steeply. Abruptly, behind them, there were warning booms. Then monstrous masses of spray and bubbles and blue water leaped up three hundred feet, four hundred feet, five....  A square mile of ocean erupted as the planes climbed up and away from it. There were bombs in the ocean--some had sunk down deep. Others followed in close succession. Many, many burdens of bombs had been dropped into the sea as plane-fleet after plane-fleet went by.  The sea exploded in monstrous columns. Ton, half-ton and two-ton bombs began to detonate, fifty fathoms down. The Mekinese duty-officer below had just learned that the spies' signalling device was cut off, when a detonation lifted the hull of the Mekinese cruiser and shook it violently. Another twisted its tail and crushed it. A bomb hit sea bottom a quarter-mile away. More bombs exploded still nearer, in close contact with the giant hull. A two-ton bomb clanked into contact with its metal plating and burst.  The cruiser's duty-officer, cowering, thrust over the emergency-lever which would put the ship through pre-recorded commands faster than orders could be spoken.  Rockets flared, deep under water. But the flames set off bombs and the rocket-nozzles cracked and were useless. A midship compartment was flooding. A forward compartment's wall caved in, and still bombs burst.... The skipper of the assassin cruiser screamed an order to fire all missiles. They were already set on target. They were pre-set for the spot where the space-navy of Kandar waited to rise.  They did not. One missile was blasted as the cover of its launcher-tube opened. Another was blown in half when partly out of its tube and a third actually rammed a sinking bomb and vanished with it when it exploded.  The huge thing under the sea heaved itself up blindly. It reached the surface. But it was shattered and rent and dying, and planes dived vengefully upon it and blasted apart whatever could be seen in the roaring foam. So the blinded, suffering thing of metal only emptied itself of air and went down to the bottom again, where more bombs ripped and tore it.  The atmosphere-fliers of Kandar swung in a gigantic, ballooning circle about the spot where they had dropped a good fraction of a ton of bombs to the square yard. But nothing stirred there any more. Still, the planes flew in a great, deadly band about it until a flitterboat came out from shore and lowered a camera and a light by long, long cords.  There was no space-cruiser at the bottom of the sea. There was evidence of one, yes. There were patches of plating, and there were naked, twisted girders. The dangling underwater camera faithfully reported what it saw by the light that was lowered with it. But there was no space-cruiser. There were only the rather small fragments of what had been one a little while before.  Captain Bors went back to the palace. He was savagely pleased. He and the air-fleet men had done something. They'd had some satisfaction. They'd killed some Mekinese and ruined a plan to assassinate the Kandar fleet. But they'd only gotten an immediate satisfaction. Kandar was still to be conquered. Nothing important had changed.  Bors made his way to the king's study. He entered. King Humphrey the Eighth and the Pretender of Tralee were listening doubtfully to a stout man. The man was Morgan.  He stopped talking and blinked at Captain Bors. The captain ignored royal etiquette and spoke to him without first greeting the king.  \"The ship was there, as you said. We smashed it. Thank you. Is there any more information you can give us?\"     Chapter 2   At the spaceport, carefully selected persons filed onto the space-liner _Vestis_. It was not officially believed that the other three great chartered ships would arrive before the Mekinese fleet. It was, in fact, rather likely that none of the information given by Talents, Incorporated was ever believed until the event confirmed the prediction. In the case of the first liner, those who went on board had been chosen by a strict principle of priority. Men who would merely be imprisoned when Mekin took over had no privilege of escape. Not yet. Those who were destined for execution as soon as a quisling government was formed, were also not entitled to depart on the liner. But those who had conspicuously supported King Humphrey in his resistance to intimidation; those who had encouraged others to object to concessions which could only be forerunners of other concessions; those who had spoken and written and labored to spread information about the facts of life under Mekin, would not merely be imprisoned or executed. They would be tortured. So they were entitled to first chance at escape.  The space-liner blasted off some six hours after its arrival. It vanished blessedly into overdrive where it could not be intercepted. It headed for the far-away world of Trent, where its passengers would be allowed to land as refugees and where, doubtless, they would speak bitterly about Mekin for all the rest of their lives. But the government of Mekin would not care.  Mekin was a phenomenon so improbable that only those who were students of past civilizations could really believe it. There were innumerable references to such r√©gimes in the histories of ancient Earth. There was, for example, Napoleon, said people informed about such matters. With a fraction of a fraction of one per cent of the French people actively cooperating, he overawed the rest and then took over a nation which was not even his own. Then he took over other nations where less than a fraction of a fraction of one per cent concurred. Then he took soldiers from those second-order conquests to make third-order conquests, and then soldiers from the third to make fourth.  There was Mussolini, said the learned men. He had organized a group of rowdies and gangsters, and began by levying protection-money on gambling-houses and even less reputable resorts, and with the money increased his following. He had murdered those who opposed him and presently he collected protection money from even the great business corporations of his country, financing more political gangsterism until he ruled his nation for himself and his confederates.  And there was Hitler, said the historically-minded. In the beginning his followers never dared show themselves in the uniforms they adopted, because their fellow-countrymen hated everything they stood for. But before the end came they worshipped him. They murdered millions at his command, but they died because of him, too.  There was Lenin, and there was Stalin. Specialists in history could talk very learnedly about the developments on Mekin which paralleled the cabals headed by Lenin, and later, Stalin. Theirs was a much more durable organization than those of Napoleon and Mussolini and Hitler.  The ruling clique on Mekin had begun in this manner.  Mekin had once had a cause to which all its officials paid lip-service and some possibly believed in. Because of this cause it was the organization and not the individual who was apotheosized. Therefore, there could be fierce battles among members of the ruling class. There could be conspiracies. The last three dictators of Mekin had been murdered in palace revolutions, and the current dictator was more elaborately protected from his confreres than any mere hereditary tyrant ever needed to be. But Mekin remained a strong and dynamic world, engaged in the endless subjugation of other worlds for a purpose nobody really remembered any more.  Against such a society, a planet like Kandar was helpless. Mekin could not be placated nor satisfied with less than the subjugation and the ruin of its neighbors. For a time, Kandar had tried to arm for its own defense. It had a space-fleet which in quality was probably equal to Mekin's, but in quantity was hopelessly less. Also it had a defensive policy. It did not dream of any but a defensive war. And no war was ever won by mere defense. There could be no defense against the building-up of tensions, the contriving of incidents, the invention of insults. It had been proved often enough. Eventually there was an ultimatum, and there was surrender, and then the installation of a puppet government and the ruthless bleeding of another captured planet for the benefit of the rulers of Mekin.  The process was implacable. There was nothing to be done but submit, flee or die. Various parts of Kandar's population chose one or another course. Four great liners would carry away those who could be helped to flee. The mass of the people must submit, the fighting forces savagely made ready to die.  But in the cabinet meeting after the destruction of the hidden enemy cruiser, the tone was set by highly practical men. Bors was present at the meeting. He'd destroyed the cruiser. He was to be questioned about it. He had Morgan standing by to explain the part of Talents, Incorporated if required.  King Humphrey said heavily, \"This is probably the last"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23845"],["title","Talents, Incorporated (#4)"],["body"," meeting before the coming of the Mekinese. I do not think oratory is called for. I put the situation as it stands. A fleet will come from Mekin for our answer to their ultimatum. Our space-fleet will not surrender. Our air force is openly mutinous at the idea of submission. It has been said that if we fight, our planet will be bombed from space until all its air is poison, so that every living creature here will die. If this is true, I do not think that even we who plan to fight have the right to bring such a bombing about. But I doubt if that is true. There has been one incident. Whether one likes it or not, it has happened. Captain Bors has reason to hope that the space-fleet, by fighting to the death, can actually benefit the rest of our people.\"  Bors spoke, excitement coloring his words.  \"It's perfectly simple. There are only two kinds of people, slaves and free men. Slaves can be tortured and killed without concern. With free men a bargain has always to be struck. If there is no resistance to the Mekinese, they will despise us. We will be worse off than if we fight. Because if we fight, at least our people will be respected. They may be oppressed because they are conquered, but they won't be treated with the contempt and doubled oppression given to slaves.\"  A bearded man said querulously, \"That's theory. It's psychology. It even smacks of idealism! Let us be realistic! As a practical man, I am concerned with getting the best possible terms for our population. After all, the dictator of Mekin must be a reasonable man! He must be a practical man! I believe that we should negotiate until the very last instant.\"  Bors said indignantly, \"Negotiate? You haven't anything to negotiate with! I am not a citizen of Kandar, though I serve in its fleet. I am still a national of Tralee. But I have talked to the officers of the fleet. They won't surrender. You can't negotiate for them to do so. You can't negotiate for them to go quietly away and pretend that nothing has happened and that there never was a fleet. When the Mekinese arrive, the fleet will fight. It doesn't hope to win; it doesn't expect anything--except getting killed honorably when its enemy would like to have it grovel. But it's going to fight!\"  King Humphrey said doggedly, \"My influence does not extend to the disgrace of our fighting forces. The fleet will fight. I believe it unwise. But since it will fight I shall be in the flagship and it _will not surrender_.\"  There was a pause. The bearded man said peevishly, \"But it should fight on its own! It should not compromise Kandar!\"  There was a murmur. King Humphrey looked about him from under lowered brows.  \"That can be arranged,\" he said heavily. \"I will constitute a caretaker government by royal proclamation. I will appoint you,\" he looked steadily at the bearded man, \"to be head of it and make such terms as you can. If you like, when the Mekinese come you can warn them that the fleet has mutinied under me, its king, and may offer battle, but that you are ready to lead the people of Kandar in--\"  \"In licking the boots of all Mekinese,\" said Bors in an icy tone.  There was a small rumble of protest. Bors stood up.  \"I'd better leave,\" he said coldly. \"I'm not entitled to speak. If you want me, I can be reached.\"  He strode from the council-chamber. As the door closed behind him, he ground his teeth. The stout man, Morgan, of the space-yacht _Sylva_, paced up and down the room where he waited to be called. His daughter sat tranquilly in a chair. She smiled pleasantly at Bors when he came in. Morgan turned to face him.  \"Here's some Talents, Incorporated information,\" he said zestfully. \"The cabinet is scared. A few are willing to fight, but most are already trying to think how they can make terms with the Mekinese.\"  Bors opened his mouth to swear, then checked himself.  \"Gwenlyn,\" said Morgan, \"will pardon an expression of honest indignation. It's a dirty shame, eh?\"  \"If I were a native of Kandar,\" said Bors bitterly, \"I'd be even more ashamed than I am as a native of Tralee. The people of Tralee surrendered, but they didn't realize what they were getting into. These men do!\"  The girl Gwenlyn said quietly, \"I'm sorry for King Humphrey.\"  \"He's miscast,\" said Morgan briskly. \"He should be king of a calm and peaceful world in calm and peaceful times. You're going to have trouble with him, Captain Bors!\" Then he said; \"Perhaps we can work out a plan or two, eh? While you're waiting for the cabinet to call you back?\"  \"I've no authority,\" said Bors. \"My uncle's the Pretender of Tralee, and I was originally commissioned in the fleet as a sort of courtesy to him. I can't speak for anybody but myself.\"  \"You can speak for common sense,\" said Gwenlyn. \"After all, you know what the people really want. You could try to arrange things so that the fleet can fight well.\"  \"It'll fight well,\" said Bors curtly. \"It'll give a good account of itself! But that won't do any good!\"  Morgan struck an attitude, beaming.  \"Ah! But you've got Talents, Incorporated on your side! You don't realize yet, Captain, what a difference that can make! While there's life and Talents, Incorporated, there's hope!\"  Bors shrugged. Suddenly he found that he, too, drearily accepted defeat. There was no more hope of accomplishment. There was nothing to be achieved. He would serve no purpose by straining against the impossible.  He said tiredly, \"I'll agree that Talents, Incorporated cost the Mekinese one cruiser.\"  \"A trifle,\" said Morgan, waving his hand, \"mere soup√ßon of accomplishment. We're prepared to do vastly more.\"  It occurred to Bors to be curious.  \"Why? You're risking your life and your daughter's by staying here. If Mekin ever finds out about its cruiser on the sea bottom and your share in that affair, you'll be in a fix! And certainly you can't expect to make a profit here? We couldn't even pay you for what you've already done!\"  \"I'm right now,\" said Morgan placidly, \"quite as rich as I want to be. I've another ambition--but let's not go into that. I want to show you what Talents, Incorporated can do in the four days--\" he looked at his watch--\"three hours and some odd minutes that remain before the Mekinese fleet turns up. You've checked up on Talents, Incorporated?\"  \"My uncle says,\" Bors told him, \"that you kept Phillip of Norden from being assassinated by a fission-bomb at a cornerstone laying. He also says you wouldn't accept a reward, only a medal.\"  \"I collect them,\" said Morgan modestly. \"You'd be surprised how many orders and decorations a man can acquire by industry and organization--and Talents, Incorporated.\"  Gwenlyn said, \"Four days, three hours and some odd minutes--\"  \"True,\" said Morgan. \"Let's get at it. Captain Bors, have you ever heard of a lightning calculator--a person who can do complicated sums in his head as fast as he can hear or read the numbers involved?\"  \"Yes,\" said Bors. \"It's quite phenomenal, I believe.\"  \"It's a form of genius,\" said Morgan. \"Only I call it a talent because it tends to make itself useless. Have you ever heard of a dowser?\"  \"If you mean a man who finds places for wells, and locates mines by means of a hazel twig--\"  \"The hazel twig is immaterial,\" Morgan told him. \"The point is that you've heard of them, and you know that they can actually do such things. Right?\"  Bors frowned. \"It's not proven,\" he said. \"At least I think it isn't considered proven because it isn't understood. But I believe it's conceded that such things are done. I believe, in fact, that dowsing has been done on photographs and maps, in an office, and not on the spot at all. I admit that that seems impossible. But I'm told it happens.\"  Morgan nodded rapidly, very well pleased.  \"One more. Have you heard of precognition?\"  Bors nodded. Then he shrugged.  \"I have a Talent,\" said Morgan. \"I have a man in my employ with a talent for precognizing when ships are going to arrive. His gift is strictly limited. He used to work in a spaceport office. He always knew when a ship was coming in. He didn't know how he knew. He doesn't know now. But he always knows when a ship will arrive at the planet where he is.\"  \"Interesting,\" said Bors, only half listening.  \"He was discharged,\" Morgan went on, \"because he allowed a maintenance crew to disassemble, for repair, a vital relay in a landing-grid on the very day when three space-ships were scheduled for arrival. There was pandemonium, of course, because nothing could have landed there. So when my Talent let the relay be dismantled, with three ships expected.... But one ship was one day late, another two days, and the third, four. He knew it. He didn't know how, but he knew! He was discharged anyway.\"  Bors did not answer. The cabinet meeting in the other room went on.  \"He told me,\" said Morgan, matter-of-factly, \"that four ships would arrive on Kandar, and when. One of them has arrived. The others will come as predicted. He knows that a fleet will get here two days after the last of the four. One can guess it will be the Mekinese fleet.\"  Bors frowned. He was interested now.  \"I've another Talent,\" pursued Morgan. \"He ought to be a paranoiac. He has all the tendencies to suspicion that a paranoid personality has. But his suspicions happen to be true. He'll read an item in a newspaper or walk past, oh, say a bank. Darkly and suspiciously, he guesses that the newspaper item will suggest a crime to someone. Or that someone will attempt to rob the bank in this fashion or that, at such-and-such a time. And someone does!\"  \"He'd be an uncomfortable companion,\" Bors observed wryly.  \"I found him in jail,\" said Morgan cheerfully. \"He'd been warning the police of crimes to come. They happened. So the police jailed him and demanded that he name his accomplices so they could break up the criminal gang whose feats he knew in advance. I got him out of jail and hired him as a Talent in Talents, Incorporated.\"  Bors blinked.  \"Before we landed here,\" said Morgan, \"I'd told him"]]]
