I won't be the camp coward--I won't, won't, _won't_!\" she cried aloud, and turning, went on again swiftly with her head lifted. A bit of colour drifted back to her white cheeks, and her heart stopped its heavy thumping as she drew a long deep breath. She would not let herself think of Slabtown. She counted the trees she passed, named the birds that wheeled and circled about her, even repeated the multiplication table--anything to keep Slabtown out of her thoughts; but all the while the black dread of it was there in the back of her mind. When she caught sight of the sawmill where the Slabtown men earned their bread, her feet began to drag again.  \"I can't--O, I can't!\" she sobbed out, two big tears rolling down her cheeks. Then across her mind flashed a vision of the little cottontail streaking madly across the road before her, and again some strange new power within urged her on. She went on slowly, reluctantly, with dragging feet, but still she went on. There were no men about the place at this hour--they were at work--but untidy women sat on their doorsteps or rocked at the windows, and a horde of ragged barefooted children catching sight of the girl swarmed out into the road to stare at her. Some begged for pennies, and getting none, yelled after her and threw stones till she took to her heels and ran \"just like the other bunny!\" she told herself in miserable scorn, when once she was safely past the settlement. Well, there was no other such place to pass, but--she shivered as she remembered that she must pass this one again on the way back.  She went on swiftly now with only occasionally a fearful glance on either side when the road cut through the woods. Once a farmer going by offered her a ride; but she shook her head and plodded on. It was half-past eleven when, with a great throb of relief and joy, she came in sight of the Corners. A few minutes more and she was in the village street with its homey-looking white houses and flower gardens. She longed to stop and rest on one of the vine-shaded porches, but she was too shy to ask permission. At the store she did stop, and rested a few minutes in one of the battered wooden chairs on the little porch, but it was sunny and hot there. Now for the first time she thought of lunch, but she had not a penny with her; she must go hungry until she got back to camp. A boy came up the steps munching a red apple, his pockets bulging with others. The storekeeper's little girl ran out on the porch with a big molasses cooky just out of the oven, and the warm spicy odour of it made Myra realise how hungry she was. She looked so longingly at the cooky that the child, seeming to read her thoughts, crowded it all hastily into her own mouth. Myra laughed a bit at that, and after a little rest, set off on her return. She was tired and hungry, but a strange new joy was throbbing at her heart. She had come all the way to Kent's Corners alone--they _could not call her a coward now_! That thought more than balanced her weariness and hunger. She had to walk all the way back--she had to pass Slabtown again. Yes, but now she was not afraid--_not afraid_! She drew herself up to her slender height, threw back her head, and laughed aloud in the joy of her deliverance from the fear that had held her in bondage all her life. She didn't understand in the least how it had happened, but she knew that at last she was free--_free_--like the other girls whom she had envied; and dimly she began to realise that this was a big thing--something that would make all her life different. She walked as if she were treading on air. The loneliness of the woods, of the long stretch of empty road, no longer filled her with trembling terror.  As for the second time she approached Slabtown, her heart began to beat a little faster, but the newborn courage did not fail her now. She found herself whistling a gay tune and laughed. Whistling to keep her courage up? Was that what she was doing? Never mind--the courage _was_ up. The women still sat on their doorsteps or stared from their windows, but this time the children did not swarm around her. They stood by the roadside and stared, but none called after her or followed her. She did not realise how great was the difference between the girl who now walked by with shining eyes and lifted head, and the white-faced trembling little creature with terror writ large in every line of her face and figure that had scurried by earlier in the day. But the children realised it. Instinctively now they knew her unafraid, and they did not venture to badger her. She even smiled and waved her hand to them as she went by, and at that a youngster of a dozen years suddenly broke out, \"Three cheers fer the girl--now, fellers!\" And with the echo of the shrill response ringing in her ears, Myra passed on, proud and happy as never before in her life.  All the rest of the way she went with the new happy consciousness making music in her heart--the consciousness of victory won. The last mile or two her feet dragged, but it was from weariness and lack of food. As she drew near the camp her steps quickened, her head went up again, and her eyes began to shine; but when she came to the white tents, she stood looking about in blank amazement. There was not a girl anywhere in sight; even the cook was missing.  Myra stood for a moment wondering where they had all gone; then she walked slowly across the camp to a hammock swung behind a clump of low-growing pines. Dropping into the hammock, she tucked a cushion under her head and, with a long sigh of delicious content and restfulness her eyes closed and in two minutes she was sound asleep--so sound asleep that when, an hour later, the girls came straggling back with pails and baskets full of big luscious berries, the gay cries and laughter and chatter of many voices did not arouse her.  The girls trooped over to the kitchen and delivered up their spoil to the cook.  \"Now, Katie,\" cried one, \"you must make us some blueberry flapjacks for supper--lots and lots of 'em, too!\"  \"And blueberry gingerbread,\" added another.  \"And pies--fat juicy pies,\" called a third.  \"_And_ rolypoly--blueberry rolypoly!\" shouted yet another.  The cook, her arms on her hips, stood laughing into the sun-browned young faces before her.  \"Sure ye're not askin' me to make all them things fer ye _to-night_!\" she protested gaily.  \"We-ell, not all maybe. We can wait till to-morrow for some of them. But heaps and heaps of flapjacks, Katie dear, if you love us, and you know you do,\" coaxed Louise Johnson.  \"Love ye? _Love_ ye, did ye say?\" laughed the cook. \"Be off wid ye now an' lave me in pace or ye'll not get a smirch of a flapjack to yer supper. Shoo!\" and she waved them off with her apron.  As the laughing girls turned away from the kitchen, Mary Hastings came towards them from the other side of the camp.  \"What's the matter, Molly? You look as sober as an owl!\" cried Louise who never looked sober.  \"It's Myra--she isn't here. Miss Grandis and I have hunted all over the camp for her,\" Mary answered. \"You know she started for Kent's Corners before we went berrying.\"  \"So she did,\" cried another girl, the merriment dying out of her eyes. \"You don't suppose she really went there?\"  \"Myra Karr--alone--to Kent's Corners? Never in the world,\" Louise flung out carelessly. \"She's somewhere about. Let's call her.\" She lifted her voice and called aloud, \"Myra, Myra, My-raa!\"  At the call Mrs. Royall came hastily towards them. \"Where is Myra? Didn't she go berrying with us?\" she inquired.  \"No,\" Louise explained lightly. \"Bunny got her back up this morning and said she was going alone to Kent's Corners, but of course she didn't. She's started that stunt half a dozen times and always backed out. She's just around somewhere.\"  But Mrs. Royall still looked troubled. \"She must be found,\" she said with quick decision. \"Get the megaphone, Louise, and call her with that.\"  Still laughing, Louise obeyed. Her clear voice carried well, and many keen young ears were strained for the response that did not come. In the silence that followed a second call, Mrs. Royall spoke to another girl.  \"Edith, get your bugle and sound the recall. If that does not bring her, two of you must hurry over to the farm and harness Billy into the buggy; and I will drive to Kent's Corners at once.\"  The girls were no longer laughing. \"You don't think anything could have happened to Myra, Mrs. Royall?\" one of them questioned anxiously. \"Almost all of us have walked over there. I went alone and so did Mary.\"  \"I know, but Myra is such a timid little thing. She cannot do what most of you can.\"  Edith Rue came running back with her bugle, and in a moment the notes of the recall floated out on the still summer air. It was a rigid rule of the camp that the recall should be promptly answered by any girl within hearing, so when, in the silence that followed, no response was heard, Mrs. Royall sent the two girls for the horse and buggy.  \"Have them here as quickly as possible,\" she called after them.  Before the messengers were out of sight, however, there was an outcry behind them.  \"Why, there she is! There's Myra now!\" and every face turned towards the small figure coming from the clump of evergreens, her eyes still half-dazed with sleep.  With an exclamation of relief, Mrs. Royall hurried to meet her.  \"Where were you, child? Didn't you hear us calling you?\" she asked.  \"I--I--no. I heard the recall, and I came--I guess I was asleep,\" stammered Myra bewildered by something tense in the atmosphere, and the eyes all centred on her.  \"Asleep!\" echoed Louise Johnson with a chuckle. \"What did I tell you, girls?\"  But Mrs. Royall saw that Myra looked pale and tired, and she noticed the change that came over her face as Louise spoke. A quick wave of colour swept the pale cheeks and the small head was lifted with an air that was new and strange--in Myra Karr. Mrs."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23987"],["title","The Torch Bearer: A Camp Fire Girls' Story (#5)"],["body","spoke again, laying her hand gently on the girl's shoulder.  \"Myra, how long have you been asleep? How long have you been back in camp?\"  And Myra answered quietly, but with that new pride in her voice, \"It was quarter of four by the kitchen clock when I came. There was nobody here--not even Katie----\"  \"I'd just run out a bit to see if anny of ye was comin',\" put in the cook from the kitchen door where she stood, as much interested as any one else in what was going on.  \"And did you go to Kent's Corners, my dear?\" Mrs. Royall questioned gently.  It was Myra's hour of triumph. She forgot Louise Johnson's mocking laugh--forgot everything but her beautiful new freedom.  \"O, I did--I did, Mrs. Royall!\" she cried out. \"I was awfully frightened at first, but coming home I wasn't _one bit afraid_, and, please, you won't let them call me Bunny any more, will you?\"  \"No, my child, no. You've won a new name and you shall have it at the next Council Fire. I'm so glad, Myra!\" Mrs. Royall's face was almost as radiant as the girl's.  It was Louise Johnson who called out, \"Three cheers for Myra Karr! She's a _trump_!\"  The cheers were given with a will. Tears filled Myra's eyes, but they were happy tears, as the girls crowded around her with questions and exclamations, and Miss Grandis stood with a hand on her shoulder.  \"That's what Camp Fire has done for one girl,\" Mrs. Royall said in a low tone to Laura Haven. \"That child was afraid of the dark, afraid of the water, afraid to be alone a minute, when she came. It is a great triumph for her--a great victory.\"  \"Yes,\" returned Laura thoughtfully, and Anne added,  \"You've no idea how lonesome the camp looked when Laura and I came back and found you all gone. It was so still it seemed almost uncanny. Myra never would have dared to stay alone here before.\"     IV  THE POOR THING   A week later Miss Grandis was called home by illness in her family, and she asked Laura to drive to the station with her.  \"I wanted the chance to talk with you,\" she explained, as they drove along the quiet country road. \"You know I should not have been able to stay here much longer anyhow, and now I shall not come back, and I want you to take charge of my girls. Will you?\"  \"O, I can't yet--I haven't had half enough training,\" Laura protested.  \"I know, but you've put so much into the time you have had in camp, and I know that Mrs. Royall will be glad to have you in my place. You can keep on with your training just the same. I want to tell you about the girls.\" She told something of the environment of each one--enough to help Laura to understand their needs. \"And there's Elizabeth Page, who is coming to-morrow,\" she went on. \"I always think of her as the Poor Thing. O, I do so hope the Camp Fire will do a great deal for her--she's had so pitifully little in her life thus far. Her mother died when she was a baby, and she has been just a drudge for her stepmother and the younger children, and she's not strong enough for such hard work. She's never had anything for herself. The camp will seem like paradise to her if she can only get in touch with things--I'm sure it will.\"  \"I'll do my best for her,\" Laura promised.  \"I know you will. And you'll meet her when she comes, to-morrow?\"  \"Of course,\" Laura returned.  There was no time to spare when they reached the station, but Miss Grandis' last word was of Elizabeth and her great need.  Laura was at the station early the next day, and would have recognised the Poor Thing even if she had not been the only girl leaving the train at that place. Elizabeth was seventeen, but she might have been taken for fourteen until one looked into her eyes--they seemed to mirror the pain and privation of half a century. Laura's heart went out to her in a wave of pitying tenderness, but the girl drew back as if frightened by the warm friendliness of her greeting.  All the way back to camp she sat silent, answering a direct question with a nod or shake of the head, but never speaking; and when, at the camp, a crowd of girls came to meet the newcomer, she looked wildly around as if for refuge from all these strangers. Seeing this, Laura, with a whispered word, sent the girls away, and introduced Elizabeth only to Mrs. Royall and Anne Wentworth.  \"Another scared rabbit?\" giggled Louise Johnson.  \"Don't call her that, Louise,\" said Bessie Carroll. \"I'm awfully sorry for the poor thing.\"  Laura, overhearing the low-spoken words, said to herself, \"There it is--Poor Thing. That name is bound to cling to her, it fits so exactly.\"  It did fit exactly, and within two days Elizabeth was the Poor Thing to every girl in the camp. Laura kept the child with her most of the first day; she was quiet and still as a ghost, did as she was told, and watched all that went on, but she spoke to no one and never asked a question. At night she was given a cot next to Olga's. When Laura showed her her place at bedtime, she pointed to the adjoining tent.  \"I sleep right there, Elizabeth,\" she said, \"and if you want anything in the night, just speak, and I shall hear you. But I hope you will sleep so soundly that you won't know anything till morning. It's lovely sleeping out of doors like this!\"  Elizabeth said nothing, but she shivered as she cast a fearful glance into the shadowy spaces beyond the tents, and Laura hastened to add, \"You needn't be a bit afraid. Nothing but birds and squirrels ever come around here.\"  Elizabeth went early to bed, and was apparently sound asleep when the other girls went to their cots. But after all was still and the camp lights out, she lay trembling, and staring wide-eyed into the darkness. A thousand strange small sounds beat on her strained ears, and when suddenly the hoot of an owl rang out from a nearby treetop, Elizabeth sprang up with a frightened cry and clutched wildly at the girl in the nearest cot.  Olga's cold voice answered her cry. \"It's nothing but an owl, you goose! Go back to your bed!\"  But Elizabeth was on her knees, clinging desperately to Olga's hand.  \"O, I'm afraid, I'm afraid!\" she moaned. \"Please _please_ let me stay here with you. I never was in a p-place like this before.\"  Olga jerked her hand away from the clinging fingers. \"Get back to your bed!\" she ordered under her breath. \"Anybody'd think you were a _baby_.\"  \"I don't care _what_ anybody'd think if you'll only let me stay. I--I must touch s-somebody,\" wailed the Poor Thing in a choked voice.  \"Well, it won't be me you'll touch,\" retorted Olga. \"And if you don't keep still I'll report you in the morning. You'll have every girl in the camp awake presently.\"  \"O, I don't care,\" sobbed Elizabeth under her breath. \"I--I want to go home. I'd rather die than stay here!\"  \"Well, die if you like, but leave the rest of us to sleep in peace,\" muttered Olga, and turning her face away from the wretched little creature crouching at her side, she went calmly to sleep.  When she awoke she gave a casual glance at the next cot. It was empty, but on the floor was a small huddled figure, one hand still clutching Olga's blanket. Olga started to yank the blanket away, but the look of suffering in the white face stayed her impatient hand. She touched the thin shoulder of Elizabeth, and for once her touch was almost gentle. Elizabeth opened her eyes with a start as Olga whispered, \"Get back to your bed. There's an hour before rising time.\"  Elizabeth crawled slowly back to her own cot, but she did not sleep again. Neither did Olga, and she was uncomfortably aware that a pair of timid blue eyes were on her face until she turned her back on them.  At ten o'clock that morning the girls all trooped down to the water. Some in full knickerbockers and middy blouses were going to row or paddle, but most wore bathing suits. With some difficulty Laura persuaded Elizabeth to put on a bathing suit that Miss Grandis had left for her, but no urging or coaxing could induce her to go into the water even to wade, though other girls were swimming and splashing and frolicking like mermaids. Elizabeth sat on the sand, her eyes following Olga's dark head as the girl swept through the water like a fish--swimming, floating, diving--she seemed as much at home in the water as on land.  \"You can do all those things too, Elizabeth, if you will,\" Laura told her. \"Look at Myra, there--she has always been afraid to try to swim, but she's learning to-day, and see how she is enjoying it.\"  Elizabeth drew further into her shell of silence. She cast a fleeting glance at Myra Karr, nervously trying to obey Mary Hastings' directions and \"act like a frog\"--then her eyes searched again for Olga, now far out in the bay.  When she could not distinguish the dark head, anxiety at last conquered her timidity, and she turned to Laura:  \"O, is she drowned?\" she cried under her breath. \"Olga--is she?\"  Anne Wentworth laughed out at the question. \"Why, Elizabeth,\" she said, leaning towards her, \"Olga's a perfect fish in the water. She's the best swimmer in camp. Look--there she comes now.\"  She came swimming on her side, one strong brown arm cutting swiftly and steadily through the water. When presently she walked up on the beach, a pale smile glimmered over Elizabeth's face, but it vanished at Olga's glance as she passed with the scornful fling--\"Haven't even wet your feet--_baby_!\"  Elizabeth's face flushed and she drew her bare feet under her.  \"Never mind, you'll wet them to-morrow, won't you, Elizabeth?\" Laura said; but the Poor Thing made no reply; she only gulped down a sob as she looked after the straight young figure in the dripping bathing suit marching down the beach.  \"She notices no one but Olga,\" Laura said as she walked back to camp with her friend. \"If Olga would only take an interest in _her_!\"  \"If only she would!\" Anne agreed. \"But she seems to have no more feeling than a fish!\"  Many of the girls did their best to draw the Poor Thing out of her shell of scared silence, but they all failed. And Olga would do nothing. Yet"]]]
