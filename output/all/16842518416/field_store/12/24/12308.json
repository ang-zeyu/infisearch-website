I'm always thinking about old times.\" Mr. Rabbit sighed as he said this.  \"Oh, please tell us the story,\" pleaded Sweetest Susan, anxious to make friends with Mr. Rabbit.  He shook his head. \"Mrs. Meadows can tell it better than I can.\"  \"Dinner!\" cried Mr. Thimblefinger. \"What about dinner?\"  \"Dinner'll be ready directly,\" replied Mrs. Meadows.  \"But the story?\" Sweetest Susan said.   THE STRONGEST--WHO? OR WHICH?  \"Well,\" replied Mrs. Meadows, \"it was like this: One time in the country where we came from--the country where you live now--there chanced to be a big frost, and the mill-pond froze over. Mr. Rabbit ran along that way and found that the pond had this bridge across it.\"  \"Was it this Mr. Rabbit here?\" asked Buster John.  Mrs. Meadows folded her hands in her lap and looked at them. \"Well,\" she said, \"I never talk about folks behind their backs. You must do your own guessing. Anyway, Mr. Rabbit found the ice bridge over the pond, and as he was in something of a hurry he skipped across it. I mean he skipped a part of the way. The Ice was so slippery that when he got about halfway, his feet slipped from under him and he fell kerthump! He got up and rubbed himself as well as he could, and then he thought that the Ice must be very strong to hit him so hard a lick. He said to the Ice, 'You are very strong.'  \"'I am so,' replied the Ice.  \"'Well, if you are so strong, how can the Sun melt you?'  \"The Ice said nothing, and so Mr. Rabbit asked the Sun, 'Are you very strong?'  \"'So they tell me,' replied the Sun.  \"'Then how can the Clouds hide you?'  \"The Sun was somewhat ashamed and had nothing to say. So Mr. Rabbit looked at the Clouds.  \"'Are you very strong?'  \"'We have heard so,' replied the Clouds.  \"'How can the Wind blow you?'  \"The Clouds sailed away, and Mr. Rabbit asked the Wind, 'Are you very strong?'  \"'I believe you,' said the Wind.  \"'Then how can the Mountain stand against you?'  \"The Wind blew itself away, and then Mr. Rabbit asked the Mountain, 'Are you very strong?'  \"'So it seems,' replied the Mountain.  \"'How can the Mouse make a nest in you?'  \"The Mountain was mum. So Mr. Rabbit asked the Mouse, 'Are you very strong?'  \"'I believe so,' replied the Mouse.  \"'How can the Cat catch you?'  \"The Mouse hid in the grass. Mr. Rabbit asked the Cat, 'Are you very strong?'  \"'Yes, indeed,' replied the Cat.  \"'How can the Dog chase you?'  \"The Cat began to wash her face. Then Mr. Rabbit said to the Dog, 'Are you very strong?'  \"'I certainly am,' replied the Dog.  \"'Then why does the Stick scare you?'  \"The Dog began to scratch the fleas off his neck, and Mr. Rabbit said to the Stick, 'Are you very strong?'  \"'Everybody says so.'  \"'Then how can the Fire burn you?'  \"The Stick was dumb, and Mr. Rabbit asked the Fire, 'Are you very strong?'  \"'Anybody will tell you so,' the Fire answered.  \"'How can the Water quench you?'  \"The Fire hid behind the smoke. Then Mr. Rabbit asked the Water, 'Are you very strong?'  \"'Strong is no name for it,' said the Water.  \"'How can the Ice cover you?'  \"The Water went running down the river, and after it had gone the Ice said to Mr. Rabbit, 'You see you had to come back to me at last.'  \"'Yes,' replied Mr. Rabbit, 'and now I am going away. You are too much for me.' Then Mr. Rabbit loped off, rubbing his bruises.\"  \"Was it really you, Mr. Rabbit?\" asked Sweetest Susan.  Mr. Rabbit rubbed his mustache with the end of his pipe-stem. \"Well, I'll tell you the truth. I was mighty foolish in my young days. But now all I want to do is to eat breakfast, and then wait until dinner is ready, and then sit and wait until supper is put on the table.\"  Mrs. Meadows winked at the children and then turned to Mr. Rabbit.  \"Now,\" said she, \"I've told the story you ought to have told, for you know more about it than anybody else. It's as little as you can do to sing the old song that you sung when you used to go frolicking.\"  \"Why, it's about myself!\" exclaimed Mr. Rabbit. \"At my time of life it would never do.\"  \"Please make him sing it,\" said Sweetest Susan, who was much given to getting her own way by the pretty little art of coaxing.  \"Oh, he'll sing it,\" replied Mrs. Meadows confidently. \"He can't refuse.\"  Mr. Rabbit shook his head, and then seemed to fall into a brown study, but suddenly, seeing that they were all waiting for the song, he cleared up his throat, and after several false starts sang this song:--   OH, THIS IS MR. RABBIT!      Oh, this is Mr. Rabbit, that runs on the grass,     So rise up, ladies, and let him pass;     He courted Miss Meadows, when her ma was away,     He crossed his legs, and said his say.     He crossed his legs, and he winked his eye,     And then he told Miss Meadows good-by.             So it's good-by, ducky,               And it's good-by, dear!             I'll never come to see you               Until next year!     For this is Mr. Rabbit, that runs on the grass,     So rise up, ladies, and let him pass.      And he cried from the gate, so bold and free:     \"I know you are glad to get rid of me.\"     And then Miss Meadows shook her head--     \"If you stay too long you'll find me dead.             And it's good-by, ducky,               And it's good-by, dear!             You'll find me dead               When you come next year!\"     For this is Mr. Rabbit, that runs on the grass,     So rise up, ladies, and let him pass.      Mr. Owl called out from the top of the tree,     \"Oh, who? Oh, who?\" and \"He-he-he!\"     Mr. Fox slipped off in the woods and cried;     Mr. Coon's broken heart caused a pain in his side.             For it's good-by, ducky,               And it's good-by, dear!             If you ever come to see me,               Come before next year!     For this is Mr. Rabbit, that runs on the grass,     So rise up, ladies, and let him pass.      Mr. Rabbit looked around, and saw all the trouble,     And he laughed and he laughed till he bent over double.     He shook his head, and said his say--     \"I'll come a-calling when to-morrow is to-day.             For when you have a ducky,               Don't stay--don't stay--             Go off and come again               When to-morrow is to-day.\"     For this is Mr. Rabbit, that runs on the grass,     So rise up, ladies, and let him pass.     IV.  TWO QUEER STORIES.   There is no doubt the children were very much surprised to see Mr. Rabbit. They were astonished to find that he was so large and solemn-looking. When the negroes on the plantation told them about Mr. Rabbit--or Brother Rabbit, as he was sometimes called--they had imagined that he was no larger than the rabbits they saw in the sedge-field or in the barley-patch, but this Mr. Rabbit was larger than a dozen of them put together.  In one way or another Sweetest Susan and Buster John and Drusilla showed their amazement very plainly--especially Drusilla, who took no pains to conceal hers. Every time Mr. Rabbit moved she would nudge Sweetest Susan or Buster John and exclaim: \"Look at dat!\" or, \"We better be gwine!\" or, \"Spozen Brer Fox er Brer Wolf come up an' dey er dat big!\"  Mrs. Meadows noticed this; indeed, she could not help noticing it. And so she said:--  \"I reckon maybe you expected to find Mr. Rabbit no bigger than the rest of his family that live in your country.\"  Before the children could make any answer, Mr. Rabbit began to chuckle, and he chuckled so heartily that Sweetest Susan was afraid he would choke.  \"I don't wonder you laugh,\" said Mrs. Meadows, elevating her voice a little, as if Mr. Rabbit were a little deaf.  \"It may not be polite to laugh in company,\" replied Mr. Rabbit, \"but I am obliged to do it.\" His voice was wheezy, and he nodded his head vigorously. \"Yes, I am obliged to do it. Why, I could put one of those poor creatures in my coat-pocket. They are not Rabbits. They are Runts. Yes, Runts. That's what they are. And to think, too, that their great-grandparents might have come here when I did. But, no! They wouldn't hear to it. No new country for them, they said. And so they stayed where they were, and the breed has dwindled down to--to nothing. I'll be bound they have forgotten how to talk.\" He turned to the children with a look of inquiry.  \"Why, of course, rabbits can't talk,\" said Buster John.  Mr. Rabbit shook his head sadly and put his hand to his eyes. \"Well, well, well!\" he exclaimed after a while. \"Can't talk! But I might have known it. The family's gone to seed. I'm glad I'm not there to see it all. A neighbor here and there does no harm, but when people began to crowd in I concluded to move, and I'm glad I did. I'm old and getting feeble, but, thank gracious, I'm not a Runt.\"  \"I don't see but you're as nimble as ever you were,\" remarked Mrs. Meadows soothingly.  \"I know--I know!\" Mr. Rabbit insisted; \"I may be as nimble, but I'm not as keen for a frolic as I used to be. The chimney-corner suits me better than a barbecue.\" Mr. Rabbit closed his big eyes and sighed. \"Well, well--everybody to his time, everybody to his taste!\"  Mrs. Meadows nodded her head approvingly. \"Yes; between first one thing and then another, there's lots of time and a heap of tastes.\"  \"They tell me,\" remarked Mr. Rabbit suddenly, \"that things have got to that pass in the country we came from that even Mr. Billy-Goat, who used to eat meat, has dwindled away in mind and body till he hangs around the stable doors and eats straw for a living. That's what Mr. Thimblefinger says, and he ought to know. I suppose Billy is still bob-tailed? I remember the very day he had his tail broken off.\"  \"Tell us about it,\" remarked Buster John.   WHY MR. BILLY-GOAT'S TAIL IS SHORT.  \"Oh, it doesn't amount to much,\" said he. \"It's hardly worth talking about. I think it was one Saturday. In those days, you know, we used to have a half-holiday every Saturday. We worked hard all the week, and we tried to crowd as much fun into a half-holiday as possible. Well,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23869"],["title","Little Mr. Thimblefinger and His Queer Country (#5)"],["body"," Saturday afternoon Mr. Billy-Goat and Mr. Dog were walking arm in arm along the road, talking and laughing in a sociable way, when all of a sudden a big rain came up. Mr. Billy-Goat said he was mighty sorry he left his parasol at home, because the rain was apt to make his horns rust. Mr. Dog shook himself and said he didn't mind water, because when he got wet the fleas quit biting.  \"But Mr. Billy-Goat hurried on and Mr. Dog kept up with him until they came to Mr. Wolf's house, and they ran into the front porch for shelter. The door was shut tight, but Mr. Billy-Goat had on his high-heel shoes that day, and he made so much noise as he tramped about that Mr. Wolf opened his window and looked out. When he saw who it was, he cried out:--  \"'Hallo! this is not a nice day to pay visits, but since you are here, you may as well come in out of the wet.'  \"But Mr. Dog shook his head and flirted up dirt by scratching on the ground with his feet. He had smelled blood. Mr. Billy-Goat saw how Mr. Dog acted, and he was afraid to go in. So he shook his horns.  \"'You'd just as well come in and sit by the fire,' said Mr. Wolf, unlatching the door.  \"But Mr. Dog and Mr. Billy-Goat thanked him kindly, and said they didn't want to carry mud into the house. They said they would just stand in the porch till the shower passed over. Then Mr. Wolf took down his fiddle, tuned it up, and began to play. In his day and time few could beat him playing the fiddle. And this time he played his level best, for he knew that if he could start Mr. Billy-Goat to dancing he'd have him for dinner.\"  \"I don't see how,\" said Buster John.  \"Well,\" exclaimed Mr. Rabbit, \"if Mr. Billy-Goat began to dance he would be likely to dance until he got tired, and then it would be an easy matter for Mr. Wolf to outrun him.\"  \"Of course,\" said Sweetest Susan.  \"Well,\" Mr. Rabbit continued, \"Mr. Wolf kept on playing the fiddle, but Mr. Billy-Goat didn't dance. Not only that, he kept so near the edge of the porch that the rain drifted in on his horns and ran down his long beard. But he kept his eye on Mr. Wolf. After playing the fiddle till he was tired, Mr. Wolf asked:--  \"'How do you get your meat, my young friends?'  \"Mr. Dog said he depended on his teeth, and Mr. Billy-Goat, thinking to be on the safe side, said he also depended upon his teeth.  \"'As for me,' cried Mr. Wolf, 'I depend on my feet!' and with that he dropped his fiddle and jumped at Mr. Billy-Goat. But he knocked the broom down and the handle tripped him. It was all very sudden, but by the time Mr. Wolf had recovered himself Mr. Billy-Goat and Mr. Dog had gone a considerable distance.  [Illustration: MR. BILLY-GOAT AND MR. WOLF]  \"They ran and ran until they came to a big creek. Mr. Billy-Goat asked Mr. Dog how he was going to get across.  \"'Swim,' said Mr. Dog.  \"'Then I'll have to bid you good-by,' replied Mr. Billy-Goat, 'for I can't swim a stroke.'  \"By this time they had arrived at the bank of the creek, and they could hear Mr. Wolf coming through the woods. They had no time to lose. Mr. Dog looked around on the ground, gathered some jan-weed, yan-weed, and tan-weed, rubbed them together, and squeezed a drop of the juice on Mr. Billy-Goat's horns. He had no sooner done this than Mr. Billy-Goat was changed into a white rock.  \"Then Mr. Dog leaped into the creek and swam across. Mr. Wolf ran to the bank, but there he stopped. The water was so wide it made tears come in his eyes; so deep that it made his legs ache; and so cold that it made his body shiver.  \"When Mr. Dog arrived safely on the other side he cried out, 'Aha! you are afraid! You've drowned poor Mr. Billy-Goat, but you are afraid of me. I dare you to fling a rock at me!'  \"This made Mr. Wolf so mad that he seized the white rock and threw it at Mr. Dog with all his might. It fell near Mr. Dog, and instantly became Mr. Billy-Goat again. But in falling a piece was broken off, and it happened to be Mr. Billy-Goat's tail. Ever since then he has had a very short tail.\"  \"Were you there, Mr. Rabbit?\" asked Sweetest Susan bluntly.  \"I was fishing at the time,\" replied Mr. Rabbit. \"I heard the noise they made, and I turned around and saw it just as I've told you.\"  Drusilla touched Buster John on the arm. \"We ain't dreamin', is we, honey?\"  Buster John looked at her scornfully. \"What put that in your head?\" he asked.  \"Suppose the rock had hit Mr. Dog?\" suggested Sweetest Susan.   THE PUMPKIN-EATER.  \"Now, that's so!\" exclaimed Mr. Thimblefinger. \"And it reminds me of a little accident that happened in my mother's family. But it's hardly worth telling.\"  \"Well, tell it, anyhow,\" said Mrs. Meadows.  \"Yes,\" remarked Mr. Rabbit, \"the proof of the pudding is in chewing the bag.\"  \"Well,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger, \"as far back as I can remember, and before that, too, my mother was a widow, and she had a great many children to take care of. The reason she had so many children was because she was poor. I have noticed all my life that when people are very poor they happen to have more children than they know what to do with. This was the way with my mother. She had a houseful of children, and she found it a hard matter to get along.  \"One day she went down to the creek to wash the clothes, such as she and the children had, and when she got there she found an old man sitting on the bank. He said, 'Howdy,' and she said, 'Good-morning,' and then he asked her if she would be so good as to wash his coat and his waistcoat. She said she would be glad to do so, and the old man said he would be very much obliged. So my mother washed the coat and waistcoat. Then he asked her if she would comb his hair for him, and she did so.  \"The old man thanked her kindly, and took from his pocket a string of red beads and made her a present of them. Then he told her to go out behind the house when she got home, and there she'd find a pumpkin-tree growing. He said that she must bury the string of beads at the foot of the tree.  \"'That's a pity,' exclaimed my mother; 'they are so beautiful.'  \"But the old man declared that she must do as he said, and after that she was to go to the pumpkin-tree every day and ask for as many pumpkins as she wanted.  \"My mother went home and found the pumpkin-tree where never a tree had been growing before, and at its roots she buried the string of beads. Next morning, bright and early, she went to the pumpkin-tree and called for one pumpkin. Down it dropped from the tree. For a long time my mother and her children were happy and growing fat. Every day a big pumpkin would be cooked, and as my mother had to leave us so as to attend to her work, enough pumpkin would be left in the pot to last us all day.  [Illustration: MY MOTHER WASHING THE OLD MAN'S COAT AND WAISTCOAT]  \"I remember that time very well,\" Mr. Thimblefinger continued, with a sigh, \"for I was getting fat and growing to be almost as large as the rest of the children. But one day, as my mother was going out to work she found a hamper basket on the gate-post, and in that basket was a baby. So she carried the baby in the house, gave it something to eat, and then put it on the floor to play with the rest. But as soon as she got out of the yard the baby crawled to the pot where the cooked pumpkin was, and ate and ate until there was no pumpkin left. Of course, the rest of the children had to go hungry. And when my mother came home she had to go hungry, too.  \"She was very much surprised. She found all the pumpkin gone and the children crying for something to eat, and the stray baby was crying louder than any. She said we were the greediest children she had ever seen.  \"The next day she cooked two pumpkins, but the same thing happened. The baby went to the pot and ate both. The children told her how it happened, but she wouldn't believe them. She said she couldn't be made to believe that one puny little baby could eat two whole pumpkins--and it _is_ very queer, when you come to think about it.  \"The next day she cooked three pumpkins, but the same thing happened. Then four, then five, then six. But it was always the same. No matter how many pumpkins were cooked, the stray baby would eat them all, and the rest of the children would have to go hungry. You see how small I am,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger, suddenly pausing in the thread of his story. \"Well, the reason of it is that I was starved out by that pumpkin-eating baby. My brothers and sisters and myself were just as large and as healthy as any other children until that baby was found on the gate-post, and from that day we began to dwindle and shrink away.  \"Well, we starved and starved until at last my mother could very plainly see that something was the matter. So she set a trap for the baby and baited it with pumpkins. She hadn't got out of hearing before the baby put his head in the pot and got caught in the trap. It stayed there all day, and when mother came home at night she found it there. She was very much surprised, but she saw she must get rid of the baby. She said that any creature that could manage to eat like that was able to take care of itself, and so she carried it off down the road and left it there.  \"Now this Pumpkin-Eater was a witch baby, and as soon as it thought my mother was out of sight and hearing it changed itself into a tall, heavy man.\"  \"'T wuz feedin' de big man all de time,\" exclaimed Drusilla.  \"Certainly,\" replied Mr. Thimblefinger. \"My mother was watching it, and she followed to see where it would go. It went down to the bank of the river. There it found the old man who had given my mother the string of beads, and asked him for something to eat.  \"'Comb my hair for me,' said the old man.  \"But it refused, and then the old man told it to go to the pumpkin-tree and ask for twenty pumpkins. The greedy thing was glad to do this. It went to the tree and called for twenty pumpkins, and down they fell on its head.\"  \"What then?\" asked Buster John, as Mr. Thimblefinger paused. \"Was it hurt?\"  \"Smashed!\""]]]
