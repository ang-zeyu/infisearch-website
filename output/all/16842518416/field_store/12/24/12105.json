So he divided the people that were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two parts and said, \"If Esau comes to the one and attacks and destroys it, then the other which is left can escape.\"  Jacob also prayed, \"O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear that he will come and attack me and kill the mothers and the children.\"  Then Jacob took as a present for his brother Esau, two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, thirty milch camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female asses and ten young asses. These he put, each drove by itself, in the care of his servants and said to them, \"Go on before me and leave a space between the droves.\"  He gave those in front this command: \"When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, 'To whom do you belong? and where are you going? and whose are these before you?' then you shall say, 'To your servant Jacob; it is a present sent by him to my lord Esau; and Jacob himself is just behind us.'\" Jacob also commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, to make the same answer, and to say, \"Jacob himself is just behind us.\" For he said to himself, \"I will please him with the present that goes before me, and then, when I meet him, perhaps he will welcome me.\" So he sent the present over before him; but he himself spent that night in the camp.  Later that night he rose up and took his two wives, his two maid servants, and his eleven children, and sent them over the river Jabbok.  Jacob was left alone, and one wrestled with him until daybreak. When he saw that he did not win against Jacob, he struck the socket of his hip, and the socket of Jacob's hip was strained, as he wrestled with him. Then he said, \"Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.\" But Jacob replied, \"I will not let thee go unless you bless me.\" So he said to him, \"What is your name?\" He answered, \"Jacob.\" Then he said, \"Your name shall be no longer Jacob, but Israel, which means Struggler with God; for you have struggled with God and with men and have won.\" So he blessed him there. And Jacob called the place Penuel, which means Face of God, for he said, \"I have seen God face to face, and my life has been saved.\"  When Jacob looked up, he saw Esau coming with four hundred men. And he put the maid servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and her son Joseph in the rear. Then Jacob himself went in front of them, and he bowed down to the ground seven times, as he drew near to his brother. Esau ran to meet him, threw his arms about his neck, and kissed him, and they wept.  When Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, he said, \"Who are these with you?\" Jacob answered, \"The children whom God has so kindly given me.\" Then the maid servants with their children came up and bowed down to the ground. Leah and her children also came and bowed down, and afterward Joseph and Rachel came up and bowed down before Esau.  Esau asked, \"What do you mean by all this company which I met?\" Jacob answered, \"To win your friendship, my lord.\" Esau said, \"I have enough, my brother; keep what you have.\" But Jacob replied, \"No, if now I have won your favor, receive this present from me to show that you are my friend. Take, I beg of you, the gift that I bring to you, for God has been generous to me, and I have enough.\" So he urged Esau until he took it.  Then Esau said, \"Let me at least leave with you some of the people who are with me.\" But Jacob replied, \"What need is there? Let me only enjoy your friendship, my Lord.\" So Esau turned back that day on his way to Seir.   JOSEPH SOLD AS A SLAVE BY HIS BROTHERS  When Joseph was seventeen years old, he and his brothers were shepherds, but he made them angry, for he brought a bad report about them to their father. Now Jacob loved his son Joseph, who was born in his old age; and he made him a long coat with sleeves. When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his other sons, they hated Joseph and would not speak to him in a friendly way.  Joseph had a dream which he told to his brothers; and they hated him still more. This is what he said to them, \"I dreamed that, as we were binding sheaves in the field, my sheaf rose up and remained standing, while your sheaves came around and bowed down to my sheaf.\" His brothers said to him, \"Will you really be king over us? Will you indeed rule over us?\" So they hated him still more because of his dreams and his words.  Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, \"I have had another dream, and it seemed to me that the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.\" But when he told it to his father and his brothers, his father reproved him and said, \"What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come and bow down to the earth before you?\" Therefore his brothers were jealous of him; but his father remembered the dream.  When his brothers went to pasture his father's flocks in Shechem, Jacob said to Joseph, \"Go, see whether all goes well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me back word.\" So he sent him out, and a certain man found him, as he was wandering in the field, and the man asked him, \"What are you looking for?\" He said, \"I am looking for my brothers; tell me, I beg of you, where they are pasturing the flock.\" The man said, \"They have gone away, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'\" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.  When they saw him in the distance, before he came to them, they planned together to kill him. And they said one to another, \"See, here comes that great dreamer! Come, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits, and we will say, 'A fierce beast has devoured him.' Then we shall see what will become of his dreams!\"  Judah, however, when he heard it, saved Joseph's life by saying, \"Let us not take his life.\" Reuben also said to them, \"Do not shed blood; throw him into this pit, here in the wilderness; but do not harm him.\" Reuben said this to save Joseph from their hands so that he could bring him back to his father. So when Joseph came to his brothers, they took off his long coat with sleeves and threw him into the pit. But the pit was empty, there being no water in it.  Then they sat down to eat and, when they looked up, they saw a band of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead; and their camels were loaded with spices, gum, and ladanum on their way to carry it down to Egypt. And Judah said to his brothers, \"What do we gain if we kill our brother and hide his blood? Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let us do him no harm, for he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.\" So his brothers listened to him; and, drawing up Joseph, they sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites, who brought him to Egypt.  Then his brothers took Joseph's long coat, killed a he-goat, dipped the coat in the blood, and brought it to their father, and said, \"We found this; see whether it is your son's coat or not.\" He recognized it and said, \"It is my son's coat! A wild beast has devoured him! Joseph surely is torn in pieces.\" Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth about his waist, and mourned for his son many days. All his sons and his daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, saying, \"I shall go down to the grave mourning for my son.\" Thus Joseph's father mourned for him.   JOSEPH'S EAGERNESS TO HELP OTHERS  Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an Egyptian, one of Pharaoh's officers, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites.  Now Jehovah was with Joseph, so that he prospered; and he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian. When his master saw that Jehovah was with him and made everything succeed that he undertook, he trusted him and made him his own servant. He also made him overseer of his household and placed all that he had in his care. From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's household for Joseph's sake, and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had in the house and in the field. Potiphar left all that he had in Joseph's charge, and he knew nothing about his affairs except about the food which he ate. And Joseph was handsome and attractive.  After these honors had come to Joseph, his master's wife tried to tempt him to be unfaithful to his trust. But he refused, saying to her, \"See, my master knows nothing about what I do in the house, and he has put all that he has in my charge. How then can I do this great wrong and sin against God?\" Day after day she tempted Joseph, but he did not listen to her. One day, however, when he went into the house to do his work and when none of the men of the household were at home, she caught hold of his garment and again tried to tempt him, but he left his garment in her hand and fled out of the house.  She kept his garment by her until his master came home; then she said to him, \"The Hebrew slave whom you have brought to us came to me to insult me; and when I cried aloud, he left his garment with me and fled.\"  When Joseph's master heard what his wife said to him, he was very angry; and he took Joseph and put him into the prison, in the place where the king's prisoners were kept. So he was left there in prison. But Jehovah was with Joseph and showed kindness to him and helped him to win the friendship of the keeper of the prison, so that he placed all the prisoners in Joseph's charge and made him responsible for whatever they did there.  After these things the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their master the king of Egypt, and Pharaoh was so angry with these two officers that he put them in the same prison where Joseph was. And the captain of the guard appointed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23580"],["title","The Children's Bible (#8)"],["body","to wait on them; and they stayed in prison for some time.  And the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were in the prison, both had dreams the same night, each with a different meaning. When Joseph came in to them in the morning, he saw plainly that they were sad. So he asked Pharaoh's officers, \"Why do you look so sad to-day?\" They answered, \"We have had a dream, and there is no one who can tell what it means.\" Then Joseph said to them, \"Is not God the one who knows what dreams mean? Tell them to me, if you will.\"  Then the chief butler told his dream to Joseph and said to him, \"In my dream I saw a vine before me, and on the vine were three branches, and the buds put out blossoms, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes. Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed the juice into his cup and gave the cup to Pharaoh.\"  Then Joseph said to him, \"This is what it means: the three branches are three days. Within three days Pharaoh will let you out of prison and restore you to your office, and you will give Pharaoh's cup into his hand as you used to do when you were his butler. But when all goes well with you, remember me, show kindness to me and speak for me to Pharaoh and bring me out of this prison; for I was unjustly stolen from the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me in the dungeon.\"  When the chief baker saw that the meaning of the butler's dream was good, he said to Joseph, \"I also saw something in my dream: there were three baskets of white bread on my head, and in the upper basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.\" Joseph answered, \"This is what it means: the three baskets are three days; within three days Pharaoh will take off your head and hang you on a tree, and the birds shall eat your flesh.\"  Now on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants. Then he set free the chief butler and the chief baker. He restored the chief butler to his office, so that he again gave the cup to Pharaoh; but the chief baker he hanged, as Joseph had told them. Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.   A PRISONER WHO BECAME A MIGHTY RULER  Two years later Pharaoh had a dream: as he stood by the river Nile, he saw coming up from the water seven cows, well fed and fat, for they had been feeding in the river grass. Then seven other cows came up after them out of the Nile, poorly fed and thin, and they stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile. The poorly fed, lean cows ate up the seven well-fed, fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.  Afterward he slept and had a second dream and saw seven ears, plump and good, growing up on one stalk. Also seven ears, thin and withered by the east wind, grew up after them. The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and knew that it was only a dream.  In the morning Pharaoh was worried. So he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt and told them his dreams; but no one could tell him what they meant.  Then the chief butler said to Pharaoh, \"I now remember my sins: Pharaoh was very angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in prison in the house of the captain of the guard. We both had dreams the same night, each with a different meaning. There was also with us a young Hebrew, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams and he told each of us what our dreams meant. And our dreams came true just as he said they would: I was restored to my office, but the chief baker was hanged.\"  Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the dungeon; and he shaved his face, changed his clothes, and came to Pharaoh. Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"I have had a dream, and there is no one who can tell what it means. Now I have heard that when you hear a dream, you can tell what it means.\" Joseph answered Pharaoh, \"Not I; God alone can give Pharaoh a true answer.\"  Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"In my dream as I stood on the bank of the Nile, I saw seven cows, fat and well fed, which had been feeding in the river grass. There came up after them seven more cows, poorly fed and thin, worse than I ever saw in all the land of Egypt; and the lean and poorly fed cows ate up the first seven fat cows. When they had eaten them up, one could not tell that they had eaten them, for they were still as thin as at the beginning. Then I awoke.  \"Again I dreamed and saw seven ears, plump and good, grow up on one stalk; then seven thin ears, withered with the east wind, sprang up after them; and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. I have told the dream to the magicians, but there is no one who can tell me what it means.\"  Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, \"Pharaoh's two dreams mean the same thing; God has made known to Pharaoh what he is about to do. The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years. It is one dream. The seven lean and poorly fed cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears withered with the east wind mean seven years of famine. That is why I said to Pharaoh, 'God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.' Seven years of great plenty all through the land of Egypt are coming. They shall be followed by seven years of famine, so that all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will use up all that the land produces; and plenty will not be known in the land because of that famine which follows, for it will be very severe.  \"The dream came twice to Pharaoh to show that the famine will surely come, and that God will soon make the dream come true. Now therefore let Pharaoh pick out a man who is sensible and wise and place him in charge of the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh act quickly and put overseers over the land and collect one-fifth of all that grows in the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty. Let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh, and let them hold it in the cities for food. The food will supply the land during the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, so that the people of the land may not die because of the famine.\"  The plan pleased Pharaoh and all his people; and he said to his people, \"Can we find one like this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?\" So Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"As God has shown you all this, there is no one so sensible and wise as you. You shall be at the head of my country, and all my people shall be ruled as you command. Only on the throne I will be above you.\"  So Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"See, I have placed you over all the land of Egypt.\" And Pharaoh took off his signet-ring from his finger and put it upon Joseph's finger and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a golden collar about his neck. He also made him ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, \"Attention!\" So he placed him over all the land of Egypt. Pharaoh also said to Joseph, \"I am Pharaoh, but without your consent no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.\" Pharaoh gave him as a wife Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera. And Joseph was thirty years old when he was made the ruler of the land of Egypt.  In the seven years of plenty there were large harvests, and Joseph gathered up all the food of the seven years of plenty, which were in the land of Egypt, and stored the food in the cities, putting in each city the food that grew in the fields about it. Joseph stored up grain as the sand of the sea, in great quantities, until he no longer kept account, because it could not be measured.  When the seven years of plenty in the land of Egypt were over, the seven years of famine began, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but all through the land of Egypt there was food, for when all the land of Egypt was hungry, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, \"Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.\" So when the famine was over all the country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold food to the Egyptians: but the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. The peoples of all lands came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, for everywhere the famine was severe.   THE TESTING OF JOSEPH'S BROTHERS  When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, \"Why do you stand looking at each other? I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt; go down there and buy some for us, that we may live and not die.\" So Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's own brother, with his brothers, for he feared that some harm might come to him. So the sons of Jacob went with others to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.  Now Joseph was the governor over Egypt; it was he who sold grain to all the people of the land. So Joseph's brothers came and bowed before him with their faces to the earth. When Joseph saw his brothers, he knew them; but he acted as a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them and said, \"Where do you come from?\" They said, \"From the land of Canaan to buy food.\" So Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him.  Joseph also remembered the dreams which he had had about them and said to them, \"You spies! you have come to see how defenseless the land is.\" But they said to him, \"No, my lord; your servants have come to buy food. We are all sons of one man; we are honest men; your servants are not spies.\" But he again said to them, \"No, you have come to see how defenseless the land is.\" They answered, \"We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one father in the land of Canaan. The youngest is to-day with our father, and one is dead.\" Joseph said to them, \"It is just as I said to you, 'You are spies.' By this you shall be tested: as sure as Pharaoh lives you"]]]
