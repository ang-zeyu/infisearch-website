Lucy did, however, and became observant, while George continued--  \"But methinks, Fred, that the long visit you paid her lately must have been sadly misapplied if you have not pumped her history out of her.\"  \"I went to paint, not to pump.  Perhaps Mr Macdonald can tell me about her.\"  \"Not I,\" said Hector, lighting a cigar.  \"I only know that she lost her grandson about six years ago, and that she's been mad ever since, poor thing.\"  \"For shame, Hector,\" said Flora; \"you know that poor old Moggy is no more mad than yourself.\"  \"Possibly not, sweet sister, but as you often tell me that I _am_ mad, and as I never deny the charge, it seems to me that you have said nothing to vindicate the old woman's character for sanity.\"  \"Poor thing,\" said Flora, turning from her brother, and speaking with warmth to Fred; \"if you knew how much that unhappy old creature has suffered, you would not be surprised to find her somewhat cross at times.  She is one of my people, and I'm very glad to find that you take an interest in her.\"  \"`My people!'  Flora then takes an interest in the poor,\" thought the observant Lucy.  Another link was added to the chain of friendship.  \"Do tell us about her, please,\" cried George.  \"There is nothing that I love so much as a story--especially a horrible one, with two or three dreadful murders to chill one's blood, and a deal of retributive justice to warm it up again.  I'm dying to know about old Moggy.\"  \"Are you?\" said Flora saucily.  \"I'm glad to hear that, because I mean to keep you in a dying state.  I will tell the story as a dead secret to Lucy, when I take her to see my poor people, and you sha'n't hear it for weeks to come.\"  George cast up his eyes in affected despair, and said with a groan, that he \"would endeavour to exist notwithstanding.\"  \"Oh!  _I_ know all about old Moggy,\" cried Jacky with energy.  Everyone looked at the boy in surprise.  In the midst of the foregoing dialogue he had suddenly ceased to tempt his fate, and sat down quietly with a hand on each knee and his eyes fixed intently on Flora Macdonald--to the surprise and secret joy of his mother, who, being thus relieved from anxiety on his account, had leisure to transfer the agony of her attention to the boat.  \"What do _you_ know about her, child?\" asked Flora.  \"She's jolly,\" replied the boy with prompt vivacity.  \"Most genuine testimony in her favour,\" laughed Hector, \"though the word is scarcely appropriate to one whose temper is sour.\"  \"Why do you think her jolly, my boy?\" said Flora.  \"'Cause I do.  She's a old brick!\"  \"Jacky, darling,\" said Mrs Sudberry, \"do try to give up those ugly slang words--they're _so_ naughty--that is to say--at least--they are very ugly if they're not positively naughty.\"  \"She's a jolly old brick,\" retorted Jacky, with a look at his mother that was the concentrated essence of defiance.  \"Dear child!\"  Lucy snickered and coughed somewhat violently into her handkerchief; while Flora, repressing a smile, said--  \"But why does Jacky like old Moggy so much?\"  \"Hallo! don't run us ashore,\" shouted Mr Sudberry, starting up with a sudden impetuosity which shook the boat and sent a pang to the heart of his wife, the sharpness of which no words can convey.  A piercing shriek, however, betrayed the state of her feelings as the boat was swept violently round by George to avoid a point of rock.  As they were now drawing near to the spot where it was proposed that they should picnic, Jacky suddenly became alive to the fact that in his interest about old Moggy he had been betrayed into a forgetfulness of his opportunities.  No time was to be lost.  Turning round with a cheer, he made a desperate plunge at the water and went much farther over than he had intended, insomuch that he would certainly have taken a \"header\" into its depths, had not McAllister grasped him by the baggy region of his trousers and gravely lifted him into his mother's lap.  Next moment the boat's keel grated sharply on the gravel, to the horror of Mrs Sudberry, who, having buried her face in the bosom of her saved son, saw not what had occurred, and regarded the shock as her death-warrant.  Thus agreeably the picnic continued!    STORY ONE, CHAPTER 7.  THE PICNIC CONCLUDED.  What a glorious day it was, and what spirits it put everybody in!  The sun shone with an intensity almost torrid; the spot on which they had landed was green and bright, like a slice out of the realms of Fairy-land.  No zephyr dared to disturb the leaves or the glassy water; great clouds hung in the bright blue sky--rotund, fat, and heavy, like mountains of wool or butter.  Everything in nature seemed to have gone to sleep at noon, as if Spanish principles had suddenly imbued the universe.  And what a business they had, to be sure, with the spreading of the viands and the kindling of the fire!  The latter was the first duty. Hector said he would undertake it, but after attempting to light it with damp sticks he gave it up and assisted the ladies to lay the cloth on the grass.  Then George and Fred got the fire to kindle, and Mr Sudberry, in attempting to mend it, burnt his fingers and put it out; whereupon McAllister came to his rescue and got it to blaze in right earnest.  Jacky thereafter tried to jump over it, fell into it, and was saved from premature destruction by being plucked out and quenched before having received any further damage than the singeing of his hair and eyelashes.  He was thus rendered a little more hideous and impish-like than Nature had intended him to be.  Jacky happened to be particularly bad that day.  Not only was he more bent on mischief than usual, but Fortune seemed to enhance the value, (so to speak), of his evil doings, by connecting them with disasters of an unexpected nature.  He tried to leap over a small stream, (in Scotland styled a burn), and fell into it.  This necessitated drying at the fire--a slow process and disagreeable in all circumstances, but especially so when connected with impatience and headstrong obstinacy. Then he put his foot on a plate of sandwiches, and was within an ace of sitting down on a jam tart, much to his own consternation, poor boy, for had he destroyed _that_, the chief source of his own prospective felicity would have been dried up.  It is not to be supposed that everyone regarded Jacky's eccentricities with the forgiving and loving spirit of his mother.  Mr Sudberry, good man, did not mind much; he was out for a day's enjoyment, and having armed himself _cap-a-pie_ with benevolence, was invulnerable.  Not so the other members of the party, all of whom had to exercise a good deal of forbearance towards the boy.  McAllister took him on his knee and gravely began to entertain him with a story, for which kindness Jacky kicked his shins and struggled to get away; so the worthy man smiled sadly, and let him go, remarking that Ovid himself would be puzzled to metamorphose him into a good boy--this in an undertone, of course.  Hector Macdonald was somewhat sanguine and irascible in temper.  He felt a tingling in his fingers, and an irresistible desire to apply them to the ears of the little boy.  \"Come here, Jacky!\" said he.  Flora, who understood his feelings, smiled covertly while she busied herself with cups, plates, and pannikins.  Lucy, who did not understand his feelings, thought, \"he must be a good-natured fellow to speak so kindly to a child who had annoyed him very much.\"  Lucy did not admit that she herself had been much annoyed by her little brother's pertinacity in interrupting conversation between her and Hector, although she might have done so with perfect truth.  Jacky advanced with hesitation.  Hector bent down playfully and seized him by both arms, turning his back upon the party, and thus bringing his own bulky figure between them and young Hopeful.  \"Jack, I want you to be good.\"  \"I won't!\" promptly said, and with much firmness.  \"Oh, yes, you will!\"  A stern masculine countenance within an inch of his nose, and a vigorous little shake, somewhat disconcerted Jacky, who exhibited a tendency to roar; but Hector closed his strong hands on the little arms so suddenly and so powerfully, that, being unexpectedly agonised, Jacky was for a moment paralysed.  The awful glare of a pair of bright blue eyes, and the glistening of a double row of white teeth, did not tend to re-assure him.  \"Oh, yes, you will, my little man!\" repeated Hector, tumbling him over on his back with a smile of ineffable sweetness, but with a little touch of violence that seemed inconsistent therewith.  Jacky rose, gasped, and ran away, glancing over his shoulder with a look of alarm.  This little piece of by-play was not observed by any one but Flora, who exchanged a bright glance and a smile with her brother.  The imp was quelled--he had met his match!  During the remainder of the picnic he disturbed no one, but kept at the farthest possible distance from Hector that was consistent with being one of the party.  But it is not to be supposed that his nature was changed.  No--Jacky's wickedness only sought a new channel in which to flow.  He consoled himself with thoughts of the dire mischief he would perpetrate when the dinner was over.  Meanwhile, he sat down and gloated over the jam tart,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23507"],["title","A Short History of Pittsburgh (#0)"],["body","was produced from images generously made available by Case Western Reserve University Preservation Department Digital Library)                                      A SHORT HISTORY                                   OF                               PITTSBURGH                               1758-1908         [Illustration: George Washington, the first Pittsburgher]                              A SHORT HISTORY                                   OF                               PITTSBURGH                               1758-1908                                   BY                          SAMUEL HARDEN CHURCH                  AUTHOR OF \"OLIVER CROMWELL: A HISTORY,\"            \"PENRUDDOCK OF THE WHITE LAMBS,\" \"JOHN MARMADUKE,\"                         \"BEOWULF: A POEM,\" ETC.

P. Putnam's Sons, of New York and London, a brief historical sketch of Pittsburgh. The approach of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Pittsburgh, and the elaborate celebrations planned in connection therewith, led to many requests that I would reprint the sketch in its own covers as a souvenir of the occasion. Finding it quite inadequate for permanent preservation in its original form, I have, after much research and painstaking labor, rewritten the entire work, adding many new materials, and making of it what I believe to be a complete, though a short, history of our city. The story has developed itself into three natural divisions: historical, industrial, and intellectual, and the record will show that under either one of these titles Pittsburgh is a notable, and under all of them, an imperial, city.  S. H. C.  Lake Placid Club,   Adirondack Mountains,     August 25, 1908.   A SHORT HISTORY OF PITTSBURGH 1758-1908     A SHORT HISTORY OF PITTSBURGH     HISTORICAL   I  George Washington, the Father of his Country, is equally the Father of Pittsburgh, for he came thither in November, 1753, and established the location of the now imperial city by choosing it as the best place for a fort. Washington was then twenty-one years old. He had by that time written his precocious one hundred and ten maxims of civility and good behavior; had declined to be a midshipman in the British navy; had made his only sea-voyage to Barbados; had surveyed the estates of Lord Fairfax, going for months into the forest without fear of savage Indians or wild beasts; and was now a major of Virginia militia. In pursuance of the claim of Virginia that she owned that part of Pennsylvania in which Pittsburgh is situated, Washington came there as the agent of Governor Dinwiddie to treat with the Indians. With an eye alert for the dangers of the wilderness, and with Christopher Gist beside him, the young Virginian pushed his cautious way to \"The Point\" of land where the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers forms the Ohio. That, he declared, with clear military instinct, was the best site for a fort; and he rejected the promontory two miles below, which the Indians had recommended for that purpose. Washington made six visits to the vicinity of Pittsburgh, all before his presidency, and on three of them (1753, 1758, and 1770), he entered the limits of the present city. At the time of despatching the army to suppress the whisky insurrection, while he was President, in 1794, he came toward Pittsburgh as far as Bedford, and then, after planning the march, returned to Philadelphia. His contact with the place was, therefore, frequent, and his information always very complete. There is a tradition, none the less popular because it cannot be proved, which ascribes to Washington the credit of having suggested the name of Pittsburgh to General Forbes when the place was captured from the French. However this may be, we do know that Washington was certainly present when the English flag was hoisted and the city named Pittsburgh, on Sunday, November 26, 1758. And at that moment Pittsburgh became a chief bulwark of the British Empire in America.   II  As early as 1728, a daring hunter or trader found the Indians at the head waters of the Ohio,--among them the Delawares, Shawanese, Mohicans, and Iroquois,--whither they tracked the bear from their village of Logstown, seventeen miles down the river. They also employed the country roundabout as a highway for their march to battle against other tribes, and against each other. At that time France and England were disputing for the new continent. France, by right of her discovery of the Mississippi, claimed all lands drained by that river and its tributaries, a contention which would naturally plant her banner upon the summit of the Alleghany Mountains. England, on the other hand, claimed everything from ocean shore to ocean shore. This situation produced war, and Pittsburgh became the strategic key of the great Middle West. The French made early endeavors to win the allegiance of the Indians, and felt encouraged to press their friendly overtures because they usually came among the red men for trading or exploration, while the English invariably seized and occupied their lands. In 1731 some French settlers did attempt to build a group of houses at Pittsburgh, but the Indians compelled them to go away. The next year the governor of Pennsylvania summoned two Indian chiefs from Pittsburgh to say why they had been going to see the French governor at Montreal; and they gave answer that he had sent for them only to express the hope that both English and French traders might meet at Pittsburgh and carry on trade amicably. The governor of Pennsylvania sought to induce the tribes to draw themselves farther east, where they might be made to feel the hand of authority, but Sassoonan, their chief, forbade them to stir. An Iroquois chief who joined his entreaties to those of the governor was soon afterward killed by some Shawanese braves, but they were forced to flee into Virginia to escape the vengeance of his tribe.  Louis Celeron, a French officer, made an exploration of the country contiguous to Pittsburgh in 1747, and formally enjoined the governor of Pennsylvania not to occupy the ground, as France claimed its sovereignty. A year later the Ohio Company was formed, with a charter ceding an immense tract of land for sale and development, including Pittsburgh. This corporation built some storehouses at Logstown to facilitate their trade with the Indians, which were captured by the French, together with skins and commodities valued at 20,000 francs; and the purposes of the company were never accomplished.   III  Washington's first visit to Pittsburgh occurred in November, 1753, while he was on his way to the French fort at Leboeuff. He was carrying a letter from the Ohio Company to Contrecoeur, protesting against the plans of the French commander in undertaking to establish a line of forts to reach from Lake Erie to the mouth of the Ohio River. The winter season was becoming very severe, in despite of which Washington and Gist were forced to swim with their horses across the Allegheny River. On the way they fell in with a friendly Indian, Keyashuta, a Seneca chief, who showed them much kindness, and for whom a suburban town, Guyasuta, is named.  Washington, in writing of his first sight of the forks of the river, says:       As I got down before the canoe, I spent some time in viewing the      rivers and the land at the fork, which I think extremely well      situated for a fort, as it has the absolute command of both rivers.      The land at the point is twenty-five feet above the common surface      of the water, and a considerable bottom of flat, well-timbered land      all around it very convenient for building. The rivers are each a      quarter of a mile across and run here very nearly at right angles,      the Allegheny being northeast and the Monongahela southeast. The      former of these two is a very rapid and swift-running water, the      other deep and still without any perceptible fall. About two miles      from this on the southeast side of the river at a place where the      Ohio Company intended to erect a fort, lives Shingiss, King of the      Delawares. We called upon him to"]]]
