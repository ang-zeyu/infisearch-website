The slightest thing alarmed them.  When about one hundred and fifty leagues west of Ferro, they picked up part of the mast of a large vessel, and the crews fancied that she must have been wrecked drifting ominously to the entrance of those unknown seas.  About nightfall, on the 13th of September, he for the first time noticed the variation of the needle, which, instead of pointing to the north star, varied about half a point.  He remarked that this variation of the needle increased as he advanced.  He quieted the alarm of his pilots, when they observed this, by assuring them that the variation was not caused by any fallacy in the compass, but by the movement of the north star itself, which, like the other heavenly bodies, described a circle round the pole.  The explanation appeared so highly plausible and ingenious that it was readily received.  On the 14th of September they believed that they were near land, from seeing a heron and a tropical bird, neither of which were supposed to venture far out to sea.  The following night the mariners were awestruck by beholding a meteor of great brilliancy--a common phenomenon in those latitudes.  With a favourable breeze, day after day, the squadron was wafted on, so that it was unnecessary to shift a single sail.  They now began to observe patches of weeds drifting from the west, which increased in size as they advanced.  These, together with a white tropical bird which never sleeps on the water, made Columbus hope that he was approaching some island; for, as he had come but three hundred and sixty leagues since leaving the Canary Islands, he supposed the mainland still to be far off.  The breeze was soft and steady, the water smooth.  The crews were in high spirits, and every seaman was on the look-out, for a pension of ten thousand maravedis had been promised to him who should first discover land.  Alonzo Pinzon in the _Pinta_ took the lead.  On the afternoon of the 13th of September he hailed the Admiral, saying that from the flight of numerous birds and the appearance of the northern horizon, he thought there was land in that direction; but Columbus replied that it was merely a deception of the clouds, and would not alter his course.  The following day there were drizzling showers, and two boobies flew on board the _Santa Maria_, birds which seldom wander more than twenty leagues from land.  Sounding, however, no bottom was found.  Unwilling to waste the present fair breeze, he resolved, whatever others thought, to keep one bold course until the coast of India was reached.  Notwithstanding, even the favourable breeze began to frighten the seamen, who imagined that the wind in those regions might always blow from the east, and if so, would prevent their return to Spain.  Not long after the wind shifted to the south-west, and restored their courage, proving to them that the wind did not always prevail from the east.  Several small birds also visited the ships, singing as they perched on the rigging, thus showing that they were not exhausted by their flight.  Again the squadron passed among numerous patches of seaweed, and the crews, ever ready to take alarm, having heard that ships were sometimes frozen in by ice, fancied that they might be fixed in the same manner, until they were caught by the nipping hand of winter.  Then they took it into their heads that the water was growing shoaler, and expressed their fears that they might run on some sand-banks and be lost.  Then a whale was seen, which creature Columbus assured them never went far from land.  Notwithstanding, they became uneasy at the calmness of the weather, declaring that as the prevailing winds were from the east, and had not power to disturb the torpid stillness of the ocean, there was the risk of perishing amidst stagnant and shoreless waters, and being prevented by contrary winds from ever returning to Spain.  Next a swell got up, which showed that their terrors caused by the calm were imaginary.  Notwithstanding this, and the favourable signs which increased his confidence, he feared that after all, breaking into mutiny, they would compel him to return.  The sailors fancied that their ships were too weak for so long a voyage, and held secret consultations, exciting each other's discontent.  They had gone farther than any one before had done.  Who could blame them, should they, consulting their safety, turn back?  Columbus, though aware of the mutinous disposition of his crew, maintained a serene and steady countenance, using gentle words with some, stimulating the pride and avarice of others, and threatening the refractory.  On the 25th of September the wind again became favourable, and the squadron resumed its westerly course.  Pinzon now, on examining the chart, supposed that they must be approaching Cipango.  Columbus desired to have it returned, and it was thrown on board at the end of a line.  While Columbus and his pilot were studying it, they heard a shout, and looking up saw Pinzon standing at the stern of the _Pinta_, crying, \"Land! land!  Senor, I claim my reward!\"  There was indeed an appearance of land to the south-west.  Columbus and the other officers threw themselves on their knees, and returned thanks to God.  The seamen, mounting the rigging, strained their eyes in the direction pointed out, but the morning light put an end to their hopes.  Again with dejected hearts they proceeded, the sea, as before, tranquil, the breeze propitious, and the weather mild and delightful.  In a day or two more weeds were seen floating from east to west, but no birds were visible.  The people again expressed their fears that they had passed between two islands; but after the lapse of another day the ships were visited by numberless birds, and various indications of land became more numerous.  Full of hope, the seamen ascended the rigging, and were continually crying out that they saw land.  Columbus put a stop to these false alarms, declaring that should any one assert that they saw land, and it was not discovered within three days, he should forfeit all claim to the reward.  Pinzon now proposed that they should steer south-west, but Columbus persisted in keeping a westerly course.  On the 7th of October, at sunrise, several of the Admiral's crew fancied that they saw land; the _Nina_ pressing forward, a flag was run up at her masthead, and a gun was fired,--the preconcerted signal for land.  The captain and his crew were mistaken notwithstanding.  The clouds which had deceived them melted away.  The crews again became dejected. But once more flocks of field birds were seen flying through the air to the south-west, and Columbus, having already run the distance at the termination of which he had expected to find the island of Cipango, fancied he might have missed it.  He therefore altered his course to the south-west.  As the ships advanced the signs of land increased: a heron, a pelican, and a duck were seen bound in the same direction.  Branches of trees, and grass, fresh and green, were observed.  The crews, however, believing these to be mere delusions for leading them on to destruction, insisted on abandoning the voyage.  Columbus sternly resisted their importunities, and the following day a branch of thorn, with berries on it, and a staff artificially carved, with other articles, were picked up, showing that land must be close at hand.  All gloom and mutiny now gave way to sanguine expectations, and Columbus promised a doublet of velvet, in addition to the pension to be given by the sovereign, to whosoever should first see the longed-for shore.  As he walked the high poop of his ship at night, his eye continually ranging along the horizon, he thought he saw a light glimmering at a great distance.  Fearing that his hopes might deceive him, he successively called up two of his officers.  They both saw it, apparently proceeding from a torch in the bark of a fisherman, or held in the hand of some person on shore, borne up as he walked.  So uncertain were these gleams that few attached any importance to them. The ships continued their course until two in the morning, when Rodrigo de Triana, a seaman on board the _Pinta_, descried land at two leagues ahead.  A gun was fired from the _Santa Maria_, to give the joyful news. When all doubt on the subject was banished the ships lay to.  Who can picture the thoughts and feelings of Columbus, as he walked the deck, impatiently waiting for dawn, which was to show him clearly the long-sought-for land, with, as he hoped, its spicy groves, its glittering temples, its gilded cities, and all the splendour of Oriental civilisation!  As the dawn of the 12th of October, 1492, increased, Columbus first observed one of the outlying islands of the New World.  It was several leagues in extent, level, and covered with trees, and populated, for the naked inhabitants were seen running from all parts to the shore, and gazing with astonishment at the ships.  The anchors being dropped, the boats manned, he, richly attired in scarlet and holding the royal standard, accompanied by the Pinzons in their own boats, approached the shore.  On landing he threw himself on his knees, and kissing the earth, returned thanks to God, the rest following his example.  He then, drawing his sword, took possession of the island, which he named San Salvador, in the names of the sovereigns of Castile.  The crews now thronged round the Admiral, some embracing him, others kissing his hands, expressing their joy; the most mutinous becoming the most enthusiastic and devoted.  The natives, who had at first fled, supposing the ships monsters which had risen from the deep, recovering their fears, now timidly advanced, lost in admiration at the shining armour and splendid dresses of the Spaniards, and their complexions and beards, at once recognising the Admiral as the commander of the strangers.  Columbus, pleased with their gentleness,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23494"],["title","Notable Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold (#4)"],["body","them to scrutinise him, and won them by his benignity.  The natives were equally objects of curiosity to the Spaniards.  They were naked, painted all over with a variety of colours and designs.  Their complexion was tawny, and they were destitute of beards; their hair not crisp, like that of negroes, but straight and coarse; their features were agreeable; their stature moderate and well shaped; their foreheads lofty, and their eyes remarkably fine.  As Columbus supposed that he had landed on an island at the extremity of India, he called the natives Indians, as the inhabitants of the New World have ever since been denominated.  Their only arms were lances pointed with the teeth or bones of fishes.  There was no iron seen, and so ignorant were the natives of its properties, that one of them took a drawn sword by the edge, not aware that it would cut.  Columbus, to win their confidence, distributed among them coloured caps, hawks' bells, and glass beads, with which they were highly pleased, allowing the Spaniards unmolested to walk about the groves examining the beautiful trees, the shrubs, fruits, and flowers, all so strange to them.  The next morning canoes of all sizes, formed out of single trees, came off, some holding one man, some forty or fifty, who managed them with great dexterity.  They readily accepted toys and trinkets, which, supposing them to be brought from heaven, possessed a supernatural virtue in their eyes.  The only things they had to give in return were parrots and balls of cotton-yarn, besides cassava cakes, formed from the flour of a root called yuca, which they cultivated in their fields.  The Spaniards, who were eagerly looking out for gold, were delighted to obtain some small ornaments of that metal in exchange for beads and hawks' bells.  As it was a royal monopoly, Columbus forbade any traffic in it, as he did also in cotton, reserving to the crown all trade in it.  Misled by the accounts he had read in Marco Polo's works, he was from the first persuaded that he had arrived at the islands lying opposite Cathay in the Chinese seas, and that the country to the south, which he understood from the natives abounded in gold, must be the famous island of Cipango.  San Salvador, where he first landed, still retains its name, though called by the English from its shape Cat Island.  It is one of the great cluster of the Lucayos or Bahama Islands.  Coasting round it in the boats, the Admiral visited various spots, and had friendly intercourse with the natives, to whom he gave glass beads and other trifles.  He landed at another place, where there were six Indian huts surrounded by groves and gardens as beautiful as those of Castile.  At last the sailors, wearied with their exertions, returned to the ships, carrying seven Indians, that they might, by acquiring the Spanish language, serve as interpreters.  Taking in a supply of wood and water, the squadron sailed the same evening to the south, where the Admiral expected to discover Cipango.  As the Indians told him there were upwards of a hundred islands in the neighbourhood, he was confirmed in his belief that they must be those described by Marco Polo, abounding with gold, silver, drugs, and spices.  Several other islands were visited, but the explorers looked in vain for bracelets and anklets of gold.  One day, just as the ships were about to make sail, one of the San Salvador Indians on board the _Nina_, plunging overboard, swam to a large canoe which had come near.  A boat was sent in chase, but the Indians in their light canoe escaped, and reaching the island fled to the woods.  Shortly afterwards a canoe, having on board a single native, coming near, he was captured and brought to Columbus, who, treating him with kindness won his heart; his canoe was also restored to him, and that taken by the _Nina_ was set at liberty.  Soon afterwards, while traversing the channel between two islands, when about midway another Indian in his canoe was overtaken, a string of glass beads round his neck, showing that he had come from San Salvador.  Columbus, admiring his hardihood, had him and his canoe taken on board, when he was treated with great kindness, bread and honey being given him to eat.  It was too late to select a spot through the transparent sea for anchoring, and the ship lay to until the morning, while the Indian voyager, with all his effects and loaded with presents, was allowed to depart.  Next day the natives came off, bringing fruits, and roots, and pure water.  They were treated in the same way as the former had been.  Their huts, which were formed of tall poles and branches neatly interwoven with palm-leaves of a circular form, were visited.  They were clean and neat, and generally sheltered under wide-spreading trees.  For beds they had nets of cotton extended between two posts, which they called hammocks, a name since generally adopted by seamen.  Columbus, as he sailed round the island, found a magnificent harbour, sufficient to hold a hundred ships.  He was delighted with the beauty of the scenery, the shady groves, the fruits, the herbs and flowers,--all differing so greatly from those of Spain.  Everywhere the natives received their visitors as superior beings, and gladly conducted them to the coolest springs, and assisted them in rolling their casks to the boats.  To the last island visited by Columbus he gave the name of Fernandina.  Sailing thence on the 19th of October, he steered in quest of a large island called Saometo, where, misled by his guides, he expected to find the sovereign of the surrounding islands, habited in rich clothes and jewels and gold, possessed of great treasures, a large city, and a gold-mine.  Neither were found; but the voyagers were delighted with the balmy air, the beautiful scenery, the graceful trees, the vast flocks of parrots and other birds of gorgeous plumage, and the fish, which rivalled them in the brilliancy of their colours.  No animals were seen, with the exception of a dog which never barked, a species of rabbit, and numerous lizards and iguanas.  Columbus was as much misled by his own fervent imagination as by not comprehending the accounts given him by the natives.  He proposed that his stay at those islands should depend upon the quantity of gold, spices, precious stones, and other objects of Oriental trade which he should find there.  After this he intended to proceed to the mainland of India, which he calculated was within ten days' sail, and there, after visiting some of its magnificent capitals described by Marco Polo, he would deliver the letters of the sovereigns to the Grand Khan, with whose reply he would return triumphantly to Spain.  Such was his idea when, leaving the Bahamas, he went in quest of the island of Cuba, of which he had been told.  Touching at various islands, having crossed the Bahama bank, he came in sight of Cuba on the morning of the 28th of October.  He was struck as he approached by its lofty mountains, its far-stretching headlands, its plains and valleys, and noble rivers.  He anchored in a beautiful stream, the banks overhung with trees.  Here landing, he took possession of the island, giving it the name of Juana, in honour of Prince Juan, and the river that of San Salvador.  Going on shore in search of the inhabitants, he found only two abandoned huts, containing a few nets, hooks, and harpoons of bone, showing that the owners were mere savages.  Again he was delighted with the scenery, and the vast flights of birds of gorgeous plumage, parrots, woodpeckers, and humming-birds flitting among the trees, and sucking honey from the flowers.  He fancied too, from the smell of the woods, that he perceived the fragrance of Oriental spices.  He discovered also shells of the kind of oysters which produce pearls.  Having experienced since his arrival soft and genial weather, he concluded that a perpetual serenity reigned over those happy seas. Though the inhabitants had fled, he remarked that their dwellings were better built than those he had hitherto seen, being clean in the extreme; and as he discovered a few rude statues and wooden masks ingeniously carved, he supposed that these signs of civilisation would go on increasing as he advanced towards _terra firma_.  He fancied that the inhabitants had fled, mistaking his armament for one of those scouring expeditions sent by the Grand Khan to make prisoners and slaves.  He, however, with the assistance of his Indian friends, succeeded in calming the fears of the natives, who came off in sixteen canoes, bringing cotton-yarn and other simple articles of traffic.  He forbade, however, all trading for anything but gold, that the natives might be tempted to produce the real riches of their country.  Again misled by his guides, he was induced to believe that a powerful chief lived in the interior of the country, and two of his officers were therefore dispatched, carrying presents and specimens of spices and drugs, to ascertain whether such productions were to be found there. They were directed also to obtain all the information they could respecting it.  While his envoys were absent he had his ships careened and repaired. During this time reports were brought him of the existence of cinnamon-trees, nutmegs, and rhubarb; and his native friends, when he showed them gold and pearls, declared that there were people in an island called Bohio who wore such things round their necks, arms, and ankles.  The return of the envoys was eagerly looked forward to, but their report when they appeared quickly disabused the Admiral's mind.  After travelling about twelve leagues they arrived at a village of about fifty houses, containing a thousand inhabitants, who had received them with every mark of respect, looking upon them as beings of a superior order. The villagers, however, were as little advanced in civilisation as those on the coast, nor was gold, cinnamon, nor pepper to be found among them, although they said such things "]]]
