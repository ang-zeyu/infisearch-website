Tom dropped it back without even opening the flap. He closed the box and took a deep breath. \"Then you really believe that it was an accident and nothing more?\" he said to the major.  Major Briarton shook his head. \"What I think or don't think doesn't make any difference. It just doesn't matter. In order to do anything, I've got to have evidence, and there just isn't any evidence. I can't even take a ship out there for a second look, with the evidence I have, and that's all there is to it.\"  \"But you think that maybe it wasn't an accident, just the same,\" Tom pursued.  The major hesitated. Then he shook his head again. \"I'm sorry, but I've got to stand on what I've said. And I think you'd better stand on it, too. There's nothing else to be done.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It should have been enough, but it wasn't. As Tom Hunter walked with his brother down the broad Upper Ramp to the business section of Sun Lake City, he could not shake off the feeling of helpless anger, the growing conviction that Roger Hunter's death involved something more than the tragic accident in space that Major Briarton had insisted it was.  \"He didn't tell us everything he knew,\" Tom said fiercely. \"He didn't say everything he wanted to say, either. He doesn't think it was an accident any more than I do.\"  \"How do you know, are you a mind reader?\"  \"No.\"  \"Well, Dad wasn't a superman, either. He was taking an awful risk, trying to work a mining rig by himself, and he had a bad break. Why do you have to have somebody to blame for it?\"  \"Keep talking,\" Tom said. \"You'll convince yourself yet.\"  Greg just jammed his hands in his pockets, and they walked in silence for a moment.  For Tom and Greg Hunter, Sun Lake City had always been home. Now they walked along the Main Concourse, Tom with the aluminum box under his arm, Greg with his own spacer's pack thrown over his shoulder. They didn't talk; rather than being drawn closer by the news of the tragedy, it seemed that they had drawn farther apart, as though the one common link that had held them together had suddenly been broken.  Finally Tom broke the silence. \"At least there's one thing we can do,\" he said. \"I'm going to call Johnny Coombs.\"  He shortly found a phone booth and dialed a number. Johnny had been a friend of the family for years; he and Roger Hunter had been partners in many mining ventures in the Asteroid Belt before Roger had taken his position with Jupiter Equilateral. If Johnny had any suspicions that Roger Hunter's accident had been more than an accident, he certainly would not hesitate to voice them....  After a dozen rings, Tom hung up, tried another number. There was no answer there, either. Frowning, Tom rang the city's central paging system. \"Put in a personal call for Johnny Coombs,\" he said when the \"record\" signal flashed on. \"Tell him to contact the Hunters when he comes in. We'll be at home....\"  They resumed their silent walk. When they reached H wing on the fourth level, they turned right down an apartment corridor, and stopped in front of a familiar doorway. Tom pressed his palm against the lock-plate, and the door swung open.  It was home to them, the only home they had ever known. Soft lights sprang up on the walls of the apartment as the door opened. Tom saw the old bookcases lining the walls, the drafting-board and light at the far end of the room, the simple chairs and dining table, the door which led into the bedroom and kitchen beyond. The room had the slightly disheveled look that it had had ever since Mom had died ... a slipper on the floor here, a book face down on the couch there....  It looked as though Dad had just stepped out for an hour or so.  Tom was three steps into the room before he saw the visitor.  The man was sitting comfortably in Roger Hunter's easy chair, a short, fat man with round pink cheeks that sagged a little and a double chin that rested on his neck scarf. There were two other men in the room, both large and broad-shouldered; one of them nodded to the fat man, and moved to stand between the boys and the door.  The fat man was out of his seat before the boys could speak, smiling at them and holding out his hand. \"I wanted to be sure to see you before you left the city,\" he was saying, \"so we just came on in to wait. I hope you don't mind our ... butting in, so to speak.\" He chuckled, looking from one twin to the other. \"You don't know me, I suppose. I'm Merrill Tawney. Representing Jupiter Equilateral, you know.\"  Tom took the card he was holding out, looked at the name and the tiny gold symbol in the corner, a letter \"J\" in the center of a triangle. He handed the card to Greg. \"I've seen you before,\" he told the fat man. \"What do you want with us?\"  Tawney smiled again, spreading his hands. \"We've heard about the tragedy, of course. A shocking thing ... Roger was one of our group so recently. We wanted you to know that if there is anything at all we can do to help, we'd be only too glad....\"  \"Thanks,\" Greg said. \"But we're doing just fine.\"  Tawney's smile tightened a little, but he hung onto it. \"I always felt close to your father,\" he said. \"All of us at Jupiter Equilateral did. We were all sorry to see him leave.\"  \"I bet you were,\" Greg said, \"he was the best mining engineer you ever had. But Dad could never stand liars, or crooked ways of doing business.\"  One of the men started for Greg, but the fat man stopped him with a wave of his hand. \"We had our differences of opinion,\" he said. \"We saw things one way, your father saw them another way. But he was a fine man, one of the finest....\"  \"Look, Mr. Tawney, you'd better say what you came to say and get out of here,\" Greg said dangerously, \"before we give your friends here something to do.\"  \"I merely came to offer you some help,\" Tawney said. He was no longer smiling. \"Since your father's death, you two have acquired certain responsibilities. I thought we might relieve you of some of them.\"  \"What sort of responsibilities?\"  \"You have an unmanned orbit-ship which is now a derelict in the Asteroid Belt. You have a scout-ship out there also. You can't just leave them there as a navigation hazard to every ship traveling in the sector. There are also a few mining claims which aren't going to be of much value to you now.\"  \"I see,\" Greg said. \"Are you offering to buy Dad's mining rig?\"  \"Well, I doubt very much that we'd have any use for it, as such. But we could save you the trouble of going out there to haul it in.\"  \"That's very thoughtful,\" Greg said. \"How much are you offering?\"  Tom looked up in alarm. \"Wait a minute,\" he said. \"That rig's not for sale....\"  \"How much?\" Greg repeated.  \"Forty thousand dollars,\" Merrill Tawney said. \"Ship, rig and claims. We'll even pay the transfer tax.\"  Tom stared at the man, wondering if he had heard right. He knew what Roger Hunter had paid for the rig; he had been with Dad when the papers were signed. Tawney's offer was three times as much as the rig was worth.  But Greg was shaking his head. \"I don't think we could sell at that price.\"  The fat man's hands fluttered. \"You understand that those ships are hardly suited to a major mining operation like ours,\" he said, \"and the claims....\" He dismissed them with a wave of his hand. \"Still, we'd want you to be happy with the price. Say, forty-five thousand?\"  Greg hesitated, shook his head again. \"I guess we'd better think it over, Mr. Tawney.\"  \"Fifty thousand is absolutely the top,\" Tawney said sharply. \"I have the papers right here, drawn up for your signatures, but I'm afraid we can't hold the offer open.\"  \"I don't know, we might want to do some mining ourselves,\" Greg said. \"For all we know, Dad might have struck some rich ore on one of those claims.\"  Tawney laughed. \"I hardly think so. Those claims were all Jupiter Equilateral rejects. Our own engineers found nothing but low grade ore on any of them.\"  \"Still, it might be fun to look.\"  \"It could be very expensive fun. Asteroid mining is a dangerous business, even for experts. For amateurs....\" Tawney spread his hands. \"Accidents occur....\"  \"Yes, we've heard about those accidents,\" Greg said coldly. \"I don't think we're quite ready to sell, Mr. Tawney. We may never be ready to sell to you, so don't stop breathing until we call you. Now if there's nothing else, why don't you take your friends and go somewhere else?\"  The fat man scowled; he started to say something more, then saw the look on Greg's face, and shrugged. \"I'd advise you to give it some careful thought,\" he said as he started for the door. \"It might be very foolish for you to try to use that rig.\"  Smiling, Greg closed the door in his face. Then he turned and winked at Tom. \"Great fellow, Mr. Tawney. He almost had me sold.\"  \"So I noticed,\" Tom said. \"For a while I thought you were serious.\"  \"Well, we found out how high they'd go. That's a very generous outfit Mr. Tawney works for.\"  \"Or else a very crooked one,\" Tom said. \"Are you wondering the same thing I'm wondering?\"  \"Yes,\" Greg said slowly. \"I think I am.\"  \"Then that makes three of us,\" a heavy voice rumbled from the bedroom door.         *       *       *       *       *  Johnny Coombs was a tall man, so thin he was almost gangling, with a long nose and shaggy eyebrows jutting out over his eyes. With his rudely cropped hair and his huge hands, he looked like a caricature of a frontier Mars-farmer, but the blue eyes under the eyebrows were not dull.  \"Johnny!\" Tom cried. \"We were trying to find you.\"  \"I know,\" Johnny said. \"So have a lot of other people, includin' your friends there.\"  \"Well, did you hear what Tawney wanted?\"  \"I'm not so quick on my feet any more,\" Johnny Coombs said, \"but I got nothin' wrong with my ears.\" He scratched his jaw and looked up sharply at Greg. \"Not many people nowadays get a chance to bargain with Merrill Tawney.\"  Greg shrugged. \"He named a price and I didn't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23882"],["title","Gold in the Sky (#3)"],["body","it.\"  \"Three times what the rig is worth,\" Coombs said.  \"That's what I didn't like,\" Greg said. \"That outfit wouldn't give us a break like that just for old times' sake. Do you think they would?\"  \"Well, I don't know,\" Johnny said slowly. \"Back before they built the city here, they used to have rats getting into the grub. Came right down off the ships. Got rid of most of them, finally, but it seems to me we've still got some around, even if they've got different shapes now.\" He jerked his thumb toward the bedroom door. \"In case you're wondering, that's why I was standin' back there all this time ... just to make sure you didn't sell out to Tawney no matter what price he offered.\"  Tom jumped up excitedly. \"Then you know something about Dad's accident!\"  \"No, I can't say I do. I wasn't there.\"  \"Do you really think it was an accident?\"  \"Can't prove it wasn't.\"  \"But at least you've got some ideas,\" Tom said.  \"Takes more than ideas to make a case,\" he said at length. \"But there's one thing I do know. I've got no proof, not a shred of it, but I'm sure of one thing just as sure as I'm on Mars.\" He looked at the twins thoughtfully. \"Your dad wasn't just prospecting, out in the Belt. He'd run onto something out there, something big.\"  The twins looked at him. \"Run onto something?\" Greg said. \"You mean....\"  \"I mean I think your dad hit a Big Strike out there, rich metal, a real bonanza lode. Maybe the biggest strike that's ever been made,\" the miner said slowly. \"And then somebody got to him before he could bring it in.\"     3. Too Many Warnings   For a moment, neither of the boys could say anything at all.  From the time they had learned to talk, they had heard stories and tales that the miners and prospectors told about the Big Strike, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the wonderful, elusive goal of every man who had ever taken a ship into the Asteroid Belt.  For almost a hundred and fifty years ... since the earliest days of space exploration ... there had been miners prospecting in the Asteroids. Out there, beyond the orbit of Mars and inside the orbit of Jupiter, were a hundred thousand ... maybe a hundred million, for all anybody knew ... chunks of rock, metal and debris, spinning in silent orbit around the sun. Some few of the Asteroids were big enough to be called planets ... Ceres, five hundred miles in diameter; Juno, Vesta, Pallas, half a dozen more. A few hundred others, ranging in size from ten to a hundred miles in diameter, had been charted and followed in their orbits by the observatories, first from Earth's airless Moon, then from Mars. There were tens of thousands more that had never been charted. Together they made up the Asteroid Belt, spread out in space like a broad road around the sun, echoing the age-old call of the bonanza.  For there was wealth in the Asteroids ... wealth beyond a man's wildest dreams ... if only he could find it.  Earth, with its depleted iron ranges, its exhausted tin and copper mines, and its burgeoning population, was hungry for metal. Earth needed steel, tin, nickel, and zinc; more than anything, Earth needed ruthenium, the rare-earth catalyst that made the huge solar energy converters possible.  Mars was rich in the ores of these metals ... but the ores were buried deep in the ground. The cost of mining them, and of lifting the heavy ore from Mars' gravitational field and carrying it to Earth was prohibitive. Only the finest carbon steel, and the radioactive metals, smelted and purified on Mars and transported to Earth, could be made profitable.  But from the Asteroid Belt, it was a different story. There was no gravity to fight on the tiny asteroids. On these chunks of debris, the metals lay close to the surface, easy to mine. Ships orbiting in the Belt could fill their holds with their precious metal cargoes and transfer them in space to the interplanetary orbit-ships spinning back toward Earth. It was hard work, and dangerous work; most of the ore was low-grade, and brought little return. But always there was the lure of the Big Strike, the lode of almost-pure metal that could bring a fortune back to the man who found it.         *       *       *       *       *  A few such strikes had been made. Forty years before a single claim had brought its owner seventeen million dollars in two years. A dozen other men had stumbled onto fortunes in the Belt ... but such metal-rich fragments were grains of sand in a mighty river. For every man who found one, a thousand others spent years looking and then perished in the fruitless search.  And now Johnny Coombs was telling them that their father had been one of that incredible few.  \"You really think Dad hit a bonanza lode out there?\"  \"That's what I said.\"  \"Did you see it with your own eyes?\"  \"No.\"  \"You weren't even out there with him!\"  \"No.\"  \"Then why are you so sure he found something?\"  \"Because he told me so,\" Johnny Coombs said quietly.  The boys looked at each other. \"He actually _said_ he'd found a rich lode?\" Tom asked eagerly.  \"Not exactly,\" Johnny said. \"Matter of fact, he never actually told me _what_ he'd found. He needed somebody to sign aboard the _Scavenger_ with him in order to get a clearance to blast off, but he never did plan to take me out there with him. 'I can't take you now, Johnny,' he told me. 'I've found something out there, but I've got to work it alone for a while.' I asked him what he'd found, and he just gave me that funny little grin of his and said, 'Never mind what it is, it's big enough for both of us. You just keep your mouth shut, and you'll find out soon enough.' And then he wouldn't say another word until we were homing in on the shuttle ship to drop me off.\"  Johnny finished his coffee and pushed the cup aside. \"I knew he wasn't joking. He was excited, and I think he was scared, too. Just before I left him, he said, 'There's one other thing, Johnny. Things might not work out quite the way I figure them, and if they don't ... make sure the twins know what I've told you.' I told him I would, and headed back. That was the last I heard from him until the Patrol ship found him floating in space with a torn-open suit and a ruined scooter floating a few miles away.\"  \"Do you think that Jupiter Equilateral knew Dad had found something?\" Tom asked.  \"Who knows? I'm sure that _he_ never told them, but it's awful hard to keep a secret like that, and they sound awful eager to buy that rig,\" Johnny Coombs said.  \"Yes, and it doesn't make sense. I mean, if they were responsible for Dad's accident, why didn't they just check in for him on schedule and then quietly bring in their rig to jump the claim?\"  \"Maybe they couldn't find it,\" Johnny said. \"If they'd killed your dad, they wouldn't have dared hang around very long right then. Even if they'd kept the signal going, a Patrol ship might have come into the region any time. And if a U.N. Patrol ship ever caught them working a dead man's claim without reporting the dead man, the suit would really start to leak.\" Johnny shook his head. \"Remember, your Dad had a dozen claims out there. They might have had to scout the whole works to find the right one. Much easier to do it out in the open, with your signatures on a claim transfer. But one thing is sure ... if they _knew_ what Roger found out there, and where it was, Tawney would never be offering you triple price for the rig.\"  \"Then whatever Dad found is still out there,\" Tom said.  \"I'd bet my last dime on it.\"  \"There might even be something to show that the accident wasn't an accident,\" Tom went on. \"Something even the Major would have to admit was evidence.\"  Johnny Coombs pursed his lips, looking up at Tom. \"Might be,\" he conceded.  \"Well, what are we waiting for? We turned Tawney's offer down ... he might be sending a crew out to jump the claim right now.\"  \"If he hasn't already,\" Johnny said.  \"Then we've got to get out there.\"  Johnny turned to Greg. \"You could pilot us out and handle the navigation, and as for Tom....\"  \"As for Tom, he could get sick all over the place and keep us busy just taking care of him,\" Greg said sourly. \"You and me, yes. Not Tom. You don't know that boy in a spaceship.\"  Tom started to his feet, glaring at his brother. \"That's got nothing to do with it....\"  \"It's true, isn't it? You'd be a big help out there.\"  Johnny looked at Tom. \"You always get sick in free fall?\"  \"Look, let's be reasonable,\" Greg said. \"You'd just be in the way. There are plenty of things you could do right here, and Johnny and I could handle the rig alone....\"  Tom faced his brother angrily. \"If you think I'm going to stay here and keep myself company, you're crazy,\" he said. \"This is one show you're not going to run, so just quit trying. If you go out there, I go.\"  Greg shrugged. \"Okay, Twin. It's your stomach, not mine.\"  \"Then let me worry about it.\"  \"I hope,\" Johnny said, \"that that's the worst we have to worry about. Let's get started planning.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Time was the factor uppermost in their minds. They knew that even under the best of conditions, it could take weeks to outfit and prepare for a run out to the Belt. A ship had to be leased and fueled; there were supplies to lay in. There was the problem of clearance to take care of, claims to be verified and spotted, orbit coordinates to be computed and checked ... a thousand details to be dealt with, anyone of which might delay embarkation from an hour to a day or more.  It was not surprising that Tom and Greg were dubious when Johnny told them they could be ready to clear ground in less than twenty-four hours. Even knowing that Merrill Tawney might already have a mining crew at work on Roger Hunter's claims, they could not believe that the red tape of preparation and clearance could be cut away so swiftly.  They underestimated Johnny Coombs.  Six hours after he left them, he was back with a signed lease giving them the use of a scout-ship and fuel to take them out to the Belt and"]]]
