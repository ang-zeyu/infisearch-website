It had gold patterns on the brown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists of them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too quickly.  \"I must look at this one,\" Lionel said, for on the back in big letters he read: _The Book of Beasts_.  The Chancellor said, \"Don't be a silly little King.\"  But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page, and there was a beautiful Butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive.  \"There,\" said Lionel, \"Isn't that lovely? Why--\"  But as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings on the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window.  \"Well!\" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, \"that's magic, that is.\"  But before he had spoken, the King had turned the next page, and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him. Under him was written, \"Blue Bird of Paradise,\" and while the King gazed enchanted at the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book.  Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it up on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high shelf. And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said: \"You're a naughty, disobedient little King!\" and was very angry indeed.  \"I don't see that I've done any harm,\" said Lionel. He hated being shaken, as all boys do; he would much rather have been slapped.  \"No harm?\" said the Chancellor. \"Ah--but what do you know about it? That's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next page--a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or something like that.\"  \"Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you,\" said Lionel. \"Come, let's kiss and be friends.\" So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses while the Chancellor went to add up his accounts.  But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book, and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got _The Book of Beasts_.  He took it outside to the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as day, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with \"Butterfly\" and \"Blue Bird of Paradise\" underneath, and then he turned the next page. There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and under it was written \"Dragon.\" The Dragon did not move, and the King shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed.  But the next day he wanted another look, so he took the book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by itself at the picture with \"Dragon\" underneath, and the sun shone full on the page. And then, quite suddenly, a great Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew away across the garden to the far hills, and Lionel was left with the empty page before him, for the page was quite empty except for the green palm tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red where the paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon.  And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it. He had not been King twenty-four hours, and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry his faithful subjects' lives out. And they had been saving up so long to buy him a crown, and everything!  Lionel began to cry.  [Illustration: \"The dragon flew away across the garden.\" _See page 8._]  The Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse all came running to see what was the matter. And when they saw the book they understood, and the Chancellor said: \"You naughty little King! Put him to bed, Nurse, and let him think over what he's done.\"  \"Perhaps, my Lord,\" said the Prime Minister, \"we'd better first find out just exactly what he has done.\"  Then Lionel, in floods of tears, said: \"It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me!\"  But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of than forgiving Lionel. They hurried off to consult the police and see what could be done. Everyone did what they could. They sat on committees and stood on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up in the hills, and there was nothing more to be done. The faithful Nurse, meanwhile, did not neglect her duty. Perhaps she did more than anyone else, for she slapped the King and put him to bed without his tea, and when it got dark she would not give him a candle to read by.  \"You are a naughty little King,\" she said, \"and nobody will love you.\"  Next day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more poetic of Lionel's subjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green trees quite plainly. So Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne and said he wanted to make some laws.  And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor and the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionel's private judgement, and might even slap him and send him to bed, the minute he got on his throne and set his crown on his head, he became infallible--which means that everything he said was right, and that he couldn't possibly make a mistake. So when he said: \"There is to be a law forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere\"--he had the support of at least half of his subjects, and the other half--the grown-up half--pretended to think he was quite right.  Then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat. And this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much.  And when several other nice new laws were made and written down he went home and made mud-houses and was very happy. And he said to his Nurse: \"People will love me now I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for them.\"  But Nurse said: \"Don't count your chickens, my dear. You haven't seen the last of that Dragon yet.\"  Now, the next day was Saturday. And in the afternoon the Dragon suddenly swooped down upon the common in all his hideous redness, and carried off the Soccer Players, umpires, goal-posts, ball, and all.  Then the people were very angry indeed, and they said: \"We might as well be a Republic. After saving up all these years to get his crown, and everything!\"  And wise people shook their heads and foretold a decline in the National Love of Sport. And, indeed, soccer was not at all popular for some time afterward.  Lionel did his best to be a good King during the week, and the people were beginning to forgive him for letting the Dragon out of the book. \"After all,\" they said, \"soccer is a dangerous game, and perhaps it is wise to discourage it.\"  Popular opinion held that the Soccer Players, being tough and hard, had disagreed with the Dragon so much that he had gone away to some place where they only play cats' cradle and games that do not make you hard and tough.  All the same, Parliament met on the Saturday afternoon, a convenient time, for most of the Members would be free to attend, to consider the Dragon. But unfortunately the Dragon, who had only been asleep, woke up because it was Saturday, and he considered the Parliament, and afterwards there were not any Members left, so they tried to make a new Parliament, but being a member of Parliament had somehow grown as unpopular as soccer playing, and no one would consent to be elected, so they had to do without a Parliament. When the next Saturday came around everyone was a little nervous, but the Red Dragon was pretty quiet that day and only ate an Orphanage.  Lionel was very, very unhappy. He felt that it was his disobedience that had brought this trouble on the Parliament and the Orphanage and the Soccer Players, and he felt that it was his duty to try and do something. The question was, what?  The Blue Bird that had come out of the book used to sing very nicely in the Palace rose garden, and the Butterfly was very tame, and would perch on his shoulder when he walked among the tall lilies: so Lionel saw that all the creatures in _The Book of Beasts_ could not be wicked, like the Dragon, and he thought: \"Suppose I could get another beast out who would fight the Dragon?\"  So he took _The Book of Beasts_ out into the rose garden and opened the page next to the one where the Dragon had been just a tiny bit to see what the name was. He could only see \"cora,\" but he felt the middle of the page swelling up thick with the creature that was trying to come out, and it was only by putting the book down and sitting on it suddenly, very hard, that he managed to get it shut. Then he fastened the clasps with the rubies and turquoises in them and sent for the Chancellor, who had been ill since Saturday, and so had not been eaten with the rest of the Parliament, and he said: \"What animal ends in 'cora'?\"  The Chancellor answered: \"The Manticora, of course.\"  \"What is he like?\" asked the King.  \"He is the sworn foe of Dragons,\" said the Chancellor. \"He drinks their blood. He is yellow, with the body of a lion and the face of a man. I wish we had a few Manticoras here now. But the last died hundreds of years ago--worse luck!\"  Then the King ran and opened the book at the page that had \"cora\" on it, and there was the picture--Manticora, all yellow, with a lion's body and a man's face, just as the Chancellor had said. And under the picture was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23661"],["title","The Book of Dragons (#2)"],["body","ten, \"Manticora.\"  In a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the book, rubbing its eyes with its hands and mewing piteously. It seemed very stupid, and when Lionel gave it a push and said, \"Go along and fight the Dragon, do,\" it put its tail between its legs and fairly ran away. It went and hid behind the Town Hall, and at night when the people were asleep it went around and ate all the pussy-cats in the town. And then it mewed more than ever. And on the Saturday morning, when people were a little timid about going out, because the Dragon had no regular hour for calling, the Manticora went up and down the streets and drank all the milk that was left in the cans at the doors for people's teas, and it ate the cans as well.  And just when it had finished the very last little halfpenny worth, which was short measure, because the milkman's nerves were quite upset, the Red Dragon came down the street looking for the Manticora. It edged off when it saw him coming, for it was not at all the Dragon-fighting kind; and, seeing no other door open, the poor, hunted creature took refuge in the General Post Office, and there the Dragon found it, trying to conceal itself among the ten o'clock mail. The Dragon fell on the Manticora at once, and the mail was no defense. The mewings were heard all over the town. All the kitties and the milk the Manticora had had seemed to have strengthened its mew wonderfully. Then there was a sad silence, and presently the people whose windows looked that way saw the Dragon come walking down the steps of the General Post Office spitting fire and smoke, together with tufts of Manticora fur, and the fragments of the registered letters. Things were growing very serious. However popular the King might become during the week, the Dragon was sure to do something on Saturday to upset the people's loyalty.  [Illustration \"The Manticora took refuge in the General Post Office.\" _See page 13._]  The Dragon was a perfect nuisance for the whole of Saturday, except during the hour of noon, and then he had to rest under a tree or he would have caught fire from the heat of the sun. You see, he was very hot to begin with.  At last came a Saturday when the Dragon actually walked into the Royal nursery and carried off the King's own pet Rocking Horse. Then the King cried for six days, and on the seventh he was so tired that he had to stop. He heard the Blue Bird singing among the roses and saw the Butterfly fluttering among the lilies, and he said: \"Nurse, wipe my face, please. I am not going to cry any more.\"  Nurse washed his face, and told him not to be a silly little King. \"Crying,\" said she, \"never did anyone any good yet.\"  \"I don't know,\" said the little King, \"I seem to see better, and to hear better now that I've cried for a week. Now, Nurse, dear, I know I'm right, so kiss me in case I never come back. I _must_ try to see if I can't save the people.\"  \"Well, if you must, you must,\" said Nurse, \"but don't tear your clothes or get your feet wet.\"  So off he went.  The Blue Bird sang more sweetly than ever, and the Butterfly shone more brightly, as Lionel once more carried _The Book of Beasts_ out into the rose garden, and opened it--very quickly, so that he might not be afraid and change his mind. The book fell open wide, almost in the middle, and there was written at the bottom of the page, \"Hippogriff,\" and before Lionel had time to see what the picture was, there was a fluttering of great wings and a stamping of hoofs, and a sweet, soft, friendly neighing; and there came out of the book a beautiful white horse with a long, long, white mane and a long, long, white tail, and he had great wings like swan's wings, and the softest, kindest eyes in the world, and he stood there among the roses.  The Hippogriff rubbed its silky-soft, milky white nose against the little King's shoulder, and the little King thought: \"But for the wings you are very like my poor, dear lost Rocking Horse.\" And the Blue Bird's song was very loud and sweet.  Then suddenly the King saw coming through the sky the great straggling, sprawling, wicked shape of the Red Dragon. And he knew at once what he must do. He caught up _The Book of Beasts_ and jumped on the back of the gentle, beautiful Hippogriff, and leaning down he whispered in the sharp, white ear: \"Fly, dear Hippogriff, fly your very fastest to the Pebbly Waste.\"  And when the Dragon saw them start, he turned and flew after them, with his great wings flapping like clouds at sunset, and the Hippogriff's wide wings were snowy as clouds at moonrise.  When the people in the town saw the Dragon fly off after the Hippogriff and the King they all came out of their houses to look, and when they saw the two disappear they made up their minds to the worst, and began to think what they would wear for Court mourning.  But the Dragon could not catch the Hippogriff. The red wings were bigger than the white ones, but they were not so strong, and so the white-winged horse flew away and away and away, with the Dragon pursuing, till he reached the very middle of the Pebbly Waste.  Now, the Pebbly Waste is just like the parts of the seaside where there is no sand--all round, loose, shifting stones, and there is no grass there and no tree within a hundred miles of it.  Lionel jumped off the white horse's back in the very middle of the Pebbly Waste, and he hurriedly unclasped _The Book of Beasts_ and laid it open on the pebbles. Then he clattered among the pebbles in his haste to get back on to his white horse, and had just jumped on when up came the Dragon. He was flying very feebly, and looking around everywhere for a tree, for it was just on the stroke of twelve, the sun was shining like a gold guinea in the blue sky, and there was not a tree for a hundred miles.  The white-winged horse flew around and around the Dragon as he writhed on the dry pebbles. He was getting very hot: indeed, parts of him even had begun to smoke. He knew that he must certainly catch fire in another minute unless he could get under a tree. He made a snatch with his red claws at the King and Hippogriff, but he was too feeble to reach them, and besides, he did not dare to overexert himself for fear he should get any hotter.  It was then that he saw _The Book of Beasts_ lying on the pebbles, open at the page with \"Dragon\" written at the bottom. He looked and he hesitated, and he looked again, and then, with one last squirm of rage, the Dragon wriggled himself back into the picture and sat down under the palm tree, and the page was a little singed as he went in.  As soon as Lionel saw that the Dragon had really been obliged to go and sit under his own palm tree because it was the only tree there, he jumped off his horse and shut the book with a bang.  \"Oh, hurrah!\" he cried. \"Now we really have done it.\"  And he clasped the book very tightly with the turquoise and ruby clasps.  \"Oh, my precious Hippogriff,\" he cried. \"You are the bravest, dearest, most beautiful--\"  \"Hush,\" whispered the Hippogriff modestly. \"Don't you see that we are not alone?\"  And indeed there was quite a crowd round them on the Pebbly Waste: the Prime Minister and the Parliament and the Soccer Players and the Orphanage and the Manticora and the Rocking Horse, and indeed everyone who had been eaten by the Dragon. You see, it was impossible for the Dragon to take them into the book with him--it was a tight fit even for one Dragon--so, of course, he had to leave them outside.         *       *       *       *       *  They all got home somehow, and all lived happy ever after.  When the King asked the Manticora where he would like to live he begged to be allowed to go back into the book. \"I do not care for public life,\" he said.  Of course he knew his way onto his own page, so there was no danger of his opening the book at the wrong page and letting out a Dragon or anything. So he got back into his picture and has never come out since: That is why you will never see a Manticora as long as you live, except in a picture-book. And of course he left the kitties outside, because there was no room for them in the book--and the milk cans too.  Then the Rocking Horse begged to be allowed to go and live on the Hippogriff's page of the book. \"I should like,\" he said, \"to live somewhere where Dragons can't get at me.\"  So the beautiful, white-winged Hippogriff showed him the way in, and there he stayed till the King had him taken out for his great-great-great-great-grandchildren to play with.  As for the Hippogriff, he accepted the position of the King's Own Rocking Horse--a situation left vacant by the retirement of the wooden one. And the Blue Bird and the Butterfly sing and flutter among the lilies and roses of the Palace garden to this very day.  [Illustration: UNCLE JAMES OR THE PURPLE STRANGER]     II. Uncle James, or The Purple Stranger   The Princess and the gardener's boy were playing in the backyard.  \"What will you do when you grow up, Princess?\" asked the gardener's boy.  \"I should like to marry you, Tom,\" said the Princess. \"Would you mind?\"  \"No,\" said the gardener's boy. \"I shouldn't mind much. I'll marry you if you like--if I have time.\"  For the gardener's boy meant, as soon as he was grown up, to be a general and a poet and a Prime Minister and an admiral and a civil engineer. Meanwhile, he was top of all his classes at school, and tip-top of the geography class.  As for the Princess Mary Ann, she was a very good little girl, and everyone loved her. She was always kind and polite, even to her Uncle James and to other people whom she did not like very much; and though she was not very clever, for a Princess, she always tried to do her lessons. Even if you know perfectly well that you can't do your lessons, you may as well try, and sometimes you find that by some fortunate accident they really _are_ done. Then the Princess had a truly good heart: She was always kind to her pets. She never slapped her hippopotamus when it broke her dolls"]]]
