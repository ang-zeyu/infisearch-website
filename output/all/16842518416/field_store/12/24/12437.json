It's not the place of a new girl to show off in this way, and you'll gain nothing by it. I am responsible for St. Chad's, and I don't mean to have this kind of nonsense going on there; so please understand, Honor Fitzgerald, that if you give any more trouble, you may expect to find yourself thoroughly well sat upon!\"     CHAPTER IV  Janie's Charge   The four-leaved shamrock having so far belied its reputation, and brought bad luck instead of good upon its wearer, Honor put it away in her drawer, with the resolve not to test its powers again until she was back in her own Emerald Isle, where, perhaps, it could exercise its magic more freely than in the land of the stranger.  Her first day at school was satisfactory, in spite of its bad beginning. She took her place in her new class, and made the acquaintance of Miss Farrar, her Form mistress, and all the seventeen girls who composed the Lower Third Form.  After the quiet and solitude of Kilmore Castle, to be at Chessington College seemed like plunging into the world. It was almost bewildering to meet so many companions, all of whom were busily occupied with employments into which she had not yet been initiated. It was an especially fresh experience for Honor to belong to a class, instead of learning from a private governess, and she much appreciated the change. It interested her to watch the faces of her schoolfellows, and to listen to their recitations, or their replies to Miss Farrar's questions. The strict discipline of the place astonished her: the ready answers, the total lack of whispering, the way in which each girl sat straight at her desk, giving her whole attention to the subject in hand; the prompt obedience, even the orderly manner of filing out of the room for lunch, all were as unusual as they were amazing to one who had hitherto behaved as she liked during lessons. She felt for the first time that she was a unit in a large community, and began to have some dim perception of that esprit de corps to which Miss Cavendish had referred during their interview in the study.  In spite of her previous laziness and neglect of work, Honor was a very bright girl, and she contrived even in that first morning to satisfy Miss Farrar that she was capable of doing well if she wished. Perhaps, after all, the four-leaved shamrock had sent her a little luck, for she happened to remember a date which the rest of the Form had forgotten, and won corresponding credit in consequence. When one o'clock arrived she arranged her new textbooks and notebooks in the desk that had been allotted to her next to Lettice Talbot.  \"Did you get into a fearful scrape with Miss Cavendish, Paddy?\" whispered the latter eagerly. \"Do tell me about it!\"  But Honor pursed up her mouth and looked inscrutable. She was unwilling to divulge what had passed in the study, and Lettice's curiosity had perforce to go unsatisfied.  On her arrival at St. Chad's Honor had been given a spare cubicle in the bedroom occupied by the Talbots and Pauline Reynolds. On the following afternoon, however, Miss Maitland sent for Janie Henderson, a girl of nearly sixteen, and informed her that a fresh arrangement had been made.  \"I am going to put you and Honor Fitzgerald together in the room over the porch,\" she said. \"I hope that you will get on nicely, and become friends. I want you, Janie, to have a good influence over Honor, and help her to keep school rules. She does not yet know our St. Chad's standards, and has very much to learn. I give her into your charge because I am sure you are conscientious, and will try your best to make her wish to improve and turn out a worthy Chaddite. You may carry your things into your new quarters during recreation-time.\"  \"Yes, Miss Maitland,\" answered Janie, with due respect. She dared not dispute the mistress's orders, but inwardly she was anything but pleased. She did not wish to leave her present cubicle, and looked with dismay at the prospect of having to share a bedroom with this wild Irish girl, towards whom as yet she certainly felt no attraction.  Janie Henderson had a painfully shy and reserved disposition. Hitherto she had made no friends, invited no confidences, and \"kept herself to herself\" at St. Chad's. She was seldom seen walking with a companion, and during recreation generally buried herself in a book. Slight, pale, and narrow-chested, her constitution was not robust; and though a year and a half at Chessington College had already worked a wonderful improvement, she was still far below the ordinary average of good health. She was a quiet, mouse-like girl, who seldom obtruded herself, or took any prominent part in the life of St. Chad's--a girl who was continually in the background, and passed almost unnoticed among her schoolfellows. She had little self-confidence and a sensitive dread of being laughed at, so for this reason she rarely offered a suggestion, or an opinion, unless invited. She often felt lonely at school, but her shyness prevented her from making advances, and so far nobody had offered her even the elements of friendship. It sometimes hurt her to be thus entirely ignored and left out, but she had grown accustomed to it, and, shutting herself up in her shell, she followed the motto of the Miller of Dee:      \"I care for nobody, no, not I,     Since nobody cares for me.\"  She was obliged to share in the daily games, which were compulsory for all; but she never joined in the voluntary ones unless she were specially asked to do so, to make up a side, and then she played with an utter lack of enthusiasm. \"Moonie\", as the girls called her, was a bookworm pure and simple. She had read almost every volume in the school library; it did not matter whether it were biography, travels, poetry, essays, or fiction, she would devour any literature that came her way. She lived in an imaginary world, peopled by heroes and heroines of romance, who often seemed more real to her than her schoolmates, and certainly twice as interesting. Half the time she went about in a dream, and even during lesson hours she would let her thoughts drift far away to some exciting incident in a story, or some mental picture of her own. It appeared as if Miss Maitland could not have picked out two more opposite and unsuitable girls to share a bedroom than Honor Fitzgerald and Janie Henderson; but she had good reasons for her choice. Not only did she hope that Janie's sober ways would steady Honor, but she also thought that Honor's high spirits would have a leavening effect upon Janie, who was sadly in need of stirring up.  \"I wish I could shake the pair in a bag!\" she confided to a fellow-teacher. \"It would be of the greatest advantage to both.\"  There was at least one compensation to Janie for being obliged to change her quarters. No. 8, the room over the porch, was a special sanctum, much coveted by all the other Chaddites. It was arranged to accommodate only two, instead of four, and was the beau-ideal of every pair of chums. It had a French window opening out on to a tiny balcony, and, having been originally intended for one of the mistresses, was furnished rather more luxuriously than the rest of the bedrooms. There was a handsome wall-paper, a full-length mirror in the wardrobe, a comfortable basket-chair, and also what appealed particularly to Janie--a large and inviting bookcase, with glass doors. She conducted her removal, therefore, with less dissatisfaction than she had at first anticipated.  \"I call you lucky,\" declared Lettice Talbot. \"I only wish I could go instead. Everyone on our landing is envying you. I shall be rather sorry to lose Paddy--I think she's a joke.\"  \"Especially as we're to have Flossie Taylor instead,\" said Pauline Reynolds. \"It's a poor exchange. I can't stand Flossie; she gives herself airs.\"  \"She needn't put them on with us,\" observed Maisie. \"I've had a quarrel with her already. She was actually trying to make Lettice pick up her balls for her at tennis!\"  \"Lettice always picks up yours,\" suggested Pauline.  \"That's a totally different matter,\" declared Maisie.  \"I wish Miss Maitland would have let Flossie join the Hammond-Smiths,\" said Lettice. \"I can't imagine why she is making such changes. Oh, here's Honor! Do you know, Paddy, you have got notice to quit?--in fact, you're going to be evicted from No. 13.\"  Honor had already been informed of the fact by the house-mistress herself. She appeared to take the news with the utmost sangfroid.  \"I don't care in the least which room I have,\" she replied. \"All I bargain for is a room-mate who doesn't use 'cold pig' in the mornings. I haven't forgotten your wet sponge.\"  \"You ungrateful Paddy! It was for your good.\"  \"If you call me Paddy I shall call you Salad!\"  \"You can if you like. It's rather a pretty name, and has a juicy, succulent sound about it.\"  \"Make haste, Honor, and clear your drawers,\" grunted Maisie. \"Here's Flossie Taylor coming down the passage with her arms full of under-linen.\"  No. 8, like all other bedrooms at St. Chad's, was divided by a curtain that could be drawn at pleasure. At present, however, this was pulled aside for the mutual convenience of the occupants of both cubicles. To Janie the burning question to be decided was the possession of the bookcase. She tried to imagine that it was nearer her bed than Honor's, but justice forced her to come to the conclusion that it stood exactly in the middle, between the two. With heroic self-denial she offered her companion the first choice of its shelves before she put away her own little library.  \"But I haven't brought any books with me,\" declared Honor. \"You're welcome to the bookcase, so far as I'm concerned. We can take turns at this luxury,\" sinking into the basket-chair.  \"Don't you ever read?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24025"],["title","The New Girl at St. Chad's: A Story of School Life (#8)"],["body","  \"Very seldom.\"  Janie went on arranging her volumes in silence, the poets on the top shelf, by the side of her edition of Scott's novels, and the miscellaneous authors below. She touched each book tenderly, as though it were an old and dear friend, opening one occasionally to glance at a favourite passage; and she became so absorbed in her occupation that she utterly forgot Honor's presence.  \"There! I've stowed away all my possessions,\" remarked the latter at last. \"I don't know whether Miss Maitland judges a room by a tidy bookcase. She said she was coming up presently, to see if we had put our things straight.\"  Janie started guiltily. She, who was expected to be the mentor and to keep her companion up to the mark, was certainly the defaulter in this instance. Her bed and the chairs were strewn with various articles, and nothing seemed as yet in its right place.  \"I couldn't help dipping into that book,\" she confessed. \"It's a collection of old Irish fairy tales and legends. It was given me yesterday, before I left home, and I've scarcely had time even to look at it.\"  \"Are they nice?\"  \"Lovely, to judge by the one I've just sampled!\"  \"Then do tell it to me! I hate reading, but I'm an absolute baby for loving to be told old tales.\"  \"I? Oh, I couldn't!\" exclaimed Janie.  \"Yes, you can--while I'm helping you to put all these things into your drawers. Do, mavourneen! I want to hear the Irish story.\"  When Honor's grey eyes looked pleadingly from under their long, dark lashes, and a soft blarney crept into her voice, there were few people who could resist her. Janie flushed pink; she was so seldom asked to do anything for anybody! She had no natural gift for narrative, but she made an effort.  \"There was once an Irishman called Murtagh O'Neil,\" she began, \"and he was walking over London Bridge, with a hazel staff in his hand, when an Englishman met him and told him that the stick he carried grew on a spot under which were hidden great treasures. The Englishman was a wizard, and he promised that if Murtagh would go with him to Ireland, and show him the place, he would gain as much gold as he could carry. Murtagh consented, so they went over to Bronbhearg, in Kerry, where there was a big green mound; and there they dug up the hazel tree on which the staff had grown. Under it they found a broad, flat stone, and this covered the entrance to a cavern where thousands of warriors lay in a circle, sleeping beside their shields, with their swords clasped in their hands. Their arms were so brightly polished that they illuminated the whole cave; and one of them had a shield that outshone the rest, and a crown of gold on his head. In the centre of the cave hung a bell, which the wizard told Murtagh to beware of touching; but, if at any time he did so, and one of the warriors were to ask: 'Is it day?' he was to answer without hesitation: 'No, sleep thou on!' The two men took as much as they could carry from a heap of gold pieces that lay amidst the warriors, and Murtagh managed accidentally to touch the bell. It rang, and one of the warriors immediately asked: 'Is it day?' when Murtagh answered promptly: 'No, sleep thou on!' The wizard told him that the company he had seen were King Brien Borombe and his knights, who lay asleep ready for the dawn of a new day. When the right time should come the bell would ring loudly, and the warriors would start up and destroy the enemies of Erin, and once more the descendants of the Tuatha di Danan should rule the isle in peace. When Murtagh's treasure was all finished, he went back to the cave and helped himself to more. On his way out he touched the bell, and again it rang; but this time he was not so ready with his answer, and some of the warriors rose up, took the gold from him, beat him, and flung him out of the cave. He never recovered from the beating, but was a cripple to the end of his days.\"  \"And serve him right, too!\" declared Honor. \"Brien Borombe was a great hero of Ireland.\"  \"Yes, there's one of Moore's _Irish Melodies_ that begins: 'Remember the glories of Brien the brave',\" said Janie.  \"Are there any more stories about him in that book?\"  \"I'm not sure, but there are tales about fairy raths and changelings and leprechauns and pookas and banshees, and all kinds of extraordinary creatures.\"  \"Then we'll have one every day, please! I think you're a first-rate story-teller. You're almost as good as old Mary O'Grady. I've often sat by her peat fire and heard about the banshee and the leprechaun; only, she believes in them. I'm so glad I've moved into this bedroom! I like you far better than those girls in No. 13.\"  When Miss Maitland came upstairs to inspect No. 8, she found Honor and Janie already on a more favourable footing than she had dared to hope, the latter chatting with a vivacity that no one at St. Chad's had hitherto imagined she possessed. Once she had broken the ice of her shyness, and had broached her beloved topic of books, Janie had plenty to say; and, as Honor was also in a communicative mood, the pair seemed well started on the high road to friendship.  It was fortunate for Honor that she had found a congenial room-mate, as her first days at Chessington proved rather a time of trial. She was woefully and terribly home-sick. It seemed an absolute uprooting to have been torn away from Kerry, and she considered that nothing in her new surroundings could make amends for the change. Her pride upheld her sufficiently to prevent her from showing any outward signs of misery before the inquisitive eyes of her schoolfellows, but every now and then the yearning for Kilmore would rise with an almost unbearable pain, and she would have to fight hard to keep her self-control. Maisie Talbot, she was sure, would regard home-sickness as \"early Victorian\", and consequently worthy of contempt; and she was determined not to give either Maisie or any of the others an opportunity of laughing at her.  She felt very keenly the confinement and restraint of school life. To be obliged to study lessons and play games at specified hours, all within a certain limited area, seemed an utter contrast to the freedom in which she had hitherto revelled; and she would long for a scamper with Bute and Barney, her two terriers, or a sail with her father down the creek and out into the Atlantic. She would pour enthusiastic descriptions of her home into Janie's ears, until the latter felt she knew Kilmore Castle and its demesne, and the little fishing village, with its peat smoke and its warm-hearted peasants; and the rocks and the moors and the stream, and the green, treacherous bogs, almost as well as Honor herself.  Notwithstanding her former reputation for unsociability, Janie, at the end of three days, had completely lost her heart to this wayward, impulsive daughter of Erin. It was true, Honor was apt to be trying at times. Her gusts of hot temper, petulance, or utter unreasonableness were rather disconcerting to anyone unaccustomed to the Celtic disposition; but they never lasted long, and Janie soon found out that her friend rarely meant what she then said, and was generally particularly lovable after an outburst, with a winsome look on her face and a beguiling, endearing tone in her voice that would have gained forgiveness from a stone.  With the rest of the members of St. Chad's Honor was also on good terms. She could be very amusing and full of racy Irish humour when she liked, and would send the girls into fits of laughter with her quaint sayings and funny stories. Her nickname of \"Paddy Pepper-box\" stuck to her, and she certainly justified it occasionally.  \"She's like a volcano,\" declared Lettice Talbot. \"Sometimes if you tease her she starts with a bang, and lets off steam for five minutes. Then it's all over, and she's quite pleasant again, until next time.\"  \"I'd rather have that than sulking, at any rate,\" said Dorothy Arkwright. \"A storm often clears the air.\"  \"It's not much use chaffing her, either,\" said Madge Summers, \"for she always seems to get the best of it.\"  \"Yes; if she's down one minute she'll bob up again the next, like a cork.\"  Honor's humours were apt to overflow into the region of practical jokes. These were generally played on such genial recipients as Lettice Talbot and Madge Summers, but occasionally she would venture on more dangerous ground. One afternoon, at the end of her first week at Chessington, she was in the dressing-room, changing her shoes in preparation for cricket, when Ruth Latimer interposed.  \"I forgot to tell you, Paddy! Games are off to-day.\"  \"Why?\" asked Honor in astonishment, for the hour and a half in the playing-fields was as strict a part of the college curriculum as the morning lessons.  \"Because it's the Health Testing.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"A kind of medical examination,\" explained Dorothy Arkwright. \"We always have it at the beginning of each term, to make sure that, as Miss Cavendish expresses it, we are 'physically fit for the duties of school life'.\"  \"Oh!\" said Honor, looking rather aghast at the prospect.  \"You needn't pull such a long face, Paddy,\" said Lettice. \"We none of us mind; indeed, we think it's a joke.\"  \"We have a lady doctor, you see,\" said Ruth, \"and she's so jolly, she keeps one laughing all the time.\"  \"What does she do?\"  \"Oh! weighs us, and sounds our lungs, and tests our eyes, and measures our chests.\"  \"You'll have to draw a deep breath, and to put out your tongue, and to let her look at your teeth,\" added Lettice.  \"And if any girl is really very much below standard,\" said Dorothy, \"she is 'turned out to grass'. That means that she only does half-lessons.\"  \"Of course, she has to be rather bad for that,\" remarked Ruth.  \"It's never been my luck yet!\" lamented Lettice.  \"I should think not, with those fat, red cheeks! You couldn't look delicate, however hard you tried.\"  \"It happened to Janie Henderson, though, in her first term. How little did you weigh, Moonie?\"  \"I'm sure I forget,\" returned Janie,"]]]
