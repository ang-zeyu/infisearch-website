The question might yet be asked, Where is the chemist? And this is the fundamental question, which the materialists never attempt to answer, but quietly evade.  The difference between an inorganic and an organic body has been explained by Coleridge clearly enough for our purpose. In the former,--a sheaf of corn, for instance,--the whole is nothing more than a collection of the individual parts; in the latter,--an animal,--the whole is the effect of, or results from, the parts. In the latter case, the whole is every thing, and the parts are comparatively nothing. One of the great effects of life is to keep the parts in subjection to the whole, making them contribute to its support and growth, and thus maintaining the unity of the system. The stomach digests, the lungs inhale air, the heart beats, and the blood circulates; and as the joint effect, or as the common supporter,--it matters not which,--of these operations, _life_ continues, and the animated being is a unit; it has not merely virtual, but essential unity. The reciprocal action of the respiratory, circulating, and nervous systems is absolutely necessary to life. The animal dies, and this unity, this subservience of the parts to the whole, immediately ceases. In the functions of the living body, it may be that the ordinary laws of chemistry are preserved, and that the elements of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen combine and separate according to their ordinary affinities, and in no unusual proportions. But after death, at any rate, quite a different set of chemical laws come into play, and produce a result which is the very opposite of that before effected. There is no longer any unanimity or coöperation; instead of sustaining or building up the animal tissues, the affinities now in operation tear down, destroy, and resolve them into their ultimate elements,--each part following out its own law of destruction or resolution, irrespectively of the others.       \"There is in living organic matter a principle constantly in      action, the operations of which are in accordance with a rational      plan, so that the individual parts which it creates in the body are      adapted to the design of the whole; and this it is which      distinguishes organism. Kant says, 'The cause of the particular      mode of existence of each part of a living body resides in the      whole, while in dead masses each part contains this cause within      itself.' This explains why a mere part separated from an organized      whole generally does not continue to live; why, in fact, an      organized body appears to be one and indivisible. And since the      different parts of an organized body are heterogeneous members of      one whole, and essential to its perfect state, the trunk cannot      live after the loss of one of these parts.\"--_Müller's Physiology_,      Vol. I., p. 19.  The apparent exceptions to this statement--as in the case of the polypes, which multiply by fissiparous generation, or by spontaneous division of their bodies into parts, each part becoming a perfect animal--are only apparent. These creatures, which are low down in the scale of being, exemplify what Mr. Owen calls \"the law of vegetative or irrelative repetition,\" as they have many organs performing the same function, and not related to each other by combination for the performance of a higher function. Thus, a Polygastrian has many assimilative sacs, each performing the office of a stomach irrespective of the rest. In the insect tribe, the respiratory function, instead of being performed by one set of lungs for the whole body, is carried on through a series of minute and highly ramified tubes, which traverse every part of the body, and open to the air by a great number of orifices. In some instances, both respiration and digestion seem to take place over the whole surface of the body; for Trembley found at least one case, in which the animal digested its food equally well, after it had been turned inside out. A number of similar parts being repeated in each segment of the individual, the body can be divided, and the several portions, each still containing some of all the organs essential to the whole, will continue to live separately. The severed parts will even continue to grow, and to develope other organs convenient for individual existence. But most animals, especially the more perfect, do not constitute an aggregate of similar parts united by one trunk, and therefore propagation by division is in them impossible. The ovum, when separated from the parent, is an entire animal only _potentially_; during its development, the essential parts which constitute the _actual_ whole are produced. In the case of the polyps, we have only to suppose that the ovum remains connected with the parent being, till all, or nearly all, its essential parts are produced. It is then shed not as a mere ovum, but as an animal nearly or wholly complete.  Now, all the instances adduced by our author, to show similarity of action in the organic and the inorganic world, are irrelevant. The analogies are not merely imperfect; they are no analogies at all. Crystals increase by the aggregation of new particles on the external surfaces of the parts already formed; there is no consentaneous operation of the parts on the whole. The molecules of crystals are homogeneous throughout, and the several aggregates of these molecules are independent of each other; while organized bodies are composed of parts perfectly dissimilar from each other, but all of which conspire to one end. \"The growth of organized bodies,\" says Müller, \"takes place in all particles of their substance at the same time, while the increase of the mass in inorganic bodies is produced by external apposition.\" Frostwork on the windows may resemble vegetable _forms_; but it has no resemblance whatever to vegetable _life_. Electricity may counterfeit the _action of life_, for a moment, on a particular limb, by causing the muscles to twitch; but it does not counterfeit _life itself_, by causing all the parts again to contribute to the sustentation of the whole. A French chemist, by electric action, may have produced _globules_ in albumen; there is nothing very wonderful in that; any one may blow bubbles in a viscid fluid. The resemblance between these globules and proper germinal vesicles amounts to nothing more than similarity of outward shape; there is no more real resemblance between them than between the oval lump of chalk which farmers sometimes put into a hen's nest, in order to deceive poor Dame Partlet, and the real egg which the hen deposits by the side of it. Certainly, the imponderable agents, heat, light, and electricity, are in some mysterious way _connected with_ life, so as to contribute to its support; there is nothing more in this assertion than in the familiar proposition, that a seed will germinate only under the proper conditions of soil and climate; but that these agents, acting on inorganic matter, ever _create_ or _commence_ life is a pure hypothesis, not supported even by the shadow of a fact.  Having thus shown how weak are the general considerations in favor of the theory, that animated beings may be created out of inorganic matter by mere natural laws, we should proceed to consider the direct evidence adduced to prove that life has actually been produced in this way. Here the whole question is opened respecting the alleged instances of equivocal generation, and we have neither space nor ability to discuss them at length. Those who are curious respecting the question may find a brief summary of the evidence on both sides in a former number of this Journal.[1] We can mention only a few facts and arguments, which show the extreme improbability of the doctrine supported by our author and a few other theorists.  In the first place, it is remarkable, that all the races of animated beings, which are entirely within the range of our powers of observation,--which have such a size and locality that we can study and accurately determine their organization and habits,--are unquestionably produced from parents of their own kind. Only the minute microscopic animals are now supposed to be generated spontaneously; and this alleged fact rests not on direct proof, but only on our inability in certain cases to trace the process of their production in the ordinary way. As many of these animals, in their perfect state, are not more than the twelve thousandth part of an inch in diameter, it is not much to be wondered at, that we should not be able in all cases to discover their ova, or to follow these ova through all their stages of development into the complete being. It is farther remarkable, that these animalcules, when once produced, whether by spontaneous or natural generation, are all found to be provided with the organs or requisite means for continuing their species, and, in fact, for multiplying their number from themselves with astonishing rapidity. As they certainly have children, it seems reasonable to suppose, according to the analogy of all the higher animated tribes, that they also had parents. The ancients supposed, that the worms and insects which appear in decaying organic matter were generated there by the decomposition of the substance, without the previous agency of individuals of the same stock. Every schoolboy is acquainted with Virgil's mode of obtaining a new swarm of bees from the decaying carcass of a heifer. Subsequent researches, made with more care, and perhaps with better instruments of observation, have entirely disproved the hypothesis, and show that the maggots were produced in every case from eggs deposited by flies or other insects, and were afterwards themselves developed into the state of perfect insects. Then it seems reasonable to believe, that the improved observations of future times will clear up the only remaining difficulty, and show how the infusory animalcules also are generated from beings of their own"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24648"],["title","A Theory of Creation: A Review of 'Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation' (#7)"],["body",".  These minute creatures are prolific to a degree that transcends all calculation; and they exist, either in the egg or maturely developed, in inconceivable numbers. A single wheel-animalcule, _Hydatina senta_, which was watched for more than eighteen days, and which lives still longer, is capable of a fourfold increase in twenty-four or thirty hours; a rate of propagation which would afford in ten days a million of beings. From their tenacity of life, extraordinary powers of reproduction, and incalculable numbers, their united influence may be said to be far more important, in all the great operations of nature, than that of the larger and more perfectly developed organisms. They swarm in all the seas, and play an important part in choking up harbours and forming great deposits at the mouths of rivers. The remains of those which have perished form great beds and strata in the crust of the earth. The silicious stone, called Tripoli, is entirely composed of such remains; at Bilin, in Bohemia, there is one stratum of this substance, fourteen feet thick, one cubic inch of which is estimated to contain forty-one thousand millions of individuals. Their extreme tenacity of life is evinced by the fact, that many of them may be entirely desiccated, and preserved in pure sand for several years, after which, on the application of a drop of water, they may be restored to life. In this dried state, M. Doyère exposed some of them to a heat equal to that of boiling water, and afterwards revived them; though, in an active state, if subjected to a much lower temperature, they perish. If, then, the fully developed and mature can resist such powerful extraneous causes of destruction, how much more must the ova possess the power of enduring them without losing their latent life! The following extract from Professor Owen's Lectures shows the bearing of these facts upon the question of equivocal generation.       \"The act of oviparous generation, that sending forth of countless      ova through the fatal laceration or dissolution of the parent's      body, is most commonly observed in the well-fed _Polygastria_,      which crowd together as their little ocean evaporates; and thus      each leaves, by the last act of its life, the means of perpetuating      and diffusing its species by thousands of fertile germs. When the      once thickly tenanted pool is dried up, and its bottom converted      into a layer of dust, these inconceivably minute and light ova will      be raised with the dust by the first puff of wind, diffused through      the atmosphere, and may there remain long suspended; forming,      perhaps, their share of the particles which we see flickering in      the sunbeam, ready to fall into any collection of water, beaten      down by every summer shower into the streams or pools which receive      or may be formed by such showers, and, by virtue of their tenacity      of life, ready to develope themselves wherever they may find the      requisite conditions for their existence.       \"The possibility, or, rather, the high probability, that such is      the design of the oviparous generation of the _Infusoria_, and such      the common mode of the diffusion of their ova, renders the      hypothesis of equivocal generation, which has been so frequently      invoked to explain their origin in new-formed natural or artificial      infusions, quite gratuitous. If organs of generation might, at      first sight, seem superfluous in creatures propagating their kind      by gemmation and spontaneous fission, equivocal generation is      surely still less required to explain the origin of beings so      richly provided with the ordinary and recognized modes of      propagation.\"--pp. 31, 32.  Recent accounts show, that the dust collected from the atmosphere at sea, many miles from land, generally contains some of these dried animalcules and their ova. Many of these germs can be developed only in particular localities, or under certain conditions which are rarely fulfilled. Consequently, if there were but few of them, the species might perish, because those few might not find their appropriate home. But such an accident is guarded against by the vast multiplication of these germs and their wide dispersion; for, unlike all the higher tribes of beings except man, the same species is often found in all regions of the globe. Very few, in comparison with the whole number, may find a proper _nidus_; but these few then propagate with such marvellous rapidity, as fully to replenish, if not to increase, the original stock. Thus they have been enabled, as species, to survive even those destroying causes which exterminated all the higher forms of animals. Several species still exist, which were in being at the time of the cretaceous formation, though all the other animated races belonging to that period have perished. \"These animalcules,\" says Ehrenberg, \"constitute a chain, which, though in the individual it be microscopic, yet in the mass is a mighty one, connecting the organic life of distant ages of the earth.\"  In view of facts like these, we may surely say, that the existence of the infusory animalcules, and even of the entozoa, is conceivable, supposing they could only have been produced by parents of their own kind, and without having recourse to the anomalous and hypothetical doctrine of equivocal generation. We may not be able to trace their line of parentage, for our imperfect vision cannot follow the motes which play in the sunbeam, nor track them from their birth-place to their final home. But we know that they must be deposited in every layer of dust that falls from the atmosphere, that they must be inhaled with every breath which an animal draws, and be swallowed with every morsel and drop of its food. The experiments which seem to prove that living beings may be produced from pure inorganic matter are all explicable on the supposition, that adequate precautions were not taken to exclude every animal and germ capable of development from the substances experimented upon, and from the air which was admitted into the apparatus. On this ground, the experiments of Crosse and Weekes, cited by our author, have been quite generally rejected by scientific men, as hardly deserving of notice. We learn that the former was \"discouraged by the reception of his experiments,\" and \"soon discontinued them\";--with good reason, for it does not appear from our author's account, that he adopted any precautions at all. Mr. Weekes seems to have been a little more cautious, and the consequence was, that he did not observe any appearance of life among the substances experimented upon for \"eleven months,\" at the end of which time we may reasonably suppose, that his precautions ceased to have perfect effect. The only experiment, in which adequate means to guard against causes of error were taken, was that of Professor Schulze, of Berlin, which had a contrary result. We extract Mr. Owen's account of it.       \"He filled a glass flask half full of distilled water, in which      were various animal and vegetable substances: he then closed it      with a good cork, through which were passed two glass tubes, bent      at right angles, the whole being air-tight: it was next placed in a      sand bath, and heated until the water boiled violently. While the      watery vapor was escaping by the glass tubes, the Professor      fastened at each end an apparatus which chemists employ for      collecting carbonic acid: that at the one end was filled with      concentrated sulphuric acid, and the other with a solution of      potash. By means of the boiling heat, it is to be presumed that      every thing living, and all germs in the flask or in the tubes were      destroyed; whilst all access was cut off by the sulphuric acid on      the one side, and by the potash on the other. The apparatus was      then exposed to the influence of summer light and heat; at the same      time, there was placed near it an open vessel, with the same      substances that had been introduced into the flask, and also after      having subjected them to a boiling temperature. In order to renew      constantly the air within the flask, the experimenter sucked with      his mouth several times a day the open end of the apparatus, filled      with the solution of potash, by which process the air entered his      mouth from the flask through the caustic liquid, and the      atmospheric air from without entered the flask through the      sulphuric acid. The air was of course not at all altered in its      composition by passing through the sulphuric acid in the flask; but      all the portions of living matter, or of matter capable of becoming      animated, were taken up by the sulphuric acid and destroyed. From      the 28th of May until the beginning of August, Professor Schulze      continued uninterruptedly the renewal of the air in the flask,      without being able, by the aid of the microscope, to discover any      living animal or vegetable substance; although, during the whole of      the time, observations were made almost daily on the edge of the      liquid; and when, at last, the Professor separated the different      parts of the apparatus, he could not find in the whole liquid the      slightest trace of _Infusoria_ or _Confervæ_, or of mould; but all      three presented themselves in great abundance a few days after he      had left the flask standing open. The vessel which he placed near      the apparatus contained on the following day _Vibriones_ and      _Monads_, to which were soon added larger Polygastric _Infusoria_,      and afterwards _Rotifera_.\"--pp. 32, 33.  For readers who are not familiar with these subjects, it may be well to mention, that the weight of authority is decidedly against this doctrine of spontaneous generation. It is rejected by Müller, who ranks among the first physiologists of Germany; by Ehrenberg, one of the most distinguished"]]]
