She liked helping people ... only she really-but-good helped them!_   The office wasn't very bright or sunny, but that didn't matter. In the first place, if Gloria really wanted sun, she could always get some by tuning in on a mind outside, someone walking the streets of downtown New York. And, in the second place, the weather wasn't important; what mattered was how you felt inside. Gloria took off her beret and crammed it into a drawer of her desk. She sat down, feeling perfectly ready for work, her bright eyes sparkling and her whole twenty-one-year-old body eager for the demands of the day.  It was ten minutes to nine in the morning.  On the desk was a mass of reports and folders. Gloria looked at them and sighed; the cleaning woman, she thought, must have upset everything again.  But neatness was the keystone of good, efficient work in any field. Gloria set to work rearranging everything in a proper order. The job took her nearly twenty minutes and, by the time she was finished, the office was full.  Mr. Fredericksohn hadn't arrived yet, naturally. He always came in around nine-thirty. But all of the case workers were ready for the day's work. Gloria looked around the office at them, beaming. It was good to be able to help people and to know that what you were doing was right.  She remembered wondering how you could be sure you were right about somebody else, if you couldn't read minds. But, then, there were rules to go by, and all of the fine classes and textbooks that a social case worker had to have. If you paid attention, and if you really wanted to help people, Gloria supposed, it was all right. Certainly everything in her own office seemed to run smoothly.  Not that she would ever do anything about another worker, no matter what. Gloria remembered what Mr. Greystone, a teacher of hers had said, a year or so before: \"Never interfere with the case load of another worker. Your sole job is represented by your own case load.\"  That was good advice, Gloria thought. And, anyhow, her assistance didn't seem to be too badly needed, among the others. She had quite enough to do in taking care of her own clients.  And here she was, wasting time! She shook her head and breathed a little sigh, and began on the first folder.  Name: GIRONDE, JOSE R.         *       *       *       *       *  _Name: Wladek, Mrs. Marie Posner._ She was no fool. She knew about the reports they had to make, and the sheets covered with all the details of your very own private life; she had seen them on a desk when she had come to keep her appointment. Mrs. Wladek was her name, and that was how the report would look, with her name all reversed in order right on the top. And underneath that there would be her address and her story, all that she had told the case workers, set right down in black and white for anybody at all to read.  When you were poor, you had no privacy, and that was the truth. Mrs. Wladek shook her head. A poor old woman, that was all that she was, and privacy was a luxury not to be asked for. Who said the United States was different from the old country?  _Cossacks_, she thought. In the old country, one still heard the old stories, the streets paved with gold and the food waiting for such as yourself; oh, the war had not changed that in the least. Now the Voice of America was heard in the old country--she had a letter, smuggled out, from her own second-cousin Marfa, telling her all about the Voice of America--and that was only another trap. They wanted to make you leave your own land and your own country, and come far away to America and to the United States, so that you would have no friends and you would be defenseless.  Then you could not help yourself. Then you had to do what they asked you, because there was no other way to eat. There were no friends to feed you dinners or to allow you room in a good house. No. There was only the case worker with her reports that took the last bit of privacy away from an old woman, and left her with barely enough money to remain alive.  \"Get a job,\" they said. \"Tell your son to get a job. He is young and strong and healthy.\"  Certainly! But the United States is not a place in which to work. The United States will give you money. This fact she had from her uncle Bedrich, who had come to the new country years before, and who had written many letters back to his family before his death in an accident.  Should she, then, work? Should her own son, her own Rudi, be forced to work out his time of youth? Surely a little privacy was a small enough thing to surrender for freedom and ease?  But that they should ask for you to surrender it ... _Cossacks!_  Mrs. Wladek stood up carefully--her old bones creaked, and she could feel them creaking. She looked around the tiny living room, covered with dust. One should have the money to hire a maid. But the case workers had never understood that. Young things, of course they knew nothing of the troubles facing an old woman.  An old woman needed a maid.  She laughed briefly to herself at the idea, and realized at the same time that she had been hiding her own thoughts from herself.  Today was her appointment day, and the new one would be there, blond and young and smiling at her with the innocent face. There was something wrong with the new one; she could see that. In the old country there were stories--  _Are you, Marie Wladek, afraid of a young woman? Does your age count for nothing? Does your experience and knowledge count for nothing?_  And yet, she had to admit to herself that she was afraid, and that she was afraid of giving a name to her fear. Only a fool could mock at the stories told in the old country, and Mrs. Wladek knew of such a fool; he had died with mockery on his lips, but all had known what had killed him.  _Can you not battle a young woman, and win, Marie Wladek?_  And yet the young woman had something strange about her, and Mrs. Wladek remembered the old stories, and thought of witchcraft.  Who could fight witchcraft?  Even when the witch was a young girl without experience, and with an innocent face and blond hair--  Mrs. Wladek looked at the mantel clock she had brought with her across the ocean. It told perfect time; it was as good as everything from the old country. Here in America they had no such clocks. Here everything ran by electricity, and when you touched it there was a shock, which was unnatural.  The old clock told the time: nine-thirty. Appointment hour was approaching. Mrs. Wladek did not want to leave the house. She did not want to face this new case worker.  But, all the same, one had to have money to live.  That they should force an old woman to travel across the city and to speak with a girl, by appointment, solely in order to get the money which should have been hers by right!  Cossacks! Monsters!  _Name:_ GIRONDE, JOSE R.  _Address:_ 1440 Hamilton Street  _Borough:_ New York  _Phone:_ None  _Complaint:_ Client is over fifty, without work for eight months--last worked in October--due to recurrent difficulty regarding back. Sole support wife and wife's sister. One child (Ramon, 27), living on West Coast. Preliminary inquiries fail to locate child.  _Remarks:_ NPH. Examination needed. Is back injury chronic?  There was a great deal of paper work needed, Gloria realized. At first she hadn't liked the paper work at all, but she could see now how necessary it was. After all, everybody wasn't like her; the other workers, she knew, didn't have her particular talent, and they had to write things down for fear they'd forget.  Sometimes Gloria felt very sorry for the other case workers. But she knew they were doing their very best, and they were, after all, helping people. That was the only important thing: to help people, to make them better members of society.  Now, Jose Gironde's back injury was certainly chronic. Gloria tried to remember the medical term for it: it was something to do with a lordosis. She'd paid no attention to that, since she had been trying to fix up the back instead.  But now a doctor had to be called, and a thorough examination had to be given, all so that the records would show what Gloria knew already. A case worker couldn't fill out a medical report; you had to be a doctor to do that.  And it didn't matter, Gloria knew, if you had all the information at your fingertips, and even knew more than the doctor. (Gloria could have cured Jose Gironde's back easily; a doctor couldn't do that.) Examination was the doctor's job.  It was like being a member of a team, Gloria thought.  That felt good.  She got out the list of doctors which all the case workers used, and followed it down with her finger. Dr. Willmarth was free, she knew, on Thursday morning at eleven.  Luckily, Jose Gironde was free at the same hour. She made a note to call the doctor and make an appointment, and to clear the appointment with Jose Gironde, and made a duplicate note on the report sheet.  That would take care of that.  The paper work, after all, wasn't so very hard. All she had to do now was to make the actual calls, and then wait for the written result of the examination. When that had come through, she would be able to recommend Jose Gironde for permanent relief, as was obviously indicated in his case.  The back injury could not be corrected by medical science. And if Gloria were to correct it--  \"Your job as a case worker is clearly defined,\" a teacher had said. \"Meddling in another's province, without the permission of your supervisor, is always"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24397"],["title","Hex (#1)"],["body","alled-for.\"  In other words, Gloria thought, the _status quo_ has to be kept. And that, too, made sense when you thought about it.  She looked up to see Harold Meedy smiling across the room at her. She smiled back, very briefly, and went back to her own work.  \"Interpersonal relationships within the office framework,\" a teacher--Mr. Greystone?--had said, \"are fraught with danger, and should be handled with the greatest care.\"  If Harold Meedy wanted to get acquainted with her, that was his affair. She didn't feel that she could conscientiously encourage him in the slightest. Not only was he a fellow worker, which made the whole situation more complicated than it would ordinarily have been, but he was a small pudgy man with pimples and an earnest expression. He looked as if he would be a bore, and a difficult person to get rid of.  He was.  Gloria just didn't think he was exactly her type.  And if he went on trying, she thought regretfully, she would be forced to do something about it. Of course, Meedy would never know the difference, but even so, Gloria didn't like to do any unnecessary work. Changing someone's mind was a delicate job, and a responsible one, not to be undertaken for a small motive.  Even if the person never knew his mind had been changed at all--         *       *       *       *       *  Mrs. Wladek, in her apartment, shrugged on an old coat and compressed her lips with weariness. Appointment time was near, and a person had to be punctual.  Even when a person was going to see a young girl who was strange and frightening, and who might do--  _Well, don't be a foolish old woman_, Mrs. Wladek told herself. Rudi would have told her that. But Rudi was out somewhere, with a girl or with some of his friends, like a good American boy.  Don't be a foolish old woman, Rudi would have said.  But Mrs. Wladek was frightened.         *       *       *       *       *  It was nearly ten o'clock, Gloria noticed. She did not feel in the least tired; she was still eager and ready for work. She decided she had time for one more folder before the first of her appointments arrived.  She reached out for it and saw Mr. Fredericksohn coming in the door. He smiled at her, a tall, white-haired man with a square face, who radiated enormous efficiency and a certain distant friendliness.  She did not say hello, but merely nodded. Mr. Fredericksohn liked to take the initiative himself, in all relationships.  \"How are we doing today?\" he said, peering over her shoulder.  \"Fine,\" she said happily. \"Just fine.\"  Mr. Fredericksohn grunted. \"I see Mrs. Wladek's on your schedule today.\"  \"That's right,\" she said.  \"Just do what you can,\" he said. \"You've seen her before, haven't you?\"  She nodded. \"Once. Last week.\"  \"She's a--problem,\" he said. Mr. Fredericksohn was always a little chary of saying anything that might be construed as derogatory to a client, even in the privacy of professional conversation.  \"I'm sure we'll be able to work things out,\" Gloria said.  \"Well,\" Mr. Fredericksohn said, and paused. Then he nodded. \"You do what you can,\" he said. His voice sounded doubtful.  She beamed up at him. \"I certainly will,\" she said with enthusiasm.  Mr. Fredericksohn nodded and muttered something, and went on by.  Gloria smiled. Oh, she was going to show Mr. Fredericksohn, all right! He just wasn't sure she could handle Mrs. Wladek--and the old woman certainly did represent a problem. Her folder was full of notations by case worker after case worker. But Gloria's smile broadened just a trifle.  My goodness, everything was going to be all right. She was sure Mr. Fredericksohn would be happy with her work.  Though the important thing wasn't her own success, but the people themselves. If you could help them to be bright, and happy, and successful, then that was the best job in the world.  And she could.  My goodness, yes.         *       *       *       *       *  Mrs. Wladek looked at the door for a long time without opening it. She didn't want to go in--certainly not. But there was her appointment, and money was needed; she had no choice. The cossacks of America had forced her to this pass, and she was an old woman; what could she do? Fight them?  One had to give in.  She reached for the doorknob and turned it and opened the door.  There were all the desks, and the men and women working. And near the far corner, on the left, the girl sat studying a sheet of paper. Mrs. Wladek looked at the blond hair and the pretty face and the slight figure, and shivered.  But she had no choice; she went across the room and when she had almost reached the desk the girl said: \"Good morning, Mrs. Wladek.\"  How had she known? Mrs. Wladek had made no sound in walking to the desk. Yet the girl had known someone was there, and who that someone was, before her head had been raised. Truly, the girl was frightening.  Mrs. Wladek eased herself, feeling her bones creak, into a chair at the side of the desk. She said nothing.  \"How are things going?\" the girl said in her pleasant smooth voice.  \"I am fine,\" Mrs. Wladek said deliberately. She did not inquire about the girl's health. That would show her; that impoliteness would show her what an old woman thought of her!  \"That's good,\" the girl said. \"That's very good. And how is Rudi?\"  \"Rudi is my son,\" Mrs. Wladek said.  \"I know that,\" the girl said, and smiled. \"We met last week, don't you remember?\"  \"I remember you,\" Mrs. Wladek said. Then, grudgingly, she added: \"Rudi is the same. He is fine.\"  \"That's fine,\" the girl said. \"And has he found a job yet?\"  Here it was necessary to lie, Mrs. Wladek knew. One could not say that Rudi did not look for work. One had to say: \"Work is difficult to find. He tries, but there is no job.\"  \"And how about yourself?\" the girl said.  \"I am an old woman,\" Mrs. Wladek said. \"Who would hire an old woman?\"  The girl nodded. \"It's been a long time since your husband died,\" she said.  \"In an accident with an automobile,\" Mrs. Wladek said. \"I remember that time. It is sad to think of.\"  \"And Rudi hasn't found any work in all that time,\" the girl said.  \"He looks hard,\" Mrs. Wladek said earnestly. This was a game that had to be played, she knew, a conversation that started and finished each time she came for an appointment. \"He looks but work is difficult to find,\" she said.  \"I understand,\" the girl said. \"But I'm sure you and Rudi will both find work soon.\" She paused and her eyes closed.  Mrs. Wladek felt something happen.  It was ... she felt ... a stirring, a changing--  She stood up suddenly and the chair clattered, balanced and rocked back upright. \"What are you doing?\"  \"Doing?\" the girl said.  \"I go to look for work,\" Mrs. Wladek said. \"You make me want to look for work!\"  \"That's fine, Mrs. Wladek,\" the girl said. \"That's just fine.\"  \"But I want to look for work!\" Mrs. Wladek said, horrified. \"What do you do to me?\"  The girl only smiled.  Mrs. Wladek spun and ran for the door, her eyes wide; but she collided with a desk and backed off, and then managed to find her way. The door banged behind her.  Gloria sat at her desk smiling, filled with satisfaction. Of course, a reaction like Mrs. Wladek's was only to be expected, but when it was over she would be looking for work.  Gloria released the little doll she had held throughout the interview and let it fall back, out of sight, into her desk drawer. The doll was shaped into a vague female likeness.  She didn't need it now.  Her work was done.  Mrs. Wladek was going to look for work, and that would adjust her to the world. She would be a functioning member of society now, and it would do her a lot of good. Rudi, too--Gloria considered Rudi. There was another doll in the drawer, a male, and after a few seconds she put her hand in the drawer and fished around until she had found it.  She turned it slowly, feeling for the son, until at last she had made contact.  There.  He was talking with some friends; it would not be hard. She concentrated, and at the same time she heard him talking:  \"So look, here's the way I see it. We got the Cobras on our necks, we got to get rid of them, right?\"  Someone said: \"Right, Rudi.\"  \"So if we start a little rumble, very quiet so the cops don't figure what's going on, then we--\"  A silence.  Someone said: \"What's wrong, Rudi?\"  \"I don't know. Something. What am I doing just standing here?\"  And someone said: \"What do you mean?\"  \"I mean I ought to be out getting a job, man. Earning some bread for the old lady. Got to have money, got to have a job.\"  Someone said: \"Hey, Rudi. Wait. What's the hurry?\"  And Rudi had gone.  Gloria dropped the doll and closed the drawer, and sat back, smiling gently. It was wonderful to be able to help people.  It was just wonderful.  _Find work. Find a job._  _Go to the employment agency._  _Start looking for work, right now._  _Get a job._  _It will be nice to have a steady job._  _Nice--_  Somehow, Mrs. Wladek fought off the voices in her mind. It was so easy to succumb to them and to drift into the terrible things they wanted. Mrs. Wladek did not want them at all.  A job, indeed!  But it took effort, all the same, to concentrate on herself instead of the work, the job, the employment agency. It took effort to sit down on a bench in the park, near the building where the case workers were, and plan out the next step.  A witch, certainly. The girl was a witch and she had put a hex on Mrs. Wladek, and that hex had to be removed.  How?  Mrs. Wladek thought first of the old woman in the store.  Certainly a gypsy woman would be able to take off a hex. Mrs. Wladek remembered gypsies from the old country, laughing people with the strange gift, witches themselves but always available for a price--  The gypsy woman.  Mrs. Wladek stood up and began to walk toward the park's exit. She forced her legs to move, creaking, one step at a time, thinking to herself: _The gypsy woman, the gypsy woman, the gypsy woman_--and trying to ignore the voices in her head that"]]]
