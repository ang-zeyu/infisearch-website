He may dislike his neighbors heartily, and snub them in prosperity, but in trouble he is quick with practical assistance. And although often tactless, for tact and extreme honesty are incompatible, he is usually kind. There is often a selfish purpose behind his altruism, his broad charitable organizations. But to individual cases of distress he is generous, unselfish, and sacrificing.  In politics he is individually honest, as a rule, but collectively corrupt. And this strange and disheartening fact is due to lethargy. He is politically indolent, so he allows the few to rule, and this few is too frequently in political life for what it can get and not what it can give. Sins of omission may be grave sins.  Yet he is individually honest in politics, and in most things, and that, partly at least, is because, pretty much overlaid with worldliness, he has a deep religious conviction. But he has a terrible fear of letting anyone know he has it. Indeed, he is shamefaced about all his emotions. He would sooner wear two odd shoes than weep at a funeral.  Really, this article could run on forever. There's that particularly manlike attitude of accusing women of slavishly following the fashions! Funny, isn't it, when you think about it? Do you think a man would wear a striped tie with a morning coat when his haberdasher says others are wearing plain gray? Or a straw hat before the fifteenth of May? Have you ever watched the mental struggle between a dinner suit and evening clothes? Do you suppose that women, realizing that the costume they wore was the ugliest ever devised, would continue wearing it because everyone else did? And then look at men's trousers and derby hats!  It is men who are the slaves, double chained, of fashion. The only comfortable innovation in men's clothes made in a century was when some brave spirit originated the shirtwaist man. Women saw its comfort, adopted and retained the shirtwaist. But the leaders of male fashion dictated that comfort was bad form, and on went all the coats again. Irvin Cobb is undoubtedly going to say that it is just like a woman to wear no flannels in winter, and silk hose, and generally go about half clad. But men are as over-dressed in summer as women are under-dressed in winter.  But in spite of this slavish following of fashion, men are really more rational than women. They have the same mental processes. For that reason they understand each other. Like the village fool who found the lost horse by thinking where he would go if he were a horse, a man knows what another man will do by fancying himself in the same circumstances. And women are called designing because they have fathomed this fundamental simplicity of the male! A woman's emotions and her sensations and her thoughts are all complexes. She doesn't know herself what she is going to do, and is frequently more astounded than anyone else at what she does do. It's a lot harder being a woman than a man.  So--women know men better than men know women, and are rather like the little boy's definition of a friend: \"A friend is a feller who knows all about you, and likes you anyhow.\"  We do like them, dreadfully. Sometimes women have sighed and wondered what the house would be like without overcoats thrown about in the hall, and every closet full of beloved old ragged clothes and shoes, and cigar ashes over things, and wild cries for the ancient hat they gave the gardener last week to weed in. But quite recently the women of this country and a lot of other countries have found out what even temporary absence means. A house without a man in it is as nice and tidy and peaceful and attractive and cheerful as a grave in a cemetery. It is as pleasant as Mark Twain's celebrated combination of rheumatism and St. Vitus dance, and as empty as a penny-in-the-slot chocolate machine in a railway station.  Not so very long ago there was a drawing in one of the magazines. It showed a row of faces, men with hooked noses, with cauliflower ears, with dish-faces, and flat faces, with smallpox scars, with hare lips. And underneath it said: \"Never mind, every one of them is somebody's darling.\"  Women don't really care how their men look. But they want to look up to them--which is a reason I haven't given before for their sex superiority. It is really forced on them! And they want them kind and even a bit patronizing. Also they want them _well_, because a sick man can come the closest thing in the world to biting the hand that feeds him. And loyal, of course, and not too tidy--and to be hungry at meals. And not to be too bitter about going out in the evenings.  And the one thing they do not want is to have their men know how well they understand them. It is one of their pet little-boy conceits, this being misunderstood. It has survived from the time of that early punishment when each and every one of them contemplated running off and going to sea. Most of them still contemplate that running off. They visualize great spaces, and freedom, and tropic isles, and--well, you know. \"Where there ain't no Ten Commandments and a man can raise a thirst.\" (You know, Irvin!)  Yes, they contemplate it every now and then, and then they go home, and put on a fresh collar for dinner, and examine the vegetable garden, and take the children out in the machine for a few minutes' fresh air, and have a pillow fight in the nursery, and--forget the other thing.  Which is exactly like a man.     [1] Will probably forget small attentions to his wife after marriage.

Nourse   The place was dark and damp, and smelled like moldy leaves. Meyerhoff followed the huge, bear-like Altairian guard down the slippery flagstones of the corridor, sniffing the dead, musty air with distaste. He drew his carefully tailored Terran-styled jacket closer about his shoulders, shivering as his eyes avoided the black, yawning cell-holes they were passing. His foot slipped on the slimy flags from time to time, and finally he paused to wipe the caked mud from his trouser leg. \"How much farther is it?\" he shouted angrily.  The guard waved a heavy paw vaguely into the blackness ahead. Quite suddenly the corridor took a sharp bend, and the Altairian stopped, producing a huge key ring from some obscure fold of his hairy hide. \"I still don't see any reason for all the fuss,\" he grumbled in a wounded tone. \"We've treated him like a brother.\"  One of the huge steel doors clicked open. Meyerhoff peered into the blackness, catching a vaguely human outline against the back wall. \"Harry?\" he called sharply.  There was a startled gasp from within, and a skinny, gnarled little man suddenly appeared in the guard's light, like a grotesque, twisted ghost out of the blackness. Wide blue eyes regarded Meyerhoff from beneath uneven black eyebrows, and then the little man's face broke into a crafty grin. \"Paul! So they sent _you_! I knew I could count on it!\" He executed a deep, awkward bow, motioning Meyerhoff into the dark cubicle. \"Not much to offer you,\" he said slyly, \"but it's the best I can do under the circumstances.\"  Meyerhoff scowled, and turned abruptly to the guard. \"We'll have some privacy now, if you please. Interplanetary ruling. And leave us the light.\"  The guard grumbled, and started for the door. \"It's about time you showed up!\" cried the little man in the cell. \"Great day! Lucky they sent you, pal. Why, I've been in here for years--\"  \"Look, Zeckler, the name is Meyerhoff, and I'm not your pal,\" Meyerhoff snapped. \"And you've been here for two weeks, three days, and approximately four hours. You're getting as bad as your gentle guards when it comes to bandying the truth around.\" He peered through the dim light at the gaunt face of the prisoner. Zeckler's face was dark with a week's beard, and his bloodshot eyes belied the cocky grin on his lips. His clothes were smeared and sodden, streaked with great splotches of mud and moss. Meyerhoff's face softened a little. \"So Harry Zeckler's in a jam again,\" he said. \"You _look_ as if they'd treated you like a brother.\"  The little man snorted. \"These overgrown teddy-bears don't know what brotherhood means, nor humanity, either. Bread and water I've been getting, nothing more, and then only if they feel like bringing it down.\" He sank wearily down on the rock bench along the wall. \"I thought you'd never get here! I sent an appeal to the Terran Consulate the first day I was arrested. What happened? I mean, all they had to do was get a man over here, get the extradition papers signed, and provide transportation off the planet for me. Why so much time? I've been sitting here rotting--\" He broke off in mid-sentence and stared at Meyerhoff. \"You _brought_ the papers, didn't you? I mean, we can leave now?\"  Meyerhoff stared at the little man with a mixture of pity and disgust. \"You are a prize fool,\" he said finally. \"Did you know that?\"  Zeckler's eyes widened. \"What do you mean, fool? So I spend a couple of weeks in this pneumonia trap. The deal was worth it! I've got three million credits sitting in the Terran Consulate on Altair V, just waiting for me to walk in and pick them up. Three million credits--do you hear? That's enough to set me up for life!\"  Meyerhoff nodded grimly. \"_If_ you live long enough to walk in and pick them up, that is.\"  \"What do you mean, if?\"  Meyerhoff sank down beside the man, his voice a tense whisper in the musty cell. \"I mean that right now you are practically dead. You may not know it, but you are. You walk into a newly opened planet with your smart little bag of tricks, walk in here with a shaky passport and no permit, with no knowledge of the natives outside of two paragraphs of inaccuracies in the Explorer's Guide, and even then you're not content to come in and sell something legitimate, something the natives might conceivably be able to use. No, nothing so simple for you. You have to pull your usual high-pressure stuff. And this time, buddy, you're paying the piper.\"  \"_You mean I'm not being extradited?_\"  Meyerhoff grinned unpleasantly. \"I mean precisely that. You've committed a crime here--a major crime. The Altairians are sore about it. And the Terran Consulate isn't willing to sell all the trading possibilities here down the river just to get you out of a mess. You're going to stand trial--and these natives are out to get you. Personally, I think they're _going_ to get you.\"  Zeckler stood up shakily. \"You can't believe anything the natives say,\" he said uneasily. \"They're pathological liars. Why, you should see what they tried to sell _me_! You've never seen such a pack of liars as these critters.\" He glanced up at Meyerhoff. \"They'll probably drop a little fine on me and let me go.\"  \"A little fine of one Terran neck.\" Meyerhoff grinned nastily. \"You've committed the most heinous crime these creatures can imagine, and they're going to get you for it if it's the last thing they do. I'm afraid, my friend, that your con-man days are over.\"  Zeckler fished in the other man's pocket, extracted a cigarette, and lighted it with trembling fingers. \"It's bad, then,\" he said finally.  \"It's bad, all right.\"  Some shadow of the sly, elfin grin crept over the little con-man's face. \"Well, at any rate, I'm glad they sent you over,\" he said weakly. \"Nothing like a good lawyer to handle a trial.\"  \"_Lawyer?_ Not me! Oh, no. Sorry, but no thanks.\" Meyerhoff chuckled. \"I'm your advisor, old boy. Nothing else. I'm here to keep you from botching things up still worse for the Trading Commission, that's all. I wouldn't get tangled up in a mess with those creatures for anything!\" He shook his head. \"You're your own lawyer, Mr. Super-salesman. It's all your show. And you'd better get your head out of the sand, or you're going to lose a case like it's never been lost before!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Meyerhoff watched the man's pale face, and shook his head. In a way, he thought, it was a pity to see such a change in the rosy-cheeked, dapper, cocksure little man who had talked his way glibly in and out of more jams than Meyerhoff could count. Trading brought scalpers; it was almost inevitable that where rich and unexploited trading ground was uncovered, it would first fall prey to the fast-trading boys. They spread out from Terra with the first wave of exploration--the slick, fast-talking con-men who could work new territories unfettered by the legal restrictions that soon closed down the more established planets. The first men in were the richest out, and through some curious quirk of the Terrestrial mind, they knew they could count on Terran protection, however crooked and underhand their methods.  But occasionally a situation arose where the civilization and social practices of the alien victims made it unwise to tamper with them. Altair I had been recognized at once by the Trading Commission as a commercial prize of tremendous value, but early reports had warned of the danger of wildcat trading on the little, musty, jungle-like planet with its shaggy, three-eyed inhabitants--warned specifically against the confidence tactics so frequently used--but there was always somebody, Meyerhoff reflected sourly, who just didn't get the word.  Zeckler puffed nervously on his cigarette, his narrow face a study in troubled concentration. \"But I didn't _do_ anything!\" he exploded finally. \"So I pulled an old con game. So what? Why should they get so excited? So I clipped a few thousand credits, pulled a little fast business.\" He shrugged eloquently, spreading his hands. \"Everybody's doing it. They do it to each other without batting an eye. You should _see_ these critters operate on each other. Why, my little scheme was peanuts by comparison.\"  Meyerhoff pulled a pipe from his pocket, and began stuffing the bowl with infinite patience. \"And precisely what sort of con game was it?\" he asked quietly.  Zeckler shrugged again. \"The simplest, tiredest, moldiest old racket that ever made a quick nickel. Remember the old Terran gag about the Brooklyn Bridge? The same thing. Only these critters didn't want bridges. They wanted land--this gooey, slimy swamp they call 'farm land.' So I gave them what they wanted. I just sold them some land.\"  Meyerhoff nodded fiercely. \"You sure did. A hundred square kilos at a swipe. Only you sold the same hundred square kilos to a dozen different natives.\" Suddenly he threw back his hands and roared. \"Of all the things you _shouldn't_ have done--\"  \"But what's a chunk of land?\"  Meyerhoff shook his head hopelessly. \"If you hadn't been so greedy, you'd have found out what a chunk of land was to these natives before you started peddling it. You'd have found out other things about them, too. You'd have learned that in spite of all their bumbling and fussing and squabbling they're not so dull. You'd have found out that they're marsupials, and that two out of five of them get thrown out of their mother's pouch before they're old enough to survive. You'd have realized that they have to start fighting for individual rights almost as soon as they're born. Anything goes, as long as it benefits them as individuals.\"  Meyerhoff grinned at the little man's horrified face. \"Never heard of that, had you? And you've never heard of other things, too. You've probably never heard that there are just too many Altairians here for the food their planet can supply, and their diet is so finicky that they just can't live on anything that doesn't grow here. And consequently, land is the key"]]]
