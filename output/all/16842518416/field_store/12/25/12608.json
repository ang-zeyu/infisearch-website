There will be assembled all the myriads of men who ever lived, a vast multitude! There will be Apostles, prophets, martyrs, and all saints from the beginning of time.  There will be all the good men you ever heard of or knew.  There will be your own kindest and best friends, your pious parents, or brothers, or children.  Now what think you of being put to shame before all these?  You fear the contempt of one small circle of men; what think you of the Saints of God, of St. Mary, of St. Peter and St. Paul, of the ten thousand generations of mankind, being witnesses of your disgrace?  You dread the opinion of those whom you do not love; but what if a father then shrink from a dear son, or the wife, or husband, your earthly companion, then tremble at the sight of you, and feel ashamed of you?  Nay, there is One greater than parents, husbands, or brothers; One of whom you have been ashamed on earth; and what will He, that merciful, but neglected Saviour, think of you then?  Hear His own words:--\"Whosoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words, of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when He shall come in His own glory, and in His Fathers, and of the holy Angels.\"  Then such unhappy men, how will they feel shame at themselves! they will despise and loathe themselves; they will hate and abominate their own folly; they will account themselves brutish and mad, so to have been beguiled by the devil, and to have trifled with the season of mercy.  \"Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth,\" says Daniel, \"shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.\"  Let us, then, rouse ourselves, and turn from man to God; what have we to do with the world, who from our infancy have been put on our journey heavenward?  Take up your cross and follow Christ.  He went through shame far greater than can be yours.  Do you think He felt nothing when He was lifted up on the Cross to public gaze, amid the contempt and barbarous triumphings of His enemies, the Pharisees, Pilate and his Roman guard, Herod and his men of war, and the vast multitude collected from all parts of the world?  They all looked on Him with hatred and insult, yet He endured (we are told), \"despising the shame[4].\"  It is a high privilege to be allowed to be conformed to Christ; St. Paul thought it so, so have all good men.  The whole Church of God, from the days of Christ to the present, has been ever held in shame and contempt by men of this world.  Proud men have reasoned against its Divine origin; crafty men have attempted to degrade it to political purposes: still it has lasted for many centuries; it will last still, through the promised help of God the Holy Ghost; and that same promise which is made to it first as a body, is assuredly made also to every one of us who seeks grace from God through it.  The grace of our Lord and Saviour is pledged to every one of us without measure, to give us all necessary strength and holiness when we pray for it; and Almighty God tells us Himself, \"Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.  For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but My righteousness shall be for ever, and My salvation from generation to generation.\"    [1] Gal. i. 24.  [2] 1 Tim. v. 21.  [3] 1 Cor. iv. 9.  [4] Heb. xii. 2.     SERMON V.  Temporal Advantages.  \"_We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.  And having food and raiment let us be therewith content._\"--1 Tim. vi. 7, 8.   Every age has its own special sins and temptations.  Impatience with their lot, murmuring, grudging, unthankfulness, discontent, are sins common to men at all times, but I suppose one of those sins which belongs to our age more than to another, is desire of a greater portion of worldly goods than God has given us,--ambition and covetousness in one shape or another.  This is an age and country in which, more than in any other, men have the opportunity of what is called rising in life,--of changing from a lower to a higher class of society, of gaining wealth; and upon wealth all things follow,--consideration, credit, influence, power, enjoyment, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.  Since, then, men now-a-days have so often the opportunity of gaining worldly goods which formerly they had not, it is not wonderful they should be tempted to gain them; nor wonderful that when they have gained them, they should set their heart upon them.  And it will often happen, that from coveting them before they are gained, and from making much of them when they are gained, men will be led to take unlawful means, whether to increase them, or not to lose them.  But I am not going so far as to suppose the case of dishonesty, fraud, double-dealing, injustice, or the like: to these St. Paul seems to allude when he goes on to say, \"They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare;\" again, \"The love of money is the root of all evil.\"  But let us confine ourselves to the consideration of the nature itself, and the natural effects, of these worldly things, without extending our view to those further evils to which they may give occasion.  St. Paul says in the text, that we ought to be content with food and raiment; and the wise man says, \"Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me[1].\"  And our Lord would have us \"take no thought for the morrow,\" which surely is a dissuasion from aggrandizing ourselves, accumulating wealth, or aiming at distinction.  And He has taught us when we pray to say, \"Give us this day our _daily_ bread.\"  Yet a great number of persons, I may say, nearly all men, are not content with enough, they are not satisfied with sufficiency; they wish for something more than simplicity, and plainness, and gravity, and modesty, in their mode of living; they like show and splendour, and admiration from the many, and obsequiousness on the part of those who have to do with them, and the ability to do as they will; they like to attract the eye, to be received with consideration and respect, to be heard with deference, to be obeyed with promptitude; they love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats; they like to be well dressed, and to have titles of honour. Now, then, I will attempt to show that these gifts of the world which men seek are not to be reckoned good things; that they are ill suited to our nature and our present state, and are dangerous to us; that it is on the whole best for our prospects of happiness even here, not to say hereafter, that we should be without them.  Now, first, that these worldly advantages, as they are called, are not productive of any great enjoyment even now to the persons possessing them, it does not require many words to prove.  I might indeed maintain, with no slight show of reason, that these things, so far from increasing happiness, are generally the source of much disquietude; that as a person has more wealth, or more power, or more distinction, his cares generally increase, and his time is less his own: thus, in the words of the preacher, \"the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep,\" and, \"in much wisdom is much grief, and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow[2].\"  But however this may be, at least these outward advantages do not increase our happiness.  Let me ask any one who has succeeded in any object of his desire, has he experienced in his success that full, that lasting satisfaction which he anticipated?  Did not some feeling of disappointment, of weariness, of satiety, of disquietude, after a short time, steal over his mind?  I think it did; and if so; what reason has he to suppose that that greater share of reputation, opulence, and influence which he has not, and which he desires, would, if granted him, suffice to make him happy? No; the fact is certain, however slow and unwilling we may be to believe it, none of these things bring the pleasure which we beforehand suppose they will bring.  Watch narrowly the persons who possess them, and you will at length discover the same uneasiness and occasional restlessness which others have; you will find that there is just a something beyond, which they are striving after, or just some one thing which annoys and distresses them.  The good things you admire please for the most part only while they are new; now those who have them are accustomed to them, so they care little for them, and find no alleviation in them of the anxieties and cares which still remain.  It is fine, in prospect and imagination, to be looked up to, admired, applauded, courted, feared, to have a name among men, to rule their opinions or their actions by our word, to create a stir by our movements, while men cry, \"Bow the knee,\" before us; but none knows so well how vain is the world's praise, as he who has it.  And why is this?  It is, in a word, because the soul was made for religious employments and pleasures; and hence, that no temporal blessings, however exalted or refined, can satisfy it.  As well might we attempt to sustain the body on chaff, as to feed and nourish the immortal soul with the pleasures and occupations of the world.  Only thus much, then, shall I say on the point of worldly advantages not bringing present happiness.  But next, let us consider that, on the other hand, they are positively dangerous to our eternal interests.  Many of these things, if they did no other harm, at least are injurious to our souls, by taking up the time which might else be given to religion.  Much intercourse with the world, which eminence and station render a duty, has a tendency to draw off the mind from God, and deaden it to the force of religious motives and considerations.  There is a want of sympathy between much business and calm devotion, great splendour and a simple faith, which will be to no one more painful than to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24258"],["title","The Rubáiyát of a Persian Kitten (#0)"],["body","from scanned images of public domain material from the Google Print project.)

The Rubáiyát of a Persian Kitten       Wake! for the Golden Cat has put to flight     The Mouse of Darkness with his Paw of Light:     Which means, in Plain and simple every-day     Unoriental Speech--The Dawn is bright.  [Illustration]       They say the Early Bird the Worm shall taste.     Then rise, O Kitten! Wherefore, sleeping, waste     The Fruits of Virtue? Quick! the Early Bird     Will soon be on the Flutter--O make haste!  [Illustration]       The Early Bird has gone, and with him ta'en     The Early Worm--Alas! the Moral's plain,     O Senseless Worm! Thus, thus we are repaid     For Early Rising--I shall doze again.  [Illustration]       The Mouse makes merry 'mid the Larder Shelves,     The Bird for Dinner in the Garden delves.     I often wonder what the creatures eat     One half so toothsome as they are Themselves.  [Illustration]       And that Inverted Bowl of Skyblue Delf     That helpless lies upon the Pantry Shelf--     Lift not your eyes to It for help, for It     Is quite as empty as you are yourself.  [Illustration]       The Ball no question makes of Ayes or Noes,     But right or left, as strikes the Kitten, goes;     Yet why, altho' I toss it Far Afield,     It still returneth--Goodness only knows!  [Illustration]       A Secret Presence that my likeness feigns,     And yet, quicksilver-like, eludes my pains--     In vain I look for Him behind the glass;     He is not there, and yet He still remains.  [Illustration]       What out of airy Nothing to invoke     A senseless Something to resist the stroke     Of unpermitted Paw--upon the pain     Of Everlasting Penalties--if broke.  [Illustration]       I sometimes think the Pussy-Willows grey     Are Angel Kittens who have lost their way,     And every Bulrush on the river bank     A Cat-Tail from some lovely Cat astray.  [Illustration]       Sometimes I think perchance that Allah may,     When he created Cats, have thrown away     The Tails He marred in making, and they grew     To Cat-Tails and to Pussy-Willows grey.  [Illustration]       And lately, when I was not Feeling Fit,     Bereft alike of Piety and Wit,     There came an Angel Shape and offered me     A Fragrant Plant and bid me taste of it.  [Illustration]       'Twas that reviving Herb, that Spicy Weed,     The Cat-Nip. Tho' 'tis good in time of need,     Ah, feed upon it lightly, for who knows     To what unlovely antics it may lead.  [Illustration]       Strange--is it not?--that of the numbers who     Before me passed this Door of Darkness thro',     Not one returns thro' it again, altho'     Ofttimes I've waited here an hour or two.  [Illustration]       'Tis but a Tent where takes his one Night's Rest     A Rodent to the Realms of Death address'd,     When Cook, arising, looks for him and then--     Baits, and prepares it for another Guest.  [Illustration]       They say the Lion and the Lizard keep     The Courts where Jamshýd gloried and drank deep.     The Lion is my cousin; I don't know     Who Jamshýd is--nor shall it break my sleep.  [Illustration]       Impotent glimpses of the Game displayed     Upon the Counter--temptingly arrayed;     Hither and thither moved or checked or weighed,     And one by one back in the Ice Chest laid.  [Illustration]       What if the Sole could fling the Ice aside,     And with me to some Area's haven glide--     Were't not a Shame, were't not a shame for it     In this Cold Prison crippled to abide?  [Illustration]       Some for the Glories of the Sole, and Some     Mew for the proper Bowl of Milk to come.     Ah, take the Fish and let your Credit go,     And plead the rumble of an empty Tum.  [Illustration]       One thing is certain: tho' this Stolen Bite     Should be my last and Wrath consume me quite,     One taste of It within the Area caught     Better than at the Table lost outright.  [Illustration]       Indeed, indeed Repentance oft before     I swore, but was I hungry when I swore?     And then and then came Cook--with Hose in hand--     And drowned my glory in a sorry pour.  [Illustration]       What without asking hither harried whence,     And without asking whither harried hence--     O, many a taste of that forbidden Sole     Must down the memory of that Insolence.  [Illustration]       Heaven, but the vision of a Flowing Bowl;     And Hell, the sizzle of a Frying Sole     Heard in the hungry Darkness, where Myself,     So rudely cast, must impotently roll.  [Illustration]       The Vine has a tough Fibre which about     While clings my Being;--let the Canine Flout     Till his Bass Voice be pitched to such loud key     It shall unlock the door I mew without.  [Illustration]       Up from the Basement to the Seventh Flat     I rose, and on the Crown of Fashion sat,     And many a Ball unravelled by the way--     But not the Master's angry Bawl of \"Scat!\"  [Illustration]       Then to the Well of Wisdom I--and lo!     With my own Paw I wrought to make it flow,     And This was all the Harvest that I reaped:     We come like Kittens and like Cats we go.  [Illustration]       Why be this Ink the Fount of Wit?--who dare     Blaspheme the glistening Pen-drink as a snare?     A Blessing?--I should spread it, should I not?     And if a Curse--why, then upset it!--there!  [Illustration]       A moment's Halt, a momentary Taste     Of Bitter, and amid the Trickling Waste     I wrought strange shapes from Máh to Máhi, yet     I know not what I wrote, nor why they chased.  [Illustration]       Now I beyond the Pale am safely past.     O, but the long, long time their Rage shall last,     Which, tho' they call to supper, I shall heed     As a Stone Cat should heed a Pebble cast.  [Illustration]       And that perverted Soul beneath the Sky     They call the Dog--Heed not his angry Cry;     Not all his Threats can make me budge one bit,     Nor all his Empty Bluster terrify.  [Illustration]       They are no other than a moving Show     Of whirling Shadow Shapes that come and go     Me-ward thro' Moon illumined Darkness hurled,     In midnight, by the Lodgers in the Row.

The Cream of Life from out your Bowl shall pour     Nine times--ere it lie broken on the Floor.
