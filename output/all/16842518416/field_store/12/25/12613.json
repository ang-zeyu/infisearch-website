To get land, it's every man for himself, and the loser starves, and their entire legal and monetary system revolves on that principle. They've built up the most confusing and impossible system of barter and trade imaginable, aimed at individual survival, with land as the value behind the credit. That explains the lying--of course they're liars, with an economy like that. They've completely missed the concept of truth. Pathological? You bet they're pathological! Only a fool would tell the truth when his life depended on his being a better liar than the next guy! Lying is the time-honored tradition, with their entire legal system built around it.\"  Zeckler snorted. \"But how could they _possibly_ have a legal system? I mean, if they don't recognize the truth when it slaps them in the face?\"  Meyerhoff shrugged. \"As we understand legal systems, I suppose they don't have one. They have only the haziest idea what truth represents, and they've shrugged off the idea as impossible and useless.\" He chuckled maliciously. \"So you went out and found a chunk of ground in the uplands, and sold it to a dozen separate, self-centered, half-starved natives! Encroachment on private property is legal grounds for murder on this planet, and twelve of them descended on the same chunk of land at the same time, all armed with title-deeds.\" Meyerhoff sighed. \"You've got twelve mad Altairians in your hair. You've got a mad planet in your hair. And in the meantime, Terra's most valuable uranium source in five centuries is threatening to cut off supply unless they see your blood splattered liberally all the way from here to the equator.\"  Zeckler was visibly shaken. \"Look,\" he said weakly, \"so I wasn't so smart. What am I going to do? I mean, are you going to sit quietly by and let them butcher me? How could I defend myself in a legal setup like _this_?\"  Meyerhoff smiled coolly. \"You're going to get your sly little con-man brain to working, I think,\" he said softly. \"By Interplanetary Rules, they have to give you a trial in Terran legal form--judge, jury, court procedure, all that folderol. They think it's a big joke--after all, what could a judicial oath mean to them?--but they agreed. Only thing is, they're going to hang you, if they die trying. So you'd better get those stunted little wits of yours clicking--and if you try to implicate _me_, even a little bit, I'll be out of there so fast you won't know what happened.\"  With that Meyerhoff walked to the door. He jerked it inward sharply, and spilled two guards over on their faces. \"Privacy,\" he grunted, and started back up the slippery corridor.         *       *       *       *       *  It certainly _looked_ like a courtroom, at any rate. In the front of the long, damp stone room was a bench, with a seat behind it, and a small straight chair to the right. To the left was a stand with twelve chairs--larger chairs, with a railing running along the front. The rest of the room was filled almost to the door with seats facing the bench. Zeckler followed the shaggy-haired guard into the room, nodding approvingly. \"Not such a bad arrangement,\" he said. \"They must have gotten the idea fast.\"  Meyerhoff wiped the perspiration from his forehead, and shot the little con-man a stony glance. \"At least you've got a courtroom, a judge, and a jury for this mess. Beyond that--\" He shrugged eloquently. \"I can't make any promises.\"  In the back of the room a door burst open with a bang. Loud, harsh voices were heard as half a dozen of the huge Altairians attempted to push through the door at once. Zeckler clamped on the headset to his translator unit, and watched the hubbub in the anteroom with growing alarm. Finally the question of precedent seemed to be settled, and a group of the Altairians filed in, in order of stature, stalking across the room in flowing black robes, pug-nosed faces glowering with self-importance. They descended upon the jury box, grunting and scrapping with each other for the first-row seats, and the judge took his place with obvious satisfaction behind the heavy wooden bench. Finally, the prosecuting attorney appeared, flanked by two clerks, who took their places beside him. The prosecutor eyed Zeckler with cold malevolence, then turned and delivered a sly wink at the judge.  In a moment the room was a hubbub as it filled with the huge, bumbling, bear-like creatures, jostling each other and fighting for seats, growling and complaining. Two small fights broke out in the rear, but were quickly subdued by the group of gendarmes guarding the entrance. Finally the judge glared down at Zeckler with all three eyes, and pounded the bench top with a wooden mallet until the roar of activity subsided. The jurymen wriggled uncomfortably in their seats, exchanging winks, and finally turned their attention to the front of the court.  \"We are reading the case of the people of Altair I,\" the judge's voice roared out, \"against one Harry Zeckler--\" he paused for a long, impressive moment--\"Terran.\" The courtroom immediately burst into an angry growl, until the judge pounded the bench five or six times more. \"This--creature--is hereby accused of the following crimes,\" the judge bellowed. \"Conspiracy to overthrow the government of Altair I. Brutal murder of seventeen law-abiding citizens of the village of Karzan at the third hour before dawn in the second period after his arrival. Desecration of the Temple of our beloved Goddess Zermat, Queen of the Harvest. Conspiracy with the lesser gods to cause the unprecedented drought in the Dermatti section of our fair globe. Obscene exposure of his pouch-marks in a public square. Four separate and distinct charges of jail-break and bribery--\" The judge pounded the bench for order--\"Espionage with the accursed scum of Altair II in preparation for interplanetary invasion.\"  The little con-man's jaw sagged lower and lower, the color draining from his face. He turned, wide-eyed, to Meyerhoff, then back to the judge.  \"The Chairman of the Jury,\" said the Judge succinctly, \"will read the verdict.\"  The little native in the front of the jury-box popped up like a puppet on a string. \"Defendant found guilty on all counts,\" he said.  \"Defendant is guilty! The court will pronounce sentence--\"  \"_Now wait a minute!_\" Zeckler was on his feet, wild-eyed. \"What kind of railroad job--\"  The judge blinked disappointedly at Paul Meyerhoff. \"Not yet?\" he asked, unhappily.  \"No.\" Meyerhoff's hands twitched nervously. \"Not yet, Your Honor. Later, Your Honor. The trial comes _first_.\"  The judge looked as if his candy had been stolen. \"But you _said_ I should call for the verdict.\"  \"Later. You have to have the trial before you can have the verdict.\"  The Altairian shrugged indifferently. \"Now--later--\" he muttered.  \"Have the prosecutor call his first witness,\" said Meyerhoff.  Zeckler leaned over, his face ashen. \"These charges,\" he whispered. \"They're insane!\"  \"Of course they are,\" Meyerhoff whispered back.  \"But what am I going to--\"  \"Sit tight. Let _them_ set things up.\"  \"But those _lies_. They're liars, the whole pack of them--\" He broke off as the prosecutor roared a name.  The shaggy brute who took the stand was wearing a bright purple hat which sat rakishly over one ear. He grinned the Altairian equivalent of a hungry grin at the prosecutor. Then he cleared his throat and started. \"This Terran riffraff--\"  \"The oath,\" muttered the judge. \"We've got to have the oath.\"  The prosecutor nodded, and four natives moved forward, carrying huge inscribed marble slabs to the front of the court. One by one the chunks were reverently piled in a heap at the witness's feet. The witness placed a huge, hairy paw on the cairn, and the prosecutor said, \"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you--\" he paused to squint at the paper in his hand, and finished on a puzzled note, \"--Goddess?\"  The witness removed the paw from the rock pile long enough to scratch his ear. Then he replaced it, and replied, \"Of course,\" in an injured tone.  \"Then tell this court what you have seen of the activities of this abominable wretch.\"  The witness settled back into the chair, fixing one eye on Zeckler's face, another on the prosecutor, and closing the third as if in meditation. \"I think it happened on the fourth night of the seventh crossing of Altair II (may the Goddess cast a drought upon it)--or was it the seventh night of the fourth crossing?--\" he grinned apologetically at the judge--\"when I was making my way back through town toward my blessed land-plot, minding my own business, Your Honor, after weeks of bargaining for the crop I was harvesting. Suddenly from the shadow of the building, this creature--\" he waved a paw at Zeckler--\"stopped me in my tracks with a vicious cry. He had a weapon I'd never seen before, and before I could find my voice he forced me back against the wall. I could see by the cruel glint in his eyes that there was no warmth, no sympathy in his heart, that I was--\"  \"Objection!\" Zeckler squealed plaintively, jumping to his feet. \"This witness can't even remember what night he's talking about!\"  The judge looked startled. Then he pawed feverishly through his bundle of notes. \"Overruled,\" he said abruptly. \"Continue, please.\"  The witness glowered at Zeckler. \"As I was saying before this loutish interruption,\" he muttered, \"I could see that I was face to face with the most desperate of criminal types, even for Terrans. Note the shape of his head, the flabbiness of his ears. I was petrified with fear. And then, helpless as I was, this two-legged abomination began to shower me with threats of evil to my blessed home, dark threats of poisoning my land unless I would tell him where he could find the resting place of our blessed Goddess--\"  \"I never saw him before in my life,\" Zeckler moaned to Meyerhoff. \"Listen to him! Why should I care where their Goddess--\"  Meyerhoff gave him a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24275"],["title","Letter of the Law (#2)"],["body","look. \"The Goddess runs things around here. She makes it rain. If it doesn't rain, somebody's insulted her. It's very simple.\"  \"But how can I fight testimony like that?\"  \"I doubt if you _can_ fight it.\"  \"But they can't prove a word of it--\" He looked at the jury, who were listening enraptured to the second witness on the stand. This one was testifying regarding the butcherous slaughter of eighteen (or was it twenty-three? Oh, yes, twenty-three) women and children in the suburban village of Karzan. The pogrom, it seemed, had been accomplished by an energy weapon which ate great, gaping holes in the sides of buildings. A third witness took the stand, continuing the drone as the room grew hotter and muggier. Zeckler grew paler and paler, his eyes turning glassy as the testimony piled up. \"But it's not _true_,\" he whispered to Meyerhoff.  \"Of course it isn't! Can't you understand? _These people have no regard for truth._ It's stupid, to them, silly, a mark of low intelligence. The only thing in the world they have any respect for is a liar bigger and more skillful than they are.\"  Zeckler jerked around abruptly as he heard his name bellowed out. \"Does the defendant have anything to say before the jury delivers the verdict?\"  \"Do I have--\" Zeckler was across the room in a flash, his pale cheeks suddenly taking on a feverish glow. He sat down gingerly on the witness chair, facing the judge, his eyes bright with fear and excitement. \"Your--Your Honor, I--I have a statement to make which will have a most important bearing on this case. You must listen with the greatest care.\" He glanced quickly at Meyerhoff, and back to the judge. \"Your Honor,\" he said in a hushed voice. \"You are in gravest of danger. All of you. Your lives--your very land is at stake.\"  The judge blinked, and shuffled through his notes hurriedly as a murmur arose in the court. \"Our land?\"  \"Your lives, your land, everything you hold dear,\" Zeckler said quickly, licking his lips nervously. \"You must try to understand me--\" he glanced apprehensively over his shoulder \"now, because I may not live long enough to repeat what I am about to tell you--\"  The murmur quieted down, all ears straining in their headsets to hear his words. \"These charges,\" he continued, \"all of them--they're perfectly true. At least, they _seem_ to be perfectly true. But in every instance, I was working with heart and soul, risking my life, for the welfare of your beautiful planet.\"  There was a loud hiss from the back of the court. Zeckler frowned and rubbed his hands together. \"It was my misfortune,\" he said, \"to go to the wrong planet when I first came to Altair from my homeland on Terra. I--I landed on Altair II, a grave mistake, but as it turned out, a very fortunate error. Because in attempting to arrange trading in that frightful place, I made certain contacts.\" His voice trembled, and sank lower. \"I learned the horrible thing which is about to happen to this planet, at the hands of those barbarians. The conspiracy is theirs, not mine. They have bribed your Goddess, flattered her and lied to her, coerced her all-powerful goodness to their own evil interests, preparing for the day when they could persuade her to cast your land into the fiery furnace of a ten-year-drought--\"  Somebody in the middle of the court burst out laughing. One by one the natives nudged one another, and booed, and guffawed, until the rising tide of racket drowned out Zeckler's words. \"The defendant is obviously lying,\" roared the prosecutor over the pandemonium. \"Any fool knows that the Goddess can't be bribed. How could she be a Goddess if she could?\"  Zeckler grew paler. \"But--perhaps they were very clever--\"  \"And how could they flatter her, when she knows, beyond doubt, that she is the most exquisitely radiant creature in all the Universe? And _you_ dare to insult her, drag her name in the dirt.\"  The hisses grew louder, more belligerent. Cries of \"Butcher him!\" and \"Scald his bowels!\" rose from the courtroom. The judge banged for silence, his eyes angry.  \"Unless the defendant wishes to take up more of our precious time with these ridiculous lies, the jury--\"  \"Wait! Your Honor, I request a short recess before I present my final plea.\"  \"Recess?\"  \"A few moments to collect my thoughts, to arrange my case.\"  The judge settled back with a disgusted snarl. \"Do I have to?\" he asked Meyerhoff.  Meyerhoff nodded. The judge shrugged, pointing over his shoulder to the anteroom. \"You can go in there,\" he said.  Somehow, Zeckler managed to stumble from the witness stand, amid riotous boos and hisses, and tottered into the anteroom.         *       *       *       *       *  Zeckler puffed hungrily on a cigarette, and looked up at Meyerhoff with haunted eyes. \"It--it doesn't look so good,\" he muttered.  Meyerhoff's eyes were worried, too. For some reason, he felt a surge of pity and admiration for the haggard con-man. \"It's worse than I'd anticipated,\" he admitted glumly. \"That was a good try, but you just don't know enough about them and their Goddess.\" He sat down wearily. \"I don't see what you can do. They want your blood, and they're going to have it. They just won't believe you, no matter _how_ big a lie you tell.\"  Zeckler sat in silence for a moment. \"This lying business,\" he said finally, \"exactly how does it work?\"  \"The biggest, most convincing liar wins. It's as simple as that. It doesn't matter how outlandish a whopper you tell. Unless, of course, they've made up their minds that you just naturally aren't as big a liar as they are. And it looks like that's just what they've done. It wouldn't make any difference to them _what_ you say--unless, somehow, you could _make_ them believe it.\"  Zeckler frowned. \"And how do they regard the--the biggest liar? I mean, how do they feel toward him?\"  Meyerhoff shifted uneasily. \"It's hard to say. It's been my experience that they respect him highly--maybe even fear him a little. After all, the most convincing liar always wins in any transaction, so he gets more land, more food, more power. Yes, I think the biggest liar could go where he pleased without any interference.\"  Zeckler was on his feet, his eyes suddenly bright with excitement. \"Wait a minute,\" he said tensely. \"To tell them a lie that they'd have to believe--a lie they simply couldn't _help_ but believe--\" He turned on Meyerhoff, his hands trembling. \"Do they _think_ the way we do? I mean, with logic, cause and effect, examining evidence and drawing conclusions? Given certain evidence, would they have to draw the same conclusions that we have to draw?\"  Meyerhoff blinked. \"Well--yes. Oh, yes, they're perfectly logical.\"  Zeckler's eyes flashed, and a huge grin broke out on his sallow face. His thin body fairly shook. He started hopping up and down on one foot, staring idiotically into space. \"If I could only think--\" he muttered. \"Somebody--somewhere--something I read.\"  \"Whatever are you talking about?\"  \"It was a Greek, I think--\"  Meyerhoff stared at him. \"Oh, come now. Have you gone off your rocker completely? You've got a problem on your hands, man.\"  \"No, no, I've got a problem in the bag!\" Zeckler's cheeks flushed. \"Let's go back in there--I think I've got an answer!\"  The courtroom quieted the moment they opened the door, and the judge banged the gavel for silence. As soon as Zeckler had taken his seat on the witness stand, the judge turned to the head juryman. \"Now, then,\" he said with happy finality. \"The jury--\"  \"Hold on! Just one minute more.\"  The judge stared down at Zeckler as if he were a bug on a rock. \"Oh, yes. You had something else to say. Well, go ahead and say it.\"  Zeckler looked sharply around the hushed room. \"You want to convict me,\" he said softly, \"in the worst sort of way. Isn't that right?\"  Eyes swung toward him. The judge broke into an evil grin. \"That's right.\"  \"But you can't really convict me until you've considered carefully any statement I make in my own defense. Isn't that right?\"  The judge looked uncomfortable. \"If you've got something to say, go ahead and say it.\"  \"I've got just one statement to make. Short and sweet. But you'd better listen to it, and think it out carefully before you decide that you really want to convict me.\" He paused, and glanced slyly at the judge. \"You don't think much of those who tell the truth, it seems. Well, put _this_ statement in your record, then.\" His voice was loud and clear in the still room. \"_All Earthmen are absolutely incapable of telling the truth._\"  Puzzled frowns appeared on the jury's faces. One or two exchanged startled glances, and the room was still as death. The judge stared at him, and then at Meyerhoff, then back. \"But you\"--he stammered. \"You're\"--He stopped in mid-sentence, his jaw sagging.  One of the jurymen let out a little squeak, and fainted dead away. It took, all in all, about ten seconds for the statement to soak in.  And then pandemonium broke loose in the courtroom.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Really,\" said Harry Zeckler loftily, \"it was so obvious I'm amazed that it didn't occur to me first thing.\" He settled himself down comfortably in the control cabin of the Interplanetary Rocket and grinned at the outline of Altair IV looming larger in the view screen.  Paul Meyerhoff stared stonily at the controls, his lips compressed angrily. \"You might at least have told me what you were planning.\"  \"And take the chance of being overheard? Don't be silly. It had to come as a bombshell. I had to establish myself as a liar--the prize liar of them all, but I had to tell the sort of lie that they simply could not cope with. Something that would throw them into such utter confusion that they wouldn't _dare_ convict me.\" He grinned impishly at Meyerhoff. \"The paradox of Epimenides the Cretan. It really stopped them cold. They _knew_ I was an Earthmen, which meant that my statement that Earthmen were liars was a lie, which meant that maybe I wasn't a liar, in which case--oh, it was tailor-"]]]
