So ended operations in Louisiana for the year.  Until the following spring, Taylor continued to occupy the Teche region, while Weitzel rested quietly in La Fourche, with his headquarters at Thibodeaux and his troops so disposed as to cover and hold the country without losing touch.  On the 9th of November, the whole of Louisiana lying west of the Mississippi, except the delta parishes of Plaquemine and Terre Bonne, was constituted a military district to be known as the District of La Fourche, and Weitzel was assigned to the command.  Meanwhile General Butler, with the consent of the War Department, had raised, organized, and equipped, in the neighborhood of New Orleans, two good regiments of Louisianans, the 1st Louisiana, Colonel Richard E. Holcomb, and the 2d Louisiana, Colonel Charles J. Paine, both regiments admirably commanded and well officered; three excellent troops of Louisiana cavalry, under fine leaders, Captains Henry F. Williamson, Richard Barrett, and J. F. Godfrey; and beside these white troops, three regiments of negroes, designated as the 1st, 2d, and 3d Louisiana Native Guards.  This was the name originally employed by Governor Moore early in 1861, to describe an organization of the free men of color of New Orleans enrolled for the defence of the city against the expected attack by the forces of the Union.  This action was taken by Butler of his own motion.  It was never formally approved by the government, but it was not interfered with.  These three regiments were the first negro troops mustered into the service of the United States.  At least one of them, the 1st, was largely made up of men of that peculiar and exclusive caste known to the laws of slavery as the free men of color of Louisiana.  All the field and staff officers were white men, mainly taken from the rolls of the troops already in service; but at first all the company officers were negroes.  As this was the first experiment, it was perhaps, in the state of feeling then prevailing, inevitable, yet not the less to be regretted, that the white officers were, with some notable exceptions, inferior men.  Fortunately, however, courts-martial and examining boards made their career for the most part a short one.  As for the colored officers of the line, early in 1863 they were nearly all disqualified on the most rudimentary examination, and then the rest resigned.  After that, the government having determined to raise a large force of negro troops, it became the settled policy to grant commissions as officers to none but white men.  The 1st and 2d regiments were sent into the district of La Fourche to guard the railway.  Then, between Butler and Weitzel, in spite of confidence on the one hand and respect and affection on the other, began the usual controversy about arming the negro.  To one unacquainted with the history of this question and of those times it must seem strange indeed to read the emphatic words in which a soldier so loyal and, in the best sense, so subordinate as Weitzel, declared his unwillingness to command these troops, and to reflect that in a little more than two years he was destined to accept with alacrity the command of a whole army corps of black men, and at last to ride in triumph at their head into the very capital of the Confederacy.  With the exception of the levies raised by its commander, the Department of the Gulf had so far received no access of strength from any quarter.  From the North had come hardly a recruit.  In the intense heat and among the poisonous swamps the effective strength melted away day by day.  Thus the numbers present fell 3,795 during the month of July; in October, when the sickly season had done its worst, the wastage reached a total of 5,390.  At the time of the battle of Baton Rouge, Butler's effective force can hardly have exceeded 7,000.  When his strength was the greatest it probably did not exceed, if indeed it reached, the number of 13,000 effective.  The condition of affairs was therefore such that Butler found himself with an army barely sufficient for the secure defence of the vast territory committed to his care, and for any offensive operation absolutely powerless.  To hold what had been gained it was practically necessary to sit still; and to sit still then, as always in all wars, was to invite attack.  These things Butler did not fail to represent to the government, and to repeat.  At last, about the middle of November, he received a few encouraging words from Halleck, dated the 3d of that month, in which he was assured that the \"delay in sending reinforcements has not been the fault of the War Department.  It is hoped that some will be ready to start as soon as the November elections are over.  Brigadier-generals will be sent with these reinforcements.\" With them was to be a major-general, the new commander of the department; but this Halleck did not say.   CHAPTER V. BANKS IN COMMAND.  When the campaigns of 1862 were drawing to an end, the government changed all the commanders and turned to the consideration of new plans.  With President Lincoln, as we have seen, the opening of the Mississippi had long been a favored scheme.  His early experience had rendered him familiar with the waters, the shores, and the vast traffic of the great river, and had brought home to him the common interests and the mutual dependence of the farmers, the traders, the miners, and the manufacturers of the States bordering upon the upper Mississippi and the Ohio on the one hand, and of the merchants and planters of the Gulf on the other.  Thus he was fully prepared to enter warmly into the idea that had taken possession of the minds and hearts of the people of the Northwest.  From a vague longing this idea had now grown into a deep and settled sentiment. Indeed in all the West the opening of the Mississippi played a part that can only be realized by comparing it with the prevailing sentiment of the East, so early, so long, so loudly expressed in the cry, \"On to Richmond!\"  That the President should have been in complete accord with the popular impulse is hardly to be wondered at by any one that has followed, with the least attention, the details of his remarkable career.  Moreover, the popular impulse was right.  Wars take their character from the causes that produce them and the people or the nations by whom they are waged.  This was not a contest upon some petty question involving the fate of a ministry, a dynasty, or even a monarchy, to be fought out between regular armies upon well-known plans at the convergence of the roads between two opposing capitals. The struggle was virtually one between two peoples hitherto united as one,--between the people of the North, who had taken up arms for the maintenance and the restoration of the Union, and the people of the South, who had taken up arms to destroy the Union.  Of such an issue there could be no compromise; to such a contest there could be no end short of exhaustion.  For four long years it was destined to go on, and at times to rage with a fury almost unexampled along lines whose length was measured by the thousand miles and over a battle-ground nearly as large as the continent of Europe. Looked at merely from the standpoint of strategy, and discarding all considerations not directly concerning the movements of armies, true policy might, perhaps, have dictated the concentration of all available resources in men and material upon the great central lines of operations, roughly indicated by the mention of Chattanooga and Atlanta,--the road eventually followed by Sherman in his triumphant march to the sea.  Apart, however, from considerations strictly tactical, the importance of cutting off the trans-Mississippi region as a source of supply for the main Confederate armies was obvious; while from the governments of Europe, of England and France above all, the pressure was great for cotton, partly, indeed, as a pretext for interfering in our domestic struggle to their own advantage, but largely, also, to enable those governments to quiet the cry of the starving millions of their people.  Instructed, as well as warned, by the events of the previous summer, the President now resolved on a combined attempt by two strong columns.  On the 21st of October he sent Major-General John A. McClernand to Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa, with confidential orders, authorizing him to raise troops for an expedition, under his command, to move against Vicksburg from Cairo or Memphis as a place of rendezvous, and \"to clear the Mississippi River and open navigation to New Orleans.\"  Perhaps because of the confidence still felt in Grant by the President himself, although within narrowing limits, Grant was not to share the fate of McClellan, of Buell, and of so many others.  The secret orders were not made known to him, yet it was settled that he was to retain the command of his department, while the principal active operations of the army within its limits were to be conducted by another.  Even for this consideration it is rather more than likely he was indebted in a great degree to the exceptional advantage he enjoyed in having at all times at the seat of government, in the person of Washburne, a strong and devoted party of one, upon whose assistance the government daily found it convenient to lean.  A few days later, on the 31st of October, Major-General Nathaniel P. Banks was sent to New York and Boston, with similar orders, to collect in New England and New York a force for the co-operating column from New Orleans.  On the 8th of November this was followed by the formal order of the President assigning Banks to the command of the Department of the Gulf, including the State of Texas."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24608"],["title","The Tale of Kiddie Katydid (#0)"],["body","Team at https://www.pgdp.net            THE TALE OF KIDDIE KATYDID     TUCK-ME-IN TALES  (Trademark Registered)     BY   ARTHUR SCOTT BAILEY          AUTHOR OF         SLEEPY-TIME TALES         (Trademark Registered)         *       *       *       *       *          THE TALE OF JOLLY ROBIN         THE TALE OF OLD MR.

To be sure, many of the wild folk--and the people in the farmhouse, too--remembered hearing her name mentioned the year before.  But they had quite forgotten about her, until August came and Kiddie Katydid and his relations brought her to their minds once more.  Each night the Katydids' rasping chant was repeated again and again: _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did!_ But since in any crowd there are always a few that want to be different from the rest, now and then some member of Kiddie's clan insisted that Katy didn't--somewhat in this fashion: _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she didn't!_  However, there were always so many others to drown any such puzzling statement with their shrill clamor that Katy really _did_ do it (whatever it was!) that nobody paid much attention to those few who didn't quite agree.  On warm, dry, midsummer nights the Katydids all made a terrific racket. But there wasn't one of them that outdid Kiddie. He always had the best time when he was making the most noise. And since he liked to station himself in a tree near Farmer Green's house, his uproar often rose plainly above that of the other Katydids.  Lying in bed in his little room under the eaves, Johnnie Green sometimes wished that Kiddie would keep quiet long enough to let him go to sleep in peace.  To be sure, the balmy breezes wafted many other night sounds through Johnnie's open window. From near-by came Chirpy Cricket's cheerful piping. And in the distant swamp the musical Frog family held a singing party every evening. Johnnie Green liked to hear them. But he objected strongly to the weird hooting and horrid laughter of Solomon Owl, who left the hemlock woods after dark to hunt for field mice.  As for Kiddie Katydid, he paid little attention to any other of the night cries. No matter what anybody else said, he solemnly hurled back at him that neverending refrain, _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did!_  You would have thought, if you had heard Kiddie, that somebody had disputed his statement. But such was not the case at all. Since no one except the Katydids knew anything about the mysterious Katy, nobody was able to say truthfully that she _didn't_ do it. In fact, the whole affair was a great secret, so far as outsiders were concerned. And one night Johnnie Green even thrust his head out of the window and cried impatiently:  \"All right! All right! I admit that Katy did it. And now do please keep still!\"  Of course, his plea failed to silence Kiddie Katydid. But it relieved Johnnie Green's mind and made him feel better, anyhow.  Kiddie told his own people about Johnnie's outburst. And they all agreed that it was a rude thing to do.  \"Doesn't he know,\" they asked, \"that the night belongs to us?\"     II  THE WARNING   It must not be supposed that all of Kiddie Katydid's family made the same neverending din at night. Actually it was only the gentlemen that so amused themselves. No doubt the ladies, too, knew the secret about the mysterious Katy--and what she did.  But for some reason they never, never mentioned the matter. Even when they gossiped among themselves, as they sometimes did, they never touched upon that subject.  Furthermore, in the daytime Kiddie and his fellows were as quiet as they could be. Having waked the echoes all night long, they were content, when morning came, to rest silently among the trees and shrubs. And a very good reason did they have, too, for such a habit. During the day there were altogether too many birds flying about, to please the Katydids. And Kiddie often remarked in a joking way that the only birds he cared about were those that _didn't care about him_!  Of course, there were a few birds that prowled about Pleasant Valley after dark. Mr. Nighthawk was one of that crew of nightly wanderers. And whenever the word was passed around that he had been seen in the neighborhood, Kiddie Katydid tried to lower his solemn chant, because he knew that Mr. Nighthawk was usually in search of something to eat.  Now, when Kiddie Katydid felt hungry he drove away his gnawing pangs by browsing upon leaves and tender twigs. But Mr. Nighthawk had no taste for such fodder.  He had an appetite for insects. And between dusk and dawn a good many of Kiddie Katydid's neighbors of one kind or another found their way into Mr. Nighthawk's tummy.  So you see it was no wonder that Kiddie was not eager to attract the attention of that night rover. Some of the more timid of Kiddie's companions even begged him, at times, to hush. They said he was making such a noise that Mr. Nighthawk would be sure to hear it, even if he were a quarter of a mile away.  But Kiddie Katydid usually laughed at those faint-hearted ones; and often he shrilled his _Katy did, Katy did_, more loudly than before, just to show them that he was not afraid.  \"A person has to take a few chances,\" he remarked one day. \"If we were all afraid to make a sound it would be pretty hard on Katy, for then she would have nobody to take her part. And what would people think of her?\"  Evidently Kiddie's reason was a good one, because a number of his cousins spoke up at once and said that they agreed with him perfectly.  But their sisters all exclaimed that sooner or later Mr. Nighthawk would hear them; and then there would certainly be trouble.  Strangely enough, the words were scarcely out of their mouths before they heard a loud call that struck them cold with fear.  _Peent! Peent!_ The cry came out of the air above them without the least warning. And everybody--including Kiddie Katydid--knew that Mr. Nighthawk had come.     III  MR. NIGHTHAWK   Following his cry with two or three quick beats of his wings, Mr. Nighthawk dropped swiftly down among the trees in Farmer Green's dooryard.  He fell so fast that Kiddie Katydid, watching from his hiding-place in one of the maples, couldn't help hoping that the sky-coaster would be unable to stop himself in time to escape being dashed upon the ground.  But Mr. Nighthawk was very skillful at that sport. Just at the right moment he turned quickly, while the air rushed through his wing-feathers with a roaring sound. And then he mounted upward again.  Meanwhile Kiddie Katydid kept very still among the leaves, with his wings folded over his back. Only his two long, thread-like feelers _would_ wave backwards and forwards, although he tried to keep them still. He was so nearly the color of the green of the tree-top that he trusted Mr. Nighthawk wouldn't be able to spy him.  But he was soon disappointed. For Mr. Nighthawk suddenly cried, \"Ha!\" and alighted on a neighboring limb.  \"There you are!\" he said. \"You needn't think I don't see you!\"  \"Why, good evening!\" Kiddie Katydid answered, since he was discovered--and there was no use denying it. \"It's a great surprise--meeting you so unexpectedly. If you'd only sent word that you were coming I'd have made different arrangements.\"  \"I've no doubt you would have!\" Mr. Nighthawk sneered. \"But I like to take people unawares.... I've heard about you,\" he added. \"They say that you're a great jumper--the spriest jumper in all Pleasant Valley.\"  \"Well, I can jump fairly well,\" Kiddie Katydid admitted. \"But I don't pride myself on my jumping. It's something that has always run in my family, you know. All"]]]
