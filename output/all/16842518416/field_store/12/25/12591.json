Weener--yes.\" She produced the toothpick and scratched her chin with it. \"About the Metamorphizer.\" She paused and rubbed her elbow. \"A mistake, I'm afraid. An error.\"  Aha, I thought, a new deal. Someone's offered to back her. Steal her brainchild, negate all my efforts to make her independent and cheat me of the reward of my spadework. You wouldnt think of her as a frail credulous woman, easily taken in by the first smooth talker, but a woman is a woman afterall.  \"Look, Miss Francis,\" I argued, \"youve got a big thing here, a great thing. The possibilities are practically unlimited. Of course youll have to have a manager to put it across--an executive, a man with business experience--someone who can tap the great reservoir of buying power by the conviction of a new need. Organize a sales campaign; rationalize production. Put the whole thing on a commercial basis. For all this you need a man who has contacted the public on every level--preferably doortodoor and with a varied background.\"  She strode past the stove, which had gathered new accreta during the night and looked in the cloudy mirror as though searching for a misplaced thought. \"No doubt, Weener, no doubt. But before all these romantically streamlined things eventuate there must be a hiatus. In my haste I overlooked a detail yesterday, trivial maybe--perhaps vital. I should never have let you start out so soon.\"  This was bad; I was struggling now for my job and for the future of the Metamorphizer. \"Miss Francis, I don't know what you mean by mistakes or trivial details or how I could have started out too soon, but whatever the trouble is I'm sure it can be smoothed out easily. Sometimes, you know, obstacles which appear tremendous prove to be nothing at all in experienced hands. I myself have had occasion to put things right for a number of different concerns. Really, Miss Francis, you mustnt let opportunity slip through your fingers. Believe me, I know what a big thing your discovery is--Ive seen what it does.\"  She turned those too sharp eyes on me discomfortingly. \"Ah,\" she said, \"so soon?\"  \"Well,\" I began, \"it certainly acted quickly ...\"  I stopped when I saw she wasnt hearing me. She sat down in the only empty chair and drummed her fingers against big white teeth. \"Even under a microscope,\" she muttered, \"no perceptible reaction for fortyeight hours. Laboratory conditions? Or my own idiocy? But I approximated ...\" Her voice trailed off and for a full minute the absolute silence of the kitchen was broken only by the melodramatic dripping of a tap.  She made an effort to pull herself together and addressed me in her old abrupt way. \"Corn or wheat?\"  \"Ay?\"  \"You said youve seen what it does. I asked you if you had applied it to corn or wheat--or what?\"  She was looking at me so fixedly I had a slight difficulty in putting my words in good order. \"It was neither, mam. I applied some of the stuff to a lawn--\"  \"A _lawn_, Weener?\"  \"Y-yes, mam.\"  \"But I said--\"  \"General instructions, Miss Francis. I'm sure you didnt mean to tie my hands.\"  Another long silence.  \"No, Weener--I didnt mean to tie your hands.\"  \"Well, as I was saying, I applied some of the stuff to a lawn. Exactly according to your instructions--\"  \"In the irrigation water?\"  \"Well, not precisely. But just as good, I assure you.\"  \"Go on.\"  \"A terrible lawn. All shot. Last night. This morning--\"  \"Stop. What kind of grass? Or don't you know?\"  \"Of course I know,\" I answered indignantly. Did she think I was an idiot? \"It was devilgrass.\"  \"Ah.\" She rubbed the back of her hand against her singularly smooth cheek. \"Bermuda. _Cynodon dactylon._ Stupid, stupid, stupid. How could I have been so blind? Did I think only the corn would be affected and not the weeds in the furrows? Or that something like this might not happen?\"  I didnt feel like wasting any more time listening to her soliloquy. \"This morning,\" I continued, \"it was as green--\"  \"All right, Weener, spare me your poetry. Show it to me.\"  \"Well now, Miss Francis ...\" I wanted, understandably enough, to discuss future arrangements before she saw Dinkman's lawn.  \"Immediately, Weener.\"  When dealing with childish persons you have to cater to their whims. I rid myself of the pump--I'd never dreamed I'd be reluctant to part with the monster--while she made perfunctory and unconvincing motions to fit herself for the street. Of course she neither washed nor madeup, but she peered in the glass argumentatively, pulled her jacket down decisively, threw her shoulders back to raise it askew again and gave the swirl of hair a halfhearted pat.  \"I'd like to go over the matter of organizing--\"  \"Not now.\"  I was naturally reluctant to be seen on the street with so conspicuous a figure, but I could hardly escape. I tried to match her swinging stride, but as she was at least six inches taller I had to give a sort of skip between steps, which was less than dignified. Searching my mind to find a tactful approach again to the subject of proper distribution of the Metamorphizer, I felt my opportunity slipping away every moment. She, on her part, was silent and so abstracted that I often had to put out a guiding hand to avert collision with other pedestrians or stationary objects.  I doubt if I'd been gone from Mrs Dinkman's threequarters of an hour. I had left a small group excited at the free show consequent upon the too successful beautification of a local eyesore; I returned to a sizable crowd viewing an impressive phenomenon. The homely levity had vanished; no one shouted jovial advice. Opinions and comments passed in whispers accompanied by furtive glances toward the lawn, as though it were sentient and might be offended by rude speculation. As we pushed through the bystanders I was suddenly aware of their cautious avoidance of contact with the grass itself. The nearest onlookers stood a respectful yard back and when unbalanced by the push of those behind went through such antics to avoid treading on it, while at the same time preserving the convention of innocence of any taboo that they frequently pivoted and pirouetted on one foot in an awkward ballet. The very hiding of their inhibition emphasized the new awesomeness of the grass; it was no longer to be lightly approached or frivolously treated.  Now I am not what is generally called a man of religious sensibilities, having long ago discarded belief in the supernatural; and I am not overcome at odd moments by mystical feelings. Furthermore I had been intimate with this particular patch of vegetation for some eighteen hours. I had viewed its decaying state; I had injected life into it; I had seen it in the first flush of resurrection. In spite of all this, I too fell under the spell of the grass and knew something compounded of wonder and apprehension.  The neatly cut swaths of the little man with the jimdandy mower came to a dramatic end in the middle of the yard. Beyond this shorn portion the grass rose in a threatening crest, taller than a man's knees; green, aloof and derisive. But it was not this forbidding sight which gave me such a queer turn. It was the mown part; for I recalled how the brisk man's machine had cut close and left behind short, crisp stems. Now this piece was almost as high as when I'd first seen it--grown faster in an hour than ordinary grass in a month.   _5._ I stole a look at Miss Francis to see how she was taking the sight, but there was no emotion visible on her face. The toothpick was once more in play and the luminous eyes fixed straight ahead. Her legs were spread apart and she seemed firmly in position for hours to come, as though she would wait for the grass to exhaust its phenomenal growth.  \"Why did they quit cutting?\" I asked the man standing beside me.  \"Mower give out--dulled the blades so they wouldnt cut no more.\"  \"Going to give up and let it grow?\"  \"Hell, no. Sent for a gardener with a powermower. Big one. Cut anything. Ought to be here now.\"  He was, too, honking the crowd from the driveway. Mrs Dinkman was with him, looking at once indignant, persecuted, uncomfortable and selfrighteous. It was evident they had failed to reach any agreement.  The gardener slammed the door of the senescent truck with vehement lack of affection. \"I cut lots a devilgrass, lady, but I won't tie into this overgrown stuff at that price. You got no right to expect it. I know what's fair and it's not reasonable to count on me cutting this like it was an ordinary lawn. You know yourself it isnt fair.\"  \"I'll give you ten dollars and that's my last word.\"  \"Listen, lady, when I get through this job I'll have to take my mower apart and have it resharpened. You think I can afford to do that for a tendollar job?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" repeated Mrs Dinkman firmly.  The gardener appealed to the gallery. \"Listen, folks: now I ask you--is this fair? I'm willing to be reasonable. I understand this lady's in trouble and I'm willing to help, but I can't do a twentyfivedollar job for ten bucks, can I?\"  It was doubtful if the observers were particularly concerned with justice; what they desired was action, swift and drastic. A general resentment at being balked of their amusement was manifest in murmurs of \"Go ahead, do it.\" \"What's the matter with you?\" \"Don't be dumb--do it for nothing--youll get plenty business out of it.\" They appealed to his nobler and baser natures, but he remained adamant.  Not to be balked by his churlishness, they passed a hat and collected $8.67, which I thought a remarkably generous admission price. When this was added to Mrs Dinkman's ten dollars the gardener, still protesting, reluctantly agreed to perform.  Mrs Dinkman prudently holding the total, he unloaded the powermower with many flourishes, making quite an undertaking of oiling and adjusting the roller, setting the blades; bending down to assure himself of the gasoline in the small tank, finally wheeling the contraption into"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24246"],["title","Greener Than You Think (#5)"],["body","with great spirit. The motor started with a disgruntled put! changing into a series of resigned explosions as he guided it over the lawn crosswise to the lines of his predecessor. Miss Francis followed every motion with rapt attention.  \"Did you expect this?\" I asked.  \"Ay? The abnormally stimulated growth, you mean?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Yes and no. Work in the laboratory didnt indicate it. My own fault; I didnt realize at once making available so much free nitrogen would have such instant results. But last night--\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Not now. Later.\"  The powermower went nicely, I might almost say smoothly, over the stuff cut before, muttering and chickling happily to itself as it dragged the panting gardener, inescapably harnessed, in its wake. But the mown area was narrow and the machine quickly jerked through it and made the last easy journey along the wall of untouched devilgrass beyond.  The gardener, without hesitation, aimed his machine at the thicket of grass. It growled, slowed, coughed, spat, struggled and thrashed on and finally conked out.  \"Ah,\" said Miss Francis.  \"Oh,\" said the spectators.  \"Sonofabitch,\" said the gardener.  He yanked the grumbling mower back angrily, inspecting its mechanism in the manner of a mother with a wayward son and began again. There was desperate determination in his shoulders as he added his forward thrust to the protesting rhythm. The machine went at the grass like a bulldog attacking a borzoi: it bit, chewed, held on. It cut a new six inches readily, another foot slowly--and then with jolts and misfires and loud imprecations from the gardener, it gave up again.  \"You,\" judged Mrs Dinkman, \"don't know how to cut grass.\"  The gardener wiped his sweaty forehead with the inside of his wrist. \"You--you should have a law against you,\" he answered bitterly and inadequately.  But the crowd evidently agreed with Mrs Dinkman's verdict, for there were mutterings of \"It's a farmer's job.\" \"Get somebody with a scythe.\" \"That's right--get a scythe.\" \"Got to have a scythe to cut hay like that.\" These remarks, uttered loudly enough for him to hear, so discouraged the gardener that after three more futile tries he reloaded his equipment and left amidst jeers and expressions of disfavor without attempting to collect any of the money.  For some reason the failure of the powermower lightened the atmosphere. Everyone, including Mrs Dinkman, seemed convinced that scything was the solution. Tension relaxed and the bystanders began talking in something above a whisper.   _6._ \"This will just about ruin our sales,\" I said.  Miss Francis suspended the toothpick before her chin and looked at me as though I'd said dirty words in the presence of ladies.  \"Well it will,\" I argued. \"You can't expect people to have their lawns inoculated if they find out it's going to make grass act this way.\"  Her eyes might have been microscopes and I something smeared on a slide. \"Weener, youre the sort of man who peddles _Life Begins at Forty_ to the inmates of an old peoples' home.\"  I couldnt see what had upset her. The last idea had sound salesappeal, but it was a low income market.... Oh well--her queer notions and obscure reactions undoubtedly went with her scientific gift. You have to lead individuals of this type for their own good, otherwise they spend their lives wandering around in a dreamy fog, accomplishing nothing.  \"I still believe youve got something,\" I pointed out. \"You yourself said it wasnt perfected, but perhaps you havent realized how far from marketable it actually is yet. Now then,\" I went on reasonably, \"youre just going to have to dilute it or change it or do something to it, so while it will make grass nice and green, it won't let it grow wild like this.\"  The fixed look could be annoying. It was nearly impossible to turn your eyes away without rudeness once she caught them. \"Weener, the Metamorphizer is neither fertilizer nor plant food. It is a chemical compound producing a controlled mutation in any treated member of the family Gramineae. Dilution might make it not work--the mutation might not take place--but it couldnt make it half work. I could change your nature by forcibly injecting an ounce of lead into your cerebellum. The change would not only be irrevocable, but it wouldnt make the slightest difference if the lead were adulterated with ironpyrites or not.\"  \"But, Miss Francis,\" I expostulated, \"you'll have to do _something_.\"  She threw her hands into the air, a theatrical gesture even more than ordinarily unbecoming. \"Why?\"  \"Why? To make your discovery marketable, of course.\"  \"Now? In the face of this?\"  \"Miss Francis,\" I said with dignity, \"you are a lady and my selfrespect makes me treat you with the courtesy due your sex. You advertised for a salesman. Instead of sneering at my honest efforts to put your merchandise across to the public, I think youd be better advised to worry about such lowbrow things as keeping faith.\"  \"Am I to keep faith in a vacuum? You came to me as a salesman and I must give you something to sell. This is simple morality; but if such a grant entails concomitant evils, surely I am absolved of my original contract.\"  \"I don't know what youre talking about,\" I told her frankly. \"Your stuff made the grass grow too fast, that's all. You should change the formula or find a new one or else ...\"  \"Or else youll have been left with nothing to sell. I despair of making the point about changing the formula; your trust in my powers is too reverent. Again, I'm not an arrogant woman and I'll admit to some responsibility. Make the world fit for Alfred Weener to make a living in.\"  \"It's Albert, not Alfred,\" I corrected her. I'm not touchy, goodness knows, but afterall a name's a piece of property.  \"Your pardon, Albert.\" She looked down at me with such a placatory and genuinely feminine smile I decided I'd been foolish to be offended. She's a nut of course, I thought indulgently, someone whose life is bounded by theories and testtubes, a woman with no conception of practical reality. Instead of being affronted it would be better to show her patiently how essential my help was to her.  \"Of all people,\" she went on, searching my face with those discomfiting eyes, \"of all people Ive the least cause for moral snobbery. Anxious to get a few dollars to carry on my work--and what was such anxiety but selfindulgence?--I threw the Metamorphizer to you and the world before I realized that it was not only imperfect, but faulty. Hell is paved with good intentions and the first result of my desire to benefit mankind has been to injure the Dinkmans. Meditation in place of infatuation would have shown me both the immediate and ultimate wrongs. I doubt if youd been gone an hour yesterday when I knew I'd made a blunder in permitting you to go out with danger in both hands.\"  \"I don't know what youre getting at,\" I said stiffly, for it sounded as though she were regarding me as a child.  \"Why, as I was sitting, composing my thoughts toward extending the effectiveness of the Metamorphizer beyond gramina, it suddenly became clear to me I'd erred about not knowing how long the effect of the inoculations would last.\"  \"You mean you found out?\" If she brought the thing under control and the effect lasted a specified time there might be repeat business afterall.  \"I found out a great deal by using speculation and logic for a change instead of my hands and memory. I sat and thought, and though this is an unorthodox way for a scientist to proceed, I profited by it. I reasoned: if you change the genetic structure of a plant you change it permanently; not for a day or an hour, but for its existence. I'm not speaking of chance mutations, you understand, Weener, coming about over a course of generations, generations which include sports, degenerates, atavars andsoforth; but of controlled changes, brought about through human intervention. Inoculation by the Metamorphizer might be compared to cutting off a man's leg or transplanting part of his brain. Albert--what happens when you cut off a man's leg?\"  I was tired of being talked to like a grammarschool class. Still, I humored her. \"Why, then he has only one leg,\" I answered agreeably if idiotically.  \"True. More than that, he has a onelegged disposition. His whole ego, his entire spirit is changed. No longer a twolegged creature, reduced, he is another--warped, if you like--being. To come to the immediate point of the grass: if you engender an omnivorous capacity you implant an insatiable appetite.\"  \"I don't catch.\"  \"If you give a man a big belly you make him a hog.\"  A chevvy coupe, gently breathing steam from its radiator cap, interrupted. From its turtle hung the blade of a scythe and on the nervously hinged door had been hopefully lettered _Arcangelo Barelli, Plowing & Grading_.  While the coupe was trembling for some seconds before quieting down, I sighed a double relief, at Miss Francis' forgetfulness of the money due her and the soothing of my fears for the lawn's eating its way downward to China or India. The remark about gluttonous abdomens was disturbing.  \"And of course there will be no further sale of the Metamorphizer,\" she concluded, her eyes now totally concerned with the farmer who was opening the turtle with the air of a man expecting to be unpleasantly astonished.  Mr Barelli came as to a deathbed, a consoling but hopeless smile widening his narrow face only inconsiderably. At the scythe cradled in his arms someone shouted, \"Here's old Father Time himself.\" Mr Barelli wasnt amused. Brushing his forehead thoughtfully with tender fingers he surveyed with saddened eye the three graduated steps of grass. The last step, unessayed by his predecessors, rose nearly four feet, as alien to the concept of lawn as a field of wheat.  \"Think you can cut it?\" one of the audience asked.  Mr Barelli smiled cheerlessly and didnt answer. Instead, he uprooted from his hip pocket a slender stone and began phlegmatically to caress the blade of the"]]]
